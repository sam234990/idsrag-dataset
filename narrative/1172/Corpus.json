{"ori_id":"2e3b266eda62694b15254616844a26d972f5939b","title":"The Black Dwarf (novel)","context":"The Black Dwarf (novel)\n The story is set just after the Union of Scotland and England (1707), in the Liddesdale hills of the Scottish Borders, familiar to Scott from his work collecting ballads for The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border. The main character is based on David Ritchie, whom Scott met in the autumn of 1797. In the tale, the dwarf is Sir Edward Mauley, a hermit regarded by the locals as being in league with the Devil, who becomes embroiled in a complex tale of love, revenge, betrayal, Jacobite schemes and a threatened forced marriage. Scott began the novel well, \"but tired of the ground I had trode so often before... I quarrelled with my story, & bungled up a conclusion.\"\nCritics and public found it poor in comparison with its popular companion Old Mortality. One of the harshest reviews was in the Quarterly Review, written anonymously by Scott himself.\nThe introduction to The Black Dwarf attributes the work to Jedediah Cleishbotham, whom Scott had invented as a fictional editor of the Landlord series. It is here that we have the most complete view of this character.As Hobbie Elliot was returning over a wild moor from a day's sport, thinking of the legends he had heard of its supernatural occupants after nightfall, he was overtaken by Patrick Earnscliff, whose father had been killed in a quarrel with the laird of Ellislaw, Richard Vere. The moon suddenly revealed the figure of a human dwarf, who, on being spoken to, refused their offers of assistance, and bid them begone. Having invited Earnscliff to sup with his womenfolks, and pass the night at his farm, Hobbie accompanied him next morning to confront the strange being by daylight; and having assisted him in collecting stones for constructing a hut, they supplied him with food and other necessaries. In a short time he had completed his dwelling, and became known to the neighbours, for whose ailments he prescribed, as Elshender the Recluse.\nBeing visited by Isabel Vere and two of her friends, he told their fortunes, and he gave her a rose, with strict injunctions to bring it to him in her hour of adversity. As they rode homewards, their conversation implied that she loved young Patrick Earnscliff, but that Mr Vere intended her to marry Sir Frederick Langley. Another of the dwarf's visitors was Willie Graeme of Westburnflat, on his way to avenge an affront he had received from Hobbie Elliot, whose dog the next day killed one of the dwarf's goats, for which he warned him that retribution was at hand.\nShortly afterwards, Willie Graeme brought word that he and his companions had fired Hobbie's farm, and carried off his sweetheart, Grace Armstrong, and some cattle. On hearing this Elshie despatched him with an order for some money, and insisted that Grace should be given up uninjured. Having dispersed his neighbours in search of her, Hobbie Elliot went to consult Elshie, who handed him a bag of gold, which he declined, and intimated that he must seek her whom he had lost \"in the west.\" Earnscliff and his party had tracked the cattle as far as the English border, but on finding a large Jacobite force assembling there they returned, and it was decided to attack Westburnflat's stronghold. On approaching it, a female hand, which her lover swore was Grace's, waved a signal to them from a turret, and as they were preparing a bonfire to force the door, Graeme agreed to release his prisoner, who proved to be Isabel Vere. On reaching home, however, Elliot found that Grace had been brought back, and at dawn he started off to accept the money which the dwarf had offered him to repair his homestead. Isabel had been seized by ruffians while walking with her father, who appeared overcome with grief, and under the impression that Earnscliff was the offender; whereas Mr Ratcliffe, who managed his affairs, suggested that Sir Frederick had stronger motives for placing her under restraint. Mr Vere's suspicion seemed justified by their meeting his daughter returning under her lover's care; but she confirmed his version of the circumstances under which he had intervened, to the evident discomfiture of his rival and her father.\nAt a large gathering, the same day, of the Pretender's adherents in the hall of Ellieslaw Castle, Ralph Mareschal produced a letter which dissipated all their hopes, and Sir Frederick insisted that his marriage with Isabel should take place before midnight. She had consented, on her father's representation that his life would be forfeited if she refused, when Mr Ratcliffe persuaded her to make use of the token which Elshie had given her, and escorted her to his dwelling. He promised that at the foot of the altar he would redeem her; and, just as the ceremony was commencing in the chapel, a voice, which seemed to proceed from her mother's tomb, uttered the word \"Forbear.\" The dwarf's real name and rank were then revealed, as well as the circumstances under which he had acquired the power of thus interfering on Isabel's behalf, while Hobbie and his friends supported Mr Ratcliffe in dispersing the would-be rebels. Sir Edward at the same time disappeared from the neighbourhood, and Mr Vere retired, with an ample allowance, to the Continent, all the Ellieslaw property, as well as the baronet's, being settled on Earnscliff and his bride Isabel. Sir Frederick Langley was a few years afterwards executed at Preston, and Westburnflat earned a commission in Marlborough's army by his services in providing cattle for the commissariat.\nThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Black Dwarf, by Sir Walter Scott\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

TALES OF MY LANDLORD\n\nCOLLECTED AND REPORTED BY JEDEDIAH CLEISHBOTHAM, SCHOOLMASTER AND\nPARISH-CLERK OF GANDERCLEUGH.\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nAs I may, without vanity, presume that the name and official description\nprefixed to this Proem will secure it, from the sedate and reflecting\npart of mankind, to whom only I would be understood to address myself,\nsuch attention as is due to the sedulous instructor of youth, and the\ncareful performer of my Sabbath duties, I will forbear to hold up\na candle to the daylight, or to point out to the judicious those\nrecommendations of my labours which they must necessarily anticipate\nfrom the perusal of the title-page. Nevertheless, I am not unaware,\nthat, as Envy always dogs Merit at the heels, there may be those who\nwill whisper, that albeit my learning and good principles cannot\n(lauded be the heavens) be denied by any one, yet that my situation at\nGandercleugh hath been more favourable to my acquisitions in learning\nthan to the enlargement of my views of the ways and works of the present\ngeneration. To the which objection, if, peradventure, any such shall be\nstarted, my answer shall be threefold:\n\nFirst, Gandercleugh is, as it were, the central part--the navel (SI\nFAS SIT DICERE) of this our native realm of Scotland; so that men, from\nevery corner thereof, when travelling on their concernments of business,\neither towards our metropolis of law, by which I mean Edinburgh, or\ntowards our metropolis and mart of gain, whereby I insinuate Glasgow,\nare frequently led to make Gandercleugh their abiding stage and place of\nrest for the night. And it must be acknowledged by the most sceptical,\nthat I, who have sat in the leathern armchair, on the left-hand side of\nthe fire, in the common room of the Wallace Inn, winter and summer,\nfor every evening in my life, during forty years bypast (the Christian\nSabbaths only excepted), must have seen more of the manners and customs\nof various tribes and people, than if I had sought them out by my\nown painful travel and bodily labour. Even so doth the tollman at the\nwell-frequented turn-pike on the Wellbraehead, sitting at his ease in\nhis own dwelling, gather more receipt of custom, than if, moving forth\nupon the road, he were to require a contribution from each person whom\nhe chanced to meet in his journey, when, according to the vulgar adage,\nhe might possibly be greeted with more kicks than halfpence.\n\nBut, secondly, supposing it again urged, that Ithacus, the most wise of\nthe Greeks, acquired his renown, as the Roman poet hath assured us, by\nvisiting states and men, I reply to the Zoilus who shall adhere to this\nobjection, that, DE FACTO, I have seen states and men also; for I have\nvisited the famous cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, the former twice,\nand the latter three times, in the course of my earthly pilgrimage. And,\nmoreover, I had the honour to sit in the General Assembly (meaning, as\nan auditor, in the galleries thereof), and have heard as much goodly\nspeaking on the law of patronage, as, with the fructification thereof\nin mine own understanding, hath made me be considered as an oracle upon\nthat doctrine ever since my safe and happy return to Gandercleugh.\n\nAgain--and thirdly, If it be nevertheless pretended that my information\nand knowledge of mankind, however extensive, and however painfully\nacquired, by constant domestic enquiry, and by foreign travel, is,\nnatheless, incompetent to the task of recording the pleasant narratives\nof my Landlord, I will let these critics know, to their own eternal\nshame and confusion as well as to the abashment and discomfiture of all\nwho shall rashly take up a song against me, that I am NOT the writer,\nredacter, or compiler, of the Tales of my Landlord; nor am I, in one\nsingle iota, answerable for their contents, more or less. And now, ye\ngeneration of critics, who raise yourselves up as if it were brazen\nserpents, to hiss with your tongues, and to smite with your stings, bow\nyourselves down to your native dust, and acknowledge that yours have\nbeen the thoughts of ignorance, and the words of vain foolishness. Lo!\nye are caught in your own snare, and your own pit hath yawned for you.\nTurn, then, aside from the task that is too heavy for you; destroy\nnot your teeth by gnawing a file; waste not your strength by spurning\nagainst a castle wall; nor spend your breath in contending in swiftness\nwith a fleet steed; and let those weigh the Tales of my Landlord, who\nshall bring with them the scales of candour cleansed from the rust of\nprejudice by the hands of intelligent modesty. For these alone they were\ncompiled, as will appear from a brief narrative which my zeal for truth\ncompelled me to make supplementary to the present Proem.\n\nIt is well known that my Landlord was a pleasing and a facetious man,\nacceptable unto all the parish of Gandercleugh, excepting only the\nLaird, the Exciseman, and those for whom he refused to draw liquor upon\ntrust. Their causes of dislike I will touch separately, adding my own\nrefutation thereof.\n\nHis honour, the Laird, accused our Landlord, deceased, of having\nencouraged, in various times and places, the destruction of hares,\nrabbits, fowls black and grey, partridges, moor-pouts, roe-deer, and\nother birds and quadrupeds, at unlawful seasons, and contrary to the\nlaws of this realm, which have secured, in their wisdom, the slaughter\nof such animals for the great of the earth, whom I have remarked to take\nan uncommon (though to me, an unintelligible) pleasure therein. Now, in\nhumble deference to his honour, and in justifiable defence of my friend\ndeceased, I reply to this charge, that howsoever the form of such\nanimals might appear to be similar to those so protected by the law, yet\nit was a mere DECEPTIO VISUS; for what resembled hares were, in fact,\nHILL-KIDS, and those partaking of the appearance of moor-fowl, were\ntruly WOOD PIGEONS and consumed and eaten EO NOMINE, and not otherwise.\n\nAgain, the Exciseman pretended, that my deceased Landlord did encourage\nthat species of manufacture called distillation, without having an\nespecial permission from the Great, technically called a license, for\ndoing so. Now, I stand up to confront this falsehood; and in defiance\nof him, his gauging-stick, and pen and inkhorn, I tell him, that I\nnever saw, or tasted, a glass of unlawful aqua vitae in the house of\nmy Landlord; nay, that, on the contrary, we needed not such devices, in\nrespect of a pleasing and somewhat seductive liquor, which was vended\nand consumed at the Wallace Inn, under the name of MOUNTAIN DEW. If\nthere is a penalty against manufacturing such a liquor, let him show me\nthe statute; and when he does, I\u0092ll tell him if I will obey it or no.\n\nConcerning those who came to my Landlord for liquor, and went thirsty\naway, for lack of present coin, or future credit, I cannot but say it\nhas grieved my bowels as if the case had been mine own. Nevertheless, my\nLandlord considered the necessities of a thirsty soul, and would permit\nthem, in extreme need, and when their soul was impoverished for lack\nof moisture, to drink to the full value of their watches and wearing\napparel, exclusively of their inferior habiliments, which he was\nuniformly inexorable in obliging them to retain, for the credit of the\nhouse. As to mine own part, I may well say, that he never refused me\nthat modicum of refreshment with which I am wont to recruit nature after\nthe fatigues of my school. It is true, I taught his five sons English\nand Latin, writing, book-keeping, with a tincture of mathematics, and\nthat I instructed his daughter in psalmody. Nor do I remember me of\nany fee or HONORARIUM received from him on account of these my labours,\nexcept the compotations aforesaid. Nevertheless this compensation suited\nmy humour well, since it is a hard sentence to bid a dry throat wait\ntill quarter-day.\n\nBut, truly, were I to speak my simple conceit and belief, I think my\nLandlord was chiefly moved to waive in my behalf the usual requisition\nof a symbol, or reckoning, from the pleasure he was wont to take in my\nconversation, which, though solid and edifying in the main, was, like\na well-built palace, decorated with facetious narratives and devices,\ntending much to the enhancement and ornament thereof. And so pleased was\nmy Landlord of the Wallace in his replies during such colloquies, that\nthere was no district in Scotland, yea, and no peculiar, and, as it\nwere, distinctive custom therein practised, but was discussed betwixt\nus; insomuch, that those who stood by were wont to say, it was worth\na bottle of ale to hear us communicate with each other. And not a few\ntravellers, from distant parts, as well as from the remote districts of\nour kingdom, were wont to mingle in the conversation, and to tell news\nthat had been gathered in foreign lands, or preserved from oblivion in\nthis our own.\n\nNow I chanced to have contracted for teaching the lower classes with a\nyoung person called Peter, or Patrick, Pattieson, who had been educated\nfor our Holy Kirk, yea, had, by the license of presbytery, his voice\nopened therein as a preacher, who delighted in the collection of olden\ntales and legends, and in garnishing them with the flowers of poesy,\nwhereof he was a vain and frivolous professor. For he followed not the\nexample of those strong poets whom I proposed to him as a pattern, but\nformed versification of a flimsy and modern texture, to the compounding\nwhereof was necessary small pains and less thought. And hence I have\nchid him as being one of those who bring forward the fatal revolution\nprophesied by Mr. Robert Carey, in his Vaticination on the Death of the\ncelebrated Dr. John Donne:\n\n     Now thou art gone, and thy strict laws will be\n     Too hard for libertines in poetry;\n     Till verse (by thee refined) in this last age\n     Turn ballad rhyme.\n\nI had also disputations with him touching his indulging rather a\nflowing and redundant than a concise and stately diction in his prose\nexercitations. But notwithstanding these symptoms of inferior taste,\nand a humour of contradicting his betters upon passages of dubious\nconstruction in Latin authors, I did grievously lament when Peter\nPattieson was removed from me by death, even as if he had been the\noffspring of my own loins. And in respect his papers had been left in\nmy care (to answer funeral and death-bed expenses), I conceived myself\nentitled to dispose of one parcel thereof, entitled, \u0093Tales of my\nLandlord,\u0094 to one cunning in the trade (as it is called) of bookselling.\nHe was a mirthful man, of small stature, cunning in counterfeiting of\nvoices, and in making facetious tales and responses, and whom I have to\nlaud for the truth of his dealings towards me.\n\nNow, therefore, the world may see the injustice that charges me with\nincapacity to write these narratives, seeing, that though I have proved\nthat I could have written them if I would, yet, not having done so,\nthe censure will deservedly fall, if at all due, upon the memory of Mr.\nPeter Pattieson; whereas I must be justly entitled to the praise,\nwhen any is due, seeing that, as the Dean of St. Patrick\u0092s wittily and\nlogically expresseth it,\n\n     That without which a thing is not,\n     Is CAUSA SINE QUA NON.\n\nThe work, therefore, is unto me as a child is to a parent; in the which\nchild, if it proveth worthy, the parent hath honour and praise; but, if\notherwise, the disgrace will deservedly attach to itself alone.\n\nI have only further to intimate, that Mr. Peter Pattieson, in arranging\nthese Tales for the press, hath more consulted his own fancy than the\naccuracy of the narrative; nay, that he hath sometimes blended two\nor three stories together for the mere grace of his plots. Of which\ninfidelity, although I disapprove and enter my testimony against it, yet\nI have not taken upon me to correct the same, in respect it was the will\nof the deceased, that his manuscript should be submitted to the press\nwithout diminution or alteration. A fanciful nicety it was on the part\nof my deceased friend, who, if thinking wisely, ought rather to have\nconjured me, by all the tender ties of our friendship and common\npursuits, to have carefully revised, altered, and augmented, at my\njudgment and discretion. But the will of the dead must be scrupulously\nobeyed, even when we weep over their pertinacity and self-delusion. So,\ngentle reader, I bid you farewell, recommending you to such fare as the\nmountains of your own country produce; and I will only farther premise,\nthat each Tale is preceded by a short introduction, mentioning the\npersons by whom, and the circumstances under which, the materials\nthereof were collected.\n\nJEDEDIAH CLEISHBOTHAM.\n\n\n\n\nII. INTRODUCTION to THE BLACK DWARF.\n\nThe ideal being who is here presented as residing in solitude, and\nhaunted by a consciousness of his own deformity, and a suspicion of\nhis being generally subjected to the scorn of his fellow-men, is not\naltogether imaginary. An individual existed many years since, under\nthe author\u0092s observation, which suggested such a character. This poor\nunfortunate man\u0092s name was David Ritchie, a native of Tweeddale. He was\nthe son of a labourer in the slate-quarries of Stobo, and must have\nbeen born in the misshapen form which he exhibited, though he sometimes\nimputed it to ill-usage when in infancy. He was bred a brush-maker at\nEdinburgh, and had wandered to several places, working at his trade,\nfrom all which he was chased by the disagreeable attention which his\nhideous singularity of form and face attracted wherever he came. The\nauthor understood him to say he had even been in Dublin.\n\nTired at length of being the object of shouts, laughter, and derision,\nDavid Ritchie resolved, like a deer hunted from the herd, to retreat to\nsome wilderness, where he might have the least possible communication\nwith the world which scoffed at him. He settled himself, with this view,\nupon a patch of wild moorland at the bottom of a bank on the farm\nof Woodhouse, in the sequestered vale of the small river Manor, in\nPeeblesshire. The few people who had occasion to pass that way were much\nsurprised, and some superstitious persons a little alarmed, to see so\nstrange a figure as Bow\u0092d Davie (i.e. Crooked David) employed in a task,\nfor which he seemed so totally unfit, as that of erecting a house. The\ncottage which he built was extremely small, but the walls, as well as\nthose of a little garden that surrounded it, were constructed with an\nambitious degree of solidity, being composed of layers of large stones\nand turf; and some of the corner stones were so weighty, as to puzzle\nthe spectators how such a person as the architect could possibly have\nraised them. In fact, David received from passengers, or those who came\nattracted by curiosity, a good deal of assistance; and as no one knew\nhow much aid had been given by others, the wonder of each individual\nremained undiminished.\n\nThe proprietor of the ground, the late Sir James Naesmith, baronet,\nchanced to pass this singular dwelling, which, having been placed there\nwithout right or leave asked or given, formed an exact parallel with\nFalstaff\u0092s simile of a \u0093fair house built on another\u0092s ground;\u0094 so that\npoor David might have lost his edifice by mistaking the property where\nhe had erected it. Of course, the proprietor entertained no idea\nof exacting such a forfeiture, but readily sanctioned the harmless\nencroachment.\n\nThe personal description of Elshender of Mucklestane-Moor has been\ngenerally allowed to be a tolerably exact and unexaggerated portrait of\nDavid of Manor Water. He was not quite three feet and a half high, since\nhe could stand upright in the door of his mansion, which was just that\nheight. The following particulars concerning his figure and temper occur\nin the SCOTS MAGAZINE for 1817, and are now understood to have been\ncommunicated by the ingenious Mr. Robert Chambers of Edinburgh, who has\nrecorded with much spirit the traditions of the Good Town, and, in other\npublications, largely and agreeably added to the stock of our popular\nantiquities. He is the countryman of David Ritchie, and had the best\naccess to collect anecdotes of him.\n\n\u0093His skull,\u0094 says this authority, \u0093which was of an oblong and rather\nunusual shape, was said to be of such strength, that he could strike it\nwith ease through the panel of a door, or the end of a barrel. His laugh\nis said to have been quite horrible; and his screech-owl voice, shrill,\nuncouth, and dissonant, corresponded well with his other peculiarities.\n\n\u0093There was nothing very uncommon about his dress. He usually wore an old\nslouched hat when he went abroad; and when at home, a sort of cowl\nor night-cap. He never wore shoes, being unable to adapt them to\nhis mis-shapen finlike feet, but always had both feet and legs quite\nconcealed, and wrapt up with pieces of cloth. He always walked with a\nsort of pole or pike-staff, considerably taller than himself. His habits\nwere, in many respects, singular, and indicated a mind congenial to its\nuncouth tabernacle. A jealous, misanthropical, and irritable temper,\nwas his prominent characteristic. The sense of his deformity haunted him\nlike a phantom. And the insults and scorn to which this exposed him, had\npoisoned his heart with fierce and bitter feelings, which, from other\npoints in his character, do not appear to have been more largely infused\ninto his original temperament than that of his fellow-men.\n\n\u0093He detested children, on account of their propensity to insult and\npersecute him. To strangers he was generally reserved, crabbed, and\nsurly; and though he by no means refused assistance or charity, he\nseldom either expressed or exhibited much gratitude. Even towards\npersons who had been his greatest benefactors, and who possessed the\ngreatest share of his good-will, he frequently displayed much caprice\nand jealousy. A lady who had known him from his infancy, and who\nhas furnished us in the most obliging manner with some particulars\nrespecting him, says, that although Davie showed as much respect and\nattachment to her father\u0092s family, as it was in his nature to show\nto any, yet they were always obliged to be very cautious in their\ndeportment towards him. One day, having gone to visit him with another\nlady, he took them through his garden, and was showing them, with much\npride and good-humour, all his rich and tastefully assorted borders,\nwhen they happened to stop near a plot of cabbages which had been\nsomewhat injured by the caterpillars. Davie, observing one of the ladies\nsmile, instantly assumed his savage, scowling aspect, rushed among the\ncabbages, and dashed them to pieces with his KENT, exclaiming, \u0091I hate\nthe worms, for they mock me!\u0092\n\n\u0093Another lady, likewise a friend and old acquaintance of his, very\nunintentionally gave David mortal offence on a similar occasion.\nThrowing back his jealous glance as he was ushering her into his garden,\nhe fancied he observed her spit, and exclaimed, with great ferocity, \u0091Am\nI a toad, woman! that ye spit at me--that ye spit at me?\u0092 and without\nlistening to any answer or excuse, drove her out of his garden\nwith imprecations and insult. When irritated by persons for whom he\nentertained little respect, his misanthropy displayed itself in words,\nand sometimes in actions, of still greater rudeness; and he used on\nsuch occasions the most unusual and singularly savage imprecations and\nthreats.\u0094 [SCOTS MAGAZINE, vol. lxxx. p.207.]\n\nNature maintains a certain balance of good and evil in all her works;\nand there is no state perhaps so utterly desolate, which does not\npossess some source of gratification peculiar to itself, This poor\nman, whose misanthropy was founded in a sense on his own preternatural\ndeformity, had yet his own particular enjoyments. Driven into solitude,\nhe became an admirer of the beauties of nature. His garden, which he\nsedulously cultivated, and from a piece of wild moorland made a very\nproductive spot, was his pride and his delight; but he was also an\nadmirer of more natural beauty: the soft sweep of the green hill, the\nbubbling of a clear fountain, or the complexities of a wild thicket,\nwere scenes on which he often gazed for hours, and, as he said, with\ninexpressible delight. It was perhaps for this reason that he was fond\nof Shenstone\u0092s pastorals, and some parts of PARADISE LOST. The author\nhas heard his most unmusical voice repeat the celebrated description of\nParadise, which he seemed fully to appreciate. His other studies were of\na different cast, chiefly polemical. He never went to the parish church,\nand was therefore suspected of entertaining heterodox opinions, though\nhis objection was probably to the concourse of spectators, to whom he\nmust have exposed his unseemly deformity. He spoke of a future state\nwith intense feeling, and even with tears. He expressed disgust at the\nidea, of his remains being mixed with the common rubbish, as he called\nit, of the churchyard, and selected with his usual taste a beautiful and\nwild spot in the glen where he had his hermitage, in which to take his\nlast repose. He changed his mind, however, and was finally interred in\nthe common burial-ground of Manor parish.\n\nThe author has invested Wise Elshie with some qualities which made\nhim appear, in the eyes of the vulgar, a man possessed of supernatural\npower. Common fame paid David Ritchie a similar compliment, for some\nof the poor and ignorant, as well as all the children, in the\nneighbourhood, held him to be what is called uncanny. He himself did not\naltogether discourage the idea; it enlarged his very limited circle\nof power, and in so far gratified his conceit; and it soothed his\nmisanthropy, by increasing his means of giving terror or pain. But even\nin a rude Scottish glen thirty years back, the fear of sorcery was very\nmuch out of date.\n\nDavid Ritchie affected to frequent solitary scenes, especially such\nas were supposed to be haunted, and valued himself upon his courage in\ndoing so. To be sure he had little chance of meeting anything more ugly\nthan himself. At heart, he was superstitious, and planted many\nrowans (mountain ashes) around his hut, as a certain defence against\nnecromancy. For the same reason, doubtless, he desired to have\nrowan-trees set above his grave.\n\nWe have stated that David Ritchie loved objects of natural beauty.\nHis only living favourites were a dog and a cat, to which he was\nparticularly attached, and his bees, which he treated with great care.\nHe took a sister, latterly, to live in a hut adjacent to his own, but\nhe did not permit her to enter it. She was weak in intellect, but not\ndeformed in person; simple, or rather silly, but not, like her brother,\nsullen or bizarre. David was never affectionate to her; it was not in\nhis nature; but he endured her. He maintained himself and her by the\nsale of the product of their garden and bee-hives; and, latterly,\nthey had a small allowance from the parish. Indeed, in the simple\nand patriarchal state in which the country then was, persons in the\nsituation of David and his sister were sure to be supported. They had\nonly to apply to the next gentleman or respectable farmer, and were sure\nto find them equally ready and willing to supply their very moderate\nwants. David often received gratuities from strangers, which he never\nasked, never refused, and never seemed to consider as an obligation. He\nhad a right, indeed, to regard himself as one of Nature\u0092s paupers,\nto whom she gave a title to be maintained by his kind, even by that\ndeformity which closed against him all ordinary ways of supporting\nhimself by his own labour. Besides, a bag was suspended in the mill for\nDavid Ritchie\u0092s benefit; and those who were carrying home a melder of\nmeal, seldom failed to add a GOWPEN [Handful] to the alms-bag of the\ndeformed cripple. In short, David had no occasion for money, save to\npurchase snuff, his only luxury, in which he indulged himself liberally.\nWhen he died, in the beginning of the present century, he was found\nto have hoarded about twenty pounds, a habit very consistent with his\ndisposition; for wealth is power, and power was what David Ritchie\ndesired to possess, as a compensation for his exclusion from human\nsociety.\n\nHis sister survived till the publication of the tale to which this brief\nnotice forms the introduction; and the author is sorry to learn that a\nsort of \u0093local sympathy,\u0094 and the curiosity then expressed concerning\nthe Author of WAVERLEY and the subjects of his Novels, exposed the poor\nwoman to enquiries which gave her pain. When pressed about her brother\u0092s\npeculiarities, she asked, in her turn, why they would not permit the\ndead to rest? To others, who pressed for some account of her parents,\nshe answered in the same tone of feeling.\n\nThe author saw this poor, and, it may be said, unhappy man, in autumn\n1797 being then, as he has the happiness still to remain, connected by\nties of intimate friendship with the family of the venerable Dr. Adam\nFergusson, the philosopher and historian, who then resided at the\nmansion-house of Halyards, in the vale of Manor, about a mile from\nRitchie\u0092s hermitage, the author was upon a visit at Halyards, which\nlasted for several days, and was made acquainted with this singular\nanchorite, whom Dr. Fergusson considered as an extraordinary character,\nand whom he assisted in various ways, particularly by the occasional\nloan of books. Though the taste of the philosopher and the poor peasant\ndid not, it may be supposed, always correspond, [I remember David was\nparticularly anxious to see a book, which he called, I think, LETTERS TO\nELECT LADIES, and which, he said, was the best composition he had\never read; but Dr. Fergusson\u0092s library did not supply the volume.] Dr.\nFergusson considered him as a man of a powerful capacity and original\nideas, but whose mind was thrown off its just bias by a predominant\ndegree of self-love and self-opinion, galled by the sense of ridicule\nand contempt, and avenging itself upon society, in idea at least, by a\ngloomy misanthropy.\n\nDavid Ritchie, besides the utter obscurity of his life while in\nexistence, had been dead for many years, when it occurred to the author\nthat such a character might be made a powerful agent in fictitious\nnarrative. He, accordingly, sketched that of Elshie of the\nMucklestane-Moor. The story was intended to be longer, and the\ncatastrophe more artificially brought out; but a friendly critic, to\nwhose opinion I subjected the work in its progress, was of opinion, that\nthe idea of the Solitary was of a kind too revolting, and more likely to\ndisgust than to interest the reader. As I had good right to consider my\nadviser as an excellent judge of public opinion, I got off my subject\nby hastening the story to an end, as fast as it was possible; and, by\nhuddling into one volume, a tale which was designed to occupy two, have\nperhaps produced a narrative as much disproportioned and distorted, as\nthe Black Dwarf who is its subject.\n\n\n\n\nIII. THE BLACK DWARF.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nPRELIMINARY.\n\n     Hast any philosophy in thee, Shepherd?--AS YOU LIKE IT.\n\nIt was a fine April morning (excepting that it had snowed hard the night\nbefore, and the ground remained covered with a dazzling mantle of six\ninches in depth) when two horsemen rode up to the Wallace Inn. The first\nwas a strong, tall, powerful man, in a grey riding-coat, having a hat\ncovered with waxcloth, a huge silver-mounted horsewhip, boots, and\ndreadnought overalls. He was mounted on a large strong brown mare, rough\nin coat, but well in condition, with a saddle of the yeomanry cut, and\na double-bitted military bridle. The man who accompanied him was\napparently his servant; he rode a shaggy little grey pony, had a blue\nbonnet on his head, and a large check napkin folded about his neck, wore\na pair of long blue worsted hose instead of boots, had his gloveless\nhands much stained with tar, and observed an air of deference and\nrespect towards his companion, but without any of those indications\nof precedence and punctilio which are preserved between the gentry\nand their domestics. On the contrary, the two travellers entered the\ncourt-yard abreast, and the concluding sentence of the conversation\nwhich had been carrying on betwixt them was a joint ejaculation, \u0093Lord\nguide us, an this weather last, what will come o\u0092 the lambs!\u0094 The hint\nwas sufficient for my Landlord, who, advancing to take the horse of the\nprincipal person, and holding him by the reins as he dismounted, while\nhis ostler rendered the same service to the attendant, welcomed the\nstranger to Gandercleugh, and, in the same breath, enquired, \u0093What news\nfrom the south hielands?\u0094\n\n\u0093News?\u0094 said the farmer, \u0093bad eneugh news, I think;--an we can carry\nthrough the yowes, it will be a\u0092 we can do; we maun e\u0092en leave the lambs\nto the Black Dwarfs care.\u0094\n\n\u0093Ay, ay,\u0094 subjoined the old shepherd (for such he was), shaking his\nhead, \u0093he\u0092ll be unco busy amang the morts this season.\u0094\n\n\u0093The Black Dwarf!\u0094 said MY LEARNED FRIEND AND PATRON, Mr. Jedediah\nCleishbotham, \u0093and what sort of a personage may he be?\u0094\n\n[We have, in this and other instances, printed in italics (CAPITALS\nin this etext) some few words which the worthy editor, Mr. Jedediah\nCleishbotham, seems to have interpolated upon the text of his deceased\nfriend, Mr. Pattieson. We must observe, once for all, that such\nliberties seem only to have been taken by the learned gentleman where\nhis own character and conduct are concerned; and surely he must be the\nbest judge of the style in which his own character and conduct should be\ntreated of.]\n\n\u0093Hout awa, man,\u0094 answered the farmer, \u0093ye\u0092ll hae heard o\u0092 Canny Elshie\nthe Black Dwarf, or I am muckle mistaen--A\u0092 the warld tells tales about\nhim, but it\u0092s but daft nonsense after a\u0092--I dinna believe a word o\u0092t\nfrae beginning to end.\u0094\n\n\u0093Your father believed it unco stievely, though,\u0094 said the old man, to\nwhom the scepticism of his master gave obvious displeasure.\n\n\u0093Ay, very true, Bauldie, but that was in the time o\u0092 the\nblackfaces--they believed a hantle queer things in thae days, that\nnaebody heeds since the lang sheep cam in.\u0094\n\n\u0093The mair\u0092s the pity, the mair\u0092s the pity,\u0094 said the old man. \u0093Your\nfather, and sae I have aften tell\u0092d ye, maister, wad hae been sair vexed\nto hae seen the auld peel-house wa\u0092s pu\u0092d down to make park dykes; and\nthe bonny broomy knowe, where he liked sae weel to sit at e\u0092en, wi\u0092 his\nplaid about him, and look at the kye as they cam down the loaning, ill\nwad he hae liked to hae seen that braw sunny knowe a\u0092 riven out wi\u0092 the\npleugh in the fashion it is at this day.\u0094\n\n\u0093Hout, Bauldie,\u0094 replied the principal, \u0093tak ye that dram the landlord\u0092s\noffering ye, and never fash your head about the changes o\u0092 the warld,\nsae lang as ye\u0092re blithe and bien yoursell.\u0094\n\n\u0093Wussing your health, sirs,\u0094 said the shepherd; and having taken off his\nglass, and observed the whisky was the right thing, he continued, \u0093It\u0092s\nno for the like o\u0092 us to be judging, to be sure; but it was a bonny\nknowe that broomy knowe, and an unco braw shelter for the lambs in a\nsevere morning like this.\u0094\n\n\u0093Ay,\u0094 said his patron, \u0093but ye ken we maun hae turnips for the lang\nsheep, billie, and muckle hard wark to get them, baith wi\u0092 the pleugh\nand the howe; and that wad sort ill wi\u0092 sitting on the broomy knowe, and\ncracking about Black Dwarfs, and siccan clavers, as was the gate lang\nsyne, when the short sheep were in the fashion.\u0094\n\n\u0093Aweel, aweel, maister,\u0094 said the attendant, \u0093short sheep had short\nrents, I\u0092m thinking.\u0094\n\nHere my WORTHY AND LEARNED patron again interposed, and observed, \u0093that\nhe could never perceive any material difference, in point of longitude,\nbetween one sheep and another.\u0094\n\nThis occasioned a loud hoarse laugh on the part of the farmer, and an\nastonished stare on the part of the shepherd.\n\n\u0093It\u0092s the woo\u0092, man,--it\u0092s the woo\u0092, and no the beasts themsells, that\nmakes them be ca\u0092d lang or short. I believe if ye were to measure their\nbacks, the short sheep wad be rather the langer-bodied o\u0092 the twa; but\nit\u0092s the woo\u0092 that pays the rent in thae days, and it had muckle need.\u0094\n\n\u0093Odd, Bauldie says very true,--short sheep did make short rents--my\nfather paid for our steading just threescore punds, and it stands me in\nthree hundred, plack and bawbee.--And that\u0092s very true--I hae nae time\nto be standing here clavering--Landlord, get us our breakfast, and see\nan\u0092 get the yauds fed--I am for doun to Christy Wilson\u0092s, to see if him\nand me can gree about the luckpenny I am to gie him for his year-aulds.\nWe had drank sax mutchkins to the making the bargain at St. Boswell\u0092s\nfair, and some gate we canna gree upon the particulars preceesely, for\nas muckle time as we took about it--I doubt we draw to a plea--But hear\nye, neighbour,\u0094 addressing my WORTHY AND LEARNED patron, \u0093if ye want to\nhear onything about lang or short sheep, I will be back here to my kail\nagainst ane o\u0092clock; or, if ye want ony auld-warld stories about the\nBlack Dwarf, and sic-like, if ye\u0092ll ware a half mutchkin upon Bauldie\nthere, he\u0092ll crack t\u0092ye like a pen-gun. And I\u0092se gie ye a mutchkin\nmysell, man, if I can settle weel wi\u0092 Christy Wilson.\u0094\n\nThe farmer returned at the hour appointed, and with him came Christy\nWilson, their difference having been fortunately settled without an\nappeal to the gentlemen of the long robe. My LEARNED AND WORTHY patron\nfailed not to attend, both on account of the refreshment promised to the\nmind and to the body, ALTHOUGH HE IS KNOWN TO PARTAKE OF THE LATTER IN\nA VERY MODERATE DEGREE; and the party, with which my Landlord was\nassociated, continued to sit late in the evening, seasoning their liquor\nwith many choice tales and songs. The last incident which I recollect,\nwas my LEARNED AND WORTHY patron falling from his chair, just as he\nconcluded a long lecture upon temperance, by reciting, from the \u0093Gentle\nShepherd,\u0094 a couplet, which he RIGHT HAPPILY transferred from the vice\nof avarice to that of ebriety:\n\n     He that has just eneugh may soundly sleep,\n     The owercome only fashes folk to keep.\n\nIn the course of the evening the Black Dwarf had not been forgotten,\nand the old shepherd, Bauldie, told so many stories of him, that they\nexcited a good deal of interest. It also appeared, though not till the\nthird punch-bowl was emptied, that much of the farmer\u0092s scepticism on\nthe subject was affected, as evincing a liberality of thinking, and a\nfreedom from ancient prejudices, becoming a man who paid three hundred\npounds a-year of rent, while, in fact, he had a lurking belief in the\ntraditions of his forefathers. After my usual manner, I made farther\nenquiries of other persons connected with the wild and pastoral district\nin which the scene of the following narrative is placed, and I was\nfortunate enough to recover many links of the story, not generally\nknown, and which account, at least in some degree, for the circumstances\nof exaggerated marvel with which superstition has attired it in the more\nvulgar traditions.\n\n[The Black Dwarf, now almost forgotten, was once held a formidable\npersonage by the dalesmen of the Border, where he got the blame of\nwhatever mischief befell the sheep or cattle. \u0093He was,\u0094 says Dr. Leyden,\nwho makes considerable use of him in the ballad called the Cowt of\nKeeldar, \u0093a fairy of the most malignant order--the genuine Northern\nDuergar.\u0094 The best and most authentic account of this dangerous and\nmysterious being occurs in a tale communicated to the author by that\neminent antiquary, Richard Surtees, Esq. of Mainsforth, author of the\nHISTORY OF THE BISHOPRIC OF DURHAM.\n\nAccording to this well-attested legend, two young Northumbrians were\nout on a shooting party, and had plunged deep among the mountainous\nmoorlands which border on Cumberland. They stopped for refreshment in\na little secluded dell by the side of a rivulet. There, after they had\npartaken of such food as they brought with them, one of the party fell\nasleep; the other, unwilling to disturb his friend\u0092s repose, stole\nsilently out of the dell with the purpose of looking around him, when he\nwas astonished to find himself close to a being who seemed not to belong\nto this world, as he was the most hideous dwarf that the sun had ever\nshone on. His head was of full human size, forming a frightful contrast\nwith his height, which was considerably under four feet. It was thatched\nwith no other covering than long matted red hair, like that of the felt\nof a badger in consistence, and in colour a reddish brown, like the hue\nof the heather-blossom. His limbs seemed of great strength; nor was he\notherwise deformed than from their undue proportion in thickness to his\ndiminutive height. The terrified sportsman stood gazing on this horrible\napparition, until, with an angry countenance, the being demanded by what\nright he intruded himself on those hills, and destroyed their harmless\ninhabitants. The perplexed stranger endeavoured to propitiate the\nincensed dwarf, by offering to surrender his game, as he would to an\nearthly Lord of the Manor. The proposal only redoubled the offence\nalready taken by the dwarf, who alleged that he was the lord of those\nmountains, and the protector of the wild creatures who found a retreat\nin their solitary recesses; and that all spoils derived from their\ndeath, or misery, were abhorrent to him. The hunter humbled himself\nbefore the angry goblin, and by protestations of his ignorance, and\nof his resolution to abstain from such intrusion in future, at last\nsucceeded in pacifying him. The gnome now became more communicative, and\nspoke of himself as belonging to a species of beings something between\nthe angelic race and humanity. He added, moreover, which could hardly\nhave been anticipated, that he had hopes of sharing in the redemption of\nthe race of Adam. He pressed the sportsman to visit his dwelling, which\nhe said was hard by, and plighted his faith for his safe return. But at\nthis moment, the shout of the sportsman\u0092s companion was heard calling\nfor his friend, and the dwarf, as if unwilling that more than one\nperson should be cognisant of his presence, disappeared as the young man\nemerged from the dell to join his comrade.\n\nIt was the universal opinion of those most experienced in such\nmatters, that if the shooter had accompanied the spirit, he would,\nnotwithstanding the dwarf\u0092s fair pretences, have been either torn to\npieces, or immured for years in the recesses of some fairy hill.\n\nSuch is the last and most authentic account of the apparition of the\nBlack Dwarf.]\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n     Will none but Hearne the Hunter serve your turn?\n     --MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR.\n\nIn one of the most remote districts of the south of Scotland, where an\nideal line, drawn along the tops of lofty and bleak mountains, separates\nthat land from her sister kingdom, a young man, called Halbert, or\nHobbie Elliot, a substantial farmer, who boasted his descent from old\nMartin Elliot of the Preakin-tower, noted in Border story and song, was\non his return from deer-stalking. The deer, once so numerous among these\nsolitary wastes, were now reduced to a very few herds, which, sheltering\nthemselves in the most remote and inaccessible recesses, rendered the\ntask of pursuing them equally toilsome and precarious. There were,\nhowever, found many youth of the country ardently attached to this\nsport, with all its dangers and fatigues. The sword had been sheathed\nupon the Borders for more than a hundred years, by the peaceful union of\nthe crowns in the reign of James the First of Great Britain. Still\nthe country retained traces of what it had been in former days; the\ninhabitants, their more peaceful avocations having been repeatedly\ninterrupted by the civil wars of the preceding century, were scarce yet\nbroken in to the habits of regular industry, sheep-farming had not been\nintroduced upon any considerable scale, and the feeding of black cattle\nwas the chief purpose to which the hills and valleys were applied. Near\nto the farmer\u0092s house, the tenant usually contrived to raise such a crop\nof oats or barley, as afforded meal for his family; and the whole of\nthis slovenly and imperfect mode of cultivation left much time upon his\nown hands, and those of his domestics. This was usually employed by the\nyoung men in hunting and fishing; and the spirit of adventure, which\nformerly led to raids and forays in the same districts, was still to be\ndiscovered in the eagerness with which they pursued those rural sports.\n\nThe more high-spirited among the youth were, about the time that our\nnarrative begins, expecting, rather with hope than apprehension, an\nopportunity of emulating their fathers in their military achievements,\nthe recital of which formed the chief part of their amusement within\ndoors. The passing of the Scottish act of security had given the alarm\nof England, as it seemed to point at a separation of the two British\nkingdoms, after the decease of Queen Anne, the reigning sovereign.\nGodolphin, then at the head of the English administration, foresaw that\nthere was no other mode of avoiding the probable extremity of a civil\nwar, but by carrying through an incorporating union. How that treaty\nwas managed, and how little it seemed for some time to promise the\nbeneficial results which have since taken place to such extent, may be\nlearned from the history of the period. It is enough for our purpose\nto say, that all Scotland was indignant at the terms on which their\nlegislature had surrendered their national independence. The general\nresentment led to the strangest leagues and to the wildest plans. The\nCameronians were about to take arms for the restoration of the house of\nStewart, whom they regarded, with justice, as their oppressors; and\nthe intrigues of the period presented the strange picture of papists,\nprelatists, and presbyterians, caballing among themselves against the\nEnglish government, out of a common feeling that their country had been\ntreated with injustice. The fermentation was universal; and, as the\npopulation of Scotland had been generally trained to arms, under the act\nof security, they were not indifferently prepared for war, and waited\nbut the declaration of some of the nobility to break out into open\nhostility. It was at this period of public confusion that our story\nopens.\n\nThe cleugh, or wild ravine, into which Hobbie Elliot had followed the\ngame, was already far behind him, and he was considerably advanced on\nhis return homeward, when the night began to close upon him. This\nwould have been a circumstance of great indifference to the experienced\nsportsman, who could have walked blindfold over every inch of his\nnative heaths, had it not happened near a spot, which, according to\nthe traditions of the country, was in extremely bad fame, as haunted\nby supernatural appearances. To tales of this kind Hobbie had, from his\nchildhood, lent an attentive ear; and as no part of the country afforded\nsuch a variety of legends, so no man was more deeply read in their\nfearful lore than Hobbie of the Heugh-foot; for so our gallant was\ncalled, to distinguish him from a round dozen of Elliots who bore the\nsame Christian name. It cost him no efforts, therefore, to call to\nmemory the terrific incidents connected with the extensive waste upon\nwhich he was now entering. In fact, they presented themselves with a\nreadiness which he felt to be somewhat dismaying.\n\nThis dreary common was called Mucklestane-Moor, from a huge column of\nunhewn granite, which raised its massy head on a knell near the centre\nof the heath, perhaps to tell of the mighty dead who slept beneath, or\nto preserve the memory of some bloody skirmish. The real cause of\nits existence had, however, passed away; and tradition, which is as\nfrequently an inventor of fiction as a preserver of truth, had supplied\nits place with a supplementary legend of her own, which now came full\nupon Hobbie\u0092s memory. The ground about the pillar was strewed, or rather\nencumbered, with many large fragments of stone of the same consistence\nwith the column, which, from their appearance as they lay scattered on\nthe waste, were popularly called the Grey Geese of Mucklestane-Moor. The\nlegend accounted for this name and appearance by the catastrophe of a\nnoted and most formidable witch who frequented these hills in former\ndays, causing the ewes to KEB, and the kine to cast their calves, and\nperforming all the feats of mischief ascribed to these evil beings. On\nthis moor she used to hold her revels with her sister hags; and rings\nwere still pointed out on which no grass nor heath ever grew, the turf\nbeing, as it were, calcined by the scorching hoofs of their diabolical\npartners.\n\nOnce upon a time this old hag is said to have crossed the moor, driving\nbefore her a flock of geese, which she proposed to sell to advantage\nat a neighbouring fair;--for it is well known that the fiend, however\nliberal in imparting his powers of doing mischief, ungenerously leaves\nhis allies under the necessity of performing the meanest rustic labours\nfor subsistence. The day was far advanced, and her chance of obtaining\na good price depended on her being first at the market. But the geese,\nwhich had hitherto preceded her in a pretty orderly manner, when they\ncame to this wide common, interspersed with marshes and pools of water,\nscattered in every direction, to plunge into the element in which they\ndelighted. Incensed at the obstinacy with which they defied all her\nefforts to collect them, and not remembering the precise terms of the\ncontract by which the fiend was bound to obey her commands for a certain\nspace, the sorceress exclaimed, \u0093Deevil, that neither I nor they ever\nstir from this spot more!\u0094 The words were hardly uttered, when, by a\nmetamorphosis as sudden as any in Ovid, the hag and her refractory flock\nwere converted into stone, the angel whom she served, being a strict\nformalist, grasping eagerly at an opportunity of completing the ruin of\nher body and soul by a literal obedience to her orders. It is said, that\nwhen she perceived and felt the transformation which was about to take\nplace, she exclaimed to the treacherous fiend, \u0093Ah, thou false thief!\nlang hast thou promised me a grey gown, and now I am getting ane that\nwill last for ever.\u0094 The dimensions of the pillar, and of the stones,\nwere often appealed to, as a proof of the superior stature and size of\nold women and geese in the days of other years, by those praisers of\nthe past who held the comfortable opinion of the gradual degeneracy of\nmankind.\n\nAll particulars of this legend Hobbie called to mind as he passed along\nthe moor. He also remembered, that, since the catastrophe had taken\nplace, the scene of it had been avoided, at least after night-fall, by\nall human beings, as being the ordinary resort of kelpies, spunkies, and\nother demons, once the companions of the witch\u0092s diabolical revels,\nand now continuing to rendezvous upon the same spot, as if still in\nattendance on their transformed mistress. Hobbie\u0092s natural hardihood,\nhowever, manfully combated with these intrusive sensations of awe.\nHe summoned to his side the brace of large greyhounds, who were the\ncompanions of his sports, and who were wont, in his own phrase, to fear\nneither dog nor devil; he looked at the priming of his piece, and, like\nthe clown in Hallowe\u0092en, whistled up the warlike ditty of Jock of the\nSide, as a general causes his drums be beat to inspirit the doubtful\ncourage of his soldiers.\n\nIn this state of mind, he was very glad to hear a friendly voice shout\nin his rear, and propose to him a partner on the road. He slackened his\npace, and was quickly joined by a youth well known to him, a gentleman\nof some fortune in that remote country, and who had been abroad on the\nsame errand with himself. Young Earnscliff, \u0093of that ilk,\u0094 had\nlately come of age, and succeeded to a moderate fortune, a good deal\ndilapidated, from the share his family had taken in the disturbances\nof the period. They were much and generally respected in the country;\na reputation which this young gentleman seemed likely to sustain, as he\nwas well educated, and of excellent dispositions.\n\n\u0093Now, Earnscliff;\u0094 exclaimed Hobbie, \u0093I am glad to meet your honour\nony gate, and company\u0092s blithe on a bare moor like this--it\u0092s an unco\nbogilly bit--Where hae ye been sporting?\u0094\n\n\u0093Up the Carla Cleugh, Hobbie,\u0094 answered Earnscliff, returning his\ngreeting. \u0093But will our dogs keep the peace, think you?\u0094\n\n\u0093Deil a fear o\u0092 mine,\u0094 said Hobbie, \u0093they hae scarce a leg to stand\non.--Odd! the deer\u0092s fled the country, I think! I have been as far\nas Inger-fell-foot, and deil a horn has Hobbie seen, excepting three\nred-wud raes, that never let me within shot of them, though I gaed\na mile round to get up the wind to them, an\u0092 a\u0092. Deil o\u0092 me wad care\nmuckle, only I wanted some venison to our auld gude-dame. The carline,\nshe sits in the neuk yonder, upbye, and cracks about the grand shooters\nand hunters lang syne--Odd, I think they hae killed a\u0092 the deer in the\ncountry, for my part.\u0094\n\n\u0093Well, Hobbie, I have shot a fat buck, and sent him to Earnscliff this\nmorning--you shall have half of him for your grandmother.\u0094\n\n\u0093Mony thanks to ye, Mr. Patrick, ye\u0092re kend to a\u0092 the country for a kind\nheart. It will do the auld wife\u0092s heart gude--mair by token, when she\nkens it comes frae you--and maist of a\u0092 gin ye\u0092ll come up and take your\nshare, for I reckon ye are lonesome now in the auld tower, and a\u0092 your\nfolk at that weary Edinburgh. I wonder what they can find to do amang\na wheen ranks o\u0092 stane-houses wi\u0092 slate on the tap o\u0092 them, that might\nlive on their ain bonny green hills.\u0094\n\n\u0093My education and my sisters\u0092 has kept my mother much in Edinburgh for\nseveral years,\u0094 said Earnscliff; \u0093but I promise you I propose to make up\nfor lost time.\u0094\n\n\u0093And ye\u0092ll rig out the auld tower a bit,\u0094 said Hobbie, \u0093and live\nhearty and neighbour-like wi\u0092 the auld family friends, as the Laird o\u0092\nEarnscliff should? I can tell ye, my mother--my grandmother I mean--but,\nsince we lost our ain mother, we ca\u0092 her sometimes the tane, and\nsometimes the tother--but, ony gate, she conceits hersell no that\ndistant connected wi\u0092 you.\u0094\n\n\u0093Very true, Hobbie, and I will come to the Heugh-foot to dinner\nto-morrow with all my heart.\u0094\n\n\u0093Weel, that\u0092s kindly said! We are auld neighbours, an we were nae\nkin--and my gude-dame\u0092s fain to see you--she clavers about your father\nthat was killed lang syne.\u0094\n\n\u0093Hush, hush, Hobbie--not a word about that--it\u0092s a story better\nforgotten.\u0094\n\n\u0093I dinna ken--if it had chanced amang our folk, we wad hae keepit it in\nmind mony a day till we got some mends for\u0092t--but ye ken your ain ways\nbest, you lairds--I have heard say that Ellieslaw\u0092s friend stickit your\nsire after the laird himsell had mastered his sword.\u0094\n\n\u0093Fie, fie, Hobbie; it was a foolish brawl, occasioned by wine and\npolitics--many swords were drawn--it is impossible to say who struck the\nblow.\u0094\n\n\u0093At ony rate, auld Ellieslaw was aiding and abetting; and I am sure if\nye were sae disposed as to take amends on him, naebody could say it was\nwrang, for your father\u0092s blood is beneath his nails--and besides there\u0092s\nnaebody else left that was concerned to take amends upon, and he\u0092s a\nprelatist and a jacobite into the bargain--I can tell ye the country\nfolk look for something atween ye.\u0094\n\n\u0093O for shame, Hobbie!\u0094 replied the young Laird; \u0093you, that profess\nreligion, to stir your friend up to break the law, and take vengeance\nat his own hand, and in such a bogilly bit too, where we know not what\nbeings may be listening to us!\u0094\n\n\u0093Hush, hush!\u0094 said Hobbie, drawing nearer to his companion, \u0093I was nae\nthinking o\u0092 the like o\u0092 them--But I can guess a wee bit what keeps your\nhand up, Mr. Patrick; we a\u0092 ken it\u0092s no lack o\u0092 courage, but the twa\ngrey een of a bonny lass, Miss Isabel Vere, that keeps you sae sober.\u0094\n\n\u0093I assure you, Hobbie,\u0094 said his companion, rather angrily, \u0093I assure\nyou you are mistaken; and it is extremely wrong of you, either to think\nof, or to utter, such an idea; I have no idea of permitting freedoms to\nbe carried so far as to connect my name with that of any young lady.\u0094\n\n\u0093Why, there now--there now!\u0094 retorted Elliot; \u0093did I not say it was nae\nwant o\u0092 spunk that made ye sae mim?--Weel, weel, I meant nae offence;\nbut there\u0092s just ae thing ye may notice frae a friend. The auld Laird\nof Ellieslaw has the auld riding blood far hetter at his heart than ye\nhae--troth, he kens naething about thae newfangled notions o\u0092 peace and\nquietness--he\u0092s a\u0092 for the auld-warld doings o\u0092 lifting and laying on,\nand he has a wheen stout lads at his back too, and keeps them weel up in\nheart, and as fu\u0092 o\u0092 mischief as young colts. Where he gets the gear to\ndo\u0092t nane can say; he lives high, and far abune his rents here; however,\nhe pays his way--Sae, if there\u0092s ony out-break in the country, he\u0092s\nlikely to break out wi\u0092 the first--and weel does he mind the auld\nquarrels between ye, I\u0092m surmizing he\u0092ll be for a touch at the auld\ntower at Earnscliff.\u0094\n\n\u0093Well, Hobbie,\u0094 answered the young gentleman, \u0093if he should be so ill\nadvised, I shall try to make the old tower good against him, as it has\nbeen made good by my betters against his betters many a day ago.\u0094\n\n\u0093Very right--very right--that\u0092s speaking like a man now,\u0094 said the stout\nyeoman; \u0093and, if sae should be that this be sae, if ye\u0092ll just gar your\nservant jow out the great bell in the tower, there\u0092s me, and my twa\nbrothers, and little Davie of the Stenhouse, will be wi\u0092 you, wi\u0092 a\u0092 the\npower we can make, in the snapping of a flint.\u0094\n\n\u0093Many thanks, Hobbie,\u0094 answered Earnscliff; \u0093but I hope we shall have no\nwar of so unnatural and unchristian a kind in our time.\u0094\n\n\u0093Hout, sir, hout,\u0094 replied Elliot; \u0093it wad be but a wee bit neighbour\nwar, and Heaven and earth would make allowances for it in this\nuncultivated place--it\u0092s just the nature o\u0092 the folk and the land--we\ncanna live quiet like Loudon folk--we haena sae muckle to do. It\u0092s\nimpossible.\u0094\n\n\u0093Well, Hobbie,\u0094 said the Laird, \u0093for one who believes so deeply as you\ndo in supernatural appearances, I must own you take Heaven in your own\nhand rather audaciously, considering where we are walking.\u0094\n\n\u0093What needs I care for the Mucklestane-Moor ony mair than ye do\nyoursell, Earnscliff?\u0094 said Hobbie, something offended; \u0093to be sure,\nthey do say there\u0092s a sort o\u0092 worricows and lang-nebbit things about the\nland, but what need I care for them? I hae a good conscience, and little\nto answer for, unless it be about a rant amang the lasses, or a splore\nat a fair, and that\u0092s no muckle to speak of. Though I say it mysell, I\nam as quiet a lad and as peaceable--\u0094\n\n\u0093And Dick Turnbull\u0092s head that you broke, and Willie of Winton whom you\nshot at?\u0094 said his travelling companion.\n\n\u0093Hout, Earnscliff, ye keep a record of a\u0092 men\u0092s misdoings--Dick\u0092s head\u0092s\nhealed again, and we\u0092re to fight out the quarrel at Jeddart, on the\nRood-day, so that\u0092s like a thing settled in a peaceable way; and then I\nam friends wi\u0092 Willie again, puir chield--it was but twa or three hail\ndraps after a\u0092. I wad let onybody do the like o\u0092t to me for a pint o\u0092\nbrandy. But Willie\u0092s lowland bred, poor fallow, and soon frighted for\nhimsell--And, for the worricows, were we to meet ane on this very bit--\u0094\n\n\u0093As is not unlikely,\u0094 said young Earnscliff, \u0093for there stands your old\nwitch, Hobbie.\u0094\n\n\u0093I say,\u0094 continued Elliot, as if indignant at this hint--\u0093I say, if the\nauld carline hersell was to get up out o\u0092 the grund just before us here,\nI would think nae mair--But, gude preserve us, Earnscliff; what can yon,\nbe!\u0094\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n     Brown Dwarf, that o\u0092er the moorland strays,\n     Thy name to Keeldar tell!\n     \u0093The Brown Man of the Moor, that stays\n     Beneath the heather-bell.\u0094--JOHN LEYDEN\n\nThe object which alarmed the young farmer in the middle of his valorous\nprotestations, startled for a moment even his less prejudiced companion.\nThe moon, which had arisen during their conversation, was, in the phrase\nof that country, wading or struggling with clouds, and shed only a\ndoubtful and occasional light. By one of her beams, which streamed upon\nthe great granite column to which they now approached, they discovered\na form, apparently human, but of a size much less than ordinary, which\nmoved slowly among the large grey stones, not like a person intending\nto journey onward, but with the slow, irregular, flitting movement of a\nbeing who hovers around some spot of melancholy recollection, uttering\nalso, from time to time, a sort of indistinct muttering sound. This so\nmuch resembled his idea of the motions of an apparition, that Hobbie\nElliot, making a dead pause, while his hair erected itself upon his\nscalp, whispered to his companion, \u0093It\u0092s Auld Ailie hersell! Shall I gie\nher a shot, in the name of God?\u0094\n\n\u0093For Heaven\u0092s sake, no,\u0094 said his companion, holding down the weapon\nwhich he was about to raise to the aim--\u0093for Heaven\u0092s sake, no; it\u0092s\nsome poor distracted creature.\u0094\n\n\u0093Ye\u0092re distracted yoursell, for thinking of going so near to her,\u0094 said\nElliot, holding his companion in his turn, as he prepared to advance.\n\u0093We\u0092ll aye hae time to pit ower a bit prayer (an I could but mind ane)\nafore she comes this length--God! she\u0092s in nae hurry,\u0094 continued he,\ngrowing bolder from his companion\u0092s confidence, and the little notice\nthe apparition seemed to take of them. \u0093She hirples like a hen on a het\ngirdle. I redd ye, Earnscliff\u0094 (this he added in a gentle whisper), \u0093let\nus take a cast about, as if to draw the wind on a buck--the bog is no\nabune knee-deep, and better a saft road as bad company.\u0094 [The Scots use\nthe epithet soft, IN MALAM PARTEM, in two cases, at least. A SOFT road\nis a road through quagmire and bogs; and SOFT weather signifies that\nwhich is very rainy.]\n\nEarnscliff, however, in spite of his companion\u0092s resistance and\nremonstrances, continued to advance on the path they had originally\npursued, and soon confronted the object of their investigation.\n\nThe height of the figure, which appeared even to decrease as they\napproached it, seemed to be under four feet, and its form, as far as the\nimperfect light afforded them the means of discerning, was very nearly\nas broad as long, or rather of a spherical shape, which could only\nbe occasioned by some strange personal deformity. The young sportsman\nhailed this extraordinary appearance twice, without receiving any\nanswer, or attending to the pinches by which his companion endeavoured\nto intimate that their best course was to walk on, without giving\nfarther disturbance to a being of such singular and preternatural\nexterior. To the third repeated demand of \u0093Who are you? What do you here\nat this hour of night?\u0094--a voice replied, whose shrill, uncouth, and\ndissonant tones made Elliot step two paces back, and startled even his\ncompanion, \u0093Pass on your way, and ask nought at them that ask nought at\nyou.\u0094\n\n\u0093What do you do here so far from shelter? Are you benighted on your\njourney? Will you follow us home [\u0091God forbid!\u0092 ejaculated Hobbie\nElliot, involuntarily), and I will give you a lodging?\u0094\n\n\u0093I would sooner lodge by mysell in the deepest of the Tarras-flow,\u0094\n again whispered Hobbie.\n\n\u0093Pass on your way,\u0094 rejoined the figure, the harsh tones of his voice\nstill more exalted by passion. \u0093I want not your guidance--I want not\nyour lodging--it is five years since my head was under a human roof, and\nI trust it was for the last time.\u0094\n\n\u0093He is mad,\u0094 said Earnscliff.\n\n\u0093He has a look of auld Humphrey Ettercap, the tinkler, that perished\nin this very moss about five years syne,\u0094 answered his superstitious\ncompanion; \u0093but Humphrey wasna that awfu\u0092 big in the bouk.\u0094\n\n\u0093Pass on your way,\u0094 reiterated the object of their curiosity, \u0093the\nbreath of your human bodies poisons the air around me--the sound of pour\nhuman voices goes through my ears like sharp bodkins.\u0094\n\n\u0093Lord safe us!\u0094 whispered Hobbie, \u0093that the dead should bear sie fearfu\u0092\nill-will to the living!--his saul maun be in a puir way, I\u0092m jealous.\u0094\n\n\u0093Come, my friend,\u0094 said Earnscliff, \u0093you seem to suffer under some\nstrong affliction; common humanity will not allow us to leave you here.\u0094\n\n\u0093Common humanity!\u0094 exclaimed the being, with a scornful laugh that\nsounded like a shriek, \u0093where got ye that catch-word--that noose for\nwoodcocks--that common disguise for man-traps--that bait which the\nwretched idiot who swallows, will soon find covers a hook with barbs ten\ntimes sharper than those you lay for the animals which you murder for\nyour luxury!\u0094\n\n\u0093I tell you, my friend,\u0094 again replied Earnscliff, \u0093you are incapable of\njudging of your own situation--you will perish in this wilderness, and\nwe must, in compassion, force you along with us.\u0094\n\n\u0093I\u0092ll hae neither hand nor foot in\u0092t,\u0094 said Hobbie; \u0093let the ghaist take\nhis ain way, for God\u0092s sake!\u0094\n\n\u0093My blood be on my own head, if I perish here,\u0094 said the figure; and,\nobserving Earnscliff meditating to lay hold on him, he added, \u0093And\nyour blood be upon yours, if you touch but the skirt of my garments, to\ninfect me with the taint of mortality!\u0094\n\nThe moon shone more brightly as he spoke thus, and Earnscliff observed\nthat he held out his right hand armed with some weapon of offence, which\nglittered in the cold ray like the blade of a long knife, or the barrel\nof a pistol. It would have been madness to persevere in his attempt upon\na being thus armed, and holding such desperate language, especially as\nit was plain he would have little aid from his companion, who had fairly\nleft him to settle matters with the apparition as he could, and had\nproceeded a few paces on his way homeward. Earnscliff, however, turned\nand followed Hobbie, after looking back towards the supposed maniac,\nwho, as if raised to frenzy by the interview, roamed wildly around the\ngreat stone, exhausting his voice in shrieks and imprecations, that\nthrilled wildly along the waste heath.\n\nThe two sportsmen moved on some time in silence, until they were out\nof hearing of these uncouth sounds, which was not ere they had gained a\nconsiderable distance from the pillar that gave name to the moor. Each\nmade his private comments on the scene they had witnessed, until Hobbie\nElliot suddenly exclaimed, \u0093Weel, I\u0092ll uphaud that yon ghaist, if it\nbe a ghaist, has baith done and suffered muckle evil in the flesh, that\ngars him rampauge in that way after he is dead and gane.\u0094\n\n\u0093It seems to me the very madness of misanthropy,\u0094 said Earnscliff;\nfollowing his own current of thought.\n\n\u0093And ye didna think it was a spiritual creature, then?\u0094 asked Hobbie at\nhis companion.\n\n\u0093Who, I?--No, surely.\u0094\n\n\u0093Weel, I am partly of the mind mysell that it may be a live thing--and\nyet I dinna ken, I wadna wish to see ony thing look liker a bogle.\u0094\n\n\u0093At any rate,\u0094 said Earnscliff, \u0093I will ride over to-morrow and see what\nhas become of the unhappy being.\u0094\n\n\u0093In fair daylight?\u0094 queried the yeoman; \u0093then, grace o\u0092 God, I\u0092se be\nwi\u0092 ye. But here we are nearer to Heugh-foot than to your house by twa\nmile,--hadna ye better e\u0092en gae hame wi\u0092 me, and we\u0092ll send the callant\non the powny to tell them that you are wi\u0092 us, though I believe there\u0092s\nnaebody at hame to wait for you but the servants and the cat.\u0094\n\n\u0093Have with you then, friend Hobbie,\u0094 said the young hunter; \u0093and as I\nwould not willingly have either the servants be anxious, or puss forfeit\nher supper, in my absence, I\u0092ll be obliged to you to send the boy as you\npropose.\u0094\n\n\u0093Aweel, that IS kind, I must say. And ye\u0092ll gae hame to Heugh-foot?\nThey\u0092ll be right blithe to see you, that will they.\u0094\n\nThis affair settled, they walked briskly on a little farther, when,\ncoming to the ridge of a pretty steep hill, Hobbie Elliot exclaimed,\n\u0093Now, Earnscliff, I am aye glad when I come to this very bit--Ye see\nthe light below, that\u0092s in the ha\u0092 window, where grannie, the gash auld\ncarline, is sitting birling at her wheel--and ye see yon other light\nthat\u0092s gaun whiddin\u0092 back and forrit through amang the windows? that\u0092s\nmy cousin, Grace Armstrong,--she\u0092s twice as clever about the house as my\nsisters, and sae they say themsells, for they\u0092re good-natured lasses as\never trode on heather; but they confess themsells, and sae does grannie,\nthat she has far maist action, and is the best goer about the toun, now\nthat grannie is off the foot hersell.--My brothers, ane o\u0092 them\u0092s away\nto wait upon the chamberlain, and ane\u0092s at Moss-phadraig, that\u0092s our led\nfarm--he can see after the stock just as weel as I can do.\u0094\n\n\u0093You are lucky, my good friend, in having so many valuable relations.\u0094\n\n\u0093Troth am I--Grace make me thankful, I\u0092se never deny it.--But will\nye tell me now, Earnscliff, you that have been at college, and the\nhigh-school of Edinburgh, and got a\u0092 sort o\u0092 lair where it was to\nbe best gotten--will ye tell me--no that it\u0092s ony concern of mine in\nparticular,--but I heard the priest of St. John\u0092s, and our minister,\nbargaining about it at the Winter fair, and troth they baith spak very\nweel--Now, the priest says it\u0092s unlawful to marry ane\u0092s cousin; but I\ncannot say I thought he brought out the Gospel authorities half sae weel\nas our minister--our minister is thought the best divine and the best\npreacher atween this and Edinburgh--Dinna ye think he was likely to be\nright?\u0094\n\n\u0093Certainly marriage, by all protestant Christians, is held to be as free\nas God made it by the Levitical law; so, Hobbie, there can be no bar,\nlegal or religious, betwixt you and Miss Armstrong.\u0094\n\n\u0093Hout awa\u0092 wi\u0092 your joking, Earnscliff,\u0094 replied his companion,--\u0093ye\nare angry aneugh yoursell if ane touches you a bit, man, on the sooth\nside of the jest--No that I was asking the question about Grace, for ye\nmaun ken she\u0092s no my cousin-germain out and out, but the daughter of\nmy uncle\u0092s wife by her first marriage, so she\u0092s nae kith nor kin to\nme--only a connexion like. But now we\u0092re at the Sheeling-hill--I\u0092ll fire\noff my gun, to let them ken I\u0092m coming, that\u0092s aye my way; and if I hae\na deer I gie them twa shots, ane for the deer and ane for mysell.\u0094\n\nHe fired off his piece accordingly, and the number of lights were\nseen to traverse the house, and even to gleam before it. Hobbie Elliot\npointed out one of these to Earnscliff, which seemed to glide from the\nhouse towards some of the outhouses-\u0093That\u0092s Grace hersell,\u0094 said Hobbie.\n\u0093She\u0092ll no meet me at the door, I\u0092se warrant her--but she\u0092ll be awa\u0092,\nfor a\u0092 that, to see if my hounds\u0092 supper be ready, poor beasts.\u0094\n\n\u0093Love me, love my dog,\u0094 answered Earnscliff. \u0093Ah, Hobbie, you are a\nlucky young fellow!\u0094\n\nThis observation was uttered with something like a sigh, which\napparently did not escape the ear of his companion.\n\n\u0093Hout, other folk may be as lucky as I am--O how I have seen Miss Isabel\nVere\u0092s head turn after somebody when they passed ane another at the\nCarlisle races! Wha kens but things may come round in this world?\u0094\n\nEarnscliff muttered something like an answer; but whether in assent of\nthe proposition, or rebuking the application of it, could not easily be\ndiscovered; and it seems probable that the speaker himself was willing\nhis meaning should rest in doubt and obscurity. They had now descended\nthe broad loaning, which, winding round the foot of the steep bank,\nor heugh, brought them in front of the thatched, but comfortable,\nfarm-house, which was the dwelling of Hobbie Elliot and his family.\n\nThe doorway was thronged with joyful faces; but the appearance of a\nstranger blunted many a gibe which had been prepared on Hobbie\u0092s lack\nof success in the deer-stalking. There was a little bustle among three\nhandsome young women, each endeavouring to devolve upon another the task\nof ushering the stranger into the apartment, while probably all were\nanxious to escape for the purpose of making some little personal\narrangements, before presenting themselves to a young gentleman in a\ndishabille only intended for their brother.\n\nHobbie, in the meanwhile, bestowing some hearty and general abuse upon\nthem all (for Grace was not of the party), snatched the candle from the\nhand of one of the rustic coquettes, as she stood playing pretty with\nit in her hand, and ushered his guest into the family parlour, or rather\nhall; for the place having been a house of defence in former times, the\nsitting apartment was a vaulted and paved room, damp and dismal enough\ncompared with the lodgings of the yeomanry of our days, but which, when\nwell lighted up with a large sparkling fire of turf and bog-wood, seemed\nto Earnscliff a most comfortable exchange for the darkness and bleak\nblast of the hill. Kindly and repeatedly was he welcomed by the\nvenerable old dame, the mistress of the family, who, dressed in her\ncoif and pinners, her close and decent gown of homespun wool, but with a\nlarge gold necklace and ear-rings, looked, what she really was, the lady\nas well as the farmer\u0092s wife, while, seated in her chair of wicker, by\nthe corner of the great chimney, she directed the evening occupations\nof the young women, and of two or three stout serving wenches, who sate\nplying their distaffs behind the backs of their young mistresses.\n\nAs soon as Earnscliff had been duly welcomed, and hasty orders issued\nfor some addition to the evening meal, his grand-dame and sisters opened\ntheir battery upon Hobbie Elliot for his lack of success against the\ndeer.\n\n\u0093Jenny needna have kept up her kitchen-fire for a\u0092 that Hobbie has\nbrought hame,\u0094 said one sister.\n\n\u0093Troth no, lass,\u0094 said another; \u0093the gathering peat, if it was weel\nblawn, wad dress a\u0092 our Hobbie\u0092s venison.\u0094 [The gathering peat is the\npiece of turf left to treasure up the secret seeds of fire, without any\ngenerous consumption of fuel; in a word, to keep the fire alive.]\n\n\u0093Ay, or the low of the candle, if the wind wad let it hide steady,\u0094 said\na third; \u0093if I were him, I would bring hame a black craw, rather than\ncome back three times without a buck\u0092s horn to blaw on.\u0094\n\nHobbie turned from the one to the other, regarding them alternately\nwith a frown on his brow, the augury of which was confuted by the\ngood-humoured laugh on the lower part of his countenance. He then strove\nto propitiate them, by mentioning the intended present of his companion.\n\n\u0093In my young days,\u0094 said the old lady, \u0093a man wad hae been ashamed\nto come back frae the hill without a buck hanging on each side o\u0092 his\nhorse, like a cadger carrying calves.\u0094\n\n\u0093I wish they had left some for us then, grannie,\u0094 retorted Hobbie;\n\u0093they\u0092ve cleared the country o\u0092 them, thae auld friends o\u0092 yours, I\u0092m\nthinking.\u0094\n\n\u0093We see other folk can find game, though you cannot, Hobbie,\u0094 said the\neldest sister, glancing a look at young Earnscliff.\n\n\u0093Weel, weel, woman, hasna every dog his day, begging Earnscliff\u0092s\npardon for the auld saying--Mayna I hae his luck, and he mine, another\ntime?--It\u0092s a braw thing for a man to be out a\u0092 day, and frighted--na, I\nwinna say that neither but mistrysted wi\u0092 bogles in the hame-coming, an\u0092\nthen to hae to flyte wi\u0092 a wheen women that hae been doing naething a\u0092\nthe live-lang day, but whirling a bit stick, wi\u0092 a thread trailing at\nit, or boring at a clout.\u0094\n\n\u0093Frighted wi\u0092 bogles!\u0094 exclaimed the females, one and all,--for great\nwas the regard then paid, and perhaps still paid, in these glens, to all\nsuch fantasies.\n\n\u0093I did not say frighted, now--I only said mis-set wi\u0092 the thing--And\nthere was but ae bogle, neither--Earnscliff, ye saw it; as weel as I\ndid?\u0094\n\nAnd he proceeded, without very much exaggeration, to detail, in his own\nway, the meeting they had with the mysterious being at Mucklestane-Moor,\nconcluding, he could not conjecture what on earth it could be, unless it\nwas either the Enemy himsell, or some of the auld Peghts that held the\ncountry lang syne.\n\n\u0093Auld Peght!\u0094 exclaimed the grand-dame; \u0093na, na--bless thee frae scathe,\nmy bairn, it\u0092s been nae Peght that--it\u0092s been the Brown Man of the\nMoors! O weary fa\u0092 thae evil days!--what can evil beings be coming for\nto distract a poor country, now it\u0092s peacefully settled, and living in\nlove and law--O weary on him! he ne\u0092er brought gude to these lands or\nthe indwellers. My father aften tauld me he was seen in the year o\u0092 the\nbloody fight at Marston-Moor, and then again in Montrose\u0092s troubles, and\nagain before the rout o\u0092 Dunbar, and, in my ain time, he was seen about\nthe time o\u0092 Bothwell-Brigg, and they said the second-sighted Laird of\nBenarbuck had a communing wi\u0092 him some time afore Argyle\u0092s landing,\nbut that I cannot speak to sae preceesely--it was far in the west.--O,\nbairns, he\u0092s never permitted but in an ill time, sae mind ilka ane o\u0092 ye\nto draw to Him that can help in the day of trouble.\u0094\n\nEarnscliff now interposed, and expressed his firm conviction that the\nperson they had seen was some poor maniac, and had no commission from\nthe invisible world to announce either war or evil. But his opinion\nfound a very cold audience, and all joined to deprecate his purpose of\nreturning to the spot the next day.\n\n\u0093O, my bonny bairn,\u0094 said the old dame (for, in the kindness of\nher heart, she extended her parental style to all in whom she was\ninterested)---\u0093You should beware mair than other folk--there\u0092s been a\nheavy breach made in your house wi\u0092 your father\u0092s bloodshed, and wi\u0092\nlaw-pleas, and losses sinsyne;--and you are the flower of the flock, and\nthe lad that will build up the auld bigging again (if it be His will)\nto be an honour to the country, and a safeguard to those that dwell\nin it--you, before others, are called upon to put yoursell in no rash\nadventures--for yours was aye ower venturesome a race, and muckle harm\nthey have got by it.\u0094\n\n\u0093But I am sure, my good friend, you would not have me be afraid of going\nto an open moor in broad daylight?\u0094\n\n\u0093I dinna ken,\u0094 said the good old dame; \u0093I wad never bid son or friend o\u0092\nmine haud their hand back in a gude cause, whether it were a friend\u0092s or\ntheir ain--that should be by nae bidding of mine, or of ony body that\u0092s\ncome of a gentle kindred--But it winna gang out of a grey head like\nmine, that to gang to seek for evil that\u0092s no fashing wi\u0092 you, is clean\nagainst law and Scripture.\u0094\n\nEarnscliff resigned an argument which he saw no prospect of maintaining\nwith good effect, and the entrance of supper broke off the conversation.\nMiss Grace had by this time made her appearance, and Hobbie, not without\na conscious glance at Earnscliff, placed himself by her side. Mirth\nand lively conversation, in which the old lady of the house took the\ngood-humoured share which so well becomes old age, restored to the\ncheeks of the damsels the roses which their brother\u0092s tale of the\napparition had chased away, and they danced and sung for an hour after\nsupper as if there were no such things as goblins in the world.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n     I am Misanthropos, and hate mankind;\n     For thy part, I do wish thou wert a dog,\n     That I might love thee something.--TIMON OF ATHENS\n\nOn the following morning, after breakfast, Earnscliff took leave of\nhis hospitable friends, promising to return in time to partake of the\nvenison, which had arrived from his house. Hobbie, who apparently took\nleave of him at the door of his habitation, slunk out, however, and\njoined him at the top of the hill.\n\n\u0093Ye\u0092ll be gaun yonder, Mr. Patrick; feind o\u0092 me will mistryst you for\na\u0092 my mother says. I thought it best to slip out quietly though, in case\nshe should mislippen something of what we\u0092re gaun to do--we maunna vex\nher at nae rate--it was amaist the last word my father said to me on his\ndeathbed.\u0094\n\n\u0093By no means, Hobbie,\u0094 said Earnscliff; \u0093she well merits all your\nattention.\u0094\n\n\u0093Troth, for that matter, she would be as sair vexed amaist for you as\nfor me. But d\u0092ye really think there\u0092s nae presumption in venturing back\nyonder?--We hae nae special commission, ye ken.\u0094\n\n\u0093If I thought as you do, Hobbie,\u0094 said the young gentleman, \u0093I would not\nperhaps enquire farther into this business; but as I am of opinion that\npreternatural visitations are either ceased altogether, or become very\nrare in our days, I am unwilling to leave a matter uninvestigated which\nmay concern the life of a poor distracted being.\u0094\n\n\u0093Aweel, aweel, if ye really think that,\u0094 answered Hobbie\ndoubtfully--\u0093And it\u0092s for certain the very fairies--I mean the very good\nneighbours themsells (for they say folk suldna ca\u0092 them fairies) that\nused to be seen on every green knowe at e\u0092en, are no half sae often\nvisible in our days. I canna depone to having ever seen ane mysell, but,\nI ance heard ane whistle ahint me in the moss, as like a whaup [Curlew]\nas ae thing could be like anither. And mony ane my father saw when he\nused to come hame frae the fairs at e\u0092en, wi\u0092 a drap drink in his head,\nhonest man.\u0094\n\nEarnscliff was somewhat entertained with the gradual declension of\nsuperstition from one generation to another which was inferred In this\nlast observation; and they continued to reason on such subjects, until\nthey came in sight of the upright stone which gave name to the moor.\n\n\u0093As I shall answer,\u0094 says Hobbie, \u0093yonder\u0092s the creature creeping about\nyet!--But it\u0092s daylight, and you have your gun, and I brought out my bit\nwhinger--I think we may venture on him.\u0094\n\n\u0093By all manner of means,\u0094 said Earnscliff; \u0093but, in the name of wonder,\nwhat can he be doing there?\u0094\n\n\u0093Biggin a dry-stane dyke, I think, wi\u0092 the grey geese, as they ca\u0092 thae\ngreat loose stanes--Odd, that passes a\u0092 thing I e\u0092er heard tell of!\u0094\n\nAs they approached nearer, Earnscliff could not help agreeing with his\ncompanion. The figure they had seen the night before seemed slowly and\ntoilsomely labouring to pile the large stones one upon another, as if\nto form a small enclosure. Materials lay around him in great plenty, but\nthe labour of carrying on the work was immense, from the size of most of\nthe stones; and it seemed astonishing that he should have succeeded in\nmoving several which he had already arranged for the foundation of his\nedifice. He was struggling to move a fragment of great size when the two\nyoung men came up, and was so intent upon executing his purpose, that\nhe did not perceive them till they were close upon him. In straining\nand heaving at the stone, in order to place it according to his wish,\nhe displayed a degree of strength which seemed utterly inconsistent with\nhis size and apparent deformity. Indeed, to judge from the difficulties\nhe had already surmounted, he must have been of Herculean powers; for\nsome of the stones he had succeeded in raising apparently required two\nmen\u0092s strength to have moved them. Hobbie\u0092s suspicions began to revive,\non seeing the preternatural strength he exerted.\n\n\u0093I am amaist persuaded it\u0092s the ghaist of a stane-mason--see siccan\nband-statnes as he\u0092s laid i--An it be a man, after a\u0092, I wonder what\nhe wad take by the rood to build a march dyke. There\u0092s ane sair wanted\nbetween Cringlehope and the Shaws.--Honest man\u0094 (raising his voice), \u0093ye\nmake good firm wark there?\u0094\n\nThe being whom he addressed raised his eyes with a ghastly stare, and,\ngetting up from his stooping posture, stood before them in all his\nnative and hideous deformity. His head was of uncommon size, covered\nwith a fell of shaggy hair, partly grizzled with age; his eyebrows,\nshaggy and prominent, overhung a pair of small dark, piercing eyes,\nset far back in their sockets, that rolled with a portentous wildness,\nindicative of a partial insanity. The rest of his features were of the\ncoarse, rough-hewn stamp, with which a painter would equip a giant\nin romance; to which was added the wild, irregular, and peculiar\nexpression, so often seen in the countenances of those whose persons are\ndeformed. His body, thick and square, like that of a man of middle size,\nwas mounted upon two large feet; but nature seemed to have forgotten the\nlegs and the thighs, or they were so very short as to be hidden by the\ndress which he wore. His arms were long and brawny, furnished with two\nmuscular hands, and, where uncovered in the eagerness of his labour,\nwere shagged with coarse black hair. It seemed as if nature had\noriginally intended the separate parts of his body to be the members of\na giant, but had afterwards capriciously assigned them to the person of\na dwarf, so ill did the length of his arms and the iron strength of his\nframe correspond with the shortness of his stature. His clothing was a\nsort of coarse brown tunic, like a monk\u0092s frock, girt round him with a\nbelt of seal-skin. On his head he had a cap made of badger\u0092s skin, or\nsome other rough fur, which added considerably to the grotesque effect\nof his whole appearance, and overshadowed features, whose habitual\nexpression seemed that of sullen malignant misanthropy.\n\nThis remarkable Dwarf gazed on the two youths in silence, with a dogged\nand irritated look, until Earnscliff, willing to soothe him into better\ntemper, observed, \u0093You are hard tasked, my friend; allow us to assist\nyou.\u0094\n\nElliot and he accordingly placed the stone, by their joint efforts, upon\nthe rising wall. The Dwarf watched them with the eye of a taskmaster,\nand testified, by peevish gestures, his impatience at the time which\nthey took in adjusting the stone. He pointed to another--they raised it\nalso--to a third, to a fourth--they continued to humour him, though with\nsome trouble, for he assigned them, as if intentionally, the heaviest\nfragments which lay near.\n\n\u0093And now, friend,\u0094 said Elliot, as the unreasonable Dwarf indicated\nanother stone larger than any they had moved, \u0093Earnscliff may do as he\nlikes; but be ye man or be ye waur, deil be in my fingers if I break\nmy back wi\u0092 heaving thae stanes ony langer like a barrow-man, without\ngetting sae muckle as thanks for my pains.\u0094\n\n\u0093Thanks!\u0094 exclaimed the Dwarf, with a motion expressive of the utmost\ncontempt--\u0093There--take them, and fatten upon them! Take them, and may\nthey thrive with you as they have done with me--as they have done with\nevery mortal worm that ever heard the word spoken by his fellow reptile!\nHence--either labour or begone!\u0094\n\n\u0093This is a fine reward we have, Earnscliff, for building a tabernacle\nfor the devil, and prejudicing our ain souls into the bargain, for what\nwe ken.\u0094\n\n\u0093Our presence,\u0094 answered Earnscliff, \u0093seems only to irritate his frenzy;\nwe had better leave him, and send some one to provide him with food and\nnecessaries.\u0094\n\nThey did so. The servant dispatched for this purpose found the Dwarf\nstill labouring at his wall, but could not extract a word from him.\nThe lad, infected with the superstitions of the country, did not long\npersist in an attempt to intrude questions or advice on so singular a\nfigure, but having placed the articles which he had brought for his use\non a stone at some distance, he left them at the misanthrope\u0092s disposal.\n\nThe Dwarf proceeded in his labours, day after day, with an assiduity so\nincredible as to appear almost supernatural. In one day he often seemed\nto have done the work of two men, and his building soon assumed\nthe appearance of the walls of a hut, which, though very small, and\nconstructed only of stones and turf, without any mortar, exhibited, from\nthe unusual size of the stones employed, an appearance of solidity very\nuncommon for a cottage of such narrow dimensions and rude construction.\nEarnscliff; attentive to his motions, no sooner perceived to what they\ntended, than he sent down a number of spars of wood suitable for forming\nthe roof, which he caused to be left in the neighbourhood of the spot,\nresolving next day to send workmen to put them up. But his purpose was\nanticipated, for in the evening, during the night, and early in the\nmorning, the Dwarf had laboured so hard, and with such ingenuity, that\nhe had nearly completed the adjustment of the rafters. His next labour\nwas to cut rushes and thatch his dwelling, a task which he performed\nwith singular dexterity.\n\nAs he seemed averse to receive any aid beyond the occasional assistance\nof a passenger, materials suitable to his purpose, and tools, were\nsupplied to him, in the use of which he proved to be skilful. He\nconstructed the door and window of his cot, he adjusted a rude bedstead,\nand a few shelves, and appeared to become somewhat soothed in his temper\nas his accommodations increased.\n\nHis next task was to form a strong enclosure, and to cultivate the land\nwithin it to the best of his power; until, by transporting mould, and\nworking up what was upon the spot, he formed a patch of garden-ground.\nIt must be naturally supposed, that, as above hinted, this solitary\nbeing received assistance occasionally from such travellers as crossed\nthe moor by chance, as well as from several who went from curiosity to\nvisit his works. It was, indeed, impossible to see a human creature, so\nunfitted, at first sight, for hard labour, toiling with such unremitting\nassiduity, without stopping a few minutes to aid him in his task; and,\nas no one of his occasional assistants was acquainted with the degree\nof help which the Dwarf had received from others, the celerity of his\nprogress lost none of its marvels in their eyes. The strong and compact\nappearance of the cottage, formed in so very short a space, and by such\na being, and the superior skill which he displayed in mechanics, and in\nother arts, gave suspicion to the surrounding neighbours. They insisted,\nthat, if he was not a phantom,--an opinion which was now\nabandoned, since he plainly appeared a being of blood and bone with\nthemselves,--yet he must be in close league with the invisible world,\nand have chosen that sequestered spot to carry on his communication with\nthem undisturbed. They insisted, though in a different sense from the\nphilosopher\u0092s application of the phrase, that he was never less alone\nthan when alone; and that from the heights which commanded the moor at\na distance, passengers often discovered a person at work along with\nthis dweller of the desert, who regularly disappeared as soon as they\napproached closer to the cottage. Such a figure was also occasionally\nseen sitting beside him at the door, walking with him in the moor, or\nassisting him in fetching water from his fountain. Earnscliff explained\nthis phenomenon by supposing it to be the Dwarf\u0092s shadow.\n\n\u0093Deil a shadow has he,\u0094 replied Hobbie Elliot, who was a strenuous\ndefender of the general opinion; \u0093he\u0092s ower far in wi\u0092 the Auld Ane to\nhave a shadow. Besides,\u0094 he argued more logically, \u0093wha ever heard of a\nshadow that cam between a body and the sun? and this thing, be it what\nit will, is thinner and taller than the body himsell, and has been seen\nto come between him and the sun mair than anes or twice either.\u0094\n\nThese suspicions, which, in any other part of the country, might have\nbeen attended with investigations a little inconvenient to the supposed\nwizard, were here only productive of respect and awe. The recluse being\nseemed somewhat gratified by the marks of timid veneration with which\nan occasional passenger approached his dwelling, the look of startled\nsurprise with which he surveyed his person and his premises, and the\nhurried step with which he pressed his retreat as he passed the awful\nspot. The boldest only stopped to gratify their curiosity by a hasty\nglance at the walls of his cottage and garden, and to apologize for it\nby a courteous salutation, which the inmate sometimes deigned to return\nby a word or a nod. Earnscliff often passed that way, and seldom without\nenquiring after the solitary inmate, who seemed now to have arranged his\nestablishment for life.\n\nIt was impossible to engage him in any conversation on his own personal\naffairs; nor was he communicative or accessible in talking on any other\nsubject whatever, although he seemed to have considerably relented in\nthe extreme ferocity of his misanthropy, or rather to be less frequently\nvisited with the fits of derangement of which this was a symptom. No\nargument could prevail upon him to accept anything beyond the simplest\nnecessaries, although much more was offered by Earnscliff out of\ncharity, and by his more superstitious neighbours from other motives.\nThe benefits of these last he repaid by advice, when consulted (as at\nlength he slowly was) on their diseases, or those of their cattle. He\noften furnished them with medicines also, and seemed possessed, not only\nof such as were the produce of the country, but of foreign drugs.\nHe gave these persons to understand, that his name was Elshender the\nRecluse; but his popular epithet soon came to be Canny Elshie, or the\nWise Wight of Mucklestane-Moor. Some extended their queries beyond their\nbodily complaints, and requested advice upon other matters, which he\ndelivered with an oracular shrewdness that greatly confirmed the opinion\nof his possessing preternatural skill. The querists usually left some\noffering upon a stone, at a distance from his dwelling; if it was money,\nor any article which did not suit him to accept, he either threw it\naway, or suffered it to remain where it was without making use of it.\nOn all occasions his manners were rude and unsocial; and his words, in\nnumber, just sufficient to express his meaning as briefly as possible,\nand he shunned all communication that went a syllable beyond the matter\nin hand. When winter had passed away, and his garden began to afford\nhim herbs and vegetables, he confined himself almost entirely to those\narticles of food. He accepted, notwithstanding, a pair of she-goats from\nEarnscliff, which fed on the moor, and supplied him with milk.\n\nWhen Earnscliff found his gift had been received, he soon afterwards\npaid the hermit a visit. The old man was seated an a broad flat stone\nnear his garden door, which was the seat of science he usually occupied\nwhen disposed to receive his patients or clients. The inside of his hut,\nand that of his garden, he kept as sacred from human intrusion as the\nnatives of Otaheite do their Morai;--apparently he would have deemed it\npolluted by the step of any human being. When he shut himself up in his\nhabitation, no entreaty could prevail upon him to make himself visible,\nor to give audience to any one whomsoever.\n\nEarnscliff had been fishing in a small river at some distance. He had\nhis rod in his hand, and his basket, filled with trout, at his shoulder.\nHe sate down upon a stone nearly opposite to the Dwarf who, familiarized\nwith his presence, took no farther notice of him than by elevating his\nhuge mis-shapen head for the purpose of staring at him, and then again\nsinking it upon his bosom, as if in profound meditation. Earnscliff\nlooked around him, and observed that the hermit had increased his\naccommodations by the construction of a shed for the reception of his\ngoats.\n\n\u0093You labour hard, Elshie,\u0094 he said, willing to lead this singular being\ninto conversation.\n\n\u0093Labour,\u0094 re-echoed the Dwarf, \u0093is the mildest evil of a lot so\nmiserable as that of mankind; better to labour like me, than sport like\nyou.\u0094\n\n\u0093I cannot defend the humanity of our ordinary rural sports, Elshie, and\nyet--\u0094\n\n\u0093And yet,\u0094 interrupted the Dwarf, \u0093they are better than your ordinary\nbusiness; better to exercise idle and wanton cruelty on mute fishes than\non your fellow-creatures. Yet why should I say so? Why should not the\nwhole human herd butt, gore, and gorge upon each other, till all are\nextirpated but one huge and over-fed Behemoth, and he, when he had\nthrottled and gnawed the bones of all his fellows--he, when his prey\nfailed him, to be roaring whole days for lack of food, and, finally,\nto die, inch by inch, of famine--it were a consummation worthy of the\nrace!\u0094\n\n\u0093Your deeds are better, Elshie, than your words,\u0094 answered Earnscliff;\n\u0093you labour to preserve the race whom your misanthropy slanders.\u0094\n\n\u0093I do; but why?--Hearken. You are one on whom I look with the least\nloathing, and I care not, if, contrary to my wont, I waste a few words\nin compassion to your infatuated blindness. If I cannot send disease\ninto families, and murrain among the herds, can I attain the same end\nso well as by prolonging the lives of those who can serve the purpose of\ndestruction as effectually?--If Alice of Bower had died in winter, would\nyoung Ruthwin have been slain for her love the last spring?--Who\nthought of penning their cattle beneath the tower when the Red Reiver of\nWestburnflat was deemed to be on his death-bed?--My draughts, my skill,\nrecovered him. And, now, who dare leave his herd upon the lea without a\nwatch, or go to bed without unchaining the sleuth-hound?\u0094\n\n\u0093I own,\u0094 answered Earnscliff; \u0093you did little good to society by the\nlast of these cures. But, to balance the evil, there is my friend\nHobbie, honest Hobbie of the Heugh-foot, your skill relieved him last\nwinter in a fever that might have cost him his life.\u0094\n\n\u0093Thus think the children of clay in their ignorance,\u0094 said: the Dwarf,\nsmiling maliciously, \u0093and thus they speak in their folly. Have you\nmarked the young cub of a wild cat that has been domesticated, how\nsportive, how playful, how gentle,--but trust him with your game, your\nlambs, your poultry, his inbred ferocity breaks forth; he gripes, tears,\nravages, and devours.\u0094\n\n\u0093Such is the animal\u0092s instinct,\u0094 answered Earnscliff; \u0093but what has that\nto do with Hobbie?\u0094\n\n\u0093It is his emblem--it is his picture,\u0094 retorted the Recluse. \u0093He is\nat present tame, quiet, and domesticated, for lack of opportunity to\nexercise his inborn propensities; but let the trumpet of war sound--let\nthe young blood-hound snuff blood, he will be as ferocious as the\nwildest of his Border ancestors that ever fired a helpless peasant\u0092s\nabode. Can you deny, that even at present he often urges you to take\nbloody revenge for an injury received when you were a boy?\u0094--Earnscliff\nstarted; the Recluse appeared not to observe his surprise, and\nproceeded--\u0093The trumpet WILL blow, the young blood-hound WILL lap blood,\nand I will laugh and say, For this I have preserved thee!\u0094 He paused,\nand continued,--\u0093Such are my cures;--their object, their purpose,\nperpetuating the mass of misery, and playing even in this desert my\npart in the general tragedy. Were YOU on your sick bed, I might, in\ncompassion, send you a cup of poison.\u0094\n\n\u0093I am much obliged to you, Elshie, and certainly shall not fail to\nconsult you, with so comfortable a hope from your assistance.\u0094\n\n\u0093Do not flatter yourself too far,\u0094 replied the Hermit, \u0093with the hope\nthat I will positively yield to the frailty of pity. Why should I snatch\na dupe, so well fitted to endure the miseries of life as you are, from\nthe wretchedness which his own visions, and the villainy of the world,\nare preparing for him? Why should I play the compassionate Indian, and,\nknocking out the brains of the captive with my tomahawk, at once spoil\nthe three days\u0092 amusement of my kindred tribe, at the very moment when\nthe brands were lighted, the pincers heated, the cauldrons boiling,\nthe knives sharpened, to tear, scorch, seethe, and scarify the intended\nvictim?\u0094\n\n\u0093A dreadful picture you present to me of life, Elshie; but I am not\ndaunted by it,\u0094 returned Earnscliff. \u0093We are sent here, in one sense, to\nbear and to suffer; but, in another, to do and to enjoy. The active day\nhas its evening of repose; even patient sufferance has its alleviations,\nwhere there is a consolatory sense of duty discharged.\u0094\n\n\u0093I spurn at the slavish and bestial doctrine,\u0094 said the Dwarf, his eyes\nkindling with insane fury,--\u0093I spurn at it, as worthy only of the beasts\nthat perish; but I will waste no more words with you.\u0094\n\nHe rose hastily; but, ere he withdrew into the hut, he added, with great\nvehemence, \u0093Yet, lest you still think my apparent benefits to\nmankind flow from the stupid and servile source, called love of our\nfellow-creatures, know, that were there a man who had annihilated my\nsoul\u0092s dearest hope--who had torn my heart to mammocks, and seared my\nbrain till it glowed like a volcano, and were that man\u0092s fortune and\nlife in my power as completely as this frail potsherd\u0094 (he snatched up\nan earthen cup which stood beside him), \u0093I would not dash him into atoms\nthus\u0094--(he flung the vessel with fury against the wall),--\u0093No!\u0094 (he\nspoke more composedly, but with the utmost bitterness), \u0093I would pamper\nhim with wealth and power to inflame his evil passions, and to fulfil\nhis evil designs; he should lack no means of vice and villainy; he\nshould be the centre of a whirlpool that itself should know neither rest\nnor peace, but boil with unceasing fury, while it wrecked every goodly\nship that approached its limits! he should be an earthquake capable\nof shaking the very land in which he dwelt, and rendering all its\ninhabitants friendless, outcast, and miserable--as I am!\u0094\n\nThe wretched being rushed into his hut as he uttered these last words,\nshutting the door with furious violence, and rapidly drawing two bolts,\none after another, as if to exclude the intrusion of any one of that\nhated race, who had thus lashed his soul to frenzy. Earnscliff left the\nmoor with mingled sensations of pity and horror, pondering what strange\nand melancholy cause could have reduced to so miserable a state of\nmind, a man whose language argued him to be of rank and education much\nsuperior to the vulgar. He was also surprised to see how much particular\ninformation a person who had lived in that country so short a time,\nand in so recluse a manner, had been able to collect respecting the\ndispositions and private affairs of the inhabitants.\n\n\u0093It is no wonder,\u0094 he said to himself, \u0093that with such extent of\ninformation, such a mode of life, so uncouth a figure, and sentiments\nso virulently misanthropic, this unfortunate should be regarded by the\nvulgar as in league with the Enemy of Mankind.\u0094\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n     The bleakest rock upon the loneliest heath\n     Feels, in its barrenness, some touch of spring;\n     And, in the April dew, or beam of May,\n     Its moss and lichen freshen and revive;\n     And thus the heart, most sear\u0092d to human pleasure,\n     Melts at the tear, joys in the smile, of woman.--BEAUMONT\n\nAs the season advanced, the weather became more genial, and the Recluse\nwas more frequently found occupying the broad flat stone in the front of\nhis mansion. As he sate there one day, about the hour of noon, a party\nof gentlemen and ladies, well mounted, and numerously attended, swept\nacross the heath at some distance from his dwelling. Dogs, hawks, and\nled-horses swelled the retinue, and the air resounded at intervals\nwith the cheer of the hunters, and the sound of horns blown by the\nattendants. The Recluse was about to retire into his mansion at\nthe sight of a train so joyous, when three young ladies, with their\nattendants, who had made a circuit, and detached themselves from their\nparty, in order to gratify their curiosity by a sight of the Wise Wight\nof Mucklestane-Moor, came suddenly up, ere he could effect his purpose.\nThe first shrieked, and put her hands before her eyes, at sight of an\nobject so unusually deformed. The second, with a hysterical giggle,\nwhich she intended should disguise her terrors, asked the Recluse,\nwhether he could tell their fortune. The third, who was best mounted,\nbest dressed, and incomparably the best-looking of the three, advanced,\nas if to cover the incivility of her companions.\n\n\u0093We have lost the right path that leads through these morasses, and our\nparty have gone forward without us,\u0094 said the young lady. \u0093Seeing you,\nfather, at the door of your house, we have turned this way to--\u0094\n\n\u0093Hush!\u0094 interrupted the Dwarf; \u0093so young, and already so artful? You\ncame--you know you came, to exult in the consciousness of your own\nyouth, wealth, and beauty, by contrasting them with age, poverty, and\ndeformity. It is a fit employment for the daughter of your father; but O\nhow unlike the child of your mother!\u0094\n\n\u0093Did you, then, know my parents, and do you know me?\u0094\n\n\u0093Yes; this is the first time you have crossed my waking eyes, but I have\nseen you in my dreams.\u0094\n\n\u0093Your dreams?\u0094\n\n\u0093Ay, Isabel Vere. What hast thou, or thine, to do with my waking\nthoughts?\u0094\n\n\u0093Your waking thoughts, sir,\u0094 said the second of Miss Vere\u0092s companions,\nwith a sort of mock gravity, \u0093are fixed, doubtless, upon wisdom; folly\ncan only intrude on your sleeping moments.\u0094\n\n\u0093Over thine,\u0094 retorted the Dwarf, more splenetically than became a\nphilosopher or hermit, \u0093folly exercises an unlimited empire, asleep or\nawake.\u0094\n\n\u0093Lord bless us!\u0094 said the lady, \u0093he\u0092s a prophet, sure enough.\u0094\n\n\u0093As surely,\u0094 continued the Recluse, \u0093as thou art a woman.--A woman!--I\nshould have said a lady--a fine lady. You asked me to tell your\nfortune--it is a simple one; an endless chase through life after follies\nnot worth catching, and, when caught, successively thrown away--a chase,\npursued from the days of tottering infancy to those of old age upon his\ncrutches. Toys and merry-makings in childhood--love and its absurdities\nin youth--spadille and basto in age, shall succeed each other as\nobjects of pursuit--flowers and butterflies in spring--butterflies\nand thistle-down in summer--withered leaves in autumn and winter--all\npursued, all caught, all flung aside.--Stand apart; your fortune is\nsaid.\u0094\n\n\u0093All CAUGHT, however,\u0094 retorted the laughing fair one, who was a cousin\nof Miss Vere\u0092s; \u0093that\u0092s something, Nancy,\u0094 she continued, turning to\nthe timid damsel who had first approached the Dwarf; \u0093will you ask your\nfortune?\u0094\n\n\u0093Not for worlds,\u0094 said she, drawing back; \u0093I have heard enough of\nyours.\u0094\n\n\u0093Well, then,\u0094 said Miss Ilderton, offering money to the Dwarf, \u0093I\u0092ll pay\nfor mine, as if it were spoken by an oracle to a princess.\u0094\n\n\u0093Truth,\u0094 said the Soothsayer, \u0093can neither be bought nor sold;\u0094 and he\npushed back her proffered offering with morose disdain.\n\n\u0093Well, then,\u0094 said the lady, \u0093I\u0092ll keep my money, Mr. Elshender, to\nassist me in the chase I am to pursue.\u0094\n\n\u0093You will need it,\u0094 replied the cynic; \u0093without it, few pursue\nsuccessfully, and fewer are themselves pursued.--Stop!\u0094 he said to Miss\nVere, as her companions moved off, \u0093With you I have more to say.\nYou have what your companions would wish to have, or be thought to\nhave,--beauty, wealth, station, accomplishments.\u0094\n\n\u0093Forgive my following my companions, father; I am proof both to flattery\nand fortune-telling.\u0094\n\n\u0093Stay,\u0094 continued the Dwarf, with his hand on her horse\u0092s rein, \u0093I am\nno common soothsayer, and I am no flatterer. All the advantages I\nhave detailed, all and each of them have their corresponding\nevils--unsuccessful love, crossed affections, the gloom of a convent,\nor an odious alliance. I, who wish ill to all mankind, cannot wish more\nevil to you, so much is your course of life crossed by it.\u0094\n\n\u0093And if it be, father, let me enjoy the readiest solace of adversity\nwhile prosperity is in my power. You are old; you are poor; your\nhabitation is far from human aid, were you ill, or in want; your\nsituation, in many respects, exposes you to the suspicions of the\nvulgar, which are too apt to break out into actions of brutality. Let\nme think I have mended the lot of one human being! Accept of such\nassistance as I have power to offer; do this for my sake, if not for\nyour own, that when these evils arise, which you prophesy perhaps too\ntruly, I may not have to reflect, that the hours of my happier time have\nbeen passed altogether in vain.\u0094\n\nThe old man answered with a broken voice, and almost without addressing\nhimself to the young lady,--\n\n\u0093Yes, \u0091tis thus thou shouldst think--\u0091tis thus thou shouldst speak,\nif ever human speech and thought kept touch with each other! They do\nnot--they do not--Alas! they cannot. And yet--wait here an instant--stir\nnot till my return.\u0094 He went to his little garden, and returned with a\nhalf-blown rose. \u0093Thou hast made me shed a tear, the first which has\nwet my eyelids for many a year; for that good deed receive this token\nof gratitude. It is but a common rose; preserve it, however, and do not\npart with it. Come to me in your hour of adversity. Show me that rose,\nor but one leaf of it, were it withered as my heart is--if it should be\nin my fiercest and wildest movements of rage against a hateful world,\nstill it will recall gentler thoughts to my bosom, and perhaps afford\nhappier prospects to thine. But no message,\u0094 he exclaimed, rising\ninto his usual mood of misanthropy,--\u0093no message--no go-between! Come\nthyself; and the heart and the doors that are shut against every other\nearthly being, shall open to thee and to thy sorrows. And now pass on.\u0094\n\nHe let go the bridle-rein, and the young lady rode on, after expressing\nher thanks to this singular being, as well as her surprise at the\nextraordinary nature of his address would permit, often turning back to\nlook at the Dwarf, who still remained at the door of his habitation,\nand watched her progress over the moor towards her father\u0092s castle of\nEllieslaw, until the brow of the hill hid the party from his sight.\n\nThe ladies, meantime, jested with Miss Vere on the strange interview\nthey had just had with the far-famed wizard of the Moor. \u0093Isabella has\nall the luck at home and abroad! Her hawk strikes down the black-cock;\nher eyes wound the gallant; no chance for her poor companions and\nkinswomen; even the conjuror cannot escape the force of her charms. You\nshould, in compassion, cease to be such an engrosser, my dear Isabel, or\nat least set up shop, and sell off all the goods you do not mean to keep\nfor your own use.\u0094\n\n\u0093You shall have them all,\u0094 replied Miss Vere, \u0093and the conjuror to boot,\nat a very easy rate.\u0094\n\n\u0093No! Nancy shall have the conjuror,\u0094 said Miss Ilderton, \u0093to supply\ndeficiencies; she\u0092s not quite a witch herself, you know.\u0094\n\n\u0093Lord, sister,\u0094 answered the younger Miss Ilderton, \u0093what could I do\nwith so frightful a monster? I kept my eyes shut, after once glancing at\nhim; and, I protest, I thought I saw him still, though I winked as close\nas ever I could.\u0094\n\n\u0093That\u0092s a pity,\u0094 said her sister; \u0093ever while you live, Nancy, choose an\nadmirer whose faults can be hid by winking at them.--Well, then, I must\ntake him myself, I suppose, and put him into mamma\u0092s Japan cabinet,\nin order to show that Scotland can produce a specimen of mortal clay\nmoulded into a form ten thousand times uglier than the imaginations of\nCanton and Pekin, fertile as they are in monsters, have immortalized in\nporcelain.\u0094\n\n\u0093There is something,\u0094 said Miss Vere, \u0093so melancholy in the situation of\nthis poor man, that I cannot enter into your mirth, Lucy, so readily as\nusual. If he has no resources, how is he to exist in this waste country,\nliving, as he does, at such a distance from mankind? and if he has the\nmeans of securing occasional assistance, will not the very suspicion\nthat he is possessed of them, expose him to plunder and assassination by\nsome of our unsettled neighbours?\u0094\n\n\u0093But you forget that they say he is a warlock,\u0094 said Nancy Ilderton.\n\n\u0093And, if his magic diabolical should fail him,\u0094 rejoined her sister, \u0093I\nwould have him trust to his magic natural, and thrust his enormous head,\nand most preternatural visage, out at his door or window, full in view\nof the assailants. The boldest robber that ever rode would hardly bide a\nsecond glance of him. Well, I wish I had the use of that Gorgon head of\nhis for only one half hour.\u0094\n\n\u0093For what purpose, Lucy?\u0094 said Miss Vere.\n\n\u0093O! I would frighten out of the castle that dark, stiff, and stately Sir\nFrederick Langley, that is so great a favourite with your father, and so\nlittle a favourite of yours. I protest I shall be obliged to the Wizard\nas long as I live, if it were only for the half hour\u0092s relief from that\nman\u0092s company which we have gained by deviating from the party to visit\nElshie.\u0094\n\n\u0093What would you say, then,\u0094 said Miss Vere, in a low tone, so as not to\nbe heard by the younger sister, who rode before them, the narrow path\nnot admitting of their moving all three abreast,--\u0093What would you say,\nmy dearest Lucy, if it were proposed to you to endure his company for\nlife?\u0094\n\n\u0093Say? I would say, NO, NO, NO, three times, each louder than another,\ntill they should hear me at Carlisle.\u0094\n\n\u0093And Sir Frederick would say then, nineteen nay-says are half a grant.\u0094\n\n\u0093That,\u0094 replied Miss Lucy, \u0093depends entirely on the manner in which the\nnay-says are said. Mine should have not one grain of concession in them,\nI promise you.\u0094\n\n\u0093But if your father,\u0094 said Miss Vere, \u0093were to say,--Thus do, or--\u0094\n\n\u0093I would stand to the consequences of his OR, were he the most cruel\nfather that ever was recorded in romance, to fill up the alternative.\u0094\n\n\u0093And what if he threatened you with a catholic aunt, an abbess, and a\ncloister?\u0094\n\n\u0093Then,\u0094 said Miss Ilderton, \u0093I would threaten him with a protestant\nson-in-law, and be glad of an opportunity to disobey him for conscience\u0092\nsake. And now that Nancy is out of hearing, let me really say, I\nthink you would be excusable before God and man for resisting this\npreposterous match by every means in your power. A proud, dark,\nambitious man; a caballer against the state; infamous for his avarice\nand severity; a bad son, a bad brother, unkind and ungenerous to all his\nrelatives--Isabel, I would die rather than have him.\u0094\n\n\u0093Don\u0092t let my father hear you give me such advice,\u0094 said Miss Vere, \u0093or\nadieu, my dear Lucy, to Ellieslaw Castle.\u0094\n\n\u0093And adieu to Ellieslaw Castle, with all my heart,\u0094 said her friend, \u0093if\nI once saw you fairly out of it, and settled under some kinder protector\nthan he whom nature has given you. O, if my poor father had been in his\nformer health, how gladly would he have received and sheltered you, till\nthis ridiculous and cruel persecution were blown over!\u0094\n\n\u0093Would to God it had been so, my dear Lucy!\u0094 answered Isabella; \u0093but\nI fear, that, in your father\u0092s weak state of health, he would be\naltogether unable to protect me against the means which would be\nimmediately used for reclaiming the poor fugitive.\u0094\n\n\u0093I fear so indeed,\u0094 replied Miss Ilderton; \u0093but we will consider and\ndevise something. Now that your father and his guests seem so deeply\nengaged in some mysterious plot, to judge from the passing and returning\nof messages, from the strange faces which appear and disappear without\nbeing announced by their names, from the collecting and cleaning of\narms, and the anxious gloom and bustle which seem to agitate every male\nin the castle, it may not be impossible for us (always in case matters\nbe driven to extremity) to shape out some little supplemental conspiracy\nof our own. I hope the gentlemen have not kept all the policy to\nthemselves; and there is one associate that I would gladly admit to our\ncounsel.\u0094\n\n\u0093Not Nancy?\u0094\n\n\u0093O, no!\u0094 said Miss Ilderton; \u0093Nancy, though an excellent good girl,\nand fondly attached to you, would make a dull conspirator--as dull as\nRenault and all the other subordinate plotters in VENICE PRESERVED. No;\nthis is a Jaffier, or Pierre, if you like the character better; and yet\nthough I know I shall please you, I am afraid to mention his name to\nyou, lest I vex you at the same time. Can you not guess? Something\nabout an eagle and a rock--it does not begin with eagle in English, but\nsomething very like it in Scotch.\u0094\n\n\u0093You cannot mean young Earnscliff, Lucy?\u0094 said Miss Vere, blushing\ndeeply.\n\n\u0093And whom else should I mean,\u0094 said Lucy. \u0093Jaffiers and Pierres are very\nscarce in this country, I take it, though one could find Renaults and\nBedamars enow.\u0094\n\n\u0093How call you talk so wildly, Lucy? Your plays and romances have\npositively turned your brain. You know, that, independent of my father\u0092s\nconsent, without which I never will marry any one, and which, in the\ncase you point at, would never be granted; independent, too, of our\nknowing nothing of young Earnscliff\u0092s inclinations, but by your own\nvivid conjectures and fancies--besides all this, there is the fatal\nbrawl!\u0094\n\n\u0093When his father was killed?\u0094 said Lucy. \u0093But that was very long ago;\nand I hope we have outlived the time of bloody feud, when a quarrel was\ncarried down between two families from father to son, like a Spanish\ngame at chess, and a murder or two committed in every generation, just\nto keep the matter from going to sleep. We do with our quarrels nowadays\nas with our clothes; cut them out for ourselves, and wear them out in\nour own day, and should no more think of resenting our fathers\u0092 feuds,\nthan of wearing their slashed doublets and trunk-hose.\u0094\n\n\u0093You treat this far too lightly, Lucy,\u0094 answered Miss Vere.\n\n\u0093Not a bit, my dear Isabella,\u0094 said Lucy. \u0093Consider, your father, though\npresent in the unhappy affray, is never supposed to have struck the\nfatal blow; besides, in former times, in case of mutual slaughter\nbetween clans, subsequent alliances were so far from being excluded,\nthat the hand of a daughter or a sister was the most frequent gage of\nreconciliation. You laugh at my skill in romance; but, I assure you,\nshould your history be written, like that of many a less distressed and\nless deserving heroine, the well-judging reader would set you down for\nthe lady and the love of Earnscliff; from the very obstacle which you\nsuppose so insurmountable.\u0094\n\n\u0093But these are not the days of romance, but of sad reality, for there\nstands the castle of Ellieslaw.\u0094\n\n\u0093And there stands Sir Frederick Langley at the gate, waiting to assist\nthe ladies from their palfreys. I would as lief touch a toad; I will\ndisappoint him, and take old Horsington the groom for my master of the\nhorse.\u0094\n\nSo saying, the lively young lady switched her palfrey forward, and\npassing Sir Frederick with a familiar nod as he stood ready to take\nher horse\u0092s rein, she cantered on, and jumped into the arms of the old\ngroom. Fain would Isabella have done the same had she dared; but her\nfather stood near, displeasure already darkening on a countenance\npeculiarly qualified to express the harsher passions, and she was\ncompelled to receive the unwelcome assiduities of her detested suitor.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n     Let not us that are squires of the night\u0092s body be called\n     thieves of the day\u0092s booty; let us be Diana\u0092s foresters,\n     gentlemen of the shade, minions of the moon.\n     --HENRY THE FOURTH, PART I.\n\nThe Solitary had consumed the remainder of that day in which he had the\ninterview with the young ladies, within the precincts of his garden.\nEvening again found him seated on his favourite stone. The sun setting\nred, and among seas of rolling clouds, threw a gloomy lustre over the\nmoor, and gave a deeper purple to the broad outline of heathy mountains\nwhich surrounded this desolate spot. The Dwarf sate watching the clouds\nas they lowered above each other in masses of conglomerated vapours,\nand, as a strong lurid beam of the sinking luminary darted full on his\nsolitary and uncouth figure, he might well have seemed the demon of\nthe storm which was gathering, or some gnome summoned forth from the\nrecesses of the earth by the subterranean signals of its approach. As he\nsate thus, with his dark eye turned towards the scowling and blackening\nheaven, a horseman rode rapidly up to him, and stopping, as if to\nlet his horse breathe for an instant, made a sort of obeisance to the\nanchoret, with an air betwixt effrontery and embarrassment.\n\nThe figure of the rider was thin, tall, and slender, but remarkably\nathletic, bony, and sinewy; like one who had all his life followed those\nviolent exercises which prevent the human form from increasing in bulk,\nwhile they harden and confirm by habit its muscular powers. His face,\nsharp-featured, sun-burnt, and freckled, had a sinister expression of\nviolence, impudence, and cunning, each of which seemed alternately to\npredominate over the others. Sandy-coloured hair, and reddish eyebrows,\nfrom under which looked forth his sharp grey eyes, completed the\ninauspicious outline of the horseman\u0092s physiognomy. He had pistols in\nhis holsters, and another pair peeped from his belt, though he had taken\nsome pains to conceal them by buttoning his doublet. He wore a rusted\nsteel head piece; a buff jacket of rather an antique cast; gloves, of\nwhich that for the right hand was covered with small scales of iron,\nlike an ancient gauntlet; and a long broadsword completed his equipage.\n\n\u0093So,\u0094 said the Dwarf, \u0093rapine and murder once more on horseback.\u0094\n\n\u0093On horseback?\u0094 said the bandit; \u0093ay, ay, Elshie, your leech-craft has\nset me on the bonny bay again.\u0094\n\n\u0093And all those promises of amendment which you made during your illness\nforgotten?\u0094 continued Elshender.\n\n\u0093All clear away, with the water-saps and panada,\u0094 returned the unabashed\nconvalescent. \u0093Ye ken, Elshie, for they say ye are weel acquent wi\u0092 the\ngentleman,\n\n     \u0093When the devil was sick, the devil a monk would be,\n     When the devil was well, the devil a monk was he.\u0094\n\n\u0093Thou say\u0092st true,\u0094 said the Solitary; \u0093as well divide a wolf from his\nappetite for carnage, or a raven from her scent of slaughter, as thee\nfrom thy accursed propensities.\u0094\n\n\u0093Why, what would you have me to do? It\u0092s born with me--lies in my\nvery blude and bane. Why, man, the lads of Westburnflat, for ten lang\ndescents, have been reivers and lifters. They have all drunk hard, lived\nhigh, taking deep revenge for light offence, and never wanted gear for\nthe winning.\u0094\n\n\u0093Right; and thou art as thorough-bred a wolf,\u0094 said the Dwarf, \u0093as ever\nleapt a lamb-fold at night. On what hell\u0092s errand art thou bound now?\u0094\n\n\u0093Can your skill not guess?\u0094\n\n\u0093Thus far I know,\u0094 said the Dwarf, \u0093that thy purpose is bad, thy deed\nwill be worse, and the issue worst of all.\u0094\n\n\u0093And you like me the better for it, Father Elshie, eh?\u0094 said\nWestburnflat; \u0093you always said you did.\u0094\n\n\u0093I have cause to like all,\u0094 answered the Solitary, \u0093that are scourges to\ntheir fellow-creatures, and thou art a bloody one.\u0094\n\n\u0093No--I say not guilty to that--lever bluidy unless there\u0092s resistance,\nand that sets a man\u0092s bristles up, ye ken. And this is nae great matter,\nafter a\u0092; just to cut the comb of a young cock that has been crawing a\nlittle ower crousely.\u0094\n\n\u0093Not young Earnscliff?\u0094 said the Solitary, with some emotion.\n\n\u0093No; not young Earnscliff--not young Earnscliff YET; but his time may\ncome, if he will not take warning, and get him back to the burrow-town\nthat he\u0092s fit for, and no keep skelping about here, destroying the\nfew deer that are left in the country, and pretending to act as a\nmagistrate, and writing letters to the great folk at Auld Reekie, about\nthe disturbed state of the land. Let him take care o\u0092 himsell.\u0094\n\n\u0093Then it must be Hobbie of the Heugh-foot,\u0094 said Elshie. \u0093What harm has\nthe lad done you?\u0094\n\n\u0093Harm! nae great harm; but I hear he says I staid away from the Ba\u0092spiel\non Fastern\u0092s E\u0092en, for fear of him; and it was only for fear of the\nCountry Keeper, for there was a warrant against me. I\u0092ll stand Hobbie\u0092s\nfeud, and a\u0092 his clan\u0092s. But it\u0092s not so much for that, as to gie him\na lesson not to let his tongue gallop ower freely about his betters. I\ntrow he will hae lost the best pen-feather o\u0092 his wing before to-morrow\nmorning.--Farewell, Elshie; there\u0092s some canny boys waiting for me down\namang the shaws, owerby; I will see you as I come back, and bring ye a\nblithe tale in return for your leech-craft.\u0094\n\nEre the Dwarf could collect himself to reply, the Reiver of Westburnflat\nset spurs to his horse. The animal, starting at one of the stones which\nlay scattered about, flew from the path. The rider exercised his spurs\nwithout moderation or mercy. The horse became furious, reared, kicked,\nplunged, and bolted like a deer, with all his four feet off the ground\nat once. It was in vain; the unrelenting rider sate as if he had been\na part of the horse which he bestrode; and, after a short but furious\ncontest, compelled the subdued animal to proceed upon the path at a rate\nwhich soon carried him out of sight of the Solitary.\n\n\u0093That villain,\u0094 exclaimed the Dwarf,--\u0093that cool-blooded, hardened,\nunrelenting ruffian,--that wretch, whose every thought is infected with\ncrimes,--has thewes and sinews, limbs, strength, and activity enough, to\ncompel a nobler animal than himself to carry him to the place where he\nis to perpetrate his wickedness; while I, had I the weakness to wish to\nput his wretched victim on his guard, and to save the helpless family,\nwould see my good intentions frustrated by the decrepitude which chains\nme to the spot.--Why should I wish it were otherwise? What have my\nscreech-owl voice, my hideous form, and my mis-shapen features, to\ndo with the fairer workmanship of nature? Do not men receive even my\nbenefits with shrinking horror and ill-suppressed disgust? And why\nshould I interest myself in a race which accounts me a prodigy and an\noutcast, and which has treated me as such? No; by all the ingratitude\nwhich I have reaped--by all the wrongs which I have sustained--by my\nimprisonment, my stripes, my chains, I will wrestle down my feelings of\nrebellious humanity! I will not be the fool I have been, to swerve from\nmy principles whenever there was an appeal, forsooth, to my feelings; as\nif I, towards whom none show sympathy, ought to have sympathy with any\none. Let Destiny drive forth her scythed car through the overwhelmed and\ntrembling mass of humanity! Shall I be the idiot to throw this decrepit\nform, this mis-shapen lump of mortality, under her wheels, that the\nDwarf, the Wizard, the Hunchback, may save from destruction some fair\nform or some active frame, and all the world clap their hands at the\nexchange? No, never!--And yet this Elliot--this Hobbie, so young and\ngallant, so frank, so--I will think of it no longer. I cannot aid him if\nI would, and I am resolved--firmly resolved, that I would not aid him,\nif a wish were the pledge of his safety!\u0094\n\nHaving thus ended his soliloquy, he retreated into his hut for shelter\nfrom the storm which was fast approaching, and now began to burst in\nlarge and heavy drops of rain. The last rays of the sun now disappeared\nentirely, and two or three claps of distant thunder followed each other\nat brief intervals, echoing and re-echoing among the range of heathy\nfells like the sound of a distant engagement.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n     Proud bird of the mountain, thy plume shall be torn!--\n     .  .  .  .\n     Return to thy dwelling; all lonely, return;\n     For the blackness of ashes shall mark where it stood,\n     And a wild mother scream o\u0092er her famishing brood.--CAMPBELL.\n\nThe night continued sullen and stormy; but morning rose as if refreshed\nby the rains. Even the Mucklestane-Moor, with its broad bleak swells of\nbarren grounds, interspersed with marshy pools of water, seemed to smile\nunder the serene influence of the sky, just as good-humour can spread\na certain inexpressible charm over the plainest human countenance.\nThe heath was in its thickest and deepest bloom. The bees, which the\nSolitary had added to his rural establishment, were abroad and on the\nwing, and filled the air with the murmurs of their industry. As the old\nman crept out of his little hut, his two she-goats came to meet him, and\nlicked his hands in gratitude for the vegetables with which he supplied\nthem from his garden. \u0093You, at least,\u0094 he said--\u0093you, at least, see no\ndifferences in form which can alter your feelings to a benefactor--to\nyou, the finest shape that ever statuary moulded would be an object\nof indifference or of alarm, should it present itself instead of the\nmis-shapen trunk to whose services you are accustomed. While I was in\nthe world, did I ever meet with such a return of gratitude? No; the\ndomestic whom I had bred from infancy made mouths at me as he stood\nbehind my chair; the friend whom I had supported with my fortune, and\nfor whose sake I had even stained--(he stopped with a strong convulsive\nshudder), even he thought me more fit for the society of lunatics--for\ntheir disgraceful restraints--for their cruel privations, than for\ncommunication with the rest of humanity. Hubert alone--and Hubert too\nwill one day abandon me. All are of a piece, one mass of wickedness,\nselfishness, and ingratitude--wretches, who sin even in their devotions;\nand of such hardness of heart, that they do not, without hypocrisy, even\nthank the Deity himself for his warm sun and pure air.\u0094\n\nAs he was plunged in these gloomy soliloquies, he heard the tramp of a\nhorse on the other side of his enclosure, and a strong clear bass voice\nsinging with the liveliness inspired by a light heart,\n\n     Canny Hobbie Elliot, canny Hobbie now,\n     Canny Hobbie Elliot, I\u0092se gang alang wi\u0092 you.\n\nAt the same moment, a large deer greyhound sprung over the hermit\u0092s\nfence. It is well known to the sportsmen in these wilds, that the\nappearance and scent of the goat so much resemble those of their usual\nobjects of chase, that the best-broke greyhounds will sometimes fly upon\nthem. The dog in question instantly pulled down and throttled one of the\nhermit\u0092s she-goats, while Hobbie Elliot, who came up, and jumped from\nhis horse for the purpose, was unable to extricate the harmless animal\nfrom the fangs of his attendant until it was expiring. The Dwarf eyed,\nfor a few moments, the convulsive starts of his dying favourite, until\nthe poor goat stretched out her limbs with the twitches and shivering\nfit of the last agony. He then started into an access of frenzy, and\nunsheathing a long sharp knife, or dagger, which he wore under his\ncoat, he was about to launch it at the dog, when Hobbie, perceiving his\npurpose, interposed, and caught hold of his hand, exclaiming, \u0093Let a be\nthe hound, man--let a be the hound!--Na, na, Killbuck maunna be guided\nthat gate, neither.\u0094\n\nThe Dwarf turned his rage on the young farmer; and, by a sudden effort,\nfar more powerful than Hobbie expected from such a person, freed his\nwrist from his grasp, and offered the dagger at his heart. All this was\ndone in the twinkling of an eye, and the incensed Recluse might have\ncompleted his vengeance by plunging the weapon in Elliot\u0092s bosom, had he\nnot been checked by an internal impulse which made him hurl the knife to\na distance.\n\n\u0093No,\u0094 he exclaimed, as he thus voluntarily deprived himself of the means\nof gratifying his rage; \u0093not again--not again!\u0094\n\nHobbie retreated a step or two in great surprise, discomposure, and\ndisdain, at having been placed in such danger by an object apparently so\ncontemptible.\n\n\u0093The deil\u0092s in the body for strength and bitterness!\u0094 were the first\nwords that escaped him, which he followed up with an apology for the\naccident that had given rise to their disagreement. \u0093I am no justifying\nKillbuck a\u0092thegither neither, and I am sure it is as vexing to me as to\nyou, Elshie, that the mischance should hae happened; but I\u0092ll send you\ntwa goats and twa fat gimmers, man, to make a\u0092 straight again. A wise\nman like you shouldna bear malice against a poor dumb thing; ye see that\na goat\u0092s like first-cousin to a deer, sae he acted but according to his\nnature after a\u0092. Had it been a pet-lamb, there wad hae been mair to be\nsaid. Ye suld keep sheep, Elshie, and no goats, where there\u0092s sae mony\ndeerhounds about--but I\u0092ll send ye baith.\u0094\n\n\u0093Wretch!\u0094 said the Hermit, \u0093your cruelty has destroyed one of the only\ncreatures in existence that would look on me with kindness!\u0094\n\n\u0093Dear Elshie,\u0094 answered Hobbie, \u0093I\u0092m wae ye suld hae cause to say sae;\nI\u0092m sure it wasna wi\u0092 my will. And yet, it\u0092s true, I should hae minded\nyour goats, and coupled up the dogs. I\u0092m sure I would rather they had\nworried the primest wether in my faulds.--Come, man, forget and forgie.\nI\u0092m e\u0092en as vexed as ye can be--But I am a bridegroom, ye see, and that\nputs a\u0092 things out o\u0092 my head, I think. There\u0092s the marriage-dinner, or\ngude part o\u0092t, that my twa brithers are bringing on a sled round by the\nRiders\u0092 Slack, three goodly bucks as ever ran on Dallomlea, as the sang\nsays; they couldna come the straight road for the saft grund. I wad send\nye a bit venison, but ye wadna take it weel maybe, for Killbuck catched\nit.\u0094\n\nDuring this long speech, in which the good-natured Borderer endeavoured\nto propitiate the offended Dwarf by every argument he could think of,\nhe heard him with his eyes bent on the ground, as if in the deepest\nmeditation, and at length broke forth--\u0093Nature?--yes! it is indeed in\nthe usual beaten path of Nature. The strong gripe and throttle the weak;\nthe rich depress and despoil the needy; the happy (those who are idiots\nenough to think themselves happy) insult the misery and diminish the\nconsolation of the wretched.--Go hence, thou who hast contrived to give\nan additional pang to the most miserable of human beings--thou who hast\ndeprived me of what I half considered as a source of comfort. Go hence,\nand enjoy the happiness prepared for thee at home!\u0094\n\n\u0093Never stir,\u0094 said Hobbie, \u0093if I wadna take you wi\u0092 me, man, if ye wad\nbut say it wad divert ye to be at the bridal on Monday. There will be\na hundred strapping Elliots to ride the brouze--the like\u0092s no been seen\nsin\u0092 the days of auld Martin of the Preakin-tower--I wad send the sled\nfor ye wi\u0092 a canny powny.\u0094\n\n\u0093Is it to me you propose once more to mix in the society of the common\nherd?\u0094 said the Recluse, with an air of deep disgust.\n\n\u0093Commons!\u0094 retorted Hobbie, \u0093nae siccan commons neither; the Elliots hae\nbeen lang kend a gentle race.\u0094\n\n\u0093Hence! begone!\u0094 reiterated the Dwarf; \u0093may the same evil luck attend\nthee that thou hast left behind with me! If I go not with you myself,\nsee if you can escape what my attendants, Wrath and Misery, have brought\nto thy threshold before thee.\u0094\n\n\u0093I wish ye wadna speak that gate,\u0094 said Hobbie. \u0093Ye ken yoursell,\nElshie, naebody judges you to be ower canny; now, I\u0092ll tell ye just ae\nword for a\u0092--ye hae spoken as muckle as wussing ill to me and mine; now,\nif ony mischance happen to Grace, which God forbid, or to mysell; or to\nthe poor dumb tyke; or if I be skaithed and injured in body, gudes, or\ngear, I\u0092ll no forget wha it is that it\u0092s owing to.\u0094\n\n\u0093Out, hind!\u0094 exclaimed the Dwarf; \u0093home! home to your dwelling, and\nthink on me when you find what has befallen there.\u0094\n\n\u0093Aweel, aweel,\u0094 said Hobbie, mounting his horse, \u0093it serves naething to\nstrive wi\u0092 cripples,--they are aye cankered; but I\u0092ll just tell ye\nae thing, neighbour, that if things be otherwise than weel wi\u0092 Grace\nArmstrong, I\u0092se gie you a scouther if there be a tar-barrel in the five\nparishes.\u0094\n\nSo saying, he rode off; and Elshie, after looking at him with a scornful\nand indignant laugh, took spade and mattock, and occupied himself in\ndigging a grave for his deceased favourite.\n\nA low whistle, and the words, \u0093Hisht, Elshie, hisht!\u0094 disturbed him\nin this melancholy occupation. He looked up, and the Red Reiver of\nWestburnflat was before him. Like Banquo\u0092s murderer, there was blood on\nhis face, as well as upon the rowels of his spurs and the sides of his\nover-ridden horse.\n\n\u0093How now, ruffian!\u0094 demanded the Dwarf, \u0093is thy job chared?\u0094\n\n\u0093Ay, ay, doubt not that, Elshie,\u0094 answered the freebooter; \u0093When I\nride, my foes may moan. They have had mair light than comfort at the\nHeugh-foot this morning; there\u0092s a toom byre and a wide, and a wail and\na cry for the bonny bride.\u0094\n\n\u0093The bride?\u0094\n\n\u0093Ay; Charlie Cheat-the-Woodie, as we ca\u0092 him, that\u0092s Charlie Foster of\nTinning Beck, has promised to keep her in Cumberland till the blast blaw\nby. She saw me, and kend me in the splore, for the mask fell frae my\nface for a blink. I am thinking it wad concern my safety if she were\nto come back here, for there\u0092s mony o\u0092 the Elliots, and they band weel\nthegither for right or wrang. Now, what I chiefly come to ask your rede\nin, is how to make her sure?\u0094\n\n\u0093Wouldst thou murder her, then?\u0094\n\n\u0093Umph! no, no; that I would not do, if I could help it. But they say\nthey can whiles get folk cannily away to the plantations from some of\nthe outports, and something to boot for them that brings a bonny wench.\nThey\u0092re wanted beyond seas thae female cattle, and they\u0092re no that\nscarce here. But I think o\u0092 doing better for this lassie. There\u0092s a\nleddy, that, unless she be a\u0092 the better bairn, is to be sent to foreign\nparts whether she will or no; now, I think of sending Grace to wait on\nher--she\u0092s a bonny lassie. Hobbie will hae a merry morning when he comes\nhame, and misses baith bride and gear.\u0094\n\n\u0093Ay; and do you not pity him?\u0094 said the Recluse.\n\n\u0093Wad he pity me were I gaeing up the Castle hill at Jeddart? [ The\nplace of execution at that ancient burgh, where many of Westburnflat\u0092s\nprofession have made their final exit.] And yet I rue something for the\nbit lassie; but he\u0092ll get anither, and little skaith dune--ane is as\ngude as anither. And now, you that like to hear o\u0092 splores, heard ye\never o\u0092 a better ane than I hae had this morning?\u0094\n\n\u0093Air, ocean, and fire,\u0094 said the Dwarf, speaking to himself, \u0093the\nearthquake, the tempest, the volcano, are all mild and moderate,\ncompared to the wrath of man. And what is this fellow, but one more\nskilled than others in executing the end of his existence?--Hear me,\nfelon, go again where I before sent thee.\u0094\n\n\u0093To the Steward?\u0094\n\n\u0093Ay; and tell him, Elshender the Recluse commands him to give thee gold.\nBut, hear me, let the maiden be discharged free and uninjured; return\nher to her friends, and let her swear not to discover thy villainy.\u0094\n\n\u0093Swear,\u0094 said Westburnflat; \u0093but what if she break her aith? Women are\nnot famous for keeping their plight. A wise man like you should ken\nthat.--And uninjured--wha kens what may happen were she to be left lang\nat Tinning-Beck? Charlie Cheat-the-Woodie is a rough customer. But if\nthe gold could be made up to twenty pieces, I think I could ensure her\nbeing wi\u0092 her friends within the twenty-four hours.\u0094\n\nThe Dwarf took his tablets from his pocket, marked a line on them, and\ntore out the leaf. \u0093There,\u0094 he said, giving the robber the leaf--\u0093But,\nmark me; thou knowest I am not to be fooled by thy treachery; if thou\ndarest to disobey my directions, thy wretched life, be sure, shall\nanswer it.\u0094\n\n\u0093I know,\u0094 said the fellow, looking down, \u0093that you have power on earth,\nhowever you came by it; you can do what nae other man can do, baith by\nphysic and foresight; and the gold is shelled down when ye command, as\nfast as I have seen the ash-keys fall in a frosty morning in October. I\nwill not disobey you.\u0094\n\n\u0093Begone, then, and relieve me of thy hateful presence.\u0094\n\nThe robber set spurs to his horse, and rode off without reply.\n\nHobbie Elliot had, in the meanwhile, pursued his journey rapidly,\nharassed by those oppressive and indistinct fears that all was not\nright, which men usually term a presentiment of misfortune. Ere he\nreached the top of the bank from which he could look down on his own\nhabitation, he was met by his nurse, a person then of great consequence\nin all families in Scotland, whether of the higher or middling classes.\nThe connexion between them and their foster-children was considered a\ntie far too dearly intimate to be broken; and it usually happened, in\nthe course of years, that the nurse became a resident in the family\nof her foster-son, assisting in the domestic duties, and receiving all\nmarks of attention and regard from the heads of the family. So soon\nas Hobbie recognised the figure of Annaple, in her red cloak and black\nhood, he could not help exclaiming to himself, \u0093What ill luck can\nhae brought the auld nurse sae far frae hame, her that never stirs a\ngun-shot frae the door-stane for ordinar?--Hout, it will just be to get\ncrane-berries, or whortle-berries, or some such stuff, out of the moss,\nto make the pies and tarts for the feast on Monday.--I cannot get the\nwords of that cankered auld cripple deil\u0092s-buckie out o\u0092 my head--the\nleast thing makes me dread some ill news.--O, Killbuck, man! were there\nnae deer and goats in the country besides, but ye behoved to gang and\nworry his creature, by a\u0092 other folk\u0092s?\u0094\n\nBy this time Annaple, with a brow like a tragic volume, had hobbled\ntowards him, and caught his horse by the bridle. The despair in her look\nwas so evident as to deprive even him of the power of asking the cause.\n\u0093O my bairn!\u0094 she cried, \u0093gang na forward--gang na forward--it\u0092s a sight\nto kill onybody, let alane thee.\u0094\n\n\u0093In God\u0092s name, what\u0092s the matter?\u0094 said the astonished horseman,\nendeavouring to extricate his bridle from the grasp of the old woman;\n\u0093for Heaven\u0092s sake, let me go and see what\u0092s the matter.\u0094\n\n\u0093Ohon! that I should have lived to see the day!--The steading\u0092s a\u0092 in\na low, and the bonny stack-yard lying in the red ashes, and the gear a\u0092\ndriven away. But gang na forward; it wad break your young heart, hinny,\nto see what my auld een hae seen this morning.\u0094\n\n\u0093And who has dared to do this? let go my bridle, Annaple--where is my\ngrandmother--my sisters?--Where is Grace Armstrong?--God!--the words of\nthe warlock are knelling in my ears!\u0094\n\nHe sprang from his horse to rid himself of Annaple\u0092s interruption, and,\nascending the hill with great speed, soon came in view of the spectacle\nwith which she had threatened him. It was indeed a heart-breaking\nsight. The habitation which he had left in its seclusion, beside the\nmountain-stream, surrounded with every evidence of rustic plenty, was\nnow a wasted and blackened ruin. From amongst the shattered and sable\nwalls the smoke continued to rise. The turf-stack, the barn-yard, the\noffices stocked with cattle, all the wealth of an upland cultivator of\nthe period, of which poor Elliot possessed no common share, had\nbeen laid waste or carried off in a single night. He stood a moment\nmotionless, and then exclaimed, \u0093I am ruined--ruined to the ground!--But\ncurse on the warld\u0092s gear--Had it not been the week before the\nbridal--But I am nae babe, to sit down and greet about it. If I can but\nfind Grace, and my grandmother, and my sisters weel, I can go to the\nwars in Flanders, as my gude-sire did, under the Bellenden banner, wi\u0092\nauld Buccleuch. At ony rate, I will keep up a heart, or they will lose\ntheirs a\u0092thegither.\u0094\n\nManfully strode Hobbie down the hill, resolved to suppress his\nown despair, and administer consolation which he did not feel. The\nneighbouring inhabitants of the dell, particularly those of his own\nname, had already assembled. The younger part were in arms and clamorous\nfor revenge, although they knew not upon whom; the elder were taking\nmeasures for the relief of the distressed family. Annaple\u0092s cottage,\nwhich was situated down the brook, at some distance from the scene of\nmischief, had been hastily adapted for the temporary accommodation\nof the old lady and her daughters, with such articles as had been\ncontributed by the neighbours, for very little was saved from the wreck.\n\n\u0093Are we to stand here a\u0092 day, sirs,\u0094 exclaimed one tall young man, \u0093and\nlook at the burnt wa\u0092s of our kinsman\u0092s house? Every wreath of the reek\nis a blast of shame upon us! Let us to horse, and take the chase.--Who\nhas the nearest bloodhound?\u0094\n\n\u0093It\u0092s young Earnscliff,\u0094 answered another; \u0093and he\u0092s been on and away\nwi\u0092 six horse lang syne, to see if he can track them.\u0094\n\n\u0093Let us follow him then, and raise the country, and mak mair help as\nwe ride, and then have at the Cumberland reivers! Take, burn, and\nslay--they that lie nearest us shall smart first.\u0094\n\n\u0093Whisht! haud your tongues, daft callants,\u0094 said an old man, \u0093ye dinna\nken what ye speak about. What! wad ye raise war atween two pacificated\ncountries?\u0094\n\n\u0093And what signifies deaving us wi\u0092 tales about our fathers,\u0094 retorted\nthe young; man, \u0093if we\u0092re to sit and see our friends\u0092 houses burnt ower\ntheir heads, and no put out hand to revenge them? Our fathers did not do\nthat, I trow?\u0094\n\n\u0093I am no saying onything against revenging Hobbie\u0092s wrang, puir chield;\nbut we maun take the law wi\u0092 us in thae days, Simon,\u0094 answered the more\nprudent elder.\n\n\u0093And besides,\u0094 said another old man, \u0093I dinna believe there\u0092s ane now\nliving that kens the lawful mode of following a fray across the Border.\nTam o\u0092 Whittram kend a\u0092 about it; but he died in the hard winter.\u0094\n\n\u0093Ay,\u0094 said a third, \u0093he was at the great gathering, when they chased as\nfar as Thirlwall; it was the year after the fight of Philiphaugh.\u0094\n\n\u0093Hout,\u0094 exclaimed another of these discording counsellors, \u0093there\u0092s nae\ngreat skill needed; just put a lighted peat on the end of a spear, or\nhayfork, or siclike, and blaw a horn, and cry the gathering-word, and\nthen it\u0092s lawful to follow gear into England, and recover it by the\nstrong hand, or to take gear frae some other Englishman, providing ye\nlift nae mair than\u0092s been lifted frae you. That\u0092s the auld Border law,\nmade at Dundrennan, in the days of the Black Douglas, Deil ane need\ndoubt it. It\u0092s as clear as the sun.\u0094\n\n\u0093Come away, then, lads,\u0094 cried Simon, \u0093get to your geldings, and we\u0092ll\ntake auld Cuddie the muckle tasker wi\u0092 us; he kens the value o\u0092 the\nstock and plenishing that\u0092s been lost. Hobbie\u0092s stalls and stakes shall\nbe fou again or night; and if we canna big up the auld house sae soon,\nwe\u0092se lay an English ane as low as Heugh-foot is--and that\u0092s fair play,\na\u0092 the warld ower.\u0094\n\nThis animating proposal was received with great applause by the younger\npart of the assemblage, when a whisper ran among them, \u0093There\u0092s Hobbie\nhimsell, puir fallow! we\u0092ll be guided by him.\u0094\n\nThe principal sufferer, having now reached the bottom of the hill,\npushed on through the crowd, unable, from the tumultuous state of his\nfeelings, to do more than receive and return the grasps of the friendly\nhands by which his neighbours and kinsmen mutely expressed their\nsympathy in his misfortune. While he pressed Simon of Hackburn\u0092s\nhand, his anxiety at length found words. \u0093Thank ye, Simon--thank ye,\nneighbours--I ken what ye wad a\u0092 say. But where are they?--Where are--\u0094\n He stopped, as if afraid even to name the objects of his enquiry; and\nwith a similar feeling, his kinsmen, without reply, pointed to the hut,\ninto which Hobbie precipitated himself with the desperate air of one who\nis resolved to know the worst at once. A general and powerful expression\nof sympathy accompanied him. \u0093Ah, puir fallow--puir Hobbie!\u0094\n\n\u0093He\u0092ll learn the warst o\u0092t now!\u0094\n\n\u0093But I trust Earnscliff will get some speerings o\u0092 the puir lassie.\u0094\n\nSuch were the exclamations of the group, who, having no acknowledged\nleader to direct their motions, passively awaited the return of the\nsufferer, and determined to be guided by his directions.\n\nThe meeting between Hobbie and his family was in the highest degree\naffecting. His sisters threw themselves upon him, and almost stifled him\nwith their caresses, as if to prevent his looking round to distinguish\nthe absence of one yet more beloved.\n\n\u0093God help thee, my son! He can help when worldly trust is a broken\nreed.\u0094--Such was the welcome of the matron to her unfortunate grandson.\nHe looked eagerly round, holding two of his sisters by the hand, while\nthe third hung about his neck--\u0093I see you--I count you--my grandmother,\nLilias, Jean, and Annot; but where is--\u0094 (he hesitated, and then\ncontinued, as if with an effort), \u0093Where is Grace? Surely this is not a\ntime to hide hersell frae me--there\u0092s nae time for daffing now.\u0094\n\n\u0093O, brother!\u0094 and \u0093Our poor Grace!\u0094 was the only answer his questions\ncould procure, till his grandmother rose up, and gently disengaged\nhim from the weeping girls, led him to a seat, and with the affecting\nserenity which sincere piety, like oil sprinkled on the waves, can throw\nover the most acute feelings, she said, \u0093My bairn, when thy grandfather\nwas killed in the wars, and left me with six orphans around me, with\nscarce bread to eat, or a roof to cover us, I had strength,--not of mine\nown--but I had strength given me to say, The Lord\u0092s will be done!--My\nson, our peaceful house was last night broken into by moss-troopers,\narmed and masked; they have taken and destroyed all, and carried off our\ndear Grace. Pray for strength to say, His will be done!\u0094\n\n\u0093Mother! mother! urge me not--I cannot--not now I am a sinful man, and\nof a hardened race. Masked armed--Grace carried off! Gie me my sword,\nand my father\u0092s knapsack--I will have vengeance, if I should go to the\npit of darkness to seek it!\u0094\n\n\u0093O my bairn, my bairn! be patient under the rod. Who knows when He may\nlift His hand off from us? Young Earnscliff, Heaven bless him, has taen\nthe chase, with Davie of Stenhouse, and the first comers. I cried to let\nhouse and plenishing burn, and follow the reivers to recover Grace, and\nEarnscliff and his men were ower the Fell within three hours after the\ndeed. God bless him! he\u0092s a real Earnscliff; he\u0092s his father\u0092s true\nson--a leal friend.\u0094\n\n\u0093A true friend indeed; God bless him!\u0094 exclaimed Hobbie; \u0093let\u0092s on and\naway, and take the chase after him.\u0094\n\n\u0093O, my child, before you run on danger, let me hear you but say, HIS\nwill be done!\u0094\n\n\u0093Urge me not, mother--not now.\u0094 He was rushing out, when, looking back,\nhe observed his grandmother make a mute attitude of affliction. He\nreturned hastily, threw himself into her arms, and said, \u0093Yes, mother, I\nCAN say, HIS will be done, since it will comfort you.\u0094\n\n\u0093May He go forth--may He go forth with you, my dear bairn; and O, may He\ngive you cause to say on your return, HIS name be praised!\u0094\n\n\u0093Farewell, mother!--farewell, my dear sisters!\u0094 exclaimed Elliot, and\nrushed out of the house.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n     Now horse and hattock, cried the Laird,--\n     Now horse and hattock, speedilie;\n     They that winna ride for Telfer\u0092s kye,\n     Let them never look in the face o\u0092 me.--Border Ballad.\n\n\u0093Horse! horse! and spear!\u0094 exclaimed Hobbie to his kinsmen. Many a ready\nfoot was in the stirrup; and, while Elliot hastily collected arms and\naccoutrements, no easy matter in such a confusion, the glen resounded\nwith the approbation of his younger friends.\n\n\u0093Ay, ay!\u0094 exclaimed Simon of Hackburn, \u0093that\u0092s the gate to take it,\nHobbie. Let women sit and greet at hame, men must do as they have been\ndone by; it\u0092s the Scripture says\u0092t.\u0094\n\n\u0093Haud your tongue, sir,\u0094 said one of the seniors, sternly; \u0093dinna abuse\nthe Word that gate, ye dinna ken what ye speak about.\u0094\n\n\u0093Hae ye ony tidings?--Hae ye ony speerings, Hobbie?--O, callants, dinna\nbe ower hasty,\u0094 said old Dick of the Dingle.\n\n\u0093What signifies preaching to us, e\u0092enow?\u0094 said Simon; \u0093if ye canna make\nhelp yoursell, dinna keep back them that can.\u0094\n\n\u0093Whisht, sir; wad ye take vengeance or ye ken wha has wrang\u0092d ye?\u0094\n\n\u0093D\u0092ye think we dinna ken the road to England as weel as our fathers\nbefore us?--All evil comes out o\u0092 thereaway--it\u0092s an auld saying and a\ntrue; and we\u0092ll e\u0092en away there, as if the devil was blawing us south.\u0094\n\n\u0093We\u0092ll follow the track o\u0092 Earnscliff\u0092s horses ower the waste,\u0094 cried\none Elliot.\n\n\u0093I\u0092ll prick them out through the blindest moor in the Border, an there\nhad been a fair held there the day before,\u0094 said Hugh, the blacksmith of\nRingleburn, \u0093for I aye shoe his horse wi\u0092 my ain hand.\u0094\n\n\u0093Lay on the deer-hounds,\u0094 cried another \u0093where are they?\u0094\n\n\u0093Hout, man, the sun\u0092s been lang up, and the dew is aff the grund--the\nscent will never lie.\u0094\n\nHobbie instantly whistled on his hounds, which were roving about the\nruins of their old habitation, and filling the air with their doleful\nhowls.\n\n\u0093Now, Killbuck,\u0094 said Hobbie, \u0093try thy skill this day,\u0094 and then, as if a\nlight had suddenly broke on him,--\u0093that ill-faur\u0092d goblin spak something\no\u0092 this! He may ken mair o\u0092t, either by villains on earth, or devils\nbelow--I\u0092ll hae it frae him, if I should cut it out o\u0092 his mis-shapen\nbouk wi\u0092 my whinger.\u0094 He then hastily gave directions to his comrades:\n\u0093Four o\u0092 ye, wi\u0092 Simon, haud right forward to Graeme\u0092s-gap. If they\u0092re\nEnglish, they\u0092ll be for being back that way. The rest disperse\nby twasome and threesome through the waste, and meet me at the\nTrysting-pool. Tell my brothers, when they come up, to follow and meet\nus there. Poor lads, they will hae hearts weelnigh as sair as mine;\nlittle think they what a sorrowful house they are bringing their venison\nto! I\u0092ll ride ower Mucklestane-Moor mysell.\u0094\n\n\u0093And if I were you,\u0094 said Dick of the Dingle, \u0093I would speak to Canny\nElshie. He can tell you whatever betides in this land, if he\u0092s sae\nminded.\u0094\n\n\u0093He SHALL tell me,\u0094 said Hobbie, who was busy putting his arms in order,\n\u0093what he kens o\u0092 this night\u0092s job, or I shall right weel ken wherefore\nhe does not.\u0094\n\n\u0093Ay, but speak him fair, my bonny man--speak him fair Hobbie; the\nlike o\u0092 him will no bear thrawing. They converse sae muckle wi\u0092 thae\nfractious ghaists and evil spirits, that it clean spoils their temper.\u0094\n\n\u0093Let me alane to guide him,\u0094 answered Hobbie; \u0093there\u0092s that in my breast\nthis day, that would ower-maister a\u0092 the warlocks on earth, and a\u0092 the\ndevils in hell.\u0094\n\nAnd being now fully equipped, he threw himself on his horse, and spurred\nhim at a rapid pace against the steep ascent.\n\nElliot speedily surmounted the hill, rode down the other side at the\nsame rate, crossed a wood, and traversed a long glen, ere he at length\nregained Mucklestane-Moor. As he was obliged, in the course of his\njourney, to relax his speed in consideration of the labour which his\nhorse might still have to undergo, he had time to consider maturely in\nwhat manner he should address the Dwarf, in order to extract from him\nthe knowledge which he supposed him to be in possession of concerning\nthe authors of his misfortunes. Hobbie, though blunt, plain of speech,\nand hot of disposition, like most of his countrymen, was by no means\ndeficient in the shrewdness which is also their characteristic. He\nreflected, that from what he had observed on the memorable night when\nthe Dwarf was first seen, and from the conduct of that mysterious being\never since, he was likely to be rendered even more obstinate in his\nsullenness by threats and violence.\n\n\u0093I\u0092ll speak him fair,\u0094 he said, \u0093as auld Dickon advised me. Though folk\nsay he has a league wi\u0092 Satan, he canna be sic an incarnate devil as no\nto take some pity in a case like mine; and folk threep he\u0092ll whiles do\ngood, charitable sort o\u0092 things. I\u0092ll keep my heart doun as weel as I\ncan, and stroke him wi\u0092 the hair; and if the warst come to the warst,\nit\u0092s but wringing the head o\u0092 him about at last.\u0094\n\nIn this disposition of accommodation he approached the hut of the\nSolitary.\n\nThe old man was not upon his seat of audience, nor could Hobbie perceive\nhim in his garden, or enclosures.\n\n\u0093He\u0092s gotten into his very keep,\u0094 said Hobbie, \u0093maybe to be out o\u0092\nthe gate; but I\u0092se pu\u0092 it doun about his lugs, if I canna win at him\notherwise.\u0094\n\nHaving thus communed with himself, he raised his voice, and invoked\nElshie in a tone as supplicating as his conflicting feelings would\npermit. \u0093Elshie, my gude friend!\u0094 No reply. \u0093Elshie, canny Father\nElshie!\u0094 The Dwarf remained mute. \u0093Sorrow be in the crooked carcass of\nthee!\u0094 said the Borderer between his teeth; and then again attempting a\nsoothing tone,--\u0093Good Father Elshie, a most miserable creature desires\nsome counsel of your wisdom.\u0094\n\n\u0093The better!\u0094 answered the shrill and discordant voice of the Dwarf\nthrough a very small window, resembling an arrow slit, which he had\nconstructed near the door of his dwelling, and through which he could\nsee any one who approached it, without the possibility of their looking\nin upon him.\n\n\u0093The better!\u0094 said Hobbie impatiently; \u0093what is the better, Elshie? Do\nyou not hear me tell you I am the most miserable wretch living?\u0094\n\n\u0093And do you not hear me tell you it is so much the better! and did I\nnot tell you this morning, when you thought yourself so happy, what an\nevening was coming upon you?\u0094\n\n\u0093That ye did e\u0092en,\u0094 replied Hobbie, \u0093and that gars me come to you for\nadvice now; they that foresaw the trouble maun ken the cure.\u0094\n\n\u0093I know no cure for earthly trouble,\u0094 returned the Dwarf \u0093or, if I\ndid, why should I help others, when none hath aided me? Have I not lost\nwealth, that would have bought all thy barren hills a hundred times\nover? rank, to which thine is as that of a peasant? society, where\nthere was an interchange of all that was amiable--of all that was\nintellectual? Have I not lost all this? Am I not residing here, the\nveriest outcast on the face of Nature, in the most hideous and most\nsolitary of her retreats, myself more hideous than all that is around\nme? And why should other worms complain to me when they are trodden on,\nsince I am myself lying crushed and writhing under the chariot-wheel?\u0094\n\n\u0093Ye may have lost all this,\u0094 answered Hobbie, in the bitterness of\nemotion; \u0093land and friends, goods and gear; ye may hae lost them\na\u0092,--but ye ne\u0092er can hae sae sair a heart as mine, for ye ne\u0092er lost\nnae Grace Armstrong. And now my last hopes are gane, and I shall ne\u0092er\nsee her mair.\u0094\n\nThis he said in the tone of deepest emotion--and there followed a long\npause, for the mention of his bride\u0092s name had overcome the more angry\nand irritable feelings of poor Hobbie. Ere he had again addressed the\nSolitary, the bony hand and long fingers of the latter, holding a large\nleathern bag, was thrust forth at the small window, and as it unclutched\nthe burden, and let it drop with a clang upon the ground, his harsh\nvoice again addressed Elliot.\n\n\u0093There--there lies a salve for every human ill; so, at least, each human\nwretch readily thinks.--Begone; return twice as wealthy as thou wert\nbefore yesterday, and torment me no more with questions, complaints, or\nthanks; they are alike odious to me.\u0094\n\n\u0093It is a\u0092 gowd, by Heaven!\u0094 said Elliot, having glanced at the contents;\nand then again addressing the Hermit, \u0093Muckle obliged for your goodwill;\nand I wad blithely gie you a bond for some o\u0092 the siller, or a wadset\nower the lands o\u0092 Wideopen. But I dinna ken, Elshie; to be free wi\u0092 you,\nI dinna like to use siller unless I kend it was decently come by; and\nmaybe it might turn into sclate-stanes, and cheat some poor man.\u0094\n\n\u0093Ignorant idiot!\u0094 retorted the Dwarf; \u0093the trash is as genuine poison as\never was dug out of the bowels of the earth. Take it--use it, and may it\nthrive with you as it hath done with me!\u0094\n\n\u0093But I tell you,\u0094 said Elliot, \u0093it wasna about the gear that I was\nconsulting you,--it was a braw barn-yard, doubtless, and thirty head of\nfiner cattle there werena on this side of the Catrail; but let the\ngear gang,--if ye could but gie me speerings o\u0092 puir Grace, I would\nbe content to be your slave for life, in onything that didna touch my\nsalvation. O, Elshie, speak, man, speak!\u0094\n\n\u0093Well, then,\u0094 answered the Dwarf, as if worn out by his importunity,\n\u0093since thou hast not enough of woes of thine own, but must needs seek to\nburden thyself with those of a partner, seek her whom thou hast lost in\nthe WEST.\u0094\n\n\u0093In the WEST? That\u0092s a wide word.\u0094\n\n\u0093It is the last,\u0094 said the Dwarf, \u0093which I design to utter;\u0094 and he drew\nthe shutters of his window, leaving Hobbie to make the most of the hint\nhe had given.\n\nThe west! the west!--thought Elliot; the country is pretty quiet down\nthat way, unless it were Jock o\u0092 the Todholes; and he\u0092s ower auld now\nfor the like o\u0092 thae jobs.--West!--By My life, it must be Westburnflat.\n\u0093Elshie, just tell me one word. Am I right? Is it Westburnflat? If I\nam wrang, say sae. I wadna like to wyte an innocent neighbour wi\u0092\nviolence--No answer?--It must be the Red Reiver--I didna think he wad\nhae ventured on me, neither, and sae mony kin as there\u0092s o\u0092 us--I\nam thinking he\u0092ll hae some better backing than his Cumberland\nfriends.--Fareweel to you, Elshie, and mony thanks--I downa be fashed\nwi\u0092 the siller e\u0092en now, for I maun awa\u0092 to meet my friends at the\nTrysting-place--Sae, if ye carena to open the window, ye can fetch it in\nafter I\u0092m awa\u0092.\u0094\n\nStill there was no reply.\n\n\u0093He\u0092s deaf, or he\u0092s daft, or he\u0092s baith; but I hae nae time to stay to\nclaver wi\u0092 him.\u0094\n\nAnd off rode Hobbie Elliot towards the place of rendezvous which he had\nnamed to his friends.\n\nFour or five riders were already gathered at the Trysting pool. They\nstood in close consultation together, while their horses were permitted\nto graze among the poplars which overhung the broad still pool. A more\nnumerous party were seen coming from the southward. It proved to be\nEarnscliff and his party, who had followed the track of the cattle as\nfar as the English border, but had halted on the information that\na considerable force was drawn together under some of the Jacobite\ngentlemen in that district, and there were tidings of insurrection in\ndifferent parts of Scotland. This took away from the act which had been\nperpetrated the appearance of private animosity, or love of plunder; and\nEarnscliff was now disposed to regard it as a symptom of civil war.\nThe young gentleman greeted Hobbie with the most sincere sympathy, and\ninformed him of the news he had received.\n\n\u0093Then, may I never stir frae the bit,\u0094 said Elliot, \u0093if auld Ellieslaw\nis not at the bottom o\u0092 the haill villainy! Ye see he\u0092s leagued wi\u0092 the\nCumberland Catholics; and that agrees weel wi\u0092 what Elshie hinted about\nWestburnflat, for Ellieslaw aye protected him, and he will want to harry\nand disarm the country about his ain hand before he breaks out.\u0094\n\nSome now remembered that the party of ruffians had been heard to say\nthey were acting for James VIII., and were charged to disarm all rebels.\nOthers had heard Westburnflat boast, in drinking parties, that Ellieslaw\nwould soon be in arms for the Jacobite cause, and that he himself was\nto hold a command under him, and that they would be bad neighbours for\nyoung Earnscliff; and all that stood out for the established government.\nThe result was a strong belief that Westburnflat had headed the party\nunder Ellieslaw\u0092s orders; and they resolved to proceed instantly to the\nhouse of the former, and, if possible, to secure his person. They were\nby this time joined by so many of their dispersed friends, that their\nnumber amounted to upwards of twenty horsemen, well mounted, and\ntolerably, though variously, armed.\n\nA brook, which issued from a narrow glen among the hills, entered, at\nWestburnflat, upon the open marshy level, which, expanding about half\na mile in every direction, gives name to the spot. In this place the\ncharacter of the stream becomes changed, and, from being a lively\nbrisk-running mountain-torrent, it stagnates, like a blue swollen snake,\nin dull deep windings, through the swampy level. On the side of the\nstream, and nearly about the centre of the plain, arose the tower of\nWestburnflat, one of the few remaining strongholds formerly so numerous\nupon the Borders. The ground upon which it stood was gently elevated\nabove the marsh for the space of about a hundred yards, affording\nan esplanade of dry turf, which extended itself in the immediate\nneighbourhood of the tower; but, beyond which, the surface presented to\nstrangers was that of an impassable and dangerous bog. The owner of the\ntower and his inmates alone knew the winding and intricate paths, which,\nleading over ground that was comparatively sound, admitted visitors\nto his residence. But among the party which were assembled under\nEarnscliff\u0092s directions, there was more than one person qualified to act\nas a guide. For although the owner\u0092s character and habits of life were\ngenerally known, yet the laxity of feeling with respect to property\nprevented his being looked on with the abhorrence with which he must\nhave been regarded in a more civilized country. He was considered, among\nhis more peaceable neighbours, pretty much as a gambler, cock-fighter,\nor horse-jockey would be regarded at the present day; a person, of\ncourse, whose habits were to be condemned, and his society, in general,\navoided, yet who could not be considered as marked with the indelible\ninfamy attached to his profession, where laws have been habitually\nobserved. And their indignation was awakened against him upon\nthis occasion, not so much on account of the general nature of the\ntransaction, which was just such as was to be expected from this\nmarauder, as that the violence had been perpetrated upon a neighbour\nagainst whom he had no cause of quarrel,--against a friend of their\nown,--above all, against one of the name of Elliot, to which clan most\nof them belonged. It was not, therefore, wonderful, that there should\nbe several in the band pretty well acquainted with the locality of his\nhabitation, and capable of giving such directions and guidance as soon\nplaced the whole party on the open space of firm ground in front of the\nTower of Westburnflat.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n     So spak the knicht; the geaunt sed,\n     Lend forth with the the sely maid,\n     And mak me quile of the and sche;\n     For glaunsing ee, or brow so brent,\n     Or cheek with rose and lilye blent,\n     Me lists not ficht with the.--ROMANCE OF THE FALCON.\n\nThe tower, before which the party now stood, was a small square\nbuilding, of the most gloomy aspect. The walls were of great thickness,\nand the windows, or slits which served the purpose of windows, seemed\nrather calculated to afford the defenders the means of employing missile\nweapons, than for admitting air or light to the apartments within. A\nsmall battlement projected over the walls on every side, and afforded\nfarther advantage of defence by its niched parapet, within which arose\na steep roof, flagged with grey stones. A single turret at one angle,\ndefended by a door studded with huge iron nails, rose above the\nbattlement, and gave access to the roof from within, by the spiral\nstaircase which it enclosed. It seemed to the party that their motions\nwere watched by some one concealed within this turret; and they were\nconfirmed in their belief when, through a narrow loophole, a female hand\nwas seen to wave a handkerchief, as if by way of signal to them. Hobbie\nwas almost out of his senses with joy and eagerness.\n\n\u0093It was Grace\u0092s hand and arm,\u0094 he said; \u0093I can swear to it amang a\nthousand. There is not the like of it on this side of the Lowdens--We\u0092ll\nhave her out, lads, if we should carry off the Tower of Westburnflat\nstane by stane.\u0094\n\nEarnscliff, though he doubted the possibility of recognising a fair\nmaiden\u0092s hand at such a distance from the eye of the lover, would say\nnothing to damp his friend\u0092s animated hopes, and it was resolved to\nsummon the garrison.\n\nThe shouts of the party, and the winding of one or two horns, at length\nbrought to a loophole, which flanked the entrance, the haggard face of\nan old woman.\n\n\u0093That\u0092s the Reiver\u0092s mother,\u0094 said one of the Elliots; \u0093she\u0092s ten times\nwaur than himsell, and is wyted for muckle of the ill he does about the\ncountry.\u0094\n\n\u0093Wha are ye? what d\u0092ye want here?\u0094 were the queries of the respectable\nprogenitor.\n\n\u0093We are seeking William Graeme of Westburnflat,\u0094 said Earnscliff.\n\n\u0093He\u0092s no at hame,\u0094 returned the old dame.\n\n\u0093When did he leave home?\u0094 pursued Earnscliff.\n\n\u0093I canna tell,\u0094 said the portress.\n\n\u0093When will he return?\u0094 said Hobbie Elliot.\n\n\u0093I dinna ken naething about it,\u0094 replied the inexorable guardian of the\nkeep.\n\n\u0093Is there anybody within the tower with you?\u0094 again demanded Earnscliff.\n\n\u0093Naebody but mysell and baudrons,\u0094 said the old woman.\n\n\u0093Then open the gate and admit us,\u0094 said Earnscliff; \u0093I am a justice of\npeace, and in search of the evidence of a felony.\u0094\n\n\u0093Deil be in their fingers that draws a bolt for ye,\u0094 retorted the\nportress; \u0093for mine shall never do it. Thinkna ye shame o\u0092 yoursells,\nto come here siccan a band o\u0092 ye, wi\u0092 your swords, and spears, and\nsteel-caps, to frighten a lone widow woman?\u0094\n\n\u0093Our information,\u0094 said Earnscliff; \u0093is positive; we are seeking goods\nwhich have been forcibly carried off, to a great amount.\u0094\n\n\u0093And a young woman, that\u0092s been cruelly made prisoner, that\u0092s worth mair\nthan a\u0092 the gear, twice told,\u0094 said Hobbie.\n\n\u0093And I warn you.\u0094 continued Earnscliff, \u0093that your only way to prove\nyour son\u0092s innocence is to give us quiet admittance to search the\nhouse.\u0094\n\n\u0093And what will ye do, if I carena to thraw the keys, or draw the bolts,\nor open the grate to sic a clamjamfrie?\u0094 said the old dame, scoffingly.\n\n\u0093Force our way with the king\u0092s keys, and break the neck of every living\nsoul we find in the house, if ye dinna gie it ower forthwith!\u0094 menaced\nthe incensed Hobbie.\n\n\u0093Threatened folks live lang,\u0094 said the hag, in the same tone of irony;\n\u0093there\u0092s the iron grate--try your skeel on\u0092t, lads--it has kept out as\ngude men as you or now.\u0094\n\nSo saying, she laughed, and withdrew from the aperture through which she\nhad held the parley.\n\nThe besiegers now opened a serious consultation. The immense thickness\nof the walls, and the small size of the windows, might, for a time, have\neven resisted cannon-shot. The entrance was secured, first, by a strong\ngrated door, composed entirely of hammered iron, of such ponderous\nstrength as seemed calculated to resist any force that could be brought\nagainst it. \u0093Pinches or forehammers will never pick upon\u0092t,\u0094 said\nHugh, the blacksmith of Ringleburn; \u0093ye might as weel batter at it wi\u0092\npipe-staples.\u0094\n\nWithin the doorway, and at the distance of nine feet, which was the\nsolid thickness of the wall, there was a second door of oak, crossed,\nboth breadth and lengthways, with clenched bars of iron, and studded\nfull of broad-headed nails. Besides all these defences, they were by no\nmeans confident in the truth of the old dame\u0092s assertion, that she\nalone composed the garrison. The more knowing of the party had observed\nhoof-marks in the track by which they approached the tower, which\nseemed to indicate that several persons had very lately passed in that\ndirection.\n\nTo all these difficulties was added their want of means for attacking\nthe place. There was no hope of procuring ladders long enough to reach\nthe battlements, and the windows, besides being very narrow, were\nsecured with iron bars. Scaling was therefore out of the question;\nmining was still more so, for want of tools and gunpowder; neither\nwere the besiegers provided with food, means of shelter, or other\nconveniences, which might have enabled them to convert the siege into a\nblockade; and there would, at any rate, have been a risk of relief from\nsome of the marauder\u0092s comrades. Hobbie grinded and gnashed his teeth,\nas, walking round the fastness, he could devise no means of making a\nforcible entry. At length he suddenly exclaimed, \u0093And what for no do as\nour fathers did lang syne?--Put hand to the wark, lads. Let us cut up\nbushes and briers, pile them before the door and set fire to them, and\nsmoke that auld devil\u0092s dam as if she were to be reested for bacon.\u0094\n\nAll immediately closed with this proposal, and some went to work with\nswords and knives to cut down the alder and hawthorn bushes which grew\nby the side of the sluggish stream, many of which were sufficiently\ndecayed and dried for their purpose, while others began to collect\nthem in a large stack, properly disposed for burning, as close to the\niron-grate as they could be piled. Fire was speedily obtained from\none of their guns, and Hobbie was already advancing to the pile with a\nkindled brand, when the surly face of the robber, and the muzzle of\na musquetoon, were partially shown at a shot-hole which flanked the\nentrance. \u0093Mony thanks to ye,\u0094 he said, scoffingly, \u0093for collecting sae\nmuckle winter eilding for us; but if ye step a foot nearer it wi\u0092 that\nlunt, it\u0092s be the dearest step ye ever made in your days.\u0094\n\n\u0093We\u0092ll sune see that,\u0094 said Hobbie, advancing fearlessly with the torch.\n\nThe marauder snapped his piece at him, which, fortunately for our honest\nfriend, did not go off; while Earnscliff, firing at the same moment\nat the narrow aperture and slight mark afforded by the robber\u0092s face,\ngrazed the side of his head with a bullet. He had apparently calculated\nupon his post affording him more security, for he no sooner felt\nthe wound, though a very slight one, than he requested a parley,\nand demanded to know what they meant by attacking in this fashion a\npeaceable and honest man, and shedding his blood in that lawless manner?\n\n\u0093We want your prisoner,\u0094 said Earnscliff, \u0093to be delivered up to us in\nsafety.\u0094\n\n\u0093And what concern have you with her?\u0094 replied the marauder.\n\n\u0093That,\u0094 retorted Earnscliff, \u0093you, who are detaining her by force, have\nno right to enquire.\u0094\n\n\u0093Aweel, I think I can gie a guess,\u0094 said the robber. \u0093Weel, sirs, I am\nlaith to enter into deadly feud with you by spilling ony of your bluid,\nthough Earnscliff hasna stopped to shed mine--and he can hit a mark to a\ngroat\u0092s breadth--so, to prevent mair skaith, I am willing to deliver up\nthe prisoner, since nae less will please you.\u0094\n\n\u0093And Hobbie\u0092s gear?\u0094 cried Simon of Hackburn. \u0093D\u0092ye think you\u0092re to be\nfree to plunder the faulds and byres of a gentle Elliot, as if they were\nan auld wife\u0092s hens\u0092-cavey?\u0094\n\n\u0093As I live by bread,\u0094 replied Willie of Westburnflat \u0093As I live by\nbread, I have not a single cloot o\u0092 them! They\u0092re a\u0092 ower the march lang\nsyne; there\u0092s no a horn o\u0092 them about the tower. But I\u0092ll see what o\u0092\nthem can be gotten back, and I\u0092ll take this day twa days to meet Hobbie\nat the Castleton wi\u0092 twa friends on ilka side, and see to make an\nagreement about a\u0092 the wrang he can wyte me wi\u0092.\u0094\n\n\u0093Ay, ay,\u0094 said Elliot, \u0093that will do weel eneugh.\u0094--And then aside to\nhis kinsman, \u0093Murrain on the gear! Lordsake, man! say nought about them.\nLet us but get puir Grace out o\u0092 that auld hellicat\u0092s clutches.\u0094\n\n\u0093Will ye gie me your word, Earnscliff,\u0094 said the marauder, who still\nlingered at the shot-hole, \u0093your faith and troth, with hand and glove,\nthat I am free to come and free to gae, with five minutes to open the\ngrate, and five minutes to steek it and to draw the bolts? less winna\ndo, for they want creishing sairly. Will ye do this?\u0094\n\n\u0093You shall have full time,\u0094 said Earnscliff; \u0093I plight my faith and\ntroth, my hand and my glove.\u0094\n\n\u0093Wait there a moment, then,\u0094 said Westburnflat; \u0093or hear ye, I wad\nrather ye wad fa\u0092 back a pistol-shot from the door. It\u0092s no that I\nmistrust your word, Earnscliff; but it\u0092s best to be sure.\u0094\n\nO, friend, thought Hobbie to himself, as he drew back, an I had you but\non Turner\u0092s-holm, [There is a level meadow, on the very margin of the\ntwo kingdoms, called Turner\u0092s-holm, just where the brook called Crissop\njoins the Liddel. It is said to have derived its name as being a place\nfrequently assigned for tourneys, during the ancient Border times.] and\nnaebody by but twa honest lads to see fair play, I wad make ye wish ye\nhad broken your leg ere ye had touched beast or body that belanged to\nme!\n\n\u0093He has a white feather in his wing this same Westburnflat, after\na\u0092,\u0094 said Simon of Hackburn, somewhat scandalized by his ready\nsurrender.--\u0093He\u0092ll ne\u0092er fill his father\u0092s boots.\u0094\n\nIn the meanwhile, the inner door of the tower was opened, and the mother\nof the freebooter appeared in the space betwixt that and the outer\ngrate. Willie himself was next seen, leading forth a female, and the old\nwoman, carefully bolting the grate behind them, remained on the post as\na sort of sentinel.\n\n\u0093Ony ane or twa o\u0092 ye come forward,\u0094 said the outlaw, \u0093and take her frae\nmy hand haill and sound.\u0094\n\nHobbie advanced eagerly, to meet his betrothed bride. Earnscliff\nfollowed more slowly, to guard against treachery. Suddenly Hobbie\nslackened his pace in the deepest mortification, while that of\nEarnscliff was hastened by impatient surprise. It was not Grace\nArmstrong, but Miss Isabella Vere, whose liberation had been effected by\ntheir appearance before the tower.\n\n\u0093Where is Grace? where is Grace Armstrong?\u0094 exclaimed Hobbie, in the\nextremity of wrath and indignation.\n\n\u0093Not in my hands,\u0094 answered Westburnflat; \u0093ye may search the tower, if\nye misdoubt me.\u0094\n\n\u0093You false villain, you shall account for her, or die on the spot,\u0094 said\nElliot, presenting his gun.\n\nBut his companions, who now came up, instantly disarmed him of his\nweapon, exclaiming, all at once, \u0093Hand and glove! faith and troth! Haud\na care, Hobbie we maun keep our faith wi\u0092 Westburnflat, were he the\ngreatest rogue ever rode.\u0094\n\nThus protected, the outlaw recovered his audacity, which had been\nsomewhat daunted by the menacing gesture of Elliot.\n\n\u0093I have kept my word, sirs,\u0094 he said, \u0093and I look to have nae wrang\namang ye. If this is no the prisoner ye sought,\u0094 he said, addressing\nEarnscliff, \u0093ye\u0092ll render her back to me again. I am answerable for her\nto those that aught her.\u0094\n\n\u0093For God\u0092s sake, Mr. Earnscliff, protect me!\u0094 said Miss Vere, clinging\nto her deliverer; \u0093do not you abandon one whom the whole world seems to\nhave abandoned.\u0094\n\n\u0093Fear nothing,\u0094 whispered Earnscliff, \u0093I will protect you with my life.\u0094\n Then turning to Westburnflat, \u0093Villain!\u0094 he said, \u0093how dared you to\ninsult this lady?\u0094\n\n\u0093For that matter, Earnscliff,\u0094 answered the freebooter, \u0093I can answer to\nthem that has better right to ask me than you have; but if you come with\nan armed force, and take her awa\u0092 from them that her friends lodged her\nwi\u0092, how will you answer THAT--But it\u0092s your ain affair--Nae single man\ncan keep a tower against twenty--A\u0092 the men o\u0092 the Mearns downa do mair\nthan they dow.\u0094\n\n\u0093He lies most falsely,\u0094 said Isabella; \u0093he carried me off by violence\nfrom my father.\u0094\n\n\u0093Maybe he only wanted ye to think sae, hinny,\u0094 replied the robber; \u0093but\nit\u0092s nae business o\u0092 mine, let it be as it may.--So ye winna resign her\nback to me?\u0094\n\n\u0093Back to you, fellow? Surely no,\u0094 answered Earnscliff; \u0093I will\nprotect Miss Vere, and escort her safely wherever she is pleased to be\nconveyed.\u0094\n\n\u0093Ay, ay, maybe you and her hae settled that already,\u0094 said Willie of\nWestburnflat.\n\n\u0093And Grace?\u0094 interrupted Hobbie, shaking himself loose from the friends\nwho had been preaching to him the sanctity of the safe-conduct, upon\nthe faith of which the freebooter had ventured from his tower,--\u0093Where\u0092s\nGrace?\u0094 and he rushed on the marauder, sword in hand.\n\nWestburnflat, thus pressed, after calling out, \u0093Godsake, Hobbie, hear\nme a gliff!\u0094 fairly turned his back and fled. His mother stood ready\nto open and shut the grate; but Hobbie struck at the freebooter as he\nentered with so much force, that the sword made a considerable cleft in\nthe lintel of the vaulted door, which is still shown as a memorial of\nthe superior strength of those who lived in the days of yore. Ere\nHobbie could repeat the blow, the door was shut and secured, and he was\ncompelled to retreat to his companions, who were now preparing to break\nup the siege of Westburnflat. They insisted upon his accompanying them\nin their return.\n\n\u0093Ye hae broken truce already,\u0094 said old Dick of the Dingle; \u0093an we\ntakena the better care, ye\u0092ll play mair gowk\u0092s tricks, and make yoursell\nthe laughing-stock of the haill country, besides having your friends\ncharged with slaughter under trust. Bide till the meeting at Castleton,\nas ye hae greed; and if he disna make ye amends, then we\u0092ll hae it out\no\u0092 his heart\u0092s blood. But let us gang reasonably to wark and keep our\ntryst, and I\u0092se warrant we get back Grace, and the kye an\u0092 a\u0092.\u0094\n\nThis cold-blooded reasoning went ill down with the unfortunate lover;\nbut, as he could only obtain the assistance of his neighbours and\nkinsmen on their own terms, he was compelled to acquiesce in their\nnotions of good faith and regular procedure.\n\nEarnscliff now requested the assistance of a few of the party to\nconvey Miss Vere to her father\u0092s castle of Ellieslaw, to which she was\nperemptory in desiring to be conducted. This was readily granted; and\nfive or six young men agreed to attend him as an escort. Hobbie was not\nof the number. Almost heart-broken by the events of the day, and his\nfinal disappointment, he returned moodily home to take such measures as\nhe could for the sustenance and protection of his family, and to arrange\nwith his neighbours the farther steps which should be adopted for\nthe recovery of Grace Armstrong. The rest of the party dispersed in\ndifferent directions, as soon as they had crossed the morass. The\noutlaw and his mother watched them from the tower, until they entirely\ndisappeared.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n     I left my ladye\u0092s bower last night--\n     It was clad in wreaths of snaw,--\n     I\u0092ll seek it when the sun is bright,\n     And sweet the roses blaw.--OLD BALLAD.\n\nIncensed at what he deemed the coldness of his friends, in a cause\nwhich interested him so nearly, Hobbie had shaken himself free of their\ncompany, and was now on his solitary road homeward. \u0093The fiend founder\nthee!\u0094 said he, as he spurred impatiently his over-fatigued and\nstumbling horse; \u0093thou art like a\u0092 the rest o\u0092 them. Hae I not bred\nthee, and fed thee, and dressed thee wi\u0092 mine ain hand, and wouldst thou\nsnapper now and break my neck at my utmost need? But thou\u0092rt e\u0092en like\nthe lave--the farthest off o\u0092 them a\u0092 is my cousin ten times removed,\nand day or night I wad hae served them wi\u0092 my best blood; and now, I\nthink they show mair regard to the common thief of Westburnflat than to\ntheir ain kinsman. But I should see the lights now in Heugh-foot--Wae\u0092s\nme!\u0094 he continued, recollecting himself, \u0093there will neither coal nor\ncandle-light shine in the Heugh-foot ony mair! An it werena for my\nmother and sisters, and poor Grace, I could find in my heart to put\nspurs to the beast, and loup ower the scaur into the water to make an\nend o\u0092t a\u0092.\u0094--In this disconsolate mood he turned his horse\u0092s bridle\ntowards the cottage in which his family had found refuge.\n\nAs he approached the door, he heard whispering and tittering amongst\nhis sisters. \u0093The deevil\u0092s in the women,\u0094 said poor Hobbie; \u0093they\nwould nicker, and laugh, and giggle, if their best friend was lying a\ncorp--and yet I am glad they can keep up their hearts sae weel, poor\nsilly things; but the dirdum fa\u0092s on me, to be sure, and no on them.\u0094\n\nWhile he thus meditated, he was engaged in fastening up his horse in\na shed. \u0093Thou maun do without horse-sheet and surcingle now, lad,\u0094 he\nsaid, addressing the animal; \u0093you and me hae had a downcome alike; we\nhad better hae fa\u0092en i, the deepest pool o\u0092 Tarras.\u0094\n\nHe was interrupted by the youngest of his sisters, who came running\nout, and, speaking in a constrained voice, as if to stifle some emotion,\ncalled out to him, \u0093What are ye doing there, Hobbie, fiddling about the\nnaig, and there\u0092s ane frae Cumberland been waiting here for ye this hour\nand mair? Haste ye in, man; I\u0092ll take off the saddle.\u0094\n\n\u0093Ane frae Cumberland!\u0094 exclaimed Elliot; and putting the bridle of his\nhorse into the hand of his sister, he rushed into the cottage. \u0093Where is\nhe? where is he!\u0094 he exclaimed, glancing eagerly around, and seeing only\nfemales; \u0093Did he bring news of Grace?\u0094\n\n\u0093He doughtna bide an instant langer,\u0094 said the elder sister, still with\na suppressed laugh.\n\n\u0093Hout fie, bairns!\u0094 said the old lady, with something of a good-humoured\nreproof, \u0093ye shouldna vex your billy Hobbie that way.--Look round, my\nbairn, and see if there isna ane here mair than ye left this morning.\u0094\n\nHobbie looked eagerly round. \u0093There\u0092s you, and the three titties.\u0094\n\n\u0093There\u0092s four of us now, Hobbie, lad,\u0094 said the youngest, who at this\nmoment entered.\n\nIn an instant Hobbie had in his arms Grace Armstrong, who, with one\nof his sister\u0092s plaids around her, had passed unnoticed at his first\nentrance. \u0093How dared you do this?\u0094 said Hobbie.\n\n\u0093It wasna my fault,\u0094 said Grace, endeavouring to cover her face with her\nhands to hide at once her blushes, and escape the storm of hearty kisses\nwith which her bridegroom punished her simple stratagem,--\u0093It wasna my\nfault, Hobbie; ye should kiss Jeanie and the rest o\u0092 them, for they hae\nthe wyte o\u0092t.\u0094\n\n\u0093And so I will,\u0094 said Hobbie, and embraced and kissed his sisters\nand grandmother a hundred times, while the whole party half-laughed,\nhalf-cried, in the extremity of their joy. \u0093I am the happiest man,\u0094 said\nHobbie, throwing himself down on a seat, almost exhausted,--\u0093I am the\nhappiest man in the world!\u0094\n\n\u0093Then, O my dear bairn,\u0094 said the good old dame, who lost no opportunity\nof teaching her lesson of religion at those moments when the heart\nwas best open to receive it,--\u0093Then, O my son, give praise to Him that\nbrings smiles out o\u0092 tears and joy out o\u0092 grief, as He brought light out\no\u0092 darkness and the world out o\u0092 naething. Was it not my word, that if\nye could say His will be done, ye might hae cause to say His name be\npraised?\u0094\n\n\u0093It was--it was your word, grannie; and I do praise Him for His mercy,\nand for leaving me a good parent when my ain were gane,\u0094 said honest\nHobbie, taking her hand, \u0093that puts me in mind to think of Him, baith in\nhappiness and distress.\u0094\n\nThere was a solemn pause of one or two minutes employed in the exercise\nof mental devotion, which expressed, in purity and sincerity, the\ngratitude of the affectionate family to that Providence who had\nunexpectedly restored to their embraces the friend whom they had lost.\n\nHobbie\u0092s first enquiries were concerning the adventures which Grace\nhad undergone. They were told at length, but amounted in substance\nto this:--That she was awaked by the noise which the ruffians made in\nbreaking into the house, and by the resistance made by one or two of the\nservants, which was soon overpowered; that, dressing herself hastily,\nshe ran downstairs, and having seen, in the scuffle, Westburnflat\u0092s\nvizard drop off, imprudently named him by his name, and besought him for\nmercy; that the ruffian instantly stopped her mouth, dragged her from\nthe house, and placed her on horseback, behind one of his associates.\n\n\u0093I\u0092ll break the accursed neck of him,\u0094 said Hobbie, \u0093if there werena\nanother Graeme in the land but himsell!\u0094\n\nShe proceeded to say, that she was carried southward along with the\nparty, and the spoil which they drove before them, until they had\ncrossed the Border. Suddenly a person, known to her as a kinsman of\nWestburnflat, came riding very fast after the marauders, and told their\nleader, that his cousin had learnt from a sure hand that no luck would\ncome of it, unless the lass was restored to her friends. After some\ndiscussion, the chief of the party seemed to acquiesce. Grace was placed\nbehind her new guardian, who pursued in silence, and with great speed,\nthe least-frequented path to the Heugh-foot, and ere evening closed, set\ndown the fatigued and terrified damsel within a quarter of a mile of the\ndwelling of her friends. Many and sincere were the congratulations which\npassed on all sides.\n\nAs these emotions subsided, less pleasing considerations began to\nintrude themselves.\n\n\u0093This is a miserable place for ye a\u0092,\u0094 said Hobbie, looking around him;\n\u0093I can sleep weel eneugh mysell outby beside the naig, as I hae done\nmony a lang night on the hills; but how ye are to put yoursells up, I\ncanna see! And what\u0092s waur, I canna mend it; and what\u0092s waur than a\u0092,\nthe morn may come, and the day after that, without your being a bit\nbetter off.\u0094\n\n\u0093It was a cowardly cruel thing,\u0094 said one of the sisters, looking round,\n\u0093to harry a puir family to the bare wa\u0092s this gate.\u0094\n\n\u0093And leave us neither stirk nor stot,\u0094 said the youngest brother, who\nnow entered, \u0093nor sheep nor lamb, nor aught that eats grass and corn.\u0094\n\n\u0093If they had ony quarrel wi\u0092 us,\u0094 said Harry, the second brother, \u0093were\nwe na ready to have fought it out? And that we should have been a\u0092 frae\nhame, too,--ane and a\u0092 upon the hill--Odd, an we had been at hame, Will\nGraeme\u0092s stamach shouldna hae wanted its morning; but it\u0092s biding him,\nis it na, Hobbie?\u0094\n\n\u0093Our neighbours hae taen a day at the Castleton to gree wi\u0092 him at the\nsight o\u0092 men,\u0094 said Hobbie, mournfully; \u0093they behoved to have it a\u0092\ntheir ain gate, or there was nae help to be got at their hands.\u0094\n\n\u0093To gree wi\u0092 him!\u0094 exclaimed both his brothers at once, \u0093after siccan an\nact of stouthrife as hasna been heard o\u0092 in the country since the auld\nriding days!\u0094\n\n\u0093Very true, billies, and my blood was e\u0092en boiling at it; but the sight\no\u0092 Grace Armstrong has settled it brawly.\u0094\n\n\u0093But the stocking, Hobbie\u0092\u0094 said John Elliot; \u0093we\u0092re utterly ruined.\nHarry and I hae been to gather what was on the outby land, and there\u0092s\nscarce a cloot left. I kenna how we\u0092re to carry on--We maun a\u0092 gang\nto the wars, I think. Westburnflat hasna the means, e\u0092en if he had the\nwill, to make up our loss; there\u0092s nae mends to be got out o\u0092 him, but\nwhat ye take out o\u0092 his banes. He hasna a four-footed creature but the\nvicious blood thing he rides on, and that\u0092s sair trash\u0092d wi\u0092 his night\nwark. We are ruined stoop and roop.\u0094\n\nHobbie cast a mournful glance on Grace Armstrong, who returned it with a\ndowncast look and a gentle sigh.\n\n\u0093Dinna be cast down, bairns,\u0094 said the grandmother, \u0093we hae gude friends\nthat winna forsake us in adversity. There\u0092s Sir Thomas Kittleloof is my\nthird cousin by the mother\u0092s side, and he has come by a hantle siller,\nand been made a knight-baronet into the bargain, for being ane o\u0092 the\ncommissioners at the Union.\u0094\n\n\u0093He wadna gie a bodle to save us frae famishing,\u0094 said Hobbie; \u0093and, if\nhe did, the bread that I bought wi\u0092t would stick in my throat, when\nI thought it was part of the price of puir auld Scotland\u0092s crown and\nindependence.\u0094\n\n\u0093There\u0092s the Laird o\u0092 Dunder, ane o\u0092 the auldest families in\nTiviotdale.\u0094\n\n\u0093He\u0092s in the tolbooth, mother--he\u0092s in the Heart of Mid-Louden for a\nthousand merk he borrowed from Saunders Wyliecoat the writer.\u0094\n\n\u0093Poor man!\u0094 exclaimed Mrs. Elliot, \u0093can we no send him something,\nHobbie?\u0094\n\n\u0093Ye forget, grannie, ye forget we want help oursells,\u0094 said Hobbie,\nsomewhat peevishly.\n\n\u0093Troth did I, hinny,\u0094 replied the good-natured lady, \u0093just at the\ninstant; it\u0092s sae natural to think on ane\u0092s blude relations before\nthemsells;--But there\u0092s young Earnscliff.\u0094\n\n\u0093He has ower little o\u0092 his ain; and siccan a name to keep up, it wad be\na shame,\u0094 said Hobbie, \u0093to burden him wi\u0092 our distress. And I\u0092ll tell\nye, grannie, it\u0092s needless to sit rhyming ower the style of a\u0092 your\nkith, kin, and allies, as if there was a charm in their braw names to do\nus good; the grandees hae forgotten us, and those of our ain degree hae\njust little eneugh to gang on wi\u0092 themsells; ne\u0092er a friend hae we that\ncan, or will, help us to stock the farm again.\u0094\n\n\u0093Then, Hobbie, me maun trust in Him that can raise up friends and\nfortune out o\u0092 the bare moor, as they say.\u0094\n\nHobbie sprung upon his feet. \u0093Ye are right, grannie!\u0094 he exclaimed; \u0093ye\nare right. I do ken a friend on the bare moor, that baith can and will\nhelp us--The turns o\u0092 this day hae dung my head clean hirdie-girdie.\nI left as muckle gowd lying on Mucklestane-Moor this morning as would\nplenish the house and stock the Heugh-foot twice ower, and I am certain\nsure Elshie wadna grudge us the use of it.\u0094\n\n\u0093Elshie!\u0094 said his grandmother in astonishment; \u0093what Elshie do you\nmean?\u0094\n\n\u0093What Elshie should I mean, but Canny Elshie, the Wight o\u0092 Mucklestane,\u0094\n replied Hobbie.\n\n\u0093God forfend, my bairn, you should gang to fetch water out o\u0092 broken\ncisterns, or seek for relief frae them that deal wi\u0092 the Evil One! There\nwas never luck in their gifts, nor grace in their paths. And the haill\ncountry kens that body Elshie\u0092s an unco man. O, if there was the law,\nand the douce quiet administration of justice, that makes a kingdom\nflourish in righteousness, the like o\u0092 them suldna be suffered to live!\nThe wizard and the witch are the abomination and the evil thing in the\nland.\u0094\n\n\u0093Troth, mother,\u0094 answered Hobbie, \u0093ye may say what ye like, but I am in\nthe mind that witches and warlocks havena half the power they had lang\nsyne; at least, sure am I, that ae ill-deviser, like auld Ellieslaw, or\nae ill-doer, like that d--d villain Westburnflat, is a greater plague\nand abomination in a country-side than a haill curnie o\u0092 the warst\nwitches that ever capered on a broomstick, or played cantrips on\nFastern\u0092s E\u0092en. It wad hae been lang or Elshie had burnt down my house\nand barns, and I am determined to try if he will do aught to build them\nup again. He\u0092s weel kend a skilfu\u0092 man ower a\u0092 the country, as far as\nBrough under Stanmore.\u0094\n\n\u0093Bide a wee, my bairn; mind his benefits havena thriven wi\u0092 a\u0092body. Jock\nHowden died o\u0092 the very same disorder Elshie pretended to cure him of,\nabout the fa\u0092 o\u0092 the leaf; and though he helped Lambside\u0092s cow weel out\no\u0092 the moor-ill, yet the louping-ill\u0092s been sairer amane; his sheep than\nony season before. And then I have heard he uses sic words abusing human\nnature, that\u0092s like a fleeing in the face of Providence; and ye mind ye\nsaid yoursell, the first time ye ever saw him, that he was mair like a\nbogle than a living thing.\u0094\n\n\u0093Hout, mother,\u0094 said Hobbie, \u0093Elshie\u0092s no that bad a chield; he\u0092s a\ngrewsome spectacle for a crooked disciple, to be sure, and a rough\ntalker, but his bark is waur than his bite; sae, if I had anes something\nto eat, for I havena had a morsel ower my throat this day, I wad streek\nmysell down for twa or three hours aside the beast, and be on and awa\u0092\nto Mucklestane wi\u0092 the first skreigh o\u0092 morning.\u0094\n\n\u0093And what for no the night, Hobbie,\u0094 said Harry, \u0093and I will ride wi\u0092\nye?\u0094\n\n\u0093My naig is tired,\u0094 said Hobbie.\n\n\u0093Ye may take mine, then,\u0094 said John.\n\n\u0093But I am a wee thing wearied mysell.\u0094\n\n\u0093You wearied?\u0094 said Harry; \u0093shame on ye! I have kend ye keep the saddle\nfour-and-twenty hours thegither, and ne\u0092er sic a word as weariness in\nyour wame.\u0094\n\n\u0093The night\u0092s very dark,\u0094 said Hobbie, rising and looking through the\ncasement of the cottage; \u0093and, to speak truth, and shame the deil,\nthough Elshie\u0092s a real honest fallow, yet somegate I would rather take\ndaylight wi\u0092 me when I gang to visit him.\u0094\n\nThis frank avowal put a stop to further argument; and Hobbie, having\nthus compromised matters between the rashness of his brother\u0092s counsel,\nand the timid cautions which he received from his grandmother, refreshed\nhimself with such food as the cottage afforded; and, after a cordial\nsalutation all round, retired to the shed, and stretched himself beside\nhis trusty palfrey. His brothers shared between them some trusses of\nclean straw, disposed in the stall usually occupied by old Annaple\u0092s\ncow; and the females arranged themselves for repose as well as the\naccommodations of the cottage would permit.\n\nWith the first dawn of morning, Hobbie arose; and, having rubbed down\nand saddled his horse, he set forth to Mucklestane-Moor. He avoided the\ncompany of either of his brothers, from an idea that the Dwarf was most\npropitious to those who visited him alone.\n\n\u0093The creature,\u0094 said he to himself, as he went along, \u0093is no\nneighbourly; ae body at a time is fully mair than he weel can abide.\nI wonder if he\u0092s looked out o\u0092 the crib o\u0092 him to gather up the bag\no\u0092 siller. If he hasna done that, it will hae been a braw windfa\u0092 for\nsomebody, and I\u0092ll be finely flung.--Come, Tarras,\u0094 said he to his\nhorse, striking him at the same time with his spur, \u0093make mair fit, man;\nwe maun be first on the field if we can.\u0094\n\nHe was now on the heath, which began to be illuminated by the beams of\nthe rising sun; the gentle declivity which he was descending presented\nhim a distinct, though distant view, of the Dwarf\u0092s dwelling. The door\nopened, and Hobbie witnessed with his own eyes that phenomenon which he\nhad frequently heard mentioned. Two human figures (if that of the Dwarf\ncould be termed such) issued from the solitary abode of the Recluse, and\nstood as if in converse together in the open air. The taller form then\nstooped, as if taking something up which lay beside the door of the\nhut, then both moved forward a little way, and again halted, as in deep\nconference. All Hobbie\u0092s superstitious terrors revived on witnessing\nthis\u0092spectacle. That the Dwarf would open his dwelling to a mortal\nguest, was as improbable as that any one would choose voluntarily to\nbe his nocturnal visitor; and, under full conviction that he beheld a\nwizard holding intercourse with his familiar spirit, Hobbie pulled in at\nonce his breath and his bridle, resolved not to incur the indignation\nof either by a hasty intrusion on their conference. They were probably\naware of his approach, for he had not halted for a moment before the\nDwarf returned to his cottage; and the taller figure who had accompanied\nhim, glided round the enclosure of the garden, and seemed to disappear\nfrom the eyes of the admiring Hobbie.\n\n\u0093Saw ever mortal the like o\u0092 that!\u0094 said Elliot; \u0093but my case is\ndesperate, sae, if he were Beelzebub himsell, I\u0092se venture down the brae\non him.\u0094\n\nYet, notwithstanding his assumed courage, he slackened his pace, when,\nnearly upon the very spot where he had last seen the tall figure,\nhe discerned, as if lurking among the long heather, a small black\nrough-looking object, like a terrier dog.\n\n\u0093He has nae dog that ever I heard of,\u0094 said Hobbie, \u0093but mony a deil\nabout his hand--lord forgie me for saying sic a word!--It keeps its\ngrund, be what it like--I\u0092m judging it\u0092s a badger; but whae kens what\nshapes thae bogies will take to fright a body? it will maybe start up\nlike a lion or a crocodile when I come nearer. I\u0092se e\u0092en drive a stage\nat it, for if it change its shape when I\u0092m ower near, Tarras will never\nstand it; and it will be ower muckle to hae him and the deil to fight\nwi\u0092 baith at ance.\u0094\n\nHe therefore cautiously threw a stone at the object, which continued\nmotionless. \u0093It\u0092s nae living thing, after a\u0092,\u0094 said Hobbie, approaching,\n\u0093but the very bag o\u0092 siller he flung out o\u0092 the window yesterday! and\nthat other queer lang creature has just brought it sae muckle farther\non the way to me.\u0094 He then advanced and lifted the heavy fur pouch,\nwhich was quite full of gold. \u0093Mercy on us!\u0094 said Hobbie, whose heart\nfluttered between glee at the revival of his hopes and prospects\nin life, and suspicion of the purpose for which this assistance was\nafforded him---\u0093Mercy on us! it\u0092s an awfu\u0092 thing to touch what has been\nsae lately in the claws of something no canny, I canna shake mysell\nloose o\u0092 the belief that there has been some jookery-paukery of Satan\u0092s\nin a\u0092 this; but I am determined to conduct mysell like an honest man and\na good Christian, come o\u0092t what will.\u0094\n\nHe advanced accordingly to the cottage door, and having knocked\nrepeatedly without receiving any answer, he at length elevated his voice\nand addressed the inmate of the hut. \u0093Elshie! Father Elshie! I ken ye\u0092re\nwithin doors, and wauking, for I saw ye at the door-cheek as I cam ower\nthe bent; will ye come out and speak just a gliff to ane that has mony\nthanks to gie ye?--It was a\u0092 true ye tell\u0092d me about Westburnflat; but\nhe\u0092s sent back Grace safe and skaithless, sae there\u0092s nae ill happened\nyet but what may be suffered or sustained;--Wad ye but come out a gliff;\nman, or but say ye\u0092re listening?--Aweel, since ye winna answer, I\u0092se\ne\u0092en proceed wi\u0092 my tale. Ye see I hae been thinking it wad be a sair\nthing on twa young folk, like Grace and me, to put aff our marriage for\nmony years till I was abroad and came back again wi\u0092 some gear; and they\nsay folk maunna take booty in the wars as they did lang syne, and the\nqueen\u0092s pay is a sma\u0092 matter; there\u0092s nae gathering gear on that--and\nthen my grandame\u0092s auld--and my sisters wad sit peengin\u0092 at the\ningle-side for want o\u0092 me to ding them about--and Earnscliff, or the\nneighbourhood, or maybe your ainsell, Elshie, might want some good turn\nthat Hob Elliot could do ye--and it\u0092s a pity that the auld house o\u0092 the\nHeugh-foot should be wrecked a\u0092thegither. Sae I was thinking--but deil\nhae me, that I should say sae,\u0094 continued he, checking himself, \u0093if I\ncan bring mysell to ask a favour of ane that winna sae muckle as ware a\nword on me, to tell me if he hears me speaking till him.\u0094\n\n\u0093Say what thou wilt--do what thou wilt,\u0094 answered the Dwarf from his\ncabin, \u0093but begone, and leave me at peace.\u0094\n\n\u0093Weel, weel,\u0094 replied Elliot, \u0093since ye are willing to hear me, I\u0092se\nmake my tale short. Since ye are sae kind as to say ye are content to\nlend me as muckle siller as will stock and plenish the Heugh-foot, I am\ncontent, on my part, to accept the courtesy wi\u0092 mony kind thanks; and\ntroth, I think it will be as safe in my hands as yours, if ye leave it\nflung about in that gate for the first loon body to lift, forbye the\nrisk o\u0092 bad neighbours that can win through steekit doors and lockfast\nplaces, as I can tell to my cost. I say, since ye hae sae muckle\nconsideration for me, I\u0092se be blithe to accept your kindness; and my\nmother and me (she\u0092s a life-renter, and I am fiar, o\u0092 the lands o\u0092\nWideopen) would grant you a wadset, or an heritable bond, for the\nsiller, and to pay the annual rent half-yearly; and Saunders Wyliecoat\nto draw the bond, and you to be at nae charge wi\u0092 the writings.\u0094\n\n\u0093Cut short thy jargon, and begone,\u0094 said the Dwarf; \u0093thy loquacious\nbull-headed honesty makes thee a more intolerable plague than the\nlight-fingered courtier who would take a man\u0092s all without troubling him\nwith either thanks, explanation, or apology. Hence, I say! thou art\none of those tame slaves whose word is as good as their bond. Keep the\nmoney, principal and interest, until I demand it of thee.\u0094\n\n\u0093But,\u0094 continued the pertinacious Borderer, \u0093we are a\u0092 life-like and\ndeath-like, Elshie, and there really should be some black and white on\nthis transaction. Sae just make me a minute, or missive, in ony form\nye like, and I\u0092se write it fair ower, and subscribe it before famous\nwitnesses. Only, Elshie, I wad wuss ye to pit naething in\u0092t that may be\nprejudicial to my salvation; for I\u0092ll hae the minister to read it ower,\nand it wad only be exposing yoursell to nae purpose. And now I\u0092m ganging\nawa\u0092, for ye\u0092ll be wearied o\u0092 my cracks, and I am wearied wi\u0092 cracking\nwithout an answer--and I\u0092se bring ye a bit o\u0092 bride\u0092s-cake ane o\u0092 thae\ndays, and maybe bring Grace to see you. Ye wad like to see Grace, man,\nfor as dour as ye are--Eh, Lord I I wish he may be weel, that was a sair\ngrane! or, maybe, he thought I was speaking of heavenly grace, and no of\nGrace Armstrong. Poor man, I am very doubtfu\u0092 o\u0092 his condition; but I\nam sure he is as kind to me as if I were his son, and a queer-looking\nfather I wad hae had, if that had been e\u0092en sae.\u0094\n\nHobbie now relieved his benefactor of his presence, and rode blithely\nhome to display his treasure, and consult upon the means of repairing\nthe damage which his fortune had sustained through the aggression of the\nRed Reiver of Westburnflat.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n     Three ruffians seized me yester morn,\n     Alas!  a maiden most forlorn;\n     They choked my cries with wicked might,\n     And bound me on a palfrey white:\n     As sure as Heaven shall pity me,\n     I cannot tell what men they be.--CHRISTABELLE.\n\nThe course of our story must here revert a little, to detail the\ncircumstances which had placed Miss Vere in the unpleasant situation\nfrom which she was unexpectedly, and indeed unintentionally liberated,\nby the appearance of Earnscliff and Elliot, with their friends and\nfollowers, before the Tower of Westburnflat.\n\nOn the morning preceding the night in which Hobbie\u0092s house was plundered\nand burnt, Miss Vere was requested by her father to accompany him in a\nwalk through a distant part of the romantic grounds which lay round\nhis castle of Ellieslaw. \u0093To hear was to obey,\u0094 in the true style of\nOriental despotism; but Isabella trembled in silence while she followed\nher father through rough paths, now winding by the side of the river,\nnow ascending the cliffs which serve for its banks. A single servant,\nselected perhaps for his stupidity, was the only person who attended\nthem. From her father\u0092s silence, Isabella little doubted that he had\nchosen this distant and sequestered scene to resume the argument which\nthey had so frequently maintained upon the subject of Sir Frederick\u0092s\naddresses, and that he was meditating in what manner he should most\neffectually impress upon her the necessity of receiving him as her\nsuitor. But her fears seemed for some time to be unfounded. The only\nsentences which her father from time to time addressed to her, respected\nthe beauties of the romantic landscape through which they strolled, and\nwhich varied its features at every step. To these observations, although\nthey seemed to come from a heart occupied by more gloomy as well as more\nimportant cares, Isabella endeavoured to answer in a manner as free and\nunconstrained as it was possible for her to assume, amid the involuntary\napprehensions which crowded upon her imagination.\n\nSustaining with mutual difficulty a desultory conversation, they at\nlength gained the centre of a small wood, composed of large oaks,\nintermingled with birches, mountain-ashes, hazel, holly, and a variety\nof underwood. The boughs of the tall trees met closely above, and the\nunderwood filled up each interval between their trunks below. The spot\non which they stood was rather more open; still, however, embowered\nunder the natural arcade of tall trees, and darkened on the sides for a\nspace around by a great and lively growth of copse-wood and bushes.\n\n\u0093And here, Isabella,\u0094 said Mr. Vere, as he pursued the conversation,\nso often resumed, so often dropped, \u0093here I would erect an altar to\nFriendship.\u0094\n\n\u0093To Friendship, sir!\u0094 said Miss Vere; \u0093and why on this gloomy and\nsequestered spot, rather than elsewhere?\u0094\n\n\u0093O, the propriety of the LOCALE is easily vindicated,\u0094 replied her\nfather, with a sneer. \u0093You know, Miss Vere (for you, I am well aware,\nare a learned young lady), you know, that the Romans were not satisfied\nwith embodying, for the purpose of worship, each useful quality and\nmoral virtue to which they could give a name; but they, moreover,\nworshipped the same under each variety of titles and attributes which\ncould give a distinct shade, or individual character, to the virtue in\nquestion. Now, for example, the Friendship to whom a temple should be\nhere dedicated, is not Masculine Friendship, which abhors and despises\nduplicity, art, and disguise; but Female Friendship, which consists in\nlittle else than a mutual disposition on the part of the friends, as\nthey call themselves, to abet each other in obscure fraud and petty\nintrigue.\u0094\n\n\u0093You are severe, sir,\u0094 said Miss Vere.\n\n\u0093Only just,\u0094 said her father; \u0093a humble copier I am from nature, with\nthe advantage of contemplating two such excellent studies as Lucy\nIlderton and yourself.\u0094\n\n\u0093If I have been unfortunate enough to offend, sir, I can conscientiously\nexcuse Miss Ilderton from being either my counsellor or confidante.\u0094\n\n\u0093Indeed! how came you, then,\u0094 said Mr. Vere, \u0093by the flippancy of\nspeech, and pertness of argument, by which you have disgusted Sir\nFrederick, and given me of late such deep offence?\u0094\n\n\u0093If my manner has been so unfortunate as to displease you, sir, it\nis impossible for me to apologize too deeply, or too sincerely; but I\ncannot confess the same contrition for having answered Sir Frederick\nflippantly when he pressed me rudely. Since he forgot I was a lady, it\nwas time to show him that I am at least a woman.\u0094\n\n\u0093Reserve, then, your pertness for those who press you on the topic,\nIsabella,\u0094 said her father coldly; \u0093for my part, I am weary of the\nsubject, and will never speak upon it again.\u0094\n\n\u0093God bless you, my dear father,\u0094 said Isabella, seizing his reluctant\nhand \u0093there is nothing you can impose on me, save the task of listening\nto this man\u0092s persecution, that I will call, or think, a hardship.\u0094\n\n\u0093You are very obliging, Miss Vere, when it happens to suit you to be\ndutiful,\u0094 said her unrelenting father, forcing himself at the same time\nfrom the affectionate grasp of her hand; \u0093but henceforward, child, I\nshall save myself the trouble of offering you unpleasant advice on any\ntopic. You must look to yourself.\u0094\n\nAt this moment four ruffians rushed upon them. Mr. Vere and his servant\ndrew their hangers, which it was the fashion of the time to wear, and\nattempted to defend themselves and protect Isabella. But while each of\nthem was engaged by an antagonist, she was forced into the thicket by\nthe two remaining villains, who placed her and themselves on horses\nwhich stood ready behind the copse-wood. They mounted at the same time,\nand, placing her between them, set of at a round gallop, holding the\nreins of her horse on each side. By many an obscure and winding path,\nover dale and down, through moss and moor, she was conveyed to the tower\nof Westburnflat, where she remained strictly watched, but not otherwise\nill-treated, under the guardianship of the old woman, to whose son that\nretreat belonged. No entreaties could prevail upon the hag to give Miss\nVere any information on the object of her being carried forcibly off,\nand confined in this secluded place. The arrival of Earnscliff, with a\nstrong party of horsemen, before the tower, alarmed the robber. As he\nhad already directed Grace Armstrong to be restored to her friends, it\ndid not occur to him that this unwelcome visit was on her account; and\nseeing at the head of the party, Earnscliff, whose attachment to Miss\nVere was whispered in the country, he doubted not that her liberation\nwas the sole object of the attack upon his fastness. The dread of\npersonal consequences compelled him to deliver up his prisoner in the\nmanner we have already related.\n\nAt the moment the tramp of horses was heard which carried off the\ndaughter of Ellieslaw, her father fell to the earth, and his servant, a\nstout young fellow, who was gaining ground on the ruffian with whom he\nhad been engaged, left the combat to come to his master\u0092s assistance,\nlittle doubting that he had received a mortal wound, Both the villains\nimmediately desisted from farther combat, and, retreating into the\nthicket, mounted their horses, and went off at full speed after their\ncompanions. Meantime, Dixon had the satisfaction to find Mr. Vere not\nonly alive, but unwounded. He had overreached himself, and stumbled,\nit seemed, over the root of a tree, in making too eager a blow at his\nantagonist. The despair he felt at his daughter\u0092s disappearance, was, in\nDixon\u0092s phrase, such as would have melted the heart of a whin stane, and\nhe was so much exhausted by his feelings, and the vain researches which\nhe made to discover the track of the ravishers, that a considerable\ntime elapsed ere he reached home, and communicated the alarm to his\ndomestics.\n\nAll his conduct and gestures were those of a desperate man.\n\n\u0093Speak not to me, Sir Frederick,\u0094 he said impatiently; \u0093You are no\nfather--she was my child, an ungrateful one! I fear, but still my\nchild--my only child. Where is Miss Ilderton? she must know something of\nthis. It corresponds with what I was informed of her schemes. Go, Dixon,\ncall Ratcliffe here Let him come without a minute\u0092s delay.\u0094 The person\nhe had named at this moment entered the room.\n\n\u0093I say, Dixon,\u0094 continued Mr. Vere, in an altered tone, \u0093let Mr.\nRatcliffe know, I beg the favour of his company on particular\nbusiness.--Ah! my dear sir,\u0094 he proceeded, as if noticing him for the\nfirst time, \u0093you are the very man whose advice can be of the utmost\nservice to me in this cruel extremity.\u0094\n\n\u0093What has happened, Mr. Vere, to discompose you?\u0094 said Mr, Ratcliffe,\ngravely; and while the Laird of Ellieslaw details to him, with the most\nanimated gestures of grief and indignation, the singular adventure of\nthe morning, we shall take the opportunity to inform our readers of the\nrelative circumstances in which these gentlemen stood to each other.\n\nIn early youth, Mr. Vere of Ellieslaw had been remarkable for a career\nof dissipation, which, in advanced life, he had exchanged for the no\nless destructive career of dark and turbulent ambition. In both\ncases, he had gratified the predominant passion without respect to the\ndiminution of his private fortune, although, where such inducements\nwere wanting, he was deemed close, avaricious, and grasping. His affairs\nbeing much embarrassed by his earlier extravagance, he went to England,\nwhere he was understood to have formed a very advantageous matrimonial\nconnexion. He was many years absent from his family estate. Suddenly and\nunexpectedly he returned a widower, bringing with him his daughter,\nthen a girl of about ten years old. From this moment his expense\nseemed unbounded, in the eyes of the simple inhabitants of his native\nmountains. It was supposed he must necessarily have plunged himself\ndeeply in debt. Yet he continued to live in the same lavish expense,\nuntil some months before the commencement of our narrative, when the\npublic opinion of his embarrassed circumstances was confirmed, by\nthe residence of Mr. Ratcliffe at Ellieslaw Castle, who, by the tacit\nconsent, though obviously to the great displeasure, of the lord of the\nmansion, seemed, from the moment of his arrival, to assume and exercise\na predominant and unaccountable influence in the management of his\nprivate affairs.\n\nMr. Ratcliffe was a grave, steady, reserved man, in an advanced period\nof life. To those with whom he had occasion to speak upon business, he\nappeared uncommonly well versed in all its forms. With others he held\nlittle communication; but in any casual intercourse, or conversation,\ndisplayed the powers of an active and well-informed mind. For some\ntime before taking up his final residence at the castle, he had been\nan occasional visitor there, and was at such times treated by Mr. Vere\n(contrary to his general practice towards those who were inferior to\nhim in rank) with marked attention, and even deference. Yet his arrival\nalways appeared to be an embarrassment to his host, and his departure a\nrelief; so that, when he became a constant inmate of the family, it was\nimpossible not to observe indications of the displeasure with which Mr.\nVere regarded his presence. Indeed, their intercourse formed a singular\nmixture of confidence and constraint. Mr. Vere\u0092s most important affairs\nwere regulated by Mr. Ratcliffe; and although he was none of those\nindulgent men of fortune, who, too indolent to manage their own\nbusiness, are glad to devolve it upon another, yet, in many instances,\nhe was observed to give up his own judgment, and submit to the contrary\nopinions which Mr. Ratcliffe did not hesitate distinctly to express.\n\nNothing seemed to vex Mr. Vere more than when strangers indicated any\nobservation of the state of tutelage under which he appeared to labour.\nWhen it was noticed by Sir Frederick, or any of his intimates, he\nsometimes repelled their remarks haughtily and indignantly, and\nsometimes endeavoured to evade them, by saying, with a forced laugh,\n\u0093That Ratcliffe knew his own importance, but that he was the most honest\nand skilful fellow in the world; and that it would be impossible for him\nto manage his English affairs without his advice and assistance.\u0094 Such\nwas the person who entered the room at the moment Mr. Vere was summoning\nhim to his presence, and who now heard with surprise, mingled with\nobvious incredulity, the hasty narrative of what had befallen Isabella.\n\nHer father concluded, addressing Sir Frederick and the other gentlemen,\nwho stood around in astonishment, \u0093And now, my friends, you see the most\nunhappy father in Scotland. Lend me your assistance, gentlemen--give me\nyour advice, Mr. Ratcliffe. I am incapable of acting, or thinking, under\nthe unexpected violence of such a blow.\u0094\n\n\u0093Let us take our horses, call our attendants, and scour the country in\npursuit of the villains,\u0094 said Sir Frederick.\n\n\u0093Is there no one whom you can suspect,\u0094 said Ratcliffe, gravely, \u0093of\nhaving some motive for this strange crime? These are not the days of\nromance, when ladies are carried off merely for their beauty.\u0094\n\n\u0093I fear,\u0094 said Mr. Vere, \u0093I can too well account for this strange\nincident. Read this letter, which Miss Lucy Ilderton thought fit to\naddress from my house of Ellieslaw to young Mr. Earnscliff; whom, of all\nmen, I have a hereditary right to call my enemy. You see she writes\nto him as the confidant of a passion which he has the assurance to\nentertain for my daughter; tells him she serves his cause with her\nfriend very ardently, but that he has a friend in the garrison who\nserves him yet more effectually. Look particularly at the pencilled\npassages, Mr. Ratcliffe, where this meddling girl recommends bold\nmeasures, with an assurance that his suit would be successful anywhere\nbeyond the bounds of the barony of Ellieslaw.\u0094\n\n\u0093And you argue, from this romantic letter of a very romantic young lady,\nMr. Vere,\u0094 said Ratcliffe, \u0093that young Earnscliff has carried off your\ndaughter, and committed a very great and criminal act of violence, on no\nbetter advice and assurance than that of Miss Lucy Ilderton?\u0094\n\n\u0093What else can I think?\u0094 said Ellieslaw.\n\n\u0093What else CAN you think?\u0094 said Sir Frederick; \u0093or who else could have\nany motive for committing such a crime?\u0094\n\n\u0093Were that the best mode of fixing the guilt,\u0094 said Mr. Ratcliffe,\ncalmly, \u0093there might easily be pointed out persons to whom such actions\nare more congenial, and who have also sufficient motives of instigation.\nSupposing it were judged advisable to remove Miss Vere to some place in\nwhich constraint might be exercised upon her inclinations to a degree\nwhich cannot at present be attempted under the roof of Ellieslaw\nCastle--What says Sir Frederick Langley to that supposition?\u0094\n\n\u0093I say,\u0094 returned Sir Frederick, \u0093that although Mr. Vere may choose to\nendure in Mr. Ratcliffe freedoms totally inconsistent with his situation\nin life, I will not permit such license of innuendo, by word or look, to\nbe extended to me, with impunity.\u0094\n\n\u0093And I say,\u0094 said young Mareschal of Mareschal-Wells, who was also\na guest at the castle, \u0093that you are all stark mad to be standing\nwrangling here, instead of going in pursuit of the ruffians.\u0094\n\n\u0093I have ordered off the domestics already in the track most likely to\novertake them,\u0094 said Mr. Vere \u0093if you will favour me with your company,\nwe will follow them, and assist in the search.\u0094\n\nThe efforts of the party were totally unsuccessful, probably because\nEllieslaw directed the pursuit to proceed in the direction of Earnscliff\nTower, under the supposition that the owner would prove to be the\nauthor of the violence, so that they followed a direction diametrically\nopposite to that in which the ruffians had actually proceeded. In the\nevening they returned, harassed and out of spirits. But other guests\nhad, in the meanwhile, arrived at the castle; and, after the recent loss\nsustained by the owner had been related, wondered at, and lamented, the\nrecollection of it was, for the present, drowned in the discussion\nof deep political intrigues, of which the crisis and explosion were\nmomentarily looked for.\n\nSeveral of the gentlemen who took part in this divan were Catholics, and\nall of them stanch Jacobites, whose hopes were at present at the highest\npitch, as an invasion, in favour of the Pretender, was daily expected\nfrom France, which Scotland, between the defenceless state of its\ngarrisons and fortified places, and the general disaffection of the\ninhabitants, was rather prepared to welcome than to resist. Ratcliffe,\nwho neither sought to assist at their consultations on this subject,\nnor was invited to do so, had, in the meanwhile, retired to his own\napartment. Miss Ilderton was sequestered from society in a sort of\nhonourable confinement, \u0093until,\u0094 said Mr. Vere, \u0093she should be safely\nconveyed home to her father\u0092s house,\u0094 an opportunity for which occurred\non the following day.\n\nThe domestics could not help thinking it remarkable how soon the loss of\nMiss Vere, and the strange manner in which it had happened, seemed to be\nforgotten by the other guests at the castle. They knew not, that those\nthe most interested in her fate were well acquainted with the cause\nof her being carried off, and the place of her retreat; and that the\nothers, in the anxious and doubtful moments which preceded the breaking\nforth of a conspiracy, were little accessible to any feelings but what\narose immediately out of their own machinations.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\n     Some one way, some another--Do you know\n     Where we may apprehend her?\n\nThe researches after Miss Vere were (for the sake of appearances,\nperhaps) resumed on the succeeding day, with similar bad success, and\nthe party were returning towards Ellieslaw in the evening.\n\n\u0093It is singular,\u0094 said Mareschal to Ratcliffe, \u0093that four horsemen and\na female prisoner should have passed through the country without leaving\nthe slightest trace of their passage. One would think they had traversed\nthe air, or sunk through the ground.\u0094\n\n\u0093Men may often,\u0094 answered Ratcliffe, \u0093arrive at the knowledge of that\nwhich is, from discovering that which is not. We have now scoured every\nroad, path, and track leading from the castle, in all the various points\nof the compass, saving only that intricate and difficult pass which\nleads southward down the Westburn, and through the morasses.\u0094\n\n\u0093And why have we not examined that?\u0094 said Mareschal.\n\n\u0093O, Mr. Vere can best answer that question,\u0094 replied his companion,\ndryly.\n\n\u0093Then I will ask it instantly,\u0094 said Mareschal; and, addressing Mr.\nVere, \u0093I am informed, sir,\u0094 said he, \u0093there is a path we have not\nexamined, leading by Westburnflat.\u0094\n\n\u0093O,\u0094 said Sir Frederick, laughing, \u0093we know the owner of Westburnflat\nwell--a wild lad, that knows little difference between his neighbour\u0092s\ngoods and his own; but, withal, very honest to his principles: he would\ndisturb nothing belonging to Ellieslaw.\u0094\n\n\u0093Besides,\u0094 said Mr. Vere, smiling mysteriously, \u0093he had other tow on his\ndistaff last night. Have you not heard young Elliot of the Heugh-foot\nhas had his house burnt, and his cattle driven away, because he refused\nto give up his arms to some honest men that think of starting for the\nking?\u0094\n\nThe company smiled upon each other, as at hearing of an exploit which\nfavoured their own views.\n\n\u0093Yet, nevertheless,\u0094 resumed Mareschal, \u0093I think we ought to ride in\nthis direction also, otherwise we shall certainly be blamed for our\nnegligence.\u0094\n\nNo reasonable objection could be offered to this proposal, and the party\nturned their horses\u0092 heads towards Westburnflat.\n\nThey had not proceeded very far in that direction when the trampling of\nhorses was heard, and a small body of riders were perceived advancing to\nmeet them.\n\n\u0093There comes Earnscliff,\u0094 said Mareschal; \u0093I know his bright bay with\nthe star in his front.\u0094\n\n\u0093And there is my daughter along with him,\u0094 exclaimed Vere,\nfuriously. \u0093Who shall call my suspicions false or injurious now?\nGentlemen--friends--lend me the assistance of your swords for the\nrecovery of my child.\u0094\n\nHe unsheathed his weapon, and was imitated by Sir Frederick and several\nof the party, who prepared to charge those that were advancing towards\nthem. But the greater part hesitated.\n\n\u0093They come to us in all peace and security,\u0094 said Mareschal-Wells; \u0093let\nus first hear what account they give us of this mysterious affair. If\nMiss Vere has sustained the slightest insult or injury from Earnscliff,\nI will be first to revenge her; but let us hear what they say.\u0094\n\n\u0093You do me wrong by your suspicions, Mareschal,\u0094 continued Vere; \u0093you\nare the last I would have expected to hear express them.\u0094\n\n\u0093You injure yourself, Ellieslaw, by your violence, though the cause may\nexcuse it.\u0094\n\nHe then advanced a little before the rest, and called out, with a loud\nvoice,--\u0093Stand, Mr. Earnscliff; or do you and Miss Vere advance alone\nto meet us. You are charged with having carried that lady off from her\nfather\u0092s house; and we are here in arms to shed our best blood for her\nrecovery, and for bringing to justice those who have injured her.\u0094\n\n\u0093And who would do that more willingly than I, Mr. Mareschal?\u0094 said\nEarnscliff, haughtily,--\u0093than I, who had the satisfaction this morning\nto liberate her from the dungeon in which I found her confined, and who\nam now escorting her back to the Castle of Ellieslaw?\u0094\n\n\u0093Is this so, Miss Vere?\u0094 said Mareschal.\n\n\u0093It is,\u0094 answered Isabella, eagerly,--\u0093it is so; for Heaven\u0092s sake\nsheathe your swords. I will swear by all that is sacred, that I was\ncarried off by ruffians, whose persons and object were alike unknown to\nme, and am now restored to freedom by means of this gentleman\u0092s gallant\ninterference.\u0094\n\n\u0093By whom, and wherefore, could this have been done?\u0094 pursued\nMareschal.--\u0093Had you no knowledge of the place to which you were\nconveyed?--Earnscliff, where did you find this lady?\u0094\n\nBut ere either question could be answered, Ellieslaw advanced, and,\nreturning his sword to the scabbard, cut short the conference.\n\n\u0093When I know,\u0094 he said, \u0093exactly how much I owe to Mr. Earnscliff, he\nmay rely on suitable acknowledgments; meantime,\u0094 taking the bridle of\nMiss Vere\u0092s horse, \u0093thus far I thank him for replacing my daughter in\nthe power of her natural guardian.\u0094\n\nA sullen bend of the head was returned by Earnscliff with equal\nhaughtiness; and Ellieslaw, turning back with his daughter upon the road\nto his own house, appeared engaged with her in a conference so\nearnest, that the rest of the company judged it improper to intrude by\napproaching them too nearly. In the meantime, Earnscliff, as he took\nleave of the other gentlemen belonging to Ellieslaw\u0092s party, said aloud,\n\u0093Although I am unconscious of any circumstance in my conduct that can\nauthorize such a suspicion, I cannot but observe, that Mr. Vere seems\nto believe that I have had some hand in the atrocious violence which has\nbeen offered to his daughter. I request you, gentlemen, to take notice\nof my explicit denial of a charge so dishonourable; and that, although\nI can pardon the bewildering feelings of a father in such a moment,\nyet, if any other gentleman,\u0094 (he looked hard at Sir Frederick Langley)\n\u0093thinks my word and that of Miss Vere, with the evidence of my friends\nwho accompany me, too slight for my exculpation, I will be happy--most\nhappy--to repel the charge, as becomes a man who counts his honour\ndearer than his life.\u0094\n\n\u0093And I\u0092ll be his second,\u0094 said Simon of Hackburn, \u0093and take up ony twa\no\u0092 ye, gentle or semple, laird or loon; it\u0092s a\u0092 ane to Simon.\u0094\n\n\u0093Who is that rough-looking fellow?\u0094 said Sir Frederick Langley, \u0093and\nwhat has he to do with the quarrels of gentlemen?\u0094\n\n\u0093I\u0092se be a lad frae the Hie Te\u0092iot,\u0094 said Simon, \u0093and I\u0092se quarrel wi\u0092\nony body I like, except the king, or the laird I live under.\u0094\n\n\u0093Come,\u0094 said; Mareschal, \u0093let us have no brawls.--Mr. Earnscliff;\nalthough we do not think alike in some things, I trust we may be\nopponents, even enemies, if fortune will have it so, without losing our\nrespect for birth, fair-play, and each other. I believe you as innocent\nof this matter as I am myself; and I will pledge myself that my cousin\nEllieslaw, as soon as the perplexity attending these sudden events has\nleft his judgment to its free exercise, shall handsomely acknowledge the\nvery important service you have this day rendered him.\u0094\n\n\u0093To have served your cousin is a sufficient reward in itself--Good\nevening, gentlemen,\u0094 continued Earnscliff; \u0093I see most of your party are\nalready on their way to Ellieslaw.\u0094\n\nThen saluting Mareschal with courtesy, and the rest of the party\nwith indifference, Earnscliff turned his horse and rode towards\nthe Heugh-foot, to concert measures with Hobbie Elliot for farther\nresearches after his bride, of whose restoration to her friends he was\nstill ignorant.\n\n\u0093There he goes,\u0094 said Mareschal; \u0093he is a fine, gallant young fellow,\nupon my soul; and yet I should like well to have a thrust with him on\nthe green turf. I was reckoned at college nearly his equal with the\nfoils, and I should like to try him at sharps.\u0094\n\n\u0093In my opinion,\u0094 answered Sir Frederick Langley, \u0093we have done very\nill in having suffered him, and those men who are with him, to go off\nwithout taking away their arms; for the Whigs are very likely to draw to\na head under such a sprightly young fellow as that.\u0094\n\n\u0093For shame, Sir Frederick!\u0094 exclaimed Mareschal; \u0093do you think that\nEllieslaw could, in honour, consent to any violence being offered to\nEarnscliff; when he entered his bounds only to bring back his daughter?\nor, if he were to be of your opinion, do you think that I, and the rest\nof these gentlemen, would disgrace ourselves by assisting in such a\ntransaction? No, no, fair play and auld Scotland for ever! When the\nsword is drawn, I will be as ready to use it as any man; but while it is\nin the sheath, let us behave like gentlemen and neighbours.\u0094\n\nSoon after this colloquy they reached the castle, when Ellieslaw, who\nhad been arrived a few minutes before, met them in the court-yard.\n\n\u0093How is Miss Vere? and have you learned the cause of her being carried\noff?\u0094 asked Mareschal hastily.\n\n\u0093She is retired to her apartment greatly fatigued; and I cannot expect\nmuch light upon her adventure till her spirits are somewhat recruited,\u0094\n replied her father. \u0093She and I were not the less obliged to you,\nMareschal, and to my other friends, for their kind enquiries. But I must\nsuppress the father\u0092s feelings for a while to give myself up to those of\nthe patriot. You know this is the day fixed for our final decision--time\npresses--our friends are arriving, and I have opened house, not only\nfor the gentry, but for the under spur-leathers whom we must necessarily\nemploy. We have, therefore, little time to prepare to meet them.--Look\nover these lists, Marchie (an abbreviation by which Mareschal-Wells was\nknown among his friends). Do you, Sir Frederick, read these letters from\nLothian and the west--all is ripe for the sickle, and we have but to\nsummon out the reapers.\u0094\n\n\u0093With all my heart,\u0094 said Mareschal; \u0093the more mischief the better\nsport.\u0094\n\nSir Frederick looked grave and disconcerted.\n\n\u0093Walk aside with me, my good friend,\u0094 said Ellieslaw to the sombre\nbaronet; \u0093I have something for your private ear, with which I know you\nwill be gratified.\u0094\n\nThey walked into the house, leaving Ratcliffe and Mareschal standing\ntogether in the court.\n\n\u0093And so,\u0094 said Ratcliffe, \u0093the gentlemen of your political persuasion\nthink the downfall of this government so certain, that they disdain even\nto throw a decent disguise over the machinations of their party?\u0094\n\n\u0093Faith, Mr. Ratcliffe,\u0094 answered Mareschal, \u0093the actions and sentiments\nYOUR friends may require to be veiled, but I am better pleased that ours\ncan go barefaced.\u0094\n\n\u0093And is it possible,\u0094 continued Ratcliffe, \u0093that you, who,\nnotwithstanding pour thoughtlessness and heat of temper (I beg pardon,\nMr. Mareschal, I am a plain man)--that you, who, notwithstanding\nthese constitutional defects, possess natural good sense and acquired\ninformation, should be infatuated enough to embroil yourself in such\ndesperate proceedings? How does your head feel when you are engaged in\nthese dangerous conferences?\u0094\n\n\u0093Not quite so secure on my shoulders,\u0094 answered Mareschal, \u0093as if I were\ntalking of hunting and hawking. I am not of so indifferent a mould as\nmy cousin Ellieslaw, who speaks treason as if it were a child\u0092s nursery\nrhymes, and loses and recovers that sweet girl, his daughter, with a\ngood deal less emotion on both occasions, than would have affected me\nhad I lost and recovered a greyhound puppy. My temper is not quite so\ninflexible, nor my hate against government so inveterate, as to blind me\nto the full danger of the attempt.\u0094\n\n\u0093Then why involve yourself in it?\u0094 said Ratcliffe.\n\n\u0093Why, I love this poor exiled king with all my heart; and my father was\nan old Killiecrankie man, and I long to see some amends on the Unionist\ncourtiers, that have bought and sold old Scotland, whose crown has been\nso long independent.\u0094\n\n\u0093And for the sake of these shadows,\u0094 said his monitor, \u0093you are going to\ninvolve your country in war and yourself in trouble?\u0094\n\n\u0093I involve? No!--but, trouble for trouble, I had rather it came\nto-morrow than a month hence. COME, I know it will; and, as your country\nfolks say, better soon than syne--it will never find me younger--and as\nfor hanging, as Sir John Falstaff says, I can become a gallows as well\nas another. You know the end of the old ballad;\n\n     \u0093Sae dauntonly, sae wantonly,\n     Sae rantingly gaed he,\n     He play\u0092d a spring, and danced a round,\n     Beneath the gallows tree.\u0094\n\n\u0093Mr. Mareschal, I am sorry for you,\u0094 said his grave adviser.\n\n\u0093I am obliged to you, Mr. Ratcliffe; but I would not have you judge of\nour enterprise by my way of vindicating it; there are wiser heads than\nmine at the work.\u0094\n\n\u0093Wiser heads than yours may lie as low,\u0094 said Ratcliffe, in a warning\ntone.\n\n\u0093Perhaps so; but no lighter heart shall; and, to prevent it being made\nheavier by your remonstrances, I will bid you adieu, Mr. Ratcliffe, till\ndinner-time, when you shall see that my apprehensions have not spoiled\nmy appetite.\u0094\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\n     To face the garment of rebellion\n     With some fine colour, that may please the eye\n     Of fickle changelings, and poor discontents,\n     Which gape and rub the elbow at the news\n     Of hurlyburly innovation.--HENRY THE FOURTH, PART II.\n\nThere had been great preparations made at Ellieslaw Castle for the\nentertainment on this important day, when not only the gentlemen of note\nin the neighbourhood, attached to the Jacobite interest, were expected\nto rendezvous, but also many subordinate malecontents, whom difficulty\nof circumstances, love of change, resentment against England, or any of\nthe numerous causes which inflamed men\u0092s passions at the time, rendered\napt to join in perilous enterprise. The men of rank and substance were\nnot many in number; for almost all the large proprietors stood aloof,\nand most of the smaller gentry and yeomanry were of the Presbyterian\npersuasion, and therefore, however displeased with the Union, unwilling\nto engage in a Jacobite conspiracy. But there were some gentlemen of\nproperty, who, either from early principle, from religious motives, or\nsharing the ambitious views of Ellieslaw, had given countenance to his\nscheme; and there were, also, some fiery young men, like Mareschal,\ndesirous of signalizing themselves by engaging in a dangerous\nenterprise, by which they hoped to vindicate the independence of their\ncountry. The other members of the party were persons of inferior rank\nand desperate fortunes, who were now ready to rise in that part of the\ncountry, as they did afterwards in the year 1715, under Forster and\nDerwentwater, when a troop, commanded by a Border gentleman, named\nDouglas, consisted almost entirely of freebooters, among whom the\nnotorious Luck-in-a-bag, as he was called, held a distinguished command.\nWe think it necessary to mention these particulars, applicable solely\nto the province in which our scene lies; because, unquestionably, the\nJacobite party, in the other parts of the kingdom, consisted of much\nmore formidable, as well as much more respectable, materials.\n\nOne long table extended itself down the ample hall of Ellieslaw Castle,\nwhich was still left much in the state in which it had been one hundred\nyears before, stretching, that is, in gloomy length, along the whole\nside of the castle, vaulted with ribbed arches of freestone, the groins\nof which sprung from projecting figures, that, carved into all the\nwild forms which the fantastic imagination of a Gothic architect could\ndevise, grinned, frowned, and gnashed their tusks at the assembly below.\nLong narrow windows lighted the banqueting room on both sides, filled\nup with stained glass, through which the sun emitted a dusky and\ndiscoloured light. A banner, which tradition averred to have been taken\nfrom the English at the battle of Sark, waved over the chair in which\nEllieslaw presided, as if to inflame the courage of the guests, by\nreminding them of ancient victories over their neighbours. He himself,\na portly figure, dressed on this occasion with uncommon care, and with\nfeatures, which, though of a stern and sinister expression, might well\nbe termed handsome, looked the old feudal baron extremely well. Sir\nFrederick Langley was placed on his right hand, and Mr. Mareschal of\nMareschal-Wells on his left. Some gentlemen of consideration, with their\nsons, brothers, and nephews, were seated at the upper end of the table,\nand among these Mr. Ratcliffe had his place. Beneath the salt-cellar (a\nmassive piece of plate which occupied the midst of the table) sate the\nSINE NOMINE TURBA, men whose vanity was gratified by holding even this\nsubordinate space at the social board, while the distinction observed in\nranking them was a salve to the pride of their superiors. That the lower\nhouse was not very select must be admitted, since Willie of Westburnflat\nwas one of the party. The unabashed audacity of this fellow, in daring\nto present himself in the house of a gentleman, to whom he had just\noffered so flagrant an insult, can only be accounted for by supposing\nhim conscious that his share in carrying off Miss Vere was a secret,\nsafe in her possession and that of her father.\n\nBefore this numerous and miscellaneous party was placed a dinner,\nconsisting, not indeed of the delicacies of the season, as the\nnewspapers express it, but of viands, ample, solid, and sumptuous, under\nwhich the very board groaned. But the mirth was not in proportion to the\ngood cheer. The lower end of the table were, for some time, chilled by\nconstraint and respect on finding themselves members of so august an\nassembly; and those who were placed around it had those feelings of awe\nwith which P. P., clerk of the parish, describes himself oppressed,\nwhen he first uplifted the psalm in presence of those persons of high\nworship, the wise Mr. Justice Freeman, the good Lady Jones, and the\ngreat Sir Thomas Truby. This ceremonious frost, however, soon gave way\nbefore the incentives to merriment, which were liberally supplied,\nand as liberally consumed by the guests of the lower description. They\nbecame talkative, loud, and even clamorous in their mirth.\n\nBut it was not in the power of wine or brandy to elevate the spirits of\nthose who held the higher places at the banquet. They experienced the\nchilling revulsion of spirits which often takes place, when men\nare called upon to take a desperate resolution, after having placed\nthemselves in circumstances where it is alike difficult to advance or\nto recede. The precipice looked deeper and more dangerous as they\napproached the brink, and each waited with an inward emotion of awe,\nexpecting which of his confederates would set the example by plunging\nhimself down. This inward sensation of fear and reluctance acted\ndifferently, according to the various habits and characters of the\ncompany. One looked grave; another looked silly; a third gazed with\napprehension on the empty seats at the higher end of the table, designed\nfor members of the conspiracy whose prudence had prevailed over their\npolitical zeal, and who had absented themselves from their consultations\nat this critical period; and some seemed to be reckoning up in their\nminds the comparative rank and prospects of those who were present and\nabsent. Sir Frederick Langley was reserved, moody, and discontented.\nEllieslaw himself made such forced efforts to raise the spirits of the\ncompany, as plainly marked the flagging of his own. Ratcliffe watched\nthe scene with the composure of a vigilant but uninterested spectator.\nMareschal alone, true to the thoughtless vivacity of his character, ate\nand drank, laughed and jested, and seemed even to find amusement in the\nembarrassment of the company.\n\n\u0093What has damped our noble courage this morning?\u0094 he exclaimed. \u0093We seem\nto be met at a funeral, where the chief mourners must not speak above\ntheir breath, while the mutes and the saulies (looking to the lower end\nof the table) are carousing below. Ellieslaw, when will you LIFT?\n[To LIFT, meaning to lift the coffin, is the common expression for\ncommencing a funeral.] where sleeps your spirit, man? and what has\nquelled the high hope of the Knight of Langley-dale?\u0094\n\n\u0093You speak like a madman,\u0094 said Ellieslaw; \u0093do you not see how many are\nabsent?\u0094\n\n\u0093And what of that?\u0094 said Mareschal. \u0093Did you not know before, that\none-half of the world are better talkers than doers? For my part, I am\nmuch encouraged by seeing at least two-thirds of our friends true to the\nrendezvous, though I suspect one-half of these came to secure the dinner\nin case of the worst.\u0094\n\n\u0093There is no news from the coast which can amount to certainty of the\nKing\u0092s arrival,\u0094 said another of the company, in that tone of subdued\nand tremulous whisper which implies a failure of resolution.\n\n\u0093Not a line from the Earl of D--, nor a single gentleman from the\nsouthern side of the Border,\u0094 said a third.\n\n\u0093Who is he that wishes for more men from England,\u0094 exclaimed Mareschal,\nin a theatrical tone of affected heroism,\n\n     \u0093My cousin Ellieslaw?  No, my fair cousin,\n     If we are doom\u0092d to die--\u0094\n\n\u0093For God\u0092s sake,\u0094 said Ellieslaw, \u0093spare us your folly at present,\nMareschal.\u0094\n\n\u0093Well, then,\u0094 said his kinsman, \u0093I\u0092ll bestow my wisdom upon you instead,\nsuch as it is. If we have gone forward like fools, do not let us go back\nlike cowards. We have done enough to draw upon us both the suspicion and\nvengeance of the government; do not let us give up before we have done\nsomething to deserve it.--What, will no one speak? Then I\u0092ll leap the\nditch the first.\u0094 And, starting up, he filled a beer-glass to the brim\nwith claret, and waving his hand, commanded all to follow his example,\nand to rise up from their seats. All obeyed-the more qualified guests as\nif passively, the others with enthusiasm \u0093Then, my friends, I give you\nthe pledge of the day--The independence of Scotland, and the health of\nour lawful sovereign, King James the Eighth, now landed in Lothian, and,\nas I trust and believe, in full possession of his ancient capital!\u0094\n\nHe quaffed off the wine, and threw the glass over his head.\n\n\u0093It should never,\u0094 he said, \u0093be profaned by a meaner toast.\u0094\n\nAll followed his example, and, amid the crash of glasses and the shouts\nof the company, pledged themselves to stand or fall with the principles\nand political interest which their toast expressed.\n\n\u0093You have leaped the ditch with a witness,\u0094 said Ellieslaw, apart to\nMareschal; \u0093but I believe it is all for the best; at all events, we\ncannot now retreat from our undertaking. One man alone\u0094 (looking at\nRatcliffe) \u0093has refused the pledge; but of that by and by.\u0094\n\nThen, rising up, he addressed the company in a style of inflammatory\ninvective against the government and its measures, but especially the\nUnion; a treaty, by means of which, he affirmed, Scotland had been at\nonce cheated of her independence, her commerce, and her honour, and laid\nas a fettered slave at the foot of the rival against whom, through such\na length of ages, through so many dangers, and by so much blood, she had\nhonourably defended her rights. This was touching a theme which found a\nresponsive chord in the bosom of every man present.\n\n\u0093Our commerce is destroyed,\u0094 hollowed old John Rewcastle, a Jedburgh\nsmuggler, from the lower end of the table.\n\n\u0093Our agriculture is ruined,\u0094 said the Laird of Broken-girth-flow, a\nterritory which, since the days of Adam, had borne nothing but ling and\nwhortle-berries.\n\n\u0093Our religion is cut up, root and branch,\u0094 said the pimple-nosed pastor\nof the Episcopal meeting-house at Kirkwhistle.\n\n\u0093We shall shortly neither dare shoot a deer nor kiss a wench, without\na certificate from the presbytery and kirk-treasurer,\u0094 said\nMareschal-Wells.\n\n\u0093Or make a brandy jeroboam in a frosty morning, without license from a\ncommissioner of excise,\u0094 said the smuggler.\n\n\u0093Or ride over the fell in a moonless night,\u0094 said Westburnflat, \u0093without\nasking leave of young Earnscliff; or some Englified justice of the\npeace: thae were gude days on the Border when there was neither peace\nnor justice heard of.\u0094\n\n\u0093Let us remember our wrongs at Darien and Glencoe,\u0094 continued Ellieslaw,\n\u0093and take arms for the protection of our rights, our fortunes, our\nlives, and our families.\u0094\n\n\u0093Think upon genuine episcopal ordination, without which there can be no\nlawful clergy,\u0094 said the divine.\n\n\u0093Think of the piracies committed on our East-Indian trade by Green\nand the English thieves,\u0094 said William Willieson, half-owner and sole\nskipper of a brig that made four voyages annually between Cockpool and\nWhitehaven.\n\n\u0093Remember your liberties,\u0094 rejoined Mareschal, who seemed to take a\nmischievous delight in precipitating the movements of the enthusiasm\nwhich he had excited, like a roguish boy, who, having lifted the sluice\nof a mill-dam, enjoys the clatter of the wheels which he has put\nin motion, without thinking of the mischief he may have occasioned.\n\u0093Remember your liberties,\u0094 he exclaimed; \u0093confound cess, press, and\npresbytery, and the memory of old Willie that first brought them upon\nus!\u0094\n\n\u0093Damn the gauger!\u0094 echoed old John Rewcastle; \u0093I\u0092ll cleave him wi\u0092 my\nain hand.\u0094\n\n\u0093And confound the country-keeper and the constable!\u0094 re-echoed\nWestburnflat; \u0093I\u0092ll weize a brace of balls through them before morning.\u0094\n\n\u0093We are agreed, then,\u0094 said Ellieslaw, when the shouts had somewhat\nsubsided, \u0093to bear this state of things no longer?\u0094\n\n\u0093We are agreed to a man,\u0094 answered his guests.\n\n\u0093Not literally so,\u0094 said Mr. Ratcliffe; \u0093for though I cannot hope to\nassuage the violent symptoms which seem so suddenly to have seized\nupon the company, yet I beg to observe, that so far as the opinion of a\nsingle member goes, I do not entirely coincide in the list of grievances\nwhich has been announced, and that I do utterly protest against the\nfrantic measures which you seem disposed to adopt for removing them. I\ncan easily suppose much of what has been spoken may have arisen out of\nthe heat of the moment, or have been said perhaps in jest. But there are\nsome jests of a nature very apt to transpire; and you ought to remember,\ngentlemen, that stone-walls have ears.\u0094\n\n\u0093Stone-walls may have ears,\u0094 returned Ellieslaw, eyeing him with a look\nof triumphant malignity, \u0093but domestic spies, Mr. Ratcliffe, will soon\nfind themselves without any, if any such dares to continue his abode\nin a family where his coming was an unauthorized intrusion, where his\nconduct has been that of a presumptuous meddler, and from which his\nexit shall be that of a baffled knave, if he does not know how to take a\nhint.\u0094\n\n\u0093Mr. Vere,\u0094 returned Ratcliffe, with calm contempt, \u0093I am fully aware,\nthat as soon as my presence becomes useless to you, which it must\nthrough the rash step you are about to adopt, it will immediately become\nunsafe to myself, as it has always been hateful to you. But I have one\nprotection, and it is a strong one; for you would not willingly hear me\ndetail before gentlemen, and men of honour, the singular circumstances\nin which our connexion took its rise. As to the rest, I rejoice at its\nconclusion; and as I think that Mr. Mareschal and some other gentlemen\nwill guarantee the safety of my ears and of my throat (for which last I\nhave more reason to be apprehensive) during the course of the night, I\nshall not leave your castle till to-morrow morning.\u0094\n\n\u0093Be it so, sir,\u0094 replied Mr. Vere; \u0093you are entirely safe from my\nresentment, because you are beneath it, and not because I am afraid of\nyour disclosing my family secrets, although, for your own sake, I warn\nyou to beware how you do so. Your agency and intermediation can be of\nlittle consequence to one who will win or lose all, as lawful right or\nunjust usurpation shall succeed in the struggle that is about to ensue.\nFarewell, sir.\u0094\n\nRatcliffe arose, and cast upon him a look, which Vere seemed to sustain\nwith difficulty, and, bowing to those around him, left the room.\n\nThis conversation made an impression on many of the company, which\nEllieslaw hastened to dispel, by entering upon the business of the day.\nTheir hasty deliberations went to organize an immediate insurrection.\nEllieslaw, Mareschal, and Sir Frederick Langley were chosen leaders,\nwith powers to direct their farther measures. A place of rendezvous was\nappointed, at which all agreed to meet early on the ensuing day, with\nsuch followers and friends to the cause as each could collect around\nhim. Several of the guests retired to make the necessary preparations;\nand Ellieslaw made a formal apology to the others, who, with\nWestburnflat and the old smuggler, continued to ply the bottle stanchly,\nfor leaving the head of the table, as he must necessarily hold a\nseparate and sober conference with the coadjutors whom they had\nassociated with him in the command. The apology was the more readily\naccepted, as he prayed them, at the same time, to continue to amuse\nthemselves with such refreshments as the cellars of the castle afforded.\nShouts of applause followed their retreat; and the names of Vere,\nLangley, and, above all, of Mareschal, were thundered forth in chorus,\nand bathed with copious bumpers repeatedly, during the remainder of the\nevening.\n\nWhen the principal conspirators had retired into a separate apartment,\nthey gazed on each other for a minute with a sort of embarrassment,\nwhich, in Sir Frederick\u0092s dark features, amounted to an expression of\ndiscontented sullenness. Mareschal was the first to break the pause,\nsaying, with a loud burst of laughter,\n\n--\u0093Well! we are fairly embarked now, gentlemen--VOGUE LA GALERE!\u0094\n\n\u0093We may thank you for the plunge,\u0094 said Ellieslaw.\n\n\u0093Yes; but I don\u0092t know how far you will thank me,\u0094 answered Mareschal,\n\u0093when I show you this letter which I received just before we sat down.\nMy servant told me it was delivered by a man he had never seen before,\nwho went off at the gallop, after charging him to put it into my own\nhand.\u0094\n\nEllieslaw impatiently opened the letter, and read aloud--\n\nEDINBURGH,--\n\nHOND. SIR, Having obligations to your family, which shall be nameless,\nand learning that you are one of the company of, adventurers doing\nbusiness for the house of James and Company, late merchants in London,\nnow in Dunkirk, I think it right to send you this early and private\ninformation, that the vessels you expected have been driven off the\ncoast, without having been able to break bulk, or to land any part\nof their cargo; and that the west-country partners have resolved to\nwithdraw their name from the firm, as it must prove a losing concern.\nHaving good hope you will avail yourself of this early information, to\ndo what is needful for your own security, I rest your humble servant,\nNIHIL NAMELESS.\n\nFOR RALPH MARESCHAL, OF MARESCHAL-WELLS\n\n--THESE WITH CARE AND SPEED.\n\nSir Frederick\u0092s jaw dropped, and his countenance blackened, as the\nletter was read, and Ellieslaw exclaimed,--\u0093Why, this affects the very\nmainspring of our enterprise. If the French fleet, with the king on\nboard, has been chased off by the English, as this d--d scrawl seems to\nintimate, where are we?\u0094\n\n\u0093Just where we were this morning, I think,\u0094 said Mareschal, still\nlaughing.\n\n\u0093Pardon me, and a truce to your ill-timed mirth, Mr. Mareschal; this\nmorning we were not committed publicly, as we now stand committed by\nyour own mad act, when you had a letter in your pocket apprizing you\nthat our undertaking was desperate.\u0094\n\n\u0093Ay, ay, I expected you would say so. But, in the first place, my friend\nNihil Nameless and his letter may be all a flam; and, moreover, I would\nhave you know that I am tired of a party that does nothing but form\nbold resolutions overnight, and sleep them away with their wine before\nmorning. The government are now unprovided of men and ammunition; in a\nfew weeks they will have enough of both: the country is now in a flame\nagainst them; in a few weeks, betwixt the effects of self-interest, of\nfear, and of lukewarm indifference, which are already so visible, this\nfirst fervour will be as cold as Christmas. So, as I was determined to\ngo the vole, I have taken care you shall dip as deep as I; it signifies\nnothing plunging. You are fairly in the bog, and must struggle through.\u0094\n\n\u0093You are mistaken with respect to one of us, Mr. Mareschal,\u0094 said Sir\nFrederick Langley; and, applying himself to the bell, he desired the\nperson who entered to order his servants and horses instantly.\n\n\u0093You must not leave us, Sir Frederick,\u0094 said Ellieslaw; \u0093if we have our\nmusters to go over.\u0094\n\n\u0093I will go to-night, Mr. Vere,\u0094 said Sir Frederick, \u0093and write you my\nintentions in this matter when I am at home.\u0094\n\n\u0093Ay,\u0094 said Mareschal, \u0093and send them by a troop of horse from Carlisle\nto make us prisoners? Look ye, Sir Frederick, I for one will neither be\ndeserted nor betrayed; and if you leave Ellieslaw Castle to-night, it\nshall be by passing over my dead body.\u0094\n\n\u0093For shame! Mareschal,\u0094 said Mr. Vere, \u0093how can you so hastily\nmisinterpret our friend\u0092s intentions? I am sure Sir Frederick can\nonly be jesting with us; for, were he not too honourable to dream of\ndeserting the cause, he cannot but remember the full proofs we have of\nhis accession to it, and his eager activity in advancing it. He cannot\nbut be conscious, besides, that the first information will be readily\nreceived by government, and that if the question be, which can first\nlodge intelligence of the affair, we can easily save a few hours on\nhim.\u0094\n\n\u0093You should say you, and not we, when you talk of priorities in such\na race of treachery; for my part, I won\u0092t enter my horse for such a\nplate,\u0094 said Mareschal; and added betwixit his teeth, \u0093A pretty pair of\nfellows to trust a man\u0092s neck with!\u0094\n\n\u0093I am not to be intimidated from doing what I think proper,\u0094 said Sir\nFrederick Langley; \u0093and my first step shall be to leave Ellieslaw. I\nhave no reason to keep faith with one\u0094 (looking at Vere) \u0093who has kept\nnone with me.\u0094\n\n\u0093In what respect,\u0094 said Ellieslaw, silencing, with a motion of his hand,\nhis impetuous kinsman--\u0093how have I disappointed you, Sir Frederick?\u0094\n\n\u0093In the nearest and most tender point--you have trifled with me\nconcerning our proposed alliance, which you well knew was the gage of\nour political undertaking. This carrying off and this bringing back of\nMiss Vere,--the cold reception I have met with from her, and the excuses\nwith which you cover it, I believe to be mere evasions, that you may\nyourself retain possession of the estates which are hers by right,\nand make me, in the meanwhile, a tool in your desperate enterprise,\nby holding out hopes and expectations which you are resolved never to\nrealize.\u0094\n\n\u0093Sir Frederick, I protest, by all that is sacred--\u0094\n\n\u0093I will listen to no protestations; I have been cheated with them too\nlong,\u0094 answered Sir Frederick.\n\n\u0093If you leave us,\u0094 said Ellieslaw, \u0093you cannot but know both your ruin\nand ours is certain; all depends on our adhering together.\u0094\n\n\u0093Leave me to take care of myself,\u0094 returned the knight; \u0093but were what\nyou say true, I would rather perish than be fooled any farther.\u0094\n\n\u0093Can nothing--no surety convince you of my sincerity?\u0094 said Ellieslaw,\nanxiously; \u0093this morning I should have repelled your unjust suspicions\nas an insult; but situated as we now are--\u0094\n\n\u0093You feel yourself compelled to be sincere?\u0094 retorted Sir Frederick.\n\u0093If you would have me think so, there is but one way to convince me of\nit--let your daughter bestow her hand on me this evening.\u0094\n\n\u0093So soon?--impossible,\u0094 answered Vere; \u0093think of her late alarm--of our\npresent undertaking.\u0094\n\n\u0093I will listen to nothing but to her consent, plighted at the altar.\nYou have a chapel in the castle--Doctor Hobbler is present among the\ncompany-this proof of your good faith to-night, and we are again\njoined in heart and hand. If you refuse me when it is so much for your\nadvantage to consent, how shall I trust you to-morrow, when I shall\nstand committed in your undertaking, and unable to retract?\u0094\n\n\u0093And I am to understand, that, if you can be made my son-in-law\nto-night, our friendship is renewed?\u0094 said Ellieslaw.\n\n\u0093Most infallibly, and most inviolably,\u0094 replied Sir Frederick.\n\n\u0093Then,\u0094 said Vere, \u0093though what you ask is premature, indelicate, and\nunjust towards my character, yet, Sir Frederick, give me your hand--my\ndaughter shall be your wife.\u0094\n\n\u0093This night?\u0094\n\n\u0093This very night,\u0094 replied Ellieslaw, \u0093before the clock strikes twelve.\u0094\n\n\u0093With her own consent, I trust,\u0094 said Mareschal; \u0093for I promise you\nboth, gentlemen, I will not stand tamely by, and see any violence put on\nthe will of my pretty kinswoman.\u0094\n\n\u0093Another pest in this hot-headed fellow,\u0094 muttered Ellieslaw; and then\naloud, \u0093With her own consent? For what do you take me, Mareschal, that\nyou should suppose your interference necessary to protect my daughter\nagainst her father? Depend upon it, she has no repugnance to Sir\nFrederick Langley.\u0094\n\n\u0093Or rather to be called Lady Langley? faith, like enough--there are\nmany women might be of her mind; and I beg your pardon, but these sudden\ndemands and concessions alarmed me a little on her account.\u0094\n\n\u0093It is only the suddenness of the proposal that embarrasses me,\u0094 said\nEllieslaw; \u0093but perhaps if she is found intractable, Sir Frederick will\nconsider--\u0094\n\n\u0093I will consider nothing, Mr. Vere--your daughter\u0092s hand to-night, or I\ndepart, were it at midnight--there is my ultimatum.\u0094\n\n\u0093I embrace it,\u0094 said Ellieslaw; \u0093and I will leave you to talk upon our\nmilitary preparations, while I go to prepare my daughter for so sudden a\nchange of condition.\u0094\n\nSo saying, he left the company.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\n     He brings Earl Osmond to receive my vows.\n     O dreadful change!  for Tancred, haughty Osmond.\n     --TANCRED AND SIGISMUNDA.\n\nMr. Vere, whom long practice of dissimulation had enabled to model his\nvery gait and footsteps to aid the purposes of deception, walked along\nthe stone passage, and up the first flight of steps towards Miss Vere\u0092s\napartment, with the alert, firm, and steady pace of one who is bound,\nindeed, upon important business, but who entertains no doubt he can\nterminate his affairs satisfactorily. But when out of hearing of the\ngentlemen whom he had left, his step became so slow and irresolute, as\nto correspond with his doubts and his fears. At length he paused in an\nantechamber to collect his ideas, and form his plan of argument, before\napproaching his daughter.\n\n\u0093In what more hopeless and inextricable dilemma was ever an unfortunate\nman involved!\u0094 Such was the tenor of his reflections.--\u0093If we now fall\nto pieces by disunion, there can be little doubt that the government\nwill take my life as the prime agitator of the insurrection. Or, grant I\ncould stoop to save myself by a hasty submission, am I not, even in that\ncase, utterly ruined? I have broken irreconcilably with Ratcliffe, and\ncan have nothing to expect from that quarter but insult and persecution.\nI must wander forth an impoverished and dishonoured man, without\neven the means of sustaining life, far less wealth sufficient to\ncounterbalance the infamy which my countrymen, both those whom I\ndesert and those whom I join, will attach to the name of the political\nrenegade. It is not to be thought of. And yet, what choice remains\nbetween this lot and the ignominious scaffold? Nothing can save me but\nreconciliation with these men; and, to accomplish this, I have promised\nto Langley that Isabella shall marry him ere midnight, and to Mareschal,\nthat she shall do so without compulsion. I have but one remedy betwixt\nme and ruin--her consent to take a suitor whom she dislikes, upon such\nshort notice as would disgust her, even were he a favoured lover--But\nI must trust to the romantic generosity of her disposition; and let\nme paint the necessity of her obedience ever so strongly, I cannot\novercharge its reality.\u0094\n\nHaving finished this sad chain of reflections upon his perilous\ncondition, he entered his daughter\u0092s apartment with every nerve bent up\nto the support of the argument which he was about to sustain. Though a\ndeceitful and ambitious man, he was not so devoid of natural affection\nbut that he was shocked at the part he was about to act, in practising\non the feelings of a dutiful and affectionate child; but the\nrecollections, that, if he succeeded, his daughter would only be\ntrepanned into an advantageous match, and that, if he failed, he himself\nwas a lost man, were quite sufficient to drown all scruples.\n\nHe found Miss Vere seated by the window of her dressing-room, her head\nreclining on her hand, and either sunk in slumber, or so deeply engaged\nin meditation, that she did not hear the noise he made at his entrance.\nHe approached with his features composed to a deep expression of sorrow\nand sympathy, and, sitting down beside her, solicited her attention by\nquietly taking her hand, a motion which he did not fail to accompany\nwith a deep sigh.\n\n\u0093My father!\u0094 said Isabella, with a sort of start, which expressed at\nleast as much fear, as joy or affection.\n\n\u0093Yes, Isabella,\u0094 said Vere, \u0093your unhappy father, who comes now as a\npenitent to crave forgiveness of his daughter for an injury done to her\nin the excess of his affection, and then to take leave of her for ever.\u0094\n\n\u0093Sir? Offence to me take leave for ever? What does all this mean?\u0094 said\nMiss Vere.\n\n\u0093Yes, Isabella, I am serious. But first let me ask you, have you no\nsuspicion that I may have been privy to the strange chance which befell\nyou yesterday morning?\u0094\n\n\u0093You, sir?\u0094 answered Isabella, stammering between a consciousness that\nhe had guessed her thoughts justly, and the shame as well as fear which\nforbade her to acknowledge a suspicion so degrading and so unnatural.\n\n\u0093Yes!\u0094 he continued, \u0093your hesitation confesses that you entertained\nsuch an opinion, and I have now the painful task of acknowledging that\nyour suspicions have done me no injustice. But listen to my motives.\nIn an evil hour I countenanced the addresses of Sir Frederick Langley,\nconceiving it impossible that you could have any permanent objections to\na match where the advantages were, in most respects, on your side. In\na worse, I entered with him into measures calculated to restore our\nbanished monarch, and the independence of my country. He has taken\nadvantage of my unguarded confidence, and now has my life at his\ndisposal.\u0094\n\n\u0093Your life, sir?\u0094 said Isabella, faintly.\n\n\u0093Yes, Isabella,\u0094 continued her father, \u0093the life of him who gave life to\nyou. So soon as I foresaw the excesses into which his headlong passion\n(for, to do him justice, I believe his unreasonable conduct arises from\nexcess of attachment to you) was likely to hurry him, I endeavoured,\nby finding a plausible pretext for your absence for some weeks, to\nextricate myself from the dilemma in which I am placed. For this purpose\nI wished, in case your objections to the match continued insurmountable,\nto have sent you privately for a few months to the convent of your\nmaternal aunt at Paris. By a series of mistakes you have been brought\nfrom the place of secrecy and security which I had destined for your\ntemporary abode. Fate has baffled my last chance of escape, and I have\nonly to give you my blessing, and send you from the castle with Mr.\nRatcliffe, who now leaves it; my own fate will soon be decided.\u0094\n\n\u0093Good Heaven, sir! can this be possible?\u0094 exclaimed Isabella. \u0093O, why\nwas I freed from the restraint in which you placed me? or why did you\nnot impart your pleasure to me?\u0094\n\n\u0093Think an instant, Isabella. Would you have had me prejudice in your\nopinion the friend I was most desirous of serving, by communicating to\nyou the injurious eagerness with which he pursued his object? Could I do\nso honourably, having promised to assist his suit?--But it is all over,\nI and Mareschal have made up our minds to die like men; it only remains\nto send you from hence under a safe escort.\u0094\n\n\u0093Great powers! and is there no remedy?\u0094 said the terrified young woman.\n\n\u0093None, my child,\u0094 answered Vere, gently, \u0093unless one which you would not\nadvise your father to adopt--to be the first to betray his friends.\u0094\n\n\u0093O, no! no!\u0094 she answered, abhorrently yet hastily, as if to reject\nthe temptation which the alternative presented to her. \u0093But is there no\nother hope--through flight--through mediation--through supplication?--I\nwill bend my knee to Sir Frederick!\u0094\n\n\u0093It would be a fruitless degradation; he is determined on his course,\nand I am equally resolved to stand the hazard of my fate. On one\ncondition only he will turn aside from his purpose, and that condition\nmy lips shall never utter to you.\u0094\n\n\u0093Name it, I conjure you, my dear father!\u0094 exclaimed Isabella. \u0093What CAN\nhe ask that we ought not to grant, to prevent the hideous catastrophe\nwith which you are threatened?\u0094\n\n\u0093That, Isabella,\u0094 said Vere, solemnly, \u0093you shall never know, until your\nfather\u0092s head has rolled on the bloody scaffold; then, indeed, you will\nlearn there was one sacrifice by which he might have been saved.\u0094\n\n\u0093And why not speak it now?\u0094 said Isabella; \u0093do you fear I would flinch\nfrom the sacrifice of fortune for your preservation? or would you\nbequeath me the bitter legacy of life-long remorse, so oft as I shall\nthink that you perished, while there remained one mode of preventing the\ndreadful misfortune that overhangs you?\u0094\n\n\u0093Then, my child,\u0094 said Vere, \u0093since you press me to name what I would a\nthousand times rather leave in silence, I must inform you that he will\naccept for ransom nothing but your hand in marriage, and that conferred\nbefore midnight this very evening!\u0094\n\n\u0093This evening, sir?\u0094 said the young lady, struck with horror at the\nproposal--\u0093and to such a man!--A man?--a monster, who could wish to win\nthe daughter by threatening the life of the father--it is impossible!\u0094\n\n\u0093You say right, my child,\u0094 answered her father, \u0093it is indeed\nimpossible; nor have I either the right or the wish to exact such a\nsacrifice--It is the course of nature that the old should die and be\nforgot, and the young should live and be happy.\u0094\n\n\u0093My father die, and his child can save him!--but no--no--my dear father,\npardon me, it is impossible; you only wish to guide me to your wishes. I\nknow your object is what you think my happiness, and this dreadful tale\nis only told to influence my conduct and subdue my scruples.\u0094\n\n\u0093My daughter,\u0094 replied Ellieslaw, in a tone where offended authority\nseemed to struggle with parental affection, \u0093my child suspects me of\ninventing a false tale to work upon her feelings! Even this I must\nbear, and even from this unworthy suspicion I must descend to vindicate\nmyself. You know the stainless honour of your cousin Mareschal--mark\nwhat I shall write to him, and judge from his answer, if the danger in\nwhich we stand is not real, and whether I have not used every means to\navert it.\u0094\n\nHe sate down, wrote a few lines hastily, and handed them to Isabella,\nwho, after repeated and painful efforts, cleared her eyes and head\nsufficiently to discern their purport.\n\n\u0093Dear cousin,\u0094 said the billet, \u0093I find my daughter, as I expected, in\ndespair at the untimely and premature urgency of Sir Frederick Langley.\nShe cannot even comprehend the peril in which we stand, or how much we\nare in his power--Use your influence with him, for Heaven\u0092s sake, to\nmodify proposals, to the acceptance of which I cannot, and will not,\nurge my child against all her own feelings, as well as those of delicacy\nand propriety, and oblige your loving cousin,--R. V.\u0094\n\nIn the agitation of the moment, when her swimming eyes and dizzy brain\ncould hardly comprehend the sense of what she looked upon, it is not\nsurprising that Miss Vere should have omitted to remark that this\nletter seemed to rest her scruples rather upon the form and time of the\nproposed union, than on a rooted dislike to the suitor proposed to her.\nMr. Vere rang the bell, and gave the letter to a servant to be delivered\nto Mr. Mareschal, and, rising from his chair, continued to traverse\nthe apartment in silence and in great agitation until the answer was\nreturned. He glanced it over, and wrung the hand of his daughter as he\ngave it to her. The tenor was as follows:--\n\n\u0093My dear kinsman, I have already urged the knight on the point you\nmention, and I find him as fixed as Cheviot. I am truly sorry my fair\ncousin should be pressed to give up any of her maidenly rights. Sir\nFrederick consents, however, to leave the castle with me the instant\nthe ceremony is performed, and we will raise our followers and begin the\nfray. Thus there is great hope the bridegroom may be knocked on the head\nbefore he and the bride can meet again, so Bell has a fair chance to be\nLady Langley A TRES BON MARCHE. For the rest, I can only say, that if\nshe can make up her mind to the alliance at all--it is no time for mere\nmaiden ceremony--my pretty cousin must needs consent to marry in haste,\nor we shall all repent at leisure, or rather have very little leisure\nto repent; which is all at present from him who rests your affectionate\nkinsman,--R. M.\u0094\n\n\u0093P.S.--Tell Isabella that I would rather cut the knight\u0092s throat after\nall, and end the dilemma that way, than see her constrained to marry him\nagainst her will.\u0094\n\nWhen Isabella had read this letter, it dropped from her hand, and she\nwould, at the same time, have fallen from her chair, had she not been\nsupported by her father.\n\n\u0093My God, my child will die!\u0094 exclaimed Vere, the feelings of nature\novercoming, even in HIS breast, the sentiments of selfish policy; \u0093look\nup, Isabella--look up, my child--come what will, you shall not be\nthe sacrifice--I will fall myself with the consciousness I leave you\nhappy--My child may weep on my grave, but she shall not--not in this\ninstance--reproach my memory.\u0094 He called a servant.--\u0093Go, bid Ratcliffe\ncome hither directly.\u0094\n\nDuring this interval, Miss Vere became deadly pale, clenched her hands,\npressing the palms strongly together, closed her eyes, and drew her lips\nwith strong compression, as if the severe constraint which she put upon\nher internal feelings extended even to her muscular organization. Then\nraising her head, and drawing in her breath strongly ere she spoke, she\nsaid, with firmness,--\u0093Father, I consent to the marriage.\u0094\n\n\u0093You shall not--you shall not,--my child--my dear child--you shall not\nembrace certain misery to free me from uncertain danger.\u0094\n\nSo exclaimed Ellieslaw; and, strange and inconsistent beings that we\nare! he expressed the real though momentary feelings of his heart.\n\n\u0093Father,\u0094 repeated Isabella, \u0093I will consent to this marriage.\u0094\n\n\u0093No, my child, no--not now at least--we will humble ourselves to obtain\ndelay from him; and yet, Isabella, could you overcome a dislike\nwhich has no real foundation, think, in other respects, what a\nmatch!--wealth--rank--importance.\u0094\n\n\u0093Father!\u0094 reiterated Isabella, \u0093I have consented.\u0094\n\nIt seemed as if she had lost the power of saying anything else, or even\nof varying the phrase which, with such effort, she had compelled herself\nto utter.\n\n\u0093Heaven bless thee, my child!--Heaven bless thee!--And it WILL bless\nthee with riches, with pleasure, with power.\u0094\n\nMiss Vere faintly entreated to be left by herself for the rest of the\nevening.\n\n\u0093But will you not receive Sir Frederick?\u0094 said her father, anxiously.\n\n\u0093I will meet him,\u0094 she replied, \u0093I will meet him--when I must, and where\nI must; but spare me now.\u0094\n\n\u0093Be it so, my dearest; you shall know no restraint that I can save\nyou from. Do not think too hardly of Sir Frederick for this,--it is an\nexcess of passion.\u0094\n\nIsabella waved her hand impatiently.\n\n\u0093Forgive me, my child--I go--Heaven bless thee. At eleven--if you call\nme not before--at eleven I come to seek you.\u0094\n\nWhen he left Isabella she dropped upon her knees--\u0093Heaven aid me\nto support the resolution I have taken--Heaven only can--O, poor\nEarnscliff! who shall comfort him? and with what contempt will he\npronounce her name, who listened to him to-day and gave herself to\nanother at night! But let him despise me--better so than that he should\nknow the truth--let him despise me; if it will but lessen his grief, I\nshould feel comfort in the loss of his esteem.\u0094\n\nShe wept bitterly; attempting in vain, from time to time, to commence\nthe prayer for which she had sunk on her knees, but unable to calm her\nspirits sufficiently for the exercise of devotion. As she remained in\nthis agony of mind, the door of her apartment was slowly opened.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\n     The darksome cave they enter, where they found\n     The woful man, low sitting on the ground,\n     Musing full sadly in his sullen mind.--FAERY QUEEN.\n\nThe intruder on Miss Vere\u0092s sorrows was Ratcliffe. Ellieslaw had, in the\nagitation of his mind, forgotten to countermand the order he had given\nto call him thither, so that he opened the door with the words, \u0093You\nsent for me, Mr. Vere.\u0094 Then looking around--\u0093Miss Vere, alone! on the\nground! and in tears!\u0094\n\n\u0093Leave me--leave me, Mr. Ratcliffe,\u0094 said the unhappy young lady.\n\n\u0093I must not leave you,\u0094 said Ratcliffe; \u0093I have been repeatedly\nrequesting admittance to take my leave of you, and have been refused,\nuntil your father himself sent for me. Blame me not, if I am bold and\nintrusive; I have a duty to discharge which makes me so.\u0094\n\n\u0093I cannot listen to you--I cannot speak to you, Mr. Ratcliffe; take my\nbest wishes, and for God\u0092s sake leave me.\u0094\n\n\u0093Tell me only,\u0094 said Ratcliffe, \u0093is it true that this monstrous match is\nto go forward, and this very night? I heard the servants proclaim it as\nI was on the great staircase--I heard the directions given to clear out\nthe chapel.\u0094\n\n\u0093Spare me, Mr. Ratcliffe,\u0094 replied the luckless bride; \u0093and from the\nstate in which you see me, judge of the cruelty of these questions.\u0094\n\n\u0093Married? to Sir Frederick Langley? and this night? It must not\ncannot--shall not be.\u0094\n\n\u0093It MUST be, Mr. Ratcliff, or my father is ruined.\u0094\n\n\u0093Ah! I understand,\u0094 answered Ratcliffe; \u0093and you have sacrificed\nyourself to save him who--But let the virtue of the child atone for the\nfaults of the father it is no time to rake them up.--What CAN be done?\nTime presses--I know but one remedy--with four-and-twenty hours I might\nfind many--Miss Vere, you must implore the protection of the only human\nbeing who has it in his power to control the course of events which\nthreatens to hurry you before it.\u0094\n\n\u0093And what human being,\u0094 answered Miss Vere, \u0093has such power?\u0094\n\n\u0093Start not when I name him,\u0094 said Ratcliffe, coming near her, and\nspeaking in a low but distinct voice. \u0093It is he who is called Elshender\nthe Recluse of Mucklestane-Moor.\u0094\n\n\u0093You are mad, Mr. Ratcliffe, or you mean to insult my misery by an\nill-timed jest!\u0094\n\n\u0093I am as much in my senses, young lady,\u0094 answered her adviser, \u0093as you\nare; and I am no idle jester, far less with misery, least of all with\nyour misery. I swear to you that this being (who is other far than\nwhat he seems) actually possesses the means of redeeming you from this\nhateful union.\u0094\n\n\u0093And of insuring my father\u0092s safety?\u0094\n\n\u0093Yes! even that,\u0094 said Ratcliffe, \u0093if you plead his cause with him--yet\nhow to obtain admittance to the Recluse!\u0094\n\n\u0093Fear not that,\u0094 said Miss Vere, suddenly recollecting the incident\nof the rose; \u0093I remember he desired me to call upon him for aid in\nmy extremity, and gave me this flower as a token. Ere it faded away\nentirely, I would need, he said, his assistance: is it possible his\nwords can have been aught but the ravings of insanity?\u0094\n\n\u0093Doubt it not fear it not--but above all,\u0094 said Ratcliffe, \u0093let us lose\nno time--are you at liberty, and unwatched?\u0094\n\n\u0093I believe so,\u0094 said Isabella: \u0093but what would you have me to do?\u0094\n\n\u0093Leave the castle instantly,\u0094 said Ratcliffe, \u0093and throw yourself at the\nfeet of this extraordinary man, who in circumstances that seem to argue\nthe extremity of the most contemptible poverty, possesses yet an almost\nabsolute influence over your fate.--Guests and servants are deep in\ntheir carouse--the leaders sitting in conclave on their treasonable\nschemes--my horse stands ready in the stable--I will saddle one for you,\nand meet you at the little garden-gate--O, let no doubt of my prudence\nor fidelity prevent your taking the only step in your power to escape\nthe dreadful fate which must attend the wife of Sir Frederick Langley!\u0094\n\n\u0093Mr. Ratcliffe,\u0094 said Miss Vere, \u0093you have always been esteemed a man\nof honour and probity, and a drowning wretch will always catch at the\nfeeblest twig,--I will trust you--I will follow your advice--I will meet\nyou at the garden-gate.\u0094\n\nShe bolted the outer-door of her apartment as soon as Mr. Ratcliffe left\nher, and descended to the garden by a separate stair of communication\nwhich opened to her dressing-room. On the way she felt inclined to\nretract the consent she had so hastily given to a plan so hopeless\nand extravagant. But as she passed in her descent a private door which\nentered into the chapel from the back-stair, she heard the voice of the\nfemale-servants as they were employed in the task of cleaning it.\n\n\u0093Married! and to sae bad a man--Ewhow, sirs! onything rather than that.\u0094\n\n\u0093They are right--they are right,\u0094 said Miss Vere, \u0093anything rather than\nthat!\u0094\n\nShe hurried to the garden. Mr. Ratcliffe was true to his\nappointment--the horses stood saddled at the garden-gate, and in a few\nminutes they were advancing rapidly towards the hut of the Solitary.\n\nWhile the ground was favourable, the speed of their journey was such as\nto prevent much communication; but when a steep ascent compelled them to\nslacken their pace, a new cause of apprehension occurred to Miss Vere\u0092s\nmind.\n\n\u0093Mr. Ratcliffe,\u0094 she said, pulling up her horse\u0092s bridle, \u0093let us\nprosecute no farther a journey, which nothing but the extreme agitation\nof my mind can vindicate my having undertaken--I am well aware that this\nman passes among the vulgar as being possessed of supernatural powers,\nand carrying on an intercourse with beings of another world; but I would\nhave you aware I am neither to be imposed on by such follies, nor, were\nI to believe in their existence, durst I, with my feelings of religion,\napply to this being in my distress.\u0094\n\n\u0093I should have thought, Miss Vere,\u0094 replied Ratcliffe, \u0093my character and\nhabits of thinking were so well known to you, that you might have held\nme exculpated from crediting in such absurdity.\u0094\n\n\u0093But in what other mode,\u0094 said Isabella, \u0093can a being, so miserable\nhimself in appearance, possess the power of assisting me?\u0094\n\n\u0093Miss Vere.\u0094 said Ratcliffe, after a momentary pause, \u0093I am bound by\na solemn oath of secrecy--You must, without farther explanation, be\nsatisfied with my pledged assurance, that he does possess the power, if\nyou can inspire him with the will; and that, I doubt not, you will be\nable to do.\u0094\n\n\u0093Mr. Ratcliffe,\u0094 said Miss Vere, \u0093you may yourself be mistaken; you ask\nan unlimited degree of confidence from me.\u0094\n\n\u0093Recollect, Miss Vere,\u0094 he replied, \u0093that when, in your humanity, you\nasked me to interfere with your father in favour of Haswell and his\nruined family--when you requested me to prevail on him to do a\nthing most abhorrent to his nature--to forgive an injury and remit a\npenalty--I stipulated that you should ask me no questions concerning the\nsources of my influence--You found no reason to distrust me then, do not\ndistrust me now.\u0094\n\n\u0093But the extraordinary mode of life of this man,\u0094 said Miss Vere; \u0093his\nseclusion--his figure--the deepness of mis-anthropy which he is said to\nexpress in his language--Mr. Ratcliffe, what can I think of him if he\nreally possesses the powers you ascribe to him?\u0094\n\n\u0093This man, young lady, was bred a Catholic, a sect which affords a\nthousand instances of those who have retired from power and affluence to\nvoluntary privations more strict even than his.\u0094\n\n\u0093But he avows no religious motive,\u0094 replied Miss Vere.\n\n\u0093No,\u0094 replied Ratcliffe; \u0093disgust with the world has operated his\nretreat from it without assuming the veil of superstition. Thus far I\nmay tell you--he was born to great wealth, which his parents designed\nshould become greater by his union with a kinswoman, whom for that\npurpose they bred up in their own house. You have seen his figure;\njudge what the young lady must have thought of the lot to which she was\ndestined--Yet, habituated to his appearance, she showed no reluctance,\nand the friends of--of the person whom I speak of, doubted not that the\nexcess of his attachment, the various acquisitions of his mind, his\nmany and amiable qualities, had overcome the natural horror which\nhis destined bride must have entertained at an exterior so dreadfully\ninauspicious.\u0094\n\n\u0093And did they judge truly?\u0094 said Isabella.\n\n\u0093You shall hear. He, at least, was fully aware of his own deficiency;\nthe sense of it haunted him like a phantom. \u0091I am,\u0092 was his own\nexpression to me,--I mean to a man whom he trusted,--\u0091I am, in spite\nof what you would say, a poor miserable outcast, fitter to have been\nsmothered in the cradle than to have been brought up to scare the world\nin which I crawl.\u0092 The person whom he addressed in vain endeavoured to\nimpress him with the indifference to external form which is the natural\nresult of philosophy, or entreat him to recall the superiority of mental\ntalents to the more attractive attributes that are merely personal.\n\u0091I hear you,\u0092 he would reply; \u0091but you speak the voice of cold-blooded\nstoicism, or, at least, of friendly partiality. But look at every book\nwhich we have read, those excepted of that abstract philosophy which\nfeels no responsive voice in our natural feelings. Is not personal form,\nsuch as at least can be tolerated without horror and disgust, always\nrepresented as essential to our ideas of a friend, far more a lover?\nIs not such a mis-shapen monster as I am, excluded, by the very fiat\nof Nature, from her fairest enjoyments? What but my wealth prevents\nall--perhaps even Letitia, or you--from shunning me as something foreign\nto your nature, and more odious, by bearing that distorted resemblance\nto humanity which we observe in the animal tribes that are more hateful\nto man because they seem his caricature?\u0092\u0094\n\n\u0093You repeat the sentiments of a madman,\u0094 said Miss Vere.\n\n\u0093No,\u0094 replied her conductor, \u0093unless a morbid and excessive sensibility\non such a subject can be termed insanity. Yet I will not deny that this\ngoverning feeling and apprehension carried the person who entertained\nit, to lengths which indicated a deranged imagination. He appeared\nto think that it was necessary for him, by exuberant, and not always\nwell-chosen instances of liberality, and even profusion, to unite\nhimself to the human race, from which he conceived himself naturally\ndissevered. The benefits which he bestowed, from a disposition naturally\nphilanthropical in an uncommon degree, were exaggerated by the influence\nof the goading reflection, that more was necessary from him than from\nothers,--lavishing his treasures as if to bribe mankind to receive him\ninto their class. It is scarcely necessary to say, that the bounty which\nflowed from a source so capricious was often abused, and his confidence\nfrequently betrayed. These disappointments, which occur to all, more or\nless, and most to such as confer benefits without just discrimination,\nhis diseased fancy set down to the hatred and contempt excited by his\npersonal deformity.--But I fatigue you, Miss Vere?\u0094\n\n\u0093No, by no means; I--I could not prevent my attention from wandering an\ninstant; pray proceed.\u0094\n\n\u0093He became at length,\u0094 continued Ratcliffe, \u0093the most ingenious\nself-tormentor of whom I have ever heard; the scoff of the rabble, and\nthe sneer of the yet more brutal vulgar of his own rank, was to him\nagony and breaking on the wheel. He regarded the laugh of the common\npeople whom he passed on the street, and the suppressed titter, or yet\nmore offensive terror, of the young girls to whom he was introduced in\ncompany, as proofs of the true sense which the world entertained of\nhim, as a prodigy unfit to be received among them on the usual terms\nof society, and as vindicating the wisdom of his purpose in withdrawing\nhimself from among them. On the faith and sincerity of two persons\nalone, he seemed to rely implicitly--on that of his betrothed bride, and\nof a friend eminently gifted in personal accomplishments, who seemed,\nand indeed probably was, sincerely attached to him. He ought to have\nbeen so at least, for he was literally loaded with benefits by him whom\nyou are now about to see. The parents of the subject of my story died\nwithin a short space of each other. Their death postponed the marriage,\nfor which the day had been fixed. The lady did not seem greatly to\nmourn this delay,--perhaps that was not to have been expected; but\nshe intimated no change of intention, when, after a decent interval,\na second day was named for their union. The friend of whom I spoke was\nthen a constant resident at the Hall. In an evil hour, at the earnest\nrequest and entreaty of this friend, they joined a general party, where\nmen of different political opinions were mingled, and where they drank\ndeep. A quarrel ensued; the friend of the Recluse drew his sword with\nothers, and was thrown down and disarmed by a more powerful antagonist.\nThey fell in the struggle at the feet of the Recluse, who, maimed and\ntruncated as his form appears, possesses, nevertheless, great strength,\nas well as violent passions. He caught up a sword, pierced the heart\nof his friend\u0092s antagonist, was tried, and his life, with difficulty,\nredeemed from justice at the expense of a year\u0092s close imprisonment, the\npunishment of manslaughter. The incident affected him most deeply,\nthe more that the deceased was a man of excellent character, and had\nsustained gross insult and injury ere he drew his sword. I think, from\nthat moment, I observed--I beg pardon--The fits of morbid sensibility\nwhich had tormented this unfortunate gentleman, were rendered henceforth\nmore acute by remorse, which he, of all men, was least capable of having\nincurred, or of sustaining when it became his unhappy lot. His paroxysms\nof agony could not be concealed from the lady to whom he was betrothed;\nand it must be confessed they were of an alarming and fearful nature.\nHe comforted himself, that, at the expiry of his imprisonment, he could\nform with his wife and friend a society, encircled by which he might\ndispense with more extensive communication with the world. He was\ndeceived; before that term elapsed, his friend and his betrothed bride\nwere man and wife. The effects of a shock so dreadful on an ardent\ntemperament, a disposition already soured by bitter remorse, and\nloosened by the indulgence of a gloomy imagination from the rest of\nmankind, I cannot describe to you; it was as if the last cable at which\nthe vessel rode had suddenly parted, and left her abandoned to all the\nwild fury of the tempest. He was placed under medical restraint. As a\ntemporary measure this might have been justifiable; but his hard-hearted\nfriend, who, in consequence of his marriage, was now his nearest ally,\nprolonged his confinement, in order to enjoy the management of his\nimmense estates. There was one who owed his all to the sufferer, an\nhumble friend, but grateful and faithful. By unceasing exertion, and\nrepeated invocation of justice, he at length succeeded in obtaining\nhis patron\u0092s freedom, and reinstatement in the management of his own\nproperty, to which was soon added that of his intended bride, who having\ndied without male issue, her estates reverted to him, as heir of entail.\nBut freedom and wealth were unable to restore the equipoise of his mind;\nto the former his grief made him indifferent--the latter only served him\nas far as it afforded him the means of indulging his strange and wayward\nfancy. He had renounced the Catholic religion, but perhaps some of\nits doctrines continued to influence a mind, over which remorse and\nmisanthropy now assumed, in appearance, an unbounded authority. His life\nhas since been that alternately of a pilgrim and a hermit, suffering\nthe most severe privations, not indeed in ascetic devotion, but in\nabhorrence of mankind. Yet no man\u0092s words and actions have been at\nsuch a wide difference, nor has any hypocritical wretch ever been more\ningenious in assigning good motives for his vile actions, than this\nunfortunate in reconciling to his abstract principles of misanthropy,\na conduct which flows from his natural generosity and kindness of\nfeeling.\u0094\n\n\u0093Still, Mr. Ratcliffe--still you describe the inconsistencies of a\nmadman.\u0094\n\n\u0093By no means,\u0094 replied Ratcliffe. \u0093That the imagination of this\ngentleman is disordered, I will not pretend to dispute; I have already\ntold you that it has sometimes broken out into paroxysms approaching\nto real mental alienation. But it is of his common state of mind that I\nspeak; it is irregular, but not deranged; the shades are as gradual as\nthose that divide the light of noonday from midnight. The courtier who\nruins his fortune for the attainment of a title which can do him no\ngood, or power of which he can make no suitable or creditable use, the\nmiser who hoards his useless wealth, and the prodigal who squanders it,\nare all marked with a certain shade of insanity. To criminals who are\nguilty of enormities, when the temptation, to a sober mind, bears no\nproportion to the horror of the act, or the probability of detection and\npunishment, the same observation applies; and every violent passion, as\nwell as anger, may be termed a short madness.\u0094\n\n\u0093This may be all good philosophy, Mr. Ratcliffe,\u0094 answered Miss Vere;\n\u0093but, excuse me, it by no means emboldens me to visit, at this late\nhour, a person whose extravagance of imagination you yourself can only\npalliate.\u0094\n\n\u0093Rather, then,\u0094 said Ratcliffe, \u0093receive my solemn assurances, that you\ndo not incur the slightest danger. But what I have been hitherto afraid\nto mention for fear of alarming you is, that now when we are within\nsight of his retreat, for I can discover it through the twilight, I must\ngo no farther with you; you must proceed alone.\u0094\n\n\u0093Alone?--I dare not.\u0094\n\n\u0093You must,\u0094 continued Ratcliffe; \u0093I will remain here and wait for you.\u0094\n\n\u0093You will not, then, stir from this place,\u0094 said Miss Vere \u0093yet\nthe distance is so great, you could not hear me were I to cry for\nassistance.\u0094\n\n\u0093Fear nothing,\u0094 said her guide; \u0093or observe, at least, the utmost\ncaution in stifling every expression of timidity. Remember that his\npredominant and most harassing apprehension arises from a consciousness\nof the hideousness of his appearance. Your path lies straight beside\nyon half-fallen willow; keep the left side of it; the marsh lies on the\nright. Farewell for a time. Remember the evil you are threatened with,\nand let it overcome at once your fears and scruples.\u0094\n\n\u0093Mr. Ratcliffe,\u0094 said Isabella, \u0093farewell; if you have deceived one so\nunfortunate as myself, you have for ever forfeited the fair character\nfor probity and honour to which I have trusted.\u0094\n\n\u0093On my life--on my soul,\u0094 continued Ratcliffe, raising his voice as the\ndistance between them increased, \u0093you are safe--perfectly safe.\u0094\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\n     --\u0091Twas time and griefs\n     That framed him thus:  Time, with his fairer hand,\n     Offering the fortunes of his former days,\n     The former man may make him.--Bring us to him,\n     And chance it as it may.--OLD PLAY.\n\nThe sounds of Ratcliffe\u0092s voice had died on Isabella\u0092s ear; but as she\nfrequently looked back, it was some encouragement to her to discern his\nform now darkening in the gloom. Ere, however, she went much farther,\nshe lost the object in the increasing shade. The last glimmer of the\ntwilight placed her before the hut of the Solitary. She twice extended\nher hand to the door, and twice she withdrew it; and when she did at\nlength make the effort, the knock did not equal in violence the throb of\nher own bosom. Her next effort was louder; her third was reiterated, for\nthe fear of not obtaining the protection from which Ratcliffe promised\nso much, began to overpower the terrors of his presence from whom she\nwas to request it. At length, as she still received no answer, she\nrepeatedly called upon the Dwarf by his assumed name, and requested him\nto answer and open to her.\n\n\u0093What miserable being is reduced,\u0094 said the appalling voice of the\nSolitary, \u0093to seek refuge here? Go hence; when the heath-fowl need\nshelter, they seek it not in the nest of the night-raven.\u0094\n\n\u0093I come to you, father,\u0094 said Isabella, \u0093in my hour of adversity, even\nas you yourself commanded, when you promised your heart and your door\nshould be open to my distress; but I fear--\u0094\n\n\u0093Ha!\u0094 said the Solitary, \u0093then thou art Isabella Vere? Give me a token\nthat thou art she.\u0094\n\n\u0093I have brought you back the rose which you gave me; it has not had time\nto fade ere the hard fate you foretold has come upon me!\u0094\n\n\u0093And if thou hast thus redeemed thy pledge,\u0094 said the Dwarf, \u0093I will not\nforfeit mine. The heart and the door that are shut against every other\nearthly being, shall be open to thee and to thy sorrows.\u0094\n\nShe heard him move in his hut, and presently afterwards strike a light.\nOne by one, bolt and bar were then withdrawn, the heart of Isabella\nthrobbing higher as these obstacles to their meeting were successively\nremoved. The door opened, and the Solitary stood before her, his uncouth\nform and features illuminated by the iron lamp which he held in his\nhand.\n\n\u0093Enter, daughter of affliction,\u0094 he said,--\u0093enter the house of misery.\u0094\n\nShe entered, and observed, with a precaution which increased her\ntrepidation, that the Recluse\u0092s first act, after setting the lamp upon\nthe table, was to replace the numerous bolts which secured the door\nof his hut. She shrunk as she heard the noise which accompanied this\nominous operation, yet remembered Ratcliffe\u0092s caution, and endeavoured\nto suppress all appearance of apprehension. The light of the lamp was\nweak and uncertain; but the Solitary, without taking immediate notice of\nIsabella, otherwise than by motioning her to sit down on a small\nsettle beside the fireplace, made haste to kindle some dry furze, which\npresently cast a blaze through the cottage. Wooden shelves, which bore\na few books, some bundles of dried herbs, and one or two wooden cups and\nplatters, were on one side of the fire; on the other were placed some\nordinary tools of field-labour, mingled with those used by mechanics.\nWhere the bed should have been, there was a wooden frame, strewed with\nwithered moss and rushes, the couch of the ascetic. The whole space of\nthe cottage did not exceed ten feet by six within the walls; and its\nonly furniture, besides what we have mentioned, was a table and two\nstools formed of rough deals.\n\nWithin these narrow precincts Isabella now found herself enclosed with\na being, whose history had nothing to reassure her, and the fearful\nconformation of whose hideous countenance inspired an almost\nsuperstitious terror. He occupied the seat opposite to her, and dropping\nhis huge and shaggy eyebrows over his piercing black eyes, gazed at her\nin silence, as if agitated by a variety of contending feelings. On the\nother side sate Isabella, pale as death, her long hair uncurled by the\nevening damps, and falling over her shoulders and breast, as the wet\nstreamers droop from the mast when the storm has passed away, and left\nthe vessel stranded on the beach. The Dwarf first broke the silence with\nthe sudden, abrupt, and alarming question,--\u0093Woman, what evil fate has\nbrought thee hither?\u0094\n\n\u0093My father\u0092s danger, and your own command,\u0094 she replied faintly, but\nfirmly.\n\n\u0093And you hope for aid from me?\u0094\n\n\u0093If you can bestow it,\u0094 she replied, still in the same tone of mild\nsubmission.\n\n\u0093And how should I possess that power?\u0094 continued the Dwarf, with a\nbitter sneer; \u0093Is mine the form of a redresser of wrongs? Is this the\ncastle in which one powerful enough to be sued to by a fair suppliant\nis likely to hold his residence? I but mocked thee, girl, when I said I\nwould relieve thee.\u0094\n\n\u0093Then must I depart, and face my fate as I best may!\u0094\n\n\u0093No!\u0094 said the Dwarf, rising and interposing between her and the door,\nand motioning to her sternly to resume her seat--\u0093No! you leave me\nnot in this way; we must have farther conference. Why should one being\ndesire aid of another? Why should not each be sufficient to itself? Look\nround you--I, the most despised and most decrepit on Nature\u0092s common,\nhave required sympathy and help from no one. These stones are of my own\npiling; these utensils I framed with my own hands; and with this\u0094--and\nhe laid his hand with a fierce smile on the long dagger which he always\nwore beneath his garment, and unsheathed it so far that the blade\nglimmered clear in the fire-light--\u0093with this,\u0094 he pursued, as he thrust\nthe weapon back into the scabbard, \u0093I can, if necessary, defend the\nvital spark enclosed in this poor trunk, against the fairest and\nstrongest that shall threaten me with injury.\u0094\n\nIt was with difficulty Isabella refrained from screaming out aloud; but\nshe DID refrain.\n\n\u0093This,\u0094 continued the Recluse, \u0093is the life of nature, solitary,\nself-sufficing, and independent. The wolf calls not the wolf to aid him\nin forming his den; and the vulture invites not another to assist her in\nstriking down her prey.\u0094\n\n\u0093And when they are unable to procure themselves support,\u0094 said Isabella,\njudiciously thinking that he would be most accessible to argument\ncouched in his own metaphorical style, \u0093what then is to befall them?\u0094\n\n\u0093Let them starve, die, and be forgotten; it is the common lot of\nhumanity.\u0094\n\n\u0093It is the lot of the wild tribes of nature,\u0094 said Isabella, \u0093but\nchiefly of those who are destined to support themselves by rapine, which\nbrooks no partner; but it is not the law of nature in general; even the\nlower orders have confederacies for mutual defence. But mankind--the\nrace would perish did they cease to aid each other.--From the time\nthat the mother binds the child\u0092s head, till the moment that some kind\nassistant wipes the death-damp from the brow of the dying, we cannot\nexist without mutual help. All, therefore, that need aid, have right to\nask it of their fellow-mortals; no one who has the power of granting can\nrefuse it without guilt.\u0094\n\n\u0093And in this simple hope, poor maiden,\u0094 said the Solitary, \u0093thou hast\ncome into the desert, to seek one whose wish it were that the league\nthou hast spoken of were broken for ever, and that, in very truth, the\nwhole race should perish? Wert thou not frightened?\u0094\n\n\u0093Misery,\u0094 said Isabella, firmly, \u0093is superior to fear.\u0094\n\n\u0093Hast thou not heard it said in thy mortal world, that I have leagued\nmyself with other powers, deformed to the eye and malevolent to the\nhuman race as myself? Hast thou not heard this--And dost thou seek my\ncell at midnight?\u0094\n\n\u0093The Being I worship supports me against such idle fears,\u0094 said\nIsabella; but the increasing agitation of her bosom belied the affected\ncourage which her words expressed.\n\n\u0093Ho! ho!\u0094 said the Dwarf, \u0093thou vauntest thyself a philosopher? Yet,\nshouldst thou not have thought of the danger of intrusting thyself,\nyoung and beautiful, in the power of one so spited against humanity, as\nto place his chief pleasure in defacing, destroying, and degrading her\nfairest works?\u0094\n\nIsabella, much alarmed, continued to answer with firmness, \u0093Whatever\ninjuries you may have sustained in the world, you are incapable of\nrevenging them on one who never wronged you, nor, wilfully, any other.\u0094\n\n\u0093Ay, but, maiden,\u0094 he continued, his dark eyes flashing with an\nexpression of malignity which communicated itself to his wild and\ndistorted features, \u0093revenge is the hungry wolf, which asks only to tear\nflesh and lap blood. Think you the lamb\u0092s plea of innocence would be\nlistened to by him?\u0094\n\n\u0093Man!\u0094 said Isabella, rising, and expressing herself with much dignity,\n\u0093I fear not the horrible ideas with which you would impress me. I cast\nthem from me with disdain. Be you mortal or fiend, you would not offer\ninjury to one who sought you as a suppliant in her utmost need. You\nwould not--you durst not.\u0094\n\n\u0093Thou say\u0092st truly, maiden,\u0094 rejoined the Solitary; \u0093I dare not--I would\nnot. Begone to thy dwelling. Fear nothing with which they threaten thee.\nThou hast asked my protection--thou shalt find it effectual.\u0094\n\n\u0093But, father, this very night I have consented to wed the man that I\nabhor, or I must put the seal to my father\u0092s ruin.\u0094\n\n\u0093This night?--at what hour?\u0094\n\n\u0093Ere midnight.\u0094\n\n\u0093And twilight,\u0094 said the Dwarf, \u0093has already passed away. But fear\nnothing, there is ample time to protect thee.\u0094\n\n\u0093And my father?\u0094 continued Isabella, in a suppliant tone.\n\n\u0093Thy father,\u0094 replied the Dwarf, \u0093has been, and is, my most bitter\nenemy. But fear not; thy virtue shall save him. And now, begone; were\nI to keep thee longer by me, I might again fall into the stupid dreams\nconcerning human worth from which I have been so fearfully awakened. But\nfear nothing--at the very foot of the altar I will redeem thee. Adieu,\ntime presses, and I must act!\u0094\n\nHe led her to the door of the hut, which he opened for her departure.\nShe remounted her horse, which had been feeding in the outer enclosure,\nand pressed him forward by the light of the moon, which was now rising,\nto the spot where she had left Ratcliffe.\n\n\u0093Have you succeeded?\u0094 was his first eager question.\n\n\u0093I have obtained promises from him to whom you sent me; but how can he\npossibly accomplish them?\u0094\n\n\u0093Thank God!\u0094 said Ratcliffe; \u0093doubt not his power to fulfil his\npromise.\u0094\n\nAt this moment a shrill whistle was heard to resound along the heath.\n\n\u0093Hark!\u0094 said Ratcliffe, \u0093he calls me--Miss Vere, return home, and leave\nunbolted the postern-door of the garden; to that which opens on the\nback-stairs I have a private key.\u0094\n\nA second whistle was heard, yet more shrill and prolonged than the\nfirst.\n\n\u0093I come, I come,\u0094 said Ratcliffe; and setting spurs to his horse, rode\nover the heath in the direction of the Recluse\u0092s hut. Miss Vere returned\nto the castle, the mettle of the animal on which she rode, and her own\nanxiety of mind, combining to accelerate her journey.\n\nShe obeyed Ratcliffe\u0092s directions, though without well apprehending\ntheir purpose, and leaving her horse at large in a paddock near\nthe garden, hurried to her own apartment, which she reached without\nobservation. She now unbolted her door, and rang her bell for lights.\nHer father appeared along with the servant who answered her summons.\n\n\u0093He had been twice,\u0094 he said, \u0093listening at her door during the two\nhours that had elapsed since he left her, and, not hearing her speak,\nhad become apprehensive that she was taken ill.\u0094\n\n\u0093And now, my dear father,\u0094 she said, \u0093permit me to claim the promise you\nso kindly gave; let the last moments of freedom which I am to enjoy be\nmine without interruption; and protract to the last moment the respite\nwhich is allowed me.\u0094\n\n\u0093I will,\u0094 said her father; \u0093nor shall you be again interrupted. But this\ndisordered dress--this dishevelled hair--do not let me find you thus\nwhen I call on you again; the sacrifice, to be beneficial, must be\nvoluntary.\u0094\n\n\u0093Must it be so?\u0094 she replied; \u0093then fear not, my father! the victim\nshall be adorned.\u0094\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\n     This looks not like a nuptial.--MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING.\n\nThe chapel in the castle of Ellieslaw, destined to be the scene of this\nill-omened union, was a building of much older date than the castle\nitself, though that claimed considerable antiquity. Before the wars\nbetween England and Scotland had become so common and of such long\nduration, that the buildings along both sides of the Border were chiefly\ndedicated to warlike purposes, there had been a small settlement of\nmonks at Ellieslaw, a dependency, it is believed by antiquaries, on the\nrich Abbey of Jedburgh. Their possessions had long passed away under the\nchanges introduced by war and mutual ravage. A feudal castle had\narisen on the ruin of their cells, and their chapel was included in its\nprecincts.\n\nThe edifice, in its round arches and massive pillars, the simplicity\nof which referred their date to what has been called the Saxon\narchitecture, presented at all times a dark and sombre appearance, and\nhad been frequently used as the cemetery of the family of the feudal\nlords, as well as formerly of the monastic brethren. But it looked\ndoubly gloomy by the effect of the few and smoky torches which were used\nto enlighten it on the present occasion, and which, spreading a glare\nof yellow light in their immediate vicinity, were surrounded beyond by\na red and purple halo reflected from their own smoke, and beyond that\nagain by a zone of darkness which magnified the extent of the chapel,\nwhile it rendered it impossible for the eye to ascertain its limits.\nSome injudicious ornaments, adopted in haste for the occasion, rather\nadded to the dreariness of the scene. Old fragments of tapestry, torn\nfrom the walls of other apartments, had been hastily and partially\ndisposed around those of the chapel, and mingled inconsistently with\nscutcheons and funeral emblems of the dead, which they elsewhere\nexhibited. On each side of the stone altar was a monument, the\nappearance of which formed an equally strange contrast. On the one was\nthe figure, in stone, of some grim hermit, or monk, who had died in\nthe odour of sanctity; he was represented as recumbent, in his cowl and\nscapulaire, with his face turned upward as in the act of devotion, and\nhis hands folded, from which his string of beads was dependent. On\nthe other side was a tomb, in the Italian taste, composed of the most\nbeautiful statuary marble, and accounted a model of modern art. It\nwas erected to the memory of Isabella\u0092s mother, the late Mrs. Vere of\nEllieslaw, who was represented as in a dying posture, while a weeping\ncherub, with eyes averted, seemed in the act of extinguishing a\ndying lamp as emblematic of her speedy dissolution. It was, indeed, a\nmasterpiece of art, but misplaced in the rude vault to which it had been\nconsigned. Many were surprised, and even scandalized, that Ellieslaw,\nnot remarkable for attention to his lady while alive, should erect after\nher death such a costly mausoleum in affected sorrow; others cleared him\nfrom the imputation of hypocrisy, and averred that the monument had\nbeen constructed under the direction and at the sole expense of Mr.\nRatcliffe.\n\nBefore these monuments the wedding guests were assembled. They were\nfew in number; for many had left the castle to prepare for the ensuing\npolitical explosion, and Ellieslaw was, in the circumstances of the\ncase, far from being desirous to extend invitations farther than to\nthose near relations whose presence the custom of the country rendered\nindispensable. Next to the altar stood Sir Frederick Langley, dark,\nmoody, and thoughtful, even beyond his wont, and near him, Mareschal,\nwho was to play the part of bridesman, as it was called. The thoughtless\nhumour of this young gentleman, on which he never deigned to place\nthe least restraint, added to the cloud which overhung the brow of the\nbridegroom.\n\n\u0093The bride is not yet come out of her chamber,\u0094 he whispered to Sir\nFrederick; \u0093I trust that we must not have recourse to the violent\nexpedients of the Romans which I read of at College. It would be hard\nupon my pretty cousin to be run away with twice in two days, though I\nknow none better worth such a violent compliment.\u0094\n\nSir Frederick attempted to turn a deaf ear to this discourse, humming a\ntune, and looking another may, but Mareschal proceeded in the same wild\nmanner.\n\n\u0093This delay is hard upon Dr. Hobbler, who was disturbed to accelerate\npreparations for this joyful event when he had successfully extracted\nthe cork of his third bottle. I hope you will keep him free of the\ncensure of his superiors, for I take it this is beyond canonical\nhours.--But here come Ellieslaw and my pretty cousin--prettier than\never, I think, were it not she seems so faint and so deadly pale--Hark\nye, Sir Knight, if she says not YES with right good-will, it shall be no\nwedding, for all that has come and gone yet.\u0094\n\n\u0093No wedding, sir?\u0094 returned Sir Frederick, in a loud whisper, the\ntone of which indicated that his angry feelings were suppressed with\ndifficulty.\n\n\u0093No--no marriage,\u0094 replied Mareschal, \u0093there\u0092s my hand and glove on\u0092t.\u0094\n\nSir Frederick Langley took his hand, and as he wrung it hard, said in\na lower whisper, \u0093Mareschal, you shall answer this,\u0094 and then flung his\nhand from him.\n\n\u0093That I will readily do,\u0094 said Mareschal, \u0093for never word escaped my\nlips that my hand was not ready to guarantee.-So, speak up, my pretty\ncousin, and tell me if it be your free will and unbiassed resolution to\naccept of this gallant knight for your lord and husband; for if you have\nthe tenth part of a scruple upon the subject, fall back, fall edge, he\nshall not have you.\u0094\n\n\u0093Are you mad, Mr. Mareschal?\u0094 said Ellieslaw, who, having been this\nyoung man\u0092s guardian during his minority, often employed a tone of\nauthority to him. \u0093Do you suppose I would drag my daughter to the foot\nof the altar, were it not her own choice?\u0094\n\n\u0093Tut, Ellieslaw,\u0094 retorted the young gentleman, \u0093never tell me of the\ncontrary; her eyes are full of tears, and her cheeks are whiter than\nher white dress. I must insist, in the name of common humanity, that the\nceremony be adjourned till to-morrow.\u0094\n\n\u0093She shall tell you herself, thou incorrigible intermeddler in what\nconcerns thee not, that it is her wish the ceremony should go on--Is it\nnot, Isabella, my dear?\u0094\n\n\u0093It is,\u0094 said Isabella, half fainting--\u0093since there is no help, either\nin God or man.\u0094\n\nThe first word alone was distinctly audible. Mareschal shrugged up his\nshoulders and stepped back. Ellieslaw led, or rather supported, his\ndaughter to the altar. Sir Frederick moved forward and placed himself by\nher side. The clergyman opened his prayer-book, and looked to Mr. Vere\nfor the signal to commence the service.\n\n\u0093Proceed,\u0094 said the latter.\n\nBut a voice, as if issuing from the tomb of his deceased wife, called,\nin such loud and harsh accents as awakened every echo in the vaulted\nchapel, \u0093Forbear!\u0094\n\nAll were mute and motionless, till a distant rustle, and the clash\nof swords, or something resembling it, was heard from the remote\napartments. It ceased almost instantly.\n\n\u0093What new device is this?\u0094 said Sir Frederick, fiercely, eyeing\nEllieslaw and Mareschal with a glance of malignant suspicion.\n\n\u0093It can be but the frolic of some intemperate guest,\u0094 said Ellieslaw,\nthough greatly confounded; \u0093we must make large allowances for the excess\nof this evening\u0092s festivity. Proceed with the service.\u0094\n\nBefore the clergyman could obey, the same prohibition which they had\nbefore heard, was repeated from the same spot. The female attendants\nscreamed, and fled from the chapel; the gentlemen laid their hands on\ntheir swords. Ere the first moment of surprise had passed by, the Dwarf\nstepped from behind the monument, and placed himself full in front of\nMr. Vere. The effect of so strange and hideous an apparition in such\na place and in such circumstances, appalled all present, but seemed to\nannihilate the Laird of Ellieslaw, who, dropping his daughter\u0092s arm,\nstaggered against the nearest pillar, and, clasping it with his hands as\nif for support, laid his brow against the column.\n\n\u0093Who is this fellow?\u0094 said Sir Frederick; \u0093and what does he mean by this\nintrusion?\u0094\n\n\u0093It is one who comes to tell you,\u0094 said the Dwarf, with the peculiar\nacrimony which usually marked his manner, \u0093that, in marrying that young\nlady, you wed neither the heiress of Ellieslaw, nor of Mauley Hall,\nnor of Polverton, nor of one furrow of land, unless she marries with MY\nconsent; and to thee that consent shall never be given. Down--down\non thy knees, and thank Heaven that thou art prevented from wedding\nqualities with which thou hast no concern--portionless truth, virtue,\nand innocence--thou, base ingrate,\u0094 he continued, addressing himself to\nEllieslaw, \u0093what is thy wretched subterfuge now? Thou, who wouldst sell\nthy daughter to relieve thee from danger, as in famine thou wouldst have\nslain and devoured her to preserve thy own vile life!--Ay, hide thy face\nwith thy hands; well mayst thou blush to look on him whose body thou\ndidst consign to chains, his hand to guilt, and his soul to misery.\nSaved once more by the virtue of her who calls thee father, go hence,\nand may the pardon and benefits I confer on thee prove literal coals of\nfire, till thy brain is seared and scorched like mine!\u0094\n\nEllieslaw left the chapel with a gesture of mute despair.\n\n\u0093Follow him, Hubert Ratcliffe,\u0094 said the Dwarf, \u0093and inform him of his\ndestiny. He will rejoice--for to breathe air and to handle gold is to\nhim happiness.\u0094\n\n\u0093I understand nothing of all this,\u0094 said Sir Frederick Langley; \u0093but we\nare here a body of gentlemen in arms and authority for King James; and\nwhether you really, sir, be that Sir Edward Mauley, who has been so long\nsupposed dead in confinement, or whether you be an impostor assuming\nhis name and title, we will use the freedom of detaining you, till your\nappearance here, at this moment, is better accounted for; we will have\nno spies among us--Seize on him, my friends.\u0094\n\nBut the domestics shrunk back in doubt and alarm. Sir Frederick himself\nstepped forward towards the Recluse, as if to lay hands on his person,\nwhen his progress was suddenly stopped by the glittering point of a\npartisan, which the sturdy hand of Hobbie Elliot presented against his\nbosom.\n\n\u0093I\u0092ll gar daylight shine through ye, if ye offer to steer him!\u0094 said the\nstout Borderer; \u0093stand back, or I\u0092ll strike ye through! Naebody shall\nlay a finger on Elshie; he\u0092s a canny neighbourly man, aye ready to make\na friend help; and, though ye may think him a lamiter, yet, grippie for\ngrippie, friend, I\u0092ll wad a wether he\u0092ll make the bluid spin frae under\nyour nails. He\u0092s a teugh carle Elshie! he grips like a smith\u0092s vice.\u0094\n\n\u0093What has brought you here, Elliot?\u0094 said Mareschal; \u0093who called on you\nfor interference?\u0094\n\n\u0093Troth, Mareschal-Wells,\u0094 answered Hobbie, \u0093I am just come here, wi\u0092\ntwenty or thretty mair o\u0092 us, in my ain name and the King\u0092s--or Queen\u0092s,\nca\u0092 they her? and Canny Elshie\u0092s into the bargain, to keep the peace,\nand pay back some ill usage Ellieslaw has gien me. A bonny breakfast the\nloons gae me the ither morning, and him at the bottom on\u0092t; and trow\nye I wasna ready to supper him up?--Ye needna lay your hands on your\nswords, gentlemen, the house is ours wi\u0092 little din; for the doors were\nopen, and there had been ower muckle punch amang your folk; we took\ntheir swords and pistols as easily as ye wad shiel pea-cods.\u0094\n\nMareschal rushed out, and immediately re-entered the chapel.\n\n\u0093By Heaven! it is true, Sir Frederick; the house is filled with armed\nmen, and our drunken beasts are all disarmed. Draw, and let us fight our\nway.\u0094\n\n\u0093Binna rash--binna rash,\u0094 exclaimed Hobbie; \u0093hear me a bit, hear me a\nbit. We mean ye nae harm; but, as ye are in arms for King James, as\nye ca\u0092 him, and the prelates, we thought it right to keep up the auld\nneighbour war, and stand up for the t\u0092other ane and the Kirk; but we\u0092ll\nno hurt a hair o\u0092 your heads, if ye like to gang hame quietly. And it\nwill be your best way, for there\u0092s sure news come frae Loudoun, that him\nthey ca\u0092 Bang, or Byng, or what is\u0092t, has bang\u0092d the French ships and\nthe new king aff the coast however; sae ye had best bide content wi\u0092\nauld Nanse for want of a better Queen.\u0094\n\nRatcliffe, who at this moment entered, confirmed these accounts so\nunfavourable to the Jacobite interest. Sir Frederick, almost instantly,\nand without taking leave of any one, left the castle, with such of his\nattendants as were able to follow him.\n\n\u0093And what will you do, Mr. Mareschal?\u0094 said Ratcliffe.\n\n\u0093Why, faith,\u0094 answered he, smiling, \u0093I hardly know; my spirit is too\ngreat, and my fortune too small, for me to follow the example of the\ndoughty bridegroom. It is not in my nature, and it is hardly worth my\nwhile.\u0094\n\n\u0093Well, then, disperse your men, and remain quiet, and this will be\noverlooked, as there has been no overt act.\u0094\n\n\u0093Hout, ay,\u0094 said Elliot, \u0093just let byganes be byganes, and a\u0092 friends\nagain; deil ane I bear malice at but Westburnflat, and I hae gien him\nbaith a het skin and a cauld ane. I hadna changed three blows of the\nbroadsword wi\u0092 him before he lap the window into the castle-moat, and\nswattered through it like a wild-duck. He\u0092s a clever fallow, indeed!\nmaun kilt awa wi\u0092 ae bonny lass in the morning, and another at night,\nless wadna serve him! but if he disna kilt himsell out o\u0092 the country,\nI\u0092se kilt him wi\u0092 a tow, for the Castleton meeting\u0092s clean blawn ower;\nhis friends will no countenance him.\u0094\n\nDuring the general confusion, Isabella had thrown herself at the feet of\nher kinsman, Sir Edward Mauley, for so we must now call the Solitary,\nto express at once her gratitude, and to beseech forgiveness for her\nfather. The eyes of all began to be fixed on them, as soon as their own\nagitation and the bustle of the attendants had somewhat abated. Miss\nVere kneeled beside the tomb of her mother, to whose statue her features\nexhibited a marked resemblance. She held the hand of the Dwarf,\nwhich she kissed repeatedly and bathed with tears. He stood fixed and\nmotionless, excepting that his eyes glanced alternately on the marble\nfigure and the living suppliant. At length, the large drops which\ngathered on his eye-lashes compelled him to draw his hand across them.\n\n\u0093I thought,\u0094 he said, \u0093that tears and I had done; but we shed them at\nour birth, and their spring dries not until we are in our graves. But no\nmelting of the heart shall dissolve my resolution. I part here, at once,\nand for ever, with all of which the memory\u0094 (looking to the tomb), \u0093or\nthe presence\u0094 (he pressed Isabella\u0092s hand), \u0093is dear to me.--Speak not\nto me! attempt not to thwart my determination! it will avail nothing;\nyou will hear of and see this lump of deformity no more. To you I shall\nbe dead ere I am actually in my grave, and you will think of me as of a\nfriend disencumbered from the toils and crimes of existence.\u0094\n\nHe kissed Isabella on the forehead, impressed another kiss on the\nbrow of the statue by which she knelt, and left the chapel followed by\nRatcliffe. Isabella, almost exhausted by the emotions of the day,\nwas carried to her apartment by her women. Most of the other guests\ndispersed, after having separately endeavoured to impress on all who\nwould listen to them their disapprobation of the plots formed against\nthe government, or their regret for having engaged in them. Hobbie\nElliot assumed the command of the castle for the night, and mounted a\nregular guard. He boasted not a little of the alacrity with which his\nfriends and he had obeyed a hasty summons received from Elshie through\nthe faithful Ratcliffe. And it was a lucky chance, he said, that on that\nvery day they had got notice that Westburnflat did not intend to\nkeep his tryste at Castleton, but to hold them at defiance; so that a\nconsiderable party had assembled at the Heugh-foot, with the intention\nof paying a visit to the robber\u0092s tower on the ensuing morning, and\ntheir course was easily directed to Ellieslaw Castle.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\n     --Last scene of all,\n     To close this strange eventful history.--AS YOU LIKE IT.\n\nOn the next morning, Mr. Ratcliffe presented Miss Vere with a letter\nfrom her father, of which the following is the tenor:--\n\n\u0093MY DEAREST CHILD, The malice of a persecuting government will compel\nme, for my own safety, to retreat abroad, and to remain for some time\nin foreign parts. I do not ask you to accompany, or follow me; you will\nattend to my interest and your own more effectually by remaining where\nyou are. It is unnecessary to enter into a minute detail concerning the\ncauses of the strange events which yesterday took place. I think I have\nreason to complain of the usage I have received from Sir Edward Mauley,\nwho is your nearest kinsman by the mother\u0092s side; but as he has declared\nyou his heir, and is to put you in immediate possession of a large part\nof his fortune, I account it a full atonement. I am aware he has never\nforgiven the preference which your mother gave to my addresses, instead\nof complying with the terms of a sort of family compact, which absurdly\nand tyrannically destined her to wed her deformed relative. The shock\nwas even sufficient to unsettle his wits (which, indeed, were never\nover-well arranged), and I had, as the husband of his nearest kinswoman\nand heir, the delicate task of taking care of his person and property,\nuntil he was reinstated in the management of the latter by those who, no\ndoubt, thought they were doing him justice; although, if some parts of\nhis subsequent conduct be examined, it will appear that he ought,\nfor his own sake, to have been left under the influence of a mild and\nsalutary restraint.\n\n\u0093In one particular, however, he showed a sense of the ties of blood,\nas well as of his own frailty; for while he sequestered himself closely\nfrom the world, under various names and disguises, and insisted on\nspreading a report of his own death (in which to gratify him I willingly\nacquiesced), he left at my disposal the rents of a great proportion of\nhis estates, and especially all those, which, having belonged to your\nmother, reverted to him as a male fief. In this he may have thought\nthat he was acting with extreme generosity, while, in the opinion of all\nimpartial men, he will only be considered as having fulfilled a natural\nobligation, seeing that, in justice, if not in strict law, you must\nbe considered as the heir of your mother, and I as your legal\nadministrator. Instead, therefore, of considering myself as loaded\nwith obligations to Sir Edward on this account, I think I had reason\nto complain that these remittances were only doled out to me at the\npleasure of Mr. Ratcliffe, who, moreover, exacted from me mortgages\nover my paternal estate of Ellieslaw for any sums which I required as an\nextra advance; and thus may be said to have insinuated himself into the\nabsolute management and control of my property. Or, if all this seeming\nfriendship was employed by Sir Edward for the purpose of obtaining a\ncomplete command of my affairs, and acquiring the power of ruining me\nat his pleasure, I feel myself, I must repeat, still less bound by the\nalleged obligation.\n\n\u0093About the autumn of last year, as I understand, either his own crazed\nimagination, or the accomplishment of some such scheme as I have hinted,\nbrought him down to this country. His alleged motive, it seems, was a\ndesire of seeing a monument which he had directed to be raised in the\nchapel over the tomb of your mother. Mr. Ratcliffe, who at this time\nhad done me the honour to make my house his own, had the complaisance to\nintroduce him secretly into the chapel. The consequence, as he informs\nme, was a frenzy of several hours, during which he fled into the\nneighbouring moors, in one of the wildest spots of which he chose, when\nhe was somewhat recovered, to fix his mansion, and set up for a sort of\ncountry empiric, a character which, even in his best days, he was fond\nof assuming. It is remarkable, that, instead of informing me of these\ncircumstances, that I might have had the relative of my late wife taken\nsuch care of as his calamitous condition required, Mr. Ratcliffe seems\nto have had such culpable indulgence for his irregular plans as to\npromise and even swear secrecy concerning them. He visited Sir Edward\noften, and assisted in the fantastic task he had taken upon him of\nconstructing a hermitage. Nothing they appear to have dreaded more than\na discovery of their intercourse.\n\n\u0093The ground was open in every direction around, and a small subterranean\ncave, probably sepulchral, which their researches had detected near\nthe great granite pillar, served to conceal Ratcliffe, when any one\napproached his master. I think you will be of opinion, my love, that\nthis secrecy must have had some strong motive. It is also remarkable,\nthat while I thought my unhappy friend was residing among the Monks of\nLa Trappe, he should have been actually living, for many months, in this\nbizarre disguise, within five miles of my house, and obtaining regular\ninformation of my most private movements, either by Ratcliffe, or\nthrough Westburnflat or others, whom he had the means to bribe to any\nextent. He makes it a crime against me that I endeavoured to establish\nyour marriage with Sir Frederick. I acted for the best; but if Sir\nEdward Mauley thought otherwise, why did he not step manfully forward,\nexpress his own purpose of becoming a party to the settlements, and take\nthat interest which he is entitled to claim in you as heir to his great\nproperty?\n\n\u0093Even now, though your rash and eccentric relation is somewhat tardy in\nannouncing his purpose, I am far from opposing my authority against\nhis wishes, although the person he desires you to regard as your future\nhusband be young Earnscliff; the very last whom I should have thought\nlikely to be acceptable to him, considering a certain fatal event. But I\ngive my free and hearty consent, providing the settlements are drawn in\nsuch an irrevocable form as may secure my child from suffering by\nthat state of dependence, and that sudden and causeless revocation of\nallowances, of which I have so much reason to complain. Of Sir Frederick\nLangley, I augur, you will hear no more. He is not likely to claim the\nhand of a dowerless maiden. I therefore commit you, my dear Isabella, to\nthe wisdom of Providence and to your own prudence, begging you to lose\nno time in securing those advantages, which the fickleness of your\nkinsman has withdrawn from me to shower upon you.\n\n\u0093Mr. Ratcliffe mentioned Sir Edward\u0092s intention to settle a considerable\nsum upon me yearly, for my maintenance in foreign parts; but this my\nheart is too proud to accept from him. I told him I had a dear child,\nwho, while in affluence herself, would never suffer me to be in poverty.\nI thought it right to intimate this to him pretty roundly, that whatever\nincrease be settled upon you, it may be calculated so as to cover this\nnecessary and natural encumbrance. I shall willingly settle upon you\nthe castle and manor of Ellieslaw, to show my parental affection and\ndisinterested zeal for promoting your settlement in life. The annual\ninterest of debts charged on the estate somewhat exceeds the income,\neven after a reasonable rent has been put upon the mansion and mains.\nBut as all the debts are in the person of Mr. Ratcliffe, as your\nkinsman\u0092s trustee, he will not be a troublesome creditor. And here I\nmust make you aware, that though I have to complain of Mr. Ratcliffe\u0092s\nconduct to me personally, I, nevertheless, believe him a just and\nupright man, with whom you may safely consult on your affairs, not to\nmention that to cherish his good opinion will be the best way to retain\nthat of your kinsman. Remember me to Marchie--I hope he will not be\ntroubled on account of late matters. I will write more fully from the\nContinent. Meanwhile, I rest your loving father, RICHARD VERE.\u0094\n\nThe above letter throws the only additional light which we have been\nable to procure upon the earlier part of our story. It was Hobbie\u0092s\nopinion, and may be that of most of our readers, that the Recluse\nof Mucklestane-Moor had but a kind of a gleaming, or twilight\nunderstanding; and that he had neither very clear views as to what he\nhimself wanted, nor was apt to pursue his ends by the clearest and most\ndirect means; so that to seek the clew of his conduct, was likened, by\nHobbie, to looking for a straight path through a common, over which are\na hundred devious tracks, but not one distinct line of road.\n\nWhen Isabella had perused the letter, her first enquiry was after her\nfather. He had left the castle, she was informed, early in the morning,\nafter a long interview with Mr. Ratcliffe, and was already far on his\nway to the next port, where he might expect to find shipping for the\nContinent.\n\n\u0093Where was Sir Edward Mauley?\u0094\n\nNo one had seen the Dwarf since the eventful scene of the preceding\nevening.\n\n\u0093Odd, if onything has befa\u0092en puir Elshie,\u0094 said Hobbie Elliot, \u0093I wad\nrather I were harried ower again.\u0094\n\nHe immediately rode to his dwelling, and the remaining she-goat came\nbleating to meet him, for her milking time was long past. The Solitary\nwas nowhere to be seen; his door, contrary to wont, was open, his fire\nextinguished, and the whole hut was left in the state which it exhibited\non Isabella\u0092s visit to him. It was pretty clear that the means of\nconveyance which had brought the Dwarf to Ellieslaw on the preceding\nevening, had removed him from it to some other place of abode. Hobbie\nreturned disconsolate to the castle.\n\n\u0093I am doubting we hae lost Canny Elshie for gude an\u0092 a\u0092.\u0094\n\n\u0093You have indeed,\u0094 said Ratcliffe, producing a paper, which he put into\nHobbie\u0092s hands; \u0093but read that, and you will perceive you have been no\nloser by having known him.\u0094\n\nIt was a short deed of gift, by which \u0093Sir Edward Mauley, otherwise\ncalled Elshender the Recluse, endowed Halbert or Hobbie Elliot, and\nGrace Armstrong, in full property, with a considerable sum borrowed by\nElliot from him.\u0094\n\nHobbie\u0092s joy was mingled with feelings which brought tears down his\nrough cheeks.\n\n\u0093It\u0092s a queer thing,\u0094 he said; \u0093but I canna joy in the gear, unless I\nkend the puir body was happy that gave it me.\u0094\n\n\u0093Next to enjoying happiness ourselves,\u0094 said Ratcliffe, \u0093is the\nconsciousness of having bestowed it on others. Had all my master\u0092s\nbenefits been conferred like the present, what a different return would\nthey have produced! But the indiscriminate profusion that would glut\navarice, or supply prodigality, neither does good, nor is rewarded by\ngratitude. It is sowing the wind to reap the whirlwind.\u0094\n\n\u0093And that wad be a light har\u0092st,\u0094 said Hobbie; \u0093but, wi\u0092 my young\nleddie\u0092s leave, I wad fain take down Eishie\u0092s skeps o\u0092 bees, and set\nthem in Grace\u0092s bit flower yard at the Heugh-foot--they shall ne\u0092er be\nsmeekit by ony o\u0092 huz. And the puir goat, she would be negleckit about a\ngreat toun like this; and she could feed bonnily on our lily lea by the\nburn side, and the hounds wad ken her in a day\u0092s time, and never fash\nher, and Grace wad milk her ilka morning wi\u0092 her ain hand, for Elshie\u0092s\nsake; for though he was thrawn and cankered in his converse, he likeit\ndumb creatures weel.\u0094\n\nHobbie\u0092s requests were readily granted, not without some wonder at\nthe natural delicacy of feeling which pointed out to him this mode of\ndisplaying his gratitude. He was delighted when Ratcliffe informed him\nthat his benefactor should not remain ignorant of the care which he took\nof his favourite.\n\n\u0093And mind be sure and tell him that grannie and the titties, and,\nabune a\u0092, Grace and mysell, are weel and thriving, and that it\u0092s a\u0092 his\ndoing--that canna but please him, ane wad think.\u0094\n\nAnd Elliot and the family at Heugh-foot were, and continued to be, as\nfortunate and happy as his undaunted honesty, tenderness, and gallantry\nso well merited.\n\nAll bar between the marriage of Earnscliff and Isabella was now removed,\nand the settlements which Ratcliffe produced on the part of Sir Edward\nMauley, might have satisfied the cupidity of Ellieslaw himself. But Miss\nVere and Ratcliffe thought it unnecessary to mention to Earnscliff that\none great motive of Sir Edward, in thus loading the young pair with\nbenefits, was to expiate his having, many years before, shed the blood\nof his father in a hasty brawl. If it be true, as Ratcliffe asserted,\nthat the Dwarf\u0092s extreme misanthropy seemed to relax somewhat, under\nthe consciousness of having diffused happiness among so many, the\nrecollection of this circumstance might probably be one of his chief\nmotives for refusing obstinately ever to witness their state of\ncontentment.\n\nMareschal hunted, shot, and drank claret--tired of the country, went\nabroad, served three campaigns, came home, and married Lucy Ilderton.\n\nYears fled over the heads of Earnscliff and his wife, and found and left\nthem contented and happy. The scheming ambition of Sir Frederick\nLangley engaged him in the unfortunate insurrection of 1715. He was made\nprisoner at Preston, in Lancashire, with the Earl of Derwentwater,\nand others. His defence, and the dying speech which he made at his\nexecution, may be found in the State Trials. Mr. Vere, supplied by\nhis daughter with an ample income, continued to reside abroad, engaged\ndeeply in the affair of Law\u0092s bank during the regency of the Duke of\nOrleans, and was at one time supposed to be immensely rich. But, on the\nbursting of that famous bubble, he was so much chagrined at being\nagain reduced to a moderate annuity (although he saw thousands of his\ncompanions in misfortune absolutely starving), that vexation of mind\nbrought on a paralytic stroke, of which he died, after lingering under\nits effects a few weeks.\n\nWillie of Westburnflat fled from the wrath of Hobbie Elliot, as his\nbetters did from the pursuit of the law. His patriotism urged him to\nserve his country abroad, while his reluctance to leave his native soil\npressed him rather to remain in the beloved island, and collect purses,\nwatches, and rings on the highroads at home. Fortunately for him, the\nfirst impulse prevailed, and he joined the army under Marlborough;\nobtained a commission to which he was recommended by his services in\ncollecting cattle for the commissariat; returned home after many\nyears, with some money (how come by Heaven only knows),--demolished\nthe peel-house at Westburnflat, and built, in its stead, a high narrow\nONSTEAD, of three stories, with a chimney at each end--drank brandy with\nthe neighbours, whom, in his younger days, he had plundered--died in his\nbed, and is recorded upon his tombstone at Kirkwhistle (still extant),\nas having played all the parts of a brave soldier, a discreet neighbour,\nand a sincere Christian.\n\nMr. Ratcliffe resided usually with the family at Ellieslaw, but\nregularly every spring and autumn he absented himself for about a month.\nOn the direction and purpose of his periodical journey he remained\nsteadily silent; but it was well understood that he was then in\nattendance on his unfortunate patron. At length, on his return from\none of these visits, his grave countenance, and deep mourning dress,\nannounced to the Ellieslaw family that their benefactor was no more. Sir\nEdward\u0092s death made no addition to their fortune, for he had divested\nhimself of his property during his lifetime, and chiefly in their\nfavour. Ratcliffe, his sole confidant, died at a good old age, but\nwithout ever naming the place to which his master had finally retired,\nor the manner of his death, or the place of his burial. It was supposed\nthat on all these particulars his patron had enjoined him strict\nsecrecy.\n\nThe sudden disappearance of Elshie from his extraordinary hermitage\ncorroborated the reports which the common people had spread concerning\nhim. Many believed that, having ventured to enter a consecrated\nbuilding, contrary to his paction with the Evil One, he had been bodily\ncarried off while on his return to his cottage; but most are of opinion\nthat he only disappeared for a season, and continues to be seen from\ntime to time among the hills. And retaining, according to custom, a\nmore vivid recollection of his wild and desperate language, than of the\nbenevolent tendency of most of his actions, he is usually identified\nwith the malignant demon called the Man of the Moors, whose feats were\nquoted by Mrs. Elliot to her grandsons; and, accordingly, is generally\nrepresented as bewitching the sheep, causing the ewes to KEB, that is,\nto cast their lambs, or seen loosening the impending wreath of snow\nto precipitate its weight on such as take shelter, during the storm,\nbeneath the bank of a torrent, or under the shelter of a deep glen. In\nshort, the evils most dreaded and deprecated by the inhabitants of that\npastoral country, are ascribed to the agency of the BLACK DWARF.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Black Dwarf, by Sir Walter Scott\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE BLACK DWARF ***\n\n***** This file should be named 1460-0.txt or 1460-0.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/1\/4\/6\/1460\/\n\nProduced by An Anonymous Volunteer and David Widger\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\u0092s\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\u0092s EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1172,"split":"test"}
