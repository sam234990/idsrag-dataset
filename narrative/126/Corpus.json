Jerry's owner was Mr. Haggin, who worked as a plantation guard and used Jerry to chase black slaves. Higgin gave Jerry to Mr. Van Horn, Captain of ship Arangi, under condition to return the dog if something bad happens. The ship was engaged in delivering so-called \"reverse\" slaves who worked for three years on a plantation. During a stop on Malaita island, Arangi was attacked by the natives, who killed the captain and skipper. Jerry was kicked from the ship, which was looted and burned. A native boy found Jerry in the sea and delivered the dog on the shore. Later, Jerry was brought to a village, where tribe chief Bashto decided to use Jerry for improving the breed of local dogs. Jerry received a taboo status and began to live among the tribemen.\nJerry led a fairly quiet life until local sorcerer Agno decided to use the dog for a sacrifice. To overcome its taboo status, Agno arranged Jerry to attack a holy bird megapoda, which also had a taboo status. Jerry stole the bird eggs, which were kept for chief Bashta. Jerry was spotted while killing the fourth bird. The bird's taboo status was higher than that of Jerry; therefore, the dog could be sacrificed. However, old blindman Nalasu bought Jerry for a pig to protect himself against an expected vendetta.\nLater, the village was destroyed by Brits as a part of punitive operation to retaliate for the loss of Arangi. Jerry escaped and hid in the jungle. Having stayed there for a long time, Jerry began to look for people. Out in the beach, the dog saw a distant ship and plunged into the sea, thinking it is Arangi and hoping to see his beloved Captain Van Horn. The ship was the yacht Ariel traveling around the world. People on board noticed the dog and saved it.\nOne of the crewmen recognized the dog and announced that it is a dog of Mr. Haggin form Santa Isabel Island. Later, the yacht arrived at Tulagi harbor, where a commissioner who new Mr. Haggin sent him a message. Mr. Haggin sailed to the island with dog Michael, who was the brother of Jerry. Tho brothers\u00e2\u0080\u0094Jerry and Michael\u00e2\u0080\u0094met each other just to be separated ten days later.

Several years ago\nI published a South Sea novel.  The action was placed in the Solomon\nIslands.  The action was praised by the critics and reviewers as a highly\ncreditable effort of the imagination.  As regards reality--they said\nthere wasn't any.  Of course, as every one knew, kinky-haired cannibals\nno longer obtained on the earth's surface, much less ran around with\nnothing on, chopping off one another's heads, and, on occasion, a white\nman's head as well.\n\nNow listen.  I am writing these lines in Honolulu, Hawaii.  Yesterday, on\nthe beach at Waikiki, a stranger spoke to me.  He mentioned a mutual\nfriend, Captain Kellar.  When I was wrecked in the Solomons on the\nblackbirder, the _Minota_, it was Captain Kellar, master of the\nblackbirder, the _Eugenie_, who rescued me.  The blacks had taken Captain\nKellar's head, the stranger told me.  He knew.  He had represented\nCaptain Kellar's mother in settling up the estate.\n\nListen.  I received a letter the other day from Mr. C. M. Woodford,\nResident Commissioner of the British Solomons.  He was back at his post,\nafter a long furlough to England, where he had entered his son into\nOxford.  A search of the shelves of almost any public library will bring\nto light a book entitled, \"A Naturalist Among the Head Hunters.\"  Mr. C.\nM. Woodford is the naturalist.  He wrote the book.\n\nTo return to his letter.  In the course of the day's work he casually and\nbriefly mentioned a particular job he had just got off his hands.  His\nabsence in England had been the cause of delay.  The job had been to make\na punitive expedition to a neighbouring island, and, incidentally, to\nrecover the heads of some mutual friends of ours--a white-trader, his\nwhite wife and children, and his white clerk.  The expedition was\nsuccessful, and Mr. Woodford concluded his account of the episode with a\nstatement to the effect: \"What especially struck me was the absence of\npain and terror in their faces, which seemed to express, rather, serenity\nand repose\"--this, mind you, of men and women of his own race whom he\nknew well and who had sat at dinner with him in his own house.\n\nOther friends, with whom I have sat at dinner in the brave, rollicking\ndays in the Solomons have since passed out--by the same way.  My\ngoodness!  I sailed in the teak-built ketch, the _Minota_, on a\nblackbirding cruise to Malaita, and I took my wife along.  The hatchet-\nmarks were still raw on the door of our tiny stateroom advertising an\nevent of a few months before.  The event was the taking of Captain\nMackenzie's head, Captain Mackenzie, at that time, being master of the\nMinota.  As we sailed in to Langa-Langa, the British cruiser, the\n_Cambrian_, steamed out from the shelling of a village.\n\nIt is not expedient to burden this preliminary to my story with further\ndetails, which I do make asseveration I possess a-plenty.  I hope I have\ngiven some assurance that the adventures of my dog hero in this novel are\nreal adventures in a very real cannibal world.  Bless you!--when I took\nmy wife along on the cruise of the _Minota_, we found on board a nigger-\nchasing, adorable Irish terrier puppy, who was smooth-coated like Jerry,\nand whose name was Peggy.  Had it not been for Peggy, this book would\nnever have been written.  She was the chattel of the _Minota's_ splendid\nskipper.  So much did Mrs. London and I come to love her, that Mrs.\nLondon, after the wreck of the _Minota_, deliberately and shamelessly\nstole her from the _Minota's_ skipper.  I do further admit that I did,\ndeliberately and shamelessly, compound my wife's felony.  We loved Peggy\nso!  Dear royal, glorious little dog, buried at sea off the east coast of\nAustralia!\n\nI must add that Peggy, like Jerry, was born at Meringe Lagoon, on Meringe\nPlantation, which is of the Island of Ysabel, said Ysabel Island lying\nnext north of Florida Island, where is the seat of government and where\ndwells the Resident Commissioner, Mr. C. M. Woodford.  Still further and\nfinally, I knew Peggy's mother and father well, and have often known the\nwarm surge in the heart of me at the sight of that faithful couple\nrunning side by side along the beach.  Terrence was his real name.  Her\nname was Biddy.\n\nJACK LONDON\nWAIKIKI BEACH,\nHONOLULU, OAHU, T.H.\nJune 5, 1915\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nNot until _Mister_ Haggin abruptly picked him up under one arm and\nstepped into the sternsheets of the waiting whaleboat, did Jerry dream\nthat anything untoward was to happen to him.  _Mister_ Haggin was Jerry's\nbeloved master, and had been his beloved master for the six months of\nJerry's life.  Jerry did not know _Mister_ Haggin as \"master,\" for\n\"master\" had no place in Jerry's vocabulary, Jerry being a smooth-coated,\ngolden-sorrel Irish terrier.\n\nBut in Jerry's vocabulary, \"_Mister_ Haggin\" possessed all the\ndefiniteness of sound and meaning that the word \"master\" possesses in the\nvocabularies of humans in relation to their dogs.  \"_Mister_ Haggin\" was\nthe sound Jerry had always heard uttered by Bob, the clerk, and by Derby,\nthe foreman on the plantation, when they addressed his master.  Also,\nJerry had always heard the rare visiting two-legged man-creatures such as\ncame on the _Arangi_, address his master as _Mister_ Haggin.\n\nBut dogs being dogs, in their dim, inarticulate, brilliant, and heroic-\nworshipping ways misappraising humans, dogs think of their masters, and\nlove their masters, more than the facts warrant.  \"Master\" means to them,\nas \"_Mister_\" Haggin meant to Jerry, a deal more, and a great deal more,\nthan it means to humans.  The human considers himself as \"master\" to his\ndog, but the dog considers his master \"God.\"\n\nNow \"God\" was no word in Jerry's vocabulary, despite the fact that he\nalready possessed a definite and fairly large vocabulary.  \"_Mister_\nHaggin\" was the sound that meant \"God.\"  In Jerry's heart and head, in\nthe mysterious centre of all his activities that is called consciousness,\nthe sound, \"_Mister_ Haggin,\" occupied the same place that \"God\" occupies\nin human consciousness.  By word and sound, to Jerry, \"_Mister_ Haggin\"\nhad the same connotation that \"God\" has to God-worshipping humans.  In\nshort, _Mister_ Haggin was Jerry's God.\n\nAnd so, when _Mister_ Haggin, or God, or call it what one will with the\nlimitations of language, picked Jerry up with imperative abruptness,\ntucked him under his arm, and stepped into the whaleboat, whose black\ncrew immediately bent to the oars, Jerry was instantly and nervously\naware that the unusual had begun to happen.  Never before had he gone out\non board the _Arangi_, which he could see growing larger and closer to\neach lip-hissing stroke of the oars of the blacks.\n\nOnly an hour before, Jerry had come down from the plantation house to the\nbeach to see the _Arangi_ depart.  Twice before, in his half-year of\nlife, had he had this delectable experience.  Delectable it truly was,\nrunning up and down the white beach of sand-pounded coral, and, under the\nwise guidance of Biddy and Terrence, taking part in the excitement of the\nbeach and even adding to it.\n\nThere was the nigger-chasing.  Jerry had been born to hate niggers.  His\nfirst experiences in the world as a puling puppy, had taught him that\nBiddy, his mother, and his father Terrence, hated niggers.  A nigger was\nsomething to be snarled at.  A nigger, unless he were a house-boy, was\nsomething to be attacked and bitten and torn if he invaded the compound.\nBiddy did it.  Terrence did it.  In doing it, they served their\nGod--_Mister_ Haggin.  Niggers were two-legged lesser creatures who\ntoiled and slaved for their two-legged white lords, who lived in the\nlabour barracks afar off, and who were so much lesser and lower that they\nmust not dare come near the habitation of their lords.\n\nAnd nigger-chasing was adventure.  Not long after he had learned to\nsprawl, Jerry had learned that.  One took his chances.  As long as\n_Mister_ Haggin, or Derby, or Bob, was about, the niggers took their\nchasing.  But there were times when the white lords were not about.  Then\nit was \"'Ware niggers!\"  One must dare to chase only with due precaution.\nBecause then, beyond the white lord's eyes, the niggers had a way, not\nmerely of scowling and muttering, but of attacking four-legged dogs with\nstones and clubs.  Jerry had seen his mother so mishandled, and, ere he\nhad learned discretion, alone in the high grass had been himself club-\nmauled by Godarmy, the black who wore a china door-knob suspended on his\nchest from his neck on a string of sennit braided from cocoanut fibre.\nMore.  Jerry remembered another high-grass adventure, when he and his\nbrother Michael had fought Owmi, another black distinguishable for the\ncogged wheels of an alarm clock on his chest.  Michael had been so\nseverely struck on his head that for ever after his left ear had remained\nsore and had withered into a peculiar wilted and twisted upward cock.\n\nStill more.  There had been his brother Patsy, and his sister Kathleen,\nwho had disappeared two months before, who had ceased and no longer were.\nThe great god, _Mister_ Haggin, had raged up and down the plantation.  The\nbush had been searched.  Half a dozen niggers had been whipped.  And\n_Mister_ Haggin had failed to solve the mystery of Patsy's and Kathleen's\ndisappearance.  But Biddy and Terrence knew.  So did Michael and Jerry.\nThe four-months' old Patsy and Kathleen had gone into the cooking-pot at\nthe barracks, and their puppy-soft skins had been destroyed in the fire.\nJerry knew this, as did his father and mother and brother, for they had\nsmelled the unmistakable burnt-meat smell, and Terrence, in his rage of\nknowledge, had even attacked Mogom the house-boy, and been reprimanded\nand cuffed by _Mister_ Haggin, who had not smelled and did not\nunderstand, and who had always to impress discipline on all creatures\nunder his roof-tree.\n\nBut on the beach, when the blacks, whose terms of service were up came\ndown with their trade-boxes on their heads to depart on the _Arangi_, was\nthe time when nigger-chasing was not dangerous.  Old scores could be\nsettled, and it was the last chance, for the blacks who departed on the\n_Arangi_ never came back.  As an instance, this very morning Biddy,\nremembering a secret mauling at the hands of Lerumie, laid teeth into his\nnaked calf and threw him sprawling into the water, trade-box, earthly\npossessions and all, and then laughed at him, sure in the protection of\n_Mister_ Haggin who grinned at the episode.\n\nThen, too, there was usually at least one bush-dog on the _Arangi_ at\nwhich Jerry and Michael, from the beach, could bark their heads off.\nOnce, Terrence, who was nearly as large as an Airedale and fully as lion-\nhearted--Terrence the Magnificent, as Tom Haggin called him--had caught\nsuch a bush-dog trespassing on the beach and given him a delightful\nthrashing, in which Jerry and Michael, and Patsy and Kathleen, who were\nat the time alive, had joined with many shrill yelps and sharp nips.\nJerry had never forgotten the ecstasy of the hair, unmistakably doggy in\nscent, which had filled his mouth at his one successful nip.  Bush-dogs\nwere dogs--he recognized them as his kind; but they were somehow\ndifferent from his own lordly breed, different and lesser, just as the\nblacks were compared with _Mister_ Haggin, Derby, and Bob.\n\nBut Jerry did not continue to gaze at the nearing _Arangi_.  Biddy, wise\nwith previous bitter bereavements, had sat down on the edge of the sand,\nher fore-feet in the water, and was mouthing her woe.  That this\nconcerned him, Jerry knew, for her grief tore sharply, albeit vaguely, at\nhis sensitive, passionate heart.  What it presaged he knew not, save that\nit was disaster and catastrophe connected with him.  As he looked back at\nher, rough-coated and grief-stricken, he could see Terrence hovering\nsolicitously near her.  He, too, was rough-coated, as was Michael, and as\nPatsy and Kathleen had been, Jerry being the one smooth-coated member of\nthe family.\n\nFurther, although Jerry did not know it and Tom Haggin did, Terrence was\na royal lover and a devoted spouse.  Jerry, from his earliest\nimpressions, could remember the way Terrence had of running with Biddy,\nmiles and miles along the beaches or through the avenues of cocoanuts,\nside by side with her, both with laughing mouths of sheer delight.  As\nthese were the only dogs, besides his brothers and sisters and the\nseveral eruptions of strange bush-dogs that Jerry knew, it did not enter\nhis head otherwise than that this was the way of dogs, male and female,\nwedded and faithful.  But Tom Haggin knew its unusualness.  \"Proper\naffinities,\" he declared, and repeatedly declared, with warm voice and\nmoist eyes of appreciation.  \"A gentleman, that Terrence, and a\nfour-legged proper man.  A man-dog, if there ever was one, four-square as\nthe legs on the four corners of him.  And prepotent!  My word!  His\nblood'd breed true for a thousand generations, and the cool head and the\nkindly brave heart of him.\"\n\nTerrence did not voice his sorrow, if sorrow he had; but his hovering\nabout Biddy tokened his anxiety for her.  Michael, however, yielding to\nthe contagion, sat beside his mother and barked angrily out across the\nincreasing stretch of water as he would have barked at any danger that\ncrept and rustled in the jungle.  This, too, sank to Jerry's heart,\nadding weight to his sure intuition that dire fate, he knew not what, was\nupon him.\n\nFor his six months of life, Jerry knew a great deal and knew very little.\nHe knew, without thinking about it, without knowing that he knew, why\nBiddy, the wise as well as the brave, did not act upon all the message\nthat her heart voiced to him, and spring into the water and swim after\nhim.  She had protected him like a lioness when the big _puarka_ (which,\nin Jerry's vocabulary, along with grunts and squeals, was the combination\nof sound, or word, for \"pig\") had tried to devour him where he was\ncornered under the high-piled plantation house.  Like a lioness, when the\ncook-boy had struck him with a stick to drive him out of the kitchen, had\nBiddy sprung upon the black, receiving without wince or whimper one\nstraight blow from the stick, and then downing him and mauling him among\nhis pots and pans until dragged (for the first time snarling) away by the\nunchiding _Mister_ Haggin, who; however, administered sharp words to the\ncook-boy for daring to lift hand against a four-legged dog belonging to a\ngod.\n\nJerry knew why his mother did not plunge into the water after him.  The\nsalt sea, as well as the lagoons that led out of the salt sea, were\ntaboo.  \"Taboo,\" as word or sound, had no place in Jerry's vocabulary.\nBut its definition, or significance, was there in the quickest part of\nhis consciousness.  He possessed a dim, vague, imperative knowingness\nthat it was not merely not good, but supremely disastrous, leading to the\nmistily glimpsed sense of utter endingness for a dog, for any dog, to go\ninto the water where slipped and slid and noiselessly paddled, sometimes\non top, sometimes emerging from the depths, great scaly monsters, huge-\njawed and horribly-toothed, that snapped down and engulfed a dog in an\ninstant just as the fowls of _Mister_ Haggin snapped and engulfed grains\nof corn.\n\nOften he had heard his father and mother, on the safety of the sand, bark\nand rage their hatred of those terrible sea-dwellers, when, close to the\nbeach, they appeared on the surface like logs awash.  \"Crocodile\" was no\nword in Jerry's vocabulary.  It was an image, an image of a log awash\nthat was different from any log in that it was alive.  Jerry, who heard,\nregistered, and recognized many words that were as truly tools of thought\nto him as they were to humans, but who, by inarticulateness of birth and\nbreed, could not utter these many words, nevertheless in his mental\nprocesses, used images just as articulate men use words in their own\nmental processes.  And after all, articulate men, in the act of thinking,\nwilly nilly use images that correspond to words and that amplify words.\n\nPerhaps, in Jerry's brain, the rising into the foreground of\nconsciousness of an image of a log awash connoted more intimate and\nfuller comprehension of the thing being thought about, than did the word\n\"crocodile,\" and its accompanying image, in the foreground of a human's\nconsciousness.  For Jerry really did know more about crocodiles than the\naverage human.  He could smell a crocodile farther off and more\ndifferentiatingly than could any man, than could even a salt-water black\nor a bushman smell one.  He could tell when a crocodile, hauled up from\nthe lagoon, lay without sound or movement, and perhaps asleep, a hundred\nfeet away on the floor mat of jungle.\n\nHe knew more of the language of crocodiles than did any man.  He had\nbetter means and opportunities of knowing.  He knew their many noises\nthat were as grunts and slubbers.  He knew their anger noises, their fear\nnoises, their food noises, their love noises.  And these noises were as\ndefinitely words in his vocabulary as are words in a human's vocabulary.\nAnd these crocodile noises were tools of thought.  By them he weighed and\njudged and determined his own consequent courses of action, just like any\nhuman; or, just like any human, lazily resolved upon no course of action,\nbut merely noted and registered a clear comprehension of something that\nwas going on about him that did not require a correspondence of action on\nhis part.\n\nAnd yet, what Jerry did not know was very much.  He did not know the size\nof the world.  He did not know that this Meringe Lagoon, backed by high,\nforested mountains and fronted and sheltered by the off-shore coral\nislets, was anything else than the entire world.  He did not know that it\nwas a mere fractional part of the great island of Ysabel, that was again\none island of a thousand, many of them greater, that composed the Solomon\nIslands that men marked on charts as a group of specks in the vastitude\nof the far-western South Pacific.\n\nIt was true, there was a somewhere else or a something beyond of which he\nwas dimly aware.  But whatever it was, it was mystery.  Out of it, things\nthat had not been, suddenly were.  Chickens and puarkas and cats, that he\nhad never seen before, had a way of abruptly appearing on Meringe\nPlantation.  Once, even, had there been an eruption of strange\nfour-legged, horned and hairy creatures, the images of which, registered\nin his brain, would have been identifiable in the brains of humans with\nwhat humans worded \"goats.\"\n\nIt was the same way with the blacks.  Out of the unknown, from the\nsomewhere and something else, too unconditional for him to know any of\nthe conditions, instantly they appeared, full-statured, walking about\nMeringe Plantation with loin-cloths about their middles and bone bodkins\nthrough their noses, and being put to work by _Mister_ Haggin, Derby, and\nBob.  That their appearance was coincidental with the arrival of the\n_Arangi_ was an association that occurred as a matter of course in\nJerry's brain.  Further, he did not bother, save that there was a\ncompanion association, namely, that their occasional disappearances into\nthe beyond was likewise coincidental with the _Arangi's_ departure.\n\nJerry did not query these appearances and disappearances.  It never\nentered his golden-sorrel head to be curious about the affair or to\nattempt to solve it.  He accepted it in much the way he accepted the\nwetness of water and the heat of the sun.  It was the way of life and of\nthe world he knew.  His hazy awareness was no more than an awareness of\nsomething--which, by the way, corresponds very fairly with the hazy\nawareness of the average human of the mysteries of birth and death and of\nthe beyondness about which they have no definiteness of comprehension.\n\nFor all that any man may gainsay, the ketch _Arangi_, trader and\nblackbirder in the Solomon Islands, may have signified in Jerry's mind as\nmuch the mysterious boat that traffics between the two worlds, as, at one\ntime, the boat that Charon sculled across the Styx signified to the human\nmind.  Out of the nothingness men came.  Into the nothingness they went.\nAnd they came and went always on the _Arangi_.\n\nAnd to the _Arangi_, this hot-white tropic morning, Jerry went on the\nwhaleboat under the arm of his _Mister_ Haggin, while on the beach Biddy\nmoaned her woe, and Michael, not sophisticated, barked the eternal\nchallenge of youth to the Unknown.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nFrom the whaleboat, up the low side of the _Arangi_, and over her six-\ninch rail of teak to her teak deck, was but a step, and Tom Haggin made\nit easily with Jerry still under his arm.  The deck was cluttered with an\nexciting crowd.  Exciting the crowd would have been to untravelled humans\nof civilization, and exciting it was to Jerry; although to Tom Haggin and\nCaptain Van Horn it was a mere commonplace of everyday life.\n\nThe deck was small because the _Arangi_ was small.  Originally a teak-\nbuilt, gentleman's yacht, brass-fitted, copper-fastened, angle-ironed,\nsheathed in man-of-war copper and with a fin-keel of bronze, she had been\nsold into the Solomon Islands' trade for the purpose of blackbirding or\nnigger-running.  Under the law, however, this traffic was dignified by\nbeing called \"recruiting.\"\n\nThe _Arangi_ was a labour-recruit ship that carried the new-caught,\ncannibal blacks from remote islands to labour on the new plantations\nwhere white men turned dank and pestilential swamp and jungle into rich\nand stately cocoanut groves.  The _Arangi's_ two masts were of Oregon\ncedar, so scraped and hot-paraffined that they shone like tan opals in\nthe glare of sun.  Her excessive sail plan enabled her to sail like a\nwitch, and, on occasion, gave Captain Van Horn, his white mate, and his\nfifteen black boat's crew as much as they could handle.  She was sixty\nfeet over all, and the cross beams of her crown deck had not been\nweakened by deck-houses.  The only breaks--and no beams had been cut for\nthem--were the main cabin skylight and companionway, the booby hatch\nfor'ard over the tiny forecastle, and the small hatch aft that let down\ninto the store-room.\n\nAnd on this small deck, in addition to the crew, were the \"return\"\nniggers from three far-flung plantations.  By \"return\" was meant that\ntheir three years of contract labour was up, and that, according to\ncontract, they were being returned to their home villages on the wild\nisland of Malaita.  Twenty of them--familiar, all, to Jerry--were from\nMeringe; thirty of them came from the Bay of a Thousand Ships, in the\nRussell Isles; and the remaining twelve were from Pennduffryn on the east\ncoast of Guadalcanar.  In addition to these--and they were all on deck,\nchattering and piping in queer, almost elfish, falsetto voices--were the\ntwo white men, Captain Van Horn and his Danish mate, Borckman, making a\ntotal of seventy-nine souls.\n\n\"Thought your heart 'd failed you at the last moment,\" was Captain Van\nHorn's greeting, a quick pleasure light glowing into his eyes as they\nnoted Jerry.\n\n\"It was sure near to doin' it,\" Tom Haggin answered.  \"It's only for you\nI'd a done it, annyways.  Jerry's the best of the litter, barrin'\nMichael, of course, the two of them bein' all that's left and no better\nthan them that was lost.  Now that Kathleen was a sweet dog, the spit of\nBiddy if she'd lived.--Here, take 'm.\"\n\nWith a jerk of abruptness, he deposited Jerry in Van Horn's arms and\nturned away along the deck.\n\n\"An' if bad luck comes to him I'll never forgive you, Skipper,\" he flung\nroughly over his shoulder.\n\n\"They'll have to take my head first,\" the skipper chuckled.\n\n\"An' not unlikely, my brave laddy buck,\" Haggin growled.  \"Meringe owes\nSomo four heads, three from the dysentery, an' another wan from a tree\nfallin' on him the last fortnight.  He was the son of a chief at that.\"\n\n\"Yes, and there's two heads more that the _Arangi_ owes Somo,\" Van Horn\nnodded.  \"You recollect, down to the south'ard last year, a chap named\nHawkins was lost in his whaleboat running the Arli Passage?\"  Haggin,\nreturning along the deck, nodded.  \"Two of his boat's crew were Somo\nboys.  I'd recruited them for Ugi Plantation.  With your boys, that makes\nsix heads the _Arangi_ owes.  But what of it?  There's one salt-water\nvillage, acrost on the weather coast, where the _Arangi_ owes eighteen.  I\nrecruited them for Aolo, and being salt-water men they put them on the\n_Sandfly_ that was lost on the way to the Santa Cruz.  They've got a jack-\npot over there on the weather coast--my word, the boy that could get my\nhead would be a second Carnegie!  A hundred and fifty pigs and shell\nmoney no end the village's collected for the chap that gets me and\ndelivers.\"\n\n\"And they ain't--yet,\" Haggin snorted.\n\n\"No fear,\" was the cheerful retort.\n\n\"You talk like Arbuckle used to talk,\" Haggin censured.  \"Manny's the\ntime I've heard him string it off.  Poor old Arbuckle.  The most sure and\nmost precautious chap that ever handled niggers.  He never went to sleep\nwithout spreadin' a box of tacks on the floor, and when it wasn't them it\nwas crumpled newspapers.  I remember me well, bein' under the same roof\nat the time on Florida, when a big tomcat chased a cockroach into the\npapers.  And it was blim, blam, blim, six times an' twice over, with his\ntwo big horse-pistols, an' the house perforated like a cullender.\nLikewise there was a dead tom-cat.  He could shoot in the dark with never\nan aim, pullin' trigger with the second finger and pointing with the\nfirst finger laid straight along the barrel.\n\n\"No, sir, my laddy buck.  He was the bully boy with the glass eye.  The\nnigger didn't live that'd lift his head.  But they got 'm.  They got 'm.\nHe lasted fourteen years, too.  It was his cook-boy.  Hatcheted 'm before\nbreakfast.  An' it's well I remember our second trip into the bush after\nwhat was left of 'm.\"\n\n\"I saw his head after you'd turned it over to the Commissioner at\nTulagi,\" Van Horn supplemented.\n\n\"An' the peaceful, quiet, everyday face of him on it, with almost the\nsame old smile I'd seen a thousand times.  It dried on 'm that way over\nthe smokin' fire.  But they got 'm, if it did take fourteen years.\nThere's manny's the head that goes to Malaita, manny's the time untooken;\nbut, like the old pitcher, it's tooken in the end.\"\n\n\"But I've got their goat,\" the captain insisted.  \"When trouble's\nhatching, I go straight to them and tell them what.  They can't get the\nhang of it.  Think I've got some powerful devil-devil medicine.\"\n\nTom Haggin thrust out his hand in abrupt good-bye, resolutely keeping his\neyes from dropping to Jerry in the other's arms.\n\n\"Keep your eye on my return boys,\" he cautioned, as he went over the\nside, \"till you land the last mother's son of 'm.  They've got no cause\nto love Jerry or his breed, an' I'd hate ill to happen 'm at a nigger's\nhands.  An' in the dark of the night 'tis like as not he can do a fare-\nyou-well overside.  Don't take your eye off 'm till you're quit of the\nlast of 'm.\"\n\nAt sight of big _Mister_ Haggin deserting him and being pulled away in\nthe whaleboat, Jerry wriggled and voiced his anxiety in a low, whimpering\nwhine.  Captain Van Horn snuggled him closer in his arm with a caress of\nhis free hand.\n\n\"Don't forget the agreement,\" Tom Haggin called back across the widening\nwater.  \"If aught happens you, Jerry's to come back to me.\"\n\n\"I'll make a paper to that same and put it with the ship's articles,\" was\nVan Horn's reply.\n\nAmong the many words possessed by Jerry was his own name; and in the talk\nof the two men he had recognised it repeatedly, and he was aware,\nvaguely, that the talk was related to the vague and unguessably terrible\nthing that was happening to him.  He wriggled more determinedly, and Van\nHorn set him down on the deck.  He sprang to the rail with more quickness\nthan was to be expected of an awkward puppy of six months, and not the\nquick attempt of Van Horn to cheek him would have succeeded.  But Jerry\nrecoiled from the open water lapping the _Arangi's_ side.  The taboo was\nupon him.  It was the image of the log awash that was not a log but that\nwas alive, luminous in his brain, that checked him.  It was not reason on\nhis part, but inhibition which had become habit.\n\nHe plumped down on his bob tail, lifted golden muzzle skyward, and\nemitted a long puppy-wail of dismay and grief.\n\n\"It's all right, Jerry, old man, brace up and be a man-dog,\" Van Horn\nsoothed him.\n\nBut Jerry was not to be reconciled.  While this indubitably was a white-\nskinned god, it was not his god.  _Mister_ Haggin was his god, and a\nsuperior god at that.  Even he, without thinking about it at all,\nrecognized that.  His _Mister_ Haggin wore pants and shoes.  This god on\nthe deck beside him was more like a black.  Not only did he not wear\npants, and was barefooted and barelegged, but about his middle, just like\nany black, he wore a brilliant-coloured loin-cloth, that, like a kilt,\nfell nearly to his sunburnt knees.\n\nCaptain Van Horn was a handsome man and a striking man, although Jerry\ndid not know it.  If ever a Holland Dutchman stepped out of a Rembrandt\nframe, Captain Van Horn was that one, despite the fact that he was New\nYork born, as had been his knickerbocker ancestors before him clear back\nto the time when New York was not New York but New Amsterdam.  To\ncomplete his costume, a floppy felt hat, distinctly Rembrandtish in\neffect, perched half on his head and mostly over one ear; a sixpenny,\nwhite cotton undershirt covered his torso; and from a belt about his\nmiddle dangled a tobacco pouch, a sheath-knife, filled clips of\ncartridges, and a huge automatic pistol in a leather holster.\n\nOn the beach, Biddy, who had hushed her grief, lifted it again when she\nheard Jerry's wail.  And Jerry, desisting a moment to listen, heard\nMichael beside her, barking his challenge, and saw, without being\nconscious of it, Michael's withered ear with its persistent upward cock.\nAgain, while Captain Van Horn and the mate, Borckman, gave orders, and\nwhile the _Arangi's_ mainsail and spanker began to rise up the masts,\nJerry loosed all his heart of woe in what Bob told Derby on the beach was\nthe \"grandest vocal effort\" he had ever heard from any dog, and that,\nexcept for being a bit thin, Caruso didn't have anything on Jerry.  But\nthe song was too much for Haggin, who, as soon as he had landed, whistled\nBiddy to him and strode rapidly away from the beach.\n\nAt sight of her disappearing, Jerry was guilty of even more Caruso-like\neffects, which gave great joy to a Pennduffryn return boy who stood\nbeside him.  He laughed and jeered at Jerry with falsetto chucklings that\nwere more like the jungle-noises of tree-dwelling creatures, half-bird\nand half-man, than of a man, all man, and therefore a god.  This served\nas an excellent counter-irritant.  Indignation that a mere black should\nlaugh at him mastered Jerry, and the next moment his puppy teeth, sharp-\npointed as needles, had scored the astonished black's naked calf in long\nparallel scratches from each of which leaped the instant blood.  The\nblack sprang away in trepidation, but the blood of Terrence the\nMagnificent was true in Jerry, and, like his father before him, he\nfollowed up, slashing the black's other calf into a ruddy pattern.\n\nAt this moment, anchor broken out and headsails running up, Captain Van\nHorn, whose quick eye had missed no detail of the incident, with an order\nto the black helmsman turned to applaud Jerry.\n\n\"Go to it, Jerry!\" he encouraged.  \"Get him!  Shake him down!  Sick him!\nGet him!  Get him!\"\n\nThe black, in defence, aimed a kick at Jerry, who, leaping in instead of\naway--another inheritance from Terrence--avoided the bare foot and\nprinted a further red series of parallel lines on the dark leg.  This was\ntoo much, and the black, afraid more of Van Horn than of Jerry, turned\nand fled for'ard, leaping to safety on top of the eight Lee-Enfield\nrifles that lay on top of the cabin skylight and that were guarded by one\nmember of the boat's crew.  About the skylight Jerry stormed, leaping up\nand falling back, until Captain Van Horn called him off.\n\n\"Some nigger-chaser, that pup, _some_ nigger-chaser!\" Van Horn confided\nto Borckman, as he bent to pat Jerry and give him due reward of praise.\n\nAnd Jerry, under this caressing hand of a god, albeit it did not wear\npants, forgot for a moment longer the fate that was upon him.\n\n\"He's a lion-dog--more like an Airedale than an Irish terrier,\" Van Horn\nwent on to his mate, still petting.  \"Look at the size of him already.\nLook at the bone of him.  Some chest that.  He's got the endurance.  And\nhe'll be some dog when he grows up to those feet of his.\"\n\nJerry had just remembered his grief and was starting a rush across the\ndeck to the rail to gaze at Meringe growing smaller every second in the\ndistance, when a gust of the South-east Trade smote the sails and pressed\nthe _Arangi_ down.  And down the deck, slanted for the moment to forty-\nfive degrees, Jerry slipped and slid, vainly clawing at the smooth\nsurface for a hold.  He fetched up against the foot of the mizzenmast,\nwhile Captain Van Horn, with the sailor's eye for the coral patch under\nhis bow, gave the order \"Hard a-lee!\"\n\nBorckman and the black steersman echoed his words, and, as the wheel spun\ndown, the _Arangi_, with the swiftness of a witch, rounded into the wind\nand attained a momentary even keel to the flapping of her headsails and a\nshifting of headsheets.\n\nJerry, still intent on Meringe, took advantage of the level footing to\nrecover himself and scramble toward the rail.  But he was deflected by\nthe crash of the mainsheet blocks on the stout deck-traveller, as the\nmainsail, emptied of the wind and feeling the wind on the other side,\nswung crazily across above him.  He cleared the danger of the mainsheet\nwith a wild leap (although no less wild had been Van Horn's leap to\nrescue him), and found himself directly under the mainboom with the huge\nsail looming above him as if about to fall upon him and crush him.\n\nIt was Jerry's first experience with sails of any sort.  He did not know\nthe beasts, much less the way of them, but, in his vivid recollection,\nwhen he had been a tiny puppy, burned the memory of the hawk, in the\nmiddle of the compound, that had dropped down upon him from out of the\nsky.  Under that colossal threatened impact he crouched down to the deck.\nAbove him, falling upon him like a bolt from the blue, was a winged hawk\nunthinkably vaster than the one he had encountered.  But in his crouch\nwas no hint of cower.  His crouch was a gathering together, an assembling\nof all the parts of him under the rule of the spirit of him, for the\nspring upward to meet in mid career this monstrous, menacing thing.\n\nBut, the succeeding fraction of a moment, so that Jerry, leaping, missed\neven the shadow of it, the mainsail, with a second crash of blocks on\ntraveller, had swung across and filled on the other tack.\n\nVan Horn had missed nothing of it.  Before, in his time, he had seen\nyoung dogs frightened into genuine fits by their first encounters with\nheaven-filling, sky-obscuring, down-impending sails.  This was the first\ndog he had seen leap with bared teeth, undismayed, to grapple with the\nhuge unknown.\n\nWith spontaneity of admiration, Van Horn swept Jerry from the deck and\ngathered him into his arms.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nJerry quite forgot Meringe for the time being.  As he well remembered,\nthe hawk had been sharp of beak and claw.  This air-flapping, thunder-\ncrashing monster needed watching.  And Jerry, crouching for the spring\nand ever struggling to maintain his footing on the slippery, heeling\ndeck, kept his eyes on the mainsail and uttered low growls at any display\nof movement on its part.\n\nThe _Arangi_ was beating out between the coral patches of the narrow\nchannel into the teeth of the brisk trade wind.  This necessitated\nfrequent tacks, so that, overhead, the mainsail was ever swooping across\nfrom port tack to starboard tack and back again, making air-noises like\nthe swish of wings, sharply rat-tat-tatting its reef points and loudly\ncrashing its mainsheet gear along the traveller.  Half a dozen times, as\nit swooped overhead, Jerry leaped for it, mouth open to grip, lips\nwrithed clear of the clean puppy teeth that shone in the sun like gems of\nivory.\n\nFailing in every leap, Jerry achieved a judgment.  In passing, it must be\nnoted that this judgment was only arrived at by a definite act of\nreasoning.  Out of a series of observations of the thing, in which it had\nthreatened, always in the same way, a series of attacks, he had found\nthat it had not hurt him nor come in contact with him at all.\nTherefore--although he did not stop to think that he was thinking--it was\nnot the dangerous, destroying thing he had first deemed it.  It might be\nwell to be wary of it, though already it had taken its place in his\nclassification of things that appeared terrible but were not terrible.\nThus, he had learned not to fear the roar of the wind among the palms\nwhen he lay snug on the plantation-house veranda, nor the onslaught of\nthe waves, hissing and rumbling into harmless foam on the beach at his\nfeet.\n\nMany times, in the course of the day, alertly and nonchalantly, almost\nwith a quizzical knowingness, Jerry cocked his head at the mainsail when\nit made sudden swooping movements or slacked and tautened its crashing\nsheet-gear.  But he no longer crouched to spring for it.  That had been\nthe first lesson, and quickly mastered.\n\nHaving settled the mainsail, Jerry returned in mind to Meringe.  But\nthere was no Meringe, no Biddy and Terrence and Michael on the beach; no\n_Mister_ Haggin and Derby and Bob; no beach: no land with the palm-trees\nnear and the mountains afar off everlastingly lifting their green peaks\ninto the sky.  Always, to starboard or to port, at the bow or over the\nstern, when he stood up resting his fore-feet on the six-inch rail and\ngazing, he saw only the ocean, broken-faced and turbulent, yet orderly\nmarching its white-crested seas before the drive of the trade.\n\nHad he had the eyes of a man, nearly two yards higher than his own from\nthe deck, and had they been the trained eyes of a man, sailor-man at\nthat, Jerry could have seen the low blur of Ysabel to the north and the\nblur of Florida to the south, ever taking on definiteness of detail as\nthe _Arangi_ sagged close-hauled, with a good full, port-tacked to the\nsouth-east trade.  And had he had the advantage of the marine glasses\nwith which Captain Van Horn elongated the range of his eyes, he could\nhave seen, to the east, the far peaks of Malaita lifting life-shadowed\npink cloud-puffs above the sea-rim.\n\nBut the present was very immediate with Jerry.  He had early learned the\niron law of the immediate, and to accept what _was_ when it was, rather\nthan to strain after far other things.  The sea was.  The land no longer\nwas.  The _Arangi_ certainly was, along with the life that cluttered her\ndeck.  And he proceeded to get acquainted with what was--in short, to\nknow and to adjust himself to his new environment.\n\nHis first discovery was delightful--a wild-dog puppy from the Ysabel\nbush, being taken back to Malaita by one of the Meringe return boys.  In\nage they were the same, but their breeding was different.  The wild-dog\nwas what he was, a wild-dog, cringing and sneaking, his ears for ever\ndown, his tail for ever between his legs, for ever apprehending fresh\nmisfortune and ill-treatment to fall on him, for ever fearing and\nresentful, fending off threatened hurt with lips curling malignantly from\nhis puppy fangs, cringing under a blow, squalling his fear and his pain,\nand ready always for a treacherous slash if luck and safety favoured.\n\nThe wild-dog was maturer than Jerry, larger-bodied, and wiser in\nwickedness; but Jerry was blue-blooded, right-selected, and valiant.  The\nwild-dog had come out of a selection equally rigid; but it was a\ndifferent sort of selection.  The bush ancestors from whom he had\ndescended had survived by being fear-selected.  They had never\nvoluntarily fought against odds.  In the open they had never attacked\nsave when the prey was weak or defenceless.  In place of courage, they\nhad lived by creeping, and slinking, and hiding from danger.  They had\nbeen selected blindly by nature, in a cruel and ignoble environment,\nwhere the prize of living was to be gained, in the main, by the cunning\nof cowardice, and, on occasion, by desperateness of defence when in a\ncorner.\n\nBut Jerry had been love-selected and courage-selected.  His ancestors had\nbeen deliberately and consciously chosen by men, who, somewhere in the\nforgotten past, had taken the wild-dog and made it into the thing they\nvisioned and admired and desired it to be.  It must never fight like a\nrat in a corner, because it must never be rat-like and slink into a\ncorner.  Retreat must be unthinkable.  The dogs in the past who retreated\nhad been rejected by men.  They had not become Jerry's ancestors.  The\ndogs selected for Jerry's ancestors had been the brave ones, the\nup-standing and out-dashing ones, who flew into the face of danger and\nbattled and died, but who never gave ground.  And, since it is the way of\nkind to beget kind, Jerry was what Terrence was before him, and what\nTerrence's forefathers had been for a long way back.\n\nSo it was that Jerry, when he chanced upon the wild-dog stowed shrewdly\naway from the wind in the lee-corner made by the mainmast and the cabin\nskylight, did not stop to consider whether the creature was bigger or\nfiercer than he.  All he knew was that it was the ancient enemy--the wild-\ndog that had not come in to the fires of man.  With a wild paean of joy\nthat attracted Captain Van Horn's all-hearing ears and all-seeing eyes,\nJerry sprang to the attack.  The wild puppy gained his feet in full\nretreat with incredible swiftness, but was caught by the rush of Jerry's\nbody and rolled over and over on the sloping deck.  And as he rolled, and\nfelt sharp teeth pricking him, he snapped and snarled, alternating snarls\nwith whimperings and squallings of terror, pain, and abject humility.\n\nAnd Jerry was a gentleman, which is to say he was a gentle dog.  He had\nbeen so selected.  Because the thing did not fight back, because it was\nabject and whining, because it was helpless under him, he abandoned the\nattack, disengaging himself from the top of the tangle into which he had\nslid in the lee scuppers.  He did not think about it.  He did it because\nhe was so made.  He stood up on the reeling deck, feeling excellently\nsatisfied with the delicious, wild-doggy smell of hair in his mouth and\nconsciousness, and in his ears and consciousness the praising cry of\nCaptain Van Horn: \"Good boy, Jerry!  You're the goods, Jerry!  Some dog,\neh!  _Some_ dog!\"\n\nAs he stalked away, it must be admitted that Jerry displayed pride in\nhimself, his gait being a trifle stiff-legged, the cocking of his head\nback over his shoulder at the whining wild-dog having all the\narticulateness of: \"Well, I guess I gave you enough this time.  You'll\nkeep out of my way after this.\"\n\nJerry continued the exploration of his new and tiny world that was never\nat rest, for ever lifting, heeling, and lunging on the rolling face of\nthe sea.  There were the Meringe return boys.  He made it a point to\nidentify all of them, receiving, while he did so, scowls and mutterings,\nand reciprocating with cocky bullyings and threatenings.  Being so\ntrained, he walked on his four legs superior to them, two-legged though\nthey were; for he had moved and lived always under the aegis of the great\ntwo-legged and be-trousered god, _Mister_ Haggin.\n\nThen there were the strange return boys, from Pennduffryn and the Bay of\na Thousand Ships.  He insisted on knowing them all.  He might need to\nknow them in some future time.  He did not think this.  He merely\nequipped himself with knowledge of his environment without any awareness\nof provision or without bothering about the future.\n\nIn his own way of acquiring knowledge, he quickly discovered, just as on\nthe plantation house-boys were different from field-boys, that on the\n_Arangi_ there was a classification of boys different from the return\nboys.  This was the boat's crew.  The fifteen blacks who composed it were\ncloser than the others to Captain Van Horn.  They seemed more directly to\nbelong to the _Arangi_ and to him.  They laboured under him at word of\ncommand, steering at the wheel, pulling and hauling on ropes, healing\nwater upon the deck from overside and scrubbing with brooms.\n\nJust as Jerry had learned from _Mister_ Haggin that he must be more\ntolerant of the house-boys than of the field-boys if they trespassed on\nthe compound, so, from Captain Van Horn, he learned that he must be more\ntolerant of the boat's crew than of the return boys.  He had less license\nwith them, more license with the others.  As long as Captain Van Horn did\nnot want his boat's crew chased, it was Jerry's duty not to chase.  On\nthe other hand he never forgot that he was a white-god's dog.  While he\nmight not chase these particular blacks, he declined familiarity with\nthem.  He kept his eye on them.  He had seen blacks as tolerated as\nthese, lined up and whipped by _Mister_ Haggin.  They occupied an\nintermediate place in the scheme of things, and they were to be watched\nin case they did not keep their place.  He accorded them room, but he did\nnot accord them equality.  At the best, he could be stand-offishly\nconsiderate of them.\n\nHe made thorough examination of the galley, a rude affair, open on the\nopen deck, exposed to wind and rain and storm, a small stove that was not\neven a ship's stove, on which somehow, aided by strings and wedges,\ncommingled with much smoke, two blacks managed to cook the food for the\nfour-score persons on board.\n\nNext, he was interested by a strange proceeding on the part of the boat's\ncrew.  Upright pipes, serving as stanchions, were being screwed into the\ntop of the _Arangi's_ rail so that they served to support three strands\nof barbed wire that ran completely around the vessel, being broken only\nat the gangway for a narrow space of fifteen inches.  That this was a\nprecaution against danger, Jerry sensed without a passing thought to it.\nAll his life, from his first impressions of life, had been passed in the\nheart of danger, ever-impending, from the blacks.  In the plantation\nhouse at Meringe, always the several white men had looked askance at the\nmany blacks who toiled for them and belonged to them.  In the\nliving-room, where were the eating-table, the billiard-table, and the\nphonograph, stood stands of rifles, and in each bedroom, beside each bed,\nready to hand, had been revolvers and rifles.  As well, _Mister_ Haggin\nand Derby and Bob had always carried revolvers in their belts when they\nleft the house to go among their blacks.\n\nJerry knew these noise-making things for what they were--instruments of\ndestruction and death.  He had seen live things destroyed by them, such\nas puarkas, goats, birds, and crocodiles.  By means of such things the\nwhite-gods by their will crossed space without crossing it with their\nbodies, and destroyed live things.  Now he, in order to damage anything,\nhad to cross space with his body to get to it.  He was different.  He was\nlimited.  All impossible things were possible to the unlimited,\ntwo-legged white-gods.  In a way, this ability of theirs to destroy\nacross space was an elongation of claw and fang.  Without pondering it,\nor being conscious of it, he accepted it as he accepted the rest of the\nmysterious world about him.\n\nOnce, even, had Jerry seen his _Mister_ Haggin deal death at a distance\nin another noise-way.  From the veranda he had seen him fling sticks of\nexploding dynamite into a screeching mass of blacks who had come raiding\nfrom the Beyond in the long war canoes, beaked and black, carved and\ninlaid with mother-of-pearl, which they had left hauled up on the beach\nat the door of Meringe.\n\nMany precautions by the white-gods had Jerry been aware of, and so,\nsensing it almost in intangible ways, as a matter of course he accepted\nthis barbed-wire fence on the floating world as a mark of the persistence\nof danger.  Disaster and death hovered close about, waiting the chance to\nleap upon life and drag it down.  Life had to be very alive in order to\nlive was the law Jerry had learned from the little of life he knew.\n\nWatching the rigging up of the barbed wire, Jerry's next adventure was an\nencounter with Lerumie, the return boy from Meringe, who, only that\nmorning, on the beach embarking, had been rolled by Biddy, along with his\npossessions into the surf.  The encounter occurred on the starboard side\nof the skylight, alongside of which Lerumie was standing as he gazed into\na cheap trade-mirror and combed his kinky hair with a hand-carved comb of\nwood.\n\nJerry, scarcely aware of Lerumie's presence, was trotting past on his way\naft to where Borckman, the mate, was superintending the stringing of the\nbarbed wire to the stanchions.  And Lerumie, with a side-long look to see\nif the deed meditated for his foot was screened from observation, aimed a\nkick at the son of his four-legged enemy.  His bare foot caught Jerry on\nthe sensitive end of his recently bobbed tail, and Jerry, outraged, with\nthe sense of sacrilege committed upon him, went instantly wild.\n\nCaptain Van Horn, standing aft on the port quarter, gauging the slant of\nthe wind on the sails and the inadequate steering of the black at the\nwheel, had not seen Jerry because of the intervening skylight.  But his\neyes had taken in the shoulder movement of Lerumie that advertised the\nbalancing on one foot while the other foot had kicked.  And from what\nfollowed, he divined what had already occurred.\n\nJerry's outcry, as he sprawled, whirled, sprang, and slashed, was a\nveritable puppy-scream of indignation.  He slashed ankle and foot as he\nreceived the second kick in mid-air; and, although he slid clear down the\nslope of deck into the scuppers, he left on the black skin the red\ntracery of his puppy-needle teeth.  Still screaming his indignation, he\nclawed his way back up the steep wooden hill.\n\nLerumie, with another side-long look, knew that he was observed and that\nhe dare not go to extremes.  He fled along the skylight to escape down\nthe companionway, but was caught by Jerry's sharp teeth in his calf.\nJerry, attacking blindly, got in the way of the black's feet.  A long,\nstumbling fall, accelerated by a sudden increase of wind in the sails,\nensued, and Lerumie, vainly trying to catch his footing, fetched up\nagainst the three strands of barbed wire on the lee rail.\n\nThe deck-full of blacks shrieked their merriment, and Jerry, his rage\nundiminished, his immediate antagonist out of the battle, mistaking\nhimself as the object of the laughter of the blacks, turned upon them,\ncharging and slashing the many legs that fled before him.  They dropped\ndown the cabin and forecastle companionways, ran out the bowsprit, and\nsprang into the rigging till they were perched everywhere in the air like\nmonstrous birds.  In the end, the deck belonged to Jerry, save for the\nboat's crew; for he had already learned to differentiate.  Captain Van\nHorn was hilariously vocal of his praise, calling Jerry to him and giving\nhim man-thumps of joyful admiration.  Next, the captain turned to his\nmany passengers and orated in _beche_-_de_-_mer_ English.\n\n\"Hey!  You fella boy!  I make 'm big fella talk.  This fella dog he\nbelong along me.  One fella boy hurt 'm that fella dog--my word!--me\ncross too much along that fella boy.  I knock 'm seven bells outa that\nfella boy.  You take 'm care leg belong you.  I take 'm care dog belong\nme.  Savve?\"\n\nAnd the passengers, still perched in the air, with gleaming black eyes\nand with querulerus chirpings one to another, accepted the white man's\nlaw.  Even Lerumie, variously lacerated by the barbed wire, did not scowl\nnor mutter threats.  Instead, and bringing a roar of laughter from his\nfellows and a twinkle into the skipper's eyes, he rubbed questing fingers\nover his scratches and murmured: \"My word!  Some big fella dog that\nfella!\"\n\nIt was not that Jerry was unkindly.  Like Biddy and Terrence, he was\nfierce and unafraid; which attributes were wrapped up in his heredity.\nAnd, like Biddy and Terrence, he delighted in nigger-chasing, which, in\nturn, was a matter of training.  From his earliest puppyhood he had been\nso trained.  Niggers were niggers, but white men were gods, and it was\nthe white-gods who had trained him to chase niggers and keep them in\ntheir proper lesser place in the world.  All the world was held in the\nhollow of the white man's hands.  The niggers--well, had not he seen them\nalways compelled to remain in their lesser place?  Had he not seen them,\non occasion, triced up to the palm-trees of the Meringe compound and\ntheir backs lashed to ribbons by the white-gods?  Small wonder that a\nhigh-born Irish terrier, in the arms of love of the white-god, should\nlook at niggers through white-god's eyes, and act toward niggers in the\nway that earned the white-god's reward of praise.\n\nIt was a busy day for Jerry.  Everything about the _Arangi_ was new and\nstrange, and so crowded was she that exciting things were continually\nhappening.  He had another encounter with the wild-dog, who treacherously\nattacked him in flank from ambuscade.  Trade boxes belonging to the\nblacks had been irregularly piled so that a small space was left between\ntwo boxes in the lower tier.  From this hole, as Jerry trotted past in\nresponse to a call from the skipper, the wild-dog sprang, scratched his\nsharp puppy-teeth into Jerry's yellow-velvet hide, and scuttled back into\nhis lair.\n\nAgain Jerry's feelings were outraged.  He could understand flank attack.\nOften he and Michael had played at that, although it had only been\nplaying.  But to retreat without fighting from a fight once started was\nalien to Jerry's ways and nature.  With righteous wrath he charged into\nthe hole after his enemy.  But this was where the wild-dog fought to best\nadvantage--in a corner.  When Jerry sprang up in the confined space he\nbumped his head on the box above, and the next moment felt the snarling\nimpact of the other's teeth against his own teeth and jaw.\n\nThere was no getting at the wild-dog, no chance to rush against him whole\nheartedly, with generous full weight in the attack.  All Jerry could do\nwas to crawl and squirm and belly forward, and always he was met by a\nsnarling mouthful of teeth.  Even so, he would have got the wild-dog in\nthe end, had not Borckman, in passing, reached in and dragged Jerry out\nby a hind-leg.  Again came Captain Van Horn's call, and Jerry, obedient,\ntrotted on aft.\n\nA meal was being served on deck in the shade of the spanker, and Jerry,\nsitting between the two men received his share.  Already he had made the\ngeneralization that of the two, the captain was the superior god, giving\nmany orders that the mate obeyed.  The mate, on the other hand, gave\norders to the blacks, but never did he give orders to the captain.\nFurthermore, Jerry was developing a liking for the captain, so he\nsnuggled close to him.  When he put his nose into the captain's plate, he\nwas gently reprimanded.  But once, when he merely sniffed at the mate's\nsteaming tea-cup, her received a snub on the nose from the mate's grimy\nforefinger.  Also, the mate did not offer him food.\n\nCaptain Van Horn gave him, first of all, a pannikin of oatmeal mush,\ngenerously flooded with condensed cream and sweetened with a heaping\nspoonful of sugar.  After that, on occasion, he gave him morsels of\nbuttered bread and slivers of fried fish from which he first carefully\npicked the tiny bones.\n\nHis beloved _Mister_ Haggin had never fed him from the table at meal\ntime, and Jerry was beside himself with the joy of this delightful\nexperience.  And, being young, he allowed his eagerness to take\npossession of him, so that soon he was unduly urging the captain for more\npieces of fish and of bread and butter.  Once, he even barked his demand.\nThis put the idea into the captain's head, who began immediately to teach\nhim to \"speak.\"\n\nAt the end of five minutes he had learned to speak softly, and to speak\nonly once--a low, mellow, bell-like bark of a single syllable.  Also, in\nthis first five minutes, he had learned to \"sit down,\" as distinctly\ndifferent from \"lie down\"; and that he must sit down whenever he spoke,\nand that he must speak without jumping or moving from the sitting\nposition, and then must wait until the piece of food was passed to him.\n\nFurther, he had added three words to his vocabulary.  For ever after,\n\"speak\" would mean to him \"speak,\" and \"sit down\" would mean \"sit down\"\nand would not mean \"lie down.\"  The third addition to his vocabulary was\n\"Skipper.\"  That was the name he had heard the mate repeatedly call\nCaptain Van Horn.  And just as Jerry knew that when a human called\n\"Michael,\" that the call referred to Michael and not to Biddy, or\nTerrence, or himself, so he knew that _Skipper_ was the name of the two-\nlegged white master of this new floating world.\n\n\"That isn't just a dog,\" was Van Horn's conclusion to the mate.  \"There's\na sure enough human brain there behind those brown eyes.  He's six months\nold.  Any boy of six years would be an infant phenomenon to learn in five\nminutes all that he's just learned.  Why, Gott-fer-dang, a dog's brain\nhas to be like a man's.  If he does things like a man, he's got to think\nlike a man.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nThe companionway into the main cabin was a steep ladder, and down this,\nafter his meal, Jerry was carried by the captain.  The cabin was a long\nroom, extending for the full width of the _Arangi_ from a lazarette aft\nto a tiny room for'ard.  For'ard of this room, separated by a tight\nbulkhead, was the forecastle where lived the boat's crew.  The tiny room\nwas shared between Van Horn and Borckman, while the main cabin was\noccupied by the three-score and odd return boys.  They squatted about and\nlay everywhere on the floor and on the long low bunks that ran the full\nlength of the cabin along either side.\n\nIn the little stateroom the captain tossed a blanket on the floor in a\ncorner, and he did not find it difficult to get Jerry to understand that\nthat was his bed.  Nor did Jerry, with a full stomach and weary from so\nmuch excitement, find it difficult to fall immediately asleep.\n\nAn hour later he was awakened by the entrance of Borckman.  When he\nwagged his stub of a tail and smiled friendly with his eyes, the mate\nscowled at him and muttered angrily in his throat.  Jerry made no further\novertures, but lay quietly watching.  The mate had come to take a drink.\nIn truth, he was stealing the drink from Van Horn's supply.  Jerry did\nnot know this.  Often, on the plantation, he had seen the white men take\ndrinks.  But there was something somehow different in the manner of\nBorckman's taking a drink.  Jerry was aware, vaguely, that there was\nsomething surreptitious about it.  What was wrong he did not know, yet he\nsensed the wrongness and watched suspiciously.\n\nAfter the mate departed, Jerry would have slept again had not the\ncarelessly latched door swung open with a bang.  Opening his eyes,\nprepared for any hostile invasion from the unknown, he fell to watching a\nlarge cockroach crawling down the wall.  When he got to his feet and\nwarily stalked toward it, the cockroach scuttled away with a slight\nrustling noise and disappeared into a crack.  Jerry had been acquainted\nwith cockroaches all his life, but he was destined to learn new things\nabout them from the particular breed that dwelt on the _Arangi_.\n\nAfter a cursory examination of the stateroom he wandered out into the\ncabin.  The blacks, sprawled about everywhere, but, conceiving it to be\nhis duty to his _Skipper_, Jerry made it a point to identify each one.\nThey scowled and uttered low threatening noises when he sniffed close to\nthem.  One dared to menace him with a blow, but Jerry, instead of\nslinking away, showed his teeth and prepared to spring.  The black\nhastily dropped the offending hand to his side and made soothing,\npenitent noises, while others chuckled; and Jerry passed on his way.  It\nwas nothing new.  Always a blow was to be expected from blacks when white\nmen were not around.  Both the mate and the captain were on deck, and\nJerry, though unafraid, continued his investigations cautiously.\n\nBut at the doorless entrance to the lazarette aft, he threw caution to\nthe winds and darted in in pursuit of the new scent that came to his\nnostrils.  A strange person was in the low, dark space whom he had never\nsmelled.  Clad in a single shift and lying on a coarse grass-mat spread\nupon a pile of tobacco cases and fifty-pound tins of flour, was a young\nblack girl.\n\nThere was something furtive and lurking about her that Jerry did not fail\nto sense, and he had long since learned that something was wrong when any\nblack lurked or skulked.  She cried out with fear as he barked an alarm\nand pounced upon her.  Even though his teeth scratched her bare arm, she\ndid not strike at him.  Not did she cry out again.  She cowered down and\ntrembled and did not fight back.  Keeping his teeth locked in the hold he\nhad got on her flimsy shift, he shook and dragged at her, all the while\ngrowling and scolding for her benefit and yelping a high clamour to bring\nSkipper or the mate.\n\nIn the course of the struggle the girl over-balanced on the boxes and\ntins and the entire heap collapsed.  This caused Jerry to yelp a more\nfrenzied alarm, while the blacks, peering in from the cabin, laughed with\ncruel enjoyment.\n\nWhen Skipper arrived, Jerry wagged his stump tail and, with ears laid\nback, dragged and tugged harder than ever at the thin cotton of the\ngirl's garment.  He expected praise for what he had done, but when\nSkipper merely told him to let go, he obeyed with the realization that\nthis lurking, fear-struck creature was somehow different, and must be\ntreated differently, from other lurking creatures.\n\nFear-struck she was, as it is given to few humans to be and still live.\nVan Horn called her his parcel of trouble, and he was anxious to be rid\nof the parcel, without, however, the utter annihilation of the parcel.  It\nwas this annihilation which he had saved her from when he bought her in\neven exchange for a fat pig.\n\nStupid, worthless, spiritless, sick, not more than a dozen years old, no\ndelight in the eyes of the young men of her village, she had been\nconsigned by her disappointed parents to the cooking-pot.  When Captain\nVan Horn first encountered her had been when she was the central figure\nin a lugubrious procession on the banks of the Balebuli River.\n\nAnything but a beauty--had been his appraisal when he halted the\nprocession for a pow-wow.  Lean from sickness, her skin mangy with the\ndry scales of the disease called _bukua_, she was tied hand and foot and,\nlike a pig, slung from a stout pole that rested on the shoulders of the\nbearers, who intended to dine off of her.  Too hopeless to expect mercy,\nshe made no appeal for help, though the horrible fear that possessed her\nwas eloquent in her wild-staring eyes.\n\nIn the universal beche-de-mer English, Captain Van Horn had learned that\nshe was not regarded with relish by her companions, and that they were on\ntheir way to stake her out up to her neck in the running water of the\nBalebuli.  But first, before they staked her, their plan was to dislocate\nher joints and break the big bones of the arms and legs.  This was no\nreligious rite, no placation of the brutish jungle gods.  Merely was it a\nmatter of gastronomy.  Living meat, so treated, was made tender and\ntasty, and, as her companions pointed out, she certainly needed to be put\nthrough such a process.  Two days in the water, they told the captain,\nought to do the business.  Then they would kill her, build the fire, and\ninvite in a few friends.\n\nAfter half an hour of bargaining, during which Captain Van Horn had\ninsisted on the worthlessness of the parcel, he had bought a fat pig\nworth five dollars and exchanged it for her.  Thus, since he had paid for\nthe pig in trade goods, and since trade goods were rated at a hundred per\ncent. profit, the girl had actually cost him two dollars and fifty cents.\n\nAnd then Captain Van Horn's troubles had begun.  He could not get rid of\nthe girl.  Too well he knew the natives of Malaita to turn her over to\nthem anywhere on the island.  Chief Ishikola of Su'u had offered five\ntwenties of drinking coconuts for her, and Bau, a bush chief, had offered\ntwo chickens on the beach at Malu.  But this last offer had been\naccompanied by a sneer, and had tokened the old rascal's scorn of the\ngirl's scrawniness.  Failing to connect with the missionary brig, the\n_Western_ _Cross_, on which she would not have been eaten, Captain Van\nHorn had been compelled to keep her in the cramped quarters of the\n_Arangi_ against a problematical future time when he would be able to\nturn her over to the missionaries.\n\nBut toward him the girl had no heart of gratitude because she had no\nbrain of understanding.  She, who had been sold for a fat pig, considered\nher pitiful role in the world to be unchanged.  Eatee she had been.  Eatee\nshe remained.  Her destination merely had been changed, and this big\nfella white marster of the _Arangi_ would undoubtedly be her destination\nwhen she had sufficiently fattened.  His designs on her had been\ntransparent from the first, when he had tried to feed her up.  And she\nhad outwitted him by resolutely eating no more than would barely keep her\nalive.\n\nAs a result, she, who had lived in the bush all her days and never so\nmuch as set foot in a canoe, rocked and rolled unendingly over the broad\nocean in a perpetual nightmare of fear.  In the beche-de-mer that was\ncurrent among the blacks of a thousand islands and ten thousand dialects,\nthe _Arangi's_ procession of passengers assured her of her fate.  \"My\nword, you fella Mary,\" one would say to her, \"short time little bit that\nbig fella white marster kai-kai along you.\"  Or, another: \"Big fella\nwhite marster kai-kai along you, my word, belly belong him walk about too\nmuch.\"\n\nKai-kai was the beche-de-mer for \"eat.\"  Even Jerry knew that.  \"Eat\" did\nnot obtain in his vocabulary; but kai-kai did, and it meant all and more\nthan \"eat,\" for it served for both noun and verb.\n\nBut the girl never replied to the jeering of the blacks.  For that\nmatter, she never spoke at all, not even to Captain Van Horn, who did not\nso much as know her name.\n\nIt was late afternoon, after discovering the girl in the lazarette, when\nJerry again came on deck.  Scarcely had Skipper, who had carried him up\nthe steep ladder, dropped him on deck than Jerry made a new\ndiscovery--land.  He did not see it, but he smelled it.  His nose went up\nin the air and quested to windward along the wind that brought the\nmessage, and he read the air with his nose as a man might read a\nnewspaper--the salt smells of the seashore and of the dank muck of\nmangrove swamps at low tide, the spicy fragrances of tropic vegetation,\nand the faint, most faint, acrid tingle of smoke from smudgy fires.\n\nThe trade, which had laid the _Arangi_ well up under the lee of this\noutjutting point of Malaita, was now failing, so that she began to roll\nin the easy swells with crashings of sheets and tackles and thunderous\nflappings of her sails.  Jerry no more than cocked a contemptuous\nquizzical eye at the mainsail anticking above him.  He knew already the\nempty windiness of its threats, but he was careful of the mainsheet\nblocks, and walked around the traveller instead of over it.\n\nWhile Captain Van Horn, taking advantage of the calm to exercise the\nboat's crew with the fire-arms and to limber up the weapons, was passing\nout the Lee-Enfields from their place on top the cabin skylight, Jerry\nsuddenly crouched and began to stalk stiff-legged.  But the wild-dog,\nthree feet from his lair under the trade-boxes, was not unobservant.  He\nwatched and snarled threateningly.  It was not a nice snarl.  In fact, it\nwas as nasty and savage a snarl as all his life had been nasty and\nsavage.  Most small creatures were afraid of that snarl, but it had no\ndeterrent effect on Jerry, who continued his steady stalking.  When the\nwild-dog sprang for the hole under the boxes, Jerry sprang after, missing\nhis enemy by inches.  Tossing overboard bits of wood, bottles and empty\ntins, Captain Van Horn ordered the eight eager boat's crew with rifles to\nturn loose.  Jerry was excited and delighted with the fusillade, and\nadded his puppy yelpings to the noise.  As the empty brass cartridges\nwere ejected, the return boys scrambled on the deck for them, esteeming\nthem as very precious objects and thrusting them, still warm, into the\nempty holes in their ears.  Their ears were perforated with many of these\nholes, the smallest capable of receiving a cartridge, while the larger\nones contained-clay pipes, sticks of tobacco, and even boxes of matches.\nSome of the holes in the ear-lobes were so huge that they were plugged\nwith carved wooden cylinders three inches in diameter.\n\nMate and captain carried automatics in their belts, and with these they\nturned loose, shooting away clip after clip to the breathless admiration\nof the blacks for such marvellous rapidity of fire.  The boat's crew were\nnot even fair shots, but Van Horn, like every captain in the Solomons,\nknew that the bush natives and salt-water men were so much worse shots,\nand knew that the shooting of his boat's crew could be depended upon--if\nthe boat's crew itself did not turn against the ship in a pinch.\n\nAt first, Borckman's automatic jammed, and he received a caution from Van\nHorn for his carelessness in not keeping it clean and thin-oiled.  Also,\nBorckman was twittingly asked how many drinks he had taken, and if that\nwas what accounted for his shooting being under his average.  Borckman\nexplained that he had a touch of fever, and Van Horn deferred stating his\ndoubts until a few minutes later, squatting in the shade of the spanker\nwith Jerry in his arms, he told Jerry all about it.\n\n\"The trouble with him is the schnapps, Jerry,\" he explained.  \"Gott-fer-\ndang, it makes me keep all my watches and half of his.  And he says it's\nthe fever.  Never believe it, Jerry.  It's the schnapps--just the plain s-\nc-h-n-a-p-p-s schnapps.  An' he's a good sailor-man, Jerry, when he's\nsober.  But when he's schnappy he's sheer lunatic.  Then his noddle goes\npinwheeling and he's a blighted fool, and he'd snore in a gale and suffer\nfor sleep in a dead calm.--Jerry, you're just beginning to pad those four\nlittle soft feet of yours into the world, so take the advice of one who\nknows and leave the schnapps alone.  Believe me, Jerry, boy--listen to\nyour father--schnapps will never buy you anything.\"\n\nWhereupon, leaving Jerry on deck to stalk the wild-dog, Captain Van Horn\nwent below into the tiny stateroom and took a long drink from the very\nbottle from which Borckman was stealing.\n\nThe stalking of the wild-dog became a game, at least to Jerry, who was so\nmade that his heart bore no malice, and who hugely enjoyed it.  Also, it\ngave him a delightful consciousness of his own mastery, for the wild-dog\nalways fled from him.  At least so far as dogs were concerned, Jerry was\ncock of the deck of the _Arangi_.  It did not enter his head to query how\nhis conduct affected the wild-dog, though, in truth, he led that\nindividual a wretched existence.  Never, except when Jerry was below, did\nthe wild one dare venture more than several feet from his retreat, and he\nwent about in fear and trembling of the fat roly-poly puppy who was\nunafraid of his snarl.\n\nIn the late afternoon, Jerry trotted aft, after having administered\nanother lesson to the wild-dog, and found Skipper seated on the deck,\nback against the low rail, knees drawn up, and gazing absently off to\nleeward.  Jerry sniffed his bare calf--not that he needed to identify it,\nbut just because he liked to, and in a sort of friendly greeting.  But\nVan Horn took no notice, continuing to stare out across the sea.  Nor was\nhe aware of the puppy's presence.\n\nJerry rested the length of his chin on Skipper's knee and gazed long and\nearnestly into Skipper's face.  This time Skipper knew, and was\npleasantly thrilled; but still he gave no sign.  Jerry tried a new tack.\nSkipper's hand drooped idly, half open, from where the forearm rested on\nthe other knee.  Into the part-open hand Jerry thrust his soft golden\nmuzzle to the eyes and remained quite still.  Had he been situated to\nsee, he would have seen a twinkle in Skipper's eyes, which had been\nwithdrawn from the sea and were looking down upon him.  But Jerry could\nnot see.  He kept quiet a little longer, and then gave a prodigious\nsniff.\n\nThis was too much for Skipper, who laughed with such genial heartiness as\nto lay Jerry's silky ears back and down in self-deprecation of affection\nand pleadingness to bask in the sunshine of the god's smile.  Also,\nSkipper's laughter set Jerry's tail wildly bobbing.  The half-open hand\nclosed in a firm grip that gathered in the slack of the skin of one side\nof Jerry's head and jowl.  Then the hand began to shake him back and\nforth with such good will that he was compelled to balance back and forth\non all his four feet.\n\nIt was bliss to Jerry.  Nay, more, it was ecstasy.  For Jerry knew there\nwas neither anger nor danger in the roughness of the shake, and that it\nwas play of the sort that he and Michael had indulged in.  On occasion,\nhe had so played with Biddy and lovingly mauled her about.  And, on very\nrare occasion, _Mister_ Haggin had lovingly mauled him about.  It was\nspeech to Jerry, full of unmistakable meaning.\n\nAs the shake grew rougher, Jerry emitted his most ferocious growl, which\ngrew more ferocious with the increasing violence of the shaking.  But\nthat, too, was play, a making believe to hurt the one he liked too well\nto hurt.  He strained and tugged at the grip, trying to twist his jowl in\nthe slack of skin so as to reach a bite.\n\nWhen Skipper, with a quick thrust, released him and shoved him clear, he\ncame back, all teeth and growl, to be again caught and shaken.  The play\ncontinued, with rising excitement to Jerry.  Once, too quick for Skipper,\nhe caught his hand between teeth; but he did not bring them together.\nThey pressed lovingly, denting the skin, but there was no bite in them.\n\nThe play grew rougher, and Jerry lost himself in the play.  Still\nplaying, he grew so excited that all that had been feigned became actual.\nThis was battle a struggle against the hand that seized and shook him and\nthrust him away.  The make-believe of ferocity passed out of his growls;\nthe ferocity in them became real.  Also, in the moments when he was\nshoved away and was springing back to the attack, he yelped in\nhigh-pitched puppy hysteria.  And Captain Van Horn, realizing, suddenly,\ninstead of clutching, extended his hand wide open in the peace sign that\nis as ancient as the human hand.  At the same time his voice rang out the\nsingle word, \"Jerry!\"  In it was all the imperativeness of reproof and\ncommand and all the solicitous insistence of love.\n\nJerry knew and was checked back to himself.  He was instantly contrite,\nall soft humility, ears laid back with pleadingness for forgiveness and\nprotestation of a warm throbbing heart of love.  Instantly, from an open-\nmouthed, fang-bristling dog in full career of attack, he melted into a\nbundle of softness and silkiness, that trotted to the open hand and\nkissed it with a tongue that flashed out between white gleaming teeth\nlike a rose-red jewel.  And the next moment he was in Skipper's arms,\njowl against cheek, and the tongue was again flashing out in all the\narticulateness possible for a creature denied speech.  It was a veritable\nlove-feast, as dear to one as to the other.\n\n\"Gott-fer-dang!\" Captain Van Horn crooned.  \"You're nothing but a bunch\nof high-strung sensitiveness, with a golden heart in the middle and a\ngolden coat wrapped all around.  Gott-fer-dang, Jerry, you're gold, pure\ngold, inside and out, and no dog was ever minted like you in all the\nworld.  You're heart of gold, you golden dog, and be good to me and love\nme as I shall always be good to you and love you for ever and for ever.\"\n\nAnd Captain Van Horn, who ruled the _Arangi_ in bare legs, a loin cloth,\nand a sixpenny under-shirt, and ran cannibal blacks back and forth in the\nblackbird trade with an automatic strapped to his body waking and\nsleeping and with his head forfeit in scores of salt-water villages and\nbush strongholds, and who was esteemed the toughest skipper in the\nSolomons where only men who are tough may continue to live and esteem\ntoughness, blinked with sudden moisture in his eyes, and could not see\nfor the moment the puppy that quivered all its body of love in his arms\nand kissed away the salty softness of his eyes.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nAnd swift tropic night smote the _Arangi_, as she alternately rolled in\ncalms and heeled and plunged ahead in squalls under the lee of the\ncannibal island of Malaita.  It was a stoppage of the south-east trade\nwind that made for variable weather, and that made cooking on the exposed\ndeck galley a misery and sent the return boys, who had nothing to wet but\ntheir skins, scuttling below.\n\nThe first watch, from eight to twelve, was the mate's; and Captain Van\nHorn, forced below by the driving wet of a heavy rain squall, took Jerry\nwith him to sleep in the tiny stateroom.  Jerry was weary from the\nmanifold excitements of the most exciting day in his life; and he was\nasleep and kicking and growling in his sleep, ere Skipper, with a last\nlook at him and a grin as he turned the lamp low, muttered aloud: \"It's\nthat wild-dog, Jerry.  Get him.  Shake him.  Shake him hard.\"\n\nSo soundly did Jerry sleep, that when the rain, having robbed the\natmosphere of its last breath of wind, ceased and left the stateroom a\nsteaming, suffocating furnace, he did not know when Skipper, panting for\nair, his loin cloth and undershirt soaked with sweat, arose, tucked\nblanket and pillow under his arm, and went on deck.\n\nJerry only awakened when a huge three-inch cockroach nibbled at the\nsensitive and hairless skin between his toes.  He awoke kicking the\noffended foot, and gazed at the cockroach that did not scuttle, but that\nwalked dignifiedly away.  He watched it join other cockroaches that\nparaded the floor.  Never had he seen so many gathered together at one\ntime, and never had he seen such large ones.  They were all of a size,\nand they were everywhere.  Long lines of them poured out of cracks in the\nwalls and descended to join their fellows on the floor.\n\nThe thing was indecent--at least, in Jerry's mind, it was not to be\ntolerated.  _Mister_ Haggin, Derby, and Bob had never tolerated\ncockroaches, and their rules were his rules.  The cockroach was the\neternal tropic enemy.  He sprang at the nearest, pouncing to crush it to\nthe floor under his paws.  But the thing did what he had never known a\ncockroach to do.  It arose in the air strong-flighted as a bird.  And as\nif at a signal, all the multitude of cockroaches took wings of flight and\nfilled the room with their flutterings and circlings.\n\nHe attacked the winged host, leaping into the air, snapping at the flying\nvermin, trying to knock them down with his paws.  Occasionally he\nsucceeded and destroyed one; nor did the combat cease until all the\ncockroaches, as if at another signal, disappeared into the many cracks,\nleaving the room to him.\n\nQuickly, his next thought was: Where is Skipper?  He knew he was not in\nthe room, though he stood up on his hind-legs and investigated the low\nbunk, his keen little nose quivering delightedly while he made little\nsniffs of delight as he smelled the recent presence of Skipper.  And what\nmade his nose quiver and sniff, likewise made his stump of a tail bob\nback and forth.\n\n_But_ _where_ _was_ _Skipper_?  It was a thought in his brain that was as\nsharp and definite as a similar thought would be in a human brain.  And\nit similarly preceded action.  The door had been left hooked open, and\nJerry trotted out into the cabin where half a hundred blacks made queer\nsleep-moanings, and sighings, and snorings.  They were packed closely\ntogether, covering the floor as well as the long sweep of bunks, so that\nhe was compelled to crawl over their naked legs.  And there was no white\ngod about to protect him.  He knew it, but was unafraid.\n\nHaving made sure that Skipper was not in the cabin, Jerry prepared for\nthe perilous ascent of the steep steps that were almost a ladder, then\nrecollected the lazarette.  In he trotted and sniffed at the sleeping\ngirl in the cotton shift who believed that Van Horn was going to eat her\nif he could succeed in fattening her.\n\nBack at the ladder-steps, he looked up and waited in the hope that\nSkipper might appear from above and carry him up.  Skipper had passed\nthat way, he knew, and he knew for two reasons.  It was the only way he\ncould have passed, and Jerry's nose told him that he had passed.  His\nfirst attempt to climb the steps began well.  Not until a third of the\nway up, as the _Arangi_ rolled in a sea and recovered with a jerk, did he\nslip and fall.  Two or three boys awoke and watched him while they\nprepared and chewed betel nut and lime wrapped in green leaves.\n\nTwice, barely started, Jerry slipped back, and more boys, awakened by\ntheir fellows, sat up and enjoyed his plight.  In the fourth attempt he\nmanaged to gain half way up before he fell, coming down heavily on his\nside.  This was hailed with low laughter and querulous chirpings that\nmight well have come from the throats of huge birds.  He regained his\nfeet, absurdly bristled the hair on his shoulders and absurdly growled\nhis high disdain of these lesser, two-legged things that came and went\nand obeyed the wills of great, white-skinned, two-legged gods such as\nSkipper and Mister Haggin.\n\nUndeterred by his heavy fall, Jerry essayed the ladder again.  A\ntemporary easement of the _Arangi's_ rolling gave him his opportunity, so\nthat his forefeet were over the high combing of the companion when the\nnext big roll came.  He held on by main strength of his bent forelegs,\nthen scrambled over and out on deck.\n\nAmidships, squatting on the deck near the sky-light, he investigated\nseveral of the boat's crew and Lerumie.  He identified them\ncircumspectly, going suddenly stiff-legged as Lerumie made a low,\nhissing, menacing noise.  Aft, at the wheel, he found a black steering,\nand, near him, the mate keeping the watch.  Just as the mate spoke to him\nand stooped to pat him, Jerry whiffed Skipper somewhere near at hand.\nWith a conciliating, apologetic bob of his tail, he trotted on up wind\nand came upon Skipper on his back, rolled in a blanket so that only his\nhead stuck out, and sound asleep.\n\nFirst of all Jerry needs must joyfully sniff him and joyfully wag his\ntail.  But Skipper did not awake and a fine spray of rain, almost as thin\nas mist, made Jerry curl up and press closely into the angle formed by\nSkipper's head and shoulder.  This did awake him, for he uttered \"Jerry\"\nin a low, crooning voice, and Jerry responded with a touch of his cold\ndamp nose to the other's cheek.  And then Skipper went to sleep again.\nBut not Jerry.  He lifted the edge of the blanket with his nose and\ncrawled across the shoulder until he was altogether inside.  This roused\nSkipper, who, half-asleep, helped him to curl up.\n\nStill Jerry was not satisfied, and he squirmed around until he lay in the\nhollow of Skipper's arm, his head resting on Skipper's shoulder, when,\nwith a profound sigh of content, he fell asleep.\n\nSeveral times the noises made by the boat's crew in trimming the sheets\nto the shifting draught of air roused Van Horn, and each time,\nremembering the puppy, he pressed him caressingly with his hollowed arm.\nAnd each time, in his sleep, Jerry stirred responsively and snuggled\ncosily to him.\n\nFor all that he was a remarkable puppy, Jerry had his limitations, and he\ncould never know the effect produced on the hard-bitten captain by the\nsoft warm contact of his velvet body.  But it made the captain remember\nback across the years to his own girl babe asleep on his arm.  And so\npoignantly did he remember, that he became wide awake, and many pictures,\nbeginning, with the girl babe, burned their torment in his brain.  No\nwhite man in the Solomons knew what he carried about with him, waking and\noften sleeping; and it was because of these pictures that he had come to\nthe Solomons in a vain effort to erase them.\n\nFirst, memory-prodded by the soft puppy in his arm, he saw the girl and\nthe mother in the little Harlem flat.  Small, it was true, but\ntight-packed with the happiness of three that made it heaven.\n\nHe saw the girl's flaxen-yellow hair darken to her mother's gold as it\nlengthened into curls and ringlets until finally it became two thick long\nbraids.  From striving not to see these many pictures he came even to\ndwelling upon them in the effort so to fill his consciousness as to keep\nout the one picture he did not want to see.\n\nHe remembered his work, the wrecking car, and the wrecking crew that had\ntoiled under him, and he wondered what had become of Clancey, his right-\nhand man.  Came the long day, when, routed from bed at three in the\nmorning to dig a surface car out of the wrecked show windows of a drug\nstore and get it back on the track, they had laboured all day clearing up\na half-dozen smash-ups and arrived at the car house at nine at night just\nas another call came in.\n\n\"Glory be!\" said Clancey, who lived in the next block from him.  He could\nsee him saying it and wiping the sweat from his grimy face.  \"Glory be,\n'tis a small matter at most, an' right in our neighbourhood--not a dozen\nblocks away.  Soon as it's done we can beat it for home an' let the down-\ntown boys take the car back to the shop.\"\n\n\"We've only to jack her up for a moment,\" he had answered.\n\n\"What is it?\" Billy Jaffers, another of the crew, asked.\n\n\"Somebody run over--can't get them out,\" he said, as they swung on board\nthe wrecking-car and started.\n\nHe saw again all the incidents of the long run, not omitting the delay\ncaused by hose-carts and a hook-and-ladder running to a cross-town fire,\nduring which time he and Clancey had joked Jaffers over the dates with\nvarious fictitious damsels out of which he had been cheated by the\nnight's extra work.\n\nCame the long line of stalled street-cars, the crowd, the police holding\nit back, the two ambulances drawn up and waiting their freight, and the\nyoung policeman, whose beat it was, white and shaken, greeting him with:\n\"It's horrible, man.  It's fair sickening.  Two of them.  We can't get\nthem out.  I tried.  One was still living, I think.\"\n\nBut he, strong man and hearty, used to such work, weary with the hard day\nand with a pleasant picture of the bright little flat waiting him a dozen\nblocks away when the job was done, spoke cheerfully, confidently, saying\nthat he'd have them out in a jiffy, as he stooped and crawled under the\ncar on hands and knees.\n\nAgain he saw himself as he pressed the switch of his electric torch and\nlooked.  Again he saw the twin braids of heavy golden hair ere his thumb\nrelaxed from the switch, leaving him in darkness.\n\n\"Is the one alive yet?\" the shaken policeman asked.\n\nAnd the question was repeated, while he struggled for will power\nsufficient to press on the light.\n\nHe heard himself reply, \"I'll tell you in a minute.\"\n\nAgain he saw himself look.  For a long minute he looked.\n\n\"Both dead,\" he answered quietly.  \"Clancey, pass in a number three jack,\nand get under yourself with another at the other end of the truck.\"\n\nHe lay on his back, staring straight up at one single star that rocked\nmistily through a thinning of cloud-stuff overhead.  The old ache was in\nhis throat, the old harsh dryness in mouth and eyes.  And he knew--what\nno other man knew--why he was in the Solomons, skipper of the teak-built\nyacht _Arangi_, running niggers, risking his head, and drinking more\nScotch whiskey than was good for any man.\n\nNot since that night had he looked with warm eyes on any woman.  And he\nhad been noted by other whites as notoriously cold toward pickanninnies\nwhite or black.\n\nBut, having visioned the ultimate horror of memory, Van Horn was soon\nable to fall asleep again, delightfully aware, as he drowsed off, of\nJerry's head on his shoulder.  Once, when Jerry, dreaming of the beach at\nMeringe and of _Mister_ Haggin, Biddy, Terrence, and Michael, set up a\nlow whimpering, Van Horn roused sufficiently to soothe him closer to him,\nand to mutter ominously: \"Any nigger that'd hurt that pup. . . \"\n\nAt midnight when the mate touched him on the shoulder, in the moment of\nawakening and before he was awake Van Horn did two things automatically\nand swiftly.  He darted his right hand down to the pistol at his hip, and\nmuttered: \"Any nigger that'd hurt that pup . . .\"\n\n\"That'll be Kopo Point abreast,\" Borckman explained, as both men stared\nto windward at the high loom of the land.  \"She hasn't made more than ten\nmiles, and no promise of anything steady.\"\n\n\"There's plenty of stuff making up there, if it'll ever come down,\" Van\nHorn said, as both men transferred their gaze to the clouds drifting with\nmany breaks across the dim stars.\n\nScarcely had the mate fetched a blanket from below and turned in on deck,\nthan a brisk steady breeze sprang up from off the land, sending the\n_Arangi_ through the smooth water at a nine-knot clip.  For a time Jerry\ntried to stand the watch with Skipper, but he soon curled up and dozed\noff, partly on the deck and partly on Skipper's bare feet.\n\nWhen Skipper carried him to the blanket and rolled him in, he was quickly\nasleep again; and he was quickly awake, out of the blanket, and padding\nafter along the deck as Skipper paced up and down.  Here began another\nlesson, and in five minutes Jerry learned it was the will of Skipper that\nhe should remain in the blanket, that everything was all right, and that\nSkipper would be up and down and near him all the time.\n\nAt four the mate took charge of the deck.\n\n\"Reeled off thirty miles,\" Van Horn told him.  \"But now it is baffling\nagain.  Keep an eye for squalls under the land.  Better throw the\nhalyards down on deck and make the watch stand by.  Of course they'll\nsleep, but make them sleep on the halyards and sheets.\"\n\nJerry roused to Skipper's entrance under the blanket, and, quite as if it\nwere a long-established custom, curled in between his arm and side, and,\nafter one happy sniff and one kiss of his cool little tongue, as Skipper\npressed his cheek against him caressingly, dozed off to sleep.\n\nHalf an hour later, to all intents and purposes, so far as Jerry could or\ncould not comprehend, the world might well have seemed suddenly coming to\nan end.  What awoke him was the flying leap of Skipper that sent the\nblanket one way and Jerry the other.  The deck of the _Arangi_ had become\na wall, down which Jerry slipped through the roaring dark.  Every rope\nand shroud was thrumming and screeching in resistance to the fierce\nweight of the squall.\n\n\"Stand by main halyards!--Jump!\" he could hear Skipper shouting loudly;\nalso he heard the high note of the mainsheet screaming across the sheaves\nas Van Horn, bending braces in the dark, was swiftly slacking the sheet\nthrough his scorching palms with a single turn on the cleat.\n\nWhile all this, along with many other noises, squealings of boat-boys and\nshouts of Borckman, was impacting on Jerry's ear-drums, he was still\nsliding down the steep deck of his new and unstable world.  But he did\nnot bring up against the rail where his fragile ribs might well have been\nbroken.  Instead, the warm ocean water, pouring inboard across the buried\nrail in a flood of pale phosphorescent fire, cushioned his fall.  A\nraffle of trailing ropes entangled him as he struck out to swim.\n\nAnd he swam, not to save his life, not with the fear of death upon him.\nThere was but one idea in his mind.  _Where_ _was_ _Skipper_?  Not that\nhe had any thought of trying to save Skipper, nor that he might be of\nassistance to him.  It was the heart of love that drives one always\ntoward the beloved.  As the mother in catastrophe tries to gain her babe,\nas the Greek who, dying, remembered sweet Argos, as soldiers on a\nstricken field pass with the names of their women upon their lips, so\nJerry, in this wreck of a world, yearned toward Skipper.\n\nThe squall ceased as abruptly as it had struck.  The _Arangi_ righted\nwith a jerk to an even keel, leaving Jerry stranded in the starboard\nscuppers.  He trotted across the level deck to Skipper, who, standing\nerect on wide-spread legs, the bight of the mainsheet still in his hand,\nwas exclaiming:\n\n\"Gott-fer-dang!  Wind he go!  Rain he no come!\"\n\nHe felt Jerry's cool nose against his bare calf, heard his joyous sniff,\nand bent and caressed him.  In the darkness he could not see, but his\nheart warmed with knowledge that Jerry's tail was surely bobbing.\n\nMany of the frightened return boys had crowded on deck, and their\nplaintive, querulous voices sounded like the sleepy noises of a roost of\nbirds.  Borckman came and stood by Van Horn's shoulder, and both men,\nstrung to their tones in the tenseness of apprehension, strove to\npenetrate the surrounding blackness with their eyes, while they listened\nwith all their ears for any message of the elements from sea and air.\n\n\"Where's the rain?\" Borckman demanded peevishly.  \"Always wind first, the\nrain follows and kills the wind.  There is no rain.\"\n\nVan Horn still stared and listened, and made no answer.\n\nThe anxiety of the two men was sensed by Jerry, who, too, was on his\ntoes.  He pressed his cool nose to Skipper's leg, and the rose-kiss of\nhis tongue brought him the salt taste of sea-water.\n\nSkipper bent suddenly, rolled Jerry with quick toughness into the\nblanket, and deposited him in the hollow between two sacks of yams lashed\non deck aft of the mizzenmast.  As an afterthought, he fastened the\nblanket with a piece of rope yarn, so that Jerry was as if tied in a\nsack.\n\nScarcely was this finished when the spanker smashed across overhead, the\nheadsails thundered with a sudden filling, and the great mainsail, with\nall the scope in the boom-tackle caused by Van Horn's giving of the\nsheet, came across and fetched up to tautness on the tackle with a crash\nthat shook the vessel and heeled her violently to port.  This second\nknock-down had come from the opposite direction, and it was mightier than\nthe first.\n\nJerry heard Skipper's voice ring out, first, to the mate: \"Stand by main-\nhalyards!  Throw off the turns!  I'll take care of the tackle!\"; and,\nnext, to some of the boat's crew: \"Batto! you fella slack spanker tackle\nquick fella!  Ranga! you fella let go spanker sheet!\"\n\nHere Van Horn was swept off his legs by an avalanche of return boys who\nhad cluttered the deck with the first squall.  The squirming mass, of\nwhich he was part, slid down into the barbed wire of the port rail\nbeneath the surface of the sea.\n\nJerry was so secure in his nook that he did not roll away.  But when he\nheard Skipper's commands cease, and, seconds later, heard his cursings in\nthe barbed wire, he set up a shrill yelping and clawed and scratched\nfrantically at the blanket to get out.  Something had happened to\nSkipper.  He knew that.  It was all that he knew, for he had no thought\nof himself in the chaos of the ruining world.\n\nBut he ceased his yelping to listen to a new noise--a thunderous slatting\nof canvas accompanied by shouts and cries.  He sensed, and sensed\nwrongly, that it boded ill, for he did not know that it was the mainsail\nbeing lowered on the run after Skipper had slashed the boom-tackle across\nwith his sheath-knife.\n\nAs the pandemonium grew, he added his own yelping to it until he felt a\nfumbling hand without the blanket.  He stilled and sniffed.  No, it was\nnot Skipper.  He sniffed again and recognized the person.  It was\nLerumie, the black whom he had seen rolled on the beach by Biddy only the\nprevious morning, who, still were recently, had kicked him on his stub of\na tail, and who not more than a week before he had seen throw a rock at\nTerrence.\n\nThe rope yarn had been parted, and Lerumie's fingers were feeling inside\nthe blanket for him.  Jerry snarled his wickedest.  The thing was\nsacrilege.  He, as a white man's dog, was taboo to all blacks.  He had\nearly learned the law that no nigger must ever touch a white-god's dog.\nYet Lerumie, who was all of evil, at this moment when the world crashed\nabout their ears, was daring to touch him.\n\nAnd when the fingers touched him, his teeth closed upon them.  Next, he\nwas clouted by the black's free hand with such force as to tear his\nclenched teeth down the fingers through skin and flesh until the fingers\nwent clear.\n\nRaging like a tiny fiend, Jerry found himself picked up by the neck, half-\nthrottled, and flung through the air.  And while flying through the air,\nhe continued to squall his rage.  He fell into the sea and went under,\ngulping a mouthful of salt water into his lungs, and came up strangling\nbut swimming.  Swimming was one of the things he did not have to think\nabout.  He had never had to learn to swim, any more than he had had to\nlearn to breathe.  In fact, he had been compelled to learn to walk; but\nhe swam as a matter of course.\n\nThe wind screamed about him.  Flying froth, driven on the wind's breath,\nfilled his mouth and nostrils and beat into his eyes, stinging and\nblinding him.  In the struggle to breathe he, all unlearned in the ways\nof the sea, lifted his muzzle high in the air to get out of the\nsuffocating welter.  As a result, off the horizontal, the churning of his\nlegs no longer sustained him, and he went down and under perpendicularly.\nAgain he emerged, strangling with more salt water in his windpipe.  This\ntime, without reasoning it out, merely moving along the line of least\nresistance, which was to him the line of greatest comfort, he\nstraightened out in the sea and continued so to swim as to remain\nstraightened out.\n\nThrough the darkness, as the squall spent itself, came the slatting of\nthe half-lowered mainsail, the shrill voices of the boat's crew, a curse\nof Borckman's, and, dominating all, Skipper's voice, shouting:\n\n\"Grab the leech, you fella boys!  Hang on!  Drag down strong fella!  Come\nin mainsheet two blocks!  Jump, damn you, jump!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nAt recognition of Skipper's voice, Jerry, floundering in the stiff and\ncrisping sea that sprang up with the easement of the wind, yelped eagerly\nand yearningly, all his love for his new-found beloved eloquent in his\nthroat.  But quickly all sounds died away as the _Arangi_ drifted from\nhim.  And then, in the loneliness of the dark, on the heaving breast of\nthe sea that he recognized as one more of the eternal enemies, he began\nto whimper and cry plaintively like a lost child.\n\nFurther, by the dim, shadowy ways of intuition, he knew his weakness in\nthat merciless sea with no heart of warmth, that threatened the\nunknowable thing, vaguely but terribly guessed, namely, death.  As\nregarded himself, he did not comprehend death.  He, who had never known\nthe time when he was not alive, could not conceive of the time when he\nwould cease to be alive.\n\nYet it was there, shouting its message of warning through every tissue\ncell, every nerve quickness and brain sensitivity of him--a totality of\nsensation that foreboded the ultimate catastrophe of life about which he\nknew nothing at all, but which, nevertheless, he _felt_ to be the\nconclusive supreme disaster.  Although he did not comprehend it, he\napprehended it no less poignantly than do men who know and generalize far\nmore deeply and widely than mere four-legged dogs.\n\nAs a man struggles in the throes of nightmare, so Jerry struggled in the\nvexed, salt-suffocating sea.  And so he whimpered and cried, lost child,\nlost puppy-dog that he was, only half a year existent in the fair world\nsharp with joy and suffering.  And he _wanted_ _Skipper_.  Skipper was a\ngod.\n\n* * * * *\n\nOn board the _Arangi_, relieved by the lowering of her mainsail, as the\nfierceness went out of the wind and the cloudburst of tropic rain began\nto fall, Van Horn and Borckman lurched toward each other in the\nblackness.\n\n\"A double squall,\" said Van Horn.  \"Hit us to starboard and to port.\"\n\n\"Must a-split in half just before she hit us,\" the mate concurred.\n\n\"And kept all the rain in the second half--\"\n\nVan Horn broke off with an oath.\n\n\"Hey!  What's the matter along you fella boy?\" he shouted to the man at\nthe wheel.\n\nFor the ketch, under her spanker which had just then been flat-hauled,\nhad come into the wind, emptying her after-sail and permitting her\nheadsails to fill on the other tack.  The _Arangi_ was beginning to work\nback approximately over the course she had just traversed.  And this\nmeant that she was going back toward Jerry floundering in the sea.  Thus,\nthe balance, on which his life titubated, was inclined in his favour by\nthe blunder of a black steersman.\n\nKeeping the _Arangi_ on the new tack, Van Horn set Borckman clearing the\nmess of ropes on deck, himself, squatting in the rain, undertaking to\nlong-splice the tackle he had cut.  As the rain thinned, so that the\ncrackle of it on deck became less noisy, he was attracted by a sound from\nout over the water.  He suspended the work of his hands to listen, and,\nwhen he recognized Jerry's wailing, sprang to his feet, galvanized into\naction.\n\n\"The pup's overboard!\" he shouted to Borckman.  \"Back your jib to\nwind'ard!\"\n\nHe sprang aft, scattering a cluster of return boys right and left.\n\n\"Hey!  You fella boat's crew!  Come in spanker sheet!  Flatten her down\ngood fella!\"\n\nHe darted a look into the binnacle and took a hurried compass bearing of\nthe sounds Jerry was making.\n\n\"Hard down your wheel!\" he ordered the helmsman, then leaped to the wheel\nand put it down himself, repeating over and over aloud, \"Nor'east by east\na quarter, nor'east by east a quarter.\"\n\nBack and peering into the binnacle, he listened vainly for another wail\nfrom Jerry in the hope of verifying his first hasty bearing.  But not\nlong he waited.  Despite the fact that by his manoeuvre the _Arangi_ had\nbeen hove to, he knew that windage and sea-driftage would quickly send\nher away from the swimming puppy.  He shouted Borckman to come aft and\nhaul in the whaleboat, while he hurried below for his electric torch and\na boat compass.\n\nThe ketch was so small that she was compelled to tow her one whaleboat\nastern on long double painters, and by the time the mate had it hauled in\nunder the stern, Van Horn was back.  He was undeterred by the barbed\nwire, lifting boy after boy of the boat's crew over it and dropping them\nsprawling into the boat, following himself, as the last, by swinging over\non the spanker boom, and calling his last instructions as the painters\nwere cast off.\n\n\"Get a riding light on deck, Borckman.  Keep her hove to.  Don't hoist\nthe mainsail.  Clean up the decks and bend the watch tackle on the main\nboom.\"\n\nHe took the steering-sweep and encouraged the rowers with:\n\"Washee-washee, good fella, washee-washee!\"--which is the beche-de-mer\nfor \"row hard.\"\n\nAs he steered, he kept flashing the torch on the boat compass so that he\ncould keep headed north-east by east a quarter east.  Then he remembered\nthat the boat compass, on such course, deviated two whole points from the\n_Arangi's_ compass, and altered his own course accordingly.\n\nOccasionally he bade the rowers cease, while he listened and called for\nJerry.  He had them row in circles, and work back and forth, up to\nwindward and down to leeward, over the area of dark sea that he reasoned\nmust contain the puppy.\n\n\"Now you fella boy listen ear belong you,\" he said, toward the first.\n\"Maybe one fella boy hear 'm pickaninny dog sing out, I give 'm that\nfella boy five fathom calico, two ten sticks tobacco.\"\n\nAt the end of half an hour he was offering \"Two ten fathoms calico and\nten ten sticks tobacco\" to the boy who first heard \"pickaninny dog sing\nout.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\nJerry was in bad shape.  Not accustomed to swimming, strangled by the\nsalt water that lapped into his open mouth, he was getting loggy when\nfirst he chanced to see the flash of the captain's torch.  This, however,\nhe did not connect with Skipper, and so took no more notice of it than he\ndid of the first stars showing in the sky.  It never entered his mind\nthat it might be a star nor even that it might not be a star.  He\ncontinued to wail and to strangle with more salt water.  But when he at\nlength heard Skipper's voice he went immediately wild.  He attempted to\nstand up and to rest his forepaws on Skipper's voice coming out of the\ndarkness, as he would have rested his forepaws on Skipper's leg had he\nbeen near.  The result was disastrous.  Out of the horizontal, he sank\ndown and under, coming up with a new spasm of strangling.\n\nThis lasted for a short time, during which the strangling prevented him\nfrom answering Skipper's cry, which continued to reach him.  But when he\ncould answer he burst forth in a joyous yelp.  Skipper was coming to take\nhim out of the stinging, biting sea that blinded his eyes and hurt him to\nbreathe.  Skipper was truly a god, his god, with a god's power to save.\n\nSoon he heard the rhythmic clack of the oars on the thole-pins, and the\njoy in his own yelp was duplicated by the joy in Skipper's voice, which\nkept up a running encouragement, broken by objurgations to the rowers.\n\n\"All right, Jerry, old man.  All right, Jerry.  All right.--Washee-washee,\nyou fella boy!--Coming, Jerry, coming.  Stick it out, old man.  Stay with\nit.--Washee-washee like hell!--Here we are, Jerry.  Stay with it.  Hang\non, old boy, we'll get you.--Easy . . . easy.  'Vast washee.\"\n\nAnd then, with amazing abruptness, Jerry saw the whaleboat dimly emerge\nfrom the gloom close upon him, was blinded by the stab of the torch full\nin his eyes, and, even as he yelped his joy, felt and recognized\nSkipper's hand clutching him by the slack of the neck and lifting him\ninto the air.\n\nHe landed wet and soppily against Skipper's rain-wet chest, his tail\nbobbing frantically against Skipper's containing arm, his body wriggling,\nhis tongue dabbing madly all over Skipper's chin and mouth and cheeks and\nnose.  And Skipper did not know that he was himself wet, and that he was\nin the first shock of recurrent malaria precipitated by the wet and the\nexcitement.  He knew only that the puppy-dog, given him only the previous\nmorning, was safe back in his arms.\n\nWhile the boat's crew bent to the oars, he steered with the sweep between\nhis arm and his side in order that he might hold Jerry with the other\narm.\n\n\"You little son of a gun,\" he crooned, and continued to croon, over and\nover.  \"You little son of a gun.\"\n\nAnd Jerry responded with tongue-kisses, whimpering and crying as is the\nway of lost children immediately after they are found.  Also, he shivered\nviolently.  But it was not from the cold.  Rather was it due to his over-\nstrung, sensitive nerves.\n\nAgain on board, Van Horn stated his reasoning to the mate.\n\n\"The pup didn't just calmly walk overboard.  Nor was he washed overboard.\nI had him fast and triced in the blanket with a rope yarn.\"\n\nHe walked over, the centre of the boat's crew and of the three-score\nreturn boys who were all on deck, and flashed his torch on the blanket\nstill lying on the yams.\n\n\"That proves it.  The rope-yarn's cut.  The knot's still in it.  Now what\nnigger is responsible?\"\n\nHe looked about at the circle of dark faces, flashing the light on them,\nand such was the accusation and anger in his eyes, that all eyes fell\nbefore his or looked away.\n\n\"If only the pup could speak,\" he complained.  \"He'd tell who it was.\"\n\nHe bent suddenly down to Jerry, who was standing as close against his\nlegs as he could, so close that his wet forepaws rested on Skipper's bare\nfeet.\n\n\"You know 'm, Jerry, you known the black fella boy,\" he said, his words\nquick and exciting, his hand moving in questing circles toward the\nblacks.\n\nJerry was all alive on the instant, jumping about, barking with short\nyelps of eagerness.\n\n\"I do believe the dog could lead me to him,\" Van Horn confided to the\nmate.  \"Come on, Jerry, find 'm, sick 'm, shake 'm down.  Where is he,\nJerry?  Find 'm.  Find 'm.\"\n\nAll that Jerry knew was that Skipper wanted something.  He must find\nsomething that Skipper wanted, and he was eager to serve.  He pranced\nabout aimlessly and willingly for a space, while Skipper's urging cries\nincreased his excitement.  Then he was struck by an idea, and a most\ndefinite idea it was.  The circle of boys broke to let him through as he\nraced for'ard along the starboard side to the tight-lashed heap of trade-\nboxes.  He put his nose into the opening where the wild-dog laired, and\nsniffed.  Yes, the wild-dog was inside.  Not only did he smell him, but\nhe heard the menace of his snarl.\n\nHe looked up to Skipper questioningly.  Was it that Skipper wanted him to\ngo in after the wild-dog?  But Skipper laughed and waved his hand to show\nthat he wanted him to search in other places for something else.\n\nHe leaped away, sniffing in likely places where experience had taught him\ncockroaches and rats might be.  Yet it quickly dawned on him that it was\nnot such things Skipper was after.  His heart was wild with desire to\nserve, and, without clear purpose, he began sniffing legs of black boys.\n\nThis brought livelier urgings and encouragements from Skipper, and made\nhim almost frantic.  That was it.  He must identify the boat's crew and\nthe return boys by their legs.  He hurried the task, passing swiftly from\nboy to boy, until he came to Lerumie.\n\nAnd then he forgot that Skipper wanted him to do something.  All he knew\nwas that it was Lerumie who had broken the taboo of his sacred person by\nlaying hands on him, and that it was Lerumie who had thrown him\noverboard.\n\nWith a cry of rage, a flash of white teeth, and a bristle of short neck-\nhair, he sprang for the black.  Lerumie fled down the deck, and Jerry\npursued amid the laughter of all the blacks.  Several times, in making\nthe circuit of the deck, he managed to scratch the flying calves with his\nteeth.  Then Lerumie took to the main rigging, leaving Jerry impotently\nto rage on the deck beneath him.\n\nAbout this point the blacks grouped in a semi-circle at a respectful\ndistance, with Van Horn to the fore beside Jerry.  Van Horn centred his\nelectric torch on the black in the rigging, and saw the long parallel\nscratches on the fingers of the hand that had invaded Jerry's blanket.  He\npointed them out significantly to Borckman, who stood outside the circle\nso that no black should be able to come at his back.\n\nSkipper picked Jerry up and soothed his anger with:\n\n\"Good boy, Jerry.  You marked and sealed him.  Some dog, you, some big\nman-dog.\"\n\nHe turned back to Lerumie, illuminating him as he clung in the rigging,\nand his voice was harsh and cold as he addressed him.\n\n\"What name belong along you fella boy?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Me fella Lerumie,\" came the chirping, quavering answer.\n\n\"You come along Pennduffryn?\"\n\n\"Me come along Meringe.\"\n\nCaptain Van Horn debated the while he fondled the puppy in his arms.\nAfter all, it was a return boy.  In a day, in two days at most, he would\nhave him landed and be quit of him.\n\n\"My word,\" he harangued, \"me angry along you.  Me angry big fella too\nmuch along you.  Me angry along you any amount.  What name you fella boy\nmake 'm pickaninny dog belong along me walk about along water?\"\n\nLerumie was unable to answer.  He rolled his eyes helplessly, resigned to\nreceive a whipping such as he had long since bitterly learned white\nmasters were wont to administer.\n\nCaptain Van Horn repeated the question, and the black repeated the\nhelpless rolling of his eyes.\n\n\"For two sticks tobacco I knock 'm seven bells outa you,\" the skipper\nbullied.  \"Now me give you strong fella talk too much.  You look 'm eye\nbelong you one time along this fella dog belong me, I knock 'm seven\nbells and whole starboard watch outa you.  Savve?\"\n\n\"Me savve,\" Lerumie, plaintively replied; and the episode was closed.\n\nThe return boys went below to sleep in the cabin.  Borckman and the\nboat's crew hoisted the mainsail and put the _Arangi_ on her course.  And\nSkipper, under a dry blanket from below, lay down to sleep with Jerry,\nhead on his shoulder, in the hollow of his arm.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nAt seven in the morning, when Skipper rolled him out of the blanket and\ngot up, Jerry celebrated the new day by chasing the wild-dog back into\nhis hole and by drawing a snicker from the blacks on deck, when, with a\ngrowl and a flash of teeth, he made Lerumie side-step half a dozen feet\nand yield the deck to him.\n\nHe shared breakfast with Skipper, who, instead of eating, washed down\nwith a cup of coffee fifty grains of quinine wrapped in a cigarette\npaper, and who complained to the mate that he would have to get under the\nblankets and sweat out the fever that was attacking him.  Despite his\nchill, and despite his teeth that were already beginning to chatter while\nthe burning sun extracted the moisture in curling mist-wreaths from the\ndeck planking, Van Horn cuddled Jerry in his arms and called him\nprinceling, and prince, and a king, and a son of kings.\n\nFor Van Horn had often listened to the recitals of Jerry's pedigree by\nTom Haggin, over Scotch-and-sodas, when it was too pestilentially hot to\ngo to bed.  And the pedigree was as royal-blooded as was possible for an\nIrish terrier to possess, whose breed, beginning with the ancient Irish\nwolf-hound, had been moulded and established by man in less than two\ngenerations of men.\n\nThere was Terrence the Magnificent--descended, as Van Horn remembered,\nfrom the American-bred Milton Droleen, out of the Queen of County Antrim,\nBreda Muddler, which royal bitch, as every one who is familiar with the\nstud book knows, goes back as far as the almost mythical Spuds, with\nalong the way no primrose dallyings with black-and-tan Killeney Boys and\nWelsh nondescripts.  And did not Biddy trace to Erin, mother and star of\nthe breed, through a long descendant out of Breda Mixer, herself an\nancestress of Breda Muddler?  Nor could be omitted from the purple record\nthe later ancestress, Moya Doolen.\n\nSo Jerry knew the ecstasy of loving and of being loved in the arms of his\nlove-god, although little he knew of such phrases as \"king's son\" and\n\"son of kings,\" save that they connoted love for him in the same way that\nLerumie's hissing noises connoted hate.  One thing Jerry knew without\nknowing that he knew, namely, that in the few hours he had been with\nSkipper he loved him more than he had loved Derby and Bob, who, with the\nexception of Mister Haggin, were the only other white-gods he had ever\nknown.  He was not conscious of this.  He merely loved, merely acted on\nthe prompting of his heart, or head, or whatever organic or anatomical\npart of him that developed the mysterious, delicious, and insatiable\nhunger called \"love.\"\n\nSkipper went below.  He went all unheeding of Jerry, who padded softly at\nhis heels until the companionway was reached.  Skipper was unheeding of\nJerry because of the fever that wrenched his flesh and chilled his bones,\nthat made his head seem to swell monstrously, that glazed the world to\nhis swimming eyes and made him walk feebly and totteringly like a drunken\nman or a man very aged.  And Jerry sensed that something was wrong with\nSkipper.\n\nSkipper, beginning the babblings of delirium which alternated with silent\nmoments of control in order to get below and under blankets, descended\nthe ladder-like stairs, and Jerry, all-yearning, controlled himself in\nsilence and watched the slow descent with the hope that when Skipper\nreached the bottom he would raise his arms and lift him down.  But\nSkipper was too far gone to remember that Jerry existed.  He staggered,\nwith wide-spread arms to keep from falling, along the cabin floor for'ard\nto the bunk in the tiny stateroom.\n\nJerry was truly of a kingly line.  He wanted to call out and beg to be\ntaken down.  But he did not.  He controlled himself, he knew not why,\nsave that he was possessed by a nebulous awareness that Skipper must be\nconsidered as a god should be considered, and that this was no time to\nobtrude himself on Skipper.  His heart was torn with desire, although he\nmade no sound, and he continued only to yearn over the companion combing\nand to listen to the faint sounds of Skipper's progress for'ard.\n\nBut even kings and their descendants have their limitations, and at the\nend of a quarter of an hour Jerry was ripe to cease from his silence.\nWith the going below of Skipper, evidently in great trouble, the light\nhad gone out of the day for Jerry.  He might have stalked the wild-dog,\nbut no inducement lay there.  Lerumie passed by unnoticed, although he\nknew he could bully him and make him give deck space.  The myriad scents\nof the land entered his keen nostrils, but he made no note of them.  Not\neven the flopping, bellying mainsail overhead, as the _Arangi_ rolled\nbecalmed, could draw a glance of quizzical regard from him.\n\nJust as it was tremblingly imperative that Jerry must suddenly squat\ndown, point his nose at the zenith, and vocalize his heart-rending woe,\nan idea came to him.  There is no explaining how this idea came.  No more\ncan it be explained than can a human explain why, at luncheon to-day, he\nselects green peas and rejects string beans, when only yesterday he\nelected to choose string beans and to reject green peas.  No more can it\nbe explained than can a human judge, sentencing a convicted criminal and\nimposing eight years imprisonment instead of the five or nine years that\nalso at the same time floated upward in his brain, explain why he\ncategorically determined on eight years as the just, adequate punishment.\nSince not even humans, who are almost half-gods, can fathom the mystery\nof the genesis of ideas and the dictates of choice, appearing in their\nconsciousness as ideas, it is not to be expected of a more dog to know\nthe why of the ideas that animate it to definite acts toward definite\nends.\n\nAnd so Jerry.  Just as he must immediately howl, he was aware that the\nidea, an entirely different idea, was there, in the innermost centre of\nthe quick-thinkingness of him, with all its compulsion.  He obeyed the\nidea as a marionette obeys the strings, and started forthwith down the\ndeck aft in quest of the mate.\n\nHe had an appeal to make to Borckman.  Borckman was also a two-legged\nwhite-god.  Easily could Borckman lift him down the precipitous ladder,\nwhich was to him, unaided, a taboo, the violation of which was pregnant\nwith disaster.  But Borckman had in him little of the heart of love,\nwhich is understanding.  Also, Borckman was busy.  Besides overseeing the\ncontinuous adjustment, by trimming of sails and orders to the helmsman,\nof the _Arangi_ to her way on the sea, and overseeing the boat's crew at\nits task of washing deck and polishing brasswork, he was engaged in\nsteadily nipping from a stolen bottle of his captain's whiskey which he\nhad stowed away in the hollow between the two sacks of yams lashed on\ndeck aft the mizzenmast.\n\nBorckman was on his way for another nip, after having thickly threatened\nto knock seven bells and the ten commandments out of the black at the\nwheel for faulty steering, when Jerry appeared before him and blocked the\nway to his desire.  But Jerry did not block him as he would have blocked\nLerumie, for instance.  There was no showing of teeth, no bristling of\nneck hair.  Instead, Jerry was all placation and appeal, all softness of\npleading in a body denied speech that nevertheless was articulate, from\nwagging tail and wriggling sides to flat-laid ears and eyes that almost\nspoke, to any human sensitive of understanding.\n\nBut Borckman saw in his way only a four-legged creature of the brute\nworld, which, in his arrogant brutalness he esteemed more brute than\nhimself.  All the pretty picture of the soft puppy, instinct with\ncommunicativeness, bursting with tenderness of petition, was veiled to\nhis vision.  What he saw was merely a four-legged animal to be thrust\naside while he continued his lordly two-legged progress toward the bottle\nthat could set maggots crawling in his brain and make him dream dreams\nthat he was prince, not peasant, that he was a master of matter rather\nthan a slave of matter.\n\nAnd thrust aside Jerry was, by a rough and naked foot, as harsh and\nunfeeling in its impact as an inanimate breaking sea on a beach-jut of\ninsensate rock.  He half-sprawled on the slippery deck, regained his\nbalance, and stood still and looked at the white-god who had treated him\nso cavalierly.  The meanness and unfairness had brought from Jerry no\nsnarling threat of retaliation, such as he would have offered Lerumie or\nany other black.  Nor in his brain was any thought of retaliation.  This\nwas no Lerumie.  This was a superior god, two-legged, white-skinned, like\nSkipper, like Mister Haggin and the couple of other superior gods he had\nknown.  Only did he know hurt, such as any child knows under the blow of\na thoughtless or unloving mother.\n\nIn the hurt was mingled a resentment.  He was keenly aware that there\nwere two sorts of roughness.  There was the kindly roughness of love,\nsuch as when Skipper gripped him by the jowl, shook him till his teeth\nrattled, and thrust him away with an unmistakable invitation to come back\nand be so shaken again.  Such roughness, to Jerry, was heaven.  In it was\nthe intimacy of contact with a beloved god who in such manner elected to\nexpress a reciprocal love.\n\nBut this roughness of Borckman was different.  It was the other kind of\nroughness in which resided no warm affection, no heart-touch of love.\nJerry did not quite understand, but he sensed the difference and\nresented, without expressing in action, the wrongness and unfairness of\nit.  So he stood, after regaining balance, and soberly regarded, in a\nvain effort to understand, the mate with a bottle-bottom inverted\nskyward, the mouth to his lips, the while his throat made gulping\ncontractions and noises.  And soberly he continued to regard the mate\nwhen he went aft and threatened to knock the \"Song of Songs\" and the rest\nof the Old Testament out of the black helmsman whose smile of teeth was\nas humbly gentle and placating as Jerry's had been when he made his\nappeal.\n\nLeaving this god as a god unliked and not understood, Jerry sadly trotted\nback to the companionway and yearned his head over the combing in the\ndirection in which he had seen Skipper disappear.  What bit at his\nconsciousness and was a painful incitement in it, was his desire to be\nwith Skipper who was not right, and who was in trouble.  He wanted\nSkipper.  He wanted to be with him, first and sharply, because he loved\nhim, and, second and dimly, because he might serve him.  And, wanting\nSkipper, in his helplessness and youngness in experience of the world, he\nwhimpered and cried his heart out across the companion combing, and was\ntoo clean and direct in his sorrow to be deflected by an outburst of\nanger against the niggers, on deck and below, who chuckled at him and\nderided him.\n\nFrom the crest of the combing to the cabin floor was seven feet.  He had,\nonly a few hours before, climbed the precipitous stairway; but it was\nimpossible, and he knew it, to descend the stairway.  And yet, at the\nlast, he dared it.  So compulsive was the prod of his heart to gain to\nSkipper at any cost, so clear was his comprehension that he could not\nclimb down the ladder head first, with no grippingness of legs and feet\nand muscles such as were possible in the ascent, that he did not attempt\nit.  He launched outward and down, in one magnificent and love-heroic\nleap.  He knew that he was violating a taboo of life, just as he knew he\nwas violating a taboo if he sprang into Meringe Lagoon where swam the\ndreadful crocodiles.  Great love is always capable of expressing itself\nin sacrifice and self-immolation.  And only for love, and for no lesser\nreason, could Jerry have made the leap.\n\nHe struck on his side and head.  The one impact knocked the breath out of\nhim; the other stunned him.  Even in his unconsciousness, lying on his\nside and quivering, he made rapid, spasmodic movements of his legs as if\nrunning for'ard to Skipper.  The boys looked on and laughed, and when he\nno longer quivered and churned his legs they continued to laugh.  Born in\nsavagery, having lived in savagery all their lives and known naught else,\ntheir sense of humour was correspondingly savage.  To them, the sight of\na stunned and possibly dead puppy was a side-splitting, ludicrous event.\n\nNot until the fourth minute ticked off did returning consciousness enable\nJerry to crawl to his feet and with wide-spread legs and swimming eyes\nadjust himself to the _Arangi's_ roll.  Yet with the first glimmerings of\nconsciousness persisted the one idea that he must gain to Skipper.\nBlacks?  In his anxiety and solicitude and love they did not count.  He\nignored the chuckling, grinning, girding black boys, who, but for the\nfact that he was under the terrible aegis of the big fella white marster,\nwould have delighted to kill and eat the puppy who, in the process of\ntraining, was proving a most capable nigger-chaser.  Without a turn of\nhead or roll of eye, aristocratically positing their non-existingness to\ntheir faces, he trotted for'ard along the cabin floor and into the\nstateroom where Skipper babbled maniacally in the bunk.\n\nJerry, who had never had malaria, did not understand.  But in his heart\nhe knew great trouble in that Skipper was in trouble.  Skipper did not\nrecognize him, even when he sprang into the bunk, walked across Skipper's\nheaving chest, and licked the acrid sweat of fever from Skipper's face.\nInstead, Skipper's wildly-thrashing arms brushed him away and flung him\nviolently against the side of the bunk.\n\nThis was roughness that was not love-roughness.  Nor was it the roughness\nof Borckman spurning him away with his foot.  It was part of Skipper's\ntrouble.  Jerry did not reason this conclusion.  But, and to the point,\nhe acted upon it as if he had reasoned it.  In truth, through inadequacy\nof one of the most adequate languages in the world, it can only be said\nthat Jerry _sensed_ the new difference of this roughness.\n\nHe sat up, just out of range of one restless, beating arm, yearned to\ncome closer and lick again the face of the god who knew him not, and who,\nhe knew, loved him well, and palpitatingly shared and suffered all\nSkipper's trouble.\n\n\"Eh, Clancey,\" Skipper babbled.  \"It's a fine job this day, and no better\ncrew to clean up after the dubs of motormen. . . . Number three jack,\nClancey.  Get under the for'ard end.\"  And, as the spectres of his\nnightmare metamorphosed: \"Hush, darling, talking to your dad like that,\ntelling him the combing of your sweet and golden hair.  As if I couldn't,\nthat have combed it these seven years--better than your mother, darling,\nbetter than your mother.  I'm the one gold-medal prize-winner in the\ncombing of his lovely daughter's lovely hair. . . . She's broken out!\nGive her the wheel aft there!  Jib and fore-topsail halyards!  Full and\nby, there!  A good full! . . . Ah, she takes it like the beauty fairy\nboat that she is upon the sea. . . I'll just lift that--sure, the limit.\nBlackey, when you pay as much to see my cards as I'm going to pay to see\nyours, you're going to see some cards, believe me!\"\n\nAnd so the farrago of unrelated memories continued to rise vocal on\nSkipper's lips to the heave of his body and the beat of his arms, while\nJerry, crouched against the side of the bunk mourned and mourned his\ngrief and inability to be of help.  All that was occurring was beyond\nhim.  He knew no more of poker hands than did he know of getting ships\nunder way, of clearing up surface car wrecks in New York, or of combing\nthe long yellow hair of a loved daughter in a Harlem flat.\n\n\"Both dead,\" Skipper said in a change of delirium.  He said it quietly,\nas if announcing the time of day, then wailed: \"But, oh, the bonnie,\nbonnie braids of all the golden hair of her!\"\n\nHe lay motionlessly for a space and sobbed out a breaking heart.  This\nwas Jerry's chance.  He crept inside the arm that tossed, snuggled\nagainst Skipper's side, laid his head on Skipper's shoulder, his cool\nnose barely touching Skipper's cheek, and felt the arm curl about him and\npress him closer.  The hand bent from the wrist and caressed him\nprotectingly, and the warm contact of his velvet body put a change in\nSkipper's sick dreams, for he began to mutter in cold and bitter\nominousness: \"Any nigger that as much as bats an eye at that puppy. . .\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nWhen, in half an hour, Van Horn's sweat culminated in profusion, it\nmarked the breaking of the malarial attack.  Great physical relief was\nhis, and the last mists of delirium ebbed from his brain.  But he was\nleft limply weak, and, after tossing off the blankets and recognizing\nJerry, he fell into a refreshing natural sleep.\n\nNot till two hours later did he awake and start to go on deck.  Half-way\nup the companion, he deposited Jerry on deck and went back to the\nstateroom for a forgotten bottle of quinine.  But he did not immediately\nreturn to Jerry.  The long drawer under Borckman's bunk caught his eye.\nThe wooden button that held it shut was gone, and it was far out and\nhanging at an angle that jammed it and prevented it from falling to the\nfloor.  The matter was serious.  There was little doubt in his mind, had\nthe drawer, in the midst of the squall of the previous night, fallen to\nthe floor, that no _Arangi_ and no soul of the eighty souls on board\nwould have been left.  For the drawer was filled with a heterogeneous\nmess of dynamite sticks, boxes of fulminating caps, coils of fuses, lead\nsinkers, iron tools, and many boxes of rifle, revolver and pistol\ncartridges.  He sorted and arranged the varied contents, and with a\nscrewdriver and a longer screw reattached the button.\n\nIn the meantime, Jerry was encountering new adventure not of the\npleasantest.  While waiting for Skipper to return, Jerry chanced to see\nthe wild-dog brazenly lying on deck a dozen feet from his lair in the\ntrade-boxes.  Instantly stiffly crouching, Jerry began to stalk.  Success\nseemed assured, for the wild-dog, with closed eyes, was apparently\nasleep.\n\nAnd at this moment the mate, two-legging it along the deck from for'ard\nin the direction of the bottle stored between the yam sacks, called,\n\"Jerry,\" in a remarkably husky voice.  Jerry flattened his filbert-shaped\nears and wagged his tail in acknowledgment, but advertised his intention\nof continuing to stalk his enemy.  And at sound of the mate's voice the\nwild-dog flung quick-opened eyes in Jerry's direction and flashed into\nhis burrow, where he immediately turned around, thrust his head out with\na show of teeth, and snarled triumphant defiance.\n\nBaulked of his quarry by the inconsiderateness of the mate, Jerry trotted\nback to the head of the companion to wait for Skipper.  But Borckman,\nwhose brain was well a-crawl by virtue of the many nips, clung to a petty\nidea after the fashion of drunken men.  Twice again, imperatively, he\ncalled Jerry to him, and twice again, with flattened ears of gentleness\nand wagging tail, Jerry good-naturedly expressed his disinclination.\nNext, he yearned his head over the coming and into the cabin after\nSkipper.\n\nBorckman remembered his first idea and continued to the bottle, which he\ngenerously inverted skyward.  But the second idea, petty as it was,\npersisted; and, after swaying and mumbling to himself for a time, after\nunseeingly making believe to study the crisp fresh breeze that filled the\n_Arangi's_ sails and slanted her deck, and, after sillily attempting on\nthe helmsman to portray eagle-like vigilance in his drink-swimming eyes,\nhe lurched amidships toward Jerry.\n\nJerry's first intimation of Borckman's arrival was a cruel and painful\nclutch on his flank and groin that made him cry out in pain and whirl\naround.  Next, as the mate had seen Skipper do in play, Jerry had his\njowls seized in a tooth-clattering shake that was absolutely different\nfrom the Skipper's rough love-shake.  His head and body were shaken, his\nteeth clattered painfully, and with the roughest of roughness he was\nflung part way down the slippery slope of deck.\n\nNow Jerry was a gentleman.  All the soul of courtesy was in him, for\nequals and superiors.  After all, even in an inferior like the wild-dog,\nhe did not consciously press an advantage very far--never extremely far.\nIn his stalking and rushing of the wild-dog, he had been more sound and\nfury than an overbearing bully.  But with a superior, with a two-legged\nwhite-god like Borckman, there was more a demand upon his control,\nrestraint, and inhibition of primitive promptings.  He did not want to\nplay with the mate a game that he ecstatically played with Skipper,\nbecause he had experienced no similar liking for the mate, two-legged\nwhite-god that he was.\n\nAnd still Jerry was all gentleness.  He came back in a feeble imitation\nrush of the whole-hearted rush that he had learned to make on Skipper.  He\nwas, in truth, acting, play-acting, attempting to do what he had no heart-\nprompting to do.  He made believe to play, and uttered simulated growls\nthat failed of the verity of simulation.\n\nHe bobbed his tail good-naturedly and friendly, and growled ferociously\nand friendly; but the keenness of the drunkenness of the mate discerned\nthe difference and aroused in him, vaguely, the intuition of difference,\nof play-acting, of cheating.  Jerry was cheating--out of his heart of\nconsideration.  Borckman drunkenly recognized the cheating without\ncrediting the heart of good behind it.  On the instant he was\nantagonistic.  Forgetting that he was only a brute, he posited that this\nwas no more than a brute with which he strove to play in the genial\ncomradely way that the Skipper played.\n\nRed war was inevitable--not first on Jerry's part, but on Borckman's\npart.  Borckman felt the abysmal urgings of the beast, as a beast, to\nprove himself master of this four-legged beast.  Jerry felt his jowl and\njaw clutched still more harshly and hardly, and, with increase of\nharshness and hardness, he was flung farther down the deck, which, on\naccount of its growing slant due to heavier gusts of wind, had become a\nsteep and slippery hill.\n\nHe came back, clawing frantically up the slope that gave him little\nfooting; and he came back, no longer with poorly attempted simulation of\nferocity, but impelled by the first flickerings of real ferocity.  He did\nnot know this.  If he thought at all, he was under the impression that he\nwas playing the game as he had played it with Skipper.  In short, he was\ntaking an interest in the game, although a radically different interest\nfrom what he had taken with Skipper.\n\nThis time his teeth flashed quicker and with deeper intent at the jowl-\nclutching hand, and, missing, he was seized and flung down the smooth\nincline harder and farther than before.  He was growing angry, as he\nclawed back, though he was not conscious of it.  But the mate, being a\nman, albeit a drunken one, sensed the change in Jerry's attack ere Jerry\ndreamed there was any change in it.  And not only did Borckman sense it,\nbut it served as a spur to drive him back into primitive beastliness, and\nto fight to master this puppy as a primitive man, under dissimilar\nprovocation, might have fought with the members of the first litter\nstolen from a wolf-den among the rocks.\n\nTrue, Jerry could trace as far back.  His ancient ancestors had been\nIrish wolf-hounds, and, long before that, the ancestors of the\nwolf-hounds had been wolves.  The note in Jerry's growls changed.  The\nunforgotten and ineffaceable past strummed the fibres of his throat.  His\nteeth flashed with fierce intent, in the desire of sinking as deep in the\nman's hand as passion could drive.  For Jerry by this time was all\npassion.  He had leaped back into the dark stark rawness of the early\nworld almost as swiftly as had Borckman.  And this time his teeth scored,\nripping the tender and sensitive and flesh of all the inside of the first\nand second joints of Borckman's right hand.  Jerry's teeth were needles\nthat stung, and Borckman, gaining the grasp on Jerry's jaw, flung him\naway and down so that almost he hit the _Arangi's_ tiny-rail ere his\nclawing feet stopped him.\n\nAnd Van Horn, having finished his rearrangement and repair of the\nexplosive-filled drawer under the mate's bunk, climbed up the companion\nsteps, saw the battle, paused, and quietly looked on.\n\nBut he looked across a million years, at two mad creatures who had\nslipped the leach of the generations and who were back in the darkness of\nspawning life ere dawning intelligence had modified the chemistry of such\nlife to softness of consideration.  What stirred in the brain crypts of\nBorckman's heredity, stirred in the brain-crypts of Jerry's heredity.\nTime had gone backward for both.  All the endeavour and achievement of\nthe ten thousand generations was not, and, as wolf-dog and wild-man, the\ncombat was between Jerry and the mate.  Neither saw Van Horn, who was\ninside the companionway hatch, his eyes level with the combing.\n\nTo Jerry, Borckman was now no more a god than was he himself a mere,\nsmooth-coated Irish terrier.  Both had forgotten the million years\nstamped into their heredity more feebly, less eraseably, than what had\nbeen stamped in prior to the million years.  Jerry did not know\ndrunkenness, but he did know unfairness; and it was with raging\nindignation that he knew it.  Borckman fumbled his next counter to\nJerry's attack, missed, and had both hands slashed in quick succession\nere he managed to send the puppy sliding.\n\nAnd still Jerry came back.  As any screaming creature of the jungle, he\nhysterically squalled his indignation.  But he made no whimper.  Nor did\nhe wince or cringe to the blows.  He bored straight in, striving, without\navoiding a blow, to beat and meet the blow with his teeth.  So hard was\nhe flung down the last time that his side smashed painfully against the\nrail, and Van Horn cried out:\n\n\"Cut that out, Borckman!  Leave the puppy alone!\"\n\nThe mate turned in the startle of surprise at being observed.  The sharp,\nauthoritative words of Van Horn were a call across the million years.\nBorckman's anger-convulsed face ludicrously attempted a sheepish,\ndeprecating grin, and he was just mumbling, \"We was only playing,\" when\nJerry arrived back, leaped in the air, and sank his teeth into the\noffending hand.\n\nBorckman immediately and insanely went back across the million years.  An\nattempted kick got his ankle scored for his pains.  He gibbered his own\nrage and hurt, and, stooping, dealt Jerry a tremendous blow alongside the\nhead and neck.  Being in mid-leap when he received the blow Jerry was\ntwistingly somersaulted sidewise before he struck the deck on his back.\nAs swiftly as he could scramble to footing and charge, he returned to the\nattack, but was checked by Skipper's:\n\n\"Jerry!  Stop it!  Come here!\"\n\nHe obeyed, but only by prodigious effort, his neck bristling and his lips\nwrithing clear of his teeth as he passed the mate.  For the first time\nthere was a whimper in his throat; but it was not the whimper of fear,\nnor of pain, but of outrage, and of desire to continue the battle which\nhe struggled to control at Skipper's behest.\n\nStepping out on deck, Skipper picked him up and patted and soothed him\nthe while he expressed his mind to the mate.\n\n\"Borckman, you ought to be ashamed.  You ought to be shot or have your\nblock knocked off for this.  A puppy, a little puppy scarcely weaned.  For\ntwo cents I'd give you what-for myself.  The idea of it.  A little puppy,\na weanling little puppy.  Glad your hands are ripped.  You deserved it.\nHope you get blood-poisoning in them.  Besides, you're drunk.  Go below\nand turn in, and don't you dare come on deck until you're sober.  Savve?\"\n\nAnd Jerry, far-journeyer across life and across the history of all life\nthat goes to make the world, strugglingly mastering the abysmal slime of\nthe prehistoric with the love that had come into existence and had become\nwarp and woof of him in far later time, his wrath of ancientness still\nfaintly reverberating in his throat like the rumblings of a passing\nthunder-storm, knew, in the wide warm ways of feeling, the augustness and\nrighteousness of Skipper.  Skipper was in truth a god who did right, who\nwas fair, who protected, and who imperiously commanded this other and\nlesser god that slunk away before his anger.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nJerry and Skipper shared the long afternoon-watch together, the latter\nbeing guilty of recurrent chuckles and exclamations such as: \"Gott-fer-\ndang, Jerry, believe _me_, you're some fighter and all dog\"; or, \"You're\na proper man's dog, you are, a lion dog.  I bet the lion don't live that\ncould get your goat.\"\n\nAnd Jerry, understanding none of the words, with the exception of his own\nname, nevertheless knew that the sounds made by Skipper were broad of\npraise and warm of love.  And when Skipper stooped and rubbed his ears,\nor received a rose-kiss on extended fingers, or caught him up in his\narms, Jerry's heart was nigh to bursting.  For what greater ecstasy can\nbe the portion of any creature than that it be loved by a god?  This was\njust precisely Jerry's ecstasy.  This was a god, a tangible, real, three-\ndimensioned god, who went about and ruled his world in a loin-cloth and\non two bare legs, and who loved him with crooning noises in throat and\nmouth and with two wide-spread arms that folded him in.\n\nAt four o'clock, measuring a glance at the afternoon sun and gauging the\nspeed of the _Arangi_ through the water in relation to the closeness of\nSu'u, Van Horn went below and roughly shook the mate awake.  Until both\nreturned, Jerry held the deck alone.  But for the fact that the white-\ngods were there below and were certain to be back at any moment, not many\nmoments would Jerry have held the deck, for every lessened mile between\nthe return boys and Malaita contributed a rising of their spirits, and\nunder the imminence of their old-time independence, Lerumie, as an\ninstance of many of them, with strong gustatory sensations and a positive\ndrooling at the mouth, regarded Jerry in terms of food and vengeance that\nwere identical.\n\nFlat-hauled on the crisp breeze, the _Arangi_ closed in rapidly with the\nland.  Jerry peered through the barbed wire, sniffing the air, Skipper\nbeside him and giving orders to the mate and helmsman.  The heap of trade-\nboxes was now unlashed, and the boys began opening and shutting them.\nWhat gave them particular delight was the ringing of the bell with which\neach box was equipped and which rang whenever a lid was raised.  Their\npleasure in the toy-like contrivance was that of children, and each went\nback again and again to unlock his own box and make the bell ring.\n\nFifteen of the boys were to be landed at Su'u and with wild\ngesticulations and cries they began to recognize and point out the\ninfinitesimal details of the landfall of the only spot they had known on\nearth prior to the day, three years before, when they had been sold into\nslavery by their fathers, uncles, and chiefs.\n\nA narrow neck of water, scarcely a hundred yards across, gave entrance to\na long and tiny bay.  The shore was massed with mangroves and dense,\ntropical vegetation.  There was no sign of houses nor of human occupancy,\nalthough Van Horn, staring at the dense jungle so close at hand, knew as\na matter of course that scores, and perhaps hundreds, of pairs of human\neyes were looking at him.\n\n\"Smell 'm, Jerry, smell 'm,\" he encouraged.\n\nAnd Jerry's hair bristled as he barked at the mangrove wall, for truly\nhis keen scent informed him of lurking niggers.\n\n\"If I could smell like him,\" the captain said to the mate, \"there\nwouldn't be any risk at all of my ever losing my head.\"\n\nBut Borckman made no reply and sullenly went about his work.  There was\nlittle wind in the bay, and the _Arangi_ slowly forged in and dropped\nanchor in thirty fathoms.  So steep was the slope of the harbour bed from\nthe beach that even in such excessive depth the _Arangi's_ stern swung in\nwithin a hundred feet of the mangroves.\n\nVan Horn continued to cast anxious glances at the wooded shore.  For Su'u\nhad an evil name.  Since the schooner _Fair_ _Hathaway_, recruiting\nlabour for the Queensland plantations, had been captured by the natives\nand all hands slain fifteen years before, no vessel, with the exception\nof the _Arangi_, had dared to venture into Su'u.  And most white men\ncondemned Van Horn's recklessness for so venturing.\n\nFar up the mountains, that towered many thousands of feet into the trade-\nwind clouds, arose many signal smokes that advertised the coming of the\nvessel.  Far and near, the _Arangi's_ presence was known; yet from the\njungle so near at hand only shrieks of parrots and chatterings of\ncockatoos could be heard.\n\nThe whaleboat, manned with six of the boat's crew, was drawn alongside,\nand the fifteen Su'u boys and their boxes were loaded in.  Under the\ncanvas flaps along the thwarts, ready to hand for the rowers, were laid\nfive of the Lee-Enfields.  On deck, another of the boat's crew, rifle in\nhand, guarded the remaining weapons.  Borckman had brought up his own\nrifle to be ready for instant use.  Van Horn's rifle lay handy in the\nstern sheets where he stood near Tambi, who steered with a long sweep.\nJerry raised a low whine and yearned over the rail after Skipper, who\nyielded and lifted him down.\n\nThe place of danger was in the boat; for there was little likelihood, at\nthis particular time, of a rising of the return boys on the _Arangi_.\nBeing of Somo, No-ola, Langa-Langa, and far Malu they were in wholesome\nfear, did they lose the protection of their white masters, of being eaten\nby the Su'u folk, just as the Su'u boys would have feared being eaten by\nthe Somo and Langa-Langa and No-ola folk.\n\nWhat increased the danger of the boat was the absence of a covering boat.\nThe invariable custom of the larger recruiting vessels was to send two\nboats on any shore errand.  While one landed on the beach, the other lay\noff a short distance to cover the retreat of the shore party, if trouble\nbroke out.  Too small to carry one boat on deck, the _Arangi_ could not\nconveniently tow two astern; so Van Horn, who was the most daring of the\nrecruiters, lacked this essential safeguard.\n\nTambi, under Van Horn's low-uttered commands, steered a parallel course\nalong the shore.  Where the mangroves ceased, and where high ground and a\nbeaten runway came down to the water's edge, Van Horn motioned the rowers\nto back water and lay on their oars.  High palms and lofty, wide-branched\ntrees rose above the jungle at this spot, and the runway showed like the\nentrance of a tunnel into the dense, green wall of tropical vegetation.\n\nVan Horn, regarding the shore for some sign of life, lighted a cigar and\nput one hand to the waist-line of his loin-cloth to reassure himself of\nthe presence of the stick of dynamite that was tucked between the loin-\ncloth and his skin.  The lighted cigar was for the purpose, if emergency\narose, of igniting the fuse of the dynamite.  And the fuse was so short,\nwith its end split to accommodate the inserted head of a safety match,\nthat between the time of touching it off with the live cigar to the time\nof the explosion not more than three seconds could elapse.  This required\nquick cool work on Van Horn's part, in case need arose.  In three seconds\nhe would have to light the fuse and throw the sputtering stick with\ndirected aim to its objective.  However, he did not expect to use it, and\nhad it ready merely as a precautionary measure.\n\nFive minutes passed, and the silence of the shore remained profound.\nJerry sniffed Skipper's bare leg as if to assure him that he was beside\nhim no matter what threatened from the hostile silence of the land, then\nstood up with his forepaws on the gunwale and continued to sniff eagerly\nand audibly, to prick his neck hair, and to utter low growls.\n\n\"They're there, all right,\" Skipper confided to him; and Jerry, with a\nsideward glance of smiling eyes, with a bobbing of his tail and a quick\nlove-flattening of his ears, turned his nose shoreward again and resumed\nhis reading of the jungle tale that was wafted to him on the light fans\nof the stifling and almost stagnant air.\n\n\"Hey!\" Van Horn suddenly shouted.  \"Hey, you fella boy stick 'm head out\nbelong you!\"\n\nAs if in a transformation scene, the apparently tenantless jungle spawned\ninto life.  On the instant a hundred stark savages appeared.  They broke\nforth everywhere from the vegetation.  All were armed, some with Snider\nrifles and ancient horse pistols, others with bows and arrows, with long\nthrowing spears, with war-clubs, and with long-handled tomahawks.  In a\nflash, one of them leaped into the sunlight in the open space where\nrunway and water met.  Save for decorations, he was naked as Adam before\nthe Fall.  A solitary white feather uprose from his kinky, glossy, black\nhair.  A polished bodkin of white petrified shell, with sharp-pointed\nends, thrust through a hole in the partition of his nostrils, extended\nfive inches across his face.  About his neck, from a cord of twisted\ncoconut sennit, hung an ivory-white necklace of wild-boar's tusks.  A\ngarter of white cowrie shells encircled one leg just below the knee.  A\nflaming scarlet flower was coquettishly stuck over one ear, and through a\nhole in the other ear was threaded a pig's tail so recently severed that\nit still bled.\n\nAs this dandy of Melanesia leaped into the sunshine, the Snider rifle in\nhis hands came into position, aimed from his hip, the generous muzzle\nbearing directly on Van Horn.  No less quick was Van Horn.  With equal\nspeed he had snatched his rifle and brought it to bear from his hip.  So\nthey stood and faced each other, death in their finger-tips, forty feet\napart.  The million years between barbarism and civilization also yawned\nbetween them across that narrow gulf of forty feet.  The hardest thing\nfor modern, evolved man to do is to forget his ancient training.  Easiest\nof all things is it for him to forget his modernity and slip back across\ntime to the howling ages.  A lie in the teeth, a blow in the face, a love-\nthrust of jealousy to the heart, in a fraction of an instant can turn a\ntwentieth-century philosopher into an ape-like arborean pounding his\nchest, gnashing his teeth, and seeing red.\n\nSo Van Horn.  But with a difference.  He straddled time.  He was at one\nand the same instant all modern, all imminently primitive, capable of\nfighting in redness of tooth and claw, desirous of remaining modern for\nas long as he could with his will master the study of ebon black of skin\nand dazzling white of decoration that confronted him.\n\nA long ten seconds of silence endured.  Even Jerry, he knew not why,\nstilled the growl in his throat.  Five score of head-hunting cannibals on\nthe fringe of the jungle, fifteen Su'u return blacks in the boat, seven\nblack boat's crew, and a solitary white man with a cigar in his mouth, a\nrifle at his hip, and an Irish terrier bristling against his bare calf,\nkept the solemn pact of those ten seconds, and no one of them knew or\nguessed what the outcome would be.\n\nOne of the return boys, in the bow of the whaleboat, made the peace sign\nwith his palm extended outward and weaponless, and began to chirp in the\nunknown Su'u dialect.  Van Horn held his aim and waited.  The dandy\nlowered his Snider, and breath came more easily to the chests of all who\ncomposed the picture.\n\n\"Me good fella boy,\" the dandy piped, half bird-like and half elf.\n\n\"You big fella fool too much,\" Van Horn retorted harshly, dropping his\ngun into the stern-sheets, motioning to rowers and steersman to turn the\nboat around, and puffing his cigar as carelessly casual as if, the moment\nbefore, life and death had not been the debate.\n\n\"My word,\" he went on with fine irritable assumption.  \"What name you\nstick 'm gun along me?  Me no kai-kai (eat) along you.  Me kai-kai along\nyou, stomach belong me walk about.  You kai-kai along me, stomach belong\nyou walk about.  You no like 'm kai-kai Su'u boy belong along you?  Su'u\nboy belong you all the same brother along you.  Long time before, three\nmonsoon before, me speak 'm true speak.  Me say three monsoon boy come\nback.  My word, three monsoon finish, boy stop along me come back.\"\n\nBy this time the boat had swung around, reversing bow and stern, Van Horn\npivoting so as to face the Snider-armed dandy.  At another signal from\nVan Horn the rowers backed water and forced the boat, stern in, up to the\nsolid ground of the runway.  And each rower, his oar in position in case\nof attack, privily felt under the canvas flap to make sure of the exact\nlocation of his concealed Lee-Enfield.\n\n\"All right boy belong you walk about?\" Van Horn queried of the dandy, who\nsignified the affirmative in the Solomon Islands fashion by half-closing\nhis eyes and nodding his head upward, in a queer, perky way;\n\n\"No kai-kai 'm Su'u fella boy suppose walk about along you?\"\n\n\"No fear,\" the dandy answered.  \"Suppose 'm Su'u fella boy, all right.\nSuppose 'm no fella Su'u boy, my word, big trouble.  Ishikola, big fella\nblack marster along this place, him talk 'm me talk along you.  Him say\nany amount bad fella boy stop 'm along bush.  Him say big fella white\nmarster no walk about.  Him say jolly good big fella white marster stop\n'm along ship.\"\n\nVan Horn nodded in an off-hand way, as if the information were of little\nvalue, although he knew that for this time Su'u would furnish him no\nfresh recruits.  One at a time, compelling the others to remain in their\nplaces, he directed the return boys astern and ashore.  It was Solomon\nIslands tactics.  Crowding was dangerous.  Never could the blacks be\nrisked to confusion in numbers.  And Van Horn, smoking his cigar in\nlordly indifferent fashion, kept his apparently uninterested eyes glued\nto each boy who made his way aft, box on shoulder, and stepped out on the\nland.  One by one they disappeared into the runway tunnel, and when the\nlast was ashore he ordered the boat back to the ship.\n\n\"Nothing doing here this trip,\" he told the mate.  \"We'll up hook and out\nin the morning.\"\n\nThe quick tropic twilight swiftly blent day and darkness.  Overhead all\nstars were out.  No faintest breath of air moved over the water, and the\nhumid heat beaded the faces and bodies of both men with profuse sweat.\nThey ate their deck-spread supper languidly and ever and anon used their\nforearms to wipe the stinging sweat from their eyes.\n\n\"Why a man should come to the Solomons--beastly hole,\" the mate\ncomplained.\n\n\"Or stay on,\" the captain rejoined.\n\n\"I'm too rotten with fever,\" the mate grumbled.  \"I'd die if I left.\nRemember, I tried it two years ago.  It takes the cold weather to bring\nout the fever.  I arrived in Sydney on my back.  They had to take me to\nhospital in an ambulance.  I got worse and worse.  The doctors told me\nthe only thing to do was to head back where I got the fever.  If I did I\nmight live a long time.  If I hung on in Sydney it meant a quick finish.\nThey packed me on board in another ambulance.  And that's all I saw of\nAustralia for my holiday.  I don't want to stay in the Solomons.  It's\nplain hell.  But I got to, or croak.\"\n\nHe rolled, at a rough estimate, thirty grains of quinine in a cigarette\npaper, regarded the result sourly for a moment, then swallowed it at a\ngulp.  This reminded Van Horn, who reached for the bottle and took a\nsimilar dose.\n\n\"Better put up a covering cloth,\" he suggested.\n\nBorckman directed several of the boat's crew in the rigging up of a thin\ntarpaulin, like a curtain along the shore side of the _Arangi_.  This was\na precaution against any bushwhacking bullet from the mangroves only a\nhundred feet away.\n\nVan Horn sent Tambi below to bring up the small phonograph and run off\nthe dozen or so scratchy, screechy records that had already been under\nthe needle a thousand times.  Between records, Van Horn recollected the\ngirl, and had her haled out of her dark hole in the lazarette to listen\nto the music.  She obeyed in fear, apprehensive that her time had come.\nShe looked dumbly at the big fella white master, her eyes large with\nfright; nor did the trembling of her body cease for a long time after he\nhad made her lie down.  The phonograph meant nothing to her.  She knew\nonly fear--fear of this terrible white man that she was certain was\ndestined to eat her.\n\nJerry left the caressing hand of Skipper for a moment to go over and\nsniff her.  This was an act of duty.  He was identifying her once again.\nNo matter what happened, no matter what months or years might elapse, he\nwould know her again and for ever know her again.  He returned to the\nfree hand of Skipper that resumed its caressing.  The other hand held the\ncigar which he was smoking.\n\nThe wet sultry heat grew more oppressive.  The air was nauseous with the\ndank mucky odour that cooked out of the mangrove swamp.  Rowelled by the\nsqueaky music to recollection of old-world ports and places, Borckman lay\non his face on the hot planking, beat a tattoo with his naked toes, and\ngutturally muttered an unending monologue of curses.  But Van Horn, with\nJerry panting under his hand, placidly and philosophically continued to\nsmoke, lighting a fresh cigar when the first gave out.\n\nHe roused abruptly at the faint wash of paddles which he was the first on\nboard to hear.  In fact, it was Jerry's low growl and neck-rippling of\nhair that had keyed Van Horn to hear.  Pulling the stick of dynamite out\nfrom the twist of his loin cloth and glancing at the cigar to be certain\nit was alight, he rose to his feet with leisurely swiftness and with\nleisurely swiftness gained the rail.\n\n\"What name belong you?\" was his challenge to the dark.\n\n\"Me fella Ishikola,\" came the answer in the quavering falsetto of age.\n\nVan Horn, before speaking again, loosened his automatic pistol half out\nof its holster, and slipped the holster around from his hip till it\nrested on his groin conveniently close to his hand.\n\n\"How many fella boy stop along you?\" he demanded.\n\n\"One fella ten-boy altogether he stop,\" came the aged voice.\n\n\"Come alongside then.\"  Without turning his head, his right hand\nunconsciously dropping close to the butt of the automatic, Van Horn\ncommanded: \"You fella Tambi.  Fetch 'm lantern.  No fetch 'm this place.\nFetch 'm aft along mizzen rigging and look sharp eye belong you.\"\n\nTambi obeyed, exposing the lantern twenty feet away from where his\ncaptain stood.  This gave Van Horn the advantage over the approaching\ncanoe-men, for the lantern, suspended through the barbed wire across the\nrail and well down, would clearly illuminate the occupants of the canoe\nwhile he was left in semi-darkness and shadow.\n\n\"Washee-washee!\" he urged peremptorily, while those in the invisible\ncanoe still hesitated.\n\nCame the sound of paddles, and, next, emerging into the lantern's area of\nlight, the high, black bow of a war canoe, curved like a gondola, inlaid\nwith silvery-glistening mother-of-pearl; the long lean length of the\ncanoe which was without outrigger; the shining eyes and the black-shining\nbodies of the stark blacks who knelt in the bottom and paddled; Ishikola,\nthe old chief, squatting amidships and not paddling, an unlighted, empty-\nbowled, short-stemmed clay pipe upside-down between his toothless gums;\nand, in the stern, as coxswain, the dandy, all nakedness of blackness,\nall whiteness of decoration, save for the pig's tail in one ear and the\nscarlet hibiscus that still flamed over the other ear.\n\nLess than ten blacks had been known to rush a blackbirder officered by no\nmore than two white men, and Van Horn's hand closed on the butt of his\nautomatic, although he did not pull it clear of the holster, and\nalthough, with his left hand, he directed the cigar to his mouth and\npuffed it lively alight.\n\n\"Hello, Ishikola, you blooming old blighter,\" was Van Horn's greeting to\nthe old chief, as the dandy, with a pry of his steering-paddle against\nthe side of the canoe and part under its bottom, brought the dug-out\nbroadside-on to the _Arangi_ so that the sides of both crafts touched.\n\nIshikola smiled upward in the lantern light.  He smiled with his right\neye, which was all he had, the left having been destroyed by an arrow in\na youthful jungle-skirmish.\n\n\"My word!\" he greeted back.  \"Long time you no stop eye belong me.\"\n\nVan Horn joked him in understandable terms about the latest wives he had\nadded to his harem and what price he had paid for them in pigs.\n\n\"My word,\" he concluded, \"you rich fella too much together.\"\n\n\"Me like 'm come on board gammon along you,\" Ishikola meekly suggested.\n\n\"My word, night he stop,\" the captain objected, then added, as a\nconcession against the known rule that visitors were not permitted aboard\nafter nightfall: \"You come on board, boy stop 'm along boat.\"\n\nVan Horn gallantly helped the old man to clamber to the rail, straddle\nthe barbed wire, and gain the deck.  Ishikola was a dirty old savage.  One\nof his tambos (tambo being beche-de-mer and Melanesian for \"taboo\") was\nthat water unavoidable must never touch his skin.  He who lived by the\nsalt sea, in a land of tropic downpour, religiously shunned contact with\nwater.  He never went swimming or wading, and always fled to shelter from\na shower.  Not that this was true of the rest of his tribe.  It was the\npeculiar tambo laid upon him by the devil-devil doctors.  Other tribesmen\nthe devil-devil doctors tabooed against eating shark, or handling turtle,\nor contacting with crocodiles or the fossil remains of crocodiles, or\nfrom ever being smirched by the profanity of a woman's touch or of a\nwoman's shadow cast across the path.\n\nSo Ishikola, whose tambo was water, was crusted with the filth of years.\nHe was sealed like a leper, and, weazen-faced and age-shrunken, he\nhobbled horribly from an ancient spear-thrust to the thigh that twisted\nhis torso droopingly out of the vertical.  But his one eye gleamed\nbrightly and wickedly, and Van Horn knew that it observed as much as did\nboth his own eyes.\n\nVan Horn shook hands with him--an honour he accorded only chiefs--and\nmotioned him to squat down on deck on his hams close to the fear-struck\ngirl, who began trembling again at recollection of having once heard\nIshikola offer five twenties of drinking coconuts for the meat of her for\na dinner.\n\nJerry needs must sniff, for future identification purposes, this\ngraceless, limping, naked, one-eyed old man.  And, when he had sniffed\nand registered the particular odour, Jerry must growl intimidatingly and\nwin a quick eye-glance of approval from Skipper.\n\n\"My word, good fella kai-kai dog,\" said Ishikola.  \"Me give 'm\nhalf-fathom shell money that fella dog.\"\n\nFor a mere puppy this offer was generous, because half a fathom of shell-\nmoney, strung on a thread of twisted coconut fibres, was equivalent in\ncash to half a sovereign in English currency, to two dollars and a half\nin American, or, in live-pig currency, to half of a fair-sized fat pig.\n\n\"One fathom shell-money that fella dog,\" Van Horn countered, in his heart\nknowing that he would not sell Jerry for a hundred fathoms, or for any\nfabulous price from any black, but in his head offering so small a price\nover par as not to arouse suspicion among the blacks as to how highly he\nreally valued the golden-coated son of Biddy and Terrence.\n\nIshikola next averred that the girl had grown much thinner, and that he,\nas a practical judge of meat, did not feel justified this time in bidding\nmore than three twenty-strings of drinking coconuts.\n\nAfter these amenities, the white master and the black talked of many\nthings, the one bluffing with the white-man's superiority of intellect\nand knowledge, the other feeling and guessing, primitive statesman that\nhe was, in an effort to ascertain the balance of human and political\nforces that bore upon his Su'u territory, ten miles square, bounded by\nthe sea and by landward lines of an inter-tribal warfare that was older\nthan the oldest Su'u myth.  Eternally, heads had been taken and bodies\neaten, now on one side, now on the other, by the temporarily victorious\ntribes.  The boundaries had remained the same.  Ishikola, in crude beche-\nde-mer, tried to learn the Solomon Islands general situation in relation\nto Su'u, and Van Horn was not above playing the unfair diplomatic game as\nit is unfairly played in all the chancellories of the world powers.\n\n\"My word,\" Van Horn concluded; \"you bad fella too much along this place.\nToo many heads you fella take; too much kai-kai long pig along you.\"\n(Long pig, meaning barbecued human flesh.)\n\n\"What name, long time black fella belong Su'u take 'm heads, kai-kai\nalong long pig?\" Ishikola countered.\n\n\"My word,\" Van Horn came back, \"too much along this place.  Bime by,\nclose up, big fella warship stop 'm along Su'u, knock seven balls outa\nSu'u.\"\n\n\"What name him big fella warship stop 'm along Solomons?\" Ishikola\ndemanded.\n\n\"Big fella _Cambrian_, him fella name belong ship,\" Van Horn lied, too\nwell aware that no British cruiser had been in the Solomons for the past\ntwo years.\n\nThe conversation was becoming rather a farcical dissertation upon the\nrelations that should obtain between states, irrespective of size, when\nit was broken off by a cry from Tambi, who, with another lantern hanging\noverside at the end of his arm had made a discovery.\n\n\"Skipper, gun he stop along canoe!\" was his cry.\n\nVan Horn, with a leap, was at the rail and peering down over the barbed\nwire.  Ishikola, despite his twisted body, was only seconds behind him.\n\n\"What name that fella gun stop 'm along bottom?\" Van Horn indignantly\ndemanded.\n\nThe dandy, in the stern, with a careless look upward, tried with his foot\nto shove over the green leaves so as to cover the out-jutting butts of\nseveral rifles, but made the matter worse by exposing them more fully.  He\nbent to rake the leaves over with his hand, but sat swiftly upright when\nVan Horn roared at him:\n\n\"Stand clear!  Keep 'm fella hand belong you long way big bit!\"\n\nVan Horn turned on Ishikola, and simulated wrath which he did not feel\nagainst the ancient and ever-recurrent trick.\n\n\"What name you come alongside, gun he stop along canoe belong you?\" he\ndemanded.\n\nThe old salt-water chief rolled his one eye and blinked a fair simulation\nof stupidity and innocence.\n\n\"My word, me cross along you too much,\" Van Horn continued.  \"Ishikola,\nyou plenty bad fella boy.  You get 'm to hell overside.\"\n\nThe old fellow limped across the deck with more agility than he had\ndisplayed coming aboard, straddled the barbed wire without assistance,\nand without assistance dropped into the canoe, cleverly receiving his\nweight on his uninjured leg.  He blinked up for forgiveness and in\nreassertion of innocence.  Van Horn turned his face aside to hide a grin,\nand then grinned outright when the old rascal, showing his empty pipe,\nwheedled up:\n\n\"Suppose 'm five stick tobacco you give 'm along me?\"\n\nWhile Borckman went below for the tobacco, Van Horn orated to Ishikola on\nthe sacred solemnity of truth and promises.  Next, he leaned across the\nbarbed wire and handed down the five sticks of tobacco.\n\n\"My word,\" he threatened.  \"Somo day, Ishikola, I finish along you\naltogether.  You no good friend stop along salt-water.  You big fool stop\nalong bush.\"\n\nWhen Ishikola attempted protest, he shut him off with, \"My word, you\ngammon along me too much.\"\n\nStill the canoe lingered.  The dandy's toe strayed privily to feel out\nthe butts of the Sniders under the green leaves, and Ishikola was loth to\ndepart.\n\n\"Washee-washee!\" Van Horn cried with imperative suddenness.\n\nThe paddlers, without command from chief or dandy, involuntarily obeyed,\nand with deep, strong strokes sent the canoe into the encircling\ndarkness.  Just as quickly Van Horn changed his position on deck to the\ntune of a dozen yards, so that no hazarded bullet might reach him.  He\ncrouched low and listened to the wash of paddles fade away in the\ndistance.\n\n\"All right, you fella Tambi,\" he ordered quietly.  \"Make 'm music he\nfella walk about.\"\n\nAnd while \"Red Wing\" screeched its cheap and pretty rhythm, he reclined\nelbow on deck, smoked his cigar, and gathered Jerry into caressing\ninclosure.\n\nAs he smoked he watched the abrupt misting of the stars by a rain-squall\nthat made to windward or to where windward might vaguely be configured.\nWhile he gauged the minutes ere he must order Tambi below with the\nphonograph and records, he noted the bush-girl gazing at him in dumb\nfear.  He nodded consent with half-closed eyes and up-tilting face,\nclinching his consent with a wave of hand toward the companionway.  She\nobeyed as a beaten dog, spirit-broken, might have obeyed, dragging\nherself to her feet, trembling afresh, and with backward glances of her\nperpetual terror of the big white master that she was convinced would\nsome day eat her.  In such fashion, stabbing Van Horn to the heart\nbecause of his inability to convey his kindness to her across the abyss\nof the ages that separated them, she slunk away to the companionway and\ncrawled down it feet-first like some enormous, large-headed worm.\n\nAfter he had sent Tambi to follow her with the precious phonograph, Van\nHorn continued to smoke on while the sharp, needle-like spray of the rain\nimpacted soothingly on his heated body.\n\nOnly for five minutes did the rain descend.  Then, as the stars drifted\nback in the sky, the smell of steam seemed to stench forth from deck and\nmangrove swamp, and the suffocating heat wrapped all about.\n\nVan Horn knew better, but ill health, save for fever, had never concerned\nhim; so he did not bother for a blanket to shelter him.\n\n\"Yours the first watch,\" he told Borckman.  \"I'll have her under way in\nthe morning, before I call you.\"\n\nHe tucked his head on the biceps of his right arm, with the hollow of the\nleft snuggling Jerry in against his chest, and dozed off to sleep.\n\nAnd thus adventuring, white men and indigenous black men from day to day\nlived life in the Solomons, bickering and trafficking, the whites\nstriving to maintain their heads on their shoulders, the blacks striving,\nno less single-heartedly, to remove the whites' heads from their\nshoulders and at the same time to keep their own anatomies intact.\n\nAnd Jerry, who knew only the world of Meringe Lagoon, learning that these\nnew worlds of the ship _Arangi_ and of the island of Malaita were\nessentially the same, regarded the perpetual game between the white and\nthe black with some slight sort of understanding.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nDaylight saw the _Arangi_ under way, her sails drooping heavily in the\ndead air while the boat's crew toiled at the oars of the whaleboat to tow\nher out through the narrow entrance.  Once, when the ketch, swerved by\nsome vagrant current, came close to the break of the shore-surf, the\nblacks on board drew toward one another in apprehension akin to that of\nstartled sheep in a fold when a wild woods marauder howls outside.  Nor\nwas there any need for Van Horn's shout to the whaleboat: \"Washee-washee!\nDamn your hides!\"  The boat's crew lifted themselves clear of the thwarts\nas they threw all their weight into each stroke.  They knew what dire\nfate was certain if ever the sea-washed coral rock gripped the _Arangi's_\nkeel.  And they knew fear precisely of the same sort as that of the fear-\nstruck girl below in the lazarette.  In the past more than one\nLanga-Langa and Somo boy had gone to make a Su'u feast day, just as Su'u\nboys, on occasion, had similarly served feasts at Langa-Langa and at\nSomo.\n\n\"My word,\" Tambi, at the wheel, addressed Van Horn as the period of\ntension passed and the _Arangi_ went clear.  \"Brother belong my father,\nlong time before he come boat's crew along this place.  Big fella\nschooner brother belong my father he come along.  All finish this place\nSu'u.  Brother belong my father Su'u boys kai-kai along him altogether.\"\n\nVan Horn recollected the _Fair_ _Hathaway_ of fifteen years before,\nlooted and burned by the people of Su'u after all hands had been killed.\nTruly, the Solomons at this beginning of the twentieth century were\nsavage, and truly, of the Solomons, this great island of Malaita was\nsavagest of all.\n\nHe cast his eyes speculatively up the slopes of the island to the\nseaman's landmark, Mount Kolorat, green-forested to its cloud-capped\nsummit four thousand feet in the air.  Even as he looked, thin\nsmoke-columns were rising along the slopes and lesser peaks, and more\nwere beginning to rise.\n\n\"My word,\" Tambi grinned.  \"Plenty boy stop 'm bush lookout along you eye\nbelong him.\"\n\nVan Horn smiled understandingly.  He knew, by the ancient telegraphy of\nsmoke-signalling, the message was being conveyed from village to village\nand tribe to tribe that a labour-recruiter was on the leeward coast.\n\nAll morning, under a brisk beam wind which had sprung up with the rising\nof the sun, the _Arangi_ flew north, her course continuously advertised\nby the increasing smoke-talk that gossiped along the green summits.  At\nhigh noon, with Van Horn, ever-attended by Jerry, standing for'ard and\nconning, the _Arangi_ headed into the wind to thread the passage between\ntwo palm-tufted islets.  There was need for conning.  Coral patches\nuprose everywhere from the turquoise depths, running the gamut of green\nfrom deepest jade to palest tourmaline, over which the sea filtered\nchanging shades, creamed lazily, or burst into white fountains of sun-\nflashed spray.\n\nThe smoke columns along the heights became garrulous, and long before the\n_Arangi_ was through the passage the entire leeward coast, from the salt-\nwater men of the shore to the remotest bush villagers, knew that the\nlabour recruiter was going in to Langa-Langa.  As the lagoon, formed by\nthe chain of islets lying off shore, opened out, Jerry began to smell the\nreef-villages.  Canoes, many canoes, urged by paddles or sailed before\nthe wind by the weight of the freshening South East trade on spread\nfronds of coconut palms, moved across the smooth surface of the lagoon.\nJerry barked intimidatingly at those that came closest, bristling his\nneck and making a ferocious simulation of an efficient protector of the\nwhite god who stood beside him.  And after each such warning, he would\nsoftly dab his cool damp muzzle against the sun-heated skin of Skipper's\nleg.\n\nOnce inside the lagoon, the _Arangi_ filled away with the wind a-beam.  At\nthe end of a swift half-mile she rounded to, with head-sails trimming\ndown and with a great flapping of main and mizzen, and dropped anchor in\nfifty feet of water so clear that every huge fluted clamshell was visible\non the coral floor.  The whaleboat was not necessary to put the Langa-\nLanga return boys ashore.  Hundreds of canoes lay twenty deep along both\nsides of the _Arangi_, and each boy, with his box and bell, was clamoured\nfor by scores of relatives and friends.\n\nIn such height of excitement, Van Horn permitted no one on board.\nMelanesians, unlike cattle, are as prone to stampede to attack as to\nretreat.  Two of the boat's crew stood beside the Lee-Enfields on the\nskylight.  Borckman, with half the boat's crew, went about the ship's\nwork.  Van Horn, Jerry at his heels, careful that no one should get at\nhis back, superintended the departure of the Langa-Langa returns and kept\na vigilant eye on the remaining half of the boat's crew that guarded the\nbarbed-wire rails.  And each Somo boy sat on his trade-box to prevent it\nfrom being tossed into the waiting canoes by some Langa-Langa boy.\n\nIn half an hour the riot departed ashore.  Only several canoes lingered,\nand from one of these Van Horn beckoned aboard Nau-hau, the biggest chief\nof the stronghold of Langa-Langa.  Unlike most of the big chiefs, Nau-hau\nwas young, and, unlike most of the Melanesians, he was handsome, even\nbeautiful.\n\n\"Hello, King o' Babylon,\" was Van Horn's greeting, for so he had named\nhim because of fancied Semitic resemblance blended with the crude power\nthat marked his visage and informed his bearing.\n\nBorn and trained to nakedness, Nau-hau trod the deck boldly and\nunashamed.  His sole gear of clothing was a length of trunk strap buckled\nabout his waist.  Between this and his bare skin was thrust the naked\nblade of a ten-inch ripping knife.  His sole decoration was a white China\nsoup-plate, perforated and strung on coconut sennit, suspended from about\nhis neck so that it rested flat on his chest and half-concealed the\ngenerous swell of muscles.  It was the greatest of treasures.  No man of\nMalaita he had ever heard of possessed an unbroken soup-plate.\n\nNor was he any more ridiculous because of the soup-plate than was he\nludicrous because of his nakedness.  He was royal.  His father had been a\nking before him, and he had proved himself greater than his father.  Life\nand death he bore in his hands and head.  Often he had exercised it,\nchirping to his subjects in the tongue of Langa-Langa: \"Slay here,\" and\n\"Slay there\"; \"Thou shalt die,\" and \"Thou shalt live.\"  Because his\nfather, a year abdicated, had chosen foolishly to interfere with his\nson's government, he had called two boys and had them twist a cord of\ncoconut around his father's neck so that thereafter he never breathed\nagain.  Because his favourite wife, mother of his eldest born, had dared\nout of silliness of affection to violate one of his kingly tamboos, he\nhad had her killed and had himself selfishly and religiously eaten the\nlast of her even to the marrow of her cracked joints, sharing no morsel\nwith his boonest of comrades.\n\nRoyal he was, by nature, by training, by deed.  He carried himself with\nconsciousness of royalty.  He looked royal--as a magnificent stallion may\nlook royal, as a lion on a painted tawny desert may look royal.  He was\nas splendid a brute--an adumbration of the splendid human conquerors and\nrulers, higher on the ladder of evolution, who have appeared in other\ntimes and places.  His pose of body, of chest, of shoulders, of head, was\nroyal.  Royal was the heavy-lidded, lazy, insolent way he looked out of\nhis eyes.\n\nRoyal in courage was he, this moment on the _Arangi_, despite the fact\nthat he knew he walked on dynamite.  As he had long since bitterly\nlearned, any white man was as much dynamite as was the mysterious death-\ndealing missile he sometimes employed.  When a stripling, he had made one\nof the canoe force that attacked the sandalwood-cutter that had been even\nsmaller than the _Arangi_.  He had never forgotten that mystery.  Two of\nthe three white men he had seen slain and their heads removed on deck.\nThe third, still fighting, had but the minute before fled below.  Then\nthe cutter, along with all her wealth of hoop-iron, tobacco, knives and\ncalico, had gone up into the air and fallen back into the sea in\nscattered and fragmented nothingness.  It had been dynamite--the MYSTERY.\nAnd he, who had been hurled uninjured through the air by a miracle of\nfortune, had divined that white men in themselves were truly dynamite,\ncompounded of the same mystery as the substance with which they shot the\nswift-darting schools of mullet, or blow up, in extremity, themselves and\nthe ships on which they voyaged the sea from far places.  And yet on this\nunstable and death-terrific substance of which he was well aware Van Horn\nwas composed, he trod heavily with his personality, daring, to the verge\nof detonation, to impact it with his insolence.\n\n\"My word,\" he began, \"what name you make 'm boy belong me stop along you\ntoo much?\"  Which was a true and correct charge that the boys which Van\nHorn had just returned had been away three years and a half instead of\nthree years.\n\n\"You talk that fella talk I get cross too much along you,\" Van Horn\nbristled back, and then added, diplomatically, dipping into a half-case\nof tobacco sawed across and proffering a handful of stick tobacco: \"Much\nbetter you smoke 'm up and talk 'm good fella talk.\"\n\nBut Nau-hau grandly waved aside the gift for which he hungered.\n\n\"Plenty tobacco stop along me,\" he lied.  \"What name one fella boy go way\nno come back?\" he demanded.\n\nVan Horn pulled the long slender account book out of the twist of his\nloin-cloth, and, while he skimmed its pages, impressed Nau-hau with the\ndynamite of the white man's superior powers which enabled him to remember\ncorrectly inside the scrawled sheets of a book instead of inside his\nhead.\n\n\"Sati,\" Van Horn read, his finger marking the place, his eyes alternating\nwatchfully between the writing and the black chief before him, while the\nblack chief himself speculated and studied the chance of getting behind\nhim and, with the single knife-thrust he knew so well, of severing the\nother's spinal cord at the base of the neck.\n\n\"Sati,\" Van Horn read.  \"Last monsoon begin about this time, him fella\nSati get 'm sick belly belong him too much; bime by him fella Sati finish\naltogether,\" he translated into beche-de-mer the written information:\n_Died_ _of_ _dysentery_ _July_ _4th_, 1901.\n\n\"Plenty work him fella Sati, long time,\" Nau-hau drove to the point.\n\"What come along money belong him?\"\n\nVan Horn did mental arithmetic from the account.\n\n\"Altogether him make 'm six tens pounds and two fella pounds gold money,\"\nwas his translation of sixty-two pounds of wages.  \"I pay advance father\nbelong him one ten pounds and five fella pounds.  Him finish altogether\nfour tens pounds and seven fella pounds.\"\n\n\"What name stop four tens pounds and seven fella pounds?\" Nau-hau\ndemanded, his tongue, but not his brain, encompassing so prodigious a\nsum.\n\nVan Horn held up his hand.\n\n\"Too much hurry you fella Nau-hau.  Him fella Sati buy 'm slop chest\nalong plantation two tens pounds and one fella pound.  Belong Sati he\nfinish altogether two tens pounds and six fella pounds.\"\n\n\"What name stop two tens pounds and six fella pounds?\" Nau-hau continued\ninflexibly.\n\n\"Stop 'm along me,\" the captain answered curtly.\n\n\"Give 'm me two tens pounds and six fella pounds.\"\n\n\"Give 'm you hell,\" Van Horn refused, and in the blue of his eyes the\nblack chief sensed the impression of the dynamite out of which white men\nseemed made, and felt his brain quicken to the vision of the bloody day\nhe first encountered an explosion of dynamite and was hurled through the\nair.\n\n\"What name that old fella boy stop 'm along canoe?\" Van Horn asked,\npointing to an old man in a canoe alongside.  \"Him father belong Sati?\"\n\n\"Him father belong Sati,\" Nau-hau affirmed.\n\nVan Horn motioned the old man in and on board, beckoned Borckman to take\ncharge of the deck and of Nau-hau, and went below to get the money from\nhis strong-box.  When he returned, cavalierly ignoring the chief, he\naddressed himself to the old man.\n\n\"What name belong you?\"\n\n\"Me fella Nino,\" was the quavering response.  \"Him fella Sati belong\nalong me.\"\n\nVan Horn glanced for verification to Nau-hau, who nodded affirmation in\nthe reverse Solomon way; whereupon Van Horn counted twenty-six gold\nsovereigns into the hand of Sati's father.\n\nImmediately thereafter Nau-hau extended his hand and received the sum.\nTwenty gold pieces the chief retained for himself, returning to the old\nman the remaining six.  It was no quarrel of Van Horn's.  He had\nfulfilled his duty and paid properly.  The tyranny of a chief over a\nsubject was none of his business.\n\nBoth masters, white and black, were fairly contented with themselves.  Van\nHorn had paid the money where it was due; Nau-hau, by virtue of kingship,\nhad robbed Sati's father of Sati's labour before Van Horn's eyes.  But\nNau-hau was not above strutting.  He declined a proffered present of\ntobacco, bought a case of stick tobacco from Van Horn, paying him five\npounds for it, and insisted on having it sawed open so that he could fill\nhis pipe.\n\n\"Plenty good boy stop along Langa-Langa?\" Van Horn, unperturbed, politely\nqueried, in order to make conversation and advertise nonchalance.\n\nThe King o' Babylon grinned, but did not deign to reply.\n\n\"Maybe I go ashore and walk about?\" Van Horn challenged with tentative\nemphasis.\n\n\"Maybe too much trouble along you,\" Nau-hau challenged back.  \"Maybe\nplenty bad fella boy kai-kai along you.\"\n\nAlthough Van Horn did not know it, at this challenge he experienced the\nhair-pricking sensations in his scalp that Jerry experienced when he\nbristled his back.\n\n\"Hey, Borckman,\" he called.  \"Man the whaleboat.\"\n\nWhen the whaleboat was alongside, he descended into it first, superiorly,\nthen invited Nau-hau to accompany him.\n\n\"My word, King o' Babylon,\" he muttered in the chief's ears as the boat's\ncrew bent to the oars, \"one fella boy make 'm trouble, I shoot 'm hell\nouta you first thing.  Next thing I shoot 'm hell outa Langa-Langa.  All\nthe time you me fella walk about, you walk about along me.  You no like\nwalk about along me, you finish close up altogether.\"\n\nAnd ashore, a white man alone, attended by an Irish terrier puppy with a\nheart flooded with love and by a black king resentfully respectful of the\ndynamite of the white man, Van Horn went, swashbuckling barelegged\nthrough a stronghold of three thousand souls, while his white mate,\naddicted to schnapps, held the deck of the tiny craft at anchor off\nshore, and while his black boat's crew, oars in hands, held the whaleboat\nstern-on to the beach to receive the expected flying leap of the man they\nserved but did not love, and whose head they would eagerly take any time\nwere it not for fear of him.\n\nVan Horn had had no intention of going ashore, and that he went ashore at\nthe black chief's insolent challenge was merely a matter of business.  For\nan hour he strolled about, his right hand never far from the butt of the\nautomatic that lay along his groin, his eyes never too far from the\nunwilling Nau-hau beside him.  For Nau-hau, in sullen volcanic rage, was\nripe to erupt at the slightest opportunity.  And, so strolling, Van Horn\nwas given to see what few white men have seen, for Langa-Langa and her\nsister islets, beautiful beads strung along the lee coast of Malaita,\nwere as unique as they were unexplored.\n\nOriginally these islets had been mere sand-banks and coral reefs awash in\nthe sea or shallowly covered by the sea.  Only a hunted, wretched\ncreature, enduring incredible hardship, could have eked out a miserable\nexistence upon them.  But such hunted, wretched creatures, survivors of\nvillage massacres, escapes from the wrath of chiefs and from the long-pig\nfate of the cooking-pot, did come, and did endure.  They, who knew only\nthe bush, learned the salt water and developed the salt-water-man breed.\nThey learned the ways of the fish and the shell-fish, and they invented\nhooks and lines, nets and fish-traps, and all the diverse cunning ways by\nwhich swimming meat can be garnered from the shifting, unstable sea.\n\nSuch refugees stole women from the mainland, and increased and\nmultiplied.  With herculean labour, under the burning sun, they conquered\nthe sea.  They walled the confines of their coral reefs and sand-banks\nwith coral-rock stolen from the mainland on dark nights.  Fine masonry,\nwithout mortar or cutting chisel, they builded to withstand the ocean\nsurge.  Likewise stolen from the mainland, as mice steal from human\nhabitations when humans sleep, they stole canoe-loads, and millions of\ncanoe-loads, of fat, rich soil.\n\nGenerations and centuries passed, and, behold, in place of naked\nsandbanks half awash were walled citadels, perforated with launching-ways\nfor the long canoes, protected against the mainland by the lagoons that\nwere to them their narrow seas.  Coconut palms, banana trees, and lofty\nbreadfruit trees gave food and sun-shelter.  Their gardens prospered.\nTheir long, lean war-canoes ravaged the coasts and visited vengeance for\ntheir forefathers upon the descendants of them that had persecuted and\ndesired to eat.\n\nLike the refugees and renegades who slunk away in the salt marshes of the\nAdriatic and builded the palaces of powerful Venice on her deep-sunk\npiles, so these wretched hunted blacks builded power until they became\nmasters of the mainland, controlling traffic and trade-routes, compelling\nthe bushmen for ever after to remain in the bush and never to dare\nattempt the salt-water.\n\nAnd here, amidst the fat success and insolence of the sea-people, Van\nHorn swaggered his way, taking his chance, incapable of believing that he\nmight swiftly die, knowing that he was building good future business in\nthe matter of recruiting labour for the plantations of other adventuring\nwhite men on far islands who dared only less greatly than he.\n\nAnd when, at the end of an hour, Van Horn passed Jerry into the\nsternsheets of the whaleboat and followed, he left on the beach a stunned\nand wondering royal black, who, more than ever before, was respectful of\nthe dynamite-compounded white men who brought to him stick tobacco,\ncalico, knives and hatchets, and inexorably extracted from such trade a\nprofit.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nBack on board, Van Horn immediately hove short, hoisted sail, broke out\nthe anchor, and filled away for the ten-mile beat up the lagoon to\nwindward that would fetch Somo.  On the way, he stopped at Binu to greet\nChief Johnny and land a few Binu returns.  Then it was on to Somo, and to\nthe end of voyaging for ever of the _Arangi_ and of many that were aboard\nof her.\n\nQuite the opposite to his treatment at Langa-Langa was that accorded Van\nHorn at Somo.  Once the return boys were put ashore, and this was\naccomplished no later than three-thirty in the afternoon, he invited\nChief Bashti on board.  And Chief Bashti came, very nimble and active\ndespite his great age, and very good-natured--so good-natured, in fact,\nthat he insisted on bringing three of his elderly wives on board with\nhim.  This was unprecedented.  Never had he permitted any of his wives to\nappear before a white man, and Van Horn felt so honoured that he\npresented each of them with a gay clay pipe and a dozen sticks of\ntobacco.\n\nLate as the afternoon was, trade was brisk, and Bashti, who had taken the\nlion's share of the wages due to the fathers of two boys who had died,\nbought liberally of the _Arangi's_ stock.  When Bashti promised plenty of\nfresh recruits, Van Horn, used to the changeableness of the savage mind,\nurged signing them up right away.  Bashti demurred, and suggested next\nday.  Van Horn insisted that there was no time like the present, and so\nwell did he insist that the old chief sent a canoe ashore to round up the\nboys who had been selected to go away to the plantations.\n\n\"Now, what do you think?\" Van Horn asked of Borckman, whose eyes were\nremarkably fishy.  \"I never saw the old rascal so friendly.  Has he got\nsomething up his sleeve?\"\n\nThe mate stared at the many canoes alongside, noted the numbers of women\nin them, and shook his head.\n\n\"When they're starting anything they always send the Marys into the\nbush,\" he said.\n\n\"You never can tell about these niggers,\" the captain grumbled.  \"They\nmay be short on imagination, but once in a while they do figure out\nsomething new.  Now Bashti's the smartest old nigger I've ever seen.\nWhat's to prevent his figuring out that very bet and playing it in\nreverse?  Just because they've never had their women around when trouble\nwas on the carpet is no reason that they will always keep that practice.\"\n\n\"Not even Bashti's got the savvee to pull a trick like that,\" Borckman\nobjected.  \"He's just feeling good and liberal.  Why, he's bought forty\npounds of goods from you already.  That's why he wants to sign on a new\nbatch of boys with us, and I'll bet he's hoping half of them die so's he\ncan have the spending of their wages.\"\n\nAll of which was most reasonable.  Nevertheless, Van Horn shook his head.\n\n\"All the same keep your eyes sharp on everything,\" he cautioned.  \"And\nremember, the two of us mustn't ever be below at the same time.  And no\nmore schnapps, mind, until we're clear of the whole kit and caboodle.\"\n\nBashti was incredibly lean and prodigiously old.  He did not know how old\nhe was himself, although he did know that no person in his tribe had been\nalive when he was a young boy in the village.  He remembered the days\nwhen some of the old men, still alive, had been born; and, unlike him,\nthey were now decrepit, shaken with palsy, blear-eyed, toothless of\nmouth, deaf of ear, or paralysed.  All his own faculties remained\nunimpaired.  He even boasted a dozen worn fangs of teeth, gum-level, on\nwhich he could still chew.  Although he no longer had the physical\nendurance of youth, his thinking was as original and clear as it had\nalways been.  It was due to his thinking that he found his tribe stronger\nthan when he had first come to rule it.  In his small way he had been a\nMelanesian Napoleon.  As a warrior, the play of his mind had enabled him\nto beat back the bushmen's boundaries.  The scars on his withered body\nattested that he had fought to the fore.  As a Law-giver, he had\nencouraged and achieved strength and efficiency within his tribe.  As a\nstatesman, he had always kept one thought ahead of the thoughts of the\nneighbouring chiefs in the making of treaties and the granting of\nconcessions.\n\nAnd with his mind, still keenly alive, he had but just evolved a scheme\nwhereby he might outwit Van Horn and get the better of the vast British\nEmpire about which he guessed little and know less.\n\nFor Somo had a history.  It was that queer anomaly, a salt-water tribe\nthat lived on the lagoon mainland where only bushmen were supposed to\nlive.  Far back into the darkness of time, the folk-lore of Somo cast a\nglimmering light.  On a day, so far back that there was no way of\nestimating its distance, one, Somo, son of Loti, who was the chief of the\nisland fortress of Umbo, had quarrelled with his father and fled from his\nwrath along with a dozen canoe-loads of young men.  For two monsoons they\nhad engaged in an odyssey.  It was in the myth that they circumnavigated\nMalaita twice, and forayed as far as Ugi and San Cristobal across the\nwide seas.\n\nWomen they had inevitably stolen after successful combats, and, in the\nend, being burdened with women and progeny, Somo had descended upon the\nmainland shore, driven the bushmen back, and established the salt-water\nfortress of Somo.  Built it was, on its sea-front, like any island\nfortress, with walled coral-rock to oppose the sea and chance marauders\nfrom the sea, and with launching ways through the walls for the long\ncanoes.  To the rear, where it encroached on the jungle, it was like any\nscattered bush village.  But Somo, the wide-seeing father of the new\ntribe, had established his boundaries far up in the bush on the shoulders\nof the lesser mountains, and on each shoulder had planted a village.  Only\nthe greatly daring that fled to him had Somo permitted to join the new\ntribe.  The weaklings and cowards they had promptly eaten, and the\nunbelievable tale of their many heads adorning the canoe-houses was part\nof the myth.\n\nAnd this tribe, territory, and stronghold, at the latter end of time,\nBashti had inherited, and he had bettered his inheritance.  Nor was he\nabove continuing to better it.  For a long time he had reasoned closely\nand carefully in maturing the plan that itched in his brain for\nfulfilment.  Three years before, the tribe of Ano Ano, miles down the\ncoast, had captured a recruiter, destroyed her and all hands, and gained\na fabulous store of tobacco, calico, beads, and all manner of trade\ngoods, rifles and ammunition.\n\nLittle enough had happened in the way of price that was paid.  Half a\nyear after, a war vessel had poked her nose into the lagoon, shelled Ano\nAno, and sent its inhabitants scurrying into the bush.  The landing-party\nthat followed had futilely pursued along the jungle runways.  In the end\nit had contented itself with killing forty fat pigs and chopping down a\nhundred coconut trees.  Scarcely had the war vessel passed out to open\nsea, when the people of Ano Ano were back from the bush to the village.\nShell fire on flimsy grass houses is not especially destructive.  A few\nhours' labour of the women put that little matter right.  As for the\nforty dead pigs, the entire tribe fell upon the carcasses, roasted them\nunder the ground with hot stones, and feasted.  The tender tips of the\nfallen palms were likewise eaten, while the thousands of coconuts were\nhusked and split and sun-dried and smoke-cured into copra to be sold to\nthe next passing trader.\n\nThus, the penalty exacted had proved a picnic and a feast--all of which\nappealed to the thrifty, calculating brain of Bashti.  And what was good\nfor Ano Ano, in his judgment was surely good for Somo.  Since such were\nwhite men's ways who sailed under the British flag and killed pigs and\ncut down coconuts in cancellation of blood-debts and headtakings, Bashti\nsaw no valid reason why he should not profit as Ano Ano had profited.  The\nprice to be paid at some possible future time was absurdly\ndisproportionate to the immediate wealth to be gained.  Besides, it had\nbeen over two years since the last British war vessel had appeared in the\nSolomons.\n\nAnd thus, Bashti, with a fine fresh idea inside his head, bowed his\nchief's head in consent that his people could flock aboard and trade.\nVery few of them knew what his idea was or that he even had an idea.\n\nTrade grew still brisker as more canoes came alongside and black men and\nwomen thronged the deck.  Then came the recruits, new-caught, young,\nsavage things, timid as deer, yet yielding to stern parental and tribal\nlaw and going down into the _Arangi's_ cabin, one by one, their fathers\nand mothers and relatives accompanying them in family groups, to confront\nthe big fella white marster, who wrote their names down in a mysterious\nbook, had them ratify the three years' contract of their labour by a\ntouch of the right hand to the pen with which he wrote, and who paid the\nfirst year's advance in trade goods to the heads of their respective\nfamilies.\n\nOld Bashti sat near, taking his customary heavy tithes out of each\nadvance, his three old wives squatting humbly at his feet and by their\nmere presence giving confidence to Van Horn, who was elated by the stroke\nof business.  At such rate his cruise on Malaita would be a short one,\nwhen he would sail away with a full ship.\n\nOn deck, where Borckman kept a sharp eye out against danger, Jerry\nprowled about, sniffing the many legs of the many blacks he had never\nencountered before.  The wild-dog had gone ashore with the return boys,\nand of the return boys only one had come back.  It was Lerumie, past whom\nJerry repeatedly and stiff-leggedly bristled without gaining response of\nrecognition.  Lerumie coolly ignored him, went down below once and\npurchased a trade hand-mirror, and, with a look of the eyes, assured old\nBashti that all was ready and ripe to break at the first favourable\nmoment.\n\nOn deck, Borckman gave this favourable moment.  Nor would he have so\ngiven it had he not been guilty of carelessness and of disobedience to\nhis captain's orders.  He did not leave the schnapps alone.  Be did not\nsense what was impending all about him.  Aft, where he stood, the deck\nwas almost deserted.  Amidships and for'ard, gamming with the boat's\ncrew, the deck was crowded with blacks of both sexes.  He made his way to\nthe yam sacks lashed abaft the mizzenmast and got his bottle.  Just\nbefore he drank, with a shred of caution, he cast a glance behind him.\nNear him stood a harmless Mary, middle-aged, fat, squat, asymmetrical,\nunlovely, a sucking child of two years astride her hip and taking\nnourishment.  Surely no harm was to be apprehended there.  Furthermore,\nshe was patently a weaponless Mary, for she wore no stitch of clothing\nthat otherwise might have concealed a weapon.  Over against the rail, ten\nfeet to one side, stood Lerumie, smirking into the trade mirror he had\njust bought.\n\nIt was in the trade mirror that Lerumie saw Borckman bend to the\nyam-sacks, return to the erect, throw his head back, the mouth of the\nbottle glued to his lips, the bottom elevated skyward.  Lerumie lifted\nhis right hand in signal to a woman in a canoe alongside.  She bent\nswiftly for something that she tossed to Lerumie.  It was a long-handled\ntomahawk, the head of it an ordinary shingler's hatchet, the haft of it,\nnative-made, a black and polished piece of hard wood, inlaid in rude\ndesigns with mother-of-pearl and wrapped with coconut sennit to make a\nhand grip.  The blade of the hatchet had been ground to razor-edge.\n\nAs the tomahawk flew noiselessly through the air to Lerumie's hand, just\nas noiselessly, the next instant, it flew through the air from his hand\ninto the hand of the fat Mary with the nursing child who stood behind the\nmate.  She clutched the handle with both hands, while the child, astride\nher hip, held on to her with both small arms part way about her.\n\nStill she waited the stroke, for with Borckman's head thrown back was no\ntime to strive to sever the spinal cord at the neck.  Many eyes beheld\nthe impending tragedy.  Jerry saw, but did not understand.  With all his\nhostility to niggers he had not divined the attack from the air.  Tambi,\nwho chanced to be near the skylight, saw, and, seeing, reached for a Lee-\nEnfield.  Lerumie saw Tambi's action and hissed haste to the Mary.\n\nBorckman, as unaware of this, his last second of life, as he had been of\nhis first second of birth, lowered the bottle and straightened forward\nhis head.  The keen edge sank home.  What, in that flash of instant when\nhis brain was severed from the rest of his body, Borckman may have felt\nor thought, if he felt or thought at all, is a mystery unsolvable to\nliving man.  No man, his spinal cord so severed, has ever given one word\nor whisper of testimony as to what were his sensations and impressions.\nNo less swift than the hatchet stroke was the limp placidity into which\nBorckman's body melted to the deck.  He did not reel or pitch.  He\n_melted_, as a sack of wind suddenly emptied, as a bladder of air\nsuddenly punctured.  The bottle fell from his dead hand upon the yams\nwithout breaking, although the remnant of its contents gurgled gently out\nupon the deck.\n\nSo quick was the occurrence of action, that the first shot from Tambi's\nmusket missed the Mary ere Borckman had quite melted to the deck.  There\nwas no time for a second shot, for the Mary, dropping the tomahawk,\nholding her child in both her hands and plunging to the rail, was in the\nair and overboard, her fall capsizing the canoe which chanced to be\nbeneath her.\n\nScores of actions were simultaneous.  From the canoes on both sides\nuprose a glittering, glistening rain of mother-of-pearl-handled tomahawks\nthat descended into the waiting hands of the Somo men on deck, while the\nMarys on deck crouched down and scrambled out of the fray.  At the same\ntime that the Mary who had killed Borckman leapt the rail, Lerumie bent\nfor the tomahawk she had dropped, and Jerry, aware of red war, slashed\nthe hand that reached for the tomahawk.  Lerumie stood upright and loosed\nloudly, in a howl, all the pent rage and hatred, of months which he had\ncherished against the puppy.  Also, as he gained the perpendicular and as\nJerry flew at his legs, he launched a kick with all his might that caught\nand lifted Jerry squarely under the middle.\n\nAnd in the next second, or fraction of second, as Jerry lifted and soared\nthrough the air, over the barbed wire of the rail and overboard, while\nSniders were being passed up overside from the canoes, Tambi fired his\nnext hasty shot.  And Lerumie, the foot with which he had kicked not yet\nreturned to the deck as again he was in mid-action of stooping to pick up\nthe tomahawk, received the bullet squarely in the heart and pitched down\nto melt with Borckman into the softness of death.\n\nEre Jerry struck the water, the glory of Tambi's marvellously lucky shot\nwas over for Tambi; for, at the moment he pressed trigger to the\nsuccessful shot, a tomahawk bit across his skull at the base of the brain\nand darkened from his eyes for ever the bright vision of the sea-washed,\nsun-blazoned tropic world.  As swiftly, all occurring almost\nsimultaneously, did the rest of the boat's crew pass and the deck became\na shambles.\n\nIt was to the reports of the Sniders and the noises of the death scuffle\nthat Jerry's head emerged from the water.  A man's hand reached over a\ncanoe-side and dragged him in by the scruff of the neck, and, although he\nsnarled and struggled to bite his rescuer, he was not so much enraged as\nwas he torn by the wildest solicitude for Skipper.  He knew, without\nthinking about it, that the _Arangi_ had been boarded by the hazily\nsensed supreme disaster of life that all life intuitively apprehends and\nthat only man knows and calls by the name of \"death.\"  Borckman he had\nseen struck down.  Lerumie he had heard struck down.  And now he was\nhearing the explosions of rifles and the yells and screeches of triumph\nand fear.\n\nSo it was, helpless, suspended in the air by the nape of the neck, that\nhe bawled and squalled and choked and coughed till the black, disgusted,\nflung him down roughly in the canoe's bottom.  He scrambled to his feet\nand made two leaps: one upon the gunwale of the canoe; the next,\ndespairing and hopeless, without consideration of self, for the rail of\nthe _Arangi_.\n\nHis forefeet missed the rail by a yard, and he plunged down into the sea.\nHe came up, swimming frantically, swallowing and strangling salt water\nbecause he still yelped and wailed and barked his yearning to be on board\nwith Skipper.\n\nBut a boy of twelve, in another canoe, having witnessed the first black's\nadventure with Jerry, treated him without ceremony, laying, first the\nflat, and next the edge, of a paddle upon his head while he still swam.\nAnd the darkness of unconsciousness welled over his bright little love-\nsuffering brain, so that it was a limp and motionless puppy that the\nblack boy dragged into his canoe.\n\nIn the meantime, down below in the _Arangi's_ cabin, ere ever Jerry hit\nthe water from Lerumie's kick, even while he was in the air, Van Horn, in\none great flashing profound fraction of an instant, had known his death.\nNot for nothing had old Bashti lived longest of any living man in his\ntribe, and ruled wisest of all the long line of rulers since Somo's time.\nHad he been placed more generously in earth space and time, he might well\nhave proved an Alexander, a Napoleon, or a swarthy Kahehameha.  As it\nwas, he performed well, and splendidly well, in his limited little\nkingdom on the leeward coast of the dark cannibal island of Malaita.\n\nAnd such a performance!  In cool good nature in rigid maintenance of his\nchiefship rights, he had smiled at Van Horn, given royal permission to\nhis young men to sign on for three years of plantation slavery, and\nexacted his share of each year's advance.  Aora, who might be described\nas his prime minister and treasurer, had received the tithes as fast as\nthey were paid over, and filled them into large, fine-netted bags of\ncoconut sennit.  At Bashti's back, squatting on the bunk-boards, a slim\nand smooth-skinned maid of thirteen had flapped the flies away from his\nroyal head with the royal fly-flapper.  At his feet had squatted his\nthree old wives, the oldest of them, toothless and somewhat palsied, ever\npresenting to his hand, at his head nod, a basket rough-woven of pandanus\nleaf.\n\nAnd Bashti, his keen old ears pitched for the first untoward sound from\non deck, had continually nodded his head and dipped his hand into the\nproffered basket--now for betel-nut, and lime-box, and the invariable\ngreen leaf with which to wrap the mouthful; now for tobacco with which to\nfill his short clay pipe; and, again, for matches with which to light the\npipe which seemed not to draw well and which frequently went out.\n\nToward the last the basket had hovered constantly close to his hand, and,\nat the last, he made one final dip.  It was at the moment when the Mary's\naxe, on deck, had struck Borckman down and when Tambi loosed the first\nshot at her from his Lee-Enfield.  And Bashti's withered ancient hand,\nthe back of it netted with a complex of large up-standing veins from\nwhich the flesh had shrunk away, dipped out a huge pistol of such remote\nvintage that one of Cromwell's round-heads might well have carried it or\nthat it might well have voyaged with Quiros or La Perouse.  It was a\nflint-lock, as long as a man's forearm, and it had been loaded that\nafternoon by no less a person than Bashti himself.\n\nQuick as Bashti had been, Van Horn was almost as quick, but not quite\nquick enough.  Even as his hand leapt to the modern automatic lying out\nof it's holster and loose on his knees, the pistol of the centuries went\noff.  Loaded with two slugs and a round bullet, its effect was that of a\nsawed-off shotgun.  And Van Horn knew the blaze and the black of death,\neven as \"Gott fer dang!\" died unuttered on his lips and as his fingers\nrelaxed from the part-lifted automatic, dropping it to the floor.\n\nSurcharged with black powder, the ancient weapon had other effect.  It\nburst in Bashti's hand.  While Aora, with a knife produced apparently\nfrom nowhere, proceeded to hack off the white master's head, Bashti\nlooked quizzically at his right forefinger dangling by a strip of skin.\nHe seized it with his left hand, with a quick pull and twist wrenched it\noff, and grinningly tossed it, as a joke, into the pandanus basket which\nstill his wife with one hand held before him while with the other she\nclutched her forehead bleeding from a flying fragment of pistol.\n\nCollaterally with this, three of the young recruits, joined by their\nfathers and uncles, had downed, and were finishing off the only one of\nthe boat's crew that was below.  Bashti, who had lived so long that he\nwas a philosopher who minded pain little and the loss of a finger less,\nchuckled and chirped his satisfaction and pride of achievement in the\noutcome, while his three old wives, who lived only at the nod of his\nhead, fawned under him on the floor in the abjectness of servile\ncongratulation and worship.  Long had they lived, and they had lived long\nonly by his kingly whim.  They floundered and gibbered and mowed at his\nfeet, lord of life and death that he was, infinitely wise as he had so\noften proved himself, as he had this time proved himself again.\n\nAnd the lean, fear-stricken girl, like a frightened rabbit in the mouth\nof its burrow, on hands and knees peered forth upon the scene from the\nlazarette and knew that the cooking-pot and the end of time had come for\nher.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nWhat happened aboard the _Arangi_ Jerry never knew.  He did know that it\nwas a world destroyed, for he saw it destroyed.  The boy who had knocked\nhim on the head with the paddle, tied his legs securely and tossed him\nout on the beach ere he forgot him in the excitement of looting the\n_Arangi_.\n\nWith great shouting and song, the pretty teak-built yacht was towed in by\nthe long canoes and beached close to where Jerry lay just beyond the\nconfines of the coral-stone walls.  Fires blazed on the beach, lanterns\nwere lighted on board, and, amid a great feasting, the _Arangi_ was\ngutted and stripped.  Everything portable was taken ashore, from her pigs\nof iron ballast to her running gear and sails.  No one in Somo slept that\nnight.  Even the tiniest of children toddled about the feasting fires or\nsprawled surfeited on the sands.  At two in the morning, at Bashti's\ncommand, the shell of the boat was fired.  And Jerry, thirsting for\nwater, having whimpered and wailed himself to exhaustion, lying helpless,\nleg-tied, on his side, saw the floating world he had known so short a\ntime go up in flame and smoke.\n\nAnd by the light of her burning, old Bashti apportioned the loot.  No one\nof the tribe was too mean to receive nothing.  Even the wretched bush-\nslaves, who had trembled through all the time of their captivity from\nfear of being eaten, received each a clay pipe and several sticks of\ntobacco.  The main bulk of the trade goods, which was not distributed,\nBashti had carried up to his own large grass house.  All the wealth of\ngear was stored in the several canoe houses.  While in the devil devil\nhouses the devil devil doctors set to work curing the many heads over\nslow smudges; for, along with the boat's crew there were a round dozen of\nNo-ola return boys and several Malu boys which Van Horn had not yet\ndelivered.\n\nNot all these had been slain, however.  Bashti had issued stern\ninjunctions against wholesale slaughter.  But this was not because his\nheart was kind.  Rather was it because his head was shrewd.  Slain they\nwould all be in the end.  Bashti had never seen ice, did not know it\nexisted, and was unversed in the science of refrigeration.  The only way\nhe knew to keep meat was to keep it alive.  And in the biggest canoe\nhouse, the club house of the stags, where no Mary might come under\npenalty of death by torture, the captives were stored.\n\nTied or trussed like fowls or pigs, they were tumbled on the hard-packed\nearthen floor, beneath which, shallowly buried, lay the remains of\nancient chiefs, while, overhead, in wrappings of grass mats, swung all\nthat was left of several of Bashti's immediate predecessors, his father\nlatest among them and so swinging for two full generations.  Here, too,\nsince she was to be eaten and since the taboo had no bearing upon one\ncondemned to be cooked, the thin little Mary from the lazarette was\ntumbled trussed upon the floor among the many blacks who had teased and\nmocked her for being fattened by Van Horn for the eating.\n\nAnd to this canoe house Jerry was also brought to join the others on the\nfloor.  Agno, chief of the devil devil doctors, had stumbled across him\non the beach, and, despite the protestations of the boy who claimed him\nas personal trove, had ordered him to the canoe house.  Carried past the\nfires of the feasting, his keen nostrils had told him of what the feast\nconsisted.  And, new as the experience was, he had bristled and snarled\nand struggled against his bonds to be free.  Likewise, at first, tossed\ndown in the canoe house, he had bristled and snarled at his fellow\ncaptives, not realizing their plight, and, since always he had been\ntrained to look upon niggers as the eternal enemy, considering them\nresponsible for the catastrophe to the _Arangi_ and to Skipper.\n\nFor Jerry was only a little dog, with a dog's limitations, and very young\nin the world.  But not for long did he throat his rage at them.  In vague\nways it was borne in upon him that they, too, were not happy.  Some had\nbeen cruelly wounded, and kept up a moaning and groaning.  Without any\nclearness of concept, nevertheless Jerry had a realization that they were\nas painfully circumstanced as himself.  And painful indeed was his own\ncircumstance.  He lay on his side, the cords that bound his legs so tight\nas to bite into his tender flesh and shut off the circulation.  Also, he\nwas perishing for water, and panted, dry-tongued, dry-mouthed, in the\nstagnant heat.\n\nA dolorous place it was, this canoe house, filled with groans and sighs,\ncorpses beneath the floor and composing the floor, creatures soon to be\ncorpses upon the floor, corpses swinging in aerial sepulchre overhead,\nlong black canoes, high-ended like beaked predatory monsters, dimly\nlooming in the light of a slow fire where sat an ancient of the tribe of\nSomo at his interminable task of smoke-curing a bushman's head.  He was\nwithered, and blind, and senile, gibbering and mowing like some huge ape\nas ever he turned and twisted, and twisted back again, the suspended head\nin the pungent smoke, and handful by handful added rotten punk of wood to\nthe smudge fire.\n\nSixty feet in the clear, the dim fire occasionally lighted, through\nshadowy cross-beams, the ridge-pole that was covered with sennit of\ncoconut that was braided in barbaric designs of black and white and that\nwas stained by the smoke of years almost to a monochrome of dirty brown.\nFrom the lofty cross-beams, on long sennit strings, hung the heads of\nenemies taken aforetime in jungle raid and sea foray.  The place breathed\nthe very atmosphere of decay and death, and the imbecile ancient, curing\nin the smoke the token of death, was himself palsiedly shaking into the\ndisintegration of the grave.\n\nToward daylight, with great shouting and heaving and pull and haul,\nscores of Somo men brought in another of the big war canoes.  They made\nway with foot and hand, kicking and thrusting dragging and shoving, the\nbound captives to either side of the space which the canoe was to occupy.\nThey were anything but gentle to the meat with which they had been\nfavoured by good fortune and the wisdom of Bashti.\n\nFor a time they sat about, all pulling at clay pipes and chirruping and\nlaughing in queer thin falsettos at the events of the night and the\nprevious afternoon.  Now one and now another stretched out and slept\nwithout covering; for so, directly under the path of the sun, had they\nslept nakedly from the time they were born.\n\nRemained awake, as dawn paled the dark, only the grievously wounded or\nthe too-tightly bound, and the decrepit ancient who was not so old as\nBashti.  When the boy who had stunned Jerry with his paddle-blade and who\nclaimed him as his own stole into the canoe house, the ancient did not\nhear him.  Being blind, he did not see him.  He continued gibbering and\nchuckling dementedly, to twist the bushman's head back and forth and to\nfeed the smudge with punk-wood.  This was no night-task for any man, nor\neven for him who had forgotten how to do aught else.  But the excitement\nof cutting out the _Arangi_ had been communicated to his addled brain,\nand, with vague reminiscent flashes of the strength of life triumphant,\nhe shared deliriously in this triumph of Somo by applying himself to the\ncuring of the head that was in itself the concrete expression of triumph.\n\nBut the twelve-year-old lad who stole in and cautiously stepped over the\nsleepers and threaded his way among the captives, did so with his heart\nin his mouth.  He knew what taboos he was violating.  Not old enough even\nto leave his father's grass roof and sleep in the youths' canoe house,\nmuch less to sleep with the young bachelors in their canoe house, he knew\nthat he took his life, with all of its dimly guessed mysteries and\narrogances, in his hand thus to trespass into the sacred precinct of the\nfull-made, full-realized, full-statured men of Somo.\n\nBut he wanted Jerry and he got him.  Only the lean little Mary, trussed\nfor the cooking, staring through her wide eyes of fear, saw the boy pick\nJerry up by his tied legs and carry him out and away from the booty of\nmeat of which she was part.  Jerry's heroic little heart of courage would\nhave made him snarl and resent such treatment of handling had he not been\ntoo exhausted and had not his mouth and throat been too dry for sound.  As\nit was, miserably and helplessly, not half himself, a puppet dreamer in a\nhalf-nightmare, he knew, as a restless sleeper awakening between vexing\ndreams, that he was being transported head-downward out of the canoe\nhouse that stank of death, through the village that was only less\nnoisome, and up a path under lofty, wide-spreading trees that were\nbeginning languidly to stir with the first breathings of the morning\nwind.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nThe boy's name, as Jerry was to learn, was Lamai, and to Lamai's house\nJerry was carried.  It was not much of a house, even as cannibal grass-\nhouses go.  On an earthen floor, hard-packed of the filth of years, lived\nLamai's father and mother and a spawn of four younger brothers and\nsisters.  A thatched roof that leaked in every heavy shower leaned to a\nwabbly ridge-pole over the floor.  The walls were even more pervious to a\ndriving rain.  In fact, the house of Lamai, who was the father of Lumai,\nwas the most miserable house in all Somo.\n\nLumai, the house-master and family head, unlike most Malaitans, was fat.\nAnd of his fatness it would seem had been begotten his good nature with\nits allied laziness.  But as the fly in his ointment of jovial\nirresponsibility was his wife, Lenerengo--the prize shrew of Somo, who\nwas as lean about the middle and all the rest of her as her husband was\nrotund; who was as remarkably sharp-spoken as he was soft-spoken; who was\nas ceaselessly energetic as he was unceasingly idle; and who had been\nborn with a taste for the world as sour in her mouth as it was sweet in\nhis.\n\nThe boy merely peered into the house as he passed around it to the rear,\nand he saw his father and mother, at opposite corners, sleeping without\ncovering, and, in the middle of the floor, his four naked brothers and\nsisters curled together in a tangle like a litter of puppies.  All about\nthe house, which in truth was scarcely more than an animal lair, was an\nearthly paradise.  The air was spicily and sweetly heavy with the scents\nof wild aromatic plants and gorgeous tropic blooms.  Overhead three\nbreadfruit trees interlaced their noble branches.  Banana and plantain\ntrees were burdened with great bunches of ripening fruit.  And huge,\ngolden melons of the papaia, ready for the eating, globuled directly from\nthe slender-trunked trees not one-tenth the girth of the fruits they\nbore.  And, for Jerry, most delightful of all, there was the gurgle and\nplash of a brooklet that pursued its invisible way over mossy stones\nunder a garmenture of tender and delicate ferns.  No conservatory of a\nking could compare with this wild wantonness of sun-generous vegetation.\n\nMaddened by the sound of the water, Jerry had first to endure an\nembracing and hugging from the boy, who, squatted on his hams, rocked\nback and forth and mumbled a strange little crooning song.  And Jerry,\nlacking articulate speech, had no way of telling him of the thirst of\nwhich he was perishing.\n\nNext, Lamai tied him securely with a sennit cord about the neck and\nuntied the cords that bit into his legs.  So numb was Jerry from lack of\ncirculation, and so weak from lack of water through part of a tropic day\nand all of a tropic night, that he stood up, tottered and fell, and, time\nand again, essaying to stand, floundered and fell.  And Lamai understood,\nor tentatively guessed.  He caught up a coconut calabash attached to the\nend of a stick of bamboo, dipped into the greenery of ferns, and\npresented to Jerry the calabash brimming with the precious water.\n\nJerry lay on his side at first as he drank, until, with the moisture,\nlife flowed back into the parched channels of him, so that, soon, still\nweak and shaky, he was up and braced on all his four wide-spread legs and\nstill eagerly lapping.  The boy chuckled and chirped his delight in the\nspectacle, and Jerry found surcease and easement sufficient to enable him\nto speak with his tongue after the heart-eloquent manner of dogs.  He\ntook his nose out of the calabash and with his rose-ribbon strip of\ntongue licked Lamai's hand.  And Lamai, in ecstasy over this\nestablishment of common speech, urged the calabash back under Jerry's\nnose, and Jerry drank again.\n\nHe continued to drink.  He drank until his sun-shrunken sides stood out\nlike the walls of a balloon, although longer were the intervals from the\ndrinking in which, with his tongue of gratefulness, he spoke against the\nblack skin of Lamai's hand.  And all went well, and would have continued\nto go well, had not Lamai's mother, Lenerengo, just awakened, stepped\nacross her black litter of progeny and raised her voice in shrill protest\nagainst her eldest born's introducing of one more mouth and much more\nnuisance into the household.\n\nA squabble of human speech followed, of which Jerry knew no word but of\nwhich he sensed the significance.  Lamai was with him and for him.\nLamai's mother was against him.  She shrilled and shrewed her firm\nconviction that her son was a fool and worse because he had neither the\nconsideration nor the silly sense of a fool's solicitude for a\nhard-worked mother.  She appealed to the sleeping Lumai, who awoke\nheavily and fatly, who muttered and mumbled easy terms of Somo dialect to\nthe effect that it was a most decent world, that all puppy dogs and\neldest-born sons were right delightful things to possess, that he had\nnever yet starved to death, and that peace and sleep were the finest\nthings that ever befell the lot of mortal man--and, in token thereof,\nback into the peace of sleep, he snuggled his nose into the biceps of his\narm for a pillow and proceeded to snore.\n\nBut Lamai, eyes stubbornly sullen, with mutinous foot-stampings and a\nperfect knowledge that all was clear behind him to leap and flee away if\nhis mother rushed upon him, persisted in retaining his puppy dog.  In the\nend, after an harangue upon the worthlessness of Lamai's father, she went\nback to sleep.\n\nIdeas beget ideas.  Lamai had learned how astonishingly thirsty Jerry had\nbeen.  This engendered the idea that he might be equally hungry.  So he\napplied dry branches of wood to the smouldering coals he dug out of the\nashes of the cooking-fire, and builded a large fire.  Into this, as it\ngained strength, he placed many stones from a convenient pile, each fire-\nblackened in token that it had been similarly used many times.  Next,\nhidden under the water of the brook in a netted hand-bag, he brought to\nlight the carcass of a fat wood-pigeon he had snared the previous day.  He\nwrapped the pigeon in green leaves, and, surrounding it with the hot\nstones from the fire, covered pigeon and stones with earth.\n\nWhen, after a time, he removed the pigeon and stripped from it the\nscorched wrappings of leaves, it gave forth a scent so savoury as to\nprick up Jerry's ears and set his nostrils to quivering.  When the boy\nhad torn the steaming carcass across and cooled it, Jerry's meal began;\nnor did the meal cease till the last sliver of meat had been stripped and\ntongued from the bones and the bones crunched and crackled to fragments\nand swallowed.  And throughout the meal Lamai made love to Jerry,\ncrooning over and over his little song, and patting and caressing him.\n\nOn the other hand, refreshed by the water and the meat, Jerry did not\nreciprocate so heartily in the love-making.  He was polite, and received\nhis petting with soft-shining eyes, tail-waggings and the customary body-\nwrigglings; but he was restless, and continually listened to distant\nsounds and yearned away to be gone.  This was not lost upon the boy, who,\nbefore he curled himself down to sleep, securely tied to a tree the end\nof the cord that was about Jerry's neck.\n\nAfter straining against the cord for a time, Jerry surrendered and slept.\nBut not for long.  Skipper was too much with him.  He knew, and yet he\ndid not know, the irretrievable ultimate disaster to Skipper.  So it was,\nafter low whinings and whimperings, that he applied his sharp first-teeth\nto the sennit cord and chewed upon it till it parted.\n\nFree, like a homing pigeon, he headed blindly and directly for the beach\nand the salt sea over which had floated the _Arangi_, on her deck Skipper\nin command.  Somo was largely deserted, and those that were in it were\nsunk in sleep.  So no one vexed him as he trotted through the winding\npathways between the many houses and past the obscene kingposts of\ntotemic heraldry, where the forms of men, carved from single tree trunks,\nwere seated in the gaping jaws of carved sharks.  For Somo, tracing back\nto Somo its founder, worshipped the shark-god and the salt-water deities\nas well as the deities of the bush and swamp and mountain.\n\nTurning to the right until he was past the sea-wall, Jerry came on down\nto the beach.  No _Arangi_ was to be seen on the placid surface of the\nlagoon.  All about him was the debris of the feast, and he scented the\nsmouldering odours of dying fires and burnt meat.  Many of the feasters\nhad not troubled to return to their houses, but lay about on the sand, in\nthe mid-morning sunshine, men, women, and children and entire families,\nwherever they had yielded to slumber.\n\nDown by the water's edge, so close that his fore-feet rested in the\nwater, Jerry sat down, his heart bursting for Skipper, thrust his nose\nheavenward at the sun, and wailed his woe as dogs have ever wailed since\nthey came in from the wild woods to the fires of men.\n\nAnd here Lamai found him, hushed his grief against his breast with\ncuddling arms, and carried him back to the grass house by the brook.\nWater he offered, but Jerry could drink no more.  Love he offered, but\nJerry could not forget his torment of desire for Skipper.  In the end,\ndisgusted with so unreasonable a puppy, Lamai forgot his love in his\nboyish savageness, clouted Jerry over the head, right side and left, and\ntied him as few whites men's dogs have ever been tied.  For, in his way,\nLamai was a genius.  He had never seen the thing done with any dog, yet\nhe devised, on the spur of the moment, the invention of tying Jerry with\na stick.  The stick was of bamboo, four feet long.  One end he tied\nshortly to Jerry's neck, the other end, just as shortly to a tree.  All\nthat Jerry's teeth could reach was the stick, and dry and seasoned bamboo\ncan defy the teeth of any dog.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nFor many days, tied by the stick, Jerry remained Lamai's prisoner.  It\nwas not a happy time, for the house of Lumai was a house of perpetual\nbickering and quarrelling.  Lamai fought pitched battles with his\nbrothers and sisters for teasing Jerry, and these battles invariably\nculminated in Lenerengo taking a hand and impartially punishing all her\nprogeny.\n\nAfter that, as a matter of course and on general principles, she would\nhave it out with Lumai, whose soft voice always was for quiet and repose,\nand who always, at the end of a tongue-lashing, took himself off to the\ncanoe house for a couple of days.  Here, Lenerengo was helpless.  Into\nthe canoe house of the stags no Mary might venture.  Lenerengo had never\nforgotten the fate of the last Mary who had broken the taboo.  It had\noccurred many years before, when she was a girl, and the recollection was\never vivid of the unfortunate woman hanging up in the sun by one arm for\nall of a day, and for all of a second day by the other arm.  After that\nshe had been feasted upon by the stags of the canoe house, and for long\nafterward all women had talked softly before their husbands.\n\nJerry did discover liking for Lamai, but it was not strong nor\npassionate.  Rather was it out of gratitude, for only Lamai saw to it\nthat he received food and water.  Yet this boy was no Skipper, no Mister\nHaggin.  Nor was he even a Derby or a Bob.  He was that inferior\nman-creature, a nigger, and Jerry had been thoroughly trained all his\nbrief days to the law that the white men were the superior two-legged\ngods.\n\nHe did not fail to recognize, however, the intelligence and power that\nresided in the niggers.  He did not reason it out.  He accepted it.  They\nhad power of command over other objects, could propel sticks and stones\nthrough the air, could even tie him a prisoner to a stick that rendered\nhim helpless.  Inferior as they might be to the white-gods, still they\nwere gods of a sort.\n\nIt was the first time in his life that Jerry had been tied up, and he did\nnot like it.  Vainly he hurt his teeth, some of which were loosening\nunder the pressure of the second teeth rising underneath.  The stick was\nstronger than he.  Although he did not forget Skipper, the poignancy of\nhis loss faded with the passage of time, until uppermost in his mind was\nthe desire to be free.\n\nBut when the day came that he was freed, he failed to take advantage of\nit and scuttle away for the beach.  It chanced that Lenerengo released\nhim.  She did it deliberately, desiring to be quit of him.  But when she\nuntied Jerry, he stopped to thank her, wagging his tail and smiling up at\nher with his hazel-brown eyes.  She stamped her foot at him to be gone,\nand uttered a harsh and intimidating cry.  This Jerry did not understand,\nand so unused was he to fear that he could not be frightened into running\naway.  He ceased wagging his tail, and, though he continued to look up at\nher, his eyes no longer smiled.  Her action and noise he identified as\nunfriendly, and he became alert and watchful, prepared for whatever\nhostile act she might next commit.\n\nAgain she cried out and stamped her foot.  The only effect on Jerry was\nto make him transfer his watchfulness to the foot.  This slowness in\ngetting away, now that she had released him, was too much for her short\ntemper.  She launched the kick, and Jerry, avoiding it, slashed her\nankle.\n\nWar broke on the instant, and that she might have killed Jerry in her\nrage was highly probable had not Lamai appeared on the scene.  The stick\nuntied from Jerry's neck told the tale of her perfidy and incensed Lamai,\nwho sprang between and deflected the blow with a stone poi-pounder that\nmight have brained Jerry.\n\nLamai was now the one in danger of grievous damage, and his mother had\njust knocked him down with a clout alongside the head when poor Lumai,\nroused from sleep by the uproar, ventured out to make peace.  Lenerengo,\nas usual, forgot everything else in the fiercer pleasure of berating her\nspouse.\n\nThe conclusion of the affair was harmless enough.  The children stopped\ntheir crying, Lamai retied Jerry with the stick, Lenerengo harangued\nherself breathless, and Lumai departed with hurt feelings for the canoe\nhouse where stags could sleep in peace and Marys pestered not.\n\nThat night, in the circle of his fellow stags, Lumai recited his sorrows\nand told the cause of them--the puppy dog which had come on the _Arangi_.\nIt chanced that Agno, chief of the devil devil doctors, or high priest,\nheard the tale, and recollected that he had sent Jerry to the canoe house\nalong with the rest of the captives.  Half an hour later he was having it\nout with Lamai.  Beyond doubt, the boy had broken the taboos, and privily\nhe told him so, until Lamai trembled and wept and squirmed abjectly at\nhis feet, for the penalty was death.\n\nIt was too good an opportunity to get a hold over the boy for Agno to\nmisplay it.  A dead boy was worth nothing to him, but a living boy whose\nlife he carried in his hand would serve him well.  Since no one else knew\nof the broken taboo, he could afford to keep quiet.  So he ordered Lamai\nforthright down to live in the youths' canoe house, there to begin his\nnovitiate in the long series of tasks, tests and ceremonies that would\ngraduate him into the bachelors' canoe house and half way along toward\nbeing a recognized man.\n\n* * * * *\n\nIn the morning, obeying the devil devil doctor's commands, Lenerengo tied\nJerry's feet together, not without a struggle in which his head was\nbanged about and her hands were scratched.  Then she carried him down\nthrough the village on the way to deliver him at Agno's house.  On the\nway, in the open centre of the village where stood the kingposts, she\nleft him lying on the ground in order to join in the hilarity of the\npopulation.\n\nNot only was old Bashti a stern law-giver, but he was a unique one.  He\nhad selected this day at the one time to administer punishment to two\nquarrelling women, to give a lesson to all other women, and to make all\nhis subjects glad once again that they had him for ruler.  Tiha and\nWiwau, the two women, were squat and stout and young, and had long been a\nscandal because of their incessant quarrelling.  Bashti had set them a\nrace to run.  But such a race.  It was side-splitting.  Men, women, and\nchildren, beholding, howled with delight.  Even elderly matrons and\ngreybeards with a foot in the grave screeched and shrilled their joy in\nthe spectacle.\n\nThe half-mile course lay the length of the village, through its heart,\nfrom the beach where the _Arangi_ had been burned to the beach at the\nother end of the sea-wall.  It had to be covered once in each direction\nby Tiha and Wiwau, in each case one of them urging speed on the other and\nthe other desiring speed that was unattainable.\n\nOnly the mind of Bashti could have devised the show.  First, two round\ncoral stones, weighing fully forty pounds each, were placed in Tiha's\narms.  She was compelled to clasp them tightly against her sides in order\nthat they might not roll to the ground.  Behind her, Bashti placed Wiwau,\nwho was armed with a bristle of bamboo splints mounted on a light long\nshaft of bamboo.  The splints were sharp as needles, being indeed the\nneedles used in tattooing, and on the end of the pole they were intended\nto be applied to Tiha's back in the same way that men apply ox-goads to\noxen.  No serious damage, but much pain, could be inflicted, which was\njust what Bashti had intended.\n\nWiwau prodded with the goad, and Tiha stumbled and wabbled in gymnastic\nefforts to make speed.  Since, when the farther beach had been reached,\nthe positions would be reversed and Wiwau would carry the stones back\nwhile Tiha prodded, and since Wiwau knew that for what she gave Tiha\nwould then try to give more, Wiwau exerted herself to give the utmost\nwhile yet she could.  The perspiration ran down both their faces.  Each\nhad her partisans in the crowd, who encouraged and heaped ridicule with\nevery prod.\n\nLudicrous as it was, behind it lay iron savage law.  The two stones were\nto be carried the entire course.  The woman who prodded must do so with\nconviction and dispatch.  The woman who was prodded must not lose her\ntemper and fight her tormentor.  As they had been duly forewarned by\nBashti, the penalty for infraction of the rules he had laid down was\nstaking out on the reef at low tide to be eaten by the fish-sharks.\n\nAs the contestants came opposite where Bashti and Aora his prime minister\nstood, they redoubled their efforts, Wiwau goading enthusiastically, Tiha\njumping with every thrust to the imminent danger of dropping the stones.\nAt their heels trooped the children of the village and all the village\ndogs, whooping and yelping with excitement.\n\n\"Long time you fella Tiha no sit 'm along canoe,\" Aora bawled to the\nvictim and set Bashti cackling again.\n\nAt an unusually urgent prod, Tiha dropped a stone and was duly goaded\nwhile she sank to her knees and with one arm scooped it in against her\nside, regained her feet, and waddled on.\n\nOnce, in stark mutiny at so much pain, she deliberately stopped and\naddressed her tormentor.\n\n\"Me cross along you too much,\" she told Wiwau.  \"Bime by, close--\"\n\nBut she never completed the threat.  A warmly administered prod broke\nthrough her stoicism and started her tottering along.\n\nThe shouting of the rabble ebbed away as the queer race ran on toward the\nbeach.  But in a few minutes it could be heard flooding back, this time\nWiwau panting with the weight of coral stone and Tiha, a-smart with what\nshe had endured, trying more than to even the score.\n\nOpposite Bashti, Wiwau lost one of the stones, and, in the effort to\nrecover it, lost the other, which rolled a dozen feet away from the\nfirst.  Tiha became a whirlwind of avenging fury.  And all Somo went\nwild.  Bashti held his lean sides with merriment while tears of purest\njoy ran down his prodigiously wrinkled cheeks.\n\nAnd when all was over, quoth Bashti to his people: \"Thus shall all women\nfight when they desire over much to fight.\"\n\nOnly he did not say it in this way.  Nor did he say it in the Somo\ntongue.  What he did say was in beche-de-mer, and his words were:\n\n\"Any fella Mary he like 'm fight, all fella Mary along Somo fight 'm this\nfella way.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nFor some time after the conclusion of the race, Bashti stood talking with\nhis head men, Agno among them.  Lenerengo was similarly engaged with\nseveral old cronies.  As Jerry lay off to one side where she had\nforgotten him, the wild-dog he had bullied on the _Arangi_ came up and\nsniffed at him.  At first he sniffed at a distance, ready for instant\nflight.  Then he drew cautiously closer.  Jerry watched him with\nsmouldering eyes.  At the moment wild-dog's nose touched him, he uttered\na warning growl.  Wild-dog sprang back and whirled away in headlong\nflight for a score of yards before he learned that he was not pursued.\n\nAgain he came back cautiously, as it was the instinct in him to stalk\nwild game, crouching so close to the ground that almost his belly\ntouched.  He lifted and dropped his feet with the lithe softness of a\ncat, and from time to time glanced to right and to left as if in\napprehension of some flank attack.  A noisy outburst of boys' laughter in\nthe distance caused him to crouch suddenly down, his claws thrust into\nthe ground for purchase, his muscles tense springs for the leap he knew\nnot in what direction, from the danger he knew not what that might\nthreaten him.  Then he identified the noise, know that no harm impended,\nand resumed his stealthy advance on the Irish terrier.\n\nWhat might have happened there is no telling, for at that moment Bashti's\neyes chanced to rest on the golden puppy for the first time since the\ncapture of the _Arangi_.  In the rush of events Bashti had forgotten the\npuppy.\n\n\"What name that fella dog?\" he cried out sharply, causing wild-dog to\ncrouch down again and attracting Lenerengo's attention.\n\nShe cringed in fear to the ground before the terrible old chief and\nquavered a recital of the facts.  Her good-for-nothing boy Lamai had\npicked the dog from the water.  It had been the cause of much trouble in\nher house.  But now Lamai had gone to live with the youths, and she was\ncarrying the dog to Agno's house at Agno's express command.\n\n\"What name that dog stop along you?\" Bashti demanded directly of Agno.\n\n\"Me kai-kai along him,\" came the answer.  \"Him fat fella dog.  Him good\nfella dog kai-kai.\"\n\nInto Bashti's alert old brain flashed an idea that had been long\nmaturing.\n\n\"Him good fella dog too much,\" he announced.  \"Better you eat 'm bush\nfella dog,\" he advised, pointing at wild-dog.\n\nAgno shook his head.  \"Bush fella dog no good kai-kai.\"\n\n\"Bush fella dog no good too much,\" was Bashti's judgment.  \"Bush fella\ndog too much fright.  Plenty fella bush dog too much fright.  White\nmarster's dog no fright.  Bush dog no fight.  White marster's dog fight\nlike hell.  Bush dog run like hell.  You look 'm eye belong you, you\nsee.\"\n\nBashti stepped over to Jerry and cut the cords that tied his legs.  And\nJerry, upon his feet in a surge, was for once in too great haste to pause\nto give thanks.  He hurled himself after wild-dog, caught him in\nmid-flight, and rolled him over and over in a cloud of dust.  Ever wild-\ndog strove to escape, and ever Jerry cornered him, rolled him, and bit\nhim, while Bashti applauded and called on his head men to behold.\n\nBy this time Jerry had become a raging little demon.  Fired by all his\nwrongs, from the bloody day on the _Arangi_ and the loss of Skipper down\nto this latest tying of his legs, he was avenging himself on wild-dog for\neverything.  The owner of wild-dog, a return boy, made the mistake of\ntrying to kick Jerry away.  Jerry was upon him in a flash scratching his\ncalves with his teeth, in the suddenness of his onslaught getting between\nthe black's legs and tumbling him to the ground.\n\n\"What name!\" Bashti cried in a rage at the offender, who lay\nfear-stricken where he had fallen, trembling for what next words might\nfall from his chief's lips.\n\nBut Bashti was already doubling with laughter at sight of wild-dog\nrunning for his life down the street with Jerry a hundred feet behind and\ntearing up the dust.\n\nAs they disappeared, Bashti expounded his idea.  If men planted banana\ntrees, it ran, what they would get would be bananas.  If they planted\nyams, yams would be produced, not sweet potatoes or plantains, but yams,\nnothing but yams.  The same with dogs.  Since all black men's dogs were\ncowards, all the breeding of all black men's dogs would produce cowards.\nWhite men's dogs were courageous fighters.  When they were bred they\nproduced courageous fighters.  Very well, and to the conclusion, namely,\nhere was a white man's dog in their possession.  The height of\nfoolishness would be to eat it and to destroy for all time the courage\nthat resided in it.  The wise thing to do was to regard it as a seed dog,\nto keep it alive, so that in the coming generations of Somo dogs its\ncourage would be repeated over and over and spread until all Somo dogs\nwould be strong and brave.\n\nFurther, Bashti commanded his chief devil devil doctor to take charge of\nJerry and guard him well.  Also, he sent his word forth to all the tribe\nthat Jerry was taboo.  No man, woman, or child was to throw spear or\nstone at him, strike him with club or tomahawk, or hurt him in any way.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThenceforth, and until Jerry himself violated one of the greatest of\ntaboos, he had a happy time in Agno's gloomy grass house.  For Bashti,\nunlike most chiefs, ruled his devil devil doctors with an iron hand.\nOther chiefs, even Nau-hau of Langa-Langa, were ruled by their devil\ndevil doctors.  For that matter, the population of Somo believed that\nBashti was so ruled.  But the Somo folk did not know what went on behind\nthe scenes, when Bashti, a sheer infidel, talked alone now with one\ndoctor and now with another.\n\nIn these private talks he demonstrated that he knew their game as well as\nthey did, and that he was no slave to the dark superstitions and gross\nimpostures with which they kept the people in submission.  Also, he\nexposited the theory, as ancient as priests and rulers, that priests and\nrulers must work together in the orderly governance of the people.  He\nwas content that the people should believe that the gods, and the priests\nwho were the mouth-pieces of the gods, had the last word, but he would\nhave the priests know that in private the last word was his.  Little as\nthey believed in their trickery, he told them, he believed less.\n\nHe knew taboo, and the truth behind taboo.  He explained his personal\ntaboos, and how they came to be.  Never must he eat clam-meat, he told\nAgno.  It was so selected by himself because he did not like clam-meat.\nIt was old Nino, high priest before Agno, with an ear open to the voice\nof the shark-god, who had so laid the taboo.  But, he, Bashti, had\nprivily commanded Nino to lay the taboo against clam-meat upon him,\nbecause he, Bashti, did not like clam-meat and had never liked clam-meat.\n\nStill further, since he had lived longer than the oldest priest of them,\nhis had been the appointing of every one of them.  He knew them, had made\nthem, had placed them, and they lived by his pleasure.  And they would\ncontinue to take program from him, as they had always taken it, or else\nthey would swiftly and suddenly pass.  He had but to remind them of the\npassing of Kori, the devil devil doctor who had believed himself stronger\nthan his chief, and who, for his mistake, had screamed in pain for a week\nere what composed him had ceased to scream and for ever ceased to scream.\n\n* * * * *\n\nIn Agno's large grass house was little light and much mystery.  There was\nno mystery there for Jerry, who merely knew things, or did not know\nthings, and who never bothered about what he did not know.  Dried heads\nand other cured and mouldy portions of human carcasses impressed him no\nmore than the dried alligators and dried fish that contributed to the\nfestooning of Agno's dark abode.\n\nJerry found himself well cared for.  No children nor wives cluttered the\ndevil devil doctor's house.  Several old women, a fly-flapping girl of\neleven, and two young men who had graduated from the canoe house of the\nyouths and who were studying priestcraft under the master, composed the\nhousehold and waited upon Jerry.  Food of the choicest was his.  After\nAgno had eaten first-cut of pig, Jerry was served second.  Even the two\nacolytes and the fly-flapping maid ate after him, leaving the debris for\nthe several old women.  And, unlike the mere bush dogs, who stole shelter\nfrom the rain under overhanging eaves, Jerry was given a dry place under\nthe roof where the heads of bushmen and of forgotten sandalwood traders\nhung down from above in the midst of a dusty confusion of dried viscera\nof sharks, crocodile skulls, and skeletons of Solomons rats that measured\ntwo-thirds of a yard in length from bone-tip of nose to bone-tip of tail.\n\nA number of times, all freedom being his, Jerry stole away across the\nvillage to the house of Lumai.  But never did he find Lamai, who, since\nSkipper, was the only human he had met that had placed a bid to his\nheart.  Jerry never appeared openly, but from the thick fern of the\nbrookside observed the house and scented out its occupants.  No scent of\nLamai did he ever obtain, and, after a time, he gave up his vain visits\nand accepted the devil devil doctor's house as his home and the devil\ndevil doctor as his master.\n\nBut he bore no love for this master.  Agno, who had ruled by fear so long\nin his house of mystery, did not know love.  Nor was affection any part\nof him, nor was geniality.  He had no sense of humour, and was as\nfrostily cruel as an icicle.  Next to Bashti he stood in power, and all\nhis days had been embittered in that he was not first in power.  He had\nno softness for Jerry.  Because he feared Bashti he feared to harm Jerry.\n\nThe months passed, and Jerry got his firm, massive second teeth and\nincreased in weight and size.  He came as near to being spoiled as is\npossible for a dog.  Himself taboo, he quickly learned to lord it over\nthe Somo folk and to have his way and will in all matters.  No one dared\nto dispute with him with stick or stone.  Agno hated him--he knew that;\nbut also he gleaned the knowledge that Agno feared him and would not dare\nto hurt him.  But Agno was a chill-blooded philosopher and bided his\ntime, being different from Jerry in that he possessed human prevision and\ncould adjust his actions to remote ends.\n\nFrom the edge of the lagoon, into the waters of which, remembering the\ncrocodile taboo he had learned on Meringe, he never ventured, Jerry\nranged to the outlying bush villages of Bashti's domain.  All made way\nfor him.  All fed him when he desired food.  For the taboo was upon him,\nand he might unchidden invade their sleeping-mats or food calabashes.  He\nmight bully as he pleased, and be arrogant beyond decency, and there was\nno one to say him nay.  Even had Bashti's word gone forth that if Jerry\nwere attacked by the full-grown bush dogs, it was the duty of the Somo\nfolk to take his part and kick and stone and beat the bush dogs.  And\nthus his own four-legged cousins came painfully to know that he was\ntaboo.\n\nAnd Jerry prospered.  Fat to stupidity he might well have become, had it\nnot been for his high-strung nerves and his insatiable, eager curiosity.\nWith the freedom of all Somo his, he was ever a-foot over it, learning\nits metes and bounds and the ways of the wild creatures that inhabited\nits swamps and forests and that did not acknowledge his taboo.\n\nMany were his adventures.  He fought two battles with the wood-rats that\nwere almost of his size, and that, being mature and wild and cornered,\nfought him as he had never been fought before.  The first he had killed,\nunaware that it was an old and feeble rat.  The second, in prime of\nvigour, had so punished him that he crawled back, weak and sick to the\ndevil devil doctor's house, where, for a week, under the dried emblems of\ndeath, he licked his wounds and slowly came back to life and health.\n\nHe stole upon the dugong and joyed to stampede that silly timid creature\nby sudden ferocious onslaughts which he knew himself to be all sound and\nfury, but which tickled him and made him laugh with the consciousness of\nplaying a successful joke.  He chased the unmigratory tropi-ducks from\ntheir shrewd-hidden nests, walked circumspectly among the crocodiles\nhauled out of water for slumber, and crept under the jungle-roof and\nspied upon the snow-white saucy cockatoos, the fierce ospreys, the heavy-\nflighted buzzards, the lories and kingfishers, and the absurdly garrulous\nlittle pygmy parrots.\n\nThrice, beyond the boundaries of Somo, he encountered the little black\nbushmen who were more like ghosts than men, so noiseless and\nunperceivable were they, and who, guarding the wild-pig runways of the\njungle, missed spearing him on the three memorable occasions.  As the\nwood-rats had taught him discretion, so did these two-legged lurkers in\nthe jungle twilight.  He had not fought with them, although they tried to\nspear him.  He quickly came to know that these were other folk than Somo\nfolk, that his taboo did not extend to them, and that, even of a sort,\nthey were two-legged gods who carried flying death in their hands that\nreached farther than their hands and bridged distance.\n\nAs he ran the jungle, so Jerry ran the village.  No place was sacred to\nhim.  In the devil devil houses, where, before the face of mystery men\nand women crawled in fear and trembling, he walked stiff-legged and\nbristling; for fresh heads were suspended there--heads his eyes and keen\nnostrils identified as those of once living blacks he had known on board\nthe _Arangi_.  In the biggest devil devil house he encountered the head\nof Borckman, and snarled at it, without receiving response, in\nrecollection of the fight he had fought with the schnapps-addled mate on\nthe deck of the _Arangi_.\n\nOnce, however, in Bashti's house, he chanced upon all that remained on\nearth of Skipper.  Bashti had lived very long, had lived most wisely and\nthought much, and was thoroughly aware that, having lived far beyond the\nspan of man his own span was very short.  And he was curious about it\nall--the meaning and purpose of life.  He loved the world and life, into\nwhich he had been fortunately born, both as to constitution and to place,\nwhich latter, for him, had been the high place over hie priests and\npeople.  He was not afraid to die, but he wondered if he might live\nagain.  He discounted the silly views of the tricky priests, and he was\nvery much alone in the chaos of the confusing problem.\n\nFor he had lived so long, and so luckily, that he had watched the waning\nto extinction of all the vigorous appetites and desires.  He had known\nwives and children, and the keen-edge of youthful hunger.  He had seen\nhis children grow to manhood and womanhood and become fathers and\ngrandfathers, mothers and grandmothers.  But having known woman, and\nlove, and fatherhood, and the belly-delights of eating, he had passed on\nbeyond.  Food?  Scarcely did he know its meaning, so little did he eat.\nHunger, that bit him like a spur when he was young and lusty, had long\nsince ceased to stir and prod him.  He ate out of a sense of necessity\nand duty, and cared little for what he ate, save for one thing: the eggs\nof the megapodes that were, in season, laid in his private, personal,\nstrictly tabooed megapode laying-yard.  Here was left to him his last\nlingering flesh thrill.  As for the rest, he lived in his intellect,\nruling his people, seeking out data from which to induce laws that would\nmake his people stronger and rivet his people's clinch upon life.\n\nBut he realized clearly the difference between that abstract thing, the\ntribe, and that most concrete of things, the individual.  The tribe\npersisted.  Its members passed.  The tribe was a memory of the history\nand habits of all previous members, which the living members carried on\nuntil they passed and became history and memory in the intangible sum\nthat was the tribe.  He, as a member, soon or late, and late was very\nnear, must pass.  But pass to what?  There was the rub.  And so it was,\non occasion, that he ordered all forth from his big grass house, and,\nalone with his problem, lowered from the roof-beams the matting-wrapped\nparcels of heads of men he had once seen live and who had passed into the\nmysterious nothingness of death.\n\nNot as a miser had he collected these heads, and not as a miser counting\nhis secret hoard did he ponder these heads, unwrapped, held in his two\nhands or lying on his knees.  He wanted to know.  He wanted to know what\nhe guessed they might know, now that they had long since gone into the\ndarkness that rounds the end of life.\n\nVarious were the heads Bashti thus interrogated--in his hands, on his\nknees, in his dim-lighted grasshouse, while the overhead sun blazed down\nand the fading south-east sighed through the palm-fronds and breadfruit\nbranches.  There was the head of a Japanese--the only one he had ever\nseen or heard of.  Before he was born it had been taken by his father.\nIll-cured it was, and battered and marred with ancientness and rough\nusage.  Yet he studied its features, decided that it had once had two\nlips as live as his own and a mouth as vocal and hungry as his had often\nbeen in the past.  Two eyes and a nose it had, a thatched crown of roof,\nand a pair of ears like to his own.  Two legs and a body it must once\nhave had, and desires and lusts.  Heats of wrath and of love, so he\ndecided, had also been its once on a time when it never thought to die.\n\nA head that amazed him much, whose history went back before his father's\nand grandfather's time, was the head of a Frenchman, although Bashti knew\nit not.  Nor did he know it was the head of La Perouse, the doughty old\nnavigator, who had left his bones, the bones of his crews, and the bones\nof his two frigates, the _Astrolabe_ and the _Boussole_, on the shores of\nthe cannibal Solomons.  Another head--for Bashti was a confirmed head-\ncollector--went back two centuries before La Perouse to Alvaro de\nMendana, the Spaniard.  It was the head of one of Mendana's armourers,\nlost in a beach scrimmage to one of Bashti's remote ancestors.\n\nStill another head, the history of which was vague, was a white woman's\nhead.  What wife of what navigator there was no telling.  But earrings of\ngold and emerald still clung to the withered ears, and the hair,\ntwo-thirds of a fathom long, a shimmering silk of golden floss, flowed\nfrom the scalp that covered what had once been the wit and will of her\nthat Bashti reasoned had in her ancient time been quick with love in the\narms of man.\n\nOrdinary heads, of bushmen and salt-water men, and even of\nschnapps-drinking white men like Borckman, he relegated to the canoe\nhouses and devil devil houses.  For he was a connoisseur in the matter of\nheads.  There was a strange head of a German that lured him much.  Red-\nbearded it was, and red-haired, but even in dried death there was an\nironness of feature and a massive brow that hinted to him of mastery of\nsecrets beyond his ken.  No more than did he know it once had been a\nGerman, did he know it was a German professor's head, an astronomer's\nhead, a head that in its time had carried within its content profound\nknowledge of the stars in the vasty heavens, of the way of star-directed\nships upon the sea, and of the way of the earth on its starry course\nthrough space that was a myriad million times beyond the slight concept\nof space that he possessed.\n\nLast of all, sharpest of bite in his thought, was the head of Van Horn.\nAnd it was the head of Van Horn that lay on his knees under his\ncontemplation when Jerry, who possessed the freedom of Somo, trotted into\nBashti's grass house, scented and identified the mortal remnant of\nSkipper, wailed first in woe over it, then bristled into rage.\n\nBashti did not notice at first, for he was deep in interrogation of Van\nHorn's head.  Only short months before this head had been alive, he\npondered, quick with wit, attached to a two-legged body that stood erect\nand that swaggered about, a loincloth and a belted automatic around its\nmiddle, more powerful, therefrom, than Bashti, but with less wit, for had\nnot he, Bashti, with an ancient pistol, put darkness inside that skull\nwhere wit resided, and removed that skull from the soddenly relaxed\nframework of flesh and bone on which it had been supported to tread the\nearth and the deck of the _Arangi_?\n\nWhat had become of that wit?  Had that wit been all of the arrogant,\nupstanding Van Horn, and had it gone out as the flickering flame of a\nsplinter of wood goes out when it is quite burnt to a powder-fluff of\nash?  Had all that made Van Horn passed like the flame of the splinter?\nHad he passed into the darkness for ever into which the beast passed,\ninto which passed the speared crocodile, the hooked bonita, the netted\nmullet, the slain pig that was fat to eat?  Was Van Horn's darkness as\nthe darkness of the blue-bottle fly that his fly-flapping maid smashed\nand disrupted in mid-flight of the air?--as the darkness into which\npassed the mosquito that knew the secret of flying, and that, despite its\nperfectness of flight, with almost an unthought action, he squashed with\nthe flat of his hand against the back of his neck when it bit him?\n\nWhat was true of this white man's head, so recently alive and erectly\ndominant, Bashti knew was true of himself.  What had happened to this\nwhite man, after going through the dark gate of death, would happen to\nhim.  Wherefore he questioned the head, as if its dumb lips might speak\nto him from out of the mystery and tell him the meaning of life, and the\nmeaning of death that inevitably laid life by the heels.\n\nJerry's long-drawn howl of woe at sight and scent of all that was left of\nSkipper, roused Bashti from his reverie.  He looked at the sturdy, golden-\nbrown puppy, and immediately included it in his reverie.  It was alive.\nIt was like man.  It knew hunger, and pain, anger and love.  It had blood\nin its veins, like man, that a thrust of a knife could make redly gush\nforth and denude it to death.  Like the race of man it loved its kind,\nand birthed and breast-nourished its young.  And passed.  Ay, it passed;\nfor many a dog, as well as a human, had he, Bashti, devoured in his hey-\ndey of appetite and youth, when he knew only motion and strength, and fed\nmotion and strength out of the calabashes of feasting.\n\nBut from woe Jerry went on into anger.  He stalked stiff-legged, with a\nsnarl writhen on his lips, and with recurrent waves of hair-bristling\nalong his back and up his shoulders and neck.  And he stalked not the\nhead of Skipper, where rested his love, but Bashti, who held the head on\nhis knees.  As the wild wolf in the upland pasture stalks the mare mother\nwith her newly delivered colt, so Jerry stalked Bashti.  And Bashti, who\nhad never feared death all his long life and who had laughed a joke with\nhis forefinger blown off by the bursting flint-lock pistol, smiled\ngleefully to himself, for his glee was intellectual and in admiration of\nthis half-grown puppy whom he rapped on the nose with a short, hardwood\nstick and compelled to keep distance.  No matter how often and fiercely\nJerry rushed him, he met the rush with the stick, and chuckled aloud,\nunderstanding the puppy's courage, marvelling at the stupidity of life\nthat impelled him continually to thrust his nose to the hurt of the\nstick, and that drove him, by passion of remembrance of a dead man to\ndare the pain of the stick again and again.\n\nThis, too, was life, Bashti meditated, as he deftly rapped the screaming\npuppy away from him.  Four-legged life it was, young and silly and hot,\nheart-prompted, that was like any young man making love to his woman in\nthe twilight, or like any young man fighting to the death with any other\nyoung man over a matter of passion, hurt pride, or thwarted desire.  As\nmuch as in the dead head of Van Horn or of any man, he realized that in\nthis live puppy might reside the clue to existence, the solution of the\nriddle.\n\nSo he continued to rap Jerry on the nose away from him, and to marvel at\nthe persistence of the vital something within him that impelled him to\nleap forward always to the stick that hurt him and made him recoil.  The\nvalour and motion, the strength and the unreasoning of youth he knew it\nto be, and he admired it sadly, and envied it, willing to exchange for it\nall his lean grey wisdom if only he could find the way.\n\n\"Some dog, that dog, sure some dog,\" he might have uttered in Van Horn's\nfashion of speech.  Instead, in beche-de-mer, which was as habitual to\nhim as his own Somo speech, he thought:\n\n\"My word, that fella dog no fright along me.\"\n\nBut age wearied sooner of the play, and Bashti put an end to it by\nrapping Jerry heavily behind the ear and stretching him out stunned.  The\nspectacle of the puppy, so alive and raging the moment before, and, the\nmoment after, lying as if dead, caught Bashti's speculative fancy.  The\nstick, with a single sharp rap of it, had effected the change.  Where had\ngone the anger and wit of the puppy?  Was that all it was, the flame of\nthe splinter that could be quenched by any chance gust of air?  One\ninstant Jerry had raged and suffered, snarled and leaped, willed and\ndirected his actions.  The next instant he lay limp and crumpled in the\nlittle death of unconsciousness.  In a brief space, Bashti knew,\nconsciousness, sensation, motion, and direction would flow back into the\nwilted little carcass.  But where, in the meanwhile, at the impact of the\nstick, had gone all the consciousness, and sensitiveness, and will?\n\nBashti sighed wearily, and wearily wrapped the heads in their grass-mat\ncoverings--all but Van Horn's; and hoisted them up in the air to hang\nfrom the roof-beams--to hang as he debated, long after he was dead and\nout if it, even as some of them had so hung from long before his father's\nand his grandfather's time.  The head of Van Horn he left lying on the\nfloor, while he stole out himself to peer in through a crack and see what\nnext the puppy might do.\n\nJerry quivered at first, and in the matter of a minute struggled feebly\nto his feet where he stood swaying and dizzy; and thus Bashti, his eye to\nthe crack, saw the miracle of life flow back through the channels of the\ninert body and stiffen the legs to upstanding, and saw consciousness, the\nmystery of mysteries, flood back inside the head of bone that was covered\nwith hair, smoulder and glow in the opening eyes, and direct the lips to\nwrithe away from the teeth and the throat to vibrate to the snarl that\nhad been interrupted when the stick smashed him down into darkness.\n\nAnd more Bashti saw.  At first, Jerry looked about for his enemy,\ngrowling and bristling his neck hair.  Next, in lieu of his enemy, he saw\nSkipper's head, and crept to it and loved it, kissing with his tongue the\nhard cheeks, the closed lids of the eyes that his love could not open,\nthe immobile lips that would not utter one of the love-words they had\nbeen used to utter to the little dog.\n\nNext, in profound desolation, Jerry set down before Skipper's head,\npointed his nose toward the lofty ridge-pole, and howled mournfully and\nlong.  Finally, sick and subdued, he crept out of the house and away to\nthe house of his devil devil master, where, for the round of twenty-four\nhours, he waked and slept and dreamed centuries of nightmares.\n\nFor ever after in Somo, Jerry feared that grass house of Bashti.  He was\nnot in fear of Bashti.  His fear was indescribable and unthinkable.  In\nthat house was the nothingness of what once was Skipper.  It was the\ntoken of the ultimate catastrophe to life that was wrapped and twisted\ninto every fibre of his heredity.  One step advanced beyond this, Jerry's\nuttermost, the folk of Somo, from the contemplation of death, had\nachieved concepts of the spirits of the dead still living in immaterial\nand supersensuous realms.\n\nAnd thereafter Jerry hated Bashti intensely, as a lord of life who\npossessed and laid on his knees the nothingness of Skipper.  Not that\nJerry reasoned it out.  All dim and vague it was, a sensation, an\nemotion, a feeling, an instinct, an intuition, name it mistily as one\nwill in the misty nomenclature of speech wherein words cheat with the\nimpression of definiteness and lie to the brain an understanding which\nthe brain does not possess.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nThree months more passed; the north-west monsoon, after its half-year of\nbreath, had given way to the south-east trade; and Jerry still continued\nto live in the house of Agno and to have the run of the village.  He had\nput on weight, increased in size, and, protected by the taboo, had become\nself-confident almost to lordliness.  But he had found no master.  Agno\nhad never won a heart-throb from him.  For that matter, Agno had never\ntried to win him.  Nor, in his cold-blooded way, had he ever betrayed his\nhatred of Jerry.\n\nNot even the several old women, the two acolytes, and the fly-flapping\nmaid in Agno's house dreamed that the devil devil doctor hated Jerry.  Nor\ndid Jerry dream it.  To him Agno was a neutral sort of person, a person\nwho did not count.  Those of the household Jerry recognized as slaves or\nservants to Agno, and he knew when they fed him that the food he ate\nproceeded from Agno and was Agno's food.  Save himself, taboo protected,\nall of them feared Agno, and his house was truly a house of fear in which\ncould bloom no love for a stray puppy dog.  The eleven-years' maid might\nhave placed a bid for Jerry's affection, had she not been deterred at the\nstart by Agno, who reprimanded her sternly for presuming to touch or\nfondle a dog of such high taboo.\n\nWhat delayed Agno's plot against Jerry for the half-year of the monsoon\nwas the fact that the season of egg-laying for the megapodes in Bashti's\nprivate laying-yard did not begin until the period of the south-east\ntrades.  And Agno, having early conceived his plot, with the patience\nthat was characteristic of him was content to wait the time.\n\nNow the megapode of the Solomons is a distant cousin to the brush turkey\nof Australia.  No larger than a large pigeon, it lays an egg the size of\na domestic duck's.  The megapode, with no sense of fear, is so silly that\nit would have been annihilated hundreds of centuries before had it not\nbeen preserved by the taboos of the chiefs and priests.  As it was, the\nchiefs were compelled to keep cleared patches of sand for it, and to\nfence out the dogs.  It buried its eggs two feet deep, depending on the\nheat of the sun for the hatching.  And it would dig and lay, and continue\nto dig and lay, while a black dug out its eggs within two or three feet\nof it.\n\nThe laying-yard was Bashti's.  During the season, he lived almost\nentirely on megapode eggs.  On rare occasion he even had megapodes that\nwere near to finishing their laying killed for his kai-kai.  This was no\nmore than a whim, however, prompted by pride in such exclusiveness of\ndiet only possible to one in such high place.  In truth, he cared no more\nfor megapode meat than for any other meat.  All meat tasted alike to him,\nfor his taste for meat was one of the vanished pleasures in the limbo of\nmemory.\n\nBut the eggs!  He liked to eat them.  They were the only article of food\nhe liked to eat, They gave him reminiscent thrills of the ancient food-\ndesires of his youth.  Actually was he hungry when he had megapode eggs,\nand the well-nigh dried founts of saliva and of internal digestive juices\nwere stimulated to flow again at contemplation of a megapode egg prepared\nfor the eating.  Wherefore, he alone of all Somo, barred rigidly by\ntaboo, ate megapode eggs.  And, since the taboo was essentially\nreligious, to Agno was deputed the ecclesiastical task of guarding and\ncherishing and caring for the royal laying-yard.\n\nBut Agno was no longer young.  The acid bite of belly desire had long\nsince deserted him, and he, too, ate from a sense of duty, all meat\ntasting alike to him.  Megapode eggs only stung his taste alive and\nstimulated the flow of his juices.  Thus it was that he broke the taboos\nhe imposed, and, privily, before the eyes of no man, woman, or child ate\nthe eggs he stole from Bashti's private preserve.\n\nSo it was, as the laying season began, and when both Bashti and Agno were\nacutely egg-yearning after six months of abstinence, that Agno led Jerry\nalong the taboo path through the mangroves, where they stepped from root\nto root above the muck that ever steamed and stank in the stagnant air\nwhere the wind never penetrated.\n\nThe path, which was not an ordinary path and which consisted, for a man,\nin wide strides from root to root, and for a dog in four-legged leaps and\nplunges, was new to Jerry.  In all his ranging of Somo, because it was so\nunusual a path, he had never discovered it.  The unbending of Agno, thus\nto lead him, was a surprise and a delight to Jerry, who, without\nreasoning about it, in a vague way felt the preliminary sensations that\npossibly Agno, in a small way, might prove the master which his dog's\nsoul continually sought.\n\nEmerging from the swamp of mangroves, abruptly they came upon a patch of\nsand, still so salt and inhospitable from the sea's deposit that no great\ntrees rooted and interposed their branches between it and the sun's heat.\nA primitive gate gave entrance, but Agno did not take Jerry through it.\nInstead, with weird little chirrupings of encouragement and excitation,\nhe persuaded Jerry to dig a tunnel beneath the rude palisade of fence.  He\nhelped with his own hands, dragging out the sand in quantities, but\nimposing on Jerry the leaving of the indubitable marks of a dog's paws\nand claws.\n\nAnd, when Jerry was inside, Agno, passing through the gate, enticed and\nseduced him into digging out the eggs.  But Jerry had no taste of the\neggs.  Eight of them Agno sucked raw, and two of them he tucked whole\ninto his arm-pits to take back to his house of the devil devils.  The\nshells of the eight he sucked he broke to fragments as a dog might break\nthem, and, to build the picture he had long visioned, of the eighth egg\nhe reserved a tiny portion which he spread, not on Jerry's jowls where\nhis tongue could have erased it, but high up about his eyes and above\nthem, where it would remain and stand witness against him according to\nthe plot he had planned.\n\nEven worse, in high priestly sacrilege, he encouraged Jerry to attack a\nmegapode hen in the act of laying.  And, while Jerry slew it, knowing\nthat the lust of killing, once started, would lead him to continue\nkilling the silly birds, Agno left the laying-yard to hot-foot it through\nthe mangrove swamp and present to Bashti an ecclesiastical quandary.  The\ntaboo of the dog, as he expounded it, had prevented him from interfering\nwith the taboo dog when it ate the taboo egg-layers.  Which taboo might\nbe the greater was beyond him.  And Bashti, who had not tasted a megapode\negg in half a year, and who was keen for the one recrudescent thrill of\nremote youth still left to him, led the way back across the mangrove\nswamp at so prodigious a pace as quite to wind his high priest who was\nmany years younger than he.\n\nAnd he arrived at the laying-yard and caught Jerry, red-pawed and red-\nmouthed, in the midst of his fourth kill of an egg-layer, the raw yellow\nyolk of the portion of one egg, plastered by Agno to represent many eggs,\nstill about his eyes and above his eyes to the bulge of his forehead.  In\nvain Bashti looked about for one egg, the six months' hunger stronger\nthan ever upon him in the thick of the disaster.  And Jerry, under the\nconsent and encouragement of Agno, wagged his tail to Bashti in a bid for\nrecognition, of prowess, and laughed with his red-dripping jowls and\nyellow plastered eyes.\n\nBashti did not rage as he would have done had he been alone.  Before the\neyes of his chief priest he disdained to lower himself to such commonness\nof humanity.  Thus it is always with those in the high places, ever\ntemporising with their natural desires, ever masking their ordinariness\nunder a show of disinterest.  So it was that Bashti displayed no vexation\nat the disappointment to his appetite.  Agno was a shade less controlled,\nfor he could not quite chase away the eager light in his eyes.  Bashti\nglimpsed it and mistook it for simple curiosity of observation not\nguessing its real nature.  Which goes to show two things of those in the\nhigh place: one, that they may fool those beneath them; the other, that\nthey may be fooled by those beneath them.\n\nBashti regarded Jerry quizzically, as if the matter were a joke, and shot\na careless side glance to note the disappointment in his priest's eyes.\nAh, ha, thought Bashti; I have fooled him.\n\n\"Which is the high taboo?\" Agno queried in the Somo tongue.\n\n\"As you should ask.  Of a surety, the megapode.\"\n\n\"And the dog?\" was Agno's next query.\n\n\"Must pay for breaking the taboo.  It is a high taboo.  It is my taboo.\nIt was so placed by Somo, the ancient father and first ruler of all of\nus, and it has been ever since the taboo of the chiefs.  The dog must\ndie.\"\n\nHe paused and considered the matter, while Jerry returned to digging the\nsand where the scent was auspicious.  Agno made to stop him, but Bashti\ninterposed.\n\n\"Let be,\" he said.  \"Let the dog convict himself before my eyes.\"\n\nAnd Jerry did, uncovering two eggs, breaking them and lapping that\nportion of their precious contents which was not spilled and wasted in\nthe sand.  Bashti's eyes were quite lack-lustre as he asked\n\n\"The feast of dogs for the men is to-day?\"\n\n\"To-morrow, at midday,\" Agno answered.  \"Already are the dogs coming in.\nThere will be at least fifty of them.\"\n\n\"Fifty and one,\" was Bashti's verdict, as he nodded at Jerry.\n\nThe priest made a quick movement of impulse to capture Jerry.\n\n\"Why now?\" the chief demanded.  \"You will but have to carry him through\nthe swamp.  Let him trot back on his own legs, and when he is before the\ncanoe house tie his legs there.\"\n\nAcross the swamp and approaching the canoe house, Jerry, trotting happily\nat the heels of the two men, heard the wailing and sorrowing of many dogs\nthat spelt unmistakable woe and pain.  He developed instant suspicion\nthat was, however, without direct apprehension for himself.  And at that\nmoment, his ears cocked forward and his nose questing for further\ninformation in the matter, Bashti seized him by the nape of the neck and\nheld him in the air while Agno proceeded to tie his legs.\n\nNo whimper, nor sound, nor sign of fear, came from Jerry--only choking\ngrowls of ferociousness, intermingled with snarls of anger, and a\nbelligerent up-clawing of hind-legs.  But a dog, clutched by the neck\nfrom the back, can never be a match for two men, gifted with the\nintelligence and deftness of men, each of them two-handed with four\nfingers and an opposable thumb to each hand.\n\nHis fore-legs and hind-legs tied lengthwise and crosswise, he was carried\nhead-downward the short distance to the place of slaughter and cooking,\nand flung to the earth in the midst of the score or more of dogs\nsimilarly tied and helpless.  Although it was mid-afternoon, a number of\nthem had so lain since early morning in the hot sun.  They were all bush\ndogs or wild-dogs, and so small was their courage that their thirst and\nphysical pain from cords drawn too tight across veins and arteries, and\ntheir dim apprehension of the fate such treatment foreboded, led them to\nwhimper and wail and howl their despair and suffering.\n\nThe next thirty hours were bad hours for Jerry.  The word had gone forth\nimmediately that the taboo on him had been removed, and of the men and\nboys none was so low as to do him reverence.  About him, till night-fall,\npersisted a circle of teasers and tormenters.  They harangued him for his\nfall, sneered and jeered at him, rooted him about contemptuously with\ntheir feet, made a hollow in the sand out of which he could not roll and\ndesposited him in it on his back, his four tied legs sticking\nignominiously in the air above him.\n\nAnd all he could do was growl and rage his helplessness.  For, unlike the\nother dogs, he would not howl or whimper his pain.  A year old now, the\nlast six months had gone far toward maturing him, and it was the nature\nof his breed to be fearless and stoical.  And, much as he had been taught\nby his white masters to hate and despise niggers, he learned in the\ncourse of these thirty hours an especially bitter and undying hatred.\n\nHis torturers stopped at nothing.  Even they brought wild-dog and set him\nupon Jerry.  But it was contrary to wild-dog's nature to attack an enemy\nthat could not move, even if the enemy was Jerry who had so often bullied\nhim and rolled him on the deck.  Had Jerry, with a broken leg or so,\nstill retained power of movement, then he would have mauled him, perhaps\nto death.  But this utter helplessness was different.  So the expected\nshow proved a failure.  When Jerry snarled and growled, wild-dog snarled\nand growled back and strutted and bullied around him, him to persuasion\nof the blacks could induce but no sink his teeth into Jerry.\n\nThe killing-ground before the canoe house was a bedlam of horror.  From\ntime to time more bound dogs were brought in and flung down.  There was a\ncontinuous howling, especially contributed to by those which had lain in\nthe sun since early morning and had no water.  At times, all joined in,\nthe control of the quietest breaking down before the wave of excitement\nand fear that swept spasmodically over all of them.  This howling, rising\nand falling, but never ceasing, continued throughout the night, and by\nmorning all were suffering from the intolerable thirst.\n\nThe sun blazing down upon them in the white sand and almost parboiling\nthem, brought anything but relief.  The circle of torturers formed about\nJerry again, and again was wreaked upon him all abusive contempt for\nhaving lost his taboo.  What drove Jerry the maddest were not the blows\nand physical torment, but the laughter.  No dog enjoys being laughed at,\nand Jerry, least of all, could restrain his wrath when they jeered him\nand cackled close in his face.\n\nAlthough he had not howled once, his snarling and growling, combined with\nhis thirst, had hoarsened his throat and dried the mucous membranes of\nhis mouth so that he was incapable, except under the sheerest\nprovocation, of further sound.  His tongue hung out of his mouth, and the\neight o'clock sun began slowly to burn it.\n\nIt was at this time that one of the boys cruelly outraged him.  He rolled\nJerry out of the hollow in which he had lain all night on his back,\nturned him over on his side, and presented to him a small calabash filled\nwith water.  Jerry lapped it so fanatically that not for half a minute\ndid he become aware that the boy had squeezed into it many hot seeds of\nripe red peppers.  The circle shrieked with glee, and what Jerry's thirst\nhad been before was as nothing compared with this new thirst to which had\nbeen added the stinging agony of pepper.\n\nNext in event, and a most important event it was to prove, came Nalasu.\nNalasu was an old man of three-score years, and he was blind, walking\nwith a large staff with which he prodded his path.  In his free hand he\ncarried a small pig by its tied legs.\n\n\"They say the white master's dog is to be eaten,\" he said in the Somo\nspeech.  \"Where is the white master's dog?  Show him to me.\"\n\nAgno, who had just arrived, stood beside him as he bent over Jerry and\nexamined him with his fingers.  Nor did Jerry offer to snarl or bite,\nalthough the blind man's hands came within reach of his teeth more than\nonce.  For Jerry sensed no enmity in the fingers that passed so softly\nover him.  Next, Nalasu felt over the pig, and several times, as if\ncalculating, alternated between Jerry and the pig.\n\nNalasu stood up and voiced judgment:\n\n\"The pig is as small as the dog.  They are of a size, but the pig has\nmore meat on it for the eating.  Take the pig and I shall take the dog.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Agno.  \"The white master's dog has broken the taboo.  It must\nbe eaten.  Take any other dog and leave the pig.  Take a big dog.\"\n\n\"I will have the white master's dog,\" Nalasu persisted.  \"Only the white\nmaster's dog and no other.\"\n\nThe matter was at a deadlock when Bashti chanced upon the scene and stood\nlistening.\n\n\"Take the dog, Nalasu,\" he said finally.  \"It is a good pig, and I shall\nmyself eat it.\"\n\n\"But he has broken the taboo, your great taboo of the laying-yard, and\nmust go to the eating,\" Agno interposed quickly.\n\nToo quickly, Bashti thought, while a vague suspicion arose in his mind of\nhe knew not what.\n\n\"The taboo must be paid in blood and cooking,\" Agno continued.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Bashti.  \"I shall eat the small pig.  Let its throat be\ncut and its body know the fire.\"\n\n\"I but speak the law of the taboo.  Life must pay for the breaking.\"\n\n\"There is another law,\" Bashti grinned.  \"Long has it been since ever\nSomo built these walls that life may buy life.\"\n\n\"But of life of man and life of woman,\" Agno qualified.\n\n\"I know the law,\" Bashti held steadily on.  \"Somo made the law.  Never\nhas it been said that animal life may not buy animal life.\"\n\n\"It has never been practised,\" was the devil devil doctor's fling.\n\n\"And for reason enough,\" the old chief retorted.  \"Never before has a man\nbeen fool enough to give a pig for a dog.  It is a young pig, and it is\nfat and tender.  Take the dog, Nalasu.  Take the dog now.\"\n\nBut the devil devil doctor was not satisfied.\n\n\"As you said, O Bashti, in your very great wisdom, he is the seed dog of\nstrength and courage.  Let him be slain.  When he comes from the fire,\nhis body shall be divided into many small pieces so that every man may\neat of him and thereby get his portion of strength and courage.  Better\nis it for Somo that its men be strong and brave rather than its dogs.\"\n\nBut Bashti held no anger against Jerry.  He had lived too long and too\nphilosophically to lay blame on a dog for breaking a taboo which it did\nnot know.  Of course, dogs often were slain for breaking the taboos.  But\nhe allowed this to be done because the dogs themselves in nowise\ninterested him, and because their deaths emphasized the sacredness of the\ntaboo.  Further, Jerry had more than slightly interested him.  Often,\nsince, Jerry had attacked him because of Van Horn's head, he had pondered\nthe incident.  Baffling as it was, as all manifestations of life were\nbaffling, it had given him food for thought.  Then there was his\nadmiration for Jerry's courage and that inexplicable something in him\nthat prevented him crying out from the pain of the stick.  And, without\nthinking of it as beauty, the beauty of line and colour of Jerry had\ninsensibly penetrated him with a sense of pleasantness.  It was good to\nlook upon.\n\nThere was another angle to Bashti's conduct.  He wondered why his devil\ndevil doctor so earnestly desired a mere dog's death.  There were many\ndogs.  Then why this particular dog?  That the weight of something was on\nthe other's mind was patent, although what it was Bashti could not gauge,\nguess--unless it might be revenge incubated the day he had prevented Agno\nfrom eating the dog.  If such were the case, it was a state of mind he\ncould not tolerate in any of his tribespeople.  But whatever was the\nmotive, guarding as he always did against the unknown, he thought it well\nto discipline his priest and demonstrate once again whose word was the\nlast word in Somo.  Wherefore Bashti replied:\n\n\"I have lived long and eaten many pigs.  What man may dare say that the\nmany pigs have entered into me and made me a pig?\"\n\nHe paused and cast a challenging eye around the circle of his audience;\nbut no man spoke.  Instead, some men grinned sheepishly and were restless\non their feet, while Agno's expression advertised sturdy unbelief that\nthere was anything pig-like about his chief.\n\n\"I have eaten much fish,\" Bashti continued.  \"Never has one scale of a\nfish grown out on my skin.  Never has a gill appeared on my throat.  As\nyou all know, by the looking, never have I sprouted one fin out of my\nbackbone.--Nalasu, take the dog.--Aga, carry the pig to my house.  I\nshall eat it to-day.--Agno, let the killing of the dogs begin so that the\ncanoe-men shall eat at due time.\"\n\nThen, as he turned to go, he lapsed into beche-de-mer English and flung\nsternly over his shoulder, \"My word, you make 'm me cross along you.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nAs blind Nalasu slowly plodded away, with one hand tapping the path\nbefore him and with the other carrying Jerry head-downward suspended by\nhis tied legs, Jerry heard a sudden increase in the wild howling of the\ndogs as the killing began and they realized that death was upon them.\n\nBut, unlike the boy Lamai, who had known no better, the old man did not\ncarry Jerry all the way to his house.  At the first stream pouring down\nbetween the low hills of the rising land, he paused and put Jerry down to\ndrink.  And Jerry knew only the delight of the wet coolness on his\ntongue, all about his mouth, and down his throat.  Nevertheless, in his\nsubconsciousness was being planted the impression that, kinder than\nLamai, than Agno, than Bashti, this was the kindest black he had\nencountered in Somo.\n\nWhen he had drunk till for the moment he could drink no more, he thanked\nNalasu with his tongue--not warmly nor ecstatically as had it been\nSkipper's hand, but with due gratefulness for the life-giving draught.\nThe old man chuckled in a pleased way, rolled Jerry's parched body into\nthe water, and, keeping his head above the surface, rubbed the water into\nhis dry skin and let him lie there for long blissful minutes.\n\nFrom the stream to Nalasu's house, a goodly distance, Nalasu still\ncarried him with bound legs, although not head-downward but clasped in\none arm against his chest.  His idea was to love the dog to him.  For\nNalasu, having sat in the lonely dark for many years, had thought far\nmore about the world around him and knew it far better than had he been\nable to see it.  For his own special purpose he had need of a dog.\nSeveral bush dogs he had tried, but they had shown little appreciation of\nhis kindness and had invariably run away.  The last had remained longest\nbecause he had treated it with the greatest kindness, but run away it had\nbefore he had trained it to his purpose.  But the white master's dog, he\nhad heard, was different.  It never ran away in fear, while it was said\nto be more intelligent than the dogs of Somo.\n\nThe invention Lamai had made of tying Jerry with a stick had been noised\nabroad in the village, and by a stick, in Nalasu's house, Jerry found\nhimself again tied.  But with a difference.  Never once was the blind man\nimpatient, while he spent hours each day in squatting on his hams and\npetting Jerry.  Yet, had he not done this, Jerry, who ate his food and\nwho was growing accustomed to changing his masters, would have accepted\nNalasu for master.  Further, it was fairly definite in Jerry's mind,\nafter the devil devil doctor's tying him and flinging him amongst the\nother helpless dogs on the killing-ground, that all mastership of Agno\nhad ceased.  And Jerry, who had never been without a master since his\nfirst days in the world, felt the imperative need of a master.\n\nSo it was, when the day came that the stick was untied from him, that\nJerry remained, voluntarily in Nalasu's house.  When the old man was\nsatisfied there would be no running away, he began Jerry's training.  By\nslow degrees he advanced the training until hours a day were devoted to\nit.\n\nFirst of all Jerry learned a new name for himself, which was Bao, and he\nwas taught to respond to it from an ever-increasing distance no matter\nhow softly it was uttered, and Nalasu continued to utter it more softly\nuntil it no longer was a spoken word, but a whisper.  Jerry's ears were\nkeen, but Nalasu's, from long use, were almost as keen.\n\nFurther, Jerry's own hearing was trained to still greater acuteness.\nHours at a time, sitting by Nalasu or standing apart from him, he was\ntaught to catch the slightest sounds or rustlings from the bush.  Still\nfurther, he was taught to differentiate between the bush noises and\nbetween the ways he growled warnings to Nalasu.  If a rustle took place\nthat Jerry identified as a pig or a chicken, he did not growl at all.  If\nhe did not identify the noise, he growled fairly softly.  But if the\nnoise were made by a man or boy who moved softly and therefore\nsuspiciously, Jerry learned to growl loudly; if the noise were loud and\ncareless, then Jerry's growl was soft.\n\nIt never entered Jerry's mind to question why he was taught all this.  He\nmerely did it because it was this latest master's desire that he should.\nAll this, and much more, at a cost of interminable time and patience,\nNalasu taught him, and much more he taught him, increasing his vocabulary\nso that, at a distance, they could hold quick and sharply definite\nconversations.\n\nThus, at fifty feet away, Jerry would \"Whuff!\" softly the information\nthat there was a noise he did not know; and Nalasu, with different\nsibilances, would hiss to him to stand still, to whuff more softly, or to\nkeep silent, or to come to him noiselessly, or to go into the bush and\ninvestigate the source of the strange noise, or, barking loudly, to rush\nand attack it.\n\nPerhaps, if from the opposite direction Nalasu's sharp ears alone caught\na strange sound, he would ask Jerry if he had heard it.  And Jerry, alert\nto his toes to listen, by an alteration in the quantity or quality of his\nwhuff, would tell Nalasu that he did not hear; next, that he did hear;\nand, perhaps finally, that it was a strange dog, or a wood-rat, or a man,\nor a boy--all in the softest of sounds that were scarcely more than\nbreath-exhalations, all monosyllables, a veritable shorthand of speech.\n\nNalasu was a strange old man.  He lived by himself in a small grass house\non the edge of the village.  The nearest house was quite a distance away,\nwhile his own stood in a clearing in the thick jungle which approached no\nwhere nearer than sixty feet.  Also, this cleared space he kept\ncontinually free from the fast-growing vegetation.  Apparently he had no\nfriends.  At least no visitors ever came to his dwelling.  Years had\npassed since he discouraged the last.  Further, he had no kindred.  His\nwife was long since dead, and his three sons, not yet married, in a foray\nbehind the bounds of Somo had lost their heads in the jungle runways of\nthe higher hills and been devoured by their bushman slayers.\n\nFor a blind man he was very busy.  He asked favour of no one and was self-\nsupporting.  In his house-clearing he grew yams, sweet potatoes, and\ntaro.  In another clearing--because it was his policy to have no trees\nclose to his house--he had plantains, bananas, and half a dozen coconut\npalms.  Fruits and vegetables he exchanged down in the village for meat\nand fish and tobacco.\n\nHe spent a good portion of his time on Jerry's education, and, on\noccasion, would make bows and arrows that were so esteemed by his\ntribespeople as to command a steady sale.  Scarcely a day passed in which\nhe did not himself practise with bow and arrow.  He shot only by\ndirection of sound; and whenever a noise or rustle was heard in the\njungle, and when Jerry had informed him of its nature, he would shoot an\narrow at it.  Then it was Jerry's duty cautiously to retrieve the arrow\nhad it missed the mark.\n\nA curious thing about Nalasu was that he slept no more than three hours\nin the twenty-four, that he never slept at night, and that his brief\ndaylight sleep never took place in the house.  Hidden in the thickest\npart of the neighbouring jungle was a sort of nest to which led no path.\nHe never entered nor left by the same way, so that the tropic growth on\nthe rich soil, being so rarely trod upon, ever obliterated the slightest\nsign of his having passed that way.  Whenever he slept, Jerry was trained\nto remain on guard and never to go to sleep.\n\nReason enough there was and to spare for Nalasu's infinite precaution.\nThe oldest of his three sons had slain one, Ao, in a quarrel.  Ao had\nbeen one of six brothers of the family of Anno which dwelt in one of the\nupper villages.  According to Somo law, the Anno family was privileged to\ncollect the blood-debt from the Nalasu family, but had been balked of it\nby the deaths of Nalasu's three sons in the bush.  And, since the Somo\ncode was a life for a life, and since Nalasu alone remained alive of his\nfamily, it was well known throughout the tribe that the Annos would never\nbe content until they had taken the blind man's life.\n\nBut Nalasu had been famous as a great fighter, as well as having been the\nprogenitor of three such warlike sons.  Twice had the Annos sought to\ncollect, the first time while Nalasu still retained his eyesight.  Nalasu\nhad discovered their trap, circled about it, and in the rear encountered\nand slain Anno himself, the father, thus doubling the blood-debt.\n\nThen had come his accident.  While refilling many-times used Snider\ncartridges, an explosion of black powder put out both his eyes.\nImmediately thereafter, while he sat nursing his wounds, the Annos had\ndescended upon him--just what he had expected.  And for which he had made\ndue preparation.  That night two uncles and another brother stepped on\npoisoned thorns and died horribly.  Thus the sum of lives owing the Annos\nhad increased to five, with only a blind man from whom to collect.\n\nThenceforth the Annos had feared the thorns too greatly to dare again,\nalthough ever their vindictiveness smouldered and they lived in hope of\nthe day when Nalasu's head should adorn their ridgepole.  In the meantime\nthe state of affairs was not that of a truce but of a stalemate.  The old\nman could not proceed against them, and they were afraid to proceed\nagainst him.  Nor did the day come until after Jerry's adoption, when one\nof the Annos made an invention the like of which had never been known in\nall Malaita.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nMeanwhile the months slipped by, the south-east trade blew itself out,\nthe monsoon had begun to breathe, and Jerry added to himself six months\nof time, weight, stature, and thickness of bone.  An easy time his half-\nyear with the blind man had been, despite the fact that Nalasu was a\nrigid disciplinarian who insisted on training Jerry for longer hours, day\nin and day out, than falls to the lot of most dogs.  Never did Jerry\nreceive from him a blow, never a harsh word.  This man, who had slain\nfour of the Annos, three of them after he had gone blind, who had slain\nstill more men in his savage youth, never raised his voice in anger to\nJerry and ruled him by nothing severer than the gentlest of chidings.\n\nMentally, the persistent education Jerry received, in this period of late\npuppyhood, fixed in him increased brain power for all his life.  Possibly\nno dog in all the world had ever been so vocal as he, and for three\nreasons: his own intelligence, the genius for teaching that was Nalasu's,\nand the long hours devoted to the teaching.\n\nHis shorthand vocabulary, for a dog, was prodigious.  Almost might it be\nsaid that he and the man could talk by the hour, although few and simple\nwere the abstractions they could talk; very little of the immediate\nconcrete past, and scarcely anything of the immediate concrete future,\nentered into their conversations.  Jerry could no more tell him of\nMeringe, nor of the _Arangi_, than could he tell him of the great love he\nhad borne Skipper, or of his reason for hating Bashti.  By the same\ntoken, Nalasu could not tell Jerry of the blood-feud with the Annos, nor\nof how he had lost his eyesight.\n\nPractically all their conversation was confined to the instant present,\nalthough they could compass a little of the very immediate past.  Nalasu\nwould give Jerry a series of instructions, such as, going on a scout by\nhimself, to go to the nest, then circle about it widely, to continue to\nthe other clearing where were the fruit trees, to cross the jungle to the\nmain path, to proceed down the main path toward the village till he came\nto the great banyan tree, and then to return along the small path to\nNalasu and Nalasu's house.  All of which Jerry would carry out to the\nletter, and, arrived back, would make report.  As, thus: at the nest\nnothing unusual save that a buzzard was near it; in the other clearing\nthree coconuts had fallen to the ground--for Jerry could count unerringly\nup to five; between the other clearing and the main path were four pigs;\nalong the main path he had passed a dog, more than five women, and two\nchildren; and on the small path home he had noted a cockatoo and two\nboys.\n\nBut he could not tell Nalasu his states of mind and heart that prevented\nhim from being fully contented in his present situation.  For Nalasu was\nnot a white-god, but only a mere nigger god.  And Jerry hated and\ndespised all niggers save for the two exceptions of Lamai and Nalasu.  He\ntolerated them, and, for Nalasu, had even developed a placid and sweet\naffection.  Love him he did not and could not.\n\nAt the best, they were only second-rate gods, and he could not forget the\ngreat white-gods such as Skipper and Mister Haggin, and, of the same\nbreed, Derby and Bob.  They were something else, something other,\nsomething better than all this black savagery in which he lived.  They\nwere above and beyond, in an unattainable paradise which he vividly\nremembered, for which he yearned, but to which he did not know the way,\nand which, dimly sensing the ending that comes to all things, might have\npassed into the ultimate nothingness which had already overtaken Skipper\nand the _Arangi_.\n\nIn vain did the old man play to gain Jerry's heart of love.  He could not\nbid against Jerry's many reservations and memories, although he did win\nabsolute faithfulness and loyalty.  Not passionately, as he would have\nfought to the death for Skipper, but devotedly would he have fought to\nthe death for Nalasu.  And the old man never dreamed but what he had won\nall of Jerry's heart.\n\n* * * * *\n\nCame the day of the Annos, when one of them made the invention, which was\nthick-plaited sandals to armour the soles of their feet against the\npoisoned thorns with which Nalasu had taken three of their lives.  The\nday, in truth, was the night, a black night, a night so black under a\ncloud-palled sky that a tree-trunk could not be seen an eighth of an inch\nbeyond one's nose.  And the Annos descended on Nalasu's clearing, a dozen\nof them, armed with Sniders, horse pistols, tomahawks and war clubs,\nwalking gingerly, despite their thick sandals, because of fear of the\nthorns which Nalasu no longer planted.\n\nJerry, sitting between Nalasu's knees and nodding sleepily, gave the\nfirst warning to Nalasu, who sat outside his door, wide-eyed, ear-strung,\nas he had sat through all the nights of the many years.  He listened\nstill more tensely through long minutes in which he heard nothing, at the\nsame time whispering to Jerry for information and commanding him to be\nsoft-spoken; and Jerry, with whuffs and whiffs and all the short-hand\nbreath-exhalations of speech he had been taught, told him that men\napproached, many men, more men than five.\n\nNalasu reached the bow beside him, strung an arrow, and waited.  At last\nhis own ears caught the slightest of rustlings, now here, now there,\nadvancing upon him in the circle of the compass.  Still speaking for\nsoftness, he demanded verification from Jerry, whose neck hair rose\nbristling under Nalasu's sensitive fingers, and who, by this time, was\nreading the night air with his nose as well as his ears.  And Jerry, as\nsoftly as Nalasu, informed him again that it was men, many men, more men\nthan five.\n\nWith the patience of age Nalasu sat on without movement, until, close at\nhand, on the very edge of the jungle, sixty feet away, he located a\nparticular noise of a particular man.  He stretched his bow, loosed the\narrow, and was rewarded by a gasp and a groan strangely commingled.  First\nhe restrained Jerry from retrieving the arrow, which he knew had gone\nhome; and next he fitted a fresh arrow to the bow string.\n\nFifteen minutes of silence passed, the blind man as if carven of stone,\nthe dog, trembling with eagerness under the articulate touch of his\nfingers, obeying the bidding to make no sound.  For Jerry, as well as\nNalasu, knew that death rustled and lurked in the encircling dark.  Again\ncame a softness of movement, nearer than before; but the sped arrow\nmissed.  They heard its impact against a tree trunk beyond and a\nconfusion of small sounds caused by the target's hasty retreat.  Next,\nafter a time of silence, Nalasu told Jerry silently to retrieve the\narrow.  He had been well trained and long trained, for with no sound even\nto Nalasu's ears keener than seeing men's ears, he followed the direction\nof the arrow's impact against the tree and brought the arrow back in his\nmouth.\n\nAgain Nalasu waited, until the rustlings of a fresh drawing-in of the\ncircle could be heard, whereupon Nalasu, Jerry accompanying him, picked\nup all his arrows and moved soundlessly half-way around the circle.  Even\nas they moved, a Snider exploded that was aimed in the general direction\nof the spot just vacated.\n\nAnd the blind man and the dog, from midnight to dawn, successfully fought\noff twelve men equipped with the thunder of gunpowder and the\nwide-spreading, deep-penetrating, mushroom bullets of soft lead.  And the\nblind man defended himself only with a bow and a hundred arrows.  He\ndischarged many hundreds of arrows which Jerry retrieved for him and\nwhich he discharged over and over.  But Jerry aided valiantly and well,\nadding to Nalasu's acute hearing his own acuter hearing, circling\nnoiselessly about the house and reporting where the attack pressed\nclosest.\n\nMuch of their precious powder the Annos wasted, for the affair was like a\ngame of invisible ghosts.  Never was anything seen save the flashes of\nthe rifles.  Never did they see Jerry, although they became quickly aware\nof his movements close to them as he searched out the arrows.  Once, as\none of them felt for an arrow which had narrowly missed him, he\nencountered Jerry's back with his hand and acknowledged the sharp slash\nof Jerry's teeth with a wild yell of terror.  They tried firing at the\ntwang of Nalasu's bowstring, but every time Nalasu fired he instantly\nchanged position.  Several times, warned of Jerry's nearness, they fired\nat him, and, once even, was his nose slightly powder burned.\n\nWhen day broke, in the quick tropic grey that marks the leap from dark to\nsun, the Annos retreated, while Nalasu, withdrawn from the light into his\nhouse, still possessed eighty arrows, thanks to Jerry.  The net result to\nNalasu was one dead man and no telling how many arrow-pricked wounded men\nwho dragged themselves away.\n\nAnd half the day Nalasu crouched over Jerry, fondling and caressing him\nfor what he had done.  Then he went abroad, Jerry with him, and told of\nthe battle.  Bashti paid him a visit ere the day was done, and talked\nwith him earnestly.\n\n\"As an old man to an old man, I talk,\" was Bashti's beginning.  \"I am\nolder than you, O Nalasu; I have ever been unafraid.  Yet never have I\nbeen braver than you.  I would that every man of the tribe were as brave\nas you.  Yet do you give me great sorrow.  Of what worth are your courage\nand cunning, when you have no seed to make your courage and cunning live\nagain?\"\n\n\"I am an old man,\" Nalasu began.\n\n\"Not so old as I am,\" Bashti interrupted.  \"Not too old to marry so that\nyour seed will add strength to the tribe.\"\n\n\"I was married, and long married, and I fathered three brave sons.  But\nthey are dead.  I shall not live so long as you.  I think of my young\ndays as pleasant dreams remembered after sleep.  More I think of death,\nand the end.  Of marriage I think not at all.  I am too old to marry.  I\nam old enough to make ready to die, and a great curiousness have I about\nwhat will happen to me when I am dead.  Will I be for ever dead?  Will I\nlive again in a land of dreams--a shadow of a dream myself that will\nstill remember the days when I lived in the warm world, the quick juices\nof hunger in my mouth, in the chest of the body of me the love of woman?\"\n\nBashti shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"I too, have thought much on the matter,\" he said.  \"Yet do I arrive\nnowhere.  I do not know.  You do not know.  We will not know until we are\ndead, if it happens that we know anything when what we are we no longer\nare.  But this we know, you and I: the tribe lives.  The tribe never\ndies.  Wherefore, if there be meaning at all to our living, we must make\nthe tribe strong.  Your work in the tribe is not done.  You must marry so\nthat your cunning and your courage live after you.  I have a wife for\nyou--nay, two wives, for your days are short and I shall surely live to\nsee you hang with my fathers from the canoe-house ridgepole.\"\n\n\"I will not pay for a wife,\" Nalasu protested.  \"I will not pay for any\nwife.  I would not pay a stick of tobacco or a cracked coconut for the\nbest woman in Somo.\"\n\n\"Worry not,\" Bashti went on placidly.  \"I shall pay you for the price of\nthe wife, of the two wives.  There is Bubu.  For half a case of tobacco\nshall I buy her for you.  She is broad and square, round-legged, broad-\nhipped, with generous breasts of richness.  There is Nena.  Her father\nsets a stiff price upon her--a whole case of tobacco.  I will buy her for\nyou as well.  Your time is short.  We must hurry.\"\n\n\"I will not marry,\" the old blind man proclaimed hysterically.\n\n\"You will.  I have spoken.\"\n\n\"No, I say, and say again, no, no, no, no.  Wives are nuisances.  They\nare young things, and their heads are filled with foolishness.  Their\ntongues are loose with idleness of speech.  I am old, I am quiet in my\nways, the fires of life have departed from me, I prefer to sit alone in\nthe dark and think.  Chattering young things about me, with nothing but\nfoam and spume in their heads, on their tongues, would drive me mad.  Of\na surety they would drive me mad--so mad that I will spit into every clam\nshell, make faces at the moon, and bite my veins and howl.\"\n\n\"And if you do, what of it?  So long as your seed does not perish.  I\nshall pay for the wives to their fathers and send them to you in three\ndays.\"\n\n\"I will have nothing to do with them,\" Nalasu asserted wildly.\n\n\"You will,\" Bashti insisted calmly.  \"Because if you do not you will have\nto pay me.  It will be a sore, hard debt.  I will have every joint of you\nunhinged so that you will be like a jelly-fish, like a fat pig with the\nbones removed, and I will then stake you out in the midmost centre of the\ndog-killing ground to swell in pain under the sun.  And what is left of\nyou I shall fling to the dogs to eat.  Your seed shall not perish out of\nSomo.  I, Bashti, so tell you.  In three days I shall send to you your\ntwo wives. . . . \"\n\nHe paused, and a long silence fell upon them.\n\n\"Well?\" Bashti reiterated.  \"It is wives or staking out unhinged in the\nsun.  You choose, but think well before you choose the unhinging.\"\n\n\"At my age, with all the vexations of youngness so far behind me!\" Nalasu\ncomplained.\n\n\"Choose.  You will find there is vexation, and liveliness and much of it,\nin the centre of the dog-killing yard when the sun cooks your sore joints\ntill the grease of the leanness of you bubbles like the tender fat of a\ncooked sucking-pig.\"\n\n\"Then send me the wives,\" Nalasu managed to utter after a long pause.\n\"But send them in three days, not in two, nor to-morrow.\"\n\n\"It is well,\" Bashti nodded gravely.  \"You have lived at all only because\nof those before you, now long in the dark, who worked so that the tribe\nmight live and you might come to be.  You are.  They paid the price for\nyou.  It is your debt.  You came into being with this debt upon you.  You\nwill pay the debt before you pass out of being.  It is the law.  It is\nvery well.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\nAnd had Bashti hastened delivery of the wives by one day, or by even two\ndays, Nalasu would have entered the feared, purgatory of matrimony.  But\nBashti kept his word, and on the third day was too busy, with a more\nmomentous problem, to deliver Bubu and Nena to the blind old man who\napprehensively waited their coming.  For the morning of the third day all\nthe summits of leeward Malaita smoked into speech.  A warship was on the\ncoast--so the tale ran; a big warship that was heading in through the\nreef islands at Langa-Langa.  The tale grew.  The warship was not\nstopping at Langa-Langa.  The warship was not stopping at Binu.  It was\ndirecting its course toward Somo.\n\nNalasu, blind, could not see this smoke speech written in the air.\nBecause of the isolation of his house, no one came and told him.  His\nfirst warning was when shrill voices of women, cries of children, and\nwailings of babes in nameless fear came to him from the main path that\nled from the village to the upland boundaries of Somo.  He read only fear\nand panic from the sounds, deduced that the village was fleeing to its\nmountain fastnesses, but did not know the cause of the flight.\n\nHe called Jerry to him and instructed him to scout to the great banyan\ntree, where Nalasu's path and the main path joined, and to observe and\nreport.  And Jerry sat under the banyan tree and observed the flight of\nall Somo.  Men, women, and children, the young and the aged, babes at\nbreast and patriarchs leaning on sticks and staffs passed before his\neyes, betraying the greatest haste and alarm.  The village dogs were as\nfrightened, whimpering and whining as they ran.  And the contagion of\nterror was strong upon Jerry.  He knew the prod of impulse to join in\nthis rush away from some unthinkably catastrophic event that impended and\nthat stirred his intuitive apprehensions of death.  But he mastered the\nimpulse with his sense of loyalty to the blind man who had fed him and\ncaressed him for a long six months.\n\nBack with Nalasu, sitting between his knees, he made his report.  It was\nimpossible for him to count more than five, although he knew the fleeing\npopulation numbered many times more than five.  So he signified five men,\nand more; five women, and more five children, and more; five babies, and\nmore; five dogs, and more--even of pigs did he announce five and more.\nNalasu's ears told him that it was many, many times more, and he asked\nfor names.  Jerry know the names of Bashti, of Agno, and of Lamai, and\nLumai.  He did not pronounce them with the slightest of resemblance to\ntheir customary soundings, but pronounced them in the whiff-whuff of\nshorthand speech that Nalasu had taught him.\n\nNalasu named over many other names that Jerry knew by ear but could not\nhimself evoke in sound, and he answered yes to most of them by\nsimultaneously nodding his head and advancing his right paw.  To some\nnames he remained without movement in token that he did not know them.\nAnd to other names, which he recognized, but the owners of which he had\nnot seen, he answered no by advancing his left paw.\n\nAnd Nalasu, beyond knowing that something terrible was\nimpending--something horribly more terrible than any foray of\nneighbouring salt-water tribes, which Somo, behind her walls, could\neasily fend off, divined that it was the long-expected punitive man-of-\nwar.  Despite his three-score years, he had never experienced a village\nshelling.  He had heard vague talk of what had happened in the matter of\nshell-fire in other villages, but he had no conception of it save that it\nmust be, bullets on a larger scale than Snider bullets that could be\nfired correspondingly longer distances through the air.\n\nBut it was given to him to know shell-fire before he died.  Bashti, who\nhad long waited the cruiser that was to avenge the destruction of the\n_Arangi_ and the taking of the heads of the two white men, and who had\nlong calculated the damage to be wrought, had given the command to his\npeople to flee to the mountains.  First in the vanguard, borne by a dozen\nyoung men, went his mat-wrapped parcels of heads.  The last slow trailers\nin the rear of the exodus were just passing, and Nalasu, his bow and his\neighty arrows clutched to him, Jerry at his heels, made his first step to\nfollow, when the air above him was rent by a prodigiousness of sound.\n\nNalasu sat down abruptly.  It was his first shell, and it was a thousand\ntimes more terrible than he had imagined.  It was a rip-snorting, sky-\nsplitting sound as of a cosmic fabric being torn asunder between the\nhands of some powerful god.  For all the world it was like the roughest\ntearing across of sheets that were thick as blankets, that were broad as\nthe earth and wide as the sky.\n\nNot only did he sit down just outside his door, but he crouched his head\nto his knees and shielded it with the arch of his arms.  And Jerry, who\nhad never heard shell-fire, much less imagined what it was like, was\nimpressed with the awfulness of it.  It was to him a natural catastrophe\nsuch as had happened to the _Arangi_ when she was flung down reeling on\nher side by the shouting wind.  But, true to his nature, he did not\ncrouch down under the shriek of that first shell.  On the contrary, he\nbristled his hair and snarled up with menacing teeth at whatever the\nthing was which was so enormously present and yet invisible to his eyes.\n\nNalasu crouched closer when the shell burst beyond, and Jerry snarled and\nrippled his hair afresh.  Each repeated his actions with each fresh\nshell, for, while they screamed no more loudly, they burst in the jungle\nmore closely.  And Nalasu, who had lived a long life most bravely in the\nmidst of perils he had known, was destined to die a coward out of his\nfear of the thing unknown, the chemically propelled missile of the white\nmasters.  As the dropping shells burst nearer and nearer, what final self-\ncontrol he possessed left him.  Such was his utter panic that he might\nwell have bitten his veins and howled.  With a lunatic scream, he sprang\nto his feet and rushed inside the house as if forsooth its grass thatch\ncould protect his head from such huge projectiles.  He collided with the\ndoor-jamb, and, ere Jerry could follow him, whirled around in a part\ncircle into the centre of the floor just in time to receive the next\nshell squarely upon his head.\n\nJerry had just gained the doorway when the shell exploded.  The house\nwent into flying fragments, and Nalasu flew into fragments with it.\nJerry, in the doorway, caught in the out-draught of the explosion, was\nflung a score of feet away.  All in the same fraction of an instant,\nearthquake, tidal wave, volcanic eruption, the thunder of the heavens and\nthe fire-flashing of an electric bolt from the sky smote him and smote\nconsciousness out of him.\n\nHe had no conception of how long he lay.  Five minutes passed before his\nlegs made their first spasmodic movements, and, as he stumbled to his\nfeet and rocked giddily, he had no thought of the passage of time.  He\nhad no thought about time at all.  As a matter of course, his own idea,\non which he proceeded to act without being aware of it, was that, a part\nof a second before, he had been struck a terrific blow magnified\nincalculable times beyond the blow of a stick at a nigger's hands.\n\nHis throat and lungs filled with the pungent stifling smoke of powder,\nhis nostrils with earth and dust, he frantically wheezed and sneezed,\nleaping about, falling drunkenly, leaping into the air again, staggering\non his hind-legs, dabbing with his forepaws at his nose head-downward\nbetween his forelegs, and even rubbing his nose into the ground.  He had\nno thought for anything save to remove the biting pain from his nose and\nmouth, the suffocation from his lungs.\n\nBy a miracle he had escaped being struck by the flying splinters of iron,\nand, thanks to his strong heart, had escaped being killed by the shock of\nthe explosion.  Not until the end of five minutes of mad struggling, in\nwhich he behaved for all the world like a beheaded chicken, did he find\nlife tolerable again.  The maximum of stifling and of agony passed, and,\nalthough he was still weak and giddy, he tottered in the direction of the\nhouse and of Nalasu.  And there was no house and no Nalasu--only a debris\nintermingled of both.\n\nWhile the shells continued to shriek and explode, now near, now far,\nJerry investigated the happening.  As surely as the house was gone, just\nas surely was Nalasu gone.  Upon both had descended the ultimate\nnothingness.  All the immediate world seemed doomed to nothingness.  Life\npromised only somewhere else, in the high hills and remote bush whither\nthe tribe had already fled.  Loyal he was to his salt, to the master whom\nhe had obeyed so long, nigger that he was, who so long had fed him, and\nfor whom he had entertained a true affection.  But this master no longer\nwas.\n\nRetreat Jerry did, but he was not hasty in retreat.  For a time he\nsnarled at every shell-scream in the air and every shell-burst in the\nbush.  But after a time, while the awareness of them continued\nuncomfortably with him, the hair on his neck remained laid down and he\nneither uttered a snarl nor bared his teeth.\n\nAnd when he parted from what had been and which had ceased to be, not\nlike the bush dogs did he whimper and run.  Instead, he trotted along the\npath at a regular and dignified pace.  When he emerged upon the main\npath, he found it deserted.  The last refugee had passed.  The path,\nalways travelled from daylight to dark, and which he had so recently seen\nglutted with humans, now in its emptiness affected him profoundly with\nthe impression of the endingness of all things in a perishing world.  So\nit was that he did not sit down under the banyan tree, but trotted along\nat the far rear of the tribe.\n\nWith his nose he read the narrative of the flight.  Only once did he\nencounter what advertised its terror.  It was an entire group annihilated\nby a shell.  There were: an old man of fifty, with a crutch because of\nthe leg which had been slashed off by a shark when he was a young boy; a\ndead Mary with a dead babe at her breast and a dead child of three\nclutching her hand; and two dead pigs, huge and fat, which the woman had\nbeen herding to safety.\n\nAnd Jerry's nose told him of how the stream of the fugitives had split\nand flooded past on each side and flowed together again beyond.  Incidents\nof the flight he did encounter: a part-chewed joint of sugar-cane some\nchild had dropped; a clay pipe, the stem short from successive breakages;\na single feather from some young man's hair, and a calabash, full of\ncooked yams and sweet potatoes, deposited carefully beside the trail by\nsome Mary for whom its weight had proved too great.\n\nThe shell-fire ceased as Jerry trotted along; next he heard the rifle-\nfire from the landing-party, as it shot down the domestic pigs on Somo's\nstreets.  He did not hear, however, the chopping down of the coconut\ntrees, any more than did he ever return to behold what damage the axes\nhad wrought.\n\nFor right here occurred with Jerry a wonderful thing that thinkers of the\nworld have not explained.  He manifested in his dog's brain the free\nagency of life, by which all the generations of metaphysicians have\npostulated God, and by which all the deterministic philosophers have been\nled by the nose despite their clear denouncement of it as sheer illusion.\nWhat Jerry did he did.  He did not know how or why he did it any more\nthan does the philosopher know how or why he decides on mush and cream\nfor breakfast instead of two soft-boiled eggs.\n\nWhat Jerry did was to yield in action to a brain impulse to do, not what\nseemed the easier and more usual thing, but to do what seemed the harder\nand more unusual thing.  Since it is easier to endure the known than to\nfly to the unknown; since both misery and fear love company; the apparent\neasiest thing for Jerry to have done would have been to follow the tribe\nof Somo into its fastnesses.  Yet what Jerry did was to diverge from the\nline of retreat and to start northward, across the bounds of Somo, and\ncontinue northward into a strange land of the unknown.\n\nHad Nalasu not been struck down by the ultimate nothingness, Jerry would\nhave remained.  This is true, and this, perhaps, to the one who considers\nhis action, might have been the way he reasoned.  But he did not reason\nit, did not reason at all; he acted on impulse.  He could count five\nobjects, and pronounce them by name and number, but he was incapable of\nreasoning that he would remain in Somo if Nalasu lived, depart from Somo\nif Nalasu died.  He merely departed from Somo because Nalasu was dead,\nand the terrible shell-fire passed quickly into the past of his\nconsciousness, while the present became vivid after the way of the\npresent.  Almost on his toes did he tread the wild bushmen's trails,\ntense with apprehension of the lurking death he know infested such paths,\nhis ears cocked alertly for jungle sounds, his eyes following his ears to\ndiscern what made the sounds.\n\nNo more doughty nor daring was Columbus, venturing all that he was to the\nunknown, than was Jerry in venturing this jungle-darkness of black\nMalaita.  And this wonderful thing, this seeming great deed of free will,\nhe performed in much the same way that the itching of feet and tickle of\nfancy have led the feet of men over all the earth.\n\nThough Jerry never laid eyes on Somo again, Bashti returned with his\ntribe the same day, grinning and chuckling as he appraised the damage.\nOnly a few grass houses had been damaged by the shells.  Only a few\ncoconuts had been chopped down.  And as for the slain pigs, lest they\nspoil, he made of their carcasses a great feast.  One shell had knocked a\nhole through his sea-wall.  He enlarged it for a launching-ways, faced\nthe sides of it with dry-fitted coral rock, and gave orders for the\nbuilding of an additional canoe-house.  The only vexation he suffered was\nthe death of Nalasu and the disappearance of Jerry--his two experiments\nin primitive eugenics.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n\nA week Jerry spent in the bush, deterred always from penetrating to the\nmountains by the bushmen who ever guarded the runways.  And it would have\ngone hard with him in the matter of food, had he not, on the second day,\nencountered a lone small pig, evidently lost from its litter.  It was his\nfirst hunting adventure for a living, and it prevented him from\ntravelling farther, for, true to his instinct, he remained by his kill\nuntil it was nearly devoured.\n\nTrue, he ranged widely about the neighbourhood, finding no other food he\ncould capture.  But always, until it was gone, he returned to the slain\npig.  Yet he was not happy in his freedom.  He was too domesticated, too\ncivilized.  Too many thousands of years had elapsed since his ancestors\nhad run freely wild.  He was lonely.  He could not get along without man.\nToo long had he, and the generations before him, lived in intimate\nrelationship with the two-legged gods.  Too long had his kind loved man,\nserved him for love, endured for love, died for love, and, in return,\nbeen partly appreciated, less understood, and roughly loved.\n\nSo great was Jerry's loneliness that even a two-legged black-god was\ndesirable, since white-gods had long since faded into the limbo of the\npast.  For all he might have known, had he been capable of conjecturing,\nthe only white-gods in existence had perished.  Acting on the assumption\nthat a black-god was better than no god, when he had quite finished the\nlittle pig, he deflected his course to the left, down-hill, toward the\nsea.  He did this, again without reasoning, merely because, in the subtle\nprocesses of his brain, experience worked.  His experience had been to\nlive always close by the sea; humans he had always encountered close by\nthe sea; and down-hill had invariably led to the sea.\n\nHe came out upon the shore of the reef-sheltered lagoon where ruined\ngrass houses told him men had lived.  The jungle ran riot through the\nplace.  Six-inch trees, throated with rotten remnants of thatched roofs\nthrough which they had aspired toward the sun, rose about him.\nQuick-growing trees had shadowed the kingposts so that the idols and\ntotems, seated in carved shark jaws, grinned greenly and monstrously at\nthe futility of man through a rime of moss and mottled fungus.  A poor\nlittle sea-wall, never much at its best, sprawled in ruin from the\ncoconut roots to the placid sea.  Bananas, plantains, and breadfruit lay\nrotting on the ground.  Bones lay about, human bones, and Jerry nosed\nthem out, knowing them for what they were, emblems of the nothingness of\nlife.  Skulls he did not encounter, for the skulls that belonged to the\nscattered bones ornamented the devil devil houses in the upland bush\nvillages.\n\nThe salt tang of the sea gladdened his nostrils, and he snorted with the\npleasure of the stench of the mangrove swamp.  But, another Crusoe\nchancing upon the footprint of another man Friday, his nose, not his\neyes, shocked him electrically alert as he smelled the fresh contact of a\nliving man's foot with the ground.  It was a nigger's foot, but it was\nalive, it was immediate; and, as he traced it a score of yards, he came\nupon another foot-scent, indubitably a white man's.\n\nHad there been an onlooker, he would have thought Jerry had gone suddenly\nmad.  He rushed frantically about, turning and twisting his course, now\nhis nose to the ground, now up in the air, whining as frantically as he\nrushed, leaping abruptly at right angles as new scents reached him,\nscurrying here and there and everywhere as if in a game of tag with some\ninvisible playfellow.\n\nBut he was reading the full report which many men had written on the\nground.  A white man had been there, he learned, and a number of blacks.\nHere a black had climbed a coconut tree and cast down the nuts.  There a\nbanana tree had been despoiled of its clustered fruit; and, beyond, it\nwas evident that a similar event had happened to a breadfruit tree.  One\nthing, however, puzzled him--a scent new to him that was neither black\nman's nor white man's.  Had he had the necessary knowledge and the wit of\neye-observance, he would have noted that the footprint was smaller than a\nman's and that the toeprints were different from a Mary's in that they\nwere close together and did not press deeply into the earth.  What\nbothered him in his smelling was his ignorance of talcum powder.  Pungent\nit was in his nostrils, but never, since first he had smelled out the\nfootprints of man, had he encountered such a scent.  And with this were\ncombined other and fainter scents that were equally strange to him.\n\nNot long did he interest himself in such mystery.  A white man's\nfootprints he had smelled, and through the maze of all the other prints\nhe followed the one print down through a breach of sea-wall to the sea-\npounded coral sand lapped by the sea.  Here the latest freshness of many\nfeet drew together where the nose of a boat had rested on the beach and\nwhere men had disembarked and embarked again.  He smelled up all the\nstory, and, his forelegs in the water till it touched his shoulders, he\ngazed out across the lagoon where the disappearing trail was lost to his\nnose.\n\nHad he been half an hour sooner he would have seen a boat, without oars,\ngasoline-propelled, shooting across the quiet water.  What he did see was\nan _Arangi_.  True, it was far larger than the _Arangi_ he had known, but\nit was white, it was long, it had masts, and it floated on the surface of\nthe sea.  It had three masts, sky-lofty and all of a size; but his\nobservation was not trained to note the difference between them and the\none long and the one short mast of the _Arangi_.  The one floating world\nhe had known was the white-painted _Arangi_.  And, since, without a\nquiver of doubt, this was the _Arangi_, then, on board, would be his\nbeloved Skipper.  If _Arangis_ could resurrect, then could Skippers\nresurrect, and in utter faith that the head of nothingness he had last\nseen on Bashti's knees he would find again rejoined to its body and its\ntwo legs on the deck of the white-painted floating world, he waded out to\nhis depth, and, swimming dared the sea.\n\nHe greatly dared, for in venturing the water he broke one of the greatest\nand earliest taboos he had learned.  In his vocabulary was no word for\n\"crocodile\"; yet in his thought, as potent as any utterable word, was an\nimage of dreadful import--an image of a log awash that was not a log and\nthat was alive, that could swim upon the surface, under the surface, and\nhaul out across the dry land, that was huge-toothed, mighty-mawed, and\ncertain death to a swimming dog.\n\nBut he continued the breaking of the taboo without fear.  Unlike a man\nwho can be simultaneously conscious of two states of mind, and who,\nswimming, would have known both the fear and the high courage with which\nhe overrode the fear, Jerry, as he swam, knew only one state of mind,\nwhich was that he was swimming to the _Arangi_ and to Skipper.  At the\nmoment preceding the first stroke of his paws in the water out of his\ndepth, he had known all the terribleness of the taboo he deliberately\nbroke.  But, launched out, the decision made, the line of least\nresistance taken, he knew, single-thoughted, single-hearted, only that he\nwas going to Skipper.\n\nLittle practised as he was in swimming, he swam with all his strength,\nwhimpering in a sort of chant his eager love for Skipper who indubitably\nmust be aboard the white yacht half a mile away.  His little song of\nlove, fraught with keenness of anxiety, came to the ears of a man and\nwoman lounging in deck-chairs under the awning; and it was the quick-eyed\nwoman who first saw the golden head of Jerry and cried out what she saw.\n\n\"Lower a boat, Husband-Man,\" she commanded.  \"It's a little dog.  He\nmustn't drown.\"\n\n\"Dogs don't drown that easily,\" was \"Husband-Man's\" reply.  \"He'll make\nit all right.  But what under the sun a dog's doing out here . . . \"  He\nlifted his marine glasses to his eyes and stared a moment.  \"And a white\nman's dog at that!\"\n\nJerry beat the water with his paws and moved steadily along, straining\nhis eyes at the growing yacht until suddenly warned by a sensing of\nimmediate danger.  The taboo smote him.  This that moved toward him was\nthe log awash that was not a log but a live thing of peril.  Part of it\nhe saw above the surface moving sluggishly, and ere that projecting part\nsank, he had an awareness that somehow it was different from a log awash.\n\nNext, something brushed past him, and he encountered it with a snarl and\na splashing of his forepaws.  He was half-whirled about in the vortex of\nthe thing's passage caused by the alarmed flirt of its tail.  Shark it\nwas, and not crocodile, and not so timidly would it have sheered clear\nbut for the fact that it was fairly full with a recent feed of a huge sea\nturtle too feeble with age to escape.\n\nAlthough he could not see it, Jerry sensed that the thing, the instrument\nof nothingness, lurked about him.  Nor did he see the dorsal fin break\nsurface and approach him from the rear.  From the yacht he heard rifle-\nshots in quick succession.  From the rear a panic splash came to his\nears.  That was all.  The peril passed and was forgotten.  Nor did he\nconnect the rifle-shots with the passing of the peril.  He did not know,\nand he was never to know, that one, known to men as Harley Kennan, but\nknown as \"Husband-Man\" by the woman he called \"Wife-Woman,\" who owned the\nthree-topmast schooner yacht _Ariel_, had saved his life by sending a\nthirty-thirty Marlin bullet through the base of a shark's fin.\n\nBut Jerry was to know Harley Kennan, and quickly, for it was Harley\nKennan, a bowline around his body under his arm-pits, lowered by a couple\nof seamen down the generous freeboard of the _Ariel_, who gathered in by\nthe nape of the neck the smooth-coated Irish terrier that, treading water\nperpendicularly, had no eyes for him so eagerly did he gaze at the line\nof faces along the rail in quest of the one face.\n\nNo pause for thanks did he make when he was dropped down upon the deck.\nInstead, shaking himself instinctively as he ran, he scurried along the\ndeck for Skipper.  The man and his wife laughed at the spectacle.\n\n\"He acts as if he were demented with delight at being rescued,\" Mrs.\nKennan observed.\n\nAnd Mr. Kennan: \"It's not that.  He must have a screw loose somewhere.\nPerhaps he's one of those creatures who've slipped the ratchet off the\nmotion cog.  Maybe he can't stop running till he runs down.\"\n\nIn the meantime Jerry continued to run, up port side and down starboard\nside, from stern to bow and back again, wagging his stump tail and\nlaughing friendliness to the many two-legged gods he encountered.  Had he\nbeen able to think to such abstraction he would have been astounded at\nthe number of white-gods.  Thirty there were at least of them, not\ncounting other gods that were neither black nor white, but that still,\ntwo-legged, upright and garmented, were beyond all peradventure gods.\nLikewise, had he been capable of such generalization, he would have\ndecided that the white-gods had not yet all of them passed into the\nnothingness.  As it was, he realized all this without being aware that he\nrealized it.\n\nBut there was no Skipper.  He sniffed down the forecastle hatch, sniffed\ninto the galley where two Chinese cooks jabbered unintelligibly to him,\nsniffed down the cabin companionway, sniffed down the engine-room\nskylight and for the first time knew gasoline and engine oil; but sniff\nas he would, wherever he ran, no scent did he catch of Skipper.\n\nAft, at the wheel, he would have sat down and howled his heartbreak of\ndisappointment, had not a white-god, evidently of command, in\ngold-decorated white duck cap and uniform, spoken to him.  Instantly,\nalways a gentleman, Jerry smiled with flattened ears of courtesy, wagged\nhis tail, and approached.  The hand of this high god had almost caressed\nhis head when the woman's voice came down the deck in speech that Jerry\ndid not understand.  The words and terms of it were beyond him.  But he\nsensed power of command in it, which was verified by the quick withdrawal\nof the hand of the god in white and gold who had almost caressed him.\nThis god, stiffened electrically and pointed Jerry along the deck, and,\nwith mouth encouragements and urgings the import of which Jerry could\nonly guess, directed him toward the one who so commanded by saying:\n\n\"Send him, please, along to me, Captain Winters.\"\n\nJerry wriggled his body in delight of obeying, and would loyally have\npresented his head to her outreaching caress of hand, had not the\nstrangeness and difference of her deterred him.  He broke off in\nmid-approach and with a show of teeth snarled himself back and away from\nthe windblown skirt of her.  The only human females he had known were\nnaked Marys.  This skirt, flapping in the wind like a sail, reminded him\nof the menacing mainsail of the _Arangi_ when it had jarred and crashed\nand swooped above his head.  The noises her mouth made were gentle and\ningratiating, but the fearsome skirt still flapped in the breeze.\n\n\"You ridiculous dog!\" she laughed.  \"I'm not going to bite you.\"\n\nBut her husband thrust out a rough, sure hand and drew Jerry in to him.\nAnd Jerry wriggled in ecstasy under the god's caress, kissing the hand\nwith a red flicker of tongue.  Next, Harley Kennan directed him toward\nthe woman sitting up in the deck-chair and bending forward, with hovering\nhands of greeting.  Jerry obeyed.  He advanced with flattened ears and\nlaughing mouth: but, just ere she could touch him, the wind fluttered the\nskirt again and he backed away with a snarl.\n\n\"It's not you that he's afraid of, Villa,\" he said.  \"But of your skirt.\nPerhaps he's never seen a skirt before.\"\n\n\"You mean,\" Villa Kennan challenged, \"that these head-hunting cannibals\nashore here keep records of pedigrees and maintain kennels; for surely\nthis absurd adventurer of a dog is as proper an Irish terrier as the\n_Ariel_ is an Oregon-pine-planked schooner.\"\n\nHarley Kennan laughed in acknowledgment.  Villa Kennan laughed too; and\nJerry knew that these were a pair of happy gods, and himself laughed with\nthem.\n\nOf his own initiative, he approached the lady god again, attracted by the\ntalcum powder and other minor fragrances he had already identified as the\nstrange scents encountered on the beach.  But the unfortunate trade wind\nagain fluttered her skirt, and again he backed away--not so far, this\ntime, with much less of a bristle of his neck and shoulder hair, and with\nno more of a snarl than a mere half-baring of his fangs.\n\n\"He's afraid of your skirt,\" Harley insisted.  \"Look at him!  He wants to\ncome to you, but the skirt keeps him away.  Tuck it under you so that it\nwon't flutter, and see what happens.\"\n\nVilla Kennan carried out the suggestion, and Jerry came circumspectly,\nbent his head to her hand and writhed his back under it, the while he\nsniffed her feet, stocking-clad and shoe-covered, and knew them as the\nfeet which had trod uncovered the ruined ways of the village ashore.\n\n\"No doubt of it,\" Harley agreed.  \"He's white-man selected, white-man\nbred and born.  He has a history.  He knows adventure from the ground-\nroots up.  If he could tell his story, we'd sit listening entranced for\ndays.  Depend on it, he's not known blacks all his life.  Let's try him\non Johnny.\"\n\nJohnny, whom Kennan beckoned up to him, was a loan from the Resident\nCommissioner of the British Solomons at Tulagi, who had come along as\npilot and guide to Kennan rather than as philosopher and friend.  Johnny\napproached grinning, and Jerry's demeanour immediately changed.  His body\nstiffened under Villa Kennan's hand as he drew away from her and stalked\nstiff-legged to the black.  Jerry's ears did not flatten, nor did he\nlaugh fellowship with his mouth, as he inspected Johnny and smelt his\ncalves for future reference.  Cavalier he was to the extreme, and, after\nthe briefest of inspection, he turned back to Villa Kennan.\n\n\"What did I say?\" her husband exulted.  \"He knows the colour line.  He's\na white man's dog that has been trained to it.\"\n\n\"My word,\" spoke up Johnny.  \"Me know 'm that fella dog.  Me know 'm papa\nand mamma belong along him.  Big fella white marster Mister Haggin stop\nalong Meringe, mamma and papa stop along him that fella place.\"\n\nHarley Kennan uttered a sharp exclamation.\n\n\"Of course,\" he cried.  \"The Commissioner told me all about it.  The\n_Arangi_, that the Somo people captured, sailed last from Meringe\nPlantation.  Johnny recognizes the dog as the same breed as the pair\nHaggin, of Meringe, must possess.  But that was a long time ago.  He must\nhave been a little puppy.  Of course he's a white man's dog.\"\n\n\"And yet you've overlooked the crowning proof of it,\" Villa Kennan\nteased.  \"The dog carries the evidence around with him.\"\n\nHarley looked Jerry over carefully.\n\n\"Indisputable evidence,\" she insisted.\n\nAfter another prolonged scrutiny, Kennan shook his head.\n\n\"Blamed if I can see anything so indisputable as to leave conjecture\nout.\"\n\n\"The tail,\" his wife gurgled.  \"Surely the natives do not bob the tails\nof their dogs.--Do they, Johnny?  Do black man stop along Malaita chop 'm\noff tail along dog.\"\n\n\"No chop 'm off,\" Johnny agreed.  \"Mister Haggin along Meringe he chop 'm\noff.  My word, he chop 'm that fella tail, you bet.\"\n\n\"Then he's the sole survivor of the _Arangi_,\" Villa Kennan concluded.\n\"Don't you agree, Mr. Sherlock Holmes Kennan?\"\n\n\"I salute you, Mrs. S. Holmes,\" her husband acknowledged gallantly.  \"And\nall that remains is for you to lead me directly to the head of La Perouse\nhimself.  The sailing directions record that he left it somewhere in\nthese islands.\"\n\nLittle did they guess that Jerry had lived on intimate terms with one\nBashti, not many miles away along the shore, who, in Somo, at that very\nmoment, sat in his grass house pondering over a head on his withered\nknees that had once been the head of the great navigator, the history of\nwhich had been forgotten by the sons of the chief who had taken it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\nThe fine, three-topmast schooner _Ariel_, on a cruise around the world,\nhad already been out a year from San Francisco when Jerry boarded her.  As\na world, and as a white-god world, she was to him beyond compare.  She\nwas not small like the _Arangi_, nor was she cluttered fore and aft, on\ndeck and below, with a spawn of niggers.  The only black Jerry found on\nher was Johnny; while her spaciousness was filled principally with two-\nlegged white-gods.\n\nHe met them everywhere, at the wheel, on lookout, washing decks,\npolishing brass-work, running aloft, or tailing on to sheets and tackles\nhalf a dozen at a time.  But there was a difference.  There were gods and\ngods, and Jerry was not long in learning that in the hierarchy of the\nheaven of these white-gods on the _Ariel_, the sailorizing, ship-working\nones were far beneath the captain and his two white-and-gold-clad\nofficers.  These, in turn, were less than Harley Kennan and Villa Kennan;\nfor them, it came quickly to him, Harley Kennan commanded.  Nevertheless,\nthere was one thing he did not learn and was destined never to learn,\nnamely, the supreme god over all on the _Ariel_.  Although he never tried\nto know, being unable to think to such a distance, he never came to know\nwhether it was Harley Kennan who commanded Villa, or Villa Kennan who\ncommanded Harley.  In a way, without vexing himself with the problem, he\naccepted their over-lordship of the world as dual.  Neither out-ranked\nthe other.  They seemed to rule co-equal, while all others bowed before\nthem.\n\nIt is not true that to feed a dog is to win a dog's heart.  Never did\nHarley or Villa feed Jerry; yet it was to them he elected to belong, them\nhe elected to love and serve rather than to the Japanese steward who\nregularly fed him.  For that matter, Jerry, like any dog, was able to\ndifferentiate between the mere direct food-giver and the food source.\nThat is, subconsciously, he was aware that not alone his own food, but\nthe food of all on board found its source in the man and woman.  They it\nwas who fed all and ruled all.  Captain Winters might give orders to the\nsailors, but Captain Winters took orders from Harley Kennan.  Jerry knew\nthis as indubitably as he acted upon it, although all the while it never\nentered his head as an item of conscious knowledge.\n\nAnd, as he had been accustomed, all his life, as with Mister Haggin,\nSkipper, and even with Bashti and the chief devil devil doctor of Somo,\nhe attached himself to the high gods themselves, and from the gods under\nthem received deference accordingly.  As Skipper, on the _Arangi_, and\nBashti in Somo, had promulgated taboos, so the man and the woman on the\n_Ariel_ protected Jerry with taboos.  From Sano, the Japanese steward,\nand from him alone, did Jerry receive food.  Not from any sailor in\nwhaleboat or launch could he accept, or would he be offered, a bit of\nbiscuit or an invitation to go ashore for a run.  Nor did they offer it.\nNor were they permitted to become intimate, to the extent of romping and\nplaying with him, nor even of whistling to him along the deck.\n\nBy nature a \"one-man\" dog, all this was very acceptable to Jerry.\nDifferences of degree there were, of course; but no one more delicately\nand definitely knew those differences than did Jerry himself.  Thus, it\nwas permissible for the two officers to greet him with a \"Hello,\" or a\n\"Good morning,\" and even to touch a hand in a brief and friendly pat to\nhis head.  With Captain Winters, however, greater familiarity obtained.\nCaptain Winters could rub his ears, shake hands with his, scratch his\nback, and even roughly catch him by the jowls.  But Captain Winters\ninvariably surrendered him up when the one man and the one woman appeared\non deck.\n\nWhen it came to liberties, delicious, wanton liberties, Jerry alone of\nall on board could take them with the man and woman, and, on the other\nhand, they were the only two to whom he permitted liberties.  Any\nindignity that Villa Kennan chose to inflict upon him he was throbbingly\nglad to receive, such as doubling his ears inside out till they stuck, at\nthe same time making him sit upright, with helpless forefeet paddling the\nair for equilibrium, while she blew roguishly in his face and nostrils.\nAs bad was Harley Kennan's trick of catching him gloriously asleep on an\nedge of Villa's skirt and of tickling the hair between his toes and\nmaking him kick involuntarily in his sleep, until he kicked himself awake\nto hearing of gurgles and snickers of laughter at his expense.\n\nIn turn, at night on deck, wriggling her toes at him under a rug to\nsimulate some strange and crawling creature of an invader, he would dare\nto simulate his own befoolment and quite disrupt Villa's bed with his\nfrantic ferocious attack on the thing that he knew was only her toes.  In\ngales of laughter, intermingled with half-genuine cries of alarm as\nalmost his teeth caught her toes, she always concluded by gathering him\ninto her arms and laughing the last of her laughter away into his\nflattened ears of joy and love.  Who else, of all on board the _Ariel_,\nwould have dared such devilishness with the lady-god's bed?  This\nquestion it never entered his mind to ask himself; yet he was fully aware\nof how exclusively favoured he was.\n\nAnother of his deliberate tricks was one discovered by accident.\nThrusting his muzzle to meet her in love, he chanced to encounter her\nface with his soft-hard little nose with such force as to make her recoil\nand cry out.  When, another time, in all innocence this happened again,\nhe became conscious of it and of its effect upon her; and thereafter,\nwhen she grew too wildly wild, too wantonly facetious in her teasing\nplayful love of him, he would thrust his muzzle at her face and make her\nthrow her head back to escape him.  After a time, learning that if he\npersisted, she would settle the situation by gathering him into her arms\nand gurgling into his ears, he made it a point to act his part until such\ndelectable surrender and joyful culmination were achieved.\n\nNever, by accident, in this deliberate game, did he hurt her chin or\ncheek so severely as he hurt his own tender nose, but in the hurt itself\nhe found more of delight than pain.  All of fun it was, all through, and,\nin addition, it was love fun.  Such hurt was more than fun.  Such pain\nwas heart-pleasure.\n\nAll dogs are god-worshippers.  More fortunate than most dogs, Jerry won\nto a pair of gods that, no matter how much they commanded, loved more.\nAlthough his nose might threaten grievously to hurt the cheek of his\nadored god, rather than have it really hurt he would have spilled out all\nthe love-tide of his heart that constituted the life of him.  He did not\nlive for food, for shelter, for a comfortable place between the\ndarknesses that rounded existence.  He lived for love.  And as surely as\nhe gladly lived for love, would he have died gladly for love.\n\nNot quickly, in Somo, had Jerry's memory of Skipper and Mister Haggin\nfaded.  Life in the cannibal village had been too unsatisfying.  There\nhad been too little love.  Only love can erase the memory of love, or\nrather, the hurt of lost love.  And on board the _Ariel_ such erasement\noccurred quickly.  Jerry did not forget Skipper and Mister Haggin.  But\nat the moments he remembered them the yearning that accompanied the\nmemory grew less pronounced and painful.  The intervals between the\nmoments widened, nor did Skipper and Mister Haggin take form and reality\nso frequently in his dreams; for, after the manner of dogs, he dreamed\nmuch and vividly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n\nNorthward, along the leeward coast of Malaita, the _Ariel_ worked her\nleisurely way, threading the colour-riotous lagoon that lay between the\nshore-reefs and outer-reefs, daring passages so narrow and coral-patched\nthat Captain Winters averred each day added a thousand grey hairs to his\nhead, and dropping anchor off every walled inlet of the outer reef and\nevery mangrove swamp of the mainland that looked promising of cannibal\nlife.  For Harley and Villa Kennan were in no hurry.  So long as the way\nwas interesting, they dared not how long it proved from anywhere to\nanywhere.\n\nDuring this time Jerry learned a new name for himself--or, rather, an\nentire series of names for himself.  This was because of an aversion on\nHarley Kennan's part against renaming a named thing.\n\n\"A name he must have had,\" he argued to Villa.  \"Haggin must have named\nhim before he sailed on the _Arangi_.  Therefore, nameless he must be\nuntil we get back to Tulagi and find out his real name.\"\n\n\"What's in a name?\" Villa had begun to tease.\n\n\"Everything,\" her husband retorted.  \"Think of yourself, shipwrecked,\ncalled by your rescuers 'Mrs. Riggs,' or 'Mademoiselle de Maupin,' or\njust plain 'Topsy.'  And think of me being called 'Benedict Arnold,' or '\nJudas,' or . . . or . . . 'Haman.'  No, keep him nameless, until we find\nout his original name.\"\n\n\"Must call him something,\" she objected.  \"Can't think of him without\nthinking something.\"\n\n\"Then call him many names, but never the same name twice.  Call him 'Dog'\nto-day, and 'Mister Dog' to-morrow, and the next day something else.\"\n\nSo it was, more by tone and emphasis and context of situation than by\nanything else, that Jerry came hazily to identify himself with names such\nas: Dog, Mister Dog, Adventurer, Strong Useful One, Sing Song Silly,\nNoname, and Quivering Love-Heart.  These were a few of the many names\nlavished on him by Villa.  Harley, in turn, addressed him as: Man-Dog,\nIncorruptible One, Brass Tacks, Then Some, Sin of Gold, South Sea Satrap,\nNimrod, Young Nick, and Lion-Slayer.  In brief, the man and woman\ncompeted with each other to name him most without naming him ever the\nsame.  And Jerry, less by sound and syllable than by what of their hearts\nvibrated in their throats, soon learned to know himself by any name they\nchose to address to him.  He no longer thought of himself as Jerry, but,\ninstead, as any sound that sounded nice or was love-sounded.\n\nHis great disappointment (if \"disappointment\" may be considered to\ndescribe an unconsciousness of failure to realize the expected) was in\nthe matter of language.  No one on board, not even Harley and Villa,\ntalked Nalasu's talk.  All Jerry's large vocabulary, all his proficiency\nin the use of it, which would have set him apart as a marvel beyond all\nother dogs in the mastery of speech, was wasted on those of the _Ariel_.\nThey did not speak, much less guess, the existence of the whiff-whuff\nshorthand language which Nalasu had taught him, and which, Nalasu dead,\nJerry alone knew of all living creatures in the world.\n\nIn vain Jerry tried it on the lady-god.  Sitting squatted on his\nhaunches, his head bowed forward and held between her hands, he would\ntalk and talk and elicit never a responsive word from her.  With tiny\nwhines and thin whimperings, with whiffs and whuffs and growly sorts of\nnoises down in his throat, he would try to tell her somewhat of his tale.\nShe was all meltingness of sympathy; she would hold her ear so near to\nthe articulate mouth of him as almost to drown him in the flowing\nfragrance of her hair; and yet her brain told her nothing of what he\nuttered, although her heart surely sensed his intent.\n\n\"Bless me, Husband-Man!\" she would cry out.  \"The Dog is talking.  I know\nhe is talking.  He is telling me all about himself.  The story of his\nlife is mine, could I but understand.  It's right here pouring into my\nmiserable inadequate ears, only I can't catch it.\"\n\nHarley was sceptical, but her woman's intuition guessed aright.\n\n\"I know it!\" she would assure her husband.  \"I tell you he could tell the\ntale of all his adventures if only we had understanding.  No other dog\nhas ever talked this way to me.  There's a tale there.  I feel its\ntouches.  Sometimes almost do I know he is telling of joy, of love, of\nhigh elation, and combat.  Again, it is indignation, hurt of outrage,\ndespair and sadness.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" Harley agreed quietly.  \"A white man's dog, adrift among the\nanthropophagi of Malaita, would experience all such sensations and, just\nas naturally, a white man's woman, a Wife-Woman, a dear, delightful Villa\nKennan woman, can of herself imagine such a dog's experiences and deem\nhis silly noises a recital of them, failing to recognize them as\nprojections of her own delicious, sensitive, sympathetic self.  The song\nof the sea from the lips of the shell--Pshaw!  The song oneself makes of\nthe sea and puts into the shell.\"\n\n\"Just the same--\"\n\n\"Always the same,\" he gallantly cut her off.  \"Always right, especially\nwhen most wrong.  Not in navigation, of course, nor in affairs such as\nthe multiplication table, where the brass tacks of reality stud the way\nof one's ship among the rocks and shoals of the sea; but right, truth\nbeyond truth to truth higher than truth, namely, intuitional truth.\"\n\n\"Now you are laughing at me with your superior man-wisdom,\" she retorted.\n\"But I know--\" she paused for the strength of words she needed, and words\nforsook her, so that her quick sweeping gesture of hand-touch to heart\nnamed authority that overrode all speech.\n\n\"We agree--I salute,\" he laughed gaily.  \"It was just precisely what I\nwas saying.  Our hearts can talk our heads down almost any time, and,\nbest all, our hearts are always right despite the statistic that they are\nmostly wrong.\"\n\nHarley Kennan did not believe, and never did believe, his wife's report\nof the tales Jerry told.  And through all his days to the last one of\nthem, he considered the whole matter a pleasant fancy, all poesy of\nsentiment, on Villa's part.\n\nBut Jerry, four-legged, smooth-coated, Irish terrier that he was, had the\ngift of tongues.  If he could not teach languages, at least he could\nlearn languages.  Without effort, and quickly, practically with no\nteaching, he began picking up the language of the _Ariel_.  Unfortunately,\nit was not a whiff-whuff, dog-possible language such as Nalasu had\ninvented.  While Jerry came to understand much that was spoken on the\n_Ariel_, he could speak none of it.  Three names, at least, he had for\nthe lady-god: \"Villa,\" \"Wife-Woman,\" \"Missis Kennan,\" for so he heard her\nvariously called.  But he could not so call her.  This was god-language\nentire, which only gods could talk.  It was unlike the language of\nNalasu's devising, which had been a compromise between god-talk and dog-\ntalk, so that a god and a dog could talk in the common medium.\n\nIn the same way he learned many names for the one-man god: \"Mister\nKennan,\" \"Harley,\" \"Captain Kennan,\" and \"Skipper.\"  Only in the intimacy\nof the three of them alone did Jerry hear him called: \"Husband-Man,\" \"My\nMan,\" \"Patient One,\" \"Dear Man,\" \"Lover,\" and \"This Woman's Delight.\"  But\nin no way could Jerry utter these names in address of the one-man nor the\nmany names in address of the one-woman.  Yet on a quiet night with no\nwind among the trees, often and often had he whispered to Nalasu, by\nwhiff-whuff of name, from a hundred feet away.\n\nOne day, bending over him, her hair (drying from a salt-water swim)\nflying about him, the one-woman, her two hands holding his head and jowls\nso that his ribbon of kissing tongue just missed her nose in the empty\nair, sang to him: \"'Don't know what to call him, but he's mighty lak' a\nrose!'\"\n\nOn another day she repeated this, at the same time singing most of the\nsong to him softly in his ear.  In the midst of it Jerry surprised her.\nEqually true might be the statement that he surprised himself.  Never,\nhad he consciously done such a thing before.  And he did it without\nvolition.  He never intended to do it.  For that matter, the very thing\nhe did was what mastered him into doing it.  No more than could he\nrefrain from shaking the water from his back after a swim, or from\nkicking in his sleep when his feet were tickled, could he have avoided\ndoing this imperative thing.\n\nAs her voice, in the song, made soft vibrations in his ears, it seemed to\nhim that she grew dim and vague before him, and that somehow, under the\nsoft searching prod of her song, he was otherwhere.  So much was he\notherwhere that he did the surprising thing.  He sat down abruptly,\nalmost cataleptically, drew his head away from the clutch of her hands\nand out of the entanglement of her hair, and, his nose thrust upward at\nan angle of forty-five degrees, he began to quiver and to breathe audibly\nin rhythm to the rhythm of her singing.  With a quick jerk,\ncataleptically, his nose pointed to the zenith, his mouth opened, and a\nflood of sound poured forth, running swiftly upward in crescendo and\nslowly falling as it died away.\n\nThis howl was the beginning, and it led to the calling him \"Sing Song\nSilly.\"  For Villa Kennan was quick to seize upon the howling her singing\ninduced and to develop it.  Never did he hang back when she sat down,\nextended her welcoming hands to him, and invited: \"Come on, Sing Song\nSilly.\"  He would come to her, sit down with the loved fragrance of her\nhair in his nostrils, lay the side of his head against hers, point his\nnose past her ear, and almost immediately follow her when she began her\nlow singing.  Minor strains were especially provocative in getting him\nstarted, and, once started, he would sing with her as long as she wished.\n\nSinging it truly was.  Apt in all ways of speech, he quickly learned to\nsoften and subdue his howl till it was mellow and golden.  Even could he\nmanage it to die away almost to a whisper, and to rise and fall,\naccelerate and retard, in obedience to her own voice and in accord with\nit.\n\nJerry enjoyed the singing much in the same way the opium eater enjoys his\ndreams.  For dream he did, vaguely and indistinctly, eyes wide open and\nawake, the lady-god's hair in a faint-scented cloud about him, her voice\nmourning with his, his consciousness drowning in the dreams of\notherwhereness that came to him of the singing and that was the singing.\nMemories of pain were his, but of pain so long forgotten that it was no\nlonger pain.  Rather did it permeate him with a delicious sadness, and\nlift him away and out of the _Ariel_ (lying at anchor in some coral\nlagoon) to that unreal place of Otherwhere.\n\nFor visions were his at such times.  In the cold bleakness of night, it\nwould seem he sat on a bare hill and raised his howl to the stars, while\nout of the dark, from far away, would drift to him an answering howl.  And\nother howls, near and far, would drift along until the night was vocal\nwith his kind.  His kind it was.  Without knowing it he _knew_ it, this\ncamaraderie of the land of Otherwhere.\n\nNalasu, in teaching him the whiff-whuff language, deliberately had gone\ninto the intelligence of him; but Villa, unwitting of what she was doing,\nwent into the heart of him, and into the heart of his heredity, touching\nthe profoundest chords of ancient memories and making them respond.\n\nAs instance: dim shapes and shadowy forms would sometimes appear to him\nout of the night, and as they flitted spectrally past he would hear, as\nin a dream, the hunting cries of the pack; and, as his pulse quickened,\nhis own hunting instinct would rouse until his controlled soft-howling in\nthe song broke into eager whinings.  His head would lower out of the\nentanglement of the woman's hair; his feet would begin making restless,\nspasmodic movements as if running; and Presto, in a flash, he would be\nout and away, across the face of time, out of reality and into the dream,\nhimself running in the midst of those shadowy forms in the hunting\nfellowship of the pack.\n\nAnd as men have ever desired the dust of the poppy and the juice of the\nhemp, so Jerry desired the joys that were his when Villa Kennan opened\nher arms to him, embraced him with her hair, and sang him across time and\nspace into the dream of his ancient kind.\n\nNot always, however, were such experiences his when they sang together.\nUsually, unaccompanied by visions, he knew no more than vaguenesses of\nsensations, sadly sweet, ghosts of memories that they were.  At other\ntimes, incited by such sadness, images of Skipper and Mister Haggin would\nthrong his mind; images, too, of Terrence, and Biddy, and Michael, and\nthe rest of the long-vanished life at Meringe Plantation.\n\n\"My dear,\" Harley said to Villa at the conclusion of one such singing,\n\"it's fortunate for him that you are not an animal trainer, or, rather, I\nsuppose, it would be better called 'trained animal show-woman'; for you'd\nbe topping the bill in all the music-halls and vaudeville houses of the\nworld.\"\n\n\"If I did,\" she replied, \"I know he'd just love to do it with me--\"\n\n\"Which would make it a very unusual turn,\" Harley caught her up.\n\n\"You mean . . .?\"\n\n\"That in about one turn in a hundred does the animal love its work or is\nthe animal loved by its trainer.\"\n\n\"I thought all the cruelty had been done away with long ago,\" she\ncontended.\n\n\"So the audience thinks, and the audience is ninety-nine times wrong.\"\n\nVilla heaved a great sigh of renunciation as she said, \"Then I suppose I\nmust abandon such promising and lucrative career right now in the very\nmoment you have discovered it for me.  Just the same the billboards would\nlook splendid with my name in the hugest letters--\"\n\n\"Villa Kennan the Thrush-throated Songstress, and Sing Song Silly the\nIrish-Terrier Tenor,\" her husband pictured the head-lines for her.\n\nAnd with dancing eyes and lolling tongue Jerry joined in the laughter,\nnot because he knew what it was about, but because it tokened they were\nhappy and his love prompted him to be happy with them.\n\nFor Jerry had found, and in the uttermost, what his nature craved--the\nlove of a god.  Recognizing the duality of their lordship over the\n_Ariel_, he loved the pair of them; yet, somehow, perhaps because she had\npenetrated deepest into his heart with her magic voice that transported\nhim to the land of Otherwhere, he loved the lady-god beyond all love he\nhad ever known, not even excluding his love for Skipper.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n\nOne thing Jerry learned early on the _Ariel_, namely, that nigger-chasing\nwas not permitted.  Eager to please and serve his new gods, he took\nadvantage of the first opportunity to worry a canoe-load of blacks who\ncame visiting on board.  The quick chiding of Villa and the command of\nHarley made him pause in amazement.  Fully believing he had been\nmistaken, he resumed his ragging of the particular black he had picked\nupon.  This time Harley's voice was peremptory, and Jerry came to him,\nhis wagging tail and wriggling body all eagerness of apology, as was his\nrose-strip of tongue that kissed the hand of forgiveness with which\nHarley patted him.\n\nNext, Villa called him to her.  Holding him close to her with her hands\non his jowls, eye to eye and nose to nose, she talked to him earnestly\nabout the sin of nigger-chasing.  She told him that he was no common bush-\ndog, but a blooded Irish gentleman, and that no dog that was a gentleman\never did such things as chase unoffending black men.  To all of which he\nlistened with unblinking serious eyes, understanding little of what she\nsaid, yet comprehending all.  \"Naughty\" was a word in the _Ariel_\nlanguage he had already learned, and she used it several times.\n\"Naughty,\" to him, meant \"must not,\" and was by way of expressing a\ntaboo.\n\nSince it was their way and their will, who was he, he might well have\nasked himself, to disobey their rule or question it?  If niggers were not\nto be chased, then chase them he would not, despite the fact that Skipper\nhad encouraged him to chase them.  Not in such set terms did Jerry\nconsider the matter; but in his own way he accepted the conclusions.\n\nLove of a god, with him, implied service.  It pleased him to please with\nservice.  And the foundation-stone of service, in his case, was\nobedience.  Yet it strained him sore for a time to refrain from snarl and\nsnap when the legs of strange and presumptuous blacks passed near him\nalong the _Ariel's_ white deck.\n\nBut there were times and times, as he was to learn, and the time came\nwhen Villa Kennan wanted a bath, a real bath in fresh, rain-descended,\nrunning water, and when Johnny, the black pilot from Tulagi, made a\nmistake.  The chart showed a mile of the Suli river where it emptied into\nthe sea.  Why it showed only a mile was because no white man had ever\nexplored it farther.  When Villa proposed the bath, her husband advised\nwith Johnny.  Johnny shook his head.\n\n\"No fella boy stop 'm along that place,\" he said.  \"No make 'm trouble\nalong you.  Bush fella boy stop 'm long way too much.\"\n\nSo it was that the launch went ashore, and, while its crew lolled in the\nshade of the beach coconuts, Villa, Harley, and Jerry followed the river\ninland a quarter of a mile to the first likely pool.\n\n\"One can never be too sure,\" Harley said, taking his automatic pistol\nfrom its holster and placing it on top his heap of clothes.  \"A stray\nbunch of blacks might just happen to surprise us.\"\n\nVilla stepped into the water to her knees, looked up at the dark jungle\nroof high overhead through which only occasional shafts of sunlight\npenetrated, and shuddered.\n\n\"An appropriate setting for a dark deed,\" she smiled, then scooped a\nhandful of chill water against her husband, who plunged in in pursuit.\n\nFor a time Jerry sat by their clothes and watched the frolic.  Then the\ndrifting shadow of a huge butterfly attracted his attention, and soon he\nwas nosing through the jungle on the trail of a wood-rat.  It was not a\nvery fresh trail.  He knew that well enough; but in the deeps of him were\nall his instincts of ancient training--instincts to hunt, to prowl, to\npursue living things, in short, to play the game of getting his own meat\nthough for ages man had got the meat for him and his kind.\n\nSo it was, exercising faculties that were no longer necessary, but that\nwere still alive in him and clamorous for exercise, he followed the long-\nsince passed wood-rat with all the soft-footed crouching craft of the\nmeat-pursuer and with utmost fineness of reading the scent.  The trail\ncrossed a fresh trail, a trail very fresh, very immediately fresh.  As if\na rope had been attached to it, his head was jerked abruptly to right\nangles with his body.  The unmistakable smell of a black was in his\nnostrils.  Further, it was a strange black, for he did not identify it\nwith the many he possessed filed away in the pigeon-holes of his brain.\n\nForgotten was the stale wood-rat as he followed the new trail.  Curiosity\nand play impelled him.  He had no thought of apprehension for Villa and\nHarley--not even when he reached the spot where the black, evidently\nstartled by bearing their voices, had stood and debated, and so left a\nvery strong scent.  From this point the trail swerved off toward the\npool.  Nervously alert, strung to extreme tension, but without alarm,\nstill playing at the game of tracking, Jerry followed.\n\nFrom the pool came occasional cries and laughter, and each time they\nreached his ears Jerry experienced glad little thrills.  Had he been\nasked, and had he been able to express the sensations of emotion in terms\nof thought, he would have said that the sweetest sound in the world was\nany sound of Villa Kennan's voice, and that, next sweetest, was any sound\nof Harley Kennan's voice.  Their voices thrilled him, always, reminding\nhim of his love for them and that he was beloved of them.\n\nWith the first sight of the strange black, which occurred close to the\npool, Jerry's suspicions were aroused.  He was not conducting himself as\nan ordinary black, not on evil intent, should conduct himself.  Instead,\nhe betrayed all the actions of one who lurked in the perpetration of\nharm.  He crouched on the jungle floor, peering around a great root of a\nboard tree.  Jerry bristled and himself crouched as he watched.\n\nOnce, the black raised his rifle half-way to his shoulder; but, with an\noutburst of splashing and laughter, his unconscious victims evidently\nremoved themselves from his field of vision.  His rifle was no\nold-fashioned Snider, but a modern, repeating Winchester; and he showed\nhabituation to firing it from his shoulder rather than from the hip after\nthe manner of most Malaitans.\n\nNot satisfied with his position by the board tree, he lowered his gun to\nhis side and crept closer to the pool.  Jerry crouched low and followed.\nSo low did he crouch that his head, extended horizontally forward, was\nmuch lower than his shoulders which were humped up queerly and composed\nthe highest part of him.  When the black paused, Jerry paused, as if\ninstantly frozen.  When the black moved, he moved, but more swiftly,\ncutting down the distance between them.  And all the while the hair of\nhis neck and shoulders bristled in recurrent waves of ferocity and wrath.\nNo golden dog this, ears flattened and tongue laughing in the arms of the\nlady-god, no Sing Song Silly chanting ancient memories in the\ncloud-entanglement of her hair; but a four-legged creature of battle, a\nfanged killer ripe to rend and destroy.\n\nJerry intended to attack as soon as he had crept sufficiently near.  He\nwas unaware of the _Ariel_ taboo against nigger-chasing.  At that moment\nit had no place in his consciousness.  All he knew was that harm\nthreatened the man and woman and that this nigger intended this harm.\n\nSo much had Jerry gained on his quarry, that when again the black\nsquatted for his shot, Jerry deemed he was near enough to rush.  The\nrifle was coming to shoulder when he sprang forward.  Swiftly as he\nsprang, he made no sound, and his victim's first warning was when Jerry's\nbody, launched like a projectile, smote the black squarely between the\nshoulders.  At the same moment his teeth entered the back of the neck,\nbut too near the base in the lumpy shoulder muscles to permit the fangs\nto penetrate to the spinal cord.\n\nIn the first fright of surprise, the black's finger pulled the trigger\nand his throat loosed an unearthly yell.  Knocked forward on his face, he\nrolled over and grappled with Jerry, who slashed cheek-bone and cheek and\nribboned an ear; for it is the way of an Irish terrier to bite repeatedly\nand quickly rather than to hold a bulldog grip.\n\nWhen Harley Kennan, automatic in hand and naked as Adam, reached the\nspot, he found dog and man locked together and tearing up the forest\nmould in their struggle.  The black, his face streaming blood, was\nthrottling Jerry with both hands around his neck; and Jerry, snorting,\nchoking, snarling, was scratching for dear life with the claws of his\nhind feet.  No puppy claws were they, but the stout claws of a mature dog\nthat were stiffened by a backing of hard muscles.  And they ripped naked\nchest and abdomen full length again and again until the whole front of\nthe man was streaming red.  Harley Kennan did not dare chance a shot, so\nclosely were the combatants locked.  Instead, stepping in close; he\nsmashed down the butt of his automatic upon the side of the man's head.\nReleased by the relaxing of the stunned black's hands, Jerry flung\nhimself in a flash upon the exposed throat, and only Harley's hand on his\nneck and Harley's sharp command made him cease and stand clear.  He\ntrembled with rage and continued to snarl ferociously, although he would\ndesist long enough to glance up with his eyes, flatten his ears, and wag\nhis tail each time Harley uttered \"Good boy.\"\n\n\"Good boy\" he knew for praise; and he knew beyond any doubt, by Harley's\nrepetition of it, that he had served him and served him well.\n\n\"Do you know the beggar intended to bush-whack us,\" Harley told Villa,\nwho, half-dressed and still dressing, had joined him.  \"It wasn't fifty\nfeet and he couldn't have missed.  Look at the Winchester.  No old smooth\nbore.  And a fellow with a gun like that would know how to use it.\"\n\n\"But why didn't he?\" she queried.\n\nHer husband pointed to Jerry.\n\nVilla's eyes brightened with quick comprehension.  \"You mean . . . ?\" she\nbegan.\n\nHe nodded.  \"Just that.  Sing Song Silly beat him to it.\"  He bent,\nrolled the man over, and discovered the lacerated back of the neck.\n\"That's where he landed on him first, and he must have had his finger on\nthe trigger, drawing down on you and me, most likely me first, when Sing\nSong Silly broke up his calculations.\"\n\nVilla was only half hearing, for she had Jerry in her arms and was\ncalling him \"Blessed Dog,\" the while she stilled his snarling and soothed\ndown the last bristling hair.\n\nBut Jerry snarled again and was for leaping upon the black when he\nstirred restlessly and dizzily sat up.  Harley removed a knife from\nbetween the bare skin and a belt.\n\n\"What name belong you?\" he demanded.\n\nBut the black had eyes only for Jerry, staring at him in wondering amaze\nuntil he pieced the situation together in his growing clarity of brain\nand realized that such a small chunky animal had spoiled his game.\n\n\"My word,\" he grinned to Harley, \"that fella dog put 'm crimp along me\nany amount.\"\n\nHe felt out the wounds of his neck and face, while his eyes embraced the\nfact that the white master was in possession of his rifle.\n\n\"You give 'm musket belong me,\" he said impudently.\n\n\"I give 'm you bang alongside head,\" was Harley's answer.\n\n\"He doesn't seem to me to be a regular Malaitan,\" he told Villa.  \"In the\nfirst place, where would he get a rifle like that?  Then think of his\nnerve.  He must have seen us drop anchor, and he must have known our\nlaunch was on the beach.  Yet he played to take our heads and get away\nwith them back into the bush--\"\n\n\"What name belong you?\" he again demanded.\n\nBut not until Johnny and the launch crew arrived breathless from their\nrun, did he learn.  Johnny's eyes gloated when he beheld the prisoner,\nand he addressed Kennan in evident excitement.\n\n\"You give 'm me that fella boy,\" he begged.  \"Eh?  You give 'm me that\nfella boy.\"\n\n\"What name you want 'm?\"\n\nNot for some time would Johnny answer this question, and then only when\nKennan told him that there was no harm done and that he intended to let\nthe black go.  At this Johnny protested vehemently.\n\n\"Maybe you fetch 'm that fella boy along Government House, Tulagi,\nGovernment House give 'm you twenty pounds.  Him plenty bad fella boy too\nmuch.  Makawao he name stop along him.  Bad fella boy too much.  Him\nQueensland boy--\"\n\n\"What name Queensland?\" Kennan interrupted.  \"He belong that fella\nplace?\"\n\nJohnny shook his head.\n\n\"Him belong along Malaita first time.  Long time before too much he\nrecruit 'm along schooner go work along Queensland.\"\n\n\"He's a return Queenslander,\" Harley interpreted to Villa.  \"You know,\nwhen Australia went 'all white,' the Queensland plantations had to send\nall the black birds back.  This Makawao is evidently one of them, and a\nhard case as well, if there's anything in Johnny's gammon about twenty\npounds reward for him.  That's a big price for a black.\"\n\nJohnny continued his explanation which, reduced to flat and sober\nEnglish, was to the effect that Makawao had always borne a bad character.\nIn Queensland he had served a total of four years in jail for thefts,\nrobberies, and attempted murder.  Returned to the Solomons by the\nAustralian government, he had recruited on Buli Plantation for the\npurpose--as was afterwards proved--of getting arms and ammunition.  For\nan attempt to kill the manager he had received fifty lashes at Tulagi and\nserved a year.  Returned to Buli Plantation to finish his labour service,\nhe had contrived to kill the owner in the manager's absence and to escape\nin a whaleboat.\n\nIn the whaleboat with him he had taken all the weapons and ammunition of\nthe plantation, the owner's head, ten Malaita recruits, and two recruits\nfrom San Cristobal--the two last because they were salt-water men and\ncould handle the whaleboat.  Himself and the ten Malaitans, being\nbushmen, were too ignorant of the sea to dare the long passage from\nGuadalcanar.\n\nOn the way, he had raided the little islet of Ugi, sacked the store, and\ntaken the head of the solitary trader, a gentle-souled half-caste from\nNorfolk Island who traced back directly to a Pitcairn ancestry straight\nfrom the loins of McCoy of the Bounty.  Arrived safely at Malaita, he and\nhis fellows, no longer having any use for the two San Cristobal boys, had\ntaken their heads and eaten their bodies.\n\n\"My word, him bad fella boy any amount,\" Johnny finished his tale.\n\"Government House, Tulagi, damn glad give 'm twenty pounds along that\nfella.\"\n\n\"You blessed Sing Song Silly,\" Villa, murmured in Jerry's ears.  \"If it\nhadn't been for you--\"\n\n\"Your head and mine would even now be galumping through the bush as\nMakawao hit the high places for home,\" Harley concluded for her.  \"My\nword, some fella dog that, any amount,\" he added lightly.  \"And I gave\nhim merry Ned just the other day for nigger-chasing, and he knew his\nbusiness better than I did all the time.\"\n\n\"If anybody tries to claim him--\" Villa threatened.\n\nHarley confirmed her muttered sentiment with a nod.\n\n\"Any way,\" he said, with a smile, \"there would have been one consolation\nif your head had gone up into the bush.\"\n\n\"Consolation!\" she cried, throaty with indignation.\n\n\"Why, yes; because in that case my head would have gone along.\"\n\n\"You dear and blessed Husband-Man,\" she murmured, a quick cloudiness of\nmoisture in her eyes, as with her eyes she embraced him, her arms still\naround Jerry, who, sensing the ecstasy of the moment, kissed her fragrant\ncheek with his ribbon-tongue of love.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n\nWhen the _Ariel_ cleared from Malu, on the north-west coast of Malaita,\nMalaita sank down beneath the sea-rim astern and, so far as Jerry's life\nwas concerned, remained sunk for ever--another vanished world, that, in\nhis consciousness, partook of the ultimate nothingness that had befallen\nSkipper.  For all Jerry might have known, though he pondered it not,\nMalaita was a universe, beheaded and resting on the knees of some\nbrooding lesser god, himself vastly mightier than Bashti whose knees bore\nthe brooding weight of Skipper's sun-dried, smoke-cured head, this lesser\ngod vexed and questing, feeling and guessing at the dual twin-mysteries\nof time and space and of motion and matter, above, beneath, around, and\nbeyond him.\n\nOnly, in Jerry's case, there was no pondering of the problem, no\nawareness of the existence of such mysteries.  He merely accepted Malaita\nas another world that had ceased to be.  He remembered it as he\nremembered dreams.  Himself a live thing, solid and substantial,\npossessed of weight and dimension, a reality incontrovertible, he moved\nthrough the space and place of being, concrete, hard, quick, convincing,\nan absoluteness of something surrounded by the shades and shadows of the\nfluxing phantasmagoria of nothing.\n\nHe took his worlds one by one.  One by one his worlds evaporated, rose\nbeyond his vision as vapours in the hot alembic of the sun, sank for ever\nbeneath sea-levels, themselves unreal and passing as the phantoms of a\ndream.  The totality of the minute, simple world of the humans,\nmicroscopic and negligible as it was in the siderial universe, was as far\nbeyond his guessing as is the siderial universe beyond the starriest\nguesses and most abysmal imaginings of man.\n\nJerry was never to see the dark island of savagery again, although often\nin his sleeping dreams it was to return to him in vivid illusion, as he\nrelived his days upon it, from the destruction of the _Arangi_ and the\nman-eating orgy on the beach to his flight from the shell-scattered house\nand flesh of Nalasu.  These dream episodes constituted for him another\nland of Otherwhere, mysterious, unreal, and evanescent as clouds drifting\nacross the sky or bubbles taking iridescent form and bursting on the\nsurface of the sea.  Froth and foam it was, quick-vanishing as he awoke,\nnon-existent as Skipper, Skipper's head on the withered knees of Bashti\nin the lofty grass house.  Malaita the real, Malaita the concrete and\nponderable, vanished and vanished for ever, as Meringe had vanished, as\nSkipper had vanished, into the nothingness.\n\nFrom Malaita the _Ariel_ steered west of north to Ongtong Java and to\nTasman--great atolls that sweltered under the Line not quite awash in the\nvast waste of the West South Pacific.  After Tasman was another wide sea-\nstretch to the high island of Bougainville.  Thence, bearing generally\nsouth-east and making slow progress in the dead beat to windward, the\n_Ariel_ dropped anchor in nearly every harbour of the Solomons, from\nChoiseul and Ronongo islands, to the islands of Kulambangra, Vangunu,\nPavuvu, and New Georgia.  Even did she ride to anchor, desolately lonely,\nin the Bay of a Thousand Ships.\n\nLast of all, so far as concerned the Solomons, her anchor rumbled down\nand bit into the coral-sanded bottom of the harbour of Tulagi, where,\nashore on Florida Island, lived and ruled the Resident Commissioner.\n\nTo the Commissioner, Harley Kennan duly turned over Makawao, who was\ncommitted to a grass-house jail, well guarded, to sit in leg-irons\nagainst the time of trial for his many crimes.  And Johnny, the pilot,\nere he returned to the service of the Commissioner, received a fair\nportion of the twenty pounds of head money that Kennan divided among the\nmembers of the launch crew who had raced through the jungle to the rescue\nthe day Jerry had taken Makawao by the back of the neck and startled him\ninto pulling the trigger of his unaimed rifle.\n\n\"I'll tell you his name,\" the Commissioner said, as they sat on the wide\nveranda of his bungalow.  \"It's one of Haggin's terriers--Haggin of\nMeringe Lagoon.  The dog's father is Terrence, the mother is Biddy.  The\ndog's own name is Jerry, for I was present at the christening before ever\nhis eyes were open.  Better yet, I'll show you his brother.  His\nbrother's name is Michael.  He's nigger-chaser on the _Eugenie_, the two-\ntopmast schooner that rides abreast of you.  Captain Kellar is the\nskipper.  I'll have him bring Michael ashore.  Beyond all doubt, this\nJerry is the sole survivor of the _Arangi_.\"\n\n\"When I get the time, and a sufficient margin of funds, I shall pay a\nvisit to Chief Bashti--oh, no British cruiser program.  I'll charter a\ncouple of trading ketches, take my own black police force and as many\nwhite men as I cannot prevent from volunteering.  There won't be any\nshelling of grass houses.  I'll land my shore party down the coast and\ncut in and come down upon Somo from the rear, timing my vessels to arrive\non Somo's sea-front at the same time.\"\n\n\"You will answer slaughter with slaughter?\" Villa Kennan objected.\n\n\"I will answer slaughter with law,\" the Commissioner replied.  \"I will\nteach Somo law.  I hope that no accidents will occur.  I hope that no\nlife will be lost on either side.  I know, however, that I shall recover\nCaptain Van Horn's head, and his mate Borckman's, and bring them back to\nTulagi for Christian burial.  I know that I shall get old Bashti by the\nscruff of the neck and sit him down while I pump law and square-dealing\ninto him.  Of course . . . \"\n\nThe Commissioner, ascetic-looking, an Oxford graduate, narrow-shouldered\nand elderly, tired-eyed and bespectacled like the scholar he was, like\nthe scientist he was, shrugged his shoulders.  \"Of course, if they are\nnot amenable to reason, there may be trouble, and some of them and some\nof us will get hurt.  But, one way or the other, the conclusion will be\nthe same.  Old Bashti will learn that it is expedient to maintain white\nmen's heads on their shoulders.\"\n\n\"But how will he learn?\" Villa Kennan asked.  \"If he is shrewd enough not\nto fight you, and merely sits and listens to your English law, it will be\nno more than a huge joke to him.  He will no more than pay the price of\nlistening to a lecture for any atrocity he commits.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, my dear Mrs. Kennan.  If he listens peaceably to the\nlecture, I shall fine him only a hundred thousand coconuts, five tons of\nivory nut, one hundred fathoms of shell money, and twenty fat pigs.  If\nhe refuses to listen to the lecture and goes on the war path, then,\nunpleasantly for me, I assure you, I shall be compelled to thrash him and\nhis village, first: and, next, I shall triple the fine he must pay and\nlecture the law into him a trifle more compendiously.\"\n\n\"Suppose he doesn't fight, stops his ears to the lecture, and declines to\npay?\" Villa Kennan persisted.\n\n\"Then he shall be my guest, here in Tulagi, until he changes his mind and\nheart, and does pay, and listens to an entire course of lectures.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\nSo it was that Jerry came to hear his old-time name on the lips of Villa\nand Harley, and saw once again his full-brother Michael.\n\n\"Say nothing,\" Harley muttered to Villa, as they made out, peering over\nthe bow of the shore-coming whaleboat, the rough coat, red-wheaten in\ncolour, of Michael.  \"We won't know anything about anything, and we won't\neven let on we're watching what they do.\"\n\nJerry, feigning interest in digging a hole in the sand as if he were on a\nfresh scent, was unaware of Michael's nearness.  In fact, so well had\nJerry feigned that he had forgotten it was all a game, and his interest\nwas very real as he sniffed and snorted joyously in the bottom of the\nhole he had dug.  So deep was it, that all he showed of himself was his\nhind-legs, his rump, and an intelligent and stiffly erect stump of a\ntail.\n\nLittle wonder that he and Michael failed to see each other.  And Michael,\nspilling over with unused vitality from the cramped space of the\n_Eugenie's_ deck, scampered down the beach in a hurly-burly of joy,\nscenting a thousand intimate land-scents as he ran, and describing a\njerky and eccentric course as he made short dashes and good-natured snaps\nat the coconut crabs that scuttled across his path to the safety of the\nwater or reared up and menaced him with formidable claws and a\nspluttering and foaming of the shell-lids of their mouths.\n\nThe beach was only so long.  The end of it reached where rose the rugged\nwall of a headland, and while the Commissioner introduced Captain Kellar\nto Mr. and Mrs. Kennan, Michael came tearing back across the wet-hard\nsand.  So interested was he in everything that he failed to notice the\nsmall rear-end portion of Jerry that was visible above the level surface\nof the beach.  Jerry's ears had given him warning, and, the precise\ninstant that he backed hurriedly up and out of the hole, Michael collided\nwith him.  As Jerry was rolled, and as Michael fell clear over him, both\nerupted into ferocious snarls and growls.  They regained their legs,\nbristled and showed teeth at each other, and stalked stiff-leggedly, in a\nstately and dignified sort of way, as they drew intimidating semi-circles\nabout each other.\n\nBut they were fooling all the while, and were more than a trifle\nembarrassed.  For in each of their brains were bright identification\npictures of the plantation house and compound and beach of Meringe.  They\nknew, but they were reticent of recognition.  No longer puppies, vaguely\nproud of the sedateness of maturity, they strove to be proud and sedate\nwhile all their impulse was to rush together in a frantic ecstasy.\n\nMichael it was, less travelled in the world than Jerry, by nature not so\nself-controlled, who threw the play-acting of dignity to the wind, and,\nwith shrill whinings of emotion, with body-wrigglings of delight, flashed\nout his tongue of love and shouldered his brother roughly in eagerness to\nget near to him.\n\nJerry responded as eagerly with kiss of tongue and contact of shoulder;\nthen both, springing apart, looked at each other, alert and querying,\nalmost in half challenge, Jerry's ears pricked into living\ninterrogations, Michael's one good ear similarly questioning, his\nwithered ear retaining its permanent queer and crinkly cock in the tip of\nit.  As one, they sprang away in a wild scurry down the beach, side by\nside, laughing to each other and occasionally striking their shoulders\ntogether as they ran.\n\n\"No doubt of it,\" said the Commissioner.  \"The very way their father and\nmother run.  I have watched them often.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\nBut, after ten days of comradeship, came the parting.  It was Michael's\nfirst visit on the _Ariel_, and he and Jerry had spent a frolicking half-\nhour on her white deck amid the sound and commotion of hoisting in boats,\nmaking sail, and heaving out anchor.  As the _Ariel_ began to move\nthrough the water and heeled to the filling of her canvas by the brisk\ntrade-wind, the Commissioner and Captain Kellar shook last farewells and\nscrambled down the gang-plank to their waiting whaleboats.  At the last\nmoment Captain Kellar had caught Michael up, tucked him under an arm, and\nwith him dropped into the, sternsheets of his whaleboat.\n\nPainters were cast off, and in the sternsheets of each boat solitary\nwhite men were standing up, heads bared in graciousness of conduct to the\nfurnace-stab of the tropic sun, as they waved additional and final\nfarewells.  And Michael, swept by the contagion of excitement, barked and\nbarked again, as if it were a festival of the gods being celebrated.\n\n\"Say good-bye to your brother, Jerry,\" Villa Kennan prompted in Jerry's\near, as she held him, his quivering flanks between her two palms, on the\nrail where she had lifted him.\n\nAnd Jerry, not understanding her speech, torn about with conflicting\ndesires, acknowledged her speech with wriggling body, a quick back-toss\nof head, and a red flash of kissing tongue, and, the next moment, his\nhead over the rail and lowered to see the swiftly diminishing Michael,\nwas mouthing grief and woe very much akin to the grief and woe his\nmother, Biddy, had mouthed in the long ago, on the beach of Meringe, when\nhe had sailed away with Skipper.\n\nFor Jerry had learned partings, and beyond all peradventure this was a\nparting, though little he dreamed that he would again meet Michael across\nthe years and across the world, in a fabled valley of far California,\nwhere they would live out their days in the hearts and arms of the\nbeloved gods.\n\nMichael, his forefeet on the gunwale, barked to him in a puzzled,\nquestioning sort of way, and Jerry whimpered back incommunicable\nunderstanding.  The lady-god pressed his two flanks together\nreassuringly, and he turned to her, his cool nose touched questioningly\nto her cheek.  She gathered his body close against her breast in one\nencircling arm, her free hand resting on the rail, half-closed, a pink-\nand-white heart of flower, fragrant and seducing.  Jerry's nose quested\nthe way of it.  The aperture invited.  With snuggling, budging, and\nnudging-movements he spread the fingers slightly wider as his nose\npenetrated into the sheer delight and loveliness of her hand.\n\nHe came to rest, his golden muzzle soft-enfolded to the eyes, and was\nvery still, all forgetful of the _Ariel_ showing her copper to the sun\nunder the press of the wind, all forgetful of Michael growing small in\nthe distance as the whaleboat grew small astern.  No less still was\nVilla.  Both were playing the game, although to her it was new.\n\nAs long as he could possibly contain himself, Jerry maintained his\nstiffness.  And then, his love bursting beyond the control of him, he\ngave a sniff--as prodigious a one as he had sniffed into the tunnel of\nSkipper's hand in the long ago on the deck of the _Arangi_.  And, as\nSkipper had relaxed into the laughter of love, so did the lady-god now.\nShe gurgled gleefully.  Her fingers tightened, in a caress that almost\nhurt, on Jerry's muzzle.  Her other hand and arm crushed him against her\ntill he gasped.  Yet all the while his stump of tail valiantly bobbed\nback and forth, and, when released from such blissful contact, his silky\nears flattened back and down as, with first a scarlet slash of tongue to\ncheek, he seized her hand between his teeth and dented the soft skin with\na love bite that did not hurt.\n\nAnd so, for Jerry, vanished Tulagi, its Commissioner's bungalow on top of\nthe hill, its vessels riding to anchor in the harbour, and Michael, his\nfull blood-brother.  He had grown accustomed to such vanishments.  In\nsuch way had vanished as in the mirage of a dream, Meringe, Somo, and the\n_Arangi_.  In such way had vanished all the worlds and harbours and\nroadsteads and atoll lagoons where the _Ariel_ had lifted her laid anchor\nand gone on across and over the erasing sea-rim.\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK JERRY OF THE ISLANDS***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 1161.txt or 1161.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/1\/1\/6\/1161\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":126,"split":"train"}
