It happened on that\nday that the yacht Falcon lay becalmed upon the ocean between the\nCanaries and the Madeira Islands. This yacht Falcon was the property\nof Lord Featherstone, who, being weary of life in England, had taken\na few congenial friends for a winter's cruise in these southern\nlatitudes. They had visited the Azores, the Canaries, and the Madeira\nIslands, and were now on their way to the Mediterranean.\n\nThe wind had failed, a deep calm had succeeded, and everywhere, as far\nas the eye could reach, the water was smooth and glassy. The yacht\nrose and fell at the impulse of the long ocean undulations, and the\ncreaking of the spars sounded out a lazy accompaniment to the motion\nof the vessel. All around was a watery horizon, except in the one\nplace only, toward the south, where far in the distance the Peak of\nTeneriffe rose into the air.\n\nThe profound calm, the warm atmosphere, the slow pitching of the\nyacht, and the dull creaking of the spars all combined to lull into a\nstate of indolent repose the people on board. Forward were the crew;\nsome asleep, others smoking, others playing cards. At the stern were\nOxenden, the intimate friend of Featherstone, and Dr. Congreve, who\nhad come in the double capacity of friend and medical attendant.\nThese two, like the crew, were in a state of dull and languid\nrepose. Suspended between the two masts, in an Indian hammock, lay\nFeatherstone, with a cigar in his mouth and a novel in his hand, which\nhe was pretending to read. The fourth member of the party, Melick, was\nseated near the mainmast, folding some papers in a peculiar way. His\noccupation at length attracted the roving eyes of Featherstone, who\npoked forth his head from his hammock, and said in a sleepy voice:\n\n\"I say, Melick, you're the most energetic fellah I ever saw. By Jove!\nyou're the only one aboard that's busy. What are you doing?\"\n\n\"Paper boats,\" said Melick, in a business-like tone.\n\n\"Paper boats! By Jove!\" said Featherstone. \"What for?\"\n\n\"I'm going to have a regatta,\" said Melick. \"Anything to kill time,\nyou know.\"\n\n\"By Jove!\" exclaimed Featherstone again, raising himself higher in his\nhammock, \"that's not a bad idea. A wegatta! By Jove! glowious!\nglowious! I say, Oxenden, did you hear that?\"\n\n\"What do you mean by a regatta?\" asked Oxenden, lazily.\n\n\"Oh, I mean a race with these paper boats. We can bet on them,\nyou know.\"\n\nAt this Featherstone sat upright, with his legs dangling out of\nthe hammock.\n\n\"By Jove!\" he exclaimed again. \"Betting! So we can. Do you know,\nMelick, old chap, I think that's a wegular piece of inspiration.\nA wegatta! and we can bet on the best boat.\"\n\n\"But there isn't any wind,\" said Oxenden.\n\n\"Well, you know, that's the fun of it,\" said Melick, who went solemnly\non as he spoke, folding his paper boats; \"that's the fun of it. For\nyou see if there was a wind we should be going on ourselves, and the\nregatta couldn't come off; but, as it is, the water is just right.\nYou pick out your boat, and lay your bet on her to race to some given\npoint.\"\n\n\"A given point? But how can we find any?\"\n\n\"Oh, easily enough; something or anything--a bubble'll do, or we can\npitch out a bit of wood.\"\n\nUpon this Featherstone descended from his perch, and came near to\nexamine the proceedings, while the other two, eager to take advantage\nof the new excitement, soon joined him. By this time Melick had\nfinished his paper boats. There were four of them, and they were made\nof different colors, namely, red, green, yellow, and white.\n\n\"I'll put these in the water,\" said Melick, \"and then we can lay our\nbets on them as we choose. But first let us see if there is anything\nthat can be taken as a point of arrival. If there isn't anything, I\ncan pitch out a bit of wood, in any direction which may seem best.\"\n\nSaying this, he went to the side, followed by the others, and all\nlooked out carefully over the water.\n\n\"There's a black speck out there,\" said Oxenden.\n\n\"So there is,\" said Featherstone. \"That'll do. I wonder what it is?\"\n\n\"Oh, a bit of timber,\" said Melick. \"Probably the spar of some ship.\"\n\n\"It don't look like a spar,\" said the doctor; \"it's only a round spot,\nlike the float of some net.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's a spar,\" said Melick. \"It's one end of it, the rest is under\nwater.\"\n\nThe spot thus chosen was a dark, circular object, about a hundred\nyards away, and certainly did look very much like the extremity of\nsome spar, the rest of which was under water. Whatever it was,\nhowever, it served well enough for their present purpose, and no one\ntook any further interest in it, except as the point toward which the\npaper boats should run in their eventful race.\n\nMelick now let himself down over the side, and placed the paper boats\non the water as carefully as possible. After this the four stood\nwatching the little fleet in silence. The water was perfectly still,\nand there was no perceptible wind, but there were draughts of air\ncaused by the rise and fall of the yacht, and these affected the tiny\nboats. Gradually they drew apart, the green one drifting astern, the\nyellow one remaining under the vessel, while the red and the white\nwere carried out in the direction where they were expected to go, with\nabout a foot of space between them.\n\n\"Two to one on the red!\" cried Featherstone, betting on the one which\nhad gained the lead.\n\n\"Done,\" said Melick, promptly taking his offer.\n\nOxenden made the same bet, which was taken by Melick and the doctor.\n\nOther bets were now made as to the direction which they would take, as\nto the distance by which the red would beat the white, as to the time\nwhich would be occupied by the race, and as to fifty other things\nwhich need not be mentioned. All took part in this; the excitement\nrose high and the betting went on merrily. At length it was noticed\nthat the white was overhauling the red. The excitement grew intense;\nthe betting changed its form, but was still kept up, until at last\nthe two paper boats seemed blended together in one dim spot which\ngradually faded out of sight.\n\nIt was now necessary to determine the state of the race, so\nFeatherstone ordered out the boat. The four were soon embarked, and\nthe men rowed out toward the point which had been chosen as the end of\nthe race. On coming near they found the paper boats stuck together,\nsaturated with water, and floating limp on the surface. An animated\ndiscussion arose about this. Some of the bets were off, but others\nremained an open question, and each side insisted upon a different\nview of the case. In the midst of this, Featherstone's attention was\ndrawn to the dark spot already mentioned as the goal of the race.\n\n\"That's a queer-looking thing,\" said he, suddenly. \"Pull up, lads, a\nlittle; let's see what it is. It doesn't look to me like a spar.\"\n\nThe others, always on the lookout for some new object of interest,\nwere attracted by these words, and looked closely at the thing in\nquestion. The men pulled. The boat drew nearer.\n\n\"It's some sort of floating vessel,\" said Oxenden.\n\n\"It's not a spar,\" said Melick, who was at the bow.\n\nAnd as he said this he reached out and grasped at it. He failed to get\nit, and did no more than touch it. It moved easily and sank, but soon\ncame up again. A second time he grasped at it, and with both hands.\nThis time he caught it, and then lifted it out of the water into the\nboat. These proceedings had been watched with the deepest interest;\nand now, as this curious floating thing made its appearance among\nthem, they all crowded around it in eager excitement.\n\n\"It looks like a can of preserved meat,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"It certainly is a can,\" said Melick, \"for it's made of metal; but as\nto preserved meat, I have my doubts.\"\n\nThe article in question was made of metal and was cylindrical in\nshape. It was soldered tight and evidently contained something. It was\nabout eighteen inches long and eight wide. The nature of the metal was\nnot easily perceptible, for it was coated with slime, and covered over\nabout half its surface with barnacles and sea-weed. It was not heavy,\nand would have floated higher out of the water had it not been for\nthese encumbrances.\n\n\"It's some kind of preserved meat,\" said the doctor. \"Perhaps\nsomething good--game, I dare say--yes, Yorkshire game-pie. They pot\nall sorts of things now.\"\n\n\"If it's game,\" said Oxenden, \"it'll be rather high by this time. Man\nalive! look at those weeds and shells. It must have been floating for\nages.\"\n\n\"It's my belief,\" said Featherstone, \"that it's part of the provisions\nlaid in by Noah for his long voyage in the ark. So come, let's open\nit, and see what sort of diet the antediluvians had.\"\n\n\"It may be liquor,\" said Oxenden.\n\nMelick shook his head.\n\n\"No,\" said he; \"there's something inside, but whatever it is, it isn't\nliquor. It's odd, too. The thing is of foreign make, evidently. I\nnever saw anything like it before. It may be Chinese.\"\n\n\"By Jove!\" cried Featherstone, \"this is getting exciting. Let's go\nback to the yacht and open it.\"\n\nThe men rowed back to the yacht.\n\n\"It's meat of some sort,\" continued the doctor. \"I'm certain of that.\nIt has come in good time. We can have it for dinner.\"\n\n\"You may have my share, then,\" said Oxenden. \"I hereby give and\nbequeath to you all my right, title, and interest in and to anything\nin the shape of meat that may be inside.\"\n\n\"Meat cans,\" said Melick, \"are never so large as that.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know about that,\" said the doctor, \"they make up pretty\nlarge packages of pemmican for the arctic expeditions.\"\n\n\"But they never pack up pemmican in copper cylinders,\" said Melick,\nwho had been using his knife to scrape off the crust from the vessel.\n\n\"Copper!\" exclaimed Oxenden. \"Is it copper?\"\n\n\"Look for yourselves,\" said Melick, quietly.\n\nThey all looked, and could see, where the knife had cut into the\nvessel, that it was as he said. It was copper.\n\n\"It's foreign work,\" said Melick. \"In England we make tin cans for\neverything. It may be something that's drifted out from Mogadore or\nsome port in Morocco.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said Oxenden, \"it may contain the mangled remains of\none of the wives of some Moorish pasha.\"\n\nBy this time they had reached the yacht and hurried aboard. All were\neager to satisfy their curiosity. Search was made for a cold-chisel,\nbut to no purpose. Then Featherstone produced a knife which was used\nto open sardine boxes, but after a faithful trial this proved useless.\nAt length Melick, who had gone off in search of something more\neffective, made his appearance armed with an axe. With this he\nattacked the copper cylinder, and by means of a few dexterous blows\nsucceeded in cutting it open. Then he looked in.\n\n\"What do you see?\" asked Featherstone.\n\n\"Something,\" said Melick, \"but I can't quite make it out.\"\n\n\"If you can't make it out, then shake it out,\" said Oxenden.\n\nUpon this Melick took the cylinder, turned it upside down, shook it\nsmartly, and then lifted it and pounded it against the deck. This\nserved to loosen the contents, which seemed tightly packed, but came\ngradually down until at length they could be seen and drawn forth.\nMelick drew them forth, and the contents of the mysterious copper\ncylinder resolved themselves into two packages.\n\nThe sight of these packages only served to intensify their curiosity.\nIf it had been some species of food it would at once have revealed\nitself, but these packages suggested something more important. What\ncould they be? Were there treasures inside--jewels, or golden\nornaments from some Moorish seraglio, or strange coin from far Cathay?\n\nOne of the packages was very much larger than the other. It was\nenclosed in wrappers made of some coarse kind of felt, bound tight\nwith strong cords. The other was much smaller, and, was folded in the\nsame material without being bound. This Melick seized and began to\nopen.\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" said Featherstone. \"Let's make a bet on it. Five\nguineas that it's some sort of jewels!\"\n\n\"Done,\" said Oxenden.\n\nMelick opened the package, and it was seen that Featherstone had lost.\nThere were no jewels, but one or two sheets of something that looked\nlike paper. It was not paper, however, but some vegetable product\nwhich was used for the same purpose. The surface was smooth, but the\ncolor was dingy, and the lines of the vegetable fibres were plainly\ndiscernible. These sheets were covered with writing.\n\n\"Halloa!\" cried Melick. \"Why, this is English!\"\n\nAt this the others crowded around to look on, and Featherstone in his\nexcitement forgot that he had lost his bet. There were three sheets,\nall covered with writing--one in English, another in French, and a\nthird in German. It was the same message, written in these three\ndifferent languages. But at that moment they scarcely noticed this.\nAll that they saw was the message itself, with its mysterious meaning.\n\nIt was as follows:\n\n\n\"To the finder of this:\n\n\"Sir,--I am an Englishman, and have been carried by a series of\nincredible events to a land from which escape is as impossible as from\nthe grave. I have written this and committed it to the sea, in the\nhope that the ocean currents may bear it within the reach of civilized\nman. Oh, unknown friend! whoever you are. I entreat you to let this\nmessage be made known in some way to my father, Henry More, Keswick,\nCumberland, England, so that he may learn the fate of his son. The MS.\naccompanying this contains an account of my adventures, which I should\nlike to have forwarded to him. Do this for the sake of that mercy\nwhich you may one day wish to have shown to yourself.\n\n\"ADAM MORE.\"\n\n\n\"By Jove!\" cried Featherstone, as he read the above, \"this is really\ngetting to be something tremendous.\"\n\n\"This other package must be the manuscript,\" said Oxenden, \"and it'll\ntell all about it.\"\n\n\"Such a manuscript'll be better than meat,\" said the doctor,\nsententiously.\n\nMelick said nothing, but, opening his knife, he cut the cords and\nunfolded the wrapper. He saw a great collection of leaves, just like\nthose of the letter, of some vegetable substance, smooth as paper, and\ncovered with writing.\n\n\"It looks like Egyptian papyrus,\" said the doctor. \"That was the\ncommon paper of antiquity.\"\n\n\"Never mind the Egyptian papyrus,\" said Featherstone, in feverish\ncuriosity. \"Let's have the contents of the manuscript. You, Melick,\nread; you're the most energetic of the lot, and when you're tired the\nrest of us will take turns.\"\n\n\"Read? Why, it'll take a month to read all this,\" said Melick.\n\n\"All the better,\" said Featherstone; \"this calm will probably last a\nmonth, and we shall have nothing to interest us.\"\n\nMelick made no further objection. He was as excited as the rest, and\nso he began the reading of the manuscript.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nADRIFT IN THE ANTARCTIC OCEAN\n\n\nMy name is Adam More. I am the son of Henry More, apothecary, Keswick,\nCumberland. I was mate of the ship Trevelyan (Bennet, master), which\nwas chartered by the British Government to convey convicts to Van\nDieman's Land. This was in 1843. We made our voyage without any\ncasualty, landed our convicts in Hobart Town, and then set forth on\nour return home. It was the 17th of December when we left. From the\nfirst adverse winds prevailed, and in order to make any progress we\nwere obliged to keep well to the south. At length, on the 6th of\nJanuary, we sighted Desolation Island. We found it, indeed, a desolate\nspot. In its vicinity we saw a multitude of smaller islands, perhaps a\nthousand in number, which made navigation difficult, and forced us to\nhurry away as fast as possible. But the aspect of this dreary spot was\nof itself enough to repel us. There were no trees, and the multitude\nof islands seemed like moss-covered rocks; while the temperature,\nthough in the middle of the antarctic summer, was from 38 to 58\ndegrees Fahr.\n\nIn order to get rid of these dangerous islands we stood south and\nwest, and at length found ourselves in south latitude 65 degrees,\nlongitude 60 degrees east. We were fortunate enough not to find any\nice, although we were within fifteen hundred miles of the South Pole,\nand far within that impenetrable icy barrier which, in 1773, had\narrested the progress of Captain Cook. Here the wind failed us, and we\nlay becalmed and drifting. The sea was open all around us, except to\nthe southeast, where there was a low line along the horizon\nterminating in a lofty promontory; but though it looked like land we\ntook it for ice. All around us whales and grampuses were gambolling\nand spouting in vast numbers. The weather was remarkably fine and\nclear.\n\n For two or three days the calm continued, and we drifted along\nhelplessly, until at length we found ourselves within a few miles of\nthe promontory above mentioned. It looked like land, and seemed to be\na rocky island rising from the depths of the sea. It was, however, all\ncovered with ice and snow, and from this there extended eastward as\nfar as the eye could reach an interminable line of ice, but toward the\nsouthwest the sea seemed open to navigation. The promontory was very\nsingular in shape, rising up to a peak which was at least a thousand\nfeet in height, and forming a striking object, easily discovered and\nreadily identified by any future explorer. We named it, after our\nship, Trevelyan Peak, and then felt anxious to lose sight of it\nforever. But the calm continued, and at length we drifted in close\nenough to see immense flocks of seals dotting the ice at the foot of\nthe peak.\n\nUpon this I proposed to Agnew, the second mate, that we should go\nashore, shoot some seals, and bring them back. This was partly for the\nexcitement of the hunt, and partly for the honor of landing in a place\nnever before trodden by the foot of man. Captain Bennet made some\nobjections, but he was old and cautious, and we were young and\nventuresome, so we laughed away his scruples and set forth. We did not\ntake any of the crew, owing to the captain's objections. He said that\nif we chose to throw away our own lives he could not help it, but that\nhe would positively refuse to allow a single man to go with us. We\nthought this refusal an excess of caution amounting to positive\ncowardice, but were unable to change his mind. The distance was not\ngreat, the adventure was attractive, and so the captain's gig was\nlowered, and in this Agnew and I rowed ashore. We took with us a\ndouble-barrelled rifle apiece, and also a pistol. Agnew took a glass.\n\nWe rowed for about three miles, and reached the edge of the ice, which\nextended far out from the promontory. Here we landed, and secured the\nboat by means of a small grappling-iron, which we thrust into the ice.\nWe then walked toward the promontory for about a mile, and here we\nfound a multitude of seals. These animals were so fearless that they\nmade not the slightest movement as we came up, but stared at us in an\nindifferent way. We killed two or three, and then debated whether to\ngo to the promontory or not. Agnew was eager to go, so as to touch the\nactual rock; but I was satisfied with what we had done, and was now\ndesirous of returning. In the midst of this I felt a flake of snow on\nmy cheek. I started and looked up. To my great surprise I saw that the\nsky had changed since I had last noticed it. When we left the ship it\nwas clear and blue, but now it was overspread with dark,\nleaden-colored clouds, and the snow-flakes that had fallen were\nominous of evil. A snow-storm here, in the vicinity of the ice, was\ntoo serious a thing to be disregarded. But one course now remained,\nand that was an immediate return to the ship.\n\nEach of us seized a seal and dragged it after us to the boat. We\nreached it and flung them in. Just at that moment a gun sounded over\nthe water. It was from the ship--the signal of alarm--the summons from\nthe captain for our return. We saw now that she had been drifting\nsince we left her, and had moved southwest several miles. The row back\npromised to be far harder than the pull ashore, and, what was worse,\nthe wind was coming up, the sea was rising, and the snow was\nthickening. Neither of us said a word. We saw that our situation was\nvery serious, and that we had been very foolhardy; but the words were\nuseless now. The only thing to be done was to pull for the ship with\nall our strength, and that was what we did.\n\nSo we pushed off, and rowed as we had never rowed before. Our progress\nwas difficult. The sea grew steadily rougher; the wind increased; the\nsnow thickened; and, worst of all, the day was drawing to a close. We\nhad miscalculated both as to distance and time. Even if it had\ncontinued calm we should have had to row back in the dark; but now the\nsun was setting, and with the darkness we had to encounter the\ngathering storm and the blinding snow. We rowed in silence. At every\nstroke our situation grew more serious. The wind was from the south,\nand therefore favored us to some extent, and also made less of a sea\nthan would have been produced by a wind from any other quarter; but\nthen this south wind brought dangers of its own, which we were soon to\nfeel--new dangers and worse ones. For this south wind drove the ship\nfarther from us, and at the same time broke up the vast fields of ice\nand impelled the fractured masses northward. But this was a danger\nwhich we did not know just then. At that time we were rowing for the\nship, and amid the darkness and the blinding snow and the dashing\nwaves we heard from time to time the report of signal-guns fired from\nthe ship to guide us back. These were our only guide, for the darkness\nand the snow had drawn the ship from our sight, and we had to be\nguided by our hearing only.\n\nWe were rowing for our lives, and we knew it; but every moment our\nsituation grew more desperate. Each new report of the gun seemed to\nsound farther away. We seemed always to be rowing in the wrong\ndirection. At each report we had to shift the boat's course somewhat,\nand pull toward the last point from which the gun seemed to sound.\nWith all this the wind was increasing rapidly to a gale, the sea was\nrising and breaking over the boat, the snow was blinding us with its\never-thickening sleet. The darkness deepened and at length had grown\nso intense that nothing whatever could be seen--neither sea nor sky,\nnot even the boat itself--yet we dared not stop; we had to row. Our\nlives depended on our efforts. We had to row, guided by the sound of\nthe ship's gun, which the ever-varying wind incessantly changed, till\nour minds grew all confused, and we rowed blindly and mechanically.\n\nSo we labored for hours at the oars, and the storm continually\nincreased, and the sea continually rose, while the snow fell thicker\nand the darkness grew intenser. The reports of the gun now grew\nfainter; what was worse, they were heard at longer intervals, and this\nshowed us that Captain Bennet was losing heart; that he was giving us\nup; that he despaired of finding us, and was now firing only an\noccasional gun out of a mournful sense of duty. This thought reduced\nus to despair. It seemed as if all our efforts had only served to take\nus farther away from the ship, and deprived us of all motive for\nrowing any harder than was barely necessary to keep the boat steady.\nAfter a time Agnew dropped his oar and began to bail out the boat--a\nwork which was needed; for, in spite of our care, she had shipped many\nseas, and was one third full of water. He worked away at this while I\nmanaged the boat, and then we took turns at bailing. In this way we\npassed the dreary night.\n\nMorning came at last. The wind was not so violent, but the snow was so\nthick that we could only see for a little distance around us. The ship\nwas nowhere visible, nor were there any signs of her. The last gun had\nbeen fired during the night. All that we could see was the outline of\na gaunt iceberg--an ominous spectacle. Not knowing what else to do we\nrowed on as before, keeping in what seemed our best course, though\nthis was mere conjecture, and we knew all the time that we might be\ngoing wrong. There was no compass in the boat, nor could we tell the\nsun's position through the thick snow. We rowed with the wind,\nthinking that it was blowing toward the north, and would carry us in\nthat direction. We still hoped to come within sound of the ship's gun,\nand kept straining our ears incessantly to hear the wished-for report.\nBut no such sound ever came again, and we heard nothing except the\nplash of the waves and the crash of breaking ice. Thus all that day we\nrowed along, resting at intervals when exhausted, and then resuming\nour labors, until at length night came; and again to the snow and ice\nand waves was added the horror of great darkness. We passed that night\nin deep misery. We had eaten nothing since we left the ship, but\nthough exhausted by long fasting and severe labor, the despair of our\nhearts took away all desire for food. We were worn out with hard work,\nyet the cold was too great to allow us to take rest, and we were\ncompelled to row so as to keep ourselves from perishing. But fatigue\nand drowsiness overcame us, and we often sank into sleep even while\nrowing; and then after a brief slumber we would awake with benumbed\nlimbs to wrestle again with the oars. In this way we passed that\nnight.\n\nAnother morning came, and we found to our great joy that the snow had\nceased. We looked eagerly around to see if there were any signs of the\nship. Nothing could be seen of her. Far away on one side rose a peak,\nwhich looked like the place where we had landed. Judging from the\nwind, which we still supposed to be southerly, the peak lay toward the\nnortheast; in which case we had been carried steadily, in spite of all\nour efforts, toward the south. About a mile on one side of us the ice\nbegan, and extended far away; while on the other side, at the distance\nof some ten miles, there was another line of ice. We seemed to have\nbeen carried in a southwesterly direction along a broad strait that\nran into the vast ice-fields. This discovery showed how utterly\nuseless our labors had been; for in spite of all, even with the wind\nin our favor, we had been drawn steadily in an opposite direction. It\nwas evident that there was some current here, stronger than all our\nstrength, which had brought us to this place.\n\nWe now determined to land on the ice, and try to cook a portion of our\nseals. On approaching it we noticed that there was a current which\ntended to draw us past the ice in what I supposed to be a\nsouthwesterly direction. This confirmed my worst fears. But now the\nlabor of landing and building a fire on the ice served to interest us\nfor a time and divert our thoughts. We brushed away the snow, and then\nbroke up a box which was in the boat, and also the stern seats. This\nwe used very sparingly, reserving the rest for another occasion. Then\nwe cut portions from one of the seals, and laid them in thin strips on\nthe flames. The cooking was but slight, for the meat was merely\nsinged; but we were ravenous, and the contact of the fire was enough\nto give it an attractive flavor. With this food we were greatly\nrefreshed; and as for drink, we had all around us an endless extent of\nice and snow. Then, taking our precious fragments of cooked meat, we\nreturned to the boat and put off. We could scarcely tell what to do\nnext, and while debating on this point we fell asleep. We slept far\ninto the night, then awoke benumbed with cold; then took to the oars\ntill we were weary; then fell asleep again, to be again awakened by\nthe cold and again to pull at the oars. So the night passed, and\nanother day came.\n\nThe snow still held off, but the sky was overcast with dark,\nleaden-colored clouds, and looked threatening. Ice was all around us\nas before; and the open water had diminished now from ten miles to\nfive miles of width. The ice on one side was low, but on the opposite\nside it arose to the height of one hundred feet. We saw here, as we\nwatched the shore, that the current which had already borne us thus\nfar was now stronger than ever, and was carrying us along at a rate\nwhich made all efforts of ours against it utterly useless. And now a\ndebate arose between us as to the direction of this current. Agnew\nsuddenly declared his belief that it was running north, while I was\nfirm in the conviction that it ran south.\n\n\"There's no use rowing any more,\" said Agnew. \"If it runs south we\ncan't resist it. It's too strong. But I always like to look on the\nbright side, and so I believe it runs north. In that case there is no\nuse rowing, for it will carry us along fast enough.\"\n\nThen I proposed that we should go ashore on the ice. To this Agnew\nobjected, but afterward consented, at my earnest request. So we tried\nto get ashore, but this time found it impossible; for the ice\nconsisted of a vast sheet of floating lumps, which looked like the\nruin of bergs that had been broken up in some storm. After this I had\nnothing to say, nor was there anything left for us but to drift\nwherever the current might carry us.\n\nSo we drifted for some days, Agnew all the time maintaining that we\nwere going north, while I was sure that we were going south. The sky\nremained as cloudy as ever, the wind varied incessantly, and there was\nnothing by which we could conjecture the points of the compass. We\nlived on our seal, and for drink we chewed ice and snow. One thing was\ncertain--the climate was no colder. Agnew laid great stress on this.\n\n\"You see,\" said he, \"we must be going north. If we were going south we\nshould be frozen stiff by this time.\"\n\n\"Yes; but if we were going north,\" said I, \"we ought to find it\ngrowing warmer.\"\n\n\"No,\" said he, \"not with all this ice around us. It's the ice that\nkeeps the temperature in this cold state.\"\n\nArgument could do no good, and so we each remained true to our\nbelief--his leading him to hope, and mine dragging me down to despair.\nAt length we finished the last fragment of the seal that we had\ncooked, and, finding ourselves near some firm ice, we went ashore and\ncooked all that was left, using the remainder of our wood for fuel,\nand all that we dared to remove from the boat. Re-embarking with this,\nwe drifted on as before.\n\nSeveral more days passed. At last one night I was roused by Agnew. He\npointed far away to the distant horizon, where I saw a deep red glow\nas of fire. We were both filled with wonder at the sight, and were\nutterly unable to account for it. We knew that it could not be caused\nby the sun or the moon, for it was midnight, and the cause lay on the\nearth and not in the skies. It was a deep, lurid glow, extending along\nthe horizon, and seemed to be caused by some vast conflagration.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nA WORLD OF FIRE AND DESOLATION\n\n\nAt the sight of that deep-red glow various feelings arose within us:\nin me there was new dejection; in Agnew there was stronger hope. I\ncould not think but that it was our ship that was on fire, and was\nburning before our eyes. Agnew thought that it was some burning\nforest, and that it showed our approach to some habitable and\ninhabited land. For hour after hour we watched, and all the time the\ncurrent drew us nearer, and the glow grew brighter and more intense.\nAt last we were too weak to watch any longer, and we fell asleep.\n\nOn waking our first thoughts were about the fire, and we looked\neagerly around. It was day, but the sky was as gloomy as ever, and the\nfire was there before our eyes, bright and terrible. We could now see\nit plainly, and discern the cause also. The fire came from two points,\nat some distance apart--two peaks rising above the horizon, from which\nthere burst forth flames and smoke with incessant explosions. All was\nnow manifest. It was no burning ship, no blazing forest, no land\ninhabited by man: those blazing peaks were two volcanoes in a state of\nactive eruption, and at that sight I knew the worst.\n\n\"I know where we are now,\" I said, despairingly.\n\n\"Where?\" asked Agnew.\n\n\"That,\" said I, \"is the antarctic continent.\"\n\n\"The antarctic fiddlestick,\" said he, contemptuously. \"It is far more\nlikely to be some volcanic island in the South Sea. There's a\ntremendous volcano in the Sandwich Islands, and these are something\nlike it.\"\n\n\"I believe,\" said I, \"that these are the very volcanoes that Sir James\nRoss discovered last year.\"\n\n\"Do you happen to know where he found them?\" Agnew asked.\n\n\"I do not,\" I answered.\n\n\"Well, I do,\" said he, \"and they're thousands of miles away from this.\nThey are south latitude 77 degrees, east longitude 167 degrees; while\nwe, as I guess, are about south latitude 40 degrees, east longitude\n60 degrees.\"\n\n\"At any rate,\" said I, \"we're drifting straight toward them.\"\n\n\"So I see,\" said Agnew, dryly. \"At any rate, the current will take us\nsomewhere. We shall find ourselves carried past these volcanic\nislands, or through them, and then west to the Cape of Good Hope.\nBesides, even here we may find land with animals and vegetation; who\nknows?\"\n\n\"What! amid all this ice?\" I cried. \"Are you mad?\"\n\n\"Mad?\" said he; \"I should certainly go mad if I hadn't hope.\"\n\n\"Hope!\" I repeated; \"I have long since given up hope.\"\n\n\"Oh, well,\" said he, \"enjoy your despair, and don't try to deprive me\nof my consolation. My hope sustains me, and helps me to cheer you up.\nIt would never do, old fellow, for both of us to knock under.\"\n\nI said nothing more, nor did Agnew. We drifted on, and all our\nthoughts were taken up with the two volcanoes, toward which we were\nevery moment drawing nearer. As we approached they grew larger and\nlarger, towering up to a tremendous height. I had seen Vesuvius and\nStromboli and AEtna and Cotopaxi; but these appeared far larger than\nany of them, not excepting the last. They rose, like the Peak of\nTeneriffe, abruptly from the sea, with no intervening hills to dwarf\nor diminish their proportions. They were ten or twelve miles apart,\nand the channel of water in which we were drifting flowed between\nthem.\n\nHere the ice and snow ended. We thus came at last to land; but it was\na land that seemed more terrible than even the bleak expanse of ice\nand snow that lay behind, for nothing could be seen except a vast and\ndrear accumulation of lava-blocks of every imaginable shape, without\na trace of vegetation--uninhabited, uninhabitable, and unpassable to\nman. But just where the ice ended and the rocks began there was a\nlong, low reef, which projected for more than a quarter of a mile into\nthe water, affording the only possible landing-place within sight.\nHere we decided to land, so as to rest and consider what was best to\nbe done.\n\nHere we landed, and walked up to where rugged lava-blocks prevented\nany further progress. But at this spot our attention was suddenly\narrested by a sight of horror. It was a human figure lying prostrate,\nface downward.\n\nAt this sight there came over us a terrible sensation. Even Agnew's\nbuoyant soul shrank back, and we stared at each other with quivering\nlips. It was some time before we could recover ourselves; then we went\nto the figure, and stooped down to examine it.\n\nThe clothes were those of a European and a sailor; the frame was\nemaciated and dried up, till it looked like a skeleton; the face was\nblackened and all withered, and the bony hands were clinched tight. It\nwas evidently some sailor who had suffered shipwreck in these\nfrightful solitudes, and had drifted here to starve to death in this\nappalling wilderness. It was a sight which seemed ominous of our own\nfate, and Agnew's boasted hope, which had so long upheld him, now sank\ndown into a despair as deep as my own. What room was there now for\nhope, or how could we expect any other fate than this?\n\nAt length I began to search the pockets of the deceased.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" asked Agnew, in a hoarse voice.\n\n\"I'm trying to find out who he is,\" I said. \"Perhaps there may be\npapers.\"\n\nAs I said this I felt something in the breast-pocket of his jacket,\nand drew it forth. It was a leather pocket-book, mouldy and rotten\nlike the clothing. On opening it, it fell to pieces. There was nothing\nin it but a piece of paper, also mouldy and rotten. This I unfolded\nwith great care, and saw writing there, which, though faded, was still\nlegible. It was a letter, and there were still signs of long and\nfrequent perusals, and marks, too, which looked as though made by\ntears--tears, perhaps of the writer, perhaps of the reader: who can\ntell? I have preserved this letter ever since, and I now fasten it\nhere upon this sheet of my manuscript.\n\n\nTHE LETTER.\n\n\"Bristol April 20. 1820.\n\n\"my darling tom\n\n\"i writ you these few lines in hast i don like youar gon a walen an in\nthe south sea dont go darlin tom or mebbe ill never se you agin for\nave bad drems of you darlin tom an im afraid so don go my darlin tom\nbut come back an take anoth ship for America baby i as wel as ever but\nmises is pa an as got a new tooth an i think yo otnt go a walen o\ndarlin tom * * * sea as the wages was i in New York an better go thar\nan id like to go ther for good for they gives good wages in America. O\ncome back my Darlin tom and take me to America an the baby an weel all\nlive an love an di together\n\n\"Your loving wife Polley Reed.\"\n\n\nI began to read this, but there came a lump in my throat, and I had to\nstop. Agnew leaned on my shoulder, and we both read it in silence. He\nrubbed the back of his hand over his eyes and drew a long breath. Then\nhe walked away for a little distance, and I put the letter carefully\naway in my own pocket-book. After a little while Agnew came back.\n\n\"More,\" said he, \"do you remember any of the burial-service?\"\n\nI understood his meaning at once.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"some of it--a good deal of it, I think.\"\n\n\"That's good,\" said he. \"Let's put the poor fellow under ground.\"\n\n\"It would be hard to do that,\" I said; \"we'll have to bury him in the\nsnow.\"\n\nAt this Agnew went off for a little distance and clambered over the\nrocks. He was not gone long. When he returned he said, \"I've found\nsome crumbled pumice-stone; we can scoop a grave for him there.\"\n\nWe then raised the body and carried it to the place which Agnew had\nfound. So emaciated was the poor dead sailor that his remains were no\nheavier than a small boy. On reaching the spot, we found the crumbled\npumice-stone. We placed the body in a crevice among the lava rocks,\nand then I said what I could remember of the burial-service. After\nthis we carried in our hands the crumbled pumice-stone until we had\ncovered the body, and thus gave the poor fellow a Christian burial.\n\nWe then returned to the shore.\n\n\"More, old fellow,\" said Agnew, \"I feel the better for this; the\nservice has done me good.\"\n\n\"And me too,\" said I. \"It has reminded me of what I had forgotten.\nThis world is only a part of life. We may lose it and yet live on.\nThere is another world; and if we can only keep that in our minds we\nsha'n't be so ready to sink into despair--that is, I sha'n't. Despair\nis my weakness; you are more hopeful.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Agnew, solemnly; \"but my hope thus far has referred only\nto the safety of my skin. After this I shall try to think of my soul,\nand cultivate, not the hope of escape, but the hope full of\nimmortality. Yes, More, after all we shall live, if not in England,\nthen, let us hope, in heaven.\"\n\nThere was a long silence after this--that kind of silence which one\nmay preserve who is at the point of death.\n\n\"I wonder how he got here?\" said Agnew, at last. \"The letter mentions\na whaler. No doubt the ship has been driven too far south; it has\nfoundered; he has escaped in a boat, either alone or with others; he\nhas been carried along this channel, and has landed here, afraid to go\nany farther.\"\n\n\"But his boat, what has become of that?\"\n\n\"His boat! That must have gone long ago. The letter was written in\n1820. At any rate, let's look around.\"\n\nWe did so. After some search we found fragments of a rotted rope\nattached to a piece of rock.\n\n\"That,\" said Agnew, \"must have been fastened to the boat; and as for\nthe boat herself, she has long ago been swept away from this.\"\n\n\"What shall we do now?\" I said, after a long silence.\n\n\"There's only one thing,\" said Agnew. \"We must go on.\"\n\n\"Go on?\" I asked, in wonder.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said he, confidently. \"Will you stay here? No. Will you\ngo back? You can't. We must, therefore, go on. That is our only hope.\"\n\n\"Hope!\" I cried. \"Do you still talk of hope?\"\n\n\"Hope?\" said Agnew; \"of course. Why not? There are no limits to hope,\nare there? One can hope anything anywhere. It is better to die while\nstruggling like a man, full of hope and energy than to perish in\ninaction and despair. It is better to die in the storm and furious\nwaters than to waste away in this awful place. So come along. Let's\ndrift as before. Let's see where this channel will take us. It will\ncertainly take us somewhere. Such a stream as this must have some\noutlet.\"\n\n\"This stream,\" said I, \"will take us to death, and death only. The\ncurrent grows swifter every hour. I've heard some old yarn of a vast\nopening at each of the poles, or one of them, into which the waters of\nthe ocean pour. They fall into one, and some say they go through and\ncome out at the other.\"\n\nAgnew laughed.\n\n\"That,\" said he, \"is a madman's dream. In the first place, I don't\nbelieve that we are approaching the south, but the north. The warmth\nof the climate here shows that. Yes, we are drawing north. We shall\nsoon emerge into warm waters and bright skies. So come along, and let\nus lose no more time.\"\n\nI made no further objection. There was nothing else to be done, and\nat the very worst we could not be in greater danger while drifting on\nthan in remaining behind. Soon, therefore, we were again in the boat,\nand the current swept us on as before.\n\nThe channel now was about four miles wide. On either side arose\nthe lofty volcanoes vomiting forth flames and smoke with furious\nexplosions; vast stones were hurled up into the air from the craters;\nstreams of molten lava rolled down, and at intervals there fell great\nshowers of ashes. The shores on either side were precipitous and\nrugged beyond all description, looking like fiery lava streams which\nhad been arrested by the flood, and cooled into gloomy, overhanging\ncliffs. The lava rock was of a deep, dull slate-color, which at a\ndistance looked black; and the blackness which thus succeeded to\nthe whiteness of the snow behind us seemed like the funeral pall of\nnature. Through scenes like these we drifted on, and the volcanoes on\neither side of the channel towered on high with their fiery floods of\nlava, their incessant explosions, their fierce outbursts of flames,\nand overhead there rolled a dense black canopy of smoke--altogether\nforming a terrific approach to that unknown and awful pathway upon\nwhich we were going. So we passed this dread portal, and then there\nlay before us--what? Was it a land of life or a land of death? Who\ncould say?\n\nIt was evening when we passed through. Night came on, and the darkness\nwas illuminated by the fiery glow of the volcanic flames. Worn out\nwith fatigue, we fell asleep. So the night passed, and the current\nbore us on until, at length, the morning came. We awoke, and now, for\nthe first time in many days, we saw the face of the sun. The clouds\nhad at last broken, the sky was clear, and behind us the sun was\nshining. That sight told us all. It showed us where we were going.\n\nI pointed to the sun.\n\n\"Look there,\" said I. \"There is the sun in the northern sky--behind\nus. We have been drifting steadily toward the south.\"\n\nAt this Agnew was silent, and sat looking back for a long time. There\nwe could still see the glow of the volcanic fires, though they were\nnow many miles away; while the sun, but lately risen, was lying on a\ncourse closer to the horizon than we had ever seen it before.\n\n\"We are going south,\" said I--\"to the South Pole. This swift current\ncan have but one ending--there may be an opening at the South Pole, or\na whirlpool like the Maelstrom.\"\n\nAgnew looked around with a smile.\n\n\"All these notions,\" said he, \"are dreams, or theories, or guesses.\nThere is no evidence to prove them. Why trouble yourself about a\nguess? You and I can guess, and with better reason; for we have now,\nit seems, come farther south than any human being who has ever lived.\nDo not imagine that the surface of the earth is different at the poles\nfrom what it is anywhere else. If we get to the South Pole we shall\nsee there what we have always seen--the open view of land or water,\nand the boundary of the horizon. As for this current, it seems to me\nlike the Gulf Stream, and it evidently does an important work in the\nmovement of the ocean waters. It pours on through vast fields of ice\non its way to other oceans, where it will probably become united with\nnew currents. Theories about openings at the poles, or whirlpools,\nmust be given up. Since the Maelstrom has been found to be a fiction,\nno one need believe in any other whirlpool. For my own part, I now\nbelieve that this current will bear us on, due south, over the pole,\nand then still onward, until at last we shall find ourselves in the\nSouth Pacific Ocean. So cheer up--don't be downhearted; there's still\nhope. We have left the ice and snow behind, and already the air is\nwarmer. Cheer up; we may find our luck turn at any moment.\"\n\nTo this I had no reply to make. Agnew's confidence seemed to me to be\nassumed, and certainly did not alleviate my own deep gloom, nor was\nthe scene around calculated to rouse me in the slightest degree out of\nmy despair. The channel had now lessened to a width of not more than\ntwo miles; the shores on either side were precipitous cliffs, broken\nby occasional declivities, but all of solid rock, so dark as to be\nalmost black, and evidently of volcanic origin. At times there arose\nrugged eminences, scarred and riven, indescribably dismal and\nappalling. There was not only an utter absence of life here in these\nabhorrent regions, but an actual impossibility of life which was\nenough to make the stoutest heart quail. The rocks looked like iron.\nIt seemed a land of iron penetrated by this ocean stream which had\nmade for itself a channel, and now bore us onward to a destination\nwhich was beyond all conjecture.\n\nThrough such scenes we drifted all that day. Night came, and in the\nskies overhead there arose a brilliant display of the aurora\naustralis, while toward the north the volcanic fires glowed with\nintense lustre. That night we slept. On awakening we noticed a change\nin the scene. The shores, though still black and forbidding, were no\nlonger precipitous, but sloped down gradually to the water; the\nclimate was sensibly milder, and far away before us there arose a line\nof giant mountains, whose summits were covered with ice and snow that\ngleamed white and purple in the rays of the sun.\n\nSuddenly Agnew gave a cry, and pointed to the opposite shore.\n\n\"Look!\" he cried--\"do you see? They are men!\"\n\nI looked, and there I saw plainly some moving figures that were,\nbeyond a doubt, human beings.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTHE SIGHT OF HUMAN BEINGS\n\n\nThe sight of human beings, thus unexpectedly found, filled us with\nstrange feelings--feelings which I cannot explain. The country was\nstill iron-bound and dark and forbidding, and the stream ran on in a\nstrong current, deep, black as ink, and resistless as fate; the sky\nbehind was lighted up by the volcanic glare which still shone from\nafar; and in front the view was bounded by the icy heights of a\nmountain chain. Here was, indeed, a strange country for a human\nhabitation; and strange, indeed, were the human beings whom we saw.\n\n\"Shall we land?\" said Agnew.\n\n\"Oh no,\" said I. \"Don't be hasty. The elements are sometimes kinder\nthan men, and I feel safer here, even in this river of death, than\nashore with such creatures as those.\"\n\nAgnew made no reply. We watched the figures on the shore. We saw them\ncoming down, staring and gesticulating. We drew on nearer to them till\nwe were able to see them better. A nearer view did not improve them.\nThey were human beings, certainly, but of such an appalling aspect\nthat they could only be likened to animated mummies. They were small,\nthin, shrivelled, black, with long matted hair and hideous faces. They\nall had long spears, and wore about the waist short skirts that seemed\nto be made of the skin of some sea-fowl.\n\nWe could not imagine how these creatures lived, or where. There were\nno signs of vegetation of any kind--not a tree or a shrub. There were\nno animals; but there were great flocks of birds, some of which seemed\ndifferent from anything that we had ever seen before. The long spears\nwhich the natives carried might possibly be used for catching these,\nor for fishing purposes. This thought made them seem less formidable,\nsince they would thus be instruments of food rather than weapons of\nwar. Meanwhile we drifted on as before, and the natives watched us,\nrunning along the shore abreast of us, so as to keep up with the boat.\nThere seemed over a hundred of them. We could see no signs of any\nhabitations--no huts, however humble; but we concluded that their\nabodes were farther inland. As for the natives themselves, the longer\nwe looked at them the more abhorrent they grew. Even the wretched\naborigines of Van Dieman's Land, who have been classed lowest in the\nscale of humanity, were pleasing and congenial when compared with\nthese, and the land looked worse than Tierra del Fuego. It looked like\na land of iron, and its inhabitants like fiends.\n\nAgnew again proposed to land, but I refused.\n\n\"No,\" I said; \"I'd rather starve for a week, and live on hope. Let us\ndrift on. If we go on we may have hope if we choose, but if we land\nhere we shall lose even that. Can we hope for anything from such\nthings as these? Even if they prove friendly, can we live among them?\nTo stay here is worse than death; our only hope is to go on.\"\n\nAgnew made no reply, and we drifted on for two hours, still followed\nby the natives. They made no hostile demonstrations. They merely\nwatched us, apparently from motives of curiosity. All this time we\nwere drawing steadily nearer to the line of lofty mountains, which\nwith their icy crests rose before us like an inaccessible and\nimpassable barrier, apparently closing up all farther progress; nor\nwas there any indication of any pass or any opening, however narrow,\nthrough which the great stream might run. Nothing was there but one\nunbroken wall of iron cliffs and icy summits. At last we saw that the\nsloping shores grew steeper, until, about a mile or two before us,\nthey changed to towering cliffs that rose up on each side for about a\nthousand feet above the water; here the stream ran, and became lost to\nview as completely as though swallowed up by the earth.\n\n\"We can go no farther,\" said Agnew. \"See--this stream seems to make a\nplunge there into the mountains. There must be some deep canyon there\nwith cataracts. To go on is certain death. We must stop here, if only\nto deliberate. Say, shall we risk it among these natives? After all,\nthere is not, perhaps, any danger among them. They are little\ncreatures and seem harmless. They are certainly not very good-looking;\nbut then, you know, appearances often deceive, and the devil's not so\nblack as he's painted. What do you say?\"\n\n\"I suppose we can do nothing else,\" said I.\n\nIn fact, I could see that we had reached a crisis in our fate. To go\non seemed certain death. To stop was our only alternative; and as we\nwere armed we should not be altogether at the mercy of these\ncreatures. Having made this decision we acted upon it at once, for in\nsuch a current there was no time for delay; and so, seizing the oars,\nwe soon brought the boat ashore.\n\nAs we approached, the crowd of natives stood awaiting us, and looked\nmore repulsive than ever. We could see the emaciation of their bony\nframes; their toes and fingers were like birds' claws; their eyes were\nsmall and dull and weak, and sunken in cavernous hollows, from which\nthey looked at us like corpses--a horrible sight. They stood quietly,\nhowever, and without any hostile demonstration, holding their spears\ncarelessly resting upon the ground.\n\n\"I don't like the looks of them,\" said I. \"I think I had better fire a\ngun.\"\n\n\"Why?\" cried Agnew. \"For Heaven's sake, man, don't hurt any of them!\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" said I; \"I only mean to inspire a little wholesome respect.\"\n\nSaying this I fired in the air. The report rang out with long echoes,\nand as the smoke swept away it showed us all the natives on the\nground. They had seated themselves with their hands crossed on their\nlaps, and there they sat looking at us as before, but with no\nmanifestation of fear or even surprise. I had expected to see them\nrun, but there was nothing of the kind. This puzzled us. Still, there\nwas no time now for any further hesitation. The current was sweeping\nus toward the chasm between the cliffs, and we had to land without\ndelay. This we did, and as I had another barrel still loaded and a\npistol, I felt that with these arms and those of Agnew we should be\nable to defend ourselves. It was in this state of mind that we landed,\nand secured the boat by means of the grappling-iron.\n\nThe natives now all crowded around us, making many strange gestures,\nwhich we did not understand. Some of them bowed low, others prostrated\nthemselves; on the whole these seemed like marks of respect, and it\noccurred to me that they regarded us as superior beings of some sort.\nIt was evident that there was nothing like hostility in their minds.\nAt the same time, the closer survey which I now made of them filled me\nwith renewed horror; their meagre frames, small, watery, lack-lustre\neyes, hollow, cavernous sockets, sunken cheeks, protruding teeth,\nclaw-like fingers, and withered skins, all made them look more than\never like animated mummies, and I shrank from them involuntarily, as\none shrinks from contact with a corpse.\n\nAgnew, however, was very different, and it was evident that he felt no\nrepugnance whatever. He bowed and smiled at them, and shook hands with\nhalf a dozen of them in succession. The hand-shaking was a new thing\nto them, but they accepted it in a proper spirit, and renewed their\nbows and prostrations. After this they all offered us their lances.\nThis certainly seemed like an act of peace and good-will. I shook my\nhead and declined to touch them; but Agnew accepted one of them, and\noffered his rifle in return. The one to whom he offered it refused to\ntake it. He seemed immensely gratified because Agnew had taken his\nlance, and the others seemed disappointed at his refusal to take\ntheirs. But I felt my heart quake as I saw him offer his rifle, and\nstill more when he offered it to one or two others, and only regained\nmy composure as I perceived that his offer was refused by all.\n\nThey now made motions to us to follow, and we all set forth together.\n\n\"My dear More,\" said Agnew, cheerily, \"they're not a bad lot. They\nmean well. They can't help their looks. You're too suspicious and\nreserved. Let's make friends with them, and get them to help us. Do as\nI do.\"\n\nI tried to, but found it impossible, for my repugnance was immovable.\nIt was like the horror which one feels toward rats, cockroaches,\nearwigs, or serpents. It was something that defied reason. These\ncreatures seemed like human vermin.\n\nWe marched inland for about half a mile, crossed a ridge, and came to\na valley, or rather a kind of hollow, at the other side of which we\nfound a cave with a smouldering fire in front. The fire was made of\ncoal, which must exist here somewhere. It was highly bituminous, and\nburned with a great blaze.\n\nThe day was now drawing to a close; far away I could see the lurid\nglow of the volcanoes, which grew brighter as the day declined: above,\nthe skies twinkled with innumerable stars, and the air was filled with\nthe moan of rushing waters.\n\nWe entered the cave. As we did so the natives heaped coal upon the\nfire, and the flames arose, lighting up the interior. We found here a\nnumber of women and children, who looked at us without either fear or\ncuriosity. The children looked like little dwarfs; the women were\nhags, hideous beyond description. One old woman in particular, who\nseemed to be in authority, was actually terrible in her awful and\nrepulsive ugliness. A nightmare dream never furnished forth a more\nfrightful object. This nightmare hag prostrated herself before each of\nus with such an air of self-immolation that she looked as though she\nwished us to kill her at once. The rough cave, the red light of the\nfire, all made the scene more awful; and a wild thought came to me\nthat we had actually reached, while yet living, the infernal world,\nand that this was the abode of devils. Yet their actions, it must be\nconfessed, were far from devilish. Everyone seemed eager to serve us.\nSome spread out couches formed of the skins of birds for us to sit on;\nothers attended to the fire; others offered us gifts of large and\nbeautiful feathers, together with numerous trinkets of rare and\ncurious workmanship. This kind attention on their part was a great\npuzzle to me, and I could not help suspecting that beneath all this\nthere must be some sinister design. Resolving to be prepared for the\nworst, I quietly reloaded the empty barrel of my rifle and watched\nwith the utmost vigilance. As for Agnew, he took it all in the most\nunsuspicious manner. He made signs to them, shook hands with them,\naccepted their gifts, and even tried to do the agreeable to the\nformidable hags and the child-fiends around him. He soon attracted the\nchief attention, and while all looked admiringly upon him, I was left\nto languish in comparative neglect.\n\nAt length a savory odor came through the cave, and a repast was spread\nbefore us. It consisted of some large fowl that looked like a goose,\nbut was twice as large as the largest turkey that I had ever seen. The\ntaste was like that of a wild-goose, but rather fishy. Still to us it\nseemed delicious, for our prolonged diet of raw seal had made us ready\nto welcome any other food whatever; and this fowl, whatever it was,\nwould not have been unwelcome to any hungry man. It was evident that\nthese people lived on the flesh of birds of various sorts. All around\nus we saw the skins of birds dried with the feathers on, and used for\nclothing, for mats, and for ornaments.\n\nThe repast being finished, we both felt greatly strengthened and\nrefreshed. Agnew continued to cultivate his new acquaintances, and\nseeing me holding back, he said,\n\n\"More, old fellow, these good people give me to understand that there\nis another place better than this, and want me to go with them. Will\nyou go?\"\n\nAt this a great fear seized me.\n\n\"Don't go!\" I cried--\"don't go! We are close by the boat here, and if\nanything happens we can easily get to it.\"\n\nAgnew laughed in my face.\n\n\"Why, you don't mean to tell me,\" said he, \"that you are still\nsuspicious, and after that dinner? Why, man, if they wanted to harm\nus, would they feast us in this style? Nonsense, man! Drop your\nsuspicions and come along.\"\n\nI shook my head obstinately.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"if I thought there was anything in your suspicions I\nwould stay by you; but I'm confident they mean nothing but kindness,\nso I'm going off to see the place.\"\n\n\"You'll be back again?\" said I.\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said he, \"of course I'll come back, and sleep here.\"\n\nWith these words he left, and nearly all the people accompanied him. I\nwas left behind with the women and children and about a dozen men.\nThese men busied themselves with some work over bird-skins; the women\nwere occupied with some other work over feathers. No one took any\nnotice of me. There did not seem to be any restraint upon me, nor was\nI watched in any way. Once the nightmare hag came and offered me a\nsmall roasted fowl, about the size of a woodcock. I declined it, but\nat the same time this delicate attention certainly surprised me.\n\nI was now beginning to struggle with some success against my feelings\nof abhorrence, when suddenly I caught sight of something which chased\naway every other thought, and made my blood turn cold in my veins. It\nwas something outside. At the mouth of the cave--by the fire which was\nstill blazing bright, and lighting up the scene--I saw four men who\nhad just come to the cave: they were carrying something which I at\nfirst supposed to be a sick or wounded companion. On reaching the fire\nthey put it down, and I saw, with a thrill of dismay, that their\nburden was neither sick nor wounded, but dead, for the corpse lay\nrigid as they had placed it. Then I saw the nightmare hag approach it\nwith a knife. An awful thought came to me--the crowning horror! The\nthought soon proved to be but too well founded. The nightmare hag\nbegan to cut, and in an instant had detached the arm of the corpse,\nwhich she thrust among the coals in the very place where lately she\nhad cooked the fowl. Then she went back for more.\n\nFor a moment my brain reeled, and I gasped for breath. Then I rose and\nstaggered out, I know not how. No one tried to stop me, nor did anyone\nfollow me; and, for my part, I was ready to blow out the brains of the\nfirst who dared to approach me. In this way I reached the open air,\nand passed by the hag and the four men as they were busy at their\nawful work. But at this point I was observed and followed. A number of\nmen and women came after me, jabbering their uncouth language and\ngesticulating. I warned them off, angrily. They persisted, and though\nnone of them were armed, yet I saw that they were unwilling to have me\nleave the cave, and I supposed that they would try to prevent me by\nforce.\n\nThe absence of Agnew made my position a difficult one. Had it not been\nfor this I would have burst through them and fled to the boat; but as\nlong as he was away I felt bound to wait; and though I longed to fly,\nI could not for his sake. The boat seemed to be a haven of rest. I\nlonged to be in her once more, and drift away, even if it should be to\nmy death. Nature was here less terrible than man; and it seemed better\nto drown in the waters, to perish amid rocks and whirlpools, than to\nlinger here amid such horrors as these. These people were not like\nhuman beings. The vilest and lowest savages that I had ever seen were\nnot so odious as these. A herd of monkeys would be far more congenial,\na flock of wolves less abhorrent. They had the caricature of the human\nform; they were the lowest of humanity; their speech was a mockery of\nlanguage; their faces devilish, their kindness a cunning pretence; and\nmost hideous of all was the nightmare hag that prepared the cannibal\nrepast.\n\nI could not begin hostilities, for I had to wait for Agnew; so I stood\nand looked, and then walked away for a little distance. They followed\nme closely, with eager words and gesticulations, though as yet no one\ntouched me or threatened me. Their tone seemed rather one of\npersuasion. After a few paces I stood still, with all of them around\nme. The horrible repast showed plainly all that was in store for us.\nThey received us kindly and fed us well only to devote us to the most\nabhorrent of deaths. Agnew, in his mad confidence, was only insuring\nhis own doom. He was putting himself completely in the power of\ndevils, who were incapable of pity and strangers to humanity. To make\nfriends with such fiends was impossible, and I felt sure that our only\nplan was to rule by terror--to seize, to slay, to conquer. But still I\nhad to wait for him, and did not dare to resort to violence while he\nwas absent; so I waited, while the savages gathered round me,\ncontenting themselves with guarding me, and neither touching me nor\nthreatening me. And all this time the hag went on, intent on her\npreparation of the horrible repast.\n\nWhile standing there looking, listening, waiting for Agnew, I noticed\nmany things. Far away the volcanoes blazed, and the northern sky was\nred with a lurid light. There, too, higher up, the moon was shining\noverhead, the sky was gleaming with stars; and all over the heavens\nthere shone the lustre of the aurora australis, brighter than any I\nhad ever seen--surpassing the moon and illuminating all. It lighted up\nthe haggard faces of the devils around me, and it again seemed to me\nas though I had died and gone to the land of woe--an iron land, a land\nof despair, with lurid fires all aglow and faces of fear.\n\nSuddenly, there burst upon my ears the report of a gun, which sounded\nlike a thunder-peal, and echoed in long reverberations. At once I\nunderstood it. My fears had proved true. These savages had enticed\nAgnew away to destroy him. In an instant I burst through the crowd\naround me, and ran wildly in the direction of that sound, calling his\nname, as I ran, at the top of my voice.\n\nI heard a loud cry; then another report. I hurried on, shouting his\nname in a kind of frenzy. The strange courage of these savages had\nalready impressed me deeply. They did not fear our guns. They were all\nattacking him, and he was alone, fighting for his life.\n\nThen there was another report; it was his pistol. I still ran on, and\nstill shouted to him.\n\nAt last I received an answer. He had perhaps heard me, and was\nanswering, or, at any rate, he was warning me.\n\n\"More,\" he cried, \"fly, fly, fly to the boat! Save yourself!\"\n\n\"Where are you?\" I cried, as I still rushed on.\n\n\"Fly, More, fly! Save yourself! You can't save me. I'm lost. Fly for\nyour life!\"\n\nJudging from his cries, he did not seem far away. I hurried on. I\ncould see nothing of him. All the time the savages followed me. None\nwere armed; but it seemed to me that they were preparing to fling\nthemselves upon me and overpower me with their numbers. They would\ncapture me alive, I thought, bind me, and carry me back, reserving me\nfor a future time!\n\nI turned and waved them back. They took no notice of my gesture. Then\nI ran on once more. They followed. They could not run so fast as I\ndid, and so I gained on them rapidly, still shouting to Agnew. But\nthere was no response. I ran backward and forward, crossing and\nrecrossing, doubling and turning, pursued all the time by the savages.\nAt last, in rage and despair, I fired upon them, and one of them fell.\nBut, to my dismay, the others did not seem to care one whit; they did\nnot stop for one moment, but pursued as before.\n\nMy situation was now plain in all its truth. They had enticed Agnew\naway; they had attacked him. He had fought, and had been overpowered.\nHe had tried to give me warning. His last words had been for me to\nfly--to fly: yes, for he well knew that it was better far for me to go\nto death through the raging torrent than to meet the fate which had\nfallen upon himself. For him there was now no more hope. That he was\nlost was plain. If he were still alive he would call to me; but his\nvoice had been silenced for some time. All was over, and that noble\nheart that had withstood so bravely and cheerily the rigors of the\nstorm, and the horrors of our desperate voyage, had been stilled in\ndeath by the vilest of miscreants.\n\nI paused for a moment. Even though Agnew was dead, I could not bear to\nleave him, but felt as though I ought to share his fate. The savages\ncame nearer. At their approach I hesitated no longer. That fate was\ntoo terrible: I must fly.\n\nBut before I fled I turned in fury to wreak vengeance upon them for\ntheir crimes. Full of rage and despair, I discharged my remaining\nrifle-barrel into the midst of the crowd. Then I fled toward the boat.\nOn the way I had a frightful thought that she might have been sent\nadrift; but, on approaching the place, I found her there just as I had\nleft her. The savages, with their usual fearlessness, still pursued.\nFor a moment I stood on the shore, with the grapple in my hand and the\nboat close by, and as they came near I discharged my pistol into the\nmidst of them. Then I sprang into the boat; the swift current bore me\naway, and in a few minutes the crowd of pursuing demons disappeared\nfrom view.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHE TORRENT SWEEPING UNDER THE MOUNTAINS\n\n\nThe boat drifted on. The light given by the aurora and the low moon\nseemed to grow fainter; and as I looked behind I saw that the distant\nglow from the volcanic fires had become more brilliant in the\nincreasing darkness. The sides of the channel grew steeper, until at\nlast they became rocky precipices, rising to an unknown height. The\nchannel itself grew narrower, till from a width of two miles it had\ncontracted to a tenth of those dimensions; but with this lessening\nwidth the waters seemed to rush far more swiftly. Here I drifted\nhelplessly, and saw the gloomy, rocky cliffs sweep past me as I was\nhurled onward on the breast of the tremendous flood. I was in despair.\nThe fate of Agnew had prepared me for my own, and I was only thankful\nthat my fate, since it was inevitable, would be less appalling. Death\nseemed certain, and my chief thought now was as to the moment when it\nwould come. I was prepared. I felt that I could meet it calmly,\nsternly, even thankfully; far better was a death here amid the roar of\nwaters than at the hands of those abhorrent beings by whose treachery\nmy friend had fallen.\n\nAs I went on, the precipices rose higher and seemed to overhang, the\nchannel grew narrower, the light grew fainter, until at last all\naround me grew dark. I was floating at the bottom of a vast chasm,\nwhere the sides seemed to rise precipitously for thousands of feet,\nwhere neither watery flood nor rocky wall was visible, and where, far\nabove, I could see the line of sky between the summits of the cliffs,\nand watch the glowing stars. And as I watched them there came to me\nthe thought that this was my last sight on earth, and I could only\nhope that the life which was so swiftly approaching its end might live\nagain somewhere among those glittering orbs. So I thought; and with\nthese thoughts I drifted on, I cannot tell how long, until at length\nthere appeared a vast black mass, where the open sky above me\nterminated, and where the lustre of the stars and the light of the\nheavens were all swallowed up in utter darkness.\n\nThis, then, I thought, is the end. Here, amid this darkness, I must\nmake the awful plunge and find my death I fell upon my knees in the\nbottom of the boat and prayed. As I knelt there the boat drew nearer,\nthe black mass grew blacker. The current swept me on. There were no\nbreakers; there was no phosphorescent sparkle of seething waters, and\nno whiteness of foam. I thought that I was on the brink of some\ntremendous cataract a thousand times deeper than Niagara; some fall\nwhere the waters plunged into the depths of the earth; and where,\ngathering for the terrific descent, all other movements--all dashings\nand writhings and twistings--were obliterated and lost in the one\noverwhelming onward rush. Suddenly all grew dark--dark beyond all\nexpression; the sky above was in a moment snatched from view; I had\nbeen flung into some tremendous cavern; and there, on my knees, with\nterror in my heart, I waited for death.\n\nThe moments passed, and death delayed to come. The awful plunge was\nstill put off; and though I remained on my knees and waited long,\nstill the end came not. The waters seemed still, the boat motionless.\nIt was borne upon the surface of a vast stream as smooth as glass; but\nwho could tell how deep that stream was, or how wide? At length I rose\nfrom my knees and sank down upon the seat of the boat, and tried to\npeer through the gloom. In vain. Nothing was visible. It was the very\nblackness of darkness. I listened, but heard nothing save a deep,\ndull, droning sound, which seemed to fill all the air and make it\nall tremulous with its vibrations. I tried to collect my thoughts. I\nrecalled that old theory which had been in my mind before this, and\nwhich I had mentioned to Agnew. This was the notion that at each pole\nthere is a vast opening; that into one of them all the waters of the\nocean pour themselves, and, after passing through the earth, come out\nat the other pole, to pass about its surface in innumerable streams.\nIt was a wild fancy, which I had laughed at under other circumstances,\nbut which now occurred to me once more, when I was overwhelmed\nwith despair, and my mind was weakened by the horrors which I had\nexperienced; and I had a vague fear that I had been drawn into the\nvery channel through which the ocean waters flowed in their course to\nthat terrific, that unparalleled abyss. Still, there was as yet no\nsign whatever of anything like a descent, for the boat was on even\nkeel, and perfectly level as before, and it was impossible for me to\ntell whether I was moving swiftly or slowly, or standing perfectly\nstill; for in that darkness there were no visible objects by which\nI could find out the rate of my progress; and as those who go up in\nballoons are utterly insensible of motion, so was I on those calm\nbut swift waters.\n\nAt length there came into view something which arrested my attention\nand engrossed all my thoughts. It was faint glow that at first caught\nmy gaze; and, on turning to see it better, I saw a round red spot\nglowing like fire. I had not seen this before. It looked like the moon\nwhen it rises from behind clouds, and glows red and lurid from the\nhorizon; and so this glowed, but not with the steady light of the\nmoon, for the light was fitful, and sometimes flashed into a baleful\nbrightness, which soon subsided into a dimmer lustre. New alarm arose\nwithin me, for this new sight suggested something more terrible than\nanything that I had thus far thought of. This, then, I thought, was to\nbe the end of my voyage; this was my goal--a pit of fire, into which I\nshould be hurled! Would it be well, I thought, to wait for such a\nfate, and experience such a death-agony? Would it not be better for me\nto take my own life before I should know the worst? I took my pistol\nand loaded it, so as to be prepared, but hesitated to use it until my\nfate should be more apparent. So I sat, holding my pistol, prepared to\nuse it, watching the light, and awaiting the time when the glowing\nfires should make all further hope impossible. But time passed, and\nthe light grew no brighter; on the contrary, it seemed to grow\nfainter. There was also another change. Instead of shining before me,\nit appeared more on my left. From this it went on changing its\nposition until at length it was astern. All the time it continued to\ngrow fainter, and it seemed certain that I was moving away from it\nrather than toward it. In the midst of this there occurred a new\nthought, which seemed to account for this light--this was, that it\narose from these same volcanoes which had illuminated the northern sky\nwhen I was ashore, and followed me still with their glare. I had been\ncarried into this darkness, through some vast opening which now lay\nbehind me, disclosing the red volcano glow, and this it was that\ncaused that roundness and resemblance to the moon. I saw that I was\nstill moving on away from that light as before, and that its changing\nposition was due to the turning of the boat as the water drifted it\nalong, now stern foremost, now sidewise, and again bow foremost. From\nthis it seemed plainly evident that the waters had borne me into some\nvast cavern of unknown extent, which went under the mountains--a\nsubterranean channel, whose issue I could not conjecture. Was this the\nbeginning of that course which should ultimately become a plunge deep\ndown into some unutterable abyss? or might I ever hope to emerge again\ninto the light of day--perhaps in some other ocean--some land of ice\nand frost and eternal night? But the old theory of the flow of water\nthrough the earth had taken hold of me and could not be shaken off. I\nknew some scientific men held the opinion that the earth's interior is\na mass of molten rock and pent-up fire, and that the earth itself had\nonce been a burning orb, which had cooled down at the surface; yet,\nafter all, this was only a theory, and there were other theories which\nwere totally different. As a boy I had read wild works of fiction\nabout lands in the interior of the earth, with a sun at the centre,\nwhich gave them the light of a perpetual day. These, I knew, were only\nthe creations of fiction; yet, after all, it seemed possible that the\nearth might contain vast hollow spaces in its interior--realms of\neternal darkness, caverns in comparison with which the hugest caves on\nthe surface were but the tiniest cells. I was now being borne on to\nthese. In that case there might be no sudden plunge, after all. The\nstream might run on for many thousand miles through this terrific\ncavern gloom, in accordance with natural laws; and I might thus live,\nand drift on in this darkness, until I should die a lingering death of\nhorror and despair.\n\nThere was no possible way of forming any estimate as to speed. All was\ndark, and even the glow behind was fading away; nor could I make any\nconjecture whatever as to the size of the channel. At the opening it\nhad been contracted and narrow; but here it might have expanded itself\nto miles, and its vaulted top might reach almost to the summit of\nthe lofty mountains. While sight thus failed me, sound was equally\nunavailing, for it was always the same--a sustained and unintermittent\nroar, a low, droning sound, deep and terrible, with no variations\nof dashing breakers or rushing rapids or falling cataracts. Vague\nthoughts of final escape came and went; but in such a situation hope\ncould not be sustained. The thick darkness oppressed the soul; and\nat length even the glow of the distant volcanoes, which had been\ngradually diminishing, grew dimmer and fainter, and finally faded out\naltogether. That seemed to me to be my last sight of earthly things.\nAfter this nothing was left. There was no longer for me such a thing\nas sight; there was nothing but darkness--perpetual and eternal night.\nI was buried in a cavern of rushing waters, to which there would be no\nend, where I should be borne onward helplessly by the resistless tide\nto a mysterious and an appalling doom.\n\nThe darkness grew so intolerable that I longed for something to dispel\nit, if only for a moment. I struck a match. The air was still, and the\nflame flashed out, lighting up the boat and showing the black water\naround me. This made me eager to see more. I loaded both barrels of\nthe rifle, keeping my pistol for another purpose, and then fired one\nof them. There was a tremendous report, that rang in my ears like a\nhundred thunder-volleys, and rolled and reverberated far along, and\ndied away in endless echoes. The flash lighted up the scene for an\ninstant, and for an instant only; like the sudden lightning, it\nrevealed all around. I saw a wide expanse of water, black as ink--a\nStygian pool; but no rocks were visible, and it seemed as though I\nhad been carried into a subterranean sea.\n\nI loaded the empty barrel and waited. The flash of light had revealed\nnothing, yet it had distracted my thoughts, and the work of reloading\nwas an additional distraction. Anything was better than inaction. I\ndid not wish to waste my ammunition, yet I thought that an occasional\nshot might serve some good purpose, if it was only to afford me some\nrelief from despair.\n\nAnd now, as I sat with the rifle in my hands, I was aware of a\nsound--new, exciting, different altogether from the murmur of\ninnumerable waters that filled my ears, and in sharp contrast with\nthe droning echoes of the rushing flood. It was a sound that spoke of\nlife. I heard quick, heavy pantings, as of some great living thing;\nand with this there came the noise of regular movements in the water,\nand the foaming and gurgling of waves. It was as though some living,\nbreathing creature were here, not far away, moving through these\nmidnight waters; and with this discovery there came a new fear--the\nfear of pursuit. I thought that some sea-monster had scented me in\nmy boat, and had started to attack me. This new fear aroused me to\naction. It was a danger quite unlike any other which I had ever known;\nyet the fear which it inspired was a feeling that roused me to action,\nand prompted me, even though the coming danger might be as sure as\ndeath, to rise against it and resist to the last. So I stood up with\nmy rifle and listened, with all my soul in my sense of hearing. The\nsounds arose more plainly. They had come nearer. They were immediately\nin front. I raised my rifle and took aim. Then in quick succession two\nreports thundered out with tremendous uproar and interminable echoes,\nbut the long reverberations were unheeded in the blaze of sudden light\nand the vision that was revealed. For there full before me I saw,\nthough but for an instant, a tremendous sight. It was a vast monster,\nmoving in the waters against the stream and toward the boat. Its head\nwas raised high, its eyes were inflamed with a baleful light, its\njaws, opened wide, bristled with sharp teeth, and it had a long neck\njoined to a body of enormous bulk, with a tail that lashed all the\nwater into foam. It was but for an instant that I saw it, and then\nwith a sudden plunge the monster dived, while at the same moment all\nwas as dark as before.\n\nFull of terror and excitement, I loaded my rifle again and waited,\nlistening for a renewal of the noise. I felt sure that the monster,\nbalked of his prey, would return with redoubled fury, and that I\nshould have to renew the conflict. I felt that the dangers of the\nsubterranean passage and of the rushing waters had passed away, and\nthat a new peril had arisen from the assault of this monster of the\ndeep. Nor was it this one alone that was to be dreaded. Where one was,\nothers were sure to be; and if this one should pass me by it would\nonly leave me to be assailed by monsters of the same kind, and these\nwould probably increase in number as I advanced farther into this\nrealm of darkness. And yet, in spite of these grisly thoughts, I\nfelt less of horror than before, for the fear which I had was now\nassociated with action; and as I stood waiting for the onset and\nlistening for the approach of the enemy, the excitement that ensued\nwas a positive relief from the dull despair into which I had sunk but\na moment before.\n\nYet, though I waited for a new attack, I waited in vain. The monster\ndid not come back. Either the flash and the noise had terrified him,\nor the bullets had hit him, or else in his vastness he had been\nindifferent to so feeble a creature as myself; but whatever may have\nbeen the cause, he did not emerge again out of the darkness and\nsilence into which he had sunk. For a long time I stood waiting; then\nI sat down, still watchful, still listening, but without any result,\nuntil at length I began to think that there was no chance of any new\nattack. Indeed, it seemed now as though there had been no attack at\nall, but that the monster had been swimming at random without any\nthought of me, in which case my rifle-flashes had terrified him more\nthan his fearful form had terrified me. On the whole this incident\nhad greatly benefited me. It had roused me from my despair. I grew\nreckless, and felt a disposition to acquiesce in whatever fate might\nhave in store for me.\n\nAnd now, worn out with fatigue and exhausted from long watchfulness\nand anxiety, I sank down in the bottom of the boat and fell into a\ndeep sleep.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE NEW WORLD\n\n\nHow long I slept I do not know. My sleep was profound, yet disturbed\nby troubled dreams, in which I lived over again all the eventful\nscenes of the past; and these were all intermingled in the wildest\nconfusion. The cannibals beckoned to us from the peak, and we landed\nbetween the two volcanoes. There the body of the dead sailor received\nus, and afterward chased us to the boat. Then came snow and volcanic\neruptions, and we drifted amid icebergs and molten lava until we\nentered an iron portal and plunged into darkness. Here there were vast\nswimming monsters and burning orbs of fire and thunderous cataracts\nfalling from inconceivable heights, and the sweep of immeasurable\ntides and the circling of infinite whirlpools; while in my ears there\nrang the never-ending roar of remorseless waters that came after us,\nwith all their waves and billows rolling upon us. It was a dream in\nwhich all the material terrors of the past were renewed; but these\nwere all as nothing when compared with a certain deep underlying\nfeeling that possessed my soul--a sense of loss irretrievable, an\nexpectation of impending doom, a drear and immitigable despair.\n\nIn the midst of this I awoke. It was with a sudden start, and I looked\nall around in speechless bewilderment. The first thing of which I\nwas conscious was a great blaze of light--light so lately lost, and\nsupposed to be lost forever, but now filling all the universe--bright,\nbrilliant, glowing bringing hope and joy and gladness, with all the\nsplendor of deep blue skies and the multitudinous laughter of ocean\nwaves that danced and sparkled in the sun. I flung up my arms and\nlaughed aloud. Then I burst into tears, and falling on my knees,\nI thanked the Almighty Ruler of the skies for this marvellous\ndeliverance.\n\nRising from my knees I looked around, and once more amazement\noverwhelmed me. I saw a long line of mountains towering up to\nimmeasurable heights, their summits covered with eternal ice and\nsnow. There the sun blazed low in the sky, elevated but a few degrees\nabove the mountain crests, which gleamed in gold and purple under its\nfiery rays. The sun seemed enlarged to unusual dimensions, and the\nmountains ran away on every side like the segment of some infinite\ncircle. At the base of the mountains lay a land all green with\nvegetation, where cultivated fields were visible, and vineyards and\norchards and groves, together with forests of palm and all manner\nof trees of every variety of hue, which ran up the sides of the\nmountains till they reached the limits of vegetation and the regions\nof snow and ice.\n\nHere in all directions there were unmistakable signs of human\nlife--the outlines of populous cities and busy towns and hamlets;\nroads winding far away along the plain or up the mountain-sides, and\nmighty works of industry in the shape of massive structures, terraced\nslopes, long rows of arches, ponderous pyramids, and battlemented\nwalls.\n\nFrom the land I turned to the sea. I saw before me an expanse of water\nintensely blue--an extent so vast that never before in all my ocean\nvoyages had anything appeared at all comparable with it. Out at sea,\nwherever I had been, the water had always limited the view; the\nhorizon had never seemed far away; ships soon sank below it, and the\nvisible surface of the earth was thus always contracted; but here, to\nmy bewilderment, the horizon appeared to be removed to an immeasurable\ndistance and raised high in the air, while the waters were prolonged\nendlessly. Starting from where I was, they went away to inconceivable\ndistances, and the view before me seemed like a watery declivity\nreaching for a thousand miles, till it approached the horizon far up\nin the sky. Nor was it any delusion of the senses that caused this\nunparalleled spectacle. I was familiar with the phenomena of the\nmirage, and knew well that there was nothing of that kind here; for\nthe mirage always shows great surfaces of stillness, or a regular\nvibration--glassy tides and indistinct distances; but here everything\nwas sharply defined in the clear atmosphere: the sky overhung a deep\nblue vault; the waves danced and sparkled in the sun; the waters\nrolled and foamed on every side; and the fresh breeze, as it blew over\nthe ocean, brought with it such exhilarating influences that it acted\nupon me like some reviving cordial.\n\nFrom the works of nature I turned to those of man. These were visible\neverywhere: on the land, in cities and cultivated fields and mighty\nconstructions; on the sea, in floating craft, which appeared wherever\nI turned my eyes--boats like those of fishermen, ships long and low,\nsome like galleys, propelled by a hundred oars, others provided with\none huge square-sail, which enabled them to run before the wind.\nThey were unlike any ships which I had ever seen; for neither in the\nMediterranean nor in Chinese waters were there any craft like these,\nand they reminded me rather of those ancient galleys which I had seen\nin pictures.\n\nI was lost in wonder as to where I was, and what land this could be to\nwhich I had been brought. I had not plunged into the interior of the\nearth, but I had been carried under the mountains, and had emerged\nagain into the glad light of the sun. Could it be possible, I thought,\nthat Agnew's hope had been realized, and that I had been carried into\nthe warm regions of the South Pacific Ocean? Yet in the South Pacific\nthere could be no place like this--no immeasurable expanse of waters,\nno horizon raised mountain high. It seemed like a vast basin-shaped\nworld, for all around me the surface appeared to rise, and I was in\nwhat looked like a depression; yet I knew that the basin and the\ndepression were an illusion, and that this appearance was due to\nthe immense extent of level surface with the environment of lofty\nmountains. I had crossed the antarctic circle; I had been borne onward\nfor an immense distance. Over all the known surface of the earth no\none had ever seen anything like this; there were but two places\nwhere such an immeasurable plain was possible, and those were at\nthe flattened poles. Where I was I now knew well. I had reached the\nantarctic pole. Here the earth was flat--an immense level with no\nroundness to lessen the reach of the horizon but an almost even\nsurface that gave an unimpeded view for hundreds of miles.\n\nThe subterranean channel had rushed through the mountains and had\ncarried me here. Here came all the waters of the Northern ocean\npouring into this vast polar sea, perhaps to issue forth from it by\nsome similar passage. Here, then, was the South Pole--a world by\nitself: and how different from that terrible, that iron land on the\nother side of the mountains!--not a world of ice and frost, but one\nof beauty and light, with a climate that was almost tropical in its\nwarmth, and lands that were covered with the rank luxuriance of a\nteeming vegetable life. I had passed from that outer world to this\ninner one, and the passage was from death unto life, from agony and\ndespair to sunlight and splendor and joy. Above all, in all around me\nthat which most impressed me now was the rich and superabundant life,\nand a warmth of air which made me think of India. It was an amazing\nand an unaccountable thing, and I could only attribute it to the\nflattening of the poles, which brought the surface nearer to the\nsupposed central fires of the earth, and therefore created a heat\nas great as that of the equatorial regions. Here I found a tropical\nclimate--a land warmed not by the sun, but from the earth itself. Or\nanother cause might be found in the warm ocean currents. Whatever the\ntrue one might be, I was utterly unable to form a conjecture.\n\nBut I had no time for such speculations as these. After the first\nemotions of wonder and admiration had somewhat subsided, I began to\nexperience other sensations. I began to remember that I had eaten\nnothing for a length of time that I had no means of calculating, and\nto look around to see if there was any way of satisfying my hunger.\nThe question arose now, What was to be done? After my recent terrible\nexperience I naturally shrank from again committing myself to the\ntender mercies of strange tribes; yet further thought and examination\nshowed me that the people of this strange land must be very different\nfrom those frightful savages on the other side of the mountains.\nEverywhere I beheld the manifest signs of cultivation and\ncivilization. Still, I knew that even civilized people would not\nnecessarily be any kinder than savages, and that I might be seized\nand flung into hopeless imprisonment or slavery.\n\nSo I hesitated, yet what could I do? My hunger was beginning to be\ninsupportable. I had reached a place where I had to choose between\nstarvation on the one hand, or a venture among these people on the\nother. To go back was impossible. Who could breast those waters in the\ntremendous subterranean channel, or force his way back through such\nappalling dangers? Or, if that were possible, who could ever hope to\nbreast those mighty currents beyond, or work his way amid everlasting\nice and immeasurable seas? No; return was impossible. I had been\nflung into this world of wonders, and here would be my home for the\nremainder of my days; though I could not now imagine whether those\ndays would be passed in peace or in bitter slavery and sorrow. Yet the\ndecision must be made and the risk must be run. It must be so. I must\nland here, venture among these people, and trust in that Providence\nwhich had hitherto sustained me.\n\nHaving thus resolved at all hazards to try my fate, I rowed in toward\nthe shore. Thus far I had seen galleys passing and small boats, but\nthey had taken no notice of me, for the reason that they were too far\naway to perceive anything about me that differed from any other boat;\nbut now, as I rowed, I noticed a galley coming down toward me. She\nseemed to be going in toward the shore at the very point at which I\nwas aiming, and her course and mine must soon meet if I continued to\nrow. After some hesitation I concluded to make signals to her, so as\nto attract attention; for, now that I had resolved to venture among\nthe people here, I was anxious to end my suspense as soon as possible.\nSo I continued rowing, and gradually drew nearer. The galley was\npropelled by oars, of which there were fifty on either side. The stem\nwas raised, and covered in like a cabin. At length I ceased rowing,\nand sat watching her. I soon saw that I was noticed, but this did\nnot occur till the galley was close by me--so close, indeed, that I\nthought they would pass without perceiving me. I raised my hands,\nwaved them, and gave a cry. The galley at once stopped, a boat was\nlowered, and some men descended and rowed toward me.\n\nThey were men of strange appearance--very small in stature and slender\nin frame. Their hair was black and straight, their features were quite\nregular, and their general expression was one of great gentleness. I\nwas surprised to notice that they kept their eyes almost closed, as\nthough they were weak and troubled by the glare of the sun. With their\nhalf-closed eyes they blinked at me, and then one who appeared to be\ntheir chief spoke to me. I understood not a word; and then I answered\nhim in English, which, of course, was equally unintelligible to him.\nI then made signs, pointing to the mountains and endeavoring to make\nknown to him that I had come from beyond them--that I had suffered\nshipwreck, that I had drifted here, and that I needed assistance. Of\nall this it was quite evident that they understood nothing except the\nfact that I needed help. The moment that they comprehended this they\ntook me in tow and rowed back to the galley.\n\nI found the galley to be about one hundred and fifty feet in length.\nFor about two thirds of this length forward it was open and filled\nwith seats, where there were about a hundred rowers, who all looked\nlike those that I had first seen, all being of small stature,\nslender frames, and, moreover, all being apparently distressed by\nthe sunlight. There was in all of them the same mild and gentle\nexpression. In complexion and general outline of features they were\nnot unlike Arabs, but they were entirely destitute of that hardness\nand austerity which the latter have. They all had beards, which were\ndressed in a peculiar way in plaits. Their costume varied. The rowers\nwore a coarse tunic, with a girdle of rope. The officers wore tunics\nof fine cloth and very elegant mantles, richly embroidered, and with\nborders of down. They all wore broad-brimmed hats, and the one who\nseemed to be chief had on his some golden ornaments.\n\nHere once more I tried to explain to them who I was. They looked at\nme, examining me all over, inspecting my gun, pistol, coat, trousers,\nboots, and hat, and talking all the time among themselves. They did\nnot touch me, but merely showed the natural curiosity which is felt at\nthe sight of a foreigner who has appeared unexpectedly. There was a\nscrupulous delicacy and a careful and even ceremonious politeness in\ntheir attitude toward me which was at once amazing and delightful. All\nfear and anxiety had now left me; in the gentle manners and amiable\nfaces of these people I saw enough to assure me of kind treatment;\nand in my deep joy and gratitude for this even my hunger was for a\ntime forgotten.\n\nAt length the chief motioned to me to follow him. He led the way to\nthe cabin, where, opening the door, he entered, and I followed, after\nwhich the others came in also and then the door was shut. At first I\ncould see nothing. There were no windows whatever, and only one or two\nslight crevices through which the light came. After a time my eyes\ngrew more accustomed to the darkness, and I could see that the cabin\nwas a spacious compartment, adorned with rich hangings of some unknown\nmaterial. There was a large table and seats. Taking me by the hand,\nthe chief led me to this, where I seated myself, while the others\nremained standing. Then some of them went away, and soon returned with\nfood and drink. The food was of different kinds--some tasting like\ngoose, others like turkey, others like partridge. It was all the flesh\nof fowls, though, judging from the slices before me, they must have\nbeen of great size. I wondered much at the behavior of the officers\nof the ship, who all, and the chief himself more than all, stood and\nwaited upon me; but it was a new world, and I supposed that this must\nbe the fashion; so I made no objections, but accepted the situation\nand ate with a thankful heart.\n\nAs the first keenness of my appetite was satisfied I had more leisure\nto make observations. I noticed that the eyes of my new friends no\nlonger blinked; they were wide open; and, so far as I could make\nthem out, their faces were much improved. Weakness of eyes seemed\ncommon among these people, and therefore the officers had their cabin\ndarkened, while the unfortunate rowers had to labor in the blazing\nsun. Such was my conclusion, and the fact reminded me of the miserable\nfellahin of Egypt, who have ophthalmia from the blazing sun and\nburning sand.\n\nAfter the repast they brought me water in a basin, and all stood\naround me. One held the basin, another a towel, another a flask,\nanother took a sponge and proceeded to wash my face and hands.\nThis was all strange to me, yet there was nothing left for me but\nsubmission. Then the chief, who had stood looking on with a smile on\nhis face took off his rich furred mantle and handed it to me. I was\nhalf inclined to refuse it, but was afraid of giving offence, so I\naccepted it, and he himself fastened it around my shoulders. The\nothers seemed actually to envy the chief, as though he had gained some\nuncommon good-fortune. Then they offered me various drinks, of which\nI tasted several kinds. Some were sweet waters of different flavors,\nothers tasted like mild wine, one was a fermented drink, light, sweet,\nand very agreeable to the palate. I now wished to show my generous\nentertainers that I was grateful; so I raised my cup, bowed to all\nof them, particularly the chief, and drank their health. They all\nwatched this ceremony with very sober faces, and I could not quite\nmake out whether they took my meaning or not. They certainly did not\nlook pleased, and it seemed to me as though they felt hurt at any\nexpression of gratitude, so I concluded for the future to abstain\nfrom all such demonstrations.\n\nYet with every moment the manners of these people grew more\nbewildering. It was strange, indeed, for me to find myself so suddenly\nthe centre of interest and of generous intentions. For a moment the\nthought occurred to me that they regarded me as some wonderful being\nwith superior powers, and were trying to propitiate me by these\nservices; yet I soon saw that these services were not at all acts\nof propitiation; they looked rather like those loving and profuse\nattentions which a family showers down upon some dear one long absent\nand at last returned, and with this my wonder grew greater than ever.\n\nThe galley had long since resumed her progress. I heard the steady\nbeat of the oars as they all moved in time, and at length the motion\nceased. The chief then signed to me and went out. I followed, and the\nrest came after. And now as I emerged from the gloom of the cabin, I\nfound myself once more in the glorious light of day, and saw that we\nhad reached the land. The galley was hauled up alongside a stone quay,\nand on the shore there were buildings and walls and trees and people.\nThe chief went ashore at once and I accompanied him. We walked for\nsome distance along a road with stone walls on either side, from\nbehind which there arose trees that from a distance had looked like\npalms. I now found them to be giant ferns, arching overhead with their\nbroad fanlike leaves and branches in dense masses, making the roadway\nquite dark in the shadow. Astonished as I was at the sight of these\ntrees, I soon forgot them in a still more astonishing sight, for after\ngoing onward about a hundred paces I stopped, and found myself in a\nwide space where four cross-roads met. Here there were three birds of\ngigantic stature. They had vast bodies, short legs, short necks, and\nseemed as large as an ordinary-sized ox. Their wings were short, and\nevidently could not be used for flight; their beaks were like that of\na sea-gull; each one had a man on his back, and was harnessed to a\ncar. The chief motioned to me to enter one of these cars. I did so. He\nfollowed, and thereupon the driver started the bird, which set forth\nwith long, rapid strides, at a pace fast as that of a trotting horse.\nSo astonished was I that for some time I did not notice anything else;\nbut at length, when my first feeling had subsided, I began to regard\nother objects. All the way the dense fern foliage arched overhead,\nthrowing down deep shadows. They grew on either side in dense rows,\nbut between their stalks I could see the country beyond, which lay\nall bright in the sunlight.\n\nHere were broad fields, all green with verdure; farther away arose\nclumps of tree-ferns; at every step of the way new vistas opened; amid\nthe verdure and the foliage were the roofs of structures that looked\nlike pavilions, and more massive edifices with pyramidal roofs. Our\nroad constantly ascended, and at length we came to a crossing. This\nwas a wide terrace at the slope of the mountain; on the lower side was\na row of massive stone edifices with pyramidal roofs, while on the\nupper there were portals which seemed to open into excavated caverns.\nHere, too, on either side arose the giant ferns, overarching and\ndarkening the terrace with their deep shadow. From this point I looked\nback, and through the trunks of the tree-ferns I could see fields\nand pavilions and the pyramidal roofs of massive edifices, and\nbroad, verdant slopes, while in the distance there were peeps of the\nboundless sea. We continued on our way without stopping, and passed\nseveral successive terraces like the first, with the same caverns on\nthe upper side and massive edifices on the lower, until at last the\nascent ended at the fifth terrace, and here we turned to the left.\nNow the view became more varied. The tree-ferns arose on either side,\narching overhead; on my right were the portals that opened into\ncaverns, on my left solid and massive houses, built of great blocks of\nstone, with pyramidal roofs. As far as I could judge, I was in a city\nbuilt on the slope of a mountain, with its streets formed thus of\nsuccessive terraces and their connecting cross-ways, one half its\nhabitations consisting of caverns, while the other half were pavilions\nand massive stone structures. Few people, however, were to be seen.\nOccasionally I saw one or two groping along with their eyes half\nshut, seeking the darkest shadows; and it seemed to me that this\nextraordinary race of men had some natural and universal peculiarity\nof eyesight which made them shun the sunlight, and seek the darkness\nof caves and of dense, overshadowing foliage.\n\nAt length we came to a place where the terrace ran back till it formed\na semicircle against the mountain slope, when several vast portals\nappeared. Here there was a large space, where the tree-ferns grew in\nlong lines crossing each other, and making a denser shade than usual.\nOn the lower side were several stone edifices of immense size; and\nin the middle of the place there arose a singular structure, shaped\nlike a half pyramid, with three sides sloping, and the fourth\nperpendicular, flat on the top, which was approached by a flight of\nsteps. We now went on until we reached the central portal of the range\nof caverns, and here we stopped. The chief got out and beckoned to me.\nI followed. He then led the way into the cavern, while I, full of\nwonder, walked behind him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nSCIENTIFIC THEORIES AND SCEPTICISM\n\n\nThus far Melick had been reading the manuscript, but at this point he\nwas interrupted by the announcement that dinner was ready. Upon this\nhe stopped abruptly; for on board the Falcon dinner was the great\nevent of the day, and in its presence even the manuscript had to be\nlaid aside. Before long they were all seated around the dining-table\nin the sumptuous cabin, prepared to discuss the repast which had been\nserved up by the genius of the French chef whom Lord Featherstone\nhad brought with him.\n\nLet us pause here for a moment to take a minuter survey of these four\nfriends. In the first place, there was Lord Featherstone himself,\nyoung, handsome, languid, good-natured to a fault, with plenty of\nmuscle if he chose to exert it, and plenty of brain if he chose to\nmake use of it--a man who had become weary of the monotony of high\nlife, and, like many of his order, was fond of seeking relief from the\nennui of prosperity amid the excitements of the sea. Next to him was\nDr. Congreve, a middle-aged man, with iron-gray hair, short beard and\nmustache, short nose, gray eyes, with spectacles, and stoutish body.\nNext came Noel Oxenden, late of Trinity College, Cambridge, a college\nfriend of Featherstone's--a tall man, with a refined and intellectual\nface and reserved manner. Finally, there was Otto Melick, a\nlitterateur from London, about thirty years of age, with a wiry and\nmuscular frame, and the restless manner of one who lives in a\nperpetual fidget.\n\nFor some time nothing was said; they partook of the repast in silence;\nbut at length it became evident that they were thinking of the\nmysterious manuscript. Featherstone was the first to speak.\n\n\"A deuced queer sort of thing this, too,\" said he, \"this manuscript.\nI can't quite make it out. Who ever dreamed of people living at the\nSouth Pole--and in a warm climate, too? Then it seems deuced odd, too,\nthat we should pick up this copper cylinder with the manuscript. I\nhardly know what to think about it.\"\n\nMelick smiled. \"Why, it isn't much to see through,\" said he.\n\n\"See through what?\" said the doctor, hastily, pricking up his ears\nat this, and peering keenly at Melick through his spectacles.\n\n\"Why, the manuscript, of course.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the doctor, \"what is it that you see? What do you make\nout of it?\"\n\n\"Why, anyone can see,\" said Melick, \"that it's a transparent hoax,\nthat's all. You don't mean to say, I hope, that you really regard it\nin any other light?\"\n\n\"A transparent hoax!\" repeated the doctor. \"Will you please state why\nyou regard it in that light?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Melick. \"Some fellow wanted to get up a sensation\nnovel and introduce it to the world with a great flourish of trumpets,\nand so he has taken this way of going about it. You see, he has\ncounted on its being picked up, and perhaps published. After this he\nwould come forward and own the authorship.\"\n\n\"And what good would that do?\" asked the doctor, mildly. \"He couldn't\nprove the authorship, and he couldn't get the copyright.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course not; but he would gain notoriety, and that would give\nhim a great sale for his next effort.\"\n\nThe doctor smiled. \"See here, Melick,\" said he, \"you've a very vivid\nimagination, my dear fellow; but come, let us discuss this for a\nlittle while in a common-sense way. Now how long should you suppose\nthat this manuscript has been afloat?\"\n\n\"Oh, a few months or so,\" said Melick.\n\n\"A few months!\" said the doctor. \"A few years you mean. Why, man,\nthere are successive layers of barnacles on that copper cylinder which\nshow a submersion of at least three years, perhaps more.\"\n\n\"By Jove! yes,\" remarked Featherstone. \"Your sensation novelist must\nhave been a lunatic if he chose that way of publishing a book.\"\n\n\"Then, again,\" continued the doctor, \"how did it get here?\"\n\n\"Oh, easily enough,\" answered Melick. \"The ocean currents brought it.\"\n\n\"The ocean currents!\" repeated the doctor. \"That's a very vague\nexpression. What do you mean? Of course it has been brought here by\nthe ocean currents.\"\n\n\"Why, if it were thrown off the coast of England it would be carried\naway, in the ordinary course of things, and might make the tour of the\nworld.\"\n\n\"The ocean currents,\" said the doctor, \"have undoubtedly brought this\nto us. Of that I shall have more to say presently--but just now, in\nreference to your notion of a sensation novelist, and an English\norigin, let me ask your opinion of the material on which it is\nwritten. Did you ever see anything like it before? Is it paper?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Melick; \"it is evidently some vegetable substance. No doubt\nthe writer has had it prepared for this very purpose, so as to make it\nlook natural.\"\n\n\"Do you know what is is?\" asked the doctor.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then I'll tell you; it's papyrus.\"\n\n\"Papyrus?\"\n\n\"Yes, actual papyrus. You can find but little of that in existence at\nthe present day. It is only to be found here and there in museums.\nI know it perfectly well, however, and saw what it was at the first\nglance. Now, I hold that a sensation novelist would never have thought\nof papyrus. If he didn't wish to use paper, he could have found a\ndozen other things. I don't see how he could have found anyone able to\nprepare such a substance as this for writing. It must have come from a\ncountry where it is actually in use. Now, mark you, the papyrus-plant\nmay still be found growing wild on the banks of the upper Nile, and\nalso in Sicily, and it is made use of for ropes and other things of\nthat sort. But as to making writing material out of it, that is hardly\npossible for the art is lost. The ancient process was very elaborate\nand this manuscript is written on leaves which resembled in a\nmarvellous manner those of the Egyptian papyrus books. There are two\nrolls at Marseilles which I have seen and examined, and they are\nidentical with this. Now these papyrus leaves indicate much mechanical\nskill, and have a professional look. They seem like the work of an\nexperienced manufacturer.\"\n\n\"I don't see,\" said Melick, obstinately, \"why one shouldn't get\npapyrus now and have it made up into writing material.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's out of the question,\" said the doctor. \"How could it\never enter into anyone's head? How could your mere sensation-monger\nprocure the raw material? That of itself would be a work of immense\ndifficulty. How could he get it made up? That would be impossible.\nBut, apart from this, just consider the strong internal evidence that\nthere is as to the authenticity of the manuscript. Now, in the first\nplace, there is the description of Desolation Island, which is\nperfectly accurate. But it is on his narrative beyond this that I lay\nchief stress. I can prove that the statements here are corroborated\nby those of Captain Ross in his account of that great voyage from\nwhich he returned not very long ago.\"\n\nThe doctor, who had been talking with much enthusiasm, paused here to\ntake breath, and then went on:\n\n\"I happen to know all about that voyage, for I read a full report of\nit just before we started, and you can see for yourselves whether this\nmanuscript is credible or not.\n\n\"Captain James Clarke Ross was sent forth on his expedition in 1839.\nOn January 1, 1841, he passed the antarctic circle in 178 degrees east\nlongitude. On the 11th he discovered land in 70 degrees 41' south\nlatitude, 172 degrees 36' east longitude. He found that the land was\na continuous coast, trending southward, and rising to peaks of ten\nthousand feet in height, all covered with ice and snow. On the 12th\nhe landed and took possession in the name of the Queen. After this he\ncontinued his course as far as 78 degrees 4' south latitude, tracing a\ncoast-line of six hundred miles. Observe, now how all this coincides\nwith More's narrative. Well, I now come to the crowning statement. In\n77 degrees 32' south latitude, 167 degrees east longitude, he came in\nsight of two enormous volcanoes over twelve thousand feet in height.\nOne of these was in an active state of eruption. To this he gave the\nname of Mount Erebus. The other was quiet; it was of somewhat less\nheight, and he gave it the name of Mount Terror. Mark, now, how\nwonderfully this resembles More's account. Well, just here his\nprogress was arrested by a barrier which presented a perpendicular\nwall of over a hundred and fifty feet in height, along which he\ncoasted for some distance. On the following year he penetrated six\nmiles farther south, namely, 78 degrees 11' south latitude, 161\ndegrees 27' west longitude. At this point he was again stopped by the\nimpassable cliffs, which arose here like an eternal barrier, while\nbeyond them he saw a long line of lofty mountains covered with ice\nand snow.\"\n\n\"Did you hear the result of the American expedition?\" asked Melick.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the doctor. \"Wilkes pretends to have found a continent,\nbut his account of it makes it quite evident to my mind that he saw\nnothing but ice. I believe that Wilkes's antarctic continent will some\nday be penetrated by ships, which will sail for hundreds of miles\nfarther south. All that is wanted is a favorable season. But mark the\ncoincidence between Ross's report and More's manuscript. This must\nhave been written at least three years ago, and the writer could not\nhave known anything about Ross's discoveries. Above all, he could not\nhave thought of those two volcanoes unless he had seen them.\"\n\n\"But these volcanoes mentioned by More are not the Erebus and Terror,\nare they?\" said Lord Featherstone.\n\n\"Of course not; they are on the other side of the world.\"\n\n\"The whole story,\" said Melick, \"may have been written by one of\nRoss's men and thrown overboard. If I'd been on that expedition I\nshould probably have written it to beguile the time.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said the doctor; \"and you would also have manufactured the\npapyrus and the copper cylinder on board to beguile the time.\"\n\n\"I dare say the writer picked up that papyrus and the copper cylinder\nin China or Japan, and made use of it in this way.\"\n\n\"Where do you make out the position of More's volcanoes?\" asked\nFeatherstone.\n\n\"It is difficult to make it out accurately,\" said the doctor. \"More\ngives no data. In fact he had none to give. He couldn't take any\nobservations.\"\n\n\"The fact is,\" said Melick, \"it's not a sailor's yarn at all. No\nsailor would ever express himself in that way. That's what struck me\nfrom the first. It has the ring of a confounded sensation-monger all\nthrough.\"\n\nThe doctor elevated his eyebrows, but took no notice of this.\n\n\"You see,\" he continued, addressing himself to the others, \"Desolation\nIsland is in 50 degrees south latitude and 70 degrees east longitude.\nAs I make out, More's course led him over about ten degrees of\nlongitude in a southwest course. That course depended altogether upon\nthe ocean currents. Now there is a great antarctic drift-current,\nwhich flows round the Cape of Good Hope and divides there, one half\nflowing past the east coast of Africa and the other setting across\nthe Indian Ocean. Then it unites with a current which flows round the\nsouth of Van Dieman's Land, which also divides, and the southernmost\ncurrent is supposed to cross the Pacific until it strikes Cape Horn,\naround which it flows, dividing as before. Now my theory is, that\nsouth of Desolation Island--I don't know how far--there is a great\ncurrent setting toward the South Pole, and running southwest through\ndegrees of longitude 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, east of Greenwich; and\nfinally sweeping on, it would reach More's volcanoes at a point which\nI should judge to be about 80 degrees south latitude and 10 degrees\nwest longitude. There it passes between the volcanoes and bursts\nthrough the vast mountain barrier by a subterranean way, which has\nbeen formed for it in past ages by some primeval convulsion of nature.\nAfter this it probably sweeps around the great South Polar ocean, and\nemerges at the opposite side, not far from the volcanoes Erebus and\nTerror.\"\n\nHere the doctor paused, and looked around with some self-complacency.\n\n\"Oh,\" said Melick, \"if you take that tone, you have us all at your\nmercy. I know no more about the geography of the antarctic circle than\nI do of the moon. I simply criticize from a literary point of view,\nand I don't like his underground cavern with the stream running\nthrough it. It sounds like one of the voyages of Sinbad the Sailor.\nNor do I like his description; he evidently is writing for effect.\nBesides, his style is vicious; it is too stilted. Finally, he has\nrecourse to the stale device of a sea-serpent.\"\n\n\"A sea-serpent!\" repeated the doctor. \"Well, for my part I feel by\nno means inclined to sneer at a sea-serpent. Its existence cannot\nbe proved, yet it cannot be pooh-poohed. Every schoolboy knows that\nthe waters of the sea were once filled with monsters more tremendous\nthan the greatest sea-serpent that has ever been imagined. The\nplesiosaurus, with its snakelike head, if it existed now, would be\ncalled a sea-serpent. Some of these so-called fossil animals may have\ntheir representatives still living in the remoter parts of the world.\nThink of the recently discovered ornithorhynchus of Australia!\"\n\n\"If you please, I'd really much rather not,\" said Melick with a\ngesture of despair. \"I haven't the honor of the gentleman's\nacquaintance.\"\n\n\"Well, what do you think of his notice of the sun, and the long light,\nand his low position on the horizon?\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right,\" said Melick. \"Anyone who chose to get up this\nthing would of course read up about the polar day, and all that.\nEveryone knows that at the poles there is a six-months' day, followed\nby a six-months' night.\"\n\n\"You are a determined sceptic,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"How is it about the polar day?\" asked Featherstone.\n\n\"Well,\" said the doctor, \"at the poles themselves there is one day\nof six months, during which the sun never sets, and one night of six\nmonths, during which he never rises. In the spaces between the polar\ncircles the quantities of the continuous day and continuous night vary\nin accordance with the distance from the pole. At the north point of\nNova Zembla, 75 degrees north latitude, there is uninterrupted light\nfrom May 1st to August 12th, and uninterrupted darkness from November\n8th to February 9th. At the arctic circle at the summer solstice the\nday is twenty-four hours long. At the antarctic circle at the same\ntime the night is twenty-four hours long.\"\n\nUpon this Melick filled the doctor's wine-glass with a great deal of\nceremony.\n\n\"After all those statistics,\" he said, \"you must feel rather dry. You\nshould take a drink before venturing any further.\"\n\nThe doctor made no reply, but raised the glass to his lips and\nswallowed the wine in an abstracted way.\n\n\"The thing that struck me most,\" said Oxenden, \"in all that has been\nread thus far, is the flatness of the South Pole, and the peculiar\neffect which this produces on the landscape.\"\n\n\"I must say,\" added Melick, \"that the writer has got hold of a very\ngood idea there, and has taken care to put it forward in a very\nprominent fashion.\"\n\n\"What is the difference,\" asked Oxenden, \"between the two diameters of\nthe earth, the polar and the equatorial? Is it known?\"\n\n\"By Jove!\" said Featherstone, \"that's the very question I was going to\nask. I've always heard that the earth is flattened at the poles, but\nnever knew how much. Is there any way by which people can find out?\"\n\nThe doctor drew a long breath, and beamed upon the company with a\nbenevolent smile.\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said he; \"I can answer that question, if you care to know\nand won't feel bored.\"\n\n\"Answer it, then, my dear fellow, by all means,\" said Featherstone,\nin his most languid tone.\n\n\"There are two ways,\" said the doctor, \"by which the polar compression\nof the earth has been found out. One is by the measurement of arcs\non the earth's surface; the other is by experiments with pendulums\nor weights with regard to the earth's gravity at different places.\nThe former of these methods is, perhaps, the more satisfactory.\nMeasurements of arcs have been made on a very extensive scale in\ndifferent parts of the world--in England, France, Lapland, Peru, and\nIndia. Mr. Ivory, who devoted himself for years to an exhaustive\nexamination of the subject, has deduced that the equatorial radius of\nthe earth is over 3962 miles, and the polar radius over 3949 miles.\nThis makes the depression at either pole upward of thirteen miles. A\ndepression of over thirteen miles, as you must plainly see, should\nproduce strange results in the scenery at the poles. Of course, if\nthere are mountains, no difference would be noticed between this and\nany other part of the earth's surface; but if there is water, why,\nwe ought to expect some such state of things as More describes. The\ngravitation test has also been tried, with very nearly the same\nresult. The surface of the earth at the equator, being farthest from\nthe centre of gravity, indicates the least weight in bodies; but at\nthe poles, where the surface is nearest the centre of gravity, there\nmust be the greatest weight. It is found, in fact, that the weight\nof bodies increases in passing from the equator to the poles. By\nexperiments made in this way the polar compression is ascertained to\nbe the same as I have mentioned.\"\n\n\"What effect would this have on the climate at the poles?\" asked\nOxenden.\n\n\"That's a complicated question,\" said the doctor. \"In answer to that\nwe must leave ascertained facts and trust to theories, unless, indeed,\nwe accept as valid the statements of this remarkable manuscript.\nFor my own part, I see no reason why it should not be as More says.\nRemember, this polar world is thirteen miles nearer to the centre of\nthe earth. Whether this should affect the climate or not, depends upon\nthe nature of the earth's interior. That interior, according to the\npopular theory of the present day is a mass of fire. This theory\naffirms that the earth was once a red-hot mass, which has cooled down;\nbut the cooling process has only taken place on the surface, leaving\nthe interior still a molten mass of matter in a state of intense heat\nand combustion. At the poles the surface is thus thirteen miles nearer\nto these tremendous fires. Of course it may be supposed that the\nearth's crust is of about equal thickness on all parts; yet still,\neven if this be so, thirteen miles ought to make some difference. Now\nat the North Pole there seem to be causes at work to counterbalance\nthe effect of the internal heat, chiefly in the enormous accumulation\nof polar ice which probably hems it in on every side; and though many\nbelieve in an open polar sea of warm water at the North Pole, yet\nstill the effect of vast ice-masses and of cold submarine currents\nmust be to render the climate severe. But at the South Pole it is\ndifferent. The observations of Ross and of More show us that there is\na chain of mountains of immense height, which seem to encircle the\npole. If this be so, and I see no reason to disbelieve it, then the\nice of the outer seas must be kept away altogether from that strange\ninner sea of which More speaks. Ross saw the volcanoes Erebus and\nTerror; More saw two others. How many more there may be it is\nimpossible to say; but all this shows that the effect of the earth's\ninternal fires is very manifest in that region, and More has\npenetrated to a secluded world, which lies apart by itself, free from\nthe influence of ice-masses, left to feel the effect of the internal\nfires, and possessing what is virtually a tropical climate.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Melick, \"there is no theory however wild and fantastic,\nwhich some man of science will not be ready to support and to fortify\nby endless arguments, all of the most plausible kind. For my own part,\nI still believe More and his south polar world to be no more authentic\nthan Sindbad the Sailor.\"\n\nBut the others evidently sympathized with the doctor's view, and\nregarded Melick as carrying his scepticism to an absurd excess.\n\n\"How large do you suppose this south polar ocean to be?\" asked\nFeatherstone.\n\n\"It is impossible to answer that question exactly,\" said the doctor.\n\"It may be, as More hints, a thousand miles in extent, or only five\nhundred, or two hundred. For my own part, however, I feel like\ntaking More's statements at their utmost value; and the idea that\nI have gathered from his narrative is that of a vast sea like the\nMediterranean, surrounded by impassable mountains, by great and\nfertile countries, peopled with an immense variety of animals, with\na fauna and flora quite unlike those of the rest of the world;\nand, above all, with great nations possessing a rare and unique\ncivilization, and belonging to a race altogether different from\nany of the known races of men.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Melick, \"that at least is the idea which the writer of\nthe manuscript tries to convey.\"\n\nBy this time they had finished dinner.\n\n\"And now,\" said Featherstone, \"let's have some more of the manuscript.\nMelick is tired of it, I dare say. I would relieve him, but I'm an\ninfernally bad reader. Doctor, what do you say? Will you read the next\ninstalment!\"\n\n\"With all my heart,\" said the doctor, briskly.\n\n\"Very well, then,\" said Featherstone; \"we will all be your attentive\nhearers.\"\n\nAnd now the doctor took up the manuscript and began to read.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE CAVE-DWELLERS\n\n\nThe cavern into which the chief led me was very spacious, but had\nno light except that which entered through the portal. It was with\ndifficulty that I could see anything, but I found that there were many\npeople here moving about, all as intent upon their own pursuits as\nthose which one encounters in the streets of our cities. As we went\non farther the darkness increased, until at last I lost sight of the\nchief altogether, and he had to come back and lead me. After going\na little farther we came to a long, broad passage-way like a\nsubterranean street, about twenty feet in width, and as many in\nheight. Here there were discernible a few twinkling lamps, which\nserved to make the darkness less intense and enabled me to see the\nshadowy figures around. These were numerous, and all seemed busy,\nthough what their occupation might be I could not guess. I was amazed\nat the extent of these caverns, and at the multitude of the people. I\nsaw also that from the nature of their eyes the sunlight distressed\nthem, and in this cavern gloom they found their most congenial\ndwelling-place. From what I had thus far seen, this extraordinary\npeople shrank from the sunlight; and when they had to move abroad they\npassed over roads which were darkened as much as possible by the deep\nshadows of mighty ferns, while for the most part they remained in\ndark caverns, in which they lived and moved and had their being. It\nwas a puzzle to me whether the weakness of their eyes had caused\nthis dislike of light, or the habit of cave-dwelling had caused this\nweakness of eyes. Here, in this darkness, where there was but a faint\ntwinkle from the feeble lamps, their eyes seemed to serve them as well\nas mine did in the outer light of day; and the chief, who outside had\nmoved with an uncertain step, and had blinked painfully at objects\nwith his eyes almost closed, now appeared to be in his proper element;\nand while I hesitated like a blind man and groped along with a\nfaltering step, he guided me, and seemed to see everything with\nperfect vision.\n\nAt length we stopped, and the chief raised up a thick, heavy mat which\nhung like an unwieldly curtain in front of a doorway. This the chief\nlifted. At once a blaze of light burst forth, gleaming into the dark,\nand appearing to blind him. His eyes closed. He held up the veil for\nme to pass through. I did so. He followed, and then groped his way\nslowly along, while I accompanied and assisted him.\n\nI now found myself in a large grotto with an arched roof, from which\nwas suspended an enormous lamp, either golden or gilded. All around\nwere numerous lamps. The walls were adorned with rich hangings;\ncouches were here, with soft cushions, and divans and ottomans; soft\nmats were on the floor, and everything gave indications of luxury and\nwealth. Other doors, covered with overhanging mats, seemed to lead out\nof this grotto. To one of these the chief walked, and raising the mat\nhe led the way into another grotto like the last, with the same bright\nlights and the same adornments, but of smaller size. Here I saw\nsomeone who at once took up all my attention.\n\nIt was a young maiden. Her face and form, but especially her eyes,\nshowed her to be of quite a different race from these others. To me\nshe was of medium height, yet she was taller than any of the people\nhere that I had hitherto seen. Her complexion was much lighter; her\nhair was dark, luxuriant, and wavy, and arranged in a coiffure secured\nwith a golden band. Her features were of a different cast from those\nof the people here, for they were regular in outline and of exquisite\nbeauty; her nose was straight; she had a short upper lip, arched\neyebrows finely pencilled, thin lips, and well-rounded chin. But the\nchief contrast was in her eyes. These were large, dark, liquid, with\nlong lashes, and with a splendid glow in their lustrous depths. She\nstood looking at me with her face full of amazement; and as I caught\nthe gaze of her glorious eyes I rejoiced that I had at last found one\nwho lived in the light and loved it--one who did not blink like a bat,\nbut looked me full in the face, and allowed me to see all her soul\nrevealed. The chief, who still was pained by the glare of light, kept\nhis eyes covered, and said a few hasty words to the maiden. After this\nhe hurried away, leaving me there.\n\nThe maiden stood for a moment looking at me. As the chief spoke to\nher a change came over her face. She looked at me in silence, with\nan expression of sad and mournful interest, which seemed to increase\nevery moment. At length she approached and said something in the same\nstrange language which the chief had used. I shook my head and replied\nin English, whereupon she shook her head with a look of perplexity.\nThen, anxious to conciliate her, I held out my hand. She looked at\nit in some surprise. Upon this I took her hand, and pressed it to my\nlips, feeling, however, somewhat doubtful as to the way in which she\nmight receive such an advance. To my great delight she accepted it in\na friendly spirit, and seemed to consider it my foreign fashion of\nshowing friendship and respect. She smiled and nodded, and pointed to\nmy gun, which thus far I had carried in my hand. I smiled and laid\nit down. Then she pointed to a seat. I sat down, and then she seated\nherself close by me, and we looked at each other in mutual wonder and\nmutual inquiry.\n\nI was full of amazement at thus meeting with so exquisite a being,\nand lost myself in conjectures as to her race, her office, and her\nposition here. Who was she, or what? She was unlike the others, and\nreminded me of those Oriental beauties whose portraits I had seen in\nannuals and illustrated books. Her costume was in keeping with such\na character. She wore a long tunic that reached from the neck to the\nground, secured at the waist with a golden girdle; the sleeves were\nlong and loose; over this she had a long mantle; on her feet were\nlight slippers, white and glistening. All about her, in her room and\nin her costume, spoke of light and splendor and luxury. To these\nothers who shrank so from the light she could not be related in any\nway. The respect with which she was treated by the chief, the peculiar\nsplendor of her apartments, seemed to indicate some high rank. Was\nshe, then, the queen of the land? Was she a princess? I could not\ntell. At any rate, whatever she was, she seemed anxious to show me\nthe utmost attention. Her manner was full of dignity and sweet\ngraciousness, and she appeared particularly anxious to make herself\nunderstood. At first she spoke in a language that sounded like that of\nthe chief, and was full of gutturals and broad vowels; afterward she\nspoke in another that was far more euphonious. I, on the other hand\nspoke in English and in French; but of course I was as unintelligible\nto her as she was to me.\n\nLanguage was, therefore, of no use. It was necessary to go back to\nfirst principles and make use of signs, or try to gain the most\nelementary words of her language; so first of all I pointed to her,\nand tried to indicate that I wanted to know her name. She caught my\nmeaning at once, and, pointing to herself, she looked fixedly at me\nand said, \"Almah, Almah!\"\n\nI repeated these words after her, saying, \"Almah, Almah!\" She smiled\nand nodded, and then pointed to me with a look of inquiry that plainly\nasked for my name. I said \"Adam More.\" She repeated this, and it\nsounded like \"A-tam-or.\" But as she spoke this slowly her smile died\naway. She looked anxious and troubled, and once more that expression\nof wondering sadness came over her face. She repeated my name over and\nover in this way with a mournful intonation that thrilled through me,\nand excited forebodings of evil. \"Atamor, Atamor!\" And always after\nthat she called me \"Atamor.\"\n\nBut now she sat for some time, looking at me with a face full of pity\nand distress. At this I was greatly astonished; for but a moment\nbefore she had been full of smiles, and it was as though something in\nmy name had excited sorrowful thoughts. Yet how could that be, since\nshe could never by any possibility have heard my name before? The\nbeautiful Almah seemed to be not altogether happy, or why should she\nbe so quick to sadness? There was a mystery about all this which was\nquite unaccountable.\n\nIt was a singular situation, and one which excited within me feelings\nof unutterable delight. This light and splendor, this warmth and\npeace--what a contrast it offered to the scenes through which I had\nbut lately passed! Those scenes of horror, of ice and snow, of storm\nand tempest, of cold and hunger, of riven cliff and furious ocean\nstream, and, above all, that crowning agony in the bleak iron-land of\nthe cannibals--from all these I had escaped. I had been drawn down\nunder the earth to experience the terrors of that unspeakable passage,\nand had at last emerged to light and life, to joy and hope. In this\ngrotto I had found the culmination of all happiness. It was like a\nfairy realm; and here was one whose very look was enough to inspire\nthe most despairing soul with hope and peace and happiness. The only\nthing that was now left to trouble me was this mournful face of Almah.\nWhy did she look at me with such sad interest and such melancholy\nmeaning? Did she know of any evil fate in store for me? Yet how could\nthere be any evil fate to be feared from people who had received me\nwith such unparalleled generosity? No, it could not be; so I resolved\nto try to bring back again the smile that had faded out of her face.\n\nI pointed to her, and said, \"Almah.\"\n\nShe said, \"Atam-or.\"\n\nAnd the smile did not come back, but the sadness remained in her face.\n\nMy eager desire now was to learn her language, and I resolved at once\nto acquire as many words and phrases as possible. I began by asking\nthe names of things, such as \"seat,\" \"table,\" \"mat,\" \"coat,\" \"hat,\"\n\"shoe,\" \"lamp,\" \"floor,\" \"wall,\" and all the common objects around.\nShe gave all the names, and soon became so deeply interested that her\nsadness departed, and the smile came back once more. For my own part,\nI was always rather quick at learning languages. I had a correct ear\nand a retentive memory; in my wanderings round the world I had picked\nup a smattering of many languages, such as French, Italian, Spanish,\nArabic, German, Hindoostanee, and a few others. The words which I\nlearned from Almah had a remote resemblance to Arabic; and, in fact,\nmy knowledge of Arabic was actually of some assistance, though how it\nwas that these people should have a language with that resemblance\nwas certainly a mystery, and I did not try to solve it. The beautiful\nAlmah soon grew immensely interested in my efforts to learn, and also\nin the English words which I gave when I pointed to any object.\n\nThus I pointed to myself, and said \"Man,\" then pointing to her, I\nsaid, \"Woman.\" She laughed, and pointing to me said \"Iz,\" and pointing\nto herself said, \"Izza.\" Then I pointed to the row of lights, and\nsaid \"Light;\" she did the same, and said, \"Or.\" Then her face grew\nmournful, and she pointed to me, saying \"Atam-or.\" It struck me then\nthat there was some chance resemblance between \"or,\" the word meaning\n\"light,\" and one of the syllables of my name as she pronounced it, and\nthat this might cause her sadness; but as I could make out nothing of\nthis, I dismissed the thought, and went on with my questions. This\ntook up the time, until at length someone appeared who looked like a\nservant. He said something, whereupon Almah arose and beckoned to me\nto follow. I did so, and we went to a neighboring apartment, where\nthere was spread a bounteous repast. Here we sat and ate, and Almah\ntold me the names of all the dishes. After dinner we returned to the\nroom.\n\nIt was a singular and a delightful position. I was left alone with the\nbeautiful Almah, who herself showed the utmost graciousness and the\nkindest interest in me. I could not understand it, nor did I try to;\nit was enough that I had such a happy lot. For hours we thus were\ntogether, and I learned many words. To insure remembrance, I wrote\nthem down in my memorandum-book with a pencil and both of these were\nregarded by Almah with greatest curiosity. She felt the paper,\ninspected it, touched it with her tongue, and seemed to admire it\ngreatly; but the pencil excited still greater admiration. I signed to\nher to write in the book. She did so, but the characters were quite\nunlike anything that I had ever seen. They were not joined like our\nwriting and like Arabic letters, but were separate like our printed\ntype, and were formed in an irregular manner. She then showed me a\nbook made of a strange substance. It was filled with characters like\nthose which she had just written. The leaves were not at all like\npaper, but seemed like some vegetable product, such as the leaves of\na plant or the bark of a tree. They were very thin, very smooth, all\ncut into regular size, and fastened together by means of rings. This\nmanuscript is written upon the same material. I afterward found that\nit was universally used here, and was made of a reed that grows in\nmarshes.\n\nHere in these vast caverns there was no way by which I could tell the\nprogress of time, but Almah had her own way of finding out when the\nhours of wakeful life were over. She arose and said, \"Salonla.\" This I\nafterward found out to be common salutation of the country. I said it\nafter her. She then left me. Shortly afterward a servant appeared,\nwho took me to a room, which I understood to be mine. Here I found\neverything that I could wish, either for comfort or luxury; and as I\nfelt fatigue, I flung myself upon the soft bed of down, and soon was\nsound asleep.\n\nI slept for a long time. When I awoke I heard sounds in the distance,\nand knew that people were moving. Here in these caverns there was no\ndifference between day and night, but, by modes of which I was\nignorant, a regular succession was observed of waking times and\nsleeping times.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE CAVERN OF THE DEAD\n\n\nOn going forth into the outer grotto I saw the table spread with a\nsumptuous repast, and the apartment in a blaze of light. Almah was not\nhere; and though some servants made signs for me to eat, yet I could\nnot until I should see whether she was coming or not. I had to wait\nfor a long time, however; and while I was waiting the chief entered,\nshading his eyes with his hand from the painful light. He bowed\nlow with the most profound courtesy, saying, \"Salonla,\" to which I\nresponded in the same way. He seemed much pleased at this, and made a\nfew remarks, which I did not understand; whereupon, anxious to lose no\ntime in learning the language, I repeated to him all the words I knew,\nand asked after others. I pointed to him and asked his name. He said,\n\"Kohen.\" This, however, I afterward found was not a name, but a title.\nThe \"Kohen\" did not remain long, for the light was painful. After his\ndeparture I was alone for some time, and at length Almah made her\nappearance. I sprang to meet her, full of joy, and took her hand in\nboth of mine and pressed it warmly. She smiled, and appeared quite\nfree from the melancholy of the previous day.\n\nWe ate our breakfast together, after which we went out into the world\nof light, groping our way along through the dark passages amid the\nbusy crowd. Almah could see better than I in the darkness; but she was\nfar from seeing well, and did not move with that easy step and perfect\ncertainty which all the others showed. Like me, she was a child of\nlight, and the darkness was distressing to her. As we went on we were\nseen by all, but were apparently not considered prisoners. On the\ncontrary, all looked at us with the deepest respect, and bowed low\nor moved aside, and occasionally made little offerings of fruit or\nflowers to one or the other of us. It seemed to me that we were\ntreated with equal distinction; and if Almah was their queen, I, their\nguest, was regarded with equal honor. Whatever her rank might be,\nhowever, she was to all appearance the most absolute mistress of\nher own actions, and moved about among all these people with the\nindependence and dignity of some person of exalted rank.\n\nAt length we emerged into the open air. Here the contrast to the\ncavern gloom inside gave to the outer world unusual brightness and\nsplendor, so that even under the heavy overarching tree-ferns, which\nhad seemed so dark when I was here before, it now appeared light and\ncheerful. Almah turned to the right, and we walked along the terrace.\nBut few people were visible. They shrank from the light, and kept\nthemselves in the caverns. Then after a few steps we came to the base\nof a tall half-pyramid, the summit of which was above the tops of the\ntrees. I pointed to this, as though I wished to go up. Almah hesitated\nfor a moment, and seemed to shrink back, but at length, overcoming her\nreluctance, began the ascent. A flight of stony steps led up. On\nreaching the top, I found it about thirty feet long by fifteen wide,\nwith a high stone table in the middle. At that moment, however, I\nscarce noticed the pyramid summit, and I only describe it now because\nI was fated before long to see it with different feelings. What I then\nnoticed was the vast and wondrous display of all the glories of nature\nthat burst at once upon my view. There was that same boundless sea,\nrising up high toward the horizon, as I had seen it before, and\nsuggesting infinite extent. There were the blue waters breaking into\nfoam, the ships traversing the deep, the far-encircling shores green\nin vegetation, the high rampart of ice-bound mountains that shut in\nthe land, making it a world by itself. There was the sun, low on the\nhorizon, which it traversed on its long orbit, lighting up all these\nscenes till the six-months day should end and the six-months night\nbegin.\n\nFor a long time I stood feasting my eyes upon all this splendor, and\nat length turned to see whether Almah shared my feelings. One look was\nenough. She stood absorbed in the scene, as though she were drinking\nin deep draughts of all this matchless beauty. I felt amazed at this;\nI saw how different she seemed from the others, and could not account\nfor it. But as yet I knew too little of the language to question her,\nand could only hope for a future explanation when I had learned more.\n\nWe descended at length and walked about the terrace and up and down\nthe side streets. All were the same as I had noticed before--terraced\nstreets, with caverns on one side and massive stone structures on the\nother. I saw deep channels, which were used as drains to carry down\nmountain torrents. I did not see all at this first walk, but I\ninspected the whole city in many subsequent walks until its outlines\nwere all familiar. I found it about a mile long and about half a\nmile wide, constructed in a series of terraces, which rose one above\nanother in a hollow of the mountains round a harbor of the sea. On my\nwalks I met with but few people on the streets, and they all seemed\ntroubled with the light. I saw also occasionally some more of those\ngreat birds, the name of which I learned from Almah; it was \"opkuk.\"\n\nFor some time my life went on most delightfully. I found myself\nsurrounded with every comfort and luxury. Almah was my constant\nassociate, and all around regarded us with the profoundest respect.\nThe people were the mildest, most gentle, and most generous that I had\never seen. The Kohen seemed to pass most of his time in making new\ncontrivances for my happiness. This strange people, in their dealings\nwith me and with one another, seemed animated by a universal desire to\ndo kindly acts; and the only possible objection against them was their\nsingular love of darkness.\n\nMy freedom was absolute. No one watched me. Almah and I could go where\nwe chose. So far as I could perceive, we were quite at liberty, if we\nwished, to take a boat and escape over the sea. It seemed also quite\nlikely that if we had ordered out a galley and a gang of oarsmen, we\nshould have been supplied with all that we might want in the most\ncheerful manner. Such a thought, however, was absurd. Flight! Why\nshould I think of flying?\n\nI had long ago lost all idea of time; and here, where it was for the\npresent perpetual day, I was more at a loss than ever. I supposed that\nit was somewhere in the month of March, but whether at the beginning\nor the end I could not tell. The people had a regular system of\nwake-time and sleep-time, by which they ordered their lives; but\nwhether these respective times were longer or shorter than the days\nand nights at home I could not tell at that time, though I afterward\nlearned all about it. On the whole, I was perfectly content--nay,\nmore, perfectly happy; more so, indeed, than ever in my life, and\nquite willing to forget home and friends and everything in the society\nof Almah. While in her company there was always one purpose upon which\nI was most intent, and that was to master the language. I made rapid\nprogress, and while she was absent I sought out others, especially the\nKohen, with whom to practice. The Kohen was always most eager to aid\nme in every conceivable way or to any conceivable thing; and he had\nsuch a gentle manner and showed such generous qualities that I soon\nlearned to regard him with positive affection.\n\nAlmah was always absent for several hours after I rose in the morning,\nand when she made her appearance it was with the face and manner of\none who had returned from some unpleasant task. It always took some\ntime for her to regain that cheerfulness which she usually showed. I\nsoon felt a deep curiosity to learn the nature of her employment and\noffice here, and as my knowledge of the language increased I began\nto question her. My first attempts were vain. She looked at me with\nindescribable mournfulness and shook her head. This, however, only\nconfirmed me in my suspicions that her duties, whatever they might be,\nwere of a painful nature; so I urged her to tell me, and asked her as\nwell as I could if I might not share them or help her in some way. To\nall this, however, she only returned sighs and mournful looks for an\nanswer. It seemed to me, from her manner and from the general behavior\nof the people, that there was no express prohibition on my learning\nanything, doing anything, or going anywhere; and so, after this, I\nbesought her to let me accompany her some time. But this too she\nrefused. My requests were often made, and as I learned more and more\nof the language I was able to make them with more earnestness and\neffect, until at length I succeeded in overcoming her objections.\n\n\"It is for your own sake,\" said she, \"that I have refused, Atam-or. I\ndo not wish to lessen your happiness. But you must know all soon; and\nso, if you wish to come with me and see what I have to do, why, you\nmay come the next jom.\"\n\nThis meant the next day, jom being the division of time corresponding\nwith our day. At this promise I was so full of gratitude that I forgot\nall about the dark suggestiveness of her words. The next jom I arose\nsooner than usual and went forth. I found Almah waiting for me. She\nlooked troubled, and greeted me with a mournful smile.\n\n\"You will find pain in this,\" said she; \"but you wish it, and if you\nstill wish it, why, I will take you with me.\"\n\nAt this I only persisted the more, and so we set forth. We went\nthrough the cavern passages. Few people were there; all seemed asleep.\nThen we went out-of-doors and came into the full blaze of that day\nwhich here knew no night, but prolonged itself into months. For a\nwhile Almah stood looking forth between the trees to where the bright\nsunlight sparkled on the sea, and then with a sigh she turned to\nthe left. I followed. On coming to the next portal she went in. I\nfollowed, and found myself in a rough cavern, dark and forbidding.\nTraversing this we came to an inner doorway, closed with a heavy mat.\nThis she raised, and passed through, while I went in after her.\n\nI found myself in a vast cavern, full of dim, sparkling lights, which\nserved not to illuminate it, but merely to indicate its enormous\nextent. Far above rose the vaulted roof, to a height of apparently a\nhundred feet. Under this there was a lofty half-pyramid with stone\nsteps. All around, as far as I could see in the obscure light, there\nwere niches in the walls, each one containing a figure with a light\nburning at its feet. I took them for statues. Almah pointed in silence\nto one of these which was nearest, and I went up close so as to see\nit.\n\nThe first glance that I took made me recoil with horror. It was no\nstatue that I saw in that niche, but a shrivelled human form--a\nhideous sight. It was dark and dried; it was fixed in a sitting\nposture, with its hands resting on its knees, and its hollow eyes\nlooking forward. On its head was the mockery of a wreath of flowers,\nwhile from its heart there projected the handle and half of the blade\nof a knife which had been thrust there. What was the meaning of this\nknife? It seemed to tell of a violent death. Yet the flowers must\nsurely be a mark of honor. A violent death with honor, and the\nembalmed remains--these things suggested nothing else than the horrid\nthought of a human sacrifice. I looked away with eager and terrible\ncuriosity. I saw all the niches, hundreds upon hundreds, all filled\nwith these fearful occupants. I turned again with a sinking heart to\nAlmah. Her face was full of anguish.\n\n\"This is my duty,\" said she. \"Every jom I must come here and crown\nthese victims with fresh flowers.\"\n\nA feeling of sickening horror overwhelmed me. Almah had spoken these\nwords and stood looking at me with a face of woe. This, then, was that\ndaily task from which she was wont to return in such sadness--an\nabhorrent task to her, and one to which familiarity had never\nreconciled her. What was she doing here? What dark fate was it that\nthus bound this child of light to these children of darkness? or why\nwas she thus compelled to perform a service from which all her nature\nrevolted? I read in her face at this moment a horror equal to my own;\nand at the sight of her distress my own was lessened, and there arose\nwithin me a profound sympathy and a strong desire to do something to\nalleviate her misery.\n\n\"This is no place for you,\" continued Almah. \"Go, and I will soon join\nyou.\"\n\n\"No,\" said I, using her language after my own broken fashion--\"no, I\nwill not go--I will stay, I will help, if you will permit.\"\n\nShe looked at me earnestly, and seemed to see that my resolution was\nfirmly fixed, and that I was not to be dissuaded from it.\n\n\"Very well,\" said she; \"if you do stay and help me, it will be a great\nrelief.\"\n\nWith these simple words she proceeded to carry out her work. At the\nfoot of the pyramid there was a heap of wreaths made out of fresh\nflowers, and these were to be placed by her on the heads of the\nembalmed corpses.\n\n\"This work,\" said she, \"is considered here the highest and most\nhonorable that can be performed. It is given to me out of kindness,\nand they cannot understand that I can have any other feelings in the\nperformance than those of joy and exultation--here among the dead and\nin the dark.\"\n\nI said nothing, but followed and watched her, carrying the wreaths and\nsupplying her. She went to each niche in succession, and after taking\nthe wreath off each corpse she placed a fresh one on, saying a brief\nformula at each act. By keeping her supplied with wreaths I was able\nto lighten her task, so much so that, whereas it usually occupied her\nmore than two hours, on the present occasion it was finished in less\nthan half an hour. She informed me that those which she crowned were\nthe corpses of men who had been sacrificed during the present\nseason--by season meaning the six months of light; and that though\nmany more were here, yet they wore crowns of gold. At the end of ten\nyears they were removed to public sepulchres. The number of those\nwhich had to be crowned by her was about a hundred. Her work was only\nto crown them, the labor of collecting the flowers and weaving the\nwreaths and attending to the lamps being performed by others.\n\nI left this place with Almah, sad and depressed. She had not told me\nwhy these victims had been sacrificed, nor did I feel inclined to\nask. A dark suspicion had come to me that these people, underneath\nall their amiable ways, concealed thoughts, habits, and motives of\na frightful kind; and that beyond all my present brightness and\nhappiness there might be a fate awaiting me too horrible for thought.\nYet I did not wish to borrow trouble. What I had seen and heard was\nquite enough for one occasion. I was anxious, rather, to forget it\nall. Nor did Almah's words or manner in any way reassure me. She was\nsilent and sad and preoccupied. It was as though she knew the worst,\nand knowing it, dared not speak; as though there was something more\nhorrible which she dared not reveal. For my part, I feared it so that\nI dared not ask. It was enough for me just then to know that my mild\nand self-denying and generous entertainers were addicted to the\nabhorrent custom of human sacrifices.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTHE SACRED HUNT\n\n\nOn that very jom the Kohen informed me that they were about\nto set forth on the \"sacred hunt,\" an event which always occurred\ntoward the end of the season, and he kindly invited me to go. I,\neager to find any relief from the horrible thoughts that had taken\npossession of me, and full of longing for active exertion, at once\naccepted the invitation. I was delighted to hear Almah say that she\ntoo was going; and I learned at the same time that in this strange\nland the women were as fond of hunting as the men, and that on such\noccasions their presence was expected.\n\nThe sacred hunt was certainly a strange one. I saw that it was to\ntake place on the water; for a great crowd, numbering over a hundred,\nwent down to the harbor and embarked on board a galley, on which\nthere were a hundred others, who served as rowers. The hunters were\nall armed with long, light javelins and short swords. Some of these\nwere offered to me, for as yet no one supposed that my rifle and\npistol were instruments of destruction, or anything else than\nornaments. My refusal to accept their weapons created some surprise,\nbut with their usual civility they did not press their offers\nfurther. It was evident that this hunting expedition was only made in\nobedience to some hallowed custom; for the light of the sun pained\ntheir eyes, and all their movements were made with uncertainty and\nhesitation. With these a hunt by sunlight is the same as a hunt by\nnight would be with us. There was the same confusion and awkwardness.\n\nThe Kohen was in command. At his word the galley started, and the\nrowers pulled out to sea with long, regular strokes. I was anxious to\nknow what the expedition was aimed at, and what were the animals that\nwe expected to get; but I could not make out Almah's explanations.\nHer words suggested something of vague terror, vast proportions, and\nindescribable ferocity; but my ignorance of the language prevented me\nfrom learning anything more.\n\nWe went along the coast for a few miles, and then came to the mouth\nof a great river, which seemed to flow from among the mountains. The\ncurrent was exceedingly swift, and as I looked back it seemed to me\nthat it must be the very stream which had borne me here into this\nremote world. I afterward found out that this was so--that this\nstream emerges from among the mountains, flowing from an unknown\nsource. It was over this that I had been borne in my sleep, after\nI had emerged from the subterranean darkness, and it was by this\ncurrent that I had been carried into the open sea. As we crossed the\nestuary of this river I saw that the shores on either side were low,\nand covered with the rankest vegetation; giant trees of fern, vast\nreeds and grasses, all arose here in a dense growth impassable to\nman. Upon the shallow shores the surf was breaking; and here in\nthe tide I saw objects which I at first supposed to be rocks,\nbut afterward found out to be living things. They looked like\nalligators, but were far larger than the largest alligators known\nto us, besides being of far more terrific aspect. Toward these the\ngalley was directed, and I now saw with surprise that these were\nthe objects of the sacred hunt.\n\nSuddenly, as the galley was moving along at half-speed, there\narose out of the water a thing that looked like the folds of a giant\nhairy serpent, which, however, proved to be the long neck of an\nincredible monster, whose immense body soon afterward appeared above\nthe water. With huge fins he propelled himself toward us; and his\nhead, twenty feet in the air, was poised as though about to attack.\nThe head was like that of an alligator, the open jaws showed a\nfearful array of sharp teeth, the eyes were fiercely glowing, the\nlong neck was covered with a coarse, shaggy mane, while the top of\nthe body, which was out of the water, was incased in an impenetrable\ncuirass of bone. Such a monster as this seemed unassailable,\nespecially by men who had no missile weapons, and whose eyes were so\ndim and weak. I therefore expected that the galley would turn and\nfly from the attack, for the monster itself seemed as large as our\nvessel; but there was not the slightest thought of flight. On the\ncontrary, every man was on the alert; some sprang to the bow and\nstood there, awaiting the first shock; others, amidship, stood\nwaiting for the orders of the Kohen. Meanwhile the monster\napproached, and at length, with a sweep of his long neck, came down\nupon the dense crowd at the bows. A dozen frail lances were broken\nagainst his horny head, a half-dozen wretches were seized and\nterribly torn by those remorseless jaws. Still none fled. All rushed\nforward, and with lances, axes, knives, and ropes they sought to\ndestroy the enemy. Numbers of them strove to seize his long neck. In\nthe ardor of the fight the rowers dropped their oars and hurried to\nthe scene, to take part in the struggle. The slaughter was sickening,\nbut not a man quailed. Never had I dreamed of such blind and\ndesperate courage as was now displayed before my horror-stricken\neyes. Each sought to outdo the other. They had managed to throw ropes\naround the monster's neck, by which he was held close to the galley.\nHis fierce movements seemed likely to drag us all down under the\nwater; and his long neck, free from restraint, writhed and twisted\namong the struggling crowd of fighting men, in the midst of whom was\nthe Kohen, as desperate and as fearless as any.\n\nAll this had taken place in a very short space of time, and I had\nscarce been able to comprehend the full meaning of it all. As for\nAlmah, she stood pale and trembling, with a face of horror. At last\nit seemed to me that every man of them would be destroyed, and that\nthey were all throwing their lives away to no purpose whatever. Above\nall, my heart was wrung for the Kohen, who was there in the midst of\nhis people, lifting his frail and puny arm against the monster. I\ncould endure inaction no longer. I had brought my arms with me, as\nusual; and now, as the monster raised his head, I took aim at his\neye and fired. The report rang out in thunder. Almah gave a shriek,\nand amid the smoke I saw the long, snake-like neck of the monster\nsweeping about madly among the men. In the water his vast tail was\nlashing the surface of the sea, and churning it into foam. Here I\nonce more took aim immediately under the fore-fin, where there was\nno scaly covering. Once more I fired. This time it was with fatal\neffect; and after one or two convulsive movements the monster, with\na low, deep bellow, let his head fall and gasped out his life.\n\nI hurried forward. There lay the frightful head, with its long\nneck and shaggy mane, while all around was a hideous spectacle.\nThe destruction of life had been awful. Nineteen were dead, and\ntwenty-eight were wounded, writhing in every gradation of agony, some\nhorribly mangled. The rest stood staring at me in astonishment, not\nunderstanding those peals of thunder that had laid the monster low.\nThere was no terror or awe, however--nothing more than surprise;\nand the Kohen, whose clothes were torn into shreds and covered with\nblood, looked at me in bewilderment. I said to him, out of my small\nstock of words, that the wounded ought at once to be cared for. At\nthis he turned away and made some remarks to his men.\n\nI now stood ready to lend my own services, if needful. I expected\nto take a part in the tender attentions which were the due of these\ngallant souls, who had exhibited such matchless valor; these men who\nthought nothing of life, but flung it away at the command of their\nchief without dreaming of flight or of hesitation. Thus I stood\nlooking on in an expectant attitude, when there came a moment in\nwhich I was simply petrified with horror; for the Kohen drew his\nknife, stooped over the wounded man nearest him, and then stabbed him\nto the heart with a mortal wound. The others all proceeded to do the\nsame, and they did it in the coolest and most business-like manner,\nwithout any passion, without any feeling of any kind, and, indeed,\nwith a certain air of gratification, as though they were performing\nsome peculiarly high and sacred duty. The mildness and benevolence of\ntheir faces seemed actually heightened, and the perpetration of this\nunutterable atrocity seemed to affect these people in the same way in\nwhich the performance of acts of humanity might affect us.\n\nFor my own part, I stood for a few moments actually motionless from\nperplexity and horror; then, with a shriek, I rushed forward as if\nto prevent it; but I was too late. The unutterable deed was done,\nand the unfortunate wounded, without an exception, lay dead beside\ntheir slain companions. As for myself, I was only regarded with fresh\nwonder, and they all stood blinking at me with their half-closed\neyes. Suddenly the Kohen fell prostrate on his knees before me, and\nbowing his head handed me his bloody knife.\n\n\"Atam-or,\" said he, \"give me also the blessing of darkness and death!\"\n\nAt these strange words, following such actions, I could say nothing.\nI was more bewildered than ever, and horror and bewilderment made me\ndumb. I turned away and went aft to Almah, who had seen it all. She\nlooked at me with an anxious gaze, as if to learn what the effect of\nall this had been on me. I could not speak a word, but with a vague\nsense of the necessity of self-preservation, I loaded my rifle, and\ntried in vain to make out what might be the meaning of this union of\ngentleness and kindness with atrocious cruelty. Meanwhile, the men\nall went to work upon various tasks. Some secured lines about the\nmonster so as to tow it astern; others busied themselves with the\ncorpses, collecting them and arranging them in rows. At length we\nreturned, towing the monster astern.\n\nI could not speak until I was back again in the lighted rooms and\nalone with Almah; then I told her, as well as I could, the horror\nthat I felt.\n\n\"It was honor to those brave men,\" said she.\n\n\"Honor!\" said I. \"What! to kill them?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said she; \"it is so with these people; with them death is the\nhighest blessing. They all love death and seek after it. To die for\nanother is immortal glory. To kill the wounded was to show that they\nhad died for others. The wounded wished it themselves. You saw how\nthey all sought after death. These people were too generous and\nkind-hearted to refuse to kill them after they had received wounds.\"\n\nAt this my perplexity grew deeper than ever, for such an\nexplanation as this only served to make the mystery greater.\n\n\"Here,\" said she, \"no one understands what it is to fear death.\nThey all love it and long for it; but everyone wishes above all to\ndie for others. This is their highest blessing. To die a natural\ndeath in bed is avoided if possible.\"\n\nAll this was incomprehensible.\n\n\"Tell me, Almah,\" I said--\"you hate darkness as I do--do you not\nfear death?\"\n\n\"I fear it above all things,\" said Almah. \"To me it is the horror\nof life; it is the chief of terrors.\"\n\n\"So it is with me,\" said I. \"In my country we call death the King\nof Terrors.\"\n\n\"Here,\" said Almah, \"they call death the Lord of Joy.\"\n\nNot long after, the Kohen came in, looking as quiet, as gentle,\nand as amiable as ever. He showed some curiosity about my rifle,\nwhich he called a sepet-ram, or \"rod of thunder.\" Almah also\nshowed curiosity. I did not care to explain the process of loading\nit to the Kohen, though Almah had seen me load it in the galley,\nand I left him to suppose that it was used in some mysterious way.\nI cautioned him not to handle it carelessly, but found that this\ncaution only made him the more eager to handle it, since the prospect\nof an accident found an irresistible attraction. I would not let it\ngo out of my own hands, however; and the Kohen, whose self-denial\nwas always most wonderful to me, at once checked his curiosity.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nTHE SWAMP MONSTER\n\n\nA few joms after, I was informed by the Kohen that there was to be\nanother sacred hunt. At first I felt inclined to refuse, but on\nlearning that Almah was going, I resolved to go also; for Almah,\nthough generally mistress of her actions, had nevertheless certain\nduties to perform, and among these was the necessity of accompanying\nhunting-parties. I did not yet understand her position here, nor had I\nheard from her yet how it was that she was so different from the rest\nof them. That was all to be learned at a future time. For the present\nI had to be satisfied with knowing that she belonged to a different\nnation, who spoke a different language, and that all her thoughts and\nfeelings were totally different from those of the people among whom\nshe was living. She loved the light, she feared death, and she had\nnever been able in the slightest degree to reconcile herself to the\nhabits of these people. This I could readily understand, for to me it\nseemed as though they lived in opposition to nature itself.\n\nWe went out into the daylight, and then I saw a sight which filled me\nwith amazement. I saw a flock of birds larger than even the opkuks.\nThey were called \"opmahera.\" They seemed as tall as giraffes, and\ntheir long legs indicated great powers of running. Their wings were\nvery short, and not adapted for flight. They were very tractable, and\nwere harnessed for riding in a peculiar way; lines like reins were\nfastened to the wings, and the driver, who sat close by the neck,\nguided the bird in this way. Each bird carried two men, but for Almah\nand me there was a bird apiece. An iron prod was also taken by each\ndriver as a spur. I did not find out until afterward how to drive. At\nthat time the prospect of so novel a ride was such an exciting one\nthat I forgot everything else. The birds seemed quiet and docile. I\ntook it for granted that mine was well trained, and would go with the\nothers of his own accord. We all mounted by means of a stone platform\nwhich stood by the pyramid, and soon were on our way.\n\nThe speed was amazing; the fastest race-horse at home is slow compared\nwith this. It was as swift as an ordinary railway train, if not more\nso. For some minutes the novelty of my situation took away all other\nthoughts, and I held the reins in my hands without knowing how to use\nthem. But this mattered not, for the well-trained bird kept on after\nthe others, while Almah on her bird was close behind me. The pace, as\nI said, was tremendous, yet no easier motion can be imagined. The bird\nbounded along with immense leaps, with wings outstretched, but its\nfeet touched the ground so lightly that the motion seemed almost equal\nto flying. We did not confine ourselves to the roads, for the birds\nwere capable of going over any kind of country in a straight line. On\nthis occasion we passed over wide fields and rocky mountain ridges\nand deep swamps and sand wastes at the same speed, until at length\nwe reached a vast forest of dense tree-ferns, where the whole band\nstopped for a short time, after which we took up a new direction,\nmoving on more slowly. The forest grew up out of a swamp, which\nextended as far as the eye could reach from the sea to the mountains.\nAlong the edge of this forest we went for some time, until at length\nthere came a rushing, crackling sound, as of something moving there\namong the trees, crushing down everything in its progress. We halted,\nand did not have to wait long; for soon, not far away, there emerged\nfrom the thick forest a figure of incredible size and most hideous\naspect.\n\nIt looked like one of those fabled dragons such as may be seen in\npictures, but without wings. It was nearly a hundred feet in length,\nwith a stout body and a long tail, covered all over with impenetrable\nscales. It hind-legs were rather longer than its fore-legs, and it\nmoved its huge body with ease and rapidity. Its feet were armed with\nformidable claws. But its head was most terrific. It was a vast mass\nof bone, with enormous eyes that glared like fire; its jaws opened to\nthe width of six or eight feet, and were furnished with rows of sharp\nteeth, while at the extremity of its nose there was a tusk several\nfeet long, like the horn of a rhinoceros, curving backward. All this\nI took in at the first glance, and the next instant the whole band\nof hunters, with their usual recklessness, flung themselves upon the\nmonster.\n\nFor a short time all was the wildest confusion--an intermingling of\nbirds and men, with the writhing and roaring beast. With his huge\nclaws and his curved horn and his wide jaws he dealt death and\ndestruction all around; yet still the assailants kept at their work.\nMany leaped down to the ground and rushed close up to the monster,\nthrusting their lances into the softer and more unprotected parts\nof his body; while others, guiding their birds with marvellous\ndexterity, assailed him on all sides. The birds, too, were kept well\nto their work; nor did they exhibit any fear. It was not until they\nwere wounded that they sought to fly. Still, the contest seemed too\nunequal. The sacrifice of life was horrible. I saw men and birds\nliterally torn to pieces before my eyes. Nevertheless, the utter\nfearlessness of the assailants confounded me. In spite of the\nslaughter, fresh crowds rushed on. They clambered over his back, and\nstrove to drive their lances under his bony cuirass. In the midst of\nthem I saw the Kohen. By some means he had reached the animal's back,\nand was crawling along, holding by the coarse shaggy mane. At length\nhe stopped, and with a sudden effort thrust his lance into the\nmonster's eye. The vast beast gave a low and terrible howl; his\nimmense tail went flying all about; in his pain he rolled over and\nover, crushing underneath him in his awful struggles all who were\nnearest. I could no longer be inactive. I raised my rifle, and as the\nbeast in his writhings exposed his belly I took aim at the soft flesh\njust inside his left fore-leg, and fired both barrels.\n\nAt that instant my bird gave a wild, shrill scream and a vast bound\ninto the air, and then away it went like the wind--away, I know not\nwhere. That first bound had nearly jerked me off; but I managed to\navoid this and now instinctively clung with all my might to the bird's\nneck, still holding my rifle. The speed of the bird was twice as great\nas it had been before--as the speed of a runaway horse surpasses\nthat of the same horse when trotting at his ordinary rate and under\ncontrol. I could scarcely make out where I was going. Rocks, hills,\nswamps, fields, trees, sand, and sea all seemed to flash past in one\nconfused assemblage, and the only thought in my mind was that I was\nbeing carried to some remote wilderness, to be flung there bruised and\nmaimed among the rocks, to perish helplessly. Every moment I expected\nto be thrown, for the progress of the bird was not only inconceivably\nswift, but it also gave immense leaps into the air; and it was only\nits easy mode of lighting on the ground after each leap that saved me\nfrom being hurled off. As it was, however, I clung instinctively to\nthe bird's neck, until at last it came to a stop so suddenly that my\nhands slipped, and I fell to the ground.\n\nI was senseless for I know not how long. When at last I revived I\nfound myself propped up against a bank, and Almah bathing my head with\ncold water. Fortunately, I had received no hurt. In falling I had\nstruck on my head, but it was against the soft turf, and though I\nwas stunned, yet on regaining my senses no further inconvenience was\nexperienced. The presence of Almah was soon explained. The report of\nthe rifle had startled her bird also, which had bounded away in terror\nlike mine; but Almah understood how to guide him, and managed to keep\nhim after me, so as to be of assistance in case of need. She had been\nclose behind all the time, and had stopped when I fell, and come to\nmy assistance.\n\nThe place was a slope looking out upon an arm of the sea, and\napparently remote from human abode. The scenery was exquisitely\nbeautiful. A little distance off we saw the edge of the forest; the\nopen country was dotted with clumps of trees; on the other side of the\narm of the sea was an easy declivity covered with trees of luxuriant\nfoliage and vast dimensions; farther away on one side rose the icy\nsummits of impassable mountains; on the other side there extended\nthe blue expanse of the boundless sea. The spot where I lay was\nover-shadowed by the dense foliage of a tree which was unlike anything\nthat I had ever seen, and seemed like some exaggerated grass; at our\nfeet a brook ran murmuring to the shore; in the air and all around\nwere innumerable birds.\n\nThe situation in which I found myself seemed inexpressibly sweet, and\nall the more so from the gentle face of Almah. Would it not be well,\nI thought, to remain here? Why should Almah go back to her repulsive\nduties? Why should we return to those children of blood, who loved\ndeath and darkness? Here we might pass our days together unmolested.\nThe genial climate would afford us warmth; we needed no shelter except\nthe trees, and as for food, there were the birds of the air in\ninnumerable flocks.\n\nI proposed this to her; she smiled sadly. \"You forget,\" said she,\n\"this season of light will not last much longer. In a few more joms\nthe dark season will begin, and then we should perish in a place like\nthis.\"\n\n\"Are there no caverns here?\"\n\n\"Oh no. This country has no inhabitants. It is full of fierce wild\nbeasts. We should be destroyed before one jom.\"\n\n\"But must we go back?\" said I. \"You have a country. Where is it? See,\nhere are these birds. They are swift. They can carry us anywhere.\nCome, let us fly, and you can return to your own country.\"\n\nAlmah shook her head. \"These birds,\" said she, \"cannot go over the\nsea, or through these endless forests. My country can only be reached\nby sea.\"\n\n\"Can we not hurry back, seize a boat, and go? I know how to sail over\nthe water without oars.\"\n\n\"We certainly might leave the country; but there is another\ndifficulty. The dark season is coming, and we should never be able\nto find our way. Besides, the sea is full of monsters, and you and\nI would perish.\"\n\n\"At any rate, let us try. I have my sepet-ram.\"\n\n\"We could never find our way.\"\n\n\"Only tell me,\" said I, \"where it lies, and I will go by the stars.\"\n\n\"The trouble is,\" said she, \"that even if we did succeed in reaching\nmy land, I should be sent back again; for I was sent here as a sacred\nhostage, and I have been here four seasons.\"\n\nBut in the midst of this conversation a sound arrested our\nattention--heavy, puffing, snorting sound, as of some living thing.\nHastily I started up, rifle in hand, and looked; and as I looked I\nfelt my nerves thrill with horror. There, close by the shore, I saw a\nvast form--a living thing--full sixty feet in length. It had a body\nlike that of an elephant, the head of a crocodile, and enormous\nglaring eyes. Its immense body was covered with impenetrable armor,\nand was supported on legs long enough to allow it to run with great\nspeed. It differed in many respects from the monster of the swamp--the\nlegs being longer, the tail shorter and thinner, and its head and jaws\nlarger and longer. I shrank back, thinking of seizing Almah and\nhiding. But I saw that she had already taken the alarm, and with more\npresence of mind than I had she had hurried to the birds, who were\nstanding near, and had made them lie down. As I turned, she beckoned\nto me without a word. I hurried to her. She told me to mount. I did so\nat once; she did the same. Scarce had we mounted than the monster\nperceived us, and with a terrible bellow came rushing toward us. Almah\ndrove her goad deep into her bird, which at once rose and went off\nlike the wind, and mine started to follow. The vast monster came on.\nHis roar sounded close behind, and I heard the clash of his tremendous\njaws; but the swift bird with a bound snatched me from his grasp, and\nbore me far away out of his reach. Away I went like the wind. Almah\nwas ahead, looking back from time to time, and waving her hand\njoyously. So we went on, returning on our course at a speed almost as\ngreat as that with which we had come. By this time the novelty had in\npart worn away, and the easy motion gave me confidence. I noticed that\nwe were travelling a wild, uninhabited, and rocky district by the\nsea-side. Before me the country spread far away, interspersed with\ngroves, terminating in forests, and bounded in the far distance by\nmountains. The country here was so rough that it seemed as if nothing\ncould pass over it except such creatures as these--the opmaheras.\n\nAt length we arrived at the spot which we had left--the scene of the\nhunt. We could see it from afar, for the opmaheras stood quietly\naround, and the men were busy elsewhere. As we drew nearer I saw the\nvast body of the monster. They had succeeded in killing it, yet--oh\nheavens, at what a cost! One half of all the party lay dead. The rest\nwere unharmed, and among these was the Kohen. He greeted me with a\nmelancholy smile. That melancholy smile, however, was not caused by\nthe sad fate of his brave companions, but, as I afterward learned,\nsimply and solely because he himself had not gained his death. When I\nsaw that there were no wounded, a dark suspicion came over me that the\nwounded had again been put to death. I did not care to ask. The truth\nwas too terrible to hear, and I felt glad that accident had drawn me\naway. It was all a dark and dreadful mystery. These people were the\nmost gentle, the most self-sacrificing, and the most generous in the\nworld; yet their strange and unnatural love of death made them capable\nof endless atrocities. Life and light seemed to them as actual evils,\nand death and darkness the only things worthy of regard.\n\nAlmah told me that they were going to bring the monster home, and had\nsent for opkuks to drag it along. The dead were also to be fetched\nback. There was no further necessity for us to remain, and so we\nreturned at once.\n\nOn the way, Almah said, \"Do not use the sepet-ram again. You can do\nno good with it. You must not make it common. Keep it. The time may\ncome when you will need it: you are not fond of death.\"\n\nI shuddered.\n\n\"Never forget,\" she said, \"that here death is considered the chief\nblessing. It is useless for you to interfere in their ways. You cannot\nchange them.\"\n\nSome more joms passed. The bodies were embalmed, and Almah had more\nvictims to crown with garlands in the horrible cheder nebilin.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nTHE BALEFUL SACRIFICE\n\n\nI resolved to go on no more sacred hunts. I was sickened at the\nhorrible cruelty, the needless slaughter, the mad self-sacrifice which\ndistinguished them. I was overwhelmed with horror at the merciless\ndestruction of brave comrades, whose wounds, so gallantly received,\nshould have been enough to inspire pity even in a heart of stone. The\ngentleness, the incessant kindness, the matchless generosity of these\npeople seemed all a mockery. What availed it all when the same hand\nthat heaped favors upon me, the guest, could deal death without\ncompunction upon friends and relatives? It seemed quite possible for\nthe Kohen to kill his own child, or cut the throat of his wife, if the\nhumor seized him. And how long could I hope to be spared among a\npeople who had this insane thirst for blood?\n\nSome more joms had passed, and the light season had almost ended.\nThe sun had been sinking lower and lower. The time had at last come\nwhen only a portion of his disk would be visible for a little while\nabove the hills, and then he would be seen no more for six months of\nour time. This was the dark season, and, as I had already learned, its\nadvent was always hailed with joy and celebrated with solemn services,\nfor the dark season freed them from their long confinement, permitted\nthem to go abroad, to travel by sea and land, to carry on their great\nworks, to indulge in all their most important labors and favorite\namusements. The Kohen asked me to be present at the great festival,\nand I gladly consented. There seemed to be nothing in this that\ncould be repellent. As I was anxious to witness some of their purely\nreligious ceremonies, I wished to go. When I told Almah, she looked\nsad, but said nothing. I wondered at this, and asked her if she was\ngoing. She informed me that she would have to go, whereupon I assured\nher that this was an additional reason why I should go.\n\nI went with Almah. The Kohen attended us with his usual kind and\ngracious consideration. It seemed almost as though he was our servant.\nHe took us to a place where we could be seated, although all the\nothers were standing. Almah wished to refuse, but I prevailed upon her\nto sit down, and she did so.\n\nThe scene was upon the semicircular terrace in front of the cavern,\nand we were seated upon a stone platform beside the chief portal. A\nvast crowd was gathered in front. Before us arose the half-pyramid of\nwhich I have already spoken. The light was faint. It came from the\ndisk of the sun, which was partly visible over the icy crest of the\ndistant mountains. Far away the sea was visible, rising high over the\ntops of the trees, while overhead the brighter stars were plainly\ndiscernible.\n\nThe Kohen ascended the pyramid, and others followed. At the base\nthere was a crowd of men, with emaciated forms and faces, and coarse,\nsqualid attire, who looked like the most abject paupers, and seemed\nthe lowest in the land. As the Kohen reached the summit there arose a\nstrange sound--a mournful, plaintive chant, which seemed to be sung\nchiefly by the paupers at the base of the pyramid. The words of this\nchant I could not make out, but the melancholy strain affected me\nin spite of myself. There was no particular tune, and nothing like\nharmony; but the effect of so many voices uniting in this strain was\nvery powerful and altogether indescribable. In the midst of this I saw\nthe crowd parting asunder so as to make way for something; and through\nthe passage thus formed I saw a number of youths in long robes, who\nadvanced to the pyramid, singing as they went. Then they ascended the\nsteps, two by two, still singing, and at length reached the summit,\nwhere they arranged themselves in order. There were thirty of them and\nthey arranged themselves in three rows of ten each, and as they stood\nthey never ceased to sing, while the paupers below joined in the\nstrain.\n\nAnd now the sun was almost hidden, and there was only the faintest\nline from the upper edge of his disk perceptible over the icy\nmountain-tops. The light was a softened twilight glow. It was to be\nthe last sight of the sun for six months, and this was the spectacle\nupon which he threw his parting beam. So the sun passed away, and then\nthere came the beginning of the long dark season. At first, however,\nthere was rather twilight than darkness, and this twilight continued\nlong. All this only served to heighten the effect of this striking\nscene; and as the light faded away, I looked with increasing curiosity\nupon the group at the top of the pyramid. Almah was silent. I half\nturned, and said something to her about the beauty of the view. She\nsaid nothing, but looked at me with such an expression that I was\nfilled with amazement. I saw in her face something like a dreadful\nanticipation--something that spoke of coming evil. The feeling was\ncommunicated to me, and I turned my eyes back to the group on the\npyramid with vague fears in my soul.\n\nThose fears were but too well founded, for now the dread ceremony\nbegan. The Kohen drew his knife, and placed himself at the head of the\nstone table. One of the youths came forward, stepped upon it, and lay\ndown on his back with his head toward the Kohen. The mournful chant\nstill went on. Then the Kohen raised his knife and plunged it into the\nheart of the youth. I sat for a moment rooted to the spot; then a\ngroan burst from me in spite of myself. Almah caught my hands in hers,\nwhich were as cold as ice.\n\n\"Be firm,\" she said, \"or we are both lost. Be firm, Atam-or!\"\n\n\"I must go,\" said I, and I tried to rise.\n\n\"Don't move,\" she said, \"for your life! We are lost if you move. Keep\nstill--restrain yourself--shut your eyes.\"\n\nI tried to do so, but could not. There was a horrible fascination\nabout the scene which forced me to look and see all. The Kohen took\nthe victim, and drawing it from the altar, threw it over the precipice\nto the ground beneath. Then a loud shout burst forth from the great\ncrowd. \"Sibgu Sibgin! Ranenu! Hodu lecosck!\" which means, \"Sacrifice\nthe victims! Rejoice! Give thanks to darkness!\"\n\nThen another of the youths went forward amid the singing, and laid\nhimself down to meet the same fate; and again the corpse was flung\nfrom the top of the pyramid, and again the shout arose. All the others\ncame forward in the same manner. Oh, horrible, horrible, thrice\nhorrible spectacle! I do not remember how I endured it. I sat there\nwith Almah, trying to restrain myself as she had entreated me, more\nfor her sake than for my own, a prey to every feeling of horror,\nanguish, and despair. How it all ended I do not know, nor do I know\nhow I got away from the place; for I only remember coming back to my\nsenses in the lighted grotto, with Almah bending anxiously over me.\n\nAfter this there remained a dark mystery and an ever-present horror. I\nfound myself among a people who were at once the gentlest of the human\nrace and the most blood-thirsty--the kindest and the most cruel. This\nmild, amiable, and self-sacrificing Kohen, how was it possible that\nhe should transform himself to a fiend incarnate? And for me and for\nAlmah, what possible hope could there be? What fate might they have\nin reserve for us? Of what avail was all this profound respect, this\nincessant desire to please, this attention to our slightest wish, this\ncomfort and luxury and splendor, this freedom of speech and action?\nWas it anything better than a mockery? Might it not be the shallow\nkindness of the priest to the victim reserved for the sacrifice? Was\nit, after all, in any degree better than the kindness of the cannibal\nsavages on those drear outer shores who received us with such\nhospitality, but only that they might destroy us at last? Might they\nnot all belong to the same race, dwelling as they did in caverns,\nshunning the sunlight, and blending kindness with cruelty? It was an\nawful thought!\n\nYet I had one consolation. Almah was with me, and so long as she was\nspared to me I could endure this life. I tried for her sake to resist\nthe feelings that were coming over me. I saw that she too was a prey\nto ever-deepening sadness. She felt as I did, and this despair of soul\nmight wreck her young life if there were no alleviation. And so I\nsought to alleviate her distress and to banish her sadness. The songs\nof these people had much impressed me; and one day, as I talked about\nthis with Almah, she brought forth a musical instrument of peculiar\nshape, which was not unlike a guitar, though the shape was square and\nthere were a dozen strings. Upon this she played, singing at the same\ntime some songs of a plaintive character. An idea now occurred to me\nto have an instrument made according to my own plans, which should be\nnothing less than a violin. Almah was delighted at the proposal, and\nat once found a very clever workman, who under my direction succeeded\nin producing one which served my purpose well. I was a good violinist,\nand in this I was able to find solace for myself and for Almah for\nmany a long hour.\n\nThe first time that I played was memorable. As the tones floated\nthrough the air they caught the ears of those outside, and soon great\nnumbers came into the apartment, listening in amazement and in rapt\nattention. Even the painful light was disregarded in the pleasure of\nthis most novel sensation, and I perceived that if the sense of sight\nwas deficient among them, that of hearing was sufficiently acute.\nI played many times, and sometimes sang from among the songs of\ndifferent nations; but those which these people liked best were the\nIrish and Scottish melodies--those matchless strains created by the\ngenius of the Celtic race, and handed down from immemorial ages\nthrough long generations. In these there was nothing artificial,\nnothing transient. They were the utterance of the human heart, and in\nthem there was that touch of nature which makes all men kin. These\nwere the immortal passions which shall never cease to affect the soul\nof man, and which had power even here; the strains of love, of\nsadness, and of pathos were sweet and enticing to this gentle race;\nfor in their mild manners and their outburst of cruelty they seemed to\nbe not unlike the very race which had created this music, since the\nCelt is at once gentle and blood-thirsty.\n\nI played \"Tara,\" \"Bonnie Doon,\" \"The Last Rose of Summer,\" \"The Land\nof the Leal,\" \"Auld Lang Syne,\" \"Lochaber.\" They stood entranced,\nlistening with all their souls. They seemed to hunger and thirst after\nthis music, and the strains of the inspired Celtic race seemed to come\nto them like the revelation of the glory of heaven. Then I played more\nlively airs. Some I played a second time, singing the words. They\nseemed eager to have the same one played often. At last a grisly\nthought came to me: it was that they would learn these sweet strains,\nand put their own words to them so as to use them at the awful\nsacrifices. After that I would play no more.\n\nIt is a land of tender love and remorseless cruelty. Music is\nall-powerful to awaken the one, but powerless to abate the other; and\nthe eyes that weep over the pathetic strains of \"Lochaber\" can gaze\nwithout a tear upon the death-agonies of a slaughtered friend.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nTHE AWFUL \"MISTA KOSEK\"\n\n\nThe terrible sacrifice marked the end of the light season. The dark\nseason had now begun, which would last for half the coming year. No\nmore sunlight would now be visible, save at first for a few joms,\nwhen at certain times the glare would be seen shooting up above the\nicy crests of the mountains. Now the people all moved out of the\ncaverns into the stone houses on the opposite side of the terraces,\nand the busy throng transferred themselves and their occupations to\nthe open air. This with them was the season of activity, when all\ntheir most important affairs were undertaken and carried out; the\nseason, too, of enjoyment, when all the chief sports and festivals\ntook place. Then the outer world all awoke to life; the streets were\nthronged, fleets of galleys came forth from their moorings, and the\nsounds of labor and of pleasure, of toil and revelry, arose into the\ndarkened skies. Then the city was a city of the living, no longer\nsilent, but full of bustle, and the caverns were frequented but\nlittle. This cavern life was only tolerable during the light season,\nwhen the sun-glare was over the land; but now, when the beneficent and\ngrateful darkness pervaded all things, the outer world was infinitely\nmore agreeable.\n\nTo me, however, the arrival of the dark season brought only additional\ngloom. I could not get rid of the thought that I was reserved for some\nhorrible fate, in which Almah might also be involved. We were both\naliens here, in a nation of kind-hearted and amiable miscreants--of\ngenerous, refined, and most self-denying fiends; of men who were\nhighly civilized, yet utterly wrong-headed and irreclaimable in their\nblood-thirsty cruelty. The stain of blood-guiltiness was over all the\nland. What was I, that I could hope to be spared? The hope was\nmadness, and I did not pretend to indulge it.\n\nThe only consolation was Almah. The manners of these people were such\nthat we were still left as unconstrained as ever in our movements, and\nalways, wherever we went, we encountered nothing but amiable smiles\nand courteous offices. Everyone was always eager to do anything for\nus--to give, to go, to act, to speak, as though we were the most\nhonored of guests, the pride of the city. The Kohen was untiring in\nhis efforts to please. He was in the habit of making presents every\ntime he came to see me, and on each occasion the present was of a\ndifferent kind; at one time it was a new robe of curiously wrought\nfeathers, at another some beautiful gem, at another some rare fruit.\nHe also made incessant efforts to render my situation pleasant, and\nwas delighted at my rapid progress in acquiring the language.\n\nOn the jom following the sacrifice I accompanied Almah as she went\nto her daily task, and after it was over I asked when the new victims\nwould be placed here. \"How long does it take to embalm them?\" I added.\n\nAlmah looked at me earnestly. \"They will not bring them here; they\nwill not embalm them,\" said she.\n\n\"Why not?\" I asked; \"what will they do with them?\"\n\n\"Do not ask,\" said she. \"It will pain you to know.\"\n\nIn spite of repeated solicitation she refused to give me any\nsatisfaction. I felt deeply moved at her words and her looks. What was\nit, I wondered, that could give me pain? or what could there still\nbe that could excite fear in me, who had learned and seen so much? I\ncould not imagine. It was evidently some disposal of the bodies of\nthe victims--that was plain. Turning this over in my mind, with vague\nconjectures as to Almah's meaning, I left her and walked along the\nterrace until I came to the next cavern. This had never been open\nbefore, and I now entered through curiosity to see what it might be.\nI saw a vast cavern, quite as large as the cheder nebilin, full of\npeople, who seemed to be engaged in decorating it. Hundreds were at\nwork, and they had brought immense tree-ferns, which were placed on\neither side in long rows, with their branches meeting and interlacing\nat the top. It looked like the interior of some great Gothic cathedral\nat night, and the few twinkling lights that were scattered here and\nthere made the shadowy outline just visible to me.\n\nI asked one of the bystanders what this might be, and he told me that\nit was the Mista Kosek, which means the \"Feast of Darkness,\" from\nwhich I gathered that they were about to celebrate the advent of the\ndark season with a feast. From what I knew of their character this\nseemed quite intelligible, and there was much beauty and taste in the\narrangements. All were industrious and orderly, and each one seemed\nmost eager to assist his neighbor. Indeed, there seemed to be a\nfriendly rivalry in this which at times amounted to positive violence;\nfor more than once when a man was seen carrying too large a burden,\nsomeone else would insist on taking it from him. At first these\naltercations seemed exactly like the quarrels of workmen at home, but\na closer inspection showed that it was merely the persistent effort\nof one to help another.\n\nI learned that the feast was to take place as soon as the hall was\ndecorated, and that it would be attended by a great multitude. I felt\na great interest in it. There seemed something of poetic beauty in\nthis mode of welcoming the advent of a welcome season, and it served\nto mitigate the horrible remembrance of that other celebration, upon\nwhich I could not think without a shudder. I thought that it would be\npleasant to join with them here, and resolved to ask Almah to come\nwith me, so that she might explain the meaning of the ceremonies. Full\nof this thought, I went to her and told her my wish. She looked at me\nwith a face full of amazement and misery. In great surprise I\nquestioned her eagerly.\n\n\"Ask me nothing,\" said she. \"I will answer nothing; but do not think\nof it. Do not go near it. Stay in your room till the fearful repast is\nover.\"\n\n\"Fearful? How is it fearful?\" I asked.\n\n\"Everything here is fearful,\" said Almah, with a sigh. \"Every season\nit grows worse, and I shall grow at length to hate life and love death\nas these people do. They can never understand us, and we can never\nunderstand them. Oh, if I could but once more stand in my own dear\nnative land but for one moment--to see once more the scenes and the\nfaces that I love so well! Oh, how different is this land from mine!\nHere all is dark, all is terrible. There the people love the light and\nrejoice in the glorious sun, and when the dark season comes they wait,\nand have no other desire than long day. There we live under the sky,\nin the eye of the sun. We build our houses, and when the dark season\ncomes we fill them with lamps that make a blaze like the sun itself.\"\n\n\"We must try to escape,\" I said, in a low voice.\n\n\"Escape!\" said she. \"That is easy enough. We might go now; but where?\"\n\n\"Back,\" said I, \"to your own country. See, the sky is dotted with\nstars: I can find my way by them.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said she, \"if I could only tell you where to go; but I cannot.\nMy country lies somewhere over the sea, but where, I know not. Over\nthe sea there are many lands, and we might reach one even worse than\nthis.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said I, \"the Kohen might allow us to go away to your\ncountry, and send us there. He is most generous and most amiable. He\nseems to spend most of his time in efforts to make us happy. There\nmust be many seamen in this nation who know the way. It would be worth\ntrying.\"\n\nAlmah shook her head. \"You do not understand these people,\" said she.\n\"Their ruling passion is the hatred of self, and therefore they are\neager to confer benefits on others. The only hope of life that I have\nfor you and for myself is in this, that if they kill us they will lose\ntheir most agreeable occupation. They value us most highly, because\nwe take everything that is given us. You and I now possess as our own\nproperty all this city and all its buildings, and all the people have\nmade themselves our slaves.\"\n\nAt this I was utterly bewildered.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" said I.\n\n\"I suppose not,\" said Almah; \"but you will understand better after you\nhave been here longer. At any rate, you can see for yourself that the\nruling passion here is self-denial and the good of others. Everyone is\nintent upon this, from the Kohen up to the most squalid pauper.\"\n\n\"_Up_ to the most squalid pauper?\" said I. \"I do not understand you.\nYou mean _down_ to the most squalid pauper.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Almah; \"I mean what I say. In this country the paupers form\nthe most honored and envied class.\"\n\n\"This is beyond my comprehension,\" said I. \"But if this is really so,\nand if these people pretend to be our slaves, why may we not order out\na galley and go?\"\n\n\"Oh, well, with you in your land, if a master were to order his slaves\nto cut his throat and poison his children and burn his house, would\nthe slaves obey?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"Well, our slaves here would not--in fact could not--obey a command\nthat would be shocking to their natures. They think that we are in the\nbest of all lands, and my request to be sent home would be utterly\nmonstrous.\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" said I, \"they would kill us if we asked them to do so?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Almah; \"for they think death the greatest blessing.\"\n\n\"And if at the point of death we should beg for life, would they spare\nus?\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said Almah. \"Would you kill a man who asked for\ndeath? No more would these people spare a man who asked for life.\"\n\nAll this was so utterly incomprehensible that I could pursue the\nsubject no further. I saw, however, that Almah was wretched, dejected,\nand suffering greatly from home-sickness. Gladly would I have taken\nher and started off on a desperate flight by sea or land--gladly would\nI have dared every peril, although I well knew what tremendous perils\nthere were; but she would not consent, and believed the attempt to be\nuseless. I could only wait, therefore, and indulge the hope that at\nlast a chance of escape might one day come, of which she would be\nwilling to avail herself.\n\nAlmah utterly refused to go to the feast, and entreated me not to go;\nbut this only served to increase my curiosity, and I determined to see\nit for myself, whatever it was. She had seen it, and why should not I?\nWhatever it might be, my nerves could surely stand the shock as well\nas hers. Besides, I was anxious to know the very worst; and if there\nwas anything that could surpass in atrocity what I had already\nwitnessed, it were better that I should not remain in ignorance of it.\n\nSo at length, leaving Almah, I returned to the hall of the feast. I\nfound there a vast multitude, which seemed to comprise the whole\ncity--men, women, children, all were there. Long tables were laid out.\nThe people were all standing an waiting. A choir was singing plaintive\nstrains that sounded like the chant of the sacrifice. Those nearest me\nregarded me with their usual amiable smiles, and wished to conduct me\nto some place of honor; but I did not care about taking part in this\nfeast. I wished to be a mere spectator, nothing more. I walked past\nand came to the next cavern. This seemed to be quite as large as the\nother. There was a crowd of people here also, and at one end there\nblazed an enormous fire. It was a furnace that seemed to be used for\ncooking the food of this banquet, and there was a thick steam rising\nfrom an immense cauldron, while the air was filled with an odor like\nthat of a kitchen.\n\nAll this I took in at a glance, and at the same instant I saw\nsomething else. There were several very long tables, which stood at\nthe sides of the cavern and in the middle, and upon each of these I\nsaw lying certain things covered over with cloths. The shape of these\nwas more than suggestive--it told me all. It was a sight of\nhorror--awful, tremendous, unspeakable! For a moment I stood\nmotionless staring; then all the cavern seemed to swim around me. I\nreeled, I fell, and sank into nothingness.\n\nWhen I revived I was in the lighted grotto, lying on a couch, with\nAlmah bending over me. Her face was full of tenderest anxiety, yet\nthere was also apparent a certain solemn gloom that well accorded with\nmy own feelings. As I looked at her she drew a long breath, and buried\nher face in her hands.\n\nAfter a time my recollection returned, and all came back to me. I rose\nto a sitting posture.\n\n\"Do not rise yet,\" said Almah, anxiously; \"you are weak.\"\n\n\"No,\" said I; \"I am as strong as ever; but I'm afraid that you are\nweaker.\"\n\nAlmah shuddered.\n\n\"If you had told me exactly what it was, I would not have gone.\"\n\n\"I could not tell you,\" said she. \"It is too terrible to name. Even\nthe thought is intolerable. I told you not to go. Why did you go?\"\n\nShe spoke in accents of tender reproach, and there were tears in her\neyes.\n\n\"I did not think of anything so hideous as that,\" said I. \"I thought\nthat there might be a sacrifice, but nothing worse.\"\n\nI now learned that when I fainted I had been raised most tenderly,\nand the Kohen himself came with me as I was carried back, and he\nthought that Almah would be my most agreeable nurse. The Kohen was\nmost kind and sympathetic, and all the people vied with one another\nin their efforts to assist me--so much so that there was the greatest\nconfusion. It was only by Almah's express entreaty that they retired\nand left me with her.\n\nHere was a new phase in the character of this mysterious people.\nCould I ever hope to understand them? Where other people are cruel to\nstrangers, or at best indifferent, these are eager in their acts of\nkindness; they exhibit the most unbounded hospitality, the most lavish\ngenerosity, the most self-denying care and attention; where others\nwould be offended at the intrusion of a stranger, and enraged at\nhis unconquerable disgust, these people had no feeling save pity,\nsympathy, and a desire to alleviate his distress. And yet--oh, and\nyet!--oh, thought of horror!--what was this that I had seen? The\nabhorrent savages in the outer wilderness were surely of the same race\nas these. They too received us kindly, they too lavished upon us their\nhospitality, and yet there followed the horror of that frightful\nrepast. Here there had been kindness and generosity and affectionate\nattention, to be succeeded by deeds without a name. Ah me! what an\nhour that was! And yet it was as nothing compared to what lay before\nme in the future.\n\nBut the subject was one of which I dared not speak--one from which I\nhad to force my thoughts away. I took the violin and played \"Lochaber\"\ntill Almah wept, and I had to put it away. Then I begged her to play\nor sing. She brought an instrument like a lute, and upon this she\nplayed some melancholy strains. At length the Kohen came in. His\nmild, benevolent face never exhibited more gentle and affectionate\nsympathy than now. He seated himself, and with eyes half closed, as\nusual, talked much; and yet, with a native delicacy which always\ndistinguished this extraordinary man, he made no allusion to the\nawful Mista Kosek. For my own part, I could not speak. I was\nabsent-minded, overwhelmed with gloom and despair, and at the same\ntime full of aversion toward him and all his race. One question,\nhowever, I had to put.\n\n\"Who were the victims of the Mista Kosek?\"\n\n\"They?\" said he, with an agreeable smile. \"Oh, they were the victims\nof the sacrifice.\"\n\nI sank back in my seat, and said no more. The Kohen then took Almah's\nlute, played and sang in a very sweet voice, and at length, with his\nusual consideration, seeing that I looked weary, he retired.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nI LEARN MY DOOM\n\n\nHorror is a feeling that cannot last long; human nature is\nincapable of supporting it. Sadness, whether from bereavement, or\ndisappointment, or misfortune of any kind, may linger on through life.\nIn my case, however, the milder and more enduring feeling of sadness\nhad no sufficient cause for existence. The sights which I had seen\ninspired horror, and horror only. But when the first rush of this\nfeeling had passed there came a reaction. Calmness followed, and then\nall the circumstances of my life here conspired to perpetuate that\ncalm. For here all on the surface was pleasant and beautiful; all the\npeople were amiable and courteous and most generous. I had light and\nluxury and amusements. Around me there were thousands of faces, all\ngreeting me with cordial affection, and thousands of hands all ready\nto perform my slightest wish. Above all, there was Almah. Everything\ncombined to make her most dear to me. My life had been such that I\nnever before had seen anyone whom I loved; and here Almah was the one\ncongenial associate in a whole world of aliens: she was beautiful\nand gentle and sympathetic, and I loved her dearly, even before I\nunderstood what my feelings were. One day I learned all, and found\nthat she was more precious to me than all the world.\n\nIt was one jom when she did not make her appearance as usual. On\nasking after her I learned that she was ill. At this intelligence\nthere came over me a feeling of sickening anxiety and fear. Almah ill!\nWhat if it should prove serious? Could I endure life here without her\nsweet companionship? Of what value was life without her? And as I\nasked myself these questions I learned that Almah had become dearer\nto me than life itself, and that in her was all the sunshine of my\nexistence. While she was absent, life was nothing; all its value, all\nits light, its flavor, its beauty, were gone. I felt utterly crushed.\nI forgot all else save her illness, and all that I had endured seemed\nas nothing when compared with this.\n\nIn the midst of my own anxiety I was surprised to find that the whole\ncommunity was most profoundly agitated. Among all classes there seemed\nto be but one thought--her illness. I could overhear them talking I\ncould see them wait outside to hear about her. It seemed to be the one\nsubject of interest, beside which all others were forgotten. The Kohen\nwas absorbed in her case; all the physicians of the city were more or\nless engaged in her behalf; and there came forward as volunteers every\nwoman in the place who had any knowledge of sick-duties. I was\nsomewhat perplexed, however, at their manner. They were certainly\nagitated and intensely interested, yet not exactly sad. Indeed, from\nwhat I heard it seemed as though this strange people regarded sickness\nas rather a blessing than otherwise. This, however, did not interfere\nin the slightest degree with the most intense interest in her, and the\nmost assiduous attention. The Kohen in particular was devoted to her.\nHe was absent-minded, silent, and full of care. On the whole, I felt\nmore than ever puzzled, and less able than ever to understand these\npeople. I loved them, yet loathed them; for the Kohen I had at once\naffection and horror. He looked like an anxious father, full of\ntenderest love for a sick child--full also of delicate sympathy with\nme; and yet I knew all the time that he was quite capable of plunging\nthe sacrificial knife in Almah's heart and of eating her afterward.\n\nBut my own thoughts were all of Almah. I learned how dear she was.\nWith her the brightness of life had passed; without her existence\nwould be intolerable. Her sweet voice, her tender and gracious manner,\nher soft touch, her tender, affectionate smile, her mournful yet\ntrustful look--oh, heavens! would all these be mine no more? I could\nnot endure the thought. At first I wandered about, seeking rest and\nfinding none; and at length I sat in my own room, and passed the time\nin listening, in questioning the attendants, in wondering what I\nshould do if she should be taken from me.\n\nAt length on one blessed jom, the Kohen came to me with a bright\nsmile.\n\n\"Our darling Almah is better,\" said he. \"Eat, I beseech you. She is\nvery dear to all of us, and we have all felt for her and for you. But\nnow all danger is past. The physicians say that she will soon be\nwell.\" There were tears in his eyes as he spoke. It may have been\ncaused by the bright light, but I attributed this to his loving heart,\nand I forgot that he was a cannibal. I took his hands in mine and\npressed them in deep emotion. He looked at me with a sweet and gentle\nsmile.\n\n\"I see it all,\" said he, in a low voice--\"you love her, Atam-or.\"\n\nI pressed his hands harder, but said nothing. Indeed, I could not\ntrust myself to speak.\n\n\"I knew it,\" said he; \"it is but natural. You are both of a different\nrace from us; you are both much alike, and in full sympathy with one\nanother. This draws you together. When I first saw you I thought that\nyou would be a fit companion for her here--that you would lessen her\ngloom, and that she would be pleasant to you. I found out soon that I\nwas right, and I felt glad, for you at once showed the fullest\nsympathy with one another. Never till you came was Almah happy with\nus; but since you have come she has been a different being, and there\nhas been a joyousness in her manner that I never saw before. You have\nmade her forget how to weep; and as for yourself, I hope she has made\nyour life in this strange land seem less painful, Atam-or.\"\n\nAt all this I was so full of amazement that I could not say one word.\n\n\"Pardon me,\" continued he, \"if I have said anything that may seem like\nan intrusion upon your secret and most sacred feelings. I could not\nhave said it had it not been for the deep affection I feel for Almah\nand for you, and for the reason that I am just now more moved than\nusual, and have less control over my feelings.\"\n\nSaying this, he pressed my hand and left me. It was not the custom\nhere to shake hands, but with his usual amiability he had adopted my\ncustom, and used it as naturally as though he had been to the manner\nborn.\n\nI was encouraged now. The mild Kohen came often to cheer me. He talked\nmuch about Almah--about her sweet and gracious disposition, the love\nthat all felt for her, the deep and intense interest which her illness\nhad aroused. In all this he seemed more like a man of my own race than\nbefore, and in his eager desire for her recovery he failed to exhibit\nthat love for death which was his nature. So it seemed: yet this\ndesire for her recovery did not arise out of any lack of love for\ndeath; its true cause I was to learn afterward; and I was to know that\nif he desired Almah's recovery now, it was only that she might live\nlong enough to encounter death in a more terrific form. But just then\nall this was unknown, and I judged him by myself.\n\nAt last I learned that she was much better, and would be out on the\nfollowing jom. This intelligence filled me with a fever of eager\nanticipation, so great that I could think of nothing else. Sleep was\nimpossible. I could only wait, and try as best I might to quell my\nimpatience. At last the time came. I sat waiting. The curtain was\ndrawn aside. I sprang up, and, hurrying toward her, I caught her in my\narms and wept for joy. Ah me, how pale she looked! She bore still the\nmarks of her illness. She seemed deeply embarrassed and agitated at\nthe fervor of my greeting; while I, instead of apologizing or trying\nto excuse myself, only grew more agitated still.\n\n\"Oh, Almah,\" I cried. \"I should have died if you had not come back to\nme! Oh, Almah, I love you better than life and I never knew how dearly\nI loved you till I thought that I had lost you! Oh, forgive me, but I\nmust tell you--and don't weep, darling.\"\n\nShe was weeping as I spoke. She said nothing, but twined her arms\naround my neck and wept on my breast. After this we had much to say\nthat we had never mentioned before. I cannot tell the sweet words that\nshe said to me; but I now learned that she had loved me from the\nfirst--when I came to her in her loneliness, when she was homesick and\nheartsick; and I came, a kindred nature, of a race more like her own;\nand she saw in me the only one of all around her whom it was possible\nnot to detest, and therefore she loved me.\n\nWe had many things to say to one another, and long exchanges of\nconfidence to make. She now for the first time told me all the sorrow\nthat she had endured in her captivity--sorrow which she had kept\nsilent and shut up deep within her breast. At first her life here had\nbeen so terrible that it had brought her down nearly to death. After\nthis she had sunk into dull despair; she had grown familiar with\nhorrors and lived in a state of unnatural calm. From this my arrival\nhad roused her. The display of feeling on my part had brought back\nall her old self, and roused anew all those feelings which in her had\nbecome dormant. The darkness, the bloodshed, the sacrifices, all these\naffected me as they had once affected her. I had the same fear of\ndeath which she had. When I had gone with her to the cheder nebilin,\nwhen I had used my sepet-ram to save life, she had perceived in me\nfeelings and impulses to which all her own nature responded. Finally,\nwhen I asked about the Mista Kosek, she warned me not to go. When I\ndid go she was with me in thought and suffered all that I felt, until\nthe moment when I was brought back and laid senseless at her feet.\n\n\"Then,\" said Almah, \"I felt the full meaning of all that lies before\nus.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" I asked, anxiously. \"You speak as though\nthere were something yet--worse than what has already been; yet\nnothing can possibly be worse. We have seen the worst; let us now try\nto shake off these grisly thoughts, and be happy with one another.\nYour strength will soon be back, and while we have one another we can\nbe happy even in this gloom.\"\n\n\"Ah me,\" said Almah, \"it would be better now to die. I could die happy\nnow, since I know that you love me.\"\n\n\"Death!\" said I; \"do not talk of it--do not mention that word. It is\nmore abhorrent than ever. No, Almah, let us live and love--let us\nhope--let us fly.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" said she, in a mournful voice. \"We cannot fly. There is\nno hope. We must face the future, and make up our minds to bear our\nfate.\"\n\n\"Fate!\" I repeated, looking at her in wonder and in deep concern.\n\"What do you mean by our fate? Is there anything more which you know\nand which I have not heard?\"\n\n\"You have heard nothing,\" said she, slowly; \"and all that you have\nseen and heard is as nothing compared with what lies before us. For\nyou and for me there is a fate--inconceivable, abhorrent,\ntremendous!--a fate of which I dare not speak or even think, and from\nwhich there is no escape whatever.\"\n\nAs Almah said this she looked at me with an expression in which terror\nand anguish were striving with love. Her cheeks, which shortly before\nhad flushed rosy red in sweet confusion, were now pallid, her lips\nashen; her eyes were full of a wild despair. I looked at her in\nwonder, and could not say a word.\n\n\"Oh, Atam-or,\" said she, \"I am afraid of death!\"\n\n\"Almah,\" said I, \"why will you speak of death? What is this fate which\nyou fear so much?\"\n\n\"It is this,\" said she hurriedly and with a shudder, \"you and I are\nsingled out. I have been reserved for years until one should be found\nwho might be joined with me. You came. I saw it all at once. I have\nknown it--dreaded it--tried to fight against it. But it was of no use.\nOh, Atam-or, our love means death; for the very fact that you love me\nand I love you seals our doom!\"\n\n\"Our doom? What doom?\"\n\n\"The sacrifice!\" exclaimed Almah, with another shudder. In her voice\nand look there was a terrible meaning, which I could not fail to take.\nI understood it now, and my blood curdled in my veins. Almah clung to\nme despairingly.\n\n\"Do not leave me!\" she cried--\"do not leave me! I have no one but you.\nThe sacrifice, the sacrifice! It is our doom the great sacrifice--at\nthe end of the dark season. It is at the amir. We must go there to\nmeet our doom.\"\n\n\"The amir?\" I asked; \"what is that?\"\n\n\"It is the metropolis,\" said she.\n\nI was utterly overwhelmed, yet still I tried to console her; but the\nattempt was vain.\n\n\"Oh!\" she cried, \"you will not understand. The sacrifice is but a\npart--it is but the beginning. Death is terrible; yet it may be\nendured--if there is only death. But oh!--oh think!--think of that\nwhich comes after--the Mista Kosek!\"\n\nNow the full meaning flashed upon me, and I saw it all. In an instant\nthere arose in my mind the awful sacrifice on the pyramid and the\nunutterable horror of the Mista Kosek. Oh, horror, horror,\nhorror! Oh, hideous abomination and deed without a name! I could not\nspeak. I caught her in my arms, and we both wept passionately.\n\nThe happiness of our love was now darkened by this tremendous cloud\nthat lowered before us. The shock of this discovery was overpowering,\nand some time elapsed before I could rally from it. Though Almah's\nlove was sweet beyond expression, and though as the time passed I\nsaw that every jom she regained more and more of her former\nhealth and strength, still I could not forget what had been revealed.\nWe were happy with one another, yet our happiness was clouded, and\namid the brightness of our love there was ever present the dread\nspectre of our appalling doom.\n\nThese feelings, however, grew fainter. Hope is ever ready to arise;\nand I began to think that these people, though given to evil ways,\nwere after all kind-hearted, and might listen to entreaty. Above all,\nthere was the Kohen, so benevolent, so self-denying, so amiable, so\nsympathetic. I could not forget all that he had said during Almah's\nillness, and it seemed more than probable that an appeal to his better\nnature might not be without effect. I said as much to Almah.\n\n\"The Kohen,\" said she; \"why, he can do nothing.\"\n\n\"Why not? He is the chief man here, and ought to have great\ninfluence.\"\n\n\"You don't understand,\" said she, with a sigh. \"The Kohen is the\nlowest and least influential man in the city.\"\n\n\"Why, who are influential if he is not?\" I asked.\n\n\"The paupers,\" said Almah.\n\n\"The paupers!\" I exclaimed, in amazement.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Almah. \"Here among these people the paupers form the most\nhonored, influential, and envied portion of the community.\"\n\nThis was incomprehensible. Almah tried to explain, but to no purpose,\nand I determined to talk to the Kohen.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nTHE KOHEN IS INEXORABLE\n\n\nI determined to talk to the Kohen, and try for myself whether he might\nnot be accessible to pity. This greatest of cannibals might, indeed,\nhave his little peculiarities, I thought, and who has not?--yet at\nbottom he seemed full of tender and benevolent feeling; and as he\nevidently spent his whole time in the endeavor to make us happy, it\nseemed not unlikely that he might do something for our happiness in a\ncase where our very existence was at stake.\n\nThe Kohen listened with deep attention as I stated my case. I did this\nfully and frankly. I talked of my love for Almah and of Almah's love\nfor me; our hope that we might be united so as to live happily in\nreciprocal affection; and I was going on to speak of the dread that\nwas in my heart when he interrupted me:\n\n\"You speak of being united,\" said he. \"You talk strangely. Of course\nyou mean that you wish to be separated.\"\n\n\"Separated!\" I exclaimed. \"What do you mean? Of course we wish to be\nunited.\"\n\nThe Kohen stared at me as I said this with the look of one who was\nquite puzzled; and I then went on to speak of the fate that was before\nus, and to entreat his sympathy and his aid that we might be saved\nfrom so hideous a doom. To all these words the Kohen listened with an\nair of amazement, as though I were saying incomprehensible things.\n\n\"You have a gentle and an affectionate nature,\" I said--\"a nature full\nof sympathy with others, and noble self-denial.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said the Kohen, quickly, as though glad to get hold of\nsomething which he could understand, \"of course we are all so, for we\nare so made. It is our nature. Who is there who is not self-denying?\nNo one can help that.\"\n\nThis sounded strange indeed; but I did not care to criticize it. I\ncame to my purpose direct and said,\n\n\"Save us from our fate.\"\n\n\"Your fate?\"\n\n\"Yes, from death--that death of horror.\"\n\n\"Death?--horror? What do you mean by horror?\" said the Kohen, in an\namazement that was sincere and unfeigned. \"I cannot comprehend your\nmeaning. It seems as though you actually dislike death; but that is\nnot conceivable. It cannot be possible that you fear death.\"\n\n\"Fear death!\" I exclaimed, \"I do--I do. Who is there that does not\nfear it?\"\n\nThe Kohen stared.\n\n\"I do not understand you,\" he said.\n\n\"Do you not understand,\" said I, \"that death is abhorrent to\nhumanity?\"\n\n\"Abhorrent!\" said the Kohen; \"that is impossible. Is it not the\nhighest blessing? Who is there that does not long for death? Death is\nthe greatest blessing, the chief desire of man--the highest aim. And\nyou--are you not to be envied in having your felicity so near? above\nall, in having such a death as that which is appointed for you--so\nnoble, so sublime? You must be mad; your happiness has turned your\nhead.\"\n\nAll this seemed like hideous mockery, and I stared at the Kohen with a\ngaze that probably strengthened his opinion of my madness.\n\n\"Do you love death?\" I asked at length, in amazement.\n\n\"Love death? What a question! Of course I love death--all men do; who\ndoes not? Is it not human nature? Do we not instinctively fly to meet\nit whenever we can? Do we not rush into the jaws of sea-monsters, or\nthrow ourselves within their grasp? Who does not feel within him this\nintense longing after death as the strongest passion of his heart?\"\n\n\"I don't know--I don't know,\" said I. \"You are of a different race; I\ndo not understand what you say. But I belong to a race that fears\ndeath. I fear death and love life; and I entreat you, I implore you to\nhelp me now in my distress, and assist me so that I may save my life\nand that of Almah.\"\n\n\"I--I help you!\" said the Kohen, in new amazement. \"Why do you come to\nme--to me, of all men? Why, I am nothing here. And help you to\nlive--to live! Who ever heard of such a thing?\"\n\nAnd the Kohen looked at me with the same astonishment which I should\nevince if a man should ask me to help him to die.\n\nStill, I persisted in my entreaty for his help.\n\n\"Such a request,\" said he, \"is revolting; you must be mad. Such a\nrequest outrages all the instincts of humanity. And even if I could do\nsuch violence to my own nature as to help you to such a thing, how do\nyou think I could face my fellow-men, or how could I endure the\nterrible punishment which would fall upon me?\"\n\n\"Punishment!\" said I. \"What! would you be punished?\"\n\n\"Punished!\" said the Kohen. \"That, of course, would be inevitable. I\nshould be esteemed an unnatural monster and the chief of criminals. My\nlot in life now is painful enough; but in this case my punishment\nwould involve me in evils without end. Riches would be poured upon me;\nI should be raised to the rank of Kohen Gadol; I should be removed\nfarther away than ever from the pauper class--so far, indeed, that all\nhope in life would be over. I should be made the first and noblest and\nrichest in all the land.\"\n\nHe spoke these words just as if he had said, \"the lowest, meanest,\npoorest, and most infamous.\" It sounded like fresh mockery, and I\ncould not believe but that he was amusing himself at my expense.\n\n\"This is cruel,\" said I. \"You are mocking me.\"\n\n\"Cruel?--cruel?\" said he; \"what is cruel? You mean that such a fate\nwould be cruel for me.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said I; \"but alas! I see we cannot understand one another.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the Kohen, musingly, as he looked at me. \"No, it seems not;\nbut tell me, Atam-or, is it possible that you really fear death--that\nyou really love life?\"\n\n\"Fear death!--love life!\" I cried. \"Who does not? Who can help it? Why\ndo you ask me that?\"\n\nThe Kohen clasped his hands in amazement.\n\n\"If you really fear death,\" said he, \"what possible thing is there\nleft to love or to hope for? What, then, do you think the highest\nblessing of man?\"\n\n\"Long life,\" said I, \"and riches and requited love.\"\n\nAt this the Kohen started back, and stared at me as though I were a\nraving madman.\n\n\"Oh, holy shades of night!\" he exclaimed. \"What is that you say? What\ndo you mean?\"\n\n\"We can never understand one another, I fear,\" said I. \"The love of\nlife must necessarily be the strongest passion of man. We are so made.\nWe give up everything for life. A long life is everywhere considered\nas the highest blessing; and there is no one who is willing to die, no\nmatter what his suffering may be. Riches also are desired by all, for\npoverty is the direst curse that can embitter life; and as to requited\nlove, surely that is the sweetest, purest, and most divine joy that\nthe human heart may know.\"\n\nAt this the Kohen burst forth in a strain of high excitement:\n\n\"Oh, sacred cavern gloom! Oh, divine darkness! Oh, impenetrable\nabysses of night! What, oh, what is this! Oh, Atam-or, are you mad?\nAlas! it must be so. Joy has turned your brain; you are quite\ndemented. You call good evil, and evil good; our light is your\ndarkness, and our darkness your light. Yet surely you cannot be\naltogether insane. Come, come, let us look further. How is it! Try now\nto recall your reason. A long life--a life, and a long one! Surely\nthere can be no human being in a healthy state of nature who wishes to\nprolong his life; and as to riches, it is possible that anyone exists\nwho really and honestly desires riches? Impossible! And requited love!\nOh, Atam-or, you are mad to-day! You are always strange, but now you\nhave quite taken leave of your senses. I cannot but love you, and yet\nI can never understand you. Tell me, and tell me truly, what is it\nthat you consider evils, if these things that you have mentioned are\nnot the very worst?\"\n\nHe seemed deeply in earnest and much moved. I could not understand\nhim, but could only answer his questions with simple conciseness.\n\n\"Poverty, sickness, and death,\" said I, \"are evils; but the worst of\nall evils is unrequited love.\"\n\nAt these words the Kohen made a gesture of despair.\n\n\"It is impossible to understand this,\" said he. \"You talk calmly; you\nhave not the air of a madman. If your fellow-countrymen are all like\nyou, then your race is an incomprehensible one. Why, death is the\ngreatest blessing. We all long for it; it is the end of our being. As\nfor riches, they are a curse, abhorred by all. Above all, as to love,\nwe shrink from the thought of requital. Death is our chief blessing,\npoverty our greatest happiness, and unrequited love the sweetest lot\nof man.\"\n\nAll this sounded like the ravings of a lunatic, yet the Kohen was not\nmad. It seemed also like the mockery of some teasing demon; but the\ngentle and self-denying Kohen was no teasing demon, and mockery with\nhim was impossible. I was therefore more bewildered than ever at this\nreiteration of sentiments that were so utterly incomprehensible. He,\non the other hand, seemed as astonished at my sentiments and as\nbewildered, and we could find no common ground on which to meet.\n\n\"I remember now,\" said the Kohen, in a musing tone, \"having heard of\nsome strange folk at the Amir, who profess to feel as you say you\nfeel, but no one believes that they are in earnest; for although they\nmay even bring themselves to think that they are in earnest in their\nprofessions, yet after all everyone thinks that they are\nself-deceived. For you see, in the first place, these feelings which\nyou profess are utterly unnatural. We are so made that we cannot help\nloving death; it is a sort of instinct. We are also created in such a\nway that we cannot help longing after poverty. The pauper must always,\namong all men, be the most envied of mortals. Nature, too, has made us\nsuch that the passion of love, when it arises, is so vehement, so\nall-consuming that it must always struggle to avoid requital. This is\nthe reason why, when two people find that they love each other, they\nalways separate and avoid one another for the rest of their lives.\nThis is human nature. We cannot help it; and it is this that\ndistinguishes us from the animals. Why, if men were to feel as you say\nyou feel, they would be mere animals. Animals fear death; animals love\nto accumulate such things as they prize; animals, when they love, go\nin pairs, and remain with one another. But man, with his intellect,\nwould not be man if he loved life and desired riches and sought for\nrequited love.\"\n\nI sank back in despair. \"You cannot mean all this,\" I said.\n\nHe threw at me a piteous glance. \"What else can you believe or feel?\"\nsaid he.\n\n\"The very opposite. We are so made that we hate and fear death; to us\nhe is the King of Terrors. Poverty is terrible also, since it is\nassociated with want and woe; it is, therefore, natural to man to\nstrive after riches. As to the passion of love, that is so vehement\nthat the first and only thought is requital. Unrequited love is\nanguish beyond expression--anguish so severe that the heart will often\nbreak under it.\"\n\nThe Kohen clasped his hands in new bewilderment.\n\n\"I cannot understand,\" said he. \"A madman might imagine that he loved\nlife and desired riches; but as to love, why even a madman could not\nthink of requital, for the very nature of the passion of love is the\nmost utter self-surrender, and a shrinking from all requital;\nwherefore, the feeling that leads one to desire requital cannot be\nlove. I do not know what it can be--indeed, I never heard of such a\nthing before, and the annals of the human race make no mention of such\na feeling. For what is love? It is the ardent outflow of the whole\nbeing--the yearning of one human heart to lavish all its treasures\nupon another. Love is more than self-denial; it is self-surrender and\nutter self-abnegation. Love gives all away, and cannot possibly\nreceive anything in return. A requital of love would mean selfishness,\nwhich would be self-contradiction. The more one loves, the more he\nmust shrink from requital.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried I, \"among you do lovers never marry?\"\n\n\"Lovers marry? Never!\"\n\n\"Do married people never love one another?\"\n\nThe Kohen shook his head.\n\n\"It unfortunately sometimes happens so,\" said he, \"and then the result\nis, of course, distressing. For the children's sake the parents will\noften remain with one another, but in many cases they separate. No one\ncan tell the misery that ensues where a husband and wife love one\nanother.\"\n\nThe conversation grew insupportable. I could not follow the Kohen in\nwhat seemed the wildest and maddest flights of fancy that ever were\nknown; so I began to talk of other things, and gradually the Kohen was\ndrawn to speak of his own life. The account which he gave of himself\nwas not one whit less strange than his previous remarks, and for this\nreason I add it here.\n\n\"I was born,\" said he, \"in the most enviable of positions. My father\nand mother were among the poorest in the land. Both died when I was a\nchild, and I never saw them. I grew up in the open fields and public\ncaverns, along with the most esteemed paupers. But, unfortunately for\nme, there was something wanting in my natural disposition. I loved\ndeath, of course, and poverty, too, very strongly; but I did not have\nthat eager and energetic passion which is so desirable, nor was I\nwatchful enough over my blessed estate of poverty. Surrounded as I was\nby those who were only too ready to take advantage of my ignorance or\nwant of vigilance, I soon fell into evil ways, and gradually, in spite\nof myself, I found wealth pouring in upon me. Designing men succeeded\nin winning my consent to receive their possessions; and so I gradually\nfell away from that lofty position in which I was born. I grew richer\nand richer. My friends warned me, but in vain. I was too weak to\nresist; in fact, I lacked moral fibre, and had never learned how to\nsay 'No.' So I went on, descending lower and lower in the scale of\nbeing. I became a capitalist, an Athon, a general officer, and finally\nKohen.\n\n\"At length, on one eventful day, I learned that one of my associates\nhad by a long course of reckless folly become the richest man in all\nthe country. He had become Athon, Melek, and at last Kohen Gadol. It\nwas a terrible shock, but I trust a salutary one. I at once resolved\nto reform. That resolution I have steadily kept, and have at least\nsaved myself from descending any lower. It is true, I can hardly hope\nto become what I once was. It is only too easy to grow rich; and, you\nknow, poverty once forfeited can never return except in rare\ninstances. I have, however, succeeded in getting rid of most of my\nwealth, chiefly through the fortunate advent of Almah and afterward of\nyourself. This, I confess, has been my salvation. Neither of you had\nany scruples about accepting what was bestowed, and so I did not feel\nas though I was doing you any wrong in giving you all I had in the\nworld. Most of the people of this city have taken advantage of your\nextraordinary indifference to wealth, and have made themselves paupers\nat your expense. I had already become your slave, and had received the\npromise of being elevated to the rank of scullion in the cavern of the\nMista Kosek. But now, since this event of your love for Almah, I\nhope to gain far more. I am almost certain of being made a pauper, and\nI think I can almost venture to hope some day for the honor of a\npublic death.\"\n\nTo such a story I had nothing to say. It was sheer madness; yet it was\nterribly suggestive, and showed how utterly hopeless was my effort to\nsecure the assistance of such a man toward my escape from death.\n\n\"A public death!\" I said, grimly. \"That will be very fortunate! And do\nyou think that you will gain the dignity of being eaten up afterward?\"\n\nThe Kohen shook his head in all seriousness.\n\n\"Oh no,\" said he; \"that would be far beyond my deserts. That is an\nhonor which is only bestowed upon the most distinguished.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nTHE KOSEKIN\n\n\nThese people call themselves the Kosekin. Their chief characteristic,\nor, at least, their most prominent one, is their love of darkness,\nwhich perhaps is due to their habit of dwelling in caves. Another\nfeeling, equally strong and perhaps connected with this, is their love\nof death and dislike of life. This is visible in many ways, and\naffects all their character. It leads to a passionate self-denial, an\nincessant effort to benefit others at their own expense. Each one\nhates life and longs for death. He, therefore, hates riches, and all\nthings that are associated with life.\n\nAmong the Kosekin everyone makes perpetual efforts to serve others,\nwhich, however, are perpetually baffled by the unselfishness of these\nothers. People thus spend years in trying to overreach one another, so\nas to make others richer than themselves. In a race each one tries to\nkeep behind; but as this leads to confusion, there is then a universal\neffort for each one to be first, so as to put his neighbor in the\nhonorable position of the rear. It is the same way in a hunt. Each one\npresses forward, so as to honor his companion by leaving him behind.\nInstead of injuring, everyone tries to benefit his neighbor. When one\nhas been benefited by another, he is filled with a passion which may\nbe called Kosekin revenge--namely, a sleepless and vehement desire to\nbestow some adequate and corresponding benefit on the other. Feuds\nare thus kept up among families and wars among nations. For no one is\nwilling to accept from another any kindness, any gift, or any honor,\nand all are continually on the watch to prevent themselves from being\noverreached in this way. Those who are less watchful than others are\noverwhelmed with gifts by designing men, who wish to attain to the\npauper class. The position of Almah and myself illustrates this. Our\nignorance of the blessings and honors of poverty led us to receive\nwhatever was offered us. Taking advantage of our innocence and\nignorance, the whole city thereupon proceeded to bestow their property\nupon us, and all became paupers through our fortunate arrival.\n\nNo one ever injures another unless by accident, and when this occurs\nit affords the highest joy to the injured party. He has now a claim on\nthe injurer; he gets him into his power, is able to confer benefits on\nhim and force upon him all that he wishes. The unhappy injurer, thus\npunished by the reception of wealth, finds himself helpless; and where\nthe injury is great, the injured man may bestow upon the other all his\nwealth and attain to the envied condition of a pauper.\n\nAmong the Kosekin the sick are objects of the highest regard. All\nclasses vie with one another in their attentions. The rich send their\nluxuries; the paupers, however, not having anything to give, go\nthemselves and wait on them and nurse them. For this there is no help,\nand the rich grumble, but can do nothing. The sick are thus sought out\nincessantly, and most carefully tended. When they die there is great\nrejoicing, since death is a blessing; but the nurses labor hard to\npreserve them in life, so as to prolong the enjoyment of the high\nprivilege of nursing. Of all sick the incurable are most honored,\nsince they require nursing always. Children also are highly honored\nand esteemed, and the aged too, since both classes require the care of\nothers and must be the recipients of favors which all are anxious to\nbestow. Those who suffer from contagious diseases are more sought\nafter than any other class, for in waiting on these there is the\nchance of gaining the blessing of death; indeed, in these cases much\ntrouble is usually experienced from the rush of those who insist on\noffering their services.\n\nFor it must never be forgotten that the Kosekin love death as we love\nlife; and this accounts for all those ceremonies which to me were so\nabhorrent, especially the scenes of the Mista Kosek. To them a dead\nhuman body is no more than the dead body of a bird: there is no awe\nfelt, no sense of sanctity, of superstitious horror; and so I learned,\nwith a shudder, that the hate of life is a far worse thing than the\nfear of death. This desire for death is, then, a master-passion, and\nis the key to all their words and acts. They rejoice over the death of\nfriends, since those friends have gained the greatest of blessings;\nthey rejoice also at the birth of children, since those who are born\nwill one day gain the bliss of death.\n\nFor a couple to fall in love is the signal for mutual self-surrender.\nEach insists on giving up the loved one; and the more passionate the\nlove is, the more eager is the desire to have the loved one married to\nsomeone else. Lovers have died broken-hearted from being compelled to\nmarry one another. Poets here among the Kosekin celebrate unhappy love\nwhich has met with this end. These poets also celebrate defeats\ninstead of victories, since it is considered glorious for one nation\nto sacrifice itself to another; but to this there are important\nlimitations, as we shall see. Poets also celebrate street-sweepers,\nscavengers, lamp-lighters, laborers, and above all, paupers, and pass\nby as unworthy of notice the authors, Meleks, and Kohens of the land.\n\nThe paupers here form the most honorable class. Next to these are the\nlaborers. These have strikes as with us; but it is always for harder\nwork, longer hours, or smaller pay. The contest between capital and\nlabor rages, but the conditions are reversed; for the grumbling\ncapitalist complains that the laborer will not take as much pay as he\nought to while the laborer thinks the capitalist too persistent in his\nefforts to force money upon him.\n\nHere among the Kosekin the wealthy class forms the mass of the people,\nwhile the aristocratic few consist of the paupers. These are greatly\nenvied by the others, and have many advantages. The cares and burdens\nof wealth, as well as wealth itself, are here considered a curse, and\nfrom all these the paupers are exempt. There is a perpetual effort on\nthe part of the wealthy to induce the paupers to accept gifts, just\nas among us the poor try to rob the rich. Among the wealthy there is\na great and incessant murmur at the obstinacy of the paupers. Secret\nmovements are sometimes set on foot which aim at a redistribution of\nproperty and a levelling of all classes, so as to reduce the haughty\npaupers to the same condition as the mass of the nation. More than\nonce there has been a violent attempt at a revolution, so as to force\nwealth on the paupers; but as a general thing these movements have\nbeen put down and their leaders severely punished. The paupers have\nshown no mercy in their hour of triumph; they have not conceded one\njot to the public demand, and the unhappy conspirators have been\ncondemned to increased wealth and luxury, while the leaders have\nbeen made Meleks and Kohens. Thus there are among the Kosekin the\nunfortunate many who are cursed with wealth, and the fortunate few who\nare blessed with poverty. These walk while the others ride, and from\ntheir squalid huts look proudly and contemptuously upon the palaces of\ntheir unfortunate fellow-countrymen.\n\nThe love of death leads to perpetual efforts on the part of each to\nlay down his life for another. This is a grave difficulty in hunts and\nbattles. Confined prisoners dare not fly, for in such an event the\nguards kill themselves. This leads to fresh rigors in the captivity of\nthe prisoners in case of their recapture, for they are overwhelmed\nwith fresh luxuries and increased splendors. Finally, if a prisoner\npersist and is recaptured, he is solemnly put to death, not, as with\nus, by way of severity, but as the last and greatest honor. Here\nextremes meet; and death, whether for honor or dishonor, is all the\nsame--death--and is reserved for desperate cases. But among the\nKosekin this lofty destiny is somewhat embittered by the agonizing\nthought on the part of the prisoner, who thus gains it, that his\nwretched family must be doomed, not, as with us, to poverty and want,\nbut, on the contrary, to boundless wealth and splendor.\n\nAmong so strange a people it seemed singular to me what offences could\npossibly be committed which could be regarded and punished as crimes.\nThese, however, I soon found out. Instead of robbers, the Kosekin\npunished the secret bestowers of their wealth on others. This is\nregarded as a very grave offence. Analogous to our crime of piracy\nis the forcible arrest of ships at sea and the transfer to them of\nvaluables. Sometimes the Kosekin pirates give themselves up as slaves.\nKidnapping, assault, highway robbery, and crimes of violence have\ntheir parallel here in cases where a strong man, meeting a weaker,\nforces himself upon him as his slave or compels him to take his purse.\nIf the weaker refuse, the assailant threatens to kill himself, which\nact would lay the other under obligations to receive punishment from\nthe state in the shape of gifts and honors, or at least subject him\nto unpleasant inquiries. Murder has its counterpart among the Kosekin\nin cases where one man meets another, forces money on him, and kills\nhimself. Forgery occurs where one uses another's name so as to confer\nmoney on him.\n\nThere are many other crimes, all of which are severely punished. The\nworse the offence is, the better is the offender treated. Among the\nKosekin capital punishment is imprisonment amid the greatest splendor,\nwhere the prisoner is treated like a king, and has many palaces and\ngreat retinues; for that which we consider the highest they regard as\nthe lowest, and with them the chief post of honor is what we would\ncall the lowest menial office. Of course, among such a people, any\nsuffering from want is unknown, except when it is voluntary. The\npauper class, with all their great privileges, have this restriction,\nthat they are forced to receive enough for food and clothing. Some,\nindeed, manage by living in out-of-the-way places to deprive\nthemselves of these, and have been known to die of starvation; but\nthis is regarded as dishonorable, as taking an undue advantage of a\ngreat position, and where it can be proved, the children and relatives\nof the offender are severely punished according to the Kosekin\nfashion.\n\nState politics here move, like individual affairs, upon the great\nprinciple of contempt for earthly things. The state is willing to\ndestroy itself for the good of other states; but as other states are\nin the same position, nothing can result. In times of war the object\nof each army is to honor the other and benefit it by giving it the\nglory of defeat. The contest is thus most fierce. The Kosekin, through\ntheir passionate love of death, are terrible in battle; and when they\nare also animated by the desire to confer glory on their enemies by\ndefeating them, they generally succeed in their aim. This makes them\nalmost always victorious, and when they are not so not a soul returns\nalive. Their state of mind is peculiar. If they are defeated they\nrejoice, since defeat is their chief glory; but if they are victorious\nthey rejoice still more in the benevolent thought that they have\nconferred upon the enemy the joy, the glory, and the honor of defeat.\n\nHere all shrink from governing others. The highest wish of each is to\nserve. The Meleks and Kohens, whom I at first considered the highest,\nare really the lowest orders; next to these come the authors, then the\nmerchants, then farmers, then artisans, then laborers, and, finally,\nthe highest rank is reached in the paupers. Happy the aristocratic,\nthe haughty, the envied paupers! The same thing is seen in their\narmies. The privates here are highest in rank, and the officers come\nnext in different graduations. These officers, however, have the\ncommand and the charge of affairs as with us; yet this is consistent\nwith their position, for here to obey is considered nobler than to\ncommand. In the fleet the rowers are the highest class; next come the\nfighting-men; and lowest of all are the officers. War arises from\nmotives as peculiar as those which give rise to private feuds; as, for\ninstance, where one nation tries to force a province upon another;\nwhere they try to make each other greater; where they try to benefit\nunduly each other's commerce; where one may have a smaller fleet or\narmy than has been agreed on, or where an ambassador has been\npresented with gifts, or received too great honor or attention.\n\nIn such a country as this, where riches are disliked and despised, I\ncould not imagine how people could be induced to engage in trade.\nThis, however, was soon explained. The laborers and artisans have to\nperform their daily work, so as to enable the community to live and\nmove and have its being. Their impelling motive is the high one of\nbenefiting others most directly. They refuse anything but the very\nsmallest pay, and insist on giving for this the utmost possible labor.\nTradesmen also have to supply the community with articles of all\nsorts; merchants have to sail their ships to the same end--all being\nanimated by the desire of effecting the good of others. Each one tries\nnot to make money, but to lose it; but as the competition is sharp and\nuniversal, this is difficult, and the larger portion are unsuccessful.\nThe purchasers are eager to pay as much as possible, and the merchants\nand traders grow rich in spite of their utmost endeavors. The wealthy\nclasses go into business so as to lose money, but in this they seldom\nsucceed. It has been calculated that only two per cent in every\ncommunity succeed in reaching the pauper class. The tendency is for\nall the labors of the working-class to be ultimately turned upon the\nunfortunate wealthy class. The workmen being the creators of wealth,\nand refusing to take adequate pay, cause a final accumulation of the\nwealth of the community in the hands of the mass of the non-producers,\nwho thus are fixed in their unhappy position, and can hope for no\nescape except by death. The farmers till the ground, the fishermen\nfish, the laborers toil, and the wealth thus created is pushed from\nthese incessantly till it all falls upon the lowest class--namely, the\nrich, including Athons, Meleks, and Kohens. It is a burden that is\noften too heavy to be borne; but there is no help for it, and the\nbetter-minded seek to cultivate resignation.\n\nWomen and men are in every respect absolutely equal, holding precisely\nthe same offices and doing the same work. In general, however, it is\nobserved that women are a little less fond of death than men, and a\nlittle less unwilling to receive gifts. For this reason they are very\nnumerous among the wealthy class, and abound in the offices of\nadministration. Women serve in the army and navy as well as men, and\nfrom their lack of ambition or energetic perseverance they are usually\nrelegated to the lower ranks, such as officers and generals. To my\nmind it seemed as though the women were in all the offices of honor\nand dignity, but in reality it was the very opposite. The same is true\nin the family. The husbands insist on giving everything to the wives\nand doing everything for them. The wives are therefore universally the\nrulers of the household while the husbands have an apparently\nsubordinate, but, to the Kosekin, a more honorable position.\n\nAs to the religion of the Kosekin, I could make nothing of it. They\nbelieve that after death they go to what they call the world of\ndarkness. The death they long for leads to the darkness that they\nlove; and the death and the darkness are eternal. Still, they persist\nin saying that the death and the darkness together form a state of\nbliss. They are eloquent about the happiness that awaits them there in\nthe sunless land--the world of darkness; but for my own part, it\nalways seemed to me a state of nothingness.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nBELIEF AND UNBELIEF\n\n\nThe doctor was here interrupted by Featherstone, who, with a yawn,\ninformed him that it was eleven o'clock, and that human endurance had\nits limits. Upon this the doctor rolled up the manuscript and put it\naside for the night, after which supper was ordered.\n\n\"Well,\" said Featherstone, \"what do you think of this last?\"\n\n\"It contains some very remarkable statements,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"There are certainly monsters enough in it,\" said Melick--\n\n  \"'Gorgons, and hydras, and chimeras dire.'\"\n\n\"Well, why not?\" said the doctor.\n\n\"It seems to me,\" said Melick, \"that the writer of this has peopled\nhis world with creatures that resemble the fossil animals more than\nanything else.\"\n\n\"The so-called fossil animals,\" said the doctor, \"may not be extinct.\nThere are fossil specimens of animals that still have living\nrepresentatives. There is no reason why many of those supposed to be\nextinct may not be alive now. It is well known that many very\nremarkable animals have become extinct within a comparatively recent\nperiod. These great birds, of which More speaks, seem to me to belong\nto these classes. The dodo was in existence fifty years ago, the moa\nabout a hundred years ago. These great birds, together with others,\nsuch as the epiornis and palapteryx, have disappeared, not through the\nordinary course of nature, but by the hand of man. Even in our\nhemisphere they may yet be found. Who can tell but that the moa or the\ndodo may yet be lurking somewhere here in the interior of Madagascar,\nof Borneo, or of Papua?\"\n\n\"Can you make out anything about those great birds?\" asked\nFeatherstone. \"Do they resemble anything that exists now, or has ever\nexisted?\"\n\n\"Well, yes, I think so,\" said the doctor. \"Unfortunately, More is not\nat all close or accurate in his descriptions; he has a decidedly\nunscientific mind, and so one cannot feel sure; yet from his general\nstatements I think I can decide pretty nearly upon the nature and the\nscientific name of each one of his birds and animals. It is quite\nevident to me that most of these animals belong to races that no\nlonger exist among us, and that this world at the South Pole has many\ncharacteristics which are like those of what is known as the Coal\nPeriod. I allude in particular to the vast forests of fern, of\ngigantic grasses and reeds. At the same time the general climate and\nthe atmosphere seem like what we may find in the tropics at present.\nIt is evident that in More's world various epochs are represented, and\nthat animals of different ages are living side by side.\"\n\n\"What do you think of the opkuk?\" asked Featherstone, with a yawn.\n\n\"Well, I hardly know.\"\n\n\"Why, it must be a dodo, of course,\" said Melick, \"only magnified.\"\n\n\"That,\" said the doctor, gravely, \"is a thought that naturally\nsuggests itself; but then the opkuk is certainly far larger than the\ndodo.\"\n\n\"Oh, More put on his magnifying-glasses just then.\"\n\n\"The dodo,\" continued the doctor, taking no notice of this, \"in other\nrespects corresponds with More's description of the opkuk. Clusius and\nBontius give good descriptions and there is a well-known picture of\none in the British Museum. It is a massive, clumsy bird, ungraceful in\nits form with heavy movements, wings too short for flight, little or\nno tail, and down rather than feathers. The body, according to\nBontius, is as big as that of the African ostrich, but the legs are\nvery short. It has a large head, great black eyes, long bluish-white\nbill, ending in a beak like that of a vulture, yellow legs, thick and\nshort, four toes on each foot solid, long, and armed with sharp black\nclaws. The flesh particularly on the breast, is fat and esculent. Now,\nall this corresponds with More's account, except as to the size of the\ntwo, for the opkuks are as large as oxen.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's nothing,\" said Melick; \"I'm determined to stand up for the\ndodo.\" With this he burst forth singing--\n\n  \"Oh, the dodo once lived, but he doesn't live now;\n   Yet why should a cloud overshadow our brow?\n   The loss of that bird ne'er should trouble our brains,\n   For though he is gone, still our claret remains.\n       Sing do-do--jolly do-do!\n   Hurrah! in his name let our cups overflow.\"\n\n\"As for your definition, doctor,\" continued Melick, \"I'll give you one\nworth a dozen of yours:\n\n  \"'Twas a mighty bird; those strong, short legs were never known to fail,\n    And he felt a glory of pride while thinking of that little tail,\n    And his beak was marked with vigor, curving like a wondrous hook;\n    Thick and ugly was his body--such a form as made one look!\"\n\n\"Melick,\" said Featherstone, \"you're a volatile youth. You mustn't\nmind him, doctor. He's a professional cynic, sceptic, and scoffer.\nOxenden and I, however, are open to conviction, and want to know more\nabout those birds and beasts. Can you make anything out of the\nopmahera?\"\n\nThe doctor swallowed a glass of wine, and replied:\n\n\"Oh yes; there are many birds, each of which may be the opmahera.\nThere's the fossil bird of Massachusetts, of which nothing is left but\nthe footprints; but some of these are eighteen inches in length, and\nshow a stride of two yards. The bird belonged to the order of the\nGrallae, and may have been ten or twelve feet in height. Then there\nis the Gastornis parisiensis, which was as tall as an ostrich, as\nbig as an ox, and belongs to the same order as the other. Then there\nis the Palapteryx, of which remains have been found in New Zealand,\nwhich was seven or eight feet in height. But the one which to my mind\nis the real counterpart of the opmahera is the Dinornis gigantea,\nwhose remains are also found in New Zealand. It is the largest bird\nknown, with long legs, a long neck, and short wings, useless for\nflight. One specimen that has been found is upward of thirteen feet in\nheight. There is no reason why some should not have been much taller.\nMore compares its height to that of a giraffe. The Maoris call this\nbird the Moa, and their legends and traditions are full of mention\nof it. When they first came to the island, six or seven hundred years\nago, they found these vast birds everywhere, and hunted them for food.\nTo my mind the dinornis is the opmahera of More. As to riding on them,\nthat is likely enough; for ostriches are used for this purpose, and\nthe dinornis must have been far stronger and fleeter than the ostrich.\nIt is possible that some of these birds may still be living in the\nremoter parts of our hemisphere.\"\n\n\"What about those monsters,\" asked Featherstone, \"that More speaks of\nin the sacred hunt?\"\n\n\"I think,\" said the doctor, \"that I understand pretty well what they\nwere, and can identify them all. As the galley passed the estuary\nof that great river, you remember that he mentions seeing them on\nthe shore. One may have been the Ichthyosaurus. This, as the name\nimplies, is a fish-lizard. It has the head of a lizard, the snout of\na dolphin, the teeth of an alligator, enormous eyes, whose membrane\nis strengthened by a bony frame, the vertebrae of fishes, sternum and\nshoulder-bones like those of the lizard, and the fins of a whale.\nBayle calls it the whale of the saurians. Another may have been the\nCheirotherium. On account of the hand-shaped marks made by its paws,\nOwen thinks that it was akin to the frogs; but it was a formidable\nmonster, with head and jaws of a crocodile. Another may have been the\nTeleosaurus, which resembled our alligators. It was thirty-five feet\nin length. Then there was the Hylaeosaurus, a monster twenty-five\nfeet in length, with a cuirass of bony plates.\"\n\n\"But none of these correspond with More's description of the monster\nthat fought with the galley.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the doctor, \"I am coming to that now. That monster could\nhave been no other than the Plesiosaurus, one of the most wonderful\nanimals that has ever existed. Imagine a thing with the head of a\nlizard, the teeth of a crocodile, the neck of a swan, the trunk and\ntail of a quadruped, and the fins of a whale. Imagine a whale with its\nhead and neck consisting of a serpent, with the strength of the former\nand the malignant fury of the latter, and then you will have the\nplesiosaurus. It was an aquatic animal, yet it had to remain near or\non the surface of the water, while its long, serpent-like neck enabled\nit to reach its prey above or below with swift, far-reaching darts.\nYet it had no armor, and could not have been at all a match for the\nichthyosaurus. More's account shows, however, that it was a fearful\nenemy for man to encounter.\"\n\n\"He seems to have been less formidable than that beast which they\nencountered in the swamp. Have you any idea what that was?\"\n\n\"I think it can have been no other than the Iguanodon,\" said the\ndoctor. \"The remains of this animal show that it must have been the\nmost gigantic of all primeval saurians. Judging from existing remains\nits length was not less than sixty feet, and larger ones may have\nexisted. It stood high on its legs; the hind ones were larger than the\nfore. The feet were massive and armed with tremendous claws. It lived\non the land and fed on herbage. It had a horny, spiky ridge all along\nits back. Its tail was nearly as long as its body. Its head was short,\nits jaws enormous, furnished with teeth of a very elaborate structure,\nand on its muzzle it carried a curved horn. Such a beast as this might\nwell have caused all that destruction of life on the part of his\ndesperate assailants of which More speaks.\n\n\"Then there was another animal,\" continued the doctor, who was\nevidently discoursing upon a favorite topic. \"It was the one that came\nsuddenly upon More while he was resting with Almah after his flight\nwith the run-away bird. That I take to be the Megalosaurus. This\nanimal was a monster of tremendous size and strength. Cuvier thought\nthat it might have been seventy feet in length. It was carnivorous,\nand therefore more ferocious than the iguanodon, and more ready to\nattack. Its head was like that of a crocodile, its body massive like\nthat of an elephant, yet larger; its tail was small, and it stood high\non its legs, so that it could run with great speed. It was not covered\nwith bony armor, but had probably a hide thick enough to serve the\npurpose of shell or bone. Its teeth were constructed so as to cut with\ntheir edges, and the movement of the jaws produced the combined effect\nof knife and saw, while their inward curve rendered impossible the\nescape of prey that had once been caught. It probably frequented\nthe river banks, where it fed upon reptiles of smaller size which\ninhabited the same places.\n\n\"More,\" continued the doctor, \"is too general in his descriptions. He\nhas not a scientific mind, and he gives but few data; yet I can bring\nbefore myself very easily all the scenes which he describes,\nparticularly that one in which the megalosaurus approaches, and he\nrushes to mount the dinoris so as to escape. I see that river, with\nits trees and shrubs, all unknown now except in museums--the\nvegetation of the Coal Period--the lepidodendron, the lepidostrobus,\nthe pecopteris, the neuropteris, the lonchopteris, the odontopteris,\nthe sphenopteris, the cyclopteris, the sigellaria veniformis, the\nsphenophyllium, the calamites--\"\n\nMelick started to his feet.\n\n\"There, there!\" he cried, \"hold hard, doctor. Talking of calamities,\nwhat greater calamity can there be than such a torrent of unknown\nwords? Talk English, doctor, and we shall be able to appreciate you;\nbut to make your jokes, your conundrums, and your brilliant witticisms\nin a foreign language isn't fair to us, and does no credit either to\nyour head or your heart.\"\n\nThe doctor elevated his eyebrows, and took no notice of Melick's\nill-timed levity.\n\n\"All these stories of strange animals,\" said Oxenden, \"may be very\ninteresting, doctor, but I must say that I am far more struck by\nthe account of the people themselves. I wonder whether they are an\naboriginal race, or descendants of the same stock from which we came?\"\n\n\"I should say,\" remarked the doctor, confidently, \"that they are,\nbeyond a doubt, an aboriginal and autochthonous race.\"\n\n\"I differ from you altogether,\" said Oxenden, calmly.\n\n\"Oh,\" said the doctor, \"there can be no doubt about it. Their\ncomplexion, small stature, and peculiar eyes--their love of darkness,\ntheir singular characteristics, both physical and moral, all go to\nshow that they can have no connection with the races in our part of\nthe earth.\"\n\n\"Their peculiar eyes,\" said Oxenden, \"are no doubt produced by\ndwelling in caves for many generations.\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" said the doctor, \"it is their peculiarity of eye\nthat makes them dwell in caves.\"\n\n\"You are mistaking the cause for the effect, doctor.\"\n\n\"Not at all; it is you who are making that mistake.\"\n\n\"It's the old debate,\" said Melick. \"As the poet has it:\n\n  \"'Which was first, the egg or the hen?\n    Tell me, I pray, ye learned men!'\"\n\n\"There are the eyeless fishes of the great cave of Kentucky,\" said\nOxenden, \"whose eyes have become extinct from living in the dark.\"\n\n\"No,\" cried the doctor; \"the fish that have arisen in that lake have\nnever needed eyes, and have never had them.\"\n\nOxenden laughed.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"I'll discuss the question with you on different\ngrounds altogether, and I will show clearly that these men, these\nbearded men, must belong to a stock that is nearly related to our own,\nor, at least, that they belong to a race of men with whom we are all\nvery familiar.\"\n\n\"I should like very much to have you try it,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Oxenden. \"In the first place, I take their\nlanguage.\"\n\n\"Their language!\"\n\n\"Yes. More has given us very many words in their language. Now he\nhimself says that these words had an Arabic sound. He was slightly\nacquainted with that language. What will you say if I tell you that\nthese words are still more like Hebrew?\"\n\n\"Hebrew!\" exclaimed the doctor, in amazement.\n\n\"Yes, Hebrew,\" said Oxenden. \"They are all very much like Hebrew\nwords, and the difference is not greater than that which exists\nbetween the words of any two languages of the Aryan family.\"\n\n\"Oh, if you come to philology I'll throw up the sponge,\" said the\ndoctor. \"Yet I should like to hear what you have to say on that\npoint.\"\n\n\"The languages of the Aryan family,\" said Oxenden, \"have the same\ngeneral characteristics, and in all of them the differences that exist\nin their most common words are subject to the action of a regular law.\nThe action of the law is best seen in the changes which take place in\nthe mutes. These changes are indicated in a summary and comprehensive\nway by means of what is called 'Grimm's Law.' Take Latin and English,\nfor instance. 'Grimm's Law' tells us, among other things, that in\nLatin and in that part of English which is of Teutonic origin, a\nlarge number of words are essentially the same, and differ merely in\ncertain phonetic changes. Take the word 'father.' In Latin, as also\nin Greek, it is 'pater.' Now the Latin 'p' in English becomes 'f;'\nthat is, the thin mute becomes the aspirated mute. The same change\nmay be seen in the Latin 'piscis,' which in English is 'fish,' and\nthe Greek '[pi upsilon rho]' which in English is 'fire.' Again, if the\nLatin or Greek word begins with an aspirate, the English word begins\nwith a medial; thus the Latin 'f' is found responsive to the English\n'b,' as in Latin 'fagus,' English 'beech,' Latin 'fero,' English\n'bear.' Again, if the Latin or Greek has the medial, the English has\nthe thin, as in Latin 'duo,' English 'two,' Latin 'genu,' English\n'knee.' Now, I find that in many of the words which More mentions this\nsame 'Grimm's Law' will apply; and I am inclined to think that if they\nwere spelled with perfect accuracy they would show the same relation\nbetween the Kosekin language and the Hebrew that there is between the\nSaxon English and the Latin.\"\n\nThe doctor gave a heavy sigh.\n\n\"You're out of my depth, Oxenden,\" said he. \"I'm nothing of a\nphilologist.\"\n\n\"By Jove!\" said Featherstone, \"I like this. This is equal to your list\nof the plants of the Coal Period, doctor. But I say, Oxenden, while\nyou are about it, why don't you give us a little dose of Anglo-Saxon\nand Sanscrit? By Jove! the fellow has Bopp by heart, and yet he\nexpects us to argue with him.\"\n\n\"I have it!\" cried Melick. \"The Kosekin are the lost Ten Tribes.\nOxenden is feeling his way to that. He is going to make them out to be\nall Hebrew; and then, of course, the only conclusion will be that they\nare the Ten Tribes, who after a life of strange vicissitudes have\npulled up at the South Pole. It's a wonder More didn't think of\nthat--or the writer of this yarn, whoever he may be. Well, for my\npart, I always took a deep interest in the lost Ten Tribes, and\nthought them a fine body of men.\"\n\n\"Don't think they've got much of the Jew about them,\" said\nFeatherstone, languidly. \"They hate riches and all that, you know.\nBreak a Jew's heart to hear of all that property wasted, and money\ngoing a-begging. Not a bad idea, though, that of theirs about money.\nToo much money's a howwid baw, by Jove!\"\n\n\"Well,\" continued Oxenden, calmly resuming, and taking no notice of\nthese interruptions, \"I can give you word after word that More has\nmentioned which corresponds to a kindred Hebrew word in accordance\nwith 'Grimm's Law.' For instance, Kosekin 'Op,' Hebrew 'Oph;' Kosekin\n'Athon,' Hebrew 'Adon;' Kosekin 'Salon,' Hebrew 'Shalom.' They are\nmore like Hebrew than Arabic, just as Anglo-Saxon words are more like\nLatin or Greek than Sanscrit.\"\n\n\"Hurrah!\" cried Melick, \"we've got him to Sanscrit at last! Now,\nOxenden, my boy, trot out the 'Hitopadesa,' the 'Megha Dhuta,' the\n'Rig Veda.' Quote 'Beowulf' and Caedmon. Gives us a little Zeno, and\nwind up with 'Lalla Rookh' in modern Persian.\"\n\n\"So I conclude,\" said Oxenden, calmly, ignoring Melick, \"that the\nKosekin are a Semitic people. Their complexion and their beards show\nthem to be akin to the Caucasian race, and their language proves\nbeyond the shadow of a doubt that they belong to the Semitic branch of\nthat race. It is impossible for an autochthonous people to have such a\nlanguage.\"\n\n\"But how,\" cried the doctor--\"how in the name of wonder did they get\nto the South Pole?\"\n\n\"Easily enough,\" interrupted Melick--\"Shem landed there from Noah's\nark, and left some of his children to colonize the country. That's as\nplain as a pikestaff. I think, on the whole, that this idea is better\nthan the other one about the Ten Tribes. At any rate they are both\nmine, and I warn all present to keep their hands off them, for on my\nreturn I intend to take out a copyright.\"\n\n\"There's another thing,\" continued Oxenden, \"which is of immense\nimportance, and that is their habit of cave-dwelling. I am inclined to\nthink that they resorted to cave-dwelling at first from some\nhereditary instinct or other, and that their eyes and their whole\nmorals have become affected by this mode of life. Now, as to\nornamented caverns, we have many examples--caverns adorned with a\nsplendor fully equal to anything among the Kosekin. There are in India\nthe great Behar caves, the splendid Karli temple with its magnificent\nsculptures and imposing architecture, and the cavern-temples of\nElephanta; there are the subterranean works in Egypt, the temple of\nDendera in particular; in Petra we have the case of an entire city\nexcavated from the rocky mountains; yet, after all, these do not bear\nupon the point in question, for they are isolated cases; and even\nPetra, though it contained a city, did not contain a nation. But there\nis a case, and one which is well known, that bears directly upon this\nquestion, and gives us the connecting link between the Kosekin and\ntheir Semitic brethren in the northern hemisphere.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" asked the doctor.\n\n\"The Troglodytes,\" said Oxenden, with impressive solemnity.\n\n\"Well, and what do you make out of the Troglodytes?\"\n\n\"I will explain,\" said Oxenden. \"The name Troglodytes is given to\nvarious tribes of men, but those best known and celebrated under this\nname once inhabited the shores of the Red Sea, both on the Arabian and\nthe Egyptian side. They belonged to the Arabian race, and were\nconsequently a Semitic people. Mark that, for it is a point of the\nutmost importance. Now, these Troglodytes all lived in caverns, which\nwere formed partly by art and partly by nature, although art must have\nhad most to do with the construction of such vast subterranean works.\nThey lived in great communities in caverns, and they had long tunnels\npassing from one community to another. Here also they kept their\ncattle. Some of these people have survived even to our own age; for\nBruce, the Abyssinian traveller, saw them in Nubia.\n\n\"The earliest writer who mentions the Troglodytes was Agatharcides, of\nCnidos. According to him they were chiefly herdsmen. Their food was\nthe flesh of cattle, and their drink a mixture of milk and blood. They\ndressed in the skins of cattle; they tattooed their bodies. They were\nvery swift of foot, and were able to run down wild beasts in the hunt.\nThey were also greatly given to robbery, and caravans passing to and\nfro had to guard against them.\n\n\"One feature in their character has to my mind a strange significance,\nand that is their feelings with regard to death. It was not the\nKosekin love of death, yet it was something which must certainly be\nconsidered as approximating to it. For Agatharcides says that in their\nburials they were accustomed to fasten the corpse to a stake, and then\ngathering round, to pelt it with stones amid shouts of laughter and\nwild merriment. They also used to strangle the old and infirm, so as\nto deliver them from the evils of life. These Troglodytes, then, were\na nation of cave-dwellers, loving the dark--not exactly loving death,\nyet at any rate regarding it with merriment and pleasure; and so I\ncannot help seeing a connection between them and the Kosekin.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the doctor, \"but how did they get to the South Pole?\"\n\n\"That,\" said Oxenden, \"is a question which I do not feel bound to\nanswer.\"\n\n\"Oh, it is easy enough to answer that,\" said Melick. \"They, of course,\ndug through the earth.\"\n\nOxenden gave a groan.\n\n\"I think I'll turn in for the night,\" said he, rising. Upon this the\nothers rose also and followed his example.\n\nOn the following morning the calm still continued. None of the party\nrose until very late, and then over the breakfast-table they discussed\nthe manuscript once more, each from his own point of view, Melick\nstill asserting a contemptuous scepticism--Oxenden and the doctor\ngiving reasons for their faith, and Featherstone listening without\nsaying much on either side.\n\nAt length it was proposed to resume the reading of the manuscript,\nwhich task would now devolve upon Oxenden. They adjourned to the deck,\nwhere all disposed themselves in easy attitudes to listen to the\ncontinuation of More's narrative.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nA VOYAGE OVER THE POLE\n\n\nThe discovery of our love had brought a crisis in our fate for me and\nAlmah. The Kohen hailed it with joy, for now was the time when he\nwould be able to present us to the Kohen Gadol. Our doom was certain\nand inevitable. We were to be taken to the amir; we were to be kept\nuntil the end of the dark season, and then we were both to be publicly\nsacrificed. After this our bodies were to be set apart for the hideous\nrites of the Mista Kosek. Such was the fate that lay before us.\n\nThe Kohen was now anxious to take us to the amir. I might possibly\nhave persuaded him to postpone our departure, but I saw no use in\nthat. It seemed better to go, for it was possible that amid new scenes\nand among new people there might be hope. This, too, seemed probable\nto Almah, who was quite anxious to go. The Kohen pressed forward the\npreparations, and at length a galley was ready for us.\n\nThis galley was about three hundred feet in length and fifty in width,\nbut not more than six feet in depth. It was like a long raft. The\nrowers, two hundred in number, sat on a level with the water, one\nhundred on each side. The oars were small, being not more than twelve\nfeet in length, but made of very light, tough material, with very\nbroad blades. The galley was steered with broad-bladed paddles at both\nends. There was no mast or sail. Astern was a light poop, surrounded\nby a pavilion, and forward there was another. At the bow there was\na projecting platform, used chiefly in fighting the thannin, or\nsea-monsters, and also in war. There were no masts or flags or gay\nstreamers; no brilliant colors; all was intensely black, and the\nornaments were of the same hue.\n\nWe were now treated with greater reverence than ever, for we were\nlooked upon as the recipients of the highest honor that could fall to\nany of the Kosekin--namely, the envied dignity of a public death. As\nwe embarked the whole city lined the public ways, and watched us from\nthe quays, from boats, and from other galleys. Songs were sung by a\nchosen choir of paupers, and to the sound of this plaintive strain we\nmoved out to sea.\n\n\"This will be a great journey for me,\" said the Kohen, as we left the\nport. \"I hope to be made a pauper at least, and perhaps gain the honor\nof a public death. I have known people who have gained death for less.\nThere was an Athon last year who attacked a pehmet with forty men\nand one hundred and twenty rowers. All were killed or drowned except\nhimself. In reward for this he gained the mudecheb, or death\nrecompense. In addition to this he was set apart for the Mista Kosek.\"\n\n\"Then, with you, when a man procures the death of others he is\nhonored?\"\n\n\"Why, yes; how could it be otherwise?\" said the Kohen. \"Is it not the\nsame with you? Have you not told me incredible things about your\npeople, among which there were a few that seemed natural and\nintelligible? Among these was your system of honoring above all men\nthose who procure the death of the largest number. You, with your\npretended fear of death, wish to meet it in battle as eagerly as we\ndo, and your most renowned men are those who have sent most to death.\"\n\nTo this strange remark I had no answer to make.\n\nThe air out at sea now grew chillier. The Kohen noticed it also, and\noffered me his cloak, which I refused. He seemed surprised, and\nsmiled.\n\n\"You are growing like one of us,\" said he. \"You will soon learn that\nthe greatest happiness in life is to do good to others and sacrifice\nyourself. You already show this in part. When you are with Almah you\nact like one of the Kosekin. You watch her to see and anticipate her\nslightest wish; you are eager to give her everything. She, on the\nother hand, is equally eager to give up all to you. Each one of you is\nwilling to lay down life for the other. You would gladly rush upon\ndeath to save her from harm, much as you pretend to fear death; and so\nI see that with Almah you will soon learn how sweet a thing death may\nbe.\"\n\n\"To live without her,\" said I, \"would be so bitter that death with her\nwould indeed be sweet. If I could save her life by laying down my own,\ndeath would be sweeter still; and not one of you Kosekin would meet it\nso gladly.\"\n\nThe Kosekin smiled joyously.\n\n\"Oh, almighty and wondrous power of Love!\" he exclaimed, \"how thou\nhast transformed this foreigner! Oh, Atam-or! you will soon be one of\nus altogether. For see, how is it now? You pretend to love riches and\nlife, and yet you are ready to give up everything for Almah.\"\n\n\"Gladly, gladly!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"all that you have--you would gladly lavish on her,\nand would rejoice to make yourself a pauper for her sweet sake. You\nalso would rejoice equally to give up life for her. Is it not so?\"\n\n\"It is,\" said I.\n\n\"Then I see by this that Almah has awakened within you your true human\nnature. Thus far it has lain dormant; it has been concealed under a\nthousand false and unnatural habits, arising from your strange native\ncustoms. You have been brought up under some frightful system, where\nnature is violated. Here among us your true humanity is unfolded, and\nwith Almah you are like the Kosekin. Soon you will learn new lessons,\nand will find out that there is a new and a final self-abnegation in\nperfect love; and your love will never rest till you have separated\nyourself from Almah, so that love can have its perfect work.\"\n\nThe sea now opened wide before us, rising up high as if half-way to\nthe zenith, giving the impression of a vast ascent to endless\ndistances. Around the shores spread themselves, with the shadowy\noutlines of the mountains; above was the sky, all clear, with faint\naurora-flashes and gleaming stars. Hand-in-hand with Almah I stood and\npointed out the constellations as we marked them while she told me of\nthe different divisions known among the Kosekin as well as her own\npeople. There, high in the zenith, was the southern polar-star, not\nexactly at the pole, nor yet of very great brightness, but still\nsufficiently noticeable.\n\nLooking back, we saw, low down, parts of the Phoenix and the Crane;\nhigher up, the Toucan, Hydrus, and Pavo. On our right, low down, was\nthe beautiful Altar; higher up, the Triangle; while on the left were\nthe Sword-fish and the Flying-fish. Turning to look forward, we beheld\na more splendid display. Then, over the bow of the vessel, between\nthe Centaur, which lay low, and Musca Indica, which rose high, there\nblazed the bright stars of the Southern Cross--a constellation, if not\nthe brightest, at least the most conspicuous and attractive in all the\nheavens. All around there burned other stars, separated widely. Then,\nover the stern, gleamed the splendid lustre of Achernar, on the left\nthe brilliant glow of Alpha Robur and Canopus, and low down before\nus the bright light of Argo. It was a scene full of splendor\nand fascination. After a time a change came over the sky: the\naurora-flashes, at first faint, gradually increased in brilliancy till\nthe stars grew dim, and all the sky, wherever the eye might turn from\nthe horizon to the zenith, seemed filled with lustrous flames of every\nconceivable hue. Colossal beams radiated from the pole toward the\nhorizon till the central light was dissipated, and there remained\nencircling us an infinite colonnade of flaming pillars that towered\nto the stars. These were all in motion, running upon one another,\nincessantly shifting and changing; new scenes forever succeeded to\nold; pillars were transformed to pyramids, pyramids to fiery bars;\nthese in their turn were transformed to other shapes, and all the\nwhile one tint of innumerable hues overspread the entire circle of\nthe sky.\n\nOur voyage occupied several joms; but our progress was continuous,\nfor different sets of rowers relieved one another at regular\nintervals. On the second jom a storm broke out. The sky had been\ngathering clouds during sleeping-time, and when we awoke we found the\nsea all lashed to fury, while all around the darkness was intense. The\nstorm grew steadily worse; the lightning flashed, the thunder pealed,\nand at length the sea was so heavy that rowing was impossible. Upon\nthis the oars were all taken in, and the galley lay tossing upon the\nfurious sea, amid waves that continually beat upon her.\n\nAnd now a scene ensued that filled me with amazement, and took\naway all my thoughts from the storm. It seemed impossible that so\nfrail a bark could stand the fury of the waves. Destruction was\ninevitable, and I was expecting to see the usual signs of grief\nand despair--wondering, too, how these rowers would preserve their\nsubordination. But I had forgotten in my excitement the strange\nnature of the Kosekin. Instead of terror there was joy, instead of\nwild despair there was peace and serene delight.\n\nThe lightning-flashes revealed a wonderful scene. There were all the\nrowers, each one upon his seat, and from them all there came forth\na chant which was full of triumph, like a song of public welcome to\nsome great national hero, or a song of joy over victory. The officers\nembraced one another and exchanged words of delight. The Kohen, after\nembracing all the others, turned to me, and, forgetting my foreign\nways, exclaimed, in a tone of enthusiastic delight,\n\n\"We are destroyed! Death is near! Rejoice!\"\n\nAccustomed as I was to the perils of the sea, I had learned to face\ndeath without flinching. Almah, too, was calm, for to her this death\nseemed preferable to that darker fate which awaited us; but the words\nof the Kohen jarred upon my feelings.\n\n\"Do you not intend to do anything to save the ship?\" I asked.\n\nHe laughed joyously.\n\n\"There's no occasion,\" said he. \"When the oars are taken in we always\nbegin to rejoice. And why not? Death is near--it is almost certain.\nWhy should we do anything to distract our minds and mar our joy? For\noh, dear friend, the glorious time has come when we can give up\nlife--life, with all its toils, its burdens, its endless bitternesses,\nits perpetual evils. Now we shall have no more suffering from\nvexatious and oppressive riches, from troublesome honors, from a\nsurplus of food, from luxuries and delicacies, and all the ills of\nlife.\"\n\n\"But what is the use of being born at all?\" I asked, in a wonder that\nnever ceased to rise at every fresh display of Kosekin feeling.\n\n\"The use?\" said the Kohen. \"Why, if we were not born, how could we\nknow the bliss of dying, or enjoy the sweetness of death? Death is the\nend of being--the one sweet hope and crown and glory of life, the one\ndesire and hope of every living man. The blessing is denied to none.\nRejoice with me, oh Atam-or! you will soon know its blessedness as\nwell as I.\"\n\nHe turned away. I held Almah in my arms, and we watched the storm by\nthe lightning-flashes and waited for the end. But the end came not.\nThe galley was light, broad, and buoyant as a life-boat; at the same\ntime it was so strongly constructed that there was scarcely any twist\nor contortion in the sinewy fabric. So we floated buoyantly and safely\nupon the summit of vast waves, and a storm that would have destroyed\na ship of the European fashion scarcely injured this in the slightest\ndegree. It was an indestructible as a raft and as buoyant as a bubble;\nso we rode out the gale, and the death which the Kosekin invoked did\nnot come at all.\n\nThe storm was but short-lived; the clouds dispersed, and soon went\nscudding over the sky; the sea went down. The rowers had to take their\noars once more, and the reaction that followed upon their recent\nrejoicing was visible in universal gloom and dejection. As the clouds\ndispersed the aurora lights came out more splendid than ever, and\nshowed nothing but melancholy faces. The rowers pulled with no life or\nanimation; the officers stood about sighing and lamenting; Almah and I\nwere the only ones that rejoiced over this escape from death.\n\nJoms passed. We saw other sights; we met with galleys and saw many\nships about the sea. Some were moved by sails only; these were\nmerchant ships, but they had only square sails, and could not sail in\nany other way than before the wind. Once or twice I caught glimpses\nof vast shadowy objects in the air. I was startled and terrified;\nfor, great as were the wonders of this strange region, I had not yet\nsuspected that the air itself might have denizens as tremendous as the\nland or the sea. Yet so it was, and afterward during the voyage I saw\nthem often. One in particular was so near that I observed it with\nease. It came flying along in the same course with us, at a height of\nabout fifty feet from the water. It was a frightful monster, with a\nlong body and vast wings like those a bat. Its progress was swift, and\nit soon passed out of sight. To Almah the monster created no surprise;\nshe was familiar with them, and told me that they were very abundant\nhere, but that they never were known to attack ships. She informed me\nthat they were capable of being tamed if caught when young, though in\nher country they were never made use of. The name given by the Kosekin\nto these monsters is athaleb.\n\nAt length we drew near to our destination. We reached a large harbor\nat the end of a vast bay: here the mountains extended around, and\nbefore us there arose terrace after terrace of twinkling lights\nrunning away to immense distances. It looked like a city of a million\ninhabitants, though it may have contained far less than that. By the\nbrilliant aurora light I could see that it was in general shape and\nform precisely like the city that we had left, though far larger and\nmore populous. The harbor was full of ships and boats of all sorts,\nsome lying at the stone quays, others leaving port, others entering.\nGalleys passed and repassed, and merchant ships with their clumsy\nsails, and small fishing-boats. From afar arose the deep hum of a vast\nmultitude and the low roar that always ascends from a popular city.\n\nThe galley hauled alongside her wharf, and we found ourselves at\nlength in the mighty amir of the Kosekin. The Kohen alone landed;\nthe rest remained on board, and Almah and I with them.\n\nOther galleys were here. On the wharf workmen were moving about. Just\nbeyond were caverns that looked like warehouses. Above these was a\nterraced street, where a vast multitude moved to and fro--a living\ntide as crowded and as busy as that in Cheapside.\n\nAfter what seemed a long time the Kohen returned. This time he came\nwith a number of people, all of whom were in cars drawn by opkuks.\nHalf were men and half women. These came aboard, and it seemed as\nthough we were to be separated; for the women took Almah, while the\nmen took me. Upon this I entreated the Kohen not to separate us. I\ninformed him that we were both of a different race from his, that we\ndid not understand their ways; we should be miserable if separated.\n\nI spoke long and with all the entreaty possible to one with my limited\nacquaintance with the language. My words evidently impressed them:\nsome of them even wept.\n\n\"You make us sad,\" said the Kohen. \"Willingly would we do everything\nthat you bid, for we are your slaves; but the state law prevents.\nStill, in your case, the law will be modified; for you are in such\nhonor here that you may be considered as beyond the laws. For the\npresent, at least, we cannot separate you.\"\n\nThese words brought much consolation. After this we landed, and Almah\nand I were still together.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nTHE WONDERS OF THE \"AMIR\"\n\n\nWe were drawn on cars up to the first terraced street, and here we\nfound the vast multitude which we had seen from a distance. Crossing\nthis street, we ascended and came to another precisely like it; then,\nstill going on, we came to a third. Here there was an immense space,\nnot overgrown with trees like the streets, but perfectly open. In the\nmidst arose a lofty pyramid, and as I looked at it I could not refrain\nfrom shuddering; for it looked like the public altar, upon which in\ndue time I should be compelled to make my appearance, and be offered\nup as a victim to the terrific superstitions of the Kosekin.\n\nCrossing this great square, we came to a vast portal, which opened\ninto a cavern with twinkling lights. The city itself extended above\nthis, for we could see the terraced streets rising above our heads;\nbut here our progress ended at the great cavern in the chief square,\nopposite the pyramid.\n\nOn entering the cavern we traversed an antechamber, and then passing\non we reached a vast dome, of dimensions so great that I could\nperceive no end in that gloom. The twinkling lights served only to\ndisclose the darkness and to indicate the immensity of the cavern. In\nthe midst there arose two enormous columns, which were lost in the\ngloom above.\n\nIt was only by passing through this that we learned its great extent.\nWe at length came to the other end, and here we saw numerous passages\nleading away. The Kohen led us through one of these, and after passing\nthrough several other domes of smaller dimensions we at length reached\nan apartment where we stopped. This place was furnished with couches\nand hangings, and lighted with flaming lamps. The light was\ndistressing to those who had accompanied us, and many of them left,\nwhile the few who remained had to cover their eyes. Here we found that\nall preparations had been made. The apartments were all illuminated,\nthough our love of light never ceased to be a matter of amazement to\nthe Kosekin, and a bounteous repast was spread for us. But the Kohen\nand the others found the light intolerable, and soon left us to\nourselves.\n\nAfter the repast some women appeared to take Almah to her chamber,\nand, with the usual kindness of the Kosekin, they assured her that she\nwould not be expected to obey the law of separation, but that she was\nto remain here, where she would be always within reach of me.\n\nAfter her departure there came to visit me the lowest man in all the\nland of the Kosekin, though, according to our view, he would be\nesteemed the highest. This was the Kohen Gadol. His history\nhad already been told me. I had learned that through lack of Kosekin\nvirtue he had gradually sunk to this position, and now was compelled\nto hold in his hands more wealth, power, and display than any other\nman in the nation.\n\nHe was a man of singular appearance. The light was not so troublesome\nto him as to the others--he merely kept his eyes shaded; but he\nregarded me with a keen look of inquiry that was suggestive of\nshrewdness and cunning. I confess it was with a feeling of relief\nthat I made this discovery; for I longed to find someone among this\nsingular people who was selfish, who feared death, who loved life, who\nloved riches, and had something in common with me. This I thought I\nperceived in the shrewd, cunning face of the Kohen Gadol, and I was\nglad; for I saw that while he could not possibly be more dangerous to\nme than those self-sacrificing, self-denying cannibals whom I had thus\nfar known, he might prove of some assistance, and might help me to\ndevise means of escape. If I could only find someone who was a coward,\nand selfish and avaricious--if this Kohen Gadol could but be he--how\nmuch brighter my life would be! And so there happened to me an\nincredible thing, that my highest wish was now to find in the Kohen\nGadol cowardice, avarice, and selfishness.\n\nThe Kohen was accompanied by a young female, richly attired, who, I\nafterward learned, was his daughter. Her name was Layelah, and she\nfilled the office of Malca, which signifies queen; and though\nhonorable with us above all, is among the Kosekin the lowest in the\nland. Layelah was so beautiful that I looked at her in amazement. She\nwas very tall for one of the Kosekin, which made her stature equal\nto that of an ordinary girl with us; her hair was rich, dark and\nluxuriant, gathered about her head in great masses and bound by a\ngolden band. Her features were delicate and perfect in their outline;\nher expression was noble and commanding. Her eyes were utterly unlike\nthose of the other Kosekin; the upper lids had a slight droop, but\nthat was all, and that was the nearest approach to the national blink.\nHer first entrance into the room seemed to dazzle her, and she shaded\nher eyes for a few moments, but after that she looked at me fixedly,\nand seemed to suffer no more inconvenience than I did. The perfect\nliberty of women among the Kosekin made this visit from her quite as\nnatural as that of her father; and though she said but little on this\noccasion, she was an attentive listener and close observer.\n\nTheir visit was long, for they were evidently full of curiosity. They\nhad heard much about me and wished to see more. It was the first time\nthat I had found among the Kosekin the slightest desire to know where\nI had come from. Hitherto all had been content with the knowledge\nthat I was a foreigner. Now, however, I found in the Kohen Gadol and\nLayelah a curiosity that was most eager and intense. They questioned\nme about my country, about the great world beyond the mountains, about\nthe way in which I had come here, about the manners and customs of my\ncountrymen. They were eager to know about those great nations of which\nI spoke, who loved light and life; about men who loved themselves\nbetter than others; of that world where men feared death and loved\nlife, and sought after riches and lived in the light.\n\nThe sleeping-time came and passed, and my visitors were still full of\neager questionings. It was Layelah who at last thought of the lateness\nof the hour. At a word from her the Kohen Gadol rose, with many\napologies, and prepared to go. But before he left he said:\n\n\"When I was a child I was shipwrecked, and was taken up a ship which\nconveyed me to a nation beyond the sea. There I grew up to manhood. I\nlearned their language and manners and customs, and when I returned\nhome I found myself an alien here: I do not love darkness or death, I\ndo not hate riches, and the result is that I am what I am. If I were\nlike the rest of my countrymen, my lot would make me miserable; but as\nit is I prefer it to any other, and consider myself not the lowest but\nthe greatest in the land. My daughter is like me, and instead of being\nashamed of her station she is proud of it, and would not give it up\neven to become a pauper. I will see you again. I have much to say.\"\n\nWith these words the Kohen Gadol retired, followed by Layelah, leaving\nme more hopeful than I had been for a long time.\n\nFor many joms following I received visits from the Kohen Gadol and\nfrom Layelah. Almah was with me until sleeping-time, and then these\nother visitors would come. In this, at least, they resembled the other\nKosekin, that they never dreamed of interfering with Almah when she\nmight wish to be with me. Their visits were always long, and we\nhad much to say; but what I lost of sleep I always made up on the\nfollowing jom. The Kohen Gadol, with his keen, shrewd face,\ninterested me greatly; but Layelah, with her proud face and air of\ncommand, was a positive wonder.\n\nI soon learned that the Kohen Gadol was what we term \"a man of\nadvanced views,\" or perhaps a \"Reformer,\" or a \"Philosophic Radical,\"\nit matters not which; suffice it to say that his ideas and feelings\ndiffered from those of his nation, and if carried out would be equal\nto a revolution in politics and morals.\n\nThe Kohen Gadol advocated selfishness as the true law of life, without\nwhich no state can prosper. There were a few of similar views, but\nthey were all regarded with great contempt by the multitude, and had\nto suffer the utmost rigor of the law; for they were all endowed with\nvast wealth, compelled to live in the utmost splendor and luxury, to\nhave enormous retinues, and to wield the chief power in politics and\nin religion. Even this, however, had not changed the sentiments of\nthe condemned, and I learned that they were laboring incessantly,\nnotwithstanding their severe punishment, to disseminate their peculiar\ndoctrines. These were formulated as follows:\n\n  1. A man should not love others better than himself.\n  2. Life is not an evil to be got rid of.\n  3. Other things are to be preferred to death.\n  4. Poverty is not the best state for man.\n  5. Unrequited love is not the greatest happiness.\n  6. Lovers may sometimes marry.\n  7. To serve is not more honorable than to command.\n  8. Defeat is not more glorious than victory.\n  9. To save a life should not be regarded as a criminal offence.\n 10. The paupers should be forced to take a certain amount of\n       wealth, to relieve the necessities of the rich.\n\nThese articles were considered both by the Kohen Gadol and by Layelah\nto be remarkable for their audacity, and were altogether too advanced\nfor mention by any except the chosen few. With the multitude he had to\ndeal differently, and had to work his way by concealing his opinions.\nHe had made a great conspiracy, in which he was still engaged, and had\ngained immense numbers of adherents by allowing them to give him their\nwhole wealth. Through his assistance many Athons and Kohens and Meleks\nhad become artisans laborers, and even paupers; but all were bound by\nhim to the strictest secrecy. If anyone should divulge the secret, it\nwould be ruin to him and to many others; for they would at once be\npunished by the bestowal of the extremest wealth, by degradation to\nthe rank of rulers and commanders, and by the severest rigors of\nluxury, power, splendor, and magnificence known among the Kosekin.\nOverwhelmed thus with the cares of government, crushed under the\nweight of authority and autocratic rule, surrounded by countless\nslaves all ready to die for them, their lives would be embittered\nand their punishment would be more than they could bear. But the\nphilosophic Kohen Gadol dared all these punishments, and pursued his\nway calmly and pertinaciously.\n\nNothing surprised the Kohen Gadol so much as the manner in which I\nreceived his confidences. He half expected to startle me by his\nboldness, but was himself confounded by my words. I told him that in\nmy country self was the chief consideration, self-preservation the law\nof nature; death the King of Terrors; wealth the object of universal\nsearch, poverty the worst of evils; unrequited love nothing less than\nanguish and despair; to command others the highest glory; victory,\nhonor; defeat, intolerable shame; and other things of the same sort,\nall of which sounded in his ears, as he said, with such tremendous\nforce that they were like peals of thunder. He shook his head\ndespondently; he could not believe that such views as mine could ever\nbe attained to among the Kosekin. But Layelah was bolder, and with all\na woman's impetuosity grasped at my fullest meaning and held it firm.\n\n\"He is right,\" said Layelah--\"the heaven-born Atam-or. He shall be our\nteacher. The rich shall be esteemed, the poor shall be down-trodden;\nto rule over others shall be glorious, to serve shall be base; victory\nshall be an honor, defeat a shame; selfishness, self-seeking, luxury,\nand indulgence shall be virtues; poverty, want, and squalor shall be\nthings of abhorrence and contempt.\"\n\nThe face of Layelah glowed with enthusiasm as she said these words,\nand I saw in her a daring, intrepid, and high-hearted woman, full of a\nwoman's headlong impetuosity and disregard of consequences. In me she\nsaw one who seemed to her like a prophet and teacher of a new order\nof things, and her whole soul responded to the principles which I\nannounced. It required immense strength of mind and firmness of soul\nto separate herself from the prevalent sentiment of her nation; and\nthough nature had done much for her in giving her a larger portion of\noriginal selfishness than was common to her people, still she was a\nchild of the Kosekin, and her daring was all the more remarkable. And\nso she went further than her father, and adopted my extreme views when\nhe shrank back, and dared more unflinchingly the extremest rigors of\nthe national law, and all that the Kosekin could inflict in the way of\nwealth, luxury, supreme command, palatial abodes, vast retinues of\nslaves, and the immense degradation of the queenly office.\n\nI spoke to her in a warning voice about her rashness.\n\n\"Oh,\" said she, \"I have counted the cost, and am ready to accept all\nthat they can inflict. I embrace the good cause, and will not give it\nup--no, not even if they could increase my wealth a thousand-fold,\nand sentence me to live a hundred seasons. I can bear their utmost\ninflictions of wealth, power, magnificence; I could even bear being\ncondemned to live forever in the light. Oh, my friend, it is the\nconviction of right and the support of conscience that strengthens one\nto bear the greatest evils that man can inflict.\"\n\nFrom these words it was evident to me that Layelah was a true child of\nthe Kosekin; for though she was of advanced sentiments she still used\nthe language of her people, and spoke of the punishments of the law as\nthough they were punishments in reality. Now, to me and to Almah these\nso-called punishments seemed rewards.\n\nIt was impossible for me to avoid feeling a very strong regard for\nthis enthusiastic and beautiful girl; all the more, indeed, because\nshe evinced such an undisguised admiration for me. She evidently\nconsidered me some superior being, from some superior race; and\nalthough my broken and faulty way of speaking the language was\nsomething of a trial, still she seemed to consider every word I\nuttered as a maxim of the highest wisdom. The tritest of truths, the\ncommonest of platitudes, the most familiar of proverbs or old saws\ncurrent among us were eagerly seized by Layelah, and accepted as\ntruths almost divine--as new doctrines for the guidance of the human\nrace. These she would discuss with me; she would put them into better\nand more striking language, and ask for my opinion. Then she would\nwrite them down.\n\nFor the Kosekin knew the art of writing. They had an alphabet of their\nown, which was at once simple and very scientific. There were no\nvowels, but only consonant sounds, the vowels being supplied in\nreading, just as if one should write the words fthr or dghtr, and\nread them father and daughter. Their letters were as follows: P, K, T,\nB, G, D, F, Ch, Th, M, L, N, S, H, R. There were also three others,\nwhich have no equivalents in English.\n\nIt soon became evident to me that Layelah had a complete ascendancy\nover her father; that she was not only the Malca of the amir, but\nthe presiding spirit and the chief administrative genius of the whole\nnation of the Kosekin. She seemed to be a new Semiramis--one who might\nrevolutionize an empire and introduce a new order of things. Such,\nindeed, was her high ambition, and she plainly avowed it to me; but\nwhat was more, she frankly informed me that she regarded me as a\nHeaven-sent teacher--as one who in this darkness could tell her of the\nnations of light--who could instruct her in the wisdom of other and\ngreater races, and help her to accomplish her grand designs.\n\nAs for Almah, she seemed quite beneath the notice of the aspiring\nLayelah. She never noticed her, she never spoke of her, and she always\nmade her visits to me after Almah had gone.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nTHE DARK MAIDEN LAYELAH\n\n\nLayelah at length began to make pointed remarks about Almah.\n\n\"She loves you,\" said she, \"and you love her. How is it that you do\nnot give each other up?\"\n\n\"I would die rather than give up Almah,\" said I.\n\nLayelah smiled. \"That sounds strange to the Kosekin,\" said she, \"for\nhere to give up your love and to die are both esteemed the greatest\npossible blessings. But Almah should give you up. It is the women with\nus who make the beginning. Women generally fall in love first, and it\nis expected that they will tell their love first. The delicacy of a\nwoman's feelings makes this natural, for if a man tells his love to a\nwoman who does not love him, it shocks her modesty; while if a woman\ntells a man, he has no modesty to shock.\"\n\n\"That is strange,\" said I; \"but suppose the man does not love the\nwoman?\"\n\n\"Why, no woman wants to be loved; she only wants to love.\"\n\nAt this I felt somewhat bewildered.\n\n\"That,\" said Layelah, \"is unrequited love, which is the chief blessing\nhere, though for my part I am a philosopher, and would wish when I\nlove to be loved in return.\"\n\n\"And then,\" said I, \"if so, would you give up your lover, in\naccordance with the custom of your country?\"\n\nLayelah's dark eyes rested on me for a moment with a glance of intense\nearnestness and profound meaning. She drew a long breath, and then\nsaid, in a low, tremulous voice,\n\n\"Never!\"\n\nLayelah was constantly with me, and at length used to come at an\nearlier time, when Almah was present. Her manner toward Almah was full\nof the usual Kosekin courtesy and gracious cordiality. She was still\nintent upon learning from me the manners, customs, and principles of\naction of the race to which I belonged. She had an insatiable thirst\nfor knowledge, and her curiosity extended to all of those great\ninventions which are the wonder of Christendom. Locomotives and\nsteamboats were described to her under the names of \"horses of fire\"\nand \"ships of fire\"; printing was \"letters of power\"; the electric\ntelegraph, \"messages of lightning\"; the organ, \"lute of giants,\"\nand so on. Yet, in spite of the eagerness with which she made her\ninquiries, and the diligence with which she noted all down, I could\nsee that there was in her mind something lying beneath it all--a far\nmore earnest purpose, and a far more personal one, than the pursuit of\nuseful knowledge.\n\nLayelah was watchful of Almah; she seemed studying her to see how far\nthis woman of another race differed from the Kosekin. She would often\nturn from me and talk with Almah for a long time, questioning her\nabout her people and their ways. Almah's manner was somewhat reserved,\nand it was rendered somewhat more so from the fact that her mind was\nalways full of the prospect of our impending doom. Each jom as it\ncame and went brought us nearer to that awful time, and the hour was\nsurely coming when we should be taken to the outer square and to the\ntop of the pyramid of sacrifice.\n\nOnce Layelah sat for some time silent and involved in thought. At\nlength she began to speak to me.\n\n\"Almah,\" said she, \"is very different from us. She loves you and you\nlove her. She ought to give you up. Almah, you ought to give up\nAtam-or, since you love him.\"\n\nAlmah looked confused, and made some reply to the effect that she\nbelonged to a different race with different customs.\n\n\"But you should follow our customs. You are one of us now. You can\neasily find another who will take him.\"\n\nAlmah threw a piteous glance at me and said nothing.\n\n\"I,\" said Layelah, \"will take him.\"\n\nShe spoke these words with an air of magnanimity, as though putting it\nin the light of a favor to Almah; but Almah did not make any reply,\nand after some silence Layelah spoke of something else.\n\nNot long after we were alone together, and Layelah returned to the\nsubject. She referred to Almah's want of sympathy with the manners of\nthe Kosekin, and asserted that she ought to aim after a separation.\n\n\"I love her,\" said I, with great warmth, \"and will never give her up.\"\n\n\"But she must give you up; it is the woman's place to take the first\nstep. I should be willing to take you.\"\n\nAs Layelah said this she looked at me very earnestly, as if anxious to\nsee how I accepted this offer. It was for me a most embarrassing\nmoment. I loved Almah, but Layelah also was most agreeable, and I\nliked her very much; indeed, so much so that I could not bear to say\nanything that might hurt her feelings. Among all the Kosekin there was\nnot one who was not infinitely inferior to her in my eyes. Still, I\nloved Almah, and I told her so again, thinking that in this way I\nmight repel her without giving offence.\n\nBut Layelah was quite ready with her reply.\n\n\"If you love Almah,\" said she, \"that is the very reason why you should\nmarry me.\"\n\nThis made me feel more embarrassed than ever.\n\nI stammered something about my own feelings--the manners and customs\nof my race--and the fear that I had of acting against my own\nprinciples. \"Besides,\" I added, \"I'm afraid it would make you\nunhappy.\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" said Layelah, briskly; \"on the contrary, it would make me\nvery happy indeed.\"\n\nI began to be more and more aghast at this tremendous frankness, and\nwas utterly at a loss what to say.\n\n\"My father,\" continued Layelah, \"is different from the other Kosekin,\nand so am I. I seek requital for love, and do not think it an evil.\"\n\nA sudden thought now suggested itself, and I caught at it as a last\nresort.\n\n\"You have,\" said I, \"some lover among the Kosekin. Why do you not\nmarry him?\"\n\nLayelah smiled.\n\n\"I have no lover that I love,\" said she, \"among the Kosekin.\"\n\nMy feeble effort was thus a miserable failure. I was about saying\nsomething concerning the Kosekin alphabet or something else of an\nequally appropriate nature, when she prevented me.\n\n\"Atam-or,\" said she, in a low voice.\n\n\"Layelah,\" said I, with my mind full of confusion.\n\n\"I love you!\"\n\nShe sat looking at me with her beautiful face all aglow her dark eyes\nfixed on mine with an intense and eager gaze. I looked at her and said\nnot one single word. Layelah was the first to break the awkward\nsilence.\n\n\"You love Almah, Atam-or; but say, do you not love me? You smile at\nme, you meet me always when I come with warm greetings, and you seem\nto enjoy yourself in my society. Say, Atam-or, do you not love me?\"\n\nThis was a perilous and a tremendous moment. The fact is, I did like\nLayelah very much indeed, and I wanted to tell her so; but my\nignorance of the language did not allow me to observe those nice\ndistinctions of meaning which exist between the words \"like\" and\n\"love.\" I knew no other word than the one Kosekin word meaning \"love,\"\nand could not think of any meaning \"like.\" It was, therefore, a very\ntrying position for me.\n\n\"Dear Layelah,\" said I, floundering and stammering in my confusion, \"I\nlove you; I--\"\n\nBut here I was interrupted without waiting for any further words; the\nbeautiful creature flung her arms around me and clung to me with a\nfond embrace. As for me, I was utterly confounded, bewildered, and\ndesperate. I thought of my darling Almah, whom alone I loved. It\nseemed at that moment as though I was not only false to her, but as if\nI was even endangering her life. My only thought now was to clear up\nmy meaning.\n\n\"Dear Layelah,\" said I, as I sat with her arms around me, and with my\nown around her slender waist, \"I do not want to hurt your feelings.\"\n\n\"Oh, Atam-or! oh, my love! never, never did I know such bliss as\nthis.\"\n\nHere again I was overwhelmed, but I still persisted in my effort.\n\n\"Dear Layelah,\" said I, \"I love Almah most dearly and most tenderly.\"\n\n\"Oh, Atam-or, why speak of that? I know it well. And so by our Kosekin\nlaw you give her up; among us, lovers never marry. So you take me,\nyour own Layelah, and you will have me for your bride; and my love for\nyou is ten thousand times stronger than that of the cold and\nmelancholy Almah. She may marry my papa.\"\n\nThis suggestion filled me with dismay.\n\n\"Oh no,\" said I. \"Never, never will I give up Almah!\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said Layelah; \"you do not give her up--she gives you\nup.\"\n\n\"She never will,\" said I.\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said Layelah; \"I will tell her that you wish it.\"\n\n\"I do not wish it,\" said I. \"I love her, and will never give her up.\"\n\n\"It's all the same,\" said Layelah. \"You cannot marry her at all. No\none will marry you. You and Almah are victims and the State has given\nyou the matchless honor of death. Common people who love one another\nmay marry if they choose, and take the punishment which the law\nassigns but illustrious victims who love cannot marry, and so, my\nAtam-or, you have only me.\"\n\nI need not say that all this was excessively embarrassing I was\ncertainly fond of Layelah, and liked her too much to hurt her\nfeelings. Had I been one of the Kosekin I might perhaps have managed\nbetter; but being a European, a man of the Aryan race--being such, and\nsitting there with the beautiful Layelah lavishing all her affections\nupon me--why, it stands to reason that I could not have the heart to\nwound her feelings in any way. I was taken at an utter disadvantage.\nNever in my life had I heard of women taking the initiative. Layelah\nhad proposed to me, she would not listen to refusal, and I had not the\nheart to wound her. I had made all the fight I could by persisting in\nasserting my love for Almah, but all my assertions were brushed\nlightly aside as trivial things.\n\nLet any gentleman put himself in my situation, and ask himself what he\nwould do. What would he do if such a thing could happen to him at\nhome? But there such a thing could not happen, and so there is no use\nin supposing an impossible case. At any rate I think I deserve\nsympathy. Who could keep his presence of mind under such\ncircumstances? With us a young lady who loves one man can easily repel\nanother suitor; but here it was very different, for how could I repel\nLayelah? Could I turn upon her and say \"Unhand me\"? Could I say \"Away!\nI am another's\"? Of course I couldn't; and what's worse, if I had said\nsuch things Layelah would have smiled me down into silence. The fact\nis, it doesn't do for women to take the initiative--it's not fair. I\nhad stood a good deal among the Kosekin. Their love of darkness, their\npassion for death, their contempt of riches, their yearning after\nunrequited love, their human sacrifices, their cannibalism, all had\nmore or less become familiar to me, and I had learned to acquiesce in\nsilence; but now when it came to this--that a woman should propose to\na man--it really was more than a fellow could stand. I felt this at\nthat moment very forcibly; but then the worst of it was that Layelah\nwas so confoundedly pretty, and had such a nice way with her, that\nhang me if I knew what to say.\n\nMeanwhile Layelah was not silent; she had all her wits about her.\n\n\"Dear papa,\" said she, \"would make such a nice husband for Almah. He\nis a widower, you know. I could easily persuade him to marry her. He\nalways does whatever I ask him to do.\"\n\n\"But victims cannot marry, you said.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Layelah, sweetly, \"they cannot marry one another, but Almah\nmay marry dear papa, and then you and I can be married, and it will be\nall very nice indeed.\"\n\nAt this I started away.\n\n\"No,\" said I, indignantly, \"it won't be nice. I'm engaged to be\nmarried to Almah, and I'm not going to give her up.\"\n\n\"Oh, but she gives you up, you know,\" said Layelah, quietly.\n\n\"Well, but I'm not going to be given up.\"\n\n\"Why, how unreasonable you are, you foolish boy!\" said Layelah, in her\nmost caressing manner. \"You have nothing at all to do with it.\"\n\nAt this I was in fresh despair, and then a new thought came, which I\nseized upon.\n\n\"See here,\" said I, \"why can't I marry both of you? I'm engaged to\nAlmah, and I love her better than all the world. Let me marry her and\nyou too.\"\n\nAt this Layelah laughed long and merrily. Peal after peal of laughter,\nmusical and most merry, burst from her. It was contagious; I could not\nhelp joining in, and so we both sat laughing. It was a long time\nbefore we regained our self-control.\n\n\"Why, that's downright bigamy!\" exclaimed Layelah with fresh laughter.\n\"Why, Atam-or, you're mad!\" and so she went off again in fresh peals\nof laughter. It was evident that my proposal was not at all shocking,\nbut simply comical, ridiculous, and inconceivable in its absurdity. It\nwas to her what the remark of some despairing beauty would be among us\nwho, when pressed by two lovers should express a confused willingness\nto marry both. It was evident that Layelah accepted it as a ludicrous\njest.\n\nLaughter was all very well, of course; but I was serious and felt that\nI ought not to part with Layelah without some better understanding,\nand so I once more made an effort.\n\n\"All this,\" said I, in a mournful tone, \"is a mere mockery. What have\nI to say about love and marriage? If you loved me as you say, you\nwould not laugh, but weep. You forget what I am. What am I? A victim,\nand doomed--doomed to a hideous fate--a fate of horror unutterable.\nYou cannot even begin to imagine the anguish with which I look forward\nto that fate which impends over me and Almah. Marriage--idle word!\nWhat have I to do with marriage? What has Almah? There is only one\nmarriage before us--the dread marriage with death! Why talk of love to\nthe dying? The tremendous ordeal, the sacrifice, is before us and\nafter that there remains the hideous Mista Kosek!\"\n\nAt this Layelah sprang up, with her whole face and attitude full of\nlife and energy.\n\n\"I know, I know,\" said she, quickly; \"I have arranged for all. Your\nlife shall be saved. Do you think that I have consented to your death?\nNever! You are mine. I will save you. I will show you what we can do.\nYou shall escape.\"\n\n\"Can you really save me?\" I cried.\n\n\"I can.\"\n\n\"What! in spite of the whole nation?\"\n\nLayelah laughed scornfully.\n\n\"I can save you,\" said she. \"We can fly. There are other nations\nbeside ours. We can find some land among the Gojin where we can live\nin peace. The Gojin are not like us.\"\n\n\"But Almah?\" said I.\n\nThe face of Layelah clouded.\n\n\"I can only save you,\" said she.\n\n\"Then I will stay and die with Almah,\" said I, obstinately.\n\n\"What!\" said Layelah, \"do you not fear death?\"\n\n\"Of course I do,\" said I; \"but I'd rather die than lose Almah.\"\n\n\"But it's impossible to save both of you.\"\n\n\"Then leave me and save Almah,\" said I.\n\n\"What! would you give up your life for Almah?\"\n\n\"Yes, and a thousand lives,\" said I.\n\n\"Why,\" said Layelah, \"now you talk just like the Kosekin. You might as\nwell be one of us. You love death for the sake of Almah. Why not be\nmore like the Kosekin, and seek after a separation from Almah?\"\n\nLayelah was not at all offended at my declaration of love for Almah.\nShe uttered these words in a lively tone, and then said that it was\ntime for her to go.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nTHE FLYING MONSTER\n\n\nI retired to bed, but could not sleep. The offer of escape filled me\nwith excited thoughts. These made sleep impossible, and as I lay awake\nI thought that perhaps it would be well to know what might be\nLayelah's plan of escape, for I might then make use of it to save\nAlmah. I determined to find out all about it on the following\njom--to question her as to the lands of the Gojin, to learn all her\npurpose. It might be that I could make use of that very plan to save\nAlmah; but if not, why then I was resolved to remain and meet my fate\nwith her. If Layelah could be induced to take both of us, I was of\ncourse resolved to go, trusting to chance as to the claims of Layelah\nupon me, and determined at all hazards to be faithful to Almah; but if\nshe should positively refuse to save Almah, then I thought it possible\nthat I might be able to find in Layelah's plan of escape something of\nwhich I might avail myself. I could not imagine what it was, but it\nseemed to me that it might be something quite feasible, especially for\na desperate man. The only thought I had was of escape by means of some\nboat over the seas. In a boat I would be at home. I could make use of\na sail so as to elude pursuit, and could guide myself by the stars.\nThe only thing that I wanted to know was the situation of the lands of\nthe Gojin.\n\nOn the following jom the Kohen Gadol and Layelah came quite early\nand spent much time. I was surprised to see the Kohen Gadol devoting\nhimself in an absurd fashion to Almah. It at once occurred to me that\nLayelah had obtained her father's co-operation in her scheme, and that\nthe old villain actually imagined that he could win the hand of Almah.\nTo Almah herself I had said nothing whatever about the proposal of\nLayelah, so that she was quite ignorant of the intentions of her\ncompanion; but it was excessively annoying to me to see such\nproceedings going on under my own eyes. At the same time I felt that\nit would be both unwise and uncivil to interfere; and I was also quite\nsure that Almah's affections were not to be diverted from me by\nanyone, much less by such an elderly party as the Kohen Gadol. It was\nvery trying, however, and, in spite of my confidence in Almah, my\njealousy was excited, and I began to think that the party of\nphilosophical Radicals were not so agreeable as the orthodox cannibals\nwhom I first met. As for Layelah, she seemed quite unconscious of any\ndisturbance in my mind. She was as amiable, as sprightly, as\ninquisitive, and as affectionate as ever. She even outdid herself, and\ndevoted herself to me with an abandon that was quite irresistible.\n\nAfter Almah had left me, Layelah came again, and this time she was\nalone.\n\n\"I have come,\" said she, \"to show you the way in which we can escape,\nwhenever you decide to do so.\"\n\nIt was the thing above all others which I wished to know, and\ntherefore I questioned her eagerly about it; but to all of my\nquestions she only replied that she would show me, and I might judge\nfor myself.\n\nLayelah led the way, and I followed her. We traversed long galleries\nand vast halls, all of which were quite empty. It was the\nsleeping-time, and only those were visible who had some duties which\nkept them up later than usual. Faint, twinkling lights but feebly\nilluminated the general gloom. At length we came to an immense cavern,\nwhich was darker than ever, and without any lamps at all. Through a\nvast portal, which was closed with a barred gateway, the beams of the\nbrilliant aurora penetrated and disclosed something of the interior.\n\nHere Layelah stopped and peered through the gloom while I stood\nwaiting by her side, wondering what means of escape could be found in\nthis cavern. As I stood I heard through the still air the sound as of\nliving things. For a time I saw nothing, but at length I descried a\nvast, shadowy form moving forward toward the portal, where the\ndarkness was less. It was a form of portentous size and fearful shape,\nand I could not make out at first the nature of it. It surpassed all\nthat I had ever seen. Its head was large and its jaws long, armed with\nrows of terrible teeth like those of a crocodile. Its body was of\ngreat size. It walked on its hind-legs, so as to maintain itself in an\nupright attitude, and in that position its height was over twelve\nfeet. But the most amazing thing about this monster has yet to be\ntold. As it walked its forearms waved and fluttered, and I saw\ndescending from them what seemed like vast folded leathern wings,\nwhich shook and swayed in the air at every step. Its pace was about as\nfast as that of a man, and it moved with ease and lightness. It seemed\nlike some enormous bat, or rather like a winged crocodile, or yet\nagain like one of those monstrous dragons of which I had read, but in\nwhose actual existence I had never believed. Yet here I saw one living\nand moving before me--an actual dragon, with the exception of a tail;\nfor that appendage, which plays so great a part in all the pictures of\ndragons, had no place here. This beast had but a short caudal\nappendage, and all its terrors lay in its jaws and in its wings.\n\nFor a moment I stood almost lifeless with terror and surprise. Then I\nshrank back, but Layelah laid her hand on my arm.\n\n\"Don't be afraid,\" said she; \"it's only an athaleb.\"\n\n\"But won't it--won't it bite?\" I asked, with a shudder.\n\n\"Oh no,\" said Layelah; \"it swallows its victuals whole.\"\n\nAt this I shrank away still farther.\n\n\"Don't be afraid,\" said Layelah again. \"Its jaws are muzzled, and,\nbesides, it's a tame athaleb. Its jaws are unmuzzled only at\nfeeding-time. But this one is very tame. There are three or four\nothers in here, and all as tame as I am. They all know me. Come up\nnearer; don't be afraid. These athalebs are easily tamed.\"\n\n\"How can such tremendous monsters be tamed?\" I asked, in an\nincredulous tone.\n\n\"Oh, man can tame anything. The athalebs are very docile when they are\ntaken young. They are very long lived. This one has been in service\nhere for a hundred seasons and more.\"\n\nAt this I began to regain my confidence, and as Layelah moved nearer\nto the athaleb I accompanied her. A nearer view, however, was by no\nmeans reassuring. The dragon look of the athaleb was stronger than\never, for I could see that all its body was covered with scales. On\nits neck and back was a long ridge of coarse hair, and the sweep of\nits vast arms was enormous. It was with a quaking heart that I stood\nnear; but the coolness of Layelah reassured me, for she went close up,\nas a boy would go up to a tame elephant, and she stroked his enormous\nback, and the monster bent down his terrible head and seemed pleased.\n\n\"This,\" said Layelah, \"is the way we have of escaping.\"\n\n\"This!\" I exclaimed, doubtfully.\n\n\"Yes,\" said she. \"He is trained to the service. We can mount on his\nback, and he will fly with us wherever I choose to guide him.\"\n\n\"What!\" I exclaimed, as I shrank back--\"fly! Do you mean to say that\nyou will mount this hideous monster, and trust yourself to him?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Layelah, quietly. \"He is very docile. There is\nharness here with which we can guide him. Should you like to see\nhim harnessed?\"\n\n\"Very much indeed,\" said I.\n\nUpon this Layelah walked up to the monster and stroked his breast. The\nhuge athaleb at once lay down upon his belly. Then she brought two\nlong straps like reins, and fastened each to the tip of a projecting\ntip of each wing. Then she fastened a collar around his neck, to which\nthere was attached a grappling-iron.\n\n\"We seat ourselves on his back,\" said Layelah. \"I guide with these\nreins. When we land anywhere I fasten him with the grapple. He looks\ndull now, but if I were to open the gate and remove his muzzle he\nwould be off like the wind.\"\n\n\"But can he carry both of us?\" I asked.\n\n\"Easily,\" said Layelah. \"He can carry three persons without fatigue.\"\n\n\"Could you mount on his back now, and show me how you sit?\"\n\nLayelah readily assented, and mounted with the greatest ease, seating\nherself on the broadest part of the back between the wings.\n\n\"Here,\" said she, \"is room for you. Will you not come?\"\n\nFor an instant I hesitated; but then the sight of her, seated there as\ncoolly as though she were on a chair reassured me, and I climbed up\nalso, though not without a shudder. The touch of the fearful monster\nwas abhorrent but I conquered my disgust and seated myself close\nbehind Layelah. Here she sat, holding the reins in her hands, with the\ngrapple just in front of her; and, seated in this position, she went\non to explain the whole process by which the mighty monster was guided\nthrough the air.\n\nNo sooner had I found myself actually on the back of the athaleb than\nall fear left me. I perceived fully how completely tame he was, and\nhow docile. The reins attached to his wings could be pulled with the\ngreatest ease, Just as one would pull the tiller-ropes of a boat.\n\"Familiarity breeds contempt;\" and now, since the first terror had\npassed away, I felt perfect confidence, and under the encouragement of\nLayelah I had become like some rustic in a menagerie, who at first is\nterrified by the sight of the elephant, but soon gains courage enough\nto mount upon his back. With my new-found courage and presence of mind\nI listened most attentively to all of Layelah's explanations, and\nwatched most closely the construction and fastening of the harness;\nfor the thought had occurred to me that this athaleb might be of avail\nin another way--that if I did not fly with Layelah, I might fly with\nAlmah. This thought was only of a vague and shadowy character--a dim\nsuggestion, the carrying out of which I scarce dared to think\npossible; still, it was in my mind, and had sufficient power over me\nto make me very curious as to the plans of Layelah. I determined to\nfind out where she proposed to go, and how far; to ask her about the\ndangers of the way and the means of sustenance. It seemed, I confess,\nrather unfair to Layelah to find out her plans and use them for\nanother purpose; but then that other purpose was Almah, and to me at\nthat time every device which was for her safety seemed fair and\nhonorable.\n\n\"Here,\" said Layelah--\"here, Atam-or, you see the way of escape. The\nathaleb can carry us both far away to a land where you need never fear\nthat they will put you to death--a land where the people love light\nand life. Whenever you are ready to go, tell me; if you are ready to\ngo now, say so, and at once I will open the door, and we shall soon be\nfar away.\"\n\nShe laid her hand on mine and looked at me earnestly; but I was not to\nbe beguiled into any hasty committal of myself, and so I turned her\nproposal away with a question:\n\n\"How far is it,\" I asked, \"to that land?\"\n\n\"It is too far for one flight,\" said Layelah. \"We go first over the\nsea till we come to a great island, which is called Magones, where\nthere are mountains of fire; there we must rest, and feed the athaleb\non fish, which are to be found on the shore. The athaleb knows his way\nthere well, for he goes there once every season for a certain sacred\nceremony. He has done this for fifty or sixty seasons, and knows his\nway there and back perfectly well. The difficulty will be, when we\nleave Magones, in reaching the land of the Orin.\"\n\n\"The Orin?\" I repeated. \"Who are they?\"\n\n\"They are a people among the Gojin who love life and light. It is\ntheir land that I wish to reach, if possible.\"\n\n\"Where is it?\" I asked, eagerly.\n\n\"I cannot explain,\" said Layelah. \"I can only trust to my own skill,\nand hope to find the place. We may have to pass over different lands\nof the Gojin, and if so we may be in danger.\"\n\n\"What is the reason why the athaleb goes to Magones every season?\"\nI asked.\n\n\"To take there the chief pauper of the season, who has won the prize\nof death by starvation. It is one of the greatest honors among the\nKosekin.\"\n\n\"Is Magones barren?\"\n\n\"It is an island of fire, without anything on it but craggy mountains\nand wild rocks and flowing rivers of fire. It stands almost in the\nmiddle of the sea.\"\n\n\"How can we get away from here?\" I asked, after some silence.\n\n\"From here?--why, I open the gates, and the athaleb flies away; that\nis all.\"\n\n\"But shall we not be prevented?\"\n\n\"Oh no. No one here ever prevents anyone from doing anything. Everyone\nis eager to help his neighbor.\"\n\n\"But if they saw me deliberately mounting the athaleb and preparing\nfor flight, would they not stop me?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nI was amazed at this.\n\n\"But,\" said I, \"am I not a victim--preserved for the great sacrifice?\"\n\n\"You are; but you are free to go where you like, and do what you like.\nYour character of victim makes you most distinguished. It is the\nhighest honor and dignity. All believe that you rejoice in your high\ndignity, and no one dreams that you are anxious to escape.\"\n\n\"But if I did escape, would they not pursue me?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"What would they do for a victim?\"\n\n\"They would wonder at your unaccountable flight, and then choose some\ndistinguished pauper.\"\n\n\"But if I were to stay here, would they not save me from death at\nmy entreaty?\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly not; they would never understand such an entreaty.\nThat's a question of death, the supreme blessing. No one is capable of\nsuch a base act as saving his fellow-man from death. All are eager to\nhelp each other to such a fate.\"\n\n\"But if I were to fly they would not prevent me, and they would not\npursue me?\"\n\n\"Oh no.\"\n\n\"Are there any in the land who are exempt from the sacrifice?\"\n\n\"Oh yes; the Athons, Meleks, and Kohens--these are not worthy of the\nhonor. The artisans and tradesmen are sometimes permitted to attain to\nthis honor; the laborers in greater numbers; but it is the paupers who\nare chiefly favored. And this is a matter of complaint among the rich\nand powerful, that they cannot be sacrificed.\"\n\n\"Well, why couldn't I be made an Athon or a Kohen, and be exempted in\nthat way?\"\n\n\"Oh, that would be too great a dishonor; it would be impossible.\nOn the contrary, the whole people are anxious to honor you to the\nvery uttermost, and to bestow upon you the greatest privileges and\nblessings which can possibly be given. Oh no, it would be impossible\nfor them to allow you to become an Athon or a Kohen. As for me, I am\nMalca, and therefore the lowest in the land--pitied and commiserated\nby the haughty pauper class, who shake their heads at the thought of\none like me. All the people shower upon me incessantly new gifts and\nnew offices. If my present love of light and life were generally\nknown, they would punish me by giving me new contributions of wealth\nand new offices and powers, which I do not want.\"\n\n\"But you love riches, do you not? and you must want them still?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Layelah, \"I do not want them now.\"\n\n\"Why, what do you want?\" I asked.\n\n\"You!\" said she, with a sweet smile.\n\nI said nothing, but tried desperately to think of something that might\ndivert the conversation.\n\nLayelah was silent for a few moments, and then went on in a musing\ntone:\n\n\"As I was saying, I love you, Atam-or, and I hate Almah because you\nlove her. I think Almah is the only human being in all the world that\nI ever really hated; and yet, though I hate her, still, strange to\nsay, I feel as though I should like to give her the immense blessing\nof death, and that is a very strange feeling, indeed, for one of the\nKosekin. Do you understand, Atam-or, what such can possibly be?\"\n\nI did not answer, but turned away the conversation by a violent\neffort.\n\n\"Are there any other athalebs here?\"\n\n\"Oh yes.\"\n\n\"How many?\"\n\n\"Four.\"\n\n\"Are they all as tame as this?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, all quite as tame; there is no difference whatever.\"\n\nUpon this I left the back of the athaleb, and Layelah also descended,\nafter which she proceeded to show me the other monsters. At length she\nunharnessed the athaleb and we left the cavern.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nESCAPE\n\n\nOn the following jom I told everything to Almah. I told her that\nLayelah was urging me to fly with her, and that I had found out all\nabout her plans. I described the athalebs, informed her about the\ndirection which we were to take, the island of fire, and the country\nof the Orin. At this intelligence Almah was filled with delight, and\nfor the first time since we had come to the amir there were smiles\nof joy upon her face. She needed no persuasion. She was ready to set\nforth whenever it was fitting, and to risk everything upon this\nenterprise. She felt as I did, and thought that the wildest attempt\nwas better than this dull inaction.\n\nDeath was before us here, and every jom as it passed only brought it\nnearer. True, we were treated with the utmost kindness, we lived in\nroyal splendor, we had enormous retinues; but all this was a miserable\nmockery, since it all served as the prelude to our inevitable doom.\nFor that doom it was hard indeed to wait. Anything was better. Far\nbetter would it be to risk all the dangers of this unusual and amazing\nflight, to brave the terrors of that drear isle of fire, Magones;\nbetter to perish there of starvation, or to be killed by the hands\nof hostile Gojin, than to wait here and be destroyed at last by\nthe sacrificial knife of these smiling, generous, kind-hearted,\nself-sacrificing fiends; to be killed--ay, and afterward borne to the\ntremendous Mista Kosek.\n\nThere was a difficulty with Layelah that had to be guarded against: in\nthe first place that she might not suspect, and again that we might\nchoose our time of escape when she would not be at all likely to find\nus out. We resolved to make our attempt without any further delay.\nLayelah was with us for the greater part of that jom, and the Kohen\nGadol also gave us much of his company. Layelah did not seem to have\nany suspicions whatever of my secret purpose; for she was as bright,\nas amiable, and as devoted to me as ever, while the Kohen Gadol sought\nas before to make himself agreeable to Almah. I did not think fit\nto tell her about Layelah's proposal, and therefore she was quite\nignorant of the secret plans of the Kohen Gadol, evidently attributing\nhis attention to the unfailing amiability of the Kosekin.\n\nLayelah came again after Almah had retired, and spent the time in\ntrying to persuade me to fly with her. The beautiful girl was\ncertainly never more engaging, nor was she ever more tender. Had it\nnot been for Almah it would have been impossible to resist such sweet\npersuasions; but as it was I did resist. Layelah, however, was not at\nall discouraged, nor did she lose any of her amiability; but when she\ntook leave it was with a smile and sweet words of forgiveness on her\nlips for what she called my cruelty. After she left I remained for a\ntime with a painful sense of helplessness. The fact is my European\ntraining did not fit me for encountering such a state of things as\nexisted among the Kosekin. It's very easy to be faithful to one's own\ntrue-love in England, when other fair ladies hold aloof and wait to\nbe sought; but here among the Kosekin, women have as much liberty in\nmaking love as men, and there is no law or custom about it. If a woman\nchooses she can pay the most desperate attentions, and play the part\nof a distracted lover to her heart's content. In most cases the\nwomen actually take the initiative, as they are more impressible and\nimpulsive than men; and so it was that Layelah made me the object of\nher persistent assault--acting all the time, too, in accordance with\nthe custom of the country, and thus having no thought whatever of\nindelicacy, since, according to the Kosekin, she was acting simply in\naccordance with the rights of every woman. Now, where a woman is urged\nby one ardent lover to dismiss her other lover, she may sometimes find\nit difficult to play her part satisfactorily; but in my case I did not\nplay my part satisfactorily at all; the ordeal was too hard, and I was\nutterly unable to show to Layelah that firmness and decision of\ncharacter which the occasion demanded.\n\nYet, after all, the ordeal at last ended. Layelah left, as I have\nsaid, with sweet words of forgiveness on her lips, and I after a time\nsucceeded in regaining my presence of mind.\n\nAlmah was waiting, and she soon joined me. We gathered a few articles\nfor the journey, the chief of which were my rifle and pistol, which\nI had not used here, and then we set forth. Leaving our apartments\nwe traversed the long passages, and at length came to the cavern of\nthe athalebs. We met several people on the way, who looked at us\nwith smiles, but made no other sign. It was evident that they had no\ncommission to watch us, and that thus far Layelah's information was\ncorrect.\n\nUpon entering the cavern of the athalebs my first feeling was one of\nhelplessness; for I had no confidence whatever in my own powers of\nmanaging these awful monsters, nor did I feel sure that I could\nharness them; but the emergency was a pressing one, and there was no\nhelp for it. I had seen where Layelah had left the harness, and now my\nchief desire was to secure one of the athalebs. The faint light served\nto disclose nothing but gloom; and I waited for a while, hoping that\none of them would come forward as before. But waiting did no good,\nfor no movement was made, and I had to try what I could do myself to\nrouse them. So I walked farther in toward the back part of the cavern,\npeering through the gloom, while Almah remained near the entrance.\n\nAs I advanced I heard a slight noise, as of someone moving. I thought\nit was one of the athalebs, and walked on farther, peering through the\ngloom, when suddenly I came full upon a man who was busy at some work\nwhich I could not make out. For a moment I stood in amazement and\ndespair, for it seemed as though all was lost, and as if this man\nwould at once divine my intent. While I stood thus he turned and gave\nme a very courteous greeting, after which, in the usual manner of the\nKosekin, he asked me with much amiability what he could do for me. I\nmuttered something about seeing the athalebs, upon which he informed\nme that he would show them to me with pleasure.\n\nHe went on to say that he had recently been raised from the low\nposition of Athon to that of Feeder of the Athalebs, a post involving\nduties like those of ostlers or grooms among us, but which here\nindicated high rank and honor. He was proud of his title of \"Epet,\"\nwhich means servant, and more than usually obliging. I at once took\nadvantage of his complaisance, and requested him to show me the\nathalebs. Upon this he led the way farther on, where I could see\nthrough the gloom the shadowy outlines of four monsters, all of which\nwere resting in an upright posture against the wall, with their claws\nfixed on a shelf of rock. They looked more than ever like dragons, or\nrather like enormous bats, for their wings were disclosed hanging in\nloose leathern folds.\n\n\"Can they be roused,\" I asked, \"and made to move?\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said the Epet, and without waiting for any further request\nhe proceeded to pull at the loose fan-like wing of the nearest one.\nThe monster drew himself together, gave a flutter with his wings, and\nthen moved back from the wall.\n\n\"Make him walk,\" said I, eagerly.\n\nThe Epet at this pulled upon his wing once more, and the athaleb moved\nforward.\n\n\"Bring him to the portal, so that I may see him,\" said I.\n\nThe Epet, still holding the athaleb's wing, pulled at him, and thus\nguided him toward the portal. I was amazed at the docility of this\nterrific monster; yet, after all, I thought that it was no more\nastonishing than the docility of the elephant, which in like manner\nallows itself to be guided by the slightest pressure. A child may lead\na vast elephant with ease, and here with equal ease the Epet led the\nathaleb. He led him up near to the portal, where the aurora light\nbeamed through far brighter than the brightest moon, and disclosed all\nthe vast proportions of the monster. I stood and looked on for some\ntime in silence, quite at a loss what to do next.\n\nAnd now Layelah's words occurred to me as to the perfect willingness\nof the Kosekin to do anything which one might wish. She had insisted\non it that they would not prevent our flight, and had given me to\nunderstand that they would even assist me if I should ask them. This\nis what now occurred to me, and I determined to make a trial. So I\nsaid:\n\n\"I should like to fly in the air on the athaleb. Will you harness\nhim?\"\n\nI confess it was with some trepidation that I said this, but the\nfeeling was soon dissipated. The Epet heard my words with perfect\ncoolness, as though they conveyed the most natural request in the\nworld, and then proceeded to obey me, just as at home a servant might\nhear and obey his master, who might say, \"I should like to take a\nride; will you harness the bay mare?\"\n\nSo the Epet proceeded to harness the athaleb, and I watched him in\nsilence; but it was the silence of deep suspense, and my heart\nthrobbed painfully. There was yet much to be risked. The gates had\nto be opened. Others might interfere. Layelah might come. All these\nthoughts occurred to me as I watched the Epet; and though the labor of\nharnessing the athaleb was simple and soon performed, still the time\nseemed long. So the collar was secured around the neck of the athaleb,\nwith the grapple attached, and the lines were fastened to the wings,\nand then Almah and I mounted.\n\nThe Epet now stood waiting for further orders.\n\n\"Open the gates,\" said I.\n\nThe Epet did so.\n\nAlmah was seated on the back of the athaleb before me, holding on to\nthe coarse mane; I, just behind, held the reins in my hand. The gates\nwere opened wide. A few people outside, roused by the noise of the\nopening gates, stood and looked on. They had evidently no other\nfeeling but curiosity.\n\nAll was now ready and the way was open, but there was an unexpected\ndifficulty--the athaleb would not start, and I did not know how to\nmake him. I had once more to apply for help to the Epet.\n\n\"How am I to make him start?\" I asked.\n\n\"Pull at the collar to make him start, and pull at both reins to make\nhim stop,\" said the Epet.\n\nUpon this I pulled at the collar.\n\nThe athaleb obeyed at once. He rose almost erect, and moved out\nthrough the gate. It was difficult to hold on, but we did so. On\nreaching the terrace outside, the athaleb expanded his vast wings,\nwhich spread out over a space of full fifty feet, and then with\nvigorous motions raised himself in the air.\n\nIt was a moment full of terror to both of us; the strange sensation of\nrising in the air, the quivering muscles of the athaleb at the working\nof the enormous pinions, the tremendous display of strength, all\ncombined to overwhelm me with a sense of utter helplessness. With one\nhand I clung to the stiff mane of the monster; with the other I held\nAlmah, who was also grasping the athaleb's hair; and thus for some\ntime all thought was taken up in the one purpose of holding on. But at\nlength the athaleb lay in the air in a perfectly horizontal position;\nthe beat of the wings grew more slow and even, the muscular exertion\nmore steady and sustained. We both began to regain some degree of\nconfidence, and at length I raised myself up and looked around.\n\nIt did not seem long since we had left; but already the city was far\nbehind, rising with its long, crescent terraces, sparkling and\ntwinkling with innumerable lights. We had passed beyond the bay; the\nharbor was behind us, the open sea before us, the deep water beneath.\nThe athaleb flew low, not more than a hundred feet above the water,\nand maintained that distance all the time. It seemed, indeed, as if he\nmight drop into the water at any time; but this was only fancy, for he\nwas perfect master of all his movement and his flight was swift and\nwell sustained.\n\nOverhead the sky was filled with the glory of the aurora beams, which\nspread everywhere, flashing out from the zenith and illuminating the\nearth with a glow brighter than that of the brightest moon; beneath,\nthe dark waters of the sea extended, with the waves breaking into\nfoam, and traversed by galleys, by merchant-ships, and by the navies\nof the Kosekin. Far away the surface of the sea spread, with that\nmarvellous appearance of an endless ascent, as though for a thousand\nmiles, rising thus until it terminated half-way up the sky; and so\nit rose up on every side, so that I seemed to be at the bottom of\na basin-shaped world--an immense and immeasurable hollow--a world\nunparalleled and unintelligible. Far away, at almost infinite\ndistances, arose the long lines of mountains, which, crowned with ice,\ngleamed in the aurora light, and seemed like a barrier that made\nforever impossible all ingress and egress.\n\nOn and on we sped. At length we grew perfectly accustomed to the\nsituation, the motion was so easy and our seats were so secure. There\nwere no obstacles in our way, no roughness along our path; for that\npathway was the smooth air, and in such a path there could be no\ninterruption, no jerk or jar. After the first terror had passed there\nremained no longer any necessity for holding on--we could sit and look\naround with perfect freedom; and at length I rose to my feet, and\nAlmah stood beside me, and thus we stood for a long time, with all\nour souls kindled into glowing enthusiasm by the excitement of that\nadventurous flight, and the splendors of that unequalled scene.\n\nAt length the aurora light grew dim. Then came forth the stars,\nglowing and burning in the black sky. Beneath there was nothing\nvisible but the darkness of the water, spotted with phosphorescent\npoints, while all around a wall of gloom arose which shut out from\nview the distant shores.\n\nSuddenly I was aware of a noise like the beat of vast wings, and these\nwings were not those of our athaleb. At first I thought it was the\nfluttering of a sail, but it was too regular and too long continued\nfor that. At length I saw through the gloom a vast shadowy form in the\nair behind us, and at once the knowledge of the truth flashed upon me.\nIt was another monster flying in pursuit!\n\nWere we pursued? Were there men on his back? Should I resist? I held\nmy rifle poised, and was resolved to resist at all hazards. Almah saw\nit all, and said nothing. She perceived the danger, and in her eyes I\nsaw that she, like me, would prefer death to surrender. The monster\ncame nearer and nearer, until at last I could see that he was alone,\nand that none were on his back. But now another fear arose. He might\nattack our athaleb, and in that way endanger us. He must be prevented\nfrom coming nearer; yet to fire the rifle was a serious matter. I had\nonce before I learned the danger of firing under such circumstances,\nwhen my opmahera had fled in terror at the report, and did not wish to\nexperience the danger which might arise from a panic-stricken athaleb;\nand so as I stood there I waved my arms and gesticulated violently.\nThe pursuing athaleb seemed frightened at such an unusual occurrence,\nfor he veered off, and soon was lost in the darkness.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nTHE ISLAND OF FIRE\n\n\nAt last there appeared before us what seemed like a long line of\ndull-red fires, and as we looked we could see bursts of flame at\nfitful intervals, which shone out for a few moments and then died\naway. Upon this now our whole attention was fixed; for it seemed as\nthough we were approaching our destination, and that this place was\nthe Island of Fire--a name which, from present appearances, was fully\njustified. As we went on and drew steadily nearer, the mass of glowing\nfire grew larger and brighter, and what at first had seemed a line was\nbroken up into different parts, one of which far surpassed the others.\nThis was higher in the air, and its shape was that of a long, thin,\nsloping line, with a burning, glowing globule at each end. It seemed\nlike lava running down from the crater of a volcano, and this\nappearance was made certainty on a nearer approach; for we saw at the\nupper point, which seemed the crater, an outburst of flame, followed\nby a new flow of the fiery stream. In other places there were similar\nfires, but they were less bright, either because they were smaller or\nmore remote.\n\nAt length we heard beneath us the roar of breakers, and saw long white\nlines of surf beating upon the shore. Our athaleb now descended and\nalighted; we clambered to the ground, and I, taking the grapple, fixed\nit securely between two sharp rocks. We were at last on Magones, the\nIsland of Fire.\n\nThe brightness of the aurora light had left us, but it needed not\nthis to show us the dismal nature of the land to which we had come.\nIt was a land of horror, where there was nothing but the abomination\nof desolation--a land overstrewn with blasted fragments of fractured\nlava-blocks, intermixed with sand, from which there arose black\nprecipices and giant mountains that poured forth rivers of fire and\nshowers of ashes and sheets of flame. A tremendous peak arose before\nus, with a crest of fire and sides streaked with red torrents of\nmolten lava; between us and it there spread away a vast expanse of\nimpassable rocks--a scene of ruin and savage wildness which cannot be\ndescribed, and all around was the same drear and appalling prospect.\nHere in the night-season--the season of darkness and of awful\ngloom--we stood in this land of woe; and not one single sign appeared\nof life save the life that we had brought with us. As for food, it was\nvain to think of it. To search after it would be useless. It seemed,\nindeed, impossible to move from the spot where we were. Every moment\npresented some new discovery which added to the horror of Magones.\n\nBut Almah was weary, for our flight had been long, and she wished to\nrest. So I found a place for her where there was some sand between\ntwo rocks, and here she lay down and went to sleep. I sat at a little\ndistance off on a shelf of the rock, with my back against it, and\nhere, after a little time, I also went to sleep.\n\nAt length we awoke. But what a waking! There was no morning dawn, no\nblessed returning light to greet our eyes. We opened our eyes to the\nsame scenes upon which we had closed them, and the darkness was still\ndeep and dense around us. Over us both there was a sense of utter\ndepression, and I was so deeply plunged into it that I found it\nimpossible to rouse myself, even for the sake of saying words of cheer\nto Almah. I had brought a few fragments of food, and upon these we\nmade our breakfast; but there was the athaleb to feed, and for him I\nfound nothing, nor could I think of anything--unless he could feed\nupon rocks and sand. Yet food for him was a matter of the highest\nconsequence, for he was all our support and stay and hope; and if the\nmonster were deprived of food he might turn upon us and satisfy upon\nus his ravenous appetite. These thoughts were painful indeed, and\nadded to my despondency.\n\nSuddenly I heard the sound of running water. I started away toward the\nplace from which the sound came, and found, only a little distance\noff, a small brook trickling along on its way to the shore. I called\nAlmah, and we both drank and were refreshed.\n\nThis showed an easy way to get to the shore, and I determined to go\nthere to see if there were any fish to be found. Shell-fish might be\nthere, or the carcasses of dead fish thrown up by the sea, upon which\nthe athaleb might feed. I left my pistol with Almah, telling her to\nfire it if she heard me fire, for I was afraid of losing my way,\nand therefore took this precaution. I left it lying on the rock\nfull-cocked, and directed her to point it in the air and pull the\ntrigger. It was necessary to take these precautions, as of course she\nwas quite ignorant of its nature. After this I left her and tried to\nfollow the torrent.\n\nThis, however, I soon found to be impossible, for the brook on\nreaching a huge rock plunged underneath it and became lost to view. I\nthen went toward the shore as well as I could--now climbing over sharp\nrocks, now going round them, until at length after immense labor I\nsucceeded in reaching the water. Here the scene was almost as wild\nas the one I had left. There was no beach whatever--nothing but a\nvast extent of wild fragments of fractured lava-blocks, which were\nevidently the result of some comparatively recent convulsion of\nnature, for their edges were still sharp, and the water had not worn\neven those which were within its grasp to anything like roundness,\nor to anything else than the jagged and shattered outlines which had\noriginally belonged to them. All the shore thus consisted of vast\nrocky blocks, over which the sea beat in foam.\n\nEager to find something, I toiled along this rocky shore for a long\ndistance, but without seeing any change. I was unwilling to go back\nbaffled, yet I was at length compelled to do so. But the necessity of\nfeeding the athaleb was pressing, and I saw that our only course now\nwould be to mount him again, leave this place, and seek some other.\nBut where could we go? That I could not imagine, and could only\nconclude to trust altogether to the instinct of the athaleb, which\nmight guide him to places where he might obtain food. Such a course\nwould involve great risk for we might be carried into the midst of\nvast flocks of these monsters; yet there was nothing else to be done.\n\nI now retraced my steps, and went for a long time near the sea. At\nlength I found a place where the walking was somewhat easier, and went\nin this way up into the island and away from the sea. It seemed to\nlead in the direction where I wished to go. At length it seemed as if\nI had walked far enough, yet I could see no signs of Almah. I shouted,\nbut there was no answer. I shouted again and again, but with the like\nresult. Then I fired my rifle and listened. In response there came the\nreport of the pistol far away behind me. It was evident that in coming\nback along the shore I had passed by the place where Almah was. There\nwas nothing now left but to retrace my steps and this I accordingly\ndid. I went back to the shore, and returned on my steps, shouting all\nthe time, until at length I was rejoiced to hear the answering shout\nof Almah. After this it was easy to reach her.\n\nWe now took up the grapple and once more mounted. The athaleb, eager\nto be off, raised himself quickly in the air, and soon our late\nresting-place was far behind. His flight was now different from what\nit was before. Then he stood off in one straight line for a certain\nfixed destination, as though under some guidance; for though I did not\ndirect him, still his long training had taught him to fly to Magones.\nBut now training and guidance were both wanting, and the athaleb was\nleft to the impulse of his hunger and the guidance of his instinct; so\nhe flew no longer in one undeviating straight line, but rose high, and\nbent his head down low, and flew and soared in vast circles, even as I\nhave seen a vulture or a condor sweep about while searching for food.\nAll the while we were drawing farther and farther away from the spot\nwhich we had left.\n\nWe passed the lofty volcano; we saw more plainly the rivers of molten\nlava; we passed vast cliffs and bleak mountains, all of which were\nmore terrific than all that we had left behind. Now the darkness\nlessened, for the aurora was brightening in the sky, and gathering up\nswiftly and gloriously all its innumerable beams, and flashing forth\nits lustrous glow upon the world. To us this was equal to the return\nof day; it was like a blessed dawn. Light had come, and we rejoiced\nand were exceeding glad.\n\nNow we saw before us, far beyond the black precipices, a broad bay\nwith sloping shores, and a wide beach which seemed like a beach of\nsand. The surf broke here, but beyond the surf was the gentle sandy\ndeclivity, and beyond this there appeared the shores, still rocky and\nbarren and desolate, but far preferable to what we had left behind.\nFar away in the interior arose lofty mountains and volcanoes, while\nbehind us flamed the burning peak which we had passed.\n\nHere the athaleb wheeled in long, circuitous flights, which grew lower\nand lower, until at length he descended upon the sandy beach, where\nI saw a vast sea-monster lying dead. It had evidently been thrown up\nhere by the sea. It was like one of those monsters which I had seen\nfrom the galley of the Kohen at the time of the sacred hunt. By this\nthe athaleb descended, and at once began to devour it, tearing out\nvast masses of flesh, and exhibiting such voracity and strength of\njaw that I could scarcely bear to look upon the sight. I fastened\nthe grapple securely to the head of the dead monster, and leaving\nthe athaleb to feed upon it, Almah and I went up the beach.\n\nOn our way we found rocks covered with sea-weed, and here we sought\nafter shell-fish. Our search was at length rewarded, for suddenly I\nstumbled upon a place where I found some lobsters. I grasped two of\nthese, but the others escaped. Here at last I had found signs of life,\nbut they were of the sea rather than of the shore. Delighted with my\nprey, I hastened to Almah to show them to her. She recognized them at\nonce, and I saw that they were familiar to her. I then spoke of eating\nthem, but at this proposal she recoiled in horror. She could not give\nany reason for her repugnance, but merely said that among her people\nthey were regarded as something equivalent to vermin, and I found that\nshe would no more think of eating one than I would think of eating a\nrat. Upon this I had to throw them away, and we once more resumed our\nsearch.\n\nAt last we came to a place where numbers of dead fish lay on the sand.\nNearer the water they were more fresh, and not at all objectionable.\nI picked up a few which looked like our common smelt, and found that\nAlmah had no objection to these. But now the question arose how to\ncook them; neither of us could eat them raw. A fire was necessary, yet\na fire was impossible; for on the whole island there was probably not\none single combustible thing. Our discovery, therefore, seemed to have\ndone us but little good, and we seemed destined to starvation, when\nfortunately a happy thought suggested itself. In walking along I saw\nfar away the glow of some lava which had flowed to the shore at the\nend of the sandy beach, and was probably cooling down at the water's\nedge. Here, then, was a natural fire, which might serve us better than\nany contrivance of our own, and toward this we at once proceeded. It\nwas about two miles away; but the beach was smooth, and we reached\nthe place without any difficulty.\n\nHere we found the edge of that lava flood which seemed eternally\ndescending from the crater beyond. The edge which was nearest the\nwater was black; and the liquid fire, as it rolled down, curled over\nthis in a fantastic shape, cooling and hardening into the form which\nit thus assumed. Here, after some search, I found a crevice where I\ncould approach the fire, and I laid the fish upon a crimson rock,\nwhich was cooling and hardening into the shape of a vast ledge of\nlava. In this way, by the aid of nature, the fish were broiled, and\nwe made our repast.\n\nThere was nothing here to invite a longer stay, and we soon returned\nto the athaleb. We found the monster, gorged with food, asleep,\nresting upon his hind legs, with his breast supported against the vast\ncarcass. Almah called it a jantannin. It was about sixty feet in\nlength and twenty in thickness, with a vast horny head, ponderous\njaws, and back covered with scales. Its eyes were of prodigious size,\nand it had the appearance of a crocodile, with the vast size of a\nwhale. It was unlike a crocodile, however; for it had fins rather than\npaws, and must have been as clumsy on the land as a seal or a walrus.\nIt lay on its side, and the athaleb had fed itself from the uncovered\nflesh of its belly.\n\nThere was nothing here to induce us to stay, and so we wandered along\nthe beach in the other direction. On our right was the bay; on our\nleft the rocky shore, which, beginning at the beach, ran back into\nthe country, a waste of impassable rocks, where not a tree or plant\nor blade of grass relieved the appalling desolation. Once or twice\nwe made an attempt to penetrate into the country, where openings\nappeared. These openings seemed like the beds of dried-up torrents. We\nwere able to walk but a few paces for invariably we would come to some\nimmense blocks of rock, which barred all farther progress. In this\nway we explored the beach for miles, until it terminated in a savage\npromontory that rose abruptly from the sea against which the huge\nbillows broke in thunder.\n\nThen we retraced our steps, and again reached the spot where the\nathaleb was asleep by the jantannin. Almah was now too weary to walk\nany farther, nor was it desirable to do so; for, indeed, we had\ntraversed all that could be visited. On one side of the beach was the\nsea, on the other the impassable rocks; at one end the promontory, at\nthe other the lava fires. There was nothing more for us to do but to\nwait here until the athaleb should awake, and then our actions would\ndepend upon what we might now decide.\n\nThis was the question that was now before us, and this we began to\nconsider. We both felt the most unspeakable aversion for the island,\nand to remain here any longer was impossible. We would once more have\nto mount the athaleb, and proceed to some other shore. But where?\nAh! there was the question! Not on the island, for it did not seem\npossible that in all its extent there could be one single spot capable\nof affording a resting-place. Layelah's information with regard to\nMagones had made that much plain. I had not taken in her full meaning,\nbut now mine eyes had seen it. Yet where else could we go? Almah could\nnot tell where under the sky lay that land which she loved; I could\nnot guess where to go to find the land of the Orin. Even if I did\nknow, I did not feel able to guide the course of the athaleb; and I\nfelt sure that if we were to mount again, the mighty monster would\nwing his flight back to the very place from which we had escaped--the\namir. These thoughts weighed down our spirits. We felt that we had\ngained nothing by our flight, and that our future was dark indeed. The\nonly hope left us was that we might be able to guide the course of the\nathaleb in some different direction altogether, so that we should not\nbe carried back to the Kosekin.\n\nAnd now, worn out by the long fatigues of this jom, we thought of\nsleep. Almah lay down upon the sand, and I seated myself, leaning\nagainst a rock, a little distance off, having first reloaded my rifle\nand pistol.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nRECAPTURE\n\n\nHow long I slept I do not know; but in the midst of my sleep there\nsounded voices, which at first intermingled themselves with my dreams,\nbut gradually became separate and sounded from without, rousing me\nfrom my slumbers. I opened my eyes drowsily, but the sight that I saw\nwas so amazing that in an instant all sleep left me. I started to my\nfeet, and gazed in utter bewilderment upon the scene before me.\n\nThe aurora light was shining with unusual brilliancy, and disclosed\neverything--the sea, the shore, the athaleb, the jantannin, the\npromontory, all--more plainly and more luminously than before; but\nit was not any of these things that now excited my attention and\nrendered me dumb. I saw Almah standing there at a little distance,\nwith despairing face, surrounded by a band of armed Kosekin; while\nimmediately before me, regarding me with a keen glance and an air of\ntriumph, was Layelah.\n\n\"Ataesmzori alonla,\" said she, with a sweet smile, giving me the\nusual salutation of the Kosekin.\n\nI was too bewildered to say a word, and stood mute as before, looking\nfirst at her and then at Almah.\n\nThe sight of Almah a prisoner once more, surrounded by the Kosekin,\nexcited me to madness. I seized my rifle, and raised it as if to take\naim; but Almah, who understood the movement, cried to me:\n\n\"Put down your sepet-ram, Atam-or! you can do nothing for me. The\nKosekin are too numerous.\"\n\n\"Sepet-ram!\" said Layelah; \"what do you mean by that? If your\nsepet-ram has any power, do not try to use it, Atam-or, or else\nI shall have to order my followers to give to Almah the blessing of\ndeath.\"\n\nAt this my rifle was lowered: the whole truth flashed upon me, and I\nsaw, too, the madness of resistance. I might kill one or two, but the\nrest would do as Layelah said, and I should speedily be disarmed. Well\nI knew how powerless were the thunders of my fire-arms to terrify\nthese Kosekin; for the prospect of death would only rouse them to a\nmad enthusiasm, and they would all rush upon me as they would rush\nupon a jantannin--to slay and be slain. The odds were too great. A\ncrowd of Europeans could be held in check far more easily than these\ndeath-loving Kosekin. The whole truth was thus plain: we were\nprisoners, and were at their mercy.\n\nLayelah showed no excitement or anger whatever. She looked and spoke\nin her usual gracious and amiable fashion, with a sweet smile on her\nface.\n\n\"We knew,\" said she, \"that you would be in distress in this desolate\nplace, and that you would not know where to go from Magones; and so we\nhave come, full of the most eager desire to relieve your wants. We\nhave brought with us food and drink, and are ready to do everything\nfor you that you may desire. We have had great trouble in finding you,\nand have coursed over the shores for vast distances, and far over the\ninterior, but our athalebs found you at last by their scent. And we\nrejoice to have found you in time, and that you are both so well, for\nwe have been afraid that you had been suffering. Nay, Atam-or, do not\nthank us; thanks are distasteful to the Kosekin: these brave followers\nof mine will all be amply rewarded for this, for they will all be made\npaupers; but as for myself, I want no higher reward than the\ndelightful thought that I have saved you from suffering.\"\n\nThe beautiful, smiling Layelah, who addressed me in this way with her\nsweet voice, was certainly not to be treated as an enemy. Against her\na rifle could not be levelled; she would have looked at me with the\nsame sweet smile, and that smile would have melted all my resolution.\nNor could I even persist in my determination to remain. Remain! For\nwhat? For utter despair! And yet where else could we go?\n\n\"You do not know where lie the lands of the Orin,\" said Layelah. \"The\nathaleb does not know. You could not guide him if you did know. You\nare helpless on his back. The art of driving an athaleb is difficult,\nand cannot be learned without long and severe practice. My fear was\nthat the athaleb might break away from you and return, leaving you to\nperish here. Had you tried to leave this place he would have brought\nyou back to the amir.\"\n\nTo this I said nothing--partly because it was so true that I had no\nanswer to make, and partly also out of deep mortification and\ndejection. My pride was wounded at being thus so easily baffled by a\ngirl like Layelah, and all my grief was stirred by the sadness of\nAlmah. In her eyes there seemed even now the look of one who sees\ndeath inevitable, and the glance she gave to me was like an eternal\nfarewell.\n\nAlmah now spoke, addressing herself to Layelah.\n\n\"Death,\" said she, in a voice of indescribable mournfulness, \"is\nbetter here than with you. We would rather die here than go back. Let\nus, I pray you, receive the blessing of death here. Let us be paupers\nand exiles, and die on Magones.\"\n\nLayelah heard this, and stood for a moment in deep thought.\n\n\"No one but a stranger,\" said she at length, \"would ask such a favor\nas that. Do you not know that what you ask is among the very highest\nhonors of the Kosekin? Who am I that I can venture to grant such a\nrequest as that? Ask for anything in my power, and I will be glad to\ngrant it. I have already arranged that you shall be separated from\nAtam-or; and that, surely, is a high privilege. I might consent to\nbind you hand and foot, after the manner of the more distinguished\nAsirin; you may also be blindfolded if you wish it. I might even\npromise, after we return to the amir, to keep you confined in utter\ndarkness, with barely sufficient food to keep you alive until the\ntime of the sacrifice; in short, there is no blessing known among\nthe Kosekin that I will not give so long as it is in my power. And\nso, beloved Almah,\" continued Layelah, \"you have every reason for\nhappiness; you have all the highest blessings known among the Kosekin:\nseparation from your lover, poverty, want, darkness; and, finally, the\nprospect of inevitable death ever before you as the crowning glory of\nyour lot.\"\n\nThese words seemed to the Kosekin the very excess of magnanimity, and\ninvoluntary murmurs of admiration escaped them; although it is just\npossible that they murmured at the greatness of the favor that was\noffered. But to me it sounded like fiendish mockery, and to Almah it\nsounded the same; for a groan escaped her, her fortitude gave way, she\nsank on her knees, buried her head in her hands, and wept.\n\n\"Almah,\" cried I, in a fury, \"we will not go back--we will not be\nseparated! I will destroy all the athalebs, and we shall all perish\nhere together. At least, you and I will not be separated.\"\n\nAt this Almah started up.\n\n\"No, no,\" said she--\"no; let us go back. Here we have nothing but\ndeath.\"\n\n\"But we have death also at the amir, and a more terrible one,\" said I.\n\n\"If you kill the athalebs,\" said Layelah, \"I will give Almah the\nblessing of death.\"\n\nAt this I recoiled in horror, and my resolution again gave way.\n\n\"You have some mysterious power of conferring death,\" continued\nLayelah, \"with what Almah calls your sepet-ram; but do not kill the\nathalebs, for it will do you no good. Almah would then receive the\nblessing of death. My followers, these noble Kosekin, would rejoice in\nthus gaining exile and death on Magones. As for myself, it would be my\nhighest happiness to be here alone with you. With you I should live\nfor a few sweet joms, and with you I should die; so go on--kill the\nathalebs if you wish.\"\n\n\"Do not!\" cried Almah--\"do not! There is no hope. We are their\nprisoners, and our only hope is in submission.\"\n\nUpon this all further thought of resistance left me, and I stood in\nsilence, stolidly waiting for their action. As I looked around I\nnoticed a movement near the jantannin, and saw several athalebs\nthere, which were devouring its flesh. I now went over to Almah and\nspoke with her. We were both full of despair. It seemed as though we\nmight never meet again. We were to be separated now; but who could say\nwhether we should be permitted to see each other after leaving this\nplace? We had but little to say. I held her in my arms, regardless of\nthe presence of others; and these, seeing our emotion, at once moved\naway, with the usual delicacy of the Kosekin, and followed Layelah to\nthe jantannin to see about the athalebs.\n\nAt last our interview was terminated. Layelah came and informed us\nthat all was ready for our departure. We walked sadly to the place,\nand found the athalebs crouched to receive their riders. There were\nfour beside ours. Layelah informed me that I was to go with her, and\nAlmah was to go on another athaleb. I entreated her to let Almah go\nwith me; but she declined, saying that our athaleb could only carry\ntwo, as he seemed fatigued, and it would not be safe to overload him\nfor so long a flight. I told her that Almah and I could go together on\nthe same athaleb; but she objected on the ground of my ignorance of\ndriving. And so, remonstrances and objections being alike useless, I\nwas compelled to yield to the arrangements that had been made. Almah\nmounted on another athaleb. I mounted with Layelah, and then the great\nmonsters expanded their mighty wings, rose into the air, and soon were\nspeeding over the waters.\n\nWe went on in silence for some time. I was too despondent to say a\nword, and all my thoughts turned toward Almah, who was now separated\nfrom me--perhaps forever. The other athalebs went ahead, at long\nintervals apart, flying in a straight line, while ours was last.\nLayelah said nothing. She sat in front of me; her back was turned\ntoward me; she held in her hands the reins, which hung quite loose at\nfirst, but after a while she drew them up, and seemed to be directing\nour course. For some time I did not notice anything in particular, for\nmy eyes were fixed upon the athaleb immediately before us, upon which\nwas seated the loved form of Almah, which I could easily recognize.\nBut our athaleb flew slowly, and I noticed that we were falling\nbehind. I said this to Layelah, but she only remarked that it was\nfatigued with its long journey. To this I objected that the others had\nmade as long a journey, and insisted that she should draw nearer. This\nshe at first refused to do; but at length, as I grew persistent, she\ncomplied, or pretended to do so. In spite of this, however, we again\nfell behind, and I noticed that this always happened when the reins\nwere drawn tight. On making this discovery I suddenly seized both\nreins and let them trail loose, whereupon the athaleb at once showed a\nperceptible increase of speed, which proved that there was no fatigue\nin him whatever. This I said to Layelah.\n\nShe acquiesced with a sweet smile, and taking the reins again, she sat\naround so as to face me, and said:\n\n\"You are very quick. It is no use to try to deceive you, Atam-or: I\nwish to fall behind.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"To save you.\"\n\n\"To save me?\"\n\n\"Yes. I can take you to the land of the Orin. Now is the time to\nescape from death. If you go back you must surely die; but now, if you\nwill be guided by me, I can take you to the land of the Orin. There\nthey all hate death, they love life, they live in the light. There you\nwill find those who are like yourself; there you can love and be\nhappy.\"\n\n\"But what of Almah?\" I asked.\n\nLayelah made a pretty gesture of despair.\n\n\"You are always talking of Almah,\" said she. \"What is Almah to you?\nShe is cold, dull, sad! She never will speak. Let her go.\"\n\n\"Never!\" said I. \"Almah is worth more than all the world to me.\"\n\nLayelah sighed.\n\n\"I can never, never, never,\" said she, \"get from you the least little\nbit of a kind word--even after all that I have done for you, and when\nyou know that I would lie down and let you trample me under your feet\nif it gave you any pleasure.\"\n\n\"Oh, that is not the question at all,\" said I. \"You are asking me to\nleave Almah--to be false to her--and I cannot.\"\n\n\"Among the Kosekin,\" said Layelah, \"it is the highest happiness for\nlovers to give one another up.\"\n\n\"I am not one of the Kosekin,\" said I. \"I cannot let her go away--I\ncannot let her go back to the amir--to meet death alone. If she dies\nshe shall see me by her side, ready to die with her.\"\n\nAt this Layelah laughed merrily.\n\n\"Is it possible,\" said she, \"that you believe that? Do you not know\nthat if Almah goes back alone she will not die?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Why, she can only die when you are in her company. She has lived for\nyears among us, and we have waited for someone to appear whom she\nmight love, so that we might give them both the blessing of death. If\nthat one should leave her, Almah could not receive the blessing. She\nwould be compelled to live longer, until some other lover should\nappear. Now, by going with me to the land of the Orin, you will save\nAlmah's life--and as for Almah, why, she will be happy--and dear papa\nis quite willing to marry her. You must see, therefore, dear Atam-or,\nthat my plan is the very best that can be thought of for all of us,\nand above all for Almah.\"\n\nThis, however, was intolerable; and I could not consent to desert\nAlmah, even if by doing so I should save her life. My own nature\nrevolted from it. Still it was not a thing which I could dismiss on\nthe instant. The safety of Almah's life, indeed, required\nconsideration; but then the thought came of her wonder at my\ndesertion. Would she not think me false? Would not the thought of my\nfalsity be worse than death?\n\n\"No,\" said I, \"I will not leave her--not even to save her life. Even\namong us there are things worse than death. Almah would rather die by\nthe sacrificial knife than linger on with a broken heart.\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" said Layelah, sweetly; \"she will rejoice that you are safe.\nDo you not see that while you are together death is inevitable, but if\nyou separate you may both live and be happy?\"\n\n\"But she will think me dead,\" said I, as a new idea occurred. \"She\nwill think that some accident has befallen me.\"\n\n\"Oh no, she won't,\" said Layelah; \"she will think that you have gone\noff with me.\"\n\n\"Then that will be worse, and I would rather die, and have her die\nwith me, than live and have her think me false.\"\n\n\"You are very, very obstinate,\" said Layelah, sweetly.\n\nI made no reply. During this conversation I had been too intent upon\nLayelah's words to notice the athalebs before me; but now as I looked\nup I saw that we had fallen far behind, and that Layelah had headed\nour athaleb in a new direction. Upon this I once more snatched the\nreins from her, and tried to return to our former course. This,\nhowever, I was utterly unable to do.\n\nLayelah laughed.\n\n\"You will have to let me guide our course,\" said she. \"You can do\nnothing. The athaleb will now go in a straight line to the land of the\nOrin.\"\n\nUpon this I started up in wild excitement.\n\n\"Never, never, never!\" I cried, in a fury. \"I will not; I will destroy\nthis athaleb and perish in the water!\"\n\nAs I said this I raised my rifle.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" cried Layelah, in accents of fear.\n\n\"Turn back,\" I cried, \"or I will kill this athaleb!\"\n\nUpon this Layelah dropped the reins, stood up, and looked at me with a\nsmile.\n\n\"Oh, Atam-or,\" said she, \"what a thing to ask! How can I go back now,\nwhen we have started for the land of the Orin?\"\n\n\"We shall never reach the land of the Orin,\" I cried; \"we shall perish\nin the sea!\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" said Layelah; \"you cannot kill the athaleb. You are no more\nthan an insect; your rod is a weak thing, and will break on his iron\nframe.\"\n\nIt was evident that Layelah had not the slightest idea of the powers\nof my rifle. There was no hesitation on my part. I took aim with the\nrifle. At that moment I was desperate. I thought of nothing but the\nswift flight of the athaleb, which was bearing me away forever from\nAlmah. I could not endure that thought, and still less could I endure\nthe thought that she should believe me false. It was therefore in a\nwild passion of rage and despair that I levelled my rifle, taking aim\nas well as I could at what seemed a vital part under the wing. The\nmotion of the wing rendered this difficult, however, and I hesitated\na moment, so as to make sure. All this time Layelah stood looking\nat me with a smile on her rosy lips and a merry twinkle in her\neyes--evidently regarding my words as empty threats and my act as\na vain pretence, and utterly unprepared for what was to follow.\n\nSuddenly I fired both barrels in quick succession. The reports rang\nout in thunder over the sea. The athaleb gave a wild, appalling\nshriek, and fell straight down into the water, fluttering vainly with\none wing, while the other hung down useless. A shriek of horror burst\nfrom Layelah. She started back, and fell from her standing-place into\nthe waves beneath. The next instant we were all in the water\ntogether--the athaleb writhing and lashing the water into foam, while\nI involuntarily clung to his coarse mane, and expected death every\nmoment.\n\nBut death did not come; for the athaleb did not sink, but floated with\nhis back out of the water, the right pinion being sunk underneath and\nuseless, and the left struggling vainly with the sea. But after a time\nhe folded up the left wing and drew it close in to his side, and\npropelled himself with his long hind-legs. His right wing was broken,\nbut he did not seem to have suffered any other injury.\n\nSuddenly I heard a cry behind me:\n\n\"Atam-or! oh, Atam-or!\"\n\nI looked around and saw Layelah. She was swimming in the water, and\nseemed exhausted. In the agitation of the past few moments I had lost\nsight of her, and had thought that she was drowned; but now the sight\nof her roused me from my stupor and brought me back to myself. She was\nswimming, yet her strokes were weak and her face was full of despair.\nIn an instant I had flung off my coat, rolled up the rifle and pistol\nin its folds, and sprung into the water. A few strokes brought me to\nLayelah. A moment more and I should have been too late. I held her\nhead out of water, told her not to struggle, and then struck out to go\nback. It would have been impossible for me to do this, encumbered with\nsuch a load, had I not fortunately perceived the floating wing of the\nathaleb close beside me. This I seized, and by means of it drew myself\nwith Layelah alongside; after which I succeeded in putting her on the\nback of the animal, and soon followed myself.\n\nThe terror of the rifle had overwhelmed her, and the suddenness of the\ncatastrophe had almost killed her. She had struggled in the water for\na long time, and had called to me in vain. Now she was quite\nexhausted, and lay in my arms trembling and sobbing. I spoke to her\nencouragingly, and wrapped her in my coat, and rubbed her hands and\nfeet, until at last she began to recover. Then she wept quietly for a\nlong time; then the weeping fit passed away. She looked up with a\nsmile, and in her face there was unutterable gratitude.\n\n\"Atam-or,\" said she, \"I never loved death like the rest of the\nKosekin; but now--but now--I feel that death with you would be sweet.\"\n\nThen tears came to her eyes, and I found tears coming to my own, so\nthat I had to stoop down and kiss away the tears of Layelah. As I did\nso she twined both her arms around my neck, held me close to her, and\nsighed.\n\n\"Oh, Atam-or, death with you is sweet! And now you cannot reproach\nme-- You have done this yourself, with your terrible power; and you\nhave saved my life to let me die with you. You do not hate me, then,\nAtam-or, do you? Just speak once to a poor little girl, and say that\nyou do not hate her!\"\n\nAll this was very pitiable. What man that had a heart in his breast\ncould listen unmoved to words like these, or look without emotion upon\none so beautiful, so gentle, and so tender? It was no longer Layelah\nin triumph with whom I had to do, but Layelah in distress: the light\nbanter, the teasing, mocking smile, the kindling eye, the ready\nlaugh--all were gone. There was nothing now but mournful\ntenderness--the timid appeal of one who dreaded a repulse, the glance\nof deep affection, the abandonment of love.\n\nI held Layelah in my arms, and I thought of nothing now but words of\nconsolation for her. Life seemed over; death seemed inevitable; and\nthere, on the back of the athaleb, we floated on the waters and waited\nfor our doom.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nFALLING, LIKE ICARUS, INTO THE SEA\n\n\nThe aurora light, which had flamed brightly, was now extinct, and\ndarkness was upon the face of the deep, where we floated on the back\nof the monster. He swam, forcing himself onward with his hind-legs,\nwith one broad wing folded up close. Had both been folded up the\nathaleb could have swum rapidly; but the broken wing lay expanded\nover the water, tossing with the waves, so that our progress was but\nslight. Had it not been for this, the athaleb's own instinct might\nhave served to guide him toward some shore which we might have hoped\nto reach before life was extinct; but as it was, all thought of\nreaching any shore was out of the question, and there arose before us\nonly the prospect of death--a death, too, which must be lingering and\npainful and cruel. Thus amid the darkness we floated, and the waves\ndashed around us, and the athaleb never ceased to struggle in the\nwater, trying to force his way onward. It seemed sweet at that moment\nto have Layelah with me, for what could have been more horrible than\nloneliness amid those black waters? and Layelah's mind was made up\nto meet death with joy, so that her mood conveyed itself to me. And\nI thought that since death was inevitable it were better to meet\nit thus, and in this way end my life--not amid the horrors of the\nsacrifice and the Mista Kosek, but in a way which seemed natural to\na seafaring man like myself, and with which I had long familiarized my\nthoughts. For I had fallen upon a world and among people which were\nall alien and unintelligible to me; and to live on would only open the\nway to new and worse calamities. There was peace also in the thought\nthat my death would snatch the prospect of death from Almah. She would\nnow be safe. It was only when we were together as lovers that death\nthreatened her; but now since I was removed she could resume her\nformer life, and she might remember me only as an episode in that\nlife. That she would remember me I felt sure, and that she would weep\nfor me and mourn after me was undeniable; but time as it passed would\nsurely alleviate that grief, and Almah would live and be happy.\nPerhaps she might yet regain her native land and rejoin her loved\nkindred, whom she would tell of the stranger from an unknown shore who\nhad loved her, and through whose death she had gained her life. Such\nwere the thoughts that filled my mind as I floated over the black\nwater with darkness all around, as I held Layelah in my arms, with my\ncoat wrapped around her, and murmured in her ear tender words of\nconsolation and sympathy.\n\nA long, long time had passed--but how long I know not--when suddenly\nLayelah gave a cry, and started up on her knees, with her head bent\nforward listening intently. I too listened, and I could distinctly\nhear the sound of breakers.\n\nIt was evident that we were approaching some shore; and, from what I\nremembered of the shore of Magones, such a shore meant death, and\ndeath alone. We stood up and tried to peer through the gloom. At\nlength we saw a whole line of breakers, and beyond all was black. We\nwaited anxiously in that position, and drew steadily nearer. It was\nevident that the athaleb was desirous of reaching that shore, and we\ncould do nothing but await the result.\n\nBut the athaleb had his wits about him, and swam along on a line with\nthe breakers for some distance, until at length an opening appeared,\ninto which he directed his course. Passing through this we reached\nstill water, which seemed like a lagoon surrounded by a coral reef.\nThe athaleb swam on farther, and at length we saw before us an island\nwith a broad, sandy beach, beyond which was the shadowy outline of a\nforest. Here the monster landed, and dragged himself wearily upon the\nsand, where he spread his vast bulk out, and lay panting heavily. We\ndismounted--I first, so as to assist Layelah; and then it seemed as if\ndeath were postponed for a time, since we had reached this place where\nthe rich and rank vegetation spoke of nothing but vigorous life.\n\nFortune had indeed dealt strangely with me. I had fled with Almah, and\nwith her had reached one desolate shore, and now I found myself with\nLayelah upon another shore, desolate also, but not a savage\nwilderness. This lonely island, ringed with the black ocean waters,\nwas the abode of a life of its own, and there was nothing here to\ncrush the soul into a horror of despair like that which was caused by\nthe tremendous scenes on Magones.\n\nIn an instant Layelah revived from her gloom. She looked around,\nclapped her little hands, laughed aloud, and danced for joy.\n\n\"Oh, Atam-or,\" she cried, \"see--see the trees, see the grass, the\nbushes! This is a land of wonder. As for food, you can call it down\nfrom the sky with your sepet-ram, or we can find it on the rocks.\nOh, Atam-or! life is better than death, and we can live here, and we\ncan be happy. This shall be better to us than the lands of the Orin,\nfor we shall be alone, and we shall be all in all to one another.\"\n\nI could not help laughing, and I said:\n\n\"Layelah, this is not the language of the Kosekin. You should at once\ngo to the other side of this island, and sit down and wait for death.\"\n\n\"Never,\" said Layelah; \"you are mine, Atam-or, and I never will leave\nyou. If you wish me to die for you, I will gladly lay down my life;\nbut I will not leave you. I love you, Atam-or; and now, whether it be\nlife or death, it is all the same so long as I have you.\"\n\nOur submersion in the sea and our long exposure afterward had chilled\nboth of us, but Layelah felt it most. She was shivering in her wet\nclothes in spite of my coat which I insisted on her wearing, and I\ndetermined, if possible, to kindle a fire. Fortunately my powder was\ndry, for I had thrown off my flask with my coat before jumping into\nthe sea, and thus I had the means of creating fire. I rubbed wet\npowder over my handkerchief, and then gathered some dried sticks and\nmoss. After this I found some dead trees, the boughs of which were\ndry and brittle, and in the exercise I soon grew warm, and had the\nsatisfaction of seeing a great heap of fagots accumulating. I fired\nmy pistol into the handkerchief, which, being saturated with powder,\ncaught the fire, and this I blew into a flame among the dried moss.\nA bright fire now sprang up and blazed high in the air; while I, in\norder to have an ample supply of fuel, continued to gather it for a\nlong time. At length, as I came back, I saw Layelah lying on the sand\nin front of the fire, sound asleep. I was glad of this, for she was\nweary, and had seemed so weak and tremulous that I had felt anxious;\nso now I arranged my coat over her carefully, and then sat down for a\ntime to think over this new turn which my fortune had taken.\n\nThis island was certainly very unlike Magones, yet I had no surety but\nthat it might be equally destitute of food. This was the first\nquestion, and I could not think of sleep until I had found out more\nabout the place. The aurora light, which constantly brightens and\nlessens in this strange world, was now shining gloriously, and I set\nforth to explore the island. The beach was of fine sand all the way.\nThe water was smooth, and shut in on every side by an outer reef\nagainst which the sea-waves broke incessantly. As I walked I soon\nperceived what the island was; for I had often seen such places before\nin the South Pacific. It was, in fact, a coral islet, with a reef of\nrocks encircling it on every side. The vegetation, however, was unlike\nanything in the world beyond; for it consisted of many varieties of\ntree-ferns, that looked like palms, and giant grasses, and bamboo. The\nisland was but small, and the entire circuit was not over a mile. I\nsaw nothing that looked like food, nor did it seem likely that in so\nsmall a place there could be enough sustenance for us. Our only hope\nwould be from the sea, yet even here I could see no signs of any sort\nof shell-fish. On the whole the prospect was discouraging, and I\nreturned to the starting-point with a feeling of dejection; but this\nfeeling did not trouble me much at that time: my chief thought was of\nrest, and I flung myself down on the sand and fell asleep.\n\nI was awakened by a cry from Layelah. Starting up, I saw her standing\nand looking into the sky. She was intensely excited. As soon as she\nsaw me she rushed toward me and burst into tears, while I, full of\nwonder, could only stare upward.\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Layelah, \"they've turned back--they've found us! We shall\nhave to leave our dear, lovely island. Oh, Atam-or, I shall lose you\nnow; for never, never, never again will you have one thought of love\nfor your poor Layelah!\"\n\nWith these words she clung sobbing to me. For my part I do not\nremember what I said to soothe her, for the sight above was so amazing\nthat it took up all my attention. The aurora shone bright, and in the\nsky I saw two vast objects wheeling and circling, as if about to\ndescend. I recognized them at once as athalebs; but as their backs\nwere hid from view by their immense wings, I could not make out\nwhether they were wanderers about to alight of their own accord, or\nguided here by riders--perhaps by the Kosekin from whom we had been\nparted.\n\nThis much at least I remember. I said to Layelah that these athalebs\nwere wild ones, which had come here because they saw or scented our\nwounded one; but Layelah shook her head with mournful meaning.\n\n\"Oh no,\" said she; \"Almah has come back for you. This fire-light has\nguided them. If you had not made the fire they never, never, never\ncould have found us; but now all is lost.\"\n\nThere was no time for conversation or discussion. The athalebs drew\nswiftly nearer and nearer, descending in long circuits, until at\nlength they touched the ground not far away on the wide sandy beach.\nThen we saw people on their backs, and among them was Almah. We\nhurried toward them, and Almah rushed into my arms, to the great\ndisgust of Layelah, for she was close beside me and saw it all. She\ngave an exclamation of grief and despair, and hurried away.\n\nFrom Almah I learned that our disappearance had caused alarm; that two\nof the athalebs had come back in search of us; that they had been to\nMagones, and had searched over the seas, and were just about giving us\nup as lost, when the fire-light had attracted their attention and\ndrawn them here.\n\nI said nothing at that time about the cause of our disappearance, but\nmerely remarked that the athaleb had fallen into the sea and swam\nhere. This was sufficient. They had to remain here for some time\nlonger to rest their athalebs. At length we prepared to depart. Our\nwounded athaleb was left behind to take care of himself. I was taken\nwith Almah, and Layelah went on the other. We were thus separated; and\nso we set forth upon our return, and at length arrived at the amir.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nGRIMM'S LAW AGAIN\n\n\nDinner was now announced, and Oxenden laid the manuscript aside;\nwhereupon they adjourned to the cabin, where they proceeded to discuss\nboth the repast and the manuscript.\n\n\"Well,\" said Featherstone, \"More's story seems to be approaching a\ncrisis. What do you think of it now, Melick? Do you still think it a\nsensational novel?\"\n\n\"Partly so,\" said Melick; \"but it would be nearer the mark to call it\na satirical romance.\"\n\n\"Why not a scientific romance?\"\n\n\"Because there's precious little science in it, but a good deal of\nquiet satire.\"\n\n\"Satire on what?\" asked Featherstone. \"I'll be hanged if I can see\nit.\"\n\n\"Oh, well,\" said Melick, \"on things in general. The satire is directed\nagainst the restlessness of humanity; its impulses, feelings, hopes,\nand fears--all that men do and feel and suffer. It mocks us by\nexhibiting a new race of men, animated by passions and impulses which\nare directly the opposite of ours, and yet no nearer happiness than we\nare. It shows us a world where our evil is made a good, and our good\nan evil; there all that we consider a blessing is had in\nabundance--prolonged and perpetual sunlight, riches, power, fame--and\nyet these things are despised, and the people, turning away from them,\nimagine that they can find happiness in poverty, darkness, death, and\nunrequited love. The writer thus mocks at all our dearest passions and\nstrongest desires; and his general aim is to show that the mere search\nfor happiness per se is a vulgar thing, and must always result in\nutter nothingness. The writer also teaches the great lesson that the\nhappiness of man consists not in external surroundings, but in the\ninternal feelings, and that heaven itself is not a place, but a state.\nIt is the old lesson which Milton extorted from Satan:\n\n  \"'What matter where, if I be still the same--'\n\n\"Or again:\n\n  \"'The mind is its own place, and of itself\n    Can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven--'\"\n\n\"That's good too,\" cried Oxenden. \"That reminds me of the German\ncommentators who find in the Agamemnon of AEschylus or the OEdipus\nof Sophocles or the Hamlet of Shakespeare motives and purposes\nof which the authors could never have dreamed, and give us a\nmetaphysical, beer-and-tobacco, High-Dutch Clytemnestra or Antigone or\nLady Macbeth. No, my boy, More was a simple sailor, and had no idea of\nsatirizing anything.\"\n\n\"How, then, do you account for the perpetual undercurrent of meaning\nand innuendo that may be found in every line?\"\n\n\"I deny that there is anything of the sort,\" said Oxenden. \"It is a\nplain narrative of facts; but the facts are themselves such that they\ngive a new coloring to the facts of our own life. They are in such\nprofound antithesis to European ways that we consider them as being\nwritten merely to indicate that difference. It is like the Germania\nof Tacitus, which many critics still hold to be a satire on Roman\nways, while as a matter of fact it is simply a narrative of German\nmanners and customs.\"\n\n\"I hope,\" cried Melick, \"that you do not mean to compare this awful\nrot and rubbish to the Germania of Tacitus?\"\n\n\"By no means,\" said Oxenden; \"I merely asserted that in one respect\nthey were analogous. You forced on the allusion to the Germania by\ncalling this 'rot and rubbish' a satirical romance.\"\n\n\"Oh, well,\" said Melick, \"I only referred to the intention of the\nwriter. His plan is one thing and his execution quite another. His\nplan is not bad, but he fails utterly in his execution. The style is\ndetestable. If he had written in the style of a plain seaman, and\ntold a simple unvarnished tale, it would have been all right. In order\nto carry out properly such a plan as this the writer should take Defoe\nas his model, or, still better, Dean Swift. Gulliver's Travels and\nRobinson Crusoe show what can be done in this way, and form a\nstandard by which all other attempts must be judged. But this writer\nis tawdry; he has the worst vices of the sensational school--he shows\neverywhere marks of haste, gross carelessness, and universal\nfeebleness. When he gets hold of a good fancy, he lacks the patience\nthat is necessary in order to work it up in an effective way. He is a\ngross plagiarist, and over and over again violates in the most glaring\nmanner all the ordinary proprieties of style. What can be more absurd,\nfor instance, than the language which he puts into the mouth of\nLayelah? Not content with making her talk like a sentimental\nboarding-school, bread-and-butter English miss, he actually forgets\nhimself so far as to put in her mouth a threadbare joke, which\neveryone has heard since childhood.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"Oh, that silly speech about the athaleb swallowing its victuals\nwhole.\"\n\n\"What's the matter with that?\" asked Oxenden. \"It's merely a chance\nresemblance. In translating her words into English they fell by\naccident into that shape. No one but you would find fault with them.\nWould it have been better if he had translated her words into the\nscientific phraseology which the doctor made use of with regard to the\nichthyosaurus? He might have made it this way: 'Does it bite?' 'No; it\nswallows its food without mastication.' Would that have been better?\nBesides, it's all very well to talk of imitating Defoe and Swift; but\nsuppose he couldn't do it?\"\n\n\"Then he shouldn't have written the book.\"\n\n\"In that case how could his father have heard about his adventures?\"\n\n\"His father!\" exclaimed Melick. \"Do you mean to say that you still\naccept all this as bona fide?\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say,\" retorted Oxenden, \"that you still have any doubt\nabout the authenticity of this remarkable manuscript?\"\n\nAt this each looked at the other; Melick elevated his eyebrows, and\nOxenden shrugged his shoulders, but each seemed unable to find words\nto express his amazement at the other's stupidity, and so they took\nrefuge in silence.\n\n\"What do you understand by this athaleb, doctor?\" asked Featherstone.\n\n\"The athaleb?\" said the doctor. \"Why, it is clearly the pterodactyl.\"\n\n\"By-the-bye,\" interrupted Oxenden, \"do please take notice of that\nname. It affords another exemplification of 'Grimm's Law.' The Hebrew\nword is 'ataleph,' and means bat. The Kosekin word is 'athaleb.' Here\nyou see the thin letter of Hebrew represented by the aspirated letter\nof the Kosekin language, while the aspirated Hebrew is represented by\nthe Kosekin medial.\"\n\n\"Too true,\" exclaimed Melick, in a tone of deep conviction; \"and now,\nOxenden, won't you sing us a song?\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said Featherstone; \"let the doctor tell us about the\nathaleb.\"\n\n\"Well,\" resumed the doctor, \"as I was saying, it must be undoubtedly\nthe pterodactyl. It is a most extraordinary animal, and is a species\nof flying lizard, although differing from the lizard in many respects.\nIt has the head and neck of a bird, the trunk and tail of an ordinary\nmammal, the jaws and teeth of a reptile, and the wings of a bat. Owen\ndescribes one whose sweep of wings exceeded twenty feet, and many have\nbeen found of every gradation of size down to that of a bat. There is\nno reason why they should not be as large as More says; and I for my\npart do not suspect him of exaggeration. Some have supposed that a\nlate, lingering individual may have suggested the idea of the fabulous\ndragon--an idea which seems to be in the minds of nearly all the human\nrace, for in the early records of many nations we find the destruction\nof dragons assigned to their gods and heroes. The figure of the\npterodactyl represents pretty closely that which is given to the\ndragons. It is not impossible that they may have existed into the\nperiod which we call prehistoric, and that monsters far larger than\nany which we have yet discovered may have lingered until the time when\nman began to increase upon the earth, to spread over its surface, and\nto carve upon wood and stone representations of the most striking\nobjects around him. When the living pterodactyls had disappeared the\nmemory of them was preserved; some new features were added, and the\nimagination went so far as to endow them with the power of belching\nforth smoke and flames. Thus the dragon idea pervaded the minds of\nmen, and instead of a natural animal it became a fabulous one.\n\n\"The fingers of the forelegs were of the ordinary dimensions, and\nterminated with crooked nails, and these were probably used to suspend\nthemselves from trees. When in repose it rested on its hind legs like\na bird, and held its neck curving behind, so that its enormous head\nshould not disturb its equilibrium. The size and form of the feet, of\nthe leg, and of the thigh prove that they could hold themselves erect\nwith firmness, their wings folded, and move about in this way like\nbirds, just as More describes them as doing. Like birds they could\nalso perch on trees, and could crawl like bats and lizards along the\nrocks and cliffs.\n\n\"Some think that they were covered with scales, but I am of the\nopinion that they had a horny hide, with a ridge of hair running down\ntheir backs--in which opinion I am sustained by More's account. The\nsmaller kinds were undoubtedly insectivorous, but the larger ones must\nhave been carnivorous, and probably fed largely on fish.\"\n\n\"Well, at any rate,\" said Melick, gravely, \"this athaleb solves the\ndifficult question as to how the Troglodytes emigrated to the South\nPole.\"\n\n\"How?\" asked the doctor.\n\n\"Why, they must have gone there on athalebs! Your friends the\npterodactyls probably lingered longest among the Troglodytes, who,\nseeing that they were rapidly dying out, concluded to depart to\nanother and a better world. One beauty of this theory is that it\ncannot possibly be disproved; another is that it satisfies all the\nrequirements of the case; a third is that it accounts for the\ndisappearance of the pterodactyls in our world, and their appearance\nat the South Pole; and there are forty or fifty other facts, all\nincluded in this theory, which I have not time just now to enumerate,\nbut will try to do so after we have finished reading the manuscript. I\nwill only add that the athaleb must be regarded as another link which\nbinds the Kosekin to the Semitic race.\"\n\n\"Another link?\" said Oxenden. \"That I already have; and it is one that\ncarries conviction with it.\"\n\n\"All your arguments invariably do, my dear fellow.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" asked the doctor.\n\n\"The Kosekin alphabet,\" said Oxenden.\n\n\"I can't see how you can make anything out of that,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"Very well, I can easily explain,\" replied Oxenden. \"In the first\nplace we must take the old Hebrew alphabet. I will write down the\nletters in their order first.\"\n\nSaying this he hastily jotted down some letters on a piece of paper,\nand showed to the doctor the following:\n\n           Labials.      Palatals.    Linguals.\n    A         B         C (or G)          D\n    E         F         Ch (or H)     Dh (or Th)\n    I     Liquids, L        M             N\n    O         P             K             T\n\n\"That,\" said he, \"is substantially the order of the old Hebrew\nalphabet.\"\n\n\"But,\" said the doctor, \"the Kosekin alphabet differs in its order\naltogether from that.\"\n\n\"That very difference can be shown to be all the stronger proof of a\nconnection between them,\" said Oxenden.\n\n\"I should like to know how.\"\n\n\"The fact is,\" said Oxenden, \"these letters are represented\ndifferently in the two languages in exact accordance with Grimm's\nLaw.\"\n\n\"By Jove!\" cried Featherstone, \"Grimm's Law again!\"\n\n\"According to that law,\" continued Oxenden, \"the letters of the\nalphabet ought to change their order. Now let us leave out the vowels\nand linguals, and deal only with the mutes. First, we have in the\nHebrew alphabet the medials B, G, and D. Very well; in the Kosekin we\nhave standing first the thin letters, or tenues, according to Grimm's\nLaw, namely, P, K, T. Next we have in the Hebrew the aspirates F, Ch,\nDh. In the Kosekin alphabet we have corresponding to them the medials\nB, G, D. Next we have in the Hebrew the tenues, or thin letters P, K,\nT. In the Kosekin we have the corresponding aspirates F, Ch, Th. The\nvowels, liquids, and sibilants need not be regarded just here, for the\nproof from the mutes is sufficient to satisfy any reasonable man.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Melick, \"I for one am thoroughly satisfied, and don't\nneed another single word. The fact is, I never knew before the\nall-sufficient nature of Grimm's Law. Why, it can unlock any mystery!\nWhen I get home I must buy one--a tame one, if possible--and keep him\nwith me always. It is more useful to a literary man than to any other.\nIt is said that with a knowledge of Grimm's Law a man may wander\nthrough the world from Iceland to Ceylon, and converse pleasantly in\nall the Indo-European languages. More must have had Grimm's Law stowed\naway somewhere about him; and that's the reason why he escaped the\nicebergs, the volcanoes, the cannibals, the subterranean channel\nmonster, and arrived at last safe and sound in the land of the\nKosekin. What I want is Grimm's Law--a nice tidy one, well trained, in\ngood working order, and kind in harness; and the moment I get one I\nintend to go to the land of the Kosekin myself.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nOXENDEN PREACHES A SERMON\n\n\n\"Magones,\" said the doctor, \"is clearly a volcanic island, and, taken\nin connection with the other volcanoes around, shows how active must\nbe the subterranean fires at the South Pole. It seems probable to me\nthat the numerous caves of the Kosekin were originally fissures in the\nmountains, formed by convulsions of nature; and also that the places\nexcavated by man must consist of soft volcanic rock, such as\npumice-stone, or rather tufa, easily worked, and remaining permanently\nin any shape into which it may be fashioned. As to Magones, it seems\nanother Iceland; for there are the same wild and hideous desolation,\nthe same impassable wildernesses, and the same universal scenes of\nruin, lighted up by the baleful and tremendous volcanic fires.\"\n\n\"But what of that little island on which they landed?\" asked\nFeatherstone. \"That, surely, was not volcanic.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the doctor; \"that must have been a coral island.\"\n\n\"By-the-bye, is it really true,\" asked Featherstone, \"that these coral\nislands are the work of little insects?\"\n\n\"Well, they may be called insects,\" replied the doctor; \"they are\nliving zoophytes of most minute dimensions, which, however, compensate\nfor their smallness of size by their inconceivable numbers. Small as\nthese are they have accomplished infinitely more than all that ever\nwas done by the ichthyosaurus, the plesiosaurus, the pterodactyl, and\nthe whole tribe of monsters that once filled the earth. Immense\ndistricts and whole mountains have been built up by these minute\ncreatures. They have been at work for ages, and are still at work. It\nis principally in the South Seas that their labors are carried on.\nNear the Maldive Islands they have formed a mass whose volume is equal\nto the Alps. Around New Caledonia they have built a barrier of reefs\nfour hundred miles in length, and another along the northeast coast of\nAustralia a thousand miles in length. In the Pacific Ocean, islands,\nreefs, and islets innumerable have been constructed by them, which\nextend for an immense distance.\n\n\"The coral islands are called 'atolls.' They are nearly always\ncircular, with a depression in the centre. They are originally made\nring-shaped, but the action of the ocean serves to throw fragments of\nrock into the inner depression, which thus fills up; firm land\nappears; the rock crumbles into soil; the winds and birds and currents\nbring seeds here, and soon the new island is covered with verdure.\nThese little creatures have played a part in the past quite as\nimportant as in the present. All Germany rests upon a bank of coral;\nand they seem to have been most active during the Oolitic Period.\"\n\n\"How do the creatures act?\" asked Featherstone.\n\n\"Nobody knows,\" replied the doctor.\n\nA silence now followed, which was at last broken by Oxenden.\n\n\"After all,\" said he, \"these monsters and marvels of nature form the\nleast interesting feature in the land of the Kosekin. To me the people\nthemselves are the chief subject of interest. Where did they get that\nstrange, all-pervading love of death, which is as strong in them as\nlove of life is in us?\"\n\n\"Why, they got it from the imagination of the writer of the\nmanuscript,\" interrupted Melick.\n\n\"Yes, it's easy to answer it from your point of view; yet from my\npoint of view it is more difficult. I sometimes think that it may be\nthe strong spirituality of the Semitic race, carried out under\nexceptionally favorable circumstances to the ultimate results; for the\nSemitic race more than all others thought little of this life, and\nturned their affections to the life that lives beyond this. The\nKosekin may thus have had a spiritual development of their own, which\nended in this.\n\n\"Yet there may be another reason for it, and I sometimes think that\nthe Kosekin may be nearer to the truth than we are. We have by nature\na strong love of life--it is our dominant feeling--but yet there is in\nthe minds of all men a deep underlying conviction of the vanity of\nlife, and the worthlessness. In all ages and among all races the best,\nthe purest, and the wisest have taught this truth--that human life is\nnot a blessing; that the evil predominates over the good; and that our\nbest hope is to gain a spirit of acquiescence with its inevitable\nills. All philosophy and all religions teach us this one solemn truth,\nthat in this life the evil surpasses the good. It has always been so.\nSuffering has been the lot of all living things, from the giant of the\nprimeval swamps down to the smallest zoophyte. It is far more so with\nman. Some favored classes in every age may furnish forth a few\nindividuals who may perhaps lead lives of self-indulgence and luxury;\nbut to the mass of mankind life has ever been, and must ever be, a\nprolonged scene of labor intermingled with suffering. The great Indian\nreligions, whether Brahmanic or Buddhistic, teach as their cardinal\ndoctrine that life is an evil. Buddhism is more pronounced in this,\nfor it teaches more emphatically than even the Kosekin that the chief\nend of man is to get rid of the curse of life and gain the bliss of\nNirvana, or annihilation. True, it does not take so practical a form\nas among the Kosekin, yet it is believed by one-third of the human\nrace as the foundation of the religion in which they live and die. We\nneed not go to the Kosekin, however, for such maxims as these. The\nintelligent Hindoos, the Chinese, the Japanese, with many other\nnations, all cling firmly to this belief. Sakyamoum Gautama Buddha,\nthe son and heir of a mighty monarch, penetrated with the conviction\nof the misery of life, left his throne, embraced a life of voluntary\npoverty, want, and misery, so that he might find his way to a better\nstate--the end before him being this, that he might ultimately escape\nfrom the curse of existence. He lived till old age, gained innumerable\nfollowers, and left to them as a solemn legacy the maxim that not to\nexist is better than to exist; that death is better than life. Since\nhis day millions of his followers have upheld his principles and lived\nhis life. Even among the joyous Greeks we find this feeling at times\nbursting forth it comes when we least expect it, and not even a\nKosekin poet could express this view more forcibly than Sophocles in\nthe OEdipus at Colonus:\n\n  \"'Not to be born surpasses every lot;\n    And the next best lot by far, when one is born\n    Is to go back whence he came as soon as possible;\n    For while youth is present bringing vain follies,\n    What woes does it not have, what ills does it not bear--\n    Murders, factions, strife, war, envy,\n    But the extreme of misery is attained by loathsome old age--\n    Old age, strengthless, unsociable, friendless,\n    Where all evils upon evils dwell together.'\"\n\n\"I'll give you the words of a later poet,\" said Melick, \"who takes\na different view of the case. I think I'll sing them, with your\npermission.\"\n\nMelick swallowed a glass of wine and then sang the following:\n\n  \"'They may rail at this life: from the hour I began it\n      I found it a life full of kindness and bliss,\n    And until they can show me some happier planet,\n      More social and bright, I'll content me with this.\n    As long as the world has such lips and such eyes\n      As before me this moment enraptured I see,\n    They may say what they will of their orbs in the skies,\n      But this earth is the planet for you, love, and me.'\n\n\"What a pity it is,\" continued Melick, \"that the writer of this\nmanuscript had not the philological, theological, sociological,\ngeological, palaeological, ontological, ornithological, and all the\nother logical attainments of yourself and the doctor! He could then\nhave given us a complete view of the nature of the Kosekin, morally\nand physically; he could have treated of the geology of the soil, the\nethnology of the people, and could have unfolded before us a full and\ncomprehensive view of their philosophy and religion, and could have\ncrammed his manuscript with statistics. I wonder why he didn't do it\neven as it was. It must have been a strong temptation.\"\n\n\"More,\" said Oxenden, with deep impressiveness, \"was a simple-minded\nthough somewhat emotional sailor, and merely wrote in the hope that\nhis story might one day meet the eyes of his father. I certainly\nshould like to find some more accurate statements about the science,\nphilosophy, and religion of the Kosekin; yet, after all, such things\ncould not be expected.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" said Melick; \"it was easy enough for him.\"\n\n\"How?\" asked Oxenden.\n\n\"Why, he had only to step into the British Museum, and in a couple of\nhours he could have crammed up on all those points in science,\nphilosophy, ethnology, and theology, about which you are so anxious to\nknow.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Featherstone, \"suppose we continue our reading? I believe\nit is my turn now. I sha'n't be able to hold out so long as you did,\nOxenden, but I'll do what I can.\"\n\nSaying this, Featherstone took the manuscript and went on to read.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nIN PRISON\n\n\nIt was with hearts full of the gloomiest forebodings that we returned\nto the amir, and these we soon found to be fully justified. The\nathalebs descended at that point from which they had risen--namely, on\nthe terrace immediately in front of the cavern where they had been\nconfined. We then dismounted, and Layelah with the Kosekin guards\naccompanied us to our former chambers. There she left us, saying that\na communication would be sent to us.\n\nWe were now left to our own conjectures.\n\n\"I wonder what they will do to us?\" said I.\n\n\"It is impossible to tell,\" said Almah.\n\n\"I suppose,\" said I, \"they will punish us in some way; but then\npunishment among the Kosekin is what seems honor and reward to me.\nPerhaps they will spare our lives, for that in their eyes ought to be\nthe severest punishment and the deepest disgrace imaginable.\"\n\nAlmah sighed.\n\n\"The Kosekin do not always act in this matter as one would suppose,\"\nsaid she. \"It is quite likely that they may dread our escaping, and\nmay conclude to sacrifice us at once.\"\n\nOn the next jom I had a visit from the Kohen Gadol. He informed me\nthat the paupers had held a Council of State, in which they had made a\nspecial examination of our late flight. He and Layelah had both been\nexamined, as well as the Kosekin who had gone after us; but Layelah's\ntestimony was by far the most important.\n\nThe Council of State gathered from Layelah's report that we had fled\nto Magones for the especial purpose of gaining the most blessed of\ndeaths; that she pursued us in the interest of the state; and that we\non her arrival had generously surrendered our own selfish desires, and\nhad at once returned.\n\nWe learned that much gratification was felt by the council, and also\nexpressed, at Layelah's account and at our action.\n\nFirst, at our eager love of death, which was so natural in their\neyes; secondly, at the skill which we had shown in selecting Magones;\nand finally, at our generosity in giving up so readily the blessed\nprospect of exile and want and death, so as to come back to the\namir. Had we been Kosekin our acts would have been natural enough;\nbut, being foreigners, it was considered more admirable in us, and it\nseemed to show that we were equal to the Kosekin themselves. It was\nfelt, however, that in our eager rush after death we had been somewhat\nselfish; but as this probably arose from our ignorance of the law, it\nmight be overlooked. On the whole it was decided that we ought to be\nrewarded, and that, too, with the greatest benefits that the Kosekin\ncould bestow. What these benefits were the Kohen Gadol could not say;\nand thus we were left, as before, in the greatest possible anxiety. We\nstill dreaded the worst. The highest honors of these men might well\nawaken apprehension; for they thought that the chief blessings were\npoverty and darkness and death.\n\nLayelah next came to see me. She was as amiable as ever, and showed no\nresentment at all. She gave me an account of what had happened at the\nCouncil of State, which was the same as what I had heard from the\nKohen Gadol.\n\nI asked her why she had made such a report of us.\n\n\"To conciliate their good-will,\" said Layelah. \"For if they thought\nthat you had really fled from death from a love of life, they would\nhave felt such contempt for you that serious harm might have\nhappened.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I; \"but among the Kosekin what you call harm would\nprobably have been just what I want. I should like to be viewed with\ncontempt, and considered unworthy of death and the Mista Kosek, and\nother such honors.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said Layelah; \"but that doesn't follow; for you see the\npaupers love death so intensely that they long to bestow it on all;\nand if they knew that you were afraid of it, they would be tempted to\nbestow it upon you immediately, just to show you how delightful a\nthing it is. And that was the very thing that I was trying to guard\nagainst.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"and what is the result? Do you know what their\ndecision is?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Layelah.\n\n\"What is it?\" I asked, eagerly.\n\nLayelah hesitated.\n\n\"What is it?\" I cried again, full of impatience.\n\n\"I'm afraid it will not sound very pleasant to you,\" said Layelah,\n\"but at any rate your life is spared for the present. They have\ndecided to give you what they call the greatest possible honors and\ndistinctions.\"\n\nLayelah paused, and looked at me earnestly. For my part these words\nsounded ominous, and were full of the darkest meaning.\n\n\"Tell me all,\" I said; \"don't keep me in suspense.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Layelah, \"I'm afraid you will think it hard; but I must\ntell you. I will tell it, therefore, as briefly and formally as\npossible.\n\n\"First, then, they have decreed the blessing of separation. You and\nAlmah must now be parted, since this is regarded as the highest bliss\nof lovers.\n\n\"Secondly, they have decreed the blessing of poverty. All these\nluxuries will be taken away, and you will be raised to an equality in\nthis respect with the great paupers.\n\n\"Thirdly, you are to have the blessing of darkness. You are to be\nremoved from this troublesome and vexatious light, which here is\nregarded as a curse, and henceforth live without it.\n\n\"Fourthly, the next decree is the high reward of imprisonment. You are\nto be delivered from the evils of liberty, and shut up in a dark\ncavern, from which it will be impossible to escape or to communicate\nwith anyone outside.\n\n\"Fifthly, you are to associate with the greatest of the paupers, the\nclass that is the most honored and influential. You will be present at\nall their highest councils, and will have the privilege of perpetual\nintercourse with those reverend men. They will tell you of the joys of\npoverty, the happiness of darkness, and the bliss of death.\"\n\nLayelah paused, and looked at me earnestly.\n\n\"Is there anything more?\" I gasped.\n\n\"No,\" said she. \"Is not that enough? Some were in favor of bestowing\nimmediate death, but they were outvoted by the others. You surely\ncannot regret that.\"\n\nLayelah's words sounded like the words of a mocking demon. Yet she did\nnot wish to distress me; she had merely stated my sentence in formal\nlanguage, without any attempt to soften its tremendous import. As for\nme, I was overwhelmed with despair. There was but one thought in my\nmind--it was not of myself, but of Almah.\n\n\"And Almah?\" I cried.\n\n\"Almah,\" said Layelah--\"she will have the same; you are both included\nin the same sentence.\"\n\nAt this a groan burst from me. Horror overwhelmed me. I threw myself\ndown upon the floor and covered my face with my hands. All was lost!\nOur fate--Almah's fate--was darkness, imprisonment, and death. Could\nanything be imagined that might mitigate such woes as these? Could\nanything be conceived of as more horrible? Yes; there remained\nsomething more, and this was announced by Layelah.\n\n\"Finally,\" said she, \"it has been decreed that you shall not only have\nthe blessing of death, but that you shall have the rare honor of\nbelonging to the chosen few who are reserved for the Mista Kosek.\nThus far this had not been granted. It was esteemed too high an honor\nfor strangers; but now, by an exercise of unparalleled liberality, the\nGrand Council of Paupers have added this, as the last and best, to the\nhigh honors and rewards which they have decreed for you and Almah.\"\n\nTo this I had nothing to say; I was stupefied with horror. To such\nwords what answer could be made? At that moment I could think of\nnothing but this tremendous sentence--this infliction of appalling\nwoes under the miserable name of blessings! I could not think of\nLayelah; nor did I try to conjecture what her motives might be in thus\ncoming to me as the messenger of evil. I could not find space amid\nmy despair for speculations as to her own part in this, or stop to\nconsider whether she was acting the part of a mere messenger, or was\ninfluenced by resentment or revenge. All this was far away from my\nthoughts; for all my mind was filled with the dread sentence of the\nCouncil of Paupers and the baleful prospect of the woes that awaited\nus.\n\nOn the next jom I saw Almah. She had already learned the awful\ntidings. She met me with a face of despair; for there was no longer\nany hope, and all that remained for us was a last farewell. After this\nwe parted, and each of us was taken to our respective prison.\n\nI was taken along dark passages until I came to a cavern with a low,\ndark portal. Upon entering I found the darkness deeper than usual,\nand there was only one solitary lamp, which diffused but a feeble ray\nthrough the gloom. The size of the place could not be made out. I\nsaw here a group of human beings, and by the feeble ray of the lamp\nI perceived that they were wan and thin and emaciated, with scant\nclothing, all in rags, squalor, misery, and dirt; with coarse hair\nmatted together, and long nails and shaggy beards. They reminded me in\ntheir personal appearance of the cannibals of the outer shore. These\nhideous beings all gathered around me, blinking at me with their\nbleary eyes and grinning with their abominable faces, and then each\none embraced me. The filth, squalor, and unutterable foulness of\nthese wretches all combined to fill my soul with loathing, and the\ninconceivable horror of that embrace wellnigh overwhelmed me. Yet,\nafter all, it was surpassed by the horror of the thought that Almah\nmight be at that very moment undergoing the same experience; and for\nher such a thing must be worse than for me.\n\nI retreated as far as possible from them, deep into the thick\ndarkness, and sat down. No convicted felon at the last hour of life,\nno prisoner in the dungeons of the Inquisition, ever could have\nsuffered more mental agony than I did at that moment. The blessings,\nthe awful blessings of the Kosekin were descending upon my miserable\nhead--separation from Almah, squalor and dirt, imprisonment, the\nsociety of these filthy creatures, darkness, the shadow of death, and\nbeyond all the tremendous horrors of the Mista Kosek!\n\nI do not know how the time passed, for at first I was almost stupefied\nwith despair; nor could I ever grow reconciled to the society of\nthese wretches, scarce human, who were with me. Some food was\noffered me--filthy stuff, which I refused. My refusal excited warm\ncommendation; but I was warned against starving myself, as that was\nagainst the law. In my despair I thought of my pistol and rifle,\nwhich I still kept with me--of using these against my jailors, and\nbursting forth; but this wild impulse soon passed away, for its utter\nhopelessness was manifest. My only hope, if hope it was, lay in\nwaiting, and it was not impossible that I might see Almah again,\nif only once.\n\nJoms passed away, I know not how. The Chief Pauper, who is the\ngreatest man in the land of the Kosekin, made several attempts to\nconverse with me, and was evidently very condescending and magnanimous\nin his own eyes; but I did not meet his advances graciously--he was\ntoo abhorrent. He was a hideous wretch, with eyes nearly closed and\nbleary, thick, matted hair, and fiendish expression--in short, a devil\nincarnate in rags and squalor.\n\nBut as the joms passed I found it difficult to repel my associates.\nThey were always inflicting their society upon me, and thrusting on me\nnasty little acts of kindness. The Chief Pauper was more persistent\nthan all, with his chatter and his disgusting civilities. He was\nevidently glad to get hold of a fresh subject for his talkative\ngenius; he was a very garrulous cannibal, and perhaps my being a\nforeigner made me more interesting in his eyes.\n\nThe chief topic of his discourse was death. He hated life, loved\ndeath, longed for it in all its forms, whether arising from disease\nor from violence. He was an amateur in corpses, and had a larger\nexperience in dead bodies than any other man in the nation.\n\nI could not help asking him once why he did not kill himself, and be\ndone with it.\n\n\"That,\" said he, \"is not allowed. The temptation to kill one's self is\none of the strongest that human nature can experience, but it is one\nthat we must struggle against, of course, for it is against all law.\nThe greatest blessing must not be seized. It must be given by nature\nor man. Those who violate the blessed mystery of death are infamous.\"\n\nHe assured me that he had all his life cultivated the loftiest\nfeelings of love to others. His greatest happiness consisted in doing\ngood to others, especially in killing them. The blessing of death,\nbeing the greatest of all blessings, was the one which he loved best\nto bestow upon others; and the more he loved his fellow-creatures\nthe more he wished to give them this blessing. \"You,\" said he, \"are\nparticularly dear to me, and I should rather give to you the blessing\nof death than to any other human being. I love you, Atam-or, and I\nlong to kill you at this moment.\"\n\n\"You had better not try it,\" said I, grimly.\n\nHe shook his head despondingly.\n\n\"Oh no,\" said he; \"it is against the law. I must not do it till the\ntime comes.\"\n\n\"Do you kill many?\" I asked.\n\n\"It is my pleasing and glorious office,\" he replied, \"to kill more\nthan any other; for, you must know, I am the Sar Tabakin\" (chief of\nthe executioners).\n\nThe Chief Pauper's love of death had grown to be an all-absorbing\npassion. He longed to give death to all. As with us there are certain\nphilanthropists who have a mania for doing good, so here the pauper\nclass had a mania for doing what they considered good in this way. The\nChief Pauper was a sort of Kosekin Howard or Peabody, and was regarded\nby all with boundless reverence. To me, however, he was an object\nof never-ending hate, abhorrence, and loathing; and, added to this,\nwas the thought that there might be here some equally hideous\nfemale--someone like the nightmare hag of the outer sea--a torment\nand a horror to Almah.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nTHE CEREMONY OF SEPARATION\n\n\nSeparated from Almah, surrounded by foul fiends, in darkness and the\nshadow of death, with the baleful prospect of the Mista Kosek, it\nwas mine to endure the bitterest anguish and despair; and in me these\nfeelings were all the worse from the thought that Almah was in a\nsimilar state, and was enduring equal woes. All that I suffered in my\npresent condition she too was suffering--and from this there was no\npossibility of escape. Perhaps her surroundings were even worse, and\nher sufferings keener; for who could tell what these people might\ninflict in their strange and perverted impulses?\n\nMany joms passed, and there was only one thing that sustained\nme--the hope of seeing Almah yet again, though it were but for a\nmoment. That hope, however, was but faint. There was no escape. The\ngate was barred without and within. I was surrounded by miscreants,\nwho formed the chief class in the state and the ruling order. The\nChief Pauper was the highest magistrate in the land, from whose\nopinion there was no appeal, and the other paupers here formed the\nKosekin senate. Here, in imprisonment and darkness, they formed a\nsecret tribunal and controlled everything. They were objects of envy\nto all. All looked forward to this position as the highest object of\nhuman ambition, and the friends and relatives of those here rejoiced\nin their honor. Their powers were not executive, but deliberative. To\nthe Meleks and Athons was left the exercise of authority, but their\nacts were always in subordination to the will of the paupers.\n\n\"I have everything that heart can wish,\" said the Chief Pauper to\nme once. \"Look at me, Atam-or, and see me as I stand here: I have\npoverty, squalor, cold, perpetual darkness, the privilege of killing\nothers, the near prospect of death, and the certainty of the Mista\nKosek--all these I have, and yet, Atam-or, after all, I am not happy.\"\n\nTo this strange speech I had nothing to say.\n\n\"Yes,\" continued the Chief Pauper, in a pensive tone, \"for twenty\nseasons I have reigned as chief of the Kosekin in this place. My\ncavern is the coldest, squalidest, and darkest in the land. My raiment\nis the coarsest rags. I have separated from all my friends. I have had\nmuch sickness. I have the closest captivity. Death, darkness, poverty,\nwant, all that men most live and long for, are mine to satiety; and\nyet, as I look back and count the joms of my life to see in how many\nI have known happiness, I find that in all they amount to just seven!\nOh, Atam-or, what a comment is this on the vanity of human life!\"\n\nTo this I had no answer ready; but by way of saying something, I\noffered to kill him on the spot.\n\n\"Nay, nay, Atam-or,\" said he, with a melancholy smile, \"do not tempt\nme. Leave me to struggle with temptations by myself, and do not\nseek to make me falter in my duty. Yes, Atam-or, you behold in me a\nmelancholy example of the folly of ambition; for I often think, as\nI look down from my lofty eminence, that after all it is as well to\nremain content in the humble sphere in which we are placed at birth;\nfor perhaps, if the truth were known, there is quite as much real\nhappiness among the rich and splendid--among the Athons and Meleks.\"\n\nOn this occasion I took advantage of the Chief Pauper's softer mood\nto pour forth an earnest entreaty for him to save Almah's life, or at\nleast to mitigate her miseries. Alas! he was inexorable. It was like\nan appeal of some mad prisoner to some gentle-hearted governor in\nChristendom, entreating him to put some fellow-prisoner to death, or\nat least to make his confinement more severe.\n\nThe Chief Pauper stared at me in horror.\n\n\"You are a strange being, Atam-or,\" said he, gently. \"Sometimes I\nthink you mad. I can only say that such a request is horrible to me\nbeyond all words. Such degradation and cruelty to the gentle and\nvirtuous Almah is outrageous and forever impossible; no, we will not\ndeprive her of a single one of those blessings which she now enjoys.\"\n\nI turned away in despair.\n\nAt length one jom the Chief Pauper came to me with a smile and said,\n\n\"Atam-or, let me congratulate you on this joyous occasion.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked.\n\n\"You are to have your ceremony of separation.\"\n\n\"Separation!\" I repeated.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he. \"Almah has given notice to us. She has announced her\nintention of giving you up, and separating from you. With us the\nwoman always gives the announcement in such cases. We have fixed the\nceremony for the third jom from this, and I hope you will not think\nit too soon.\"\n\nThis strange intelligence moved me greatly. I did not like the idea of\na ceremony of separation; but behind this there rose the prospect of\nseeing Almah, and I felt convinced that she had devised this as a mode\nof holding communication with me, or at least of seeing me again.\nThe thought of Layelah was the only thing that interfered with this\nbelief, for it might be her doings after all; yet the fact remained\nthat I was to see Almah, and in this I rejoiced with exceeding great\njoy.\n\nThe appointed jom came. A procession was formed of the paupers. The\nchief did not go, as he never left the cavern except on the great\nsacrifices and Mista Koseks. The door was opened, and I accompanied\nthe procession. On our way all was dark, and after traversing many\npassages we came at length to the door of a cavern as gloomy as the\none I had left. On entering this I found all dark and drear; and a\nlittle distance before me there was a light burning, around which was\ngathered a group of hags hideous beyond all expression. But these I\nscarcely noticed; for there amid them, all pale and wan, with her face\nnow lighted up with joyous and eager expectation, I saw my darling--my\nAlmah! I caught her in my arms, and for a few moments neither of us\nspoke a word. She sobbed upon my breast, but I knew that the tears\nwhich she shed were tears of joy. Nor was our joy checked by the\nthought that it was to be so short-lived. It was enough at that moment\nthat we saw one another--enough that we were in one another's arms;\nand so we mingled our tears, and shared one common rapture. And sweet\nit was--sweet beyond all expression--the sweetest moment in all my\nlife; for it had come in the midst of the drear desolation of my heart\nand the black despair. It was like a flash of lightning in the intense\ndarkness, short and sudden indeed, yet still intense while it lasted,\nand in an instant filling all with its glow.\n\n\"I did this,\" murmured Almah, \"to see you and to save you.\"\n\n\"Save me!\" I repeated.\n\n\"Yes,\" said she. \"I have seen Layelah. She told me that there is this\nchance and this one only to save you. I determined to try it. I cannot\nbear to think of you at the sacrifice--and for love of me meeting your\ndeath--for I would die to save you, Atam-or.\"\n\nI pressed her closer in my arms.\n\n\"Oh, Almah,\" said I, \"I would die to save you! and if this ceremony\nwill save you I will go through with it, and accept my fate whatever\nit may be.\"\n\nWe were now interrupted.\n\nThe women--the hags of horror--the shriek-like ones, as I may call\nthem, or the fiend-like, the female fiends, the foul ones--they were\nall around us; and one there was who looked so exactly like the\nnightmare hag of the outer sea that I felt sure she must be the same,\nwho by some strange chance had come here. Such, indeed, is quite\nlikely, for there may have been a pass over the mountains to the land\nof the Kosekin; and those savage cannibals may all have been honored\nKosekin exiles, dwelling in poverty, want, woe, and darkness, all of\nwhich may have been allotted to them as a reward for eminent virtues.\nAnd so here she was, the nightmare hag, and I saw that she recognized\nme.\n\nA circle was now formed around us, and the light stood in the middle.\nThe nightmare hag also stood within the circle on the other side of\nthe light opposite us. The beams of the lamp flickered through the\ndarkness, faintly illuminating the faces of the horrible creatures\naround, who, foul and repulsive as harpies, seemed like unclean\nbeasts, ready to make us their prey. Their glances seemed to menace\ndeath; their blear eyes rested upon us with a horrid eager hunger. My\nworst fears at that moment seemed realized; for I saw that Almah's\nassociates were worse than mine, and her fate had been more bitter.\nAnd I wondered how it had been possible for her to live among such\nassociates; or, even though she had lived thus far, whether it would\nbe possible for her to endure it longer.\n\nAnd now there arose a melancholy chant from the old hags around--a\ndreadful strain, that sounded like a funeral dirge, sung in shrill,\ndiscordant voices, led by the nightmare hag, who as she sang waved\nin her hand a kind of club. All the time I held Almah in my arms,\nregardless of those around us, thinking only of her from whom I must\nsoon again be separated, and whom I must leave in this drear abode to\nmeet her fearful fate alone. The chant continued for some time, and as\nlong as it continued it was sweet to me; for it prolonged the meeting\nwith Almah, and postponed by so much our separation.\n\nAt length the chant ceased. The nightmare hag looked fixedly at us,\nand spoke these words:\n\n\"You have embraced for the last time. Henceforth there is no more\nsorrow in your love. You may be happy now in being forever disunited,\nand in knowing the bliss of eternal separation. As darkness is better\nthan light, as death is better than life, so may you find separation\nbetter than union.\"\n\nShe now gave a blow with her club at the lamp, which broke it to atoms\nand extinguished the flame. She continued:\n\n\"As the baleful light is succeeded by the blessed darkness, so may\nyou find the light of union followed by the blessed darkness of\nseparation.\"\n\nAnd now in the deep darkness we stood clasped in one another's arms;\nwhile around us, from the horrible circle of hags, there arose\nanother chant as harsh and discordant as the previous one, but which,\nnevertheless, like that, served at least to keep us together a little\nlonger. For this reason it sounded sweeter than the sweetest music;\nand therefore, when at last the hideous noise ended, I felt a pang of\ngrief, for I knew that I must now give up Almah forever.\n\nI was right. The ceremony was over. We had to part, and we parted with\ntears of despair. I was led away, and as I went I heard Almah's sobs.\nI broke away, and tried to return for one more embrace; but in the\ndarkness I could not find her, and could only hear her sobs at a\ngreater distance, which showed that she too was being led away. I\ncalled after her,\n\n\"Farewell, Almah!\"\n\nHer reply came back broken with sobs.\n\n\"Farewell forever, Atam-or!\"\n\nI was once more led away, and again traversed the dark passages, and\nagain came back to my den, which now seemed dark with the blackness\nof despair.\n\nOn my return I was formally and solemnly congratulated by all the\npaupers. I should not have received their congratulations had I not\nexpected that there would be something more. I expected that something\nwould be said about the result of this act of separation; for Almah\nhad believed that it would be the means of saving my life, and I\nbelieved that it would be the means of saving her life, and for this\nreason each of us had performed our part; although, of course, the joy\nof meeting with one another would of itself have been sufficient, and\nmore than sufficient, to make that ceremony an object of desire. I\nthought, therefore, that some statement might now be made to the\neffect that by means of this ceremony my status among the Kosekin\nwould be changed, and that both I and Almah, being no longer\nlovers, would be no longer fit for the sacrifice. To my intense\ndisappointment, however, nothing whatever was said that had the\nremotest reference to this.\n\nOn the following jom I determined to ask the Chief Pauper himself\ndirectly; and accordingly, after a brief preamble, I put the question\npoint-blank:\n\n\"Will our ceremony of separation make any difference as to our\nsacrifice?\"\n\n\"What?\" he asked, with a puzzled expression.\n\nI repeated the question.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" said he, still looking puzzled.\n\nUpon this I once more repeated it.\n\n\"How can that be?\" said he at length; \"how can the ceremony of\nseparation have any effect upon your sacrifice? The ceremony of\nseparation stands by itself as the sign and symbol of an additional\nblessing. This new happiness of separation is a great favor, and will\nmake you the object of new envy and admiration; for few have been so\nfortunate as you in all the history of the Kosekin. But you are the\nfavorite of the Kosekin now, and there is nothing that they will not\ndo for you.\"\n\n\"But we were separate before,\" said I, indignantly.\n\n\"That is true,\" said he, \"in point of fact; but this ceremony makes\nyour separation a legal thing, and gives it the solemn sanction of\nlaw and of religion. Among the Kosekin one cannot be considered as\na separate man until the ceremony of separation has been publicly\nperformed.\"\n\n\"I understood,\" said I, \"that we were chosen to suffer the sacrifice\ntogether because we were lovers, and now since you do not any longer\nregard us as lovers, why do you sacrifice us?\"\n\nAt this question the Chief Pauper looked at me with one of those\nhungry glances of his, which showed how he thirsted for my blood, and\nhe smiled the smile of an evil fiend.\n\n\"Why do we sacrifice you, Atam-or?\" he replied. \"Why, because we honor\nyou both, and love you both so dearly that we are eager to give you\nthe greatest of all blessings, and to deny you nothing that is in our\npower to bestow.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to sacrifice both of us?\" I gasped.\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"What! Almah too?\"\n\n\"Certainly. Why should we be so cruel to the dear child as to deprive\nher of so great a boon?\"\n\nAt this I groaned aloud and turned away in despair.\n\nMany joms now passed away. I grew more and more melancholy and\ndesperate. I thought sometimes of fighting my way out. My fire-arms\nwere now my chief consolation; for I had fully made up my mind not to\ndie quietly like a slaughtered calf, but to strike a blow for life,\nand meet my death amid slain enemies. In this prospect I found some\nsatisfaction, and death was robbed of some of its terrors.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nTHE DAY OF SACRIFICE\n\n\nAt last the time came.\n\nIt was the end of the dark season. Then, as the sun rises for its\npermanent course around the heavens, when the long day of six months\nbegins, all in the land of the Kosekin is sorrow, and the last of the\nloved darkness is mourned over amid the most solemn ceremonies, and\ncelebrated with the most imposing sacrifices. Then the most honored\nin all the land are publicly presented with the blessing of death,\nand allowed to depart this hated life, and go to the realms of that\neternal darkness which they love so well. It is the greatest of\nsacrifices, and is followed by the greatest of feasts. Thus the busy\nseason--the loved season of darkness--ends, and the long, hateful\nseason of light begins, when the Kosekin lurk in caverns, and live in\nthis way in the presence of what may be called artificial darkness.\n\nIt was for us--for me and for Almah--the day of doom. Since the\nceremony of separation I had not seen her; but my heart had been\nalways with her. I did not even know whether she was alive or not, but\nbelieved that she must be; for I thought that if she had died I should\nhave heard of it, as the Kosekin would have rejoiced greatly over such\nan event. For every death is to them an occasion of joy, and the death\nof one so distinguished and so beloved as Almah would have given rise\nto nothing less than a national festival.\n\nOf time I had but a poor reckoning; but, from the way in which the\npaupers kept account of their joms, I judged that about three months\nhad elapsed since the ceremony of separation.\n\nThe paupers were now all joyous with a hideous joy. The Chief Pauper\nwas more abhorrent than ever. He had the blood-thirst strong upon\nhim. He was on that jom to perform his horrible office of Sar\nTabakin, and as he accosted me he smiled the smile of a demon, and\ncongratulated me on my coming escape from life. To this I had no word\nof answer to make; but my hands held my rifle and pistol, and these I\nclutched with a firmer grasp as my last hour approached.\n\nThe time of departure at length arrived. Soldiers of the Kosekin came,\nfollowing the paupers, who went first, while the guards came after me.\nThus we all emerged into the open air. There the broad terrace already\nmentioned spread out before my eyes, filled with thousands upon\nthousands of human beings. It seemed as though the entire population\nof the city was there, and so densely packed was this great crowd that\nit was only with great difficulty that a way was laid open for our\npassage.\n\nAbove was the sky, where the stars were twinkling faintly. There was\nno longer the light of the aurora australis; the constellations\nglimmered but dimly, the moon was shining with but a feeble ray; for\nthere far away over the icy crests of the lofty mountains I saw a long\nline of splendid effulgence, all golden and red--the light of the new\ndawn--the dawn of that long day which was now approaching. The sight\nof that dawning light gave me new life. It was like a sight of\nhome--the blessed dawn, the sunlight of a bright day, the glorious\ndaybreak lost for so long a time, but now at last returning. I feasted\nmy eyes on the spectacle, I burst into tears of joy, and I felt as\nthough I could gaze at it forever. But the sun as it travelled was\nrapidly coming into view; soon the dazzling glory of its rim would\nappear above the mountain crest, and the season of darkness would end.\nThere was no time to wait, and the guards hurried me on.\n\nThere in the midst of the square rose the pyramid. It was fully a\nhundred feet in height, with a broad flat top. At the base I saw a\ngreat crowd of paupers. Through these we passed, and as we did so\na horrible death-chant arose. We now went up the steps and reached\nthe top. It was about sixty feet square, and upon it there was a\nquadrangle of stones set about three feet apart, about sixty in\nnumber, while in the midst was a larger stone. All of these were\nevidently intended for sacrificial purposes.\n\nScarcely had I reached the top when I saw a procession ascend from\nthe other side. First came some paupers, then some hags, and then,\nfollowed by other hags, I saw Almah. I was transfixed at the sight. A\nthrill passed through every nerve, and a wild impulse came to me to\nburst through the crowd, join her, and battle with them all for her\nlife. But the crowd was too dense. I could only stand and look at her,\nand mark the paleness of her face and her mute despair. She saw me,\nwaved her hand sadly, and gave a mournful smile. There we stood\nseparated by the crowd, with our eyes fastened on each other, and\nall our hearts filled with one deep, intense yearning to fly to one\nanother's side.\n\nAnd now there came up from below, louder and deeper, the awful\ndeath-chant. Time was pressing. The preparations were made. The Chief\nPauper took his station by the central stone, and in his right hand he\nheld a long, keen knife. Toward this stone I was led. The Chief Pauper\nthen looked with his blear and blinking eyes to where the dawn was\nglowing over the mountain crest, and every moment increasing in\nbrightness; and then, after a brief survey, he turned and whetted his\nknife on the sacrificial stone. After this he turned to me with his\nevil face, with the glare of a horrid death-hunger in his ravenous\neyes, and pointed to the stone.\n\nI stood without motion.\n\nHe repeated the gesture and said, \"Lie down here.\"\n\n\"I will not,\" said I.\n\n\"But it is on this stone,\" said he, \"that you are to get the blessing\nof death.\"\n\n\"I'll die first!\" said I, fiercely, and I raised my rifle.\n\nThe Chief Pauper was puzzled at this. The others looked on quietly,\nthinking it probably a debate about some punctilio. Suddenly he seemed\nstruck with an idea.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said he. \"The woman first. It is better so.\"\n\nSaying this he walked toward Almah, and said something to the hags.\n\nAt this the chief of them--namely, the nightmare hag--led Almah to the\nnearest stone, and motioned to her to lie down. Almah prepared to\nobey, but paused a moment to throw at me one last glance and wave her\nhand as a last farewell. Then without a word she laid herself down\nupon the stone. At this a thrill of fury rushed through all my being,\nrousing me from my stupor, impelling me to action, filling my brain\nwith madness. The nightmare hag had already raised her long keen knife\nin the air. Another moment and the blow would have fallen. But my\nrifle was at my shoulder; my aim was deadly. The report rang out like\nthunder. A wild, piercing yell followed, and when the smoke cleared\naway the nightmare hag lay dead at the foot of the altar. I was\nalready there, having burst through the astonished crowd, and Almah\nwas in my arms; and holding her thus for a moment, I put myself in\nfront of her and stood at bay, with my only thought that of defending\nher to the last and selling my life as dearly as possible.\n\nThe result was amazing.\n\nAfter the report there was for some moments a deep silence, which was\nfollowed by a wild, abrupt outcry from half a million people--the roar\nof indistinguishable words bursting forth from the lips of all that\nthrong, whose accumulated volume arose in one vast thunder-clap of\nsound, pealing forth, echoing along the terraced streets, and rolling\non far away in endless reverberations. It was like the roar of mighty\ncataracts, like the sound of many waters; and at the voice of that\nvast multitude I shrank back for a moment. As I did so I looked down,\nand beheld a scene as appalling as the sound that had overawed me. In\nall that countless throng of human beings there was not one who was\nnot in motion; and all were pressing forward toward the pyramid as\nto a common centre. On every side there was a multitudinous sea of\nupturned faces, extending as far as the eye could reach. All were in\nviolent agitation, as though all were possessed by one common impulse\nwhich forced them toward me. At such a sight I thought of nothing else\nthan that I was the object of their wrath, and that they were all with\none common fury rushing toward me to wreak vengeance upon me and upon\nAlmah for the slaughter of the nightmare hag.\n\nAll this was the work of but a few moments. And now as I stood there\nholding Almah--appalled, despairing, yet resolute and calm--I became\naware of a more imminent danger. On the top of the pyramid, at the\nreport of the rifle, all had fallen down flat on their faces, and\nit was over them that I had rushed to Almah's side. But these now\nbegan to rise, and the hags took up the corpse of the dead, and the\npaupers swarmed around with cries of \"Mut! mut!\" (dead! dead!) and\nexclamations of wonder. Then they all turned their foul and bleary\neyes toward me, and stood as if transfixed with astonishment. At\nlength there burst forth from the crowd one who sought to get at me.\nIt was the Chief Pauper. He still held in his hand the long knife of\nsacrifice. He said not a word, but rushed straight at me, and as he\ncame I saw murder in his look. I did not wait for him, but raising my\nrifle, discharged the second barrel full in his face. He fell down a\nshattered, blackened heap, dead.\n\nAs the second report thundered out it drowned all other sounds, and\nwas again followed by an awful silence. I looked around. Those on the\npyramid--paupers and hags--had again flung themselves on their faces.\nOn the square below the whole multitude were on their knees, with\ntheir heads bowed down low. The silence was more oppressive than\nbefore; it was appalling--it was tremendous! It seemed like the dread\nsilence that precedes the more awful outburst of the hurricane when\nthe storm is gathering up all its strength to burst with accumulated\nfury upon its doomed victim.\n\nBut there was no time to be lost in staring, and that interval was\noccupied by me in hastily reloading my rifle. It was my last resource\nnow; and if it availed not for defence it might at least serve to be\nused against ourselves. With this thought I handed the pistol to\nAlmah, and hurriedly whispered to her that if I were killed, she could\nuse it against herself. She took it in silence, but I read in her face\nher invincible resolve.\n\nThe storm at last burst. The immense multitude rose to their feet, and\nwith one common impulse came pressing on from every side toward the\npyramid, apparently filled with the one universal desire of reaching\nme--a desire which was now all the more intense and vehement from\nthese interruptions which had taken place. Why they had fallen on\ntheir knees, why the paupers on the pyramid were still prostrate, I\ncould not tell; but I saw now the swarming multitude, and I felt that\nthey were rolling in on every side--merciless, blood-thirsty,\nimplacable--to tear me to pieces. Yet time passed and they did not\nreach me, for an obstacle was interposed. The pyramid had smooth\nsides. The stairways that led up to the summit were narrow, and did\nnot admit of more than two at a time; yet, had the Kosekin been like\nother people, the summit of the pyramid would soon have been swarming\nwith them; but as they were Kosekin, none came up to the top; for at\nthe base of the pyramid, at the bottom of the steps, I saw a strange\nand incredible struggle. It was not, as with us, who should go up\nfirst, but who should go up last; each tried to make his neighbor go\nbefore him. All were eager to go, but the Kosekin self-denial,\nself-sacrifice, and love for the good of others made each one\nintensely desirous to make others go up. This resulted in a furious\nstruggle, in which, as fast as anyone would be pushed up the steps a\nlittle way, he would jump down again and turn his efforts toward\nputting up others; and thus all the energies of the people were worn\nout in useless and unavailing efforts--in a struggle to which, from\nthe very nature of the case, there could be no end.\n\nNow those on the pyramid began to rise, and soon all were on their\nfeet. Cries burst forth from them. All were looking at us, but with\nnothing like hostility; it was rather like reverence and adoration,\nand these feelings were expressed unmistakably in their cries, among\nwhich I could plainly distinguish such words as these: \"Ap Ram!\"\n\"Mosel anan wacosek!\" \"Sopet Mut!\" (The Father of Thunder! Ruler of\nCloud and Darkness! Judge of Death!) These cries passed to those\nbelow. The struggle ceased. All stood and joined in the cry, which was\ntaken up by those nearest, and soon passed among all those myriads, to\nbe repeated with thunder echoes far and wide.\n\nAt this it suddenly became plain to me that the danger of death had\npassed away; that these people no longer regarded me as a victim, but\nrather as some mighty being--some superior, perhaps supernatural\npower, who was to be almost worshipped. Hence these prostrations,\nthese words, these cries, these looks. All these told me that the\nbitterness of death had passed away. At this discovery there was, for\na moment, a feeling of aversion and horror within me at filling such a\nposition; that I, a weak mortal, should dare to receive adoration like\nthis; and I recoiled at the thought: yet this feeling soon passed; for\nlife was at stake--not my own merely, but that of Almah; and I was\nready now to go through anything if only I might save her: so, instead\nof shrinking from this new part, I eagerly seized upon it, and at once\ndetermined to take advantage of the popular superstition to the\nutmost.\n\nFar away over the crests of the mountains I saw the golden edge of the\nsun's disc, and the light flowed therefrom in broad effulgence,\nthrowing out long rays of glory in a luminous flood over all the land.\nI pointed to the glorious orb, and cried to the paupers, and to all\nwho were nearest, in a loud voice:\n\n\"I am Atam-or, the Man of Light! I come from the land of light! I am\nthe Father of Thunder, of Cloud and Darkness; the Judge of Death!\"\n\nAt this the paupers all fell prostrate, and cried out to me to give\nthem the blessing of death.\n\nI made no answer, but leading Almah to the edge of the pyramid, told\nher to fire the pistol. A million eyes were fixed on us. She held up\nthe pistol and fired. Immediately after, I fired both barrels of the\nrifle; and as the reports rang out and the smoke cleared away, I heard\na mighty murmur, and once more beheld all prostrate. Upon this I\nhurriedly loaded again, and waited for further revelations. All the\ntime I could not help wondering at the effect produced by the rifle\nnow, in comparison with the indifference with which it had been\nregarded at my first arrival in the country. I could not account for\nit, but supposed that the excitement of a great religious festival and\nthe sudden death of the Chief Pauper and the Chief Hag had probably\ndeeply impressed them. In the midst of these thoughts the whole\nmultitude arose; and once more there came to my ears the universal\nuproar of innumerable cries, in the midst of which I could hear the\nwords, \"Ap Ram!\" \"Mosel anan wacosek!\" \"Sopet Mut!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nIn the midst of this the paupers and the hags talked earnestly\ntogether. Some of those who had been nearest in rank to the late Chief\nPauper and Chief Hag were conspicuous in the debate. All looked at me\nand at Almah, and pointed toward the sun, which was wheeling along\nbehind the distant mountain crest, showing a golden disc. Then they\npointed to the dead bodies; and the hags took the Chief Hag, and the\npaupers the Chief Pauper, and laid them side by side on the central\naltar. After this a hag and a pauper advanced toward us, each carrying\nthe sacrificial knife which had belonged to the deceased.\n\nThe hag spoke first, addressing Almah, in accordance with the Kosekin\ncustom, which requires women to take the precedence in many things.\n\n\"Take this,\" she said, \"O Almah, consort of Atam-or, and Co-ruler of\nClouds and Darkness. Henceforth you shall be Judge of Death to the\nwomen of the Kosekin.\"\n\nShe then handed Almah the sacrificial knife of the Chief Hag, which\nAlmah took in silence.\n\nThen the pauper presented me with the sacrificial knife of the Chief\nPauper, with the following words:\n\n\"Take this, O Atam-or, Father of Thunder and Ruler of Clouds and\nDarkness. Henceforth you shall be Judge of Death to the men of the\nKosekin, and Sar Tabakin over the whole nation.\"\n\nI received the knife in silence, for I had nothing to say; but now\nAlmah spoke, as was fitting for her to do, since with the Kosekin the\nwomen must take the precedence; and here it was expected that she\nshould reply in behalf of both of us.\n\nSo Almah, holding the sacrificial knife, stood looking at them, full\nof dignity, and spoke as follows:\n\n\"We will take this, O Kosekin, and we will reward you all. We will\nbegin our reign over the Kosekin with memorable acts of mercy. These\ntwo great victims shall be enough for the Mista Kosek of this\nseason. The victims designed for this sacrifice shall have to deny\nthemselves the blessing of death, yet they shall be rewarded in other\nways; and all the land from the highest to the lowest shall have\nreason to rejoice in our rule.\n\n\"To all you hags and paupers we grant the splendid and unparalleled\nboon of exile to Magones. There you can have all the suffering which\nheart can wish, and inevitable death. To all classes and ranks in\nthe whole nation we promise to grant a diminution in their wealth by\none-quarter. In the abundance of our mercy we are willing ourselves to\nbear the burden of all the offerings that may be necessary in order to\naccomplish this. All in the land may at once give up one-quarter of\ntheir whole wealth to us.\"\n\nAt this the hags and paupers gave a horrible yell of applause.\n\n\"As rulers of Light and Darkness, we will henceforth govern the nation\nin the light as well as in the dark. We will sacrifice ourselves so\nfar to the public good as to live in the light, and in open palaces.\nWe will consent to undergo the pains of light and splendor, to endure\nall the evils of luxury, magnificence, and boundless wealth, for the\ngood of the Kosekin nation. We will consent to forego the right of\nseparation, and agree to live together, even though we love one\nanother. Above all, we will refuse death and consent to live. Can any\nrulers do more than this for the good of their people?\"\n\nAnother outburst of applause followed.\n\n\"In three joms,\" continued Almah, \"all you hags and paupers shall be\nsent to exile and death on Magones. As for the rest of the Kosekin,\nhear our words. Tell them from us that the laborers shall all be\nelevated to the rank of paupers, the artisans shall be made laborers,\nthe tradesmen artisans, the soldiers tradesmen, the Athons soldiers,\nthe Kohens Athons, and the Meleks Kohens. There shall be no Meleks in\nall the land. We, in our love for the Kosekin, will henceforth be the\nonly Meleks. Then all the misery of that low station will rest on us;\nand in our low estate as Meleks we shall govern this nation in love\nand self-denial. Tell them that we will forego the sacrifice and\nconsent to live; that we will give up darkness and cavern gloom and\nlive in light. Tell them to prepare for us the splendid palaces of the\nMeleks, for we will take the most sumptuous and magnificent of them\nall. Tell all the people to present their offerings. Tell them that we\nconsent to have endless retinues of servants, soldiers, followers, and\nattendants. Tell them that with the advent of Almah and Atam-or a new\nera begins for the Kosekin, in which every man may be as poor as he\nlikes, and riches shall be unknown in the land.\"\n\nThese extraordinary words seemed to fill the paupers with rapture.\nExclamations of joy burst from them; they prostrated themselves in an\nirrepressible impulse of grateful admiration, as though such promises\ncould only come from superior beings. Then most of them hurried down\nto communicate to the people below the glorious intelligence. Soon it\nspread from mouth to mouth, and all the people were filled with the\nwildest excitement.\n\nFor never before had such a thing been known, and never had such\nself-sacrifice been imagined or thought possible, as that the rulers\nof the Kosekin could consent to be rich when they might be paupers; to\nlive together when they might be separate; to dwell in the light when\nthey might lurk in the deepest cavern gloom; to remain in life when\nthey might have the blessing of death. Selfishness, fear of death,\nlove of riches, and love of luxury, these were all unintelligible to\nthe Kosekin, as much as to us would be self-abnegation, contempt of\ndeath, voluntary poverty, and asceticism. But as with us self-denying\nrulers may make others rich and be popular for this, so here among the\nKosekin a selfish ruler might be popular by making others poor. Hence\nthe words of Almah, as they were made known, gave rise to the wildest\nexcitement and enthusiasm, and the vast multitude poured forth their\nfeelings in long shouts of rapturous applause.\n\nAmid this the bodies of the dead were carried down from the pyramid,\nand were taken to the Mista Kosek in a long and solemn procession,\naccompanied by the singing of wild and dismal chants.\n\nAnd now the sun, rolling along behind the icy mountain crest, rose\nhigher and higher every moment, and the bright light of a long day\nbegan to illumine the world. There sparkled the sea, rising far away\nlike a watery wall, with the horizon high up in the sky; there rose\nthe circle of giant mountains, sweeping away till they were blended\nwith the horizon; there rose the terraces of the amir, all glowing\nin the sunlight, with all its countless houses and cavern-openings and\narching trees and pointing pyramids. Above was the canopy of heaven,\nno longer black, no longer studded with stars or glistening with\nthe fitful shimmer of the aurora, but all radiant with the glorious\nsunlight, and disclosing all the splendors of the infinite blue. At\nthat sight a thrill of joy passed through me. The long, long night\nat last was over; the darkness had passed away like some hideous\ndream; the day was here--the long day that was to know no shadow\nand no decline--when all this world should be illuminated by the\never-circling sun--a sun that would never set until his long course\nof many months should be fully run. My heart swelled with rapture,\nmy eyes filled with tears. \"O Light!\" I cried; \"O gleaming, golden\nSunlight! O Light of Heaven!--light that brings life and hope to man!\"\nAnd I could have fallen on my knees and worshipped that rising sun.\n\nBut the light which was so glorious to us was painful and distressing\nto the Kosekin. On the top of the pyramid the paupers crouched,\nshading their eyes. The crowd below began to disperse in all\ndirections, so as to betake themselves to their coverts and to the\ncaverns, where they might live in the dark. Soon nearly all were gone\nexcept the paupers at the foot of the pyramid, who were awaiting our\ncommands, and a crowd of Meleks and Athons at a distance. At a gesture\nfrom me the few paupers near us descended and joined those below.\n\nAlmah and I were alone on the top of the pyramid.\n\nI caught her in my arms in a rapture of joy. This revulsion from the\nlowest despair--from darkness and from death back to hope and light\nand life--was almost too much to endure. We both wept, but our tears\nwere those of happiness.\n\n\"You will be all my own now,\" said I, \"and we can fly from this\nhateful land. We can be united--we can be married--here before we\nstart--and you will not be cruel enough to refuse. You will consent,\nwill you not, to be my wife before we fly from the Kosekin?\"\n\nAt this Almah's face became suffused with smiles and blushes. Her\narms were about me, and she did not draw away, but looked up in sweet\nconfusion and said,\n\n\"Why, as to that--I--I cannot be more your--your wife than I am.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I exclaimed, in wonder. \"My wife!\"\n\nHer eyes dropped again, and she whispered:\n\n\"The ceremony of separation is with the Kosekin the most sacred form\nof marriage. It is the religious form; the other is merely the civil\nform.\"\n\nThis was unintelligible, nor did I try to understand it. It was enough\nto hear this from her own sweet lips; but it was a strange feeling,\nand I think I am the only man since Adam that ever was married without\nknowing it.\n\n\"As to flight,\" continued Almah, who had quite adopted the Kosekin\nfashion, which makes women take the lead--\"as to flight, we need not\nhurry. We are all-powerful now, and there is no more danger. We must\nwait until we send embassies to my people, and when they are ready to\nreceive us, we will go. But now let us leave this, for our servants\nare waiting for us, and the light is distressing to them. Let us go to\nthe nearest of our palaces and obtain rest and food.\"\n\n\nHere Featherstone stopped, yawned, and laid down the manuscript.\n\n\"That's enough for to-day,\" said he; \"I'm tired, and can't read any\nmore. It's time for supper.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Strange Manuscript Found in a Copper\nCylinder, by James De Mille\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A STRANGE MANUSCRIPT ***\n\n***** This file should be named 6709.txt or 6709.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/6\/7\/0\/6709\/\n\nProduced by Andrew Sly\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":524,"split":"train"}
