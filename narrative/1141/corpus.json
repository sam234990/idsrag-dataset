{"ori_id":"17f2e2685467b6eebf01d2a643e31f53ea215e91","title":"Marianela (novel)","context":"Marianela (novel)\n The novel takes place in the fictional town of Socartes, Spain. The town's name refers to the philosopher Socrates and his ideas about internal and external beauty. It tells the story of Marianela (sometimes referred to as \"Nela\"), a poor orphan girl with an ugly face, and her love for Pablo, a blind boy, who has feelings for Nela as well. Marianela frequently sings to Pablo, and he believes she is beautiful because of her voice. Pablo's father asks a famous doctor, named Teodoro Golfin, to come and examine Pedro to see if his sight can be restored. Pablo, full of hope at the prospect, promises La Nela that he will marry her after the operation if it is successful. He is convinced that La Nela is beautiful, even when she tells him otherwise. In the meantime, Pablo's father plans for Pablo to marry his beautiful cousin, Florentina, but tells neither of them about it. Florentina comes to Socartes and when Marianela first sees her, she mistakes her for the Virgin Mary because of her beauty. When Florentina is out walking with Pablo and Marianela, she expresses her pity for La Nela because she is poor, abandoned and nobody loves her. She vows to take charge of Nela and clothe, educate her, and have La Nela live with her like a sister.\nPablo eventually gets the operation that gives him his sight. Before seeing Nela, he sees Florentina and proposes to her instead. Because of this, Nela attempts suicide but is saved by Teodoro Golf\u0102\u00adn, the eye doctor who cured Pedro. He and Florentina take Nela to Pablo's villa and take care of her while she is hiding away from Pablo because of her looks. Then, due to Pablo's desire to see her, Pablo finds his way to La Nela's room and serenades Florentina. He then sees La Nela in bed and confuses her for \"just a poor girl who Don Teodoro took in from the street.\" La Nela then admits it is she and kisses his hand three times. Upon the third kiss, she dies of a broken heart and leaves Pablo distraught.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Marianela, by Benito P\u00c3\u00a9rez Gald\u00c3\u00b3s\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most\nother parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions\nwhatsoever.

After the brief interval of twilight the night fell\ncalm and dark, and in its gloomy bosom the last sounds of a sleepy\nworld died gently away. The traveller went forward on his way,\nhastening his step as night came on; the path he followed was narrow\nand worn by the constant tread of men and beasts, and led gently up a\nhill on whose verdant slopes grew picturesque clumps of wild cherry\ntrees, beeches and oaks.--The reader perceives that we are in the north\nof Spain.\n\nOur traveller was a man of middle age, strongly built, tall and\nbroad-shouldered; his movements were brisk and resolute, his step\nfirm, his manner somewhat rugged, his eye bold and bright; his pace\nwas nimble, considering that he was decidedly stout, and he was--the\nreader may at once be told, though somewhat prematurely--as good a\nsoul as you may meet with anywhere. He was dressed, as a man in easy\ncircumstances should be dressed for a journey in spring weather, with\none of those round shady hats, which, from their ugly shape, have been\nnicknamed mushrooms (_hongo_), a pair of field-glasses hanging to a\nstrap, and a knotted stick which, when he did not use it to support his\nsteps, served to push aside the brambles when they flung their thorny\nbranches across so as to catch his dress.\n\nHe presently stopped, and gazing round the dim horizon, he seemed vexed\nand puzzled. He evidently was not sure of his way and was looking\nround for some passing native of the district who might give him such\ntopographical information as might enable him to reach his destination.\n\n\"I cannot be mistaken,\" he said to himself. \"They told me to cross the\nriver by the stepping-stones--and I did so--then to walk on, straight\non. And there, to my right, I do in fact, see that detestable town\nwhich I should call _Villafangosa_ by reason of the enormous amount of\nmud that chokes the streets.--Well then, I can but go 'on, straight\non'--I rather like the phrase, and if I bore arms, I would adopt it\nfor my motto--in order to find myself at last at the famous mines of\nSocartes.\"\n\nBut before he had gone much farther, he added: \"I have lost my way,\nbeyond a doubt I have lost my way.--This, Teodoro Golfin, is the\nresult of your 'on, straight on.' Bah! these blockheads do not know\nthe meaning of words; either they meant to laugh at you or else\nthey did not know the way to the mines of Socartes. A huge mining\nestablishment must be evident to the senses, with its buildings and\nchimneys, its noise of hammers and snorting of furnaces, neighing of\nhorses and clattering of machinery--and I neither see, nor hear, nor\nsmell anything. I might be in a desert! How absolutely solitary! If I\nbelieved in witches, I could fancy that Fate intended me this night to\nhave the honor of making acquaintance with some. Deuce take it! why is\nthere no one to be seen in these parts? And it will be half an hour\nyet before the moon rises. Ah! treacherous Luna, it is you who are to\nblame for my misadventure.--If only I could see what sort of place I\nam in.--However, what could I expect?\" and he shrugged his shoulders\nwith the air of a vigorous man who scorns danger. \"What, Golfin, after\nhaving wandered all round the world are you going to give in now? The\npeasants were right after all: 'on, straight on.' The universal law of\nlocomotion cannot fail me here.\"\n\nAnd he bravely set out to test the law, and went on about a kilometre\nfarther, following the paths which seemed to start from under his feet,\ncrossing each other and breaking off at a short distance, in a thousand\nangles which puzzled and tired him. Stout as his resolution was, at\nlast he grew weary of his vain efforts. The paths, which had at first\nall led upwards, began to slope downwards as they crossed each other,\nand at last he came to so steep a slope that he could only hope to get\nto the bottom by rolling down it.\n\n\"A pretty state of things!\" he exclaimed, trying to console himself for\nthis provoking situation by his sense of the ridiculous. \"Where have\nyou got to now my friend? This is a perfect abyss. Is anything to be\nseen at the bottom. No, nothing, absolutely nothing--the hill-side has\ndisappeared, the earth has been dug away. There is nothing to be seen\nbut stones and barren soil tinged red with iron. I have reached the\nmines, no doubt of that--and yet there is not a living soul to be seen,\nno smoky chimneys; no noise, not a train in the distance, not even a\ndog barking. What am I to do? Out there the path seems to slope up\nagain.--Shall I follow that? Shall I leave the beaten track? Shall I go\nback again? Oh! this is absurd! Either I am not myself or I will reach\nSocartes to-night, and be welcomed by my worthy brother! 'On, straight\non.'\"\n\nHe took a step, and his foot sank in the soft and crumbling soil.\n\"What next, ye ruling stars? Am I to be swallowed up alive? If only\nthat lazy moon would favor us with a little light we might see each\nother's faces--and, upon my soul, I can hardly expect to find Paradise\nat the bottom of this hole. It seems to be the crater of some extinct\nvolcano.... Nothing could be easier than a slide down this beautiful\nprecipice. What have we here?... A stone; capital--a good seat while I\nsmoke a cigar and wait for the moon to rise.\"\n\nThe philosophical Golfin seated himself as calmly as if it were a\nbench by a promenade, and was preparing for his smoke, when he heard a\nvoice--yes, beyond a doubt, a human voice, at some little distance--a\nplaintive air, or to speak more accurately, a melancholy chant of a\nsingle phrase, of which the last cadence was prolonged into a \"dying\nfall,\" and which at last sank into the silence of the night, so softly\nthat the ear could not detect when it ceased.\n\n\"Come,\" said the listener, well pleased, \"there are some human beings\nabout. That was a girl's voice; yes, certainly a girl's, and a lovely\nvoice too. I like the popular airs of this country-side. Now it has\nstopped.... Hark! it will soon begin again.... Yes, I hear it once\nmore. What a beautiful voice, and what a pathetic air! You might\nbelieve that it rose from the bowels of the earth, and that Se\u00c3\u00b1or\nGolfin, the most matter-of-fact and least superstitious man in this\nworld, was going to make acquaintance with sylphs, nymphs, gnomes,\ndryads, and all the rabble rout that obey the mysterious spirit of the\nplace.--But, if I am not mistaken, the voice is going farther away--the\nfair singer is departing.... Hi, girl, child, stop--wait a minute!...\"\n\nThe voice which had for a few minutes so charmed the lost wanderer with\nits enchanting strains was dying away in the dark void, and at the\nshouts of Golfin it was suddenly silent. Beyond a doubt the mysterious\ngnome, who was solacing its underground loneliness by singing its\nplaintive loves, had taken fright at this rough interruption by a human\nbeing, and fled to the deepest caverns of the earth, where precious\ngems lay hidden, jealous of their own splendor.\n\n\"This is a pleasant state of things--\" muttered Golfin, thinking that\nafter all he could do no better than light his cigar.--\"There seems no\nreason why it should not go on for a hundred years. I can smoke and\nwait. It was a clever idea of mine that I could walk up alone to the\nmines of Socartes. My luggage will have got there before me--a signal\nproof of the advantages of 'on, straight on.'\"\n\nA light breeze at this instant sprang up, and Golfin fancied he\nheard the sound of footsteps at the bottom of the unknown--or\nimaginary--abyss before him; he listened sharply, and in a minute felt\nquite certain that some one was walking below. He stood up and shouted:\n\n\"Girl, man, or whoever you are, can I get to the mines of Socartes by\nthis road?\"\n\nHe had not done speaking when he heard a dog barking wildly, and then a\nmanly voice saying: \"Choto, Choto! come here!\"\n\n\"Hi there!\" cried the traveller. \"My good friend--man, boy, demon, or\nwhatever you are, call back your dog, for I am a man of peace.\"\n\n\"Choto, Choto!...\"\n\nGolfin could make out the form of a large, black dog coming towards\nhim, but after sniffing round him it retired at its master's call;\nand at that moment the traveller could distinguish a figure, a man,\nstanding as immovable as a stone image, at about ten paces below him,\non a slanting pathway which seemed to cut across the steep incline.\nThis path, and the human form standing there, became quite clear now to\nGolfin, who, looking up to the sky, exclaimed:\n\n\"Thank God! here is the mad moon at last; now we can see where we are.\nI had not the faintest notion that a path existed so close to me, why,\nit is quite a road. Tell me, my friend, do you know whether the mines\nof Socartes are hereabout?\"\n\n\"Yes, Se\u00c3\u00b1or, these are the mines of Socartes; but we are at some\ndistance from the works.\"\n\nThe voice which spoke thus was youthful and pleasant, with the\nattractive inflection that indicates a polite readiness to be of\nservice. The doctor was well pleased at detecting this, and still\nbetter pleased at observing the soft light, which was spreading through\nthe darkness and bringing resurrection to earth and sky, as though\ncalling them forth from nothingness.\n\n\"_Fiat lux!_\" he said, going forward down the slope. \"I feel as if I\nhad just emerged into existence from primeval chaos.... Indeed, my good\nfriend, I am truly grateful to you for the information you have given\nme, and for the farther information you no doubt will give me. I left\nVillamojada as the sun was setting.--They told me to go on, straight\non....\"\n\n\"Are you going to the works?\" asked the strange youth, without stirring\nfrom the spot or looking up towards the doctor, who was now quite near\nhim.\n\n\"Yes, Se\u00c3\u00b1or; but I have certainly lost my way.\"\n\n\"Well, this is not the entrance to the mines. The entrance is by the\nsteps at Rabagones, from which the road runs and the tram-way that\nthey are making. If you had gone that way you would have reached the\nworks in ten minutes. From here it is a long way, and a very bad road.\nWe are at the outer circle of the mining galleries, and shall have to\ngo through passages and tunnels, down ladders, through cuttings, up\nslopes, and then down the inclined plane; in short, cross the mines\nfrom this side to the other, where the workshops are and the furnaces,\nthe machines and the smelting-house.\"\n\n\"Well, I seem to have been uncommonly stupid,\" said Golfin, laughing.\n\n\"I will guide you with much pleasure, for I know every inch of the\nplace.\"\n\nGolfin, whose feet sank in the loose earth, slipping here and tottering\nthere, had at last reached the solid ground of the path, and his first\nidea was to look closely at the good-natured lad who addressed him.\nFor a minute or two he was speechless with surprise.\n\n\"You!\" he said, in a low voice.\n\n\"I am blind, it is true, Se\u00c3\u00b1or,\" said the boy. \"But I can run without\nseeing from one end to the other of the mines of Socartes. This stick I\ncarry prevents my stumbling, and Choto is always with me, when I have\nnot got Nela with me, who is my guide. So, follow me, Se\u00c3\u00b1or, and allow\nme to guide you.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nGUIDED RIGHT.\n\n\n\"And were you born blind?\" asked Golfin, with eager interest, arising\nnot only from compassion.\n\n\"Yes, Se\u00c3\u00b1or, born blind,\" replied the lad, with perfect simplicity.\n\"I only know the world by fancy, feeling and hearing. I have learned\nto understand that the most wonderful portion of the universe is that\nwhich is unknown to me. I know that the eyes of other people are not\nlike mine, since they are able to distinguish things by them--but the\npower seems to me so extraordinary, that I cannot even imagine the\npossibility of its existence.\"\n\n\"Who knows ...\" Golfin began. \"But what strange scene is this, my\nfriend? What a wonderful place we are in!\"\n\nThe traveller, who had been walking by the side of his companion,\nstood still in astonishment at the weird view which lay before him.\nThey were in a deep basin resembling the crater of a volcano; the\nground at the bottom was broken and rough, and the sloping sides still\nmore so. Round the margin and in the middle of the vast caldron,\nwhich looked even larger than it was in the deceptive chiaroscuro of\nthe moonlit night, stood colossal figures, deformed caricatures of\nhumanity, monsters lying prone with their feet in the air, with arms\nspread in despair, stunted growths, distorted faces such as we see in\nthe whimsical wreathing of floating clouds--but all still, silent, and\nturned to stone. In color they were mummy-like, a reddish bistre; their\naction suggested the delirium of fever arrested by sudden death. It was\nas though giant forms had petrified in the midst of some demoniacal\norgy, and their gestures and the burlesque grimaces of the monstrous\nheads had been stricken into fixity, like the motionless attitudes of\nsculpture. The silence which prevailed in this volcanic-looking hollow\nwas itself terrifying. One might fancy that the cries and shrieks of a\nthousand voices had been petrified too, and had been held there locked\nin stone for ages.\n\n\"Where are we, my young friend?\" asked Golfin. \"This place is like a\nnightmare.\"\n\n\"This part of the mine is called La Terrible,\" replied the blind boy,\nnot appreciating his companion's frame of mind. \"It was worked till\nabout two years ago when the ore was exhausted, and now the mining\nis carried on in other parts which are more profitable. The strange\nobjects that surprise you so much are the blocks of stone which we call\n_cret\u00c3\u00a1cea_, and which consist of hardened ferruginous clay, after the\nore has been extracted. I have been told that the effect is sublime,\nparticularly in the moonlight; but I do not understand such things.\"\n\n\"A wonderful effect,--yes--\" said the stranger, who still stood gazing\nat the scene, \"but which to me is more terrible than pleasing, for it\nreminds me of the horrors of neuralgia.--Shall I tell you what it is\nlike? It is as if I were standing inside a monstrous brain suffering\nfrom a fearful headache. Those figures are like the images which\npresent themselves to the tortured brain, and become confounded with\nthe hideous fancies and visions created by a fevered mind.\"\n\n\"Choto, Choto, here!\" called the blind lad. \"Take care now, Se\u00c3\u00b1or, how\nyou walk; we are going into a gallery.\" And, in fact, Golfin saw that\nhis guide, feeling with his stick, was making his way towards a narrow\nentrance distinguished by three stout posts.\n\nThe dog went in first, snuffing at the black cavern; the blind boy\nfollowed him with the calm indifference of a man who dwells in\nperpetual darkness. Golfin followed, not without some instinctive\ntrepidation and repugnance at an underground expedition.\n\n\"It is really wonderful,\" he said, \"that you should go in and out of\nsuch a place without stumbling.\"\n\n\"I have lived all my life in these places, and know them as well as my\nown home. Here it is very cold; wrap yourself up if have you a cloak\nwith you. We shall soon be out at the other end.\" He walked on, feeling\nhis way with his hand along the wall, which was formed of upright\nbeams, and saying:\n\n\"Mind you do not stumble over the ruts in the path; they bring the\nmineral along here from the diggings above. Are you cold?\"\n\n\"Tell me,\" said the doctor, gaily. \"Are you quite certain that the\nearth has not swallowed us up? This passage is the gullet of some\nmonstrous insectivorous brute into whose stomach we miserable worms\nhave inadvertently crept.--Do you often take a walk in this delectable\nspot?\"\n\n\"Yes, often, and at all hours, and I think the place delightful. Now we\nare in the most arid part--the ground here is pure sand--now we are on\nthe stones again. Here there is a constant drip of sulphurous water,\nand down there we have a block of rock in which there are petrified\nshells. There are layers of slate over there. Do you hear that toad\ncroaking? we are near the opening now; the rascal sits there every\nnight; I know him quite well. He has a hoarse, slow voice.\"\n\n\"Who--the toad?\"\n\n\"Yes, Se\u00c3\u00b1or; we are near the end now.\"\n\n\"So I see; it looks like an eye staring at us--that is the mouth of the\ncorridor.\"\n\nNo sooner were they out in the air again, than the first thing that\nstruck the doctor's ear was the same melancholy song as he had heard\nbefore. The blind boy heard it too; he turned round to his companion\nand said, smiling with pride and pleasure:\n\n\"Do you hear her?\"\n\n\"I heard that voice before and it charmed me wonderfully. Who is the\nsinger?\"\n\nInstead of answering, the blind boy stopped and shouted with all\nthe force of his lungs: \"Nela! Nela!\" and the name was repeated by\na hundred echoes, some quite close, others faint and distant. Then,\nputting his hands to his mouth for a speaking-trumpet, he called out:\n\n\"Do not come to me, I am going that way. Wait for me at the forge--at\nthe forge!\"\n\nHe turned to the doctor again and explained:\n\n\"Nela is a girl who goes about with me; she is my guide--my\n_Lazarillo_. When it was dusk we were coming home together from the\ngreat meadow--it was rather cool, so, as my father forbids my walking\nout at night without a cloak, I waited in Romolinos' cabin, and Nela\nran home to fetch it for me. After staying some little time in the hut,\nI remembered that I had a friend coming to see me at home and I had not\npatience to wait for Nela, so I set out with Choto. I was just going\ndown La Terrible when I met you. We shall soon be at the forge now and\nthere we must part, for my father is not pleased when I go home late,\nand Nela will show you the way to the works.\"\n\n\"Many thanks, my little friend.\"\n\nThe tunnel had brought them out at a spot even more wonderful than that\nthey had left. It was an enormous gulf or chasm in the earth, looking\nlike the result of an earthquake; but it had not been rent by the\nfierce throbs of planetary fires, but slowly wrought by the laborious\npick of the miner. It looked like the interior of a huge shipwrecked\nvessel, stranded on the shore, and broken across the waist by the\nbreakers, so as to bend it at an obtuse angle. You could fancy you saw\nits ribs laid bare, and their ends standing up in an irregular file on\none side. Within the hollow hull lay huge stones, like the relics of a\ncargo tossed about by the waves, and the deceptive light of the moon\nlent so much aid to the fancy that Golfin could have believed that he\nsaw among the relics of a ship's fittings, corpses half devoured by\nfishes, mummies, skeletons--all dead, silent, half-destroyed and still,\nas if they had long been lying in the infinite sepulchre of the ocean.\nAnd the illusion was perfect when he presently heard a sound of waters,\nand a regular splash like the dash of ripples in the hollow of a rock,\nor through the skeleton timbers of a wrecked vessel.\n\n\"There is water hereabouts,\" he said to his guide.\n\n\"The noise you hear,\"--replied the other, stopping,--\"and which sounds\nlike--what shall I say--like the gurgle you make when you gargle your\nthroat?...\"\n\n\"Exactly--and where is that gurgle? Is it some rivulet that runs near\nhere?\"\n\n\"No, Se\u00c3\u00b1or; over there to the left there is a slope, and beyond it a\nwide mouth opens in the ground, a cavern, an abyss without any known\nbottom. La Trascava they call it. Some say that it runs down to the sea\nat Fic\u00c3\u00b3briga, and others think that a river flows at the bottom of it\nwhich goes round and round, like a wheel, and never comes out anywhere.\nI fancy it must be like a whirlpool. Some again say that down there is\na constant gust of air coming out of the interior of the earth--as we\nblow when we whistle--and that this blast meets a current of water;\nthen they quarrel, and struggle, and fight, and produce that noise that\nwe hear up here.\"\n\n\"And has no one ever been down into this cavern?\"\n\n\"It can only be got into in one way.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"By jumping into it. Those who have gone in have never come out again;\nand it is a great pity, for they might have told us what goes on in\nthere. The other end of the cavern is a long way off from this, for\ntwo years ago, when some miners were working they came upon a rift in\nthe rock where they heard the very same sound of water as you hear now.\nThis rift must, no doubt, communicate with the inside galleries, out\nof which the blast blows and into which the water rushes. By daylight\nyou can see it plainly, for you need only go a few steps to the left\nto reach the spot and there is a comfortable seat there. Some people\nare frightened to go there, but Nela and I sit there to listen to\nthe voice down inside the cavern--for really, Se\u00c3\u00b1or, we can fancy we\nhear it talking. Nela declares and swears that she hears words, and\ncan distinguish them quite plainly. I must confess I never heard any\nwords; but it goes on murmuring like a soliloquy or a meditation, and\nsometimes it is sad and sometimes gay--sometimes angry, and sometimes\ngood-humored and jolly.\"\n\n\"And yet I can make nothing of it but a gurgle,\" said the doctor\nlaughing.\n\n\"It sounds so from this spot.--But we must not stop now, it is getting\nlate. You must be prepared to go through another gallery.\"\n\n\"Another?\"\n\n\"Yes--and this one branches off into two in the middle. Beyond that\nthere is a labyrinth of turns and zigzags, because the miners have to\nmake galleries which, when they are worked out, are deserted and left\nto their fate. Go on Choto.\"\n\nChoto slipped into a little opening that looked scarcely bigger than\na rabbit-hole, followed by the doctor and his guide, who felt his way\nalong the dark, narrow, crooked passage with his stick. There could be\nno better evidence of the delicacy and subtlety of the sense of touch,\nextending beyond the skin of a human hand through a piece of senseless\nwood. They went forwards, at first in a curve, and then round corner\nafter corner, and all the way between walls of damp, and half-rotten\nplanking.\n\n\"Do you know what this reminds me of?\" said the doctor, perceiving that\nhis guide took pleasure in similes and comparisons. \"Of nothing so\nmuch as the thoughts of perverse man. We represent the consciousness\nof evil, when he looks into his conscience and sees himself in all his\nvileness.\"\n\nGolfin fancied that he had used a metaphor rather above his companion's\ncomprehension; but the blind boy proved that he was mistaken, for he\nsaid at once:\n\n\"For those to whom that inner world looks dark and gloomy, these\ngalleries must be dismal indeed; but I, who live in perpetual darkness,\nfind here something which has an affinity with my own nature. I can\nwalk here as you would in the broadest road. If it were not for the\nwant of air in some parts and the excessive damp in others, I should\nprefer these subterranean passages to any place I know.\"\n\n\"That is an idea of brooding fancy.\"\n\n\"I feel as if there were in my brain a narrow passage--a\nrabbit-hole--like this that we are walking in, and there my ideas run\nriot grandly.\"\n\n\"Ah! what a pity that you should never have seen the azure vault of\nthe sky at mid-day!\" the doctor exclaimed involuntarily. \"Tell me,\ndoes this dark hole--in which your ideas run riot so grandly--lead out\nanywhere?\"\n\n\"Oh yes! we shall be outside quite soon now. The vault of the sky you\nsaid--I fancy it must be a perfect, equal curve, which looks as if we\ncould touch it with our hands, but we cannot really.\"\n\nAs he spoke they got out of the tunnel; Golfin drawing a deep breath of\nrelief, like a man who has cast off a burthen, exclaimed as he looked\nup at the heavens:\n\n\"Thank God that I see you once more stars of the firmament. Never have\nyou seemed to me more beautiful than at this moment.\"\n\n\"As I was going along,\" said the blind boy, holding out his hand\nwhich held a stone, \"I picked up this piece of crystal--now do you\nmean to say that these crystals, which to my touch are so sharply cut,\nso smooth and so neatly packed side by side, are not a very beautiful\nthing? They seem so to me at any rate.\" And as he spoke he broke off\nsome of the crystals.\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" said the doctor with great feeling and compassion,\n\"it is sad indeed that you should not be able to know that this stone\nis hardly worth looking at, while over our heads there hang the myriads\nof marvellous lamps that sparkle in the heavens.\" The boy threw back\nhis head and said in a voice of deep regret:\n\n\"Is it true that you are there, you little stars?\"\n\n\"God is infinitely great and merciful,\" said Golfin, laying his hand on\nhis young companion's shoulder. \"Who knows--who can say--much stranger\nthings have happened--are happening every day.\" As he spoke, he looked\nclose into his face, trying to see the lad's eyes by the dim light;\nfixed and sightless, he turned them in the direction in which he heard\nthe speaker's voice.\n\n\"There is no hope,\" Golfin muttered.\n\nThey had come out on an open space. The moon, rising higher and\nhigher, illuminated undulating meadows and high slopes, which looked\nlike the ramparts of some immense fortification.--To the left, on a\nlevel plateau, the doctor saw a group of white houses crowning the\nslope.\n\n\"There, to the left,\" said the boy, \"is my home--up at the top. Do\nyou know that those three houses are what remain of the village of\nAldeacorba de Suso. All the rest has been pulled down at different\ntimes in order to dig mines; all the soil underneath is iron ore, and\nour fore-fathers lived over millions of wealth without knowing it.\"\n\nHe was still speaking when a girl came running to meet them, a tiny\nscrap of a child, swift of foot and slightly built.\n\n\"Nela, Nela!\" cried the blind boy. \"Have you brought me a cloak?\"\n\n\"Here it is,\" said the girl, putting it over his shoulders.\n\n\"Is this the songstress? Do you know you have a lovely voice?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed the boy, in a tone of innocent admiration, \"she sings\nbeautifully! Now, Mariquilla, you must show this gentleman the way to\nthe works, and I must go home. I can hear my father's voice already;\nhe is coming to look for me, and he will be sure to scold me.... I am\nhere, I am coming!\"\n\n\"Make haste in, my boy!\" said Golfin, shaking hands with him. \"The air\nis fresh, and you might take cold. Many thanks for your company. I hope\nwe may be good friends, for I shall be here some little time. I am the\nbrother of C\u00c3\u00a1rlos Golfin, the engineer of the mines.\"\n\n\"Oh! indeed.... Don C\u00c3\u00a1rlos is a great friend of my father's. He has\nbeen expecting you these two days.\"\n\n\"I arrived this evening at the station at Villamojada, and they told\nme that Socartes was not far, and that I could come up on foot. So, as\nI like to see the country and get exercise, and as they told me it was\n'on, straight on,' I set out, and sent my luggage in a cart. You saw\nhow I had lost my way--but there is no evil out of which good does not\ncome.... I have made your acquaintance, and we shall be friends, very\ngood friends perhaps. Go in, good-bye; get home quickly, for the autumn\nevenings are not good for you. The little Se\u00c3\u00b1ora here will be so good\nas to guide me.\"\n\n\"It is not more than a quarter of an hour's walk to the works, quite a\nshort way. But take care not to stumble over the rails, and look out\nas you cross the inclined plane. There often are trucks on the road,\nand in this damp weather the ground is like soap.--Good-bye, Caballero,\nand my very good friend.--Good-night.\" He went up the slope by a\nnarrow flight of steps cut in the soil and squared by beams of wood;\nGolfin went straight on, guided by Nela. Does what they said deserve a\nseparate chapter? In case it should, I will give it one.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nA DIALOGUE WHICH EXPLAINS MUCH.\n\n\n\"Wait a moment my child, do not go so fast,\" said Golfin, himself\nstanding still. \"I want to light a cigar.\"\n\nThe night was so still, that no precautions were needed in striking the\nlight to guard it from the wind, and when the doctor had lighted his\ncigar he held the wax match in front of Nela, saying kindly:\n\n\"Show me your face, little one.\"\n\nHe looked in the child's face with astonishment; her black eyes\nshone with a red spot, like a spark, for the instant while the\nmatch lasted. She looked a child, for she was but a tiny creature,\nextremely thin and undeveloped; but she seemed like a little woman,\nfor her eyes had not a childlike expression, and her face had the\nmature look of a nature which has gone through experience and acquired\njudgment--or will have acquired it soon. In spite of this anomaly,\nshe was well-proportioned and her small head sat gracefully on her\nlean little body. You might have said she was a woman seen through a\ndiminishing-glass; or, again, that she was a child with the eyes and\nexpression of a grown-up person. In your uncertainty, it was hard to\nsay whether she was astonishingly forward or lamentably backward.\n\n\"How old are you?\" asked Golfin, shaking his fingers free of the match\nwhich was beginning to burn them.\n\n\"They say I am sixteen,\" said Nela, gazing in her turn at the doctor.\n\n\"Sixteen!\" exclaimed Golfin. \"Much less than that, child! You are\ntwelve at most to judge by appearances.\"\n\n\"Holy Virgin! They say I am quite a phenomenon,\" said the girl in a\ntone of weariness of the subject.\n\n\"A phenomenon!\" repeated Golfin laying his hand on her hair. \"Well,\nperhaps so. Now, come along--show me the way.\"\n\nNela set out resolutely, keeping but a little way in front of the\ntraveller but rather on one side of him, to show her just appreciation\nof such illustrious company. Her nimble little feet, which were bare,\nwere evidently familiar with the ground they trod, with the stones, the\npuddles and the thistles. She wore a plain frock of scanty breadth,\nand the rudimentary simplicity of her garb, as well as the loose flow\nof her thick, short hair, which fell in natural waves, had a stamp of\nsavage independence rather than of abject poverty. Her speech, on the\nother hand, struck Golfin by its modest propriety, indicating a formed\nand thoughtful mind. Her voice had a gentle inflection of kindliness,\nwhich could not be the result of education, and her glance was restless\nand shy, whenever she was not looking at the sky or the earth.\n\n\"Tell me,\" said Golfin. \"Do you live in the mines? Are you the child of\nany of the workmen employed here?\"\n\n\"They say I have neither father nor mother.\"\n\n\"Poor little girl! and you work in the mines?\"\n\n\"No, Se\u00c3\u00b1or. I am of no use at all,\" she replied without raising her\neyes.\n\n\"Well, you are modest, at any rate.\"\n\nThe doctor bent down to look closely at her face; it was small\nand freckled all over with little mole-like spots. Her forehead\nwas narrow, her nose sharp but not ill-shaped, her eyes black and\nbrilliant, but their light shone but sadly. Her hair, naturally of\na golden brown, was dull for want of care, and from exposure to the\nsun, wind and dust. Her lips were so thin as to be hardly visible, and\nalways wore a smile, but it was like the faint smile of the dead who\nhave died dreaming of Heaven. Nela's mouth was, strictly speaking,\nugly, still it deserved a word of praise from the point of view\nexpressed in the line from Polo de Medina: \"A mouth is sweet that asks\nfor nothing.\"[1] In fact, neither in word, look, or smile, did the poor\nchild betray any of the degrading habits of the beggar. Golfin stroked\nthe sad little face, holding it under the chin and almost encircling it\nwith his big fingers.\n\n\"Poor little body!\" he said. \"Providence has not been over-generous to\nyou. Who do you live with?\"\n\n\"With Se\u00c3\u00b1or Centeno, the overseer of the beasts belonging to the mines?\"\n\n\"You do not seem to have been born in luxury.--Who were your parents?\"\n\n\"They say my mother sold peppers in the market at Villamojada. She was\nnot married. She had me one All-Saints' day, and then she went to be\nwet-nurse at Madrid.\"\n\n\"A highly estimable woman!\" muttered Golfin ironically.\n\n\"And no one knows who your father was?\"\n\n\"Yes, Se\u00c3\u00b1or,\" said Nela with some pride. \"My father was the first who\never lighted the lamps of Villamojada.\"\n\n\"Wonderful!\"\n\n\"I ought to tell you,\" said the little girl with the gravity\nbefitting the dignity of history, \"that when the town council first\nhad lamps hung up in the streets, my father was entrusted with the\ncare of lighting and cleaning them. I was nursed by a sister of my\nmother's--not that she was married either, as they tell me. My father\nhad quarrelled with her--they all lived together as I have heard--and\nwhen he went out to light the lamps he used to put me in his basket,\nwith his lamp-chimneys and cottons and oil. One day when he went up to\nlight the lamp on the bridge, he put the basket on the parapet, and I\nrolled out and fell into the river.\"\n\n\"And you were not drowned!\"\n\n\"No, Se\u00c3\u00b1or; for I fell on the stones. Holy Mother of God! I was a dear\nlittle thing before that, they tell me.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am sure you were,\" said the stranger with an impulse of\nloving-kindness. \"And so you are still.--But tell me what next. Have\nyou lived long in the mines?\"\n\n\"Thirteen years, they say. My mother took me back after my tumble.\nMy father fell ill, and as my mother would not do anything for him,\nbecause he was wicked to her, he was taken to the hospital where they\nsay he died. Meanwhile my mother came to work in the mines. They say\nthe overseer discharged her one day because she drank so much.\"\n\n\"And your mother went.... Go on, I take a real interest in the good\nwoman; she went....\"\n\n\"She went to a very big hole over there,\" said the child, standing\nstill and speaking with intense pathos, \"and she threw herself in.\"\n\n\"The devil she did! That was coming to a bad end. I suppose she did not\ncome out again?\"\n\n\"No, Se\u00c3\u00b1or,\" said Nela with perfect simplicity. \"She is there still.\"\n\n\"And since that catastrophe, poor child,\" said Golfin kindly, \"you\nhave stayed at work here. Mining work is very hard labor and you have\ntaken the hue of the soil; you are thin and ill-nourished. This life is\nenough to ruin the strongest constitution.\"\n\n\"No, Se\u00c3\u00b1or; I do not labor. They say I am not good for anything and\nnever shall be.\"\n\n\"God forbid, silly child! why you are a treasure.\"\n\n\"No indeed,\" insisted the girl, \"I cannot work at all. If I take up\never so small a load, I fall down, and if I am set to any hard work I\nfaint away before long.\"\n\n\"You are as God made you--and if you fell into the hands of any one who\nknew how to treat you, you would work very well.\"\n\n\"No, Se\u00c3\u00b1or, no indeed,\" she repeated as energetically as though it were\nin her own praise that she spoke, \"I am no good to any one--only in the\nway.\"\n\n\"Then you are a mere vagabond?\"\n\n\"No, Se\u00c3\u00b1or, for I attend on Pablo.\"\n\n\"And who is Pablo?\"\n\n\"That young blind gentleman, whom you met in La Terrible. I have been\nhis guide for the last year and a half. I take him everywhere; we go\nfor long walks in the fields.\"\n\n\"He seems a good fellow, this Pablo.\"\n\nNela again stood still and looked up at the doctor, and her face glowed\nwith enthusiasm as she exclaimed:\n\n\"Holy Virgin! He is the best and dearest creature in the whole world!\nPoor fellow!--and he is cleverer without eyes than all those who can\nsee.\"\n\n\"Yes, I liked your master. Does he belong to the place?\"\n\n\"Yes, Se\u00c3\u00b1or; he is the only son of Don Francisco Pen\u00c3\u00a1guilas, a very\nkind and very rich gentleman who lives in the houses at Aldeacorba.\"\n\n\"Tell me, why are you called Nela? What does it mean?\"\n\nThe child shrugged her shoulders, and after a pause, she said:\n\n\"My mother's name was Mar\u00c3\u00ada Canela, and so she was called Nela; they\nsay it is a dog's name. My name is Mar\u00c3\u00ada.\"\n\n\"Mariquita.\"\n\n\"Mar\u00c3\u00ada Nela they call me, or sometimes Canela's girl, and some say\nMarianela, and some merely Nela.\"\n\n\"And your master, is he fond of you?\"\n\n\"Yes, Se\u00c3\u00b1or; he is very good to me. He says he sees with my eyes, for I\ntake him everywhere, and tell him what everything is like.\"\n\n\"Everything that he cannot see?\" The stranger seemed much interested in\nthis conversation.\n\n\"Yes--I tell him everything. He asks me what a star is like, and I\ntell him all about it in such a way that it is the same to him as\nif he could see it. I explain it all--what the planets are like,\nand the clouds, and the sky, and the water, and the lightning, the\nweather-cocks, the butterflies, the mists, the snails, and the shapes\nand faces of men and animals. I tell him what is ugly and what is\npretty, and so he gets to understand everything.\"\n\n\"I see; your work is no trifle. What is ugly and what is pretty! There\nis nothing.... You decide upon that question? Tell me, can you read?\"\n\n\"No, Se\u00c3\u00b1or.--I tell you I am good for nothing.\"\n\nShe said this in a tone of perfect conviction, and the gesture that\nemphasized her protestation seemed to add: \"You must be a great\nblockhead to fancy that I am good for anything.\"\n\n\"Would you not be glad if your friend, by the grace of God, should\nrecover his sight?\"\n\nThe girl did not answer at once, but after a pause she said:\n\n\"It is impossible.\"\n\n\"No, not impossible, only difficult and doubtful.\"\n\n\"The engineer who manages the mines did give my master's father some\nhope of it.\"\n\n\"Don C\u00c3\u00a1rlos Golfin?\"\n\n\"Yes, Se\u00c3\u00b1or. Don C\u00c3\u00a1rlos has a brother who is an eye-doctor, and they\nsay he gives sight to the blind, and makes those who squint look\nstraight.\"\n\n\"What a clever man!\"\n\n\"Yes; and when the eye-doctor wrote to Don C\u00c3\u00a1rlos that he was coming to\nsee him, his brother wrote to him to bring his instruments with him to\ntry if he could make Pablo see.\"\n\n\"And has this good man been here yet?\"\n\n\"No, sir; for he is always travelling about in England and America, and\nit seems it will be some time yet before he comes. Pablo laughs at it\nall, and says no man can give him what the Holy Virgin has denied him\nfrom his birth.\"\n\n\"Well--perhaps he is right. But are we not nearly there? For I see some\nchimneys which pour forth smoke darker than the bottomless pit, and a\nlight too, which looks like a forge.\"\n\n\"Yes--here we are. Those are the roasting furnaces, which burn day and\nnight. There, in front, are the machines for washing the ore; they only\nwork by day. To the right-hand is the chemical workshop, and down\nthere, last of all, the counting-house and offices.\"\n\nThe place seemed to lie in fact as Marianela indicated. In the absence\nof any wind a mist hung over the spot, shrouding the buildings in\nheavy, gaseous fog, and giving them a confused and fantastic outline\nagainst the moonlit sky.\n\n\"This is a pleasanter place to see for once than to live in,\" said\nGolfin, hastening onwards. \"The cloud of vapor wraps round everything,\nand the lights have dim circles round them, like the moon on a sultry\nnight. Which is the office?\"\n\n\"Here, we are almost there.\"\n\nAfter passing in front of the furnaces, where the heat made them hurry\non, the doctor perceived a house which was no less dingy and smoky than\nthe others, and at the same instant he heard a piano being played with\na vigor bordering on frenzy.\n\n\"We have music here. I recognize my sister-in-law's touch and\nexecution.\"\n\n\"It is Se\u00c3\u00b1orita Sof\u00c3\u00ada who is playing,\" said Mar\u00c3\u00ada.\n\nThe lights of a busy household shone in the windows, and the balcony on\nthe ground-floor was wide open. A small spark was visible, the spark of\na cigar. Before the doctor could reach the spot, the spark flew off,\ndescribing a parabola of fire, and breaking into a thousand twinkling\nspecks--the smoker had shaken the end off.\n\n\"There is that everlasting smoker!\" cried the doctor, in a tone of\naffectionate delight. \"C\u00c3\u00a1rlos, C\u00c3\u00a1rlos!\"\n\n\"Teodoro!\" exclaimed a voice from the balcony. The piano ceased like a\nsinging-bird scared by a noise. Steps sounded through the house. The\ndoctor gave his guide a silver coin, and ran up to the door.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nSTONY HEARTS.\n\n\nRetracing her steps and jumping over the obstacles in her path, Nela\nmade her way to a house on the left of the machine-sheds, and close to\nthe stables where the sixty mules belonging to the establishment stood\nin grave meditation. The residence of the overseer, though of modern\nconstruction, was neither elegant nor even commodious. The roof was\nlow, and it was too small by far to give adequate shelter to the parent\ncouple of the Centenos--to their four children--to their cat--and to\nNela into the bargain; but it figured, nevertheless, on the parchment\nplans of the settlement under the ostentatious name of \"overseer's\nresidence.\"\n\nInside, the house seemed to afford a practical illustration of the\nsaying which we have already heard so emphatically stated by Marianela;\nnamely, that she, Marianela, was of no good to anyone, only in the way.\nSomehow, in there, room was found for everything--for the father and\nmother, for their sons and their sons' tools, for a heap of rubbish,\nof the use of which no irrefragable proof has been found, for the cat,\nfor the dish off which the cat was fed, for Tanasio's guitar, for the\nmaterials of which Tanasio made his _garrotes_--a kind of lidless\nhamper--for half a dozen old mule-halters, for the blackbird's cage,\nfor two useless old boilers, for an altar--at which Dame Centeno\nworshipped the Divinity with offerings of artificial flowers and some\npatriarchal tapers, a perennial settlement for flies--in short, for\neverything and everybody excepting little Mar\u00c3\u00ada Canela. Constantly some\none was heard to say: \"You cannot take a step without falling over that\nconfounded child, Nela!\" or else:\n\n\"Get into your corner, do.--What a plague the creature is; she does\nnothing, and lets no one else do anything.\"\n\nThe house consisted of three rooms and a loft. The first of these\nserved not only as dining-room and drawing-room, but also as the\nbedroom of the two elders; in the second slept the two young ladies,\nalready grown-up women, and named _La Mariuca_ and _La Pepina_.\nTanasio, the eldest of all, stored himself in the garret, and Celipin,\nthe youngest of the family and nearly twelve years old, had a bed\nin the kitchen--the innermost room, the dingiest, dampest and least\nhabitable of the three rooms which composed the mansion of the Centenos.\n\nNela, during the many years of her residence there, had inhabited\nvarious nooks and corners, going from one to another, according to\nthe exigencies of the moment, to make way for the thousand objects\nwhich served only to curtail the last scanty accommodation left for\nhuman beings. On some occasion--the precise facts are unknown to\nhistory--Tanasio, whose feet were as crippled as his brain, and who\ndevoted himself to the manufacture of large hampers made of hazel\nrods, had placed in the kitchen a pile of at least half a dozen of\nthese bulky trophies of his art. Marianela looked on, casting her eyes\nsadly around, and finding no corner left into which to creep; but the\npredicament itself inspired her with a happy idea, which she at once\nacted upon. She simply got into one of the baskets, and there passed\nthe night in sound and blissful sleep. In fact, it was comfortable\nenough, and when it was cold she pulled another basket on the top. From\nthat time, so long as there were _garrotes_ (a local name for these\ncoarse, open baskets) to be found, she never was at a loss for a crib,\nand the others would say of the child: \"She sleeps like a jewel.\"\n\nDuring meals, in the midst of a noisy discussion on the morning's work,\na voice would suddenly say in rough tones: \"Here!\" and Nela would have\na plate given her by one of the family, big or small, and would seat\nherself against the big chest to eat what she had got, in silence.\nBut towards the end of the meal sometimes the master's harsh bleating\nvoice would be lifted up saying, with a perfunctory air of benevolence:\n\"Mother, you have given poor Nela nothing.\" And then _Se\u00c3\u00b1ana_, a\ncompound name abbreviated from Se\u00c3\u00b1ora Ana, would move her head about as\nif trying to see some minute and remote object between the bodies of\nher own children, saying as she did so: \"What, are you there? I thought\nyou had stayed at Aldeacorba.\"\n\nAt night, after supper, the family repeated the Paternoster over\ntheir beads and then, staggering like bacchantes, and rubbing their\neyes with their fists, Mariuca and Pepina went to their beds, which\nwere snug and comfortable and covered with patchwork quilts. In a few\nminutes a duet of contralto snoring was heard which lasted without\nintermission till morning dawned. Tanasio went up to the higher regions\nand Celipin curled himself round on a heap of rags, not far from the\nbasket into which Nela disappeared from sight.\n\nThe family thus being disposed of, the parents sat up for a while in\nthe living-room, and while Centeno, seating himself with a stretch\nclose to the little table and taking up a newspaper, made a series of\ngrimaces to convey his bold intention of reading it, his wife took a\nstocking full of money out of the family chest, and after counting it\nand adding or taking out a few pieces, carefully restored it to its\nplace. Then she took out sundry paper packets containing gold pieces\nand transferred some from one parcel to another. Meanwhile such remarks\nas these were made. \"Mariuca's petticoat cost thirty-two _reales_.\nI gave Tanasio the six _reales_ he had to pay. We only want eleven\n_duros_[2] to make up the five hundred.\"\n\nOr, on the other hand:\n\n\"The deputies agreed.\"--\"Yesterday a conference was held, etc....\"\n\nSe\u00c3\u00b1ana's fingers did her sums, while her husband's forefinger passed\ndoubtfully and waveringly along the lines, to guide his eye and mind\nthrough the labyrinth of letters. And these sentences gradually died\naway into monosyllables; one yawned, then the other, and at last all\nsunk into silence, after extinguishing the lamp by which the overseer\nof the mules had been cultivating his mind.\n\nOne night, when all was quiet, a creaking of baskets became audible\nin the kitchen. It was not perfectly dark there, for the shutters of\nthe little window were never shut, and Celipin Centeno, who was not\nyet asleep, saw the topmost baskets, which were packed one inside the\nother, rising slowly like a gaping oyster-shell, and out of the opening\npeeped the nose and black eyes of Nela.\n\n\"Celipin,\" she said, \"Celipinillo, are you asleep?\" and she put a hand\nout.\n\n\"No, I am awake; Nela, you look like a mussel in its shell. What do you\nwant?\"\n\n\"Here, take this, it is a _peseta_[3] that a gentleman gave me this\nevening--the brother of Don C\u00c3\u00a1rlos. How much have you got now? This is\nsomething like a present; now I have given you something better than\ncoppers!\"\n\n\"Give it here and thank you very much, Nela,\" said the boy, sitting up\nto reach the money. \"You have given me nearly thirty-two _reales_ now,\na copper at a time.[4] I have it all safe here, inside my shirt, in the\nlittle bag you gave me. You are a real good girl.\"\n\n\"I do not want money for anything; but take good care of it, for\nif Se\u00c3\u00b1ana were to find it, she would think you would get into some\nmischief with it and thrash you with the big stick.\"\n\n\"No, no, it is not to get into mischief,\" said the boy vehemently, and\nclenching the money to his breast with one hand, while he supported\nhimself on the other. \"It is to make myself a rich man, Nela, a clever\nman like some I know. On Sunday, if they will let me go to Villamojada,\nI must buy a spelling-book to learn to read, although they will not\nteach me here. Who cares! I will learn by myself. Do you know, Nela,\nthey say that Don C\u00c3\u00a1rlos is the son of a man who swept the streets in\nMadrid, and he, all by himself, learnt everything he knows.\"\n\n\"And so you think you can do the same, noodle.\"\n\n\"I believe you! If father will not take me away from these confounded\nmines, I will find some other way; ah! you shall see what sort of a\nman I am. I was never meant for that Nela. You just wait till I have\ncollected a good sum, and then you will see--you will see how I will\nfind a place in the town there, or take the train to Madrid, or a\nsteamboat to carry me over to the islands out there, or get a place as\na servant to some one who will let me study.\"\n\n\"Dear Mother of Heaven!\" exclaimed Nela, opening her oyster-shell still\nwider and putting out her whole head. \"How quiet you have kept all\nthese sly plans.\"\n\n\"Do you take me for a fool? I tell you what Nela, I am in a mad rage.\nI cannot live like this; I shall die in the mines. Drat it all! Why,\nI spend my nights in crying, and my hands are all knocked to pieces\nand--but do not be frightened, Nela, at what I am going to say, and do\nnot think me wicked--I would not say it to any other living soul....\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I do not love father and mother--not as I ought.\"\n\n\"Oh! if you say such things I will never give you another _real_.\nCelipin, for God's sake, think of what you are saying.\"\n\n\"I cannot help it. Why, just look how we go on here. We are not\nhuman beings, we are brutes. Sometimes I almost think we are less\nthan the mules, and I ask myself if I am in any way better than a\ndonkey--fetching a basket of the ore and pitching it into a truck;\nshoving the truck up to the furnaces; stirring the mineral with a stick\nto wash it!--Oh dear, oh dear!\" ... and the hapless boy began to sob\nbitterly. \"Drat--drat it all! but if you spend years upon years in work\nlike this, you are bound to go to the bad at last, your very brains\nturn to iron-stone.--No, I was never meant for this. I tell my father\nto let me go away and learn something, and he answers that we are poor,\nand that I am too full of fancies.--We are nothing, nothing but brutes\ngrinding out a living day by day.--Why do you say nothing?\"\n\nBut Nela did not answer--perhaps she was comparing the boy's hard lot\nwith her own, and finding her own much the worse of the two.\n\n\"What do you want me to say?\" she replied at last. \"I can never be any\ngood to any one--I am nobody. I can say nothing to you.... But do not\nthink such wicked things--about your father I mean.\"\n\n\"You only say so to comfort me; but you know quite well it is true, and\nI do believe you are crying.\"\n\n\"I ... no.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are, I am sure.\"\n\n\"Every one has something to cry for,\" said Mar\u00c3\u00ada in a broken voice.\n\"But it is very late, Celipin; we must go to sleep.\"\n\n\"No indeed, not if I know it!\"\n\n\"Yes, child; go to sleep and do not think of such miserable things.\nGood-night.\"\n\nThe shell closed and all was silent.\n\nWe hear a great deal said about the hard and narrow materialism of\ncities, a dry rot which, amid all the splendor and pleasures of\ncivilization, eats into the moral cohesion of society; but there is\na worse and deeper disease; the parochial materialism of country\nvillages--which ossifies millions of living beings, crushes every\nnoble ambition in their souls and shuts them into the petty round of a\nmechanical existence, reducing them to the meanest animal instincts.\nThere are many more blatant evils in the social order as, for instance,\nspeculation, usury, the worship of mammon among men of high culture;\nbut above all these, broods a monster which secretly and silently\nruins more than all else, and that is the greed of the peasant. The\ncovetous peasant acknowledges no moral law, has no religion, no clear\nnotions of right and wrong; they are all inextricably mixed up in his\nmind with a strange compound of superstition and calculating avarice.\nBehind an air of hypocritical simplicity, there lies a sinister\narithmetic which, for keenness and intelligibility, far transcends the\nmethods of the best mathematicians. A peasant who has taken a fancy to\nhoard copper coin, and dreams of changing it presently into silver and\nthen the silver into gold, is the most ignoble creature in creation; he\nis capable of every form and device of malice known to man, combined\nwith an absence of feeling that is appalling. His soul shrinks and\nshrivels till it is nothing more than a minim measure. Ignorance,\ncoarseness, and squalor complete the abominable compound and deprive it\nof all the means of veiling the desolation within. He can only count on\nhis fingers, but he is capable of reducing to figures all moral sense,\nconscience and the soul itself.\n\nSe\u00c3\u00b1ana and Centeno, who, after many struggles, had contrived to earn\ntheir \"morsel of bread\" in the mines of Socartes, were able to make,\nwith the added toil of their four children, a daily wage which they\nwould have regarded as a princely fortune in the days when they\nwandered from fair to fair selling pots and pipkins. It should be\nmentioned with regard to the intellectual powers of Centeno, that\nhis head, in the opinion of many persons, rivalled the steam-hammer\nin the workshops for sheer hardness; with no disparagement to that\nof dame Ana, his wife, who seemed to be a woman of much prudence and\ndiscrimination, and who governed her household as carefully as the\nwisest prince could govern his dominions. She bagged the wages, earned\nby her husband and children, with the best grace in the world, and they\namounted to a neat little sum; and each time the money was brought\nhome, she felt as if the very sacrament itself were being carried in,\nso intense was her delight at the mere sight of coin.\n\nSe\u00c3\u00b1ana afforded her children very little comfort in return for the\nfortune she was accumulating by the labor of their hands; however, as\nthey never complained of the utter and debasing misery in which they\nlived, as they betrayed no wish for emancipation, nor for a breath of\nany nobler life worthier of intelligent beings, Se\u00c3\u00b1ana let the days\nslip on. Many indeed had slipped away before her children slept in\nbeds, and many, many more before their brawny limbs were covered with\ndecent garments. She gave them regular and wholesome meals, following\nin this respect the rules most in vogue; but eating in her house was a\nmelancholy ceremony nevertheless, a mere doling out of fodder, as it\nwere, to human animals.\n\nSo far as mental nourishment was concerned, Se\u00c3\u00b1ana firmly believed\nthat her husband's erudition, acquired by much miscellaneous reading,\nwas amply sufficient to credit the whole family with learning, and for\nthat reason she forbore to cram the minds of her progeny even with the\namount of instruction which is given in schools. The elder ones helped\nher, and the youngest lived free of pedagogues, buried alive for twelve\nhours out of every twenty-four in brutalizing toil in the mines, so\nthat the whole family swam at large and at leisure in the vast and\nstagnant ocean of dulness.\n\nThe two girls, Mariuca and Pepina, were not destitute of charms, though\nyouth and robust growth were the chief. One of them read fluently, but\nnot the other, and, so far as knowledge of the world was concerned, it\nis easy to suppose that some rudimentary information, at least, was\nnot lacking to girls who lived with a perfect chorus of nymphs of all\nages and every grade of respectability--or the contrary--perpetually\nemployed in mechanical work which left their tongues free to wag.\nMariuca and Pepina were buxom and well grown, and as erect and strong\nas Amazons. They wore short petticoats, displaying half the calf of the\nleg which, as well as their broad feet, was bare, and their rough heads\nmight have supported an architrave as stoutly as those of Caryatides.\nThe russet dust of the iron ore which colored them from head to foot,\nlike all in the mines, gave them the appearance of massive figures in\nterra-cotta.\n\nTanasio was a lethargic being; his want of character and ambition\nverged on idiocy. Confined to the house from his earliest years,\nincapable of taking any exercise, of feeling either annoyance or\npleasure, or of fulfilling any task, the boy, who was born to be a\nmachine, had sunk into something not superior to the roughest tool.\nThe day which found such a creature able to originate an idea, would\ninfallibly see the total subversion of the order of nature; for,\nhitherto, no stone has been known to think.\n\nThe relation of this family to their mother was that of abject\nsubmission on their part, and unlimited despotism on hers. The only\nchild who ever dared to show symptoms of rebellion was the little\none. Se\u00c3\u00b1ana, with her narrow capacities, could not at all understand\nthis diabolical ambition to be something better than a stone. Was\nthere--did he suppose--any happier or more exemplary life than that of\na stone? She would not admit that it might be changed, even for that\nof a rolling stone. Se\u00c3\u00b1ana loved her children--but there are so many\nways of loving. She placed them above every other consideration--so\nlong as they submitted to work perpetually in the mines, to pour all\ntheir earnings into one bowl, to obey her blindly, to cherish no wild\naspirations nor wish to appear in fine clothes, not to marry too\nyoung, nor to learn any mischievous trash and cram their heads with\nschool-work, since \"poor folks\"--she would say--\"must always remain\npoor and behave as such, and not be wanting to jabber in the style of\nthe rich city folks, who were eaten up with vices and rotten with sin.\"\n\nI have described the manners and customs which prevailed in the\nCenteno's house in order that the reader may understand the life to\nwhich Nela was doomed, a helpless, forsaken creature, alone, useless,\nincapable of earning a day's wages; alike without a past and without a\nfuture, with no right to anything on earth beyond a bare subsistence.\nSe\u00c3\u00b1ana gave her this, and firmly believed that her generosity was\nnothing short of heroic. Many a time would she say, as she filled\nNela's little platter: \"What a reward I am laying up for myself\nhereafter in Heaven!\" And she believed it as if it were Gospel. No true\nlight could penetrate her thick skull as to the saintly exercise of\ncharity; she could never have understood that a kind word, a caress, a\nloving and gentle action, which may make a wretch forget his misery,\nare infinitely more precious--aye, and more heroic--than the broken\nmeat left from a bad meal. It was but a chance that she did not give\nthem to the cat, who, at least, was far more kindly spoken to. Nela\nnever heard herself addressed as _michita_, little pet, precious\ndarling--nor by any other of the sweet and endearing names that were\nlavished on the cat.\n\nNothing ever suggested to Nela that she was born of human beings,\nlike the other inhabitants of the house. She was never punished; but\nshe felt that this immunity arose from their contemptuous pity for\nher feeble frame, and certainly not from any special esteem or care\nfor her person. No one had ever taught her that she had a soul ready\nto bring forth good fruit if she cultivated it with care, nor that\nshe bore within herself, like other mortals, that spark of the divine\nfire which is called human intelligence, and that this spark might be\nfanned to beneficent light and flame. No one had ever told her that\nher grotesque smallness included in itself the germ of every noble and\ndelicate sentiment, and that those tiny buds might open out to lovely\nflowers, with no more cultivation than a herb that we glance at now and\nagain. No one had told her that she had a right, by the very sternness\nof Nature in creating her, to certain tender cares which the strong can\ndispense with--the healthy and those who have parents and a home; since\nunder the laws of Christian jurisprudence the helpless, the poor, the\norphan, and the destitute, are all alike worthy of protection.\n\nOn the other hand, everything combined to impress upon her, her\nabsolute resemblance to a rolling stone, which has not even a shape of\nits own, but takes that which the waters give it or the kick of the man\nthat spurns it. Everything told her that her place in the house was\nsomething below the cat, whose sleek back received the only caresses\never bestowed on anyone, and the blackbird that hopped about its cage.\nAnd of them, at any rate, no one said in heartless compassion: \"Poor\ncreature! it is a pity she did not die!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nLABOR AND A LANDSCAPE WITH FIGURES.\n\n\nThe smoke of the furnaces, which all night through were wide awake and\npanting out their hot, hoarse breath, caught a silvery gleam as its\nwreaths rolled into the distance; the faint smile of dawn fell upon the\nremotest peaks of the mountains, and, by degrees, the hills that guard\nSocartes came out of the darkness, the huge slopes of rust-colored\nearth and the blackened buildings. The bell of the works rang out\nshrilly its call \"to work, to work,\" and hundreds of sleepy souls came\nout of the houses, huts, hovels, holes even. Doors creaked on their\nhinges; the mules came reluctantly out of the stables, making their way\nto their watering-place, and the whole establishment, which had just\nnow looked like a city of the dead lighted up by the infernal glare of\nthe furnaces, came to life and began to stir its thousand arms.\n\nThe steam soon was seething in the boilers of the great steam-engine,\nwhich supplied the motive power both for the workshops and the\nwashing-mills. The water, which performed the principal part in the\noperations, began to flow through the raised conduits from which it\nfell on the cylinders. Files of men and women just risen from their\nbeds, made their way down to the scene of labor, and at length the\ncylindrical sieves began to revolve with hideous groaning; the water\nrushed from one to the other, pulverizing the dark earth which tumbled\non in muddy eddies and cataracts, from trough to trough, till it\nsettled at last in a fine chocolate-brown powder. The sound was as of\na thousand hungry jaws chewing grit and sand; the play of light on\nwater and soil made it as dazzling as a kaleidoscope, and the clatter\nwas like some enormous hollow drum, filled with pebbles and potsherds.\nIt was impossible to look on without turning giddy at the incessant\nwhirl of a vast skein, as it were, of threads of water, some clear and\ntransparent, others stained red by the ferruginous clay; nor could any\nhuman brain that was not accustomed to the spectacle, picture to itself\nthis mad struggle of toothed wheels which never ceased biting at each\nother, of cogs, that met, and caught, and rolled away again, of screws\nwhich, as they turned, shrieked in pitiless clamor for oil.\n\nThe washing was all done in the open air. The connecting belts came\nhumming down from the machinery sheds; other belts began to revolve,\nand at the same time a rhythmical stamping was heard, a slow and awful\ntramp like a giant's step, or a fearful throbbing inside mother earth.\nThis was the great hammer which had begun to beat; its stupendous blows\nmoulded the iron like a paste, and those huge wheels, and beams, which\nlook as if made to last forever, began to twist and writhe like the\nlimbs of men in torment, while the hammer, with its monotonous impact,\ncreated new forms as strong as the rocks which are the work of ages.\nFor the results of labor have a strange resemblance to the results of\npatience.\n\nMen so black, that they look like hewn and animated coal, gathered\nround the fiery objects that were taken from the forges, and seizing\nthem with those prolonged hands known as tongs, set to work to hammer\nthem. It is a strange kind of sculpture, this, which has fire for\nits inspiring genius and a steam-hammer for its chisel. Wheels and\naxle-trees for thousands of trucks, and the damaged portions of the\nwashing-machinery, were repaired here, and picks, spades and barrows\nwere made. At the back of the workshops saws hissed through blocks of\ntimber, and the iron, which had been formed for labor by fire of wood,\nnow cut through the sturdy fibre of trees hewn by the axe from their\nnative spot.\n\nMeanwhile, the mules had been harnessed to long trains of trucks which\ncarried off the waste earth to add it to the slopes already made, or\nfetched the mineral to be washed. They looked like immense reptiles,\ncrawling up and down to meet each other, and always passing close\nbut without any jar or collision. They crept into the mouths of the\ntunnels, and their resemblance was really perfect to the wriggling\ncreatures that shelter in such damp clefts and caves; and when the\nrecalcitrant mules kicked and shied in the bowels of the earth, it was\neasy to fancy the Saurians were fighting and screaming at each other.\nIn the deepest recesses of all, hundreds of men were tearing up the\nearth with picks, inch by inch, to win the hidden treasure; these were\nthe sculptors of the strange and enormous figures which stood in awful\ngravity and silence to confront the man who should venture to invade\ntheir mysterious domain. The miners hewed down here, bored holes there,\ndug farther on in one place, scraped down the wall in another, broke\nup the limestone, chipped out the pretty flakes of mica and shale,\npounded down the calcareous clay, picked out the hematite and pyrites,\ncrushed the fine, white marble--rolling and stirring it incessantly\ntill it should yield zinc silicate--for zinc may be called the silver\nof Europe, which, being a metal of which you cannot make saucepans,\nis destined to become the fount of wealth and civilization. Is it not\non zinc that Belgium has hoisted her standard of moral and political\ngreatness? Aye, tin even has its epic!\n\nThe sky was clear and bright; the sun rose unclouded on the scene,\nand the wide settlement of Socartes flashed from dark neutrality into\nredness. The sculptured rocks, the heaps of ore, the hillocks of waste\nsoil that rose on every side like Babylonian mounds, were red; the\nground, the trucks and carts, the machinery, the water and the laborers\nthat gave life to Socartes. The brick-colored tone was universal, with\nfaint shades of difference in the earth and the houses, the metal and\nthe people's garments. The women at work at the washing looked like a\ncrowd of nymphs, come down in the world, and cast in red ironstone.\nA rivulet of crimson fluid ran through the bottom conduit to join a\ncrimson river--you might fancy it the sweat of these toiling men and\nmachines, of muscles and of iron.\n\nNela stepped out of the house. Even she, though she did not work in\nthe mines, was faintly tinged with the universal ruddle, for the\nfinely-powdered metal spared no one. In her hand she held a hunch of\nbread which Se\u00c3\u00b1ana had given her for breakfast, and as she ate it she\nwalked on quickly, lost in thought and not lingering to amuse herself.\nShe had soon passed the workshops and, going up the inclined plane and\nthe steps before mentioned, she reached the houses of Aldeacorba. The\nfirst of these was a handsome and stately mansion, large, well-built,\nand cheerful looking, but lately restored and painted; with stone\nboundary walls, decorated eaves and a broad escutcheon surrounded\nby granite foliage. And the escutcheon itself would be less missed\nthan the climbing vine, whose long and leafy branches looked like\nwhiskers--growing, as whiskers do, on each side of a face, of which\nthe two windows served as eyes, while the escutcheon was the nose and\nthe long balcony the mouth, always widely grinning. And to complete\nthis whimsical air of personality, a beam stuck out from the balcony\nintended to attach a rope to support an awning, and with this addition\nthe face was seen as smoking a cigar. The roof was in the shape of a\ncap and in it there was a window that might represent the tassel. The\nchimneys could only be the ears. It was one of those faces in which a\nphysiognomist reads plainly, peace of mind, ease of circumstance and a\nquiet conscience.\n\nIn front of it was a little court-yard enclosed by a wall of adobe,\nand on one side was a pretty orchard. As Nela went in she met the cows\ncoming out to pasture, and after exchanging a few words with their\ndriver--a formidable youth, about four feet high and ten years old--she\nwent straight up to a stout gentleman, whiskered, grey-haired and\nflorid, with a kind face and pleasant smile, and a half-military and\nhalf-rustic air; he was in his shirt sleeves and braces, and his hairy\narms were bared to the elbow. Before the little girl addressed him, he\nlooked up at the house and called out: \"Here is Nela, my boy!\"\n\nA lad at once made his appearance, remarkably tall, grave and erect,\nhis head held somewhat stiffly and his eyes fixed and vacant like\nlenses. His face was like marble, carved with exquisite sharpness, and\nhis skin was as fine and soft as a girl's; there was not a feature or a\nline which was not of that supremely beautiful type of manliness which\nwas the outcome of a thousand years of Hellenic thought. Those eyes\neven, so purely sculpturesque in their lack of sight, were large, grand\nand brilliant. Their fixity lost its strangeness when you remembered\nthat behind them all was night. In the absence of the faculty which is\nthe cause and origin of facial expression, this blind Antinous had the\ncold serenity of marble, endowed with form by the genius of sculpture\nand with life by a vital spark. A breath, a ray of warmth, a mere\nsensation would suffice to animate the beautiful stone which, while it\npossessed every charm of form, was devoid of that consciousness of its\nown beauty, which is born of the faculty of seeing it.\n\nHe looked about twenty, and his strong and graceful frame was in\nevery respect worthy of the incomparable head that crowned it. Never\nwas a more lamentable injustice done by Nature, than to this perfect\nexample of humanity as to beauty, blest, on one hand, with every\ngift, and bereft, on the other, of the sense by which man has most in\ncommon with his fellow-man and gains familiarity with all the marvels\nof creation at large. The injustice was such, that these splendid\ngifts were useless--it was as though after creating all things the\nCreator had left them in darkness, so that he could not himself take\npleasure in his works. And to make the privation more conspicuous, the\nyoung man had mental lights of the highest order and a very superior\nintelligence. To have this and to lack the faculty of conceiving the\nidea of visibility, of form as distinct from mere matter, and at the\nsame time to be as beautiful as an angel; to have all the faculties of\na man and be as blind as a vegetable! It was strange and hard. We,\nalas! know not the secret of these terrible injustices; if we did,\nthen indeed the gates would be open to us which hide the primordial\nsecrets of moral and physical duty; we should understand the fathomless\nmysteries of inherited woe, of evil and of death, and might take\nmeasure of the dark shadow which always haunts life and all that is\ngood in it.\n\nDon Francisco Pen\u00c3\u00a1guilas, the young man's father, was more than good,\nhe was admirable; judicious, kind, genial, honorable and magnanimous,\nand well educated too. No one disliked him; he was the most respected\nof all the rich land-owners in the country side, and more than one\ndelicate question had been settled by the mediation--always equitable\nand intelligent--of the _Se\u00c3\u00b1or de Aldeacorba de Suso_. The house in\nwhich we now find him had been the home of his infancy. In his youth\nhe had been to America, and on returning to Spain without having made\nhis fortune, he had joined the National Guard. He then returned to his\nnative town where, having inherited a good fortune, he devoted himself\nto husbandry and to breeding cattle, and at the period of our story he\nhad just come into another and even larger sum.\n\nHis wife, who was an Andalusian, had died very young, leaving him\nthe one son who, from his birth, was found to be deprived of the most\nprecious of the five senses. This was the one drop which embittered\nthe tender father's cup. What was the use of reminding him that he\nwas wealthy, that fortune favored all his undertakings and smiled on\nhis house? For whose sake did he care about it all? For one who could\nsee neither the thriving beasts, the flowery meadows, the overflowing\ngranaries, nor the orchard with its abundant crop. Don Francisco would\ngladly have given his own eyes to his son, and have remained blind for\nthe rest of his days, if such an act of generosity were possible in\nthis work-a-day world; but, as it was not, Don Francisco could only\ncarry his devotion into practice by giving the hapless youth every\npleasure which could alleviate the gloom of the darkness in which\nhe lived. For him he was indefatigable in the cares and the endless\ntrifling details of forethought and affection of which mothers have the\nsecret--and fathers sometimes, when the mother is no more. He never\ncontradicted his son in anything which might console or entertain\nhim within the limits of propriety and morality. He amused him with\nnarratives and reading, watched him with studious anxiety, considering\nhis health, his legitimate amusements, his instruction and his\nChristian education; for, said Se\u00c3\u00b1or de Pen\u00c3\u00a1guilas, whose principles\nwere strictly orthodox: \"I would not have my son doubly blind.\"\n\nNow, as he came out of the house, he said affectionately:\n\n\"Do not go too far to-day, and do not run--good-bye.\"\n\nHe watched them from the gate till they had turned the corner of the\ngarden wall, and then he went indoors, for he had many things to do; to\nwrite to his brother Manuel, to buy a cow, to prune a tree, and to see\nwhether the guinea-hen had laid.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nABSURDITIES.\n\n\nPablo and Marianela went out into the country, preceded by Choto, who\nran on and danced round them, leaping with delight, and sharing his\ncaresses with great impartiality between his master and his master's\nguide.\n\n\"Nela,\" said Pablo,--\"it is a lovely day; the air is soft and fresh,\nand the sun warm without being scorching. Where shall we go?\"\n\n\"Let us go straight on through the meadows,\" replied Nela, poking her\nhand into one of the pockets of the lad's coat. \"What have you brought\nme to-day?\"\n\n\"Search and you will find,\" said Pablo laughing.\n\n\"Ah! Holy Virgin! chocolate! how I love chocolate!--nuts--and something\ndone up in paper. What is it? Oh, Blessed Virgin! a sweetie! Do not I\nlike sweeties! How rich I am! We do not have such good things to eat at\nhome, Pablo. There is no luxury in our food; there is no luxury in our\nclothes either, to be sure. In fact, no luxury of any sort.\"\n\n\"Where shall we go to-day?\" repeated the blind lad.\n\n\"Wherever you like, child of my heart,\" replied Nela, eating the\nsugar-plum and tearing up the paper it had been wrapped in. \"I hear and\nobey, king of the world.\"\n\nThe child's black eyes sparkled with happiness; her sprightly little\nbirdlike face smiled and wrinkled with satisfaction, and was not still\nfor an instant, as though fitful flashes came and went there like\ndimpling light on wavelets in a pool. This helpless little creature,\nwhose spirit seemed imprisoned and confined in the feeble body,\nexpanded and rose elastic when she was alone with her master and\nfriend. With him she at once became original, bright and intelligent;\nshe had feeling, grace, refinement and fancy. When she left him, the\ndark doors of a prison seemed to close on her once more.\n\n\"But I tell you we will go wherever you like,\" remarked the blind\nyouth. \"I like to do what you like. If you wish we will go to the clump\nof trees beyond Saldeoro--but just as you like.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, delightful!\" exclaimed Nela, clapping her hands. \"And as\nthere is no hurry, we can sit down whenever we are tired.\"\n\n\"There is a nice place near the spring--do you remember, Nela? And\nthere are some large tree-trunks, which seem to have been left there on\npurpose for us to sit upon, and we hear so many, many birds singing,\nthat it is quite glorious.\"\n\n\"And we can go past the mill-stream that, you say, talks and mumbles\nthe words out like a tipsy man. Oh! what a lovely day and how happy I\nam!\"\n\n\"Is the sun very bright, Nela? Though if you say 'yes,' I shall be none\nthe wiser, since _bright_ has no meaning for me.\"\n\n\"It is very bright indeed, _Se\u00c3\u00b1orito mio_. But what does it matter\nthat you cannot see it? The sun is not at all pretty; you cannot look\nin its face.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because it hurts.\"\n\n\"Hurts what?\"\n\n\"Hurts the eyes. How do you feel when you are happy?\"\n\n\"When I am out with you, just we two together in the fields?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Oh! I feel inside me a sort of freshness, a springing up of something\nsweet and soothing....\"\n\n\"That is just it; now you know how the sun shines bright.\"\n\n\"What with freshness?\"\n\n\"No, no--silly boy.\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"Oh, like that.\"\n\n\"Like that? But what is that?\"\n\n\"Like that,\" Nela insisted again.\n\n\"I see, it is a thing that cannot be explained in words. Do you know I\nused to have a notion of day and of night. It was daytime when people\ntalked, it was night when people were silent and the cocks crowed. Now\nI estimate it differently; it is day when you and I are together, and\nit is night when we are apart.\"\n\n\"Ah, Holy Mother!\" exclaimed the girl, shaking back the elf-locks that\nhung over her forehead.--\"To me, who can see, it is exactly the same.\"\n\n\"I mean to ask my father to let you come and live in our house, so that\nI may always have you with me.\"\n\n\"Good, good!\" cried Marianela clapping her hands once more. And as she\nspoke, she skipped on a little way in front and picking up her skirts\nwith a great deal of grace began to dance.\n\n\"What are you about?\" asked the blind boy.\n\n\"Child of my heart, I am dancing, I felt so happy that I thought I must\ndance.\"\n\nHowever, they now had to get over a little fence, and she slipped her\nhand into his. After surmounting this obstacle, they went along a lane\nhedged in on each side by luxuriant ivy and brambles. Nela held the\nbranches back that they might not scratch her companion's face, and at\nlast, after going down-hill for a considerable time, they went up a\nslope shaded by chestnut and walnut trees. When they had reached the\ntop Pablo said:\n\n\"If you do not mind we will sit down here. I hear some people going\npast.\"\n\n\"They are the people returning from the market at Homedes. To-day is\nWednesday. The high-road runs just below and we can rest here before\ngoing on.\"\n\n\"It is the best thing we can do. Choto, come here.\"\n\nThe trio seated themselves.\n\n\"The place is full of flowers,\" said Nela. \"What beauties!\"\n\n\"Pick me some. Though I cannot see them, I like to hold them in my\nhand. I fancy I can hear them.\"\n\n\"Here are some lovely ones.\"\n\n\"As I hold them in my hand I fancy that they make me feel and\nunderstand--I cannot tell you how--that they are pretty and gay. There\nis something inside me, that they seem to belong to, and that answers\nto them. Do you know, Nela, I fancy that I can really see, inside, as\nit were.\"\n\n\"Oh! yes, I quite understand--we have everything inside us there. The\nsun, the flowers, the moon and wide blue sky, with all the stars--we\nhave them all there; I mean that besides all the beautiful things\noutside us, and around us, we carry others with us in our minds. Here\nyou have a flower--and another, and another--six, all quite different.\nNow, what do you think flowers are?\"\n\n\"Flowers,\" said the blind youth, puzzled and lifting them to his face.\n\"Flowers are I fancy as if the earth smiled; but, in truth, I know very\nlittle about plants and flowers.\"\n\n\"Merciful Mother! what terrible ignorance!\" cried Nela, stroking her\nfriend's hands. \"Flowers are the stars of the earth.\"\n\n\"What an extravagant fancy! And what are the stars then?\"\n\n\"The stars are the eyes of those who have gone to Heaven and look down\non us.\"\n\n\"Well, but then the flowers....\"\n\n\"Are the eyes of those who are dead and have not gone straight to\nHeaven,\" said the girl, with all the decision and conviction of a\nDoctor of Theology. \"The dead are buried in the ground; but as they\ncannot lie still there without just peeping out at the world, they put\nforth something which takes the form of a flower. When, in a field\nthere are many, many flowers, it is because--once upon a time, long\nago, a great many people were buried there.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said Pablo very seriously. \"Do not believe such nonsense. Our\nholy religion teaches us that the spirit quits the flesh and that our\nmortal life comes to an end. What is buried, Nela, is a mere shell of\nuseless clay which can neither think, nor feel, nor even see.\"\n\n\"The books say so--but Se\u00c3\u00b1ana says that books are full of lies.\"\n\n\"But faith and reason say so too, dear Nela. Your imagination makes you\nbelieve a number of foolish things, but by degrees I will show you your\nerrors, and you will have true and right ideas about everything in this\nworld and the other.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye! I know, lessons at three for a penny!--And you wanted to\nmake me believe that the sun stands still and the earth spins round and\nround it! How can you know, you who cannot see. Merciful Heaven! May I\ndie on the spot, if the earth is not as steady as a rock and the sun\nrunning on. _Se\u00c3\u00b1orito mio_, I do not set up for learning, but I have\nspent many hours of the day and night in looking at the sky, and I know\nhow the machine works.--The earth is below and full of islands, some\nlarge and some small. The sun comes up on this side and goes down out\nthere. It is God Almighty's palace.\"\n\n\"Foolish child!\"\n\n\"But why not? Ah! you have never seen a fine day and clear sky; why,\nchild, you could fancy blessing was dropping down from it. I do not\nthink there could be wicked people--nobody could be wicked--if they\nwould only turn up their faces and see the great eye that looks down\nupon us.\"\n\n\"Your religion is full of superstition, my little Nela. I will teach\nyou something better.\"\n\n\"Nobody has taught me anything,\" said Mar\u00c3\u00ada very simply. \"But I myself,\nwhoever may object, have found out in my own head a great many ideas\nthat comfort me, and so when a good idea occurs to me, I say: 'Of\ncourse, it must be so; it cannot be otherwise.' At night, when I am\nalone at home, I wonder what will become of us when we die, and I think\nhow much the Holy Virgin loves us.\"\n\n\"Yes, she is our loving Mother.\"\n\n\"And I look up at the sky and I feel her close over my head, just as\nwhen you go up to any one, you feel the warmth of their breath. She\nlooks at us night and day through all the lovely things there are in\nthe world--do not laugh at me.\"\n\n\"Those lovely things...?\"\n\n\"Are her eyes, of course. Oh! you would understand it if you had eyes\nyourself. You have not seen a white cloud, a tree, a flower, running\nwater, a little child, a little lamb, the sparkling dew, the moon\nsailing across the sky, and the stars, which are the eyes of the good\nmen who are dead....\"\n\n\"They would not want to go up there if they lie under the ground\nthrowing out flowers.\"\n\n\"Only hear this all-knowing fellow! Why they stay down there only till\nthey are purified of sin, and then they mount and fly up there. Yes,\nI believe it, simpleton. Why, what can the stars be if they are not\nthe souls of those who are saved? Do not you know that stars sometimes\ncome down? I, I myself, have seen them fall; down, down, leaving a ray\nof light behind them. Yes, Se\u00c3\u00b1or, the stars come down when they have\nsomething to tell us here below.\"\n\n\"Oh, Nela!\" Pablo exclaimed eagerly. \"Your wild imaginings, absurd as\nthey are, charm and captivate me, for they betray the innocence of your\nsoul and the strength of your fancy. All your errors even are part of\nan earnest disposition to know the truth, and of great gifts, which\nwould be very superior talents if they were cultivated by reason and\neducation. You must acquire one precious accomplishment of which I am\ndeprived--you must positively learn to read.\"\n\n\"To read!--And who is to teach me?\"\n\n\"My father will; I will ask him to teach you. You know he never refuses\nme anything. What a pity it is you should live in such a wretched way;\nyour mind is a mine of treasures. You are goodness and sweetness\nitself and have a lovely imagination. God has given you a large share\nof all the gifts that are in his store and part of himself; I know\nit well--I cannot see what is outside, but I can see within, and I\nknow all the wonders of your spirit that you have shown me since you\nhave been my guide.--It is a year and a half now, and it seems like\nyesterday, that we first began our walks together--and yet, no; I\nhave known you a thousand years. How is it that there is such a close\nrelationship between your feelings and mine? Just now, for instance,\nyou have talked all sorts of extravagant nonsense, and I, who know the\ntruth about the world and religion, I was stirred to enthusiasm as I\nlistened to you. I feel as if it were a voice speaking in my own heart.\"\n\n\"Holy Mother!\" exclaimed the girl, folding her hands. \"And can he see\nsomething else that I feel?\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"That I was put into the world expressly to be your _lazarillo_, and\nthat my eyes would be of no use at all, if it were not to guide you and\nto tell you how beautiful the world is.\"\n\nThe blind boy turned his head suddenly and eagerly, and putting out his\nhands to touch the child by his side, he said anxiously:\n\n\"Tell me, Nela--what are you like?\"\n\nBut Nela did not answer; the question was a stab to her heart.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nMORE ABSURDITIES.\n\n\nBy this time they were rested, and they went on till they reached the\nbeginning of the grove beyond Saldeoro. Here they turned off into a\nclump of ancient walnut trees, of which the trunks and roots made\na sort of step-ladder in the soil, with mossy hollows and backs so\nperfect for seats, that the hand of man could have made no better. From\nthe top of the slope trickled a thread of water, tumbling from stone\nto stone, till it fell exhausted into a little basin constructed to be\na reservoir to feed the conduit by which the neighboring houses were\nsupplied. Before them the land sloped gently away, affording a lovely\npanorama of green hills with scattered groves and villas, and meadow\nplains where hundreds of cattle grazed and wandered peacefully. Quite\nin the background, between two lofty heights which were the farthest\nlimit of the land, lay a wide segment of purely blue sea. It was such a\nlandscape as makes a man feel to the utmost his relations to infinity\nand eternity.\n\nPablo had seated himself on the trunk of a tree, resting his left arm\non the edge of the basin; with his right hand he pulled at the boughs\nwhich hung low enough to touch his forehead, on which now and again the\nsunbeams played, as the boughs stirred.\n\n\"What are you doing, Nela?\" asked he, after a pause, not hearing the\nsteps, the voice, nor even the breathing of his companion. \"What are\nyou about, and where are you?\"\n\n\"Here I am,\" said Nela, laying her hand on his shoulder. \"I was looking\nat the sea.\"\n\n\"Ah! it must be a long way off.\"\n\n\"It is visible between the hills of Fic\u00c3\u00b3briga.\"\n\n\"Very large--immensely large--so wide that you might look all day, and\nnot have done looking--is it not?\"\n\n\"There is only a piece to be seen from here--like the bit you cut off\nwith your teeth when you put a slice of bread in your mouth.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes--I understand. Every one says there is nothing in the world\nso beautiful as the sea, because it is so grandly simple.--Listen,\nNela, to what I am going to say--but what are you doing?\" Nela had\ngrasped a bough of the tree with both hands, and was swinging by it\nlightly and gracefully.\n\n\"Here I am, _Se\u00c3\u00b1orito mio_. I was wondering why God should not give us\nhuman creatures wings to fly like birds. How delightful it would be\njust to give a flap and a whisk, and up we should go, and in one flight\nwe should be at the top of that peak between Fic\u00c3\u00b3briga and the sea.\"\n\n\"But though God has not given us wings he has given us thought\ninstead, which flies faster than any bird, since it can fly up to God\nhimself.--Tell me, child, of what good would wings be to me, if God had\ndenied me the gift of thought?\"\n\n\"But I should like to have both. And if I had wings I would pick you\nup in my little beak to take you out of this world, and carry you up\never so much higher than the clouds.\" The blind lad put out his hand to\nstroke Nela's hair.\n\n\"Sit down by me; are you not tired?\"\n\n\"Just a little,\" she said, sitting down and laying her head with\nchildlike confidence on her master's shoulder.\n\n\"You are breathing fast, Nelilla, you are very tired; it is with trying\nto fly.--Well, what I want to say to you is this: Talking of the sea\nput me in mind of a thing my father read to me last night. You know\nthat ever since I was old enough, my father has been in the habit of\nreading to me every evening different books of science, or history,\nor art, or mere amusement. I might say that these readings make up\nall I know of life. The Lord, to compensate me for being blind, has\ngiven me a very good memory, and it has turned these readings to good\naccount; for though there has been no regular method in them, I have\ncontrived to put some order into the ideas that have penetrated to my\nunderstanding. How I have enjoyed listening and learning about the\nadmirable laws and order of the universe, the harmonious circling of\nthe stars, the motion of atoms, and above all, those grand principles\nwhich govern our souls and minds. I have enjoyed history too, which is\na true account of all the things men have done in former times; for\nthough, my child, they have always done the same wicked and foolish\nthings, they have nevertheless gone on improving, some of them doing\ntheir utmost--but without ever succeeding--to attain that perfection\nwhich belongs to God alone. And finally, my father has read me some\ndeeper and more mysterious things that cannot be understood at once,\nbut when they are thought over and considered they occupy and charm\nthe mind. He does not enjoy that sort of reading very much, as he does\nnot altogether follow it, and it has tired me sometimes, while at\nother times it has delighted me. And there is no doubt that when you\nhave an author who explains himself clearly, such subjects are very\ninteresting. They deal with cause and effect, the rationale of all we\nthink, and how we think, and teach us about the essential nature of\nthings.\"\n\nNela did not seem to understand a single word of what her friend was\nsaying, but she listened attentively with her mouth wide open; to\ninhale, if possible, the essences and causes of which her master was\ndiscoursing, opening her beak like a bird watching the movements of a\nfly he wants to catch.\n\n\"Well, then,\" he went on, \"last night he was reading me some pages\nabout Beauty. The author, in discussing Beauty, said that it was the\noutcome and radiance of goodness and truth, with many other ingenious\ncomparisons so well thought out and expressed, that it was a pleasure\nto listen.\"\n\n\"And was that book,\" said Nela, anxious to prove herself equal to the\noccasion, \"like one father Centeno has.... _The thousand and I don't\nknow how many nights_?\"\n\n\"No, no, goose-cap; it is a book on Beauty in the abstract, you will\nnot understand--on ideal Beauty--and yet you must understand that\nthere is a sort of Beauty which cannot be seen, nor touched, nor\nperceived by any of our senses.\"\n\n\"For example, like the Virgin Mary,\" interrupted Nela, \"whom we cannot\nsee nor touch, because her pictures are not herself, but only her\nlikeness.\"\n\n\"You are quite right; it is just like that. Thinking over this, my\nfather shut the book, and talked of one thing and another. We spoke\nthen of beauty of form, and my father said: 'This unfortunately you can\nnever understand.' But I said I could. I said that there could only be\none type, and that would apply to all.\"\n\nNela, caring little enough for such subtleties, had taken the flowers\nout of her companion's hands, and was arranging their colors to her\ntaste.\n\n\"I have a clear idea about this,\" the blind lad went on, vehemently,\n\"an idea that I have been quite in love with for some months. Yes, I\nam sure, quite sure of it; I want no eyes to see that, and I said to\nmy father, I have an ideal of enchanting beauty, a type which includes\nevery possible perfection, and that type is Nela. My father began to\nlaugh, and said 'yes.'\"\n\nNela turned as scarlet as a poppy, and could not answer a word. During\na short spasm of terror and pain, she felt as if the blind boy were\nlooking at her.\n\n\"Yes, you are the most perfect beauty imaginable,\" Pablo went on,\neagerly. \"How could it be possible that your goodness, and innocence,\nand freshness and grace--your imagination, your sweet and lovely soul,\nwhich have all combined to enliven and comfort my dark and melancholy\nlife--how, I say, could it be possible that they should not be embodied\nin a person as lovely? Nela, Nela,\" and his voice trembled with\nanxiety.--\"Tell me--are you not beautiful--very pretty?\"\n\nNela was silent; she instinctively put her hands up, and stuck into her\nhair some of the half-faded flowers she had gathered in the meadows.\n\n\"You will not say? You are modest. Indeed, if you were not, you would\nnot be the sweet little soul that you are; the logic of Beauty would be\nat fault, and that cannot be. You do not answer?\"\n\n\"I ...\" murmured Nela timidly, not ceasing her occupation, \"I do not\nknow--they say that I was very pretty as a baby--but now....\"\n\n\"You are still?\"\n\nMar\u00c3\u00ada, in her utter confusion, could only say:\n\n\"Now--well, you know that people talk nonsense--and make stupid\nmistakes--sometimes those who have eyes see least.\"\n\n\"Yes indeed, well said! Come here and kiss me.\"\n\nNela did not instantly obey, for having succeeded in fixing a sort of\ngarland of flowers in her hair, she now felt an eager wish to see the\neffect of the adornment in the clear mirror of the reservoir. For the\nfirst time in her life she felt an impulse of vanity, and leaning on\nher hands, she bent over the basin.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" asked the blind lad.\n\n\"I am looking at myself in the water, which is just like a\nlooking-glass,\" she replied, confessing her vanity with perfect\nsimplicity.\n\n\"You need not do that. You are as lovely as the angels round the throne\nof God.\" He had fired himself with enthusiastic imaginings.\n\n\"The water is ruffled now,\" said the girl, \"and I cannot see myself\nplainly. It is trembling as much as I am. There, now it is quieter, now\nit is still again.--I can see myself now, very well.\"\n\n\"And see how pretty you are! Come here, my child?\" added the blind\nyouth, holding out his arms.\n\n\"I ... pretty!\" she said, in anxious confusion. \"Well, what I see in\nthe pool is not so ugly as they say. The fact is, there are a great\nmany people who do not know how to see.\"\n\n\"Aye, a great many.\"\n\n\"If only I were dressed as other girls are!\" exclaimed Nela, with a\ntouch of pride.\n\n\"You shall be.\"\n\n\"And the book said I was beautiful?\" asked Nela, appealing to every\nsource of conviction.\n\n\"I say so, and I always speak the truth!\" cried the boy, carried away\nby his eager imagination.\n\n\"Maybe it is so,\" said Nela, moving away from her not too flattering\ncontemplation. \"Maybe that men are very stupid, and do not see things\nas they really are.\"\n\n\"Human nature is liable to a thousand errors.\"\n\n\"I do believe it,\" said Mariquilla, greatly comforted by her friend's\nwords. \"What can they see to laugh at in me?\"\n\n\"Oh! how miserable is the lot of man!\" cried the blind boy, driven to\nwild absurdity by his raving fancy. \"The gift of sight may lead him\ninto many errors--may betray him into a misapprehension of abstract\ntruth--and abstract truth proves that you are beautiful, without any\nstain or blemish of ugliness. If any one tells me the contrary, I will\ngive him the lie. Away with their theories of form. Oh, fool! into\nwhat sins your eyes may mislead you! Nela, come here, I want to have\nyou by my side and kiss your beloved head.\"\n\nShe threw herself into his arms.\n\n\"Sweet, lovely darling!\" he exclaimed, clasping her passionately to his\nbreast. \"With all my soul I love you!\"\n\nNela did not speak. Her heart was full of innocent and tender devotion,\noverflowing with pure delight. The youth, trembling and throbbing, held\nher more closely than ever, saying:\n\n\"I love you more than my life. Angel of God, love me too or I shall\ndie!\"\n\nMar\u00c3\u00ada freed herself from his embrace, and he remained lost in\nbewilderment. She, the tiny woman, felt an overwhelming and\nirresistible impulse to look at her face once more in the water. She\ngently stole up to the edge, and there against the green background\nshe saw the insignificant little face, with its black eyes, its dull\ncoloring, its sharp nose--not altogether ugly that nose--the short,\nunkempt hair, and the birdlike, eager expression. She leaned farther\nover the stone brim to see her body; it was pitiably made and mean. The\nflowers in her hair fell into the water, making circles in it, and the\nimage wavered. She, poor child, felt as if her heart were being torn\nup by the roots, and she staggered backwards, murmuring:\n\n\"Mother of God! how hideous I am!\"\n\n\"What are you saying, Nela? I thought you spoke.\"\n\n\"I did not say anything--son of my soul.--I was only thinking.--Yes, it\nis high time we should turn homewards. It will soon be dinner-time.\"\n\n\"Well, come along, you shall dine with me, and bye-and-by we will go\nout again. Give me your hand; I will not have you leave me.\"\n\nWhen they reached home, Don Francisco was in the forecourt with two\nother gentlemen; Marianela recognized the engineer of the mines and the\nstranger who had lost his way in La Terrible the night before.\n\n\"Here are the _Se\u00c3\u00b1or ingeniero_,\" said she, \"and his brother--the\ngentleman of last evening.\"\n\nAll three men gazed with evident interest at the blind youth as he\napproached.\n\n\"We have been expecting you some time, my son,\" said the father, taking\nhis hand and introducing him to the doctor.\n\n\"Let us go indoors,\" said the engineer.\n\n\"Blessings on all men of science with good hearts!\" exclaimed Don\nFrancisco, turning to the doctor. \"Walk in, gentlemen; happy is the\nhour when you enter my house.\"\n\n\"Now, let us study the case,\" murmured Golfin.\n\nWhen Pablo and the two visitors had gone in, Don Francisco turned to\nMariquilla, who was standing transfixed and doubtful in the middle of\nthe court-yard, and said kindly:\n\n\"You see, Nela, you may as well go home. My son will not be able to go\nout this afternoon.\" And then, seeing that still she did not move, he\nadded:\n\n\"You may run round to the kitchen. Dorotea will give you something\nnice.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nAND YET MORE.\n\n\nThe following day Pablo and his guide set out at the same hour; but,\nas the sky was overcast and a disagreeable breeze was blowing which\nthreatened to become a south-westerly gale, they decided on making\ntheir walk a short one. Crossing the village green of Aldeacorba, they\nwent along the great slope above the mines to the west, intending to\ngo down into the excavations.\n\n\"Nela, I must tell you something that will make you leap with joy,\"\nsaid the blind lad when they were at some distance from the house. \"My\nheart is bursting with happiness.--I feel as if the whole Universe, all\nthe sciences, history, philosophy, natural history--all that I have\never learnt had got inside me, and was dancing in procession. You saw\nthose two gentlemen who were waiting for me yesterday....\"\n\n\"Don C\u00c3\u00a1rlos and his brother....\"\n\n\"He is a famous doctor who has been all over America, making wonderful\ncures.--He is come to see his brother, and as Don C\u00c3\u00a1rlos is a great\nfriend of my father's, he asked his brother to examine me. How kind\nand gentle he is! First he sat talking to me; he asked me a number\nof questions, and told me all sorts of pleasant and amusing stories.\nThen he told me to sit quite still; I felt his fingers on my eyelids,\nand after a long time he said something I did not understand--medical\nterms, and my father never read me anything about medicine. Then he\nled me close to the window, and while he examined my eyes with some\ninstrument the room was as quiet.--Then he said to my father: \"It is\nworth trying.\" They said more, but in a low voice that I might not\nhear, and I think they talked partly by signs. When the visitors were\ngone, my father said to me: 'Son of my soul, I cannot conceal from you\nthe joy that is in me. This man, this angel from Heaven, has given\nme a hope--a very faint hope--but we cling most to a hope when it is\nsmallest. I try to give it up by telling myself it is impossible--no,\nalmost impossible--but it sticks to me like a burr.'--This was what my\nfather said, and I could hear in his voice that he was crying. What are\nyou doing, Nela? Are you dancing?\"\n\n\"No.--Here I am, close to you!\"\n\n\"But you used to dance when I told you anything that made me happy.\nWhere shall we go to-day?\"\n\n\"It is a dull day--we will go as far as Trascava, that is a sheltered\nspot, and then go down into La Terrible.\"\n\n\"Very well, just as you like.--Oh, Nela! If only it could be true; if\nGod would have pity on me, and grant me the joy of seeing you. Even\nif I could only see for one day, and were blind again the next, how I\nwould thank Him.\"\n\nNela said nothing. After feeling at first intensely happy, she now\nwalked on thoughtfully, with her eyes fixed on the ground.\n\n\"Many wonderful things happen in the world,\" Pablo went on. \"And God's\nmercy works in strange ways--strikes as suddenly as his wrath. It comes\nupon us unexpectedly, after long punishment and torment, just as his\nanger falls on us in the midst of happiness which has seemed secure and\neternal--do you not think so?\"\n\n\"Yes--what you hope will be accomplished.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"My heart tells me so.\"\n\n\"Your heart tells you! And why should not such warnings come true?\"\ncried Pablo, fervently. \"Yes--such chosen souls as yours can, in some\ncases, foresee the issue. I have noticed it in myself, for, as I am\nnot diverted from self-inspection by seeing things outside me, I have\nperceived sometimes that I had a whispered presentiment that was quite\ninexplicable. Then when some event or other has come to pass, I have\nsaid to myself with astonishment: 'I knew all this beforehand.'\"\n\n\"The same thing happens to me,\" replied Nela. \"Yesterday you told me\nyou loved me dearly, and when I got home I said to myself: 'It is very\nstrange, but I knew something of this.'\"\n\n\"It is wonderful, dear little one, how perfectly our souls are one.\nUnited by our own wish and will, nothing is wanting but a bond of\nunion. That bond shall be tied if I really gain the precious sense\nthat I have never enjoyed. The idea of seeing would never have taken\npossession of my mind if I did not cherish above all things the idea\nthat through it I should love you better. The acquisition of that power\ncan be nothing to me but the faculty of admiring in a new kind of way\nwhat I already admire so truly by the way of love.--But I fancy you are\nsad to-day.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am; and to tell you the truth, I do not know why. I am very\nhappy and very sad, both at once. The day is so gloomy--it would be\nbetter if it never were day at all, always night.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay, things are good as they are. Day and night! If God ever\ngrant me to know the difference, how happy I shall be! Why are you\nstopping?\"\n\n\"We have come to a dangerous bit. We must turn aside a little way to\nget to the path.\"\n\n\"Ah! La Trascava! This slippery grass slopes down till it is lost in\nthe chasm. Whatever falls down there does not come up again. Let us go\naway, Nela; I do not like this place.\"\n\n\"Silly boy, it is a long way from this to the mouth of the chasm. And\nit is very pretty here to-day.\"\n\nNela stood still and detained her companion by the arm, looking down\nat the mouth of the gulf which opened in the earth, in shape like a\nfunnel. The sloping sides of this narrow, deep basin were covered by\nextremely fine turf; at the very bottom a large oblong rock lay on the\ngrass among brambles, fennel shrubs and rushes, and an immense variety\nof gay-colored flowers. The stone looked like a large tongue. You felt,\nrather than saw, that by the side of it there was an opening, an abyss,\nhidden by plants, such as Don Quixote had to cut away when he slid into\nthe cavern of Montesinos.\n\nNela seemed never tired of looking.\n\n\"Why do you say that the horrible Trascava looks pretty?\" asked Pablo.\n\n\"Because it is so full of flowers. Last week they were all dead and\nover, but now they have bloomed afresh, and it really is lovely to\nlook at. And there are such numbers of birds there, and of butterflies\ntoo, sucking honey from the flowers. Choto, Choto, come here--do not\nfrighten the poor little birds.\"\n\nThe dog, who had run down the slope, came galloping back at Nela's\ncall, and the fluttering republic of birds returned to take possession\nof their common property.\n\n\"I have a perfect horror of the place,\" said Pablo, pulling the girl's\narm. \"Now, shall we go as far as the mines? I know the way there, and\nfeel on my own ground; we will go round behind el Barco.--Choto, go on\nin front, do not get under my feet.\"\n\nThey went down a path cut into steps and soon reached the basin formed\nby digging out the earth and ore. Leaving the zone of vegetation,\nthey suddenly crossed the boundary line of a geological zone, so to\nspeak, an enormous trench, whose sides, wrought by the pick and shovel,\ndisplayed an interesting section of stratification, where the different\nlayers showed the greatest variety of colors and earths. This was the\nplace where Teodoro Golfin had fancied himself in the hull of a wrecked\nvessel, worn away by the waves--and its popular name _el Barco_ (the\nship), had been suggested by that very resemblance. By day, however,\nthe spectator was chiefly struck by the sections of the strata with\ntheir sulphurous and carboniferous veins, black sedimentary deposits,\nlignites, in which jet frequently occurred, streaks of ferruginous\nearth that looked as if they had been mixed with blood, and large,\neven layers of slate, split in a thousand places by human devices,\nbristling with splinters and riven into fissures and clefts, looking\nlike wounds seen through a strong magnifier; while a thread of water,\nstained with oxide of iron, that flowed down the middle, might be taken\nfor blood.\n\n\"Where is our seat?\" asked the young man. \"Let us go there; we shall be\nsheltered from the wind.\"\n\nOut of the bottom of the great cutting they went up by a rough\nfoot-path, that had been made between broken stones and earth overgrown\nwith rank fennel, and at the top they sat down under the shelter of\nan enormous crag, rent across the middle. The two halves of the rock,\nstanding opposite each other, with their jagged faces, looked for all\nthe world like two yawning jaws trying to meet and close.\n\n\"How pleasant it is here!\" Pablo said. \"Sometimes there is a\ndisagreeable draught through this chasm, but I do not feel it to-day.\nWhat we hear is the trickling water down inside the bowels of La\nTrascava.\"\n\n\"It is very quiet to-day,\" observed Nela. \"Would you like to lie down?\"\n\n\"That is a good idea! Last night I could not sleep, for thinking of\nall my father had said to me, of the doctor, of my eyes.--All night I\nfelt as if a hand went into my eyes and opened a closed and moss-grown\ndoor.\" As he spoke he stretched himself at full length and laid his\nhead on Nela's knees.\n\n\"A door,\" he went on, \"which was quite in my inmost feeling, opened,\nas I tell you, showing a way into a room where the idea that haunts me\nwas shut up. Oh! Nela of my heart, best beloved, idolized darling, if\nonly God would grant me the sense I lack. Then I should think myself\nthe happiest of men--for I am almost that already, merely from having\nyou to be the friend and companion of my life. Very little is needed\nto make us two one--nothing but to see you and rejoice in your beauty,\nwith that joy in seeing which I cannot even comprehend, since I have\nonly a vague conception of it. I have a questioning spirit only because\nI have no power to see for myself. I fancy it will be like a new way\nof loving you. I think of nothing but your beauty, still, there is\nsomething in it which I cannot realize as my own.\"\n\n\"Hark!\" said Nela suddenly, with evident interest in something quite\ndistinct from what her friend was saying. \"Do not you hear?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Down in there--La Trascava--it is talking.\"\n\n\"Superstitious child! water cannot talk, my Nela. What language could a\ndriblet of water speak? There are but two things which speak, my sweet:\nthe tongue and the conscience.\"\n\n\"And La Trascava,\" said Nela, turning paler. \"It is a whisper only:\n'Yes, yes, yes,' it says. And sometimes I can hear my mother's voice,\nsaying quite plainly. 'My little girl, it is very pleasant down here.'\"\n\n\"It is all your fancy. Well, fancy talks too; I forgot that. My\nimagination sometimes chatters so fast, that I have to tell it to be\nsilent. Its voice is loud, persistent, intolerable; that of conscience\nis deep, calm, convincing; there is no answering or refuting it.\"\n\n\"Now it sounds as if it were crying,\" said Nela, still listening to the\nbubbling water. \"It is dying away little by little.\"\n\nSuddenly a light gust came up from the chasm.\n\n\"There, it sighed deeply--did not you hear? Now I hear the voice again;\nit is speaking low, and it says to me in a whisper, a tiny whisper in\nmy ear....\"\n\n\"Well, what does it say?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Mar\u00c3\u00ada shortly, after a pause. \"You say it is all\nnonsense--you may be right.\"\n\n\"I will get all these absurd ideas out of your head,\" said the blind\nyouth taking her hand. \"We are going to live together all our lives.\nOh! Heavenly Father! If I am never to enjoy the blessing of which\nThou didst deprive me at my birth, why hast Thou allowed me to hope?\nHapless wretch that I am, if I am not born anew under the hands of\nDoctor Golfin. A new birth indeed--a new life! Oh! my darling, I swear\nto you by the image of God that exists in my soul, glorious, real and\nimmutable, that you and I will never part by my will. I shall have\neyes, Nela, eyes to delight in your presence, and then I will marry\nyou. You will be my beloved wife--life of my life, and the joy and\npride of my soul.--And do you say nothing to this even?\"\n\nNela bent her head down over the lad's handsome face; she wished to\nspeak, but could not for emotion.\n\n\"And if God will not after all vouchsafe me this mercy,\" added Pablo,\n\"still you will not leave me, still you will be my wife--unless it\nhorrifies you to think of marrying a blind man. Indeed, my dearest, I\nought not to inflict such a burden on you. You will meet some good\nman who will love you, and who will make you happy. Your wonderful\nkindness, your noble feelings, your sweet face, must win many hearts\nand inspire the purest love in all who have to do with you--your future\ncannot fail to be bright and happy. I swear to you that I shall love\nyou as long as I live; seeing or blind, I devote myself to you before\nGod in the fullest, most perfect, and most unbounded love.--Will you\nnot speak to me, Nela?\"\n\n\"Yes--I love you dearly--very, very dearly ...\" said Nela, putting her\nface close to his. \"But do not be anxious to see me. Perhaps I am not\nso nice as you fancy.\"\n\nAs she spoke, Nela felt in her pocket and brought out a piece of\nsilvered glass, a dull and useless fragment of a cheap mirror, which\nhad been broken a week since in the Centeno household. In this she\nlooked at herself. The image was all awry, and in consequence of the\nsmall size of the looking-glass she was obliged to study it a bit at\na time, first one eye and then her forehead, till, holding it farther\noff, she could command a view of half her face at once. But alas! the\nresult of her investigations was sad enough--as she looked in the\nglass, the tears started from her eyes.\n\n\"Nela, I felt a drop on my forehead--it is raining.\"\n\n\"Yes, my child, it seems to be raining,\" said Nela with a gulping sob.\n\n\"No--you are crying.--Something in my heart tells me so. You are\ngoodness itself; your soul and mine are united by some divine and\nmysterious bond; they can never be parted--is it not true? they are two\nhalves of one whole.--Are they not?\"\n\n\"Quite true.\"\n\n\"Your tears give me a plainer answer than words could. You love me do\nyou not, and will always love me, just the same whether I recover my\nsight or remain blind?\"\n\n\"The same, just the same!\" cried Nela vehemently.\n\n\"And will always stay with me?\"\n\n\"Always.\"\n\n\"Then listen,\" cried the blind lad in passionate rapture. \"If I had to\nchoose between remaining blind and losing you, I would choose....\"\n\n\"You would choose to remain blind! Oh! merciful Mother of Heaven! how\nhappy--how happy I am!\"\n\n\"I would choose not to see your sweet face with these eyes, for I can\nsee it in my soul as clearly as truth. You live here, in my heart, and\nto me you are more lovely and enchanting than anything on earth.\"\n\n\"Oh! yes, yes,\" cried Nela half-crazed. \"I must be beautiful--I must be\nlovely!\"\n\n\"Listen,\" said Pablo, \"I have a presentiment, a sure anticipation. It\nis as though the voice of God within me promised me that I should have\nmy sight, that I shall see you, that we shall be happy. Do you not feel\nit yourself?\"\n\n\"I--yes, I feel sure you will see....\"\n\n\"I shall see your face--what happiness!\" cried the blind boy in the\nhigh-pitched ecstatic tone, which was peculiar to him in moments of\nexcitement.--\"But I see it already, I see it now in my heart as plainly\nas the truth in my soul.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, oh! yes,\" Nela repeated wildly, with wide-open eyes and\nquivering lips. \"It is true, I am, I must be, beautiful!\"\n\n\"Bless you, sweet one!\"\n\n\"And you,\" she said gravely, kissing his forehead. \"Now, are you not\nsleepy?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am beginning to be sleepy. I did not sleep all night. And I am\nso comfortable here.\"\n\n\"Then sleep, my child....\"\n\nAnd she began to sing a lullaby. In a few minutes he was asleep; but\nNela sat listening to the voice of La Trascava, which said: \"Daughter\ncome ... daughter come.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nTHE BROTHERS GOLFIN.\n\n\nTeodoro Golfin did not waste his time at Socartes. The first day\nafter his arrival he spent several hours in his brother's laboratory,\nand during the following days he went from one part of the mines to\nanother, examining and admiring all he saw--here the awful might of\nnatural forces, and there the power and enterprise of human skill. At\nnight, when all was still in the busy village, and nothing was awake\nbut the snorting furnaces, the worthy doctor, who was an enthusiastic\nmusician, listened with delight to his sister-in-law's piano; Se\u00c3\u00b1ora\nSof\u00c3\u00ada, was Don C\u00c3\u00a1rlos' wife, but their children were all dead.\n\nThe two brothers were devotedly attached to each other. Born in the\nhumblest rank of life, they had struggled hard in early youth to rise\nabove ignorance and poverty, often on the point of giving way to the\ndifficulties that beset them; but the impetus of manly determination\nwas so strong in them, that at length, gasping for breath, they\nreached the longed-for land, rising superior to the beating waves\nin which vulgar souls splash and struggle in a perpetual state of\nshipwreck.\n\nTeodoro, who was the eldest, was a medical man before C\u00c3\u00a1rlos was\nqualified as an engineer, and he helped him to the utmost so long as\nthe younger brother needed it, and when he saw him fairly started, he\ntook the step to which his enterprising spirit had long aspired, and\nset out for South America. There he practised with other celebrated\nphysicians, gaining fame and wealth. After a short visit at home, in\nSpain, he returned to the New World, and even after a second voyage\nhome he went back again; but during each of these expeditions he\nmade a short tour in Europe to avail himself of the advances made in\nophthalmic science which he particularly cultivated.\n\nHe was a man of unpolished manners, dark and with an expression at\nonce intelligent and sensual; his lips were thick, his skin opaque\nand hairy, his eyes bright and keen; his frame was robust and his\nconstitution sound, though somewhat injured by the South American\nclimate. His large, round face, his prominent brow, his short,\nrebellious hair, the flash of his eyes and his thick, square hands, had\nled to his being spoken of as \"the black lion.\" In truth, he was like\na lion, and like the king of beasts, he never lost an opportunity of\nasserting the estimation in which he held himself. However, this vanity\nof a really distinguished man was the most pardonable of vanities,\nfor it consisted chiefly in his persistently displaying his two great\ntitles of fame and honor, namely: his devotion to surgery and the\nlowness of his origin. He spoke incorrectly, from his utter inability\nto elaborate phrases with ease and elegance. His rapid and broken\nsentences followed the course of his ideas, which were as swift as the\nelectric spark.\n\n\"We,\" Teodoro would say, \"although we have sprung from the grass by\nthe way-side, which is the lowest origin conceivable, have grown into\nstalwart trees. Long live labor and human enterprise! I cannot but\nthink that we Golfins, though Heaven knows where we came from, must\nhave some English blood in our veins. Even our name seems to me to be\nof purely Saxon origin. I give it this etymology, _Gold-find_, or, as\nyou may say, Gold-finders. Well, and my brother finds it in the bowels\nof the earth, while I find it in that marvellous miniature universe:\nthe human eye.\"\n\nAt the period of our story he had just arrived via New York and\nLiverpool, and, as he declared, he now meant to remain at home; but no\none believed it, for he had said so many times before and had not kept\nhis word.\n\nHis brother C\u00c3\u00a1rlos was a gentler being, placid, studious, a slave to\nhis duties, and devoted to mineralogy and metallurgy to the point of\ncaring far more for these two branches of learning than for his wife's\nsociety. But the couple lived, nevertheless, in perfect harmony; or,\nas Teodoro said, in an isomorphous state, crystallizing on the same\nsystem. As for himself, when matrimony was spoken of, he would say:\n\n\"To me, marriage would be an epigenesis, a pseudo-morphous\ncrystallization, that is to say, a mode of crystallization which would\nnot harmonize with my nature.\"\n\nSof\u00c3\u00ada was a very good woman, who had been very handsome, but whose\nbeauty was daily losing character and expression from her unfortunate\ntendency to stoutness. She had been told that an atmosphere charged\nwith coal smoke had a tendency to reduce fat, and for this reason she\nhad come to live at the mines, without ever leaving them the whole\nyear through. The horrible air, charged with dust, calamine and smoke,\nannoyed her much however. She had no child alive, and her principal\noccupation consisted in playing the piano and in organizing societies\nof benevolent ladies for giving the poor help in their homes, and for\nmaintaining hospitals and schools.\n\nAt Madrid, for many years her energy had been prodigious, a real model\nfor all who feel prompted to acts of charity. With the help of two or\nthree ladies of rank, equally devoted to their humble and suffering\nneighbors, she had organized more than twenty dramatic performances,\nand as many fancy balls, six bull-fights and two cock-fights, all for\nthe benefit of the poor.\n\nAmong her other manias, which were apt to be but transient, however,\nwas one which perhaps is less commendable than that for helping the\nneedy, and which consisted in surrounding herself with dogs and cats,\ndevoting herself to these animals with an affection really worthy to be\ncalled love. Lately, since she had lived at Socartes, she had kept a\ntoy-terrier which had been brought to her as a commission from England\nby Ulises Buli, the head of the machinery department. This was a\ndelicate and slender creature, as tricky and amusing as a child. It was\ncalled L\u00c3\u00adli, and had cost a small fortune in London--as dogs go.\n\nOn fine days the trio walked out together; when it was wet they played\nand sang, for Sof\u00c3\u00ada had a modest pipe which, at Socartes, passed\nfor singing. The deputy engineer had a deep bass voice, and Teodoro\nlikewise was _basso profondo_. C\u00c3\u00a1rlos could sing but a little higher,\nso that the whole effect was somewhat like a priestly choir, in which\nSof\u00c3\u00ada's treble came out as if she were a priestess being carried off\nto be immolated. All the pieces they sang were--or at any rate sounded\nlike--priests offering a sacrifice, and a priestess being sacrificed.\n\nOn the days when they walked far they took with them a sort of picnic\nafternoon meal. One evening--it was at the end of September, and six\ndays after the doctor's arrival at the mines--the party were returning\nhomewards in the following order: L\u00c3\u00adli, Sof\u00c3\u00ada, Teodoro, C\u00c3\u00a1rlos. The\npath was too narrow to allow of their walking two and two. L\u00c3\u00adli wore a\nlittle sky-blue coat or gaberdine with his mistress's initials worked\nupon it; Sof\u00c3\u00ada carried her parasol like a gun over her shoulder, and\nTeodoro had his stick in precisely the same position with his hat\nhanging on the end of it; it was one of his favorite whims to walk out\nbare-headed. They were passing above La Trascava when L\u00c3\u00adli, leaving the\npath, with his elastic little legs like springs, began to run on the\nturf that covered the slope to the chasm. First he ran, but then he\nslipped on the grass. Sof\u00c3\u00ada gave a cry of terror. Her first impulse,\nprompted by an almost maternal feeling, was to run after the little\nbeast that was in no real danger; but her husband stopped her, saying:\n\"The devil may have L\u00c3\u00adli if he wants him--but he will come back. It is\nimpossible to go down, the turf here is so slippery.\"\n\n\"L\u00c3\u00adli, L\u00c3\u00adli,\" cried Sof\u00c3\u00ada, hoping that her touching appeal would arrest\nthe creature on the road to perdition, and bring him back to the path\nof virtue and duty. But the tenderest adjurations had no effect on the\nrebellious soul of L\u00c3\u00adli, who went lower and lower. From time to time he\nlooked up at his mistress with his bright, black eyes, which seemed to\nsay: \"For mercy's sake do not be so foolish.\"\n\nAt the large, moss-grown, white rock, which lay like a lid at the\nvery mouth of the chasm, L\u00c3\u00adli stopped. All stood with their eyes\nfixed on the spot, and they at once perceived something moving there.\nThey supposed it to be some beast of prey hiding behind the rock; but\nSof\u00c3\u00ada gave another shriek of astonishment rather than of terror, and\nexclaimed:\n\n\"It is Nela.--Nela what are you doing there?\"\n\nOn hearing her name called, the girl appeared greatly disturbed, and\ncolored deeply.\n\n\"What are you doing there, mad child?\" repeated the lady. \"Take up L\u00c3\u00adli\nand bring him back to me. Heaven have mercy on us! but what next will\nthat creature be doing? Just look at the place she has put herself in!\nIt is all your fault that L\u00c3\u00adli went down there--what an example to set\nthe poor little animal. It is all your fault that he behaved in this\nnaughty, wilful way.\"\n\n\"That child is a perfect limb of mischief,\" said Don C\u00c3\u00a1rlos to his\nbrother. \"Only look at the place she has got to.\"\n\nWhile, on the top of the slope, they were thus discussing her, Nela,\ndown at the bottom, was trying to catch L\u00c3\u00adli, who, more wilful and\ndaring than he had ever been before in the whole course of his\nmonotonous existence, constantly eluded her grasp. His mistress shouted\nto him in vain to \"be good and behave himself,\" while he, ignoring\nthe most elementary principles of duty, went on leaping and frisking,\nlooking up at her, from time to time, with consummate impudence, as\nthough to say: \"My good lady, just go on with your walk and leave me in\npeace.\"\n\nAt last, however, the sportive little beast got entangled among the\nbriars which grew in the hollow, and there his little great-coat got\nhim into dire trouble; the poor dog, finding it impossible to escape\nfrom the brushwood, began to bark lamentably for help.\n\n\"He will be lost, he will be killed!\" wailed the Se\u00c3\u00b1ora. \"Nela, Nela,\nif you will only save him, I will give you a fine, big dog. Save\nhim--go carefully--hold fast.\"\n\nNela went boldly to the rescue; setting her foot on the brambles and\nstout-stemmed creepers that grew over the rift, and holding on by one\nhand to the rock, she put out the other to take hold of L\u00c3\u00adli's tail,\nby which she pulled him out of the tangle in which he had been caught.\nThen, patting and coaxing him, she mounted in triumph to the top of the\nslope.\n\n\"It is your fault, all your fault,\" said Sof\u00c3\u00ada crossly, and boxing\nthe dog's ears very gently. \"What on earth made you go down into that\nhole--you know he goes after you wherever he finds you--hussy that you\nare!\"\n\nAnd then she kissed her recovered treasure and gave him one or two mild\nslaps, and after having assured herself that his precious skin was\nwhole, she pulled his little coat straight, which had got dragged over\nhis head, and gave him to Nela, saying:\n\n\"Take him, and carry him in your arms, for he must be tired, and\nsuch a long scamper may do him harm. But take care of him--go on in\nfront.--Take great care of him--you see I am close behind to keep an\neye on you.\"\n\nThe family party set out again, with Nela leading the way. L\u00c3\u00adli looked\nat his mistress over Nela's shoulder, and seemed to say: \"My good\nmistress, what a simpleton you are!\"\n\nTeodoro Golfin had said not a word during the whole of L\u00c3\u00adli's agitating\nescapade, but when they had started on their way once more and were\ncrossing the fields, where the three could walk abreast without\ninconvenience, the doctor said to his brother's wife:\n\n\"I cannot but think, dear Sof\u00c3\u00ada, that you are unreasonably devoted to\nthe little dog. To be sure a dog that cost two hundred _duros_, is\nindeed a dog among dogs. Still, I cannot but ask myself how it is that\nyou have spent time and money in making a great-coat for his highness\nthe terrier, while it has never occurred to you to buy a pair of shoes\nfor Nela.\"\n\n\"Shoes for Nela!\" exclaimed Sof\u00c3\u00ada laughing. \"What for, I should like\nto know. She would have worn them through in two days. You may laugh\nat me as much as you please--well, I admit that my affection for L\u00c3\u00adli\namounts to an extravagance; still, you cannot accuse me of want of\ncharity.--Nor indeed, I must say, should I ever allow you to take\nsuch a liberty,\" and as she spoke she drew herself up with a solemn\nlook of offended dignity. \"As to knowing how to exercise charity\nwith due prudence and judgment, I believe I may hold my own with\nany one, be it whom it may--for charity does not consist merely in\ngiving without rhyme or reason, not knowing whether your alms are well\nor ill-bestowed. Do you suppose you can teach me anything? My dear\nTeodoro, I am quite as experienced in such matters as you are in the\ntreatment of eyes.\"\n\n\"I know, I know, my dear.--You have done wonders. You need not tell me\nfor the fiftieth time of all the dramatic entertainments, balls and\nbull-fights, you have got up for the benefit of the poor, nor of the\nlotteries, which have brought in large sums; though, after providing\nfood for any number of idle vagabonds, there has been but a small\nfraction left for the sick and suffering! All these facts only go to\nprove to my mind the singular state of a society, which cannot be\ncharitable without dancing, bull-fights or lottery tickets.--No, we\nneed not discuss all that; I know and admire those heroic achievements;\nthey have their good side, and that not a small one. But you and your\ngay friends very rarely put yourself in connection with any poor soul,\nto learn from his own lips the cause and history of his misery, or to\ndiscern what kind of wretchedness it is that oppresses him--for there\nare, actually, some troubles so extraordinary that the gift of a few\ncoppers can do nothing to alleviate them, no, nor even a morsel of\nbread.\"\n\n\"Here we have our philosopher well astride on his hobby,\" said Sof\u00c3\u00ada\nspitefully. \"Pray how do you know what I have ever done, or what I\nought to do?\"\n\n\"Nay, do not be vexed,\" said Golfin; \"for all my discourse tends to a\nsingle point, and that is that Nela should have shoes.\"\n\n\"Very well, then to-morrow morning I will buy her a pair.\"\n\n\"No--for I will buy them myself this evening. Do not poach on my\npreserves, Se\u00c3\u00b1ora.\"\n\n\"Here--Nela,\" cried the lady, seeing that she had gone some distance\nahead. \"Do not go so fast; keep in sight that I may see what you are\nabout.\"\n\n\"Poor little creature!\" said her husband. \"Who could guess she was\nsixteen years old!\"\n\n\"She is dreadfully stunted, miserable little thing!\" exclaimed\nSof\u00c3\u00ada. \"I cannot help asking, why God should permit such creatures to\nlive? And again I ask myself, what in the world can be done for her?\nNothing--nothing, but to feed and clothe her after a fashion--but you\nsee, she tears everything she puts on. She cannot labor because she\nfaints away--she has not strength enough to do any kind of work. She\nskips from stone to stone, or climbs the trees, playing and chattering\nthe whole day long and singing like the birds; what clothes she has are\nsoon reduced to rags....\"\n\n\"And yet,\" said C\u00c3\u00a1rlos, \"I have noticed that she is very intelligent.\nThere is a great deal of acuteness and cleverness under that simple\nexterior and wild rusticity. No, no, Nela is no fool by a long way.\nIf any one had taken the trouble to teach her anything, she would\nhave learnt it better, perhaps, than most children. Would you believe\nit? Nela has a great imagination; but lacking, as she does, the most\nrudimentary knowledge, it has of course, made her sentimental and\nsuperstitious.\"\n\n\"In point of fact she is in the condition of all primitive races,\" said\nTeodoro. \"She is at the pastoral stage of civilization.\"\n\n\"Only yesterday,\" C\u00c3\u00a1rlos went on, \"I was passing by La Trascava and I\nsaw her sitting exactly where we found her again just now. I called her\nand made her come to me, and I asked her what she was doing there; and\nwith the most perfect simplicity she told me she was talking with her\nmother.--You know, perhaps, that Nela's mother threw herself into that\nchasm.\"\n\n\"That is to say that she killed herself,\" said Sof\u00c3\u00ada. \"She was a\nwoman of bad character and worse feeling, from all I have heard of\nher. C\u00c3\u00a1rlos was not living here then, but they say she drank like a\nstoker. And I ask you: Do these vile creatures, who end a life of sin\nby committing the greatest crime of all--Suicide--deserve any pity from\nthe human race? There are things too horrible to contemplate--wretches\nthat ought never to have been born. Teodoro may argue as much as he\nlikes, but I cannot help asking you....\"\n\n\"Ask nothing, my dear sister,\" said Teodoro warmly. \"For I could only\nreply that the suicide deserves our deepest and fullest pity. So far as\nabuse goes, heap it on her by all means, and as much as you please; but\nat the same time it might be as well to enquire what were the causes\nthat brought her to such a fearful extremity of desperation--and I may\nadd that if society had not wholly abandoned her and left her no way\nout but the yawning door of that hideous abyss which seemed to invite\nher....\"\n\n\"Abandoned by society! Well, some must be ...\" said Sof\u00c3\u00ada flippantly.\n\"Society cannot take care of every one. Look at the statistics of\npopulation--only look, and you will see how many poor there are to\nprovide for. Besides, supposing society does overlook some--what is\nreligion for?\"\n\n\"I am speaking of those poor wretches who add to all their other\nmiseries, ignorance, which is the greatest of all. An ignorant soul,\ndebased and superstitious, has none but the vaguest and absurdest\nideas of God. The sense of something Great and Unknown, instead of\nwithholding him, impels him to crime. It is rarely indeed that the\nthought of religion is of any good to those who vegetate in stolid\nignorance. No intelligent friend ever goes near them, neither master\nnor priest; the only superior they ever come into contact with, is the\njudge who tries them.\n\n\"It is strange to see how inexorably you condemn what, after all, is\nyour own work!\" he went on, twisting the stick on which his hat was\nstill mounted. \"You stand looking straight before you, seeing at the\nvery threshold of your own comfortable homes a crowd of neglected\ncreatures, deprived of everything that childhood needs, from parents\nto playthings--you see them, I say, without its ever occurring to you\nto raise them an inch in the world, by telling them that they too are\nhuman beings, and giving them some of the ideas they so deplorably\nlack, without ever dreaming of ennobling them by lifting them out of\ntheir brutalizing, mechanical toil, to some intelligent work; you see\nthem dwelling in filthy hovels, ill-fed, sinking lower day by day in\ntheir savage squalor, and it never occurs to you to spare for them a\nlittle of the comfort and luxury that surround you! You save all your\nenergies to declaim against murder, robbery and suicide, without ever\nreflecting that you are, in fact, keeping open school for these three\ncrimes.\"\n\n\"You seem to forget that there are houses of refuge, hospitals,\nasylums ...\" said Sof\u00c3\u00ada tartly. \"Read statistics, Teodoro, and you will\nsee the number of miserable creatures.... Read statistics.\"\n\n\"I do not read statistics, my dear sister, and your statistics count\nfor nothing with me. Asylums are good--not that they can ever solve the\ngreat problem of orphanage. A hapless orphan, dropped in the streets\nor in the fields, bereft of all personal affection, and cared for only\nby a town council--rarely, indeed, is the vacuum filled which yawns\nin his soul for the love of a parent--not to speak of the vacuum where\nself-respect, honor, and responsibility ought to be, and so rarely are\nfound. And on that point I have an idea of my own--but, perhaps, it\nwill appear to you absurd....\"\n\n\"Tell us, at any rate.\"\n\n\"The problem of orphanhood, and the miseries of infancy, will never\nbe completely and finally solved, any more than the rest of our great\nsocial problems; still, it will be lightened when custom, supported by\nlaw--yes, by law, you see I am in earnest--when custom and law insist\nthat every orphan, whatever its birth--do not laugh--has a right to\nclaim adoption by some married couple in easy circumstances, and who\nhave no children. By this plan, there will be no childless parents, and\nno fatherless children.\"\n\n\"Yes, by this plan,\" retorted Sof\u00c3\u00ada, \"we should be parents to Nela!\"\n\n\"And why not?\" said Teodoro. \"At the same time you would not waste\ntwo hundred _duros_ in buying a dog, nor the livelong blessed day in\ntalking nonsense to his highness, Master L\u00c3\u00adli.\"\n\n\"And why are rich bachelors to be exempt under this delightful law? Why\nshould not they also be burthened, each with his orphan?\"\n\n\"I have no objection ...\" said the doctor; he was looking at the\nground. \"But what is this? Blood?\"\n\nThey all looked down, and at regular intervals they saw small spots of\nblood.\n\n\"Mercy!\" cried Sof\u00c3\u00ada, covering her eyes. \"It is Nela--see, it is where\nshe has trodden; these are her footmarks.\"\n\n\"Oh yes! I see. It was when she went into the brambles to fetch your\nprecious dog. Nela, come here.\"\n\nNela, whose right foot was bleeding a good deal, came hobbling back\nagain.\n\n\"Give me my poor L\u00c3\u00adli,\" said the lady, taking the dog out of the ragged\nchild's arms. \"Do not hurt him; does it hurt you much? Poor little\nthing.--Oh! how it is bleeding.--I cannot bear to look at it.\" And\nSof\u00c3\u00ada turned her back to spare her sensitive nerves, hugging L\u00c3\u00adli more\nclosely.\n\n\"Let us see what has happened,\" said Teodoro, lifting Nela up and\nseating her on a high stone that was at hand. Then, putting on his\nspectacles, he said: \"It is quite a trifle, only a few scratches; there\nis a thorn in here I rather think.--That hurts you? Yes, just so, here\nis the villain.--Wait a minute. Now, Sof\u00c3\u00ada if you cannot look on at a\nsurgical operation, you had better walk on.\"\n\nWhile his sister went slowly forward to save her nervous system this\nterrible shock, Golfin took a small case out of his pocket and a pair\nof tweezers out of the case, and in less than a winking the thorn was\nextracted.\n\n\"That is a brave little woman,\" he said to Nela, who had not even\nwinced. \"Now we will tie this foot up.\" And he bound it round with his\nhandkerchief. Marianela jumped down to walk and C\u00c3\u00a1rlos offered her his\nhand.\n\n\"No, no--come here,\" said Teodoro. He took the little girl under the\narms, and with a rapid and dexterous twist perched her on his right\nshoulder.\n\n\"If you do not feel safe hold on to my hair,\" he said. \"It will not\ncome off. Now, you must carry the stick with the hat.\"\n\n\"What a ridiculous sight!\" said Sof\u00c3\u00ada, in fits of laughter as they came\nup with her. \"Teodoro, with Nela on his shoulder, and then the stick\nand Gessler's hat on the top....\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nNOBODY'S CHILDREN.\n\n\n\"There you see a man ready for anything and everything, my dear Sof\u00c3\u00ada,\"\nsaid Teodoro. \"It is the result of our education, is it not, C\u00c3\u00a1rlos?\nof having had no coddling in our childhood, and having been accustomed\nfrom our tenderest infancy to the idea that no one could be our\ninferior? Men who have made themselves, as we have done, who, without\nany mortal help nor any safeguard but strong will and high ambition,\nhave been able to triumph in the struggle for existence--the devil's\nin it, but they are the only people who really know how to help the\nhelpless! I will not tell you half the things I have been able to do\nin my life--treating my neighbor as myself--for fear of falling into\nan ugly trick of singing my own praises; for fear too of making you\nenvious, in spite of your raffles and benevolent lotteries--enough of\nthat.\"\n\n\"Nay, tell us, or tell us some other time.\"\n\n\"No, no, such things should be kept secret for modesty's sake. I am\nbound to confess that I cannot boast of any considerable store of that\nlovely grace; I am not lacking in vanity, and one of the things I am\nvainest of, is of having been a beggar, of having asked charity from\ndoor to door, of having walked barefoot with my brother C\u00c3\u00a1rlos, and\nslept in corners under door-ways, without a roof, without shelter,\nwithout a home of any kind. Some wonderful spirit of energy and\ndetermination burned within me--whence it came I know not; but I felt\nthat before us lay two paths, one to prison and one to glory. I took my\npoor little brother on my shoulders--just as I am carrying Nela--and\nI said: 'Our Father which art in Heaven--save us!' And he saved us. I\nlearnt to read, and then I taught my brother; I served many masters,\nwho gave me food and let me go to school. I saved my pittance. I bought\na money-box, and scraped enough together to buy some books. How I\nbegan medicine, I do not know; but somehow I did, while my brother was\nearning a living as an errand boy in a shop.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" exclaimed Sof\u00c3\u00ada much annoyed, for this\nwas a theme she particularly disliked. \"I cannot help asking; what\nis the use of recalling all these childish details? Besides, you\nexaggerate them greatly.\"\n\n\"I exaggerate nothing,\" said Teodoro with triumphant jollity. \"Just\nlisten, Se\u00c3\u00b1ora, and say nothing. I speak of what I know with the\nauthority of experience. Hear me all ye poor, all ye helpless ones,\nand ye forsaken little ones! I took to medicine, God knows how; I\nlearnt, God knows how. A worthy man--blessings on his memory! gave\nme good counsel and helped me with money; I loved the science, but\nhow could I study without ceasing to work for my living? This was\na terrible dilemma. Do you remember, C\u00c3\u00a1rlos, when we both went\nto ask for employment in the barber's shop, in the old _calle de\nCofreros_?[5] Never in our lives had either of us had a razor in\nhis hand, but we had to earn our bread by shaving. At first we only\nlooked on--do you remember C\u00c3\u00a1rlos--and then we wielded the noble\ninstruments ourselves.--Bleeding was the making of us. Then I began\nto study anatomy; a noble, a glorious science! but my school-work\nbecame a serious matter, and I had to give up working for the worthy\nbarber.--He cried, positively cried, the day I left him; he gave me\ntwo _duros_, and his wife made me a present of a pair of her husband's\nold trousers.--Then I went as a valet. God was always merciful in\ngiving me good masters. My love of study interested these dear, kind\npeople, and they allowed me as much spare time as possible. I sat up\nto study; nay, I studied in my sleep. I was like a monomaniac, for\nwhile I did the washing, I repeated the names of the different parts of\nthe human frame. I remember, that as I brushed my master's clothes, I\nstudied muscular anatomy--as I folded a sleeve I would say to myself:\n'_deltoid_, _biceps_, _supinator_, _flexor_, _cubitalis_;' and over his\ntrousers I would repeat, '_glutaeus_, _psoas_, _gemellus_, _tibialis_.'\nIn that house they used to give me broken food, which I carried to\nmy brother, who was living with a worthy man who bought and sold old\nclothes. Do you remember, C\u00c3\u00a1rlos?\"\n\n\"I remember well,\" said C\u00c3\u00a1rlos with feeling. \"And I am grateful to the\ngood soul who gave me a roof over my head in return for some trifling\nservice in keeping his accounts. And it was there that I was so lucky\nas to come across the retired Colonel, who taught me the elements of\nmathematics.\"\n\n\"Well! you have not a rag that you blush to display to all the world!\"\nsnorted Sof\u00c3\u00ada.\n\n\"My brother asked me for bread,\" Teodoro went coolly on, \"and my answer\nwas: 'Bread? work at mathematics.' One day my master gave me tickets of\nadmission to the Theatre de la Cruz; I took my brother, and we enjoyed\nit enormously, but C\u00c3\u00a1rlos caught a cold and inflammation of the lungs.\nThat was a dreadful, a terrible business; it was a blow at the very\nroot of our existence, a shot in our backbone. But who is cast down?\nOn we had to go.--He must be cured. A physician who had taken a great\nfancy to me, undertook to doctor him.\"\n\n\"It was nothing less than a miracle that he saved my life in that\nsqualid hole--a perfect museum of old clothes, old iron, and old\nleather.\"\n\n\"God was on our side--I see it plainly. Oh! I knew very well in whom\nI trusted,\" Teodoro went on, with the fervid rapid eloquence, which\nwas as characteristic of the man, as his black elf-locks and leonine\ncountenance. \"But, for my brother to have medicine, I had to do without\nclothes. The Pharmacopeia did not admit of tailors' bills--nay,\nprescription after prescription--first my cloak went, then my overcoat,\nthen my shoes were turned into pills. However, my master stood by me.\nI got some clothes once more, and my brother was outside the house\nagain. The doctor said: 'He will get quite well in the country.'--'The\ncountry,' said I, and I thought it over; then he may go to the School\nof Mines. My brother was a good mathematician, I taught him some\nchemistry, he soon took a fancy to rocks and stones, and before he\nwent into the school he had begun going out into the fields to pick\nup pebbles. Well, I meanwhile went on my way, beaten by winds and\nwaves; every day I knew something more of medicine. A famous operator\ntook me as his assistant; then I was no longer a mere menial--I was a\nservant to science. My master fell ill, I nursed him like a Brother of\nCharity--but he died, leaving me a legacy. God bless me! but it was a\nfortune! It consisted of a walking-stick, a machine for making cigars,\na hunting-horn, and four thousand _reales_ in money. My brother bought\nbooks and I bought some clothes, and as soon as I was decently dressed,\nI began to get patients. It really seemed as if folks fell ill on\npurpose to give me employment. On--straight on! Years and years went\nby; at last, after many miseries I saw, far off, the way to a refuge.\nStill, my brother and I sailed on without any too severe toil, and we\nwere never melancholy; God smiled upon our souls. Well, indeed, for us!\nGod held out his hand to us, as it were. I began to study the eye and\nsoon could operate for cataract, but I wanted something more than this.\nI was earning money, no doubt, but my brother cost me all I earned. At\nlast, however, C\u00c3\u00a1rlos passed out of the schools. Three cheers for the\nbrave--none but the brave win the day. I saw him settled at Riotinto\nwith a good salary, and then off I went to America. I was a sort of\nColumbus, the Columbus of labor; a sort of Cort\u00c3\u00a9s; I discovered a New\nWorld for myself, and having discovered it, I conquered it.\"\n\n\"You are your own trumpeter,\" said Sof\u00c3\u00ada laughing.\n\n\"If there are still heroes to be found you are one of them,\" said\nC\u00c3\u00a1rlos with eager admiration for his brother.\n\n\"Well, set to work now, noble Demi-god,\" said Sof\u00c3\u00ada, \"crown your\nachievement by working a miracle, and restore to sight a man blind from\nhis birth.--Look, there is Don Francisco coming out to meet us.\"\n\nAnd, in fact, mounting the ridge which shuts in the mines to the west,\nthey had come to Aldeacorba, and past the house of Pen\u00c3\u00a1guilas, who,\npulling on his coat in the utmost haste now came hurrying towards them.\nDarkness was falling fast.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nTHE PATRIARCH OF ALDEACORBA.\n\n\n\"The cows are just being milked,\" he began, without wishing them\ngood-evening. \"I thought you would all like some milk. I hope to see\nyou well, Se\u00c3\u00b1ora Sof\u00c3\u00ada--and you Don Teodoro. The sight of you is good\nfor sore eyes. But what is the matter with Mar\u00c3\u00ada Canela--a little lame\npaw? How long have you been so spoiled, little one?\"\n\nThe whole party turned into the court-yard. They could hear the deep\nlowing of the cows, which had just been driven to their stables, and\nthe homely sound, with the fresh country smell of the hay, which the\nlaborers were carrying from the lofts, soothed the senses and the mind.\nThe doctor seated Nela on a stone bench, while she, speechless with\nsurprise and respect, dared not budge an inch, but could only wonder at\nthis delightful state of things.\n\n\"And where is Pablo?\" the engineer enquired.\n\n\"He is just gone down into the garden,\" said Se\u00c3\u00b1or de Pen\u00c3\u00a1guilas, as he\noffered Sof\u00c3\u00ada a rustic seat. \"You might run off and join him Nela.\"\n\n\"No, no, I do not wish her to go yet,\" said Teodoro detaining her.\n\"Besides, she is going to have some milk with us.\"\n\n\"Do you wish to see my son this evening?\" asked Pen\u00c3\u00a1guilas.\n\n\"No, yesterday's examination was quite satisfactory,\" replied Golfin.\n\"The operation can be performed.\"\n\n\"And successfully?\"\n\n\"Ah!--as to that I cannot say. How great a pleasure it would be to give\nsight to a young fellow who so richly deserves it, I need not tell you!\nYour son has a most superior intelligence, a brilliant imagination, and\na most delightful nature. His total ignorance of the outer, visible\nworld, only throws his beautiful qualities into relief; they stand out\nin conspicuous simplicity, with the naked charm and dignity of a work\nof Nature, untouched and unspoiled by the hand of man. He is full of\nidealism, it affects all his thoughts--a grand and beautiful idealism.\nIt reminds me of a colossal mass of unwrought marble--a block as it\nlies in the quarry. He knows nothing of reality, he lives a charmed\nlife, a life of pure illusion. If we could but give him sight! Still,\nI say to myself--supposing that by giving him sight we should make him\na man instead of an angel.--It is a question that raises doubts in my\nmind. However, we are bound to try to make a man of him; it is the\nduty of science; we will drag him out of the world of fancy into that\nof reality, and then, with his powerful mind, he would rapidly gain\naccurate information and sound judgment. He would soon acquire the\ninvaluable power of estimating the true relative value of things.\"\n\nThree cups of milk were now brought in, white, warm, fragrant, and\nfrothy to the very rim. Pen\u00c3\u00a1guilas handed a cup first to Sof\u00c3\u00ada, and the\ntwo gentlemen took the others; but Teodoro Golfin offered his to Nela,\nwho was overwhelmed with bashfulness and refused to touch it.\n\n\"Come, little woman,\" said Sof\u00c3\u00ada, \"do not be so rude; take what is\ngiven you.\"\n\n\"Another cup of milk for Don Teodoro,\" said Don Francisco to the\nservant. And then they heard the milk as it flowed into the pails from\nthe full udders of the cows.\n\n\"He will appreciate the true relative value of things,\" said Don\nFrancisco, repeating the doctor's last words, which had made a deep\nimpression on his mind. \"That is an admirable observation, Don Teodoro.\nAnd with regard to the subject under discussion, I must explain to you\nthe doubts I have felt for some days past. But I may as well sit down.\"\nAnd Don Francisco seated himself on a stool he had in his hand. The\nothers had already been accommodated with chairs brought out of the\nhouse, and Nela was still perched on the stone bench. The milk she had\ndrunk as she was bidden had left a thin white moustache on her upper\nlip.\n\n\"I must tell you Don Teodoro that for some days I have been very uneasy\nat the excited state in which my son has been; I attribute it to the\nhope that has been held out to him--but still, there is something\nelse--something more than that. You know that I am in the habit of\nreading to him out of various books. I believe that this reading has\ndone much to fire his imagination and instruct his mind, and that many\nideas have been developed in his brain, which are, as it were, above\nthe comprehension of a blind man. I do not know whether I am making\nmyself clear.\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"There is no end to his discussions and arguments; I am astounded\nby the depth and acuteness of his remarks, though I feel that his\nknowledge is mixed up with a thousand misconceptions, from want of\nmethod and from his ignorance of the visible world.\"\n\n\"It could not be otherwise.\"\n\n\"But the strangest thing is that, carried away by his\nimagination--which is like a young Hercules fettered with chains within\na dungeon, and struggling to burst its bonds and break down walls....\"\n\n\"Good, very good, well said.\"\n\n\"His imagination, I was saying, cannot rest in the darkness of his\nsense, and strives to reach our world of daylight, making up for his\nwant of sight by the boldness of its assumptions. Pablo has a wonderful\nspirit of enquiry, but it is like a noble bird whose wings are clipped.\nFor some few days he has been almost delirious; he does not sleep and\nhis passion for information has been almost madness. At all hours of\nthe day he asks for some new book, and at every pause he makes the\nkeenest observations, but with such a mixture of simple innocence,\nthat he makes me laugh. He asserts and maintains the absurdest things,\nand if I contradict him--I am really afraid of his going out of his\nmind--of his brain softening. If you could only see how melancholy and\nhow disputatious he sometimes is. He takes up an idea and, come what\nmay, it is impossible to get it out of his head. Now, for some days, he\nhas had a fixed idea, which is as touching as it is preposterous. He\nwill have it that Nela is pretty.\"\n\nThey all laughed, and Nela turned scarlet.\n\n\"That Nela is pretty!\" exclaimed Teodoro kindly. \"Well, and so she is.\"\n\n\"Oh! sweetly pretty, particularly with that moustache!\" said Sof\u00c3\u00ada.\n\n\"She has a dear little face of her own,\" repeated Teodoro, putting his\nhand under her chin; \"Sof\u00c3\u00ada, lend me your handkerchief. Come, we will\nget rid of the moustache.\"\n\nTeodoro returned the handkerchief to Sof\u00c3\u00ada after wiping Nela's face.\nDon Francisco told the girl to go and join the blind boy, and she\nhobbled away.\n\n\"And if I contradict him,\" he then went on, \"my son tells me that,\nperhaps the gift of sight has weakened my perception of the true aspect\nof things--a quaint paradox!\"\n\n\"Do not contradict him at all, and for the present discontinue\nyour readings. For a few days we must adopt a regimen of absolute\ntranquillity. The brain must be treated with the utmost consideration\nbefore attempting any operation of this kind.\"\n\n\"If it is indeed God's will that my son should receive his sight,\"\nsaid Pen\u00c3\u00a1guilas devoutly, \"I shall regard you as the greatest and most\nbeneficent of men. The darkness of his eyes is the darkness of my life;\nthat black shadow has saddened all my days, and clouds all the wealth\nand ease of which I am master. For I am rich--but of what use are\nriches? How can I care for the things he cannot see. Only a month ago I\nfell heir to a fine fortune--you know, Don C\u00c3\u00a1rlos, my cousin Faustino\ndied at Matamoros. He had no children, so my brother Manuel and I\nare his heirs. It is throwing pearls before swine--not as regards my\nbrother, who has a daughter, a sweet girl, old enough to marry--but so\nfar as I am concerned, a wretched man who can never see his son enjoy\nthe best pleasures of a respectable and easy position.\"\n\nA long silence followed, interrupted only by the gentle lowing of the\ncows in the adjoining stable.\n\n\"And then,\" added the worthy father in melancholy tones, \"he knows\nnothing of the pleasures of work, the greatest pleasure of all.\nIgnorant, as he is, of the beauties of Nature, what can he know of\nthe delights of the country or the charms of agriculture? I cannot\nimagine how God can bear to deprive a human creature of the pleasure\nof admiring a fat beast, a tree loaded with pears, or a green pasture;\nof seeing the fruits of the earth in their abundance; of sending out\nthe laborers to their day's toil, and reading the signs of the weather\nin the sky. For him life is simply a fevered dream--it is lonely too;\nsolitary, for he can never have the comfort of a family round him. When\nI die what family will the poor blind boy have? He will not want to\nmarry, nor will he find a woman of good family who would engage herself\nto him, in spite of his wealth; nor, indeed, could I advise him to\nmarry. So that when Don Teodoro gave me a hope, I felt as if heaven was\nopened to me; I had visions of a young and happy and sensible marriage;\ncherubs--my grandchildren--fluttered round me; I saw my tombstone\ngraced and fragrant with the blossoms of a future generation, and the\nloving care which even after death should follow me to the grave.--You\ncannot enter into all this; you cannot know how my brother, who is as\ngood as gold, God bless him!--as soon as he heard of my hopes, began\nto plot and plan and dream.--Here, this is what he says\"--and he took\nout a parcel of letters which he turned over for a few minutes without\nfinding the one he wanted.--\"Well, to make a long story short, he\nwas beside himself with delight and he said to me: 'I will marry my\nFlorentina to your Pablo, and so we shall get compound interest on\nthe half million of _pesos_ left by cousin Faustino.'--I can see him,\npoor old Manuel, rubbing his hands and strutting about as his way is\nwhen he has hit on a good idea. I am expecting him and his daughter\nto arrive at any hour; they are coming to stay with me for the 4th of\nOctober, and to see what comes of this attempt to bless my son with the\nlight of day.\"\n\nBy this time it was growing dark and the party of four became aware of\na most appetizing vapor issuing from the house, and announcing a savory\nfarm-supper. The village patriarch, who seemed the very incarnation of\nthe spirit of the place--a tranquil melancholy--spoke again presently:\n\"My brother's happiness and my own depends on my having a son, whom I\nmay propose as a husband for his daughter, who is as sweet and fair as\nthe Holy Virgin, as we see her represented when the angel of the Lord\ncomes to say: 'The Lord is with thee.' My blind boy is not the man--but\nmy Pablo, with his eyesight, would realize my fondest dreams and bring\nthe blessing of God into my house.\"\n\nThey were all silent, deeply impressed by the worthy father's simple\nand pathetic utterances, and he himself raised his rough, brown hand,\nhardened by labor, to wipe away a tear.\n\n\"What have you to say to all this?\" C\u00c3\u00a1rlos asked his brother.\n\n\"I can say no more than that I have conscientiously examined the\ncase, and can find no sufficient reason for saying it is hopeless,\nas the other distinguished operators have said whom our good friend\nhas consulted. I cannot pledge myself to succeed, nor can I think it\nimpossible. The examination I made yesterday revealed no defect or\ninjury in the retina, and no disease in the optic nerve. If the retina\nis perfect, all that is needed is the removal of some impediment in\nfront of it. The crystalline lens often becomes opaque--sometimes hard\nand stony--and this is what does the mischief. If all the other parts\nof the organ are healthy and work--but, in the commonwealth of the eye,\nmany individual portions are only too ready to become atrophied by\nidleness.\"\n\n\"So that, in short, it amounts simply to congenital cataract,\" said\nPen\u00c3\u00a1guilas eagerly.\n\n\"Oh no, Se\u00c3\u00b1or; if it were no more than that, it would be a happy thing\nfor us! All that would be needed would be to get rid of the part that\ndoes its duty so badly. It ought to let the light in and instead of\nthat, it is congested, degenerate, stony, and as opaque as a wall.\nNo--there is something more than that, Don Francisco. The iris is\ndefective, the pupil must be taken in hand.--Still, I can laugh all\nthese details to scorn if, when I enter into possession, as it were, of\nthis dormant organ, I only find the choroid and the retina uninjured.\nIf, on the other hand, when I have removed the opaque lens and let the\nlight in, I find complete amaurosis--if it were only partial, that\nwould be something--but if it is total.... When the nerve of sight is\ndead we can do nothing. The deep mysteries of life are closed against\nus. There is nothing for it but patience. This case is to me a most\ninteresting one; there are symptoms which lead me to believe that the\ninternal function is unimpaired. The retina, as Sovereign lord, seems\nquite disposed to receive the light I shall introduce to it, and that\nhigh functionary, the vitreous humor, will probably find it no novelty.\nIf from long want of exercise it has sunk into a state of incipient\nglaucoma--a kind of melancholy--we will treat it for that. All will\nthen be well in that darkened chamber. But there is another thing to\nbe considered. A fissured iris, and an ordinary cataract usually admit\nsome gleam of light, and our patient sees not a glimmer. This made\nme hesitate. In fact, the sclerotic too is very much thickened; the\nimpediments to the admission of light are many and serious.... However,\nwe shall see, Don Francisco. Have you courage for anything?\"\n\n\"Courage! What should I have courage for?\" asked Don Francisco.\n\n\"Sir, you will want all your courage if....\"\n\n\"Well, if...?\"\n\n\"If, after undergoing a painful operation, your son is still as blind\nas before. I said to you, plainly: The case is not desperate; shall I\noperate?\"\n\n\"And I answered, and I answer once more; Yes--operate; and God's will\nbe done. Onwards!\"\n\n\"Aye, onwards! You have taken my motto.\"\n\nDon Francisco rose and wrung the surgeon's hands, that were so like a\nlion's paws.\n\n\"In this climate the operation may be favorably performed early in\nOctober,\" Golfin went on. \"To-morrow we will decide on the regimen to\nwhich we must subject our patient. Meanwhile we will be going, for it\nis fresh up on this hill.\"\n\nPen\u00c3\u00a1guilas pressed shelter and supper on his friends, but they would\nnot accept. They set out homewards with Nela, whom Teodoro insisted\non taking with him, and Don Francisco kept them company as far as the\nworks.\n\nSoothed by the silence and beauty of the night, they fell into\nconversation on lighter themes--on the yield and profits of the\nmines, and other local matters. The Golfins having reached home, Don\nFrancisco turned back alone and heavy-hearted, walking slowly, with\nhis eyes fixed on the ground. He was thinking of the terrible days of\ndoubt and hope, of expectation and anxiety which were coming on him.\nPresently he was met by Choto, and the pair lazily climbed the wooden\nstair. The moon gave them light, and the old man's shadow went up in\nfront of him, broken by the steps into a zigzag monster that leaped\nfrom plank to plank. The dog trotted by its side and Don Francisco, in\nthe absence of any other mortal to whom he could confide the thoughts\nthat wearied his brain, presently said:\n\n\"Oh Choto! will it succeed?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nDOCTOR CELIPIN.\n\n\nThat worthy, Se\u00c3\u00b1or Centeno, having refreshed his mind with the dull\ncolumns of his newspaper, and 'Se\u00c3\u00b1ana,' his wife, after enjoying the\nmore intoxicating delights of counting and feeling the coin in the\nstocking, had taken themselves to bed. Children first and parents\nafter, they had all marched off to their respective couches. First\nthere was the mumbled Litany, sounding like some muttered gibberish;\nthen yawns, while the sluggard fingers made the sign of the cross--and\nthen the stony-hearted family slept.\n\nWhen the house was as still as the grave itself, a soft rustling began\nto be audible in the kitchen, like the stirring of bats coming out of\ntheir hiding nooks to see life. The hampers opened and Celipin heard\nthese words:\n\n\"Celipin--look here; I have got something nice for you to-night.\"\n\nCelipin could see nothing, but he put out his hand and took from\nNela's two _duros_. Having assured himself of their genuineness by\ntouch--since he could hardly have done so by sight--he remained\nspeechless with astonishment.\n\n\"Don Teodoro gave them to me,\" added the girl, \"to buy myself a pair of\nshoes. But I do not want shoes; so I give them to you, and so you will\nget on faster.\"\n\n\"Hurrah! You are as good as the Holy Virgin, Nela--I want very little\nmore now, and when I have got another half-dozen or so of _reales_--you\nshall see what Celipin is made of.\"\n\n\"Aye, and listen to me, child; the man who gave me that money ran about\nthe streets barefoot begging when he was a boy, and now....\"\n\n\"You do not mean it! Don Teodoro? And now he has such lots of money.\nThey say six mules could not carry it all.\"\n\n\"Yes, and he slept in the streets, and was an errand boy, and had no\nbreeches--in short, was poorer than a rat. And his brother, Don C\u00c3\u00a1rlos,\nlived in an old-clothes shop.\"\n\n\"Lord save us! What wonderful things we live to hear of! Well, I will\ngo and find an old-clothes shop where I can live.\"\n\n\"Well, and after that he became a barber to earn a living and be able\nto study.\"\n\n\"Ah...! Look here then; I have a great mind to go straight into a\nbarber's shop; I shall soon have to shave myself, and I am brisk and\nquick enough, thank God!--Only wait till I get to Madrid--shaving on\none hand and studying on the other, at the end of two months I will\nknow everything. Look here, it has just struck me that I am made to\nbe a doctor.--Yes, a doctor, what with feeling pulses and looking at\ntongues, that is the way to fill your pockets.\"\n\n\"Don Teodoro,\" Nela went on, \"had much less than you, for you will\nsoon have five _duros_, and with five _duros_, you can get almost\neverything. Don Teodoro and Don C\u00c3\u00a1rlos were like the birds that fly\nabout without house or home, all alone in the world. Well, by managing\nwell, they got learned. Don Teodoro studied dead bodies, and Don\nC\u00c3\u00a1rlos studied stones, and so they learnt to be gentlemen, and men of\nimportance. And that is why Don Teodoro is such a friend to the poor.\nCelipin, you should have seen him this evening when he jumped me upon\nhis shoulder--and then he gave me his cup of milk and looked at me as\nif I were a lady.\"\n\n\"All strong, active men, are the same,\" said Celipin sharply. \"You will\nsee how brave and fine I shall look when I wear a long cloak and a high\nhat; and I will wear those stockings on my hands--gloves they call\nthem, and never take them off excepting to feel a pulse--I will have a\nstick with a gilt knob and will wear such clothes! nothing shall ever\ntouch my skin but fine linen. Lord love you child! but you will laugh\nto see me!\"\n\n\"Do not be fancying that you can rise to such things at once--you who\nare as bare as an egg,\" said the girl. \"You must go step by step,\nlearning one thing to-day and another to-morrow. I advise you, before\nyou learn to cure sick folks, to learn to write; and so you ought, if\nit is only to leave a letter for your mother, asking her to forgive\nyou, and telling her that you are gone away from home to improve\nyourself, to make your way like Don Teodoro, and become a clever\ndoctor.\"\n\n\"Do not talk nonsense child. Who does not know that writing comes\nfirst? Only let me get a pen in my hand, and you will see me flourish\naway at the letters, and what beautiful fine strokes I will make\nup and down, like Don Francisco Pen\u00c3\u00a1guilas' name at the end of a\nletter.--Write? do not talk to me--in four days you will see what\nletters I will write.--Aye, you shall hear them read and see what\ngrand ideas I can hatch out, and set them down too, in such fine words\nas will make you all look foolish. Bless you child! but you have no\nnotion how clever I can be. I feel it inside my head here, buzzing\nand humming, _burumbum, burumbum,_ like the water in the boiler of\na steam-engine. It will not let me sleep, and I feel as if all the\nsciences in the world came rushing in and flapped blindly about like\nbats, wanting me to study them.--All the sciences--I must learn them\nall; I must not leave out one.--Well, you will see.\"\n\n\"But there must be a great many. Pablo Pen\u00c3\u00a1guilas knows them all, and\nhe told me that there are a great, great many, and that a man's whole\nlifetime is not enough to learn even one.\"\n\n\"Never do you believe him.--Well, you will see what I can do.\"\n\n\"And the best of all is what Don C\u00c3\u00a1rlos learns; why, only think, he\npicks up a stone and makes brass of it; indeed, they do say he makes\nsilver, and even gold. Learn that science, Celipillo.\"\n\n\"Do not you be mistaken, Nela; there is nothing like knowing how to\ntake a wrist and look at a tongue, and tell in a minute in what corner\nof a body the mischief lies. They say that Don Teodoro can take a man's\neye out and put him in a new one, that he can see with as well as if he\nhad been born with it. Just think what it is to see a man dying, and to\nmake him hale and sound again only by making him swallow half-a-dozen\nflies, let us say, stewed down on a Monday with hazel twigs gathered\nby a maid named Juana--I say that is something worth doing.--Yes, you\nshall see, you shall see what I will do. Doctor Celipin de Socartes. I\ntell you my fame will reach as far as Havana.\"\n\n\"Good, good!\" cried Nela, delighted. \"But remember, you must be a good\nboy, because the reason your parents have taught you nothing, is only\nbecause they were not clever enough, and so, as you are clever, you\nmust pray for them to the Holy Virgin, and not forget to send them\nsome of all the money you are going to get.\"\n\n\"I will be sure to send them some. You see, it is not because I owe\nthem any grudge that I am going to run away; and before long, very\nsoon, you will see a porter come up from the station so loaded with\nbig parcels that he can hardly stand, and what will they be? Why,\npetticoats for mother and the girls, and a tall hat for father--and\nyou--I will send you a pair of ear-rings.\"\n\n\"You are in a hurry with your presents,\" said Nela, smothering a laugh.\n\"Ear-rings for me!\"\n\n\"Stop; I have just got another idea. Shall I tell you? It is that you\nshould come with me; two of us together we should help each other to\nearn money and to learn. For you are clever too, I am too sharp not to\nsee that; and you can learn to be a lady as I can to be a gentleman. Oh\nLord! how I should laugh to see you playing the piano like Do\u00c3\u00b1a Sof\u00c3\u00ada.\"\n\n\"What a simpleton you are! Why I am no good for anything. If I went\nwith you, I should only be a clog and burden to you.\"\n\n\"But they say now that Don Pablo is going to be made to see, and when\nhe can see, you will have nothing to do in Socartes. What do you think\nof my plan? Why do not you answer?\"\n\nThere was a long pause, during which Nela made no answer. Celipin asked\nher again but got no answer.\n\n\"Go to sleep, Celipin,\" she said from the bottom of the baskets. \"I am\ndreadfully sleepy.\"\n\n\"If my brain will let me sleep, God save us!\"\n\nAnd a minute later he was dreaming of himself in the semblance of\nDon Teodoro Golfin, fixing new eyes in old sockets, splitting open\nfragments of rock, and snatching sick men from the jaws of death by\nmeans of doses of flies, stewed on a Monday, with hazel twigs picked\nby a maiden. He saw himself dressed with gorgeous garments, his hands\nencased in perfumed gloves, and riding in a coach drawn by swans\ninstead of horses, invited by Kings and courted by Queens, attending\nladies of distinction, lauded by nobles, and carried in triumph by all\nthe peoples of the earth.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nBETWEEN TWO BASKETS.\n\n\nNela had shut herself into her baskets to be alone; we will follow her,\nhowever, and look in upon her thoughts. But first we must give a little\nmore of her history.\n\nHaving entirely lacked all instruction in her infancy, having equally\nlacked all those soft endearments, which unfailingly open the mind\nto recognize certain truths, Marianela's powerful imagination had\nconceived a strange set of ideas, a wild and fanciful theogony, and\na highly whimsical scheme of cause and effect. Teodoro Golfin's\ncomparison of Nela's mind with the early stage of a primitive race was\na particularly happy one. In her, as in them, the fascination of the\nmarvellous was the predominant sense; she believed in supernatural\nagencies, apart from the one and supreme God, and saw in all natural\nobjects an abstract personality, by no means cut off from all\ncommunication with men. In spite of all this, however, Nela had some\nknowledge of the Gospel. It had never been taught her, to be sure, but\nshe had heard such things talked of. She saw that people went to a\nfunction they called the Mass, and she understood the idea of a sublime\nsacrifice; but beyond this her notions could not go. The contagion of\na common feeling had accustomed her mind to reverence the image of\nthe Crucified God; she knew it should be kissed, and she even could\nrepeat some prayers that she had learnt mechanically; she knew whatever\nshe wanted she could ask of God--but this was all. The absolute\nneglect in which her whole nature had been left until the time of her\nacquaintance with Pablo Pen\u00c3\u00a1guilas was the cause of this confusion,\nand her friendship with this strange being, who, shut up in darkness,\nnevertheless with his mind's eye boldly investigated all the problems\nof life, had come to her too late. Nela's system of philosophy, of her\nown fabrication, had already petrified--a strange compound of paganism\nand sentimentality. At the same time it must be said that Marianela,\nthough her spirit ranged so far outside the common atmosphere, was well\nendowed with good sense, and could form a sound judgment on the things\nof daily life, as has been seen in the advice she gave to Celipin.\nThis, no doubt, was due to the native soundness of her mind.\n\nThe strongest instinct of her nature was her love, nay her secret\npassion, for physical beauty wherever she saw it. Nothing could be\nmore natural than this impulse in a human soul growing up in total\nsolitude, so far as society and teaching were concerned, and in\nconstant intercourse, in close intimacy we may say, with Nature and all\nits sublime or gracious beauty--light, color, eloquent inarticulate\nvoices, and infinite variety of form. And Marianela's admiration had\nassumed the guise of worship; in obedience to a law, which also governs\nthe primitive race, she had personified all the beauty she saw around\nher and worshipped it in a single incarnation, ideal but human. This\ndivinity of her imagination she called the Virgin Mary, a conception\nshe had derived from the domain of religious thought, of which she knew\nso little. And the Virgin Mary would not have become her cherished\nideal, if she had not joined to her moral perfections all the physical\ngifts of beauty and grace; if her aspect had not been noble and\nattractive, at once human and divine; if it had not seemed to Nela the\nepitome in which were concentrated all the glory of light, the sober\npeace of darkness, the music of running waters, the grace and sweetness\nof flowers, the freshness of the dew, the low complaining of the wind,\nthe spotless purity of the mountain snow, the loving glances of the\nstars, and the solemn majesty of the clouds, as they ride across the\nvault of heaven.\n\nThe person of God himself she conceived of as terrible and austere,\ninspiring respect rather than love. All that was gracious was bestowed\nby the Virgin, and she was the giver of all that human creatures could\nask for. God frowned, while She smiled; God chastised, but She forgave;\nthis last notion was by no means a strange one. It is accepted with\nalmost absolute faith among the laboring classes of the rural parts of\nSpain. Nor is it at all uncommon, when we find a strong imagination\njoined to extreme ignorance, to meet with the fusion which existed\nin Nela's mind of all the beauties of Nature with the beautiful\npersonification which combines all the \u00c3\u00a6sthetic charms of the Christian\nideal. If the darkness in which Nela dwelt had only been more complete,\nif she had but been rather more destitute of religious notions, she\nwould have been an utter pagan and have worshipped the moon, the woods,\nthe rivers, fire and the sun. This was Nela as her life in Socartes\nhad made her, and such she remained till she was fifteen. After that,\nher comradeship with Pablo and her frequent talk with the lad, whose\nideas were so broad and so sound, had somewhat modified her tone of\nthought. But she still allowed supreme sovereignty to physical beauty;\nshe still superstitiously adored the Virgin as the embodiment of all\nthe loveliness of Nature, and, in a way, of all moral law; crowning her\nsystem with the most extraordinary ideas as to death and the life to\ncome.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCurling herself up in her basket, Marianela's reflections took this\nform:\n\n\"Holy Mother of God! Why--why did you not make me beautiful? Why did\nyou not look down on me as soon as I was born? For the more I look\nat myself, the uglier I seem to grow. Oh! why am I in this world at\nall? Of what good can I be? Who can care for me? One single soul, Lady\nMother, only one, and he only because he cannot see me. What is to\nbecome of me when he sees me and casts me off? for it is impossible\nthat he should ever love me when he sees my miserable little body, my\nfreckled face, my ugly mouth, my sharp nose, my dirty brown skin--all\nmy hideous little self--of no good to any one but to kick perhaps. What\nis that? Only Nela--nothing at all. She is of no use to any one but the\nblind boy. If his eyes are opened, if he turns and looks at me, I shall\ndrop down dead.\n\n\"He is the only being to whom 'Nela' is anything more important than\nthe cats and the birds. He loves me. Loves me as lovers love their\nsweet-hearts, as God intends human beings to love each other.--Oh Lady\nMother! now that you are going to work a miracle and let him see, make\nme beautiful or strike me dead, for I shall not be wanted any more in\nthis world. I am good for nothing and ever shall be, excepting to one\nperson. Am I sorry then that he should be able to see?--No, no, not\nthat, no. I want him to see; I would give my own eyes for him to see\nwith his; I would give my life. I hope Don Teodoro can work the miracle\nas they say. Blessings on all wise men! What I do not want is that my\nmaster should ever see me. Before I will let him see me, oh Mother! I\nwill bury myself alive, I will throw myself into the river.--Yes, the\nearth shall cover my ugliness. I ought never to have been born.\"\n\nShe writhed in her narrow basket, and then she went on:\n\n\"All my heart and thought are for him. That poor, blind man, who has\ntaken it into his head to be fond of me--he is the first being in\nthe world to me next to the Virgin Mary. Oh! If only I were tall and\nhandsome; if I had the figure, and the face, and the color--above\nall, the color--of other girls! If I could only make a lady of myself\nand dress myself up.--And then my greatest joy would be to think that\nhis eyes liked to look at me. If I were like other girls, even like\nMariuca--how soon I would find a way of getting taught and being made\na lady of. Oh Mother Mary, Queen of the world! The only creature that\nloves me, I am going to lose: he will leave me. Why did you ever let\nhim love me, and let me love him? It ought not--never--to have been.\"\n\nThe tears poured down her cheeks; she folded her arms and turned over,\nand even when half asleep she still was speaking to herself:\n\n\"Oh, how much I love you, child of my soul! Love me too, love me very\nmuch. It is Nela who is no good to any one.--Love me very much. Let me\ngive you a kiss--here on your head.--But do not open your eyes, do not\nlook at me. Shut them--so.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nHOW THE VIRGIN MARY APPEARED TO NELA.\n\n\nThe thoughts which fade and fly as sleep overcomes us, very commonly\nlurk in some hole or corner ready to take us by storm again as soon\nas we wake. Thus it was that Mariquilla, who, having fallen asleep\nwith her head full of strange fancies of the Virgin, of the blind lad,\nand of her own ugliness which, she longed so wildly to see changed\ninto wonderful loveliness, woke with the same ideas in her brain when\nSe\u00c3\u00b1ana's call roused her in her basket. As soon as her eyes were open,\nNela put up her usual prayer to the Virgin Mother--a sort of Litany,\ncompounded of the ordinary Litany to the Virgin and of certain clauses\nof her own devising, and forming altogether an address which would look\nstrange enough if it were written down. Among other things, Nela's\nprayer said:\n\n\"Thou didst appear to me in my dreams last night, oh Lady! and promise\nto comfort me to-day. Now I am awake, and still I feel as if I saw thy\nface just before me, and far lovelier than all the grand and lovely\nthings in the world.\" And as she spoke she turned and gazed round her.\nNoticing in herself the utter vagueness with which she did so, she\nthought to herself: \"Something has come over me.\"\n\n\"What is the matter, Nela?\" asked Se\u00c3\u00b1ana, seeing the girl stand with\nher eyes wide open and fixed on a spot in space. \"Do you see a vision,\nsimpleton?\"\n\nBut Nela did not answer, her mind was absorbed in self contemplation.\n\n\"What ails me?\" she asked herself. \"It cannot be anything evil, or\nwicked, for I do not feel the black ugly figure of a devil inside me,\nbut something heavenly: a beautiful face, a smile and a look which--if\nI am in my right mind--are those of the Virgin Mary herself. Oh Lady\nMother! Can it be true that thou wilt give me comfort to-day? And\nhow?--By giving me what I prayed for last night?\"\n\n\"Now then, brat!\" screamed Se\u00c3\u00b1ana in her harsh tones, like a cracked\nbell. \"Go and wash your ugly little snout.\"\n\nNela went at once. Her spirit had felt a shock as of a sudden gleam\nof great hope. She looked at herself in the quivering surface of the\nwater, and her heart shrank within her.\n\n\"No difference,\" she muttered. \"As ugly as ever; the same child's face\nwith a woman's years and a woman's heart!\"\n\nBut after washing herself she went through the same experience as\nbefore--a sort of agony of anticipation, and, in spite of her narrow\nvocabulary, Nela could classify these feelings as presentiments.\n\n\"Pablo and I,\" said she to herself, \"have often talked of how we feel\nwhen something sad or something pleasant is going to happen. Pablo told\nme that just before an earthquake people have strange sensations; there\nis something in the air, and the beasts feel it too. Is there going to\nbe an earthquake, I wonder?\" And she knelt down and felt the ground\nwith her hand.\n\n\"I cannot tell. But something is going to happen, and I cannot doubt\nthat it will be something good.--The Virgin told me last night that\nto-day she would comfort me. What has come over me? The Heavenly Queen\nseems to be close to me. I cannot see her, but I feel her--before\nme--behind me....\"\n\nShe went close by the machines for washing the ore towards the inclined\nplane, looking about her with eager eyes. There was nothing to be seen\nbut the arms and wheels of iron, toiling with fiendish shrieks amid the\nhideous confusion of whirling cylinders, lashing the water to powder,\nas it seemed, and breathing out dust and smoke. Presently, when she\nhad gone some little distance, she stopped; putting her hand to her\nforehead, and fixing her eyes on the ground in all the bewilderment of\ndoubt: \"The question is,\" said she to herself, \"am I happy or am I sad?\"\n\nShe looked up at the sky, half wondering to see it appear the same as\non other days--and it was a lovely day--and then she walked on faster,\nto reach Aldeacorba as soon as possible. Instead of going through\nthe gallery in the mines and up the wooden steps, she kept above the\nhollow way, along by the gutter that bordered the inclined tram-way,\nintending to get out into the fields, and walk straight on by the level\nroad to the village. This way was much the prettiest, and she almost\nalways chose it, for that reason. It went by lanes full of sweet and\ngay flowers, where crowds of bees and butterflies fluttered and sipped;\nthere were thickets of bramble loaded with the black fruit beloved\nof children; clumps of cherry-trees overgrown with honeysuckles, and\nenormous ilex, tall, spreading, densely shady, and proud, it would\nseem, of their wide, black shadows.\n\nHere Nela went more slowly, uneasy in herself, puzzled at her own\nsensations, and at the anxious excitement that stirred in her. Her\nrapid fancy presently hit upon a formula to express the state of her\nfeelings, and remembering having heard it said of such and such a one,\n\"the devil is in him,\" she said to herself: \"The angels are in me,\nthe Virgin Mary is with me this day. What I feel are the wings of her\nangels fluttering inside me. Thou art near me, Lady Mother, I see you\nand yet I do not see you--as we see with our eyes shut.\"\n\nShe shut her eyes, and then she opened them again. She had just passed\na grove of trees and turned an angle of the road to go to a place where\nshe knew of a bramble copse, the greenest, prettiest, and most fruitful\nin all the neighborhood. There were luxuriant ferns too, honeysuckle,\nwild vine, and other climbing plants, all clinging and tangled together\nin mutual dependence.\n\nNela heard a rustle in the brushwood close to her, and turning round\nshe saw--Merciful Heaven! There, in a frame of greenery, stood the\nImmaculate Virgin herself--the face, the eyes, which in their gaze\nseemed to have all the calm beauty of the sky. Nela stood silent,\npetrified; with a feeling at once of devotion and terror. She could\nnot stir, nor cry out, nor hardly breathe, nor take her eyes off this\nbeatific vision.\n\nIt stood among the verdure, the face and figure to the waist perfectly\ndisplayed. This was--yes, certainly--the very presence of the Maiden\nof Nazareth, whose moral loveliness every painter has endeavored to\nexpress by means of physical beauty, from St. Luke downwards through\neighteen centuries. Have not men indeed seen that sacred form with\nthe eyes of sense--with the eyes of Albert D\u00c3\u00bcrer--of Rafael--of Van\nEyck--of Bartolom\u00c3\u00a9 Murillo? It was under the Rafaelesque aspect that\nshe now appeared to Nela, the most realistic of all, if realism can\nmean the nearest approach of perfect human beauty to an artistic\nrepresentation of divine goodness. The oval of her face was less\nnarrow than the Seville painter's type, and had more of the tender\nroundness of the Italian form. Her eyes, which were finely shaped, were\ngentleness itself, with a softness and sweetness as far removed from\nindifference, as from the lightning glow of the eyes of Andalucia; the\nbrows that overarched them were delicately curved, and as fine as if\nthey had been traced with a paint-brush. Her forehead was unshadowed\nby any cloud of weariness or sadness, and her lips, which were rather\nfull, parted in a smile that revealed the pearliest teeth that ever bit\ninto the apples of Paradise. And so, without in the least intending\nit, I have compared her to our Mother Eve--wide as the distance is\nbetween her who yielded to the Serpent and her who set her heel on\nhis head; but the beauty of a lovely girl is enough to betray us into\nsuch unlucky blunders. To put a finishing touch to this imperfect\ndescription of the divine vision which had so utterly dismayed poor\nMarianela, it must be said that her complexion was of that faded rose\ncolor, or warm clear brown which gives an enchanting glow to the faces\nof those glorious pictures which successive generations, of believers\nand heretics alike, have worshipped in ecstasy.\n\nAfter the first shock of surprise was over, the first thing that Nela\nobserved, and which confused her judgment greatly, was that the fair\nVirgin wore a blue ribbon round her throat, a detail she had never\nbefore seen in any picture or dream of the Virgin Mary; then she\nperceived that her shoulders and bosom were covered by a dress in every\nrespect similar to that worn by other ladies; but the thing which\npuzzled and disturbed her most was that the fair creature was picking\nblackberries--and eating them.\n\nShe was beginning to draw accurate inferences from this remarkable\nbehavior, when she heard a loud man's voice calling:\n\n\"Florentina, Florentina!\"\n\n\"I am here, Papa--here, eating blackberries.\"\n\n\"Naughty child--how can you like to eat blackberries? What next whim\nwill you take? Have I not told you that they are only fit for the poor\nchildren that run about the country, and not for a young lady who has\nbeen properly brought up.--Do you hear? And lived in good society.\"\n\nNela saw the speaker come towards them. He was a man of advanced middle\nage and medium height, rotund, and with a ruddy countenance that seemed\nto radiate satisfaction as the sun radiates light. His legs were thin,\nhis nose was large, and his person decorated with a variety of splendid\nobjects, among which a thick watch-chain was conspicuous, while he wore\na broad-brimmed hat of fine black felt.\n\n\"Come, come, child,\" said Don Manuel Pen\u00c3\u00a1guilas, for he it was,\n\"respectable people do not eat blackberries nor skip and jump about\nlike that. There, you have torn your dress--I do not care about the\ndress, for I can buy you another as I bought you that--I only speak\nbecause the people here who see you might think you had no dress but\nthe one you have on.\"\n\nNela, who by this time understood the case, looked at the young lady's\ndress. It was good and handsome, but her face betrayed unmistakably\nthe transition--and a rapid one--from the position of a rich peasant's\ndaughter to that of a fine lady. Every detail of her attire, from her\nshoes to her comb, stamped her as the daughter of the people in holiday\nclothes. But the girl's natural grace and beauty were so transcendent,\nthat no deficiency, as measured by any conventional standard of\nelegance, could dim them. It was not to be denied, however, that her\nwhole individuality cried out for a short peasant's skirt, hair dressed\nin plaits with a bunch of poppies to adorn it with affected simplicity,\na sleeveless bodice, a coral necklace--in short, the costume which\ngood taste and the nature of things would have suggested, without any\nadmixture of the devices of the fine lady.\n\nAs the young girl came out from among the brambles, Don Manuel\nperceived Nela, at the moment when she had just recovered from her\ndelusion, and he called out as he turned to her:\n\n\"Hallo! and who are you? Why, look Florentina, it is Nela, the little\nbody that waits upon your cousin. You remember--I spoke of her to you?\nAnd how are you now-a-days?\"\n\n\"Very well, Se\u00c3\u00b1or Don Manuel. And you.--How are you, Se\u00c3\u00b1or?\" asked\nMariquilla without taking her eyes off Florentina.\n\n\"Perfectly well--as you see. This is my daughter.--Well, what do you\nthink of her?\"\n\nFlorentina had just set out on a butterfly chase.\n\n\"My dear child, where are you going? What do you want now?\" said the\nfather, visibly annoyed. \"Now do you think it looks well that you\nshould be running after an insect like some poor child? You must not be\nso wild, my child. Young ladies brought up in good society do not do\nsuch things--never do such things....\"\n\nIt was a trick with Don Manuel to repeat the last clause of his\nsentences to give them emphasis.\n\n\"Ah! do not be cross, Papa,\" said the girl, returning from her\nfruitless chase to shelter herself under the protecting brim of the\npaternal hat. \"You know how much I love the country and that I am half\ncrazy when I see trees and flowers and meadows. And in that dismal town\nof Camp\u00c3\u00b3 I never see anything of the kind....\"\n\n\"Oh! but you must not say anything against Santa Irene de Camp\u00c3\u00b3; it is\na famous town where you find every comfort and convenience, and a great\ndeal of very distinguished society. It stands in the foremost ranks\nof civilization--yes, of civilization. You can admire the beauties\nof Nature while you walk properly by my side. I admire them too, but\nwithout cutting capers or turning somersaults. You can tell when a\nyoung person has moved in good society only by her way of walking and\nlooking at the scene around her. This way of calling out at every\nminute: Ah! Oh! Look there, Papa!--How pretty!--and pointing to a fern,\nperhaps, or an oak-tree, or a rock--a thorn-bush even, a brook--is not\nat all in good taste--people will think you have lived in a desert. So\ncome and walk by me.--Nela will show us the way home, for, to tell you\nthe truth, I do not know where we are.\"\n\n\"If we turn to the left, past that old house,\" said Nela readily, \"we\nshall be there directly.--But here comes Don Francisco.\"\n\nAnd, in fact, Don Francisco came on towards them, calling out: \"The\nchocolate is getting cold.\"\n\n\"What would you have my good fellow.--This child was so anxious\nto scamper across the country that she would not wait, so we went\nspringing from bush to bush like goats--just like goats from bush to\nbush.\"\n\n\"Well come in now, come home. Nela do you come too, and have some\nchocolate,\" said Pen\u00c3\u00a1guilas, laying a hand on the child's head. \"Well,\nand what do you think of my niece? Is not she pretty?--Florentina, when\nyou have had your chocolate, Nela will take you and Pablo for a walk,\nand you will see all the beauties of the neighborhood--the mines, the\nwood, the river....\"\n\nFlorentina sent a kind glance to the hapless little creature who, as\nshe ran by her side, seemed to have been formed by Nature expressly as\na foil and contrast to one of the loveliest and most perfect of her\ncreations.\n\nWhen they reached the house the table was ready laid with the chocolate\npots full of the thick and nutritious beverage, and a small hillock of\nslices of bread. There too were the _mantequilla_ (a sort of cake),\nduly decked with fern leaves, and no lack of other household dainties.\nThe bright glasses of crystal water reflected and magnified all these\ngastronomical objects.\n\n\"Here we have something to support life,\" said Don Francisco, seating\nhimself.\n\n\"And you will have some chocolate too, Nela,\" said Pablo. He had\nhardly spoken when Florentina had offered her the chocolate pot, and\neverything that was on the table was pressed on her acceptance. She\nrefused at first, but the Se\u00c3\u00b1orita insisted with so much kindness\nand gentle grace, that she had at last no choice. Don Manuel cast\nside glances at his daughter, not feeling perfectly satisfied with\nher advance in the arts and manners of the best society, since one of\nthe most important points, in his estimation, consisted in a delicate\nappreciation of the shades of civility due to different people\naccording to their rank and position, \"showing to each neither more nor\nless than was appropriate by the rules of social distinction; since, by\nthis means, each would keep his place, while true dignity would hold\nits own and observe that happy medium of courtesy, which was not too\nhaughty or reserved to the rich, nor too humble and condescending to\nthe poor--not too humble to the poor.\"\n\nWhen they had done breakfast, Don Francisco said:\n\n\"Now, you children, go out for a walk. Pablo, this is the last day that\nDon Teodoro will allow you to walk out. You three go and have a run,\nwhile my brother and I go over the farm.--Fly away birds!\"\n\nThere was no need to speak twice; the beauty of the day was invitation\nenough, and the three young people set out for the fields.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nTHE THREE CHILDREN.\n\n\nThe town-bred damsel thoroughly enjoyed the open and smiling meadows\nwithout the trammels of her father's social dogmas, and as soon as they\nwere at some little distance from the house she took to running and\nleaping, swinging now and then from the branches of the trees as she\npassed them. She pinched the blackberries with the tips of her fingers,\nand when she thought them ripe she would pick three, one for each mouth.\n\n\"This is for you, cousin,\" she said, putting it to his lips, \"and this\nis for you, Nela, and this little one is for me.\"\n\nThen as the birds flew across she could not resist the temptation to\nwave her arms as if she too could fly. \"Where are the little rascals\noff to I wonder?\" she said. She must need gather a branch from every\noak-tree and split open the acorns to see what was in them, then she\nbit into one, and finding it bitter, tossed it away. No botanist, mad\non Latin names and classification, could have been so eager to collect\nall the flowers that grew under her feet, as if to bid her welcome to\ntheir native soil, and she gathered enough in half an hour to adorn\nevery button-hole in her cousin's cloak, to make a garland for Nela's\nhair, and then one for her own.\n\n\"My cousin would like to see the mines,\" said Pablo. \"Do not you think\nwe might go down?\"\n\n\"Yes, let us go down--this way, Se\u00c3\u00b1orita.\"\n\n\"Oh! but I do not like to go through tunnels, they frighten me\ndreadfully. I really cannot go through a tunnel ...\" said Florentina,\nfollowing them. \"Cousin, do you and Nela walk about here often? Oh! but\nthis is beautiful--I could live here all my life. Blessings on the man\nwho is going to give you the power of enjoying this lovely world!\"\n\n\"God grant it! And it will all look much more lovely to me who have\nnever seen it, than to you who are tired of it all. But do not suppose,\nFlorentina, that I do not understand what beauty is; I can feel it in\nmy own fashion, and my fancy almost, almost makes up for my want of\nsight.\"\n\n\"That is strange.--But say what you will,\" replied Florentina, \"we will\nhave some good fun when you can see.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" said the blind boy, \"that I may not find much to say that day.\"\n\nNela meanwhile was absolutely speechless.\n\nWhen they had reached the crater of La Terrible, Florentina was greatly\nstruck by the grand spectacle of the limestone rocks, left on the\nground after the ore had been extracted. She compared them to huge\nmasses of sugar loaves piled one on another; then, after looking a\nsecond time, she said they were like gigantic dogs and cats turned to\nstone at the critical moment of a furious fight.\n\n\"Let us sit down on this slope,\" she said, \"and we shall see the trains\ngo by with the mineral, and besides we can see these stones which are\nvery curious. That large rock in the middle has a wide mouth--do you\nsee, Nela?--and out of the mouth sticks a toothpick; it is a tree\nthat has grown all alone there. It looks as if it were laughing at\nus, for it has eyes too; and there, farther on, is one with a hump,\nanother smoking a pipe, and two pulling each other's hair; there is\none yawning, another asleep and drunk, and another head downwards\nsupporting a cathedral on his feet; then there is one playing the\nguitar, with a dog's head and coffee-pot on it like a cap.\"\n\n\"What you are saying,\" observed the blind man, \"proves to me how\ndifferently things are seen by different eyes, and that the precious\ngift of sight sometimes travesties them strangely, changing their\nnatural form into something whimsical and unreal; for, after all, what\nyou see before you are neither cats nor men, toothpicks, cathedrals,\nnor coffee-pots, but merely limestone rocks and masses of calcareous\nstone stained with oxide of iron. And it is your eye that burlesques so\nsimple a fact.\"\n\n\"You are right, cousin; and for that very reason I say it is our\nimagination that sees, and not our eyes. Nevertheless our sight is\nuseful--to inform us, for instance, of certain things which poor people\nhave not got and which we who are rich can give them.\" And as she spoke\nshe touched Nela's dress.\n\n\"Why does not this dear little Nela wear better clothes?\" she went on.\n\"I have a number of frocks and I will give her one--and a new one too,\ninto the bargain.\" Marianela, covered with blushes and confusion, did\nnot raise her eyes.\n\n\"That is a thing I can never understand: why some have so much and\nothers so little. I get quite angry with Papa when I hear him abusing\nthose who wish that everything should be divided so that all should\nhave an equal share. What do they call those people, Pablo?\"\n\n\"Socialists--communists ...\" said the lad smiling.\n\n\"Well, those are the people for me. I vote for a redistribution, so\nthat the rich should give the poor all they have too much of. Why\nshould this orphan go barefoot when I wear shoes? Even wicked people\nought not to be destitute, much less good ones. Now, I know that Nela\nis very good, you told me so last evening, and your father said so too.\nAnd she has no parents, no one to care for her. How is it that there\nare so many, many, miserable creatures in the world? My bread burns my\nmouth when I remember how many there are who have none at all. Poor\nlittle Nela! such a good child, and so forlorn! It seems impossible\nthat to this day you should have lived without being loved, without\nany one to give you a kiss nor to cuddle and pet you as we pet little\nchildren--my heart aches to think of it.\"\n\nMarianela was as completely petrified with astonishment as at the first\nsight of the apparition. Then she had seen the Virgin Mary, now she\nheard her very words.\n\n\"Listen, little one,\" the Holy Maiden went on, \"and you, Pablo, listen\ntoo. I must help and comfort Nela--not as we help the beggars by the\nroad, but as we try to help a brother whom we find unexpectedly. Did\nyou not tell me that she has been your companion, your _lazarillo_,\nyour guide through the darkness? That you saw with her eyes and trod\nin her steps? Nela is mine as much as yours then, and I shall take\ncharge of her. I will dress her and give her everything she can want\nto live decently, and teach her a hundred things to make her useful in\nthe house. Papa told me that perhaps I might always have to live here;\nand, if so, Nela will live with me; with me she will learn to read,\nto say her prayers, to sew and to cook; she will learn so many things\nthat she will know as much as I do. What do you think of my plan? She\nwill soon be nothing short of a young lady. My father will not prevent\nme I know. Indeed, last evening he said to me: 'Florentinilla perhaps,\nperhaps, before long I shall not rule you any longer; you may have to\nobey another master....' Well, be that as it may, Nela shall be my\nfriend. Will you love me? dearly? You have lived so neglected--as the\nwild flowers grow in the fields--that you do not even know how to say\nthank you--but never mind I will teach you; oh! I have to teach you so\nmany things.\"\n\nMarianela, who had been making stupendous efforts not to cry as she\nlistened to these splendid promises, could at last hold in no longer\nand, after screwing up her face for a minute, burst into tears. The\nblind boy sat silent, lost in thought.\n\n\"Florentina,\" he said presently, \"you speak and think differently from\nmost other people. Your goodness is as infinite and as enthusiastic as\nthat which has filled the world with martyrs and peopled heaven with\nsaints.\"\n\n\"What an extravagant way of putting it!\" said the girl laughing, and\nshe rose to gather a flower that had attracted her attention at some\nlittle distance.\n\n\"Is she gone?\" asked Pablo.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Nela, gulping down her tears.\n\n\"Do you know?\" said Pablo, \"I fancy my cousin must be rather pretty.\nWhen she arrived last evening I felt the greatest antipathy towards\nher; I cannot tell you what a dislike I took to her. But to-day I fancy\nI can see her, and that she must be rather pretty.\"\n\nNela began to cry again.\n\n\"She is like an angel!\" she said with a flood of tears. \"She looks as\nif she had just come straight from Heaven. Body and soul she is exactly\nlike the Holy Virgin Mary.\"\n\n\"Oh! do not exaggerate,\" said Pablo uneasily. \"She cannot be so lovely\nas you say. Do not imagine that because I have no eyes I cannot feel\nwho is beautiful and who is not.\"\n\n\"No, no, you cannot feel it, you do not understand.--Oh! you are\nmistaken, quite mistaken.\"\n\n\"No, no. She cannot be so beautiful,\" the blind lad insisted, turning\nvery pale as he spoke. \"Nela, darling of my heart, do you know what my\nfather told me? That if I recover my sight I am to marry Florentina.\"\n\nNela could not answer; her tears continued to flow in silence, pouring\ndown her burning cheeks and dropping on her hands. But not even the\nbitterest tears could give expression or relief to her intense grief.\nIt was immeasurable, infinite, that was all she knew.\n\n\"I know why you are crying so much,\" the blind youth said holding\nher hands very tightly in his own. \"But my father will not insist on\nmaking me marry against my will. For me there is no wife in the world\nbut you. When my eyes can see, they will care for no beauty but your\nheavenly face; all others will be but shades, too remote and dim to\nattract my gaze. Oh God! what is a human face like? How does the soul\nstand revealed in flesh? If light cannot avail to give another aspect\nto thought and fancy, of what use is it at all? That which we conceive\nof and that which is--are they not one and the same thing? Are not the\nidea and the form the same to each other as fire and heat? Can they be\nseparated? And can you cease to be the fairest in the world to me, the\nsweetest and best beloved, when I am lord of the vast domain of the\nvisible?\"\n\nFlorentina now rejoined them, and they talked as they went home; but\nnothing more was said of sufficient interest to be set down here.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nTHE VOW.\n\n\nNothing of importance occurred on the two following days, but then\nthere came one on which the deed was done, the wonderful, crowning,\nfateful deed. Teodoro Golfin, in whose hands the surgeon's knife was\nas the chisel of a Genius, had attempted to amend one of Nature's most\ndelicate works. Unflinching and calm he took possession, as it were, in\nvirtue of his science and experience, of the marvellous speck in which\nthe glorious scheme of the Universe is epitomized and concentrated. The\ntask before him was nothing less than to stand face to face with the\nmystery of Life; to investigate and discover the causes which hindered\na living eye from taking cognizance of things visible. For this a firm\nsoul was needed and a tender hand. The delicate tissue of the cornea\nmust be divided, the crystalline lens removed, carefully avoiding the\nhyaloid membrane and the vitreous humor; the dimensions of the pupil\nmust be increased by an incision, and the condition of the inner\nchamber of the eye ascertained by induction or by examination.\n\nFew words were spoken after this daring expedition into a microcosm--an\nenterprise not less bold than the attempt to measure the distance\nbetween the stars, or to gauge the infinite realms of space. Those\nwho were present sat in silent suspense, as they might await the\nresurrection of a dead man or the creation of a new world. Golfin said\nnothing definite either:\n\n\"Iris contractile,\" he muttered. \"Retina sensitive.... Nerves living\nand sound....\" And yet the function, the fact, the act of seeing--where\nwas that?\n\n\"Time will show,\" said Don Teodoro, as he carefully adjusted the\nbandages. \"Patience.\"\n\nAnd his leonine face expressed neither disappointment nor triumph,\nneither hope nor doubt. Science had done all she could; it was almost\nlike an act of creation, like many others she has enabled us to\nperform in this nineteenth century. Nature, thus boldly defied and\nresenting such an intrusion on her secrets, held her peace.\n\nThe patient was strictly forbidden to see any one but his father,\nwho waited on him; no one else was admitted. Nela went several times\nto enquire for the invalid; but she never crossed the threshold, she\nwaited outside till Don Manuel should come out, or his daughter, or\nsome member of the household. The young lady, after giving her the\nfullest information and painting in lively colors the anxiety they all\nfelt, would go out to walk with her. One day Florentina insisted that\nNela should show her where she lived, and they went down to Centeno's\nhovel; the squalid interior horrified and disgusted Florentina; above\nall, the baskets which served as the orphan's bed.\n\n\"Well, Nela will very soon come to live with me,\" said Florentina,\ngetting out of the stuffy hole as fast as she could, \"and then she will\nhave a bedroom just like mine, and will dress and feed as I do.\"\n\nDame Centeno and her two girls stood open-mouthed with astonishment at\nthis speech. They began to think that the hapless and neglected orphan\nmust have found her father in some Prince or King, as the orphans do in\nthe tales.\n\nWhen they had left the house behind them Florentina said to her\ncompanion: \"Pray to God day and night that He may grant my dear cousin\nthe blessing which we all enjoy and which He has denied to him. What an\nanxious state we live in! If he gains his sight a thousand delightful\nthings will follow and many difficulties will be removed. I have made a\nsolemn vow to the Virgin; I have promised that if she grants my cousin\nhis sight I will take under my care the very poorest creature I can\nfind, and give her all that can make her entirely forget her poverty,\nmaking her my own equal in every respect, as happy and as comfortable\nas I am. And it is not enough merely to give her clothes, or set her\ndown to a table with plenty of soup and meat. No, there is another\ncharity which is worth more than all the broken food and frippery in\nthe world--kindness, respect, consideration, and a name. I will give\nher these too, and teach her to respect herself. I have found the\nperson I want, Mar\u00c3\u00ada--it is you. I have promised the Holy Virgin from\nthe bottom of my soul that if she will bestow the gift of sight on my\ncousin, you shall be my sister. You shall be the same as myself, in my\nhouse, exactly like my sister.\" As she spoke Nela's Virgin clasped the\ngirl in her arms and kissed her on the forehead.\n\nIt is impossible to give any idea of the poor little vagabond's\nfeelings in this crowning hour of her life. An instinctive dread kept\nher away from the house at Aldeacorba, a dread that was dimly mixed up\nwith the personality of her young benefactress, like the figures we see\nin a nightmare; while, at the same time, she felt tender admiration and\nreverence for her. Now and again, in her innocent bewilderment, she\nfancied it must be the Virgin Mary in her actual presence; in no other\nway could she conceive of the kind-heartedness which smiled upon her,\nlike the realms of Paradise, from the open soul of Florentina, with\nits purity, tenderness, gentleness, and gracious consolations. Nela's\nhonest instinct made her feel and understand at once that she could not\nhate her self-constituted sister. Hate her! How could she? She felt\nshe must love her with all the strength of her soul. Her aversion and\nrepulsion sank to the bottom like a sediment after fermentation, and\nthere decomposed and vanished, their elements recombining to intensify\nthe admiration and respect she felt for her benefactress. Still, though\nthe feeling had disappeared, the cause remained--the sentiment which,\nas it could no longer flourish singly in her soul, with that masterful\nexclusiveness which is characteristic of such passions, revenged\nitself by producing that utter dejection which is the very demon of\nmelancholy.\n\nAt Centeno's they remarked that Nela did not eat, that she seemed\nwearier than usual, that for long intervals she sat as silent and\nmotionless as a statue, and that she sang no longer, day or night. Her\nincapacity for exertion had become absolute helplessness, and Tanasio,\nhaving sent her to buy him some tobacco, she sat down in the road and\nremained there for the rest of the day.\n\nOne morning, just a week after the operation had been performed, she\nwent up to the engineer's house, and Sof\u00c3\u00ada said to her: \"A gift for\ngood news Nela! Have you heard? They have taken off the bandages\nto-day, and they say he can see, that he will see quite well. Ulysses,\nthe foreman of the works, has just been to tell us. Teodoro has not\nbeen here, but my husband has gone to Aldeacorba--we shall know the\ntruth very soon.\"\n\nNela, as she heard it, felt more dead than alive, and crossing her\nhands she exclaimed: \"Blessed be the Holy Virgin who has worked this\nwonder!--She, she alone has done it.\"\n\n\"You are glad little one?--No wonder, for now Se\u00c3\u00b1orita Florentina\nwill keep her promise,\" said Sof\u00c3\u00ada in a bantering tone. \"Allow me to\ncongratulate you, Se\u00c3\u00b1orita Do\u00c3\u00b1a Nela.--Why it is like a lottery! What\na big prize, Nelilla! And yet you may not be grateful--no, you will\nnot. I never yet knew any poor who were grateful. They are all proud,\nand the more you give them the more they ask.--Well, it is a settled\nthing that Pablo is to marry his cousin, and it is a very good match;\nthey are a handsome pair and she seems no fool--and she has a sweet\npretty face; what a pity to spoil such a face and figure by dressing so\nvillanously! No, no, if I want to dress well I will not apply to the\ndressmaker at Santa Irene de Camp\u00c3\u00b3.\"\n\nAs she spoke Don C\u00c3\u00a1rlos came in; he was radiant with satisfaction and\ndelight.\n\n\"A complete success!\" he shouted as he reached the door. \"Next to God\nstands my brother Teodoro!\"\n\n\"It is quite certain?\"\n\n\"As sure as daylight--I never believed it could be.--And what a\ntriumph, Sof\u00c3\u00ada! What a triumph! It is my greatest pride and happiness\nto be my brother's brother. He is the king of men.--Yes, as I say:\nFirst God, and then Teodoro!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nA FUGITIVE.\n\n\nThe wonderful good news flew through Socartes. Nothing else was talked\nof in the smelting-houses, in the workshops, in the washing-mills, on\nthe tram-way, in the deepest diggings, and on the top of the hill,\nin the bowels of the earth or the open light of heaven. Various\ninteresting commentaries were added: that in Aldeacorba it was thought\nfor a moment that Don Francisco was out of his wits with joy; that Don\nManuel meant to celebrate the happy event by giving a grand banquet to\nall the hands employed in the mines; and, finally, that Don Teodoro\nwas a great man, whom all blind men, present or to come, might indeed\nesteem, \"as the apple of their eye.\"\n\nNela could not venture to go to the house at Aldeacorba. A mysterious\nforce seemed to hold her back. She wandered all day round and about the\nmines, gazing from afar at the Pen\u00c3\u00a1guilas' house, which in her eyes,\nlooked transformed. Her spirit was full of a strange compound of the\nsincerest joy and an overwhelming shamefacedness, of noble devotion and\nwith it the unendurable aching, so to speak, of an intensely sensitive\nself-consciousness.\n\nShe found some surcease from the turmoil of her brain in that motherly\nsolitude which had contributed so largely to the formation of her\ncharacter, and in dreaming over the beauty of Nature, which always\nlifted her soul to closer communion with the Divinity. The clouds in\nthe sky and the flowers of the field affected her mind as others are\naffected by the pomp of altars, the eloquence of preachers and the\nstudy of the meditations of the mystics. In the solitude of the open\ncountry she thought and said a thousand things that she never dreamed\nwere aspirations and prayers. She looked towards Aldeacorba, and said\nto herself:\n\n\"I will never go there again.--All is over and done.--Of what use can I\nbe now?\"\n\nWith all her ignorance she understood that the struggle in her soul\narose from her incapacity to hate any one; on the contrary, she\nwas constrained to love her friend and her enemy alike, and just\nas thistles turned into flowers under the miraculous touch of some\nChristian martyr, Nela perceived that her jealousy and aversion were\ngraciously blossoming into admiration and gratitude. That which could\nundergo no change was the feeling we have described as self-conscious\nshame, and which urged her to keep herself quite apart from any events\nwhich might henceforth occur in Aldeacorba. It was a special aspect of\nthe sentiment which in civilized and educated persons is called _amour\npropre_, which includes in itself the capacity for self-depreciation.\nThe connection, however, between her feeling and that which has so\nlarge a share in the actions of cultivated persons, consisted in the\nfact that both were founded on a punctilious sense of dignity. If\nMarianela could have expressed herself in their language she would have\nsaid:\n\n\"My dignity will not allow me to submit to the horrible degradation\nyou would put upon me. It is God's will that I should endure this\nhumiliation--so be it; but I cannot stand by and see myself deposed and\ndiscrowned. May his blessings fall on the head of her who, by a law of\nnature, must fill the place I once occupied--but I have not the courage\nto put her there with my own hands.\"\n\nBut not being able to utter her pain in these words, she could only\nsay: \"I will never go to Aldeacorba again--I will never let him see me.\nI will run away with Celipin, or I will go to my mother. I am of no use\nnow to any one.\"\n\nStill, even while she said this, it struck her as very sad that she\nshould have to give up the divine protection of that Heavenly Maiden\nwho had appeared to her in the darkest hour of her life, and cast her\nsheltering mantle over her! To think that after seeing the vision\nrealized which had so often appeared to her in dreams of thrilling\nbeatitude, she must renounce it--to have heard herself called by a\ngentle voice, that offered her a sister's love, a happy home, position,\na name, and a luxurious existence--and then be unable to obey the\ninvitation with joy, alacrity and thankfulness--to reject the hand\nwhich would snatch her from a life of degradation and misery, and\nmake a lady of the wretched vagabond, raising her from the rank of a\ndomestic animal to that of a loved and respected woman!...\n\n\"Woe, woe!\" she cried, clutching her bosom as if her fingers were\ntalons: \"I cannot, never, never.... Nothing in the world shall ever\ntake me to Aldeacorba! Virgin, mother of my soul, take me, take me....\nMother, will you not come and fetch me!\"\n\nAs night came on, she went home; on her way she met Celipin with a\nstick in his hand and his cap hung on the end of it.\n\n\"Look here, Nelilla,\" said the boy: \"Is not this how Don Teodoro\ncarries his hat? Just now I was passing the pool at Hinojales and\nI looked at my reflection in the water. My! was not I surprised--I\nthought I looked just like Don Teodoro Golfin. Some day this week we\nwill set out to become learned and useful persons. I have got as much\nmoney now as I want, and you will see, no one will dare to laugh at\nSe\u00c3\u00b1or de Celipin.\"\n\nFor three days Nela kept out of the way, wandering about the\nneighborhood of the mines, following the course of the river along its\nrugged banks, or hiding herself in the quiet recesses of the wood of\nSaldeoro. The nights she spent in her basket, but she could not sleep.\nOne night she timidly called her companion:\n\n\"Celipin--when?\" and Celipin replied with all the solemnity befitting a\nregular expedition:\n\n\"To-morrow.\"\n\nThe two adventurers rose at day-break, and both went their way; Celipin\nto his work, and Nela to carry a message from Se\u00c3\u00b1ana to the engineer's\nhousekeeper. On her return she found Se\u00c3\u00b1orita Florentina, who was\nwaiting for her at Centeno's house. Mar\u00c3\u00ada was surprised and alarmed at\nseeing her, though her instinct told her of the end and object of this\nvisit.\n\n\"Nela, my little sister,\" said the girl with engaging gentleness: \"Why\nare you behaving so strangely? Why have you not been near us all these\ndays? Come, Pablo wishes to see you. Do you not know that now he can\nsay: 'I want to see this thing or the other?' Do you not know that my\ncousin is no longer blind?\"\n\n\"Yes--I know it,\" said Nela, taking the hand Florentina held out to her\nand covering it with kisses.\n\n\"Come along then; come at once. He is always asking for 'Se\u00c3\u00b1ora Nela.'\nAnd to-day you must be there when Don Teodoro takes the bandage off--it\nis the fourth time. Oh! the first day--when he first tried it! What a\nday that was! When we knew for certain that my cousin was born again,\nas I may say, to the light of day--we almost died of joy.--And the\nfirst face he saw was mine.--Come along, quickly.\" But Mar\u00c3\u00ada drew her\nhand out of her Virgin's clasp.\n\n\"Have you forgotten my promise, my vow?\" Florentina went on, \"or did\nyou think I was talking at random? But indeed, nothing I can do seems\nenough to show our Mother of Mercies my gratitude for the grace she\nhas shown us. I should like that, on this day, not a creature that\nthe whole world contains should be sad. I should like to divide my\nhappiness, and fling it abroad on all sides, as the sower casts the\nseed; I should like to go into every wretched dwelling and say: 'All\nyour troubles are ended. I have a remedy for them all.'--But it is\nimpossible; no one can do that but God. Still, as my powers are not\nequal to my will, let me at any rate do what I can--and these are not\nmere words, Nela. Come with me, away from this hovel; bid farewell to\neverything that has made part of your misery and your loneliness. For\nyou may have an affection, even for your wretchedness, my child.\"\n\nMarianela did not, however, say good-bye to anything; and as none\nof the family were indoors at that hour, she did not wait for them.\nFlorentina went out, leading by the hand the poor little girl whom her\nnoble impulses and christian feeling had adopted to be her equal; and\nNela allowed herself to be led, from sheer incapacity to offer any\nresistance. She felt as though some superhuman power had taken her in\nhand and was carrying her along, fatally and inevitably, as the angels\nbear a soul away to Heaven.\n\nThey took the path by Hinojales, where the vagabond child had seen\nFlorentina for the first time. As they turned into the lane the young\nlady said to her companion.\n\n\"Why have you not been to the house? My uncle says that you have so\nmuch natural modesty and delicacy that it is a pity you should not have\nbeen educated. Was it delicacy that kept you from coming to ask for\nwhat, by God's mercy, you had so happily gained? Without doubt my uncle\nis right.... You should have seen the poor dear man that day--he said\nhe should not be sorry to die!--Do you see? My eyes are still red with\ncrying so much. And last night my uncle and my father and I never went\nto sleep; we were making plans for all the family and building castles\nin the air all night--Why do you say nothing? Why are you so silent?\nAre you not as glad as I am?\"\n\nNela looked up in the girl's bright face and made a faint effort to\nresist the gentle hand that held hers.\n\n\"Come along--what is the matter? You look at me so strangely Nela.\"\n\nShe did indeed; the hapless child's eyes wandering vaguely from one\nobject to another, ended by fixing themselves on the Virgin of her\nfancy, with a strange glitter of apprehension.\n\n\"Why does your hand tremble so?\" Florentina went on. \"Are you ill?\nYou are as pale as death and your teeth are chattering. If you are\nill I will cure you, I myself can cure you. From this day you will\nhave some one to care for you, and pet you, and make much of you.\nAnd I shall not be alone you know, for Pablo is very fond of you--he\ntold me so. We both love you dearly and he and I shall be like one\nperson.--He wants to see you. Just fancy how full of curiosity a man\nmust be who has never seen anything at all; but you cannot think\nhow--from being so clever as he is, and having an imagination which\nseems to have given him a number of ideas which blind people scarcely\never have--from the first moment he knew what was pretty and what was\nugly. A bit of scarlet sealing-wax pleased him at once and a piece\nof coal he thought hideous. He admired the beauty of the sky and was\ndisgusted at the sight of a frog. Everything that is beautiful excites\nhim to an enthusiasm that is almost delirium; everything ugly fills him\nwith horror, and makes him tremble as we do when we are frightened.\nMy appearance must have pleased him, for he exclaimed as soon as he\nsaw me: \"Oh! cousin, how pretty you are! Thank God for having bestowed\nsight on me so that I can see you!\"\n\nNela had gently withdrawn her hand from Florentina's grasp and fell on\nthe ground as if suddenly stricken to death. The young girl bent over\nher, saying in coaxing tones: \"Oh! what is it ails you? Why do you\nlook at me so?\" Marianela fixed her eyes on the Holy Virgin's face with\na miserable stare; still their expression was not one of aversion, but\nrather a gaze of agonized entreaty, like the last look of a dying man\nimploring mercy from the image of the Saviour, and believing it to be\nGod himself.\n\n\"Se\u00c3\u00b1ora,\" murmured the child, \"I do not hate you--no indeed I do not\nhate you. On the contrary, I love you dearly--I adore you.\" And taking\nup the hem of Florentina's dress she pressed it to her dry lips and\nkissed it fervently.\n\n\"But whoever supposed you would hate me?\" said the young girl greatly\nbewildered. \"I know that you love me. But you frighten me--get up.\"\n\n\"I do love you, dearly, dearly; I adore you,\" repeated Nela, kissing\nthe feet of her benefactress. \"And yet I cannot--I cannot....\"\n\n\"What cannot you do--for God's sake! get up.\" Florentina put out\nher arms to help her up; but Nela rose without any assistance, and\nspringing away to a safe distance, she repeated, bursting into a flood\nof tears:\n\n\"I cannot Se\u00c3\u00b1orita, I cannot.\"\n\n\"What?--in Heaven's name! what has come over you?\"\n\n\"I cannot go there.\" And she pointed to Aldeacorba, where the roof of\nDon Francisco's house was visible among the trees.\n\n\"And why?\"\n\n\"The Blessed Virgin knows,\" replied the child with prompt decision.\n\"May the Holy Virgin bless you!\" She made a cross with her fingers and\nkissed it; she was registering a vow.\n\nFlorentina took a step towards her and Mar\u00c3\u00ada, understanding the loving\nimpulse, flew to meet her; she laid her head against her friend's\nbosom, and murmured as she sobbed: \"Kiss me--for God's sake! give me\none kiss!\"\n\nFlorentina kissed her tenderly, and then freeing herself with a start,\nor rather a wild and sudden leap, the child--or woman--fled to a brake\nclose at hand; the brushwood seemed to open and swallow her up.\n\n\"Nela, Nela--little sister!\" cried Florentina in much distress.\n\n\"Farewell, child of my eyes!\" said Nela, turning round to look at her\nonce more; and she vanished in the copse.\n\nFlorentina listened to the rustle of the branches, as the hunter\nlistens to the rush of the prey that has escaped him. Then all was\nsilent; not a sound was to be heard but the vague monotone that fills\nthe atmosphere at noon in the open country--a sound which seems to\nbe the whisper of our own thoughts as they go forth towards all that\nsurrounds us. Florentina stood amazed, powerless, speechless, deeply\ndistressed--as if she had just seen some fond illusion snatched from\nher gaze. She did not know what to think of it all, and even her\nunbounded kind-heartedness, which often crippled her judgment, could\nsupply no explanation.\n\nShe had been standing in the same spot for some little time, her head\ndrooping, her cheeks tingling, and her blue eyes full of tears, when\nTeodoro Golfin happened to come upon her, making his way at an easy\npace from Aldeacorba homewards. The doctor was greatly astonished to\nfind the young lady alone and with an expression of vexation and regret\nwhich, far from diminishing her beauty, added to it and made it more\ninteresting.\n\n\"What ails the girl?\" he exclaimed with some anxiety. \"Why, Florentina,\nwhat is the matter?\"\n\n\"A dreadful thing, Se\u00c3\u00b1or Golfin,\" said Florentina, wiping her eyes. \"I\nwas thinking--considering how many terrible things there are in the\nworld.\"\n\n\"And what are these terrible things, Se\u00c3\u00b1orita? Where have you been?\nCan anything have happened to you?\"\n\n\"Provoking things--and of all things there is one which is more\nprovoking than all the rest.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"Ingratitude, Se\u00c3\u00b1or.\" And pointing to the copse of bramble and fern,\nshe added: \"It was in that direction.\"\n\nShe went up to the highest spot at hand to see farther into the\ndistance. \"Quite out of sight!\" she said with a sigh.\n\n\"Quite,\" said the surgeon laughing. \"Don Manuel told me that you were\ndevoting yourself to collecting butterflies. They are ungrateful\ncreatures indeed not to wish to be caught by you.\"\n\n\"It is not that--I will tell you all about it if you are going to\nAldeacorba.\"\n\n\"I was not going, as I have just come away, fair damsel; but if you\nwill tell me all about it--be it what it may--I will go back again. I\nam all ears for your story.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nNELA DECIDES THAT SHE MUST GO.\n\n\nNela wandered about alone all day, and at night she prowled round\nthe house at Aldeacorba, creeping as near to it as she dared without\nrunning the risk of being discovered; whenever she heard footsteps\nshe stole away like a thief. Then she went down into the crater of La\nTerrible, whose grewsome aspect somehow suited her gloomy mood; she\nlingered there some time looking up at the stone giants that stood\nround it, and then she climbed up one of them to see the lights of\nAldeacorba. There they were, sparkling above the slopes of the mine\nagainst the dark background of earth and sky. After gazing at them for\na while as if her hungry eyes had never seen lights before, she quitted\nLa Terrible and went towards La Trascava. But before she reached it she\nheard footsteps, and turning round, she saw Master Celipin coming along\nthe path at a brisk determined pace. He had a small bundle hanging\nfrom a stick over his shoulder, and his step, as well as his air and\nattitude, announced a full determination never to stop till he should\nhave paced the whole circumference of the globe.\n\n\"Celipe!--Where are you going?\" cried Nela, detaining him.\n\n\"Nela ... you out here! We thought you were with Se\u00c3\u00b1orita Florentina,\neating ham, and turkey, and partridges all day long, and drinking\nlemonade and syrups. What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"And you--where are you off to?\"\n\n\"You ask me that, now? Why do you ask me since you know quite well,\"\nanswered the boy, jerking the stick and bundle. \"You know very well\nthat I am going to learn all I can and make money. Did I not tell you\nit would be to-night?--And here I am, as glad as can be--a little\nsorry, too, when I think that father and mother will cry. You see,\nNela, the Blessed Virgin favored us to-night, for father and mother\nbegan to snore sooner than usual; and I had my bundle ready, and I\nclimbed up to the window and got out of it.--Now are you coming or not?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am coming,\" said Nela with sudden decision, taking the arm of\nthe adventurous Celipin.\n\n\"We will take the train, and we will go in the train as far as we can,\"\nsaid Celipin with liberal enthusiasm. \"And then we must beg till we get\nto Madrid, where the King of Spain lives; and when once we have got\nthere, you can go as a servant in the house of some Marquis or Count,\nand I will go into another, and at the same time I can study, and you\ncan have a heap of fine things. And I can teach you a little of all I\nlearn--only a little, not too much; for you women have no need to be as\nlearned as we doctors must be.\"\n\nBefore Celipin had ended his speech, they had set out on their road,\ntrotting on as fast as though they already saw in the distance the\nturrets of the city \"where the King of Spain lives.\"\n\n\"Let us get out of the regular path,\" said Celipin, his practical\ntalents rising to the occasion: \"If they see us they will lay hands\nupon us and give us a good thrashing.\"\n\nBut Nela drew her hand away from her fellow-adventurer's, and sitting\ndown on a stone, she said: \"I am not going.\"\n\n\"Nela! what a little fool you are! You have not a brave heart like\nmine; a heart as big as the rocks in La Terrible!\" said Celipin, with a\nbraggart air. \"What the devil are you afraid of? Why will you not come?\"\n\n\"I--oh!--why should I?\"\n\n\"Do not you know that Don Golfin said that the work here is turning us\nall to stones? I do not want to be a stone--not I.\"\n\n\"I--why should I go?\" repeated Nela with disconsolate bitterness. \"You\nhave time enough--for me, it is too late.\"\n\nAnd Nela's head sunk on her breast and she sat for some time insensible\nto the persuasive eloquence of the Hippocrates of the future. The idea\nthat she was about to cross the boundary of the spot of earth where\nshe had lived so long, and where her mother slept the sleep of the\ndead, made her feel as if she were being torn up by the roots. The\nbeauty of the place in all its variety seemed to claim her by a sort\nof relationship; the rare and fleeting joys, nay, the very misery she\nhad known there; the memory of her friend and of the happy hours when\nthey had walked in the woods or sat by the spring at Saldeoro; all\nthe feelings of admiration or of sympathy, of love or of gratitude,\nwhich had grown and blossomed in her soul among these scenes--these\nflowers--these clouds--these rustling trees--these frowning\nrocks--inseparable as it were from the loveliness or the grandeur,\nthe progress and the immutability of all these works of nature, were\nso many roots from her heart, and dragging them up from the soil was\nbitter anguish.\n\n\"No--I am not going,\" she repeated.\n\nAnd Celipin argued and talked as if, having by some miracle reached the\ngoal of his career, he belonged to all the academies present and to\ncome.\n\n\"You are going home then?\" he asked, seeing that his oratory was as\nunavailing as that of the academies themselves commonly is.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You are going to Aldeacorba?\"\n\n\"No; not there either.\"\n\n\"Then you will go to where Se\u00c3\u00b1ora Florentina lives.\"\n\n\"No, no--not there.\"\n\n\"The devil's in it--but where are you going then?\"\n\nNela did not answer; she sat looking at the ground with an expression\nof dismay, as if she saw there the fragments of the most beautiful and\nprecious thing on earth--fallen and lying broken at her feet.\n\n\"Well then, Nela,\" said Celipin, exhausted with his long harangue, \"I\nmust leave you and be off, for they might follow me, and find me. Would\nyou like me to give you a _peseta_ as a parting gift to-night?\"\n\n\"No, Celipin, I want nothing.--Go, you will be a rich man yet. Take\ncare of yourself and do not forget Socartes and your father and mother.\"\n\nThe traveller had a sensation highly improper in a man of so much\nimportance and dignity--a strong disposition to cry; but swallowing\ndown this inopportune emotion, he said:\n\n\"How should I ever forget Socartes? You need not have said that--I\nshall never forget my father and mother, nor you, for you helped me to\ndo this.--Good-bye, Nelilla--hark! I hear footsteps!\"\n\nCelipin shouldered his staff with a resolution that symbolized his\ncourage to defy all the dangers of the wide world; but his valorous\ndisplay was wasted, for a dog only came running up to them.\n\n\"It is Choto,\" said Nela, trembling all over.\n\n\"A bad sign!\" muttered Celipin, setting forward; and he disappeared in\nthe darkness.\n\nA stone was lost to geology, and the world would be the richer by a\ngreat man!\n\nNela shivered as the dog leaped upon her and caressed her. The\naffectionate creature, after jumping round and round her, whining and\nbarking with so much expression that it was almost like speaking,\nset off running as fast as he could towards Aldeacorba. You might\nhave thought he was in chase of some wild game. Choto--unlike some\norators--seemed to speak when he barked.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJust at this time Teodoro Golfin was coming away from the Pen\u00c3\u00a1guilas'.\nHe was met by Choto, who, with voluble haste, told him--I know not\nwhat. It was a fervent, fitful address, delivered between his gasps\nfor breath and gushes of eager anxiety. Golfin, though he understood\nseveral languages, was not strong in the canine tongue, and paid no\nparticular heed. Choto leaped up and round him, jerking out barks\nfrom his moist jaws, some short and sharp as insults, others soft and\ncoaxing, and then again threats. Teodoro meanwhile stood still, his\nattention was struck by the dog's manner; and Choto, seeing that he had\nmade himself understood to a certain extent, began to run in a contrary\ndirection to Golfin's homeward road. The doctor followed him. \"Very\nwell,\" he muttered, \"that way then.\"\n\nChoto retraced his steps, as if to make sure that Golfin was following\nhim, and then he trotted on again. At some little distance from the\nhouse Golfin heard a voice saying:\n\n\"Well, Choto, what is it you want?\"\n\nHe suspected at once that it was Nela. He paused and listened, hidden\nin the shadow of a beech-tree, and soon perceived a little figure\nstanding out from the stone wall and walking very slowly. The shadows\nof the brambles prevented his seeing her very distinctly. He set out\nto follow her at some little distance, quitting the path and walking\non the turf, so as to make no noise. Beyond a doubt it was Nela. He\nrecognized her perfectly when they got upon open ground, where there\nwere no dark shadows cast by trees or shrubs.\n\nThe girl now went faster and faster; at last she began to run, and\nGolfin ran too. After this unequal race had gone on for some distance,\nNela sat down on a stone. At her feet was the sloping basin of La\nTrascava, black and hideous in the gloom. Golfin waited a moment; then\nhe very softly went nearer to the girl. Choto was seated in front of\nher, squatted on his hind quarters, with his fore paw stretched out,\nand gazing at her with the gravity of a sphinx. Nela stared into the\ndepths below, and suddenly starting to her feet she began to go quickly\ndown the slope--slipping rather than running. With one bound Teodoro\nstood by the abyss, roaring in stentorian tones: \"Nela! Nela!\"\n\nHe looked down, but could see nothing in the dark chasm; he could hear\nChoto whining as he ran round and round the ridge, lower and lower in\nspirals, as if he were being sucked in by some eddy in the dreadful\ngulf. Teodoro thought of going down himself and cautiously took a step\nor two; then he called again, and a voice from below answered: \"Se\u00c3\u00b1or.\"\n\n\"Come up this minute.\"\n\nNo answer.\n\n\"Come up, I say.\"\n\nPresently he could just see the child's face in the lowest visible\ndepths of the horrible chasm. Choto, after snuffing at the opening,\ncame up again, round and round the basin as before; Nela too was\nclimbing up, but very slowly. Indeed, she stopped, and repeated feebly:\n\"Se\u00c3\u00b1or?...\"\n\n\"I tell you come up. What are you doing here?\"\n\nNela came a little further.\n\n\"Come--quickly. I have something to tell you.\"\n\n\"To tell me?\"\n\n\"Yes--something I must tell you at once.\"\n\nNela crawled up; but Teodoro did not feel sure that he had triumphed\ntill he had seized her hand and held it tightly to lead her away with\nhim.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nNELA IS TAMED.\n\n\nThey walked on a short distance without speaking. Teodoro Golfin,\nfor all his learning, wisdom, and eloquence, felt as ignorant and\nas helpless as Nela, and less disposed for speech than usual. She\nfollowed him unresistingly, and he accommodated his steps to those of\nthe child-woman, like a man taking a boy to school. At a turn in the\nroad where three enormous white stones stood up, weather-worn till\nthey looked like bleached skeletons, the doctor sat down, and placing\nNela in front of him, as if she were on her trial for some grave\ndelinquency, he held her by both hands and said solemnly:\n\n\"What were you going to do there?\"\n\n\"I--where?\"\n\n\"Down there. You know very well what I mean. Answer me plainly, as you\nwould answer your confessor or your father.\"\n\n\"I have no father,\" replied Nela with a faintly mutinous accent.\n\n\"That is true--but suppose me to be your father, and answer me. What\nwere you going to do?\"\n\n\"My mother is down there,\" she answered dully.\n\n\"Your mother is dead. Do you not know that dead people are gone to\nanother world, or altogether away?\"\n\n\"She is there,\" said Nela positively, and looking back towards the spot\nshe had left.\n\n\"And you thought you would go to her. Is that it? That is to say, you\nmeant to kill yourself.\"\n\n\"Yes, Se\u00c3\u00b1or, that is it.\"\n\n\"And do you not know that your mother committed a great sin in killing\nherself, and you would do the same if you followed her example? Were\nyou never taught that?\"\n\n\"I do not think anyone ever told me anything of the kind. And if I want\nto kill myself, who is to prevent me?\"\n\n\"But you yourself--without being told--cannot you feel that God cannot\nbe pleased with us for getting rid of our lives? Poor child--left to\nyour own instincts without any teaching, or religion, or loving and\ndisinterested guidance!--What ideas can you have of God, of a future\nlife, of death? What makes you fancy your mother is there? Do you call\na few lifeless bones your mother! Can you believe that she is still\nalive, thinking of you and loving you down in that pit? Did no one\never tell you that when once our souls have left our bodies they never\nreturn to them again? Do you not know that a tomb, a grave, whatever it\nmay be, never contains anything but dust and foul corruption? What do\nyou think God is like? Like some grand and solemn man who sits above\nus with his arms folded, and who allows us to play with our lives,\nwhile, in His place, we see some sprite, hobgoblin or fetich of our\nfancy?--Your master, Nela, who is so wise and good, did he never talk\nto you about such things?\"\n\n\"Oh! yes he did.--But it is of no use to tell me them now....\"\n\n\"Of no use now--when you want to kill yourself? Tell me, silly child,\ndid you think that by throwing yourself into that hole you would be any\nbetter off?\"\n\n\"Yes, Se\u00c3\u00b1or.\"\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"I should feel none of the things I feel now, but something else, much\nbetter--and I should be with my mother.\"\n\n\"I see you are more silly than wicked,\" said Golfin laughing. \"Now, be\nquite honest with me. Do you owe me any grudge?\"\n\n\"No indeed. I owe no one any grudge--least of all you, Se\u00c3\u00b1or, who have\nbeen so kind to me, and have made my master see.\"\n\n\"Very good--but that is not all; I not only want you to like me, but\nyou must trust me and tell me all your little secrets. Strange little\nsecrets are hidden in your mind, little woman, and you must tell them\nall to me--every one. You will see, I shall not be hard upon you; I\nshall make a very kind father confessor.\"\n\nNela smiled a forlorn smile; then bending her head, she fell on her\nknees.\n\n\"No, silly child, that is not the way; sit down by me--come here,\" said\nGolfin, gently drawing her to a seat by his side. \"I fancy you were\ngoing crazy for want of some one to whom you could tell everything;\nis it not so? And you are to conceal nothing. You are indeed alone in\nthe world, poor child.--Come, Nela, let us see; tell me first of all\nwhy--now be very attentive--why you took it into your head that you\nwanted to kill yourself?\"\n\nNela did not answer.\n\n\"I saw you happy enough, and content with life to all appearance, only\na few days since. Why have you suddenly gone mad in a single night?\"\n\n\"I want to go to my mother--\" replied Nela, after hesitating a moment.\n\"I do not want to live any longer. Of what good am I in the world? Is\nit not much better that I should die? And if God will not make me die,\nI will kill myself, my own way.\"\n\n\"This notion that you are of no use is at the bottom of all your\nmiseries, poor little creature! Curses on him--or on them, for they are\nmany--who ever put it into your head. They are all equally responsible\nfor the neglect, the isolation, and the ignorance in which you lived.\nYou are of no use! God knows what you might have been if you had fallen\ninto other hands! A refined nature is yours, perhaps an exquisitely\nsuperior one.--But good Heavens! If you put a harp into clumsy hands\nwhat can they do with it but break it.--Because your fragile frame is\nnot strong enough to break stones and carry earth like those brutes in\nhuman form Mariuca and Pepina, who shall say that you are of no use?\nWere we all born to toil like mere animals? Are you to be forbidden to\nhave any intelligence, any feeling, any of the gifts of nature which\nno one has ever cultivated in you? Nonsense! You are of some use; you\nmight be of great good if you only fell into hands that could mould you\nand train you.\"\n\nNela, whose intuition gathered the purport of this speech, though the\nwords were beyond her, was deeply impressed. She kept her eyes fixed on\nTeodoro Golfin's rugged, shrewd, and expressive countenance. Her heart\nwas full of astonishment and gratitude.\n\n\"Still there is a mystery about you,\" the dusky, leonine doctor went\non: \"The most perfect opportunity was offered you to escape from your\nmiserable lot, and you refused it. Florentina, who is an angel if ever\nthere was one, was ready to adopt you as a friend and a sister; I never\nknew an instance of greater kindness and generosity.--And what have you\ndone? Fled from her like a wild thing.--This is sheer ingratitude--or\nsome other feeling which I cannot at all comprehend.\"\n\n\"No, no, no,\" cried Nela, much distressed, \"I am not ungrateful. I\nadore Se\u00c3\u00b1orita Florentina; she seems to me not to be made of flesh and\nblood like the rest of us; I do not deserve even to look upon her....\"\n\n\"Well, my child, you may mean what you say; but from your behavior we\ncan only conclude that you are ungrateful--most ungrateful....\"\n\n\"No, no,\" sobbed Nela. \"I am not, indeed I am not ungrateful. I was\nafraid--I knew--that you would all think me ungrateful, and that was\nthe only thing that troubled me when I was going to kill myself.--But I\nam so stupid; I did not know how to ask pardon of the Se\u00c3\u00b1orita before I\nran away, nor how to explain it all.\"\n\n\"I will make your peace with Florentina; and even if you wish never to\nsee her again, I will undertake to tell her and convince her that you\nwere not ungrateful. Now, open your heart to me and tell me everything;\nwhat makes you so miserable and desperate? However wretched a human\nbeing may be--however great his misery and loneliness, he does not take\nhis own life unless he has some overpowering reason for hating it.\"\n\n\"No, Se\u00c3\u00b1or--so it seems to me.\"\n\n\"Then you hate your life?\"\n\nNela was silent for a minute. Then, crossing her arms, she exclaimed\nvehemently.\n\n\"No--no. I do not hate it; on the contrary, I want to find it!\"\n\n\"A pretty way you were going to work to look for it!\"\n\n\"I thought that when you were dead you would have everything you could\nnot get here. If not, why is death always, always calling us to come?\nI have dreams, and when I dream I see all who are dead happy and at\npeace.\"\n\n\"You believe in dreams?\"\n\n\"Yes, Se\u00c3\u00b1or.--I look at the trees and the rocks that I have seen here\never since I was born, and in their face....\"\n\n\"Come, come--the trees and rocks have faces?\"\n\n\"Yes--everything that is lovely can see and speak.--And they say to me:\n'Come to us--die, and you will live quite happy.'\"\n\n\"What a lamentable fancy!\" Golfin muttered to himself. \"A perfectly\npagan spirit!\"\n\nAnd he added aloud:\n\n\"But if you want to live, why did you not accept Florentina's offer? I\ncome back to the same question.\"\n\n\"Because--because--what the Se\u00c3\u00b1orita offered me was worse than death!\"\ncried Nela vehemently.\n\n\"How unjustly you think of her kind charity. There are, of course,\nbeings so wretched that they prefer a low and vagabond existence to\nthe dignity of a superior position. You are accustomed to a free life\nin direct contact with nature, and you prefer this debased freedom to\nthe sweet affections of home life. Have you been so happy then in this\nmode of life?\"\n\n\"I was beginning to be happy....\"\n\n\"And when did you cease to be happy?\" After a long pause, Nela replied:\n\n\"When you came here.\"\n\n\"I--what harm have I done you?\"\n\n\"None, none--nothing but the greatest good.\"\n\n\"I have given your master his sight,\" said Golfin, looking at Nela's\nface with the narrow attention of a physiologist. \"Do you not thank me\nfor that?\"\n\n\"Much, Se\u00c3\u00b1or, very much,\" and she gazed up at him with eyes full of\ntears.\n\nGolfin watched her closely, so as not to miss the slightest change\nof expression which might guide him to a comprehension of the girl's\nfeelings, as he went on:\n\n\"Your master told me that he loved you dearly, when he was blind; and\nnow that he can see, he constantly asks for Nela. He knows very well\nthat for him the whole outer world was filled by one person--Nela; and\nthe sight which has been mercifully bestowed on him is of no value to\nhim, unless he can use it to see Nela.\"\n\n\"To see Nela--but he never shall see Nela--Nela will never let him see\nher!\" she exclaimed excitedly.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because she is so ugly.--He may have cared for Mar\u00c3\u00ada Canela when his\neyes were shut; but now that they are open and he can see the Se\u00c3\u00b1orita,\nhe can never, never care for a poor little dwarf.\"\n\n\"Who knows but....\"\n\n\"It is impossible,\" she said positively.\n\n\"It is your fancy--you cannot tell whether your master will be pleased\nwith you or not till you try. I will take you to the house.\"\n\n\"I will not go--I cannot go!\" she cried, starting to her feet and\nstanding in front of Teodoro, who was utterly astounded at the\ndetermination of her gesture and the flash of her black eyes, which\nboth revealed her resolute nature.\n\n\"Be calm, be easy--come here,\" he said persuasively. \"It is true that\nyou are not very pretty--but a sensible man does not think so much as\nyou fancy of mere outside beauty. You are too self-conscious, little\nwoman.\"\n\nBut Nela, paying no sort of heed to the doctor's moralities, and as\nresolute in her attitude as she was in her opinion, gravely went on as\nif pronouncing sentence:\n\n\"There ought to be nothing ugly in the world.--Nothing that is ugly\nought to be allowed to live.\"\n\n\"But, my child, if all we ugly people were to be obliged to take\nourselves out of the world, it would be left almost depopulated.\nPoor, unhappy, little simpleton! But this notion of yours is not a\nnew one. Other persons had it before you, centuries ago; persons with\nan imagination like yours--living, as you have lived, in the midst of\nNature, and lacking the light which your ignorance and loneliness have\ndeprived you of, and which they had not, because it had not then dawned\non the world.--But you must be cured of this delusion; you must reflect\nthat you have your portion of gifts more precious than beauty--gifts of\nthe mind, which neither fade with time, nor change with the caprices of\ntaste. Seek for them in your soul and you will find them. They will not\nperish as beauty would which, seek it as you may in your looking-glass,\nyou will never find. But seek out these really good and precious\ngifts; cultivate them, and when you see them thriving and blooming,\nall this misery you are suffering will vanish--take my word for it.\nAnd meanwhile you will soon rise superior to the wretched situation in\nwhich you now are, and acquire a beauty which may not perhaps charm\nthe eye, but which will be a source of pride and happiness to yourself.\"\n\nThis wise advice was either not heard or not heeded by Nela; she sat\ndown again by Golfin and gazed fixedly in his face. Her small eyes,\nmore eloquent just then than the finest could have been, seemed to say:\n\n\"And what is the upshot of all these fine speeches, learned Sir?\"\n\n\"Now you see,\" Golfin went on, warming to his subject, and giving it,\nin spite of himself, the character of a psychological lecture--\"there\nis one important question, and that is....\"\n\nBut Nela had guessed it, and covered her face with her hands.\n\n\"There is nothing strange in it--on the contrary, it is the most\nnatural thing that could happen to you. You have a sensitive\ntemperament and an excitable imagination. You and your master had led\na life together of free and poetic communion with nature, and of most\nperfect and innocent intimacy. He is as wise and clever as a man can\nbe, and as handsome as a statue. His beauty, when blind even, seemed\nformed to delight the eyes of those who could see. His kindness of\nheart too, and generous spirit are enough to charm and win the love of\nany woman. It is not strange that they should have captivated you--a\nchild so womanly--or a woman looking so like a child.--Do you love him\nso much? More than anything else in the world?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes--Se\u00c3\u00b1or,\" the girl sobbed out.\n\n\"And you cannot bear the idea of his ceasing to love you?\"\n\n\"No--Se\u00c3\u00b1or.\"\n\n\"And he used to say loving words to you and make you promises?...\"\n\n\"Yes, oh yes, Se\u00c3\u00b1or. He told me I should be his companion as long as he\nlived--and--and I believed him.\"\n\n\"And why should you not?\"\n\n\"He said he could not live without me, and that even if he ever could\nsee he would still love me. I was quite happy; I was ugly, and little,\nand ill-made, but I did not care, for he could not see me; and in his\ndarkness he thought I was pretty.--And then....\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Golfin gently, for he was filled with pity. \"I see the\nfault is all mine.\"\n\n\"Fault, no; for you did a good deed. You are very, very good. It\nis good to have given him his sight. I know, I tell myself, that\nit is good; but after that I must go away, quite away--for he will\nsee Se\u00c3\u00b1orita Florentina and will compare me with her--and Se\u00c3\u00b1orita\nFlorentina is as pretty as the angels, and I--it is like comparing a\npiece of broken glass with the sun! Of what good can I be? I dreamed\nthat I ought never to have been born! Oh why was I ever born? God made\na mistake; he gave me an ugly face, and a miserable little body, and\nsuch a large heart! But of what use to me is a large heart?--It is a\ntorment and nothing else. Woe is me! If I did not keep it under, it\nwould hate and detest a great many people. And yet I do not want to\nhate people--I do not know how to hate them, and I would rather bury my\nmiserable heart than live to learn to hate; bury it, so that it should\nnot torment me any more.\"\n\n\"You are tormented by jealousy, and by your sense of humiliation. Poor\nlittle one, you are indeed alone! Neither the knowledge you lack, nor\nthe home you have never had, nor the work you cannot do would avail to\nsave you from this. But tell me, what do you feel about the protection\nand kindness that Florentina offers you?\"\n\n\"Terror! Shame!\" exclaimed Nela, opening her eyes wide in horror. \"To\nlive with them--to see them constantly! For they will marry--my heart\ntells me they will marry; I dreamed it, I know it.\"\n\n\"But Florentina is very kind; she will love you dearly.\"\n\n\"Yes, and I love her--but not at Aldeacorba!\" cried the girl in wild\naccents. \"She came to rob me of what was mine--for he was mine--yes,\nSe\u00c3\u00b1or, he was indeed. Florentina is like the Blessed Virgin--I will\npray to her, yes, Se\u00c3\u00b1or, and worship her; but I do not want her to take\naway what is my own--and she will take it away--she has taken it away\nalready! And where am I to go to; what am I, what good am I in the\nworld at all? I have lost everything and I want to go to my mother.\"\n\nShe walked away; but Golfin seized her as a wild beast clutches its\nprey, and held her tightly by the wrist. As he did so he felt her quick\nand fluttering pulse.\n\n\"Come here,\" he said. \"From this moment, whether you like it or no,\nyou are my slave. You are mine, and you are to do nothing but what I\ntell you. Poor little soul, full of eager feeling, of fervent fancy,\nfrankness and superstition--you have a nature framed for all that is\ngood; but it has been ruined by the wild life you have led, by neglect\nand want of training, and even the most elementary teaching! What\na hideous state of society we live in, which forgets its duties so\nutterly, and leaves a precious creature like this perish!--Come here;\nI am not going to let you quit my side. I have hunted you down and\ncaught you--caught you in a trap in the midst of the woods, in some\nsylvan wilderness, and now I shall try to teach you and train you. We\nwill see if this rough diamond cannot be cut and polished. Ah! you do\nnot even know how ignorant you are; and I shall open a new world to\nyour mind, show you a thousand wonderful things that you have never\nunderstood, though you have a vague and dim idea of some of them. Tell\nme, cannot you feel in your soul a germ--how shall I explain myself?\na bud, of that rarest and most beautiful grace: Humility? The mother\nof all the virtues; which, strange to say, makes us actually happy\nwhen we see ourselves subordinate to others? Have you never felt the\nimpulse of self-denial, which makes us rejoice in sacrificing ourselves\nfor others, in making ourselves small that some one else may become\ngreat?--But you will learn this, child; you will learn to lay your\nugliness at the feet of beauty, to look on with calm satisfaction and\njoy at the triumphs of others, to fetter that great wild heart of yours\nand bring it into subjection, so that you shall never feel envy nor\nrage, but will love your neighbor as yourself, and rise superior to all\nwho may have injured or hurt you. You shall be made all that Nature\nmeant you to be when she endowed you at your birth. Hapless child! Born\nin a Christian country, and not even a Christian! Your soul dwells in\na sort of poetic worship of nature.--You cannot understand me, little\none, but so it is. You are in the state of those primitive peoples\nof whom the memory even hardly survives--governed by your instincts\nand passions, while beauty is your dearest idol. Eighteen centuries\nhave been devoted in vain to spiritualizing humanity, so far as you\nare concerned. And as to the selfish world which has left you to such\na fate!--What name does it deserve? You have lived in these mines, a\nsolitary soul, not taught a single letter, not even sent to an infant\nschool, though you would have learnt little enough there; not even\ngiven the most imperfect teaching in that religion of which your nation\nboasts. Why, you have never been inside a church except to stare at\nsome ceremony which to you had no meaning; you cannot even mutter a\nprayer that you understand; you know nothing of the world, or of God,\nor your own soul....\n\n\"But you shall know all this; you shall be a different creature. You\nshall no longer be hapless little Nela, but a good, and honest, and\nuseful woman.\"\n\nIt would be rash to assert that Nela had understood all this speech,\nwhich Golfin declaimed with such vehemence and fervor that he entirely\nforgot the person to whom he was speaking. But the little outcast\nfelt a curious fascination, and the spirit of her friend's utterances\nsank gently into her soul, and soothed it, and compelled her to\nblind assent. His power over the untaught girl was that fateful and\nirresistible control which a superior mind exercises over an inferior\none. Sad but unresisting, her head drooped against the surgeon's\nshoulder.\n\n\"Come along,\" Golfin said resolutely.\n\nNela trembled from head to foot; a cold sweat stood on her face, and\nGolfin felt that her hands were icy-cold, and her pulses beating\nviolently; but he failed to attribute this physical condition to her\nmental anguish; he held her hand more firmly and repeated: \"Come--it is\ncold here.\"\n\nHis power over her was so great that she rose as he did, and they went\na little way together. But then Nela stopped, and fell on her knees.\n\n\"Oh, Se\u00c3\u00b1or!\" she cried in an agony: \"Do not take me away with you.\"\n\nShe was very pale, and looked wrecked by physical and mental misery.\nGolfin tried to pull her up; but her helpless frame did not stir by\nany strength of her own. It was clear she must be carried like a\nsenseless corpse.\n\n\"One day,\" said Golfin, \"not very long since, almost in this very\nplace, I took you on my shoulders to carry you. Now I must do the same\nit seems.\"\n\nHe lifted her in his arms; her hot breath seemed to burn his face. She\nwas drooping, fading, dying like a plant torn up from the soil, and\nwith its roots laid bare.\n\nAs they got nearer to Aldeacorba, Golfin felt some life returning to\nthe dead weight in his arms. Nela raised her head, and threw up her\nhands in despair, but she said nothing.\n\nThey went in; all was silent. A maid servant came to meet them, and by\nTeodoro's desire she conducted him noiselessly to Florentina's room.\n\nFlorentina was alone. By the light of a fast-dying lamp she was\nkneeling on the floor, her elbows resting on the seat of a chair, and\npraying with absorbed devotion. She was startled at seeing a man at her\ndoor at so late an hour, but her alarm at once gave way to surprise,\nwhen she saw the burden Golfin bore in his strong arms.\n\nHer astonishment was too great for speech when the doctor, carefully\ndepositing his load on a sofa, said:\n\n\"I have caught her you see.--What do you say to that? Am I a good\nbutterfly hunter?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nA NEW WORLD.\n\n\nWe must now go back a few days.\n\nWhen Teodoro Golfin first removed the bandage for a few moments from\nPablo Pen\u00c3\u00a1guilas' eyes, the boy uttered a cry of terror. Every impulse\nmade him shrink from all he saw; he put out his hands as though by\npushing away one object he could get away farther from the rest.\nLuminous space was to him like a vast void into which he felt as if he\nmust fall; and the instinct of self-preservation made him close his\neyes to feel himself safe. However, his father, the surgeon, and the\nrest of them, persuaded him to try once more, for all were equally\nanxious; he looked again, but his terror was no less. The images\nof all he saw, rushed into his brain with such sudden violence and\nconfusion--with a sort of storm and assault, as it were--that he felt\nas if they were falling upon him bodily. The distant mountains seemed\nto lie within reach, and the persons and objects that were near him\nseemed, literally, to strike his eyes.\n\nGolfin noted these phenomena with the most eager interest; this was\nthe second case of cure of congenital blindness which he had had the\nopportunity of studying. The others hardly dared to be glad; they\nwere so bewildered and alarmed by the agitating effects produced on\nthe patient by the first exercise of the function of sight. To Pablo\nhimself it was a series of delightful experiments. His nerves and his\nimagination were so seriously excited the surgeon thought it prudent to\ncompel him to rest.\n\n\"Now,\" he said, smiling, \"you have seen enough for to-day. You cannot\nstep out of darkness into light, into the wide domain of the sun, as\nyou would walk into a theatre. This is a new birth, with pain as well\nas joy in it.\"\n\nPresently the young fellow was so eager to try his newly-found power\nonce more, that Golfin consented to open a crack, as it were, upon the\nouter world.\n\n\"My whole mind,\" said Pablo, trying to explain his first impressions,\n\"seems bathed in beauty--a beauty I had never dreamed of before. What\nwere the things which rushed in upon me and filled me with terror? It\nwas the sense of size, of space, which I had never before conceived\nof but in a very imperfect manner, and which dawned upon me clear and\nterrible; as if I were being dragged up to the highest mountains and\ndown to the deepest abyss. It is all grand and beautiful, but it makes\nme tremble. But I want to feel it all once more. All the glory and\nloveliness that I gazed at has made me feel bewildered and humbled; it\nwas like some serene and majestic presence bending down to meet me.\nThe whole universe seemed to be rushing towards me and I was startled\nand terror stricken--the sky looked like a vast space, watching,\nlistening--I cannot put it into words.--It was vacancy, but strangely\nfull of expression. All that landscape of sky and mountains looked at\nme, came down upon me--but it was all so cold, and grand, and stern.\nLet me see something delicate, something gentle and lovable--Nela!\nWhere is Nela?\"\n\nGolfin once more relieved him of the bandage, and giving him a pair of\nsuitable spectacles, he left him free to look about him.\n\n\"Oh! is that Nela! Merciful Heaven!\" exclaimed Pablo enchanted.\n\n\"This is your cousin Florentina.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the lad, coloring with confusion.\n\n\"That is my cousin. I had no idea any person could be so\nbeautiful.--Oh! thank God for giving me the faculty which enables me to\nsee anything so lovely. Cousin Florentina, you are like the most lovely\nmusic--like the most perfect embodiment of some delicious harmony.--And\nNela, where is she?\"\n\n\"You will have time enough to see her,\" said Don Francisco delighted.\n\"Try now to be calm.\"\n\n\"Florentina, Florentina!\" repeated Pablo excitedly. \"What is it in your\nface that makes me feel as if the spirit of God himself was shining\nthrough it? You stand in the midst of a glory which must, to be sure,\nbe the sun. Beams, rays seem to shine from your face.--Ah! at last I\nknow what the angels are like--and your dress, your hands, your hair,\nseem to fill me with some new and strange sensation. What is it?\"\n\n\"He is beginning to see color,\" muttered Golfin to himself. \"He perhaps\nperceives every object surrounded by the colors of the spectrum. But he\ncannot estimate degrees of distance.\"\n\n\"I seem to have you inside my eyes,\" Pablo went on. \"You seem to have\nbecome part of my thoughts, and the sight of you comes upon me like a\nmemory; but a memory of what? I never saw any thing or any body before.\nCan I have lived before I came into this world? I know not--but I knew\nyour eyes. And you, father--where are you? I have seen you--yes I have\npictured you too--you are just what I have loved. And now my uncle? You\nare very much alike.--And where, where is that dear good Golfin?--bless\nhim!\"\n\n\"Here, minding my patient,\" said the surgeon coming forward. \"Here I am\nas ugly as sin.--As you have never seen a lion or a Newfoundland dog,\nyou can have no idea of my style of beauty. They say I am exactly like\nthose two noble beasts.\"\n\n\"All good kind souls!...\" said Pablo.\n\n\"But my cousin is the prettiest--oh! infinitely the prettiest. But\nNela, for pity's sake, where is Nela?\"\n\nThey told him that his _lazarillo_ never came to the house, and that\nthey had been too busy to go to look for her, and he was extremely\ndistressed at this intelligence. They succeeded in soothing him, and as\nthey feared he might become feverish, they persuaded him to go to bed\nand try to sleep.\n\nThe next day he was in a state of great prostration, but his vigorous\nnature triumphed over everything. He begged to have a glass of water\nand when he saw it, he exclaimed: \"I feel as I were drinking at the\nmere sight of water.\"\n\nHis expressions were equally vivid and picturesque about everything he\nsaw which struck his fancy strongly. After correcting the defective\nsphericity of the eye by means of glasses, which he tried one after\nanother, Golfin began to direct his attention to the differences and\ncombinations of colors, and the young man's sound mind and taste never\nfailed in distinguishing the ugly from the beautiful. Indeed, he felt\nthese two attributes as two absolute and distinct ideas, without\nconnecting them in any way with any notion of utility or, on the other\nhand, of goodness. A butterfly which flew by accident into his room\nenchanted him, but an ink-bottle he thought simply horrible, though\nhis father explained to him that it could not be otherwise, since its\nuse was to hold ink to write with. When he was shown two prints, one\nof the Crucifixion, and one of Galatea riding in a shell and escorted\nby Tritons and Nymphs, he preferred the second--which was a great\nscandal to Florentina, who promised herself that she would teach him\nto hold sacred things far above everything profane. He watched their\nfaces with the keenest attention, and the wonderful coincidence of\nfacial expression with language astonished him excessively. When he\nsaw the maids and other women about the place, he was greatly annoyed\nif they were ugly or commonplace; indeed, his cousin's beauty made\nhim indifferent to any other woman. In spite of this he wanted to see\nthem all; his curiosity was like a raging thirst which nothing could\nsatisfy. Every day he was disappointed at never seeing Nela; but he was\nso fond of Florentina that he could not bear her to leave him for a\nmoment.\n\nOn the third day Golfin said to him: \"You have now made acquaintance\nwith a great many things--the marvels of this visible world. Now--you\nmust see yourself.\"\n\nHe brought a mirror, and Pablo looked in it.\n\n\"That is I!\" he exclaimed with simple admiration. \"It is difficult to\nbelieve it. How have I come inside that hard still sheet of water?\nWhat a wonderful thing glass is! It seems as if it could not be true\nthat men made that stony atmosphere.--My word! but I am not an ugly\nfellow!--What do you say cousin? And you, when you look in this, do you\nsee yourself as pretty as you are? No, impossible. Look up into the sky\nand you will find your image there. You may believe you see an angel\nwhen you only look at yourself!\"\n\nThat evening, when he was alone with her and she was giving him some\nlittle help he needed as an invalid, Pablo said to her:\n\n\"Cousin, my father read me, I remember, a passage in history about\nChristopher Columbus who discovered a New World, which no European had\never seen before. That navigator opened the eyes of the Old World, so\nthat they saw another and more beautiful one. I cannot help thinking\nof him as a man like Teodoro Golfin, and of Europe as a blind man to\nwhom America and its wonders were like a revelation of light. Well,\nand I have seen a New World.--You are my America, you are that first\nand lovely island where Columbus set foot on land. He never saw the\ncontinent, with its vast forests and immense rivers, and I too perhaps\nhave not yet seen what is loveliest of all....\" He broke off and sat\nsunk in thought; then presently he asked:\n\n\"Where is Nela?\"\n\n\"I cannot think what has come over the poor child,\" said Florentina. \"I\nsuppose she does not wish to see you.\"\n\n\"She is bashful and very shy,\" replied Pablo: \"She is afraid of\ntroubling us in the house. Florentina, I must tell you--in confidence,\nthat I love her dearly; you will love her too. I have a most eager\nwish to see my good little comrade and friend.\"\n\n\"I will go and look for her to-morrow morning myself.\"\n\n\"Yes, do--but do not be gone long. When I do not see you I feel very\nlonely; I have become accustomed to see you, and these three days have\nbeen centuries of happiness.--Do not rob me of a minute. Last night my\nfather told me that after having seen you I ought never to want to see\nanother woman.\"\n\n\"What nonsense!\" exclaimed the girl blushing. \"There are plenty much\nprettier than I am....\"\n\n\"No, no; they all say no.\" Pablo vehemently declared, turning his\nblindfold eyes towards his cousin, as if he could see her even through\nhis bandages. \"They used to tell me so before, and I could not believe\nit; but now that I have seen the world and know what beauty is, I\nbelieve it--yes indeed I do. You are perfectly lovely; there is no\none--there can be no one more lovely.--Give me your hand.\" And he\ngrasped it eagerly in both of his.\n\n\"I laugh now,\" he went on, \"to think of my absurd blind man's vanity,\nof my foolish attempts to realize the true aspect of things without\nseeing them. I believe that as long as I live I shall never forget the\nsurprise that the reality was to me. Reality! Oh, the man who knows it\nnot is blind indeed, a perfect idiot!--Florentina I was an idiot.\"\n\n\"No, cousin, you were always very clever and so you are still. But do\nnot let your fancy work too vividly now. It will soon be time to go to\nbed. Don Teodoro particularly said that I was not to let you talk so\nlate, because it keeps you from sleeping; if you do not keep quiet I\nshall go away.\"\n\n\"Is it night already?\"\n\n\"Yes, quite night.\"\n\n\"But day or night I love to talk to you,\" Pablo persisted, tossing over\non his bed, on which he was lying dressed and very restless. \"I will be\nsilent on one condition, and that is that you do not go away from my\nside, and that, from time to time, you pat the bed with your hand that\nI may know that you are there.\"\n\n\"Very well, so I will, and this is the first sign of life,\" said\nFlorentina, laughing and patting the mattress.\n\n\"When I hear you laugh, I feel as if a breath of sweet fresh air blew\nround me, and all my senses help in some way to remind me of you. Your\nimage lives in my memory so vividly, that even with my eyes bandaged I\ncan see you still the same.\"\n\n\"Will you have done chattering or must I fetch Don Teodoro?\" said the\ngirl gaily.\n\n\"No, no--stay quiet. I cannot be silent--if I were to be silent all my\nthoughts--all I can see in my brain--would only torment me twice as\nmuch. And you want me to go to sleep! Sleep! But I have you in here,\nFlorentina, making a turmoil in my brain, and driving me crazy. I am so\nfull of joy and rapture that I have no words to express them. All last\nnight I fancied I was talking to you and to Nela.--Poor little Nela! I\nam most curious to see her.--Desperately curious.\"\n\n\"Well, I will find her to-morrow. Now, have done with your talking; if\nyou do not cease I shall go.\"\n\n\"No, stop. I will only talk to myself. I will say all the things I say\nto you at night when I fancy we are alone together--I will remember\nwhat you say to me.\"\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"Well, the things I can fancy I hear said in your voice--Now, do you be\nsilent, Se\u00c3\u00b1orita. I am alone now with my own imaginings.\"\n\nThe next day when Florentina came up to her cousin's room, she said:\n\n\"I brought Maraquilla up here and she ran away. Ungrateful little\nthing!\"\n\n\"And you did not look for her?\"\n\n\"Where was I to look? She ran away from me. This evening I will go out\nagain and hunt her till I find her.\"\n\n\"No, no; do not go out,\" said Pablo eagerly. \"She will come back, she\nwill come of her own accord.\"\n\n\"She seems out of her mind.\"\n\n\"Does she know that I can see now?\"\n\n\"I myself told her. But really I am sure she has lost her wits. She\nsays that I am the Holy Virgin and kisses my dress.\"\n\n\"That shows that you have produced the same impression on her as on\nevery one else. Nela is so sweet. Poor little girl! We must take care\nof her, Florentina, and be kind to her--do not you think so?\"\n\n\"She is ungrateful I am afraid,\" said Florentina sadly.\n\n\"No, never think so. Nela could not be ungrateful. She is a good\nchild--I am very fond of her. She must be found and brought here to\nme.\"\n\n\"I will go.\"\n\n\"No--not you,\" said Pablo positively, taking his cousin's hand. \"Your\nduty, most undutiful cousin, is to take care of me. If Golfin does not\ncome soon to take off my bandage and put on my glasses, I shall do it\nmyself. I have not seen you since yesterday, and I cannot bear it--I\ncannot bear it. Is Don Teodoro come?\"\n\n\"He is down stairs with your father and mine. He will come up quite\nsoon. Have patience; you are as bad as a school-boy.\"\n\nPablo writhed with irritation.\n\n\"Light, light!\" he cried. \"It is a crime to keep me in the dark so\nlong. I cannot live like this--I shall die. I want what is the bread\nof life to me; I want the use of my eyes. I have not seen you to-day,\ncousin, and I am wild to see you. I am hungry, thirsty to see you.\nOh! thank God for real knowledge! Thank God for having created you,\nsweetest of women, a combination of every beauty.--And yet, if after\nhaving created beauty, God had not given us hearts to feel it, how\nimperfect his work would have been! Light! light!...\"\n\nTeodoro came up and opened the gates of the outer world to him, filling\nhis soul with joy, and he passed a quiet day talking of a variety of\nsubjects. Not till the evening did his thoughts revert to that point\nin his past life, which seemed to be diminishing and fading in the\ndistance, like vessels which on a clear day are lost on the horizon. It\nwas in the tone of a man who recalls some long past circumstance, that\nPablo asked: \"Has not Nela made her appearance?\"\n\nFlorentina replied that she had not, and they talked of other things.\n\nIn the course of the night, at a very late hour, Pablo heard the noise\nof voices in the house. He fancied he heard those of Teodoro Golfin, of\nFlorentina, and of his father. But after that he slept quietly, though\nhaunted in his dreams by the images of all he had seen and the phantoms\nof all he imagined. His dreams, which began tranquilly and smilingly,\nafterwards became agitated and painful, for in some deep recess of\nhis soul, as though it were a vast cavern suddenly lighted up, rose\na medley array of the beautiful and the hideous forms of the outside\nworld--of passions awakened and memories buried--convulsing his whole\nsoul. The following day, as Golfin had promised, he left his room to\nmove about the house.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nEYES THAT KILL.\n\n\nThe room which had been assigned to Florentina at Aldeacorba was the\npleasantest in the house. No one had used it since the death of Pablo's\nmother; but Don Francisco, deeming his niece worthy to be lodged\nthere, had the room neatly arranged and added some little elegancies\nwhich had been quite unknown to it in his wife's lifetime. The balcony\nlooked southwards and over the garden, so that the room was always\nflooded with light and perfume, and cheered by the happy song of birds.\nFlorentina herself, during her few days' stay, had given it the stamp,\nso to speak, of her own individuality; all sorts of small properties\nand trifles betrayed the nature of the woman who lived in it, as you\nmay know a bird by its nest. If there are some persons who would make a\nhell of a palace, so there are others who have only to enter a hovel to\nmake it a Paradise.\n\nIt was that very stormy day--I say that day, for I cannot name the\ndate; I only know that it was a day. It had rained all the morning;\nthen the sky had cleared, and at last, high above the misty whiteness\nof the lower atmosphere, a rainbow threw its glorious arch. One end\nrested on the oaks of Fic\u00c3\u00b3briga, close to the sea, and the other on\nthe woods of Saldeoro. Supreme in its simplicity the rainbow can be\ncompared to nothing else, any more than an absolutely ideal and typical\nform can be. A rainbow is the epitome, the alpha and omega, of visible\ncolor.\n\nFlorentina was in her room, not threading beads, nor embroidering\nsatin with gold thread, but cutting out garments from patterns made\nof newspaper. She was squatting on the floor, in the attitudes of a\nfidgetty child at play; now sitting on her heels, now on all fours, and\nplying the scissors without a moment's respite. By her side was a heap\nof pieces of woollen stuff, calico, cotton print, and other materials\nthat she had been, that very morning, to buy at Villamojada, in spite\nof wind and weather; and snipping here, and cutting there, she was fast\nevolving sleeves, skirts, and bodies. They were not perhaps models of\ndressmaking, nor was the exactitude of the patterns to be entirely\nrelied on, for they also were of her own devising; however, she would\nhave been the first to acknowledge their shortcomings, and she hoped\nthat good-will might conduce to a happy result. Her worthy father had\nsaid to her, as he saw her sitting to work:\n\n\"Bless me, child! one would think there were no dressmakers in the\nworld. You cannot imagine how it annoys me to see a young lady of good\nposition crawling about on the floor with shears in her hands.--It\nis not at all the right thing. I cannot bear that you should work to\nclothe yourself even, and am I to submit to see you working for others?\nWhat are dressmakers for--heh? What are dressmakers for?\"\n\n\"A dressmaker would do it much better than I shall,\" replied Florentina\nlaughing. \"But then you see it would not be my doing, Papa; and to do\nit myself is the very thing I most want.\"\n\nHe left her to her own devices; but not alone, for in the middle of the\nalcove, between the bed and the wardrobe, stood an old-fashioned sofa\nand on the sofa lay two blankets, and at one end, on a pile of pillows,\nlay a weary little head. The face was haggard and colorless--asleep.\nSunk rather, in an uneasy lethargy, broken now and again by violent\nstarting and terrors. However, a calmer state had supervened by\nmid-day, when Florentina's father came into the room again, followed by\nGolfin. The surgeon went up to the sofa and leaned over Nela, watching\nher face.\n\n\"She seems to be sleeping more quietly now,\" he said: \"We must have no\nnoise.\"\n\n\"What do you think of my daughter?\" said Don Manuel, laughing. \"Do you\nsee all the trouble she is taking. Now be quite impartial, Don Teodoro:\nIs there any reason why she should vex me? Honestly, when there is\nno necessity for taking so much trouble, why should she do so? What\npleasure can it be to me to see my daughter wasting all I give her\nfor pin-money; wasting it on others; and besides this mania for low\noccupations--for low occupations....\"\n\n\"Let her please herself,\" replied Golfin, looking down admiringly at\nthe girl. \"Every young lady has her own way of wasting her pin-money.\"\n\n\"And I am not to object if her charity brings her to destitution, to\nbankruptcy!\" exclaimed Don Manuel, marching up and down the room in\npompous indignation, with his hands in his pockets. \"Besides, is there\nno better method of charity than this? She wished to show her gratitude\nto God for my nephew's recovery--well and good--very proper, a very\nChristian feeling. But we shall see, we shall see.\"\n\nHe stopped in front of Nela and looked at her kindly.\n\n\"Now, would it not have been better,\" he said, \"if, instead of\nbringing this poor girl into the house, my daughter had organized\none of those grand charitable affairs, which are the fashion even at\ncourt, and which give all the best people in society an opportunity\nof displaying their good feeling? Why did you not think of holding a\nlottery? We could easily have sold any number of tickets among our\nfriends, and have collected a handsome sum of money to give away to\ncharitable asylums. Why, you might have got up an association among\nthe gentry of Villamojada and the neighborhood, or have invited all\nour acquaintance at Santa Irene de Camp\u00c3\u00b3 to join you, and have held\nmeetings and collected a great deal of money.--Nay, why not have got\nup a bull-fight? I would have undertaken to provide the beasts and the\nmen.--Or amateur theatricals?--Last night Do\u00c3\u00b1a Sof\u00c3\u00ada and I were talking\nof that very thing. Learn from her, my dear, learn from her. The poor\nowe more to her than I can tell you. There are all the families who\nlive by the employment they get in working the lotteries--there are all\nthe professionals and subordinates who make money by the theatrical\nperformances! Oh! my dear, the paupers in the workhouse are not the\nonly poor! Sof\u00c3\u00ada told me that they made a little fortune out of the\nmasked balls they gave this winter. A good deal of it was spent, of\ncourse, in gas, in renting the theatre, in service, and so forth--still\nthere was a morsel of bread left for the poor after all.--But, if you\ndo not believe me, read the statistics, child--read the statistics.\"\n\nFlorentina laughed, and found no better answer than to repeat the\nsurgeon's apology for her:\n\n\"Every young lady has her own way of wasting her pin-money.\"\n\n\"But Don Teodoro,\" remonstrated Don Manuel, in great disgust: \"You must\nadmit that no one else does it as my daughter does.\"\n\n\"I quite admit it,\" said Golfin with meaning, and looking at the girl:\n\"No one is like Florentina.\"\n\n\"And yet--with all her faults,\" said the father, drawing her to him:\n\"With all her faults, I love her better than my life. This little hussy\nis worth her weight in gold.--Come, tell me, which do you like best,\nAldeacorba de Suso, or Santa Irene de Camp\u00c3\u00b3?\"\n\n\"I do not dislike Aldeacorba.\"\n\n\"Ah! little puss. I see which way the wind blows. Do you know that at\nthis very moment my brother is talking seriously to his son? Family\naffairs! Well, and something very good is to come of it all--look, Don\nTeodoro, at my daughter's face; it is as red as roses in May. Now, I\nam off to hear what my brother has to say--what my brother has to say.\"\nAnd the worthy man departed.\n\nGolfin went back to Nela.\n\n\"Did she sleep last night?\" he asked.\n\n\"Very little. I heard her sobbing and crying all night. But to-night\nshe shall have a good bed, for which I have sent to Villamojada, and I\nwill put her in the little room next to mine.\"\n\n\"Poor little Nela!\" said the doctor. \"You cannot imagine what an\ninterest I feel in this hapless creature. Some people would laugh at\nit, but we, at any rate, are not made of stone. What little we have\ndone to improve the condition of this poor child, ought to be done\nfor a large proportion of the human race. There are many thousands of\nbeings in the world in the same plight as Nela. Who knows them? where\nare they? They are lost in the desert of society--for society has its\ndeserts--in the dark places of life, in the solitudes of field labor,\nin mines, in factories. We pass them without even seeing them--we\ngive them alms, perhaps, but without knowing them.--How are we to be\ncognizant of so base a class of humanity! At first Nela attracted\nme because I thought that hers was an exceptional nature; but, as\nI have thought more, I have felt that hers is after all only one of\nthe commonest cases. It is an instance of the condition to which a\nhighly-organized moral nature must be reduced, a nature apt for good,\napt for learning, apt for virtue, but which can never develop its\npowers in the neglect and isolation to which it is condemned. They live\nblind in spirit, just as Pablo Pen\u00c3\u00a1guilas lived blind in body, though\nhe possessed the latent faculty of sight.\"\n\nFlorentina was listening with eager sympathy and intelligence to the\nsurgeon's speech.\n\n\"Look at her,\" he went on: \"There she lies; she has a beautiful fancy,\nacute feelings, and can love with devotion and tenderness. She is\ngifted with a remarkable aptitude for every grace of mind, while, at\nthe same time, she is full of the grossest superstitions; her religious\nideas are vague, monstrous, and heterodox, and her moral sense needs\nguidance as much as her natural intelligence. She has had no education\nbut what she has been able to give herself; like a tree that gets no\nnourishment but that of its own withered and fallen leaves, she owes\nabsolutely nothing to any one else. In all her life she has never been\ntaught a single lesson, never heard a word of loving counsel, nor a\nprecept of pious dogma; she is guided entirely by ill-understood\nexamples which she adapts to her own instincts and desires. Her\ncriticisms are all her own, and as she is full of imagination and\nfeeling, and the strongest native impulse of her soul is to worship\nsomething, she has worshipped Nature, after the fashion of primitive\nraces. All her ideals are naturalistic--and if you do not quite\nunderstand what I mean, dear Florentina, I must explain myself more\nexactly another time.\n\n\"She has a really artistic passion for form and beauty. Her whole\nnature and her affections all centre round this idea. The gifts\nand graces of the mind are to her an unknown realm of beauty, a\nhardly-discovered land, of which she knows only so much as some\ntraveller might of a new country on whose shores he had been\nshipwrecked. The great news of the gospel--the greatest achievement\nof the spirit of humanity--has hardly even sounded in her ears; she\nhas the same faint suspicion of it that Asiatic nations may have\nof European culture--and if you do not quite understand me, dear\nFlorentina, I must explain myself more exactly another time.\n\n\"But she is very capable of making rapid progress in a short time, and\nof rising to a higher level, nay to our own. Show her a little light\nand she will fly across the centuries--she has wandered from the\ntrack, and cannot see far, but give her light and she will find her\nway again. No one yet has ever put the torch in her hand, for Pablo\nPen\u00c3\u00a1guilas, in his own ignorance of all external truth, contributed\nlargely but unconsciously to increase her errors. Such a fantastic\nand extravagant idealist was not the best master for a nature like\nhers. We must set truth before the poor child, who is like a being\nraised from the dead of a remote past; we will teach her to know the\ngraces of the mind; we will bring her down to our own century; we will\ngive her soul a strength which as yet it has not, and put a noble\nChristian conscience in the place of her savage naturalism and wild\nsuperstitions. We have an admirable field to work in, a virgin soil\non which to sow the seed of centuries of growth. We may make time fly\nfast over her head, showing her the truth it has revealed, and so\ncreate a new being--for indeed, dear Florentina, it is the same thing\nas creating a new being--and if you do not quite understand me, I must\nexplain myself more exactly another time.\"\n\nFlorentina, though she made no pretensions to learning, thought that\nshe did understand what Golfin had meant by his quaint and original\nharangue. She herself was about to add some remarks on the subject; but\nat that moment Nela woke. Her eyes timidly wandered round the room, and\nthen rested alternately on the two faces that looked down at her.\n\n\"You are not frightened?\" said Florentina gently.\n\n\"Frightened--no Se\u00c3\u00b1ora; you are very kind--and the Se\u00c3\u00b1or too.\"\n\n\"Are you not glad to be here? what are you afraid of?\"\n\nGolfin took her hand. \"Speak frankly and truly,\" he said: \"Which of us\ndo you like best--Florentina or me?\"\n\nNela made no reply, and the others smiled; but the child remained\nmoodily grave.\n\n\"Now, listen to me, you silly little thing,\" the surgeon went on: \"You\nhave to make up your mind to live with one of us. Florentina will stay\nhere; I shall go away. Decide for one or the other--which do you like\nbest.\"\n\nMarianela looked from one to the other without finding any definite\nanswer; finally her eyes rested on those of Golfin.\n\n\"I believe I am the man of her choice.--But that is not fair to\nFlorentina, Nela; she will be vexed.\"\n\nThe poor child smiled and, putting out a feeble hand to Florentina, she\nmurmured:\n\n\"I do not want to vex her.\"\n\nBut even while she spoke she turned ashy pale; she strained her neck,\nher eyes seemed starting out of her head--she was listening to a sound\nthat was full of terrors to her. She had heard footsteps.\n\n\"He is coming!\" exclaimed Golfin, sympathizing in his patient's alarm.\n\n\"Yes, here he comes!\" cried Florentina, and she flew to the door.\n\nIt was he. Pablo had opened the door and walked softly into the\nroom--straight in, from the habit he had acquired during years of\nblindness. He came in smiling, and his eyes, freed from the bandage,\nwhich he had himself removed, looked straight before him. They were as\nyet unaccustomed to the muscular action which makes them turn, and were\nhardly aware of objects lying out of the direct line of vision. It was\nliterally true of him--as it is of many who never were blind in their\nlives--that he only saw what was directly under his eyes.\n\n\"Cousin!\" said he going towards her: \"Why have you not been to see me\nto-day? I have had to come to look for you. Your father told me you\nwere doing some work for the poor--so I suppose I must forgive you.\"\n\nFlorentina did not know what to say; she was annoyed. Pablo had not\nobserved either Golfin or Nela, and Florentina, intending to keep him\nfrom approaching the sofa, went towards the window; then, picking up\nsome pieces of stuff, she sat down as if she were going to sew. The\nfull light of the sun fell upon her, shedding a vivid glow on all\nher left side and giving the most charming relief to her pretty head\nwith its russet brown hair. Her beauty seemed radiant; like the very\npersonification and incarnation of light. Her hair was somewhat in\ndisorder, and her thin morning dress followed the graceful lines of her\nslender figure, while her simple and dignified pose was worthy of the\nnoblest ideals of art.\n\n\"Cousin,\" she said with a slight frown on her pretty brow, \"Don Teodoro\nhas not yet given you leave to-day to take your bandage off. That is\nnot right.\"\n\n\"He will give me leave presently,\" said the young man laughing. \"And\nit cannot hurt me; I am really quite well. And if it did do me harm, I\nshould not care.--No, I should not care if I became blind again, after\nhaving seen you.\"\n\n\"And what good would that be to you?\" said Florentina reprovingly.\n\n\"I was alone in my room, my father is gone out--after speaking to me\nabout you. You know what he said.\"\n\n\"No, I know nothing about it,\" said the girl, with her eyes fixed on\nher work.\n\n\"But I know.--My father is very kind and reasonable, and we are very\nfond of each other.... Well, when my father had left me, I took off\nthe bandage and looked out at the fields; I saw the rainbow and I\nfelt quite overcome with admiration, and with religious feeling too,\nFlorentina--I do not know why that grand spectacle, which I had never\nseen before, should have given me so intense a feeling of the harmony\nof creation. I do not know why, looking at the perfect blending of\nits colors, I could not help thinking of you. I do not know why, as\nI saw the rainbow, I said to myself: 'I have felt this all before.'\nI felt again exactly as I felt when I first saw you, Florentina, my\ndarling. My heart seemed ready to burst my bosom, and I could not help\ncrying. I cried a great deal and my tears blinded me again for a few\nminutes--I called you and you did not answer--when I could see again,\nthe rainbow had vanished. I went to look for you, I thought you were\nin the garden--I went down stairs, up stairs, and here I am. And now,\nhere, I find you so lovely that I feel as if I had never seen you\nrightly till to-day--never till to-day, because now I have had time\nto learn to compare you with others. I have seen several women, and\nthey are all horrible by your side. I find it hard to believe that\nyou have lived through the years of my blindness.--Nay, nay. What I\nbelieve is that you came into being at the moment when light dawned\nupon my comprehension; that my own mind created you at the moment when\nI first was lord of the visible world. They had often told me that\nthere was not a living creature to compare with you, and I would not\nbelieve it--but I believe it now, as surely as I believe in the light\nof heaven!\"\n\nAnd as he spoke he fell on one knee.\n\nFlorentina, startled and abashed, looked up from her sewing.\n\n\"Cousin--for pity's sake!\" she murmured.\n\n\"Cousin for pity's sake!\" exclaimed Pablo, with frank enthusiasm.\n\"Why, why, are you so lovely? My father is most reasonable; I can say\nnothing against his arguments or his kindness.--Florentina, do you\nknow I thought I could never love you; I thought I could love some\none--not you. But what can I do? Thank God my love and my reason are\none! My father, to whom I confessed my mistake; told me that I had\nloved a hideous monster. But now I can say that I worship an angel. The\nignorant blind man can see, and at last pay due homage to real beauty.\nAnd yet I cannot help trembling--do you not see me tremble?--Seeing you\nI have but one desire, and that is, to take you in my arms and clasp\nyou to my heart, enfolding you, holding you tightly--very tightly.\"\n\nAnd Pablo, who was now kneeling on both knees, clasped his arms across\nhis breast.\n\n\"Oh! I do not know what I feel!\" he went on, stammering, and turning\npale with agitation. \"Every day I discover some new world, Florentina.\nFirst I discovered the world of light, to-day I have discovered\nanother. Is it possible that you, so lovely--so divine--are to be mine,\nthe wife of my heart?\"\n\nHe seemed about to fall to the ground in a fainting-fit, and Florentina\nleaned forward to support him. Pablo took her hand, then lifting her\nwide loose sleeve, he kissed her wrist and arm with eager passion,\ncounting the kisses.\n\n\"One--two--three--four--ah! I am dying!\"\n\n\"Be quiet, stop,\" cried Florentina, standing up, and making her cousin\nrise too. \"Doctor Golfin will you scold him.\"\n\n\"Your bandage on, at once!\" cried Teodoro: \"Go to your room and keep\nquiet.\"\n\nThe young man, in the utmost confusion turned to that side of the room\nand brought his eyes to bear on the surgeon, standing by the sofa that\nwas covered with blankets.\n\n\"Are you here, Don Teodoro?\" he said going up to him.\n\n\"Yes, I am here,\" said Golfin very gravely. \"You ought to go back to\nyour room and put the bandage on again. I will go with you.\"\n\n\"I am perfectly well--but, of course, I will obey--only, first let me\nsee what is here.\"\n\nHe was looking at the blankets and, between them, at a ghastly head,\nanything but fair to look upon. In fact Nela's nose seemed to have\nbecome sharper, her eyes smaller, her mouth less well-formed, her face\nmore freckled, her hair thinner, and her forehead lower. Her eyes were\nclosed, she breathed with difficulty, her livid lips were parted, and\nthe hapless child seemed to be at her last gasp, with the look of death\non her face already.\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Pablo: \"My father told me that Florentina had given\nshelter to some poor creature. How good of her! You--poor child, you\nmay be thankful, for you have fallen into the hands of an angel!--Are\nyou ill? In my house you shall want for nothing; my cousin is the very\nimage of God on earth.--This poor child is very ill; is she not doctor?\"\n\n\"Yes ...\" said Golfin, \"she must be left alone and hear no more\ntalking.\"\n\n\"Then I am gone.\"\n\nPablo put out his hand and laid it on the head which seemed to his\nunaccustomed eyes the most terrible symbol of all human misery and\nwretchedness. Nela raised her eyes and fixed them on her master. Pablo\nfelt as if they gazed at him from the depths of a tomb, so profound was\ntheir expression of sorrow and despair; then Nela freed one hand from\nbeneath the coverings--a feeble, burning, rough little hand--and took\nthat of the young man. At her touch Pablo shuddered from head to foot,\nand uttered a cry that came from his very soul.\n\nThere was a terrible pause--one of those lulls which precede the\ncatastrophes of life as they do the convulsions of nature, as though to\nadd to their solemnity.\n\nThen, in a quavering voice that thrilled the by-standers with its\ntragical sadness, Nela spoke:\n\n\"Yes, _Se\u00c3\u00b1orito mio_,\" she said, \"I am Nela.\"\n\nSlowly, and as if she were lifting some too heavy weight, she raised\nher master's hand to her dry lips and kissed it--kissed it again--and\nthen, with a third attempt, her lips remained motionless on the lad's\nhand.\n\nThey were all silent--looking at her. The first to break the silence\nwas Pablo.\n\n\"Is this you ...\" he said, \"you....\" And the thoughts that crowded on\nhis mind checked his utterance of any. He would have liked to discover\nsome new language in which to utter them, just as he had already\ndiscovered the two new worlds--of light, and of the love of external\nbeauty. He could do nothing but look at her--look at Nela and remember\nthat darkened world in which he had lived, his passions and the dreams\nand errors of his blindness all wandering and lost in its obscurity.\nFlorentina, wiping away her tears, leaned over Nela to look into her\nface, and Golfin, watching her and knowing too well what he saw,\nexclaimed in a voice like a knell:\n\n\"It has killed her. The sight of you has killed her!\"--then turning to\nPablo he said sternly: \"Go, at once, to your room.\"\n\n\"Dying! dying so, without any cause!\" cried Florentina in despair, and\nlaying her hand lightly on Nela's brow.\n\n\"Mar\u00c3\u00ada!\" she said, \"Marianela!\"\n\nShe called her by her name again and again, leaning over her and\nlooking at her, as we might look over the margin of a well at some one\nwho has fallen into it and who is drowning in the depth and blackness\nof its waters.\n\n\"She does not answer!\" said Pablo, horror-stricken.\n\nGolfin, watching her ebbing vitality, perceived that her pulse still\nthrobbed under his touch. Pablo bent over her, and putting his lips\nclose to her ear, he called her once more:\n\n\"Nela, Nela my friend--my dear!\"\n\nShe turned a little, opened her eyes, and moved her hands. She looked\nas if her spirit had returned from some far away flight. Seeing Pablo's\ngaze fixed upon her with anxious curiosity, she turned aside abashed\nand alarmed, and tried to hide her face as if she were a guilty thing.\n\n\"What is the matter with her?\" asked Florentina vehemently. \"Don\nTeodoro, save her if you are a man.--If you do not save her you are a\ncharlatan!...\"\n\nThe young girl's charitable instincts were spurring her to positive\nrage.\n\n\"Nela!\" repeated the lad in the deepest distress, and not yet recovered\nfrom the shock which the sight of his little comrade had given him:\n\"You seem to be afraid of me--what have I done to you?\"\n\nThe dying girl put out her hand to clasp Florentina's, and pressed it\nto her breast, and then she did the same with Pablo's; afterwards she\nonce more pressed them both with all the strength she could command.\nHer sunken eyes looked from one to the other, but her gaze was vague\nand remote; it seemed to come from some inner depth of darkness and\ndespair, as though she were indeed the drowning wretch in the well,\nsinking lower every instant. Suddenly her breathing became difficult;\nshe sighed, and clutched the two hands she held with convulsive energy.\n\nTeodoro had turned the house upside down; had sent for medicines and\npowerful stimulants, and was doing all in his power to arrest the swift\nextinction of this young life.\n\n\"It is hard,\" he said, \"to stop a drop of water that is trickling,\nfalling away--down, down, and within an inch or two of the great\nSea.--But I will try.\"\n\nHe sent away every one but Florentina, whom he kept in the room. But\nthe stimulants and irritants with which he endeavored to bring back\nebbing life to the frail body, only served to restore some little\nmuscular action, and in spite of this she was sinking every minute.\n\n\"It is cruelty!\" cried Golfin desperately, as he snatched away the\nmustard and the irritants. \"We are tormentors and torturers. It is like\nsetting dogs on a dying man that the pain may keep him alive to suffer.\nAway with it all!\"\n\n\"And is there nothing to be done?\"\n\n\"Nothing--but what God will do.\"\n\n\"But what is the matter with her?\"\n\n\"Death!\" he shouted with a delirious rage of grief, ill-befitting a\nmedical man.\n\n\"But what illness is it that has brought her to death?\"\n\n\"Death!\" he repeated.\n\n\"You do not understand me; I want to know of what...?\"\n\n\"Of death.--How can I tell you whether it is shame, or jealousy, or\nwounded pride, or grief, or disappointed love, that has killed her? A\nstrange catalogue of symptoms! No, no--we know nothing--nothing but\nuseless details.\"\n\n\"What! Doctors!\"\n\n\"I tell you we know nothing--a little on the surface that is all.\"\n\n\"And this, what is this?\"\n\n\"A sudden attack of inflammation--meningitis perhaps.\"\n\n\"And what is that?\"\n\n\"A name.... Death!\"\n\n\"But is it possible that any one should die--like this--without any\nknown cause, without any sort of disease? Oh! Don Teodoro, what is the\nmatter with her?\"\n\n\"How should I know?\"\n\n\"But you are a doctor?\"\n\n\"Of eyes--not of passions.\"\n\n\"Passions!\" exclaimed Florentina, looking down at the senseless girl.\n\"You--poor child--what passions are you dying of?\"\n\n\"Ask your future husband.\"\n\nFlorentina stood lost in utter amazement.\n\n\"Poor thing!\" she cried with a choked sob. \"Can mere grief kill in this\nway?\"\n\n\"When I picked her up at _la Trascava_ she was in a high fever.\"\n\n\"But that is not enough; no, not enough to kill her!\"\n\n\"You say it is not enough. God and Nature say that it is.\"\n\n\"It is as if she had been stabbed.\"\n\n\"Remember what those eyes--now closing forever--saw a short while\nsince. Remember that a blind man loved her and that he is blind no\nlonger; that he has seen her--seen her! The shock was a death-blow....\"\n\n\"Oh what a terrible mysterious....\"\n\n\"No, it is no mystery,\" cried the surgeon, almost wildly. \"It is the\nawful collapse of an illusion; the rude blow of reality; the miserable\ndestroyer which has come between two noble souls. And I--I brought that\nreality home to them!\"\n\n\"Oh it is a wretched mystery!\" repeated Florentina, not understanding\nthe current of his thoughts.\n\n\"A mystery? No,\" repeated Teodoro with increasing agitation: \"It is\nbare reality; the sudden swallowing up of a whole world of illusions.\nReality to him meant a new life--to her, anguish, suffocation,\nhumiliation, sorrow, contempt, an empty life, jealousy,--Death!\"\n\n\"And all for....\"\n\n\"And all for one pair of eyes opened to see light--and reality.\nReality! I cannot get the word out of my brain. It seems to be written\nthere in letters of fire.\"\n\n\"All for one pair of eyes.--And grief can kill so quickly--without\ngiving us time to try a remedy?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" said Golfin, bewildered, confounded, helpless, in view\nof the mystic characters of the Book of Life and Death, which science\nmay pore over but may not decipher its dark riddle.\n\n\"You do not know!\" cried Florentina desperately. \"Then why are you a\ndoctor?\"\n\n\"I do not know, I do not know!\" he reiterated, striking his dishevelled\nhead with his heavy hands.--\"Yes, one thing I know, and that is that we\nknow nothing but the skin-deep phenomena of life. I--I am a mender of\neyes and nothing more.\"\n\nHe fixed his gaze with absorbed attention on the little figure which\nwas hovering on the border-land between a living woman and a corpse.\n\"Soul!\" he exclaimed in a tone of bitter questioning: \"What is passing\nin you now?\"\n\nFlorentina burst into tears.\n\n\"The soul!\" she murmured, and her head drooped on her breast: \"It is\nfled!\"\n\n\"No ...\" said Teodoro, taking Nela's hand. \"There is still some life\nleft--but so little, that it would seem as if the soul were indeed far\naway and had left only the breath behind.\"\n\n\"Lord have mercy!\" exclaimed the young girl and began to pray.\n\n\"Alas! hapless spirit!\" murmured the surgeon. \"You were but ill-lodged\nindeed....\"\n\nThey both bent over her, watching her closely.\n\n\"Her lips are moving,\" cried Florentina. \"She is speaking.\"\n\nYes, her lips parted; she said something--a word, two, three.\n\n\"What is she saying?\" each asked the other; but neither of them could\nunderstand her.\n\nShe spoke perhaps in the tongue that is known to those who live the\nlife eternal.\n\nThis was the end; her lips moved no more; they remained half-open\nshowing a row of little white teeth. Teodoro bent over her and, kissing\nNela's forehead, he said in a steady voice:\n\n\"Woman, you did well to quit this world.\" But Florentina's voice was\nchoked with tears and sobs as she said: \"I wanted to make her happy,\nand she would not be.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nFAREWELL.\n\n\nStrange and wonderful to tell! Nela, who had never in her life had a\nroom, nor clothes, nor shoes, nor food, nor sympathy, nor relations,\nnor any earthly thing of her own, not even a name--was buried in\na style which caused no small amount of envy among the living in\nSocartes. This posthumous splendor was the bitterest irony ever known\nin these metalliferous regions. Se\u00c3\u00b1orita Florentina, acting on her\ngenerous impulses, consoled herself for the disappointment of not\nhaving been able to help Nela alive, by the satisfaction of doing honor\nto her hapless remains after death. Some hard-hearted materialists\ncriticised her severely; but, for our part, we regarded it as an\nadditional proof of her refined kind-heartedness.\n\nWhen Nela was carried to the grave, the curious who came to gaze at\nher, thought her almost pretty--wonderful to say! At least so they\nsaid. It was the first time a compliment had ever been paid her. The\nfuneral was magnificent, and the priests of Villamojada opened their\nmouths wide in astonishment when they found themselves receiving money\nto pray for the soul of La Canela's daughter. It was bewildering,\namazing, to think that a being whose social importance had been about\nequal to that of a worm or a fly, should prove the occasion of so much\nburning of tapers, of so much hanging of drapery, and of making so many\nchoristers and sacristans hoarse. Nay, it was so astounding as to be\npositively amusing; nothing else was talked of for at least six weeks.\n\nThe surprise, and indeed--to be frank--the indignation of this worthy\nlittle world, culminated one day when two waggons, loaded with enormous\nblocks of fine white stone, were descried approaching by the high-road.\nIn Se\u00c3\u00b1ana's mind, particularly, a hideous subversion of ideas took\nplace, a cataclysm resulting in mental chaos, when she brought herself\nto believe that those fine white stones were to build Nela's tomb. If\nan ox had taken to flying or her husband to making speeches, it could\nnot have roused her from her stupefaction.\n\nThe parish registers of Villamojada were searched, for of course it\nwas indispensable that she should have a name now she was dead, though\nshe had done without one during her life; as is proved by this very\nhistory, where she has borne various names. And this indispensable\nrequisite having been found, and duly placed on the records of the\ndead, the magnificent tomb, which stood up proudly among the rustic\ncrosses of the graveyard at Aldeacorba, had this epitaph engraved on it:\n\n         R. I. P.\n\n  MAR\u00c3\u008dA MANUELA TELLEZ.\n\n   RECALLED TO HEAVEN\n\n  October the 12th, 186 ...\n\nAnd a wreath of flowers prettily carved in the marble, crowned the\ninscription. Many months later, when Florentina and Pablo Pen\u00c3\u00a1guilas\nhad been some time married and no one--to tell the truth, for truth is\nthe first consideration--no one in Aldeacorba de Suso remembered Nela\nany longer, some travellers of the tourist genus, in crossing that part\nof the country, happened to observe the grand marble sepulchre erected\nin the cemetery by the piety and affection of an exemplary friend,\nand were struck with admiration. Without more ado they proceeded to\nwrite down in their note-book these remarks, which were subsequently\npublished under the title of \"Sketches from Cant\u00c3\u00a1bria,\" in an English\nnewspaper.\n\n\"The most remarkable object to be seen at Aldeacorba is a magnificent\nmonument, erected in the cemetery over the grave of a young lady of\nrank, famous in that part of the country for her beauty. Do\u00c3\u00b1a Mariquita\nManuela Tellez belonged to one of the noblest and wealthiest families\nin Cant\u00c3\u00a1bria, that of Tellez Giron y de Trastamara. Witty, romantic,\nand capricious, she took a fancy to wander about the roads, playing\nthe guitar and singing Calderon's odes, and she would dress herself up\nin rags to enable her to mix with the herd of beggars, pick-pockets,\ntroubadours, bull-fighters, friars, _hidalgos_, gypsies, and muleteers,\nwhich at the great _kermesas_, constitute that motley scene of Spanish\nlow life which still exists and always must exist, independent and\npicturesque, in spite of the railways and newspapers which have begun\nto force their way into the Spanish Peninsula.\n\n\"The _abad_[6] of Villamojada wept as he told us of the whims, the\nvirtues, and the beauty of this wealthy gentlewoman, who, whenever\nshe appeared at the balls, banquets, or _ca\u00c3\u00b1as_ of Madrid, was\ndistinguished for her aristocratic deportment. The number of\n_romanceros_, sonnets and madrigals composed in honor of this noble\ndamsel by all the Spanish poets, is beyond all calculation.\"[7]\n\nOn reading this I saw at once that the worthy reporters had dreamed\ndreams. I determined to tell the truth, and the truth, as I have told\nit, has resulted in this book.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe must now bid farewell forever to this tomb. We will fix our eyes on\nanother object, seek out another figure--searching diligently, for he\nwhom we want is but a small personage, a minute insect, as it were, no\nlarger on the face of the earth than the Phylloxera on the vine. But we\nhave found him--there he is, tiny, squalid, a mere atomy. But he lives\nand breathes, and will grow great in time. Listen to his story, for it\nis an interesting one I promise you.\n\nWell, Sir....\n\nBut no; it does not belong to this book.

RAMOS DIAZ DE VILLEGAS\n\n\n\"Spanish is not under any circumstances a difficult language to\nlearn. It has in its construction and pronunciation an encouraging\ndirectness very unlike the grammatical involutions of German and the\ndelicate sound-shadings of French. Working in accordance with the\nrules of almost any 'system,' a diligent student can in a very little\nwhile acquire a fair mastery of the language; though it is true that\nsome of the 'systems' are much more difficult than others. One of the\nsimplest and best of them all is 'A Practical Method for Learning\nSpanish,' by Se\u00c3\u00b1or A. Ramos Diaz de Villegas, just now published by\nWilliam S. Gottsberger, New York. The 'method' of Se\u00c3\u00b1or de Villegas\ncomprehends a collection of anecdotes arranged in short lines with an\nEnglish translation, similarly arranged, on the corresponding opposite\npage; familiar phrases, with idiomatic renderings in English in\nparallel columns; a vocabulary of words in common use, and a complete\nlist of the Spanish irregular verbs. It will be observed that this\nmethod hardly can be called original; that it is more or less that of\nMorales, of Velazquez, of Prendergast, and that some of its features\nare found in Ollendorff and in Ahn; but in simplicity of arrangement\nand directness of purpose it is superior to all of these--Prendergast\npossibly excepted. It certainly is what it is called--a practical\nmethod for learning Spanish.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.  Email\ncontact links and up to date contact information can be found at the\nFoundation's web site and official page at www.gutenberg.org\/contact\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1141,"split":"test"}
