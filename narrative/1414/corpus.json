As she leaves, Charlie pushes a note into her hand. She reads that it says he will be in their old meeting place at eight o' clock. She meets him in a garden. After some playful conversation, Charlie introduces her to her first sexual experience. Father Ambrose, who had been hiding in the shrubs, surprises them afterward, scolding both of them for their behaviour and threatening to reveal what they have been doing to their guardians. Bella pleads for mercy. Father Ambrose, appearing to relent, tells Bella to meet him in the sacristy at two o'clock the next day and Charlie to meet him at the same time the day after that. Ambrose instructs Bella into a way she may be absolved of her sins and blackmails her into sex with him, lest he tell her guardian what she was up to. Then Ambrose's colleagues, the Fr Superior & Fr Clement, catch them in the act, and they demand equal rights to Bella's favours. And so Bella is introduced to serving the Holy community in a special way.\nDespite his promises, Ambrose goes to see Bella's uncle, Monsieur Verbouc and tells of her lewd behaviour. This leads to her uncle, who has long entertained lustful thoughts of his niece, attempting to force himself on Bella. The narrator then intervenes, biting him to put a damper on his ardour.\nNext, Father Clement, looking for Bella's room, climbs into the window of Bella's aunt, the pious Madame Verbouc, who had mistaken him for her husband. M. Verbouc then bursts in and his wife realises she's actually been making love to the randy priest.\nBella's friend, Julia Delmont, becomes Ambrose's next target. By now completely corrupted and happy to go along with whatever Ambrose suggests, Bella readily agrees to the Father's next scheme: She will offer herself to Monsieur Delmont, on condition that her face is covered. The trick is that it will not be Bella who lies there, but Delmont's own daughter. Father Ambrose seduces her and says he will come to her by night and make love to her, but she must hide her face.\nWhen the act is consummated, Bella appears and pretends that it was all a big mistake. But since Delmont has now potentially impregnated his daughter, the only way to be sure his incest cannot be discovered is to have all make love to her as well. In case she is pregnant, nobody can claim that her own father is the father.\nBella and Julia eventually become nuns, and the book ends as they participate in an orgy with 19 priests.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Flea, by Harold Russell\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most\nother parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions\nwhatsoever.

I have avoided, whenever I\ncould, using the technical terms of zoology. To avoid doing so entirely\nis impossible in a book which describes insects in some detail. No\ntechnical term has, I hope, been used without an explanation.\n\nOver thirty years have elapsed since Taschenberg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s German book, _Die\nFl\u00c3\u00b6he_, appeared. Our knowledge has made enormous strides since then.\nMore species of flea are now known from the British Islands alone\nthan were then known from the whole world. So far as I am aware, no\nbook, devoted to what is known about fleas, has ever been published in\nEnglish. The statements about these insects in the general text-books\nof entomology are frequently antiquated and inaccurate. But there is\na fairly extensive literature on the _Siphonaptera_ scattered through\nscientific periodicals mostly in English, German, Italian, Dutch and\nRussian. I have given some references in the Bibliography.\n\nThe naturalists now living who have devoted any time to the special\nstudy of fleas may almost be counted on one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fingers. In England there\nare Mr Charles Rothschild and Dr Jordan; in the Shetland Islands, the\nRev. James Waterston; in Germany, Taschenberg of Halle and Dampf of\nK\u00c3\u00b6nigsberg; in Russia, Wagner of Kieff; in Holland, Oudemans of Arnhem;\nin Italy, Tiraboschi of Rome; in the United States, Carl Baker and a\nfew others. I have not mentioned medical men who have investigated\nfleas in connection with plague.\n\nThere are small collections of fleas in the Natural History Museums at\nSouth Kensington (London), Paris, Berlin, K\u00c3\u00b6nigsberg, Vienna, Budapest,\nS. Petersburg and Washington. Of private collections Mr Charles\nRothschild\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at Tring is by far the best in the world. It contains\nsomething like a hundred thousand specimens and is most admirably kept.\nI must express profound and sincere gratitude to Mr Rothschild for\nhaving helped me in numberless ways and advised me in many difficulties.\n\nIt is well known that the mere mention of fleas is not only considered\na subject for merriment, but in some people produces, by subjective\nsuggestion, violent irritation of the skin. The scientific study\nof fleas has, however, received a great impetus since it has been\nascertained that they are the active agents in spreading plague.\nRat-fleas are of various kinds, and not all fleas will bite man. A\nknowledge of the different species has suddenly become useful. The\nhumble, but ridiculous, systematist with his glass tubes of alcohol for\ncollecting fleas, his microscopic distinctions, and Latin nomenclature\nhas become a benefactor of humanity. Some people seem to be practically\nimmune to the bites of fleas, but even to such persons their visits are\nunwelcome. A famous Frenchwoman once declared: \u00e2\u0080\u009c_Quant \u00c3\u00a0 moi ce n\u00e2\u0080\u0099est\npas la morsure, c\u00e2\u0080\u0099est la promenade._\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n                                                     H.

We call them insects because they are jointed\nanimals, or Arthropods, with three pairs of legs in the adult\ncondition. The reader will best understand the position which fleas\noccupy in the general classification of animals by remembering that\nthe arthropods, or jointed animals, are one of a dozen subkingdoms, or\nphyla, to which the various members of the great animal kingdom have\nbeen assigned. There is good ground for believing that all the animals\nincluded in each phylum trace their ancestry back to a common primitive\nform which lived in more or less remote ages. Besides (1) _Insects_,\nthe arthropods, or jointed animals, include (2) _Crustaceans_, such as\ncrabs, lobsters, shrimps, wood-lice, water-fleas and barnacles; (3)\n_Myriapods_, such as centipedes and millipedes; and (4) _Arachnids_,\nsuch as spiders, scorpions, mites and ticks. To all these varied forms\nof animal life fleas, and other insects, are therefore more or less\nnearly related.\n\nThe animals belonging to this large and important collection, which\ncompose the arthropod phylum, have certain common characteristic\nfeatures. We find a body made up of a series of more or less completely\nsimilar segments placed one behind the other. In this they resemble\ncertain worms which are far less highly organised. The body is\nelongated, symmetrical on either side, and the mouth and anus are at\nopposite ends. There is, however, an important advance on the segmented\nworms. Each typical segment carries a pair of appendages which are very\ndifferent from the foot-stumps that are found on certain worms. These\nappendages of arthropods are divisible into distinct limb-segments,\nseparated from one another by moveable joints, and acted upon by\nspecial muscles.\n\nThe common ancestor of all the various arthropods which are found\nliving on the earth to-day, was probably composed of a series of\nsegments each very similar to the last and each bearing a pair of very\nsimilar appendages. In the course of ages, these appendages have been\nastoundingly modified in form and in function. So it happens that\nwe find in the arthropods of the present day pairs of antenn\u00c3\u00a6, of\nmandibles and other mouth-parts, of pincers, of legs, of swimming-feet\nand of tail pieces which on close examination can all be traced back to\na common structure. The body-segments, also, have been strangely fused\ntogether and modified. All that has been so far said applies equally to\nfleas and to other insects.\n\nIt is of great interest, when one comes to make a minute study of\nthe form and external structure of a flea, to try and trace the\nmodifications that must have taken place in the course of descent from\nthe ancestral arthropod; but the relationship of fleas to other insects\nliving at the present day is of more immediate concern. Insects are\nhighly specialized arthropods and fleas are highly specialized insects.\nThis means that they have become vastly modified from the primitive\nancestral type and fitted thereby for a life among certain defined and\npeculiar surroundings.\n\nIt will be unnecessary to remind the reader who knows anything of\nzoology or of botany that all classification is now based on descent.\nSince naturalists have abandoned a belief in the special creation\nof the various species of animals now living on the earth and have\nconclusively shown that they have arisen by descent and modification\nfrom other forms, the problem is to reconstruct a vast genealogical\ntree. What then were the ancestors of the fleas and to what other\ninsects, in consequence, do they appear to be related?\n\nIt is probable that the ancestors of the fleas were winged insects, and\nthat the organs of flight were gradually lost, as they became useless,\nwhen a partially parasitic life was adopted. At one time entomologists\nregarded fleas as wingless flies and placed them in the order Diptera.\nCertain supposed scaly plates on their bodies were regarded as the\natrophied relics of wings. It is, however, more than doubtful whether\nthis view is correct; and all modern entomologists who have given any\nspecial study to fleas are agreed that they are sufficiently unlike\nany other living insects to deserve a place in an order by themselves.\nTo this order the name _Siphonaptera_ has been given: which means that\nthe insects comprised in it are provided with sucking mouths and are\ndestitute of wings. Another name for the order is Aphaniptera, but this\nis gradually falling into disuse. Linn\u00c3\u00a6us (1758) only mentions two\nspecies of flea: the human flea which he appropriately named _Pulex\nirritans_, and the chigoe of hot countries which he called _Pulex\npenetrans_, from the habit which the female has of burrowing under the\nskin of her victims. At the time of writing, about 460 species of flea\nhave been described and named; but some of the names are doubtless\nsynonymous, and the actual number of separable species that have been\ndiscovered is somewhere about four hundred. The vast majority of these\nhave been described within the last few years, which shows what can be\ndone when attention is turned to any neglected group of animals. There\ncan be no doubt that many undiscovered species still remain, and will\nnow, in due course, be collected, described and named.\n\nThe position which should be assigned to the order Siphonaptera in the\ngeneral scheme of insect classification is a question on which the most\nlearned modern entomologists have disputed with considerable vigour.\nSome see the nearest relatives among the beetles, others among the\nflies. The majority, as we shall see later on, would place them near\nthe Diptera: but since no convincing arguments have been produced on\neither side it may be wisest to regard the question as still at present\nunsolved.\n\nFleas belong to one of the groups of insects which go through a\ncomplete metamorphosis. Their life-history consequently falls into\nfour divisions: egg, larva, pupa and imago. If the climate permits,\nthe female flea lays her eggs all the year round, and from one to five\nare dropped at a time. Unlike those of many other parasites they are\nnever attached to the hairs of the hosts, but appear to be deposited\nindiscriminately on the floors of houses or in the nests and sleeping\nplaces of their hosts. The eggs generally hatch in a few days, and a\nminute, white, wormlike larva emerges (Fig. 1). The larv\u00c3\u00a6, of some, and\npossibly of all, fleas are provided with a wonderful adaptation in the\nshape of an egg-breaker or hatching-spine. This is a thin plate, like\nthe edge of a knife, where the point of the head comes in contact with\nthe shell. The movements of the prisoner make a slight split in the\negg-shell, which then bursts asunder. This organ has vanished in later\nlarval life, and it is probably lost after the first moult. The larva\nis legless and has thirteen segments. It grows rapidly, and, as it\ngrows, moults its skin several times. It is provided with mouth-parts\nadapted for biting, and eats any decaying organic refuse. The larv\u00c3\u00a6 may\nbe reared on the sweepings of an ordinary room or the dirty scurf which\ncollects at the bottom of old birds\u00e2\u0080\u0099 nests. It is hardly necessary to\nadd that the mother takes no interest whatever in the larv\u00c3\u00a6 and that\nthe belief that she feeds them on dried blood is not based on any sound\nfoundations.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. The larva of a flea. The body consists of\nthirteen segments and is legless. On the fore part of the head are the\nantenn\u00c3\u00a6 and on the upper part of the head is shown the knife-like edge\nof the egg-breaker. The mouth-parts are adapted for biting. On the last\nsegment of the body are the two caudal stylets.]\n\nThe larval stage lasts some days, and the animal spins a small cocoon\nbefore pupating. In the course of a few more days, the time probably\ndepending on the weather, the perfect flea emerges. The larv\u00c3\u00a6 generally\nlive in places where the perfect insects will have an opportunity of\nfinding a host as soon as they leave the pupal envelope. The nests\nof their hosts where the young are being reared are always favourite\nplaces. It seems possible that the comparative immunity from fleas\nwhich hoofed mammals or Ungulates enjoy may be due to the fact that\nthe young beast follows its mother from the time of birth instead of\npassing its early life helpless in a nest.\n\nObservations made on the development of the dog-flea (_Ctenocephalus\ncanis_) in India show that eggs laid on October 17 hatched on October\n19. The larva spun its cocoon on October 25 and the mature flea emerged\non November 2. In Northern Europe the human flea takes about four weeks\nin summer and six weeks in winter to pass through its metamorphosis.\n\nUnlike many parasitic insects, fleas do not constantly pass their\ntime upon the bodies of their victims. The greater part of their\nlife is probably spent on the ground, in the house, or nest, of the\nmammal or bird which serves them with blood. In this respect there is\nconsiderable difference in the habits of different species of flea.\nSome attach themselves to an animal and actually burrow into the skin.\nThese are the most parasitic species. Some only come to feed and leave\nto lay their eggs. Many probably do not suck blood more than once in\ntheir lives.\n\nAn animal which harbours fleas and which nourishes the adult insect\nwith blood is called a _host_. No fleas are more than what is called\ntemporary parasites; which means that they pass but a portion of their\nlives on their hosts and frequently take occasion to hop on and off.\nAll fleas, apparently, go from host to host. The labours of diligent\ncollectors have proved that the great majority of mammals and birds\nhave fleas. As a general rule, it is true to say that certain species\nof flea are associated with certain species of host. Thus man is the\ntrue host of _Pulex irritans_; the cat family are the true hosts of\nthe cat-flea (_Ctenocephalus felis_); and the dog family are the true\nhosts of the dog-flea (_Ctenocephalus canis_). But the human flea is\nsometimes found on cats and dogs, and cat and dog-fleas occasionally\nbite human beings; and cat-fleas are found on dogs and dog-fleas are\nfound on cats. All fleas, so far as we know, may occasionally pass from\none species of host to another; but they do not, for the most part,\nseem to flourish in unaccustomed quarters. Some fleas are more catholic\nin their tastes than others. Some seem to be very strictly confined to\none host, and even when starving only suck strange blood under protest.\nThere is a species of flea that has only (except by accident) been\nfound on the long-tailed field-mouse and another that has only been\nfound on the hedgehog. Other fleas are commonly found on two absolutely\ndistinct animals; a good instance of this is the human flea which, at\nall events in certain parts of England, is a regular parasite of the\nbadger.\n\nAs distinguished from true or natural hosts one must separate what\nmay be termed casual or accidental hosts. All animals which come in\ncontact with one another, or which live in close proximity, may\nexchange fleas. So even bird-fleas may be collected from mammals and\ntypically mammalian fleas from birds. In this fashion puzzles may\narise which tax the ingenuity of the collector to solve. Bird-fleas\nare sometimes found on bats, and this may be obviously attributed to\nthe bats having inhabited a hole which was tenanted by starlings or an\nold loft infested with the fleas of pigeons. All beasts of prey are\nsometimes found to harbour the fleas of animals they have devoured.\nRabbits\u00e2\u0080\u0099 fleas are found on wild-cats; hedgehogs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 fleas on foxes; mice\nfleas on weasels; and fleas characteristic of small birds on stoats.\nSo also in the case of mice, rats and voles with holes and runs in the\nsame hedgerow, the parasites usually peculiar to one are not uncommonly\nfound on the others. It is sometimes difficult to determine the true\nhost of a flea.\n\nMuch more puzzling to explain are the reasons which confine a flea to\na certain host and which cause closely allied hosts to have different\nfleas. The fleas from the house-martin and the sand-martin are quite\ndifferent; those from the domestic fowl and the domestic pigeon are\ndistinct species. The causes which have affected the evolution of the\nvarious forms of flea are too obscure to enable anyone at the present\nday to offer any satisfactory explanation.\n\nSpeaking generally, the fleas found on birds have points in common,\nand they probably form a natural group to themselves. What may be\ncalled true bird-fleas have been collected from almost all European\nbirds. An unwieldy genus (_Ceratophyllus_) comprises many species of\ndifferent flea. Some species are very abundant and infest the nests of\nmany different birds. Others are extremely rare. One of these rarities\n(_C. vagabundus_) is found in the nests of puffins and other sea-birds.\nAnother has been collected on antarctic petrels. Penguins have a\nspecial genus of flea to themselves. A specimen, unique at one time\n(_Ceratophyllus borealis_), in Mr N. C. Rothschild\u00e2\u0080\u0099s collection was\nobtained from the gannet. It has now been found on rock-pipits in the\nShetland Islands.\n\nTwo very rare fleas (_C. farreni_ and C. _rothschildi_) are found in\nthe nests of house-martins; yet the nests of these birds are infested\nwith common species besides. A plague flea (_Xenopsylla_) has been\nfound on an African swift.\n\nForty-six different species of flea have been found in the British\nIslands, but many of these are extremely scarce.\n\nWe know too little about the geographical distribution of fleas to lay\ndown many accurate generalities. When a great deal more material has\nbeen collected and studied, it may be possible to show that certain\ngroups are associated with certain regions of the earth or certain\norders of animals. To some extent this is already seen to be the case.\nThe fleas indigenous to the New World are distantly related to those\nof the Old World. Broadly speaking the geographical distribution of the\nparasite must follow that of the host. But sometimes the parasite is\nimpatient of cold and cannot follow the host out of the tropics. The\nchigoes and their allies are fleas of hot countries. Different kinds\nof bats are found from the tropics to the Arctic circle, but the same\nbat-fleas are not found everywhere.\n\nWhen a flea has a cosmopolitan range it is probable that it has\ntravelled over the world in company with its host.\n\nMonkeys have no fleas. This is an assertion that is commonly received\nwith surprise and incredulity. Occasionally a gorilla or a chimpanzee\nmay get a chigoe in its toe. And monkeys in zoological gardens or\nmenageries are possibly exposed to the danger of catching an occasional\nhuman flea from the people who crowd round their cages. These are\nremote contingencies which may happen to anyone. Healthy wild monkeys\nare much too clean and active to harbour fleas. When they search one\nanother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fur in a fashion that must be familiar to most persons, they\nare clearing their coats of particles of scurf or of similar scraps of\ndirt and not of fleas. So, speaking generally, it may be said that no\nfleas have been found truly parasitic on monkeys.\n\nBats have fleas, but not in great abundance. All bat-fleas are rare\non their hosts and extremely difficult to find and collect. The\nsame species are not found on fruit-bats and the ordinary smaller\ninsect-eating bats. The geographical distribution of some bat-fleas is\npuzzling. For instance, one species (_Ischnopsylla unipectinata_) is\nfound on the greater horse-shoe bat in Europe; but it is, apparently,\nnot found on the same bat in the British Islands. In Somaliland and in\nIndia it is found on other bats.\n\nWith certain exceptions, Ungulates are remarkably free from fleas. This\ngreat order of mammals includes a variety of hoofed animals: oxen,\nsheep, goats, deer, pigs, camels, giraffes and antelopes.\n\nThe only true fleas found on these are two species of the genus\n_Vermipsylla_, which resemble the chigoes in so far that the pregnant\nfemales burrow into the host and expand there. One species has been\nfound on camels and horses in Transcaucasia; another on roe-deer in\nNorthern China. The female of the last is often found ensconced on\nthe inside of the nostrils of the deer. Of course chigoes may attack\ndomestic Ungulates of all kinds; but no other members of the family\n_Pulicid\u00c3\u00a6_ or typical fleas except those two above mentioned have been\nfound on hoofed mammals.\n\nInsectivora such as moles, shrews and hedgehogs are the hosts of a\ngreat variety of species. The same thing may be said of the Rodents,\nwhich include porcupines, squirrels, rats, mice and a vast number of\nother small mammals whose geographical distribution includes almost the\nwhole of the habitable globe. Probably more different species of fleas\nhave been collected from Insectivora and Rodents than from all the\nother orders of mammals grouped together.\n\nThe Carnivora, excluding the Pinnepedia, or seals, sea-lions and\nwalruses, harbour numerous species.\n\nAmong the Edentata a very remarkable and highly specialised genus\nof fleas is parasitic on armadilloes in South America. This genus\n(_Malacopsylla_) consists of two species only, which are confined to\nSouth America and are found on the armadilloes and on carnivorous\nanimals which probably have preyed on them. The thorax of these fleas\nis much reduced and very small in size. Their piercing organs are\nslender and weak, but they possess enormous spines on the legs with\nwhich they hold on to their hosts. These two South American fleas (_M.\ngrossiventris_ and _M. androcli_) will be referred to again later as\nstriking examples of fleas with strongly developed legs and weakly\nconstructed mouth-parts. The contrary combination of powerful mouths\nand degenerate legs is also found in other groups of fleas, as will be\nseen in the chapter on the chigoes.\n\nThe Marsupials of Australia and South America have special fleas which\nwere probably associated with this strange order of pouched mammals\nbefore they became divided into the American and Australian groups.\nFleas have been collected on the spiny ant-eater (_Echidna_) which\nbelongs to the lowest order of Monotremes or egg-laying mammals.\n\nOn almost every form of bird, including the most aquatic kinds, fleas\nof various species have been obtained.\n\nOnly one instance has been recorded of a flea occurring on a reptile.\nA female of one of the species of burrowing chigoes (_Echidnophaga\nambulans_) from Australia was collected by Dr Woodward from the Brown\nSnake (_Diemenia superciliosa_). This reptile, which is well known\nin Australia, belongs to a sub-family that contains some of the most\ndeadly poisonous snakes and is allied to the cobras. The Brown Snake is\na terrestrial snake, and one must regard the presence of the flea on\nsuch a host as a rare and chance occurrence. The snake was captured at\nHerdman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Lake, near Perth in West Australia. The same species of flea\nhas also been obtained from the phalangers (_Trichosurus_) which live\nin the tops of the Australian gum-trees; from the little terrestrial\nand nocturnal rat kangaroos (_Bettongia_); and from the banded\nant-eater (_Myrmecobius_), another Australian Marsupial. It is possible\nthat the flea moved from some small mammal which was being devoured by\nthe snake and managed to fix itself between the scaly plates of the\nreptile.\n\nWhen fleas are hatched in a nest they have no choice but to attach\nthemselves to the young mammals or birds. But even in that case\nthey frequently leave their hosts and do not for very long remain\nstationary. Moreover, when a host dies and becomes cold the fleas\ninvariably leave their quarters, which explains how it may happen that\nCarnivora get infested with the fleas of their prey. This change of\nhosts which is always occurring makes it impossible to draw conclusions\nfrom material collected in zoological gardens where many animals are\nherded together. In menageries, too, the normal conditions of breeding\nare absent. A German naturalist collected 2036 fleas from theatres,\nconcert-halls, ball-rooms, schools and barracks in the grand-duchy\nof Baden and found that more than fifty per cent. were dog-fleas\n(_Ctenocephalus canis_). What the proportion may be in other parts\nof Europe we have no materials from which to form a judgment. In\nzoological gardens cat-fleas (_Ct. felis_) are generally numerous in\nmost of the cages.\n\nIt is, of course, well known to every zoologist that species are not\nfixed or constant and that various forms of mammal or of bird tend to\nshow geographical variations. When a long series of skins are laid out\non a table and carefully examined it is seldom that those from the west\nof any great region cannot be picked out and distinguished from those\nobtained in the east. So we also get northern and southern forms of\nthe same species varying slightly. These variations are perceptible in\nmany forms of insects, and zoologists now describe these local races as\nsubspecies and designate them with trinomials. No one, however, knows\nenough as yet about all the various forms which are assumed by fleas\nto attempt, except in a few instances, to do so in the case of these\nanimals.\n\nThe study of Siphonaptera is still quite in its infancy. We know little\nor nothing of the minute geographical variation of fleas. That there\nis such a thing can already be seen in a few species. In the meantime\nthe study of variation must be postponed until collectors have amassed\na more plentiful amount of material; and it is best to treat all forms\nwhich are to all appearance constantly different as being specifically\ndistinct until more is known about variation.\n\nAny classification of fleas that may now be attempted can only be\ntentative. It will be enough for present purposes if the reader will\nremember that the Order Siphonaptera can be divided into three groups\nor families: (1) the chigoes and their allies, which are the most\nparasitic fleas (_Sarcopsyllid\u00c3\u00a6_); (2) the typical fleas to which\nthe majority of species belong (_Pulicid\u00c3\u00a6_); and (3) the bat-fleas\n(_Ceratopsyllid\u00c3\u00a6_), which have certain peculiarities that will be\ndescribed in a later chapter.\n\nOf the antiquity of fleas, and of the period in geological history when\nthe order made its appearance, little can be said. When it was thought\nthat fleas were confined, as parasites, to warm-blooded mammals and\nbirds, evolutionists were inclined to say that the parasites could\nnot have appeared before their hosts. The discovery of a flea on a\nreptile opened the vista of possibly enormous antiquity stretching back\nto Permian or Carboniferous ages. The fossil record is most meagre.\nIf we reject as too doubtful the supposed remains of a flea from the\nlower Oligocene strata at Aix in Provence, only one undoubted fossil\nhas been discovered. Nor does it seem certain that fleas are entirely\nrestricted to preying on vertebrates. Dr Dampf introduced a number\nof common bird-fleas (_Ceratophyllus gallin\u00c3\u00a6_) of both sexes to some\nhairy caterpillars. He observed that several of the fleas buried their\nheads in the hairy covering of the larv\u00c3\u00a6 and remained some time in the\nattitude of sucking blood. While this was going on the victims made\nviolent demonstrations of annoyance and discomfort. He also observed\nthat a naked caterpillar was not attacked.\n\nMr Boden has also recorded how he found in a seed-warehouse some\npeas that were being eaten by two species of Lepidopterous larv\u00c3\u00a6. On\nbringing these home and keeping them in a jar, he found among them\nsome small larv\u00c3\u00a6 which ultimately turned into fleas, probably _Pulex\nirritans_. These fleas, being confined without other food, were\nobserved to prey on the Lepidopterous larv\u00c3\u00a6 and to feed freely on\ntheir juices. The larv\u00c3\u00a6 which were attacked by fleas pined and died.\nThe fluid from the stomach of the fleas when they were crushed was\ntransparent and not red like vertebrate blood which often exudes when a\nmammalian flea is pinched and cracked open.\n\nA French entomologist has also reported that the numerous fleas which\nswarm in the dwelling-houses of Corsica, for want of other nourishment\nturn their attention to flies that may be incapable of flight.\n\nThe only fossil remains of a flea that have, so far, been discovered\nare a single insect in a piece of Baltic amber of Oligocene age. Many\norganic remains have been preserved in this fashion, but this is the\nfirst mammalian parasite that has been found. The flea is admirably\nprotected by its semi-transparent surroundings, and the most minute\ndetails of structure, the arrangement of bristles on the body, and the\nnumber of segments to the labial palpi can be discerned. This unique\nobject is in the collection of Professor Klebs. The first point to\nnote is that a flea of this antiquity hardly differs from the existing\ninsects of the present day. It has been referred to an existing genus\n(_Pal\u00c3\u00a6opsylla_) of which there are at least four species living.\nThree of these are parasites of the mole, and the fourth is found on\nshrews. There is good reason to suppose that the host of the fossil\nwas some insectivorous mammal. The early specialisation of fleas is\nstrikingly illustrated. This insect is already adapted for life on\nsome warm-blooded animal. It has a thoracic comb, and its mouth-parts\nare in all respects like those of a modern flea. It belongs to a genus\nwhich is still commonly distributed over Europe. When we consider how\nremote are the chances that a mammalian flea should first get embedded\nin amber and should, subsequently, be detected and described by a\nnaturalist, we may well understand that the owner of the fossil asked,\nthough without success, \u00c2\u00a31200 for it.\n\nThe ordinary person regards fleas as a subject for humour of an obvious\nand familiar kind. The utilitarian despises a man who can cheerfully\nspend his time in collecting fleas. Yet it seems probable that a study\nof their forms and habits may be of immediate benefit to the human\nrace. The discovery that fleas are connected with the spread of plague\nis an instance of apparently unprofitable scientific labour proving of\ndirect advantage to mankind. An accurate knowledge of the structure\nand habits of fleas is now seen to be of importance to all who are\nengaged in fighting one of the most dreaded infectious diseases. When\nplague breaks out men of science now at once turn their attention to\nthe fleas. This is likely to prove more directly efficacious than the\nmedi\u00c3\u00a6val custom of marking the house with a red cross and inscribing\nthe legend, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGod have mercy on us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE EXTERNAL STRUCTURE OF A FLEA\n\n\nIN comparing the structure of a flea with that of a man, or any other\nof the higher animals, it is of the utmost importance to understand\nthat the one has an internal and the other an external skeleton. In\neither case the skeleton serves as an attachment for the muscles by\nwhich the animal moves itself. Everyone is familiar with the external\nskeleton of a lobster and can see for himself how the muscles are\nattached. The structure of a flea, though so much smaller, is somewhat\nsimilar, except that the skeleton is composed of a horny substance\nknown as _chitin_ instead of being calcified. The chitinous cuticle\nentirely covers the flea, but it varies in hardness and thickness\non different parts of the body. The epidermis, or true skin, lies\nimmediately beneath. On those parts of the body which are to the rear\nof the head the chitin forms a series of plates or shields which\noverlap one another somewhat like the tiles of a house. The segmented\nstructure of a flea is there most clearly seen; this we may suppose is\nan inheritance from the segmented worms.\n\nThe chitin which forms the external skeleton of a flea is secreted by\nan outer layer of cells on the insect\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body. The deposit being thin at\nthe joints, and thick on the plates, which serve for protection, the\nflea is encased in a suit of flexible armour. It is made of a fairly\nsolid and dense substance, but, owing to the absence of carbonate and\nphosphate of lime, is much lighter than the familiar external skeleton\nof the lobster. Chitin is a very peculiar and durable substance which\nresists boiling in acids or alkalies. It is a structureless substance,\nin the sense that it does not consist of cells. Though horny in\nappearance it is, of course, in no sense true horn like that of the\nnails, hoofs, claws, and horns of vertebrates.\n\nThe different species of flea vary considerably in size. Some are\nsmaller than the familiar human flea. Others are much larger. A very\nlarge flea (_Hystrichopsylla talp\u00c3\u00a6_) is that found on the mole. The\nlargest known flea (_Dolichopsyllus stylosus_) is found on small\nrodents in the United States where, as we know, all things are on a\nbigger scale than in the Old World. It is seven millimetres long.\n\nThe colour of the horny integument varies from a pale or light yellow\nto a ruddy or dark brown. It is plentifully sprinkled over with\nspines, bristles, or hairs, directed backwards so as not to impede\nprogress. The presence or absence, the arrangement on the body, and\nthe size of these serve, along with other features, to distinguish\ndifferent species. They seem materially to help a flea in those\nwriggles to escape with which we are all familiar. The bristles are not\nalways the same in size and arrangement in the two sexes of the same\nspecies of flea. As a rule the males are more bristly than the females.\n\nThese appendages of the flea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s integument are called by various\nwriters either spines, bristles, or hairs. There is, however, no real\ndistinction in the structure or nature of the appendages, and it is a\nquestion of degree which name is most appropriate.\n\nIn distinguishing species, very little reliance can be placed on the\ncolour of the flea. An insect newly emerged from the pupa is always\nlighter in colour; and the difference between the appearance of an\nempty stomach and a stomach gorged with red blood is surprising.\n\nThe general external appearance of a typical flea belonging to the main\nfamily _Pulicid\u00c3\u00a6_ is fairly familiar to most persons. This is well\nseen in the figure of the oriental rat-flea. The body is compressed or\nflattened from side to side, and this is a feature which is extremely\nrare among insects. It doubtless enables the animal to glide with\ngreater facility through the hairs of its host. Like other insects,\na flea is readily divided into a head, a thorax, and an abdomen. The\nhead is rounded on the top and front and shows no obvious trace of\nsegmentation; but what is known of the development of other insects\nleads one to think that it must properly be regarded as a number of\nsegments closely fused together. On the under side of the front part of\nthe head is a beak or proboscis for piercing and sucking, composed of\nthe mouth-parts, whose structure is worthy of minute study. It will be\nbest to examine them in detail in a subsequent chapter.\n\nSome fleas have eyes, others have none. The common mouse-flea\n(_Leptopsylla musculi_) is blind. The bat-fleas are also destitute\nof eyes. The nocturnal habits of their hosts would render eyes of\nlittle or no use. If eyes are present they are large and placed on\neither side of the head. Each is a simple eye or ocellus; the compound\neyes, divided into a great number of hexagonal facets, which are\ncharacteristic of many insects, are never found in fleas.\n\nNothing is known about the flea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s powers of vision, but there is no\nreason to suppose that they are at all acute. The eyes are marked with\npigment. Ocelli appear to be primitive types of insect eye which are,\nperhaps, an inheritance from a wormlike ancestor. Presumably all the\nfleas of long ago had eyes and those that are now blind have lost their\norgans of sight from disuse. In their simplest condition, the eyes\nof the lower invertebrates only enable the creature, so far as one\ncan judge, to distinguish light from darkness. Entomologists believe\nthat the power of vision of ocelli is probably confined to very near\nobjects and that this simple form of eye is more useful in dark places\nthan the compound eyes. There is no reason for believing that fleas\ncan distinguish colours or can discern any object which is more than a\nfew inches away. It is enough for their purpose to perceive from which\npoint light comes upon them and to make all despatch to escape in the\nopposite direction.\n\nIn blind fleas there is often a spine where the eye should be. In\none species the spine is rudimentary and there is some black pigment\nbeneath it. It is not impossible that this is the vestige of a once\nfunctional eye. In one genus, however, the eye and the spine are both\npresent. Of the fleas belonging to this genus one species is South\nAmerican and the other European. The latter (_Typhloceras poppei_) is\nconfined to the long-tailed field-mouse.\n\nThe organs by which fleas keep in touch with the outward world, and\nwith other fleas, are their antenn\u00c3\u00a6. All fleas have antenn\u00c3\u00a6; but unlike\nthose of a moth, a beetle, or a grasshopper, each fits neatly into a\ngroove at the side of the head and can be protruded when desired. This\nis another adaptation to enable the insect to creep swiftly through a\nforest of hairs.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. Showing a type of (_a_) _genal_ and (_b_)\n_thoracic_ combs of a flea, on the under part of the head and on\nthe thorax respectively. Analagous combs are found in several other\nparasitic insects and on the abdominal segments of certain fleas.]\n\nThe combs which are found on the heads of many fleas are organs of\nexceptional interest (Fig. 2). They are toothed and horny appendages,\nwhich are connected with parasitic habits, for somewhat similar combs\nare found on several unrelated groups of parasitic insects, as, for\ninstance, on parasitic beetles (_Platypsyllus_) found on the beaver,\non insects allied to bed-bugs (_Polyctenes_) found on bats, and on\nwingless flies (_Nycteribia_) which infest Egyptian and South American\nbats. The majority of the _Pulicid\u00c3\u00a6_ have one or more combs with\ncomparatively long teeth. These combs reach their maximum development\nin the bat-fleas which have no less than eight. Some Australian and\nSouth American fleas (_Stephanocircus_) have a helmet-like comb\nextending all round their heads. These combs are by some supposed to\nbe of service in holding on to the hairs of the host; and, if one may\njudge from experiments made on live fleas in cotton wool, they are also\nused in moving forwards through the fur.\n\nAll the chigoes (_Sarcopsyllid\u00c3\u00a6_) have a large triangular post-oral\nprocess which is more or less curved and probably prevents the flea\nslipping back as it pushes forward. Bat-fleas (_Ceratopsyllid\u00c3\u00a6_) have\nlobes or flaps placed two on each side of the head, which may possibly\nserve an identical purpose, but whether they do so is not known.\n\nThese combs may be divided into three groups according to the part of\nthe flea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body on which they are found. Those found on the head are\ncalled genal combs and take the form shown in Fig. 2. There are also\ncombs found on the thorax. The fossil flea (_Pal\u00c3\u00a6opsylla klebsi_)\ndescribed in the previous chapter has one of these thoracic combs. A\ncertain number of fleas also have combs on the abdominal segments.\n\nThere are really two types of toothed organs on fleas to both of which\nthe name of comb may be given. One is composed of a sheet of chitin\nwith a number of slits and teeth and resembles a true comb. The other\nconsists merely of a number of highly chitinised bristles arranged in\na row. They probably both serve the same function. Apart from their\nuse as organs to assist movement onwards, they may also serve as\n_hair-tight_ joints and protect the flea from the inconvenience of\ngetting the tips of the host\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fur into the joints of its horny armour.\n\nThe size of the head compared to the thorax and abdomen varies\nconsiderably in different species. Some fleas have what may be called\nby comparison large heads and others very small ones.\n\nA small head is never found in a flea with powerful mouth-parts. The\nhead being the bearer of piercing and sucking organs, which require\nstrong muscles, there must be room not only for the organs but for\ntheir extensors and retractors.\n\nThere are normally three rows of bristles on a flea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head which divide\nthe head into four sections. It is possible that these correspond to\nthe four segments of the ancestral insect which are now fused together.\n\nThe head of a flea is closely applied by the whole of its back\nsurface to the body and that slender and conspicuous neck which is\ncharacteristic of the Diptera, or flies, is not to be found in any\nfleas. For this reason a flea cannot turn its head in any direction\nwithout at the same time following it round with its body.\n\nThe thorax of a flea consists of three segments called respectively\nthe prothorax, mesothorax and metathorax. The chitinous external\nskeleton which covers each of these three segments is primarily a\nhoop but each hoop is further subdivided into a number of complicated\nplates. Attached to the thorax are the three pairs of legs which are\ncharacteristic of all adult insects. The hind pair are very much the\nstrongest (Fig. 3). They are the organs of hopping. It has often been\npointed out that if men had the leaping powers of some fleas they would\nbound with ease backwards and forwards over the cross on the top of\nSt. Paul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cathedral. Each leg consists of four segments beautifully\narticulated and plentifully supplied with bristles. At the end comes\nthe foot with five very short segments. The last segment is provided\nwith a pair of more or less formidable claws. Fleas use their legs for\nleaping, for running, and for clinging to their hosts. They also use\ntheir mouth-parts for the last purpose and it is worthy of note, as we\nshall see later on, that in those fleas in which the mouth-parts are\nshortest and weakest the legs are most liberally supplied with bristles\nand possess the stoutest claws. The legs of a flea are unique in the\ninsect world owing to the enormous development of the segment nearest\nthe body called the coxa. Most leaping insects rely for their activity\non the muscles of the lower joints. In a grasshopper it is the third\njoint from the body (femur) which is so immensely enlarged. The three\npairs of legs are each attached to a different thoracic segment.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. The hind leg of a flea. The segment or joint\nnearest the body is the _coxa_ which is unusually developed. Next come\nthe small _trochanter_ and the larger _femur_. The _tibia_ which is\nlong and slender follows. Then come the five _tarsi_ with the sixth and\nultimate segment provided with claws.]\n\nWhen fleas walk, they are so to speak plantigrades walking on the\nsole of the foot, and all the tarsal or foot joints are applied to\nthe surface of the ground. The claws serve as grips so as to make the\nmost of any unevenness; and thus the insect drags itself along with\nsurprising rapidity when it moves through the hairy coat of a mammal.\nBut on an open surface fleas are not really rapid movers compared with\nmany other insects.\n\nThe two claws on the end of each ultimate foot segment are freely\nmoveable and are in fact highly modified bristles or set\u00c3\u00a6.\n\nIn all fleas one of the plates of the metathorax (or hindmost thoracic\nsegment) called the epimeron, is large and prolonged towards the\nrear. It invariably bears a stigma. The epimeron is placed laterally\nto the first abdominal tergite. The older naturalists jumped to the\nconclusion that this was the remains of a wing. The best judges have,\nhowever, formed a decided opinion that no trace of the relic of a\nflying organ can be detected on the thorax of a flea. Heymons, a German\nentomologist, has also failed to detect any sign in dissections which\nhe has made of the larv\u00c3\u00a6 and the pup\u00c3\u00a6.\n\nThe epimeron is in fact neither a scale nor a wing but a portion of\nthe thorax present in all insects. It is of no special service to the\nflea except as a portion of the thoracic armature which covers the body.\n\nThe larva of a flea has no legs; the adult insect has six. A study\nof other embryo insects shows that the ancestors of insects had many\nlegs. It is an interesting problem why insects lost the legs on their\nabdomens, why legs should now invariably be restricted to the thorax,\nand why there should never be more than three pairs. In the earliest\nknown insects which lived on the earth, before winged forms were\nevolved, the number of legs was already six. But our knowledge of fleas\nis too small to attempt, at present, to trace their exact line of\nancestral descent.\n\nThe abdomen of a flea consists of ten segments. The horny plates which\ncover the dorsal side are called tergites; those on the ventral side\nsternites. In fleas, as in all holometabolous insects, that is those\nwhich pass through a complete metamorphosis, the sternite of the first\nabdominal segment is suppressed and has completely disappeared. The\ntergite which covers the dorsal part of the first abdominal segment\nnearest to the thorax is, however, always present.\n\nThe ultimate segments of the male and female flea are modified for\nreproductive purposes and of these segments more must be said later.\n\nHaving now given a rough outline of the external skeleton of a flea, it\nonly remains to say something about the muscular system. Attached to\nthe inside of the chitinous armature are an enormous number of muscles,\nwhitish and almost transparent. They act as extensors, retractors,\nflexors, elevators and depressors. The joints and hinges of the\nskeleton allow of considerable, but not perfect, freedom. The muscles\nof locomotion are partly in the thorax and partly in the several joints\nof the legs. Our knowledge of the muscular system of fleas is very\nimperfect. But, as in other insects, the general arrangement of the\nmuscles is based on the segmented structure of the body.\n\nFor the reader who can accurately picture to himself the external\nstructure of a flea and of the typical insects belonging to other\norders, a few words may be said on the probable ancestry of fleas and\ntheir relationship to other living insects. This vexed and much debated\nquestion is still, as the older naturalists would have said, _tremendum\nmysterium_. Very little light has yet been thrown upon it, and the\nmost divergent views have been expressed by learned and competent\nentomologists. A historic survey of the various opinions that have\nbeen held since the days of Linn\u00c3\u00a6us would fill many pages; but a short\nsummary of the different orders to which fleas have been referred by\ndifferent zoologists will suffice.\n\nThe older authors, Linn\u00c3\u00a6us, Geoffroy, Cuvier and Dum\u00c3\u00a9ril, and Gervais\nplaced them among the _Aptera_ because they were wingless. Kircher\nregarded them as _Orthoptera_, an order which includes grasshoppers\nand crickets; but he has had few followers. By Fabricius and by\nIlliger they were treated as _Hemiptera_ or bugs. Lameere, a Belgian,\nhas recently expressed a decided view that fleas are really a family\nof _Coleoptera_ or beetles. Those who have held the once orthodox\nopinion that they belonged to the _Diptera_ or flies are Roesel, Oken,\nStraus-D\u00c3\u00bcrkheim, Burmeister, Newman, Walker, von Siebold and Wagner.\n\nThe structure of an adult flea, however, differs from that of an\nadult fly in the following noteworthy respects: the mouth-parts are\ndifferently constructed, the head of the flea is closely joined to its\nthorax, the three divisions of the thorax are not joined and fused, the\nflea is wingless, the eyes of fleas are simple ocelli, and there are\ndifferences of lesser importance in the stigmata, which give access to\nthe tracheal system by which all insects breathe.\n\nThe number of those who have regarded fleas as belonging to a distinct\norder of insects is considerable: they are Lamarck, De Geer, Latreille,\nKirby and Spence, MacLeay, Leach, Dug\u00c3\u00a8s, Bouch\u00c3\u00a9, van der Hoeven,\nWestwood, Landois, Brauer, Kraepelin, and Taschenberg. Modern opinion\nis all but unanimous on this point.\n\nThere remains, however, a second question. Even if it be agreed\nthat there must be a distinct order for _Suctoria, Aphaniptera,\nSiphonaptera_, or fleas; where ought that order to be placed? In which\nother order of insects must we look for the nearest relations of fleas?\nFor a time after the acceptance of the fact that insect forms have\nbeen evolved, and not separately created, the ancestors of fleas were\nsearched for among some species of fly.\n\nThen Kraepelin rejected the view that flies were as closely related\nto fleas as most entomologists thought and his followers could only\nfind points of difference and no points of resemblance. Dahl (1899), a\nGerman, then took up the cudgels for the fly theory. Dahl pointed out\nthe resemblance between fleas and a group of flies called _Phorid\u00c3\u00a6_\nalso parasitic on warm-blooded animals. During the ensuing years the\ndebate was resumed afresh with much liveliness and sometimes with a\nlittle acrimony.\n\nThe fleas were placed by MacLeay and by Balbiani between the _Diptera_\nand _Hemiptera_; by Leach between the _Hemiptera_ and _Lepidoptera_;\nby Dug\u00c3\u00a8s between the _Hymenoptera_ and _Diptera_; by Brauer between\nthe _Diptera_ and _Coleoptera_. Handlirsch thinks that fleas have\nno connection at all with beetles and Gross can find no signs of\nrelationship with either _Coleoptera_ or _Diptera_.\n\nEmbryology and the study of larval forms have thrown so much light on\nthe ancestry of many animals, that it was hoped that a microscopic\nexamination of the larv\u00c3\u00a6 of fleas, in various stages of development,\nwould produce some facts of importance. In this hope entomologists\nhave, to a great extent, been disappointed. There seems to be much\nsimilarity between the embryos of beetles, moths, flies, wasps and\nfleas. Those who have dwelt on the likeness of the larval flea to the\nmaggot of a fly seem to forget that the resemblance to an embryo beetle\nis nearly as strong.\n\nThe young larva of the flea is very transparent and the digestive\ncanal, heart and nervous system are easily recognised. The egg-shell\nbreaker is an interesting example of the development of a temporary\nlarval structure and it is the only known instance of such a\nstructure in an insect. There are no traces of eyes. The antenn\u00c3\u00a6 are\nthree-jointed. They are rather long and slender, being about one-third\nas long as the head. The head is well-developed and the larva has no\nfeet.\n\nThe biting mandibles are broad and triangular. Compared with those of\nother larv\u00c3\u00a6 they are said to be more like the mandibles of coleopterous\nthan of dipterous larv\u00c3\u00a6. The maxill\u00c3\u00a6, or second pair of jaws, are\nsomewhat reduced and rudimentary. The absence of eyes and of legs are\npoints of similarity between the larv\u00c3\u00a6 of fleas and flies. The maggot\nof a fly has also two pairs of jaws, and a pair of antenn\u00c3\u00a6.\n\nAt the tail end of the larval flea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abdomen are two small projections\ncalled caudal stylets (Fig. 1). They are strong, recurved, chitinous,\nstructures which prop up the body of the larva when it creeps and\nwriggles. There are similar props in the larv\u00c3\u00a6 of certain beetles and\nno exactly similar organs are known in dipterous larv\u00c3\u00a6. But caudal\nstylets are of small taxonomic importance.\n\nIn one respect the mature flea is certainly nearer to a beetle than to\na fly: the three joints of the thorax are free as in a beetle and not\nfused as in a fly; but when one studies the mouth-parts, the true view\nseems to be that the mouth-parts of a flea are equally unlike those\nof a fly and those of a beetle. Such being the present state of our\nknowledge, one must wait for fresh light to be thrown on the matter by\nfurther researches. It seems unlikely that the immediate future will\nproduce a solution of the problem.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE MOUTH-PARTS AND SENSE-ORGANS\n\n\nWHEN the outward anatomy of a flea was described, in an earlier\nchapter, the mouth-parts, which form a sort of beak or proboscis under\nthe head, were mentioned. These most interesting parts of the insect\nmust now be dealt with. The reader probably knows that some insects\nhave mouths for sucking fluids and others mouths for biting solids. A\nmoth or a fly cannot masticate solids, whilst a beetle or a cricket has\neffective biting jaws.\n\nThe first naturalist who studied the mouth-parts of a flea, with\nsuch microscopes as were then available, was Leeuwenhoek. He was\na Dutchman who worked at the end of the seventeenth century, and\nthe minute accuracy of whose observations still often fills modern\nnaturalists with wonder. Microscopic work was then in its early days,\nbut Leeuwenhoek clearly made out the two serrated lancets (Fig. 4)\nwhich are called the mandibles. His \u00e2\u0080\u009cMicroscopical observations on\nthe structure of the proboscis of a flea\u00e2\u0080\u009d were published in the\n_Transactions of the Royal Society_ in 1706.\n\nThe mouth-parts of fleas are differently constructed from those of\nall other insects. Around the orifice of the mouth are a number of\nappendages which form a complicated apparatus for piercing and\nsucking. Their construction and use cannot be described without\nemploying some technical terms. When the names of the parts have been\nmastered, a diagram will make their relative positions clear. It may\nbe necessary, first, to remind the reader who is not an entomologist\nthat the real _mouth_ of an insect is the entrance to the alimentary\ncanal, and that the appendages of the mouth, which act like jaws for\nmasticating or like tubes for sucking, are really modified limbs. In\nfleas the mouth is suctorial. But before sucking up the blood the flea\nmust first pierce the skin of its host. The paired mouth-parts, then,\nare modified limbs which correspond with those appendages on the thorax\nof an insect which we call the three pairs of legs.\n\nThe primitive insect, of which fleas and all other insects are\ndescendants, was, it is supposed, composed of a succession of segments\neach bearing a pair of jointed appendages. Insects of the present day\nnever have more than six legs, but the foremost pairs of appendages\nhave been bent round, reduced in size, and altered in shape so as to\nserve as mouth-parts.\n\nNow the mouth-parts of the flea for which only technical names exist\nare the maxill\u00c3\u00a6 and maxillary palpi, the labium and labial palpi, the\nmandibles and the labrum. The labrum is considered by some authorities\nto be the hypopharynx. It will be best to deal with each of these in\nturn and then to explain how they act in combination.\n\n_The maxill\u00c3\u00a6._ These are a pair of horny or chitinous triangular plates\none on either side of the flea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face. They are placed some distance\naway from the orifice of the mouth and to the right and left of it.\nThey do not serve for piercing or sucking, and appear to have no active\nfunction unless they serve to separate the hairs of the host and\nenable the flea to reach the bare skin. In the majority of bat-fleas\n(_Ceratopsyllid\u00c3\u00a6_) the maxill\u00c3\u00a6 are dumb-bell-shaped but in all other\nfleas they are more or less triangular. From the fore part of each\nsprings a palpus. Like other highly chitinised parts of a flea, the\nmaxill\u00c3\u00a6 are usually dark in colour.\n\n_The maxillary palpi._ These are jointed hairy feelers which project\nforwards and were mistaken by the older naturalists for antenn\u00c3\u00a6. They\nspring from the base of each of the maxill\u00c3\u00a6 where these latter organs\nare joined to the head of the flea. The palpi are sense-organs as the\nnumber of sensitive hairs on their surface indicates. The maxillary\npalpi of fleas are always composed of four segments.\n\n_The labium and labial palpi._ These form together what is called\nthe _rostrum_ of a flea. The labium is a single organ which projects\nbeneath the aperture of the mouth. It may be described as the lower\nlip of the flea. At its end it divides into two comparatively long\nbranches. These are the labial palpi. The actual piercing organs, which\nwill be described below, are the mandibles and labrum. They are not so\nconspicuous as the rostrum which protects them.\n\nWhen the piercing organs are at rest they are partly retracted. The\nexternal portion is encased in the tubular rostrum. The tube is formed\nby the two labial palpi which are situated at the apex of the short\nnon-divided labium. The number of segments composing each labial\npalpus in fleas varies, so far as we know, from two to seventeen. In\nmost fleas, however, the labial palpus consists of five segments. This\nappears to have been the original state of things in the ancestral\nflea; the palpus with more and the palpus with less segments being\nderived from the normal five-jointed one. The rostrum of a flea is\nnot a piercing organ like that of a fly and a bug. The two labial\npalpi separate and lie flat, right and left, on the skin when the true\npiercing organ is driven into the host. The labial palpi therefore\nrequire to be flexible, and this is attained by increasing the number\nof segments or by reducing the amount of chitinisation or horniness.\nWe shall find in the chigoes and their allies a rostrum which is pale,\nweak, soft and scarcely horny. Among other fleas where the rostrum is\nprolonged and strongly chitinised we shall find greater segmentation.\n\nThe small bristles at the extreme tip of the rostrum seem to be sensory\norgans. They are like those at the apex of the maxillary palpus. When a\nhungry flea is put on one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm, it appears to test the skin with these\nbristles before it ventures to make a puncture.\n\n_The mandibles._ These are a pair of sharp lancets with serrated edges.\nThey make the puncture and are interlocked with the labrum to form a\nsucking tube.\n\n_The labrum._ This is the central portion of the mouth-parts and is in\nfact a prolongation of the upper lip of the flea. It is a hard, sharp,\nawl-like instrument: in shape like a horny trough. Its edges are more\nor less toothed. Its apex is pointed and it is as long as the mandibles.\n\nThe general appearance and the relative positions of the mouth-parts\nare shown in Fig. 4.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 4. Diagram of the mouth-parts of a flea. The\nslender awl-like structure at the top is the _labrum_. Beneath are\nthe paired _mandibles_ with serrated edges. The four-jointed hairy\n_maxillary palpus_ is below, only one being shown. Protruding from the\nbase of the face is the _labium_ which supports the jointed _labial\npalpi_. The flat obtuse triangular structure from which the palpus\nsprings is the right-hand _maxilla_. The left maxilla is concealed\nbehind.]\n\nBearing in mind, then, that the piercing organs are the labrum and the\ntwo mandibles, and that the rostrum (composed of labium and labial\npalpi) is merely a sheath, it is easy to form a clear picture of a\nflea feeding. Anyone who is bold enough to place a hungry flea on\nthe bare skin of the arm can readily observe through a powerful lens\nwhat happens. When the flea has chosen a spot to pierce the skin, the\nrostrum, with the mandibles and long upper lip or labrum inside it, is\nmoved a little forward. The flea then lifts its abdomen upwards and\npresses the piercing organs down into the skin. In doing this, it uses\nits own weight and the strength of the foremost and middle pairs of\nlegs. The hind pair of legs are lifted up into the air. The head can\nsoon be seen coming nearer the skin. The rostrum then divides in the\nmiddle. The labial palpi are forced apart as the mandibles and labrum\npenetrate into the victim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flesh. Finally, they are driven entirely\nasunder and lie flat on the skin of the host, one to the right and\nthe other to the left. The flea then satisfies its hunger. A stream\nof blood is sucked up, and when the meal is over, there is a forcible\naction of the legs and the mandibles and upper lip are withdrawn with a\njerk. Numerous observers have remarked on the habit possessed by fleas\nof discharging the contents of their intestines whilst actually engaged\nin sucking. In many cases a drop of bright red blood is squirted from\nthe rectum during the operation of feeding, and this appears to be\na common practice among blood-sucking insects. Its bearing on the\nfeeding operation of the flea has not been discovered. But its possible\nconsequences in transmitting diseases from host to host will be seen in\na subsequent chapter on fleas and the transmission of plague.\n\nIt is said that the nervous systems and brains of fleas are not so\nhighly developed as those of many other insects such, for instance,\nas ants, bees and other Hymenoptera. Having drawn attention to the\ndistinction between the external skeleton of a flea and the internal\nskeleton of a vertebrate, one may with profit do the same in the case\nof their nervous systems. In both cases the nervous system serves to\nconvey sensations from the sense-organs, and movements to the muscles.\nIn the vertebrate, as the reader doubtless knows, there is a brain,\na nervous cord running from it down the backbone, and a number of\nnerves issuing, from the spinal cord and from the brain, in various\ndirections. Here the main nervous system runs down the _back_ of the\nanimal. In a flea, or other insect, the nervous system consists of a\nchain of ganglia connected by a nervous cord. A ganglion is a nerve\ncentre and, in a sense, each is a brain which may be likened to the one\nbrain of the vertebrate. We have in the cord of ganglia a series of\nbrains, as it were, running from the head down to the extremity of the\nabdomen. Each ganglion is a mass of nerve cells, from each of which a\nfibre passes off to unite with the other fibres and make a nerve. The\nfirst ganglion in a flea is placed in the upper part of the head above\nthe gullet. It may be called the brain since it receives the nerves\nof the antenn\u00c3\u00a6 and eyes. In the ancestral insect we may suppose that\nthere was a pair of ganglia in each segment. Since the head of the flea\nconsists of several fused segments, we may fairly draw the conclusion\nthat the brain is the result of the fusion of several pairs of ganglia.\n\nThe brain of the insect occupies the same position in the body as the\nbrain of the vertebrate; but the rest of the nervous system lies on the\nfloor of the body _under_ the digestive canal of the flea, whereas in\nthe vertebrate it lies along the back and _above_ the digestive canal.\nThe dorsal spinal cord of the vertebrate is then a ventral nervous cord\nin a flea.\n\nThe sensory nerves, which transmit sensations from different\nsense-organs, and the motor nerves, which send stimuli to the muscles,\ntake their origin from other ganglia besides the ganglion above the\ngullet. In bees and some other insects it has been shown that the\nnerves from the palpi and mouth-parts go to the next ganglion which\nis beneath the gullet. The same is probably the case with fleas; so\nwhen we speak of the _brain_ of a flea we must remember that it has a\nrelative rather than an absolute claim to that title. A flea has really\nmany brains.\n\nIn certain blind insects, where the eyes are wanting, parts of the\nbrain are completely atrophied. Whether this is so in the blind species\nof fleas does not seem to have been investigated.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 5. The antenna of a flea. A, concealed in the\ngroove. B, protruded from the head. The versatile _basal segments_ and\nthe terminal _club_, in this case with segments on one side of it,\nshould be noticed.]\n\nWe pass now from the central nervous system to the sense-organs of\nthe flea. The chief are the eyes, the antenn\u00c3\u00a6 and the pygidium. In\nregard to the eyes nothing more need be said. The antenn\u00c3\u00a6 are probably\nfar more important organs to a flea than its eyes; but inasmuch as\nthey are at ordinary times concealed in a groove they are not very\nconspicuous (Fig. 5). The first tolerably accurate plate of a flea by a\nnaturalist will be found in Hooke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s _Micrographia_ (1664). Robert Hooke\n(1635-1703) was a somewhat eccentric and irritable man of science who\nacted as secretary to the Royal Society. His labours were too varied to\nbe effective. He nearly discovered the laws of gravity and also studied\nfleas. To him belongs the credit of having detected the antenn\u00c3\u00a6 groove.\nJust as many of the older naturalists thought that the maxillary palpi\nwere antenn\u00c3\u00a6, so others thought that the antenn\u00c3\u00a6 of a flea were its\nears. And when, with the help of their lenses, they saw the antenn\u00c3\u00a6\nerected and protruded from their grooves, they imagined that the insect\nwas cocking its ears and listening after the manner of a horse or ass.\nBut the antenn\u00c3\u00a6 of fleas are much more to them than ears; though it\nmay be that they are also auditory organs. They are certainly tactile\nand olfactory organs as well. In outward structure each antenna\nconsists of two parts which may be called the stalk and the club. The\nclub is divided into a number of segments and is plentifully supplied\nwith hairs. In some species the cuts which divide the different\nsegments appear to be confined to one side of the club. In others a\nsort of central core holds the segments of the club together. The\nantenn\u00c3\u00a6, therefore, are undoubtedly exceedingly complex organs. Such\nan insect as a flea may well be far more sensitive to movements of the\nair, vibrations of the earth, smells, light rays and sound-waves than a\nhuman being. In their origin the antenn\u00c3\u00a6, like the paired mouth-parts,\nare modified appendages of the fused segments which compose the head\nof the insect. The fact that there are four pairs of appendages on the\ninsect\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head, viz. (1) antenn\u00c3\u00a6, (2) maxill\u00c3\u00a6, (3) labial palpi and (4)\nmandibles has been put forward by some entomologists as evidence that\nthe head is formed of four primary segments.\n\nAntenn\u00c3\u00a6 apparently enable fleas to find their bearings, to communicate\nwith one another and to discover the whereabouts of the opposite\nsex. But it is especially as organs of smell that they play a most\nimportant part in the flea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s social life. They enable couples to find\none another; and, when the sexes come together, the antenn\u00c3\u00a6 of the\nmale are usually raised and exposed from the groove. Insects generally\nhave some means of cleansing dirt from their antenn\u00c3\u00a6. Some make use of\ntheir legs, others of their mouth-parts. In fleas there is often a row\nof short hairs at the hind margin of the groove which may serve as a\nkind of comb for cleaning these delicate organs of sense. But further\nobservation on this point would be interesting, for no one appears to\nhave seen the comb in actual use. Female fleas are said usually to\ncarry their antenn\u00c3\u00a6 ensconced in the grooves, whilst the males more\nfrequently protrude theirs. The antenn\u00c3\u00a6 of the males are generally\nlonger than those of the females.\n\nThere are certain noteworthy organs of sense which appear to exist\non the upper surface of a flea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head and body. They take the form\nof small convexities of the body surface, lentil-shaped and each\nsurrounded at the base by a ring. Somewhat similar sense-organs are\nwidely spread through the insect world. As to their function, divergent\nviews are held. Some think that they are for the perception of sounds,\nsome for the perception of light rays, some for the perception of rays\nof which we are unconscious. Since these organs are placed, at times,\nin unprominent parts of the body it seems more probable that they are\naffected by sound than by light.\n\nThe preference which fleas show for certain animals, and the repulsion\nwhich they manifest on being allowed to suck blood from an unaccustomed\nhost, lead one to believe that they have a sense of taste. This sense\nin other insects is apparently seated in certain microscopic pits and\nhairs which form the ends of nerves and are distributed round the\nmouth. Whether fleas can hear is not, it seems, definitely known.\n\nA large number of fleas possess what is called a frontal tubercle. It\nis a notch in the centre of the forehead but nearer to the mouth than\nto the antenna. Sometimes the tubercle projects from a groove. This\nis most marked in the genus of African fleas _Listropsylla_. The real\nnature of this organ is unknown. Some regard it as an organ of sense.\nIts homology is also uncertain. To some it suggests the egg-breaker of\nthe larva and they regard it as a relic of the larval stage. To others\nit suggests an eye and they regard it as the remnant of an unpaired\nocellus possessed by the ancestral flea.\n\nAn exceedingly remarkable organ of sense, which is found in all fleas,\nis called the pygidium. It is a sensory-plate plentifully supplied with\nhairs and nerves and always placed on the back of the ninth abdominal\nsegment. Of all its uses we are still somewhat uncertain but some\nobservers declare that at the season of love the male flea bestows\ncaresses on the pygidium of the female.\n\nIn many species the male flea is sufficiently different in outward\nappearance from the female to be easily distinguished. The male is\nusually smaller and the last segments of the abdomen are so shaped\nas to give the look of a tail tilted into the air. The frontispiece\nrepresents a male flea and shows this well. The internal organs of\nreproduction (testes and ovaries) in the male and female are placed\nnear the end of the abdomen. The seminal outlet and common oviduct\nopen to the rear of the sensory plate on the ninth segment of the\nabdomen. The external genital armature of the male flea is exceedingly\ncomplicated and quite unlike that of any other insect. When the sexes\nare united, the usual position is reversed, and the male is _beneath_\nthe female.\n\nIt is well known to every entomologist that the hinder segments of\ninsects are often modified for reproductive purposes. In male fleas\nit is the eighth and ninth abdominal segments which are altered. In\nthe females the eighth, and also often a portion of the seventh,\nhas assumed a peculiar shape. The clasping organs of the male flea\nare portions of the ninth segment and form together a kind of claw\nreminding one of the pinchers of a lobster. It is used by the male flea\nin the breeding season to detain and hold the female.\n\nEvery entomologist also knows that the external sexual organs of\ninsects, of both sexes, are of special importance to the systematist or\nclassifying naturalist. They often enable him to recognise the species\nwhen other organs do not show sufficiently striking characters. A\nminute study of the genitalia of fleas is an absolute necessity to the\nsystematic entomologist, the more so as fleas do not present nearly\nas many, or nearly as varied, external differences as do the species\nof most winged insects where colour and pattern of wings are both\nimportant.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTHE INTERNAL ORGANS OF A FLEA\n\n\nA FLEA like every other animal must feed and breathe, which leads to\na consideration of the internal organs of digestion and respiration.\nThe digestive canal is a slender tube which connects the mouth and the\nanus, and which is less convoluted and much straighter than in the\nhigher vertebrates. Fig. 6 will show the relative positions of the\nvarious parts, namely, the mouth, pharynx, gullet, gizzard, stomach,\nand rectum. Connected with the digestive canal are certain glands and\norgans of excretion. The alimentary tube itself passes through the\nmiddle of the flea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body, and is kept in that position partly by\nmuscles and partly by the numerous branching air-tubes through which\nthe insect breathes. Above it lies the heart, and beneath it the\nnervous cord or chain of ganglia.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 6. Diagram of the alimentary canal of a flea.\nAt the top is shown the orifice of the _mouth_, leading into the\n_pharynx_. Next comes the short _gullet_. The _gizzard_ is the smaller\norgan immediately before the stomach. At the base of the _stomach_ are\nfour vermiform tubes, which are the _Malpighian tubules_. From the base\nof the stomach issues the _intestine_, which leads to the _rectum_,\nwhere the six _rectal glands_ are shown.]\n\nThe mouth of a flea, as of any other insect, is merely an orifice which\nforms the opening into the alimentary canal. Around the orifice are the\nvarious mouth-parts which convey blood to the mouth, but these, the\nreader will doubtless remember, are the modified limbs or appendages\nof the segments that compose the flea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head. The mouth, then, gives\naccess to the digestive canal. The first part nearest the mouth is the\npharynx which merges gradually into the gullet. Here is placed the\npharyngeal pump which is provided with a sucking apparatus. Muscles\nattached to the dorsal part of the so-called aspiratory pharynx cause\nit to expand and contract, owing to the elastic reaction of its walls.\nThe operating muscles, which do this, are in the head of the flea.\nWhen these pharyngeal muscles contract and relax in regular sequence,\na rhythmic action of the pharynx itself ensues and a steady stream\nof blood is forced or drawn from the mouth stomachwards. In a light\ncoloured flea, under a powerful lens, this action may be watched in the\nliving insect.\n\nBehind the pharynx comes the gullet, which leads down to the gizzard.\nIt is perhaps needless to add that this organ, neither in appearance\nnor in use, bears any resemblance to the gizzard of a bird, which\ngrinds hard food. The food of the adult flea consists solely of liquid\nblood.\n\nThe organ called _gizzard_ in the flea, for want of a better name,\nis, however, remarkable. Its function is not quite certainly known.\nIt is a bulbous expansion in the front of the stomach and situated at\nthe junction of the stomach and the gullet. It contains a multitude of\nchitinous finger-like processes tapering towards their extremities.\nFrom their general arrangement the complete collection of processes\nwould act as an effective sort of valve and prevent the return of\nthe fluids from the stomach. It seems most probable that this is\ntheir function. During the life of the flea the stomach is constantly\nchurning its contents. Some valvular arrangement between the stomach\nand the pharynx would seem to be essential; the pharynx is normally\ncollapsed, as the reader may remember, and its walls are drawn apart by\nmuscles attached to its exterior. When the pharynx is full of blood the\nmuscles relax, the walls collapse like elastic, and the blood is forced\ninto the stomach. In many cases a flea will feed when the stomach is\nalready tensely full of blood; and some sort of valve is therefore\nneeded to prevent regurgitation into the pharynx when the pharyngeal\nmuscles contract and the walls of the pharynx itself are drawn asunder.\n\nThis valvular arrangement at the anterior end of the flea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stomach has\nbeen minutely studied in connection with recent plague investigations,\nbecause there was a theory that fleas carried infection by vomiting\nthe septic\u00c3\u00a6mic blood from their stomachs and so transferred the plague\nbacillus to the puncture which they made in the skin.\n\nBut an experiment, which has been tried several times, seems to show\nthat the supposed valve is effective. The stomach of a flea which had\nrecently fed was dissected out intact. As long a portion of rectum as\npossible was left attached at the hinder end. The gullet having been\nsevered, well in front of the valve, pressure was applied with a blunt\ntool with the object of forcing the blood through the gullet. The hind\naperture of the stomach was, at the same time, closed by pinching\nup the rectum. The result was that, in no instance, was it possible\nto force blood through the passage which leads into the gullet. Yet\nsufficient pressure was applied to burst the stomach.\n\nThe stomach of a flea is a pear-shaped sack which occupies an\nappreciable part of the insect\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abdomen. That it is capable of\ncontaining a comparatively large amount of blood is apparent from the\nobservation that after a flea has enjoyed a good meal nearly the whole\nof the abdomen is seen to be filled with a bright red mass. During\nthe investigation of the part played by fleas in spreading plague an\nendeavour was made to measure, as accurately as possible, the average\ncapacity of a rat-flea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stomach when filled with blood. Healthy fleas,\ntaken from Bombay rats, were starved for twelve hours, and at the\nend of that time were fed on healthy animals. The stomach was then\ndissected out whole and floated in a salt solution. Any adherent organs\nor muscles were carefully removed. Under these conditions the stomach\ncan be examined and measured under the microscope. The average capacity\nof a rat-flea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stomach has been approximately estimated to be half a\ncubic millimetre.\n\nThe stomach of a flea is therefore, comparatively speaking, very large.\nThe blood remains in the stomach in a partially digested condition.\nIt gradually diminishes in volume, showing clearly that absorption\nis taking place. At the end of so much of the digestive process as\ntakes place in the flea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stomach, the blood has become reduced to a\nthick, slimy, dark red mass. This passes down the intestine to the\nrectum, where it is perhaps further influenced by the secretion of the\nso-called rectal glands. Finally, the undigested remains pass from the\nrectum in the form of very minute, round, almost black, tarry drops.\n\nThe terminal section of the flea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s digestive canal is called the\nrectum. Here are placed the rectal glands (Fig. 6), which are six in\nnumber. Their function seems not to be certainly known.\n\nThe external opening of the rectum is placed at the extreme end of the\nflea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body between the tergite and sternite of the tenth segment.\n\nWe pass now to a couple of quite distinct appendages of the digestive\ncanal, namely the salivary glands and the urinary tubules. In fleas\nthe salivary glands are four in number. Two are placed on each side of\nthe anterior end of the flea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stomach. Each is a simple acinous gland\nembedded in the body and lined with cells which secrete the saliva.\nThe four ducts from the pairs of glands unite to form two ducts; and\nthe two ducts thus formed run forward and open into the salivary pump.\nA spiral chitinous membrane lines the inside of the ducts, keeps them\ndistended, and gives them somewhat the appearance of tracheal tubes.\nThe salivary pump is placed quite in the front part of the insect\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhead, and is an organ worthy of special notice. It receives the saliva\nfrom the glands by means of the two salivary ducts which have just\nbeen described, and propels it through the exit duct of the pump into\nthe salivary canal in the mandibles. The pump itself is a hollow\nchitinous organ. Muscles attached to the walls alternately contract\nand relax, drawing up the salivary secretion and expelling it through\nthe exit-duct. The opening of the exit-duct is adjusted so as to be\nopposite to the canals which extend down the mandibles like troughs.\n\nIt would seem that when the flea is feeding, saliva is pumped into the\npuncture and blood is pumped out. There is, as it were, an effluent and\nan affluent stream passing along the mouth parts.\n\nThe urinary tubules are excretory organs which carry off, in solution,\nthe waste products of the flea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body. They are sometimes also called\nMalpighian tubes (Fig. 6). This name they received after Malpighi\n(1628-94), a famous Italian anatomist, who, four years after Harvey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndeath, saw with his own eyes the capillary circulation of which Harvey\nhad only inferred the existence. He also was the first to detect the\nurinary tubes of insects. These tubules answer to the kidneys of the\nhigher vertebrate. They vary in number in different insects from two\nto over a hundred. In fleas there are four. They are longish, slender,\ntubular glands which are closed at one end, but, at the other, open\ninto the rectum. The urinary excretions come from the blood, pass down\nthe tubes into the rectum, and so leave the flea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body by the anus. In\ninsects the urinary excretion is, generally, only partially liquid.\n\nThe organs of respiration in a flea consist of a series of trache\u00c3\u00a6,\nor air-tubes, which open by apertures, called stigmata, at the sides\nof the body. These air-tubes branch and form an elaborate system\nof ramifications. They have a horny lining and are supported by a\nspirally-wound thread-like thickening. In this way air is conveyed from\nthe external world, and the oxygen, which vital processes require, is\nconducted to all parts of the insect\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body.\n\nThe blood-system of a flea is far less complete than that of the\nlowest vertebrate. The blood is almost colourless. A large contractile\nheart drives it into the main blood-vessel. There is, however, no\nclosed system of arteries, capillaries, and veins such as the higher\nanimals possess; and the blood circulates in the whole cavity which\nintervenes between the body-wall and the various internal organs. There\nis little need for an elaborate system of blood-vessels since the\ninternal tissues are supplied with oxygen by the ramifying air-tubes.\nFleas have more of the air-holes called stigmata than any other\ninsects. Each of the three segments of the thorax has a pair, as well\nas the second to the eighth segments of the abdomen. The spiracles or\napertures lie free on the outside of the body. In beetles, and other\ninsects which run through dusty places, they are lodged in the thin\nmembrane between the segments.\n\nThe heart of a flea is a very delicate pulsating tube which lies\nalong the back, above the digestive canal and immediately beneath the\nintegument. One may attribute some of the extraordinary strength and\nvital energy of a flea to the fact that, by the blood-system and the\nair-system, the tissues of the body are kept richly supplied with\noxygen. The blood of a flea is a thin fluid and, of course, without red\ncorpuscles. The blood that is shed when a flea is crushed comes from\nthe stomach and not from the blood-vessels of the insect.\n\nThe internal organs of fleas cannot be studied without dissection\nunder a microscope. Dissection is best carried on in a solution of\nsalt and water. Fine needles mounted in penholders are the most handy\nimplements. But the point of even the finest commercial needle that can\nbe bought is too blunt for fine dissections, and it is necessary to\nsharpen it. This can be done by the help of a rapidly revolving emery\nwheel, varying the inclination of the needle-point to the wheel, so\nas to grind off the angles. The flea to be dissected is put in a drop\nof salt solution, on a slide placed on the stage of the dissecting\nmicroscope. In the left hand should be a needle with a blunt conical\npoint, in the right a needle with an oblique point. The antennary\ngroove of the flea should then be transfixed and held firmly by the\nleft-hand needle.\n\nThe point of the right-hand needle is then inserted under the edge of\nthe third or fourth abdominal segments. The segments can then be peeled\noff by a skilful dissector much as we peel off the skin of a shrimp for\nour tea at the sea-side. The internal organs of the flea then float off\nin the salt solution; and by using two very fine pointed needles they\ncan be further separated. It is useful to have one needle ready with a\nhooked end and another fashioned into a minute knife or scalpel.\n\nThe most conspicuous of the internal organs will be the stomach and\nintestine. The salivary glands will be found at the side of the stomach\nwith a certain amount of fat round them. Their extraction is not so\ndifficult as might be supposed. The hooked needle can be used to hook\nthe salivary duct.\n\nThe most difficult parts to dissect are the organs connected with the\nmouth and rostrum. It is best to remove the head and transfix it with\nthe left-hand needle, then to scalp the head by removing the dorsal\nhalf of the chitinous carapace. A bold plunge with the right-hand\nneedle will sometimes effect what is desired. A pull on the labium will\nsometimes bring out the pharynx. It must be confessed that successful\ndissections are often obtained more by good luck than by skilful\nmanagement. The use of dilute potash solution facilitates the study of\nchitinous parts by jellifying the muscles.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHE HUMAN FLEA AND OTHER SPECIES\n\n\nTHE human flea (_Pulex irritans_) appears to occupy an isolated\nposition. The genus _Pulex_ which Linn\u00c3\u00a6us established has now been\nreduced until it contains one species only. The human flea belongs to\nthe group with eyes and without combs. In some respects it is the\nmost specialized of all the _Pulicid\u00c3\u00a6_. The chigoes (_Sarcopsyllid\u00c3\u00a6_)\nresemble it and are doubtless derived from the _Pulicid\u00c3\u00a6_. The chief\nstructural character of this interesting insect is the greatly reduced\nthorax. But it can be distinguished from any other known flea by\nthe fact that the upper segment of the hind leg (hind coxa) bears a\nnumber of hairs on the inner surface of the posterior portion. A more\nnoteworthy feature in this flea is the presence, in a large proportion\nof specimens of both sexes, of a small tooth at the edge of the head.\nThis small tooth is sometimes absent; but, when present, both its\nposition and its structure indicate that it corresponds to the fifth\ntooth in the head comb of the dog-flea (_Ctenocephalus canis_) (Fig.\n7). In the hedgehog-flea (_Ct. erinacei_) the teeth of the combs both\non the head and on the thorax are small in size and few in number.\nOccasionally they almost disappear. The conclusion seems justified\nthat the human flea is descended from an ancestral form with combs. To\ndiscuss whether the combs became useless and were lost when the host\nlost the hairy covering of its body would lead into regions of vague\nspeculation and occupy time unprofitably.\n\nThe nearest allies of the human flea, which are found on various\nanimals, are all inhabitants of the Old World. The indigenous fleas of\nAmerica are only distant relatives of _Pulex irritans_. Our knowledge\nof the present and former distribution of this species is deplorably\nmeagre. The many books of travel published in the early part of the\nnineteenth century contain hardly any records of fleas. The human flea\nis now cosmopolitan. Specimens identical with those from Europe are\nfound almost everywhere. But it may be doubted whether this was the\ncase before the great era of travel and steam began in last century.\n\nThere is one strange and, indeed, inexplicable fact in connection with\nthe distribution of this cosmopolitan species of flea. It is absent\nfrom the oases of the Sahara and the Haussa countries immediately\nto the south of the great desert. These countries have long been in\ncommunication with places where _Pulex irritans_ is known to abound.\nThere is no natural barrier. The habits of the natives would encourage\nfleas to thrive, and other forms of human vermin are plentiful. There\nis, apparently, only one explanation that is forthcoming. It is\nsuggested that the soil and climate in these regions of Africa are, for\nsome reason, unsuited to fleas. In other parts of the Dark Continent,\nwhere there are European settlements, the human flea seems to thrive\nsurprisingly well and to attack Europeans and natives, as well as wild\nand domestic animals. In those parts of Asia where there are European\ncolonies and much intercourse between settlers and Orientals, _Pulex\nirritans_ is a well-established and thriving parasite. Unfortunately,\nthere is no means of knowing whether this was the case among the\nnative populations before European travellers and traders arrived.\n_Pulex irritans_ has, however, recently been found on the natives of\nGerman New Guinea living some 10,000 feet above sea-level and in great\nisolation. Seaports are everywhere infested with fleas.\n\nAnother problem on which no light has been thrown concerns the\nevolution of the human flea. It would be of great interest to know\nwhether the present species has undergone modifications of form since\nit became a parasite of the human race; whether we inherited the\nspecies from our simian ancestors; or whether the flea of one of the\nlower mammals became parasitic on mankind. In the Old World this flea\nis essentially a parasite of man. It occurs only occasionally on other\nmammals. In America it certainly appears to occur more frequently on\nmammals, other than man, than it does in the Old World. Human fleas\ncan propagate in deserted human dwellings. The larv\u00c3\u00a6 find nourishment\nin any refuse that has been left behind, and the adult insect can\napparently continue for some time to reproduce itself without a meal of\nany sort and certainly without human blood. Travellers in the East and\nin Africa have described how on entering huts in deserted villages they\nhave found their clothing covered with myriads of fleas, sometimes\nravenous, and at others weak from long fasting.\n\nThe human flea is a good deal more select in the choice of a host than\nsome other species. The cat-flea (_Ctenocephalus felis_) has been found\nnot only on the cat, but also on the dog, tiger, leopard, goat, horse,\nrat, hedgehog, kangaroo, deer, guinea-pig, rabbit, and on man. Many of\nthese were specimens collected in zoological gardens. Although when\nhungry and confined in a test-tube the human flea will readily bite a\nrat or a guinea-pig, it has been found that human fleas kept with no\nother food-supply than rats and guinea-pigs soon die off.\n\nWhen large numbers of human fleas were wanted for experiments in\nBombay, guinea-pigs were used as traps to attract them. On one occasion\ntwo guinea-pigs placed in a house which had been vacant for some days,\nand in which fleas must have been short of food, failed to attract any\nof this species; while a man who entered the house shortly afterwards\nacted as an admirable trap. Those who have not had experience of the\nabundance and voracity of fleas in oriental countries can hardly\nbelieve the numbers of human fleas that may be captured by sending a\nbare-legged man into a deserted house and then picking the fleas off\nhim. In one house 31 _P. irritans_ were taken on a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legs in a\nfew minutes. In another house 84 _P. irritans_, 8 cat-fleas and 1\nbird-flea were caught. In a third, 150 _P. irritans_ and 4 cat-fleas\nwere captured in a short time.\n\nThe piercing organs of the human flea are strong and well developed.\nThis is rare in a flea which, far from having adopted stationary\nhabits, is a very active insect. It has been suggested, with some show\nof probability, that the wide and strongly serrated mandibles were\nacquired after man became the host. The naked skin and rough garment\nof mankind would render the claws and legs of the flea insufficient to\nkeep the insect in a steady position when feeding. Natural selection\nwould, in due course, strengthen the mouth organs.\n\nThe division of mankind into different races, many of which are quite\nas distinct as the various species of some genus among other animals,\nleads one to expect various races among the fleas which are parasitic\non them. If the sand-martin and the house-martin, the rat and the mouse\nhave distinguishable fleas, one might suppose that the Caucasian and\nthe Hottentot, the Australian native and the Red Indian would follow\nsuit. It may be that further study will show that the human flea now\nconsists of a number of different races. In only one case, however,\ndoes a development of this kind in fact appear. Fleas taken off Mexican\nIndians show slight but fairly constant differences from the true\n_Pulex irritans_. The specimens are smaller in size, the rostrum is\nlonger and the clasper of the male is more pointed. If the Mexican\nIndians have a special race of human flea it must have developed after\nthe Indians came to America, or they must have brought it with them\nwhen they came. In the latter case this race of flea may still exist in\nthe country whence these Indians originally came.\n\nApart from this apparently constant race, the individual variation in\nspecimens of the human flea is slight. If a large series of mounted\nspecimens are examined with the microscope, it will be noticed that the\nbristles or spines on the legs are sometimes more or less numerous.\nBut, with this exception, marked varieties such as are frequently found\namong other insects seem to be rare.\n\nAlthough mankind is the true host of this flea, it has been obtained\nin various parts of the world on various mammals and occasionally on\nbirds. But in England, and probably in other parts of Europe as well,\n_Pulex irritans_ is an undoubted parasite of the badger. A good series\nof the insect has been got from wild badgers freshly captured near\nReading in Berkshire and Hastings in Sussex. In other parts of the\nworld it has been obtained from a variety of small carnivora: cats,\ndogs, foxes, jackals and polecats. It has also been found on Rodents\n(_Gerbillus_) and on Insectivora (_Erinaceus_). In South Africa it has\nbeen taken off a caracal and in North America off a lynx.\n\nSandy places such as sea-beaches and picnic grounds, where humanity\ncongregates for pleasure or business, frequently swarm with this\nspecies of flea waiting an opportunity to feed. The larv\u00c3\u00a6 are bred in\nthe sand and feed on organic refuse.\n\nThe genus most closely allied to that which contains the human\nflea consists also of a single species only. It is a large flea\n(_Pariodontis riggenbachi_) found on porcupines all over Africa and in\nIndia.\n\nMankind is, occasionally, bitten by a variety of other species\nbesides _Pulex irritans_. In hot countries the chigoe (_Dermatophilus\npenetrans_) is a serious and troublesome pest, particularly to\nbare-footed people. In temperate regions there are rat-fleas,\ncat-fleas, dog-fleas and bird-fleas which occasionally transfer\nthemselves to man and feast on his blood. But, on the whole, hunger and\npropinquity rather than free inclination seem to actuate these fleas of\nwhich man is only the occasional host. There are besides very numerous\nspecies which have never under any circumstances been known to bite\nman. There is no doubt that some persons are more attractive to fleas\nthan others. The reason for this we do not know. It may depend on the\ntenderness of their skin, the quality and taste of their blood, or\ntheir personal smell, or possibly all three combined.\n\nThe various forms of rat-flea which are important in carrying plague\nfrom rodents to the human race are dealt with later on. Among the\ncommonest fowl-fleas which bite man are _Ceratophyllus gallin\u00c3\u00a6_ and\n_C. gallinul\u00c3\u00a6_. Both species infest the nests of many common passerine\nbirds besides the domestic fowl. A common parasite of the pigeon is _C.\ncolumb\u00c3\u00a6_, which also bites man.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 7. The head of a female dog-flea (above) and a\nfemale cat-flea (below) to illustrate the difference in shape. In the\nmales the difference is less strongly marked but quite perceptible.\nFrom _Novitates Zoologic\u00c3\u00a6_, Vol. XII, January, 1905.]\n\nDog-fleas and cat-fleas frequently transfer themselves to man. It\nhas been asserted that the flea of the dog and the flea of the cat\nare indistinguishable. Several great authorities on fleas, such as\nDr Carlo Tiraboschi in Italy and Mr Carl Baker in the United States,\nhave maintained that the differences between _Ctenocephalus canis_ and\n_Ct. felis_ were unreliable and that they are not distinct species.\nMr Charles Rothschild has, however, shown that the two species are\nabundantly distinct. The _males_ of these two insects can be readily\ndistinguished from each other by differences exhibited in their\nrespective sexual organs. The _females_ can be distinguished, at a\nglance, by the different shape of their respective heads. Fig. 7, which\nshows the head of a female dog-flea above and of a female cat-flea\nbelow, illustrates this. It will be seen that _Ct. felis_ has a much\nlonger and more pointed head than _Ct. canis_. In the _males_ the\ndifference in the shape of the head is less strongly marked, but is\nquite perceptible. There are several minor differences in addition\nwhich serve, but less clearly, to distinguish these two insects. The\nfirst genal spine, or first tooth in the head-comb, is shorter in the\ndog-fleas of both sexes than it is in the cat-fleas. The abdominal\nstigmata appear to be larger in a dog-flea than in a cat-flea, and\nthere are differences in the bristles which seem to be constant. Both\nspecies are perceptibly larger than human fleas, and dog-fleas have\nalways afforded good material for dissection. Very few dogs seem to be\nexempt from fleas, and the little pets which are carried in ladies\u00e2\u0080\u0099\narms are often swarming with them.\n\nThis account of a despised and detested group of insects would be very\nimperfect if it did not mention those educated or performing fleas\nwhich have evoked so much astonishment among people who have watched\nthem. It will be best to say, at once, that the fleas are not educated\nand that the performance can only be attributed to their desire to\nescape. It is stated that a performing flea may be broken of the habit\nof jumping by being put in a pill-box with glass sides which is made to\nrevolve like a lottery wheel. A short course of this tread-mill teaches\nthe flea that the objectionable practice of hopping is useless and\nexhausting. It is said that the life of performing fleas averages eight\nmonths, which seems surprising. They are fed every few days, and the\ntrainers delight in showing the punctures on their arms where the swarm\nof pets has been fed.\n\nPerforming fleas are first of all securely fastened, and this is\nnine-tenths of the secret, and the art of education. A very fine silk\nfibre is put round the body and knotted on the back. The flea may\nthen be cemented to some moveable or immoveable object. It may pull a\ncoach by being attached to a pole made of a bristle. A little paper\nobject stuck on its back is termed by courtesy an equestrian or a\nball-dress. The lively imagination of the spectators is of great help.\nThe strength of a flea is wonderful, and on being placed on a sheet of\nblotting-paper, so that the hooks of the feet get a hold, the coach\ntravels at a fine pace. In the intervals of the performance the coach\nis turned over, and the performer with its feet in the air does not get\nexhausted with needless struggles. Or else the fleas are fixed head\nuppermost, with their legs extended horizontally, to an upright wire\ndriven into the table. Ladies have fans of tissue paper gummed to their\nlimbs. Gentlemen are in the same way supplied with swords made out of\nfine segments of wire. When two swordsmen are placed opposite each\nother and the table is knocked they move their limbs. The swords then\nclash by chance, and we have a representation of a duel not much worse\nthan may be seen in provincial or even London melodrama.\n\nMore wonderful are dancing fleas, for there we have a real\nrepresentation of a ball-room filled with waltzers. The orchestra\nof fleas, all securely fixed with cement, is placed above a little\nmusical-box. The music proceeds from the box, but the vibrations make\nthe fleas gesticulate violently over their musical instruments. The\ndancers spin round on the ball-room floor. The couples are fastened by\na rigid bar opposite each other, so that they cannot touch or part.\nEach is pointed in an opposite direction, and tries to run away. A\nrotary motion ensues which, to the spectators if not to the fleas, is\nvery like waltzing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE CHIGOES AND THEIR ALLIES\n\n\nTHE chigoes and their allies belong to a group of fleas sufficiently\nremarkable to deserve a somewhat detailed account. The reader may\nremember that they form a family to which the name of _Sarcopsyllid\u00c3\u00a6_\nhas been given. They are the most completely parasitic of any fleas;\nand the South American chigoe (_Dermatophilus penetrans_) enjoys the\ndistinction of being the first foreign flea ever described. This\npestilent insect, of which the female has the habit of burrowing into\nthe flesh of the host, soon made itself known to the early travellers\nin the tropics of America. Oviedo, the Spaniard and historiographer\nof South America, in his _Historia General y Natural de las Indias_\n(1551), seems to have been the first European author who mentions\nit. After this the chigoe is referred to by writers of various\nnationalities in many works which were published during the sixteenth,\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It is an insect which appears\nunder a vast number of different names: chigoe, chigue, chego,\nchigger, chique, jigger, pico, sico, migua, nigua, ton, and tschike are\nsynonymous. Catesby in his _Natural History of Carolina_ (1743) gives a\nfigure of the insect, which is easily recognisable. Linn\u00c3\u00a6us, in 1758,\ndescribed the chigoe as _Pulex penetrans_, and apparently did not know\nmuch of its appearance beyond what he learnt from Catesby\u00e2\u0080\u0099s picture.\nThis species and the human flea were the only two which the great\nSwedish naturalist distinguished by a name; though, under the title\n_Pulex irritans_, he includes a number of different species such as the\nfleas from the dog, cat, rabbit and fowl. The chigoe remained the only\nmember of the family known to scientific entomologists until the year\n1860. An allied insect was then found on a South American parrot. A\nthird member of the family was soon after discovered, and is noteworthy\nbecause it was the first species recorded from the Old World. It is now\nknown to infest the domestic fowl in all warm countries where these\nbirds have been introduced by man. A fourth species was collected from\na South American bat. Up to the present time some fourteen different\nspecies (belonging to three very distinct genera) have been described,\nand there cannot be the slightest doubt that, when collectors in hot\ncountries turn their attention to the matter, a great many other forms\nof this interesting family of fleas will be found.\n\nThe chigoes and their allies are of special interest for more than one\nreason. The females are to a greater or less degree stationary; they\nfix themselves firmly to their hosts and become veritable parasites.\nSeveral of the earlier zoologists believed that the animal was a mite;\nand it is somewhat remarkable that Oviedo himself should have so\npromptly detected the relationship of the insect he saw with the fleas.\nBy reason of the parasitic habits of the females, more is known about\ntheir appearance and life than in the case of the more active males.\nIn some species the males remain, for the present, quite unknown: and\nnot very much is recorded about the early life-history, eggs, larv\u00c3\u00a6\nand pup\u00c3\u00a6 of either sex. The parasitic habits of the chigoes and other\nallied fleas lead one to expect peculiar modifications of form such as\nare usually to be observed when an animal passes from an active to a\nstationary life. These modifications are the more easily understood as\nthe various species are not all stationary to the same degree. It is\nfairly plain that this family of fleas is a development from the less\nspecialised and less parasitic family _Pulicid\u00c3\u00a6_. In fact the gradual\ndevelopment of the organs from a generalised to a more specialised\nstage is strikingly shown in these insects. To follow this in detail\nwould, however, require a very minute and technical knowledge of their\nform.\n\nThe chigoe family is so well characterised that a student of fleas\ncannot possibly have any doubt whether a flea belongs to this family or\nnot. Yet there is great diversity in general appearance, as well as in\ndetails of structure. One very peculiar character, namely the enormous\nswelling of the abdomen in pregnant females is, moreover, shared with\ncertain other fleas. The most distinguishing character of the family,\nhowever, is the rostrum. This organ, which it may be well to remind the\nreader, consists of the under-lip and the labial palpi, sheaths the\npiercing and sucking mouth-parts. In the chigoes and their allies the\nrostrum is reduced, not in length, but in stiffness and in number of\nsegments. In this group there are never more than three segments to the\nrostrum, whilst in the main group of fleas, with one or two exceptions\nsuch as the rabbit-flea (_Spilopsyllus cuniculi_), there are never less\nthan five. There is no indication of a comb on the head, but all the\nfamily, without exception, have a large triangular projection, which\nis more or less curved backwards, at each side of the head. These two\norgans doubtless discharge the same functions as the combs of other\nfleas, and prevent the insect from slipping back as it works its way\nthrough the fur or feathers of the host.\n\nThe thorax of a chigoe is exceedingly short. Two reasons for this may\nbe suggested. In the first place, the jumping power of these fleas is\nvery small and the muscles in the thorax are consequently reduced.\nIn the second place, the value to the insect of a contracted thorax\nis obvious; for the abdomen of a chigoe fixed on or in the skin of an\nanimal does not project so much as it would were the thorax of normal\nlength. The troublesome parasite is, therefore, less likely to be\nrubbed off by the host.\n\nIn most fleas the piercing organs of the mouth (upper lip and\nmandibles) are directed obliquely downwards. In the chigoes they are\ndirected obliquely forwards. It has been suggested that this forward\nmovement of the mouth is connected with the stationary life which the\nfemales assume. Fleas which fasten themselves permanently to the skin\nof their host, do so in a manner similar to ticks. The mouth-parts are\nin a line with the longitudinal axis of the body. This attitude, so far\nas we know, is assumed by the females of all the family. The females of\none genus, _Dermatophilus_, actually go head foremost right into the\nskin of their host. The shape of the head is also beautifully adapted\nto enable the insect to fix itself firmly in a tick-like posture. The\nfore-part is remarkably obtuse, and almost has the appearance of being\ntruncate and abruptly cut off. When the piercing organs have been\nthrown forward horizontally it must be a great support to the insect,\nwhich is fixed by them, if it can press its head down firmly against\nthe skin of the host. The wider the extent of forehead which can be\npressed against the skin of the host the less the strain on the upper\nlip and mandibles, which serve as anchors, when the host scratches.\n\nAll the chigoe family have eyes; but in one recently discovered species\nthe eye is very small and devoid of pigment. Like those of other fleas,\nthe antenn\u00c3\u00a6 fit into grooves at the side of the head, and the club,\nwhich is the sensitive part of the organ, consists of eight segments.\nIn a good many fleas the antenn\u00c3\u00a6 are different in the two sexes, but\nthere is no obvious sexual distinction in this family.\n\nThe peculiar development of the mouth-parts is one of the most singular\nfeatures in the structure of the chigoes and their relatives. These\nimportant organs are modified in a fashion not to be found in any fleas\noutside the family. Here, as in other fleas, the mandibles are piercing\norgans which penetrate the skin of the host, the upper lip serving\nin conjunction as a sucking tube. In ordinary fleas these organs are\nretracted when the insect has done its meal; in the present family they\nremain, in the case of the females, apparently permanently fastened in\nthe skin. The piercing organs are broader and the serrate edges of the\nmandibles more solid and heavy in this family than in the case of other\nfleas.\n\nThe two methods by which fleas keep in touch with their hosts have\nalready been alluded to. The two main fixing and clinging organs are\nthe mouth and the claws. Weak mouth-parts accompany strong legs. We\nobserve, accordingly, two lines of development. The chigoes and their\nallies present an extreme case: for the legs are practically useless\nfor holding on. The bristles, and the claws as well, are exceedingly\nthin. In this family the mandibles serve the purpose of claws. The\nother line of development is best seen in a genus of fleas from South\nAmerica (_Malacopsylla_), where the piercing organs are short and weak,\nwhilst the claws and bristles of the legs are very strongly developed.\n\nThe modification found in the rostrum of the chigoes has already been\nreferred to, and the explanation of this will now be understood. The\nrostrum is a sheath, on either side of the piercing organs, consisting\nof an under lip and two labial palpi. When the flea sucks, the labial\npalpi are pushed asunder, as the piercing organs are driven in, and\nlie flat on the skin of the host. In this family the rostrum is almost\nwhite in colour and soft instead of being horny or chitinised. Where\nthe rostrum is strongly chitinised or very horny the flea has to use\na certain amount of force to counteract the spring-like action of the\nlabial palpi. It is conceivable that rigid labial palpi would prove\ninconvenient to fleas which remain permanently attached to their host\nby their mouth organs.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 8. Pregnant female of _Dermatophilus c\u00c3\u00a6cata_, a\nSouth American chigoe which burrows into the flesh of the host. The\nabdomen swells until it surrounds the head and thorax, which are shown\nin the centre. The natural size is about equal to a small pea.]\n\nThe swollen abdomen of the female chigoe is a strange and a conspicuous\nobject, which is not, however, found occurring to the same extent in\nall the members of the family. Having burrowed into the flesh of a\nman, or other mammal, the pregnant female swells and enlarges until\nshe reaches the gigantic proportions of a small pea. Itching and\ninflammation ensue unless the whole insect be skilfully removed with\na needle. To such an extent does the abdomen swell that the segments\nand the horny plates are driven asunder and the connecting membrane\nbetween is exposed to view. In the extreme case of _Dermatophilus\nc\u00c3\u00a6cata_ from South America the abdomen swells until it completely\nenvelopes the head and thorax after the manner shown in Fig. 8. Dr\nEnderlein found seventeen specimens of this species in the skin behind\nthe ears of a rat from Brazil.\n\nThe belief that the eggs are laid in the flesh of the victim is\nmistaken. The hind segments of the body and their stigmata are always\nexposed to the air. The stigma of the eighth abdominal segment is\nparticularly large. As soon as the eggs have been laid, the body of\nthe mother dies, withers, and falls away from the skin of the host.\nThe fact that several females are often found where one has buried\nherself, led to the notion that these parasites bred in the wound. The\ntruth seems to be that other chigoes are attracted to a spot where\ninflammation has made it easy to burrow.\n\nChigoes love warmth and drought. The deserted huts of natives swarm\nwith them if they are dry. It is always said that newcomers are more\nliable to attack than natives; but the explanation of this seems to be\nthat they do not understand the significance of the slight pricks which\nare felt when the chigoe fixes itself. Once the parasite has got under\nthe skin no pain is felt unless the wound is inflamed by scratching.\nThe tender flesh under toe-nails is a favourite spot of attack. The\nonly remedy is a sharp knife and a little antiseptic wash. Pigs and\nfowls are sometimes killed by chigoes, and Indians occasionally are\nattacked by lockjaw after the parasite has been removed. But this is\nnot directly attributable to the chigoe. The eggs are laid one by\none; when this operation is completed the mandibles weaken and the\nshrivelled body of the insect can be rubbed off. But a painful sore may\nbe produced if the parasite is forcibly broken off and the mouth-parts\nare left in the wound.\n\nThe chigoe (_Dermatophilus penetrans_) is a native originally of South\nAmerica. It ranges from Mexico to Northern Argentina. Some time after\nthe middle of the nineteenth century it was, somehow, carried across\nthe Atlantic and introduced into West Africa. From there it has now\nspread across the Dark Continent to the Great Lakes, and has even\nreached Madagascar. Such are the modern facilities of transport which\nparasites are quick to take advantage of.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nFLEAS AND PLAGUE\n\n\nIN order to understand the part played by fleas in the transmission\nof plague it is necessary to have some clear elementary knowledge of\nthe nature of that disease. Plague is an infectious fever caused by\na specific bacterial organism. _Bacillus pestis_ was first identified\nin 1894 by Kitasato, a Japanese, and immediately afterwards, but\nindependently, by Yersin. It is an exceedingly minute, short,\nmoderately thick, oval bacillus, with rounded ends. It has the most\nastounding power of rapid multiplication. Nothing is, at present, known\nof its natural history outside the body of the sufferer, but it can\nbe cultivated. Little is known of its toxic action, but a weak toxin\nhas been got from cultures. The bacillus itself is not of a resistant\nnature and is easily killed by heat and ordinary germicides. Acids\nappear to be fatal to it.\n\nIn ordinary cases the bacillus is found in buboes. A _bubo_ is nothing\nmore than an inflamed gland. In so-called septic\u00c3\u00a6mic cases it is found\nin the blood of the animal afflicted by the disease. In pneumonic\ncases the bacillus may be found in the sputum of the patient. It is\nthe custom to speak of (_a_) bubonic plague, (_b_) septic\u00c3\u00a6mic plague,\n(_c_) pneumonic plague, as though they were three diseases. This is\ninaccurate: for they are only forms, with varying symptoms, of one and\nthe same disease caused by the same bacillus.\n\nThe disease which we call plague is, in truth, really a fight between\nthe afflicted animal and the invading bacillus. It may be inferred\nfrom the fact that bacilli are scarcely ever found in the blood in\nbubonic cases that the invaders are stopped by the lymphatic glands\nnext above the point of inoculation. In such cases the fight, which is\nthe illness, takes place chiefly in the bubo. In non-bubonic cases the\nfight goes on in the blood-vessels or in the lungs as the case may be.\n\nWhether the plague is primarily a disease of rats would be difficult to\nsay; but rats and other rodents are very susceptible to it. It has also\nbeen transferred to mice, rabbits, guinea-pigs, squirrels, pigs, sheep,\ngoats, cattle and horses. Men and monkeys are equally susceptible. Cats\nand dogs have been known to die of it and during the Great Plague of\nLondon many were destroyed under the belief that they were bearers of\ninfection.\n\nThat plague among human beings was associated with mortality among rats\nand mice, is an observation of great antiquity. The student of the\nHebrew scriptures will remember the Book of I Samuel vi. 4: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen said\nthey, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him?\nThey answered, Five golden emerods [buboes] and five golden mice [rats]\naccording to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague\nwas on you all and on your lords.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nEastern authors, of a later date, refer in several places to rats, in\ntimes of plague, staggering about as though they were drunk. The Mogul\nEmperor Jehangir in his diary of the plague at Agra (1618) mentions\nthe unusual mortality of the rats. In India it seems long to have been\na custom, dictated by experience and caution, to leave houses when\nrats began to die. In Europe, during the middle ages, the mortality of\nrats when the plague was raging does not seem to have impressed the\nchroniclers and during the recent outbreak at Glasgow (1900) none was\ndetected.\n\nAs an illness of mankind, the plague reached Europe from the East. We\nhave no evidence of any outbreak in Europe before the reign of the\nEmperor Justinian. When it raged for the first time at Constantinople\n(A.D. 542) the mortality was enormous. Ten thousand persons are said to\nhave died in a day with all the symptoms of bubonic plague.\n\nIt spread swiftly through the Roman Empire. In the fourteenth century\nthe same disease under the name of the Black Death again ravaged\nEurope. Again the mortality was enormous. Millions perished little\nsuspecting that fleas could be connected with their fate. Everywhere\npopular tradition reported the plague as the most highly contagious of\nall diseases.\n\nIn the history of science the plague epidemics in Egypt between 1833\nand 1845 are of importance, because the disease was, for the first\ntime, seriously studied by skilful French physicians. Some of the\nFrench medical school went so far as to deny contagion altogether.\nThe modern view is that aerial infection may be put aside as almost\nimpossible except in pneumonic cases; but that plague may be\ntransmitted by any method which inoculates the blood with _Bacillus\npestis_.\n\nOur modern knowledge dates from the year 1894 when the plague reached\nHong Kong. Its existence as a rat disease was recognised. In the\nautumn of 1896, when plague broke out in India, the men of science,\nwho made careful observations on the spot, were struck by the fact\nthat infection spread from house to house in a fashion that seemed\ninexplicable, unless the bacillus was carried by an animal.\n\nWe pass now from rats to fleas. That fleas might be connected with the\nspreading of plague was suggested in the year 1897 when Ogata first\nfound bacilli in fleas. He obtained fleas from plague-sick rats. These\nhe crushed, and injected the liquid into a couple of mice. One of\nthese died of plague in three days. The German Plague Commission in\nBombay found plague bacilli in fleas, but, for various reasons, did not\nconsider that the bite of the flea was the means by which the disease\nwas transmitted.\n\nThe real credit is due to Simond, a Frenchman, who worked during the\nIndian epidemics. He took fleas from infected animals and observed in\ntheir stomachs bacilli identical with _B. pestis_. He suggested that\nthe bacillus was carried from rats to men; and he brought forward some\nevidence tending to show that infected fleas could transmit infection\nby biting. But Simond was not able to bring forward conclusive\nproof. He pointed out a line of research to others which has proved\nexceedingly fruitful. In the same year (1898) Hankin suggested that\nsome biting insect might be the means of transmission from rats to man.\nThe bacillus of plague has now been identified in ants, bugs, and flies\nas well as fleas. It seems likely that any suctorial insect which feeds\non a plague-stricken rat will take numbers of the bacilli into its\nstomach.\n\nThe points which Simond wished to establish were that plague-stricken\nrats with fleas are exceedingly infective, that they cease to be\ninfective when they have been deserted by their fleas, and that fleas\nwhich infest rats will transfer themselves to man. Since 1905 an\nelaborate series of observations and experiments have been carried out.\nPost-mortems have been made of countless rats. Numberless fleas have\nbeen collected and dissected. But this summary would be very incomplete\nif it did not mention the work of Verjbitski, a Russian doctor at\nCronstadt, whose labours remained almost unnoticed although he made his\nexperiments as long ago as 1902-1903. His thesis, written in Russian,\nwas not published in any scientific journal. But his ingenious and\ncareful experiments showed that fleas could transmit plague from animal\nto animal. He found that the commonest flea captured off rats at\nCronstadt was _Leptopsylla musculi_, the usual host of which in other\nplaces is the mouse. Now this flea does not, except very rarely, bite\nhuman beings, and the real significance of the facts discovered was not\nappreciated.\n\nThe common rat-flea in most parts of Europe is _Ceratophyllus\nfasciatus_ and in India and sub-tropical countries _Xenopsylla\ncheopis_. This last species has acquired the title of \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe plague\nflea,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or, more accurately, the oriental rat-flea.\n\nDuring the plague investigations in India many careful experiments have\nbeen made proving beyond doubt that the disease may be transferred from\nrat to rat by the transference of fleas from a septic\u00c3\u00a6mic to a healthy\nanimal. It was first shown that when fleas were present the plague\ncould be transferred from rat to rat, kept in proximity, but carefully\nscreened so as to avoid any possibility of contact. Next, fleas were\ncollected from rats dead or dying of septic\u00c3\u00a6mic plague and transferred\nto healthy rats living in flea-proof cages. More than half of the\nhealthy rats contracted plague. It was shown that if fleas are present,\nthe disease once started spreads from animal to animal; and it would\nseem that the rate of progress was in direct proportion to the number\nof fleas present.\n\nThe blood of a plague-infected rat may contain an enormous number of\nplague bacilli. Although such figures do not convey any very clear\nidea of numbers, as many as a hundred million bacilli have been found\nin a cubic centimetre of rat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blood. A rat-flea, with a stomach of\naverage size, might receive therefore as many as 5000 germs into its\nstomach; and it is clear that fleas feeding on a large proportion of\nplague-infected rats just before death would be almost certain to\nimbibe at least some plague bacilli. There is, moreover, good evidence\nfor believing that multiplication of the plague bacilli may take place\nin the flea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stomach. Nor does the blood imbibed by the flea cease to\nbe infective when it passes from the stomach. Both the contents of the\nrectum and the excrements of fleas taken from plague rats often contain\nabundant and actively virulent plague bacilli. A number of infected\nfleas are put into a test-tube: the mouth of the tube is covered with\na glass slide, and the mouth is turned upside down. The fleas are\nthen seen to run over the slide, and, in a short time, they deposit\nan appreciable amount of f\u00c3\u00a6cal matter on the surface. This under the\nmicroscope is seen to be covered with plague bacilli; and a large\npercentage of guinea-pigs, who have an emulsion of the f\u00c3\u00a6cal matter\ninjected into them, contract plague.\n\nIt is remarkable that, so far as we know at present, the plague\nbacillus is confined to the flea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s alimentary canal. On rare occasions\nit is found in the gullet when fleas have been killed immediately after\nfeeding on septic\u00c3\u00a6mic blood. But no plague bacillus has been found in\nthe body-cavity or in the salivary glands.\n\nIn the stomach of the flea, plague bacilli have been found in vast\nnumbers twelve and even twenty days after the insect has imbibed\nseptic\u00c3\u00a6mic blood. It is naturally of great practical importance to\nknow how long fleas taken from plague-infected rats remain infective:\nthat is to say, are capable of transmitting the infection to healthy\nanimals. Two series of careful experiments, made during the epidemic\nplague season in India, have shown that fleas could remain infective\nfor as long as fifteen days. In a third series of experiments, made\nduring the non-epidemic season, it was found that the fleas remained\ninfective for only seven days.\n\nIt has been ascertained that both the male and the female oriental rat\n(_X. cheopis_) flea can transmit plague.\n\nWe come now to one of the most interesting questions of all: namely,\nthe method by which the rat-flea transmits plague to a healthy animal.\n\nA variety of suggestions have been made, several of which can be\nshortly dismissed. It was thought, at one time, that infection might\nbe conveyed by the animal eating the infected fleas. But it is very\nimprobable that this means of infection is of any real importance, even\nif it may sometimes occur. Experiments in feeding have shown that an\nanimal is unlikely to become infected by swallowing material containing\nplague bacilli, unless the amount is considerable. Moreover we know\nthat infected fleas confined in test-tubes readily convey the disease\nwhen allowed to bite an animal. In such cases the situation of the\nprimary bubo corresponds with the area of skin upon which the fleas are\nplaced. That the transmission of plague is due to the _bite_ of the\nflea seems abundantly clear.\n\nIt has also been suggested that the proboscis of the flea acts as a\nmechanical instrument for the transference of the bacilli. No doubt\nthe outside surface of the flea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proboscis must become contaminated,\nwhen it sucks the blood of a plague-stricken rat; but it is difficult\nto suppose that contamination of the proboscis can explain cases of\ncontinued infectivity during which the flea has been feeding regularly\nupon healthy animals.\n\nNext, there is a hypothesis that the salivary glands of the flea become\ninfected and that the bacilli are inoculated along with the saliva.\nThe reader will remember that when a flea sucks, a stream of saliva is\npumped down the mandibles into the puncture. But this hypothesis is\nshattered by the fact that plague bacilli are apparently confined to\nthe alimentary canal of the flea, and that they have never been found\nin the salivary glands.\n\nAn apparently more probable explanation, that the contents of the\nstomach (in which as we know the bacilli may multiply) are regurgitated\nand transferred to the wound by the mouth-parts, is rendered less\ncredible when we remember that there is a valvular arrangement at\nthe opening of the flea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stomach which seems to make such a thing\nimpossible.\n\nLastly, there remains the only theory on which we have positive\nevidence. It is the theory that the bacilli contained in the f\u00c3\u00a6ces of\nthe flea are deposited on the skin and then find their way into the\nwound made by the piercing organ. They may be helped in this by the\nrubbing and scratching which follow on the bite of the flea. We know,\nof course, that plague bacilli are present in abundance in the f\u00c3\u00a6ces of\nfleas taken from plague-sick rats, and that such f\u00c3\u00a6ces are infective\nto guinea-pigs both by cutaneous and by subcutaneous inoculation.\nExperiments were made to discover whether the pricks made by fleas were\nof sufficient size to allow plague bacilli to enter the body, no other\ndamage to the skin being done. Healthy fleas, confined in a test-tube,\nwere allowed to feed on a small part of a guinea-pig\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abdomen,\nthe hair of which had been cropped close without injuring the skin\nImmediately afterwards a few drops of the septic\u00c3\u00a6mic blood of a rat\nwhich had died of plague, or of a virulent culture of plague bacillus,\nwere lightly spread over the part. Many successful infections were\nobtained in this way.\n\nSimilar experiments were made in which the plague culture was first\nspread on the skin, and, afterwards, healthy fleas were allowed to feed\non the same spot. Successful infections were also obtained by this\nmeans.\n\nTwo facts then seem to be demonstrated beyond doubt: first, that the\npuncture made by a flea will allow the bacillus to gain access to an\nanimal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body and to infect it; secondly, that there is a possibility\nof infection by the f\u00c3\u00a6ces of fleas.\n\nAs to whether this is the usual process the highest authorities are not\nready to express any opinion. The safest course appears to be to kill\nfleas but to avoid rubbing them in.\n\nGood work was done during the recent outbreak of plague in San\nFrancisco when the energies of an army of men were directed to\ncontrolling and destroying the rat population. Enormous numbers of\nrats were killed, their breeding places were destroyed and everything\nwas made as uncomfortable for them as possible. Men of science were\nat the same time engaged in collecting and examining the fleas from\nmany thousands of rats. The great success of the work confirmed the\nsoundness of the theory on which it was based. The spread of the\nmost terrible of epidemic diseases was controlled and prevented by\nknowledge. At San Francisco the fleas of man, rats, mice, dogs, cats,\nground-squirrels and gophers were studied. It was found there, as\nelsewhere, that while each species of flea has its particular host few\nare unwilling or unable to attack man and other animals when the host\ndies.\n\nThere is good reason to believe that during the last outbreak of\nplague in Manchuria the fleas carried the bacillus from the marmots\n(_Arctomys_) to man.\n\nPlague can be transmitted by the human flea; but it may be doubted\nwhether this often occurs under natural conditions. The rat-fleas seem\ninclined to take more readily to mankind than the human fleas do to\nrats. Experiments at Bombay seemed to show that, though the human flea\nwas able to transmit the plague infection, it does not transmit it as\nreadily as the oriental rat-flea. An explanation of this was obtained\nwhen it was discovered that _Pulex irritans_ does not live well either\non rats, or on guinea-pigs, which were the subjects of the experiments.\nA count of the fleas was made, each day, in a number of experimental\ncages, in which live human fleas were placed in company with wild\nBombay rats. A great number of human fleas were put into a flea-proof\ncage along with a rat. Each day a census was taken of the fleas still\nalive. After twenty-fours hours it was found that little more than one\nper cent. of the fleas put in could be recovered, and no fleas were\never found alive after the fifth day.\n\nThe European rat-flea (_Ceratophyllus fasciatus_) seems to be quite as\nreadily able to transmit plague as the oriental insect. How far other\nfleas are able to transfer infection we have little or no knowledge.\nBut twenty-seven experiments to transmit plague from animal to animal\nby means of cat-fleas (_Ctenocephalus felis_) were once made and none\nof these were successful. The reason for the failure we do not know.\n\nIf infected fleas are kept in captivity after they have fed on\nseptic\u00c3\u00a6mic blood, it is found that, after a while, they are no longer\nable to convey infection. On being dissected no bacilli are found in\nthem. A clearing process, therefore, evidently goes on. If a number\nof fleas be fed on a septic\u00c3\u00a6mic rat and, subsequently, be kept under\nobservation and nourished on healthy animals, the proportion found to\nbe infected steadily diminishes day by day. It is remarkable that the\nexistence of numerous plague bacilli in the stomach of a flea does not\nseem materially to affect the insect\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life. Fleas, in other words, do\nnot suffer from plague though they can transmit it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nRAT-FLEAS AND BAT-FLEAS\n\n\nTHE chief conclusions arrived at, as the result of the investigations,\nduring the years 1905 to 1909, into the mode of spread of plague in\nIndia, may be briefly stated in the following fashion: The Advisory\nCommittee, under whose direction the investigation was carried out,\nconsider that: firstly, in nature, plague is spread among rats by\nthe agency of rat-fleas; secondly, bubonic plague is not directly\ninfectious from man to man; thirdly, in the great majority of\ncases, during an epidemic of plague, man contracts the disease from\nplague-infected rats through the agency of plague-infected rat-fleas;\nfourthly, where there are annual epidemics they occur during some part\nof that season when the prevalence of fleas is greatest.\n\nThat being so, it is manifest that an accurate knowledge of rat-fleas,\ntheir forms, their habits, and their life-history may prove of great\nimportance.\n\nThree species of the genus _Mus_ follow quickly in the wake of\ncivilized man and establish themselves all over the globe. They may all\nbe looked upon as more or less domestic animals. The house-mouse (_M.\nmusculus_) is familiar everywhere. The old black rat (_M. rattus_)\nchiefly infests ships and seaports. The brown rat (_M. norwegicus_)\nis the most aggressive and distinctive. But all three, by accidental\ntransference from port to port in ocean-going vessels, have become\ndistributed over the world. Their fleas, to a limited extent, have\nbecome distributed with them. In connection with the spread of plague\nthese three small rodents are of prime importance; and not less\nimportant are the fleas which are parasitic on them.\n\nIn California, the ground-squirrel (_Otospermophilus beecheyi_) has\nbeen proved to play an important part in plague infection; and a full\naccount of its fleas, and of experiments in transferring rat-fleas to\nsquirrels and squirrel-fleas to rats, has been published by American\nnaturalists.\n\nIn 1903 Dr Blue, who was in charge of measures for suppressing plague\nat San Francisco, observed that an epidemic disease was killing the\nground-squirrels in the country round San Francisco Bay. It was shown,\nsomewhat later, that the mortality among the squirrels was caused by\nplague, and there can be little doubt that it was transferred from\nrats to squirrels. In harvest time rats migrate to the fields and use\nthe same runs and holes as the squirrels. Under these conditions a\ntransfer of fleas from rats to ground-squirrels is almost certain to\nensue. Two species of flea have been recorded from the Californian\nground-squirrel, and both are parasites of rats. The chain of evidence\nis really complete, for those who have made a business of hunting\nground-squirrels testify to the readiness with which fleas will leave\na dead squirrel and bite a human being. In the records of plague in\nCalifornia there are several cases in which there seems to be very\nlittle doubt that the disease resulted from handling plague-infected\nsquirrels.\n\nFleas being wingless insects travel with considerable difficulty over\nthe ground; and though their hopping powers are notorious they are\nunable to make any long-continued progress in this way. The methods\nby which they get dispersed are of interest. Some may be carried by\nthe host in its natural wanderings. Rats appear to be constantly\npicking up and dropping fleas. Sick rats harbour more fleas than\nothers and therefore more frequently drop them. A hundred fleas have\nbeen collected off one plague-sick rat; and, as we know, if this rat\nwas moribund, some of these fleas would most likely be infected. It\nis obvious that a plague-sick rat may travel about leaving as it\nwanders a trail of infected fleas behind it. Rats, too, are frequently\ntransported with certain kinds of merchandise and carry their fleas\nto the most distant parts of the globe, travelling with all the speed\nand luxury which modern steamships afford. Rats will dive into sacks\nof grain or bran and hide, so that the bag can be loaded as cargo\nwithout anyone suspecting the presence of a rat inside. _M. rattus_ and\nits fleas, from the habits of the host, are especially likely to be\ntransported in this way. Besides, many fleas are now dispersed without\ntheir hosts in merchandise of various kinds. They may travel great\ndistances in these days of rapid transport, though adult fleas, without\na host to feed on, generally die in about five days. But larv\u00c3\u00a6, which\neat organic rubbish, and pup\u00c3\u00a6, which do not eat at all, might arrive\nalive at the end of a journey of well over a month. On arrival, they\nwould seek their true host, or the next best available animal. Not\nhaving yet fed, and being newly emerged, they might survive as long as\na fortnight without a suitable host.\n\nFleas dislike damp breeding places, but dirty carpets, chopped straw,\nold sacking, paper shavings, and such-like rubbish suit them admirably.\n\n_M. rattus_ is fond of making nests on grain bags and in such sacking\nthe larv\u00c3\u00a6 of fleas are often found. Where trade is carried on in sacks\nand gunny bags this means of distributing fleas and plague should be\nkept in mind.\n\nSome rat-fleas, as we know, will feed on man as well as on rats; but\ntheir behaviour is rather different when they feed on rats and on man.\nIt has been repeatedly noticed that the fleas were much more readily\nattracted by the rat than by man. Although the fleas jump on to a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhand they take some time to begin to feed. They crawl about and seem\nto have some doubt where best to begin their sucking operations. Also\nit has been observed that the fleas much more readily fall off a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\narm, when he moves, than they do when a rat moves. It seems that they\nare able to get a firmer hold on the rat than on a man; and it is of\ninterest to note in this connection the larger claws of the human flea\ncompared with the claws of the rat-flea.\n\nIt has been shown, in various parts of India, that the number of\nrat-fleas found on rats varies with the seasons. This seasonal\nvariation of rat-fleas corresponds in a general way with the plague\nmortality. During the season when plague is bad the average number of\nfleas per rat is above the mean. During the non-epidemic season it is\nbelow the mean. The height of the epidemic corresponds fairly closely\nwith the season of maximum flea prevalence.\n\nNineteen species of _Pulicid\u00c3\u00a6_ are more or less habitually obtained\nby collectors on rats and mice. But the great majority of these may\nbe called casual visitors. Six species of _Sarcopsyllid\u00c3\u00a6_ are also\noccasionally found on rats. These are the burrowing chigoes and their\nallies which usually attack the head and ears of rats.\n\nThe species of flea commonly found on rats are five in number, and the\nreadiness with which they bite human beings has been carefully studied.\n\n1. _Xenopsylla cheopis._ This is the oriental rat-flea first described\nby Mr Charles Rothschild from specimens collected in Egypt. The true\nhome of this flea appears to be the Nile valley, where it may be\nfound in plenty on various hosts. Many of these are desert animals\nand the flea shows a preference for rodents. Having been distributed\nall over the world by rats, it now occurs, occasionally, in all warm\nclimates. It is the common rat-flea of the tropical and sub-tropical\nworld. In India it often happens that the whole of the fleas collected\nfrom rats prove to be of this species. But it cannot, apparently,\nflourish in cold countries. In the warmer temperate zones, such as the\nMediterranean and Australian seaports, it occurs in varying proportions\naccording to the time of year. The numbers decline with cold weather.\nIt readily bites man and is more active than any other flea in the\ntransmission of plague. For this reason it is sometimes spoken of as\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Plague-flea.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It is a smaller and a lighter coloured insect than\nthe human flea.\n\n2. _Ceratophyllus fasciatus._ This is the common European rat-flea.\nIt is the rat-flea of the temperate as opposed to the hot countries\nof the world. It is commonly found on black and brown rats in the\nBritish Islands and the other countries of Northern and Central Europe.\nIt readily bites man, and there is no reason to suppose that, other\nconditions being equal, it would not be as efficient an agent in\nspreading plague as the last species has been shown to be in India.\n\n3. _Ceratophyllus anisus._ This is a closely allied species of rat-flea\nwhich replaces the last in China and Japan.\n\n4. _Leptopsylla musculi._ This is the mouse-flea and it is as widely\ndistributed over the globe as its host. From mice it frequently moves\nto rats, and it has been found on them in various parts of Europe,\nAmerica, Australia, and Japan. It occasionally bites man, but evinces\nlittle inclination to do so.\n\n5. _Ctenophthalmus agyrtes._ This flea is commonly found as a parasite\nof voles and field-mice. When farm-rats take to an open life in\nthe fields they pick up this species from the rustic rodents. In\nHertfordshire, Hampshire and Suffolk one half the fleas from rats,\ncollected in farmyards and hedgerows, were found to belong to this\nspecies; but whether it is as common on rats all over England is\nunknown. It appears not to bite man. A closely allied flea (_Ct.\nassimilis_) is found in central Europe on field-mice and equally on\nrats which live under the same conditions. It has not been found in\nEngland.\n\nThe principal occasional parasites of rats are dog-fleas, cat-fleas,\nfowl-fleas, and human fleas. The proportions in which they and\nrat-fleas are found vary greatly in different parts of the world. For\ninstance, in San Francisco nine per cent. of the fleas collected from\nrats have sometimes been found to be human fleas; whilst in Italy as\nmany as twenty-five per cent. have been identified as cat-and dog-fleas.\n\nIt must be borne in mind that when new countries are opened up by man\nthe rats, which follow in his rear, exterminate numbers of the weakly\nnative small mammals and take on their fleas. A change of habitat may\nbe followed by an exchange of fleas.\n\nSome interesting work has been done in testing the appetite of\ndifferent kinds of flea for human blood. The oriental rat-flea (_X.\ncheopis_) has been kept alive for three weeks on that diet. Other\nspecies show repulsion for mankind and refuse to suck. The experiments\nconfirm the popular belief that fleas have a marked preference for\ncertain individuals. When the flea has refused to bite the human arm,\nit becomes necessary to check the experiment by trying whether the\nrefusal is merely due to want of hunger. For this purpose a rat must\nbe at hand. It can be secured on a board by two bandages fixed at each\nend by drawing pins. The rat lies, of course, on its back with its head\ncomfortably supported by a little pillow of cotton wool. A portion\nof the rat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abdominal wall is left exposed and shaved. The flea, in\nan inverted test-tube, can then be put on the hairless patch of the\nabdomen and given an opportunity of biting, which it may or may not\naccept.\n\nWhen fleas are being collected from rats it has been noticed that the\ntrue rat-fleas are usually on the hind-quarters of the host, whilst the\nmouse-flea prefers the region of the head and neck.\n\nAs regards the tastes and habits of oriental rat-fleas in the matter of\nfood a long series of experiments may be summarized in this way:\n\n(1) When many rat-fleas are present some will attack man, even when\na rat is available for their food-supply. (2) When the number of\nrat-fleas is small, and when their true host is present, they will not\nattack man. (3) When rat-fleas are starved they will readily attack all\nanimals, not being particular in the choice of a host. (4) Rat-fleas\ndeprived of their food for from 72 to 96 hours attack and feed on man\nmore readily than at other times. (5) Rat-fleas, even when starved,\nprefer their true host to man. (6) Rat-fleas may be attracted to\nman, jump on him, but take some time to feed on him. Plague-infected\nfleas might in this way be carried from one place to another without\ninfecting the man; but they would, when brought near a rat, attack it\nin preference to man.\n\nThe fleas found on bats possess certain peculiarities which have led\nto their being grouped together. They form a family to which the name\n_Ceratopsyllid\u00c3\u00a6_ has been given. They are recognized by two flaps, one\non each side of the head. What these are and what service, if any, they\nrender to their possessors is unknown. Bat-fleas also, as a rule, have\nmaxill\u00c3\u00a6 shaped like dumb-bells; but in one genus (_Thaumopsylla_),\nfound on fruit-bats, they are triangular as in other fleas. The maxill\u00c3\u00a6\nas the reader may remember, are parts of the insect\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth, and,\nthough placed like jaws on each side of the aperture, they are not used\nin piercing the skin and sucking blood (Fig. 4). They bear feelers\ncalled the maxillary palpi. The flea (_Thaumopsylla breviceps_) which\nis found on South African fruit-bats and which has triangular maxill\u00c3\u00a6,\nseems to be a connecting link between this peculiar group of fleas and\nthe main family _Pulicid\u00c3\u00a6_.\n\nBat-fleas are commonly well supplied with combs. They usually have\nthem on the abdomen, as well as the head, and the maximum number of\neight combs is found in bat-fleas. Their structure and life-history\nagree generally with that of other fleas. They breed in hollow trees,\ncaves, ruins, church-towers and lofts where bats hibernate or spend\nthe hours of daylight. The larv\u00c3\u00a6 feed on the droppings of the bats,\nand the mature insect, after emerging from the pupa case, takes the\nfirst opportunity that comes of getting on to its host. Bats are seldom\nfound to be much infested with fleas; for this reason, bat-fleas are\nsomewhat difficult to obtain and many of the species that are known are\nextremely rare.\n\nThe hosts of bat-fleas, obviously, vary more as to the surroundings\nwhich they inhabit than almost any other animals. They are found from\nthe equator north and south to the Arctic circle and the straits of\nMagellan, in the densest tropical forests and flitting round the barest\nnorthern buildings. Some pillage the rich fruit gardens of India,\nwhilst other smaller bats work hard for a precarious diet of gnats\nround a Siberian village. Two sharply divided groups of bats exist:\n(1) The fruit-bats (Macrochiroptera) with flat molar teeth adapted\nfor a vegetable diet. These are found in the warmer parts of the Old\nWorld but not in America. (2) The insectivorous bats (Microchiroptera)\nwhose molar teeth are equipped with sharp cusps for biting their animal\nfood. These have an almost world-wide distribution, and one species at\nleast ranges within the Arctic circle. The same fleas are not as a rule\nfound on the large fruit-bats as on the small ordinary bats. But some\nbat-fleas have an extensive range. The same species has been taken from\ndifferent bats of various kinds in Sierra Leone, in Madagascar and in\nJava.\n\nAll bat-fleas are blind. This absence of eyes, in fleas which are\nparasites of strictly nocturnal animals, lends colour to the suggestion\nthat fleas which are blind have lost their eyes because they had no\nneed of them. Disuse is speedily followed by degeneration.\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX A\n\nSYSTEMATIC VIEW OF THE ORDER _SIPHONAPTERA_\n\nOrder SIPHONAPTERA. Latreille (1825).\n\n\nInsects with body laterally compressed. Head rounded and fixed by\nthe whole posterior part to the thorax. Mouth-parts for piercing and\nsucking, consisting of paired mandibles with serrate margins and\nunpaired labrum. These are sheathed by the labium and labial palpi.\nMaxill\u00c3\u00a6 usually triangular with four-jointed palpi. Eyes simple, placed\nin front of the antenn\u00c3\u00a6, occasionally rudimentary or absent. Antenn\u00c3\u00a6 of\nthree main segments which lie when at rest in a groove. Three thoracic\nsegments, always free, each consisting of a notum and a sternum. The\nsterna of the second and third segments are further divided into a\nsternum, an episternum and an epimeron, the two latter constituting\nthe pleura. Wings and rudiments of wings entirely absent. Abdomen of\nten segments of which the sternite of the first segment is suppressed.\nAbdomen enormously swollen in pregnant females of certain species.\nCombs frequently present on head, thorax, and abdomen. Legs developed\nfor leaping. Coxa powerful; femur thickened; tarsi of five segments,\nending in two claws on the distal segment. Metamorphosis complete.\nLarva of thirteen segments. Pupa enveloped in silken cocoon. Imago a\ntemporary parasite (usually) on warm-blooded vertebrates.\n\n\nI. Family _Sarcopsyllid\u00c3\u00a6_. Taschenberg (1880).\n\nRostrum (= labium + labial palpi) rather long but very weak and pale,\nconsisting of two or three segments inclusive of the unpaired basal\nsegment. Genal edge of head always produced downwards into a triangular\nprocess situated behind the insertion of the maxill\u00c3\u00a6 at the ventral\noral angle. Thoracical tergites together shorter than first abdominal\ntergite.\n\nTo this group belong the chigoes and their allies, the most truly\nparasitic fleas. About fourteen species have been described, which\ncan be grouped into three genera, viz. _Dermatophilus, Hectopsylla,\nEchidnophaga_.\n\n\nII. Family _Pulicid\u00c3\u00a6_. Taschenberg (1880).\n\nRostrum (= labium + labial palpi) more or less strongly chitinized,\nconsisting, except in a few cases, of five, or more, segments\ninclusive of the unpaired basal one. Thoracical tergites together\nlonger than first abdominal tergite.\n\nHere belong the majority of _Siphonaptera_.\n\n\nIII. Family _Ceratopsyllid\u00c3\u00a6_. Baker (1905).\n\nHead on each side with two flaps situated at the front oral corner.\nHere belong the bat-fleas only. There are several genera, and about\ntwenty-five species have been described. In most of the bat-fleas the\nmaxill\u00c3\u00a6 are shaped like a dumb-bell, but in the genus _Thaumopsylla_\nthey are triangular as in the _Pulicid\u00c3\u00a6_.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOudemans (1909) has put forward an alternative classification of\nthe order _Siphonaptera_ based on the morphology of the head:\u00e2\u0080\u0094I.\n_Integricipita_, II. _Fracticipita_.\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX B\n\nA LIST OF BRITISH FLEAS AND THEIR HOSTS\n\nA list of the British Fleas (_Siphonaptera_) revised to March 1913:\n\n  Names                               Usual Hosts\n\n  PULEX, _L._\n      P. irritans                     Man, Badger\n\n  XENOPSYLLA, _Glink_.\n      X. cheopis, _Rothsch._          Rat\n\n  ARCH\u00c3\u0086OPSYLLA, _Dampf_\n      A. erinacei, _Bouch\u00c3\u00a9_           Hedgehog\n\n  CTENOCEPHALUS, _Kolen_\n      C. canis, _Curt._               Dog\n      C. felis, _Bouch\u00c3\u00a9_              Cat\n\n  SPILOPSYLLUS, _Baker_\n      S. cuniculi, _Dale_             Rabbit\n\n  ORNITHOPSYLLA, _Rothsch._\n      O. l\u00c3\u00a6titi\u00c3\u00a6, _Rothsch._          Puffin and Manx shearwater\n                                      (Scilly Is. only)\n\n  CERATOPHYLLUS, _Kolen_\n      C. fasciatus, _Bosc._           Rat\n      C. londiniensis, _Rothsch._     House-mouse, Rat\n      C. sciurorum, _Schrk._          Squirrel, Dormouse\n      C. melis, _Wlk._                Badger\n      C. mustel\u00c3\u00a6, _Wagner_            Bank-vole and Field-mice\n      C. penicilliger, _Grube_        Bank-vole and Field-mice\n      C. walkeri, _Rothsch._          Stoats, Voles, and Field-mice\n      C. gallin\u00c3\u00a6, _Schrk._            Chickens and many birds\n      C. fringill\u00c3\u00a6, _Wlk._            Sparrow\n      C. garei, _Rothsch._            Many birds\n      C. rusticus, _Wagner_           House-martin\n      C. farreni, _Rothsch._          House-martin\n      C. hirundinis, _Curt._          House-martin\n      C. columb\u00c3\u00a6, _Gerv._             Pigeon\n      C. styx, _Rothsch._             Sand-martin\n      C. gallinul\u00c3\u00a6, _Dale_            Many birds: especially freshwater\n                                        breeders\n      C. vagabundus, _Bokeman_        Nests of Sea-fowl\n      C. borealis, _Rothsch._         Gannet and Rock-pipit\n      C. rothschildi, _Waterst._      House-martin\n\n  CTENOPHTHALMUS, _Kolen_\n      C. agyrtes, _Heller_            Field-mice and Voles\n      C. agyrtes nobilis, _Rothsch._  Water-rat\n      C. bisoctodentatus, _Kolen_     Mole\n\n  DORATOPSYLLA, _Jord. and Rothsch._\n      D. dasycnemus, _Rothsch._       Shrew\n\n  RHADINOPSYLLA, _Jord. and Rothsch._\n      R. pentacanthus, _Rothsch._     Weasel\n      R. isacanthus, _Rothsch._       Bank-vole\n\n  PAL\u00c3\u0086OPSYLLA, _Wagner_\n      P. sorecis, _Dale_              Shrew\n      P. minor, _Dale_                Mole\n      P. kohauti, _Dampf_             Mole\n\n  LEPTOPSYLLA, _Rothsch._\n      L. musculi, _Duges_             Mouse\n      L. spectabilis, _Rothsch._      Bank-vole\n\n  TYPHLOCERAS, _Wagner_\n      T. poppei, _Wagner_             Long-tailed Field-mouse\n\n  HYSTRICHOPSYLLA, _Taschb._\n      H. talp\u00c3\u00a6, _Curt._               Mole\n\n  ISCHNOPSYLLA, _Westw._\n      I. elongatus, _Curt._           Noctule Bat\n      I. intermedius, _Rothsch._      Serotine Bat\n      I. simplex, _Rothsch._          Natterer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bat\n      I. octactenus, _Kolen_          Pipistrelle Bat\n      I. hexactenus, _Kolen_          Long-eared Bat\n\n  NYCTERIDOPSYLLA, _Oudemans_\n      N. longiceps, _Rothsch._        Pipistrelle Bat\n      N. eusarca major, _Rothsch._    Noctule Bat\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX C\n\nON COLLECTING AND PRESERVING FLEAS\n\n\nThere are two methods by which fleas may be preserved for study when\nthey have been collected. The first is by keeping the specimens in\nsmall tubes of alcohol; the second is by mounting each in Canada balsam\non a slide for the microscope. The advantage of the former method\nis that the material can be used for dissection. The student can do\nnothing without a microscope, though some of the commoner species can\nbe identified with tolerable certainty by a practised eye which is\nassisted by a pocket-lens.\n\nThe tubes are best stored away in a cabinet fitted with wooden shelves\nand holes to take the tubes like a test-tube holder. Fleas dried and\npreserved loose in a box, or gummed on card, are useless for purposes\nof minute examination, and are soon destroyed.\n\nFleas may be collected from the great majority of mammals and birds\nin almost all parts of the globe. They can be found in the hair and\nunder the feathers, and also in the places where the animals habitually\nsleep. The best places, from which a plentiful haul may often be\nobtained, are the holes and nests in which the young have been reared.\n\nIt is essential to remember, when an animal has been killed, that all\nthe fleas leave as soon as the body of the host gets cold. No time,\ntherefore, should be lost in searching for specimens.\n\nIf the animal is small enough it may be put into a cardboard box, or a\nwhite linen bag, and a few drops of chloroform or benzine can be poured\non it. In a short time the fleas will be found dead in the bag or at\nthe bottom of the box. Some may also be found in the hairs and feathers\nwhen they are turned back.\n\nIn the case of a large mammal the hair must be turned backwards\nshortly after death, when the live fleas may be seen running about and\ncaught. For this purpose a small camel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hair brush is very useful.\nIf a flea is touched with a brush of this kind which has been dipped\nin chloroform, benzine, or alcohol, the insect sticks to the brush,\nbut can be easily floated off into the tube of preservative. The best\npreserving liquid is 50 per cent. alcohol. Methylated spirits can be\nused. Acetic acid can also be used; but it is objectionable because in\na short time it destroys the corks of the tubes.\n\nEach tube should only contain the fleas collected from one host, but\nas many specimens as possible should be secured, because there may be\nseveral species of flea on the same host.\n\nThe tube must be securely corked and labelled, with the date, the\nlocality, and the name of the host. In foreign countries it may not\nbe always easy to do this. In such cases the skin of the host must\nbe preserved with the tube for subsequent identification. A number\ncorresponding to the label on the tube should be attached to the skin\nof the host.\n\nFleas collected without records of the host from which they were\nobtained are of little or no scientific value. For this reason a tube\nshould contain the parasites of one host only.\n\nA convenient way of preserving records temporarily is to write in\n_pencil_ on a small piece of paper which can be rolled up and put in\nthe alcohol in the tube.\n\nSmall mammals generally, including bats, are good hosts; Rodents and\nInsectivora afford usually the most fruitful captures. In trapping\nmice and voles only those traps should be used in which the animals\nare caught alive, or the fleas will have left their hosts before they\ncan be secured and examined. Field-mice caught in the ordinary small\npenny mouse-trap are often found dead in the morning. The best traps\nare made on the principle of the ordinary mouse-trap, but larger. A\npiece of bacon-rind on the hook is a good bait for almost all small\nmammals. Where a number of traps are put down and left out they should,\nof course, be visited daily.\n\nWhen a live mouse, or other small mammal of similar size, has been\ncaptured it may be transferred from the trap into a small white linen\nor holland bag. The animal can then be killed by tapping its head or\nbreaking its neck from the outside of the bag. After this has been\ndone, fleas may be searched for in the fashion described above.\n\nMost of the small mammals which act as hosts for fleas are nocturnal.\nThe localities where they may be trapped are numberless, but only\na small proportion of the captures may yield anything for the\nflea-collector. I have heard of a collector of small mammals who\ntravelled through remote parts of Spain and never lost an occasion\nfor putting down his traps when he had to change trains at a country\nrailway junction. In England it would, however, seldom be worth doing\nthis, as, on many lines, there is an attempt to make the arrival of one\ntrain and the departure of another correspond.\n\nThe following plan for securing bird-fleas will be found successful.\nThe nests of birds should be taken as soon as the young are fledged and\nflown. If the nest is small it can be put into a glass-topped box lined\nwith white paper. If too large, the whole nest, or the most firmly\nmatted and dirty part, may be put into a glass globe (such as gold-fish\nare kept in) and a piece of paper tied over the mouth. From time to\ntime the nest should be slightly damped with water. In every case a\nlabel should be put into the receptacle to preserve the name of the\nbird which built the nest. The bottom of the nest may sometimes be seen\nto be full of the larval fleas; but in any case fleas will probably\nemerge from pup\u00c3\u00a6. The fleas will continue appearing for as much as six\nweeks or eight weeks after the young birds have left the nest. They\nmust be watched for and taken off the sides and top of the box with a\ncamel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hair brush dipped in chloroform or benzine. I have seen dozens\nof fleas come from the nest of a tit (_Parus major_) in the course of a\nfew weeks. They were all of the common species (_C. gallin\u00c3\u00a6_). When the\nlid of the box is removed it is difficult to prevent a few escaping in\nthe room, but I have never known them cause inconvenience to anyone.\n\nCollectors in warm countries should give their attention to the\nchigoes and their allies, which are of great interest and have been\nlittle studied. They are found on mammals and birds in tropical and\nsemi-tropical countries. The males are very difficult to find, but the\nfemales are large and very parasitic. They have the appearance of a\nsmall wart firmly fixed to the skin. Small mammals may be transferred,\nwith their chigoes attached, to a bottle of alcohol. Many examples of\nthese insects are often found together on the more naked portions of\ntheir hosts.\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX D\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\n\nA.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n","id":1414,"split":"test"}
