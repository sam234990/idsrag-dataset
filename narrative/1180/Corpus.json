E. Manning). When he comes of age Lothair finds himself the centre of attention of three fascinating women, Lady Corisande, Clare Arundel, and Theodora Campion, representing the Church of England, the Roman Catholic Church, and the Radical cause respectively. Wavering in his allegiances, he unsuccessfully proposes marriage to Lady Corisande, almost joins the Catholic Church, and finally joins Theodora in Italy as a volunteer in the army of Garibaldi, which is fighting to take the Papal States for Italy. Theodora is killed at Viterbo, and Lothair is seriously wounded at the Battle of Mentana, but is nursed back to health by Clare Arundel, who tries to persuade him that he was saved by an apparition of the Virgin Mary. He takes refuge with the bohemian dandy Mr. Phoebus (a thinly disguised Frederic Leighton), who takes him to Syria, which, as the cradle of Christianity, seems the ideal place to reflect on the roots of the Faith. In Jerusalem he meets Paraclete, a mystic who teaches him that there is truth in many religions. Lothair decides in favour of the Church of England, resisting the attempts of Cardinal Grandison and other prelates, including Mgr Catesby (a thinly disguised Thomas Capel) to convert him to Catholicism, and returns to England where he marries Lady Corisande.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Lothair, by Benjamin Disraeli\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

His mother brought him to us one day. She was a dear\nfriend of mine; you know she was one of my bridesmaids?\"\n\n\"And you have never seen him since, mamma?\" inquired a married daughter,\nwho looked like the younger sister of her mother.\n\n\"Never; he was an orphan shortly after; I have often reproached myself,\nbut it is so difficult to see boys. Then, he never went to school, but\nwas brought up in the Highlands with a rather savage uncle; and if he\nand Bertram had not become friends at Christchurch, I do not well see\nhow we ever could have known him.\"\n\nThese remarks were made in the morning-room of Brentham, where the\nmistress of the mansion sat surrounded by her daughters, all occupied\nwith various works. One knitted a purse, another adorned a slipper a\nthird emblazoned a page. Beautiful forms in counsel leaned over frames\nembroidery, while two fair sisters more remote occasionally burst into\nmelody as they tried the passages of a new air, which had been dedicated\nto them in the manuscript of some devoted friend.\n\nThe duchess, one of the greatest heiresses of Britain, singularly\nbeautify and gifted with native grace, had married in her teens one of\nthe wealthiest and most powerful of our nobles, and scarcely order than\nherself. Her husband was as distinguished for his appearance and his\nmanners as his bride, and those who speculate on race were interested\nin watching the development of their progeny, who in form and color, and\nvoice, and manner, and mind, were a reproduction of their parents,\nwho seemed only the elder brother and sister of a gifted circle. The\ndaughters with one exception came first, and all met the same fate.\nAfter seventeen years of a delicious home they were presented, and\nimmediately married; and all to personages of high consideration. After\nthe first conquest, this fate seemed as regular as the order of Nature.\nThen came a son, who was now at Christchurch, and then several others,\nsome at school, and some scarcely out of the nursery. There was one\ndaughter unmarried, and she was to be presented next season. Though\nthe family likeness was still apparent in Lady Corisande, in general\nexpression she differed from her sisters. They were all alike with their\ndelicate aquiline noses, bright complexions, short upper lips, and eyes\nof sunny light. The beauty of Lady Corisande was even more distinguished\nand more regular, but whether it were the effect of her dark-brown hair\nand darker eyes, her countenance had not the lustre of the res, and its\nexpression was grave and perhaps pensive.\n\nThe duke, though still young, and naturally of a gay and joyous\ntemperament, had a high sense of duty, and strong domestic feelings. He\nwas never wanting in his public place, and he was fond of his wife and\nhis children; still more, proud of them. Every day when he looked into\nthe glass, and gave the last touch to his consummate toilet, he offered\nhis grateful thanks to Providence that his family was not unworthy of\nhim.\n\nHis grace was accustomed to say that he had only one misfortune, and\nit was a great one; he had no home. His family had married so many\nheiresses, and he, consequently, possessed so many halls and castles, at\nall of which, periodically, he wished, from a right feeling, to reside,\nthat there was no sacred spot identified with his life in which his\nheart, in the bustle and tumult of existence, could take refuge.\nBrentham was the original seat of his family, and he was even\npassionately fond of it; but it was remarkable how very short a period\nof his yearly life was passed under its stately roof. So it was his\ncustom always to repair to Brentham the moment the season was over, and\nhe would exact from his children, that, however short might be the time,\nthey would be his companions under those circumstances. The daughters\nloved Brentham, and they loved to please their father; but the\nsons-in-law, though they were what is called devoted to their wives,\nand, unusual as it may seem, scarcely less attached to their legal\nparents, did not fall very easily into this arrangement. The country\nin August without sport was unquestionably to them a severe trial:\nnevertheless, they rarely omitted making their appearance, and, if they\ndid occasionally vanish, sometimes to Cowes, sometimes to Switzerland,\nsometimes to Norway, they always wrote to their wives, and always\nalluded to their immediate or approaching return; and their letters\ngracefully contributed to the fund of domestic amusement.\n\nAnd yet it would be difficult to find a fairer scene than Brentham\noffered, especially in the lustrous effulgence of a glorious English\nsummer. It was an Italian palace of freestone; vast, ornate, and in\nscrupulous condition; its spacious and graceful chambers filled with\ntreasures of art, and rising itself from statued and stately terraces.\nAt their foot spread a gardened domain of considerable extent, bright\nwith flowers, dim with coverts of rare shrubs, and musical with\nfountains. Its limit reached a park, with timber such as the midland\ncounties only can produce. The fallow deer trooped among its ferny\nsolitudes and gigantic oaks; but, beyond the waters of the broad and\nwinding lake, the scene became more savage, and the eye caught the dark\nforms of the red deer on some jutting mount, shrinking with scorn from\ncommunion with his gentler brethren.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\n\nLothair was the little boy whom the duchess remembered. He was a\nposthumous child, and soon lost a devoted mother. His only relation was\none of his two guardians, a Scotch noble--a Presbyterian and a Whig.\nThis uncle was a widower with some children, but they were girls, and,\nthough Lothair was attached to them, too young to be his companions.\nTheir father was a keen, hard man, honorable and just but with no\nsoftness of heart or manner. He guarded with precise knowledge and with\nunceasing vigilance over Lothair's vast inheritance, which was in many\ncounties and in more than one kingdom; but he educated him in a Highland\nhome, and when he had reached boyhood thought fit to send him to the\nHigh School of Edinburgh. Lothair passed a monotonous, if not a dull,\nlife; but he found occasional solace in the scenes of a wild and\nbeautiful nature, and delight in all the sports of the field and forest,\nin which he was early initiated and completely indulged. Although an\nEnglishman, he was fifteen before he re-visited his country, and then\nhis glimpses of England were brief, and to him scarcely satisfactory. He\nwas hurried sometimes to vast domains, which he heard were his own; and\nsometimes whisked to the huge metropolis, where he was shown St. Paul's\nand the British-Museum. These visits left a vague impression of bustle\nwithout kindness and exhaustion without excitement; and he was glad to\nget back to his glens, to the moor and the mountain-streams.\n\nHis father, in the selection of his guardians, had not contemplated\nthis system of education. While he secured by the appointment of his\nbrother-in-law, the most competent and trustworthy steward of his son's\nfortune, he had depended on another for that influence which should\nmould the character, guide the opinions, and form the tastes of his\nchild. The other guardian was a clergyman, his father's private tutor\nand heart-friend; scarcely his parent's senior, but exercising over\nhim irresistible influence, for he was a man of shining talents and\nabounding knowledge, brilliant and profound. But unhappily, shortly\nafter Lothair became an orphan, this distinguished man seceded from the\nAnglican communion, and entered the Church of Rome. From this moment\nthere was war between the guardians. The uncle endeavored to drive his\ncolleague from the trust: in this he failed, for the priest would not\nrenounce his office. The Scotch noble succeeded, however, in making it\na fruitless one: he thwarted every suggestion that emanated from the\nobnoxious quarter; and, indeed, the secret reason of the almost constant\nresidence of Lothair in Scotland, and of his harsh education, was the\nfear of his relative, that the moment he crossed the border he might, by\nsome mysterious process, fall under the influence that his guardian so\nmuch dreaded and detested.\n\nThere was however, a limit to these severe precautions, even before\nLothair should reach his majority. His father had expressed in his will\nthat his son should be educated at the University of Oxford, and at the\nsame college of which he had been a member. His uncle was of opinion he\ncomplied with the spirit of this instruction by sending Lothair to the\nUniversity of Edinburgh, which would give the last tonic to his moral\nsystem; and then commenced a celebrated chancery-suit, instituted by the\nRoman Catholic guardian, in order to enforce a literal compliance\nwith the educational condition of the will. The uncle looked upon\nthis movement as a popish plot, and had recourse to every available\nallegation and argument to baffle it: but ultimately in vain. With every\nprecaution to secure his Protestant principles, and to guard against the\ninfluence, or even personal interference of his Roman Catholic guardian,\nthe lord-chancellor decided that Lothair should be sent to Christchurch.\n\nHere Lothair, who had never been favored with a companion of his own\nage and station, soon found a congenial one in the heir of Brentham.\nInseparable in pastime, not dissociated even in study, sympathizing\ncompanionship soon ripened into fervent friendship. They lived so\nmuch together that the idea of separation became not only painful but\nimpossible; and, when vacation arrived, and Brentham was to be visited\nby its future lord, what more natural than that it should be arranged\nthat Lothair should be a visitor to his domain?\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\n\nAlthough Lothair was the possessor of as many palaces and castles as the\nduke himself, it is curious that his first dinner at Brentham was\nalmost his introduction into refined society. He had been a guest at the\noccasional banquets of his uncle; but these were festivals of the\nPicts and Scots; rude plenty and coarse splendor, with noise instead of\nconversation, and a tumult of obstructive defendants, who impeded, by\ntheir want of skill, the very convenience which they were purposed to\nfacilitate. How different the surrounding scene! A table covered with\nflowers, bright with fanciful crystal, and porcelain that had belonged\nto sovereigns, who had given a name to its color or its form. As\nfor those present, all seemed grace and gentleness, from the radiant\ndaughters of the house to the noiseless attendants that anticipated all\nhis wants, and sometimes seemed to suggest his wishes.\n\nLothair sat between two of the married daughters. They addressed him\nwith so much sympathy that he was quite enchanted. When they asked their\npretty questions and made their sparkling remarks, roses seemed to drop\nfrom their lips, and sometimes diamonds. It was a rather large party,\nfor the Brentham family were so numerous that they themselves made\na festival. There were four married daughters, the duke and two\nsons-in-law, a clergyman or two, and some ladies and gentlemen who were\nseldom absent from this circle, and who, by their useful talents and\nvarious accomplishments, alleviated the toil or cares of life from which\neven princes are not exempt.\n\nWhen the ladies had retired to the duchess's drawing-room, all the\nmarried daughters clustered round their mother.\n\n\"Do you know, mamma, we all think him very, good-looking,\" said the\nyoungest married daughter, the wife of the listless and handsome St.\nAldegonde.\n\n\"And not at all shy,\" said Lady Montairy, \"though reserved.\"\n\n\"I admire deep-blue eyes with dark lashes,\" said the duchess.\n\nNotwithstanding the decision of Lady Montairy, Lothair was scarcely free\nfrom embarrassment when he rejoined the ladies; and was so afraid of\nstanding alone, or talking only to men, that he was almost on the point\nof finding refuge in his dinner-companions, had not he instinctively\nfelt that this would have been a social blunder. But the duchess\nrelieved him: her gracious glance caught his at the right moment, and\nshe rose and met him some way as he advanced. The friends had arrived\nso late, that Lothair had had only time to make a reverence of ceremony\nbefore dinner.\n\n\"It is not our first meeting,\" said her grace; \"but that you cannot\nremember.\"\n\n\"Indeed I do,\" said Lothair, \"and your grace gave me a golden heart.\"\n\n\"How can you remember such things,\" exclaimed the duchess, \"which I had\nmyself forgotten!\"\n\n\"I have rather a good memory,\" replied Lothair; \"and it is not wonderful\nthat I should remember this, for it is the only present that ever was\nmade me.\"\n\nThe evenings at Brentham were short, but they were sweet. It was a\nmusical family, without being fanatical on the subject. There was always\nmusic, but it was not permitted that the guests should be deprived of\nother amusements. But music was the basis of the evening's campaigns.\nThe duke himself sometimes took a second; the four married daughters\nwarbled sweetly; but the great performer was Lady Corisande. When her\nimpassioned tones sounded, there was a hushed silence in every chamber;\notherwise, many things were said and done amid accompanying melodies,\nthat animated without distracting even a whistplayer. The duke himself\nrather preferred a game of piquet or cart with Captain Mildmay,\nand sometimes retired with a troop to a distant, but still visible,\napartment, where they played with billiard-balls games which were not\nbilliards.\n\nThe ladies had retired, the duke had taken his glass of seltzer-water,\nand had disappeared. The gentry lingered and looked at each other, as if\nthey were an assembly of poachers gathering for an expedition, and then\nLord St. Aldegonde, tall, fair, and languid, said to Lothair, \"do you\nsmoke?\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"I should have thought Bertram would have seduced you by this time. Then\nlet us try. Montairy will give you one of his cigarettes, so mild that\nhis wife never finds him out.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\n\nThe breakfast-room at Brentham was very bright. It opened on a garden\nof its own, which, at this season, was so glowing, and cultured into\npatterns so fanciful and finished, that it had the resemblance of a vast\nmosaic. The walls of the chamber were covered with bright drawings and\nsketches of our modern masters, and frames of interesting miniatures,\nand the meal was served on half a dozen or more round tables, which vied\nwith each other in grace and merriment; brilliant as a cluster of Greek\nor Italian republics, instead of a great metropolitan table, like\na central government absorbing all the genius and resources of the\nsociety.\n\nEvery scene In this life at Brentham charmed Lothair, who, though not\nconscious of being of a particularly gloomy temper, often felt that\nhe had, somehow or other, hitherto passed through life rarely with\npleasure, and never with joy.\n\nAfter breakfast the ladies retired to their morning-room, and the\ngentlemen strolled to the stables, Lord St. Aldegonde lighting a Manilla\ncheroot of enormous length. As Lothair was very fond of horses, this\ndelighted him. The stables at Brentham were rather too far from the\nhouse, but they were magnificent, and the stud worthy of them. It was\nnumerous and choice, and, above all it was useful. It could supply,\na readier number of capital riding-horses than any stable in England.\nBrentham was a great riding family. In the summer season the duke\ndelighted to head a numerous troop, penetrate far into the country, and\nscamper home to a nine-o'clock dinner. All the ladies of the house were\nfond and fine horse-women. The mount of one of these riding-parties was\nmagical. The dames and damsels vaulted on their barbs, and genets,\nand thorough-bred hacks, with such airy majesty; they were absolutely\noverwhelming with their bewildering habits and their bewitching hats.\n\nEvery thing was so new in this life at Brentham to Lothair, as well\nas so agreeable, that the first days passed by no means rapidly; for,\nthough it sounds strange, time moves with equal slowness whether we\nexperience many impressions or none. In a new circle every character is\na study, and every incident an adventure; and the multiplicity of the\nimages and emotions restrains the hours. But after a few days, though\nLothair was not less delighted, for he was more so, he was astonished\nat the rapidity of time. The life was exactly the same, but equally\npleasant; the same charming companions, the same refined festivity, the\nsame fascinating amusements; but to his dismay Lothair recollected that\nnearly a fortnight had elapsed since his arrival. Lord St. Aldegonde\nalso was on the wing; he was obliged to go to Cowes to see a sick\nfriend, though he considerately left Bertha behind him. The other\nson-in-law remained, for he could not tear himself away from his wife.\nHe was so distractedly fond of Lady Montairy that he would only\nsmoke cigarettes. Lothair felt it was time to go, and he broke the\ncircumstance to his friend Bertram.\n\nThese two \"old fellows,\" as they mutually described each other, could\nnot at all agree as to the course to be pursued. Bertram looked upon\nLothair's suggestion as an act of desertion from himself. At their time\nof life, the claims of friendship are paramount. And where could Lothair\ngo to? And what was there to do? Nowhere, and nothing. Whereas, if he\nwould remain a little longer, as the duke expected and also the duchess,\nBertram would go with him anywhere he liked, and do any thing he chose.\nSo Lothair remained.\n\nIn the evening, seated by Lady Montairy, Lothair observed on her\nsister's singing, and said, \"I never heard any of our great singers, but\nI cannot believe there is a finer voice in existence.\"\n\n\"Corisande's is a fine voice,\" said Lady Montairy, \"but I admire her\nexpression more than her tone; for there are certainly many finer\nvoices, and some day you will hear them.\"\n\n\"But I prefer expression,\" said Lothair very decidedly.\n\n\"Ah, yes! doubtless,\" said Lady Montairy, who was working a purse, \"and\nthat's what we all want, I believe; at least we married daughters,\nthey say. My brother, Granville St. Aldegonde, says we are all too much\nalike, and that Bertha St. Aldegonde would be parallel if she had no\nsisters.\"\n\n\"I don't at all agree with Lord St. Aldegonde,\" said Lothair, with\nenergy. \"I do not think it is possible to have too many relatives like\nyou and your sisters.\"\n\nLady Montairy looked up with a smile, but she did not meet a smiling\ncountenance. He seemed, what is called an earnest young man, this friend\nof her brother Bertram.\n\nAt this moment the duke sent swift messengers for all: to come, even\nthe duchess, to partake in a new game just arrived from Russia, some\nmiraculous combination of billiard-balls. Some rose directly, some\nlingering a moment arranging their work, but all were in motion.\nCorisande was at the piano, and disencumbering herself of some music.\nLothair went up to her rather abruptly:\n\n\"Your singing,\" he said, \"is the finest thing I ever heard. I am so\nhappy that I am not going to leave Brentham to-morrow. There is no place\nin the world that I think equal to Brentham.\"\n\n\"And I love it, too, and no other place,\" she replied; \"and I should be\nquite happy if I never left it.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\n\nLord Montairy was passionately devoted to croquet. He flattered himself\nthat he was the most accomplished male performer existing. He would have\nthought absolutely the most accomplished, were it not for the unrivalled\nfeats of Lady Montairy. She was the queen of croquet. Her sisters\nalso used the mallet with admirable skill, but not like Georgina. Lord\nMontairy always looked forward to his summer croquet at Brentham. It\nwas a great croquet family, the Brentham family; even listless Lord St.\nAldegonde would sometimes play, with a cigar never out of his mouth.\nThey did not object to his smoking in the air. On the contrary, \"they\nrather liked it.\" Captain Mildmay, too, was a brilliant hand, and had\nwritten a treatise on croquet--the best going.\n\nThere was a great croquet-party one morning at Brentham. Some neighbors\nhad been invited who loved the sport. Mr. Blenkinsop a grave young\ngentleman, whose countenance never relaxed while he played, and who was\nunderstood, to give his mind entirely up to croquet. He was the owner\nof the largest estate in the county, and it was thought would have very\nmuch liked to have allied himself with one of the young ladies of the\nhouse of Brentham; but these flowers were always plucked so quickly,\nthat his relations with the distinguished circle never grew more\nintimate than croquet. He drove over with some fine horses, and several\ncases and bags containing instruments and weapons for the fray. His\nsister came with him, who had forty thousand pounds, but, they said, in\nsome mysterious manner dependent on his consent to her marriage; and\nit was added that Mr. Blenkinsop would not allow his sister to marry\nbecause he would miss her so much in his favorite pastime. There were\nsome other morning visitors, and one or two young curates in cassocks.\n\nIt seemed to Lothair a game of great deliberation and of more interest\nthan gayety, though sometimes a cordial cheer, and sometimes a ringing\nlaugh of amiable derision, notified a signal triumph or a disastrous\nfailure. But the scene was brilliant: a marvellous lawn, the duchess's\nTurkish tent with its rich hangings, and the players themselves, the\nprettiest of all the spectacle, with their coquettish hats, and their\nhalf-veiled and half-revealed under-raiment scarlet and silver, or blue\nand gold, made up a sparkling and modish scene.\n\nLothair, who had left the players for a while, and was regaining the\nlawn, met the duchess.\n\n\"Your grace is not going to leave us, I hope?\" he said, rather\nanxiously.\n\n\"For a moment. I have long promised to visit the new dairy; and I think\nthis a good opportunity.\"\n\n\"I wish I might be your companion,\" said Lothair; and, invited, he was\nby her grace's side.\n\nThey turned into a winding walk of thick and fragrant shrubs, and,\nafter a while, they approached a dell, surrounded with, high trees\nthat environed it with perpetual shade; in the centre of the dell was\napparently a Gothic shrine, fair in design and finished in execution,\nand this was the duchess's new dairy. A pretty sight is a first-rate\ndairy, with its flooring of fanciful tiles, and its cool and shrouded\nchambers, its stained windows and its marble slabs, and porcelain pans\nof cream, and plenteous platters of fantastically-formed butter.\n\n\"Mrs. Woods and her dairy-maids look like a Dutch picture,\" said the\nduchess. \"Were you ever in Holland?\"\n\n\"I have never been anywhere,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"You should travel,\" said the duchess.\n\n\"I have no wish,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"The duke has given me some Coreean fowls,\" said the duchess to Mrs.\nWoods, when they had concluded their visit. \"Do you think you could take\ncare of them for me?\"\n\n\"Well, Grace, I am sure I will do my best; but then they are very,\ntroublesome, and I was not fortunate with my Cochin. I had rather they\nwere sent to the aviary, Grace, if it were all the same.\"\n\n\"I should so like to see the aviary,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"Well, we will go.\"\n\nAnd this rather extended their walk, and withdrew them more from the\ngreat amusement of the day.\n\n\"I wish your grace would do me a great favor,\" said Lothair, abruptly\nbreaking a rather prolonged silence.\n\n\"And what is that?\" said the duchess.\n\n\"It is a very great favor,\" repeated Lothair.\n\n\"If it be in my power to grant it, its magnitude would only be an\nadditional recommendation.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Lothair, blushing deeply, and speaking with much agitation,\n\"I would ask your grace's permission to offer my hand to your daughter.\"\n\nThe duchess I looked amazed. \"Corisande!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes, to Lady Corisande.\"\n\n\"Corisande,\" replied the duchess, after a pause, \"has absolutely not yet\nentered the world. Corisande is a child; and you--you, my dear friend--I\nam sure you will pardon me If I say, so--you are not very much older\nthan Corisande.\"\n\n\"I have no wish to enter the world,\" said Lothair, with much decision.\n\n\"I am not an enemy to youthful marriages,\" said the duchess. \"I married\nearly myself, and my children married early; and I am very happy, and I\nhope they are; but some experience of society before we settle is most\ndesirable, and is one of the conditions, I cannot but believe, of that\nfelicity which we all seek.\"\n\n\"I hate society,\" said Lothair. \"I would never go out of my domestic\ncircle, if it were the circle I contemplate.\"\n\n\"My dear young friend,\" said the duchess, \"you could hardly have seen\nenough of society to speak with so much decision.\"\n\n\"I have seen quite enough of it,\" said Lothair. \"I went to an evening\nparty last season--I came up from Christchurch on purpose for it--and\nif ever they catch me at another, they shall inflict any penalty they\nplease.\"\n\n\"I fear it was a stupid party,\" said the duchess, smiling, and glad to\nturn, if possible, the conversation into a lighter vein.\n\n\"No, it was a very grand party, I believe, and not exactly stupid--it\nwas not, that; but I was disgusted with all I saw and all I heard. It\nseemed to me a mass of affectation, falsehood, and malignity.\"\n\n\"Oh! dear,\" said the duchess, \"how very dreadful! But I did not mean\nmerely going to parties for society; I meant knowledge of the world, and\nthat experience which enables us to form sound opinions on the affairs\nof life.\"\n\n\"Oh! as for that,\" said Lothair, \"my, opinions are already formed on\nevery subject; that is to say, every subject of importance; and, what is\nmore, they will never change.\"\n\n\"I could not say that of Corisande,\" said the duchess.\n\n\"I think we agree on all the great things,\" said Lothair, musingly. \"Her\nchurch views may be a little higher than mine, but I do not anticipate\nany permanent difficulty on that head. Although my uncle made me go to\nkirk, I always hated it and always considered myself a churchman. Then,\nas to churches themselves, she is in favor of building churches, and\nso am I; and schools--there is no quantity of schools I would not\nestablish. My opinion is, you cannot have too much education, provided\nit be founded on a religious basis. I would sooner renounce the whole of\nmy inheritance than consent to secular education.\"\n\n\"I should be sorry to see any education but a religious education,\"\nremarked the duchess.\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Lothair, \"that is our life, or a great part of it. To\ncomplete it, here is that to which I really wish to devote my existence,\nand in which I instinctively feel Lady Corisande would sympathize with\nme--the extinction of pauperism.\"\n\n\"That is a vast subject;\" said the duchess.\n\n\"It is the terror of Europe and the disgrace of Britain,\" said Lothair;\n\"and I am resolved to grapple with it. It seems to me that pauperism is\nnot an affair so much of wages as of dwellings. If the working-classes\nwere properly lodged, at their present rate of wages, they would be\nricher. They would be healthier and happier at the same cost. I am\nso convinced of this, that the moment I am master, I shall build two\nthousand cottages on any estates. I have the designs already.\"\n\n\"I am much in favor of improved dwellings for the poor,\" said the\nduchess; \"but then you must take care that your dwellings are cottages,\nand not villas like my cousin's, the Duke of Luton.\"\n\n\"I do not think I shall make that mistake,\" replied Lothair. \"It\nconstantly engages my thought. I am wearied of hearing of my wealth,\nand I am conscious it has never brought me any happiness. I have lived a\ngreat deal alone, dearest duchess, and thought much of these things, but\nI feel now I should be hardly equal to the effort, unless I had a happy\nhome to, fall back upon.\"\n\n\"And you will have a happy home in due time,\" said the duchess; \"and\nwith such good and great thoughts you deserve one. But take the advice\nof one who loved your mother, and who would extend to you the same\naffection as to her own children; before you take a step which cannot be\nrecalled, see a little more of the world.\"\n\nLothair shook his head. \"No,\" he said, after a pause. \"My idea of\nperfect society is being married as I propose, and paying visits to\nBrentham; and when the visits to Brentham ceased, then I should like you\nand the duke to pay visits to us.\"\n\n\"But that would be a fairy-tale,\" said the duchess.\n\nSo they walked on in silence.\n\nSuddenly and abruptly Lothair turned to the duchess and said, \"Does your\ngrace see objection to my speaking to your daughter?\"\n\n\"Dear friend, indeed, yes. What you would say would only agitate and\ndisturb Corisande. Her character is not yet formed, and its future\nis perplexing, at least to me,\" murmured the mother. \"She has not the\nsimple nature of her sisters. It is a deeper and more complicated mind,\nand I watch its development with fond, but anxious interest.\" Then, in\na lighter tone, she added, \"You do not know very much of us. Try to know\nmore. Everybody under this roof views you with regard, and you are the\nbrother friend of our eldest son. Wherever we are, you will always find\na home; but do not touch again upon this subject, at least at present,\nfor it distresses me.\" And then she took his arm, and pressed it, and by\nthis time they had gained the croquet-ground.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\n\nOne of the least known squares in London is Hexham Square, though it\nis one of the oldest. Not that it is very remote from the throng of\nexistence, but it is isolated in a dingy district of silent and decaying\nstreets. Once it was a favored residence of opulence and power, and its\narchitecture still indicates its former and prouder destiny. But its\nnoble mansions are now divided and broken up into separate dwellings, or\nhave been converted into chambers and offices. Lawyers, and\narchitects, and agents, dwell in apartments where the richly-sculptured\nchimney-pieces, the carved and gilded pediments over the doors, and\nsometimes even the painted ceilings, tell a tale of vanished stateliness\nand splendor.\n\nA considerable portion of the north side of the square is occupied by\none house standing in a courtyard, with iron gates to the thoroughfare.\nThis is Hexham House, and where Lord Hexham lived in the days of the\nfirst Georges. It is reduced in size since his time, two considerable\nwings, having been pulled down about sixty years ago, and their\nmaterials employed in building some residences of less pretension.\nBut the body of the dwelling-house remains, and the court-yard, though\nreduced in size, has been retained.\n\nHexham House has an old oak entrance-hall panelled with delicacy, and\nwhich has escaped the rifling of speculators in furniture; and out of\nit rises a staircase of the same material, of a noble character,\nadorned occasionally with figures; armorial animals holding shields, and\nsometimes a grotesque form rising from fruits and flowers, all doubtless\nthe work of some famous carver. The staircase led to a corridor, on\nwhich several doors open, and through one of these, at the moment of\nour history, a man, dressed in a dark cassock, and holding a card in\nhis hand, was entering a spacious chamber, meagrely, but not shabbily,\nfurnished. There was a rich cabinet and a fine picture. In the next\nroom, not less spacious, but which had a more inhabited look, a cheerful\nfire, tables covered with books and papers, and two individuals busily\nat work with their pens; he gave the card to a gentleman who wore also\nthe cassock, and who stood before the fire with a book in his hand, and\napparently dictating to one of the writers.\n\n\"Impossible!\" said the gentleman shaking his head; \"I could not even go\nin, as Monsignore Berwick is with his eminence.\"\n\n\"But what shall I do?\" said the attendant; \"his eminence said that when\nMr. Giles called he never was to be denied.\"\n\n\"The monsignore has been here a long time; you must beg Mr. Giles to\nwait. Make him comfortable; give him a newspaper; not the Tablet, the\nTimes; men like Mr. Giles love reading the advertisements. Or stop, give\nhim this, his eminence's lecture on geology; it will show him the Church\nhas no fear of science. Ah! there's my bell; Mr. Giles will not have\nto wait long.\" So saying, the gentleman put down his volume and\ndisappeared, through an antechamber, into a farther apartment.\n\nIt was a library, of moderate dimensions, and yet its well-filled\nshelves contained all the weapons of learning and controversy which the\ndeepest and the most active of ecclesiastical champions could require.\nIt was unlike modern libraries, for it was one in which folios greatly\npredominated; and they stood in solemn and sometimes magnificent array,\nfor they bore, many of them, on their ancient though costly bindings,\nthe proofs that they had belonged to many a prince and even sovereign of\nthe Church. Over the mantel-piece hung a portrait of his holiness\nPius IX., and on the table, in the midst of many papers, was an ivory\ncrucifix.\n\nThe master of the library had risen from his seat when the chief\nsecretary entered, and was receiving an obeisance. Above the middle\nheight, his stature seemed magnified by the attenuation of his form. It\nseemed that the soul never had so frail and fragile a tenement. He was\ndressed in a dark cassock with a red border, and wore scarlet stockings;\nand over his cassock a purple tippet, and on his breast a small golden\ncross. His countenance was naturally of an extreme pallor, though at\nthis moment slightly flushed with the animation of a deeply-interesting\nconference. His cheeks were hollow, and his gray eyes seemed sunk\ninto his clear and noble brow, but they flashed with irresistible\npenetration. Such was Cardinal Grandison.\n\n\"All that I can do is,\" said his eminence, when his visitor was, ushered\nout, and slightly shrugging his shoulders, \"is to get it postponed until\nI go to Rome, and even then I must not delay my visit. This crossing\nthe Alps in winter is a trial--but we must never repine; and there is\nnothing which we must not encounter to prevent incalculable mischief.\nThe publication of the Scotch hierarchy at this moment will destroy the\nlabors of years. And yet they will not see it! I cannot conceive who is\nurging them, for I am sure they must have some authority from home.--You\nhave something for me, Chidioch,\" he added inquiringly, for his keen eye\ncaught the card.\n\n\"I regret to trouble your eminence when you need repose, but the bearer\nof this card seems to have been importunate, and to have appealed to,\nyour name and personal orders;\" and he gave the cardinal the card.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the cardinal, looking at the card with much interest; \"this\nis a person I must always see.\"\n\nAnd so, in due course, they ushered into the library a gentleman with\na crimson and well-stuffed bag, of a composed yet cheerful aspect, who\naddressed the cardinal with respect but without embarrassment,\nsaying, \"I am ashamed to trouble your eminence with only matters\nof form--absolutely mere matters of form; but I obey, Sir, your own\ninstructions.\"\n\n\"It is not for me to depreciate form,\" replied the cardinal; \"and in\nbusiness there are no mere matters of form.\"\n\n\"Merely the wood accounts,\" continued the visitor; \"they must be\napproved by both the guardians or the money cannot be received by\nthe bankers. Your eminence, you see, has sanctioned the felling, and\nauthorized the sales, and these are the final accounts, which must be\nsigned before we pay in.\"\n\n\"Give them to me,\" said the cardinal, stretching out both his hands as\nhe received a mass of paper folios. His eminence resumed his chair, and\nhastily examined the sheets. \"Ah!\" he said, \"no ordinary felling--it\nreaches, over seven counties. By-the-by, Bracewood Forest--what\nabout the enclosure? I have heard no more of it.\" Then, murmuring to\nhimself--\"Grentham Wood--how well I remember Grentham Wood, with his\ndear father!\"\n\n\"If we could sign today,\" said the visitor in a tone of professional\ncajolery; \"time is important.\"\n\n\"And if shall not be wasted,\" replied the cardinal. \"But I must look\nover the accounts. I doubt not all is quite regular, but I wish to make\nmyself a little familiar with the scene of action; perhaps to recall the\npast,\" he added. \"You shall have them to-morrow, Mr. Giles.\"\n\n\"Your eminence will have very different accounts to settle in a short\ntime,\" said Mr. Giles, smiling. \"We are hard at work; it takes three of\nour clerks constantly occupied.\"\n\n\"But you have yet got time.\"\n\n\"I don't know that,\" said Mr. Giles. \"The affairs are very large. And\nthe mines--they give us the greatest trouble. Our Mr. James Roundell was\ntwo months in Wales last year about them. It took up the whole of his\nvacation. And your eminence must remember that time flies. In less than\neight months he will be of age.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" said the cardinal; \"time indeed flies, and so much to\nbe done! By-the-by, Mr. Giles, have you by any chance heard any thing\nlately of my child?\"\n\n\"I have heard of him a good deal of late, for a client of ours, Lord\nMontairy, met him at Brentham this summer, and was a long time there\nwith him. After that, I hear, he went deer-stalking with some of his\nyoung friends; but he is not very fond of Scotland; had rather too much\nof it, I suspect; but the truth is, sir, I saw him this very day.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n\n\"Some affairs have brought him up to town, and I rather doubt whether he\nwill return to Oxford--at least, so he talks.\"\n\n\"Ah! I have never seen him since he was an infant, I might say,\" said\nthe cardinal. \"I suppose I shall see him again, if only when I resign my\ntrust; but I know not. And yet few things would be more interesting to\nme than to meet him!\"\n\nMr. Giles seemed moved, for him almost a little embarrassed; he seemed\nto blush, and then he cleared his throat. \"It would be too great a\nliberty,\" said Mr. Giles, \"I feel that very much--and yet, if your\neminence would condescend, though I hardly suppose it possible, his\nlordship is really going to do us the honor of dining with us to-day;\nonly a few friends, and if your eminence could make the sacrifice, and\nit were not an act of too great presumption, to ask your eminence to\njoin our party.\"\n\n\"I never eat and I never drink,\" said the cardinal. \"I am sorry, to say\nI cannot. I like dinner society very much. You see the world, and you\nhear things which you do not hear otherwise. For a time I presumed to\naccept invitations, though I sat with an empty plate, but, though the\nworld was indulgent to me, I felt that my habits were an embarrassment\nto the happier feasters: it was not fair, and so I gave it up. But\nI tell you what, Mr. Giles: I shall be in your quarter this evening:\nperhaps you would permit me to drop in and pay my respects to Mrs.\nGiles--I have wished to do so before.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\n\nMr. Giles was a leading partner in the firm of Roundells, Giles, and\nRoundell, among the most eminent solicitors of Lincoln's Inn. He, in\nthose days of prolonged maturity, might be described as still a young\nman. He had inherited from his father not only a large share in a\nfirst-rate business, but no inconsiderable fortune; and though he had,\nin her circles, a celebrated wife, he had no children. He was opulent\nand prosperous, with no cares and anxieties of his own, and loved\nhis profession, for which he was peculiarly qualified, being a man\nof uncommon sagacity, very difficult to deceive, and yet one who\nsympathized with his clients, who were all personally attached to him,\nand many of whom were among the distinguished personages of the realm.\n\nDuring an important professional visit to Ireland, Mr. Giles had made\nthe acquaintance of Miss Apollonia Smylie, the niece of an Irish peer;\nand, though the lady was much admired and courted, had succeeded, after\na time, in inducing her to become the partner of his life.\n\nMrs. Giles, or, as she described herself, Mrs. Putney Giles, taking\nadvantage of a second and territorial Christian name of her husband,\nwas a showy woman; decidedly handsome, unquestionably accomplished, and\ngifted with energy and enthusiasm which far exceeded even her physical\nadvantages. Her principal mission was to destroy the papacy and to\nsecure Italian unity. Her lesser impulses were to become acquainted with\nthe aristocracy, and to be herself surrounded by celebrities. Having a\nfine house in Tyburnia, almost as showy as herself, and a husband who\nwas never so happy as when gratifying her wishes, she did not find it\ndifficult in a considerable degree to pursue and even accomplish her\nobjects. The Putney Giles gave a great many dinners, and Mrs. Putney\nreceived her world frequently, if not periodically. As they entertained\nwith profusion, her well-lighted saloons were considerably attended.\nThese assemblies were never dull; the materials not being ordinary,\noften startling, sometimes even brilliant, occasionally rather\nheterogeneous. For, though being a violent Protestant, and of extreme\nconservative opinions, her antipapal antipathies and her Italian\npredilections frequently involved her with acquaintances not so\ndistinguished as she deemed herself for devotion to the cause of order\nand orthodoxy. It was rumored that the brooding brow of Mazzini had been\nobserved in her rooms, and there was no sort of question that she had\nthrown herself in ecstatic idolatry at the feet of the hero of Caprera.\n\nOn the morning of the day on which he intended to visit Cardinal\nGrandison, Mr. Giles, in his chambers at Lincoln's Inn, was suddenly\napprised, by a clerk, that an interview with him was sought by a client\nno less distinguished than Lothair.\n\nAlthough Mr. Giles sat opposite two rows of tin boxes, each of which was\nnumbered, and duly inscribed with the name of Lothair and that of the\nparticular estate to which it referred, Mr. Giles, though he had had\noccasional communications with his client, was personally unacquainted\nwith him. He viewed, therefore, with no ordinary curiosity the young man\nwho was ushered into his room; a shapely youth slightly above the middle\nheight; of simple, but distinguished mien, with a countenance naturally\npale, though somewhat bronzed by a life of air and exercise, and a\nprofusion of dark-auburn hair.\n\nAnd for what could Lothair be calling on Mr. Giles?\n\nIt seems that one of Lothair's intimate companions had got into a\nscrape, and under these circumstances had what is styled \"made a friend\"\nof Lothair; that is to say, confided to him his trouble, and asked his\nadvice, with a view, when given, of its being followed by an offer of\nassistance.\n\nLothair, though inexperienced, and very ingenuous, was not devoid of\na certain instinctive perception of men and, things, which rendered it\ndifficult for him to be an easy prey. His natural disposition, and his\ncomparatively solitary education, had made him a keen observer, and\nhe was one who meditated over his observations. But he was\nnaturally generous and sensible of kindness; and this was a favorite\ncompanion--next to Bertram, his most intimate.\n\nLothair was quite happy in the opportunity of soothing a perturbed\nspirit whose society had been to him a source of so much gratification.\n\nIt was not until Lothair had promised to extricate his friend from his\nwhelming difficulties, that, upon examination, he found the act on\nhis part was not so simple and so easy as he had assumed it to be. His\nguardians had apportioned to him an allowance in every sense adequate to\nhis position; and there was no doubt, had he wished to exceed it for\nany legitimate purpose, not the slightest difficulty on their part would\nhave been experienced.\n\nSuch a conjuncture had never occurred. Lothair was profuse, but he was\nnot prodigal. He gratified all his fancies, but they were not ignoble\nones; and he was not only sentimentally, but systematically, charitable.\nHe had a great number of fine horses, and he had just paid for an\nexpensive yacht. In a word, he spent a great deal of money, and until he\ncalled at his bankers to learn what sums were at his disposition he was\nnot aware that he had overdrawn his account.\n\nThis was rather awkward. Lothair wanted a considerable sum, and he\nwanted it at once. Irrespective of the consequent delay, he shrunk from\nany communication with his guardians. From his uncle he had become,\nalmost insensibly, estranged, and with his other guardian he had never\nhad the slightest communication. Under these circumstances he recalled\nthe name of the solicitor of the trustees, between whom and himself\nthere had been occasional correspondence; and, being of a somewhat\nimpetuous disposition, he rode off at once from his hotel to Lincoln's\nInn.\n\nMr. Giles listened to the narrative with unbroken interest and\nunswerving patience, with his eyes fixed on his client, and occasionally\ngiving a sympathetic nod.\n\n\"And so,\" concluded Lothair, \"I thought I would come to you.\"\n\n\"We are honored,\" said Mr. Giles. \"And, certainly, it is quite absurd\nthat your lordship should want money, and for a worthy purpose, and\nnot be able to command it. Why! the balance in the name of the trustees\nnever was so great as at this moment; and this very day, or to-morrow\nat farthest, I shall pay no less than eight-and-thirty thousand pounds\ntimber-money to the account.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't want a fifth of that,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"Your lordship has an objection to apply to the trustees?\" inquired Mr.\nGiles.\n\n\"That is the point of the whole of my statement,\" said Lothair somewhat\nimpatiently.\n\n\"And yet it is the right and regular thing,\" said Mr. Giles.\n\n\"It may be right and it may be regular, but it is out of the question.\"\n\n\"Then we will say no more about it. What I want to prevent,\" said Mr.\nGiles, musingly, \"is any thing absurd happening. There is no doubt if\nyour lordship went into the street and said you wanted ten thousand\npounds, or a hundred thousand, fifty people would supply you\nimmediately--but you would have to pay for it. Some enormous usury! That\nwould be bad; but the absurdity of the thing would be greater than the\nmischief. Roundells, Giles, and Roundell could not help you in that\nmanner. That is not our business. We are glad to find money for\nour clients at a legal rate of interest, and the most moderate rate\nfeasible. But then there must be security, and the best security. But\nhere we must not conceal it from ourselves, my lord, we have no\nsecurity whatever. At this moment your lordship has no property. An\ninsurance-office might do it with a policy. They might consider that\nthey had a moral security; but still it would be absurd. There is\nsomething absurd in your lordship having to raise money. Don't you think\nI could see these people,\" said Mr. Giles, \"and talk to them, and gain a\nlittle time? We only want a little time.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Lothair, in a peremptory tone. \"I said I would do it, and it\nmust be done, and at once. Sooner than there should be delay, I would\nrather go into the street, as you suggest, and ask the first man I met\nto lend me the money. My word has been given, and I do not care what I\npay to fulfil my word.\"\n\n\"We must not think of such things,\" said Mr. Giles, shaking his head.\n\"All I want your lordship to understand is the exact position. In this\ncase we have no security. Roundells, Giles, and Roundell cannot move\nwithout security. It would be against our articles of partnership. But\nMr. Giles, as a private individual, may do what he likes. I will let\nyour lordship have the money, and I will take no security whatever--not\neven a note of hand. All that I ask for is that your lordship should\nwrite me a letter, saying you have urgent need for a sum of money\n(mentioning amount) for an honorable purpose, in which your feelings\nare deeply interested--and that will do. If any thing happens to your\nlordship before this time next year, why, I think the trustees could\nhardly refuse repaying the money; and if they did, why then,\" added Mr.\nGiles, \"I suppose it will be all the same a hundred years hence.\"\n\n\"You have conferred on me the greatest obligation,\" said Lothair, with\nmuch earnestness. \"Language cannot express what I feel. I am not too\nmuch used to kindness, and I only hope that I may live to show my sense\nof yours.\"\n\n\"It is really no great affair, my lord,\" said Mr. Giles. \"I did not\nwish to make difficulties, but it was my duty to put the matter clearly\nbefore you. What I propose I could to do is really nothing. I could do\nno less; I should have felt quite absurd if your lordship had gone into\nthe money-market.\"\n\n\"I only hope,\" repeated Lothair, rising and offering Mr. Giles his hand,\n\"that life may give me some occasion to prove my gratitude.\"\n\n\"Well, my lord,\" replied Mr. Giles, \"if your lordship wish to repay me\nfor any little interest I have shown in your affairs, you can do that,\nover and over again, and at once.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"By a very great favor, by which Mrs. Giles and myself would be deeply\ngratified. We have a few friends who honor us by dining with us to-day\nin Hyde Park Gardens. If your lordship would add the great distinction\nyour presence--\"\n\n\"I should only be too much honored,\" exclaimed Lothair: \"I suppose about\neight,\" and he left the room; and Mr. Giles telegraphed instantly the\nimpending event to Apollonia.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\n\nIt was a great day for Apollonia; not only to have Lothair at her right\nhand at dinner, but the prospect of receiving a cardinal in the evening.\nBut she was equal to it; though so engrossed, indeed, in the immediate\ngratification of her hopes and wishes, that she could scarcely dwell\nsufficiently on the coming scene of triumph and social excitement.\n\nThe repast was sumptuous; Lothair thought the dinner would never end,\nthere were so many dishes, and apparently all of the highest pretension.\nBut if his simple tastes had permitted him to take an interest in these\ndetails, which, they did not, he would have been assisted by a gorgeous\nmenu of gold and white typography, that was by the side of each guest.\nThe table seemed literally to groan under vases and gigantic flagons,\nand, in its midst, rose a mountain of silver, on which apparently\nall the cardinal virtues, several of the pagan deities, and Britannia\nherself, illustrated with many lights a glowing inscription, which\ndescribed the fervent feelings of a grateful client.\n\nThere were many guests--the Dowager of Farringford, a lady of quality,\nApollonia's great lady, who exercised under this roof much social\ntyranny; in short, was rather fine; but who, on this occasion, was\nsomewhat cowed by the undreamt-of presence of Lothair. She had not yet\nmet him, and probably never would have met him, had she not had the good\nfortune of dining at his lawyer's. However, Lady Farringford was placed\na long way from Lothair, having been taken down to dinner by Mr. Giles;\nand so, by the end of the first course, Lady Farringford had nearly\nresumed her customary despotic vein, and was beginning to indulge in\nseveral kind observations, cheapening to her host and hostess, and\nindirectly exalting herself; upon which Mr. Giles took an early easy\nopportunity of apprising Lady Farringford, that she had nearly met\nCardinal Grandison at dinner, and that his eminence would certainly pay\nhis respects to Mrs. Putney Giles in the evening. As Lady Farringford\nwas at present a high ritualist and had even been talked of as \"going\nto Rome,\" this intelligence was stunning, and it was observed that her\nladyship was unusually subdued during the whole of the second course.\n\nOn the right of Lothair sat the wife of a vice-chancellor, a quiet\nand pleasing lady, to whom Lothair, with natural good breeding, paid\nsnatches of happy attention, when he could for a moment with propriety\nwithdraw himself from the blaze of Apollonia's coruscating conversation.\nThen there was a rather fierce-looking Red Ribbon, medalled, as well\nas be-starred, and the Red Ribbon's wife, with a blushing daughter, in\nspite of, her parentage not yet accustomed to stand fire. A partner and\nhis unusually numerous family had the pleasure also of seeing Lothair\nfor the first time, and there were no less than four M.P.s, one of whom\nwas even in office.\n\nApollonia was stating to Lothair, with perspicuity, the reasons which\nquite induced her to believe that the Gulf-Stream had changed its\ncourse, and the political and social consequences that might accrue.\n\n\"The religious sentiment of the Southern races must be wonderfully\naffected by a more rigorous climate,\" said Apollonia. \"I cannot doubt,\"\nshe continued, \"that a series of severe winters at Rome might put an end\nto Romanism.\"\n\n\"But is there any fear that a reciprocal influence might be exercised\non the Northern nations?\" inquired Lothair. \"Would there be any\napprehension of our Protestantism becoming proportionately relaxed?\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" said Apollonia. \"Truth cannot be affected by climate.\nTruth is truth, alike in Palestine and Scandinavia.\"\n\n\"I wonder what the cardinal would think of this,\" said Lothair, \"who,\nyou tell me, is coming to you this evening?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am most interested to see him, though he is the most puissant of\nour foes. Of course he would take refuge in sophistry; and science, you\nknow, they deny.\"\n\n\"Cardinal Grandison is giving some lectures on science,\" said the\nvice-chancellor's lady, quietly.\n\n\"It is remorse,\" said Apollonia. \"Their clever men can never forget that\nunfortunate affair of Galileo, and think they can divert the indignation\nof the ninteenth century by mock zeal about red sandstone or the origin\nof species.\"\n\n\"And are you afraid of the Gulf-Stream?\" inquired Lothair of his calmer\nneighbor.\n\n\"I think we want more evidence of a change. The vice-chancellor and\nmyself went down to a place we have near town, on Saturday, where there\nis a very nice piece of water; indeed, some people call it a lake; but\nit was quite frozen, and my boys wanted to skate, but that I would not\npermit.\"\n\n\"You believe in the Gulf-Stream to that extent,\" said Lothair--\"no\nskating.\"\n\nThe cardinal came, early; the ladies had not long left the dining-room.\nThey were agitated when his name was announced; even Apollonia's\nheart beat; but then that might be accounted for by the inopportune\nrecollection of an occasional correspondence with Caprera.\n\nNothing could exceed the simple suavity with which the cardinal\nappeared, approached, and greeted them. He thanked Apollonia for her\npermission to pay his respects to her, which he had long wished to do;\nand then they were all presented, and he said exactly the right thing\nto every one. He must have heard of them all before, or read their\ncharacters in their countenances. In a few minutes they were all\nlistening to his eminence with enchanted ease, as, sitting on the\nsofa by his hostess, he described to them the ambassadors who had\njust arrived from Japan, and with whom he had relations of interesting\naffairs. The Japanese government had exhibited enlightened kindness to\nsome of his poor people who had barely escaped martyrdom. Much might be\nexpected from the Mikado, evidently a man of singular penetration and\nelevated views; and his eminence looked as if the mission of Yokohama\nwould speedily end in an episcopal see; but he knew where he was and\nstudiously avoided all controversial matter.\n\nAfter all, the Mikado himself was not more remarkable than this prince\nof the Church in a Tyburnian drawing-room habited in his pink cassock\nand cape, and waving, as he spoke, with careless grace, his pink\nbarrette.\n\nThe ladies thought the gentlemen rejoined them too soon, but Mr. Giles,\nwhen he was apprised of the arrival of the cardinal, thought it right\nto precipitate the symposium. With great tact, when the cardinal rose to\ngreet him, Mr. Giles withdrew his eminence from those surrounding,\nand, after a brief interchange of whispered words, quitted him and then\nbrought forward and presented Lothair to the cardinal, and left them.\n\n\"This is not the first time that we should have met,\" said the cardinal,\n\"but my happiness is so great at this moment that, though I deplore, I\nwill not dwell on, the past.\"\n\n\"I am, nevertheless, grateful to you, sir, for many services, and have\nmore than once contemplated taking the liberty of personally assuring\nyour a eminence of my gratitude.\"\n\n\"I think we might sit down,\" said the cardinal, looking around; and then\nhe led Lothair into an open but interior saloon, where none were yet\npresent, and where they seated themselves on a sofa and were soon\nengaged in apparently interesting converse.\n\nIn the mean time the world gradually filled the principal saloon of\nApollonia, and, when it approached overflowing, occasionally some\npersons passed the line, and entered the room in which the cardinal and\nhis ward were seated, and then, as if conscious of violating some sacred\nplace, drew back. Others, on the contrary, with coarser curiosity, were\ninduced to invade the chamber from the mere fact that the cardinal was\nto be seen there.\n\n\"My geographical instinct,\" said the cardinal to Lothair, \"assures me\nthat I can regain the staircase through these rooms, without rejoining\nthe busy world; so I shall bid you good-night and even presume to give\nyou my blessing;\" and his eminence glided away.\n\nWhen Lothair returned to the saloon it was so crowded that he was not\nobserved; exactly what he liked; and he stood against the wall watching\nall that passed, not without amusement. A lively, social parasite, who\nhad dined there, and had thanked his stars at dinner that Fortune had,\ndecreed he should meet Lothair, had been cruising for his prize all the\ntime that Lothair had been conversing with the cardinal and was soon at\nhis side.\n\n\"A strange scene this!\" said the parasite.\n\n\"Is it unusual?\" inquired Lothair.\n\n\"Such a medley! How can they can be got together, I marvel--priests and\nphilosophers, legitimists, and carbonari! Wonderful woman, Mrs. Putney\nGiles!\"\n\n\"She is very entertaining,\" said Lothair, \"and seems to me clever.\"\n\n\"Remarkably so,\" said the parasite, who had been on the point of\nsatirizing his hostess, but, observing the quarter of the wind, with\nrapidity went in for praise. \"An extraordinary woman. Your lordship had\na long talk with the cardinal.\"\n\n\"I had the honor of some conversation with Cardinal Grandison,\" said\nLothair, drawing up.\n\n\"I wonder what the cardinal would have said if he had met Mazzini here?\"\n\n\"Mazzini! Is he here?\"\n\n\"Not now; but I have seen him here,\" said the parasite, \"and our host\nsuch a Tory! That makes the thing so amusing;\" and then the parasite\nwent on making small personal observations on the surrounding scene, and\nevery now and then telling little tales of great people with whom, it\nappeared, he was intimate--all concerted fire to gain the very great\nsocial fortress he was now besieging. The parasite was so full of\nhimself, and so anxious to display himself to advantage, that with all\nhis practice it was some time before he perceived he did not make all\nthe way he could wish with Lothair; who was courteous, but somewhat\nmonosyllabic and absent.\n\n\"Your lordship is struck by that face?\" said the parasite.\n\nWas Lothair struck by that face? And what was it?\n\nHe had exchanged glances with that face during the last ten minutes, and\nthe mutual expression was not one of sympathy but curiosity blended, on\nthe part of the face, with an expression, if not of disdain, of extreme\nreserve.\n\nIt was the face of a matron, apparently of not many summers, for her\nshapely figure was still slender, though her mien was stately. But it\nwas the countenance that had commanded the attention of Lothair: pale,\nbut perfectly Attic in outline, with the short upper lip and the round\nchin, and a profusion of dark-chestnut hair bound by a Grecian fillet,\nand on her brow a star.\n\n\"Yes I am struck by that face. Who is it?\"\n\n\"If your lordship could only get a five-franc piece of the last French\nRepublic, 1850, you would know. I dare say the money-changers could\nget you one. All the artists of Paris, painters, and sculptors, and\nmedallists, were competing to produce a face worthy of representing 'La\nR publique fran aise;' nobody was satisfied, when Oudine caught a girl\nof not seventeen, and, with a literal reproduction of Nature, gained the\nprize with unanimity.\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"And, though years have passed, the countenance has not changed; perhaps\nimproved.\"\n\n\"It is a countenance that will bear, perhaps even would require,\nmaturity,\" said Lothair; \"but she is no longer 'La R publique fran\naise;' what is she now?\"\n\n\"She is called Theodora, though married, I believe, to an Englishman,\na friend of Garibaldi. Her birth unknown; some say an Italian, some\na Pole; all sorts of stories. But she speaks every language, is\nultra-cosmopolitan, and has invented a new religion.\"\n\n\"A new religion!\"\n\n\"Would your lordship care to be introduced to her? I know her enough for\nthat. Shall we go up to her?\"\n\n\"I have made so many now acquaintances to-day,\" said, Lothair, as it\nwere starting from a reverie, \"and indeed heard so many new things, that\nI think I had better say good-night;\" and he graciously retired.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\n\nAbout the same time that Lothair had repaired to the residence of Mr.\nGiles, Monsignore Berwick, whose audience of the cardinal in the morning\nhad preceded that of the legal adviser of the trustees, made his way\ntoward one of the noblest mansions in St. James's Square, where resided\nLord St. Jerome.\n\nIt was a mild winter evening; a little fog still hanging about, but\nvanquished by the cheerful lamps, and the voice of the muffin-bell was\njust heard at intervals; a genial sound that calls up visions of trim\nand happy hearths. If we could only so contrive our lives as to go into\nthe country for the first note of the nightingale, and return to town\nfor the first note of the muffin-bell, existence, it is humbly presumed,\nmight be more enjoyable.\n\nMonsignore Berwick was a young man, but looking younger from a\ncountenance almost of childhood; fair, with light-blue eyes, and flaxen\nhair and delicate features. He was the last person you would have fixed\nupon as a born Roman; but Nature, in one of the freaks of race, had\nresolved that his old Scottish blood should be reasserted, though his:\nancestors had sedulously blended it, for, many generations, with that of\nthe princely houses of the eternal city. The monsignore was the greatest\nstatesman of Rome, formed and favored by Antonelli and probably his\nsuccessor.\n\nThe mansion of Lord St. Jerome was a real family mansion, built by his\nancestors a century and a half ago, when they believed that, from its\ncentral position, its happy contiguity to the court, the senate, and the\nseats of government, they at last, in St. James's Square, had discovered\na site which could defy the vicissitudes of fashion, and not share\nthe fate of the river palaces, which they had been obliged in turn\nto relinquish. And in a considerable degree they were right in their\nanticipation; for, although they have somewhat unwisely, permitted the\nclubs to invade too successfully their territory, St. James's Square\nmay be looked upon as our Faubourg St. Germain, and a great patrician\nresiding there dwells in the heart of that free and noble life of which\nhe ought to be a part.\n\nA marble hall and a marble staircase, lofty chambers with silk or\ntapestried hangings, gilded cornices, and painted ceilings, gave a\nglimpse of almost Venetian splendor, and rare in our metropolitan houses\nof this age; but the first dwellers in St. James's Square had tender\nand inspiring recollections of the Adrian bride, had frolicked in St.\nMark's, and glided in adventurous gondolas. The monsignore was ushered\ninto a chamber bright with lights and a blazing fire, and welcomed with\nextreme cordiality by his hostess, who was then alone. Lady St. Jerome\nwas still the young wife of a nobleman not old. She was the daughter of\na Protestant house, but, during a residence at Rome after her marriage,\nshe had reverted to the ancient faith, which she professed with the\nenthusiastic convictions of a convert. Her whole life was dedicated to\nthe triumph of the Catholic cause; and, being a woman of considerable\nintelligence and of an ardent mind, she had become a recognized power in\nthe great confederacy which has so much influenced the human race,\nand which has yet to play perhaps a mighty part in the fortunes of the\nworld.\n\n\"I was in great hopes that the cardinal would have met you at dinner,\"\nsaid Lady St. Jerome, \"but he wrote only this afternoon to say\nunexpected business would prevent him, but he would be here in the\nevening, though late.\"\n\n\"It must be something sudden, for I was with his eminence this morning,\nand he then contemplated our meeting here.\"\n\n\"Nothing from abroad?\"\n\n\"I should think not, or it would be known to me. There is nothing new\nfrom abroad this afternoon: my time has been spent in writing, not\nreceiving, dispatches.\"\n\n\"And all well, I hope?\"\n\n\"This Scotch business plagues us. So far as Scotland is concerned, it is\nquite ripe; but the cardinal counsels delay on account of this country,\nand he has such a consummate knowledge of England, that--\"\n\nAt this moment Lord St Jerome entered the room--a grave but gracious\npersonage, polished but looking silent, though he immediately turned\nthe conversation to the weather. The monsignore began denouncing English\nfogs; but Lord St. Jerome maintained that, on the whole, there were not\nmore fogs in England than in any other country; \"and as for the French,\"\nhe added, \"I like their audacity, for, when they revolutionized the\ncalendar, they called one of their months Brumaire.\"\n\nThen came in one of his lordships chaplains, who saluted the monsignore\nwith reverence, and immediately afterward a beautiful young lady, his\nniece, Clare Arundel.\n\nThe family were living in a convenient suite of small rooms on the\nground-floor, called the winter-rooms so dinner was announced by the\ndoors of an adjoining chamber being thrown open, and there they saw, in\nthe midst of a chamber hung with green silk and adorned with some fine\ncabinet-pictures, a small round table, bright and glowing.\n\nIt was a lively dinner. Lord St. Jerome loved conversation, though he\nnever conversed. \"There must be an audience,\" he would say, \"and I am\nthe audience.\" The partner of his life, whom he never ceased admiring,\nhad originally fascinated him by her conversational talents; and, even\nif Nature had not impelled her, Lady St. Jerome was too wise a woman\nto relinquish the spell. The monsignore could always, when necessary,\nsparkle with anecdote or blaze with repartee; and all the chaplains, who\nabounded in this house, were men of bright abilities, not merely men of\nreading, but of the world, learned in the world's ways, and trained to\ngovern mankind by versatility of their sympathies. It was a dinner where\nthere could not be two conversations going on, and where even the silent\ntake their share in the talk by their sympathy.\n\nAnd among the silent, as silent even as Lord St. Jerome, was Miss\nArundel; and yet her large violet eyes, darker even than her dark-brown\nhair, and gleaming with intelligence, and her rich face mantling with\nemotion, proved she was not insensible to the witty passages and the\nbright and interesting narratives that were sparkling and flowing about\nher.\n\nThe gentlemen left the dining-room with the ladies, in the Continental\nmanner. Lady St. Jerome, who was leaning on the arm of the monsignore,\nguided him into a saloon farther than the one they had reentered, and\nthen seating herself said, \"You were telling me about Scotland, that you\nyourself thought it ripe.\"\n\n\"Unquestionably. The original plan was to have established our hierarchy\nwhen the Kirk split up; but that would have been a mistake, it was not\nthen ripe. There would have been a fanatical reaction. There is always\na tendency that way in Scotland: as it is, at this moment, the\nEstablishment and the Free Kirk are mutually sighing for some compromise\nwhich may bring them together and, if the proprietors would give up\ntheir petty patronage, some flatter themselves it might be arranged. But\nwe are thoroughly well informed, and have provided for all this. We sent\ntwo of our best men into Scotland some time ago, and they have invented\na new church, called the United Presbyterians. John Knox himself was\nnever more violent, or more mischievous. The United Presbyterians will\ndo the business: they will render Scotland simply impossible to live\nin; and then, when the crisis arrives, the distracted and despairing\nmillions will find refuge in the bosom of their only mother. That is\nwhy, at home, we wanted no delay in the publication of the bull and the\nestablishment of the hierarchy.\"\n\n\"But the cardinal says no?\"\n\n\"And must be followed. For these islands he has no equal. He wishes\ngreat reserve at present. Affairs here are progressing, gradually but\nsurely. But it is Ireland where matters are critical, or will be soon.\"\n\n\"Ireland! I thought there was a sort of understanding there--at least\nfor the present.\"\n\nThe monsignore shook his head. \"What do you think of an American\ninvasion of Ireland?\"\n\n\"An American invasion!\"\n\n\"Even so; nothing more probable, and nothing more to be deprecated by\nus. Now that the civil war in America is over, the Irish soldiery are\nresolved to employ their experience and their weapons in their own\nland; but they have no thought for the interest of the Holy See, or the\nwelfare of our holy religion. Their secret organization is tampering\nwith the people and tampering with the priests. The difficulty of\nIreland is that the priests and the people will consider every thing\nin a purely Irish point of view. To gain some local object, they will\nencourage the principles of the most lawless liberalism, which naturally\nland them in Fenianism and atheism. And the danger is not foreseen,\nbecause the Irish political object of the moment is alone looked to.\"\n\n\"But surely they can be guided?\"\n\n\"We want a statesman in Ireland. We have never been able to find one; we\nwant a man like the cardinal. But the Irish will have a native for their\nchief. We caught Churchill young, and educated him in the Propaganda;\nbut he has disappointed us. At first all seemed well; he was reserved\nand austere; and we heard with satisfaction that he was unpopular. But,\nnow that critical times are arriving, his peasant-blood cannot resist\nthe contagion. He proclaims the absolute equality of all religious, and\nof the power of the state to confiscate ecclesiastical property, and not\nrestore it to us, but alienate it forever. For the chance of subverting\nthe Anglican Establishment, he is favoring a policy which will subvert\nreligion itself. In his eagerness he cannot see that the Anglicans have\nonly a lease of our property, a lease which is rapidly expiring.\"\n\n\"This is sad.\"\n\n\"It is perilous, and difficult to deal with. But it must be dealt\nwith. The problem is to suppress Fenianism, and not to strengthen the\nProtestant confederacy.\"\n\n\"And you left Rome for this? We understood you were coming for something\nelse,\" said Lady St. Jerome, in a significant tone.\n\n\"Yes, yes, I have been there, and I have seen him.\"\n\n\"And have you succeeded?\"\n\n\"No; and no one will--at least at present.\"\n\n\"Is all lost, then? Is the Malta scheme again on the carpet?\"\n\n\"Our Holy Church in built upon a rock,\" said the monsignore, \"but not\nupon the rock of Malta. Nothing is lost; Antonelli is calm and sanguine,\nthough, rest assured, there is no doubt about what I tell you. France\nhas washed her hands of us.\"\n\n\"Where, then, are we to look for aid?\" exclaimed Lady St. Jerome,\n\"against the assassins and atheists? Austria, the alternative ally,\nis no longer near you; and if she were--that I should ever live to say\nit--even Austria is our foe.\"\n\n\"Poor Austria!\" said the monsignore with an unctuous sneer. \"Two things\nmade her a nation; she was German and she was Catholic, and now she is\nneither.\"\n\n\"But you alarm me, my dear lord, with your terrible news. We once\nthought that Spain would be our protector, but we hear bad news from\nSpain.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the monsignore, \"I think it highly probable that, before a\nfew years have elapsed, every government in Europe will be atheistical\nexcept France. Vanity will always keep France the eldest son of the\nChurch, even if she wear a bonnet rouge. But, if the Holy Father keep\nRome, these strange changes will only make the occupier of the chair of\nSt. Peter more powerful. His subjects will be In every clime and every\ncountry, and then they will be only his subjects. We shall get rid of\nthe difficulty of the divided allegiance, Lady St. Jerome, which plagued\nour poor forefathers so much.\"\n\n\"If we keep Rome,\" said Lady St. Jerome.\n\n\"And we shall. Let Christendom give us her prayers for the next few\nyears, and Pio Nono will become the most powerful monarch In Europe, and\nperhaps the only one.\"\n\n\"I hear a sound,\" exclaimed Lady St. Jerome. \"Yes! the cardinal has\ncome. Let us greet him.\"\n\nBut as they were approaching the saloon the cardinal met them, and waved\nthem back. \"We will return,\" he said, \"to our friends immediately, but I\nwant to say one word to you both.\"\n\nHe made them sit down. \"I am a little restless,\" he said, and stood\nbefore the fire. \"Something interesting has happened; nothing to do with\npublic affairs. Do not pitch your expectations too high--but still of\nimportance, and certainly of great interest--at least to me. I have seen\nmy child--my ward.\"\n\n\"Indeed an event!\" said Lady St. Jerome, evidently much interested.\n\n\"And what is he like?\" inquired the monsignore.\n\n\"All that one could wish. Extremely good-looking, highly bred, and most\ningenuous; a considerable intelligence, and not untrained; but the most\nabsolutely unaffected person I ever encountered.\"\n\n\"Ah! if he had been trained by your eminence,\" sighed Lady St. Jerome.\n\"Is it too late?\"\n\n\"'Tis an immense position,\" murmured Berwick.\n\n\"What good might he not do?\" said Lady St. Jerome; \"and if he be so\ningenuous, it seems impossible that he can resist the truth.\"\n\n\"Your ladyship is a sort of cousin of his,\" said the cardinal, musingly.\n\n\"Yes; but very remote. I dare say he would not acknowledge the tie. But\nwe are kin; we have the same blood in our veins.\"\n\n\"You should make his acquaintance,\" said the cardinal.\n\n\"I more than desire it. I hear he has been terribly neglected, brought\nup among the most dreadful people, entirely infidels and fanatics.\"\n\n\"He has been nearly two years at Oxford,\" said the cardinal. \"That may\nhave mitigated the evil.\"\n\n\"Ah! but you, my lord cardinal, you must interfere. Now that you at last\nknow him, you must undertake the great task; you must save him.\"\n\n\"We must all pray, as I pray every morn and every night,\" said the\ncardinal, \"for the conversion of England.\"\n\n\"Or the conquest,\" murmured Berwick.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\n\nAs the cardinal was regaining his carriage on leaving Mrs. Giles's\nparty, there was, about the entrance of the house, the usual gathering\nunder such circumstances; some zealous linkboys marvellously familiar\nwith London life, and some midnight loungers, who thus take their humble\nshare of the social excitement, and their happy chance of becoming\nacquainted with some of the notables of the wondrous world of which\nthey form the base. This little gathering, ranged at the instant into\nstricter order by the police to facilitate the passage of his eminence,\nprevented the progress of a passenger, who exclaimed in an audible,\nbut not noisy voice, as if, he were ejaculating to himself, \"A bas les\npretres!\"\n\nThis exclamation, unintelligible to the populace, was noticed only\nby the only person who understood it. The cardinal, astonished at the\nunusual sound--for, hitherto, he had always found the outer world of\nLondon civil; or at least indifferent--threw his penetrating glance\nat the passenger, and caught clearly the visage on which the lamplight\nfully shone. It was a square, sinewy face, closely shaven, with the\nexception of a small but thick mustache, brown as the well-cropped hair,\nand blending with the hazel eye; a calm, but determined countenance;\nclearly not that of an Englishman, for he wore ear-rings.\n\nThe carriage drove off, and the passenger, somewhat forcing his way\nthrough the clustering group, continued his course until he reached the\ncab-stand near the Marble Arch, when he engaged a vehicle and ordered\nto be driven to Leicester Square. That quarter of the town exhibits\nan animated scene toward the witching hour; many lights and much\npopulation, illuminated coffee-houses, the stir of a large theatre,\nbands of music in the open air, and other sounds, most of them gay, and\nsome festive. The stranger, whose compact figure was shrouded by a long\nfur cape, had not the appearance of being influenced by the temptation\nof amusement. As he stopped in the square and looked around him, the\nexpression of his countenance was moody, perhaps even anxious. He seemed\nto be making observations on the locality, and, after a few minutes,\ncrossed the open space and turned up into a small street which opened\ninto the square. In this street was a coffee-house of some pretension,\nconnected indeed with an hotel, which had been formed out of two houses,\nand therefore possessed no inconsiderable accommodation.\n\nThe coffee-room was capacious, and adorned in a manner which intimated\nit was not kept by an Englishman, or much used by Englishmen. The walls\nwere painted in frescoed arabesques. There were many guests, principally\nseated at small tables of marble, and on benches and chairs covered with\na coarse crimson velvet. Some were sipping coffee, some were drinking\nwine, others were smoking or playing dominoes, or doing both; while many\nwere engaged in reading the foreign journals which abounded.\n\nAn ever-vigilant waiter was at the side of the stranger the instant he\nentered, and wished to know his pleasure. The stranger was examining\nwith his keen eye every individual in the room while this question was\nasked and repeated.\n\n\"What would I wish?\" said the stranger, having concluded his inspection,\nand as it were summoning back his recollection. \"I would wish to see,\nand at once, one Mr. Perroni, who, I believe, lives here.\"\n\n\"Why, 'tis the master!\" exclaimed the waiter.\n\n\"Well, then, go and tell the master that I want him.\"\n\n\"But the master is much engaged,\" said the waiter, \"--particularly.\"\n\n\"I dare say; but you will go and tell him that I particularly want to\nsee him.\"\n\nThe waiter, though prepared to be impertinent to any one else, felt that\none was speaking to him who must be obeyed, and, with a subdued, but\nhesitating manner, said, \"There is a meeting to-night up-stairs, where\nthe master is secretary, and it is difficult to see him; but, if I could\nsee him, what name am I to give?\"\n\n\"You will go to him instantly,\" said the stranger, \"and you will tell\nhim that he is wanted by Captain Bruges.\"\n\nThe waiter was not long absent, and returning with an obsequious bow, he\ninvited the stranger to follow him to a private room, where he was\nalone only for a few seconds, for the door opened and he was joined by\nPerroni.\n\n\"Ah! my general,\" exclaimed the master of the coffee-house, and he\nkissed the stranger's hand. \"You received my telegram?\"\n\n\"I am here. Now what is your business?\"\n\n\"There is business, and great business, if you will do it; business for\nyou.\"\n\n\"Well, I am a soldier, and soldiering is my trade, and I do not much\ncare what I do in that way, provided it is not against the good cause.\nBut I must tell you at once, friend Perroni, I am not a man who will\ntake a leap in the dark. I must form my own staff, and I must have my\ncommissariat secure.\"\n\n\"My general, you will be master of your own terms. The Standing\nCommittee of the Holy Alliance of Peoples are sitting upstairs at this\nmoment. They were unanimous in sending for you. See them; judge for\nyourself; and, rest assured, you will be satisfied.\"\n\n\"I do not much like having to do with committees,\" said the general.\n\"However, let it be as you like--I will see them.\"\n\n\"I had better just announce your arrival,\" said Perroni. \"And will you\nnot take something, my general after your travel you must be wearied.\"\n\n\"A glass of sugar-and-water. You know, I am not easily tired. And, I\nagree with you, it is better to come to business at once: so prepare\nthem.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11\n\n\nThe Standing Committee of the Holy Alliance of Peoples all rose,\nalthough they were extreme republicans, when the general entered. Such\nis the magical influence of a man of action over men of the pen an the\ntongue. Had it been, instead of a successful military leader, an orator\nthat had inspired Europe, or a journalist who had rights of the human\nrace, the Standing Committee would have only seen men of their own\nkidney, who, having been favored with happier opportunities than\nthemselves, had reaped a harvest which, equally favored, they might here\nhave garnered.\n\n\"General,\" said Felix Drolin, the president, who was looked upon by the\nbrotherhood as a statesman, for he had been in his time, a member of a\nprovisional government, \"this seat is for you,\" and he pointed to one\non his right hand. \"You are ever welcome; and I hope you bring good\ntidings, and good fortune.\"\n\n\"I am glad to be among my friends, and I may say,\" looking around, \"my\ncomrades. I hope I may bring you better fortune than my tidings.\"\n\n\"But now they have left Rome,\" said the president, \"every day we expect\ngood news.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay! he has left Rome, but he has not left Rome with the door open.\nI hope it is not on such gossip you have sent for me. You have something\non hand. What is it?\"\n\n\"You shall hear it from the fountain-head,\" said the president, \"fresh\nfrom New York,\" and he pointed to an individual seated in the centre of\nthe table.\n\n\"Ah! Colonel Finucane,\" said the general, \"I have not forgotten James\nRiver. You did that well. What is the trick now?\"\n\nWhereupon a tall, lean man, with a decided brogue, but speaking through\nhis nose, rose from his seat and informed the general that the Irish\npeople were organized and ready to rise; that they had sent their\ndeputies to New York; all they wanted were arms and officers; that the\nAmerican brethren had agreed to supply them with both, and amply; and\nthat considerable subscriptions were raising for other purposes. What\nthey now required was a commander-in-chief equal to the occasion, and in\nwhom all would have confidence; and therefore they had telegraphed for\nthe general.\n\n\"I doubt not our friends over the water would send us plenty of rifles,\"\nsaid the general, \"if we could only manage to land them; and, I think, I\nknow men now in the States from whom I could form a good staff; but how\nabout the people of Ireland? What evidence have we that they will rise,\nif we land?\"\n\n\"The best,\" said the president. \"We have a head-centre here, Citizen\nDesmond, who will give you the most recent and the most authentic\nintelligence on that head.\"\n\n\"The whole country is organized,\" said the head-centre; \"we could put\nthree hundred thousand men in the field at any time in a fortnight. The\nmovement is not sectarian; it pervades all classes and all creeds. All\nthat we want are officers and arms.\"\n\n\"Hem!\" said the general; \"and as to your other supplies? Any scheme of\ncommissariat?\"\n\n\"There will be no lack of means,\" replied the head-centre. \"There is no\ncountry where so much money is hoarded as in Ireland. But, depend\nupon it, so far as the commissariat is concerned, the movement will be\nself-supporting.\"\n\n\"Well, we shall see,\" said, the general; \"I am sorry it is an Irish\naffair, though, to be sure, what else could it be? I am not fond of\nIrish affairs: whatever may be said, and however plausible things may\nlook, in an Irish business there is always a priest at the bottom of it.\nI hate priests. By-the-by, I was stopped on my way here by a cardinal\ngetting into his carriage. I thought I had burnt all those vehicles when\nI was at Rome with Garibaldi in '48. A cardinal in his carriage! I had\nno idea you permitted that sort of cattle in London.\"\n\n\"London is a roost for every bird,\" said Felix Drolin.\n\n\"Very few of the priests favor this movement,\" said Desmond.\n\n\"Then you have a great power against you,\" said the general, in\n\"addition to England.\"\n\n\"They are not exactly against; the bulk of them are too national for\nthat; but Rome does not sanction--you understand?\"\n\n\"I understand enough,\" said the general, \"to see that we must not act\nwith precipitation. An Irish business is a thing to be turned over\nseveral times.\"\n\n\"But yet,\" said a Pole, \"what hope for humanity except from the rising\nof an oppressed nationality? We have offered ourselves on the altar,\nand in vain! Greece is too small, and Roumania--though both of them\nare ready to do any thing; but they would be the mere tools of Russia.\nIreland alone remains, and she is at our feet.\"\n\n\"The peoples will never succeed until they have a fleet,\" said a German.\n\"Then you could land as many rifles as you like, or any thing else. To\nhave a fleet we rose against Denmark in my country, but we have been\nbetrayed. Nevertheless, Germany will yet be united, and she can only be\nunited as a republic. Then she will be the mistress of the seas.\"\n\n\"That is the mission of Italy,\" said Perroni. \"Italy--with the\ntraditions of Genoa, Venice, Pisa--Italy is plainly indicated as the\nfuture mistress of the seas.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said the German; \"the future mistress of the sees\nis the land of the Viking. It is the forests of the Baltic that will\nbuild the Best of the future. You have no timber in Italy.\"\n\n\"Timber is no longer wanted,\" said Perroni. \"Nor do I know of what will\nbe formed the fleets of the future. But the sovereignty of the seas\ndepends upon seamen, and the nautical genius of the Italians--\"\n\n\"Comrades,\" said the general, \"we have discussed to-night a great\nsubject. For my part I have travelled rather briskly, as you wished it.\nI should like to sleep on this affair.\"\n\n\"'Tis most reasonable,\" said the president. \"Our refreshment at council\nis very spare,\" he continued, and he pointed to a vase of water and some\nglasses ranged round it in the middle of the table; \"but we always drink\none toast, general, before we separate. It is to one whom you love,\nand whom you have served well. Fill glasses, brethren and now 'TO\nMARY-ANNE.'\"\n\nIf they had been inspired by the grape, nothing could be more animated\nand even excited than all their countenances suddenly became. The cheer\nmight have been heard in the coffee-room, as they expressed, in\nthe phrases of many languages, the never-failing and never-flagging\nenthusiasm invoked by the toast of their mistress.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12\n\n\n\"Did you read that paragraph, mamma?\" inquired Lady Corisande of the\nduchess, in a tone of some seriousness.\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"And what did you think of it?\"\n\n\"It filled me with so much amazement that I have hardly begun to think.\"\n\n\"And Bertram never gave a hint of such things!\"\n\n\"Let us believe they are quite untrue.\"\n\n\"I hope Bertram is in no danger,\" said his sister.\n\n\"Heaven forbid!\" exclaimed the mother, with unaffected alarm.\n\n\"I know not how it is,\" said Lady Corisande, \"but I frequently feel that\nsome great woe is hanging over our country.\"\n\n\"You must dismiss such thoughts, my child; they are fanciful.\"\n\n\"But they will come, and when least expected--frequently in church, but\nalso in the sunshine; and when I am riding too, when, once, every\nthing seemed gay. But now I often think of strife, and struggle, and\nwar--civil war: the stir of our cavalcade seems like the tramp of\ncavalry.\"\n\n\"You indulge your imagination too much, dear Corisande. When you return\nto London, and enter the world, these anxious thoughts will fly.\"\n\n\"Is it imagination? I should rather have doubted my being of an\nimaginative nature. It seems to me that I am rather literal. But I\ncannot help hearing and reading things, and observing things, and they\nfill me with disquietude. All seems doubt and change, when it would\nappear that we require both faith and firmness.\"\n\n\"The duke is not alarmed about affairs,\" said his wife.\n\n\"And, if all did their duty like papa, there might be less, or no\ncause,\" said Corisande. \"But, when I hear of young nobles, the natural\nleaders of the land, going over to the Roman Catholic Church, I confess\nI lose heart and patience. It seems so unpatriotic, so effeminate.\"\n\n\"It may not be true,\" said the duchess.\n\n\"It may not be true of him, but it is true of others,\" said Lady\nCorisande. \"And why should he escape? He is very young, rather\nfriendless, and surrounded by wily persons. I am disappointed about\nBertram too. He ought to have prevented this, if it be true. Bertram\nseemed to me to have such excellent principles, and so completely to\nfeel that he was born to maintain the great country which his ancestors\ncreated, that I indulged in dreams. I suppose you are right, mamma; I\nsuppose I am imaginative without knowing it; but I have, always thought,\nand hoped, that when the troubles came the country might, perhaps, rally\nround Bertram.\"\n\n\"I wish to see Bertram in Parliament,\" said the duchess. \"That will be\nthe best thing for him. The duke has some plans.\"\n\nThis conversation had been occasioned by a paragraph in the Morning\nPost, circulating a rumor that a young noble, obviously Lothair, on\nthe impending completion of his minority, was about to enter the Roman\nChurch. The duchess and her daughter were sitting in a chamber of their\nnorthern castle, and speculating on their return to London, which was to\ntake place after the Easter which had just arrived. It was an important\nsocial season for Corisande, for she was to be formally introduced into\nthe great world, and to be presented at court.\n\nIn the mean while, was there any truth in the report about Lothair?\n\nAfter their meeting at their lawyer's, a certain intimacy had occurred\nbetween the cardinal and his ward. They met again immediately and\nfrequently, and their mutual feelings were cordial. The manners of his\neminence were refined and affectionate; his conversational powers were\ndistinguished; there was not a subject on which his mind did not teem\nwith interesting suggestions; his easy knowledge seemed always ready and\nalways full; and whether it were art, or letters, or manners, or even\npolitical affairs, Lothair seemed to listen to one of the wisest, most\nenlightened, and most agreeable of men. There was only one subject\non which his eminence seemed scrupulous never to touch, and that was\nreligion; or so indirectly, that it was only when alone that Lothair\nfrequently found himself musing over the happy influence on the arts,\nand morals, and happiness of mankind--of the Church.\n\nIn due time, not too soon, but when he was attuned to the initiation,\nthe cardinal presented Lothair to Lady St. Jerome. The impassioned\neloquence of that lady germinated the seed which the cardinal had seemed\nso carelessly to scatter. She was a woman to inspire crusaders. Not that\nshe ever: condescended to vindicate her own particular faith, or spoke\nas if she were conscious that Lothair did not possess it. Assuming\nthat religion was true, for otherwise man would be in a more degraded\nposition than the beasts of the field, which are not aware of their own\nwretchedness, then religion should be the principal occupation of man,\nto which all other pursuits should be subservient. The doom of eternity,\nand the fortunes of life, cannot be placed in competition. Our days\nshould be pure, and holy, and heroic--full of noble thoughts and solemn\nsacrifice. Providence, in its wisdom, had decreed that the world should\nbe divided between the faithful and atheists; the latter even seemed\nto predominate. There was no doubt that, if they prevailed, all that\nelevated man would become extinct. It was a great trial; but happy\nwas the man who was privileged even to endure the awful test. It might\ndevelop the highest qualities and the most sublime conduct. If he were\nequal to the occasion, and could control and even subdue these sons of\nKorah, he would rank with Michael the Archangel.\n\nThis was the text on which frequent discourses were delivered to\nLothair, and to which he listened at first with eager, and soon with\nenraptured attention. The priestess was worthy of the shrine. Few\npersons were ever gifted with more natural eloquence: a command of\nlanguage, choice without being pedantic; beautiful hands that fluttered\nwith irresistible grace; flashing eyes and a voice of melody.\n\nLothair began to examine himself, and to ascertain whether he possessed\nthe necessary qualities, and was capable of sublime conduct. His natural\nmodesty and his strong religious feeling struggled together. He feared\nhe was not an archangel, and yet he longed to struggle with the powers\nof darkness.\n\nOne day he ventured to express to Miss Arundel a somewhat hopeful view\nof the future, but Miss Arundel shook her head.\n\n\"I do not agree with my aunt, at least as regards this country,\" said\nMiss Arundel; \"I think our sins are too great. We left His Church, and\nGod is now leaving us.\"\n\nLothair looked grave, but was silent.\n\nWeeks had passed since his introduction to the family of Lord St.\nJerome, and it was remarkable how large a portion of his subsequent time\nhad passed under that roof. At first there were few persons in town,\nand really of these Lothair knew none; and then the house in St. James's\nSquare was not only an interesting but it was an agreeable house. All\nLady St. Jerome's family connections were persons of much fashion, so\nthere was more variety and entertainment than sometimes are to be found\nunder a Roman Catholic roof. Lady St. Jerome was at home every evening\nbefore Easter. Few dames can venture successfully on so decided a step;\nbut her saloons were always attended, and by \"nice people.\" Occasionally\nthe cardinal stepped in, and, to a certain degree, the saloon was the\nrendezvous of the Catholic party; but it was also generally social and\ndistinguished. Many bright dames and damsels, and many influential men,\nwere there, who little deemed that deep and daring thoughts were there\nmasked by many a gracious countenance. The social atmosphere infinitely\npleased Lothair. The mixture of solemn duty and graceful diversion, high\npurposes and charming manners, seemed to realize some youthful dreams of\nelegant existence. All, too, was enhanced by the historic character of\nthe roof and by the recollection that their mutual ancestors, as Clare\nArundel more than once intimated to him, had created England. Having had\nso many pleasant dinners in St. James's Square, and spent there so\nmany evening hours, it was not wonderful that Lothair had accepted an\ninvitation from Lord St. Jerome to pass Easter at his country-seat.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13\n\n\nVauxe, the seat of the St. Jeromes, was the finest specimen of the old\nEnglish residence extant. It was the perfection of the style, which had\ngradually arisen after the Wars of the Roses had alike destroyed all\nthe castles and the purpose of those stern erections. People said Vauxe\nlooked like a college: the truth is, colleges looked like Vauxe, for,\nwhen those fair and civil buildings rose, the wise and liberal spirits\nwho endowed them intended that they should resemble, as much as\npossible, the residence of a great noble.\n\nThere were two quadrangles at Vauxe of gray-stone; the outer one of\nlarger dimensions and much covered with ivy; the inner one not so\nextensive, but more ornate, with a lofty tower, a hall, and a chapel.\nThe house was full of galleries, and they were full of portraits. Indeed\nthere was scarcely a chamber in this vast edifice of which the walls\nwere not breathing with English history in this interesting form.\nSometimes more ideal art asserted a triumphant claim--transcendental\nHoly Families, seraphic saints, and gorgeous scenes by Tintoret and Paul\nof Verona.\n\nThe furniture of the house seemed never to have been changed. It was\nvery old, somewhat scanty, but very rich--tapestry and velvet hangings,\nmarvellous cabinets, and crystal girandoles. Here and there a group of\nancient plate; ewers and flagons and tall salt-cellars, a foot high and\nrichly chiselled; sometimes a state bed shadowed with a huge pomp of\nstiff brocade and borne by silver poles.\n\nVauxe stood in a large park, studded with stately trees; here and there\nan avenue of Spanish chestnuts or a grove of oaks; sometimes a gorsy\ndell, and sometimes a so great spread of antlered fern, taller than the\ntallest man.\n\nIt was only twenty miles from town, and Lord St. Jerome drove Lothair\ndown; the last ten miles through a pretty land, which, at the\nright season, would have been bright with orchards, oak-woods, and\nhop-gardens. Lord St. Jerome loved horses, and was an eminent whip. He\nhad driven four-in-hand when a boy, and he went on driving four-in-hand;\nnot because it was the fashion, but because he loved it. Toward the\nclose of Lent, Lady St. Jerome and Clare Arundel had been at a convent\nin retreat, but they always passed Holy Week at home, and they were to\nwelcome Lord St. Jerome again at Vauxe.\n\nThe day was bright, the mode of movement exhilarating, all the\nanticipated incidents delightful, and Lothair felt the happiness of\nhealth and youth.\n\n\"There is Vauxe,\" said Lord St. Jerome, in a tone of proud humility, as\na turn in the road first displayed the stately pile.\n\n\"How beautiful!\" said Lothair. \"Ah! our ancestors understood the\ncountry.\"\n\n\"I used to think when I was a boy,\" said Lord St. Jerome, \"that I lived\nin the prettiest village in the world; but these railroads have\nso changed every thing that Vauxe seems to me now only a second\ntown-house.\"\n\nThe ladies were in a garden, where they were consulting with the\ngardener and Father Coleman about the shape of some new beds, for the\ncritical hour of filling them was approaching. The gardener, like all\nhead-gardeners, was opinionated. Living always at Vauxe, he had come to\nbelieve that the gardens belonged to him, and that the family were only\noccasional visitors; and he treated them accordingly. The lively and\nimpetuous Lady St. Jerome had a thousand bright fancies, but her morose\nattendant never indulged them. She used to deplore his tyranny with\npiteous playfulness. \"I suppose,\" she would say, \"it is useless to\nresist, for I observe 'tis the same everywhere. Lady Roehampton says she\nnever has her way with her gardens. It is no use speaking to Lord St.\nJerome, for, though he is afraid of nothing else, I am sure he is afraid\nof Hawkins.\"\n\nThe only way that Lady St. Jerome could manage Hawkins was through\nFather Coleman. Father Coleman, who knew every thing, knew a great deal\nabout gardens; from the days of Le Notre to those of the fine gentlemen\nwho now travel about, and when disengaged deign to give us advice.\n\nFather Coleman had only just entered middle-age, was imperturbable and\nmild in his manner. He passed his life very much at Vauxe, and imparted\na great deal of knowledge to Mr. Hawkins without apparently being\nconscious of so doing. At the bottom of his mind, Mr. Hawkins felt\nassured that he had gained several distinguished prizes, mainly through\nthe hints and guidance of Father Coleman; and thus, though on the\nsurface, a little surly, he was ruled by Father Coleman, under the\ncombined influence of self-interest and superior knowledge.\n\n\"You find us in a garden without flowers,\" said Lady St. Jerome; \"but\nthe sun, I think, alway loves these golden yews.\"\n\n\"These are for you, dear uncle,\" said Clare Arundel, as she gave him a\nrich cluster of violets. \"Just now the woods are more fragrant than the\ngardens, and these are the produce of our morning walk. I could have\nbrought you some primroses, but I do not like to mix violets with any\nthing.\"\n\n\"They say primroses make a capital salad,\" said Lord St. Jerome.\n\n\"Barbarian!\" exclaimed Lady St. Jerome. \"I see you want luncheon; it\nmust, be ready;\" and she took Lothair's arm. \"I will show you a portrait\nof one of your ancestors,\" she said; \"he married an Arundel.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14\n\n\n\"Now, you know,\" said Lady St. Jerome to Lothair in a hushed voice, as\nthey sat together in the evening, \"you are to be quite free here; to do\nexactly what you like; and we shall follow our ways. If you like to have\na clergyman of your own Church visit you while you are with us, pray say\nso without the slightest scruple. We have an excellent gentleman in this\nparish; he often dines here; and I am sure he would be most happy to\nattend you. I know that Holy Week is not wholly disregarded by some of\nthe Anglicans.\"\n\n\"It is the anniversary of the greatest event of time,\" said Lothair;\n\"and I should be sorry if any of my Church did not entirely regard it,\nthough they may show that regard in a way different from your own.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" murmured Lady St. Jerome; \"there should be no difference\nbetween our Churches, if things were only properly understood. I would\naccept all who really bow to the name of Christ; they will come to the\nChurch at last; they must. It is the atheists alone, I fear, who are now\ncarrying every thing before them, and against whom there is no comfort,\nexcept the rock of St. Peter.\"\n\nMiss Arundel crossed the room, whispered something to her aunt, and\ntouched her forehead with her lips, and then left the apartment.\n\n\"We must soon separate, I fear,\" said Lady St. Jerome; \"we have an\noffice to-night of great moment; the Tenebrae commence to-night. You\nhave, I think, nothing like it; but you have services throughout this\nweek.\"\n\n\"I am sorry to say I have not attended them,\" said Lothair. \"I did\nat Oxford; but I don't know how it is, but in London there seems no\nreligion. And yet, as you sometimes say, religion is the great business\nof life; I sometimes begin to think the only business.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Lady St. Jerome, with much interest, \"if you believe\nthat you are safe. I wish you had a clergyman near you while you are\nhere. See Mr. Claughton, if you like; I would; and, if you do not, there\nis Father Coleman. I cannot convey to you how satisfactory conversation\nis with him on religious matters. He is the holiest of men, and yet he\nis a man of the world; he will not invite you into any controversies. He\nwill speak with you only on points on which we agree. You know there are\nmany points on which we agree?\"\n\n\"Happily,\" said Lothair. \"And now about the office to-night: tell me\nabout these Tenebrae. Is there any thing in the Tenebrae why I ought not\nto be present?\"\n\n\"No reason whatever; not a dogma which you do not believe; not a\nceremony of which you cannot approve. There are Psalms, at the end of\nwhich a light on the altar is extinguished. There is the Song of Moses,\nthe Canticle of Zachary, the Miserere--which is the 50th Psalm you read\nand chant regularly in your church--the Lord's Prayer in silence; and\nthen all is darkness and distress--what the Church was when our Lord\nsuffered, what the whole world is now except His Church.\"\n\n\"If you will permit me,\" said Lothair, \"I will accompany you to the\nTenebrae.\"\n\nAlthough the chapel at Vauxe was, of course, a private chapel, it was\nopen to the surrounding public, who eagerly availed themselves of a\npermission alike politic and gracious.\n\nNor was that remarkable. Manifold art had combined to create this\nexquisite temple, and to guide all its ministrations. But to-night\nit was not the radiant altar and the splendor of stately priests,\nthe processions and the incense, the divine choir and the celestial\nharmonies resounding lingering in arched roofs, that attracted many\na neighbor. The altar was desolate, the choir was dumb; and while the\nservices proceeded in hushed tones of subdued sorrow, and sometimes even\nof suppressed anguish, gradually, with each psalm and canticle, a light\nof the altar was extinguished, till at length the Miserere was muttered,\nand all became darkness. A sound as of a distant and rising wind was\nheard, and a crash, as it were the fall of trees in a storm. The earth\nis covered with darkness, and the veil of the temple is rent. But just\nat this moment of extreme woe, when all human voices are silent,\nand when it is forbidden even to breathe \"Amen\"--when every thing is\nsymbolical of the confusion and despair of the Church at the loss of her\nexpiring Lord--a priest brings forth a concealed light of silvery\nflame from a corner of the altar. This is the light of the world, and\nannounced the resurrection, and then all rise up and depart in silence.\n\nAs Lothair rose, Miss Arundel passed him with streaming eyes.\n\n\"There is nothing in this holy office,\" said Father Coleman to Lothair,\n\"to which every real Christian might not give his assent.\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Lothair, with great decision.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15\n\n\nThere were Tenebrae on the following days, Maundy Thursday and Good\nFriday, and Lothair was present on both occasions.\n\n\"There is also a great office on Friday,\" said Father Coleman to\nLothair, \"which perhaps you would not like to attend--the mass of the\npre-sanctified. We bring back the blessed sacrament to the desolate\naltar, and unveil the cross. It is one of our highest ceremonies,\nthe adoration of the cross, which the Protestants persist in calling\nidolatry, though I presume they will give us leave to know the meaning\nof our own words and actions, and hope they will believe us when we tell\nthem that our genuflexions and kissing of the cross are no more than\nexterior expressions of that love which we bear in our hearts to Jesus\ncrucified; and that the words adoration and adore, as applied to\nthe cross, only signify that respect and veneration due to things\nimmediately relating to God and His service.\"\n\n\"I see no idolatry in it,\" said Lothair, musingly.\n\n\"No impartial person could,\" rejoined Father Coleman; \"but unfortunately\nall these prejudices were imbibed when the world was not so well\ninformed as at present. A good deal of mischief has been done, too, by\nthe Protestant versions of the Holy Scriptures; made in a hurry, and by\nmen imperfectly acquainted with the Eastern tongues, and quite ignorant\nof Eastern manners. All the accumulated research and investigation of\nmodern times have only illustrated and justified the offices of the\nChurch.\"\n\n\"That is very interesting,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"Now, this question of idolatry,\" said Father Coleman, \"that is a\nfertile subject of misconception. The house of Israel was raised up\nto destroy idolatry because idolatry thou meant dark images of Moloch\nopening their arms by machinery, and flinging the beauteous first-born\nof the land into their huge forms, which were furnaces of fire; or\nAshtaroth, throned in moonlit groves, and surrounded by orgies of\nineffable demoralization. It required the declared will of God to redeem\nman from such fatal iniquity, which would have sapped the human race.\nBut to confound such deeds with the commemoration of God's saints, who\nare only pictured because their lives are perpetual incentives to purity\nand holiness, and to declare that the Queen of Heaven and the Mother of\nGod should be to human feeling only as a sister of charity or a gleaner\nin the fields, is to abuse reason and to outrage the heart.\"\n\n\"We live in dark times,\" said Lothair, with an air of distress.\n\n\"Not darker than before the deluge,\" exclaimed Father Coleman; \"not\ndarker than before the nativity; not darker even than when the saints\nbecame martyrs. There is a Pharos in the world, and, its light will\nnever be extinguished, however black the clouds and wild the waves. Man\nis on his trial now, not the Church; but in the service of the Church\nhis highest energies may be developed, and his noblest qualities\nproved.\"\n\nLothair seemed plunged in thought, and Father Coleman glided away as\nLady St. Jerome entered the gallery, shawled and bonneted, accompanied\nby another priest, Monsignore Catesby.\n\nCatesby was a youthful member of an ancient English house, which for\nmany generations had without a murmur, rather in a spirit of triumph,\nmade every worldly sacrifice for the Church and court of Rome. For that\ncause they had forfeited their lives, broad estates, and all the\nhonors of a lofty station in their own land. Reginald Catesby, with\nconsiderable abilities, trained with consummate skill, inherited\ntheir determined will, and the traditionary beauty of their form and\ncountenance. His manners were winning, and, he was as well informed in\nthe ways of the world as he was in the works of the great casuists.\n\n\"My lord has ordered the charbanc, and is going to drive us all to\nChart, where we will lunch,\" said Lady St. Jerome; \"'tis a curious\nplace, and was planted, only seventy years ago, by my lord's\ngrandfather, entirely with spruce-firs, but with so much care and skill,\ngiving each plant and tree ample distance, that they have risen to the\nnoblest proportions, with all their green branches far-spreading on the\nground like huge fans.\"\n\nIt was only a drive of three or four miles entirely in the park. This\nwas a district that had been added to the ancient enclosure--a striking\nscene. It was a forest of firs, but quite unlike such as might be met\nwith in the north of Europe or of America. Every tree was perfect--huge\nand complete, and full of massy grace. Nothing else was permitted to\ngrow there except juniper, of which there were abounding and wondrous\ngroups, green and spiral; the whole contrasting with the tall brown\nfern, of which there were quantities about, cut for the deer.\n\nThe turf was dry and mossy, and the air pleasant. It was a balmy\nday. They sat down by the great trees, the servants opened the\nluncheon-baskets, which were a present from Balmoral. Lady St. Jerome\nwas seldom seen to greater advantage than distributing her viands under\nsuch circumstances. Never was such gay and graceful hospitality.\nLothair was quite fascinated as she playfully thrust a paper of\nlobster-sandwiches into his hand, and enjoined Monsignore Catesby to\nfill his tumbler with Chablis.\n\n\"I wish Father Coleman were here,\" said Lothair to Miss Arundel.\n\n\"Why?\" said Miss Arundel.\n\n\"Because we were in the midst of a very interesting conversation on\nidolatry and on worship in groves, when Lady St. Jerome summoned us to\nour drive. This seems a grove where one might worship.\"\n\n\"Father Coleman ought to be at Rome,\" said Miss Arundel. \"He was to have\npassed Holy Week there. I know not why he changed his plans.\"\n\n\"Are you angry with him for it?\"\n\n\"No, not angry, but surprised; surprised that any one might be at Rome,\nand yet be absent from it.\"\n\n\"You like Rome?\"\n\n\"I have never been there. It is the wish of my life.\"\n\n\"May I say to you what you said to me just now--why?\"\n\n\"Naturally, because I would wish to witness the ceremonies of the Church\nin their most perfect form.\"\n\n\"But they are fulfilled in this country, I have heard, with much\nsplendor and precision.\"\n\nMiss Arundel shook her head.\n\n\"Oh! no,\" she said; \"in this country we are only just emerging from the\ncatacombs. If the ceremonies of the Church were adequately fulfilled in\nEngland, we should hear very little of English infidelity.\"\n\n\"That is saying a great deal,\" observed Lothair, inquiringly.\n\n\"Had I that command of wealth of which we hear so much in the present\nday, and with which the possessors seem to know so little what to do, I\nwould purchase some of those squalid streets in Westminster, which are\nthe shame of the metropolis, and clear a great space and build a real\ncathedral, where the worship of heaven should be perpetually conducted\nin the full spirit of the ordinances of the Church. I believe, were this\ndone, even this country might be saved.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16\n\n\nLothair began to meditate on two great ideas--the reconciliation of\nChristendom, and the influence of architecture on religion. If the\ndifferences between the Roman and Anglican Churches, and between the\npapacy and Protestantism generally arose, as Father Coleman assured\nhim, and seemed to prove, in mere misconception, reconciliation, though\ndifficult, did not seem impossible, and appeared to be one of the most\nefficient modes of defeating the atheists. It was a result which, of\ncourse, mainly depended on the authority of Reason; but the power of\nthe imagination might also be enlisted in the good cause through the\ninfluence of the fine arts, of which the great mission is to excite,\nand at the same time elevate, the feelings of the human family. Lothair\nfound himself frequently in a reverie over Miss Arundel's ideal fane;\nand, feeling that he had the power of buying up a district in forlorn\nWestminster, and raising there a temple to the living God, which might\ninfluence the future welfare of millions, and even effect the salvation\nof his country, he began to ask himself whether he could incur the\nresponsibility of shrinking from the fulfilment of this great duty.\n\nLothair could not have a better adviser on the subject of the influence\nof architecture on religion than Monsignore Catesby. Monsignore Catesby\nhad been a pupil of Pugin; his knowledge of ecclesiastical architecture\nwas only equalled by his exquisite taste. To hear him expound the\nmysteries of symbolical art, and expatiate on the hidden revelations\nof its beauteous forms, reached even to ecstasy. Lothair hung upon his\naccents like a neophyte. Conferences with Father Coleman on those points\nof faith on which they did not differ, followed up by desultory remarks\non those points of faith on which they ought not to differ--critical\ndiscussions with Monsignore Catesby on cathedrals, their forms, their\npurposes, and the instances in several countries in which those forms\nwere most perfect and those purposes best secured--occupied a good deal\nof time; and yet these engaging pursuits were secondary in real emotion\nto his frequent conversations with Miss Arundel in whose society every\nday he took a strange and deeper interest.\n\nShe did not extend to him that ready sympathy which was supplied by\nthe two priests. On the contrary, when he was apt to indulge in those\nspeculations which they always encouraged, and rewarded by adroit\napplause, she was often silent, throwing on him only the scrutiny\nof those violet yes, whose glance was rather fascinating than apt to\ncaptivate. And yet he was irresistibly drawn to her, and, once recalling\nthe portrait in the gallery, he ventured to murmur that they were\nkinsfolk.\n\n\"Oh! I have no kin, no country,\" said Miss Arundel. \"These are not times\nfor kin and country. I have given up all these things for my Master!\"\n\n\"But are our times so trying as that?\" inquired Lothair.\n\n\"They are times for new crusades,\" said Miss Arundel, with energy,\n\"though it may be of a different character from the old. If I were a\nman, I would draw my sword for Christ. There are as great deeds to\nbe done as the siege of Ascalon, or even as the freeing of the Holy\nSepulchre.\"\n\nIn the midst of a profound discussion with Father Coleman on Mariolatry,\nLothair, rapt in reverie, suddenly introduced the subject of Miss\nArundel. \"I wonder what will be her lot?\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"It seems to, me to be settled,\" said Father Coleman. \"She will be the\nbride of the Church.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" and he started, and even changed color.\n\n\"She deems it her vocation,\" said Father Coleman.\n\n\"And yet, with such gifts, to be immured in a convent,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"That would not necessarily follow,\" replied Father Coleman. \"Miss\nArundel may occupy a position in which she may exercise much influence\nfor the great cause which absorbs her being.\"\n\n\"There is a divine energy about her,\" said Lothair, almost speaking to\nhimself. \"It could not have been given for little ends.\"\n\n\"If Miss Arundel could meet with a spirit as and as energetic as her\nown,\" said Father. Coleman, \"Her fate might be different. She has no\nthoughts which are not great, and no purposes which are not sublime. But\nfor the companion of her life she would require no less than a Godfrey\nde Bouillon.\"\n\nLothair began to find the time pass very rapidly at Vauxe. Easter week\nhad nearly vanished; Vauxe had been gay during the last few days. Every\nday some visitors came down from London; sometimes they returned in the\nevening; sometimes they passed the night at Vauxe, and returned to town\nin the morning with large bouquets. Lothair felt it was time for him to\ninterfere, and he broke his intention to Lady St. Jerome; but Lady St.\nJerome would not hear of it. So he muttered something about business.\n\n\"Exactly,\" she said; \"everybody has business, and I dare say you have\na great deal. But Vauxe is exactly the place for persons who have\nbusiness. You go up to town by an early train, and then you return\nexactly in time for dinner, and bring us all the news from the clubs.\"\n\nLothair was beginning to say something, but Lady St. Jerome, who, when\nnecessary, had the rare art of not listening without offending the\nspeaker, told him that they did not intend themselves to return to town\nfor a week or so, and that she knew Lord St. Jerome would be greatly\nannoyed if Lothair did not remain.\n\nLothair remained; and he went up to town one or two mornings to transact\nbusiness; that is to say, to see a celebrated architect and to order\nplans for a cathedral, in which all the purposes of those sublime and\nexquisite structures were to be realized. The drawings would take a\nconsiderable time to prepare, and these must be deeply considered. So\nLothair became quite domiciliated at Vauxe: he went up to town in the\nmorning, and returned, as it were, to his home; everybody delighted to\nwelcome him, and yet he seemed not expected. His rooms were called after\nhis name; and the household treated him as one of the family.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17\n\n\nA few days before Lothair's visit was to terminate, the cardinal and\nMonsignore Berwick arrived at Vauxe. His eminence was received with much\nceremony; the marshalled household, ranged in lines, fell on their\nknees at his approach, and Lady St. Jerome, Miss Arundel, and some\nother ladies, scarcely less choice and fair, with the lowest obeisance,\ntouched, with their honored lips, his princely hand.\n\nThe monsignore had made another visit to Paris on his intended return\nto Rome, but, in consequence of some secret intelligence which he had\nacquired in the French capital, had thought fit to return to England\nto consult with the cardinal. There seemed to be no doubt that the\nrevolutionary party in Italy, assured by the withdrawal of the French\ntroops from Rome, were again stirring. There seemed also little doubt\nthat London was the centre of preparation, though the project and the\nprojectors were involved in much, mystery. \"They want money,\" said\nthe monsignore; \"that we know, and that is now our best chance. The\nAspromonte expedition drained their private resources; and as for\nfurther aid, that is out of the question; the galantuomo is bankrupt.\nBut the atheists are desperate, and we must prepare for events.\"\n\nOn the morning after their arrival, the cardinal invited Lothair to a\nstroll in the park. \"There is the feeling of spring this morning,\" said\nhis eminence, \"though scarcely yet its vision.\" It was truly a day of\nbalm, and sweetness, and quickening life; a delicate mist hung about the\nhuge trees and the masses of more distant woods, and seemed to clothe\nthem with that fulness of foliage which was not yet theirs. The cardinal\ndiscoursed much on forest-trees, and, happily. He recommended Lothair to\nread Evelyn's \"Sylva.\" Mr. Evelyn had a most accomplished mind; indeed,\na character in every respect that approached perfection. He was also a\nmost religious man.\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Lothair, \"how any man who is religious can think of any\nthing but religion.\"\n\n\"True,\" said the cardinal, and looking at him earnestly, \"most true. But\nall things that are good and beautiful make us more religious. They tend\nto the development of the religious principle in us, which is our divine\nnature. And, my dear young friend,\" and here his eminence put his arm\neasily and affectionately into that of Lothair, \"it is a most happy\nthing for you, that you live so much with a really religious family. It\nis a great boon for a young man, and a rare one.\"\n\n\"I feel it so,\" said Lothair, his face kindling.\n\n\"Ah!\" said the cardinal, \"when we remember that this country once\nconsisted only of such families!\" And then, with a sigh, and as if\nspeaking to himself, \"And they made it so great and so beautiful!\"\n\n\"It is still great and beautiful,\" said Lothair, but rather in a tone of\ninquiry than decision.\n\n\"But the cause of its greatness and its beauty no longer exists. It\nbecame great and beautiful because it believed in God.\"\n\n\"But faith is not extinct?\" said Lothair.\n\n\"It exists in the Church,\" replied the cardinal, with decision. \"All\nwithout that pale is practical atheism.\"\n\n\"It seems to me that a sense of duty is natural to man,\" said Lothair,\n\"and that there can be no satisfaction in life without attempting to\nfulfil it.\"\n\n\"Noble words, my dear young friend; noble and true. And the highest\nduty of man, especially in this age, is to vindicate the principles of\nreligion, without which the world must soon become a scene of universal\ndesolation.\"\n\n\"I wonder if England will ever again be a religious country?\" said\nLothair, musingly.\n\n\"I pray for that daily,\" said the cardinal; and he invited his companion\nto seat himself on the trunk of an oak that had been lying there\nsince the autumn fall. A slight hectic flame played over the pale and\nattenuated countenance of the cardinal; he seemed for a moment in deep\nthought; and then, in a voice distinct yet somewhat hushed, and at first\nrather faltering, he said: \"I know not a grander, or a nobler career,\nfor a young man of talents and position in this age, than to be the\nchampion and asserter of Divine truth. It is not probable that there\ncould be another conqueror in out time. The world is wearied of\nstatesmen; whom democracy has degraded into politicians, and of orators\nwho have become what they call debaters. I do not believe there could\nbe another Dante, even another Milton. The world is devoted to physical\nscience, because it believes these discoveries will increase its\ncapacity of luxury and self-indulgence. But the pursuit of science leads\nonly to the insoluble. When we arrive at that barren term, the Divine\nvoice summons man, as it summoned Samuel; all the poetry and passion and\nsentiment of human nature are taking refuge in religion; and he, whose\ndeeds and words most nobly represent Divine thoughts, will be the man of\nthis century.\"\n\n\"But who could be equal to such a task?\" murmured Lothair.\n\n\"Yourself,\" exclaimed the cardinal, and he threw his glittering eye upon\nhis companion. \"Any one with the necessary gifts, who had implicit faith\nin the Divine purpose.\"\n\n\"But the Church is perplexed; it is ambiguous, contradictory.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said the cardinal; \"not the Church of Christ; it is never\nperplexed, never ambiguous, never contradictory. Why should it be? How\ncould it be? The Divine persons are ever with it, strengthening and\nguiding it with perpetual miracles. Perplexed churches are churches made\nby Act of Parliament, not by God.\"\n\nLothair seemed to start, and looked at his guardian with a scrutinizing\nglance. And then he said, but not without hesitation, \"I experience at\ntimes great despondency.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" replied the cardinal. \"Every man must be despondent who is\nnot a Christian.\"\n\n\"But I am a Christian,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"A Christian estranged,\" said the cardinal; \"a Christian without the\nconsolations of Christianity.\"\n\n\"There is something in that,\" said Lothair. \"I require the consolations\nof Christianity, and yet I feel I have them not. Why is this?\"\n\n\"Because what you call your religion is a thing apart from your life,\nand it ought to be your life. Religion should be the rule of life, not\na casual incident of it. There is not a duty of existence, not a joy\nor sorrow which the services of the Church do not assert, or with which\nthey do not sympathize. Tell me, now; you have, I was glad to hear,\nattended the services of the Church of late, since you have been under\nthis admirable roof. Have you not then found some consolation?\"\n\n\"Yes; without doubt I have been often solaced.\" And Lothair sighed.\n\n\"What the soul is to man, the Church is to the world,\" said the\ncardinal. \"It is the link between us and the Divine nature. It came\nfrom heaven complete; it has never changed, and it can never alter. Its\nceremonies are types of celestial truths; its services are suited to all\nthe moods of man; they strengthen him in his wisdom and his purity, and\ncontrol and save him in the hour of passion and temptation. Taken as\na whole, with all its ministrations, its orders, its offices, and the\ndivine splendor of its ritual, it secures us on earth some adumbration\nof that ineffable glory which awaits the faithful in heaven, where the\nblessed Mother of God and ten thousand saints perpetually guard over no\nwith Divine intercession.\"\n\n\"I was not taught these things in my boyhood,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"And you might reproach me, and reasonably, as your guardian, for my\nneglect,\" said the cardinal. \"But my power was very limited, and, when\nmy duties commenced, you must remember that I was myself estranged from\nthe Church, I was myself a Parliamentary Christian, till despondency and\nstudy and ceaseless thought and prayer, and the Divine will, brought\nme to light and rest. But I at least saved you from a Presbyterian\nuniversity; I at least secured Oxford for you; and I can assure you, of\nmy many struggles, that was not the least.\"\n\n\"It gave the turn to my mind,\" said Lothair, \"and I am grateful to you\nfor it. What it will all end in, God only knows.\"\n\n\"It will end in His glory and in yours,\" said the cardinal. \"I have\nspoken, perhaps, too much and too freely, but you greatly interest me,\nnot merely because you are my charge, and the son of my beloved friend,\nbut because I perceive in you great qualities--qualities so great,\"\ncontinued the cardinal with earnestness, \"that properly guided, they may\nconsiderably affect the history of this country, and perhaps even have a\nwider range.\"\n\nLothair shook his head.\n\n\"Well, well,\" continued the cardinal in a lighter tone, \"we will pursue\nour ramble. At any rate, I am not wrong in this, that you have no\nobjection to join in my daily prayer for the conversion of this kingdom\nto--religious truth,\" his eminence added after a pause.\n\n\"Yes religious truth,\" said Lothair, \"we must all pray for that.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 18\n\n\nLothair returned to town excited and agitated. He felt that he was on\nthe eve of some great event in his existence, but its precise character\nwas not defined. One conclusion, however, was indubitable: life must\nbe religion; when we consider what is at stake, and that our eternal\nwelfare depends on our due preparation for the future, it was folly to\nspare a single hour from the consideration of the best means to secure\nour readiness. Such a subject does not admit of half measures or of\nhalting opinions. It seemed to Lothair that nothing could interest him\nin life that was not symbolical of divine truths and an adumbration of\nthe celestial hereafter.\n\nCould truth have descended from heaven ever to be distorted, to be\ncorrupted, misapprehended, misunderstood? Impossible! Such a belief\nwould confound and contradict all the attributes of the All-wise and the\nAll-mighty. There must be truth on earth now as fresh and complete is it\nwas at Bethlehem. And how could it be preserved but by the influence\nof the Paraclete acting on an ordained class? On this head his tutor at\nOxford had fortified him; by a conviction of the Apostolical succession\nof the English bishops, which no Act of Parliament could alter or\naffect. But Lothair was haunted by a feeling that the relations of his\nCommunion with the Blessed Virgin were not satisfactory. They could\nnot content either his heart or his intellect. Was it becoming that a\nChristian should live as regards the hallowed Mother of his God in a\ncondition of harsh estrangement? What mediatorial influence more awfully\nappropriate than the consecrated agent of the mighty mystery? Nor could\nhe, even in his early days, accept without a scruple the frigid system\nthat would class the holy actors in the divine drama of the Redemption\nas mere units in the categories of vanished generations. Human beings\nwho had been in personal relation with the Godhead must be different\nfrom other human beings. There must be some transcendent quality in\ntheir lives and careers, in their very organization, which marks them\nout from all secular heroes. What was Alexander the Great, or even Caius\nJulius, compared with that apostle whom Jesus loved?\n\nRestless and disquieted, Lothair paced the long and lofty rooms which\nhad been secured for him in a London hotel which rivalled the colossal\nconvenience of Paris and the American cities. Their tawdry ornaments\nand their terrible new furniture would not do after the galleries and\nportraits of Vauxe. Lothair sighed.\n\nWhy did that visit ever end? Why did the world consist of any thing else\nbut Tudor palaces in ferny parks, or time be other than a perpetual Holy\nWeek? He never sighed at Vauxe. Why? He supposed it was because their\nreligion was his life, and here--and he looked around him with a\nshudder. The cardinal was right: it was a most happy thing for him to be\nliving so much with so truly a religious family.\n\nThe door opened, and servants came in bearing a large and magnificent\nportfolio. It was of morocco and of prelatial purple with broad bands of\ngold and alternate ornaments of a cross and a coronet. A servant handed\nto Lothair a letter, which enclosed the key that opened its lock. The\nportfolio contained the plans and drawings of the cathedral.\n\nLothair was lost in admiration of these designs and their execution. But\nafter the first fever of investigation was over, he required sympathy\nand also information. In a truly religious family there would always be\na Father Coleman or a Monsignore Catesby to guide and to instruct. But a\nProtestant, if he wants aid or advice on any matter, can only go to his\nsolicitor. But as he proceeded in his researches he sensibly felt\nthat the business was one above even an oratorian or a monsignore. It\nrequired a finer and a more intimate sympathy; a taste at the same\ntime more inspired and more inspiring; some one who blended with divine\nconvictions the graceful energy of human feeling, and who would not\nonly animate him to effort but fascinate him to its fulfilment. The\ncounsellor he required was Miss Arundel.\n\nLothair had quitted Vauxe one week, and it seemed to him a year. During\nthe first four-and-twenty hours he felt like a child who had returned to\nschool, and, the day after, like a man on a desert island. Various\nother forms of misery and misfortune were suggested by his succeeding\nexperience. Town brought no distractions to him; he knew very few\npeople, and these be had not yet encountered; he had once ventured to\nWhite's, but found only a group of gray-beaded men, who evidently did\nnot know him, and who seemed to scan him with cynical nonchalance. These\nwere not the golden youth whom he had been assured by Bertram would\ngreet him; so, after reading a newspaper for a moment upside downward,\nhe got away. But he had no harbor of refuge, and was obliged to ride\ndown to Richmond and dine alone, and meditate on symbols and celestial\nadumbrations. Every day he felt how inferior was this existence to that\nof a life in a truly religious family.\n\nBut, of all the members of the family to which his memory recurred with\nsuch unflagging interest, none more frequently engaged his thoughts than\nMiss Arundel. Her conversation, which stimulated his intelligence while\nit rather piqued his self-love, exercised a great influence over him,\nand he had omitted no opportunity of enjoying her society. That society\nand its animating power he sadly missed; and now that he had before him\nthe very drawings about which they had frequently talked, and she was\nnot by his side to suggest and sympathize and criticism and praise, he\nfelt unusually depressed.\n\nLothair corresponded with Lady St. Jerome, and was aware of her intended\nmovements. But the return the family to London had been somewhat\ndelayed. When this disappointment was first made known to him, his\nimpulse was to ride down to Vauxe; but the tact in which he was not\ndeficient assured him that he ought not to reappear on a stage where he\nhad already figured for perhaps too considerable a time, and so another\nweek had to be passed, softened, however, by visits from the father of\nthe oratory and the chamberlain of his holiness, who came to look after\nLothair with much friendliness, and with whom it was consolatory and\neven delightful for him to converse on sacred art, still holier things,\nand also Miss Arundel.\n\nAt length, though it seemed impossible, this second week elapsed, and\nto-morrow Lothair was to lunch with Lady St. Jerome in St. James's\nSquare, and to meet all his friends. He thought of it all day, and he\npassed a restless night. He took an early canter to rally his energies,\nand his fancy was active in the splendor of the spring. The chestnuts\nwere in silver bloom, and the pink May had flushed the thorns, and banks\nof sloping turf were radiant with plots of gorgeous flowers. The waters\nglittered in the sun, and the air was fragrant with that spell which\nonly can be found in metropolitan mignonette. It was the hour and the\nseason when heroic youth comes to great decisions, achieves exploits, or\nperpetrates scrapes.\n\nNothing could be more cordial, nothing more winning, than the reception\nof Lothair by Lady St. Jerome. She did not conceal her joy at their\nbeing again together. Even Miss Arundel, though still calm, even a\nlittle demure, seemed glad to see him: her eyes looked kind and pleased,\nand she gave him her hand with graceful heartiness. It was the sacred\nhour of two when Lothair arrived, and they were summoned to luncheon\nalmost immediately. Then they were not alone; Lord St. Jerome was not\nthere, but the priests were present and some others. Lothair, however,\nsat next to Miss Arundel.\n\n\"I have been thinking of you very often since I left Vauxe,\" said\nLothair to his neighbor.\n\n\"Charitably, I am sure.\"\n\n\"I have been thinking of you every day,\" he continued, \"for I wanted\nyour advice.\"\n\n\"Ah! but that is not a popular thing to give.\"\n\n\"But it is precious--at least, yours is to me--and I want it now very\nmuch.\"\n\n\"Father Coleman told me you had got the plans for the cathedral,\" said\nMiss Arundel.\n\n\"And I want to show them to you.\"\n\n\"I fear I am only a critic,\" said Miss Arundel, \"and I do not admire\nmere critics. I was very free in my comments to you on several subjects\nat Vauxe; and I must now say I thought you bore it very kindly.\"\n\n\"I was enchanted,\" said Lothair, \"and desire nothing but to be ever\nsubject to such remarks. But this affair of the cathedral, it is your\nown thought--I would fain hope your own wish, for unless it were your\nown wish I do not think I ever should be able to accomplish it.\"\n\n\"And when the cathedral is built,\" said Miss Arundel \"what then?\"\n\n\"Do you not remember telling me at Vauxe that all sacred buildings\nshould be respected, for that in the long-run they generally fell to the\nprofessors of the true faith?\"\n\n\"But when they built St. Peter's, they dedicated it to a saint in\nheaven,\" said Miss Arundel. \"To whom is yours to be inscribed?\"\n\n\"To a saint in heaven and in earth,\" said Lothair, blushing; \"to St.\nClare.\"\n\nBut Lady St. Jerome and her guests rose at this moment, and it is\nimpossible to say with precision whether this last remark of Lothair\nabsolutely reached the ear of Miss Arundel. She looked as if it had\nnot. The priests and the other guests dispersed. Lothair accompanied the\nladies to the drawing-room; he lingered, and he was meditating if the\noccasion served to say more.\n\nLady St. Jerome was writing a note, Mss Arundel was arranging some work,\nLothair was affecting an interest in her employment in order that he\nmight be seated by her and ask her questions, when the groom of the\nchambers entered and inquired whether her ladyship was at home, and\nbeing answered in the affirmative, retired, and announced and ushered in\nthe duchess and Lady Corisande.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 19\n\n\nIt seemed that the duchess and Lady St. Jerome were intimate, for they\ncalled each other by their Christian names, and kissed each other.\nThe young ladies also were cordial. Her grace greeted Lothair with\nheartiness; Lady Corisande with some reserve. Lothair thought she looked\nvery radiant and very proud.\n\nIt was some time since they had all met--not since the end of the last\nseason--so there was a great deal to talk about. There had been deaths\nand births and marriages which required a flying comment--all important\nevents; deaths which solved many difficulties, heirs to estates which\nwere not expected, and weddings which surprised everybody.\n\n\"And have you seen Selina?\" inquired Lady St. Jerome.\n\n\"Not yet; except mamma, this is our first visit,\" replied the duchess.\n\n\"Ah! that is real friendship. She came down to Vauxe the other day, but\nI did not think she was looking well. She frets herself too much about\nher boys; she does not know what to do with them. They will not go into\nthe Church, and they have no fortune for the Guards.\"\n\n\"I understood that Lord Plantagenet was to be a civil engineer,\" said\nLady Corisande.\n\n\"And Lord Albert Victor to have a sheep-walk in Australia,\" continued\nLady St. Jerome.\n\n\"They say that a lord must not go to the bar,\" said Miss Arundel. \"It\nseems to me very unjust.\"\n\n\"Alfred Beaufort went the circuit,\" said Lady Corisande, \"but I believe\nthey drove him into Parliament.\"\n\n\"You will miss your friend Bertram at Oxford,\" said the duchess,\naddressing Lothair.\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Lothair, rather confused, for he was himself a defaulter\nin collegiate attendance. \"I was just going to write to him to see\nwhether one could not keep half a term.\"\n\n\"Oh! nothing will prevent his taking his degree,\" said the duchess, \"but\nI fear there must be some delay. There is a vacancy for our county--Mr.\nSandstone is dead, and they insist upon returning Bertram. I hope he\nwill be of age before the nomination. The duke is much opposed to it; he\nwishes him to wait; but in these days it is not so easy for young men to\nget into Parliament. It is not as it used to be; we cannot choose.\"\n\n\"This is an important event,\" said Lothair to Lady Corisande.\n\n\"I think it is; nor do I believe Bertram is too young for public life.\nThese are not times to be laggard.\"\n\n\"There is no doubt they are very serious times,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"I have every confidence in Bertram--in his ability and his principles.\"\n\nThe ladies began to talk about the approaching drawing-room and Lady\nCorisande's presentation, and Lothair thought it right to make his\nobeisance and withdraw. He met in the hall Father Coleman, who was in\nfact looking after him, and would have induced him to repair to the\nfather's room and hold some interesting conversation, but Lothair was\nnot so congenial as usual. He was even abrupt, and the father, who\nnever pressed any thing, assuming that Lothair had some engagement,\nrelinquished with a serene brow, but not without chagrin, what he had\ndeemed might have proved a golden opportunity.\n\nAnd yet Lothair had no engagement, and did not know where to go or what\nto do with himself. But he wanted to be alone, and of all persons in the\nworld at that moment, he had a sort of instinct that the one he wished\nleast to converse with was Father Coleman.\n\n\"She has every confidence in his principles,\" said Lothair to himself as\nhe mounted his horse, \"and his principles were mine six months ago, when\nI was at Brentham. Delicious Brentham! It seems like a dream; but every\nthing seems like a dream; I hardly know whether life is agony or bliss.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 20\n\nThe duke was one of the few gentlemen in, London who lived in a palace.\nOne of the half-dozen of those stately structures that our capital\nboasts had fallen to his lot.\n\nAn heir-apparent to the throne, in the earlier days of the present\ndynasty, had resolved to be lodged as became a prince, and had raised,\namid gardens which he had diverted from one of the royal parks, an\nedifice not unworthy of Vicenza in its best days, though on a far more\nextensive scale than any pile that favored city boasts. Before the\npalace was finished, the prince died, and irretrievably in debt. His\nexecutors were glad to sell to the trustees of the ancestors of the\nchief of the house of Brentham the incomplete palace, which ought never\nto have been commenced. The ancestor of the duke was by no means so\nstrong a man as the duke himself, and prudent people rather murmured at\nthe exploit. But it was what is called a lucky family--that is to say,\na family with a charm that always attracted and absorbed heiresses; and\nperhaps the splendor of CRECY HOUSE--for it always retained its original\ntitle--might have in some degree contributed to fascinate the taste or\nimagination of the beautiful women who, generation after generation,\nbrought their bright castles and their broad manors to swell the state\nand rent-rolls of the family who were so kind to Lothair.\n\nThe centre of Crecy House consisted of a hall of vast proportion, and\nreaching to the roof. Its walls commemorated, in paintings by the most\ncelebrated artists of the age, the exploits of the Black Prince; and its\ncoved ceiling, in panels resplendent with Venetian gold, contained\nthe forms and portraits of English heroes. A corridor round this hall\ncontained the most celebrated private collection of pictures in England\nand opened into a series of sumptuous saloons.\n\nIt was a rather early hour when Lothair, the morning after his meeting\nthe duchess at Lady St. Jerome's, called at Crecy House; but it was only\nto leave his card. He would not delay for a moment paying his respects\nthere, and yet he shrank from thrusting himself immediately into the\ncircle. The duke's brougham was in the court-yard. Lothair was holding\nhis groom's horse, who had dismounted, when the hall-door opened, and\nhis grace and Bertram came forth.\n\n\"Halloa, old fellow!\" exclaimed Bertram, \"only think of your being here.\nIt seems an age since we met. The duchess was telling us about you at\nbreakfast.\"\n\n\"Go in and see them,\" said the duke, \"there is a large party at\nluncheon; Augusta Montairy is there. Bertram and I are obliged to go to\nLincoln's Inn, something about his election.\"\n\nBut Lothair murmured thanks and declined.\n\n\"What are you going to do with yourself to-day?\" said the duke. And\nLothair hesitating, his grace continued: \"Well, then, come and dine with\nus.\"\n\n\"Of course you will come, old fellow. I have not seen you since you left\nOxford at the beginning of the year. And then we can settle about your\nterm.\" And Lothair assenting, they drove away.\n\nIt was nine o'clock before they dined. The days were getting very long,\nand soft, and sweet; the riding-parties lingered amid the pink May and\nthe tender twilight breeze. The Montairys dined to-day at Crecy House,\nand a charming married daughter without her husband, and Lord and\nLady Clanmorne, who were near kin to the duchess, and themselves so\ngood-looking and agreeable that they were as good at a dinner-party as\na couple of first-rate entr es. There was also Lord Carisbrooke, a young\nman of distinguished air and appearance; his own master, with a large\nestate, and three years or so older than Lothair.\n\nThey dined in the Chinese saloon, which was of moderate dimensions, but\nbright with fantastic forms and colors, brilliantly lit up. It was the\nprivilege of Lothair to hand the duchess to her seat. He observed that\nLord Carisbrooke was placed next to Lady Corisande, though he had not\ntaken her out.\n\n\"This dinner reminds me of my visit to Brentham,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"Almost the same party,\" said the duchess.\n\n\"The visit to Brentham was the happiest time of my life,\" said Lothair,\nmoodily.\n\n\"But you have seen a great deal since,\" said the duchess.\n\n\"I am not a sure it is of any use seeing things,\" said Lothair.\n\nWhen the ladies retired, there was some talk about horses. Lord\nCarisbrooke was breeding; Lothair thought it was a duty to breed, but\nnot to go on the turf. Lord Carisbrooke thought there could be no good\nbreeding without racing; Lothair was of opinion that races might be\nconfined to one's own parks, with no legs admitted, and immense prizes,\nwhich must cause emulation. Then they joined the ladies, and then, in a\nshort time, there was music. Lothair hovered about Lady Corisande, and\nat last seized a happy opportunity of addressing her.\n\n\"I shall never forget your singing at Brentham,\" he said; \"at first I\nthought it might be as Lady Montairy said, because I was not used to\nfine singing; but I heard the Venusina the other day, and I prefer your\nvoice and style.\"\n\n\"Have you heard the Venusina?\" said Lady Corisande, with animation; \"I\nknow nothing that I look forward to with more interest. But I was told\nshe was not to open her mouth until she appeared at the opera. Where did\nyou hear her?\"\n\n\"Oh, I heard her,\" said Lothair, \"at the Roman Catholic cathedral.\"\n\n\"I am sure I shall never hear her there,\" said Lady Corisande, looking\nvery grave.\n\n\"Do not you think music a powerful accessory to religion?\" said Lothair,\nbut a little embarrassed.\n\n\"Within certain limits,\" said Lady Corisande--\"the limits I am used to;\nbut I should prefer to hear opera-singers at the opera.\"\n\n\"Ah! if all amateurs could sing like you,\" said Lothair, \"that would be\nunnecessary. But a fine mass by Mozart--it requires great skill as well\nas power to render it. I admire no one so much as Mozart, and especially\nhis masses. I have been hearing a great many of them lately.\"\n\n\"So we understood,\" said Lady Corisande, rather dryly, and looking\nabout her as if she were not much interested, or at any rate not much\ngratified by the conversation.\n\nLothair felt he was not getting on, and he wished to get on, but he was\nsocially inexperienced, and his resources not much in hand. There was a\npause--it seemed to him an awkward pause; and then Lady Corisande walked\naway and addressed Lady Clanmorne.\n\nSome very fine singing began at this moment; the room was hushed, no\none moved, and Lothair, undisturbed, had the opportunity of watching his\nlate companion. There was something in Lady Corisande that to him was\nirresistibly captivating; and as he was always thinking and analyzing,\nhe employed himself in discovering the cause. \"She is not particularly\ngracious,\" he said to himself, \"at least not to me; she is beautiful,\nbut so are others; and others, like her, are clever--perhaps more\nclever. But there is something in her brow, her glance, her carriage,\nwhich intimate what they call character, which interests me. Six months\nago I was in love with her, because I thought she was like her sisters.\nI love her sisters, but she is not the least like them.\"\n\nThe music ceased; Lothair moved away, and he approached the duke.\n\n\"I have a favor to ask your grace,\" he said. \"I have made up my mind\nthat I shall not go back to Oxford this term; would your grace do me the\ngreat favor of presenting me at the next lev e?\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 21\n\n\nOne's life changes in a moment. Half a month ago, Lothair, without an\nacquaintance, was meditating his return to Oxford. Now he seemed to know\neverybody who was anybody. His table was overflowing with invitations to\nall the fine houses in town. First came the routs and the balls; then,\nwhen he had been presented to the husbands, came the dinners. His kind\nfriends the Duchess and Lady St. Jerome were the fairies who had worked\nthis sudden scene of enchantment. A single word from them, and London\nwas at Lothair's feet.\n\nHe liked it amazingly. He quite forgot the conclusion at which he had\narrived respecting society a year ago, drawn from his vast experience of\nthe single party which he had then attended. Feelings are different when\nyou know a great many persons, and every person is trying to please you;\nabove all, when there are individuals whom you want to meet, and whom,\nif you do not meet, you become restless.\n\nTown was beginning to blaze. Broughams whirled and bright barouches\nglanced, troops of social cavalry cantered and caracolled in morning\nrides, and the bells of prancing ponies, lashed by delicate hands,\ngingled in the laughing air. There were stoppages in Bond Street,\nwhich seems to cap the climax of civilisation, after crowded clubs and\nswarming parks.\n\nBut the great event of the season was the presentation of Lady\nCorisande. Truly our bright maiden of Brenthani woke and found herself\nfamous. There are families whom everybody praises, and families who are\ntreated in a different way. Either will do; all the sons and daughters\nof the first succeed, all the sons and daughters of the last are\nencouraged in perverseness by the prophetic determination of society.\nHalf a dozen married sisters, who were the delight and ornament of\ntheir circles, in the case of Lady Corisande were good precursors of\npopularity; but the world would not be content with that: they credited\nher with all their charms and winning qualities, but also with something\ngrander and beyond comparison; and from the moment her fair cheek was\nsealed by the gracious approbation of Majesty, all the critics of the\nCourt at once recognised her as the cynosure of the Empyrean.\n\nMonsignore Catesby, who looked after Lothair, and was always\nbreakfasting with him without the necessity of an invitation (a\nfascinating man, and who talked upon all subjects except High Mass),\nknew everything that took place at Court without being present there\nhimself. He led the conversation to the majestic theme, and while he\nseemed to be busied in breaking an egg with delicate precision, and\nhardly listening to the frank expression of opinions which he carelessly\nencouraged, obtained a not insufficient share of Lothair's views and\nimpressions of human beings and affairs in general during the last few\ndays, which had witnessed a Lev\u00c3\u00a9e and a Drawing-room.\n\n'Ah! then you were so fortunate as to know the beauty before her d\u00c3\u00a9but,'\nsaid the Monsignore.\n\n'Intimately; her brother is my friend. I was at Brentham last summer.\nDelicious place! and the most agreeable visit I ever made in my life, at\nleast, one of the most agreeable.'\n\n'Ah! ah!' said the Monsignore. 'Let me ring for some toast.'\n\nOn the night of the Drawing-room, a great ball was given at Crecy\nHouse to celebrate the entrance of Corisande into the world. It was a\nsumptuous festival. The palace, resonant with fantastic music, blazed\namid illumined gardens rich with summer warmth.\n\nA prince of the blood was dancing with Lady Corisande. Lothair was\nthere, vis-\u00c5\u0095-vis with Miss Arundel.\n\n'I delight in this hall,' she said to Lothair; 'but how superior the\npictured scene to the reality!'\n\n'What! would you like, then, to be in a battle?'\n\n'I should like to be with heroes, wherever they might be. What a fine\ncharacter was the Black Prince! And they call those days the days of\nsuperstition!'\n\nThe silver horns sounded a brave flourish. Lothair had to advance and\nmeet Lady Corisande. Her approaching mien was full of grace and majesty,\nbut Lothair thought there was a kind expression in her glance, which\nseemed to remember Brentham, and that he was her brother's Mend.\n\nA little later in the evening he was her partner. He could not refrain\nfrom congratulating her on the beauty and the success of the festival.\n\n'I am glad you are pleased, and I am glad you think it successful; but,\nyou know, I am no judge, for this is my first ball!'\n\n'Ah! to be sure; and yet it seems impossible,' he continued, in a tone\nof murmuring admiration.\n\n'Oh! I have been at little dances at my sisters;' half behind the door,'\nshe added, with a slight smile. 'But to-night I am present at a scene of\nwhich I have only read.'\n\n'And how do you like balls?' said Lothair.\n\n'I think I shall like them very much,' said Lady Corisande; 'but\nto-night, I will confess, I am a little nervous.'\n\n'You do not look so.'\n\n'I am glad of that.'\n\n'Why?'\n\n'Is it not a sign of weakness?'\n\n'Can feeling be weakness?'\n\n'Feeling without sufficient cause is, I should think.' And then, and in\na tone of some archness, she said, 'And how do you like balls?'\n\n'Well, I like them amazingly,' said Lothair. 'They seem to me to have\nevery quality which can render an entertainment agreeable: music, light,\nflowers, beautiful faces, graceful forms, and occasionally charming\nconversation.'\n\n'Yes; and that never lingers,' said Lady Corisande, 'for see, I am\nwanted.'\n\nWhen they were again undisturbed, Lothair regretted the absence of\nBertram, who was kept at the House.\n\n'It is a great disappointment,' said Lady Corisande; 'but he will yet\narrive, though late. I should be most unhappy though, if he were absent\nfrom his post on such an occasion I am sure if he were here I could not\ndance.'\n\n'You are a most ardent politician,' said Lothair.\n\n'Oh! I do not care in the least about common politics, parties and\noffice and all that; I neither regard nor understand them,' replied Lady\nCorisande. 'But when wicked men try to destroy the country, then I like\nmy family to be in the front.'\n\nAs the destruction of the country meditated this night by wicked men\nwas some change in the status of the Church of England, which Monsignore\nCatesby in the morning had suggested to Lothair as both just and\nexpedient and highly conciliatory, Lothair did not pursue the theme,\nfor he had a greater degree of tact than usually falls to the lot of the\ningenuous.\n\nThe bright moments flew on. Suddenly there was a mysterious silence in\nthe hall, followed by a kind of suppressed stir. Everyone seemed to be\nspeaking with bated breath, or, if moving, walking on tiptoe. It was the\nsupper hour?\n\nSoft hour which wakes the wish and melts the heart.\n\nRoyalty, followed, by the imperial presence of ambassadors, and escorted\nby a group of dazzling duchesses and paladins of high degree, was\nushered with courteous pomp by the host and hostess into a choice\nsaloon, hung with rose-coloured tapestry and illumined by chandeliers of\ncrystal, where they were served from gold plate. But the thousand less\nfavoured were not badly off, when they found themselves in the more\ncapacious chambers, into which they rushed with an eagerness hardly in\nkeeping with the splendid nonchalance of the preceding hours.\n\n'What a perfect family,' exclaimed Hugo Bohun, as he extracted a couple\nof fat little birds from their bed of aspic jelly; 'everything they\ndo in such perfect taste. How safe you were here to have ortolans for\nsupper!'\n\nAll the little round tables, though their number was infinite, were\nfull. Male groups hung about; some in attendance on fair dames, some\nforaging for themselves, some thoughtful and more patient and awaiting a\nsatisfactory future. Never was such an elegant clatter.\n\n'I wonder where Carisbrooke is,' said Hugo Bohun. 'They say he is\nwonderfully taken with the beauteous daughter of the house.'\n\n'I will back the Duke of Brecon against him,' said one of his\ncompanions. 'He raved about her at White's yesterday.'\n\n'Hem!'\n\n'The end is not so near as all that,' said a third wassailer.\n\n'I do not know that,' said Hugo Bohun. 'It is a family that marries off\nquickly. If a fellow is obliged to marry, he always likes to marry one\nof them.'\n\n'What of this new star?' said his friend, and he mentioned Lothair.\n\n'Oh! he is too young; not launched. Besides he is going to turn\nCatholic, and I doubt whether that would do in that quarter.'\n\n'But he has a greater fortune than any of them.'\n\n'Immense! A man I know, who knows another man----' and then he began a\nlong statistical story about Lothair's resources.\n\n'Have you got any room here, Hugo?' drawled out Lord St. Aldegonde.\n\n'Plenty, and here is my chair.'\n\n'On no account; half of it and some soup will satisfy me.'\n\n'I should have thought you would have been with the swells,' said Hugo\nBohun.\n\n'That does not exactly suit me,' said St. Aldegonde. 'I was ticketed to\nthe Duchess of Salop, but I got a first-rate substitute with the charm\nof novelty for her Grace, and sent her in with Lothair.'\n\nSt. Aldegonde was the heir apparent of the wealthiest, if not the most\nancient, dukedom in the United Kingdom. He was spoiled, but he knew\nit. Had he been an ordinary being, he would have merely subsided\ninto selfishness and caprice, but having good abilities and a\ngood disposition, he was eccentric, adventurous, and sentimental.\nNotwithstanding the apathy which had been engendered by premature\nexperience, St. Aldegonde held extreme opinions, especially on political\naffairs, being a republican of the reddest dye. He was opposed to all\nprivilege, and indeed to all orders of men, except dukes, who were a\nnecessity. He was also strongly in favour of the equal division of all\nproperty, except land. Liberty depended on land, and the greater the\nlandowners, the greater the liberty of a country. He would hold forth on\nthis topic even with energy, amazed at anyone differing from him; 'as\nif a fellow could have too much land,' he would urge with a voice and\nglance which defied contradiction. St. Aldegonde had married for love,\nand he loved his wife, but he was strongly in favour of woman's rights\nand their extremest consequences. It was thought that he had originally\nadopted these latter views with the amiable intention of piquing Lady\nSt. Aldegonde; but if so, he had not succeeded. Beaming with brightness,\nwith the voice and airiness of a bird, and a cloudless temper, Albertha\nSt. Aldegonde had, from the first hour of her marriage, concentrated her\nintelligence, which was not mean, on one object; and that was never\nto cross her husband on any conceivable topic. They had been married\nseveral years, and she treated him as a darling spoiled child. When he\ncried for the moon, it was promised him immediately; however irrational\nhis proposition, she always assented to it, though generally by tact\nand vigilance she guided him in the right direction. Nevertheless, St.\nAldegonde was sometimes in scrapes; but then he always went and told\nhis best friend, whose greatest delight was to extricate him from his\nperplexities and embarrassments.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 22\n\n\nAlthough Lothair was not in the slightest degree shaken in his\nconviction that life should be entirely religious, he was perplexed by\nthe inevitable obstacles which seemed perpetually to oppose themselves\nto the practice of his opinions. It was not merely pleasure in its\nmultiform appearances that he had to contend against, but business began\nimperiously to solicit his attention. Every month brought him nearer to\nhis majority, and the frequent letters from Mr. Putney Giles now began\nto assume the pressing shape of solicitations for personal interviews.\nHe had a long conversation one morning with Father Coleman on this\nsubject, who greatly relieved him by the assurance that a perfectly\nreligious life was one of which the sovereign purpose was to uphold the\ninterests of the Church of Christ, the father added after a momentary\npause. Business, and even amusement, were, not only compatible with such\na purpose, but might even be conducive to its fulfilment.\n\nMr. Putney Giles reminded Lothair that the attainment of his majority\nmust be celebrated, and in a becoming manner. Preparation, and even\nconsiderable preparation, was necessary. There were several scenes\nof action--some very distant. It was not too early to contemplate\narrangements. Lothair really must confer with his guardians. They were\nboth now in town, the Scotch uncle having come up to attend Parliament.\nCould they be brought together? Was it indeed impossible? If so, who\nwas to give the necessary instructions?\n\nIt was much more than a year since Lothair had met his uncle, and he did\nnot anticipate much satisfaction from the renewal of their intimacy; but\nevery feeling of propriety demanded that it should be recognized, and to\na certain degree revived. Lord Culloden was a black Scotchman, tall and\nlean, with good features, a hard red face and iron-gray hair. He was a\nman who shrank from scenes, and he greeted Lothair as if they had only\nparted yesterday. Looking at him with his keen, unsentimental, but\nnot unkind, eye, he said: \"Well, sir, I thought you would have been at\nOxford.\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear uncle; but circumstances--\"\n\n\"Well, well, I don't want to hear the cause. I am very glad you are not\nthere; I believe you might as well be at Rome.\"\n\nAnd then in due course, and after some talk of the past and old times,\nLothair referred to the suggestions of Mr. Giles, and hinted at a\nmeeting of his guardians to confer and advise together.\n\n\"No, no,\" said the Scotch peer, shaking his head; \"I will have nothing\nto do with the Scarlet Lady. Mr. Giles is an able and worthy man; he may\nwell be trusted to draw up a programme for our consideration, and indeed\nit is an affair in which yourself should be most consulted. Let all\nbe done liberally, for you have a great inheritance, and I would be no\ncurmudgeon in these matters.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear uncle, whatever is arranged, I hope you and my\ncousins will honor and gratify me with your presence throughout the\nproceedings.\"\n\n\"Well, well, it is not much in my way. You will be having balls and fine\nladies. There is no fool like an old fool, they say; but I think, from\nwhat I hear, the young fools will beat us in the present day. Only think\nof young persons going over to the Church of Rome. Why, they are just\nnaturals!\"\n\nThe organizing genius of Mr. Putney Giles had rarely encountered a more\nfitting theme than the celebration of the impending majority. There\nwas place for all his energy and talent and resources; a great central\ninauguration; sympathetical festivals and gatherings in half a dozen\nother counties; the troth, as it were, of a sister kingdom to be\npledged; a vista of balls and banquets, and illuminations and addresses,\nof ceaseless sports and speeches, and processions alike endless.\n\n\"What I wish to effect,\" said Mr. Giles, as he was giving his\nmultifarious orders, \"is to produce among all classes an impression\nadequate to the occasion. I wish the lord and the tenantry alike to feel\nthey have a duty to perform.\"\n\nIn the mean time, Monsignore Catesby was pressing Lothair to become one\nof the patrons of a Roman Catholic Bazaar, where Lady St. Jerome and\nMiss Arundel were to preside over a stall. It was of importance to show\nthat charity was not the privilege of any particular creed.\n\nBetween his lawyers, and his monsignores, and his architects, Lothair\nbegan to get a little harassed. He was disturbed in his own mind,\ntoo, on greater matters, and seemed to feel every day that it was more\nnecessary to take a decided step, and more impossible to decide upon\nwhat it should be. He frequently saw the cardinal, who was very kind\nto him, but who had become more reserved on religious subjects. He had\ndined more than once with his eminence, and had met some distinguished\nprelates and some of his fellow-nobles who had been weaned from the\nerrors of their cradle. The cardinal, perhaps, thought that the presence\nof these eminent converts would facilitate the progress, perhaps the\ndecision, of his ward; but something seemed always to happen to divert\nLothair in his course. It might-be sometimes apparently a very slight\ncause, but yet for the time sufficient; a phrase of Lady Corisande for\nexample, who, though she never directly addressed him on the subject,\nwas nevertheless deeply interested in his spiritual condition.\n\n\"You ought to speak to him, Bertram,\" she said one day to her brother\nvery indignantly, as she read a fresh paragraph alluding to an impending\nconversion. \"You are his friend. What is the use of friendship if not in\nsuch a crisis as this?\"\n\n\"I see no use in speaking to a man about love or religion,\" said\nBertram; \"they are both stronger than friendship. If there be any\nfoundation for the paragraph, my interference would be of no avail; if\nthere be none, I should only make myself ridiculous.\"\n\nNevertheless, Bertram looked a little more after his friend, and\ndisturbing the monsignore, who was at breakfast with Lothair one\nmorning, Bertram obstinately outstayed the priest, and then said: \"I\ntell you what, old fellow, you are rather hippish; I wish you were in\nthe House of Commons.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" said Lothair, with a sigh; \"but I have come into every thing\nready-made. I begin to think it very unfortunate.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do with yourself to-day? If you be disengaged, I\nvote we dine together at White's, and then we will go down to the House.\nI will take you to the smoking-room and introduce you to Bright, and we\nwill trot him out on primogeniture.\"\n\nAt this moment the servant brought Lothair two letters: one was an\nepistle from Father Coleman, meeting Lothair's objections to becoming a\npatron of the Roman Catholic Bazaar, in a very unctuous and exhaustive\nmanner; and the other from his stud-groom at Oxford, detailing some of\nthose disagreeable things which will happen with absent masters who\nwill not answer letters. Lothair loved his stable, and felt particularly\nanxious to avoid the threatened visit of Father Coleman on the morrow.\nHis decision was rapid. \"I must go down, this afternoon to Oxford,\nmy dear fellow. My stable is in confusion. I shall positively return\nto-morrow, and I will dine with you at White's, and we will go to the\nHouse of Commons together, or go to the play.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 23\n\n\nLothair's stables were about three miles from Oxford. They were a rather\nconsiderable establishment, in which he had taken much interest, and,\nhaving always intended to return to Oxford in the early part of the\nyear, although he had occasionally sent for a hack or two to London, his\nstud had been generally maintained.\n\nThe morning after his arrival, he rode over to the stables, where he\nhad ordered his drag to be ready. About a quarter of a mile before he\nreached his place of destination, he observed at some little distance\na crowd in the road, and, hastening on, perceived as he drew nearer\na number of men clustered round a dismantled vehicle, and vainly\nendeavoring to extricate and raise a fallen horse; its companion,\npanting and foaming, with broken harness but apparently uninjured,\nstanding aside and held by a boy. Somewhat apart stood a lady alone.\nLothair immediately dismounted and approached her, saying, \"I fear you\nare in trouble, madam. Perhaps I may be of service?\"\n\nThe lady was rather tall, and of a singularly distinguished presence.\nHer air and her costume alike intimated high breeding and fashion. She\nseemed quite serene amid the tumult and confusion, and apparently the\nrecent danger. As Lothair spoke, she turned her head to him, which had\nbeen at first a little averted, and he beheld a striking countenance,\nbut one which he instantly felt he did not see for the first time.\n\nShe bowed with dignity to Lothair, and said in a low but distinct voice:\n\"You are most courteous, sir. We have had a sad: accident, but a great\nescape. Our horses ran away with us, and, had it not been for that heap\nof stones, I do not see how we could have been saved.\"\n\n\"Fortunately my stables are at hand,\" said Lothair, \"and I have a\ncarriage waiting for me at this moment, not a quarter of a mile away. It\nis at your service, and I will send for it,\" and his groom, to whom he\ngave directions, galloped off.\n\nThere was a shout as the fallen horse was on his legs again, much cut,\nand the carriage shattered and useless. A gentleman came from the crowd\nand approached the lady. He was tall and fair, and not ill-favored, with\nfine dark eyes and high cheekbones, and still young, though an enormous\nbeard at the first glance gave him an impression of years, the burden of\nwhich he really did not bear. His dress, though not vulgar, was richer\nand more showy than is usual in this country, and altogether there was\nsomething in his manner which, though calm and full of self-respect,\nwas different from the conventional refinement of England. Yet he was\napparently an Englishman, as he said to the lady, \"It is a bad business,\nbut we must be thankful it is no worse. What troubles me is how you are\nto get back. It will be a terrible walk over these stony roads, and I\ncan hear of no conveyance.\"\n\n\"My husband,\" said the lady, as with dignity she presented the person\nto Lothair. \"This gentleman,\" she continued, \"has most kindly offered us\nthe use of his carriage, which is almost at hand.\"\n\n\"Sir, you are a friend,\" said the gentleman. \"I thought there were no\nhorses that I could not master, but it seems I am mistaken. I bought\nthese only yesterday; took a fancy to them as we were driving about, and\nbought them of a dealer in the road.\"\n\n\"That seems a clever animal,\" said Lothair, pointing to the one\nuninjured.\n\n\"Ah! you like horses?\" said the gentleman.\n\n\"Well, I have some taste that way.\"\n\n\"We are visitors to Oxford,\" said the lady. \"Colonel Campian, like all\nAmericans, is very interested in the ancient parts of England.\"\n\n\"To-day we were going to Blenheim,\" said the colonel, \"but I thought I\nwould try these new tits a bit on a by-road first.\"\n\n\"All's well that ends well,\" said Lothair; \"and there is no reason why\nyou should not fulfil your intention of going to Blenheim, for here is\nmy carriage, and it is entirely at your service for the whole day, and,\nindeed, as long as you stay at Oxford.\"\n\n\"Sir, there requires no coronet on Your carriage to tell me you are\na nobleman,\" said the colonel. \"I like frank manners, and I like your\nteam. I know few things that would please me more than to try them.\"\n\nThey were four roans, highly bred, with black manes and tails. They had\nthe Arab eye, with arched neck and seemed proud of themselves and their\nmaster.\n\n\"I do not see why we should not go to Blenheim,\" said the colonel.\n\n\"Well, not to-day,\" said the lady, \"I think. We have had an escape, but\none feels these things a little more afterward than at the time. I\nwould rather go back to Oxford and be quiet; and there is more than one\ncollege which you have not yet seen.\"\n\n\"My team is entirely at your service wherever you go,\" said Lothair;\n\"but I cannot venture to drive you to Oxford, for I am there in statu\npupillari and a proctor might arrest us all. But perhaps,\" and he\napproached the lady, \"you will permit me to call on you to-morrow, when\nI hope I may find you have not suffered by this misadventure.\"\n\n\"We have got a professor dining with us to-day at seven o'clock,\" said\nthe colonel, \"at our hotel, and if you be disengaged and would join the\nparty you would add to the favors which you know so well how to confer.\"\n\nLothair handed the lady into the carriage, the colonel mounted the box\nand took the ribbons like a master, and the four roans trotted away with\ntheir precious charge and their two grooms behind with folded arms and\nimperturbable countenances.\n\nLothair watched the equipage until it vanished in the distance.\n\n\"It is impossible to forget that countenance,\" he said; \"and I fancy\nI did hear at the time that she had married an American. Well, I shall\nmeet her at dinner--that is something.\" And he sprang into his saddle.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 24\n\n\nThe Oxford professor, who was the guest of the American colonel, was\nquite a young man, of advanced opinions on all subjects, religious,\nsocial, and political. He was clever, extremely well-informed, so far as\nbooks can make a man knowing, but unable to profit even by his limited\nexperience of life from a restless vanity and overflowing conceit, which\nprevented him from ever observing or thinking of any thing but himself.\nHe was gifted with a great command of words, which took the form of\nendless exposition, varied by sarcasm and passages of ornate jargon. He\nwas the last person one would have expected to recognize in an Oxford\nprofessor; but we live in times of transition.\n\nA Parisian man of science, who had passed his life in alternately\nfighting at barricades and discovering planets, had given Colonel\nCampian, who had lived much in the French capital, a letter of\nintroduction to the professor, whose invectives against the principles\nof English society were hailed by foreigners as representative of the\nsentiments of venerable Oxford. The professor, who was not satisfied\nwith his home career, and, like many men of his order of mind, had\ndreams of wild vanity which the New World, they think, can alone\nrealize, was very glad to make the colonel's acquaintance, which might\nfacilitate his future movements. So he had lionized the distinguished\nvisitors during the last few days over the university, and had availed\nhimself of plenteous opportunities for exhibiting to them his celebrated\npowers of exposition, his talent for sarcasm, which he deemed peerless,\nand several highly-finished, picturesque passages, which were introduced\nwith contemporary art.\n\nThe professor was very much surprised when he saw Lothair enter the\nsaloon at the hotel. He was the last person in Oxford whom he expected\nto encounter. Like sedentary men of extreme opinions, he was a social\nparasite, and instead of indulging in his usual invectives against peers\nand princes, finding himself unexpectedly about to dine with one of that\nclass, he was content only to dazzle and amuse him.\n\nMrs. Campian only entered the room when dinner was announced. She\ngreeted Lothair with calmness but amenity, and took his offered arm.\n\n\"You have not suffered, I hope?\" said Lothair.\n\n\"Very little, and through your kindness.\"\n\nIt was a peculiar voice, low and musical, too subdued to call thrilling,\nbut a penetrating voice, so that, however ordinary the observation, it\nattracted and impressed attention. But it was in harmony with all her\nappearance and manner. Lothair thought he had never seen any one or any\nthing so serene; the serenity, however, not of humbleness, nor of merely\nconscious innocence; it was not devoid of a degree of majesty; what one\npictures of Olympian repose. And the countenance was Olympian: a Phidian\nface, with large gray eyes and dark lashes; wonderful hair, abounding\nwithout art, and gathered together by Grecian fillets.\n\nThe talk was of Oxford, and was at first chiefly maintained by the\ncolonel and the professor.\n\n\"And do you share Colonel Campian's feeling about Old England?\" inquired\nLothair of his hostess.\n\n\"The present interests me more than the past,\" said the lady, \"and the\nfuture more than the present.\"\n\n\"The present seems to me as unintelligible as the future,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"I think it is intelligible,\" said the lady, with a faint smile. \"It has\nmany faults but, not, I think, the want of clearness.\"\n\n\"I am not a destructive,\" said the professor, addressing the colonel,\nbut speaking loudly; \"I would maintain Oxford, under any circumstances,\nwith the necessary changes.\"\n\n\"And what are those might I ask?\" inquired Lothair.\n\n\"In reality, not much. I would get rid of the religion.\"\n\n\"Get rid of the religion!\" said Lothair.\n\n\"You have got rid of it once,\" said the professor.\n\n\"You have altered, you have what people call reformed it,\" said Lothair;\n\"but you have not abolished or banished it from the university.\"\n\n\"The shock would not be greater, nor so great, as the change from the\npapal to the Reformed faith. Besides, universities have nothing to do\nwith religion.\"\n\n\"I thought universities were universal,\" said Lothair, \"and had\nsomething to do with every thing.\"\n\n\"I cannot conceive any society of any kind without religion,\" said the\nlady.\n\nLothair glanced at her beautiful brow with devotion as she uttered these\nwords.\n\nColonel Campian began to talk about horses. After that the professor\nproved to him that he was related to Edmund Campian, the Jesuit;\nand then he got to the Gunpowder Plot, which, he was not sure, if\nsuccessful, might not have beneficially influenced the course of our\nhistory. Probably the Irish difficulty would not then have existed.\n\n\"I dislike plots,\" said the lady; \"they always fail.\"\n\n\"And, whatever their object, are they not essentially immoral?\" said\nLothair.\n\n\"I have more faith in ideas than in persons,\" said the lady. \"When a\ntruth is uttered, it will, sooner or later, be recognized. It is only\nan affair of time. It is better that it should mature and naturally\ngerminate than be forced.\"\n\n\"You would reduce us to lotus-eaters,\" exclaimed the professor. \"Action\nis natural to man. And what, after all, are conspiracies and revolutions\nbut great principles in violent action?\"\n\n\"I think you must be an admirer of repose,\" said Lothair to the lady, in\na low voice.\n\n\"Because I have seen something of action in my life;\" said the lady,\n\"and it is an experience of wasted energies and baffled thoughts.\"\n\nWhen they returned to the saloon, the colonel and the professor\nbecame interested in the constitution and discipline of the American\nuniversities. Lothair hung about the lady, who was examining some views\nof Oxford, and who was ascertaining what she had seen and what she had\nomitted to visit. They were thinking of returning home on the morrow.\n\n\"Without seeing Blenheim?\" said Lothair.\n\n\"Without seeing Blenheim,\" said the lady; \"I confess to a pang; but I\nshall always associate with that name your great kindness to us.\"\n\n\"But cannot we for once enter into a conspiracy together,\" said Lothair,\n\"and join in a happy plot and contrive to go? Besides, I could take you\nto the private gardens, for the duke has given me a perpetual order, and\nthey are really exquisite.\"\n\nThe lady seemed to smile.\n\n\"Theodora,\" said the colonel, speaking from the end of the room, \"what\nhave you settled about your train to-morrow?\"\n\n\"We want, to stay another day here,\" said Theodora, \"and go to\nBlenheim.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 25\n\n\nThey were in the private gardens at Blenheim. The sun was brilliant over\nthe ornate and yet picturesque scene.\n\n\"Beautiful, is it not?\" exclaimed Lothair.\n\n\"Yes, certainly beautiful,\" said Theodora. \"But, do you know, I do\nnot feel altogether content in these fine gardens? The principle of\nexclusion on which they are all founded is to me depressing. I require\nin all things sympathy. You would not agree with me in this. The manners\nof your country are founded on exclusion.\"\n\n\"But, surely, there are times and places when one would like to be\nalone.\"\n\n\"Without doubt,\" said the lady; \"only I do not like artificial\nloneliness. Even your parks, which all the world praises, do not quite\nsatisfy me. I prefer a forest where all may go--even the wild beasts.\"\n\n\"But forests are not at command,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"So you make a solitude and call it peace,\" said the lady, with a slight\nsmile. \"For my part, my perfect life would be a large and beautiful\nvillage. I admire Nature, but I require the presence of humanity. Life\nin great cities is too exhausting; but in my village there should be\nair, streams, and beautiful trees, a picturesque scene, but enough of my\nfellow-creatures to insure constant duty.\"\n\n\"But the fulfilment of duty and society, founded on what you call the\nprinciple of exclusion, are not incompatible,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"No, but difficult. What should be natural becomes an art; and in every\nart it is only the few who can be first rate.\"\n\n\"I have an ambition to be a first-rate artist in that respect,\" said\nLothair, thoughtfully.\n\n\"That does you much honor,\" she replied, \"for you necessarily embark\nin a most painful enterprise. The toiling multitude have their sorrows,\nwhich, I believe, will some day be softened, and obstacles hard to\novercome; but I have always thought that the feeling of satiety, almost\ninseparable from large possessions, is a surer cause of misery than\nungratified desires.\"\n\n\"It seems to me that there is a great deal to do,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"I think so,\" said the lady.\n\n\"Theodora,\" said the colonel, who was a little in advance with the\nprofessor, and turning round his head, \"this reminds me of Mirabel,\"\nand he pointed to the undulating banks covered with rare shrubs, and\ntouching the waters of the lake.\n\n\"And where is Mirabel?\" said Lothair.\n\n\"It was a green island in the Adriatic,\" said the lady, \"which belonged\nto Colonel Campian; we lost it in the troubles. Colonel Campian was very\nfond of it. I try to persuade him that our home was of volcanic origin,\nand has only vanished and subsided into its native bed.\"\n\n\"And were not you fond of it?\"\n\n\"I never think of the past,\" said the lady.\n\n\"Oxford is not the first place where I had the pleasure of meeting you,\"\nLothair ventured at length to observe.\n\n\"Yes, we have met before, in Hyde Park Gardens. Our hostess is a clever\nwoman, and has been very kind to some friends of mine.\"\n\n\"And have you seen her lately?\"\n\n\"She comes to see us sometimes. We do not live in London, but in the\nvicinity. We only go to London for the opera, of which we are devotees.\nWe do not at all enter general society; Colonel Campian only likes\npeople who interest or amuse him, and he is fortunate in having rather a\nnumerous acquaintance of that kind.\"\n\n\"Rare fortune!\" said Lothair.\n\n\"Colonel Campian lived a great deal at Paris before we marred,\" said\nthe lady, \"and in a circle of considerable culture and excitement. He is\nsocial, but not conventional.\"\n\n\"And you--are you conventional?\"\n\n\"Well, I live only for climate and the affections,\" said the lady \"I am\nfond of society that pleases me, that is, accomplished and natural and\ningenious; otherwise I prefer being alone. As for atmosphere, as I look\nupon it as the main source of felicity, you may be surprised that I\nshould reside in your country. I should myself like to go to America,\nbut that would not suit Colonel Campian; and, if we are to live in\nEurope, we must live in England. It is not pleasant to reside in a\ncountry where, if you happen to shelter or succor a friend, you may be\nsubject to a domiciliary visit.\"\n\nThe professor stopped to deliver a lecture or address on the villa\nof Hadrian. Nothing could be more minute or picturesque than his\ndescription of that celebrated pleasaunce. It was varied by portraits of\nthe emperor and some of his companions, and, after a rapid glance at\nthe fortunes of the imperial patriciate, wound up with some conclusions\nfavorable to communism. It was really very clever, and would have made\nthe fortune of a literary society.\n\n\"I wonder if they had gravel-walks in the villa of Hadrian?\" said\nthe colonel. \"What I admire most in your country, my lord, are your\ngravel-walks, though that lady would not agree with me that matter.\"\n\n\"You are against gravel-walks,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"Well, I cannot bring myself to believe that they had gravel-walks in\nthe garden of Eden,\" said the lady.\n\nThey had a repast at Woodstock, too late for luncheon, too early for\ndinner, but which it was agreed should serve as the latter meal.\n\n\"That suits me exactly,\" said the lady; \"I am a great foe to dinners,\nand indeed to all meals. I think when the good time comes we shall give\nup eating in public, except perhaps fruit on a green bank with music.\"\n\nIt was a rich twilight as they drove home, the lady leaning back in\nthe carriage silent. Lothair sat opposite to her, and gazed upon\na countenance on which the moon began to glisten, and which seemed\nunconscious of all human observation.\n\nHe had read of such countenances in Grecian dreams; in Corinthian\ntemples, in fanes of Ephesus, in the radiant shadow of divine groves.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 26\n\n\nWhen they had arrived at the hotel, Colonel Campian proposed that they\nshould come in and have some coffee; but Theodora did not enforce this\nsuggestion; and Lothair, feeling that she might be wearied, gracefully\nthough unwillingly waived the proposal. Remembering that on the noon\nof the morrow they were to depart, with a happy inspiration, as he said\nfarewell, he asked permission to accompany them to the station.\n\nLothair walked away with the professor, who seemed in a conservative\nvein, and graciously disposed to make several concessions to the customs\nof an ancient country. Though opposed to the land laws, he would operate\ngradually, and gave Lothair more than one receipt how to save the\naristocracy. Lothair would have preferred talking about the lady they\nhad just quitted, but, as he soon found the professor could really give\nhim no information about her, he let the subject drop.\n\nBut not out of his own mind. He was glad to be alone and brood over the\nlast two days. They were among the most interesting of his life. He had\nencountered a character different from any he had yet met, had listened\nto new views, and his intelligence had been stimulated by remarks made\ncasually, in easy conversation, and yet to him pregnant with novel\nand sometimes serious meaning. The voice, too, lingered in his ear,\nso hushed and deep, and yet so clear and sweet. He leaned over his\nmantel-piece in teeming reverie.\n\n\"And she is profoundly religious,\" he said to himself; \"she can conceive\nno kind of society without religion. She has arrived at the same\nconclusion as myself. What a privilege it would be to speak to her on\nsuch subjects!\"\n\nAfter a restless night the morrow came. About eleven o'clock Lothair\nventured to call on his new friends. The lady was alone; she was\nstanding by the window, reading an Italian newspaper, which she folded\nup and placed aside when Lothair was announced.\n\n\"We propose to walk to the station,\" said Theodora; \"the servants have\ngone on. Colonel Campian has a particular aversion to moving with any\nluggage. He restricts me to this,\" she said, pointing to her satchel, in\nwhich she had placed the foreign newspaper, \"and for that he will not be\nresponsible.\"\n\n\"It was most kind of you to permit me to accompany you this morning,\"\nsaid Lothair; \"I should have been grieved to have parted abruptly last\nnight.\"\n\n\"I could not refuse such a request,\" said the lady; \"but do you know, I\nnever like to say farewell, even for four-and-twenty hours? One should\nvanish like a spirit.\"\n\n\"Then I have erred,\" said Lothair, \"against your rules and principles.\"\n\n\"Say my fancies,\" said the lady, \"my humors, my whims. Besides, this is\nnot a farewell. You will come and see us. Colonel Campian tells me you\nhave promised to give us that pleasure.\"\n\n\"It will be the greatest pleasure to me,\" said Lothair; \"I can conceive\nnothing greater.\" And then hesitating a little, and a little blushing,\nhe added, \"When do you think I might come?\"\n\n\"Whenever you like,\" said the lady; \"you will always find me at home. My\nlife is this: I ride every day very early, and far into the country, so\nI return tamed some two or three hours after noon, and devote myself to\nmy friends. We are at home every evening, except opera nights; and\nlet me tell you, because it is not the custom generally among your\ncompatriots, we are always at home on Sundays.\"\n\nColonel Campian entered the room; the moment of departure was at hand.\nLothair felt the consolation of being their companion to the station. He\nhad once hoped it might be possible to be their companion in the train;\nbut he was not encouraged.\n\n\"Railways have elevated and softened the lot of man,\" said Theodora,\n\"and Colonel Campian views them with almost a religious sentiment. But I\ncannot read in a railroad, and the human voice is distressing to me\namid the whirl and the whistling, and the wild panting of the loosened\nmegatheria who drag us. And then those terrible grottos--it is quite a\ndescent of Proserpine; so I have no resources but my thoughts.\"\n\n\"And surely that is sufficient,\" murmured Lothair.\n\n\"Not when the past is expelled,\" said the lady.\n\n\"But the future,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"Yes, that is ever interesting, but so vague that it sometimes induces\nslumber.\"\n\nThe bell sounded; Lothair handed the lady to her compartment.\n\n\"Our Oxford visit,\" she said, \"has been a great success, and mainly\nthrough you.\"\n\nThe colonel was profuse in his cordial farewells, and it seemed they\nwould never have ended had not the train moved.\n\nLothair remained upon the platform until it was out of sight, and then\nexclaimed, \"Is it a dream, or shall I ever see her again?\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 27\n\n\nLothair reached London late in the afternoon. Among the notes and cards\nand letters on his table was a long and pressing dispatch from Mr.\nPutney Giles awaiting his judgment and decision on many points.\n\n\"The central inauguration, if I may use the term,\" said Mr. Putney\nGiles, \"is comparatively easy. It is an affair of expense and of\nlabor--great labor; I may say unremitting labor. But your lordship will\nobserve the other points are not mere points of expense and labor. We\nhave to consult the feelings of several counties where your lordship\ncannot be present, at least certainly not on this occasion, and yet\nwhere an adequate recognition of those sentiments which ought to exist\nbetween the proprietor and all classes connected with him ought to be\nsecured. Then Scotland: Scotland is a very difficult business to manage.\nIt is astonishing how the sentiment lingers in that country connected\nwith its old independence. I really am quite surprised at it. One of\nyour lordship's most important tenants wrote to me only a few days back\nthat great dissatisfaction would prevail among your lordship's friends\nand tenantry in Scotland, if that country on this occasion were placed\non the same level as a mere English county. It must be recognized as\na kingdom. I almost think it would be better if we could persuade Lord\nCulloden, not to attend the English inauguration, but remain in the\nkingdom of Scotland, and take the chair and the lead throughout the\nfestal ceremonies. A peer of the realm, and your lordship's guardian,\nwould impart something of national character to the proceedings, and\nthis, with a judicious emblazoning on some of the banners of the royal\narms of Scotland, might have a conciliatory effect. One should always\nconciliate. But your lordship, upon all these points, and especially\nwith reference to Lord Culloden, must be a much better judge than I am.\"\n\nLothair nearly gave a groan. \"I almost wish,\" he thought, \"my minority\nwould never end. I am quite satisfied with things as they are. What is\nthe kingdom of Scotland to me and all these counties? I almost begin to\nfeel that satiety which she said was inseparable from vast possessions.\"\n\nA letter from Bertram, reminding him that he had not dined at White's as\nhe had promised, and suggesting some new arrangement, and another from\nMonsignore Catesby, earnestly urging him to attend a most peculiar and\nsolemn function of the Church next Sunday evening, where the cardinal\nwould officiate and preach, and in which Lady St. Jerome and Miss\nArundel were particularly interested, did not restore his equanimity.\n\nA dinner at White's! He did not think he could stand a dinner at\nWhite's. Indeed, he was not sure that he could stand any dinner\nanywhere, especially in this hot weather. There was a good deal in what\nshe said: \"One ought to eat alone.\"\n\nThe ecclesiastical function was a graver matter. It had been long\ncontemplated, often talked about, and on occasions looked forward to\nby him even with a certain degree of eagerness. He wished he had had\nan opportunity of speaking with her on these matters. She was eminently\nreligious; that she had voluntarily avowed. And he felt persuaded that\nno light or thoughtless remark could fall from those lips. He wondered\nto what Church she belonged? Protestant or papal? Her husband, being\nan American, was probably a Protestant, but he was a gentleman of the\nSouth, and with nothing puritanical about him. She was a European, and\nprobably of a Latin race. In all likelihood she was a Roman Catholic.\n\nIt was Wednesday evening, and his valet reminded him that he was engaged\nto dine with Lord and Lady Montairy.\n\nLothair sighed. He was so absorbed by his new feelings that he shrunk\nfrom society with a certain degree of aversion. He felt it quite out of\nhis power to fulfil his engagement. He sent an excuse. It was Lothair's\nfirst excuse. In short, he \"threw over\" the Montairys, to whom he was\nso much attached, whom he so much admired, and whose society he had\nhitherto so highly prized.\n\nTo \"throw over\" a host is the most heinous of social crimes. It\nought never to be pardoned. It disjoints a party, often defeats the\ncombinations which might affect the results of a season, and generally\nrenders the society incoherent and unsatisfactory. If the outrage\ncould ever be condoned, it might be in the instance of a young man\nvery inexperienced, the victim of some unexpected condition of nervous\nfeelings over which the defaulter has really no control.\n\nIt was evening, and the restless Lothair walked forth without a purpose,\nand in a direction which he rarely visited. \"It is a wonderful place,\"\nsaid he, \"this London; a nation, not a city; with a population greater\nthan some kingdoms, and districts as different as if they were under\ndifferent governments and spoke different languages. And what do I know\nof it? I have been living here six months, and my life has been passed\nin a park, two or three squares, and half a dozen streets!\"\n\nSo he walked on and soon crossed Oxford Street, like the Rhine a natural\nboundary, and then got into Portland Place, and then found himself\nin the New Road, and then he hailed a cruising Hansom, which he had\npreviously observed was well horsed.\n\n\"'Tis the gondola of London,\" said Lothair as he sprang in.\n\n\"Drive on till I tell you to stop.\"\n\nAnd the Hansom drove on, through, endless boulevards, some bustling,\nsome dingy, some tawdry and flaring, some melancholy and mean; rows of\ngarden gods, planted on the walls of yards full of vases and divinities\nof concrete, huge railway halls, monster hotels, dissenting chapels in\nthe form of Gothic churches, quaint ancient almshouses that were once\nbuilt in the fields, and tea-gardens and stingo-houses and knackers'\nyards. They were in a district far beyond the experience of Lothair,\nwhich indeed had been exhausted when he had passed Eustonia, and from\nthat he had been long separated. The way was broad but ill-lit, with\nhouses of irregular size but generally of low elevation, and sometimes\ndetached in smoke-dried gardens. The road was becoming a bridge which\ncrossed a canal, with barges and wharves and timber-yards, when their\nprogress was arrested by a crowd. It seemed a sort of procession; there\nwas a banner, and the lamp-light fell upon a religious emblem. Lothair\nwas interested, and desired the driver not to endeavor to advance. The\nprocession was crossing the road and entering a building.\n\n\"It's a Roman Catholic chapel,\" said a bystander in answer to Lothair.\n\"I believe it is a meeting about one of their schools. They always have\nbanners.\"\n\n\"I think I will get out,\" said Lothair to his driver. \"This, I suppose,\nwill pay your fare.\"\n\nThe man stared with delight at the sovereign in his astonished palm, and\nin gratitude suggested that he should remain and wait for the gentleman,\nbut the restless Lothair declined the proposal.\n\n\"Sir, sir,\" said the man, leaning down his head as low as possible\nfrom his elevated seat, and speaking in a hushed voice, \"you are a real\ngentleman. Do you know what all this is?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; some meeting about a Roman Catholic school.\"\n\nThe man shook his head. \"You are a real gentleman, and I will tell you\nthe truth. They meet about the schools of the order of St. Joseph--over\nthe left--it is a Fenian meeting.\"\n\n\"A Fenian meeting?\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, and you cannot enter that place without a ticket. Just you try!\nHowever, if a gentleman like you wants to go, you shall have my ticket,\"\nsaid the cab-driver; \"and here it is. And may I drive to-morrows as true\na gentleman as I have driven to-day!\"\n\nSo saying, he took a packet from his breast-pocket, and opening it\noffered to Lothair a green slip of paper, which was willingly accepted.\n\"I should like above all things to go,\" he said, and he blended with\nthe rear of those who were entering the building. The collector of\nthe tickets stared at Lothair and scrutinized his pass, but all was in\norder, and Lothair was admitted.\n\nHe passed through a house and a yard, at the bottom of which was a\nrather spacious building. When he entered it, he saw in an instant it\nwas not a chapel. It was what is called a temperance-hall, a room to be\nhired for public assemblies, with a raised platform at the end, on which\nwere half a dozen men. The hall was tolerably full, and Lothair came\nin among the last. There were some children sitting on a form placed\nagainst the wall of the room, each with a bun which kept them quiet; the\nbanner belonged to this school, and was the banner of St. Joseph.\n\nA man dressed like a pries and known as Father O'Molloy, came forward.\nHe was received with signs of much sympathy, succeeded by complete\nsilence. He addressed them in a popular and animated style on the\nadvantages of education. They knew what that was, and then they\ncheered.. Education taught them to know their rights. But what was the\nuse of knowing their rights unless they enforced them? That was not\nto be done by prayer-books, but by something else, and something else\nwanted a subscription.\n\nThis was the object of the meeting and the burden of all the speeches\nwhich followed, and which were progressively more outspoken than the\nadroit introductory discourse. The Saxon was denounced, sometimes with\ncoarseness, but sometimes in terms of picturesque passion; the vast and\nextending organization of the brotherhood was enlarged on, the great\nresults at hand intimated; the necessity of immediate exertion on the\npart of every individual pressed with emphasis. All these views and\nremarks received from the audience an encouraging response; and when\nLothair observed men going round with boxes, and heard the clink of\ncoin, he felt very embarrassed as to what he should do when asked to\ncontribute to a fund raised to stimulate and support rebellion against\nhis sovereign. He regretted the rash restlessness which had involved him\nin such a position.\n\nThe collectors approached Lothair, who was standing at the end of the\nroom opposite to the platform, where the space was not crowded.\n\n\"I should like to speak to Father O'Molloy,\" said Lothair; \"he is a\npriest, and will understand my views.\"\n\n\"He is a priest here,\" said one of the collectors with a sardonic laugh,\n\"but I am glad to say you will not find his name in the directory.\nFather O'Molloy is on the platform and engaged.\"\n\n\"If you want to speak to the father, speak from where you are,\" said\nthe other collector. \"Here, silence! a gentleman wants to address the\nmeeting.\"\n\nAnd there was silence, and Lothair felt extremely embarrassed, but he\nwas not wanting, though it was the first time in his life that he had\naddressed a public meeting.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Lothair, \"I really had no wish to intrude upon you;\nall I desired was to speak to Father O'Molloy. I wished to tell him that\nit would have given me pleasure to subscribe to these schools. I am not\na Roman Catholic, but I respect the Roman Catholic religion. But I can\ndo nothing that will imply the slightest sanction of the opinions I\nhave heard expressed this evening. For your own sakes--\" but here a yell\narose which forever drowned his voice.\n\n\"A spy, a spy!\" was the general exclamation. \"We are betrayed! Seize\nhim! Knock him over!\" and the whole meeting seemed to have turned their\nbacks on the platform and to be advancing on the unfortunate Lothair.\nTwo of the leaders on the platform at the same time leaped down from it,\nto direct as it were the enraged populace.\n\nBut at this moment a man who had been in the lower part of the hall, in\nthe vicinity of Lothair and standing alone, pushed forward, and by his\ngestures and general mien arrested somewhat the crowd, so that the two\nleaders who leaped from the platform and bustled through the crowd came\nin contact with him.\n\nThe stranger was evidently not of the class or country of the rest\nassembled. He had a military appearance, and spoke with a foreign accent\nwhen he said, \"This is no spy. Keep your people off.\"\n\n\"And who are you?\" inquired the leader thus addressed.\n\n\"One accustomed to be obeyed,\" said the stranger.\n\n\"You may be a spy yourself,\" said the leader.\n\n\"I will not undertake to say that there are no spies in this room,\" said\nthe stranger, \"but this person is not one, and anybody who touches this\nperson will touch this person at his peril. Stand off, men!\" And they\nstood off. The wave retreated backward, leaving the two leaders in\nfront. A couple of hundred men, a moment before apparently full of\nfurious passion and ready to take refuge in the violence of fear, were\ncowed by a single human being.\n\n\"Why, you are not afraid of one man?\" said the leaders, ashamed of their\nfollowing. \"Whatever betides, no one unknown shall leave this room, or\nit will be Bow Street to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" said the stranger, \"two unknown men will leave this room\nand with general assent. If any one touches this person or myself I will\nshoot him dead,\" and he drew out his revolver, \"and as for the rest,\nlook at that,\" he added, giving a paper to the leader of the Fenian\nLodge, \"and then give it me back again.\"\n\nThe leader of the Fenian Lodge glanced at the paper; he grew pale, then\nscarlet, folded the paper with great care and returned it reverentially\nto the stranger, then looking round to the assembly and waving his hand\nhe said, \"All right, the gentlemen are to go.\"\n\n\"Well, you have got out of a scrape, young air,\" said the stranger to\nLothair when they had escaped from the hall.\n\n\"And how can I express my gratitude to you?\" Lothair replied.\n\n\"Poh!\" said the stranger, \"a mere affair of common duty. But what\nsurprises me is how you got your pass-ticket.\"\n\nLothair told him all.\n\n\"They manage their affairs in general wonderfully close,\" said the\nstranger, \"but I have no opinion of them. I have just returned from\nIreland, where I thought I would go and see what they really are after.\nNo real business in them. Their treason is a fairy tale, and their\nsedition a child talking in its sleep.\"\n\nThey walked together about half a mile, and then the stranger said, \"At\nthe end of this we shall get into the City Road, and the land again of\nomnibus and public conveyances, and I shall wish you good night.\"\n\n\"But it is distressing to me to part thus,\" said Lothair. \"Pray let me\ncall and pay my respects to my benefactor.\"\n\n\"No claim to any such title,\" said the stranger; \"I am always glad to\nbe of use. I will not trouble you to call on me, for, frankly, I have no\nwish to increase the circle of my acquaintance. So, good-night; and, as\nyou seem to be fond of a little life, take my advice, and never go about\nunarmed.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 28\n\n\nThe Fenian adventure furnished the distraction which Lothair required\nIt broke that absorbing spell of sentiment which is the delicious but\nenervating privilege of the youthful heart; yet, when Lothair woke in\nthe morning from his well-earned slumbers, the charm returned, and he\nfell at once into a reverie of Belmont, and a speculation when he might\nreally pay his first visit there. Not to-day--that was clearly out of\nthe question. They had separated only yesterday, and yet it seemed an\nage, and the adventure of another world. There are moods of feeling\nwhich defy alike time and space.\n\nBut on the morrow, Friday, he might venture to go. But, then, would\nto-morrow ever come? It seemed impossible. How were the intervening\nhours to pass? The world, however, was not so devoid of resources\nas himself, and had already appropriated his whole day. And, first,\nMonsignore Catesby came to breakfast with him, talking of every thing\nthat was agreeable or interesting, but in reality bent on securing his\npresence at the impending ecclesiastical ceremony of high import, where\nhis guardian was to officiate, and where the foundation was to be laid\nof the reconciliation of all churches in the bosom of the true one.\nThen, in the afternoon, Lothair had been long engaged to a match of\npigeon-shooting, in which pastime Bertram excelled. It seemed there was\nto be a most exciting sweepstakes to-day, in which the flower of England\nwere to compete; Lothair among them, and for the first time.\n\nThis great exploit of arms was to be accomplished at the Castle in the\nAir, a fantastic villa near the banks of the Thames, belonging to\nthe Duke of Brecon. His grace had been offended by the conduct or\nthe comments of the outer world, which in his pastime had thwarted or\ndispleased him in the free life of Battersea. The Duke of Brecon was a\ngentleman easily offended, but not one of those who ever confined their\nsense of injury to mere words. He prided himself on \"putting down\" any\nindividual or body of men who chose to come into collision with him. And\nso in the present instance he formed a club of pigeon-shooters, and\nlent them his villa for their rendezvous and enjoyment. The society was\nexquisite, exclusive, and greatly sought after. And the fine ladies,\ntempted, of course, by the beauty of the scene, honored and inspired the\ncompeting confederates by their presence.\n\nThe Castle in the Air was a colossal thatched cottage, built by a\nfavorite of, King George IV. It was full of mandarins and pagodas and\ngreen dragons, and papered with birds of many colors and with vast\ntails. The gardens were pretty, and the grounds park-like, with some\nnoble cedars and some huge walnut-trees.\n\nThe Duke of Brecon was rather below the middle size, but he had a\nsingularly athletic frame not devoid of symmetry. His head was well\nplaced on his broad shoulders, and his mien was commanding. He was\nnarrow-minded and prejudiced, but acute, and endowed with an unbending\nwill. He was an eminent sportsman, and brave even to brutality. His\nboast was that he had succeeded in every thing he had attempted, and he\nwould not admit the possibility of future failure. Though still a\nvery young man, he had won the Derby, training his own horse; and he\nsuccessfully managed a fine stud in defiance of the ring, whom it was\none of the secret objects of his life to extirpate. Though his manner\nto men was peremptory, cold, and hard, he might be described as popular,\nfor there existed a superstitious belief in his judgment, and it was\nknown that in some instances, when he had been consulted, he had given\nmore than advice. It could not be said that he was beloved, but he was\nfeared and highly considered. Parasites were necessary to him, though he\ndespised them.\n\nThe Duke of Brecon was an avowed admirer, of Lady Corisande, and was\nintimate with her family. The duchess liked him much, and was often seen\nat ball or assembly on his arm. He had such excellent principles, she\nsaid; was so straight-forward, so true and firm. It was whispered that\neven Lady Corisande had remarked that the Duke of Brecon was the only\nyoung man of the time who had \"character.\" The truth is, the duke,\nthough absolute and hard to men, could be soft and deferential to women,\nand such an exception to a general disposition has a charm. It was said,\nalso, that he had, when requisite, a bewitching smile.\n\nIf there were any thing or any person in the world that St. Aldegonde\nhated more than another, it was the Duke of Brecon. Why St. Aldegonde\nhated him was not very clear, for they had never crossed each other,\nnor were the reasons for his detestation, which he occasionally gave,\nentirely satisfactory: sometimes it was because the duke drove piebalds;\nsometimes because he had a large sum in the funds, which St. Aldegonde\nthought disgraceful for a duke; sometimes because he wore a particular\nhat, though, with respect to this last allegation, it does not follow\nthat St. Aldegonde was justified in his criticism, for in all these\nmatters St. Aldegonde was himself very deficient, and had once strolled\nup St. James's Street with his dishevelled looks crowned with a\nwide-awake. Whatever might be the cause, St. Aldegonde generally wound\nup--\"I tell you what, Bertha, if Corisande marries that follow, I have\nmade up my mind to go to the Indian Ocean. It is a country I never have\nseen, and Pinto tells me you cannot do it well under five years.\"\n\n\"I hope you will take me, Grenville, with you,\" said Lady St. Aldegonde,\n\"because it is highly probable Corisande will marry the duke; mamma, you\nknow, likes him so much.\"\n\n\"Why cannot Corisande marry Carisbrooke?\" said St. Aldegonde, pouting;\n\"he is a really good fellow, much better-looking, and so far as land is\nconcerned, which after all is the only thing, has as large an estate as\nthe duke.\"\n\n\"Well, these things depend a little upon taste,\" said Lady St.\nAldegonde.\n\n\"No, no,\" said St. Aldegonde; \"Corisande must marry Carisbrooke.\nYour father would not like my going to the Indian Archipelago and not\nreturning for five years, perhaps never returning. Why should Corisande\nbreak up our society?--why are people so selfish? I never could go to\nBrentham again if the Duke of Brecon is always to be there, giving his\nopinion, and being what your mother calls 'straightforward'--I hate a\nstraightforward fellow. As Pinto says, if every man were straightforward\nin his opinions, there would be no conversation. The fun of talk is to\nfind out what a man really thinks, then contrast it with the enormous\nlies he has been telling all dinner, and, perhaps, all his life.\"\n\nIt was a favorable day for the Castle in the Air; enough, but not\ntoo much sun, and a gentle breeze. Some pretty feet, not alone, were\nsauntering in the gardens, some pretty lips lingered in the rooms\nsipping tea; but the mass of the fair visitors, marvellously attired,\nwere assembled at the scene of action, seated on chairs and in groups,\nwhich assumed something of the form of an amphitheatre. There were many\ngentlemen in attendance on them, or independent spectators of the sport.\nThe field was large, not less than forty competitors, and comprising\nmany of the best shots in England. The struggle therefore, was long and\nably maintained; but, as the end approached, it was evident that the\ncontest would be between Bertram, Lothair, and the Duke of Brecon.\n\nLady St. Aldegonde and Lady Montairy were there and their unmarried\nsister. The married sisters were highly excited in favor of their\nbrother, but Lady Corisande said nothing. At last Bertram missed a\nbird, or rather his bird, which he had hit, escaped, and fell beyond the\nenclosure. Lothair was more successful, and it seemed that it might be\na tie between him and the duke. His grace, when called, advanced with\nconfident composure, and apparently killed both his birds, when, at\nthis moment, a dog rushed forward and chased one of the mortally-struck\npigeons. The blue-rock, which was content to die by the hand of a duke,\nwould not deign to be worried by a dog, and it frantically moved its\nexpiring wings, scaled the paling, and died. So Lothair won the prize.\n\n\"Well,\" said Lady Montairy to Lothair, \"as Bertram was not to win, I am\nglad it was you.\"\n\n\"And you will not congratulate me?\" said Lothair to Lady Corisande.\n\nShe rather shook her head. \"A tournament of doves,\" she said. \"I would\nrather see you all in the lists of Ashby.\"\n\nLothair had to dine this day with one of the vanquished. This was Mr.\nBrancepeth, celebrated for his dinners, still more for his guests. Mr.\nBrancepeth was a grave young man. It was supposed that he was always\nmeditating over the arrangement of his menus, or the skilful means by\nwhich he could assemble together the right persons to partake of them.\nMr. Brancepeth had attained the highest celebrity in his peculiar\ncareer. To dine with Mr. Brancepeth was a social incident that was\nmentioned. Royalty had consecrated his banquets, and a youth of note was\nscarcely a graduate of society who had not been his guest. There was one\nperson, however, who, in this respect, had not taken his degree, and, as\nalways happens under such circumstances, he was the individual on\nwhom Mr. Brancepeth was most desirous to confer it; and this was St.\nAldegonde. In vain Mr. Brancepeth had approached him with vast cards of\ninvitation to hecatombs, and with insinuating little notes to dinners\nsans fa on; proposals which the presence of princes might almost\nconstrue into a command, or the presence of some one even more\nattractive than princes must invest with irresistible charm. It was all\nin vain. \"Not that I dislike Brancepeth,\" said St. Aldegonde; \"I rather\nlike him: I like a man who can do only one thing, but does that well.\nBut then I hate dinners.\"\n\nBut the determined and the persevering need never despair of gaining\ntheir object in this world. And this very day, riding home from the\nCastle in the Air, Mr. Brancepeth overtook St. Aldegonde, who was\nlounging about on a rough Scandinavian cob, as dishevelled as himself,\nlistless and groomless. After riding together for twenty minutes, St.\nAldegonde informed Mr. Brancepeth, as was his general custom with his\ncompanions, that he was bored to very extinction, and that he did not\nknow what he should do with himself for the rest of the day. \"If I could\nonly get Pinto to go with me, I think I would run down to the Star and\nGarter, or perhaps to Hampton Court.\"\n\n\"You will not be able to get Pinto today,\" said Mr. Brancepeth, \"for he\ndines with me.\"\n\n\"What an unlucky fellow I am!\" exclaimed St. Aldegonde, entirely to\nhimself. \"I had made up my mind to dine with Pinto to-day.\"\n\n\"And why should you not? Why not meet Pinto at my house?\"\n\n\"Well, that is not my way,\" said St. Aldegonde, but not in a decided\ntone. \"You know I do not like strangers, and crowds of wine-glasses, and\nwhat is called all the delicacies of the season.\"\n\n\"You will meet no one that you do not know and like. It is a little\ndinner I made for--\" and he mentioned Lothair.\n\n\"I like Lothair,\" said St. Aldegonde, dreamily. \"He is a nice boy.\"\n\n\"Well, you will have him and Pinto to yourself.\"\n\nThe large fish languidly rose and swallowed the bait, and the exulting\nMr. Brancepeth cantered off to Hill Street to give the necessary\ninstructions.\n\nMr. Pinto was one of the marvels of English society; the most sought\nafter of all its members, though no one could tell you exactly why. He\nwas a little oily Portuguese, middle-aged, corpulent, and somewhat bald,\nwith dark eyes of sympathy, not unmixed with humor. No one knew who he\nwas, and in a country the most scrutinizing as to personal details, no\none inquired or cared to know. A quarter of a century ago an English\nnoble had caught him in his travels, and brought him young to England,\nwhere he had always remained. From the favorite of an individual, he had\nbecome the oracle of a circle, and then the idol of society. All this\ntime his manner remained unchanged. He was never at any time either\nhumble or pretentious. Instead of being a parasite, everybody flattered\nhim; and instead of being a hanger-on of society, society hung on Pinto.\n\nIt must have been the combination of many pleasing qualities, rather\nthan the possession of any commanding one, that created his influence.\nHe certainly was not a wit yet he was always gay, and always said\nthings that made other people merry. His conversation was sparkling,\ninteresting, and fluent, yet it was observed he never gave an opinion\non any subject and never told an anecdote. Indeed, he would sometimes\nremark, when a man fell into his anecdotage, it was a sign for him to\nretire from the world. And yet Pinto rarely opened his mouth without\neverybody being stricken with mirth. He had the art of viewing common\nthings in a fanciful light, and the rare gift of raillery which\nflattered the self-love of those whom it seemed sportively not to spare.\nSometimes those who had passed a fascinating evening with Pinto would\ntry to remember on the morrow what he had said, and could recall\nnothing. He was not an intellectual Croesus, but his pockets were full\nof six-pences.\n\nOne of the ingredients of his social spell was no doubt his manner,\nwhich was tranquil even when he was droll. He never laughed except with\nhis eyes, and delivered himself of his most eccentric fancies in an\nunctuous style. He had a rare gift of mimicry, which he used with\nextreme reserve, and therefore was proportionately effective when\ndisplayed. Add to all this, a sweet voice, a soft hand, and a\ndisposition both soft and sweet, like his own Azores. It was understood\nthat Pinto was easy in his circumstances, though no one know where these\ncircumstances were. His equipage was worthy of his position, and in his\nlittle house in May Fair he sometimes gave a dinner to a fine lady, who\nwas as proud of the event as the Queen of Sheba of her visit to Solomon\nthe Great.\n\nWhen St. Aldegonde arrived in Hill Street, and slouched into the saloon\nwith as uncouth and graceless a general mien as a handsome and naturally\ngraceful man could contrive to present, his keen though listless glance\nat once revealed to him that he was as he described it at dinner to Hugo\nBohun in a social jungle, in which there was a great herd of animals\nthat he particularly disliked, namely, what he entitled \"swells.\" The\nscowl on his distressed countenance at first intimated a retreat; but\nafter a survey, courteous to his host, and speaking kindly to Lothair as\nhe passed on, he made a rush to Mr. Pinto, and, cordially embracing him,\nsaid, \"Mind we sit together.\"\n\nThe dinner was not a failure, though an exception to the polished\nceremony of the normal Brancepeth banquet. The host headed his table,\nwith the Duke of Brecon on his right and Lothair on his left hand, and\n\"swells\" of calibre in their vicinity; but St. Aldegonde sat far away,\nnext to Mr. Pinto, and Hugo Bohun on the other side of that gentleman.\nHugo Bohun loved swells, but he loved St. Aldegonde more. The general\nconversation in the neighborhood of Mr. Brancepeth did not flag: they\ntalked of the sport of the morning, and then, by association of ideas,\nof every other sport. And then from the sports of England they ranged\nto the sports of every other country. There were several there who had\ncaught salmon in Norway and killed tigers in Bengal, and visited those\ncountries only for that purpose. And then they talked of horses, and\nthen they talked of women.\n\nLothair was rather silent; for in this society of ancients, the youngest\nof whom was perhaps not less than five-and-twenty, and some with nearly\na lustre added to that mature period, he felt the awkward modesty of\na freshman. The Duke of Brecon talked much, but never at length. He\ndecided every thing, at least to his own satisfaction; and if his\nopinion were challenged, remained unshaken, and did not conceal it.\n\nAll this time a different scene was enacting at the other end of the\ntable. St. Aldegonde, with his back turned to his other neighbor, hung\nupon the accents of Mr. Pinto, and Hugo Bohun imitated St. Aldegonde.\nWhat Mr. Pinto said or was saying was quite inaudible, for he always\nspoke low, and in the present case he was invisible, like an ortolan\nsmothered in vine-leaves; but every now and then St. Aldegonde broke\ninto a frightful shout, and Hugo Bohun tittered immensely. Then St.\nAldegonde, throwing himself back in his chair, and talking to himself or\nthe ceiling, would exclaim, \"Best thing I ever heard,\" while Hugo nodded\nsympathy with a beaming smile.\n\nThe swells now and then paused in their conversation and glanced at the\nscene of disturbance.\n\n\"They seem highly amused there,\" said Mr. Brancepeth. \"I wish they would\npass it on.\"\n\n\"I think St. Aldegonde,\" said the Duke of Brecon, \"is the least\nconventional man of my acquaintance.\"\n\nNotwithstanding this stern sneer, a practiced general like Mr.\nBrancepeth felt he had won the day. All his guests would disperse and\ntell the world that they had dined with him and met St. Aldegonde,\nand to-morrow there would be a blazoned paragraph in the journals\ncommemorating the event, and written as if by a herald. What did a\nlittle disturb his hospitable mind was that St. Aldegonde literally\ntasted nothing. He did not care so much for his occasionally leaning on\nthe table with both his elbows, but that he should pass by every dish\nwas distressing. So Mr. Brancepeth whispered to his own valet--a fine\ngentleman, who stood by his master's chair and attended on no one else,\nexcept, when requisite, his master's immediate neighbor--and desired him\nto suggest to St. Aldegonde whether the side-table might not provide,\nunder the difficulties, some sustenance. St. Aldegonde seemed quite\ngratified by the attention, and said he should like to have some cold\nmeat. Now, that was the only thing the side-table, bounteous as was its\ndisposition, could not provide. All the joints of the season were named\nin vain, and pies and preparations of many climes. But nothing would\nsatisfy St. Aldegonde but cold meat.\n\n\"Well, now I shall begin my dinner,\" he said to Pinto, when he was at\nlength served. \"What surprises me most in you is your English. There is\nnot a man who speaks such good English as you do.\"\n\n\"English is an expressive language,\" said Mr. Pinto, \"but not difficult\nto master. Its range is limited. It consists, as far as I can observe,\nof four words: 'nice,' 'jolly,' 'charming,' and 'bore;' and some\ngrammarians add 'fond.'\"\n\nWhen the guests rose and returned to the saloon, St. Aldegonde was in\nhigh spirits, and talked to every one, even to the Duke of Brecon, whom\nhe considerately reminded of his defeat in the morning, adding that from\nwhat he had seen of his grace's guns he had no opinion of them, and that\nhe did not believe that breech-loaders suited pigeon-shooting.\n\nFinally, when he bade farewell to his host, St. Aldegonde assured him\nthat he \"never in his life made so good a dinner, and that Pinto had\nnever been so rich.\"\n\nWhen the party broke up, the majority of the guests went, sooner or\nlater, to a ball that was given this evening by Lady St. Jerome. Others,\nwho never went to balls, looked forward with refined satisfaction to a\nnight of unbroken tobacco. St. Aldegonde went to play whist at the house\nof a lady who lived out of town. \"I like the drive home,\" he said; \"the\nmorning air is so refreshing when one has lost one's money.\"\n\nA ball at St. Jerome House was a rare event, but one highly appreciated.\nIt was a grand mansion, with a real suite of state apartments, including\na genuine ballroom in the Venetian style, and lighted with chandeliers\nof rock-crystal. Lady St. Jerome was a woman of taste and splendor and\nromance, who could do justice to the scene and occasion. Even Lord St.\nJerome, quiet as he seemed, in these matters was popular with young men.\nIt was known that Lord St. Jerome gave, at his ball suppers, the same\nchampagne that he gave at his dinners, and that was of the highest\nclass. In short, a patriot. We talk with wondering execration of the\ngreat poisoners of past ages, the Borgias, the inventor of aqua tofana,\nand the amiable Marchioness de Brinvilliers; but Pinto was of opinion\nthat there were more social poisoners about in the present day than in\nthe darkest, and the most demoralized periods, and then none of them are\npunished; which is so strange, he would add, as they are all found out.\n\nLady St. Jerome received Lothair, as Pinto said, with extreme unction.\nShe looked in his eyes, she retained his hand, she said that what she\nhad heard had made her so happy. And then, when he was retiring, she\nbeckoned him back and said she must have some tea, and, taking his arm,\nthey walked away together. \"I have so much to tell you,\" she said,\n\"and every thing is so interesting. I think we are on the eve of great\nevents. The monsignore told me your heart was with us. It must be. They\nare your own thoughts, your own wishes. We are realizing your own\nideal. I think next Sunday will be remembered as a great day in English\nhistory; the commencement of a movement that may save every thing. The\nmonsignore, I know, has told you all.\"\n\nNot exactly; the Oxford visit had deranged a little the plans of the\nmonsignore, but he had partially communicated the vast scheme. It\nseems there was a new society to be instituted for the restoration of\nChristendom. The change of name from Christendom to Europe had proved a\nfailure and a disastrous one. \"And what wonder?\" said Lady St. Jerome.\n\"Europe is not even a quarter of the globe, as the philosophers\npretended it was. There is already a fifth division, and probably there\nwill be many more, as the philosophers announce it impossible.\" The\ncardinal was to inaugurate the institution on Sunday next at the\nJesuits' Church, by one of his celebrated sermons. It was to be a\nfunction of the highest class. All the faithful of consideration were to\nattend, but the attendance was not to be limited to the faithful. Every\nsincere adherent of church principles who was in a state of prayer and\npreparation, was solicited to be present and join in the holy and common\nwork of restoring to the Divine Master His kingdom upon earth with its\nrightful name.\n\nIt was a brilliant ball. All the \"nice\" people in London were there. All\nthe young men who now will never go to balls were present. This was from\nrespect to the high character of Lord St. Jerome. Clare Arundel looked\ndivine, dressed in a wondrous white robe garlanded with violets, just\narrived from Paris, a present from her god-mother, the Duchess of\nLorrain-Sehulenbourg. On her head a violet-wreath, deep and radiant\nas her eyes, and which admirably contrasted with her dark golden-brown\nhair.\n\nLothair danced with her, and never admired her more. Her manner toward\nhim was changed. It was attractive, even alluring. She smiled on him,\nshe addressed him in tones of sympathy, even of tenderness. She seemed\ninterested in all he was doing; she flattered him by a mode which is\nsaid to be irresistible to a man, by talking only of himself. When\nthe dance had finished, he offered to attend her to the tea-room. She\naccepted the invitation even with cordiality.\n\n\"I think I must have some tea,\" she said, \"and I like to go with my\nkinsman.\"\n\nJust before supper was announced, Lady St. Jerome told Lothair, to his\nsurprise, that he was to attend Miss Arundel to the great ceremony. \"It\nis Clare's ball,\" said Lady St. Jerome, \"given in her honor, and you are\nto take care of her.\"\n\n\"I am more than honored,\" said Lothair. \"But does Miss Arundel wish it,\nfor, to tell you the truth, I thought I had rather abused her indulgence\nthis evening?\"\n\n\"Of course she wishes it,\" said Lady St. Jerome. \"Who should lead her\nout on such an occasion--her own ball--than the nearest and dearest\nrelation she has in the world, except ourselves?\"\n\nLothair made no reply to this unanswerable logic, but was as surprised\nas he was gratified. He recalled the hour when the kinship was, at the\nbest, but coldly recognized, the inscrutable haughtiness, even distrust,\nwith which Miss Arundel listened to the exposition of his views and\nfeelings, and the contrast which her past mood presented to her present\nbrilliant sympathy and cordial greeting. But he yielded to the magic of\nthe flowing hour. Miss Arundel, seemed, indeed, quite a changed being\nto-night, full of vivacity, fancy, feeling--almost fun. She was witty,\nand humorous, and joyous, and fascinating. As he fed her with cates as\ndelicate as her lips, and manufactured for her dainty beverages which\nwould not outrage their purity, Lothair, at last, could not refrain from\nintimating his sense of her unusual but charming joyousness.\n\n\"No,\" she said, turning round with animation, \"my natural disposition,\nalways repressed, because I have felt overwhelmed by the desolation of\nthe world. But now I have hope; I have more than hope, I have joy. I\nfeel sure this idea of the restoration of Christendom comes from Heaven.\nIt has restored me to myself, and has given me a sense of happiness in\nthis life which I never could contemplate. But what is the climax of my\njoy is, that you, after all my own blood, and one in whose career I have\never felt the deepest interest, should be ordained to lay, as it were,\nthe first stone of this temple of divine love.\"\n\nIt was break of day when Lothair jumped into his brougham. \"Thank\nHeaves,\" he exclaimed, \"it is at last Friday!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 29\n\n\nThere is something very pleasant in a summer suburban ride in the valley\nof the Thames. London transforms itself into bustling Knightsbridge, and\nairy Brompton, brightly and gracefully, lingers cheerfully in the long,\nmiscellaneous, well-watered King's-road, and only says farewell when\nyou come to an abounding river and a picturesque bridge. The boats were\nbright upon the waters when Lothair crossed it, and his dark chestnut\nbarb, proud of its resplendent form, curveted with joy when it reached\na green common, studded occasionally with a group of pines and well\nbedecked with gorse. After this he pursued the public road for a couple\nof miles until he observed on his left hand a gate on which was written\n\"private road,\" and here he stopped. The gate was locked, but, when\nLothair assured the keeper that he was about to visit Belmont, he was\npermitted to enter.\n\nHe entered a green and winding lane, fringed with tall elms, and dim\nwith fragrant shade, and, after proceeding about half a mile, came to a\nlong, low-built lodge, with a thatched and shelving roof, and surrounded\nby a rustic colonnade covered with honeysuckle. Passing through the gate\nat hand, he found himself in a road winding through gently-undulating\nbanks of exquisite turf, studded with rare shrubs, and, occasionally,\nrarer trees. Suddenly the confined scene expanded; wide lawns spread\nout before him, shadowed with the dark forms of many huge cedars, and\nblazing with flower-beds of every hue. The house was also apparent, a\nstately mansion of hewn stone, with wings and a portico of Corinthian\ncolumns, and backed by deep woods.\n\nThis was Belmont, built by a favorite minister of state, to whom a\ngrateful and gracious sovereign had granted a slice of a royal park\nwhereon to raise a palace and a garden, and find occasionally Tusculan\nrepose.\n\nThe lady of the mansion was at home, and, though Lothair was quite\nprepared for this, his heart beat. The inner hall was of noble\nproportion, and there were ranged in it many Roman busts, and some\nancient slabs and altars of marble. These had been collected some\ncentury ago by the minister; but what immediately struck the eye of\nLothair were two statues by an American artist, and both of fame, the\nSybil and the Cleopatra. He had heard of these, but had never seen\nthem, and could not refrain from lingering a moment to gaze upon their\nmystical and fascinating beauty.\n\nHe proceeded through two spacious and lofty chambers, of which it was\nevident the furniture was new. It was luxurious and rich, and full of\ntaste; but there was no attempt to recall the past in the details; no\ncabinets and clocks of French kings, or tables of French queens, no\nchairs of Venetian senators, no candelabra, that had illumined Doges\nof Genoa, no ancient porcelain of rare schools, and ivory carvings and\nchoice enamels. The walls were hung with master-pieces of modern art,\nchiefly of the French school, Ingres and Delaroche and Scheffer.\n\nThe last saloon led into a room of smaller dimensions, opening on the\ngarden, and which Lothair at first thought must be a fernery, it\nseemed so full of choice and expanding specimens of that beautiful and\nmultiform plant; but, when his eye had become a little accustomed to the\nscene and to the order of the groups, he perceived they were only the\nrefreshing and profuse ornaments of a regularly furnished and inhabited\napartment. In its centre was a table covered with writing-materials and\nbooks and some music. There was a chair before the table, so placed as\nif some one had only recently quitted it; a book was open, but turned\nupon its face, with an ivory cutter by its side. It would seem that the\ndweller in the chamber might not be far distant. The servant invited\nLothair to be seated, and, saying that Mrs. Campian must be in the\ngarden, proceeded to inform his mistress of the arrival of a guest.\n\nThe room opened on a terrace adorned with statues and orange-trees, and\ndescending gently into a garden in the Italian style, in the centre\nof which was a marble fountain of many figures. The grounds were not\nextensive, but they were only separated from the royal park by a wire\nfence, so that the scene seemed alike rich and illimitable. On the\nboundary was a summer-house in the shape of a classic temple, one of\nthose pavilions of pleasure which nobles loved to raise in the last\ncentury.\n\nAs Lothair beheld the scene with gratification, the servant reappeared\non the step of the terrace and invited him to descend. Guiding him\nthrough the garden, the servant retired as Lothair recognized Mrs.\nCampian approaching them.\n\nShe gave her hand to Lothair and welcomed him cordially but with\nserenity. They mutually exchanged hopes that their return to town had\nbeen agreeable. Lothair could not refrain from expressing how pleased he\nwas with Belmont.\n\n\"I am glad you approve of our hired home,\" said Theodora; \"I think we\nwere fortunate in finding one that suits our tastes and habits. We love\npictures and statues and trees and flowers, and yet we love our friends,\nand our friends are people who live in cities.\"\n\n\"I think I saw two statues to-day of which I have often heard,\" said\nLothair.\n\n\"The Sibyl and Cleopatra! Yes Colonel Campian is rather proud of\npossessing them. He collects only modern art, for which I believe there\nis a great future, though some of our friends think it is yet in its\ncradle.\"\n\n\"I am very sorry to say,\" said Lothair, \"that I know very little about\nart, or indeed any thing else, but I admire what is beautiful. I know\nsomething about architecture, at least church architecture.\"\n\n\"Well, religion has produced some of our finest buildings,\" said\nTheodora; \"there is no question of that; and as long as they are adapted\nto what takes place in them they are admirable. The fault I find in\nmodern churches in this country is, that there is little relation\nbetween the ceremonies and the structure. Nobody seems now conscious\nthat every true architectural form has a purpose. But I think the climax\nof confused ideas is capped when dissenting chapels are built like\ncathedrals.\"\n\n\"Ah! to build a cathedral!\" exclaimed Lothair, \"that is a great\nenterprise. I wish I might show you some day some drawings I have of a\nprojected cathedral.\"\n\n\"A projected cathedral!\" said Theodora. \"Well, I must confess to you I\nnever could comprehend the idea of a Protestant cathedral.\"\n\n\"But I am not quite sure,\" said Lothair, blushing and agitated, \"that it\nwill be a Protestant cathedral. I have not made up my mind about that.\"\n\nTheodora glanced at him, unobserved, with her wonderful gray eyes; a\nsort of supernatural light seemed to shoot from beneath their long dark\nlashes and read his inmost nature. They were all this time returning, as\nshe had suggested, to the house. Rather suddenly she said, \"By-the-by,\nas you are so fond of art, I ought to have asked you whether you would\nlike to see a work by the sculptor of Cleopatra, which arrived when we\nwere at Oxford. We have placed it on a pedestal in the temple. It is the\nGenius of Freedom. I may say I was assisting at its inauguration when\nyour name was announced to me.\"\n\nLothair caught at this proposal, and they turned and approached the\ntemple. Some workmen were leaving the building as they entered, and one\nor two lingered.\n\nUpon a pedestal of porphyry rose the statue of a female in marble.\nThough veiled with drapery which might have become the Goddess of\nModesty, admirable art permitted the contour of the perfect form to be\ntraced. The feet were without sandals, and the undulating breadth of\none shoulder, where the drapery was festooned, remained uncovered. One\nexpected with such a shape some divine visage. That was not wanting;\nbut humanity was asserted in the transcendent brow, which beamed with\nsublime thought and profound enthusiasm.\n\nSome would have sighed that such beings could only be pictured in a\npoet's or an artist's dream, but Lothair felt that what he beheld with\nrapture was no ideal creation, and that he was in the presence of the\ninspiring original.\n\n\"It is too like!\" he murmured.\n\n\"It is the most successful recurrence to the true principles of art in\nmodern sculpture,\" said a gentleman on his right hand.\n\nThis person was a young man, though more than ten years older than\nLothair. His appearance was striking. Above the middle height, his form,\nathletic though lithe and symmetrical, was crowned by a countenance\naquiline but delicate, and from many circumstances of a remarkable\nradiancy. The lustre of his complexion, the fire of his eye, and his\nchestnut hair in profuse curls, contributed much to this dazzling\neffect. A thick but small mustache did not conceal his curved lip or the\nscornful pride of his distended nostril, and his beard, close but not\nlong, did not veil the singular beauty of his mouth. It was an arrogant\nface, daring and vivacious, yet weighted with an expression of deep and\nhaughty thought.\n\nThe costume of this gentleman was rich and picturesque. Such\nextravagance of form and color is sometimes encountered in the\nadventurous toilet of a country house, but rarely experienced in what\nmight still be looked upon as a morning visit in the metropolis.\n\n\"You know Mr. Phoebus?\" asked a low, clear voice, and turning round\nLothair was presented to a person so famous that even Lothair had heard\nof him.\n\nMr. Phoebus was the most successful, not to say the most eminent,\npainter of the age. He was the descendant of a noble family of Gascony\nthat had emigrated to England from France in the reign of Louis XIV.\nUnquestionably they had mixed their blood frequently during the interval\nand the vicissitudes of their various life; but, in Gaston Phoebus,\nNature, as is sometimes her wont, had chosen to reproduce exactly the\noriginal type. He was the Gascon noble of the sixteenth century, with\nall his brilliancy, bravery, and boastfulness, equally vain, arrogant,\nand eccentric, accomplished in all the daring or the graceful pursuits\nof man, yet nursed in the philosophy of our times.\n\n\"It is presumption in my talking about such things,\" said Lothair; \"but\nmight I venture to ask what you may consider the true principles of\nart?\"\n\n\"ARYAN principles,\" said Mr. Phoebus; \"not merely the study of Nature,\nbut of beautiful Nature; the art of design in a country inhabited by\na first-rate race, and where the laws, the manners, the customs, are\ncalculated to maintain the health and beauty of a first-rate race. In\na greater or less degree, these conditions obtained from the age of\nPericles to the age of Hadrian in pure Aryan communities, but Semitism\nbegan then to prevail, and ultimately triumphed. Semitism has destroyed\nart; it taught man to despise his own body, and the essence of art is to\nhonor the human frame.\"\n\n\"I am afraid I ought not to talk about such things,\" said Lothair; \"but,\nif by Semitism you mean religion, surely the Italian painters inspired\nby Semitism did something.\"\n\n\"Great things,\" said Mr. Phoebus--\"some of the greatest. Semitism gave\nthem subjects, but the Renaissance gave them Aryan art, and it gave that\nart to a purely Aryan race. But Semitism rallied in the shape of the\nReformation, and swept all away. When Leo the Tenth was pope, popery was\npagan; popery is now Christian, and art is extinct.\"\n\n\"I cannot enter into such controversies,\" said Lothair. \"Every day I\nfeel more and more I am extremely ignorant.\"\n\n\"Do not regret it,\" said Mr. Phoebus. \"What you call ignorance is your\nstrength. By ignorance you mean a want of knowledge of books. Books are\nfatal; they are the curse of the human race. Nine-tenths of existing\nbooks are nonsense, and the clever books are the refutation of that\nnonsense. The greatest misfortune that ever befell man was the invention\nof printing. Printing has destroyed education. Art is a great thing, and\nScience is a great thing; but all that art and science can reveal can be\ntaught by man and by his attributes--his voice, his hand, his eye. The\nessence of education is the education of the body. Beauty and health\nare the chief sources of happiness. Men should live in the air; their\nexercises should be regular, varied, scientific. To render his body\nstrong and supple is the first duty of man. He should develop and\ncompletely master the whole muscular system. What I admire in the order\nto which you belong is that they do live in the air; that they excel in\nathletic sports; that they can only speak one language; and that they\nnever read. This is not a complete education, but it is the highest\neducation since the Greek.\"\n\n\"What you say I feel encouraging,\" said Lothair, repressing a smile,\n\"for I myself live very much in the air, and am fond of all sports;\nbut I confess I am often ashamed of being so poor a linguist, and was\nseriously thinking that I ought to read.\"\n\n\"No doubt every man should combine an intellectual with a physical\ntraining,\" replied Mr. Phoebus; \"but the popular conception of the means\nis radically wrong. Youth should attend lectures on art and science by\nthe most illustrious professors, and should converse together afterward\non what they have heard. They should learn to talk; it is a rare\naccomplishment, and extremely healthy. They should have music always at\ntheir meals. The theatre, entirely remodelled and reformed, and, under a\nminister of state, should be an important element of education. I should\nnot object to the recitation of lyric poetry. That is enough. I would\nnot have a book in the house, or even see a newspaper.\"\n\n\"These are Aryan principles?\" said Lothair.\n\n\"They are,\" said Mr. Phoebus; \"and of such principles, I believe,\na great revival is at hand. We shall both live to see another\nRenaissance.\"\n\n\"And our artist here,\" said Lothair, pointing to the statue, \"you are of\nopinion that he is asserting these principles?\"\n\n\"Yes; because he has produced the Aryan form by studying the Aryan form.\nPhidias never had a finer model, and he has not been unequal to it.\"\n\n\"I fancied,\" said Lothair, in a lower and inquiring tone, though Mrs.\nCampian had some time before glided out of the pavilion, and was giving\ndirections to the workmen--\"I fancied I had heard that Mrs. Campian was\na Roman.\"\n\n\"The Romans were Greeks,\" said Mr. Phoebus, \"and in this instance the\nPhidian type came out. It has not been thrown away. I believe Theodora\nhas inspired as many painters and sculptors as any Aryan goddess. I look\nupon her as such, for I know nothing more divine.\"\n\n\"I fear the Phidian type is very rare,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"In nature and in art there must always be surpassing instances,\" said\nMr. Phoebus. \"It is a law, and a wise one; but, depend upon it, so\nstrong and perfect a type as the original Aryan must be yet abundant\namong the millions, and may be developed. But for this you want great\nchanges in your laws. It is the first duty of a state to attend to the\nframe and health of the subject. The Spartans understood this. They\npermitted no marriage the probable consequences of which might be a\nfeeble progeny; they even took measures to secure a vigorous one. The\nRomans doomed the deformed to immediate destruction. The union of the\nraces concerns the welfare of the commonwealth much too nearly to\nbe intrusted to individual arrangement. The fate of a nation will\nultimately depend upon the strength and health of the population. Both\nFrance and England should look to this; they have cause. As for our\nmighty engines of war in the hands of a puny race, it will be the old\nstory of the lower empire and the Greek fire. Laws should be passed\nto secure all this, and some day they will be. But nothing can be done\nuntil the Aryan races are extricated from Semitism.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 30\n\n\nLothair returned to town in a not altogether satisfactory state of mind.\nHe was not serene or content. On the contrary, he was rather agitated\nand perplexed. He could not say he regretted his visit. He had seen her,\nand he had seen her to great advantage. He had seen much too that was\npleasing, and had heard also many things that, if not pleasing, were\ncertainly full of interest. And yet, when he cantered back over the\ncommon, the world somehow did not seem to him so bright and exhilarating\nas in the ambling morn. Was it because she was not alone? And yet why\nshould he expect she should be alone? She had many friends, and she was\nas accessible to them as to himself. And yet a conversation with her,\nas in the gardens of Blenheim, would have been delightful, and he had\nrather counted on it. Nevertheless, it was a great thing to know men\nlike Mr. Phoebus, and hear their views on the nature of things. Lothair\nwas very young, and was more thoughtful than studious. His education\nhitherto had been, according to Mr. Phoebus, on the right principle, and\nchiefly in the open air; but he was intelligent and susceptible, and in\nthe atmosphere of Oxford, now stirred with many thoughts, he had imbibed\nsome particles of knowledge respecting the primeval races which had\npermitted him to follow the conversation of Mr. Phoebus not absolutely\nin a state of hopeless perplexity. He determined to confer with Father\nColeman on the Aryan race and the genius of Semitism. As he returned\nthrough the park, he observed the duchess, and Lady Corisande in their\nbarouche, resting for a moment in the shade, with Lord Carisbrooke on\none side and the Duke of Brecon on the other.\n\nAs he was dressing for dinner, constantly brooding on one thought, the\ncause of his feeling of disappointment occurred to him. He had hoped\nin this visit to have established some basis of intimacy, and to have\nascertained his prospect and his means of occasionally seeing her. But\nhe had done nothing of the kind. He could not well call again at Belmont\nunder a week, but even then Mr. Phoebus or some one else might be there.\nThe world seemed dark. He wished he had never gone to Oxford. However\na man may plan his life, he is the creature of circumstances. The\nunforeseen happens and upsets every thing. We are mere puppets.\n\nHe sat next to an agreeable woman at dinner, who gave him an interesting\naccount of a new singer she had heard the night before at the opera--a\nfair Scandinavian, fresh as a lily and sweet as a nightingale.\n\n\"I was resolved to go and hear her,\" said the lady; \"my sister Feodore,\nat Paris, had written to me so much about her. Do you know, I have never\nbeen to the opera for an age! That alone was quite a treat to me. I\nnever go to the opera, nor to the play, nor to any thing else. Society\nhas become so large and so exacting, that I have found out one never\ngets any amusement.\"\n\n\"Do you know, I never was at the opera?\" said Lothair.\n\n\"I am not at all surprised; and when you go--which I suppose you will\nsome day--what will most strike you is, that you will not see a single\nperson you ever saw in your life.\"\n\n\"Strange!\"\n\n\"Yes; it shows what a mass of wealth and taste and refinement there is\nin this wonderful metropolis of ours, quite irrespective of the circles\nin which we move, and which we once thought entirely engrossed them.\"\n\nAfter the ladies had retired, Bertram, who dined at the same house,\nmoved up to him; and Hugo Bohun came over and took the vacant seat on\nhis other side.\n\n\"What have you been doing with yourself?\" said Hugo. \"We have not seen\nyou for a week.\"\n\n\"I went down to Oxford about some horses,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"Fancy going down to Oxford about some horses in the heart of the\nseason,\" said Hugo. \"I believe you are selling us, and that, as the\nScorpion announces, you are going to be married.\"\n\n\"To whom?\" said Lothair.\n\n\"Ah! that is the point. It is a dark horse at present, and we want you\nto tell us.\"\n\n\"Why do not you marry, Hugo?\" said Bertram.\n\n\"I respect the institution,\" said Hugo, \"which is admitting something in\nthese days; and I have always thought that every woman should marry, and\nno man.\"\n\n\"It makes a woman and it mars a man, you think?\" said Lothair.\n\n\"But I do not exactly see how your view would work practically,\" said\nBertram.\n\n\"Well my view is a social problem,\" said Hugo, \"and social problems are\nthe fashion at present. It would be solved through the exceptions,\nwhich prove the principle. In the first place, there are your swells\nwho cannot avoid the halter--you are booked when you are born; and then\nthere are moderate men like myself, who have their weak moments. I would\nnot answer for myself if I could find an affectionate family with good\nshooting and first-rate claret.\"\n\n\"There must be many families with such conditions,\" said Lothair.\n\nHugo shook his head. \"You try. Sometimes the wine is good and the\nshooting bad; sometimes the reverse; sometimes both are excellent, but\nthen the tempers and the manners are equally bad.\"\n\n\"I vote we three do something to-morrow,\" said Bertram.\n\n\"What shall it be?\" said Hugo.\n\n\"I vote we row down to Richmond at sunset and dine, and then drive our\nteams up by moonlight. What say you, Lothair?\"\n\n\"I cannot, I am engaged. I am engaged to go to the opera.\"\n\n\"Fancy going to the opera in this sweltering weather!\" exclaimed\nBertram.\n\n\"He must be going to be married,\" said Hugo.\n\nAnd yet on the following evening, though the weather was quite as sultry\nand he was not going to be married, to the opera Lothair went. While the\nagreeable lady the day before was dilating at dinner on this once famous\nentertainment, Lothair remembered that a certain person went there\nevery Saturday evening, and he resolved that he should at least have the\nsatisfaction of seeing her.\n\nIt was altogether a new scene for Lothair, and, being much affected by\nmusic, he found the general influence so fascinating that some little\ntime elapsed before he was sufficiently master of himself to recur to\nthe principal purpose of his presence. His box was on the first tier,\nwhere he could observe very generally and yet himself be sufficiently\nscreened. As an astronomer surveys the starry heavens until his\nsearching sight reaches the desired planet, so Lothair's scrutinizing\nvision wandered till his eye at length lighted on the wished-for orb.\nIn the circle above his own, opposite to him but nearer the stage, he\nrecognized the Campians. She had a star upon her forehead, as when he\nfirst met her some six months ago; it seemed an age.\n\nNow what should he do? He was quite unlearned in the social habits of\nan opera-house. He was not aware that he had the privilege of paying the\nlady a visit in her box, and, had he been so, he was really so shy in\nlittle things that he never could have summoned resolution to open the\ndoor of his own box and request an attendant to show him that of Mrs.\nCampian. He had contrived to get to the opera for the first time in his\nlife, and the effort seemed to have exhausted his social enterprise. So\nh remained still, with his glass fixed very constantly on Mrs. Campian,\nand occasionally giving himself up to the scene. The performance did not\nsustain the first impression. There were rival prima-donnas, and they\nindulged in competitive screams; the choruses were coarse, and\nthe orchestra much too noisy. But the audience were absorbed or\nenthusiastic. We may be a musical nation, but our taste would seem to\nrequire some refinement.\n\nThere was a stir in Mrs. Campian's box: a gentleman entered and seated\nhimself. Lothair concluded he was an invited guest, and envied him. In\nabout a quarter of an hour the gentleman bowed and retired, and another\nperson came in, and one whom Lothair recognized as a young man who had\nbeen sitting during the first act in a stall beneath him. The system of\npaying visits at the opera then flashed upon his intelligence, as some\ndiscovery in science upon a painful observer. Why should he not pay a\nvisit too? But how to do it? At last he was bold enough to open the door\nof his own box and go forth, but he could find no attendant, and some\npersons passing his open door, and nearly appropriating his lodge, in a\nfit of that nervous embarrassment which attends inexperience in little\nthings, he secured his rights by returning baffled to his post.\n\nThere had been a change in Mrs. Campian's box in the interval. Colonel\nCampian had quitted it, and Mr. Phoebus occupied his place. Whether it\nwere disappointment at his own failure or some other cause, Lothair\nfelt annoyed. He was hot and cold by turns; felt awkward and blundering;\nfancied people were looking at him; that in some inexplicable sense he\nwas ridiculous; wished he had never gone to the opera.\n\nAs time, and considerable time, elapsed, he became even miserable. Mr.\nPhoebus never moved, and Mrs. Campian frequently conversed with him.\nMore than one visitor had in the interval paid their respects to the\nlady, but Mr. Phoebus never moved. They did not stay, perhaps because\nMr. Phoebus never moved.\n\nLothair never liked that fellow from the first. Sympathy and antipathy\nshare our being as day and darkness share our lives. Lothair had felt\nan antipathy for Mr. Phoebus the moment he saw him. He had arrived at\nBelmont yesterday before Lothair, and he had outstayed him. These might\nbe Arian principles, but they were not the principles of good-breeding.\n\nLothair determined to go home, and never to come to the opera again. He\nopened the door of his box with firmness, and slammed it with courage;\nhe had quite lost his shyness, was indeed ready to run a muck with\nany one who crossed him. The slamming of the door summoned a scudding\nattendant from a distant post, who with breathless devotion inquired\nwhether Lothair wanted any thing.\n\n\"Yes, I want you to show me the way to Mrs. Campian's box.\"\n\n\"Tier above, No. 22,\" said the box-keeper.\n\n\"Ay, ay; but conduct me to it,\" said Lothair, and he presented the man\nwith an overpowering honorarium.\n\n\"Certainly, my lord,\" said the attendant.\n\n\"He knows me,\" thought Lothair; but it was not so. When the British\nnation is at once grateful and enthusiastic, they always call you \"my\nlord.\"\n\nBut in his progress, to \"No. 22, tier above,\" all his valor evaporated,\nand when the box-door was opened he felt very much like a convict on the\nverge of execution; he changed color, his legs tottered, his heart beat,\nand he made his bow with a confused vision. The serenity of Theodora\nsomewhat reassured him, and he seated himself, and even saluted Mr.\nPhoebus.\n\nThe conversation was vapid and conventional--remarks about the opera and\nits performers--even the heat of the weather was mentioned. Lothair had\ncome, and he had nothing to say. Mrs. Campian seemed much interested\nin the performance; so, if he had had any thing to say, there was no\nopportunity of expressing it. She had not appeared to be so engrossed\nwith the music before his arrival. In the mean time that Phoebus would\nnot move; a quarter of an hour elapsed, and that Phoebus would not move.\nLothair could not stand it any longer; he rose and bowed.\n\n\"Are you going?\" said Theodora. \"Colonel Campian will be here in a\nmoment; he will be quite grieved not to see you.\"\n\nBut Lothair was inflexible. \"Perhaps,\" she added, \"we may see you\nto-morrow night?\"\n\n\"Never,\" said Lothair to himself, as he clinched his teeth; \"my visit to\nBelmont was my first and my last. The dream is over.\"\n\nHe hurried to a club in which he had been recently Initiated, and of\nwhich the chief purpose is to prove to mankind that night to a wise man\nhas its resources as well as gaudy day. Here striplings mature their\nminds in the mysteries of whist, and stimulate their intelligence by\nplaying at stakes which would make their seniors look pale; here matches\nare made; and odds are settled, and the cares or enterprises of life\nare soothed or stimulated by fragrant cheroots or beakers of Badminton.\nHere, in the society of the listless and freakish St. Aldegonde, and\nHugo Bohun, and Bertram, and other congenial spirits, Lothair consigned\nto oblivion the rival churches of Christendom, the Aryan race, and the\ngenius of Semitism.\n\nIt was an hour past dawn when he strolled home. London is often\nbeautiful in summer at that hour, the architectural lines clear and\ndefined in the smokeless atmosphere, and ever and anon a fragrant gale\nfrom gardened balconies wafted in the blue air. Nothing is stirring\nexcept wagons of strawberries and asparagus, and no one visible except\na policeman or a member of Parliament returning from a late division,\nwhere they have settled some great question that need never have been\nasked. Eve has its spell of calmness and consolation, but dawn brings\nhope and joy.\n\nBut not to Lothair. Young, sanguine, and susceptible, he had, for a\nmoment, yielded to the excitement of the recent scene, but with his\nsenses stilled by the morning air, and free from the influence of\nBertram's ready sympathy, and Hugo Bohun's gay comments on human life,\nand all the wild and amusing caprice, and daring wilfulness, and grand\naffectation, that distinguish and inspire a circle of patrician youth,\nthere came over him the consciousness that to him something dark had\noccurred, something bitter and disappointing and humiliating, and that\nthe breaking morn would not bring to him a day so bright and hopeful as\nhis former ones.\n\nAt first he fell into profound slumber: it was the inevitable result of\nthe Badminton and the late hour. There was a certain degree of physical\nexhaustion which commanded repose. But the slumber was not long, and his\nfirst feeling, for it could not be called thought, was that some great\nmisfortune had occurred to him; and then the thought following the\nfeeling brought up the form of the hated Phoebus. After that he had no\nreal sleep, but a sort of occasional and feverish doze with intervals\nof infinite distress, waking always to a consciousness of inexpressible\nmortification and despair.\n\nAbout one o'clock, relinquishing all hope of real and refreshing\nslumber, he rang his bell, and his valet appearing informed him that\nFather Coleman had called, and the monsignore had called, and that now\nthe cardinal's secretary had just called, but the valet had announced\nthat his lord was indisposed. There was also a letter from Lady St.\nJerome. This news brought a new train of feeling. Lothair remembered\nthat this was the day of the great ecclesiastical function, under the\npersonal auspices of the cardinal, at which indeed Lothair hid never\npositively promised to assist, his presence at which he had sometimes\nthought they pressed unreasonably, not to say even indelicately, but\nat which he had perhaps led them, not without cause, to believe that he\nwould be present. Of late the monsignore had assumed that Lothair had\npromised to attend it.\n\nWhy should he not? The world was all vanity. Never did he feel more\nconvinced than at this moment of the truth of his conclusion, that if\nreligion were a real thing, man should live for it alone; but then came\nthe question of the Churches. He could not bring himself without a\npang to contemplate a secession from the Church of his fathers. He took\nrefuge in the wild but beautiful thought of a reconciliation between\nRome and England. If the consecration of the whole of his fortune to\nthat end could assist in effecting the purpose, he would cheerfully make\nthe sacrifice. He would then go on a pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre,\nand probably conclude his days in a hermitage on Mount Athos.\n\nIn the mean time he rose, and, invigorated by his bath, his thoughts\nbecame in a slight degree more mundane. They recurred to the events of\nthe last few days of his life, but in a spirit of self-reproach and of\nconscious vanity and weakness. Why, he had not known her a week! This\nwas Sunday morning, and last Sunday he had attended St. Mary's and\noffered up his earnest supplications for the unity of Christendom.\nThat was then his sovereign hope and thought. Singular that a casual\nacquaintance with a stranger, a look, a glance, a word, a nothing,\nshould have so disturbed his spirit and distracted his mind.\n\nAnd yet--\n\nAnd then he fell into an easy-chair, with a hair-brush in either hand,\nand conjured up in reverie all that had passed since that wondrous morn\nwhen he addressed her by the road-side, until the last dark hour when\nthey parted--and forever. There was not a word she had uttered to\nhim, or to any one else, that he did not recall; not a glance, not\na gesture--her dress, her countenance, her voice, her hair. And what\nscenes had all this passed in! What refined and stately loveliness!\nBlenheim, and Oxford, and Belmont! They became her. Ah! why could not\nlife consist of the perpetual society of such delightful people in such\ndelightful places?\n\nHis valet entered and informed him that the monsignore had returned, and\nwould not be denied. Lothair roused himself from his delicious reverie,\nand his countenance became anxious and disquieted. He would have\nstruggled against the intrusion, and was murmuring resistance to his\nhopeless attendant, who shook his head, when the monsignore glided into\nthe room without permission, as the valet disappeared.\n\nIt was a wonderful performance: the monsignore had at the same time\nto make a reconnoissance and to take up a position--to find out what\nLothair intended to do, and yet to act and speak as if he was acquainted\nwith those intentions, and was not only aware of, but approved them. He\nseemed hurried and yet tranquil, almost breathless with solicitude and\nyet conscious of some satisfactory consummation. His tones were at all\ntimes hushed, but to-day he spoke in a whisper, though a whisper of\nemphasis, and the dark eyes of his delicate aristocratic visage peered\ninto Lothair, even when he was making a remark which seemed to require\nno scrutiny.\n\n\"It is one of the most important days for England that have happened in\nour time,\" said the monsignore. \"Lady St. Jerome thinks of nothing else.\nAll our nobility will be there--the best blood in England--and some\nothers who sympathize with the unity of the Church, the real question.\nNothing has ever gratified the cardinal more than your intended\npresence. He sent to you this morning. He would have called himself, bat\nhe has much to go through today. His eminence said to me: 'It is exactly\nwhat I want. Whatever way be our differences, and they are really\nslight, what I want is to show to the world that the sons of the Church\nwill unite for the cause of Divine truth. It is the only course that can\nsave society.' When Lady St. Jerome told him that you were coming this\nevening, his eminence was so affected that--\"\n\n\"But I never said I was coming this evening,\" said Lothair, rather\ndryly, and resolved to struggle, \"either to Lady St. Jerome or to any\none else. I said I would think of it.\"\n\n\"But for a Christian to think of duty is to perform it,\" said the\nmonsignore. \"To be ignorant of a duty is a sin, but to be aware of duty,\nand not to fulfil it, is heinous.\"\n\n\"But is it a duty?\" said Lothair, rather doggedly.\n\n\"What! to serve God and save society? Do you doubt it? Have you read the\n'Declaration of Geneva?' They have declared war against the Church,\nthe state, and the domestic principle. All the great truths and laws\non which the family reposes are denounced. Have you seen Garibaldi's\nletter? When it was read, and spoke of the religion of God being\npropagated throughout the world, there was a universal cry of 'No, no!\nno religion!' But the religion of God was soon so explained as to allay\nall their fears. It is the religion of science. Instead of Adam, our\nancestry is traced to the most grotesque of creatures, thought is\nphosphorus, the soul complex nerves, and our moral sense a secretion of\nsugar. Do you want these views in England? Rest assured they are coming.\nAnd how are we to contend against them? Only by Divine truth. And where\nis Divine truth? In the Church of Christ--in the gospel of order, peace,\nand purity.\"\n\nLothair rose, and paced the room with his eyes on the ground.\n\n\"I wish I had been born in the middle ages,\" he exclaimed, \"or on the\nshores of the Sea of Galilee, or in some other planet: anywhere, or at\nany time, but in this country and in this age!\"\n\n\"That thought is not worthy of you, my lord,\" said Catesby. \"It is a\ngreat privilege to live in this country and in this age. It is a\ngreat privilege, in the mighty contest between the good and the evil\nprinciple, to combat for the righteous. They stand face to face now, as\nthey have stood before. There is Christianity, which, by revealing the\ntruth, has limited the license of human reason; there is that human\nreason which resists revelation as a bondage--which insists upon being\natheistical, or polytheistical, or pantheistical--which looks upon the\nrequirements of obedience, justice, truth, and purity, as limitations\nof human freedom. It is to the Church that God has committed the custody\nand execution of His truth and law. The Church, as witness, teacher, and\njudge, contradicts and offends the spirit of license to the quick. This\nis why it is hated; this is why it is to be destroyed, and why they\nare preparing a future of rebellion, tyranny, falsehood, and degrading\ndebauchery. The Church alone can save us, and you are asked to\nsupplicate the Almighty to-night, under circumstances of deep hope, to\nfavor the union of churchmen, and save the human race from the impending\ndeluge.\"\n\nLothair threw himself again into his seat and sighed. \"I am rather\nindisposed today, my dear monsignore, which is unusual with me, and\nscarcely equal to such a theme, doubtless of the deepest interest to\nme and to all. I myself wish, as you well know, that all mankind were\npraying under the same roof. I shall continue in seclusion this morning.\nPerhaps you will permit me to think over what you have said with so much\nbeauty and force.\"\n\n\"I had forgotten that I had a letter to deliver to you,\" said Catesby;\nand he drew from his breast-pocket a note which he handed to Lothair,\nwho opened it quite unconscious of the piercing and even excited\nobservation of his companion.\n\nLothair read the letter with a changing countenance, and then he read\nit again and blushed deeply. The letter was from Miss Arundel. After a\nslight pause, without looking up, he said, \"Nine o'clock is the hour, I\nbelieve.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the monsignore rather eagerly, \"but, were I you, I would be\nearlier than that. I would order my carnage at eight. If you will permit\nme, I will order it for you. You are not quite well. It will save you\nsome little trouble, people coming into the room and all that, and the\ncardinal will be there by eight o'clock.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Lothair; \"have the kindness then, my dear monsignore,\nto order my brougham for me at half-past eight and just say that I can\nsee no one. Adieu!\"\n\nAnd the priest glided away.\n\nLothair remained the whole morning in a most troubled state, pacing his\nrooms, leaning sometimes with his arm upon the mantel-piece, and his\nface buried in his arm, and often he sighed. About half-past five\nhe rang for his valet and, dressed, and in another hour he broke his\nfast--a little soup, a cutlet, and a glass or two of claret. And then he\nlooked at his watch; and he looked at his watch every five minutes for\nthe next hour.\n\nHe was in deep reverie, when the servant announced that his carriage was\nready. He started as from a dream, then pressed his hand to his eyes,\nand kept it there for some moments, and then, exclaiming, \"Jacta est\nalea,\" he descended the stairs.\n\n\"Where to, my lord?\" inquired the servant when he had entered the\ncarriage.\n\nLothair seemed to hesitate, and then he said, \"To Belmont.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 31\n\n\n\"Belmont is the only house I know that is properly lighted,\" said Mr.\nPhoebus, and he looked with complacent criticism round the brilliant\nsaloons. \"I would not visit any one who had gas in his house; but even\nin palaces I find lamps--it is too dreadful. When they came here first,\nthere was an immense chandelier suspended in each of these rooms,\npulling down the ceilings, dwarfing the apartments, leaving the guests\nall in darkness, and throwing all the light on the roof. The chandelier\nis the great abomination of furniture; it makes a noble apartment look\nsmall. And then they say you cannot light rooms without chandeliers!\nLook at these--need any thing be more brilliant? And all the light in\nthe right place--on those who are in the chamber. All light should come\nfrom the side of a room, and if you choose to have candelabra like these\nyou can always secure sufficient.\"\n\nTheodora was seated on a sofa, in conversation with a lady of\ndistinguished mien and with the countenance of a Roman empress. There\nwere various groups in the room, standing or seated. Colonel Campian was\nattending a lady to the piano where a celebrity presided, a gentleman\nwith cropped head and a long black beard. The lady was of extraordinary\nbeauty--one of those faces one encounters in Asia Minor, rich, glowing,\nwith dark fringed eyes of tremulous lustre; a figure scarcely less\nstriking, of voluptuous symmetry. Her toilet was exquisite--perhaps\na little too splendid for the occasion, but abstractedly of fine\ntaste--and she held, as she sang, a vast bouquet entirely of white\nstove-flowers. The voice was as sweet as the stephanopolis, and the\nexecution faultless. It seemed the perfection of chamber-singing--no\nshrieks and no screams, none of those agonizing experiments which result\nfrom the fatal competition of rival prima-donnas.\n\nShe was singing when Lothair was ushered in. Theodora rose and greeted\nhim with friendliness. Her glance was that of gratification at his\narrival, but the performance prevented any conversation save a few\nkind remarks interchanged in a hashed tone. Colonel Campian came up: he\nseemed quite delighted at renewing his acquaintance with Lothair, and\nbegan to talk rather too loudly, which made some of the gentlemen\nnear the piano turn round with glances of wondering reproach. This\nembarrassed his newly-arrived guest, who in his distress caught the bow\nof a lady who recognized him, and whom he instantly remembered as Mrs.\nPutney Giles. There was a vacant chair by her side, and he was glad to\noccupy it.\n\n\"Who is that lady?\" inquired Lothair of his companion, when the singing\nceased.\n\n\"That is Madame Phoebus,\" said Mrs. Giles.\n\n\"Madame Phoebus!\" exclaimed Lothair, with an unconscious feeling of some\nrelief. \"She is a very beautiful woman. Who was she?\"\n\n\"She is a Cantacuzene, a daughter of the famous Greek merchant. The\nCantcuzenes, you know, are great people, descendants of the Greek\nemperors. Her uncle is prince of Samos. Mr. Cantacuzene was very much\nopposed to the match, but I think quite wrong. Mr. Phoebus is a most\ndistinguished man, and the alliance is of the happiest. Never was such\nmutual devotion.\"\n\n\"I am not surprised,\" said Lothair, wonderfully relieved.\n\n\"Her sister Euphrosyne is in the room,\" continued Mrs. Giles, \"the most\nextraordinary resemblance to her. There is just the difference between\nthe matron and the maiden; that is all. They are nearly of the same age,\nand before the marriage might have been mistaken for each other.\nThe most charming thing in the world is to hear the two sisters sing\ntogether. I hope they may to-night. I know the family very well. It was\nMrs. Cantacuzene who introduced me to Theodora. You know it is quite en\nr gle to call her Theodora. All the men call her Theodora; 'the divine\nTheodora' is, I believe, the right thing.\"\n\n\"And do you call her Theodora?\" asked Lothair, rather dryly.\n\n\"Why, no,\" said Mrs. Giles, a little confused. \"We are not intimate, at\nleast not very, Ms. Campian has been at my house, and I have been here\ntwo et three times; not so often as I could wish, for Mr. Giles, you\nsee, does not like servants and horses to be used on Sundays--and no\nmore do I--and on weekdays he is too much engaged or too tired to come\nout this distance; so you see--\"\n\nThe singing had ceased, and Theodora approached them. Addressing\nLothair, she said: \"The Princess of Tivoli wishes that you should be\npresented to her.\"\n\nThe Princess of Tivoli was a Roman dame of one of the most illustrious\nhouses, but who now lived at Paris. She had in her time taken an active\npart in Italian politics, and had sacrificed to the cause to which she\nwas devoted the larger part of a large fortune. What had been spared,\nhowever, permitted her to live in the French capital with elegance, if\nnot with splendor; and her saloon was the gathering roof, in Paris,\nof almost every one who was celebrated for genius or accomplishments.\nThough reputed to be haughty and capricious, she entertained for\nTheodora an even passionate friendship, and now visited England only to\nsee her.\n\n\"Madame Campian has been telling me of all the kind things you did for\nher at Oxford,\" said the princess. \"Some day you must show me Oxford,\nbut it must be next year. I very much admire the free university life.\nTell me now, at Oxford you still have the Protestant religion?\"\n\nLothair ventured to bow assent.\n\n\"Ah! that is well,\" continued the princess. \"I advise you to keep it. If\nwe had only had the Protestant religion in Italy, things would have\nbeen very different. You are fortunate in this country in having\nthe Protestant religion and a real nobility. Tell me now, in your\nconstitution, if the father sits in the Upper Chamber, the son sits in\nthe Lower House--that I know; but is there any majorat at attached to\nhis seat?\"\n\n\"Not at present.\"\n\n\"You sit in the Lower House, of course?\"\n\n\"I am not old enough to sit in either House,\" said Lothair, \"but when I\nam of age, which I shall be when I have the honor of showing Oxford\nto your highness, I must sit in the Upper House, for I have not the\nblessing of a living father.\"\n\n\"Ah! that is a great thing in your country,\" exclaimed the princess, \"a\nman being his own master at so early an age.\"\n\n\"I thought it was a 'heritage of woe,'\" said Lothair.\n\n\"No, no,\" said the princess; \"the only tolerable thing in life is\naction, and action is feeble without youth. What if you do not obtain\nyour immediate object?--you always think you will, and the detail of the\nadventure is full of rapture. And thus it is the blunders of youth are\npreferable to the triumphs of manhood, or the successes of old age.\"\n\n\"Well, it will be a consolation for me to remember this when I am in a\nscrape,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"Oh! you have many, many scrapes awaiting you,\" said the princess.\n\"You may look forward to at least ten years of blunders--that is,\nillusions--that is, happiness. Fortunate young man!\"\n\nTheodora had, without appearing to intend it, relinquished her seat\nto Lothair, who continued his conversation with the princess, whom he\nliked, but who, he was sorry to hear, was about to leave England, and\nimmediately--that very night. \"Yes,\" she said, \"it is my last act\nof devotion. You know, in my country we have saints and shrines. All\nItalians, they say, are fond, are superstitious; my pilgrimage is to\nTheodora. I must come and worship her once a year.\"\n\nA gentleman bowed lowly to the princess, who returned his salute with\npleased alacrity. \"Do you know who that is?\" said the princess to\nLothair. \"That is Baron Gozelius, one of our great reputations. He must\nhave just arrived. II will present you to him; it is always agreeable to\nknow a great man,\" she added--\"at least Goethe says so!\"\n\nThe philosopher, at her invitation, took a chair opposite the sofa.\nThough a profound man, he had all the vivacity and passion which are\ngenerally supposed to be peculiar to the superficial. He had remarkable\nconversational power, which he never spared. Lothair was captivated by\nhis eloquence, his striking observations, his warmth, and the flashing\nof his southern eye.\n\n\"Baron Gozelius agrees with your celebrated pastor, Dr. Cumming,\" said\nTheodora, with a tinge of demure sarcasm, \"and believes that the end of\nthe world is at hand.\"\n\n\"And for the same reasons?\" inquired Lothair.\n\n\"Not exactly,\" said Theodora, \"but in this instance science and\nrevelation have arrived at the same result, and that is what all\ndesire.\"\n\n\"All that I said was,\" said Gozelius, \"that the action of the sun had\nbecome so irregular that I thought the chances were in favor of the\ndestruction of our planet. At least, if I were a public office, I would\nnot insure it.\"\n\n\"Yet the risk would not be very great under those circumstances,\" said\nTheodora.\n\n\"The destruction of this worlds foretold,\" said Lothair; \"the stars\nare to fall from the sky; but while I credit, I cannot bring my mind to\ncomprehend, such a catastrophe.\"\n\n\"I have seen a world created and a world destroyed,\" said Gozelius. \"The\nlast was flickering ten years, and it went out as I was watching it.\"\n\n\"And the first?\" inquired Lothair, anxiously.\n\n\"Disturbed space for half a century--a great pregnancy. William Herschel\ntold me it would come when I was a boy, and I cruised for it through\ntwo-thirds of my life. It came at last, and it repaid me.\"\n\nThere was a stir. Euphrosyne was going to sing with her sister. They\nswept by Lothair in their progress to the instrument, like the passage\nof sultanas to some kiosk on the Bosporus. It seemed to him that he had\nnever beheld any thing so resplendent. The air was perfumed by their\nmovement and the rustling of their wondrous robes. \"They must be of the\nAryan race,\" thought Lothair, \"though not of the Phidian type.\" They\nsang a Greek air, and their sweet and touching voices blended with\nexquisite harmony. Every one was silent in the room, because every one\nwas entranced. Then they gave their friends some patriotic lay which\nrequired chorus, the sisters, in turn, singing a stanza. Mr. Phoebus\narranged the chorus in a moment, and there clustered round the piano\nal number of gentlemen almost as good-looking and as picturesque as\nhimself. Then, while Madame Phoebus was singing, Euphrosyne suddenly,\nand with quickness, moved away and approached Theodora, and whispered\nsomething to her, but Theodora slightly shook her head, and seemed to\ndecline.\n\nEuphrosyne regained the piano, whispered something to Colonel Campian,\nwho was one of the chorus, and then commenced her own part. Colonel\nCampian crossed the room and spoke to Theodora, who instantly, without\nthe slightest demur, joined her friends. Lothair felt agitated, as\nhe could not doubt Theodora was going to sing. And so it was; when\nEuphrosyne had finished, and the chorus she had inspired had died away,\nthere rose a deep contralto sound, which, though without effort, seemed\nto Lothair the most thrilling tone he had ever listened to. Deeper and\nricher, and richer and deeper, it seemed to become, as it wound with\nexquisite facility through a symphony of delicious sound, until it ended\nin a passionate burst, which made Lothair's heart beat so tumultuously\nthat for a moment he thought he should be overpowered.\n\n\"I never heard any thing so fine in my life,\" said Lothair to the French\nphilosopher.\n\n\"Ah! if you had heard that woman sing the Marseillaise, as I did once,\nto three thousand people, then you would know what was fine. Not one of\nus who would not have died on the spot for her!\"\n\nThe concert was over. The Princess of Tivoli had risen to say farewell.\nShe stood apart with Theodora, holding both her hands, and speaking with\nearnestness. Then she pressed her lips to Theodora's forehead, and said,\n\"Adieu, my best beloved; the spring will return.\"\n\nThe princess had disappeared, and Madame Phoebus came up to say\ngood-night to her hostess.\n\n\"It is such a delicious night,\" said Theodora, \"that I have ordered our\nstrawberries-and-cream on the terrace. You must not go.\"\n\nAnd so she invited them all to the terrace. There was not a breath\nof air, the garden was flooded with moonlight, in which the fountain\nglittered, and the atmosphere was as sweet as it was warm.\n\n\"I think the moon will melt the ice to-night,\" said Theodora, as she led\nMadame Phoebus to a table covered with that innocent refreshment in many\nforms, and pyramids of strawberries, and gentle drinks which the fancy\nof America could alone devise.\n\n\"I wonder we did not pass the whole evening on the terrace,\" said\nLothair.\n\n\"One must sing in a room,\" said Euphrosyne, \"or the nightingales would\neclipse us.\"\n\nLothair looked quickly at the speaker, and caught the glance of a\npeculiar countenance--mockery blended with Ionian splendor.\n\n\"I think strawberries-and-cream the most popular of all food,\" said\nMadame Phoebus, as some touched her beautiful lips.\n\n\"Yes; and one is not ashamed of eating it,\" said Theodora.\n\nSoon there was that stir which precedes the breaking up of an assembly.\nMrs. Giles and some others had to return to town. Madame Phoebus and\nEuphrosyne were near neighbors at Roehampton, but their carriage had\nbeen for some time waiting. Mr. Phoebus did not accompany them. He chose\nto walk home on such a night, and descended into the garden with his\nremaining friends.\n\n\"They are going to smoke,\" said Theodora. \"Is it your habit?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\n\"I do not dislike it in the air and at a distance; but I banish them the\nterrace. I think smoking must be a great consolation to a soldier;\" and,\nas she spoke, she moved, and, without formally inviting him, he found\nhimself walking by her side.\n\nRather abruptly he said, \"You wore last night at the opera the same\nornament as on the first time I had the pleasure meeting you.\"\n\nShe looked at him with a smile, and a little surprised. \"My solitary\ntrinket; I fear you will never see any other.\"\n\n\"But you do not despise trinkets?\" said Lothair.\n\n\"Oh no; they are very well. Once I was decked with jewels and ropes of\npearls, like Titian's Queen of Cyprus. I sometimes regret my pearls.\nThere is a reserve about pearls which I like--something soft and dim.\nBut they are all gone, and I ought not to regret them, for they went in\na good cause. I kept the star, because it was given to me by a hero; and\nonce we flattered ourselves it was a symbol.\"\n\n\"I wish I were a hero!\" said Lothair.\n\n\"You may yet prove one.\"\n\n\"And if I do, may I give you a star?\"\n\n\"If it be symbolical.\"\n\n\"But of what?\"\n\n\"Of an heroic purpose.\"\n\n\"But what is an heroic purpose?\" exclaimed Lothair. \"Instead of being\nhere to-night, I ought, perhaps, to have been present at a religious\nfunction of the highest and deepest import, which might have influenced\nmy destiny, and led to something heroic. But my mind is uncertain and\nunsettled. I speak to you without reserve, for my heart always entirely\nopens to you, and I have a sort of unlimited confidence in your\njudgment. Besides, I have never forgotten what you said at Oxford about\nreligion--that you could not conceive society without religion. It is\nwhat I feel myself, and most strongly; and yet there never was a period\nwhen religion was so assailed. There is no doubt the atheists are\nbolder, are more completely organized, both as to intellectual and even\nphysical force, than ever was known. I have heard that from the highest\nauthority. For my own part, I think I am prepared to die for Divine\ntruth. I have examined myself severely, but I do not think I should\nfalter. Indeed, can there be for man a nobler duty than to be the\nchampion of God? But then the question of the churches interferes. If\nthere were only one church, I could see my way. Without a church, there\ncan be no true religion, because otherwise you have no security for the\ntruth. I am a member of the Church of England, and when I was at Oxford\nI thought the Anglican view might be sustained. But, of late, I have\ngiven ray mind deeply to these matters, for, after all, they are the\nonly matters a man should think of; and, I confess to you, the claim of\nRome to orthodoxy seems to me irresistible.\"\n\n\"You make no distinction, then, between religion and orthodoxy?\" said\nTheodora.\n\n\"Certainly I make no difference.\"\n\n\"And yet, what is orthodox at Dover is not orthodox at Calais or Ostend.\nI should be sorry to think that, because there was no orthodoxy in\nBelgium or France, there was no religion.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Lothair, \"I think I see what you mean.\"\n\n\"Then again, if we go further,\" continued Theodora, \"there is the whole\nof the East; that certainly is not orthodox, according to your views.\nYou may not agree with all or any of their opinions, but you could\nscarcely maintain that, as communities, they are irreligious.\"\n\n\"Well, you could not, certainly,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"So you see,\" said Theodora, \"what is called orthodoxy has very little\nto do with religion; and a person may be very religious without holding\nthe same dogmas as yourself, or, as some think, without holding any.\"\n\n\"According to you, then,\" said Lothair, \"the Anglican view might be\nmaintained.\"\n\n\"I do not know what the Anglican view is,\" said Theodora. \"I do not\nbelong to the Roman or to the Anglican Church.\"\n\n\"And yet, you are very religious,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"I hope so; I try to be so; and, when I fail in any duty, it is not the\nfault of my religion. I never deceive myself into that; I know it is my\nown fault.\"\n\nThere was a pause; but they walked on. The soft splendor of the scene\nand all its accessories, the moonlight, and the fragrance, and the\nfalling waters, wonderfully bewitched the spirit of the young Lothair.\n\n\"There is nothing I would not tell you,\" he suddenly exclaimed, turning\nto Theodora, \"and sometimes I think there is nothing you would not tell\nme. Tell me, then, I entreat you, what is your religion?\"\n\n\"The true religion, I think,\" said Theodora. \"I worship in a church\nwhere I believe God dwells, and dwells for my guidance and my good--my\nconscience.\"\n\n\"Your conscience may be divine,\" said Lothair, \"and I believe it is; but\nthe consciences of other persons are not divine, and what is to\nguide them, and what is to prevent or to mitigate the evil they would\nperpetrate?\"\n\n\"I have never heard from priests,\" said Theodora, \"any truth which my\nconscience had not revealed to me. They use different language from what\nI use, but I find, after a time, that we mean the thing. What I call\ntime they call eternity; when they describe heaven, they give a picture\nof earth; and beings whom they style divine, they invest with all the\nattributes of humanity.\"\n\n\"And yet is it not true,\" said Lothair, \"that--\"\n\nBut, at this moment, there were the sounds of merriment and of\napproaching footsteps; the form of Mr. Phoebus appeared ascending the\nsteps of the terrace, followed by others. The smokers had fulfilled\ntheir task. There were farewells, and bows, and good-nights. Lothair had\nto retire with the others, and, as he threw himself into his brougham,\nhe exclaimed: \"I perceive that life is not so simple an affair as I once\nsupposed.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 32\n\n\nWhen the stranger, who had proved so opportune an ally to Lothair at\nthe Fenian meeting, separated from his companion, he proceeded in the\ndirection of Pentonville, and, after pursuing his way through a number\nof obscure streets, but quiet, decent, and monotonous, he stopped at\na small house in a row of many residences, yet all of them, in, form,\nsize, color, and general character, so identical, that the number on\nthe door could alone assure the visitor that he was not in error when he\nsounded the knocker.\n\n\"Ah! is it you, Captain Bruges?\" said the smiling and blushing maiden\nwho answered to his summons. \"We have not seen you for a long time.\"\n\n\"Well, you look as kind and as pretty as ever, Jenny,\" said the captain,\n\"and how is my friend?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the damsel, and she shrugged her shoulders, \"he mopes. I'm\nvery glad you have come back, captain, for he sees very few now, and is\nalways writing. I cannot bear that writing; if he would only go and take\na good walk, I am sure he would be better.\"\n\n\"There is something in that,\" said Captain Bruges. \"And is he at home,\nand will he see me?\"\n\n\"Oh! he is always at home to you, captain; but I will just run up and\ntell him you are here. You know it is long since we have seen you,\ncaptain--coming on half a year, I think.\"\n\n\"Time flies, Jenny. Go, my good girl, and I will wait below.\"\n\n\"In the parlor, if you please, Captain Bruges. It is to let now. It is\nmore than a mouth since the doctor left us. That was a loss, for, as\nlong as the doctor was here, he always had some one to speak with.\"\n\nSo Captain Bruges entered the little dining-room with its mahogany\ntable, and half a dozen chairs, and cellaret, and over the fireplace a\nportrait of Garibaldi, which had been left as a legacy to the landlady\nby her late lodger, Dr. Tresorio.\n\nThe captain threw a quick glance at the print, and then, falling into\nreverie, with his hands crossed behind him, paced the little chamber,\nand was soon lost in thoughts which made him unconscious how long had\nelapsed when the maiden summoned him.\n\nFollowing her, and ascending the stair-case, he was ushered into the\nfront room of the first floor, and there came forward to meet him a man\nrather below the middle height, but of a symmetrical and imposing mien.\nHis face was grave, not to say sad; thought, not time, had partially\nsilvered the clustering of his raven hair; but intellectual power\nreigned in his wide brow, while determination was the character of the\nrest of his countenance, under great control, yet apparently, from the\ndark flashing of his eye, not incompatible with fanaticism.\n\n\"General,\" he exclaimed, \"your presence always reanimates me. I shall\nat least have some news on which I rely. Your visit is sudden--sudden\nthings are often happy ones. Is there any thing stirring in the promised\nland? Speak, speak! You have a thousand things to say, and I have a\nthousand ears.\"\n\n\"My dear Mirandola,\" replied the visitor, \"I will take leave to call\ninto council a friend whose presence is always profitable.\"\n\nSo saying, he took out a cigar-case, and offered it to his companion.\n\n\"We have smoked together in palaces,\" said Mirandola, accepting the\nproffer with a delicate white hand.\n\n\"But not these cigars,\" replied the general. \"They are superb, my only\nreward for all my transatlantic work, and sometimes I think a sufficient\none.\"\n\n\"And Jenny shall give us a capital cup of coffee,\" said Mirandola; \"it\nis the only hospitality that I can offer my friends. Give me a light, my\ngeneral; and now, how are things?\"\n\n\"Well, at the first glance, very bad; the French have left Rome, and we\nare not in it.\"\n\n\"Well, that is an infamy not of today or yesterday,\" replied Mirandola,\n\"though not less an infamy. We talked over this six months ago, when\nyou were over here about something else, and from that moment unto the\npresent I have with unceasing effort labored to erase this stigma from\nthe human consciousness, but with no success. Men are changed; public\nspirit is extinct; the deeds of '48 are to the present generations as\nincomprehensible as the Punic wars, or the feats of Marius against the\nCimbri. What we want are the most natural things in the world, and easy\nof attainment because they are natural. We want our metropolis,\nour native frontiers, and true liberty. Instead of these, we have\ncompromises, conventions, provincial jealousies, and French prefects.\nIt is disgusting, heart-rending; sometimes I fear my own energies are\nwaning. My health is wretched; writing and speaking are decidedly bad\nfor me, and I pass my life in writing and speaking. Toward evening I\nfeel utterly exhausted, and am sometimes, which I thought I never could\nbe, the victim of despondency. The loss of the doctor was a severe blow,\nbut they hurried him out of the place. The man of Paris would never rest\ntill he was gone. I was myself thinking of once more trying Switzerland,\nbut the obstacles are great; and, in truth, I was at the darkest moment\nwhen Jenny brought me the light of your name.\"\n\nThe general, who had bivouacked on a group of small chairs, his leg on\none, his elbow on another, took his cigar from his mouth and delivered\nhimself of a volume of smoke, and then said dryly: \"Things may not be so\nbad as they seem, comrade. Your efforts have not been without fruit.\nI have traced them in many quarters, and, indeed, it is about their\npossible consequences that I have come over to consult with you.\"\n\n\"Idle words, I know, never escape those lips,\" said Mirandola; \"speak\non.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the general, \"you see that people are a little exhausted\nby the efforts of last year; and it must be confessed that no slight\nresults were accomplished. The freedom of Venice--\"\n\n\"A French intrigue,\" exclaimed Mirandola. \"The freedom of Venice is the\nprice of the slavery of Rome. I heard of it with disgust.\"\n\n\"Well, we do not differ much on that head,\" said the general. \"I am not\na Roman as you are, but I view Rome, with reference to the object of\nmy life, with feelings not less ardent and absorbing than yourself, who\nwould wish to see it again the empress of the world. I am a soldier, and\nlove war, and, left to myself, would care little perhaps for what form\nof government I combated, provided the army was constituted on the\nprinciples of fraternity and equality; but the passion of my life, to\nwhich I have sacrificed military position, and perhaps,\" he added in\na lower tone, \"perhaps even military fame, has been to destroy\npriestcraft, and, so long as the pope rules in Rome, it will be\nsupreme.\"\n\n\"We have struck him down once,\" said Mirandola.\n\n\"And I hope we shall again, and forever,\" said the general, \"and it\nis about that I would speak. You are in error in supposing that your\nfriends do not sympathize with you, or that their answers are dilatory\nor evasive. There is much astir; the old spirit is not extinct, but\nthe difficulties are greater than in former days when we had only the\nAustrians to encounter, and we cannot afford to make another failure.\"\n\n\"There could be no failure if we were clear and determined. There must\nbe a hundred thousand men who would die for our metropolis, our natural\nfrontiers, and true liberty. The mass of the pseudo-Italian army must\nbe with us. As for foreign interference, its repetition seems to me\nimpossible. The brotherhood in the different countries, if well guided,\ncould alone prevent it. There should be at once a manifesto addressed to\nthe peoples. They have become absorbed in money-grubbing and what they\ncall industry. The external life of a nation is its most important one.\nA nation, as an individual, has duties to fulfil appointed by God and\nHis moral law; the individual toward his family, his town, his country;\nthe nation toward the country of countries, humanity--the outward world.\nI firmly believe that we fail and renounce the religious and divine\nelement of our life whenever we betray or neglect those duties. The\ninternal activity of a nation is important and sacred because it\nprepares the instrument for its appointed task. It is mere egotism if it\nconverges toward itself, degrading and doomed to expiation--as will be\nthe fate of this country in which we now dwell,\" added Mirandola in a\nhushed voice. \"England had a mission; it had belief, and it had power.\nIt announced itself the representative of religious, commercial, and\npolitical freedom, and yet, when it came to action, it allowed Denmark\nto be crushed by Austria and Prussia, and, in the most nefarious\ntransaction of modern times, uttered the approving shriek of 'Perish\nSavoy!'\"\n\n\"My dear Mirandola,\" said the general, trimming his cigar, \"there is no\nliving man who appreciates your genius and your worth more than\nmyself; perhaps I might say there is no living man who has had equal\nopportunities of estimating them. You formed the mind of our country;\nyou kindled and kept alive the sacred flame when all was gloom, and\nall were without heart. Such prodigious devotion, so much resource\nand pertinacity and patience, such unbroken spirit, were never before\nexhibited by man; and, whatever may be said by your enemies, I know that\nin the greatest hour of action you proved equal to it; and yet at this\nmoment, when your friends are again stirring, and there is a hope of\nspring, I am bound to tell you that there are only two persons in the\nworld who can effect the revolution, and you are not one of them.\"\n\n\"I am ardent, my general, perhaps too sanguine, but I have no self-love,\nat least none when the interests of the great cause are at stake. Tell\nme, then, their names, and count, if required, on my cooperation.\"\n\n\"Garibaldi and Mary-Anne.\"\n\n\"A Polchinello and a Bayadere!\" exclaimed Mirandola, and, springing from\nhis seat, he impatiently paced the room.\n\n\"And yet,\" continued the general calmly, \"there is no manner of doubt\nthat Garibaldi is the only name that could collect ten thousand men\nat any given point in Italy; while in France, though her influence\nis mythical, the name of Mary-Anne is a name of magic. Though never\nmentioned, it is never forgotten. And the slightest allusion to it among\nthe initiated will open every heart. There are more secret societies\nin France at this moment than at any period since '85, though you hear\nnothing of them; and they believe in Mary-Anne, and in nothing else.\"\n\n\"You have been at Caprera?\" said Mirandola.\n\n\"I have been at Caprera.\"\n\n\"And what did he say?\"\n\n\"He will do nothing without the sanction of the Savoyard.\"\n\n\"He wants to get wounded in his other foot,\" said Mirandola, with savage\nsarcasm. \"Will he never weary of being betrayed?\"\n\n\"I found him calm and sanguine,\" said the general.\n\n\"What of the woman?\"\n\n\"Garibaldi will not move without the Savoyard, and Mary-Anne will not\nmove without Garibaldi; that is the situation.\"\n\n\"Have you seen her?\"\n\n\"Not yet; I have been to Caprera, and I have come over to see her and\nyou. Italy is ready for the move, and is only waiting for the great man.\nHe will not act without the Savoyard; he believes in him. I will not be\nskeptical. There are difficulties enough without imagining any. We have\nno money, and all our sources of supply are drained; but we have the\ninspiration of a sacred cause, we have you--we may gain others--and, at\nany rate, the French are no longer at Rome.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 33\n\n\n\"The Goodwood Cup, my lord--the Doncaster. This pair of flagons for his\nhighness the Khedive--something quite new--yes, parcel-gilt, the only\nstyle now--it gives relief to design--yes, by Monti, a great man, hardly\ninferior to Flaxman, if at all. Flaxman worked for. Rundell and Bridge\nin the old days--one of the principal causes of their success. Your\nlordship's gold service was supplied by Rundell and Bridge. Very fine\nservice indeed, much by Flaxman--nothing of that kind seen now.\"\n\n\"I never did see it,\" said Lothair. He was replying to Mr. Ruby, a\ncelebrated jeweller and goldsmith, in a celebrated street, who had\nsaluted him when he had entered the shop, and called the attention of\nLothair to a group of treasures of art.\n\n\"Strange,\" said Mr. Ruby smiling. \"It is in the next room, if your\nlordship would like to see it. I think your lordship should see your\ngold service. Mr. Putney Giles ordered it here to be examined and put in\norder.\"\n\n\"I should like to see it very much,\" said Lothair, \"though I came to\nspeak to you about something else.\"\n\nAnd so Lothair, following Mr. Ruby into an inner apartment, had the\ngratification, for the first time, of seeing his own service of gold\nplate laid out in completeness, and which had been for some time\nexhibited to the daily admiration of that favored portion of the English\npeople who frequent the brilliant and glowing counters of Mr. Ruby.\n\nNot that Lothair was embarrassed by their presence at this moment. The\nhour of their arrival had not yet come. Business had not long commenced\nwhen Lothair entered the shop, somewhat to the surprise of its master.\nThose who know Bond Street only in the blaze of fashionable hours can\nform but an imperfect conception of its matutinal charm when it is\nstill shady and fresh--when there are no carriages, rarely a cart,\nand passers-by gliding about on real business. One feels as in some\nContinental city. Then there are time and opportunity to look at the\nshops; and there is no street in the world that can furnish such a\ncollection, filled with so many objects of beauty, curiosity, and\ninterest. The jewellers and goldsmiths and dealers in rare furniture,\nporcelain, and cabinets, and French pictures, have long fixed upon Bond\nStreet as their favorite quarter, and are not chary of displaying their\ntreasures; though it may be a question whether some of the magazines\nof fancy food--delicacies culled from all the climes and regions of the\nglobe--particularly at the matin hour, may not, in their picturesque\nvariety, be the most attractive. The palm, perhaps, would be given to\nthe fish-mongers, with their exuberant exhibitions, grouped with skill,\nstartling often with strange forms, dazzling with prismatic tints, and\nbreathing the invigorating redolence of the sea.\n\n\"Well, I like the service,\" said Lothair, \"and am glad, as you tell\nme, that its fashion has come round again, because there will now be no\nnecessity for ordering a new one. I do not myself much care for plate.\nI like flowers and porcelain on a table, and I like to see the guests.\nHowever, I suppose it is all right, and I must use it. It was not about\nplate that I called; I wanted to speak to you about pearls.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Ruby, and his face brightened; and, ushering Lothair to\nsome glass cases, he at the same time provided his customer with a seat.\n\n\"Something like that?\" said Mr. Ruby, who by this time had slid into\nhis proper side of the counter, and was unlocking the glass cases;\n\"something like that?\" and he placed before Lothair a string of pretty\npearls with a diamond clasp. \"With the earrings, twenty-five hundred,\"\nhe added; and then, observing that Lothair did not seem enchanted, he\nsaid, \"This is something quite new,\" and he carelessly pushed toward\nLothair a magnificent necklace of turquoises and brilliants.\n\nIt was impossible not to admire it--the arrangement was so novel and yet\nof such good taste; but, though its price was double that of the pearl\nnecklace, Mr. Ruby did not seem to wish to force attention to it, for he\nput in Lothair's hands almost immediately the finest emerald necklace in\nthe world, and set in a style that was perfectly ravishing.\n\n\"The setting is from the Campana collection,\" said Mr. Ruby. \"They\ncertainly understood things in those days, but I can say that, so far as\nmere workmanship is concerned, this quite equals them. I have made one\nfor the empress. Here is a black pearl, very rare, pear-shape, and set\nin Golconda diamonds--two thousand guineas--it might be suspended to\na necklace, or worn as a locket. This is pretty,\" and he offered to\nLothair a gigantic sapphire in brilliants and in the form of a bracelet.\n\n\"The finest sapphire I know is in this ring,\" added Mr. Ruby, and he\nintroduced his visitor to a tray of precious rings. \"I have a pearl\nbracelet here that your lordship might like to see,\" and he placed\nbefore Lothair a case of fifty bracelets, vying with each other in\nsplendor.\n\n\"But what I want,\" said Lothair, \"are pearls.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said Mr. Ruby. \"This is a curious thing,\" and he took\nout a paper packet. \"There!\" he said, opening it and throwing it\nbefore Lothair so carelessly that some of the stones ran over the glass\ncovering of the counter. \"There, that is a thing, not to be seen every\nday--packet of diamonds, bought of an Indian prince, and sent by us to\nbe cut and polished at Amsterdam--nothing can be done in that way except\nthere--and just returned--nothing very remarkable as to size, but all\nof high quality--some fine stones--that for example,\" and he touched one\nwith the long nail of his little finger; \"that is worth seven hundred\nguineas, the whole packet worth perhaps ten thousand pounds.\"\n\n\"Very interesting,\" said Lothair, \"but what I want are pearls. That\nnecklace which you have shown me is like the necklace of a doll. I\nwant pearls, such as you see them in Italian pictures--Titians and\nGiorgiones--such as a Queen of Cyprus would wear. I want ropes of\npearls.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Ruby, \"I know what your lordship means. Lady Bideford had\nsomething of that kind. She very much deceived us--always told us her\nnecklace must be sold at her death, and she had very bad health. We\nwaited, but when she went, poor lady, it was claimed by the heir, and\nis in chancery at this very moment. The Justinianis have ropes of\npearls--Madame Justiniani of Paris, I have been told, gives a rope to\nevery one of her children when they marry--but there is no expectation\nof a Justiniani parting with any thing. Pearls are troublesome property,\nmy lord. They require great care; they want both air and exercise; they\nmust be worn frequently; you cannot lock them up. The Duchess of Havant\nhas the finest pearls in this country, and I told her grace, 'Wear them\nwhenever you can; wear them at breakfast,' and her grace follows my\nadvice--she does wear them at breakfast. I go down to Havant Castle\nevery year to see her grace's pearls, and I wipe every one of them\nmyself, and let them lie on a sunny bank in the garden, in a westerly\nwind, for hours and days together. Their complexion would have been\nruined had it not been for this treatment. Pearls are like girls, my\nlord--they require quite as much attention.\"\n\n\"Then you cannot give me what I want?\" said Lothair.\n\n\"Well, I can, and I cannot,\" said Mr. Ruby. \"I am in a difficulty.\nI have in this house exactly what your lordship requires, but I have\noffered them to Lord Topaz, and I have not received his answer. We have\ninstructions to inform his lordship of every very precious jewel that we\nobtain, and give him the preference as a purchaser. Nevertheless,\nthere is no one I could more desire to oblige than your lordship--your\nlordship has every claim upon us, and I should be truly glad to find\nthese pearls in your lordship's possession if I could only see my way.\nPerhaps your lordship would like to look at them?\"\n\n\"Certainly, but pray do not leave me here alone with all these\ntreasures,\" said Lothair, as Mr. Ruby was quitting the apartment.\n\n\"Oh! my lord, with you!\"\n\n\"Yes, that is all very well; but, if any thing is missed hereafter, it\nwill always be remembered that these jewels were in my possession, and\nI was alone. I highly object to it.\" But Mr. Ruby had vanished, and did\nnot immediately reappear. In the mean time it was impossible for Lothair\nto move: he was alone, and surrounded with precious necklaces, and\nglittering rings, and gorgeous bracelets, with loose diamonds running\nover the counter. It was not a kind or an amount of property that\nLothair, relinquishing the trust, could satisfactorily deliver to a\nshopman. The shopman, however honest, might be suddenly tempted by\nSatan, and take the next train to Liverpool. He felt therefore relieved\nwhen Mr. Ruby reentered the room, breathless, with a velvet casket. \"I\nbeg pardon, my lord, a thousand pardons, but I thought I would just\nrun over to Lord Topaz, only in the square close by. His lordship is\nat Madrid, the only city one cannot depend on communications with by\ntelegraph. Spaniards strange people, very prejudiced, take all sorts of\nfancies in their head. Besides, Lord Topaz has more pearls than he can\nknow what to do with, and I should like your lordship to see these,\" and\nhe opened the casket.\n\n\"Exactly what I want,\" exclaimed Lothair; \"these must be the very pearls\nthe Queen of Cyprus wore. What is their price?\"\n\n\"They are from Genoa, and belonged to a doge,\" said Mr. Ruby; \"your\nlordship shall have them for the sum we gave for them. There shall be no\nprofit on the transaction, and we shall be proud of it. We gave for them\nfour thousand guineas.\"\n\n\"I will take them with me,\" said Lothair, who was afraid, if lie left\nthem behind, Lord Topaz might arrive in the interval.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 34\n\n\nLothair had returned home from his last visit to Belmont agitated by\nmany thoughts, but, generally speaking, deeply musing over its mistress.\nConsiderable speculation on religion, the churches, the solar system,\nthe cosmical order, the purpose of creation, and the destiny of man, was\nmaintained in his too rapid progress from Roehampton to his Belgravian\nhotel; but the association of ideas always terminated the consideration\nof every topic by a wondering and deeply interesting inquiry when he\nshould see her again. And here, in order to simplify this narrative,\nwe will at once chronicle the solution of this grave question. On the\nafternoon of the next day, Lothair mounted his horse with the intention\nof calling on Lady St. Jerome, and perhaps some other persons, but it is\ncurious to observe that he soon found himself on the road to Roehampton,\nwhere he was in due time paying a visit to Theodora. But what is\nmore remarkable is that the same result occurred every day afterward.\nRegularly every day he paid a visit to Belmont. Nor was this all; very\noften he paid two visits, for he remembered that in the evening Theodora\nwas always at home. Lothair used to hurry to town from his morning\nvisit, dine at some great house, which satisfied the demands of society,\nand then drive down to Roehampton. The guests of the evening saloon,\nwhen they witnessed the high ceremony of Lothair's manner, which was\nnatural to him, when he entered, and the welcome of Theodora, could\nhardly believe that a few hours only had elapsed since their separation.\n\nAnd what was the manner of Theodora to him when they were alone?\nPrecisely as before. She never seemed in the least surprised that he\ncalled on her every day, or even twice a day. Sometimes she was alone,\nfrequently she had companions, but she was always the same, always\nappeared gratified at his arrival, and always extended to him the same\nwelcome, graceful and genial, but without a spark of coquetry. Yet\nshe did not affect to conceal that she took a certain interest in him,\nbecause she was careful to introduce him to distinguished men, and would\nsay, \"You should know him, he is master of such a subject. You will\nhear things that you ought to know.\" But all this in a sincere and\nstraightforward manner. Theodora had not the slightest affectation; she\nwas always natural, though a little reserved. But this reserve appeared\nto be the result of modesty, rather than of any desire of concealment.\nWhen they were alone, though always calm, she would talk with freedom\nand vivacity; but in the presence of others she rather led to their\ndisplay, and encouraged them, often with a certain degree of adroit\nsimplicity, to descant on topics which interested theme or of which they\nwere competent to treat. Alone with Lothair, and they were often alone,\nthough she herself never obtruded the serious subjects round which he\nwas always fluttering, she never avoided them, and without involving\nherself in elaborate arguments, or degenerating into conversational\ncontroversy, she had a habit of asking a question, or expressing\na sentiment, which greatly affected his feelings or perplexed his\nopinions.\n\nHad not the season been long waning, this change in the life of Lothair\nmust have been noticed, and its cause ultimately discovered. But the\nsocial critics cease to be observant toward the end of July. All the\nworld then are thinking of themselves, and have no time to speculate on\nthe fate and fortunes of their neighbors. The campaign is too near its.\nclose; the balance of the season must soon be struck, the great book of\nsociety made. In a few weeks, even in a few days, what long and subtle\nplans shattered or triumphant!--what prizes gained or missed!--what\nbaffled hopes, and what broken hearts! The baffled hopes must go to\nCowes, and the broken hearts to Baden. There were some great ladies who\ndid remark that Lothair was seldom seen at balls; and Hugo Bohun, who\nhad been staying at his aunt Lady Gertrude's villa for change of air,\ndid say to Bertram that he had met Lothair twice on Barnes Common, and\nasked Bertram if he knew the reason why. But the fact that Lothair was\ncruising in waters which their craft never entered combined with the\nlateness of the season to baffle all the ingenuity of Hugo Bohun, though\nhe generally found out every thing.\n\nThe great difficulty which Lothair had to apprehend was with his Roman\nCatholic friends. The system of the monsignori was never to let him be\nout of sight, and his absence from the critical function had not only\ndisappointed but alarmed them. But the Jesuits are wise men; they never\nlose their temper. They know when to avoid scenes as well as when to\nmake them. Monsignore Catesby called on Lothair as frequently as before,\nand never made the slightest allusion to the miscarriage of their\nexpectations. Strange to say, the innocent Lothair, naturally so\nstraightforward and so honorable, found himself instinctively, almost it\nmight be said unconsciously, defending himself against his invaders with\nsome of their own weapons. He still talked about building his cathedral,\nof which, not contented with more plans, he even gave orders that a\nmodel should be made, and he still received statements on points of\nfaith from Father Coleman, on which he made marginal notes and queries.\nMonsignore Catesby was not altogether satisfied. He was suspicious\nof some disturbing cause, but at present it baffled him. Their hopes,\nhowever, were high; and they had cause to be sanguine. In a month's time\nor so, Lothair would be in the country to celebrate his majority; his\nguardian the cardinal was to be his guest; the St. Jeromes were invited,\nMonsignore Catesby himself. Here would be opportunity and actors to\navail themselves of it.\n\nIt was a very few days after the first evening visit of Lothair to\nBelmont that he found himself one morning alone with Theodora. She was\nin her bowery boudoir, copying some music for Madame Phoebus, at\nleast in the intervals of conversation. That had not been of a grave\ncharacter, but the contrary when Lothair rather abruptly said, \"Do you\nagree, Mrs. Campian, with what Mr. Phoebus said the other night, that\nthe greatest pain must be the sense of death?\"\n\n\"Then mankind is generally spared the greatest pain,\" she replied, \"for\nI apprehend few people are sensible of death--unless indeed,\" she\nadded, \"it be on the field of battle; and there, I am sure, it cannot be\npainful.\"\n\n\"Not on the field of battle?\" asked Lothair, inducing her to proceed.\n\n\"Well, I should think for all, on the field of battle, there must be a\ndegree of excitement, and of sympathetic excitement, scarcely compatible\nwith overwhelming suffering; but, if death were encountered there for a\ngreat cause, I should rather associate it with rapture than pain.\"\n\n\"But still a good number of persons must die in their beds and be\nconscious,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"It may be, though I should doubt it. The witnesses of such a demise are\nnever impartial. All I have loved and lost have died upon the field of\nbattle; and those who have suffered pain have been those whom they have\nleft behind; and that pain,\" she added with some emotion, \"may perhaps\ndeserve the description of Mr. Phoebus.\"\n\nLothair would not pursue the subject, and there was rather an awkward\npause. Theodora herself broke it, and in a lighter vein, though\nrecurring to the same theme, she said with a slight smile: \"I am\nscarcely a competent person to consult upon this subject, for, to be\ncandid with you, I do not myself believe in death. There is a change,\nand doubtless a great one, painful it may be, certainly very perplexing,\nbut I have a profound conviction of my immortality, and I do not\nbelieve that I shall rest in my grave in saecula saeculorum, only to be\nconvinced of it by the last trump.\"\n\n\"I hope you will not leave this world before I do,\" said Lothair, \"but,\nif that sorrow be reserved for me, promise that to me, if only once, you\nwill reappear.\"\n\n\"I doubt whether the departed have that power,\" said Theodora, \"or\nelse I think my heroes would have revisited me. I lost a father more\nmagnificent than Jove, and two brothers brighter than Apollo, and all of\nthem passionately loved me--and yet they have not come; but I shall\nsee them--and perhaps soon. So you see, my dear lord,\" speaking more\nbriskly, and rising rather suddenly from her seat, \"that for my part I\nthink it best to arrange all that concerns one in this world while one\ninhabits it, and this reminds me that I have a little business to fulfil\nin which you can help me,\" and she opened a cabinet and took out a flat\nantique case, and then said, resuming her seat at her table: \"Some one,\nand anonymously, has made me a magnificent present; some strings of\ncostly pearls. I am greatly embarrassed with them, for I never wear\npearls or anything else, and I never wish to accept presents. To return\nthem to an unknown is out of my power, but it is not impossible that I\nmay some day become acquainted with the donor. I wish them to be kept in\nsafety, and therefore not by myself, for my life is subject to too great\nvicissitudes. I have therefore placed them in this case, which I shall\nnow seal and intrust them to your care, as a friend in whom I have\nentire confidence. See,\" she said, lighting a match, and opening the\ncase, \"here are the pearls--are they not superb?--and here is a note\nwhich will tell you what to do with them in case of my absence, when you\nopen the case, which will not be for a year from this day. There, it is\nlocked. I have directed it to you, and I will seal it with my father's\nseal.\"\n\nLothair wag about to speak. \"Do not say a word,\" she said \"this seal is\na religious ceremony with me.\" She was some little time fulfilling\nit, so that the impression might be deep and clear. She looked at it\nearnestly while the wax was cooling, and then she said, \"I deliver\nthe custody of this to a friend whom I entirely trust. Adieu!\" and she\ndisappeared.\n\nThe amazed Lothair glanced at the seal. It was a single word, \"ROMA,\"\nand then, utterly mystified, he returned to town with his own present.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 35\n\n\nMr. Phoebus had just finished a picture which he had painted for the\nEmperor of Russia. It was to depart immediately from England for its\nnorthern home, except that his imperial majesty had consented that it\nshould be exhibited for a brief space to the people of England. This was\na condition which Mr. Phoebus had made in the interests of art, and as a\ndue homage alike to his own patriotism and celebrity.\n\nThere was to be a private inspection of the picture at the studio of the\nartist, and Mr. Phoebus had invited Lothair to attend it. Our friend\nhad accordingly, on the appointed day, driven down to Belmont and then\nwalked to the residence of Mr. Phoebus with Colonel Campian and his\nwife. It was a short and pretty walk, entirely through the royal park,\nwhich the occupiers of Belmont had the traditionary privilege thus to\nuse.\n\nThe residence of Mr. Phoebus was convenient and agreeable, and in\nsituation not unlike that of Belmont, being sylvan and sequestered.\nHe had himself erected a fine studio, and added it to the original\nbuilding. The flower-garden was bright and curious, and on the lawn was\na tent of many colors, designed by himself and which might have suited\nsome splendid field of chivalry. Upon gilt and painted perches, also,\nthere were paroquets and macaws.\n\nLothair on his arrival found many guests assembled, chiefly on the\nlawn. Mr. Phoebus was highly esteemed, and had distinguished and eminent\nfriends, whose constant courtesies the present occasion allowed him\nelegantly to acknowledge. There was a polished and gray-headed noble who\nwas the head of the patrons of art in England, whose nod of approbation\nsometimes made the fortune of a young artist, and whose purchase of\npictures for the nation even the furious cognoscenti of the House of\nCommons dared not question. Some of the finest works of Mr. Phoebus were\nto be found in his gallery; but his lordship admired Madame Phoebus even\nmore than her husband's works, and Euphrosyne as much as her sister.\nIt was sometimes thought, among their friends, that this young lady had\nonly to decide in order to share the widowed coronet; but Euphrosyne\nlaughed at every thing, even her adorers; and, while her witching\nmockery only rendered them more fascinated, it often prevented critical\ndeclarations.\n\nAnd Lady Beatrice was there, herself an artist, and full of aesthetical\nenthusiasm. Her hands were beautiful, and she passed her life in\nmodelling them. And Cecrops was there, a rich old bachelor, with, it was\nsupposed, the finest collection of modern pictures extant. His theory\nwas, that a man could not do a wiser thing than invest the whole of his\nfortune in such securities, and it led him to tell his numerous nephews\nand nieces that he should, in all probability, leave his collection to\nthe nation.\n\nClorinda, whose palace was always open to genius, and who delighted\nin the society of men who had discovered planets, excavated primeval\nmounds, painted pictures on new principles, or composed immortal poems\nwhich no human being could either scan or construe, but which she\ndelighted in as \"subtle\" and full of secret melody, came leaning on the\narms of a celebrated plenipotentiary, and beaming with sympathy on every\nsubject, and with the consciousness of her universal charms.\n\nAnd the accomplished Sir Francis was there, and several R. A. s of\neminence, for Phoebus was a true artist, and loved the brotherhood, and\nalways placed them in the post of honor.\n\nNo language can describe the fascinating costume of Madame Phoebus and\nher glittering sister. \"They are habited as sylvans,\" the great artist\ndeigned to observe, if any of his guests could not refrain from admiring\nthe dresses; which he had himself devised. As for the venerable patron\nof art in Britain, he smiled when he met the lady of the house, and\nsighed when he glanced at Euphrosyne; but the first gave him a beautiful\nflower, and the other fastened it in his button-hole. He looked like\na victim bedecked by the priestesses of some old fane of Hellenic\nloveliness, and proud of his impending fate. What could the Psalmist\nmean in the immortal passage? Three-score-and-ten, at the present day,\nis the period of romantic passions. As for our enamoured sexagenarians,\nthey avenge the theories of our cold-hearted youth.\n\nMr. Phoebus was an eminent host. It delighted him to see people\npleased, and pleased under his influence. He had a belief, not without\nfoundation, that every thing was done better under his roof than under\nthat of any other person. The banquet in the air on the present occasion\ncould only be done justice to by the courtly painters of the reign\nof Louis XV. Vanloo, and Watteau, and Lancres, would have caught the\ngraceful group and the well-arranged colors, and the faces, some pretty,\nsome a little affected; the ladies on fantastic chairs of wicker-work,\ngilt and curiously painted; the gentlemen reclining on the turf, or\nbending behind them with watchful care. The little tables all different,\nthe soups in delicate cups of Sevres, the wines in golden glass of\nVenice, the ortolans, the Italian confectionery, the endless bouquets,\nwere worthy of the soft and invisible music that resounded from the\npavilion, only varied by the coquettish scream of some macaw, jealous,\namid all this novelty and excitement, of not being noticed.\n\n\"It is a scene of enchantment,\" whispered the chief patron of British\nart to Madame Phoebus.\n\n\"I always think luncheon in the air rather jolly,\" said Madame Phoebus.\n\n\"It is perfect romance!\" murmured the chief patron of British art to\nEuphrosyne.\n\n\"With a due admixture of reality,\" she said, helping him to an enormous\ntruffle, which she extracted from its napkin. \"You know you must eat it\nwith butter.\"\n\nLothair was glad to observe that, though in refined society, none\nwere present with whom he had any previous acquaintance, for he had an\ninstinctive feeling that if Hugo Bohun had been there, or Bertram,\nor the Duke of Brecon, or any ladies with whom he was familiarly\nacquainted, he would scarcely have been able to avail himself of the\nsociety of Theodora with the perfect freedom which he now enjoyed. They\nwould all have been asking who she was, where she came from, how long\nLothair had known her, all those questions, kind and neighborly, which\nunder such circumstances occur. He was in a distinguished circle, but\none different from that in which he lived. He sat next to Theodora, and\nMr. Phoebus constantly hovered about them, ever doing something very\ngraceful, or saying something very bright. Then he would whisper a word\nto the great Clorinda, who flashed intelligence from her celebrated\neyes, and then he made a suggestion to the aesthetical Lady Beatrice,\nwho immediately fell into enthusiasm and eloquence, and took the\nopportunity of displaying her celebrated hands.\n\nThe time had now arrived when they were to repair to the studio and view\nthe picture. A curtain was over it, and then a silken rope across the\nchamber, and then some chairs. The subject of the picture was Hero and\nLeander, chosen by the heir of all the Russias himself, during a late\nvisit to England.\n\n\"A fascinating subject,\" said old Cecrops to Mr. Phoebus, \"but not a\nvery original one.\"\n\n\"The originality of a subject is in its treatment,\" was the reply.\n\nThe theme, in the present instance, was certainly not conventionally\ntreated. When the curtain was withdrawn, they beheld a figure of\nlife-like size, exhibiting in undisguised completeness the perfection of\nthe female form, and yet the painter had so skilfully availed himself\nof the shadowy and mystic hour, and of some gauze-like drapery, which\nveiled without concealing his design, that the chastest eye might gaze\non his heroine with impunity. The splendor of her upstretched arms held\nhigh the beacon-light, which thew a glare upon the sublime anxiety of\nher countenance, while all the tumult of the Hellespont, the waves, the\nscudding sky, the opposite shore revealed by a blood-red flash, were\ntouched by the hand of a master who had never failed.\n\nThe applause was a genuine verdict, and the company after a time began\nto disperse about the house and gardens. A small circle remained,\nand, passing the silken rope, approached and narrowly scrutinized the\npicture. Among these were Theodora and Lothair, the chief patron of\nBritish art, an R. A. or two, Clorinda, and Lady Beatrice.\n\nMr. Phoebus, who left the studio but had now returned, did not disturb\nthem. After a while he approached the group. His air was elate, and was\nredeemed only from arrogance by the intellect of his brow. The circle\nstarted a little as they heard his voice, for they had been unaware of\nhis presence.\n\n\"To-morrow,\" he said, \"the critics will commence. You know who the\ncritics are? The men who have failed in literature and art.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 36\n\n\nThe lodge-gate of Belmont was opening as Lothair one morning approached\nit; a Hansom cab came forth, and in it was a person whose countenance\nwas strongly marked on the memory of Lothair. It was that of his unknown\nfriend at the Fenian meeting. Lothair instantly recognized and cordially\nsaluted him, and his greeting, though hurriedly, was not ungraciously\nreturned; but the vehicle did not stop. Lothair called to the driver to\nhalt; but the driver, on the contrary, stimulated his steed, and in the\nwinding lane was soon out of sight.\n\nTheodora was not immediately visible. She was neither in her usual\napartment nor in her garden; but it was only perhaps because Lothair was\nso full of his own impressions from his recent encounter at the lodge,\nthat he did not observe that the demeanor of Mrs. Campian, when she\nappeared, was hardly marked by her habitual serenity. She entered the\nroom hurriedly and spoke with quickness.\n\n\"Pray,\" exclaimed Lothair, rather eagerly, \"do tell me the name of the\ngentleman who has just called here.\"\n\nTheodora changed color, looked distressed, and was silent; unobserved,\nhowever, by Lothair, who, absorbed by his own highly-excited curiosity,\nproceeded to explain why he presumed to press for the information. \"I\nam under great obligations to that person; I am not sure I may not say I\nowe him my life, but certainly an extrication from great dander and very\nembarrassing danger too. I never saw him but once, and he would not give\nme his name, and scarcely would accept my thanks. I wanted to stop his\ncab to-day, but it was impossible. He literally galloped off.\"\n\n\"He is a foreigner,\" said Mrs Campian, who had recovered herself; \"he\nwas a particular friend of my dear father; and when he visits England,\nwhich he does occasionally, he calls to see us.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Lothair, \"I hope I shall soon have an opportunity of\nexpressing to him my gratitude.\"\n\n\"It was so like him not to give his name and to shrink from\nthanks,\" said Mrs. Campian. \"He never enters society, and makes no\nacquaintances.\"\n\n\"I am sorry for that,\" said Lothair, \"for it is not only that he served\nme, but I was much taken with him, and felt that he was a person I\nshould like to cultivate.\"\n\n\"Yes, Captain Bruges is a remarkable man,\" said Theodora; \"he is not one\nto be forgotten.\"\n\n\"Captain Bruges. That, then, is his name?\"\n\n\"He is known by the name of Captain Bruges,\" said Theodora, and she\nhesitated; and then speaking more quickly she added: \"I cannot sanction,\nI cannot bear, any deception between you and this roof. Bruges is not\nhis real name, nor is the title he assumes his real rank. He is not\nto be known, and not to be spoken of. He is one, and one of the most\neminent, of the great family of sufferers in this world, but sufferers\nfor a divine cause. I myself have been direly stricken in this struggle.\nWhen I remember the departed, it is not always easy to bear the thought.\nI keep it at the bottom of my heart; but this visit to-day has too\nterribly revived every thing. It is well that you only are here to\nwitness my suffering, but you will not have to witness it again, for we\nwill never again speak of these matters.\"\n\nLothair was much touched: his good heart and his good taste alike\ndissuaded him from attempting commonplace consolation. He ventured to\ntake her hand and pressed it to his lips. \"Dear lady!\" he murmured, and\nhe led her to a seat. \"I fear my foolish tattle has added to pain which\nI would gladly bear for you.\"\n\nThey talked about nothings: about a new horse which Colonel Campian had\njust purchased, and which he wanted to show to Lothair; an old opera\nrevived, but which sounded rather flat; something amusing that somebody\nhad said, and something absurd which somebody had done. And then, when\nthe ruffled feeling had been quite composed, and all had been brought\nback to the tenor of their usual pleasant life, Lothair said suddenly\nand rather gayly. \"And now, dearest lady, I have a favor to ask. You\nknow my majority is, to be achieved and to be celebrated next month.\nI hope that yourself and Colonel Campian will honor me by being my\nguests.\"\n\nTheodora did not at all look like a lady who had received a social\nattention of the most distinguished class. She looked embarrassed, and\nbegan to murmur something about Colonel Campian, and their never going\ninto society.\n\n\"Colonel Campian is going to Scotland, and you are going with him,\" said\nLothair. \"I know it, for he told me so, and said he could manage the\nvisit to me, if you approved it, quite well. In fact, it will fit in\nwith this Scotch visit.\"\n\n\"There was some talk once about Scotland,\" said Theodora, \"but that was\na long time ago. Many things have happened since then. I do not think\nthe Scotch visit is by any means so settled as you think.\"\n\n\"But, however that may be decided,\" said Lothair, \"there can be no\nreason why you should not come to me.\"\n\n\"It is presumptuous in me, a foreigner, to speak of such matters,\" said\nTheodora; \"but I fancy that, in such celebrations as you contemplate,\nthere is, or there should be, some qualification of blood or family\nconnection for becoming your guests. We should be there quite strangers,\nand in everybody's way, checking the local and domestic abandon which I\nshould suppose is one of the charms of such meetings.\"\n\n\"I have few relations and scarcely a connection,\" said Lothair rather\nmoodily. \"I can only ask friends to celebrate my majority, and there are\nno friends whom I so much regard as those who live at Belmont.\"\n\n\"It is very kind of you to say that, and to feel it; and I know that you\nwould not say it if you did not feel it,\" replied Theodora. \"But still,\nI think it would be better that we should come to see you at a time when\nyou are less engaged; perhaps you will take Colonel Campian down some\nday and give him some shooting.\"\n\n\"All I can say is that, if you do not come, it will be the darkest,\ninstead of the brightest, week in my life,\" said Lothair. \"In short, I\nfeel I could not get through the business; I should be so mortified. I\ncannot restrain my feelings or arrange my countenance. Unless you come,\nthe whole affair will be a complete failure, and worse than a failure.\"\n\n\"Well, I will speak to Colonel Campian about it,\" said Theodora, but\nwith little animation.\n\n\"We will both speak to him about it now,\" said Lothair, for the colonel\nat that moment entered the room and greeted Lothair, as was his custom,\ncordially.\n\n\"We are settling the visit to Muriel,\" said Lothair; \"I want to induce\nMrs. Campian to come down a day or two before the rest, so that we may\nhave the benefit of her counsel.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 37\n\n\nMuriel Tower crowned a wooded steep, part of a wild, and winding, and\nsylvan valley, at the bottom of which rushed a foaming stream. On the\nother side of the castle the scene, though extensive, was not less\nstriking, and was essentially romantic. A vast park spread in all\ndirections beyond the limit of the eye, and with much variety of\ncharacter--ornate near the mansion, and choicely timbered; in other\nparts glens and spreading dolls, masses of black pines and savage woods;\neverywhere, sometimes glittering, and sometimes sullen, glimpses of the\nlargest natural late that inland England boasts, Muriel Mere, and in the\nextreme distance moors, and the first crest of mountains. The park, too,\nwas full of life, for there were not only herds of red and fallow\ndeer, but, in its more secret haunts, wandered a race of wild-cattle,\nextremely savage, white and dove-colored, and said to be of the time of\nthe Romans.\n\nIt was not without emotion that Lothair beheld the chief seat of his\nrace. It was not the first time he had visited it. He had a clear and\npainful recollection of a brief, hurried, unkind glimpse caught of it\nin his very earliest boyhood. His uncle had taken him there by some\ninconvenient cross-railroad, to avail themselves of which they had risen\nin the dark on a March morning, and in an east wind. When they arrived\nat their station they had hired an open fly drawn by a single horse,\nand, when they had thus at last reached the uninhabited Towers, they\nentered by the offices, where Lothair was placed in the steward's room,\nby a smoky fire, given something to eat, and told that he might walk\nabout and amuse himself, provided he did not go out of sight of the\ncastle, while his uncle and the steward mounted their horses and rode\nover the estate; leaving Lothair for hours without companions, and\nreturning just in time, in a shivering twilight, to clutch him up, as it\nwere, by the nape of the neck, twist him back again into the one-horse\nfly, and regain the railroad; his uncle praising himself the whole time\nfor the satisfactory and business-like manner in which he had planned\nand completed the edition.\n\nWhat a contrast to present circumstances! Although Lothair had wished,\nand thought he had secured, that his arrival at Muriel should be quite\nprivate, and even unknown, and that all ceremonies and celebrations\nshould be postponed for a few days, during which he hoped to become a\nlittle more familiar with his home, the secret could not be kept, and\nthe county would not tolerate this reserve. He was met at the station by\nfive hundred horsemen, all well mounted, and some of them gentlemen\nof high degree, who insisted upon accompanying him to his gates. His\ncarriage passed under triumphal arches, and choirs of enthusiastic\nchildren; waving parochial banners, hymned his auspicious approach.\n\nAt the park gates his cavalcade quitted him with that delicacy of\nfeeling which always distinguishes Englishmen, however rough their\nhabit. As their attendance was self-invited, they would not intrude upon\nhis home.\n\n\"Your lordship will have enough to do to-day, without being troubled\nwith us,\" said their leader, as he shook hands with Lothair.\n\nBut Lothair would not part with them thus. With the inspiring\nrecollection of his speech at the Fenian meeting, Lothair was not afraid\nof rising in his barouche and addressing them. What he said was said\nvery well and it was addressed to a people who, though the shyest in\nthe world, have a passion for public speaking, than which no achievement\nmore tests reserve. It was something to be a great peer and a great\nproprietor, and to be young and singularly well-favored; but to be able\nto make a speech, and such a good one, such cordial words in so strong\nand musical a voice--all felt at once they were in the presence of the\nnatural leader of the county. The enthusiasm of the hunting-field burst\nforth. They gave him three ringing cheers, and jostled their horses\nforward, that they might grasp his hand.\n\nThe park gates were open, and the postillions dashed along through\nscenes of loveliness on which Lothair would fain have lingered, but be\nconsoled himself with the recollection that he should probably have an\nopportunity of seeing them again. Sometimes his carriage seemed in\nthe heart of an ancient forest; sometimes the deer, startled at his\napproach, were scudding over expanding lawns; then his course wound by\nthe margin of a sinuous lake with green islands and golden gondolas;\nand then, after advancing through stately avenues, he arrived at\nmighty gates of wondrous workmanship, that once had been the boast of a\ncelebrated convent on the Danube, but which, in the days of revolutions,\nhad reached England, and had been obtained by the grandfather of Lothair\nto guard the choice demesne that was the vicinage of his castle.\n\nWhen we remember that Lothair, notwithstanding his rank and vast\nwealth, had never, from the nature of things, been the master of an\nestablishment, it must be admitted that the present occasion was a\nlittle trying for his nerves. The whole household of the Towers were\narrayed and arranged in groups on the steps of the chief entrance. The\nsteward of the estate, who had been one of the cavalcade, had galloped\non before, and he was, of course, the leading spirit, and extended\nhis arm to his lord as Lothair descended from his carriage. The\nhouse-steward, the chief butler, the head-gardener, the chief of the\nkitchen, the head-keeper, the head-forester, and grooms of the stud and\nof the chambers, formed one group behind the housekeeper, a grave and\ndistinguished-looking female, who courtesied like the old court; half\na dozen powdered gentlemen, glowing, in crimson liveries, indicated\nthe presence of my lord's footmen; while the rest of the household,\nconsiderable in numbers, were arranged in two groups, according to their\nsex, and at a respectful distance.\n\nWhat struck Lothair--who was always thinking, and who had no\ninconsiderable fund of humor in his sweet and innocent nature--was the\nwonderful circumstance that, after so long an interval of neglect\nand abeyance, he should find himself the master of so complete and\nconsummate a household.\n\n\"Castles and parks,\" he thought, \"I had a right to count on, and,\nperhaps, even pictures, but how I came to possess such a work of art\nas my groom of the chambers, who seems as respectfully haughty, and as\ncalmly grateful, as if he were at Brentham itself, and whose coat must\nhave been made in Saville Row, quite bewilders me.\"\n\nBut Lothair, though he appreciated Putney Giles, had not yet formed a\nfull conception of the resource and all-accomplished providence of that\nwondrous man, acting under the inspiration of the consummate Apollonia.\n\nPassing through the entrance-hall, a lofty chamber, though otherwise of\nmoderate dimensions, Lothair was ushered into his armory, a gallery two\nhundred feet long, with suits of complete mail ranged on each side,\nand the walls otherwise covered with rare and curious weapons. It was\nimpossible, even for the master of this collection, to suppress the\ndelight and the surprise with which he beheld the scene. We must\nremember, in his excuse, that he beheld it for the first time.\n\nThe armory led to a large and lofty octagonal chamber, highly decorated,\nin the centre of which was the tomb of Lothair's grandfather. He had\nraised it in his lifetime. The tomb was of alabaster surrounded by\na railing of pure gold, and crowned with a recumbent figure of the\ndeceased in his coronet--a fanciful man, who lived in solitude, building\ncastles and making gardens.\n\nWhat charmed Lothair most as he proceeded were the number of courts and\nquadrangles in the castle, all of bright and fantastic architecture, and\neach of which was a garden, glowing with brilliant colors, and gay with\nthe voice of fountains or the forms of gorgeous birds. Our young friend\ndid not soon weary in his progress; even the suggestions of the steward,\nthat his lordship's luncheon was at command, did not restrain him.\nBallrooms, and baronial halls, and long libraries with curiously-stained\nwindows, and suites of dazzling saloons, where he beheld the original\nportraits of his parents, of which he had miniatures--he saw them\nall, and was pleased, and interested. But what most struck and even\nastonished him was the habitable air which pervaded the whole of this\nenormous structure; too rare even when families habitually reside in\nsuch dwellings; but almost inconceivable, when it was to be remembered\nthat more than a generation had passed without a human being living in\nthese splendid chambers, scarcely a human word being spoken in them.\nThere was not a refinement of modern furniture that was wanting; even\nthe tables were covered with the choicest publications of the day.\n\n\"Mr. Putney Giles proposes to arrive here to-morrow,\" said the steward.\n\"He thought your lordship would like to be a day or two alone.\"\n\n\"He is the most sensible man I know,\" said Lothair; \"he always does the\nright thing. I think I will have my luncheon now, Mr. Harvey, and I will\ngo ever the cellars to-morrow.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 38\n\n\nYes; Lothair wished to be alone. He had naturally a love of solitude,\nbut the events of the last few hours lent an additional inducement\nto meditation. He was impressed, in a manner and degree not before\nexperienced, with the greatness of his inheritance. His worldly\nposition, until to-day, had been an abstraction. After all, he had only\nbeen one of a crowd, which he resembled. But the sight of this proud and\nabounding territory, and the unexpected encounter with his neighbors,\nbrought to him a sense of power and of responsibility. He shrank from\nneither. The world seemed opening to him with all its delights, and\nwith him duty was one. He was also sensible of the beautiful, and the\nsurrounding forms of nature and art charmed him. Let us not forget that\nextreme youth and perfect health were ingredients not wanting in the\nspell any more than power or wealth. Was it, then, complete? Not without\nthe influence of woman.\n\nTo that gentle yet mystical sway the spirit of Lothair had yielded. What\nwas the precise character of his feelings to Theodora--what were\nhis hopes, or views--he had hitherto had neither the time nor the\ninclination to make certain. The present was so delightful, and the\nenjoyment of her society had been so constant and complete, that he\nhad ever driven the future from his consideration. Had the conduct of\nTheodora been different, had she deigned to practise on his affections,\nappealed to his sensibility, stimulated or piqued his vanity, it might\nhave been otherwise. In the distraction of his heart, or the disturbance\nof his temper, he might have arrived at conclusions, and even expressed\nthem, incompatible with the exquisite and even sublime friendship, which\nhad so strangely and beautifully arisen, like a palace in a dream, and\nabsorbed his being. Although their acquaintance could hardly be numbered\nby months, there was no living person of whom he had seen so much, or to\nwhom he had opened his heart and mind with such profuse ingenuousness.\nNor on her part, though apparently shrinking from egotism, had there\never been any intellectual reserve. On the contrary, although never\nauthoritative, and, even when touching on her convictions, suggesting\nrather than dictating them, Lothair could not but feel that, during\nthe happy period he had passed in her society, not only his taste had\nrefined but his mind had considerably opened; his views had become\nlarger, his sympathies had expanded; he considered with charity things\nand even persons from whom a year ago he would have recoiled with alarm\nor aversion.\n\nThe time during which Theodora had been his companion was the happiest\nperiod of his life. It was more than that; he could conceive no felicity\ngreater, and all that he desired was that it should endure. Since they\nfirst met, scarcely four-and-twenty hours had passed without his being\nin her presence; and now, notwithstanding the novelty and the variety of\nthe objects around him and the vast, and urgent, and personal interest\nwhich they involve he felt a want which meeting her, or the daily\nprospect of meeting her, could alone supply. Her voice lingered in his\near; he gazed upon a countenance invisible to others; and he scarcely\nsaw or did any thing without almost unconsciously associating with it\nher opinion or approbation.\n\nWell, then, the spell was complete. The fitfulness or melancholy which\nso often is the doom of youth, however otherwise favored, who do not\nlove, was not the condition, capricious or desponding, of Lothair. In\nhim combined all the accidents and feelings which enchant existence.\n\nHe had been rambling in the solitudes of his park, and had thrown\nhimself on the green shadow of a stately tree, his cheek resting on his\narm, and lost in reverie amid the deep and sultry silence. Wealthy and\nyoung, noble and full of noble thoughts, with the inspiration of health,\nsurrounded by the beautiful, and his heart softened by feelings as\nexquisite, Lothair, nevertheless, could not refrain from pondering over\nthe mystery of that life which seemed destined to bring to him only\ndelight.\n\n\"Life would be perfect,\" he at length exclaimed, \"if it would only\nlast.\" But it will not last; and what then? He could not reconcile\ninterest in this life with the conviction of another, and an eternal\none. It seemed to him that, with such a conviction, man could have only\none thought and one occupation--the future, and preparation for it. With\nsuch a conviction, what they called reality appeared to him more vain\nand nebulous than the scones and sights of sleep. And he had that\nconviction; at least he had it once. Had he it now? Yes; he had it now,\nbut modified, perhaps, in detail. He was not so confident as he was a\nfew months ago, that he could be ushered by a Jesuit from his deathbed\nto the society of St. Michael and all the angels. There might be long\nprocesses of initiation--intermediate states of higher probation and\nrefinement. There might be a horrible and apathetic pause. When millions\nof ages appeared to be necessary to mature the crust of a rather\ninsignificant planet, it might be presumption in man to assume that his\nsoul, though immortal, was to reach its final destination regardless of\nall the influences of space and time.\n\nAnd the philosophers and distinguished men of science with whom of late\nhe had frequently enjoyed the opportunity of becoming acquainted, what\nwere their views? They differed among themselves: did any of them agree\nwith him? How they accounted for every thing except the only point\non which man requires revelation! Chance, necessity, atomic theories,\nnebular hypotheses, development, evolution, the origin of worlds, human\nancestry--here were high topics, on none of which was there lack of\nargument; and, in a certain sense, of evidence; and what then? There\nmust be design. The reasoning and the research of all philosophy could\nnot be valid against that conviction. If there were no design, why,\nit would all be nonsense; and he could not believe in nonsense. And if\nthere were design, there must be intelligence; and if intelligence,\npure intelligence; and pure intelligence was inconsistent with\nany disposition but perfect good. But between the all-wise and the\nall-benevolent and man, according to the new philosophers, no relations\nwere to be any longer acknowledged. They renounce in despair the\npossibility of bringing man into connection with that First Cause which\nthey can neither explain nor deny. But man requires that there shall be\ndirect relations between the created and the Creator; and that in those\nrelations he should find a solution of the perplexities of existence.\nThe brain that teems with illimitable thought, will never recognize\nas his creator any power of Nature, however irresistible, that is not\ngifted with consciousness. Atheism may be consistent with fine taste,\nand fine taste under certain conditions may for a time regulate a\npolished society; but ethics with atheism are impossible; and without\nethics no human order can be strong or permanent.\n\nThe Church comes forward, and, without equivocation, offers to establish\ndirect relations between God and man. Philosophy denies its title, and\ndisputes its power. Why? Because they are founded on the supernatural.\nWhat is the supernatural? Can there be any thing more miraculous\nthan the existence of man and the world?--any thing more literally\nsupernatural than the origin of things? The Church explains what no one\nelse pretends to explain, and which, every one agrees, it is of first\nmoment should be made clear.\n\nThe clouds of a summer eve were glowing in the creative and flickering\nblaze of the vanished sun, that had passed like a monarch from the\nadmiring sight, yet left his pomp behind. The golden and amber vapors\nfell into forms that to the eye of the musing Lothair depicted the\nobjects of his frequent meditation. There seemed to rise in the horizon\nthe dome and campaniles and lofty aisles of some celestial fane, such as\nhe had often more than dreamed of raising to the revealed author of life\nand death. Altars arose and sacred shrines, and delicate chantries and\nfretted spires; now the flashing phantom of heavenly choirs, and then\nthe dim response of cowled and earthly cenobites:\n\n\"These are black Vesper's pageants!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 39\n\n\nLothair was quite glad to see Mr. Putney Giles. That gentleman indeed\nwas a universal favorite. He was intelligent, acquainted with every\nthing except theology and metaphysics, to oblige, a little to patronize,\nnever made difficulties, and always overcame them. His bright blue eyes,\nopen forehead, and sunny face, indicated a man fall of resources, and\nwith a temper of natural sweetness.\n\nThe lawyer and his noble client had a great deal of business to\ntransact. Lothair was to know his position in detail preparatory to\nreleasing his guardians from their responsibilities, and assuming the\nmanagement of his own affairs. Mr. Putney Giles was a first-rate man\nof business. With all his pleasant, easy manner, he was precise and\nmethodical, and was not content that his client should be less master\nof his own affairs than his lawyer. The mornings passed over a table\ncovered with dispatch boxes and piles of ticketed and banded papers, and\nthen they looked after the workmen who were preparing for the impending\nfestivals, or rode over the estate.\n\n\"That is our weak point,\" said Mr. Putney Giles, pointing to a distant\npart of the valley. \"We ought to have both sides of the valley. Your\nlordship will have to consider whether you can devote the two hundred\nthousand pounds of the second and extinct trust to a better purpose than\nin obtaining that estate.\"\n\nLothair had always destined that particular sum for the cathedral, the\nraising of which was to have been the first achievement of his majority;\nbut he did not reply.\n\nIn a few days the guests began to arrive, but gradually. The duke and\nduchess and Lady Corisande came the first, and were one day alone with\nLothair, for Mr. Putney Giles had departed to fetch Apollonia.\n\nLothair was unaffectedly gratified at not only receiving his friends at\nhis own castle, but under these circumstances of intimacy. They had\nbeen the first persons who had been kind to him, and he really loved the\nwhole family. They arrived rather late, but he would show them to their\nrooms--and they were choice ones--himself, and then they dined together\nin the small green dining-room. Nothing could be more graceful or\nmore cordial than the whole affair. The duchess seemed to beam with\naffectionate pleasure as Lothair fulfilled his duties as their host;\nthe duke praised the claret, and he seldom praised any thing; while Lady\nCorisande only regretted that the impending twilight had prevented her\nfrom seeing the beautiful country, and expressed lively interest in the\nmorrow's inspection of the castle and domain. Sometimes her eyes met\nthose of Lothair, and she was so happy that she unconsciously smiled.\n\n\"And-to-morrow,\" said Lothair, \"I am delighted to say, we shall have to\nourselves; at least all the morning. We will see the castle first, and\nthen, after luncheon, we will drive about everywhere.\"\n\n\"Everywhere,\" said Corisande.\n\n\"It was very nice your asking us first, and alone,\" said the duchess.\n\n\"It was very nice in your coming, dear duchess,\" said Lothair, \"and most\nkind--as you ever are to me.\"\n\n\"Duke of Brecon is coming to you on Thursday,\" said the duke; \"he told\nme so at White's.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you would like to know, duchess, whom you are going to meet,\"\nsaid Lothair.\n\n\"I should much like to hear. Pray tell us.\"\n\n\"It is a rather formidable array,\" said Lothair, and he took out a\npaper. \"First, there are all the notables of the county. I do not know\nany of them personally, so I wrote to each of them a letter, as well as\nsending them a formal invitation. I thought that was right.\"\n\n\"Quite right,\" said the duchess. \"Nothing could be more proper.\"\n\n\"Well, the first person, of course, is the lord-lieutenant. He is\ncoming.\"\n\n\"By-the-by, let me see, who is your lord-lieutenant?\" said the duke.\n\n\"Lord Agramont.\"\n\n\"To be sure. I was at college with him; a very good fellow; but I have\nnever met him since, except once at Boodle's; and I never saw a man so\nred and gray, and I remember him such a good-looking fellow! He must\nhave lived immensely in the country, and never thought of his person,\"\nsaid the duke in a tone of pity, and playing with his mustache.\n\n\"Is there a Lady Agramont?\" inquired the duchess.\n\n\"Oh, yes! and she also honors me with her presence,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"And who was Lady Agramont?\"\n\n\"Oh! his cousin,\" said the duke. \"The Agramonts always marry their\ncousins. His father did the same thing. They are so shy. It is a family\nthat never was in society, and never will be. I was at Agramont Castle\nonce when I was at college, and I never shall forget it. We used to\nsit down forty or fifty every day to dinner, entirely maiden aunts and\nclergymen, and that sort of thing. However, I shall be truly glad to see\nAgramont again, for, notwithstanding all these disadvantages, he is a\nthoroughly good fellow.\"\n\n\"Then there is the high-sheriff,\" continued Lothair; \"and both the\ncounty members and their wives; and Mrs. High-Sheriff too. I believe\nthere is some tremendous question respecting the precedency of this\nlady. There is no doubt that, in the county, the high-sheriff takes\nprecedence of every one, even of the lord-lieutenant; but how about his\nwife? Perhaps your grace could aid me? Mr. Putney Giles said he would\nwrite about it to the Heralds' College.\"\n\n\"I should give her the benefit of any doubt,\" said the duchess.\n\n\"And then our bishop is coming;\" said Lothair.\n\n\"Oh! I am so glad you have asked the bishop,\" said Lady Corisande.\n\n\"There could be no doubt about it,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"I do not know how his lordship will get on with one of my guardians,\nthe cardinal; but his eminence is not here in a priestly character; and,\nas for that, there is less chance of his differing with the cardinal\nthan with my other guardian Lord Culloden, who is a member of the Free\nKirk.\"\n\n\"Is Lord Culloden coming?\" said the duchess.\n\n\"Yes, and with two daughters, Flora and Grizell. I remember my cousins,\ngood-natured little girls; but Mr. Putney Giles tells me that the\nshortest is six feet high.\"\n\n\"I think we shall have a very amusing party,\" said the duchess.\n\n\"You know all the others,\" said Lothair. \"No, by-the-by, there is the\ndean of my college coming, and Monsignore Catesby, a great friend of the\nSt. Jeromes.\"\n\nLady Corisande looked grave.\n\n\"The St. Jeromes will be here to-morrow,\" continued Lothair, \"and the\nMontairys and the St. Aldegondes. I have half an idea that Bertram and\nCarisbrooke and Hugo Bohun will be here to-night--Duke of Brecon\non Thursday; and that, I think, is all, except an American lady and\ngentleman, whom, I think, you will like--great friends of mine; I knew\nthem this year at Oxford, and the were very kind to me. He is a man of\nconsiderable fortune; they have lived at Paris a good deal.\"\n\n\"I have known Americans who lived at Paris,\" said the duke; \"very good\nsort of people, and no end of money some of them.\"\n\n\"I believe Colonel Campian has large estates in the South,\" said\nLothair; \"but, though really I have no right to speak of his affairs, he\nmust have suffered very much.\"\n\n\"Well, he has the consolation of suffering in a good cause,\" said\nthe duke. \"I shall be happy to make his acquaintance. I look upon an\nAmerican gentleman with large estates in the South as a real aristocrat;\nand; whether he gets his rents, or whatever his returns may be, or not,\nI should always treat him with respect.\"\n\n\"I have heard the American women are very pretty,\" said Lady Corisande.\n\n\"Mrs. Campian is very distinguished,\" said Lothair; \"but I think she was\nan Italian.\"\n\n\"They promise to be an interesting addition to our party,\" said the\nduchess, and she rose.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 40\n\n\nThere never was any thing so successful as the arrangements of the\nnext day. After breakfast they inspected the castle, and in the easiest\nmanner, without form and without hurry, resting occasionally in a\ngallery or a saloon, never examining a cabinet, and only looking at a\npicture now and then. Generally speaking, nothing is more fatiguing than\nthe survey of a great house; but this enterprise was conducted with\nso much tact and consideration, and much which they had to see was so\nbeautiful and novel, that every one was interested, and remained quite\nfresh for their subsequent exertions. \"And then the duke is so much\namused,\" said the duchess to her daughter, delighted at the unusual\nexcitement of the handsome, but somewhat too serene, partner of her\nlife.\n\nAfter luncheon they visited the gardens, which had been formed in a\nsylvan valley, enclosed with gilded gates. The creator of this, paradise\nhad been favored by Nature, and had availed himself of this opportunity.\nThe contrast between the parterres, blazing with color, and the sylvan\nbackground, the undulating paths over romantic heights, the fanes and\nthe fountains, the glittering statues, and the Babylonian terraces,\nformed a whole, much of which was beautiful, and all of which was\nstriking and singular.\n\n\"Perhaps too many temples,\" said Lothair; \"but this ancestor of mine had\nsome imagination.\"\n\nA carriage met them on the other side of the valley, and then they soon\nentered the park.\n\n\"I am almost as much a stranger here as yourself, dear duchess,\" said\nLothair; \"but I have seen some parts which, I think, will please you.\"\nAnd they commenced a drive of varying, but unceasing, beauty.\n\n\"I hope I see the wild-cattle,\" said Lady Corisande.\n\nLady Corisande saw the wild-cattle, and many other things, which\ngratified and charmed her. It was a long drive, even of hours, and yet\nno one was, for a moment, wearied.\n\n\"What a delightful day!\" Lady Corisande exclaimed in her mother's\ndressing-room. \"I have never seen any place so beautiful.\"\n\n\"I agree with you,\" said the duchess; \"but what pleases me most are his\nmanners. They were always kind and natural; but they are so polished--so\nexactly what they ought to be; and he always says the right thing. I\nnever knew any one who had so matured.\"\n\n\"Yes; it is very little more than a year since he came to us at\nBrentham,\" said Lady Corisande, thoughtfully. \"Certainly he has greatly\nchanged. I remember he could hardly open his lips; and now I think him\nvery agreeable.\"\n\n\"He is more than that,\" said the duchess; \"he is interesting.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Lady Corisande; \"he is interesting.\"\n\n\"What delights me,\" said the duchess, \"is to see his enjoyment of his\nposition. He seems to take such an interest in every thing. It makes me\nhappy to see him so happy.\"\n\n\"Well, I hardly know,\" said Lady Corisande, \"about that. There is\nsomething occasionally about his expression which I should hardly\ndescribe as indicative of happiness or content. It would be ungrateful\nto describe one as distrait, who seems to watch all one wants, and hangs\non every word; and yet--especially as we returned, and when we were all\nof us a little silent--there was a remarkable abstraction about him; I\ncaught it once or twice before, earlier in the day; his mind seemed in\nanother place, and anxiously.\"\n\n\"He has a great deal to think of,\" said the duchess.\n\n\"I fear it is that dreadful Monsignore Catesby,\" said Lady Corisande,\nwith a sigh.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 41\n\n\nThe arrival of the guests was arranged with judgment. The personal\nfriends came first; the formal visitors were invited only for the day\nbefore the public ceremonies commenced. No more dinners in small green\ndining-rooms. While the duchess was dressing, Bertha St. Aldegonde and\nVictoria Montairy, who had just arrived, came in to give her a rapid\nembrace while their own toilets were unpacking.\n\n\"Granville, has come, mamma; I did not think that he would till the last\nmoment. He said he was so afraid of being bored. There is a large party\nby this train; the St. Jeromes, Bertram, Mr. Bohun, Lord Carisbrooke,\nand some others we do not know.\"\n\nThe cardinal had been expected to-day, but he had telegraphed that his\narrival must be postponed in consequence: of business until the morrow,\nwhich day had been previously fixed for the arrival of his fellow\nguardian and trustee, the Earl of Culloden, and his daughters, the\nLadies Flora and Grizell Falkirk. Monsignore Catesby had, however,\narrived by this train, and the persons \"whom they did not know,\" the\nCampians.\n\nLothair waited on Colonel Campian immediately and welcomed him, but he\ndid not see Theodora. Still he had inquired after her, and left her\na message, and hoped that she would take some tea; and thus, as he\nflattered himself, broken a little the strangeness of their meeting\nunder his roof; but, notwithstanding all this, when she really entered\nthe drawing-room he was seized with such a palpitation of the heart that\nfor a moment he thought he should be unequal to the situation. But the\nserenity of Theodora reassured him. The Campians came in late, and all\neyes were upon them. Lothair presented Theodora to the duchess, who,\nbeing prepared for the occasion, said exactly the right thing in the\nbest manner, and invited Mrs. Campian to sit by her, and then, Theodora\nbeing launched, Lothair whispered something to the duke, who nodded,\nand the colonel was introduced to his grace. The duke, always polite but\ngenerally cold, was more than courteous--he was cordial; he seemed\nto enjoy the opportunity of expressing his high consideration for a\ngentleman of the Southern States.\n\nSo the first step was over; Lothair recovered himself; the palpitation\nsubsided; and the world still went on. The Campians had made a good\nstart, and the favorable impression hourly increased. At dinner\nTheodora sat between Lord St. Jerome and Bertram, and talked more to the\nmiddle-aged peer than to the distinguished youth, who would willingly\nhave engrossed her attention. All mothers admire such discretion,\nespecially in a young and beautiful married woman, so the verdict of the\nevening among the great ladies was, that Theodora was distinguished, and\nthat all she said or did was in good taste. On the plea of her being\na foreigner, she was at once admitted into a certain degree of social\nintimacy. Had she had the misfortune of being native-born and had\nflirted with Bertram, she would probably, particularly with so much\nbeauty, have been looked upon as \"a horrid woman,\" and have been\nrelegated for amusement, during her visit, to the attentions of the dark\nsex. But, strange to say, the social success of Colonel Campian was not\nless eminent than that of his distinguished wife. The character which\nthe duke gave of him commanded universal sympathy. \"You know he is a\ngentleman,\" said the duke; \"he is not a Yankee. People make the greatest\nmistakes about these things. He is a gentleman of the South; they have\nno property, but land; and I am told his territory was immense. He\nalways lived at Paris, and in the highest style--disgusted, of course,\nwith his own country. It is not unlikely he may have lost his estates\nnow; but that makes no difference to me. I shall treat him, and all\nSouthern gentlemen, as our fathers treated the emigrant nobility of\nFrance.\"\n\n\"Hugo,\" said St. Aldegonde to Mr. Bohun, \"I wish you would tell Bertha\nto come to me. I want her. She is talking to a lot of women at the other\nend of the room, and, if I go to her, I am afraid they will get hold of\nme.\"\n\nThe future duchess, who lived only to humor her lord, was at his side in\nan instant. \"You wanted me, Granville?\"\n\n\"Yes; you know I was afraid, Bertha, I should be bored here. I am not\nbored. I like this American fellow. He understands the only two subjects\nwhich interest me; horses and tobacco.\"\n\n\"I am charmed, Granville, that you are not bored; I told mamma that you\nwere very much afraid you would be.\"\n\n\"Yes; but I tell you what, Bertha, I cannot stand any of the ceremonies.\nI shall go before they begin. Why cannot Lothair be content with\nreceiving his friends in a quiet way? It is all humbug about the county.\nIf he wants to do something for the county, he can build a wing to the\ninfirmary, or something of that sort, and not bore us with speeches and\nfireworks. It is a sort of thing I cannot stand.\"\n\n\"And you shall not, dear Granville. The moment you are bored, you shall\ngo. Only you are not bored at present.\"\n\n\"Not at present; but I expected to be.\"\n\n\"Yes; so I told mamma; but that makes the present more delightful.\"\n\nThe St. Jeromes were going to Italy and immediately. Their departure had\nonly been postponed in order that they might be present at the majority\nof Lothair. Miss Arundel had at length succeeded in her great object.\nThey were to pass the winter at Rome. Lord St. Jerome was quite pleased\nat having made the acquaintance at dinner of a Roman lady, who spoke\nEnglish so perfectly; and Lady St. Jerome, who in consequence fastened\nupon Theodora, was getting into ecstasies, which would have been\nembarrassing had not her new acquaintance skilfully checked her.\n\n\"We must be satisfied that we both admire Rome,\" said Mrs. Campian,\n\"though we admire it for different reasons. Although a Roman, I am not a\nRoman Catholic; and Colonel Campian's views on Italian affairs generally\nwould, I fear, not entirely agree with Lord St. Jerome's.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" said Lady St. Jerome, gracefully dropping the subject, and\nremembering that Colonel Campian was a citizen of the United States,\nwhich accounted in her apprehension for his peculiar opinions.\n\nLothair, who had been watching his opportunity the whole evening,\napproached Theodora. He meant to have expressed his hope that she was\nnot wearied by her journey, but instead of that he said, \"Your presence\nhere makes me inexpressibly happy.\"\n\n\"I think everybody seems happy to be your guest,\" she replied,\nparrying, as was her custom, with a slight kind smile, and a low, sweet,\nunembarrassed voice, any personal allusion from Lothair of unusual\nenergy or ardor.\n\n\"I wanted to meet you at the station to-day,\" he continued, \"but there\nwere so many people coming, that--\" and he hesitated.\n\n\"It would really have been more embarrassing to us than to yourself,\"\nshe said. \"Nothing could be better than all the arrangements.\"\n\n\"I sent my own brougham to you,\" said Lothair. \"I hope there was no\nmistake about it.\"\n\n\"None: your servant gave us your kind message; and as for the carriage,\nit was too delightful. Colonel Campian was so; pleased with it, that he\nhas promised to give me one, with your permission, exactly the same.\"\n\n\"I wish you would accept the one you used to-day.\"\n\n\"You are too magnificent; you really must try to forget, with us,\nthat you are the lord of Muriel Towers. But I will willingly use your\ncarriages as much as you please, for I caught glimpses of beauty to-day\nin our progress from the station that made me anxious to explore your\ndelightful domain.\"\n\nThere was a slight burst of merriment from a distant part of the room,\nand everybody looked around. Colonel Campian had been telling a story to\na group formed of the duke, St. Aldegonde, and Mr. Bohun.\n\n\"Best story I ever heard In my life,\" exclaimed St. Aldegonde, who\nprided himself, when he did laugh, which was rare, on laughing loud. But\neven the duke tittered, and Hugo Bohun smiled.\n\n\"I am glad to see the colonel get on so well with every one,\" said\nLothair; \"I was afraid he might have been bored.\"\n\n\"He does not know what that means,\" said Theodora; \"and he is so natural\nand so sweet-tempered, and so intelligent, that it seems to me he always\nis popular.\"\n\n\"Do you think that will be a match?\" said Monsignore Catesby to Miss\nArundel.\n\n\"Well, I rather believe in the Duke of Brecon,\" she replied. They were\nreferring to Lord Carisbrooke, who appeared to be devoted to Lady\nCorisande. \"Do you admire the American lady?\"\n\n\"Who is an Italian, they tell me, though she does not look like one.\nWhat do you think of her?\" said the monsignore, evading, as was his\ncustom, a direct reply.\n\n\"Well, I think she is very distinguished: unusual. I wonder where our\nhost became acquainted with them? Do you know?\"\n\n\"Not yet: but I dare say Mr. Bohun can tell us;\" and he addressed that\ngentleman accordingly as he was passing by.\n\n\"Not the most remote idea,\" said Mr. Bohun. \"You know the colonel is not\na Yankee; he is a tremendous swell. The duke says, with more land than\nhe has.\"\n\n\"He seems an agreeable person,\" said Miss Arundel.\n\n\"Well, he tell anecdotes; he has just been telling one; Granville likes\nanecdotes; they amuse him, and he likes to be amused: that is all he\ncares about. I hate anecdotes, and I always get away when conversation\nfalls into, what Pinto calls, its anecdotage.\"\n\n\"You do not like to be amused?\"\n\n\"Not too much; I like to be interested.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Miss Arundel, \"so long as a person can talk agreeably, I am\nsatisfied. I think to talk well a rare gift; quite as rare as singing;\nand yet you expect every one to be able to talk, and very few to be able\nto sing.\"\n\n\"There are amusing people who do not interest,\" said the monsignore,\n\"and interesting people who do not amuse. What I like is an agreeable\nperson.\"\n\n\"My idea of an agreeable person,\" said Hugo Bohun, \"is a person who\nagrees with me.\"\n\n\"Talking of singing, something is going to happen,\" said Miss Arundel.\n\nA note was heard; a celebrated professor had entered the room and was\nseated at the piano, which he had just touched. There was a general\nand unconscious hush, and the countenance of Lord St. Aldegonde wore\na rueful expression. But affairs turned out better than could be\nanticipated. A young and pretty girl, dressed in white, with a gigantic\nsash of dazzling beauty, played upon the violin with a grace, and\nsentimental and marvellous skill, and passionate expression, worthy of\nSt. Cecilia. She was a Hungarian lady, and this was her English debut.\nEverybody praised her, and every body was pleased; and Lord St.\nAldegonde, instead of being bored, took a wondrous rose out of his\nbutton-hole and presented it to her.\n\nThe performance only lasted half an hour, and then the ladies began to\nthink of their bowers. Lady St. Aldegonde, before she quit the room, was\nin earnest conversation with her lord.\n\n\"I have arranged all that you wished, Granville,\" she said, speaking\nrapidly and holding a candlestick. \"We are to see the castle to-morrow,\nand the gardens and the parks and every thing else, but you are not to\nbe bored at all, and not to lose your shooting. The moors are sixteen\nmiles off, but our host says, with an omnibus and a good team--and\nhe will give you a first-rate one--you can do it in an hour and ten\nminutes, certainly an hour and a quarter; and you are to make your own\nparty in the smoking-room to-night, and take a capital luncheon with\nyou.\"\n\n\"All right: I shall ask the Yankee; and I should like to take that\nHungarian girl too, if she would only fiddle to us at luncheon.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 42\n\n\nNext day the cardinal, with his secretary and his chaplain, arrived.\nMonsignore Catesby received his eminence at the station and knelt and\nkissed his hand as he stepped from the carriage. The monsignore had\nwonderfully manoeuvred that the whole of the household should have\nbeen marshalled to receive this prince of the Church, and perhaps have\nperformed the same ceremony: no religious recognition, he assured them,\nin the least degree involved, only an act of not unusual respect to a\nforeign prince; but considering that the bishop of the diocese and\nhis suite were that day expected, to say nothing of the Presbyterian\nguardian, probably arriving by the same train, Lothair would not be\npersuaded to sanction any ceremony whatever. Lady St. Jerome and Miss\nArundel, however, did their best to compensate for this omission with\nreverences which a posture-master might have envied, and certainly would\nnot have surpassed. They seemed to sink into the earth, and then slowly\nand supernaturally to emerge. The bishop had been at college with the\ncardinal and intimate with him, though they now met for the first time\nsince his secession--a not uninteresting rencounter. The bishop was\nhigh-church, and would not himself have made a bad cardinal, being\npolished and plausible, well-lettered, yet quite a man of the world.\nHe was fond of society, and justified his taste in this respect by the\nflattering belief that by his presence he was extending the power of the\nChurch; certainly favoring an ambition which could not be described as\nbeing moderate. The bishop had no abstract prejudice against gentlemen\nwho wore red hats, and under ordinary circumstances would have welcomed\nhis brother churchman with unaffected cordiality, not to say sympathy;\nbut in the present instance, however gracious his mien and honeyed his\nexpressions, he only looked upon the cardinal as a dangerous rival,\nintent upon clutching from his fold the most precious of his flock, and\nhe had long looked to this occasion as the one which might decide\nthe spiritual welfare and career of Lothair. The odds were not to be\ndespised. There were two monsignores in the room besides the cardinal,\nbut the bishop was a man of contrivance and resolution, not easily\ndisheartened or defeated. Nor was he without allies. He did not count\nmuch on the university don, who was to arrive on the morrow in the shape\nof the head of an Oxford house, though he was a don of magnitude. This\neminent personage had already let Lothair slip from his influence. But\nthe bishop had a subtle counsellor in his chaplain, who wore as good\na cassock as any monsignore, and he brought with him also a trusty\narchdeacon in a purple coat, whose countenance was quite entitled to a\nplace in the Acta Sanctorum.\n\nIt was amusing to observe the elaborate courtesy and more than Christian\nkindness which the rival prelates and their official followers extended\nto each other. But under all this unction on both sides were unceasing\nobservation, and a vigilance that never flagged; and on both sides there\nwas an uneasy but irresistible conviction that they were on the eve of\none of the decisive battles of the social world. Lord Culloden also at\nlength appeared with his daughters, Ladies Flora and Grizell. They were\nquite as tall as Mr. Putney Giles had reported, but very pretty, with\nradiant complexions, sunny blue eyes, and flaxen looks. Their dimples\nand white shoulders and small feet and hands were much admired. Mr.\nGiles also returned with Apollonia, and, at length, also appeared the\nrival of Lord Carisbrooke, his grace of Brecon.\n\nLothair had passed a happy morning, for he had contrived, without\ndifficulty, to be the companion of Theodora during the greater part of\nit. As the duchess and Lady Corisande had already inspected the castle,\nthey disappeared after breakfast to write letters; and, when the\nafter-luncheon expedition took place, Lothair allotted them to the care\nof Lord Carisbrooke, and himself became the companion of Lady St. Jerome\nand Theodora.\n\nNotwithstanding all his efforts in the smoking-room, St. Aldegonde had\nonly been able to induce Colonel Campian to be his companion in the\nshooting expedition, and the colonel fell into the lure only through\nhis carelessness and good-nature. He much doubted the discretion of\nhis decision as he listened to Lord St. Aldegonde's reasons for the\nexpedition, in their rapid journey to the moors.\n\n\"I do not suppose,\" he said, \"we shall have any good sport; but when\nyou are in Scotland, and come to me, as I hope you will, I will give you\nsomething you will like. But it is a great thing to get off seeing the\nTowers, and the gardens, and all that sort of thing. Nothing bores me so\nmuch as going over a man's house. Besides, we get rid of the women.\"\n\nThe meeting between the two guardians did not promise to be as pleasant\nas that between the bishop and the cardinal, but the crusty Lord\nCulloden was scarcely a match for the social dexterity of his eminence.\nThe cardinal, crossing the room, with winning ceremony approached and\naddressed his colleague.\n\n\"We can have no more controversies, my lord, for our reign is over;\"\nand he extended a delicate hand, which the surprised peer touched with a\nhuge finger.\n\n\"Yes; it all depends on himself now,\" replied Lord Culloden, with a grim\nsmile; \"and I hope he will not make a fool of himself.\"\n\n\"What have you got for us to-night?\" inquired Lothair of Mr. Giles, as\nthe gentlemen rose from the dining-table.\n\nMr. Giles said he would consult his wife, but Lothair observing he would\nhimself undertake that office, when he entered the saloon, addressed\nApollonia. Nothing could be more skilful than the manner in which Mrs.\nGiles, in this party, assumed precisely the position which equally\nbecame her and suited her own views; at the same time the somewhat\nhumble friend, but the trusted counsellor, of the Towers, she disarmed\nenvy and conciliated consideration. Never obtrusive, yet always prompt\nand prepared with unfailing resource, and gifted apparently, with\nuniversal talents, she soon became the recognized medium by which every\nthing was suggested or arranged; and before eight-and-forty hours had\npassed she was described by duchesses and their daughters as that \"dear\nMrs. Giles.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Raphael and his sister came down in the train with us,\" said\nMrs. Giles to Lothair; \"the rest of the troupe will not be here until\nto-morrow; but they told me they could give you a perfect proverbe if\nyour lordship would like it; and the Spanish conjuror is here; but I\nrather think, from what I gather, that the young ladies would like a\ndance.\"\n\n\"I do not much fancy acting the moment these great churchmen have\narrived, and with cardinals and bishops I would rather not have dances\nthe first-night. I almost wish we had kept the Hungarian lady for this\nevening.\"\n\n\"Shall I send for her? She is ready.\"\n\n\"The repetition would be too soon, and would show a great poverty of\nresources,\" said Lothair, smiling; \"what we want is some singing.\"\n\n\"Mardoni ought to have been here to-day,\" said Mrs. Giles; \"but he never\nkeeps his engagements.\"\n\n\"I think our amateur materials are rather rich,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"There is Mrs. Campian,\" said Apollonia in a low voice; but Lothair\nshook his head.\n\n\"But, perhaps, if others set her the example,\" he added, after a pause;\n\"Lady Corisande is first rate, and all her sisters sing; I will go and\nconsult the duchess.\"\n\nThere was soon a stir in the room. Lady St. Aldegonde and her sisters\napproached the piano, at which was seated the eminent professor. A note\nwas heard, and there was silence. The execution was exquisite; and,\nindeed, there are few things more dainty than the blended voices of\nthree women. No one seemed to appreciate the performance more than\nMrs. Campian, who, greatly attracted by what was taking place, turned a\ncareless ear, even to the honeyed sentences of no less a personage than\nthe lord-bishop.\n\nAfter an interval Lady Corisande was handed to the piano by Lothair.\nShe was in fine voice, and sang with wonderful effect. Mrs. Campian, who\nseemed much interested, softly rose, and stole to the outward circle of\nthe group which had gathered round the instrument. When the sounds had\nceased, amid the general applause her voice of admiration was heard.\nThe duchess approached her, evidently prompted by the general wish, and\nexpressed her hope that Mrs. Campian would now favor them. It was not\nbecoming to refuse when others had contributed so freely to the\ngeneral entertainment, but Theodora was anxious not to place herself in\ncompetition with those who had preceded her. Looking over a volume\nof music, she suggested to Lady Corisande a duet, in which the\npeculiarities of their two voices, which in character were quite\ndifferent, one being a soprano and the other a contralto, might be\ndisplayed. And very seldom, in a private chamber, had any thing of so\nhigh a class been heard. Not a lip moved except those of the singers,\nso complete was the fascination, till the conclusion elicited a burst of\nirresistible applause.\n\n\"In imagination I am throwing endless bouquets,\" said Hugo Bohun.\n\n\"I wish we could induce her to give us a recitation from Alfieri,\" said\nMrs. Putney Giles in a whisper to Lady St. Aldegonde. \"I heard it once:\nit was the finest thing I ever listened to.\"\n\n\"But cannot we?\" said Lady St. Aldegonde.\n\nApollonia shook her head. \"She is extremely reserved. I am quite\nsurprised that she sang; but she could not well refuse after your\nladyship and your sisters had been so kind.\"\n\n\"But if the Lord of the Towers asks her,\" suggested Lady St. Aldegonde.\n\n\"No, no,\" said Mrs. Giles, \"that would not do; nor would he. He knows\nshe dislikes it. A word from Colonel Campian, and the thing would be\nsettled; but it is rather absurd to invoke the authority of a husband\nfor so light a matter.\"\n\n\"I should like so much to hear her,\" said Lady St. Aldegonde. \"I think I\nwill ask her myself. I will go and speak to mamma.\"\n\nThere was much whispering and consulting in the room, but unnoticed, as\ngeneral conversation had now been resumed. The duchess sent for Lothair,\nand conferred with him; but Lothair seemed to shake his head. Then\nher grace rose and approached Colonel Campian, who was talking to Lord\nCulloden, and then the duchess and Lady St. Aldegonde went to Mrs.\nCampian. Then, after a short time, Lady St. Aldegonde rose and fetched\nLothair.\n\n\"Her grace tells me,\" said Theodora, \"that Colonel Campian wishes me to\ngive a recitation. I cannot believe that such a performance can ever be\ngenerally interesting, especially in a foreign language, and I confess\nthat I would rather not exhibit. But I do not like to be churlish when\nall are so amiable and compliant, and her grace tells me that it cannot\nwell be postponed, for this is the last quiet night we shall have. What\nI want is a screen, and I must be a moment alone, before I venture on\nthese enterprises. I require it to create the ideal presence.\"\n\nLothair and Bertram arranged the screen, the duchess and Lady St.\nAldegonde glided about, and tranquilly intimated what was going to\noccur, so that, without effort, there was in a moment complete silence\nand general expectation. Almost unnoticed Mrs. Campian had disappeared,\nwhispering a word as she passed to the eminent conductor, who was\nstill seated at the piano. The company had almost unconsciously grouped\nthemselves in the form of a theatre, the gentlemen generally standing\nbehind the ladies who were seated. There were some bars of solemn music,\nand then, to an audience not less nervous than herself, Theodora came\nforward as Electra in that beautiful appeal to Clytemnestra, where she\nveils her mother's guilt even while she intimates her more than terrible\nsuspicion of its existence, and makes one last desperate appeal of\npathetic duty in order to save her parent and her fated house:\n\n     \"O amata madre,\n      Che fai?  Non credo io, no, che ardente fiamma\n      Il cor ti avvampi.\"\n\nThe ineffable grace of her action, simple without redundancy, her\nexquisite elocution, her deep yet controlled passion, and the magic of a\nvoice thrilling even in a whisper--this form of Phidias with the genius\nof Sophocles--entirely enraptured a fastidious audience. When she\nceased, there was an outburst of profound and unaffected appreciation;\nand Lord St. Aldegonde, who had listened in a sort of ecstasy, rushed\nforward, with a countenance as serious as the theme, to offer his thanks\nand express his admiration.\n\nAnd then they gathered round her--all these charming women and some of\nthese admiring men--as she would have resumed her seat, and entreated\nher once more--only once more--to favor them. She caught the adoring\nglance of the lord of the Towers, and her eyes seemed to inquire what\nshe should do. \"There will be many strangers here to-morrow,\" said\nLothair, \"and next week all the world. This is a delight only for the\ninitiated,\" and he entreated her to gratify them.\n\n\"It shall be Alfieri's ode to America, then,\" said Theodora, \"if you\nplease.\"\n\n\"She is a Roman, I believe,\" said Lady St. Jerome to his eminence, \"but\nnot, alas! a child of the Church. Indeed, I fear her views generally are\nadvanced,\" and she shook her head.\n\n\"At present,\" said the cardinal, \"this roof and this visit may influence\nher. I should like to see such powers engaged in the cause of God.\"\n\nThe cardinal was an entire believer in female influence, and a\nconsiderable believer in his influence over females; and he had good\ncause for his convictions. The catalogue of his proselytes was numerous\nand distinguished. He had not only converted a duchess and several\ncountesses, but he had gathered into his fold a real Mary Magdalen. In\nthe height of her beauty and her fame, the most distinguished member\nof the demi-monde had suddenly thrown up her golden whip and jingling\nreins, and cast herself at the feet of the cardinal. He had a right,\ntherefore, to be confident; and, while his exquisite taste and\nconsummate cultivation rendered it impossible that he should not have\nbeen deeply gratified by the performance of Theodora, he was really the\nwhole time considering the best means by which such charms and powers\ncould be enlisted in the cause of the Church.\n\nAfter the ladies had retired, the gentlemen talked for a few minutes\nover the interesting occurrence of the evening.\n\n\"Do you know,\" said the bishop to the duke and some surrounding\nauditors, \"fine as was the Electra, I preferred the ode to the tragedy?\nThere was a tumult of her brow, especially in the address to Liberty,\nthat was sublime--quite a Moenad look.\"\n\n\"What do you think of it, Carry?\" said St. Aldegonde to Lord\nCarisbrooke.\n\n\"Brecon says she puts him in mind of Ristori.\"\n\n\"She is not in the least like Ristori, or any one else,\" said St.\nAldegonde. \"I never heard, I never saw any one like her. I'll tell you\nwhat--you must take care what you say about her in the smoking-room, for\nher husband will be there, and an excellent fellow too. We went together\nto the moors this morning, and he did not bore me in the least. Only, if\nI had known as much about his wife as I do now, I would have stayed at\nhome, and passed my morning with the women.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 43\n\n\nSt. Aldegonde loved to preside over the mysteries of the smoking-room.\nThere, enveloped in his Egyptian robe, occasionally blurting out some\ncareless or headstrong paradox to provoke discussion among others, which\nwould amuse himself, rioting in a Rabelaisan anecdote, and listening\nwith critical delight to endless memoirs of horses and prima-donnas, St.\nAldegonde was never bored. Sometimes, too, when he could get hold of\nan eminent traveller, or some individual distinguished for special\nknowledge, St. Aldegonde would draw him out with skill; himself\ndisplaying an acquaintance with the particular topic which often\nsurprised his habitual companions, for St. Aldegonde professed never to\nread; but he had no ordinary abilities, and an original turn of mind\nand habit of life, which threw him in the way of unusual persons of\nall classes; from whom he imbibed or extracted a vast variety of queer,\nalways amusing, and not altogether useless information.\n\n\"Lothair has only one weakness,\" he said to Colonel Campian as the\nladies disappeared; \"he does not smoke. Carry, you will come?\"\n\n\"Well, I do not think I shall to-night,\" said Lord Carisbrooke. Lady\nCorisande, it appears, particularly disapproved of smoking.\n\n\"Hum!\" said St. Aldegonde; \"Duke of Brecon, I know, will come, and Hugo\nand Bertram. My brother Montairy would give his ears to come, but is\nafraid of his wife; and then there is the monsignore, a most capital\nfellow, who knows every thing.\"\n\nThere were other gatherings, before the midnight bell struck at the\nTowers, which discussed important affairs, though they might not sit\nso late as the smoking-party. Lady St. Aldegonde had a reception in her\nroom as well as her lord. There the silent observation of the evening\nfound avenging expression in sparkling criticism, and the summer\nlightning, though it generally blazed with harmless brilliancy,\noccasionally assumed a more arrowy character. The gentlemen of the\nsmoking-room have it not all their own way quite as much as they think.\nIf, indeed, a new school of Athens were to be pictured, the sages and\nthe students might be represented in exquisite dressing-gowns, with\nslippers rarer than the lost one of Cinderella, and brandishing\nbeautiful brushes over tresses still more fair. Then is the time when\ncharacters are never more finely drawn, or difficult social questions\nmore accurately solved; knowledge without reasoning and truth without\nlogic--the triumph of intuition! But we must not profane the mysteries\nof Bona Dea.\n\nThe archdeacon and the chaplain had also been in council with the bishop\nin his dressing-room, who, while he dismissed them with his benison,\nrepeated his apparently satisfactory assurance that something would\nhappen \"the first thing after breakfast.\"\n\nLothair did not smoke, but he did not sleep. He was absorbed by the\nthought of Theodora. He could not but be conscious, and so far he was\npleased by the consciousness, that she was as fascinating to others as\nto himself. What then? Even with the splendid novelty of his majestic\nhome, and all the excitement of such an incident in his life, and\nthe immediate prospect of their again meeting, he had felt, and even\nacutely, their separation. Whether it were the admiration of her by\nothers which proved his own just appreciation, or whether it were the\nunobtrusive display of exquisite accomplishments, which, with all their\nintimacy, she had never forced on his notice--whatever the cause,\nher hold upon his heart and life, powerful as it was before, had\nstrengthened. Lothair could not conceive existence tolerable without\nher constant presence; and with her constant presence existence would\nbe rapture. It had come to that. All his musings, all his profound\ninvestigation and high resolve, all his sublime speculations on God and\nman, and life, and immortality, and the origin of things, and religious\ntruth, ended in an engrossing state of feeling, which could be denoted\nin that form and in no other.\n\nWhat, then, was his future? It seemed dark and distressing. Her constant\npresence his only happiness; her constant presence impossible. He seemed\non an abyss.\n\nIn eight-and-forty hours or so one of the chief provinces of England\nwould be blazing with the celebration of his legal accession to his high\nestate. If any one in the queen's dominions had to be fixed upon as the\nmost fortunate and happiest of her subjects, it might well be Lothair.\nIf happiness depend on lofty station, his ancient and hereditary rank\nwas of the highest; if, as there seems no doubt, the chief source of\nfelicity in this country is wealth, his vast possessions and accumulated\ntreasure could not easily be rivalled, while he had a matchless\nadvantage over those who pass, or waste, their gray and withered lives\nin acquiring millions, in his consummate and healthy youth. He had\nbright abilities, and a brighter heart. And yet the unknown truth was,\nthat this favored being, on the eve of this critical event, was pacing\nhis chamber agitated and infinitely disquieted, and struggling with\ncircumstances and feelings over which alike he seemed to have no\ncontrol, and which seemed to have been evoked without the exercise of\nhis own will, or that of any other person.\n\n\"I do not think I can blame myself,\" he said; \"and I am sure I cannot\nblame her. And yet--\"\n\nHe opened his window and looked upon the moonlit garden, which filled\nthe fanciful quadrangle. The light of the fountain seemed to fascinate\nhis eye, and the music of its fall soothed him into reverie. The\ndistressful images that had gathered round his heart gradually vanished,\nand all that remained to him was the reality of his happiness. Her\nbeauty and her grace, the sweet stillness of her searching intellect,\nand the refined pathos of her disposition, only occurred to him, and he\ndwelt on them with spell-bound joy.\n\nThe great clock of the Towers sounded two.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Lothair, \"I must try to sleep. I have got to see the bishop\nto-morrow morning. I wonder what he wants?\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 44\n\n\nThe bishop was particularly playful on the morrow at breakfast. Though\nhis face beamed with Christian kindness, there was a twinkle in his eye\nwhich seemed not entirely superior to mundane self-complacency, even to\na sense of earthly merriment. His seraphic raillery elicited sympathetic\napplause from the ladies, especially from the daughters of the house of\nBrentham, who laughed occasionally, even before his angelic jokes\nwere well launched. His lambent flashes sometimes even played over the\ncardinal, whose cerulean armor, nevertheless, remained always unscathed.\nMonsignore Chidioch, however, who would once unnecessarily rush to the\naid of his chief, was tumbled over by the bishop with relentless gayety,\nto the infinite delight of Lady Corisande, who only wished it had\nbeen that dreadful Monsignore Catesby. But, though less demonstrative,\napparently not the least devout, of his lordship's votaries, were\nthe Lady Flora and the Lady Grizell. These young gentlewomen, though\napparently gifted with appetites becoming their ample, but far from\ngraceless, forms, contrived to satisfy all the wants of nature without\ntaking their charmed vision for a moment off the prelate, or losing a\nword which escaped his consecrated lips. Sometimes even they ventured to\nsmile, and then they looked at their father and sighed. It was evident,\nnotwithstanding their appetites and their splendid complexions, which\nwould have become the Aurora of Guido, that these young ladies had some\nsecret sorrow which required a confidante. Their visit to Muriel Towers\nwas their introduction to society, for the eldest had only just attained\nsweet seventeen. Young ladies under these circumstances always fall in\nlove, but with their own sex. Lady Flora and Lady Grizell both fell in\nlove with Lady Corisande, and before the morning had passed away she\nhad become their friend and counsellor, and the object of their devoted\nadoration. It seems that their secret sorrow had its origin in that\nmysterious religious sentiment which agitates or affects every class\nand condition of man, and which creates or destroys states, though\nphilosophers are daily assuring us \"that there is nothing in it.\" The\ndaughters of the Earl of Culloden could not stand any longer the Free\nKirk, of which their austere parent was a fiery votary. It seems that\nthey had been secretly converted to the Episcopal Church of Scotland by\na governess, who pretended to be a daughter of the Covenant, but who was\nreally a niece of the primus, and, as Lord Culloden accurately observed,\nwhen he ignominiously dismissed her, \"a Jesuit in disguise.\" From that\nmoment there had been no peace in his house. His handsome and gigantic\ndaughters, who had hitherto been all meekness, and who had obeyed him as\nthey would a tyrant father of the feudal ages, were resolute, and would\nnot compromise their souls. They humbly expressed their desire to enter\na convent, or to become at least sisters of mercy. Lord Culloden raged\nand raved, and delivered himself of cynical taunts, but to no purpose.\nThe principle that forms Free Kirks is a strong principle, and takes\nmany forms, which the social Polyphemes, who have only one eye, cannot\nperceive. In his desperate confusion, he thought that change of scene\nmight be a diversion when things were at the worst, and this was the\nreason that he had, contrary to his original intention, accepted the\ninvitation of his ward.\n\nLady Corisande was exactly the guide the girls required. They sat on\neach side of her, each holding her hand, which they frequently pressed\nto their lips. As her form was slight, though of perfect grace and\nsymmetry, the contrast between herself and her worshippers was rather\nstartling; but her noble brow, full of thought and purpose, the firmness\nof her chiselled lip, and the rich fire of her glance vindicated her\npost as the leading spirit.\n\nThey breakfasted in a room which opened on a gallery, and at the other\nend of the gallery was an apartment similar to the breakfast-room,\nwhich was the male morning-room, and where the world could find\nthe newspapers, or join in half an hour's talk over the intended\narrangements of the day. When the breakfast-party broke up, the bishop\napproached Lothair, and looked at him earnestly.\n\n\"I am at your lordship's service,\" said Lothair, and they quitted the\nbreakfast-room together. Half-way down the gallery they met Monsignore\nCatesby, who had in his hand a number, just arrived, of a newspaper\nwhich was esteemed an Ultramontane organ. He bowed as he passed them,\nwith an air of some exultation, and the bishop and himself exchanged\nsignificant smiles, which, however, meant different things. Quitting the\ngallery, Lothair led the way to his private apartments; and, opening the\ndoor, ushered in the bishop.\n\nNow, what was contained in the Ultramontane organ which apparently\noccasioned so much satisfaction to Monsignore Catesby? A deftly drawn-up\nannouncement of some important arrangements which had been deeply\nplanned. The announcement would be repeated In all the daily papers,\nwhich were hourly expected. The world was informed that his eminence,\nCardinal Grandison, now on a visit at Muriel Towers to his ward,\nLothair, would celebrate high mass on the ensuing Sunday in the city\nwhich was the episcopal capital of the bishop's see, and afterward\npreach on the present state of the Church of Christ. As the bishop must\nbe absent from his cathedral that day, and had promised to preach in\nthe chapel at Muriel, there was something dexterous in thus turning his\nlordship's flank, and desolating his diocese when he was not present to\nguard it from the fiery dragon. It was also remarked that there would be\nan unusual gathering of the Catholic aristocracy for the occasion. The\nrate of lodgings in the city had risen in consequence. At the end of the\nparagraph it was distinctly contradicted that Lothair had entered the\nCatholic Church. Such a statement was declared to be \"premature,\" as\nhis guardian, the cardinal, would never sanction his taking such a step\nuntil he was the master of his own actions; the general impression left\nby the whole paragraph being, that the world was not to be astonished if\nthe first stop of Lothair, on accomplishing his majority, was to pursue\nthe very course which was now daintily described as premature.\n\nAt luncheon the whole party were again assembled. The newspapers had\narrived in the interval, and had been digested. Every one was aware of\nthe popish plot, as Hugo Bohun called it. The bishop, however, looked\nserene, and, if not as elate as in the morning, calm and content. He sat\nby the duchess, and spoke to her in a low voice, and with seriousness.\nThe monsignore watched every expression.\n\nWhen the duchess rose, the bishop accompanied her into the recess of a\nwindow, and she said: \"You may depend upon me; I cannot answer for the\nduke. It is not the early rising; he always rises early in the country,\nbut he likes to read his letters before he dresses, and that sort of\nthing. I think you had better speak to Lady Corisande yourself.\"\n\nWhat had taken place at the interview of the bishop with Lothair, and\nwhat had elicited from the duchess an assurance that the prelate\nmight depend upon her, generally transpired, in consequence of some\nconfidential communications, in the course of the afternoon. It appeared\nthat the right reverend lord had impressed, and successfully, on\nLothair, the paramount duty of commencing the day of his majority by\nassisting in an early celebration of the most sacred rite of the Church.\nThis, in the estimation of the bishop, though he had not directly\nalluded to the subject in the interview, but had urged the act on higher\ngrounds, would be a triumphant answer to the insidious and calumnious\nparagraphs which had circulated during the last six months, and an\nauthentic testimony that Lothair was not going to quit the Church of his\nfathers.\n\nThis announcement, however, produced consternation in the opposite\ncamp. It seemed to more than neutralize the anticipated effect of the\nprogramme, and the deftly-conceived paragraph. Monsignore Catesby went\nabout whispering that he feared Lothair was going to overdo it; and\nconsidering what he had to go through on Monday, if it were only for\nconsiderations of health, an early celebration was inexpedient. He tried\nthe duchess--about whom he was beginning to hover a good deal--as he\nfancied she was of an impressible disposition, and gave some promise of\nresults; but here the ground had been too forcibly preoccupied: then he\nflew to Lady St. Aldegonde, but he had the mortification of learning,\nfrom her lips, that she herself contemplated being a communicant at the\nsame time. Lady Corisande had been before him. All the energies of that\nyoung lady were put forth in order that Lothair should be countenanced\non this solemn occasion. She conveyed to the bishop before dinner the\nresults of her exertions.\n\n\"You may count on Alberta St. Aldegonde and Victoria Montairy, and, I\nthink, Lord Montairy also, if she presses him, which she has promised\nto do. Bertram must kneel by his friend at such a time. I think Lord\nCarisbrooke may: Duke of Brecon, I can say nothing about at present.\"\n\n\"Lord St. Aldegonde?\" said the bishop.\n\nLady Corisande shook her head.\n\nThere had been a conclave in the bishop's room before dinner, in which\nthe interview of the morning was discussed.\n\n\"It was successful; scarcely satisfactory,\" said the bishop. \"He is a\nvery clever fellow, and knows a great deal. They have got hold of him,\nand he has all the arguments at his fingers' ends. When I came to the\npoint, he began to demur; I saw what was passing through his mind, and\nI said at once: 'Your views are high: so are mine: so are those of the\nChurch. It is a sacrifice, undoubtedly, in a certain sense. No sound\ntheologian would maintain the simplicity of the elements; but that does\nnot involve the coarse interpretation of the dark ages.'\"\n\n\"Good, good,\" said the archdeacon; \"and what is it your lordship did not\nexactly like?\"\n\n\"He fenced too much; and he said more than once, and in a manner I did\nnot like, that, whatever were his views as to the Church, he thought he\ncould on the whole conscientiously partake of this rite as administered\nby the Church of England.\"\n\n\"Every thing depends on this celebration,\" said the chaplain; \"after\nthat his doubts and difficulties will dispel.\"\n\n\"We must do our best that he is well supported,\" said the archdeacon.\n\n\"No fear of that,\" said the bishop. \"I have spoken to some of our\nfriends. We may depend on the duchess and her daughters--all admirable\nwomen; and they will do what they can with others. It will be a busy\nday, but I have expressed my hope that the heads of the household may be\nable to attend. But the county notables arrive to-day, and I shall make\nit a point with them, especially the lord-lieutenant.\"\n\n\"It should be known,\" said the chaplain. \"I will send a memorandum to\nthe Guardian.\"\n\n\"And John Bull,\" said the bishop.\n\nThe lord-lieutenant and Lady Agramont, and their daughter, Lady Ida\nAlice, arrived to-day; and the high-sheriff, a manufacturer, a great\nliberal who delighted in peers, but whose otherwise perfect felicity\nto-day was a little marred and lessened by the haunting and restless\nfear that Lothair was not duly aware that he took precedence of the\nlord-lieutenant. Then there were Sir Hamlet Clotworthy, the master\nof the hounds, and a capital man of business; and the Honorable Lady\nClotworthy, a haughty dame who ruled her circle with tremendous airs and\ngraces, but who was a little subdued in the empyrean of Muriel Towers.\nThe other county member, Mr. Ardenne, was a refined gentleman, and loved\nthe arts. He had an ancient pedigree, and knew everybody else's, which\nwas not always pleasant. What he most prided himself on was being the\nhereditary owner of a real deer--park the only one, he asserted, in the\ncounty. Other persons had parks which had deer in them, but that was\nquite a different thing. His wife was a pretty woman, and the inspiring\ngenius of archeological societies, who loved their annual luncheon\nin her Tudor Halls, and illustrated by their researches the deeds and\ndwellings of her husband's ancient race.\n\nThe clergy of the various parishes on the estate all dined at the Towers\nto-day, in order to pay their respects to their bishop. \"Lothair's\noecumenical council,\" said Hugo Bohun, as he entered the crowded room,\nand looked around him with an air of not ungraceful impertinence. Among\nthe clergy was Mr. Smylie, the brother of Apollonia.\n\nA few years ago, Mr. Putney Giles had not unreasonably availed himself\nof the position which he so usefully and so honorably filled, to\nrecommend this gentleman to the guardians of Lothair to fill a vacant\nbenefice. The Reverend Dionysius Smylie had distinguished himself at\nTrinity College, Dublin, and had gained a Hebrew scholarship there;\nafter that he had written a work on the Revelations, which clearly\nsettled the long-controverted point whether Rome in the great apocalypse\nwas signified by Babylon. The bishop shrugged his shoulders when he\nreceived Mr. Smylie's papers, the examining chaplain sighed, and the\narchdeacon groaned. But man is proverbially short-sighted. The doctrine\nof evolution affords no instances so striking as those of sacerdotal\ndevelopment. Placed under the favoring conditions of clime and soil,\nthe real character of the Reverend Dionysius Smylie gradually, but\npowerfully, developed itself. Where he now ministered, he was attended\nby acolytes, and incensed by thurifers. The shoulders of a fellow\ncountryman were alone equal to the burden of the enormous cross which\npreceded him; while his ecclesiastical wardrobe furnished him with many\ncolored garments, suited to every season of the year, and every festival\nof the Church.\n\nAt first there was indignation, and rumors or prophecies that we should\nsoon have another case of perversion, and that Mr. Smylie was going over\nto Rome; but these superficial commentators misapprehended the vigorous\nvanity of the man. \"Rome may come to me,\" said Mr. Smylie, \"and it is\nperhaps the best thing it could do. This is the real Church without\nRomish error.\"\n\nThe bishop and his reverend stuff, who were at first so much annoyed\nat the preferment of Mr. Smylie, had now, with respect to him, only\none duty, and that was to restrain his exuberant priestliness; but they\nfulfilled that duty in a kindly and charitable spirit; and, when the\nReverend Dionysius Smylie was appointed chaplain to Lothair, the\nbishop did not shrug his shoulders, the chaplain did not sigh, nor the\narchdeacon groan.\n\nThe party was so considerable to-day that they dined in the great hall.\nWhen it was announced to Lothair that his lordship's dinner was served,\nand he offered his arm to his destined companion, he looked around,\nand, then in an audible voice, and with a stateliness becoming such an\nincident, called upon the high-sheriff to lead the duchess to the table.\nAlthough that eminent personage had been thinking of nothing else for\ndays, and during the last half-hour had felt as a man feels, and can\nonly feel, who knows that some public function is momentarily about to\nfall to his perilous discharge, he was taken quite aback, changed color,\nand lost his head. But the band of Lothair, who were waiting at the door\nof the apartment to precede the procession to the hall, striking up at\nthis moment \"The Roast Beef of Old England,\" reanimated his heart; and,\nfollowing Lothair, and preceding all the other guests down the gallery,\nand through many chambers, he experienced the proudest moment of a life\nof struggle, ingenuity, vicissitude, and success.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 45\n\n\nUnder all this flowing festivity there was already a current of struggle\nand party passion. Serious thoughts and some anxiety occupied the minds\nof several of the guests, amid the variety of proffered dishes and\nsparkling wines, and the subdued strains of delicate music. This\ndisquietude did not touch Lothair. He was happy to find himself in his\nancestral hall, surrounded by many whom he respected, and by some whom\nhe loved. He was an excellent host, which no one can be who does not\ncombine a good heart with high breeding.\n\nTheodora was rather far from him, but he could catch her grave, sweet\ncountenance at an angle of the table, as she bowed her head to Mr.\nArdenne, the county member, who was evidently initiating her in all the\nmysteries of deer-parks. The cardinal sat near him, winning over, though\nwithout apparent effort, the somewhat prejudiced Lady Agramont. His\neminence could converse with more facility than others, for he dined off\nbiscuits and drank only water.\n\nLord Culloden had taken out Lady St. Jerome, who expended on him all the\nresources of her impassioned tittle-tattle, extracting only grim smiles;\nand Lady Corisande had fallen to the happy lot of the Duke of Brecon;\naccording to the fine perception of Clare Arundel--and women are very\nquick in these discoveries--the winning horse. St. Aldegonde had managed\nto tumble in between Lady Flora and Lady Grizell, and seemed immensely\namused.\n\nThe duke inquired of Lothair how many he could dine in his hall.\n\n\"We must dine more than two hundred on Monday,\" he replied.\n\n\"And now, I should think, we have only a third of that number,\" said his\ngrace. \"It will be a tight fit.\"\n\n\"Mr. Putney Giles has had a drawing made, and every seat apportioned. We\nshall just do it.\"\n\n\"I fear you will have too busy a day on Monday,\" said the cardinal, who\nhad caught up the conversation.\n\n\"Well, you know, sir, I do not sit up smoking with Lord St. Aldegonde.\"\n\nAfter dinner, Lady Corisande seated herself by Mrs. Campian. \"You must\nhave thought me very rude,\" she said, \"to have left you so suddenly at\ntea, when the bishop looked into the room; but he wanted me on a matter\nof the greatest importance. I must, therefore, ask your pardon. You\nnaturally would not feel on this matter as we all do, or most of us do,\"\nshe added with some hesitation; \"being--pardon me--a foreigner, and the\nquestion involving national as well as religious feelings;\" and then,\nsomewhat hurriedly, but with emotion, she detailed to Theodora all\nthat had occurred respecting the early celebration on Monday, and the\nopposition it was receiving from the cardinal and his friends. It was a\nrelief to Lady Corisande thus to express all her feelings on a subject\non which she had been brooding the whole day.\n\n\"You mistake,\" said Theodora, quietly, when Lady Corisande had finished.\n\"I am much interested in what you tell me. I should deplore our friend\nfalling under the influence of the Romish priesthood.\"\n\n\"And yet there is danger of it,\" said Lady Corisande, \"more than\ndanger,\" she added in a low but earnest voice. \"You do not know what a\nconspiracy is going on, and has been going on for months, to effect this\nend. I tremble.\"\n\n\"That is the last thing I ever do,\" said Theodora, with a faint, sweet\nsmile. \"I hope, but I never tremble.\"\n\n\"You have seen the announcement in the newspapers to-day!\" said Lady\nCorisande.\n\n\"I think, if they were certain of their prey, they would be more\nreserved,\" said Theodora.\n\n\"There is something in that,\" said Lady Corisande, musingly. \"You know\nnot what a relief it is to me to speak to you on this matter. Mamma\nagrees with me, and so do my sisters; but still they may agree with me\nbecause they are my mamma and my sisters; but I look upon our nobility\njoining the Church of Rome as the greatest calamity that has ever\nhappened to England. Irrespective of all religious considerations, on\nwhich I will not presume to touch, it is an abnegation of patriotism;\nand in this age, when all things are questioned, a love of our country\nseems to me the one sentiment to cling to.\"\n\n\"I know no higher sentiment,\" said Theodora in a low voice, and yet\nwhich sounded like the breathing of some divine shrine, and her Athenian\neye met the fiery glance of Lady Corisande with an expression of noble\nsympathy.\n\n\"I am so glad that I spoke to you on this matter,\" said Lady Corisande,\n\"for there is something in you which encourages me. As you say, if they\nwere certain, they would be silent; and yet, from what I hear, their\nhopes are high. You know,\" she added in a whisper, \"that he has\nabsolutely engaged to raise a popish cathedral. My brother, Bertram, has\nseen the model in his rooms.\"\n\n\"I have known models that were never realized,\" said Theodora.\n\n\"Ah! you are hopeful; you said you were hopeful. It is a beautiful\ndisposition. It is not mine,\" she added, with a sigh.\n\n\"It should be,\" said Theodora; \"you were not born to sigh. Sighs should\nbe for those who have no country, like myself; not for the daughters of\nEngland--the beautiful daughters of proud England.\"\n\n\"But you have your husband's country, and that is proud and great.\"\n\n\"I have only one country, and it is not my husband's; and I have only\none thought, and it is to set it free.\"\n\n\"It is a noble one,\" said Lady Corisande, \"as I am sure are all your\nthoughts. There are the gentlemen; I am sorry they have come. There,\"\nshe added, as Monsignore Catesby entered the room, \"there is his evil\ngenius.\"\n\n\"But you have baffled him,\" said Theodora.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Lady Corisande, with a long-drawn sigh. \"Their manoeuvres\nnever cease. However, I think Monday must be safe. Would you come?\" she\nsaid, with a serious, searching glance, and in a kind of coaxing murmur.\n\n\"I should be an intruder, my dear lady,\" said Theodora, declining the\nsuggestion; \"but, so far as hoping that our friend will never join the\nChurch of Rome, you will have ever my ardent wishes.\"\n\nTheodora might have added her belief, for Lothair had never concealed\nfrom her a single thought or act of his life in this respect. She\nknew all and had weighed every thing, and flattered herself that their\nfrequent and unreserved conversations had not confirmed his belief\nin the infallibility of the Church of Rome, and perhaps of some other\nthings.\n\nIt had been settled that there should be dancing this evening--all the\nyoung ladies had wished it. Lothair danced with Lady Flora Falkirk, and\nher sister, Lady Grizell, was in the same quadrille. They moved about\nlike young giraffes in an African forest, but looked bright and happy.\nLothair liked his cousins; their inexperience and innocence, and the\nsimplicity with which they exhibited and expressed their feelings, had\nin them something bewitching. Then the rough remembrance of his old life\nat Falkirk and its contrast with the present scene had in it something\nstimulating. They were his juniors by several years, but they were\nalways gentle and kind to him; and sometimes it seemed he was the only\nperson whom they, too, had found kind and gentle. He called his\ncousin, too, by her Christian name, and he was amused, standing by this\nbeautiful giantess, and calling her Flora. There were other amusing\ncircumstances in the quadrille; not the least, Lord St. Aldegonde\ndancing with Mrs. Campian. The wonder of Lady St. Aldegonde was only\nequalled by her delight.\n\nThe lord-lieutenant was standing by the duke, in a comer of the saloon,\nobserving, not with dissatisfaction, his daughter, Lady Ida Alice,\ndancing with Lothair.\n\n\"Do you know this is the first time I ever had the honor of meeting a\ncardinal?\" he said.\n\n\"And we never expected that it would happen to either of us in this\ncountry when we were at Christchurch together,\" replied the duke.\n\n\"Well, I hope every thing is for the best,\" said Lord Agramont. \"We\nare to have all these gentlemen in our good city of Grandchester,\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"So I understand.\"\n\n\"You read that paragraph in the newspapers? Do you think there is any\nthing in it?\"\n\n\"About our friend? It would be a great misfortune.\"\n\n\"The bishop says there is nothing in it,\" said the lord-lieutenant.\n\n\"Well, he ought to know. I understand he has had some serious\nconversation recently with our friend?\"\n\n\"Yes; he has spoken to me about it. Are you going to attend the early\ncelebration tomorrow? It is not much to my taste; a little new-fangled,\nI think; but I shall go, as they say it will do good.\"\n\n\"I am glad of that; it is well that he should be impressed at this\nmoment with the importance and opinion of his county.\"\n\n\"Do you know I never saw him before?\" said the lord-lieutenant. \"He is\nwinning.\"\n\n\"I know no youth,\" said the duke, \"I would not except my own son, and\nBertram has never given me an uneasy moment, of whom I have a better\nopinion, both as to heart and head. I should deeply deplore his being\nsmashed by a Jesuit.\"\n\nThe dancing had ceased for a moment; there was a stir; Lord Carisbrooke\nwas enlarging, with unusual animation, to an interested group, about\na new dance at Paris--the new dance. Could they not have it here?\nUnfortunately, he did not know its name, and could not describe its\nfigure; but it was something new; quite new; they got it at Paris.\nPrincess Metternich dances it. He danced it with her, and she taught it\nhim; only he never could explain any thing, and indeed never did exactly\nmake it out. \"But you danced it with a shawl, and then two ladies hold\nthe shawl, and the cavaliers pass under it. In fact, it is the only\nthing; it is the new dance at Paris.\"\n\nWhat a pity that any thing so delightful should be so indefinite\nand perplexing, and indeed impossible, which rendered it still more\ndesirable! If Lord Carisbrooke only could have remembered its name, or a\nsingle step in its figure--it was so tantalizing!\n\n\"Do not you think so?\" said Hugo Bohun to Mrs. Campian, who was sitting\napart, listening to Lord St. Aldegonde's account of his travels in the\nUnited States, which he was very sorry he ever quitted. And then they\ninquired to what Mr. Bohun referred, and then he told them all that had\nbeen said.\n\n\"I know what he means,\" said Mrs. Campian. \"It is not a French dance; it\nis a Moorish dance.\"\n\n\"That woman knows everything, Hugo,\" said Lord St. Aldegonde in a solemn\nwhisper. And then he called to his wife. \"Bertha, Mrs. Campian will tell\nyou all about this dance that Carisbrooke is making such a mull of. Now,\nlook here, Bertha; you must get the Campians to come to us as soon as\npossible. They are going to Scotland from this place, and there is no\nreason, if you manage it well, why they should not come on to us at\nonce. Now, exert yourself.\"\n\n\"I will do all I can, Granville.\"\n\n\"It is not French, it is Moorish; it is called the Tangerine,\" said\nTheodora to her surrounding votaries. \"You begin with a circle.\"\n\n\"But how are we to dance without the music?\" said Lady Montairy.\n\n\"Ah! I wish I had known this,\" said Theodora, \"before dinner, and I\nthink I could have dotted down something that would have helped us. But\nlet me see,\" and she went up to the eminent professor, with whom she was\nwell acquainted, and said, \"Signor Ricci, it begins so,\" and she\nhummed divinely a fantastic air, which, after a few moments' musing,\nhe reproduced; \"and then it goes off into what they call in Spain a\nsaraband. Is there a shawl in the room?\"\n\n\"My mother has always a shawl in reserve,\" said Bertram, \"particularly\nwhen she pays visits to houses where there are galleries;\" and he\nbrought back a mantle of Cashmere.\n\n\"Now, Signor Ricci,\" said Mrs. Campian, and she again hummed an air, and\nmoved forward at the same time with brilliant grace, waving at the end\nthe shawl.\n\nThe expression of her countenance, looking round to Signor Ricci, as she\nwas moving on to see whether he had caught her idea, fascinated Lothair.\n\n\"It is exactly what I told you,\" said Lord Carisbrooke, \"and, I can\nassure you, it is the only dance now. I am very glad I remembered it.\"\n\n\"I see it all,\" said Signor Ricci, as Theodora rapidly detailed to him\nthe rest of the figure. \"And at any rate it will be the Tangerine with\nvariations.\"\n\n\"Let me have the honor of being your partner in this great enterprise,\"\nsaid Lothair; \"you are the inspiration of Muriel.\"\n\n\"Oh! I am very glad I can do any thing, however slight, to please you\nand your friends. I like them all; but particularly Lady Corisande.\"\n\nA new dance in a country-house is a festival of frolic grace. The\nincomplete knowledge, and the imperfect execution, are themselves causes\nof merry excitement, in their contrast with the unimpassioned routine\nand almost unconscious practice of traditionary performances. And gay\nand frequent were the bursts of laughter from the bright and airy band\nwho were proud to be the scholars of Theodora. The least successful\namong them was perhaps Lord Carisbrooke.\n\n\"Princess Metternich must have taught you wrong, Carisbrooke,\" said Hugo\nBohun.\n\nThey ended with a waltz, Lothair dancing with Miss Arundel. She accepted\nhis offer to take some tea on its conclusion. While they were standing\nat the table, a little withdrawn from the others, and he holding a\nsugar-basin, she said in a low voice, looking on her cup and not at him,\n\"the cardinal is vexed about the early celebration; he says it should\nhave been at midnight.\"\n\n\"I am sorry he is vexed,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"He was going to speak to you himself,\" continued Miss Arundel; \"but\nhe felt a delicacy about it. He had thought that your common feelings\nrespecting the Church might have induced you if not to consult, at least\nto converse, with him on the subject; I mean as your guardian.\"\n\n\"It might have been perhaps as well,\" said Lothair; \"but I also feel a\ndelicacy on these matters.\"\n\n\"There ought to be none on such matters,\" continued Miss Arundel, \"when\nevery thing is at stake.\"\n\n\"I do not see that I could have taken any other course than I have\ndone,\" said.Lothair. \"It can hardly be wrong. The bishop's church views\nare sound.\"\n\n\"Sound!\" said Miss Arundel; \"moonshine instead of sunshine.\"\n\n\"Moonshine would rather suit a midnight than a morning celebration,\"\nsaid Lothair; \"would it not?\"\n\n\"A fair repartee, but we are dealing with a question that cannot be\nsettled by jests. See,\" she said with great seriousness, putting down\nher cup and taking again his offered arm, \"you think you are only\ncomplying with a form befitting your position and the occasion. You\ndeceive yourself. You are hampering your future freedom by this step,\nand they know it. That is why it was planned. It was not necessary;\nnothing can be necessary so pregnant with evil. You might have made, you\nmight yet make, a thousand excuses. It is a rite which hardly suits the\nlevity of the hour, even with their feelings; but, with your view of\nits real character, it is sacrilege. What at is occurring tonight might\nfurnish you with scruples?\" And she looked up in his face.\n\n\"I think you take an exaggerated view of what I contemplate,\" said\nLothair. \"Even with your convictions, it may be an imperfect rite; but\nit never can be an injurious one.\"\n\n\"There can be no compromise on such matters,\" said Miss Arundel. \"The\nChurch knows nothing of imperfect rites. They are all perfect, because\nthey are all divine; any deviation from them is heresy, and fatal. My\nconvictions on this subject are your convictions; act up to them.\"\n\n\"I am sure, if thinking of these matters would guide a man right--\" said\nLothair, with a sigh, and he stopped.\n\n\"Human thought will never guide you; and very justly, when you have for\na guide Divine truth. You are now your own master; go at once to its\nfountain-head; go to Rome, and then all your perplexities will vanish,\nand forever.\"\n\n\"I do not see much prospect of my going to Rome,\" said Lothair, \"at\nleast at present.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Miss Arundel, \"in a few weeks I hope to be there; and if\nso, I hope never to quit it.\"\n\n\"Do not say that; the future is always unknown.\"\n\n\"Not yours,\" said Miss Arundel. \"Whatever you think, you will go to\nRome. Mark my words. I summon you to meet me at Rome.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 46\n\n\nThere can be little doubt, generally speaking, that it is more\nsatisfactory to pass Sunday in the country than in town. There is\nsomething in the essential stillness of country-life, which blends\nharmoniously with the ordinance of the most divine of our divine laws.\nIt is pleasant, too, when the congregation breaks up, to greet one's\nneighbors; to say kind words to kind faces; to hear some rural news\nprofitable to learn, which sometimes enables you to do some good, and\nsometimes prevents others from doing some harm. A quiet, domestic walk,\ntoo, in the afternoon, has its pleasures; and so numerous and so various\nare the sources of interest in the country, that, though it be Sunday,\nthere is no reason why your walk should not have an object.\n\nBut Sunday in the country, with your house full of visitors, is too\noften an exception to this general truth. It is a trial. Your guests\ncannot always be at church, and, if they could, would not like it. There\nis nothing to interest or amuse them; no sport; no castles or factories\nto visit; no adventurous expeditions; no gay music in the morn, and no\nlight dance in the evening. There is always danger of the day becoming\na course of heavy meals and stupid walks, for the external scene and all\nteeming circumstances, natural and human, though full of concern to you,\nare to your visitors an insipid blank.\n\nHow did Sunday go off at Muriel Towers?\n\nIn the first place, there was a special train, which, at an early\nhour, took the cardinal and his suite and the St. Jerome family to\nGrandchester, where they were awaited with profound expectation. But\nthe Anglican portion of the guests were not without their share of\necclesiastical and spiritual excitement, for the bishop was to preach\nthis day in the chapel of the Towers, a fine and capacious sanctuary of\nflorid Gothic, and hit lordship was a sacerdotal orator of repute.\n\nIt had been announced that the breakfast-hour was to be somewhat\nearlier. The ladies in general were punctual, and seemed conscious of\nsome great event impending. The Ladies Flora and Grizell entered with,\neach in her hand, a prayer-book of purple velvet, adorned with a decided\ncross, the gift of the primus. Lord Culloden, at the request of Lady\nCorisande, had consented to their hearing the bishop, which he would not\ndo himself. He passed his morning in finally examining the guardians'\naccounts, the investigation of which he conducted and concluded, during\nthe rest of the day, with Mr. Putney Giles. Mrs. Campian did not leave\nher room. Lord St. Aldegonde came down late, and looked about him with\nan uneasy, ill-humored air.\n\nWhether it were the absence of Theodora, or some other cause, he was\nbrusk, ungracious, scowling, and silent, only nodding to the bishop, who\nbenignly saluted him, refusing every dish that was offered; then getting\nup, and helping himself at the side-table, making a great noise with the\ncarving instruments, and flouncing down his plate when he resumed his\nseat. Nor was his costume correct. All the other gentlemen, though their\nusual morning-dresses were sufficiently fantastic--trunk-hose of every\nform, stockings bright as paroquets, wondrous shirts, and velvet-coats\nof every tint--habited themselves to-day, both as regards form and\ncolor, in a style indicative of the subdued gravity of their feelings.\nLord St. Aldegonde had on his shooting-jacket of brown velvet and a\npink-shirt and no cravat, and his rich brown locks, always, to a certain\ndegree, neglected, were peculiarly dishevelled.\n\nHugo Bohun, who was not afraid of him, and was a high-churchman,\nbeing, in religion, and in all other matters, always on the side of the\nduchesses, said: \"Well, St. Aldegonde, are you going to chapel in that\ndress?\" But St. Aldegonde would not answer; he gave a snort, and glanced\nat Hugo, with the eye of a gladiator.\n\nThe meal was over. The bishop was standing near the mantel-piece talking\nto the ladies, who were clustered round him; the archdeacon and the\nchaplain and some other clergy a little in the background; Lord St.\nAldegonde, who, whether there were a fire or not, always stood with\nhis back to the fireplace with his hands in his pockets, moved\ndiscourteously among them, assumed his usual position, and listened,\nas it were, grimly, for a few moments to their talk; then he suddenly\nexclaimed in a loud voice, and with the groan of a rebellious Titan,\n\"How I hate Sunday!\"\n\n\"Granville!\" exclaimed Lady St. Aldegonde, turning pale. There was a\ngeneral shudder.\n\n\"I mean in a country-house,\" said Lord St. Aldegonde. \"Of course, I mean\nin a country-house. I do not dislike it when alone, and I do not dislike\nit in London. But Sunday in a country-house is infernal.\"\n\n\"I think it is now time for us to go,\" said the bishop, walking away\nwith dignified reserve, and they all dispersed.\n\nThe service was choral and intoned; for, although the Rev. Dionysius\nSmylie had not yet had time or opportunity, as was his intention, to\nform and train a choir from the household of the Towers, he had secured\nfrom his neighboring parish and other sources external and effective aid\nin that respect. The parts of the service were skillfully distributed,\nand rarely were a greater number of priests enlisted in a more imposing\nmanner. A good organ was well played; the singing, as usual, a little\ntoo noisy; there was an anthem and an introit--but no incense, which was\nforbidden by the bishop; and, though there were candles on the altar,\nthey were not permitted to be lighted.\n\nThe sermon was most successful; the ladies returned with elate and\nanimated faces, quite enthusiastic and almost forgetting in their\nsatisfaction the terrible outrage of Lord St. Aldegonde. He himself had\nby this time repented of what he had done, and recovered his temper, and\ngreeted his wife with a voice and look which indicated to her practised\nsenses the favorable change.\n\n\"Bertha,\" he said, \"you know I did not mean any thing personal to the\nbishop in what I said. I do not like bishops; I think there is no use\nin them; but I have no objection to him personally; I think him an\nagreeable man; not at all a bore. Just put it right, Bertha. But I tell\nyou what, Bertha, I cannot go to church here. Lord Culloden does not go,\nand he is a very religious man. He is the man I most agree with on these\nmatters. I am a free-church man, and there is on end of it. I cannot go\nthis afternoon. I do not approve of the whole thing. It is altogether\nagainst my conscience. What I mean to do, if I can manage it, is to take\na real long walk with the Campians.\"\n\nMrs. Campian appeared at luncheon. The bishop was attentive to her; even\ncordial. He was resolved she should not feel he was annoyed by her not\nhaving been a member of his congregation in the morning. Lady Corisande\ntoo had said to him: \"I wish so much you would talk to Mrs. Campian;\nshe is a sweet, noble creature, and so clever! I feel that she might be\nbrought to view things in the right light.\"\n\n\"I never know,\" said the bishop, \"how to deal with these American\nladies. I never can make out what they believe, or what they disbelieve.\nIt is a sort of confusion between Mrs. Beecher Stowe and the Fifth\nAvenue congregation and--Barnum,\" he added with a twinkling eye.\n\nThe second service was late; the dean preached. The lateness of the hour\npermitted the lord-lieutenant and those guests who had arrived only the\nprevious day to look over the castle, or ramble about the gardens. St.\nAldegonde succeeded in his scheme of a real long walk with the Campians,\nwhich Lothair, bound to listen to the head of his college, was not\npermitted to share.\n\nIn the evening Signor Mardoni, who had arrived, and Madame Isola Bella,\nfavored them with what they called sacred music; principally prayers\nfrom operas and a grand Stabat Mater.\n\nLord Culloden invited Lothair into a farther saloon, where they might\nspeak without disturbing the performers or the audience.\n\n\"I'll just take advantage, my dear boy,\" said Lord Culloden, in a tone\nof unusual tenderness, and of Doric accent, \"of the absence of these\ngentlemen to have a little quiet conversation with you. Though I have\nnot seen so much of you of late as in old days, I take a great interest\nin you, no doubt of that, and I was very pleased to see how good-natured\nyou were to the girls. You have romped with them when they were little\nones. Now, in a few hours, you will be master of a great inheritance,\nand I hope it will profit ye. I have been over the accounts with Mr.\nGiles, and I was pleased to hear that you had made yourself properly\nacquainted with them in detail. Never you sign any paper without reading\nIt first, and knowing well what it means. You will have to sign a\nrelease to us if you be satisfied, and that you may easily be. My poor\nbrother-in-law left you as large an income as may be found on this side\nTrent, but I will be bound he would stare if he saw the total of\nthe whole of your rent-roll, Lothair. Your affairs have been well\nadministered, though I say it who ought not. But it is not my management\nonly, or principally, that has done it. It is the progress of the\ncountry, and you owe the country a good deal, and you should never\nforget you are born to be a protector of its liberties, civil and\nreligious. And if the country sticks to free trade, and would enlarge\nits currency, and be firm to the Protestant faith, it will, under Divine\nProvidence, continue to progress.\n\n\"And here, my boy, I'll just say a word, in no disagreeable manner,\nabout your religious principles. There are a great many stories about,\nand perhaps they are not true, and I am sure I hope they are not. If\npopery were only just the sign of the cross, and music, and censer-pots,\nthough I think them all superstitious, I'd be free to leave them alone\nif they would leave me. But popery is a much deeper thing than that,\nLothair, and our fathers found it out. They could not stand it, and we\nshould be a craven crew to stand it now. A man should be master in his\nown house. You will be taking a wife, some day; at least it is to be\nhoped so; and how will you like one of these monsignores to be walking\ninto her bedroom, eh; and talking to her alone when he pleases, and\nwhere he pleases; and when you want to consult your wife, which a wise\nman should often do, to find there is another mind between hers and\nyours? There's my girls, they are just two young geese, and they have a\nhankering after popery, having had a Jesuit in the house. I do not know\nwhat has become of the women. They are for going into a convent, and\nthey are quite right in that, for if they be papists they will not find\na husband easily in Scotland, I ween.\n\n\"And as for you, my boy, they will be telling you that it is only just\nthis and just that, and there's no great difference, and what not; but\nI tell you that, if once you embrace the scarlet lady, you are a tainted\ncorpse. You'll not be able to order your dinner without a priest, and\nthey will ride your best horses without saying with your leave or by\nyour leave.\"\n\nThe concert in time ceased; there was a stir in the room; the Rev.\nDionysius Smylie moved about mysteriously, and ultimately seemed to make\nan obeisance before the bishop. It was time for prayers.\n\n\"Shall you go?\" said Lord St. Aldegonde to Mrs. Campian, by whom he was\nsitting.\n\n\"I like to pray alone,\" she answered.\n\n\"As for that,\" said Aldegonde, \"I am not clear we ought to pray at all,\neither in public or private. It seems very arrogant in us to dictate to\nan all-wise Creator what we desire.\"\n\n\"I believe in the efficacy of prayer,\" said Theodora.\n\n\"And I believe in you,\" said St. Aldegonde, after a momentary pause.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 47\n\n\nOn the morrow, the early celebration in the chapel was numerously\nattended. The duchess and her daughters, Lady Agramont, and Mrs.\nArdenne, were among the faithful; but what encouraged and gratified the\nbishop was, that the laymen, on whom he less relied, were numerously\nrepresented. The lord-lieutenant, Lord Carisbrooke, Lord Montairy,\nBertram, and Hugo Bohun accompanied Lothair to the altar.\n\nAfter the celebration, Lothair retired to his private apartments. It\nwas arranged that he was to join his assembled friends at noon, when\nhe would receive their congratulations, and some deputations from the\ncounty.\n\nAt noon, therefore, preparatively preceded by Mr. Putney Giles,\nwhose thought was never asleep, and whose eye was on every thing, the\nguardians, the cardinal, and the Earl of Culloden, waited on Lothair to\naccompany him to his assembled friends, and, as it were, launch him into\nthe world.\n\nThey were assembled at one end of the chief gallery, and in a circle.\nAlthough the deputations would have to advance the whole length of the\nchamber, Lothair and his guardians entered from a side apartment. Even\nwith this assistance he felt very nervous. There was no lack of feeling,\nand, among many, of deep feeling, on this occasion, but there was an\nequal and a genuine exhibition of ceremony.\n\nThe lord-lieutenant was the first person who congratulated Lothair,\nthough the high-sheriff had pushed forward for that purpose, but, in his\nawkward precipitation, he got involved with the train of the Hon. Lady\nClotworthy, who bestowed on him such a withering glance, that he felt\na routed man, and gave up the attempt. There were many kind and some\nearnest words. Even St. Aldegonde acknowledged the genius of the\noccasion. He was grave, graceful, and dignified, and, addressing\nLothair by his title, he said, \"that he hoped he would meet in life that\nhappiness which he felt confident he deserved.\" Theodora said nothing,\nthough her lips seemed once to move; but she retained for a moment\nLothair's hand, and the expression of her countenance touched his\ninnermost heart. Lady Corisande beamed with dazzling beauty. Her\ncountenance was joyous, radiant; her mien imperial and triumphant. She\ngave her hand with graceful alacrity to Lothair, and said in a hushed\ntone, but every word of which reached his ear, \"One of the happiest\nhours of my life was eight o'clock this morning.\"\n\nThe lord-lieutenant and the county members then retired to the other end\nof the gallery, and ushered in the deputation of the magistracy of the\ncounty, congratulating their new brother, for Lothair had just\nbeen appointed to the bench, on his secession to his estates. The\nlord-lieutenant himself read the address, to which Lothair replied with\na propriety all acknowledged. Then came the address of the mayor and\ncorporation of Grandchester, of which city Lothair was hereditary\nhigh-steward; and then that of his tenantry, which was cordial and\ncharacteristic. And here many were under the impression that this\nportion of the proceedings would terminate; but it was not so. There had\nbeen some whispering between the bishop and the archdeacon, and the Rev.\nDionysius Smylie had, after conference with his superiors, twice left\nthe chamber. It seems that the clergy had thought fit to take this\noccasion of congratulating Lothair on his great accession and the\nproportionate duties which it would fall on him to fulfil. The bishop\napproached Lothair and addressed him in a whisper. Lothair seemed\nsurprised and a little agitated, but apparently bowed assent. Then the\nbishop and his staff proceeded to the end of the gallery and introduced\na diocesan deputation, consisting of archdeacons and rural deans, who\npresented to Lothair a most uncompromising address, and begged his\nacceptance of a bible and prayer-book richly bound, and borne by the\nRev. Dionysius Smylie on a cushion of velvet.\n\nThe habitual pallor of the cardinal's countenance became unusually wan;\nthe cheek of Clare Arundel was a crimson flush; Monsignore Catesby\nbit his lip; Theodora looked with curious seriousness, as if she were\nobserving the manners of a foreign country; St. Aldegonde snorted, and\npushed his hand through his hair, which had been arranged in unusual\norder. The great body of those present, unaware that this deputation was\nunexpected, were unmoved.\n\nIt was a trial for Lothair, and scarcely a fair one. He was not unequal\nto it, and what he said was esteemed, at the moment, by all parties\nas satisfactory; though the archdeacon, in secret conclave, afterward\nobserved that he dwelt more on religion than on the Church, and spoke of\nthe Church of Christ and not of the Church of England. He thanked them\nfor their present of volumes, which all must reverence or respect.\n\nWhile all this was taking place within the Towers, vast bodies of people\nwere assembling without. Besides the notables of the county and his\ntenantry and their families, which drained all the neighboring villages,\nLothair had forwarded several thousand tickets to the mayor\nand corporation of Grandchester, for distribution among their\nfellow-townsmen, who were invited to dine at Muriel and partake of the\nfestivities of the day, and trains were hourly arriving with their eager\nand happy guests. The gardens were at once open for their unrestricted\npleasure, but at two o'clock, according to the custom of the county\nunder such circumstances, Lothair held what, in fact, was a lev e, or\nrather a drawing-room, when every person who possessed a ticket was\npermitted, and even invited and expected, to pass through the whole\nrange of the state apartments of Muriel Towers, and at the same time pay\ntheir respects to, and make the acquaintance of, their lord.\n\nLothair stood with his chief friends near him, the ladies, however,\nseated, and every one passed--farmers and townsmen and honest folk, down\nto the stokers of the trains from Grandchester, with whose presence\nSt. Aldegonde was much pleased, and whom he carefully addressed as they\npassed by.\n\nAfter this great reception they all dined in pavilions in the park--one\nthousand tenantry by themselves, and at a fixed hour; the miscellaneous\nmultitude in a huge crimson tent, very lofty, with many flags, and in\nwhich was served a banquet that never stopped till sunset, so that in\ntime all might be satisfied; the notables and deputations, with the\nguests in the house, lunched in the armory. It was a bright day, and\nthere was unceasing music.\n\nIn the course of the afternoon Lothair visited the pavilions, where his\nhealth was proposed, and pledged--in the first by one of his tenants,\nand in the other by a workman, both orators of repute; and he addressed\nand thanked his friends. This immense multitude, orderly and joyous,\nroamed about the parks and gardens, or danced on a platform which\nthe prescient experience of Mr. Giles had provided for them in a due\nlocality, and whiled away the pleasant hours, in expectation a little\nfeverish of the impending fireworks, which, there was a rumor, were\nto be on a scale and in a style of which neither Grandchester nor the\ncounty had any tradition.\n\n\"I remember your words at Blenheim,\" said Lothair to Theodora. \"You\ncannot say the present party is founded on the principle of exclusion.\"\n\nIn the mean time, about six o'clock, Lothair dined in his great hall\nwith his two hundred guests at a banquet where all the resources of\nnature and art seemed called upon to contribute to its luxury and\nsplendor. The ladies, who had never before dined at a public dinner,\nwere particularly delighted. They were delighted by the speeches, though\nthey had very few; they were delighted by the national anthem, all\nrising; particularly, they were delighted by \"three-times-three, and one\ncheer more,\" and \"hip, hip.\" It seemed to their unpractised ears like\na great naval battle, or the end of the world, or any thing else of\nunimaginable excitement, tumult, and confusion.\n\nThe lord-lieutenant proposed Lothair's health, and dexterously made\nhis comparative ignorance of the subject the cause of his attempting\na sketch of what he hoped might be the character of the person whose\nhealth he proposed. Every one intuitively felt the resemblance was\njust, and even complete, and Lothair confirmed their kind and sanguine\nanticipations by his terse and well-considered reply. His proposition of\nthe ladies' healths was a signal that the carriages were ready to take\nthem, as arranged, to Muriel Mere.\n\nThe sun had set in glory over the broad expanse of waters still glowing\nin the dying beam; the people were assembled in thousands on the borders\nof the lake, in the centre of which was an island with a pavilion.\nFanciful barges and gondolas of various shapes and colors were waiting\nfor Lothair and his party, to carry them over to the pavilion, where\nthey found a repast which became the hour and the scene--coffee and\nices and whimsical drinks, which sultanas would sip in Arabian tales. No\nsooner were they seated than the sound of music was heard--distant, but\nnow nearer, till there came floating on the lake, until it rested before\nthe pavilion, a gigantic shell, larger than the building itself,\nbut holding in its golden and opal seats Signor Mardoni and all his\norchestra.\n\nThen came a concert rare in itself, but ravishing in the rosy twilight;\nand in about half an hour, when the rosy twilight had subsided into\na violet eve, and when the white moon that had only gleamed began\nto glitter, the colossal shell again moved on, and Lothair and his\ncompanions, embarking once more in their gondolas, followed it in\nprocession about the lake. He carried in his own bark the duchess,\nTheodora, and the lord-lieutenant, and was rowed by a crew in\nVenetian dresses. As he handed Theodora to her seat, the impulse was\nirresistible--he pressed her hand to his lips.\n\nSuddenly a rocket rose with a hissing rush from the pavilion. It was\ninstantly responded to from every quarter of the lake. Then the island\nseemed on fire, and the scene of their late festivity became a brilliant\npalace, with pediments and columns and statues, bright in the blaze of\ncolored flame. For half an hour the sky seemed covered with blue lights\nand the bursting forms of many-colored stars; golden fountains, like the\neruption of a marine volcano, rose from different parts of the water;\nthe statued palace on the island changed and became a forest glowing\nwith green light; and finally a temple of cerulean tint, on which\nappeared in huge letters of prismatic color the name of Lothair.\n\nThe people cheered, but even the voice of the people was overcome by\ntroops of rockets rising from every quarter of the lake, and by the\nthunder of artillery. When the noise and the smoke had both subsided,\nthe name of Lothair still legible on the temple but the letters quite\nwhite, it was perceived that on every height for fifty miles round they\nhad fired a beacon.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 48\n\n\nThe ball at Muriel which followed the concert on the lake was one of\nthose balls which, it would seem, never would end. All the preliminary\nfestivities, instead of exhausting the guests of Lothair, appeared only\nto have excited them, and rendered them more romantic and less tolerant\nof the routine of existence. They danced in the great gallery, which was\nbrilliant and crowded, and they danced as they dance in a festive dream,\nwith joy and the enthusiasm of gayety. The fine ladies would sanction\nno exclusiveness. They did not confine their inspiring society, as is\nsometimes too often the case, to the Brecons and the Bertrams and the\nCarisbrookes; they danced fully and freely with the youth of the county,\nand felt that in so doing they were honoring and gratifying their host.\n\nAt one o'clock they supped in the armory, which was illuminated for\nthe first time, and a banquet in a scene so picturesque and resplendent\nrenovated not merely their physical energies. At four o'clock the\nduchess and a few others quietly disappeared, but her daughters\nremained, and St. Aldegonde danced endless reels, which was a form in\nwhich he preferred to worship Terpsichore. Perceiving by an open window\nthat it was dawn, he came up to Lothair and said, \"This is a case of\nbreakfast.\"\n\nHappy and frolicsome suggestion! The invitations circulated, and it was\nsoon known that they were all to gather at the matin meal.\n\n\"I am so sorry that her grace has retired,\" said Hugo Bohun to Lady\nSt. Aldegonde, as he fed her with bread and butter, \"because she always\nlikes early breakfasts in the country.\"\n\nThe sun was shining as the guests of the house retired, and sank into\ncouches from which it seemed they never could rise again; but, long\nafter this, the shouts of servants and the scuffle of carriages\nintimated that the company in general were not so fortunate and\nexpeditious in their retirement from the scene; and the fields were all\nbusy, and even the towns awake, when the great body of the wearied but\ndelighted wassailers returned from celebrating the majority of Lothair.\n\nIn the vast and statesmanlike programme of the festivities of the week,\nwhich had been prepared by Mr and Mrs. Putney Giles, something of\ninterest and importance had been appropriated to the morrow, but it was\nnecessary to erase all this; and for a simple reason--no human being on\nthe morrow morn even appeared--one might say, even stirred. After all\nthe gay tumult in which even thousands had joined, Muriel Towers on\nthe morrow presented a scene which only could have been equalled by the\ncastle in the fairy tale inhabited by the Sleeping Beauty.\n\nAt length, about two hours after noon, bells began to sound which were\nnot always answered. Then a languid household prepared a meal of which\nno one for a time partook, till at last a monsignore appeared, and a\nrival Anglican or two. Then St. Aldegonde came in with a troop of men\nwho had been bathing in the mere, and called loudly for kidneys, which\nhappened to be the only thing not at hand, as is always the case. St.\nAldegonde always required kidneys when he had sat up all night and\nbathed. \"But the odd thing is,\" he said, \"you never can get any thing to\neat in these houses. Their infernal cooks spoil every thing. That's why\nI hate staying with Bertha's people in the north at the end of the year.\nWhat I want in November is a slice of cod and a beefsteak, and by Jove\nI never could get them; I was obliged to come to town. If is no joke to\nhave to travel three hundred miles for a slice of cod and a beefsteak.\"\n\nNotwithstanding all this, however, such is the magic of custom, that by\nsunset civilization had resumed its reign at Muriel Towers. The party\nwere assembled before dinner in the saloon, and really looked as fresh\nand bright as if the exhausting and tumultuous yesterday had never\nhappened. The dinner, too, notwithstanding the criticism of St.\nAldegonde, was first rate, and pleased palates not so simply fastidious\nas his own. The bishop and his suite were to depart on the morrow, but\nthe cardinal was to remain. His eminence talked much to Mrs. Campian, by\nwhom, from the first, he was much struck. He was aware that she was born\na Roman, and was not surprised that, having married a citizen of the\nUnited States, her sympathies were what are styled liberal; but this\nonly stimulated his anxious resolution to accomplish her conversion,\nboth religious and political. He recognized in her a being whose\nintelligence, imagination, and grandeur of character, might be of\ninvaluable service to the Church.\n\nIn the evening Monsieur Raphael and his sister, and their colleagues,\ngave a representation which was extremely well done. There was no\ntheatre at Muriel, but Apollonia had felicitously arranged a contiguous\nsaloon for the occasion, and, as everybody was at ease in an arm-chair,\nthey all agreed it was preferable to a regular theatre.\n\nOn the morrow they were to lunch with the mayor and corporation of\nGrandchester, and view some of the principal factories; on the next day\nthe county gave a dinner to Lothair in their hall, the lord-lieutenant\nin the chair; on Friday there was to be a ball at Grandchester given by\nthe county and city united to celebrate the great local event. It was\nwhispered that this was to be a considerable affair. There was not an\nhour of the week that was not appropriated to some festive ceremony.\n\nIt happened on the morning of Friday, the cardinal being alone with\nLothair, transacting some lingering business connected with the\nguardianship, and on his legs as he spoke, that he said: \"We live\nin such a happy tumult here, my dear child, that I have never had an\nopportunity of speaking to you on one or two points which interest\nme and should not be uninteresting to you. I remember a pleasant\nmorning-walk we had in the park at Vauxe, when we began a conversation\nwhich we never finished. What say you to a repetition of our stroll?\n'Tis a lovely day, and I dare say we might escape by this window, and\ngain some green retreat without any one disturbing us.\"\n\n\"I am quite of your eminence's mind,\" said Lothair, taking up a\nwide-awake, \"and I will lead you where it is not likely we shall be\ndisturbed.\"\n\nSo, winding their way through the pleasure-grounds, they entered by a\nwicket a part of the park where the sunny glades soon wandered among the\ntall fern and wild groves of venerable oaks.\n\n\"I sometimes feel,\" said the cardinal, \"that I may have been too\npunctilious in avoiding conversation with you on a subject the most\ninteresting and important to man. But I felt a delicacy in exerting my\ninfluence as a guardian on a subject my relations to which, when your\ndear father appointed me to that office, were so different from those\nwhich now exist. But you are now your own master; I can use no control\nover you but that influence which the words of truth must always\nexercise over an ingenuous mind.\"\n\nHis eminence paused for a moment and looked at his companion; but\nLothair remained silent, with his eyes fixed upon the ground.\n\n\"It has always been a source of satisfaction, I would even say\nconsolation, to me,\" resumed the cardinal, \"to know you were a religious\nman; that your disposition was reverential, which is the highest order\nof temperament, and brings us nearest to the angels. But we live\nin times of difficulty and danger--extreme difficulty and danger; a\nreligious disposition may suffice for youth in the tranquil hour, and he\nmay find, in due season, his appointed resting-place: but these are days\nof imminent peril; the soul requires a sanctuary. Is yours at hand?\"\n\nThe cardinal paused, and Lothair was obliged to meet a direct appeal.\nHe said then, after a momentary hesitation: \"When you last spoke to\nme, sir, on these grave matters, I said I was in a state of great\ndespondency. My situation now is not so much despondent as perplexed.\"\n\n\"And I wish you to tell me the nature of your perplexity,\" replied the\ncardinal, \"for there is no anxious embarrassment of mind which Divine\ntruth cannot disentangle and allay.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Lothair, \"I must say I am often perplexed at the\ndifferences which obtrude themselves between Divine truth and human\nknowledge.\"\n\n\"Those are inevitable,\" said the cardinal. \"Divine truth being\nunchangeable, and human knowledge changing every century; rather, I\nshould say, every generation.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, instead of human knowledge, I should have said human\nprogress,\" rejoined Lothair.\n\n\"Exactly,\" said the cardinal, \"but what is progress? Movement. But what\nif it be movement in the wrong direction? What if it be a departure from\nDivine truth?\"\n\n\"But I cannot understand why religion should be inconsistent with\ncivilization,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"Religion is civilization,\" said the cardinal; \"the highest: it is a\nreclamation of man from savageness by the Almighty. What the world calls\ncivilization, as distinguished from religion, is a retrograde movement,\nand will ultimately lead us back to the barbarism from which we have\nescaped. For instance, you talk of progress: what is the chief social\nmovement of all the countries that three centuries ago separated from\nthe unity of the Church of Christ? The rejection of the sacrament of\nChristian matrimony. The introduction of the law of divorce, which is,\nin fact, only a middle term to the abolition of marriage. What does\nthat mean? The extinction of the home and the household on which God\nhas rested civilization. If there be no home, the child belongs to the\nstate, not to the parent. The state educates the child, and without\nreligion, because the state in a country of progress acknowledges no\nreligion. For every man is not only to think as he likes, but to write\nand to speak as he likes, and to sow with both hands broadcast, where he\nwill, errors, heresies, and blasphemies, without any authority on earth\nto restrain the scattering of this seed of universal desolation. And\nthis system, which would substitute for domestic sentiment and Divine\nbelief the unlimited and licentious action of human intellect and human\nwill, is called progress. What is it but a revolt against God?\"\n\n\"I am sure I wish there were only one Church and one religion,\" said\nLothair.\n\n\"There is only one Church and only one religion,\" said the cardinal;\n\"all other forms and phrases are mere phantasms, without root, or\nsubstance, or coherency. Look at that unhappy Germany, once so proud\nof its Reformation. What they call the leading journal tells us to-day,\nthat it is a question there whether four-fifths or three-fourths of the\npopulation believe in Christianity. Some portion of it has already\ngone back, I understand, to Number Nip. Look at this unfortunate land,\ndivided, subdivided, parcelled out in infinite schism, with new oracles\nevery day, and each more distinguished for the narrowness of his\nintellect or the loudness of his lungs; once the land of saints and\nscholars, and people in pious pilgrimages, and finding always solace and\nsupport in the divine offices of an ever-present Church, which were a\ntrue though a faint type of the beautiful future that awaited man.\nWhy, only three centuries of this rebellion against the Most High have\nproduced throughout the world, on the subject the most important that\nman should possess a clear, firm faith, an anarchy of opinion, throwing\nout every monstrous and fantastic form, from a caricature of the Greek\nphilosophy to a revival of fetichism.\"\n\n\"It is a chaos,\" said Lothair, with a sigh.\n\n\"From which I wish to save you,\" said the cardinal, with some eagerness.\n\"This is not a time to hesitate. You must be for God, or for Antichrist.\nThe Church calls upon her children.\"\n\n\"I am not unfaithful to the Church,\" said Lothair, \"which was the Church\nof my fathers.\"\n\n\"The Church of England,\" said the cardinal. \"It was mine. I think of it\never with tenderness and pity. Parliament made the Church of England,\nand Parliament will unmake the Church of England. The Church of England\nis not the Church of the English. Its fate is sealed. It will soon\nbecome a sect, and all sects are fantastic. It will adopt new dogmas,\nor it will abjure old ones; any thing to distinguish it from the\nnon-conforming herd in which, nevertheless, it will be its fate to\nmerge. The only consoling hope is that, when it falls, many of its\nchildren, by the aid of the Blessed Virgin, may return to Christ.\"\n\n\"What I regret, sir,\" said Lothair, \"is that the Church of Rome should\nhave placed itself in antagonism with political liberty. This adds to\nthe difficulties which the religious cause has to encounter; for it\nseems impossible to deny that political freedom is now the sovereign\npassion of communities.\"\n\n\"I cannot admit,\" replied the cardinal, \"that the Church is in\nantagonism with political freedom. On the contrary, in my opinion, there\ncan be no political freedom which is not founded on Divine authority;\notherwise it can be at the best but a specious phantom of license\ninevitably terminating in anarchy. The rights and liberties of the\npeople of Ireland have no advocates except the Church; because, there,\npolitical freedom is founded on Divine authority; but if you mean by\npolitical freedom the schemes of the illuminati and the freemasons,\nwhich perpetually torture the Continent, all the dark conspiracies of\nthe secret societies, there, I admit, the Church is in antagonism\nwith such aspirations after liberty; those aspirations, in fact, are\nblasphemy and plunder; and, if the Church were to be destroyed, Europe\nwould be divided between the atheist and the communist.\"\n\nThere was a pause; the conversation had unexpectedly arrived at a point\nwhere neither party cared to pursue it. Lothair felt he had said enough;\nthe cardinal was disappointed with what Lothair had said. His eminence\nfelt that his late ward was not in that ripe state of probation which he\nhad fondly anticipated; but, being a man not only of vivid perception,\nbut also of fertile resource, while he seemed to close the present\nconversation, he almost immediately pursued his object by another\ncombination of means. Noticing an effect of scenery which pleased\nhim, reminded him of Styria, and so on, he suddenly said: \"You should\ntravel.\"\n\n\"Well, Bertram wants me to go to Egypt with him,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"A most interesting country,\" said the cardinal, \"and well worth\nvisiting. It is astonishing what a good guide old Herodotus still is in\nthat land! But you should know something of Europe before you go there.\nEgypt is rather a land to end with. A young man should visit the chief\ncapitals of Europe, especially the seats of learning and the arts. If my\nadvice were asked by a young man who contemplated travelling on a proper\nscale, I should say begin with Rome. Almost all that Europe contains\nis derived from Rome. It is always best to go to the fountain-head, to\nstudy the original. The society too, there, is delightful; I know none\nequal to it. That, if you please, is civilization--pious and refined.\nAnd the people--all so gifted and so good--so kind, so orderly, so\ncharitable, so truly virtuous. I believe the Roman people to be the best\npeople that ever lived, and this too while the secret societies have\ntheir foreign agents in every quarter, trying to corrupt them, but\nalways in vain. If an act of political violence occurs, you may be sure\nit is confined entirely to foreigners.\"\n\n\"Our friends the St. Jeromes are going to Rome,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"Well, and that would be pleasant for you. Think seriously of this, my\ndear, young friend. I could be of some little service to you if you go\nto Rome, which, after all, every man ought to do. I could put you, in\nthe way of easily becoming acquainted with all the right people, who\nwould take care that you saw Rome with profit and advantage.\"\n\nJust at this moment, in a winding glade, they were met abruptly by a\nthird person. All seemed rather to start at the sudden rencounter; and\nthen Lothair eagerly advanced and welcomed the stranger with a proffered\nhand.\n\n\"This is a most unexpected, but to me most agreeable, meeting,\" he said.\n\"You must now be my guest.\"\n\n\"That would be a great honor,\" said the stranger, \"but one I cannot\nenjoy. I had to wait at the station a couple of hours or so for my\ntrain, and they told me if I strolled here I. should find some pretty\ncountry. I have been so pleased with it, that I fear I have strolled too\nlong, and I literally have not an instant at my command,\" and he hurried\naway.\n\n\"Who is that person?\" asked the cardinal with some agitation.\n\n\"I have not the slightest idea,\" said Lothair. \"All I know is, he once\nsaved my life.\"\n\n\"And all I know is,\" said the cardinal, \"he once threatened mine.\"\n\n\"Strange!\" said Lothair, and then he rapidly recounted to the cardinal\nhis adventure at the Fenian meeting.\n\n\"Strange!\" echoed his eminence.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 49\n\n\nMrs. Campian did not appear at luncheon, which was observed but not\nnoticed. Afterward, while Lothair was making some arrangements for the\namusement of his guests, and contriving that they should fit in with\nthe chief incident of the day, which was the banquet given to him by\nthe county, and which it was settled the ladies were not to attend, the\ncolonel took him aside and said, \"I do not think that Theodora will care\nto go out to-day.\"\n\n\"She is not unwell, I hope?\"\n\n\"Not exactly--but she has had some news, some news of some friends,\nwhich has disturbed her. And, if you will excuse me, I will request your\npermission not to attend the dinner to-day, which I had hoped to have\nhad the honor of doing. But I think our plans must be changed a little.\nI almost think we shall not go to Scotland after all.\"\n\n\"There is not the slightest necessity for your going to the dinner. You\nwill have plenty to keep you in countenance at home. Lord St. Aldegonde\nis not going, nor I fancy any of them. I shall take the duke with me and\nLord Culloden, and, if you do not go, I shall take Mr. Putney Giles.\nThe lord-lieutenant will meet us there. I am sorry about Mrs. Campian,\nbecause I know she is not ever put out by little things. May I not see\nher in the course of the day? I should be very sorry that the day should\npass over without seeing her.\"\n\n\"Oh! I dare say she will see you in the course of the day, before you\ngo.\"\n\n\"When she likes. I shall not go out to-day; I shall keep in my rooms,\nalways at her commands. Between ourselves, I shall not be sorry to have\na quiet morning and collect my ideas a little. Speech-making is a new\nthing for me. I wish you would tell me what to say to the county.\"\n\nLothair had appropriated to the Campians one of the most convenient and\ncomplete apartments in the castle. It consisted of four chambers, one of\nthem a saloon which had been fitted up for his mother when she married;\na pretty saloon, hung with pale-green silk, and portraits and scenes\ninlaid by Vanloo and Boucher. It was rather late in the afternoon when\nLothair received a message from Theodora in reply to the wish that he\nhad expressed of seeing her.\n\nWhen he entered the room, she was not seated; her countenance was\nserious. She advanced, and thanked him for wishing to see her, and\nregretted she could not receive him at an earlier hour. \"I fear it\nmay have inconvenienced you,\" she added; \"but my mind has been much\ndisturbed, and too agitated for conversation.\"\n\n\"Even now I may be an intruder?\"\n\n\"No, it is past; on the contrary, I wish to speak to you; indeed, you\nare the only person with whom I could speak,\" and she sat down.\n\nHer countenance, which was unusually pale when he entered, became\nflushed. \"It is not a subject for the festive hour of your life,\" she\nsaid, \"but I cannot resist my fate.\"\n\n\"Your fate must always interest me,\" murmured Lothair.\n\n\"Yes; but my fate is the fate of ages and of nations,\" said Theodora,\nthrowing up her head with that tumult of the brow which he had once\nbefore noticed. \"Amid the tortures of my spirit at this moment, not the\nleast is that there is only one person I can appeal to, and he is one to\nwhom I have no right to make that appeal.\"\n\n\"If I be that person,\" said Lothair, \"you have every right, for I am\ndevoted to you.\"\n\n\"Yes; but it is not personal devotion that is the qualification needed.\nIt is not sympathy with me that would authorize such an appeal. It\nmust be sympathy with a cause, and a cause for which, I fear, you do\nnot--perhaps I should say you cannot--feel.\"\n\n\"Why?\" said Lothair.\n\n\"Why should you feel for my fallen country, who are the proudest\ncitizen of the proudest of lands? Why should you feel for its debasing\nthraldom--you who, in the religious mystification of man, have, at\nleast, the noble privilege of being a Protestant?\"\n\n\"You speak of Rome?\"\n\n\"Yes, of the only thought I have, or ever had. I speak of that country\nwhich first impressed upon the world a general and enduring form of\nmasculine virtue; the land of liberty, and law, and eloquence, and\nmilitary genius, now garrisoned by monks, and governed by a doting\npriest.\"\n\n\"Everybody must be interested about Rome,\" said Lothair. \"Rome is the\ncountry of the world, and even the doting priest you talk of boasts of\ntwo hundred millions of subjects.\"\n\n\"If he were at Avignon again, I should not care for his boasts,\" said\nTheodora. \"I do not grudge him his spiritual subjects; I am content to\nleave his superstition to Time. Time is no longer slow; his scythe mows\nquickly in this age. But when his debasing creeds are palmed off on man\nby the authority of our glorious capitol, and the slavery of the human\nmind is schemed and carried on in the forum, then, if there be real\nRoman blood left--and I thank my Creator there is much--it is time for\nit to mount and move,\" and she rose and walked up and down the room.\n\n\"You have had news from Rome?\" said Lothair.\n\n\"I have had news from Rome,\" she replied, speaking slowly in a deep\nvoice; and there was a pause.\n\nThen Lothair said: \"When you have alluded to these matters before, you\nnever spoke of them in a sanguine spirit.\"\n\n\"I have seen the cause triumph,\" said Theodora; \"the sacred cause of\ntruth, of justice, of national honor. I have sat at the feet of the\ntriumvirate of the Roman Republic; men who, for virtue, and genius, and\nwarlike skill and valor, and every quality that exalts man, were never\nsurpassed in the olden time--no, not by the Catos and the Scipios; and\nI have seen the blood of my own race poured, like a rich vintage, on the\nvictorious Roman soil; my father fell, who, in stature and in mien, was\na god; and, since then, my beautiful brothers, with shapes to enshrine\nin temples; and I have smiled amid the slaughter of my race, for I\nbelieved that Rome was free; and yet all this vanished. How, then, when\nwe talked, could I be sanguine?\"\n\n\"And yet you are sanguine now?\" said Lothair, with a scrutinizing\nglance; and he rose and joined her, leaning slightly on the\nmantel-piece.\n\n\"There was only one event that could secure the success of our efforts,\"\nsaid Theodora, \"and that event was so improbable, that I had long\nrejected it from calculation. It has happened, and Rome calls upon me to\nact.\"\n\n\"The Papalini are strong,\" continued Theodora, after a pause; \"they have\nbeen long preparing for the French evacuation; they have a considerable\nand disciplined force of janizaries, a powerful artillery, the strong\nplaces of the city. The result of a rising, under such circumstances,\nmight be more than doubtful; if unsuccessful, to us it would be\ndisastrous. It is necessary that the Roman States should be invaded, and\nthe papal army must then quit their capital. We have no fear of them in\nthe field. Yes,\" she added, with energy, \"we could sweep them from the\nface of the earth!\"\n\n\"But the army of Italy,\" said Lothair, \"will that be inert?\"\n\n\"There it is,\" said Theodora. \"That has been our stumbling-block. I have\nalways known that, if ever the French quitted Rome, it would be on the\nunderstanding that the house of Savoy should inherit the noble office\nof securing our servitude. He in whom I alone confide would never credit\nthis; but my information, in this respect, was authentic. However, it\nis no longer necessary to discuss the question. News has come, and in no\nuncertain shape, that whatever may have been the understanding, under\nno circumstances will the Italian army enter the Roman state. We must\nstrike, therefore, and Rome will be free. But how am I to strike? We\nhave neither money nor arms. We have only men. I can give them no more,\nbecause I have already given them every thing, except my life, which\nis always theirs. As for my husband, who, I may say, wedded me on the\nbattle-field, so fax as wealth was concerned, he was then a prince among\nprinces, and would pour forth his treasure, and his life, with equal\neagerness. But things have changed since Aspromonte. The struggle in\nhis own country has entirely deprived him of revenues as great as any\nforfeited by their Italian princelings. In fact, it is only by a chance\nthat he is independent. Had it not been for an excellent man, one of\nyour great English merchants, who was his agent here, and managed his\naffairs, we should have been penniless. His judicious investments of\nthe superfluity of our income, which, at the time, my husband never even\nnoticed, have secured for Colonel Campian the means of that decorous\nlife which he appreciates--but no more. As for myself, these\nconsiderations are nothing. I will not say I should be insensible to a\nrefined life with refined companions, if the spirit were content and the\nheart serene; but I never could fully realize the abstract idea of what\nthey call wealth; I never could look upon it except as a means to\nan end, and my end has generally been military material. Perhaps the\nvicissitudes of my life have made me insensible to what are called\nreverses of fortune, for, when a child, I remember sleeping on the\nmoonlit flags of Paris, with no pillow except my tambourine; and I\nremember it not without delight. Let us sit down. I feel I am talking in\nan excited, injudicious, egotistical, rhapsodical, manner. I thought I\nwas calm, and I meant to have been clear. But the fact is, I am ashamed\nof myself. I am doing a wrong thing, and in a wrong manner. But I have\nhad a sleepless night, and a day of brooding thought. I meant once to\nhave asked you to help me, and now I feel that you are the last person\nto whom I ought to appeal.\"\n\n\"In that you are in error,\" said Lothair, rising and taking her hand\nwith an expression of much gravity; \"I am the right person for you to\nappeal to--the only person.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Theodora, and she shook her head.\n\n\"For I owe to you a debt that I never can repay,\" continued Lothair.\n\"Had it not been for you, I should have remained what I was when we\nfirst met, a prejudiced, narrow-minded being, with contracted sympathies\nand false knowledge, wasting my life on obsolete trifles, and utterly\ninsensible to the privilege of living in this wondrous age of change and\nprogress. Why, had it not been for you I should have at this very moment\nbeen lavishing my fortune on an ecclesiastical toy, which I think of\nwith a blush. There may be--doubtless there are--opinions in which\nwe may not agree; but in our love of truth and justice there is no\ndifference, dearest lady. No; though you must have felt that I am\nnot--that no one could be--insensible to your beauty and infinite\ncharms, still it is your consummate character that has justly fascinated\nmy thought and heart; and I have long resolved, were I permitted, to\ndevote to you my fortune and my life.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 50\n\n\nThe month of September was considerably advanced when a cab, evidently\nfrom its luggage fresh from the railway, entered the court-yard of\nHexham House, of which the shuttered windows indicated the absence of\nits master, the cardinal, then in Italy. But it was evident that the\nperson who had arrived was expected, for before his servant could ring\nthe hall-bell the door opened, and a grave-looking domestic advanced\nwith much deference, and awaited the presence of no less a personage\nthan Monsignore Berwick.\n\n\"We have had a rough passage, good Clifford,\" said the great man,\nalighting, \"but I see you duly received my telegram. You are always\nready.\"\n\n\"I hope my lord will find it not uncomfortable,\" said Clifford. \"I have\nprepared the little suite which you mentioned, and have been careful\nthat there should be no outward sign of any one having arrived.\"\n\n\"And now,\" said the monsignore, stopping for a moment in the ball, \"here\nis a letter which must be instantly delivered, and by a trusty hand,\"\nand he gave it to Mr. Clifford, who, looking at the direction, nodded\nhis head and said, \"By no one but myself. I will show my lord to his\nrooms and depart with this instantly.\"\n\n\"And bring back a reply,\" added the monsignore.\n\nThe well-lit room, the cheerful fire, the judicious refection on\na side-table, were all circumstances which usually would have been\nagreeable to a wearied traveller, but Monsignore Berwick seemed little\nto regard them. Though a man in general superior to care, and master of\nthought, his countenance was troubled and pensive even to dejection.\n\n\"Even the winds and waves are against us,\" he exclaimed, too restless\nto be seated, and walking up and down the room with his arms behind\nhis back. \"That such a struggle should fall to my lot! Why was I not a\nminister in the days of the Gregorys, the Innocents, even the Leos! But\nthis is craven. There should be inspiration in peril, and the greatest\nwhere peril is extreme. I am a little upset--with travel and the voyage\nand those telegrams not being answered. The good Clifford was wisely\nprovident,\" and he approached the table and took one glass of wine.\n\"Good! One must never despair in such a cause. And if the worse happens,\nit has happened before--and what then? Suppose Avignon over again, or\neven Gaeta, or even Paris? So long as we never relinquish our title to\nthe Eternal City we shall be eternal. But then, some say, our enemies\nbefore were the sovereigns; now it is the people. Is it so? True we have\nvanquished kings, and baffled emperors--but the French Republic and the\nRoman Republic have alike reigned and ruled in the Vatican, and where\nare they? We have lost provinces, but we have also gained them. We have\ntwelve millions of subjects in the United States of America, and they\nwill increase like the sands of the sea. Still it is a hideous thing to\nhave come back, as it were, to the days of the Constable of Bourbon, and\nto be contemplating the siege of the Holy See, and massacre and pillage\nand ineffable horrors! The papacy may survive such calamities, as it\nundoubtedly will, but I shall scarcely figure in history if, under my\ninfluence, such visitations should accrue. If I had only to deal with\nmen, I would not admit of failure; but when your antagonists are human\nthoughts, represented by invisible powers, there is something that might\nbaffle a Machiavel and appall a Borgia.\"\n\nWhile he was meditating in this vein the door opened, and Mr. Clifford,\nwith some hasty action and speaking rapidly, exclaimed: \"He said he\nwould be here sooner than myself. His carriage was at the door. I drove\nback as soon as possible--and indeed I hear something now in the court,\"\nand he disappeared.\n\nIt was only to usher in, almost immediately, a stately personage in an\nevening dress, and wearing a decoration of a high class, who saluted the\nmonsignore with great cordiality.\n\n\"I am engaged to dine with the Prussian ambassador, who has been obliged\nto come to town to receive a prince of the blood who is visiting the\ndockyards here; but I thought you might be later than you expected, and\nI ordered my carriage to be in waiting, so that we have a good little\nhour--and I can come on to you again afterward, if that will not do.\"\n\n\"A little hour with us is a long hour with other people,\" said the\nmonsignore, \"because we are friends and can speak without windings. You\nare a true friend to the Holy See; you have proved it. We are in great\ntrouble and need of aid.\"\n\n\"I hear that things are not altogether as we could wish,\" said the\ngentleman in an evening dress; \"but I hope, and should think, only\nannoyances.\"\n\n\"Dangers,\" said Berwick, \"and great.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"Well, we have invasion threatening us without and insurrection within,\"\nsaid Berwick. \"We might, though it is doubtful, successfully encounter\none of these perils, but their united action must be fatal.\"\n\n\"All this has come suddenly,\" said the gentleman. \"In the summer you\nhad no fear, and our people wrote to us that we might be perfectly\ntranquil.\"\n\n\"Just so,\" said Berwick. \"If we had met a month ago, I should have\ntold you the same thing. A month ago the revolution seemed lifeless,\npenniless; without a future, without a resource. They had no money, no\ncredit, no men. At present, quietly but regularly, they are assembling\nby thousands on our frontiers; thy have to our knowledge received two\nlarge consignments of small arms, and apparently have unlimited credit\nwith the trade, both in Birmingham and Li ge; they have even artillery;\nevery thing is paid for in coin or in good bills--and, worst of all,\nthey have a man, the most consummate soldier in Europe. I thought he\nwas at New York, and was in hopes he would never have recrossed the\nAtlantic--but I know that he passed through Florence a fortnight ago,\nand I have seen a man who says he spoke to him at Narni.\"\n\n\"The Italian government must stop all this,\" said the gentleman.\n\n\"They do not stop it,\" said Berwick. \"The government of his holiness\nhas made every representation to them: we have placed in their hands\nindubitable evidence of the illegal proceedings that are taking place\nand of the internal dangers we experience in consequence of their\nexterior movements. But they do nothing: it is even believed that the\nroyal troops are joining the insurgents, and Garibaldi is spouting with\nimpunity in every balcony of Florence.\"\n\n\"You may depend upon it that our government is making strong\nrepresentations to the government of Florence.\"\n\n\"I come from Paris and elsewhere,\" said Berwick, with animation and\nperhaps a degree of impatience. \"I have seen everybody there, and I have\nheard every thing. It is not representations that are wanted from your\ngovernment; it is something of a different kind.\"\n\n\"But if you have seen everybody at Paris and heard every thing, how can\nI help you?\"\n\n\"By acting upon the government here. A word from you to the English\nminister would have great weight at this juncture. Queen Victoria is\ninterested in the maintenance of the papal throne. Her Catholic subjects\nare counted by millions. The influence of his holiness has been hitherto\nexercised against the Fenians. France would interfere, if she was sure\nthe step would not be disapproved by England.\"\n\n\"Interfere!\" said the gentleman. \"Our return to Rome almost before\nwe have paid our laundresses' bills in the Eternal City would be a\ndiplomatic scandal.\"\n\n\"A diplomatic scandal would be preferable to a European revolution.\"\n\n\"Suppose we were to have both?\" and the gentleman drew his chair near\nthe fire.\n\n\"I am convinced that a want of firmness now,\" said Berwick, \"would lead\nto inconceivable calamities for all of us.\"\n\n\"Let us understand each other, my very dear friend Berwick,\" said his\ncompanion, and he threw his arm over the back of his chair and\nlooked the Roman full in his face. \"You say you have been at Paris and\nelsewhere, and have seen everybody and heard every thing?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n\"Something has happened to us also during the last month, and as\nunexpectedly as to yourselves.\"\n\n\"The secret societies? Yes, he spoke to me on that very point, and\nfully. 'Tis strange, but is only, in my opinion, an additional argument\nin favor of crushing the evil influence.\"\n\n\"Well, that he must decide. But the facts are startling. A month ago the\nsecret societies in France were only a name; they existed only in the\nmemory of the police, and almost as a tradition. At present we know that\nthey are in complete organization, and what is most strange is that the\nprefects write they have information that the Mary-Anne associations,\nwhich are essentially republican and are scattered about the provinces,\nare all revived, and are astir. Mary-Anne, as you know, was the red name\nfor the republic years ago, and there always was a sort of myth that\nthese societies had been founded by a woman. Of course that is all\nnonsense, but they keep it up; it affects the public imagination, and\nmy government has undoubted evidence that the word of command has gone\nround to all these societies that Mary-Anne has; returned and will issue\nher orders, which must be obeyed.\"\n\n\"The Church is stronger, and especially in the provinces, than the\nMary-Anne societies,\" said Berwick.\n\n\"I hope so,\" said his friend; \"but you see, my dear monsignore, the\nquestion with us is not so simple as you put It. The secret societies\nwill not tolerate another Roman interference, to say nothing of the\ndiplomatic hubbub, which we might, if necessary, defy; but what if,\ntaking advantage of the general indignation, your new kingdom of Italy\nmay seize the golden opportunity of making a popular reputation, and\ndeclare herself the champion of national independence against the\ninterference of the foreigner? My friend, we tread on delicate ground.\"\n\n\"If Rome falls, not an existing dynasty in Europe will survive five\nyears,\" said Berwick.\n\n\"It may be so,\" said his companion, but with no expression of\nincredulity. \"You know how consistently and anxiously I have always\nlabored to support the authority of the Holy See, and to maintain its\nterritorial position as the guarantee of its independence; but Fate has\ndecided against us. I cannot indulge in the belief that his holiness\nwill ever regain his lost provinces; a capital without a country is an\napparent anomaly, which I fear will always embarrass us. We can treat\nthe possession as the capital of Christendom, but, alas! all the world\nare not as good Christians as ourselves, and Christendom is a country\nno longer marked out in the map of the world. I wish,\" continued the\ngentleman in a tone almost coaxing--\"I wish we could devise some plan\nwhich, humanly speaking, would secure to his holiness the possession\nof his holy throne forever. I wish I could induce you to consider more\nfavorably that suggestion, that his holiness should content himself with\nthe ancient city, and, in possession of St. Peter's and the Vatican,\nleave the rest of, Rome to the vulgar cares and the mundane anxieties\nof the transient generation. Yes,\" he added with energy, \"if, my dear\nBerwick, you could see your way to this, or something like this, I think\neven now and at once, I could venture to undertake that the emperor, my\nmaster, would soon put an end to all these disturbances and dangers, and\nthat--\"\n\n\"Non possumus,\" said Berwick, sternly stopping him; \"sooner than that\nAttila, the Constable of Bourbon, or the blasphemous orgies of the Red\nRepublic! After all, it is the Church against the secret societies.\nThey are the only two strong things in Europe, and will survive kings,\nemperors, or parliaments.\"\n\nAt this moment there was a tap at the door, and, bidden to enter, Mr.\nClifford presented himself with a sealed paper, for the gentleman in\nevening dress. \"Your secretary, sir, brought this, which he said must be\ngiven you before you went to the ambassador.\"\n\n\"'Tis well,\" said the gentleman, and he rose, and with a countenance of\nsome excitement read the paper, which contained a telegram; and then he\nsaid: \"This, I think, will help us out of our immediate difficulties,\nmy dear monsignore. Rattazzi has behaved like a man of sense, and has\narrested Garibaldi. But you do not seem, my friend, as pleased as I\nshould have anticipated.\"\n\n\"Garibaldi has been arrested before,\" said Berwick.\n\n\"Well, well, I am hopeful; but I must go to my dinner. I will see you\nagain tomorrow.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 51\n\n\nThe continuous gathering of what, in popular language, were styled the\nGaribaldi Volunteers, on the southern border of the papal territory\nin the autumn of 1867, was not the only or perhaps the greatest danger\nwhich then threatened the Holy See, though the one which most attracted\nits alarmed attention. The considerable numbers in which this assemblage\nwas suddenly occurring; the fact that the son of the Liberator had\nalready taken its command, and only as the precursor of his formidable\nsire; the accredited rumor that Ghirelli at the head of a purely Roman\nlegion was daily expected to join the frontier force; that Nicotera was\nstirring in the old Neapolitan kingdom, while the Liberator himself\nat Florence and in other parts of Tuscany was even ostentatiously,\ncertainly with impunity, preaching the new crusade and using all his\nirresistible influence with the populace to excite their sympathies and\nto stimulate their energy, might well justify the extreme apprehension\nof the court of Rome. And yet dangers at least equal, and almost as\nclose, were at the same time preparing unnoticed and unknown.\n\nIn the mountainous range between Fiascone and Viterbo, contiguous to\nthe sea, is a valley surrounded by chains of steep and barren hills, but\nwhich is watered by a torrent scarcely dry, even in summer; so that\nthe valley itself, which is not inconsiderable in its breadth, is never\nwithout verdure, while almost a forest of brushwood formed of shrubs,\nwhich in England we should consider rare, bounds the natural turf and\nascends sometimes to no inconsiderable height the nearest hills.\n\nInto this valley, toward the middle of September, there defiled one\nafternoon through a narrow pass a band of about fifty men, all armed,\nand conducting a cavalcade or rather a caravan of mules laden with\nmunitions of war and other stores. When they had gained the centre\nof the valley and a general halt was accomplished, their commander,\naccompanied by one who was apparently an officer, surveyed all the\npoints of the locality; and, when their companions had rested and\nrefreshed themselves, they gave the necessary orders for the preparation\nof a camp. The turf already afforded a sufficient area for their present\nwants, but it was announced that on the morrow they must commence\nclearing the brushwood. In the mean time, one of the liveliest scenes\nof military life soon rapidly developed itself: the canvas houses\nwere pitched, the sentries appointed, the videttes established. The\ncommissariat was limited to bread and olives, and generally the running\nstream, varied sometimes by coffee, and always consoled by tobacco.\n\nOn the third day, amid their cheerful though by no means light labors, a\nsecond caravan arrived, evidently expected and heartily welcomed. Then,\nin another eight-and-forty hours, smaller bodies of men seemed to drop\ndown from the hills, generally without stores, but always armed. Then\nmen came from neighboring islands in open boats, and one morning a\nconsiderable detachment crossed the water from Corsica. So that at the\nend of a week or ten days there was an armed force of several hundred\nmen in this once silent valley, now a scene of constant stir and\ncontinual animation, for some one or something was always arriving, and\nfrom every quarter; men and arms and stores crept in from every wild\npass of the mountains and every little rocky harbor of the coast.\n\nAbout this time, while the officer in command was reviewing a\nconsiderable portion of the troops, the rest laboring in still clearing\nthe brushwood and establishing the many works incidental to a camp, half\na dozen horsemen were seen descending the mountain-pass by which the\noriginal body had entered the valley. A scout had preceded them, and\nthe troops with enthusiasm awaited the arrival of that leader, a message\nfrom whose magic name had summoned them to this secluded rendezvous from\nmany a distant state and city. Unruffled, but with an inspiring fire in\nhis pleased keen eye, that general answered their devoted salute, whom\nhitherto we have known by his travelling name of Captain Bruges.\n\nIt was only toward the end of the preceding month that he had resolved\nto take the field; but the organization of the secret societies is\nso complete that he knew he could always almost instantly secure the\nassembling of a picked force in a particular place. The telegraph\ncirculated its mystic messages to every part of France and Italy and\nBelgium, and to some old friends not so conveniently at hand, but who he\ndoubted not would arrive in due time for action. He himself had employed\nthe interval in forwarding all necessary supplies, and he had passed\nthrough Florence in order that he might confer with the great spirit of\nItalian movement and plan with him the impending campaign.\n\nAfter he had passed in review the troops, the general, with the officers\nof his staff who had accompanied him, visited on foot every part of\nthe camp. Several of the men he recognized by name; to all of them he\naddressed some inspiring word; a memory of combats in which they had\nfought together, or happy allusions to adventures if romantic peril;\nsome question which indicated that local knowledge which is magical\nfor those who are away from home; mixed with all this, sharp, clear\ninquiries as to the business of the hour, which proved the master of\ndetail, severe in discipline, but never deficient in sympathy for his\ntroops.\n\nAfter sunset, enveloped in their cloaks, the general and his companions,\nthe party increased by the officers who had been in command previous to\nhis arrival, smoked their cigars round the camp-fire.\n\n\"Well, Sarano,\" said the general, \"I will look over your muster-roll\nto-morrow, but I should suppose I may count on a thousand rifles or so.\nI want three, and we shall get them. The great man would have supplied\nthem me at once, but I will not have boys. He must send those on to\nMenotti. I told him: 'I am not a man of genius; I do not pretend to\nconquer kingdoms with boys. Give me old soldiers, men who have served\na couple of campaigns, and been seasoned with four-and-twenty months of\ncamp-life, and I will not disgrace you or myself.'\"\n\n\"We have had no news from the other place for a long time,\" said Sarano.\n\"How is it?\"\n\n\"Well enough. They are in the mountains about Nerola, in a position not\nvery unlike this; numerically strong, for Nicotera has joined them, and\nGhirelli with the Roman Legion is at hand. They must be quiet till the\ngreat man joins them; I am told they are restless. There has been too\nmuch noise about the whole business. Had they been as mum as you have\nbeen, we should not have had all these representations from France and\nthese threatened difficulties from that quarter. The Papalini would have\ncomplained and remonstrated, and Rattazzi could have conscientiously\nassured the people at Paris that they were dealing with exaggerations\nand bugbears; the very existence of the frontier force would have become\na controversy, and, while the newspapers were proving it was a myth, we\nshould have been in the Vatican.\"\n\n\"And when shall we be there, general?\"\n\n\"I do not want to move for a month. By that time I shall have two\nthousand five hundred or three thousand of my old comrades, and the\ngreat man will have put his boys in trim. Both bodies must leave their\nmountains at the same time, join in the open country, and march to\nRome.\"\n\nAs the night advanced, several of the party rose and left the\ncamp-fire--some to their tents, some to their duties. Two of the staff\nremained with the general.\n\n\"I am disappointed and uneasy that we have not heard from Paris,\" said\none of them.\n\n\"I am disappointed,\" said the general, \"but not uneasy; she never makes\na mistake.\"\n\n\"The risk was too great,\" rejoined the speaker in a depressed tone.\n\n\"I do not see that,\" said the general. \"What is the risk? Who could\npossibly suspect the lady's maid of the Princess of Tivoli! I am told\nthat the princess has become quite a favorite at the Tuileries.\"\n\n\"They say that the police is not so well informed as it used to be;\nnevertheless, I confess I should be much happier were she sitting round\nthis camp-fire.\"\n\n\"Courage!\" said the general. \"I do not believe in many things, but I do\nbelieve in the divine Theodora. What say you, Captain Muriel? I hope you\nare not offended by my criticism of young soldiers. You are the youngest\nin our band, but you have good military stuff in you, and will be soon\nseasoned.\"\n\n\"I feel I serve under a master of the art,\" replied Lothair, \"and will\nnot take the gloomy view of Colonel Campian about our best friend,\nthough I share all his disappointment. It seems to me that detection is\nimpossible. I am sure that I could not have recognized her when I handed\nthe princess into her carriage.\"\n\n\"The step was absolutely necessary,\" said the general; \"no one could be\ntrusted but herself--no other person has the influence. All our danger\nis from France. The Italian troops will never cross the frontier to\nattack us, rest assured of that. I have proof of it. And it is most\ndifficult, almost impossible, for the French to return. There never\nwould have been an idea of such a step, if there had been a little more\ndiscretion at Florence, less of those manifestoes and speeches from\nbalconies. But we must not criticise one who is above criticism. Without\nhim we could do nothing, and when he stamps his foot men rise from the\nearth. I will go the rounds; come with me, Captain Muriel. Colonel, I\norder you to your tent; you are a veteran--the only one among us, at\nleast on the staff, who was wounded at Aspromonte.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 52\n\n\nThe life of Lothair had been so strange and exciting since he quitted\nMuriel Towers that he had found little time for that reflection in which\nhe was once so prone to indulge. Perhaps he shrank from it. If he wanted\nan easy distraction from self--criticism it may be a convenient refuge\nfrom the scruples, or even the pangs, of conscience--it was profusely\nsupplied by the startling affairs of which he formed a part, the\nsingular characters with whom he was placed in contact, the risk and\nresponsibility which seemed suddenly to have encompassed him with their\never-stimulating influence, and, lastly, by the novelty of foreign\ntravel, which, even under ordinary circumstances, has a tendency to\nrouse and stir up even ordinary men.\n\nSo long as Theodora was his companion in their counsels, and he was\nlistening to her deep plans and daring suggestions, enforced by that\ncalm enthusiasm which was not the least powerful of her commanding\nspells, it is not perhaps surprising that he should have yielded without\nan effort to her bewitching ascendancy. But when they had separated, and\nshe had embarked on that perilous enterprise of personally conferring\nwith the chiefs of those secret societies of France, which had been\nfancifully baptized by her popular name, and had nurtured her tradition\nas a religious faith, it might have been supposed that Lothair, left to\nhimself, might have recurred to the earlier sentiments of his youth. But\nhe was not left to himself. He was left with her injunctions, and\nthe spirit of the oracle, though the divinity was no longer visible,\npervaded his mind and life.\n\nLothair was to accompany the general as one of his aides-de-camp, and\nhe was to meet Theodora again on what was contemplated as the field\nof memorable actions. Theodora had wisely calculated on the influence,\nbeneficial in her view, which the character of a man like the general\nwould exercise over Lothair. This consummate military leader, though he\nhad pursued a daring career, and was a man of strong convictions, was\ndistinguished by an almost unerring judgment, and a mastery of method\nrarely surpassed. Though he was without imagination or sentiment, there\nwere occasions on which he had shown he was not deficient in a becoming\nsympathy, and he had a rapid and correct perception of character. He was\na thoroughly honest man, and, in the course of a life of great trial and\nvicissitude, even envenomed foes had never impeached his pure integrity.\nFor the rest, he was unselfish, but severe in discipline, inflexible,\nand even ruthless in the fulfilment of his purpose. A certain simplicity\nof speech and conduct, and a disinterestedness which, even in little\nthings, was constantly exhibiting itself, gave to his character even\ncharm, and rendered personal intercourse with him highly agreeable.\n\nIn the countless arrangements which had to be made, Lothair was never\nwearied in recognizing and admiring the prescience and precision of his\nchief; and when the day had died, and for a moment they had ceased from\ntheir labors, or were travelling together, often through the night,\nLothair found in the conversation of his companion, artless and\nunrestrained, a wonderful fund of knowledge both of men and things, and\nthat, too, in very different climes and countries.\n\nThe camp in the Apennines was not favorable to useless reverie. Lothair\nfound unceasing and deeply-interesting occupation in his numerous and\nnovel duties; and, if his thoughts for a moment wandered beyond the\nbarren peaks around him, they were attracted and engrossed by one\nsubject--and that was, naturally, Theodora. From her they had\nheard nothing since her departure, except a mysterious, though not\ndiscouraging, telegram which was given to them by Colonel Campian when\nhe had joined them at Florence. It was difficult not to feel anxious\nabout her, though the general would never admit the possibility of her\npersonal danger.\n\nIn this state of affairs, a week having elapsed since his arrival at\nthe camp, Lothair, who had been visiting the outposts, was summoned one\nmorning by an orderly to the tent of the general. That personage was\non his legs when Lothair entered it, and was dictating to an officer\nwriting at a table.\n\n\"You ought to know my military secretary,\" said the general, as Lothair\nentered, \"and therefore I will introduce you.\"\n\nLothair was commencing a suitable reverence of recognition as the\nsecretary raised his head to receive it, when he suddenly stopped,\nchanged color, and for a moment seemed to lose himself, and then\nmurmured, \"Is it possible?\"\n\nIt was indeed Theodora: clothed in male attire, she seemed a stripling.\n\n\"Quite possible,\" she said, \"and all is well. But I found it a longer\nbusiness than I had counted on. You see, there are so many new persons\nwho knew me only by tradition, but with whom it was necessary I should\npersonally confer. And I had more difficulty, just now, in getting\nthrough Florence than I had anticipated. The Papalini and the French\nare both worrying our allies in that city about the gathering on the\nsouthern frontier, and there is a sort of examination, true or false, I\nwill not aver, of all who depart. However, I managed to pass with some\nsoldiers' wives who were carrying fruit as far as Narni, and there I met\nan old comrade of Aspromonte, who is a custom-officer now, but true\nto the good cause, and he, and his daughter, who is with me, helped me\nthrough every thing, and so I am with my dear friends again.\"\n\nAfter some slight conversation in this vein, Theodora entered into a\ndetailed narrative of her proceedings, and gave to them her views of the\ncondition of affairs.\n\n\"By one thing, above all others,\" she said, \"I am impressed, and that\nis, the unprecedented efforts which Rome is making to obtain the return\nof the French. There never was such influence exercised, such distinct\noffers made, such prospects intimated. You may prepare yourself for any\nthing; a papal coronation, a family pontiff--I could hardly say a King\nof Rome, though he has been reminded of that royal fact. Our friends\nhave acted with equal energy and with perfect temper. The heads of the\nsocieties have met in council, and resolved that, if France will refuse\nto interfere, no domestic disturbance shall be attempted during this\nreign, and they have communicated this resolution to headquarters. He\ntrusts them; he knows they are honest men. They did something like this\nbefore the Italian War, when he hesitated about heading the army from\nthe fear of domestic revolution. Anxious to recover the freedom of\nItaly, they apprized him that, if he personally entered the field,\nthey would undertake to insure tranquillity at home. The engagement was\nscrupulously fulfilled. When I left Paris all looked well, but affairs\nrequire the utmost vigilance and courage. It is a mighty struggle; it\nis a struggle between the Church and the secret societies; and it is a\ndeath-struggle.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 53\n\n\nDuring the week that elapsed after the arrival of Theodora at the camp,\nmany recruits, and considerable supplies of military stores, reached\nthe valley. Theodora really acted as secretary to the general, and her\nlabors were not light. Though Lothair was frequently in her presence,\nthey were, never, or rarely, alone, and, when they conversed together,\nher talk was of details. The scouts, too, had brought information, which\nmight have been expected, that their rendezvous was no longer a secret\nat Rome. The garrison of the neighboring town of Viterbo had, therefore,\nbeen increased, and there was even the commencement of an intrenched\ncamp in the vicinity of that place, to be garrisoned by a detachment\nof the legion of Antibes and other good troops, so that any junction\nbetween the general and Garibaldi, if contemplated, should not be easily\neffected.\n\nIn the mean time, the life of the camp was busy. The daily drill and\nexercise of two thousand men was not a slight affair, and the constant\nchanges in orders which the arrival of bodies of recruits occasioned,\nrendered this primary duty more difficult; the office of quartermaster\nrequired the utmost resource and temper; the commissariat, which, from\nthe nature of the country, could depend little upon forage, demanded\nextreme husbandry and forbearance. But, perhaps, no labors were more\nsevere than those of the armorers, the clink of whose instruments\nresounded unceasingly in the valley. And yet such is the magic of\nmethod, when directed by a master-mind, that the whole went on with the\nregularity and precision of machinery. More than two thousand armed\nmen, all of whom had been accustomed to an irregular, some to a lawless,\nlife, were as docile as children; animated, in general, by what they\ndeemed a sacred cause, and led by a chief whom they universally alike\nadored and feared.\n\nAmong these wild warriors, Theodora, delicate and fragile, but with a\nmien of majesty, moved, like the spirit of some other world, and was\nviewed by them with admiration not unmixed with awe. Veterans round\nthe camp-fire, had told to the new recruits her deeds of prowess\nand devotion; how triumphantly she had charged at Voltorno, and how\nheroically she had borne their standard when they were betrayed at fatal\nAspromonte.\n\nThe sun had sunk behind the mountains, but was still high in the\nwestern heaven, when a mounted lancer was observed descending a distant\npass into the valley. The general and his staff had not long commenced\ntheir principal meal of the day, of which the disappearance of the sun\nbehind the peak was the accustomed signal. This permitted them, without\ninconvenience, to take their simple repast in the open, but still warm,\nair. Theodora was seated between the general and her husband, and her\neye was the first that caught the figure of the distant but descending\nstranger.\n\n\"What is that?\" she asked.\n\nThe general, immediately using his telescope, after a moment's\nexamination, said: \"A lancer of the royal guard.\"\n\nAll eyes were now fixed upon the movements of the horseman. He had\ndescended the winding steep, and now was tracking the craggy path which\nled into the plain. As he reached the precinct of the camp, he was\nchallenged, but not detained. Nearer and nearer he approached, and it\nwas evident, from his uniform, that the conjecture of his character by\nthe general was correct.\n\n\"A deserter from the guard,\" whispered Colonel Campian, to Lothair.\n\nThe horseman wag conducted by an officer to the presence of the\ncommander. When that presence was reached, the lancer, still silent,\nslowly lowered his tall weapon, and offered the general the dispatch\nwhich was fastened to the head of his spear.\n\nEvery eye was on the countenance of their chief as he perused the\nmissive, but that countenance was always inscrutable. It was observed,\nhowever, that he read the paper twice. Looking up, the general said, to\nthe officer: \"See that the bearer is well quartered.--This is for you,\"\nhe added in a low voice to Theodora, and he gave her an enclosure; \"read\nit quietly, and then come into my tent.\"\n\nTheodora read the letter, and quietly; though, without the preparatory\nhint, it might have been difficult to have concealed her emotion.\nThen, after a short pause, she rose, and the general, requesting his\ncompanions not to disturb themselves, joined her, and they proceeded in\nsilence to his tent.\n\n\"He is arrested,\" said the general when they had entered it, \"and taken\nto Alessandria, where he is a close prisoner. 'Tis a blow, but I am more\ngrieved than surprised.\"\n\nThis was the arrest of Garibaldi at Sinigaglia by the Italian\ngovernment, which had been communicated at Hexham House to Monsignore\nBerwick by his evening visitor.\n\n\"How will it affect operations in the field?\" inquired Theodora.\n\n\"According to this dispatch, in no degree. Our original plan is to be\npursued, and acted upon the moment we are ready. That should be in a\nfortnight, or perhaps three weeks. Menotti is to take the command on the\nsouthern frontier. Well, it may prevent jealousies. I think I shall send\nSarano there to reconnoitre; he is well both with Nicotera and Ghirelli,\nand may keep things straight.\"\n\n\"But there are other affairs besides operations in the field,\" said\nTheodora, \"and scarcely less critical. Read this,\" and she gave him the\nenclosure, which ran in these words:\n\n\"The general will tell thee what has happened. Have no fear for that.\nAll will go right. It will not alter our plans a bunch of grapes. Be\nperfectly easy about this country. No Italian soldier will ever cross\nthe frontier except to combat the French. Write that on thy heart. Are\nother things as well? Other places? My advices are bad. All the prelates\nare on their knees to him--with blessings on their lips and curses\nin their pockets. Archbishop of Paris is as bad as any. Berwick is at\nBiarritz--an inexhaustible intriguer; the only priest I fear. I hear\nfrom one who never misled me that the Polhes brigade has orders to be\nin readiness. The Mary-Anne societies are not strong enough for the\nsituation--too local; he listens to them, but he has given no pledge.\nWe must go deeper. 'Tis an affair of 'Madre Natura.' Thou must see\nColonna.\"\n\n\"Colonna is at Rome,\" said the general, \"and cannot be spared. He is\nacting president of the National Committee, and has enough upon his\nhands.\"\n\n\"I must see him,\" said Theodora.\n\n\"I had hoped I had heard the last of the 'Madre Natura,'\" said the\ngeneral with an air of discontent.\n\n\"And the Neapolitans hope they have heard the last of the eruptions\nof their mountain,\" said Theodora; \"but the necessities of things are\nsterner stuff than the hopes of men.\"\n\n\"Its last effort appalled and outraged Europe,\" said the general.\n\n\"Its last effort forced the French into Italy, and has freed the country\nfrom the Alps to the Adriatic,\" rejoined Theodora.\n\n\"If the great man had only been as quiet as we have been,\" said the\ngeneral, lighting a cigar, \"we might have been in Rome by this time.\"\n\n\"If the great man had been quiet, we should not have had a volunteer in\nour valley,\" said Theodora. \"My faith in him is implicit; he has been\nright in every thing, and has never failed except when he has been\nbetrayed. I see no hope for Rome except in his convictions and energy.\nI do not wish to die, and feel I have devoted my life only to secure\nthe triumph of Savoyards who have sold their own country, and of priests\nwhose impostures have degraded mine.\"\n\n\"Ah! those priests!\" exclaimed the general. \"I really do not much care\nfor any thing else. They say the Savoyard is not a bad comrade, and at\nany rate he can charge like a soldier. But those priests? I fluttered\nthem once! Why did I spare any? Why did I not burn down St. Peter's? I\nproposed it, but Mirandola, with his history and his love of art and all\nthat old furniture, would reserve it for a temple of the true God and\nfor the glory of Europe! Fine results we have accomplished! And now\nwe are here, hardly knowing where we are, and, as it appears, hardly\nknowing what to do.\"\n\n\"Not so, dear general,\" said Theodora. \"Where we are is the threshold\nof Rome, and if we are wise we shall soon cross it. This arrest of our\ngreat friend is a misfortune, but not an irredeemable one. I thoroughly\ncredit what he says about the Italian troops. Rest assured he knows what\nhe is talking about; they will never cross the frontier against us. The\ndanger is from another land. But there will be no peril if we are prompt\nand firm. Clear your mind of all these dark feelings about the 'Madre\nNatura.' All that we require is that the most powerful and the most\nsecret association in Europe should ratify what the local societies of\nFrance have already intimated. It will be enough. Send for Colonna, and\nleave the rest to me.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 54\n\n\nThe \"Madre Natura\" is the oldest, the most powerful, and the most\noccult, of the secret societies of Italy. Its mythic origin reaches the\nera of paganism, and it is not impossible that it may have been founded\nby some of the despoiled professors of the ancient faith. As time\nadvanced, the brotherhood assumed many outward forms, according to the\nvarying spirit of the age: sometimes they were freemasons, sometimes\nthey were soldiers, sometimes artists, sometimes men of letters. But\nwhether their external representation were a lodge, a commandery, a\nstudio, or an academy, their inward purpose was ever the same; and that\nwas to cherish the memory, and, if possible, to secure the restoration\nof the Roman Republic, and to expel from the Aryan settlement of Romulus\nthe creeds and sovereignty of what they styled the Semitic invasion.\n\nThe \"Madre Natura\" have a tradition that one of the most celebrated of\nthe popes was admitted to their fraternity as Cardinal del Medici, and\nthat when he ascended the throne, mainly through their labors, he\nwas called upon to cooperate in the fulfilment of the great idea. An\nindividual who, in his youth, has been the member of a secret society,\nand subsequently ascends a throne, may find himself in an embarrassing\nposition. This, however, according to the tradition, which there is\nsome documentary ground to accredit, was not the perplexing lot of his\nholiness Pope Leo X. His tastes and convictions were in entire unison\nwith his early engagements, and it is believed that he took an early and\nno unwilling opportunity of submitting to the conclave a proposition to\nconsider whether it were not both expedient and practicable to return to\nthe ancient faith, for which their temples had been originally erected.\n\nThe chief tenet of the society of \"Madre Natura\" is denoted by its name.\nThey could conceive nothing more benignant and more beautiful, more\nprovident and more powerful, more essentially divine, than that system\nof creative order to which they owed their being, and in which it\nwas their privilege to exist. But they differed from other schools of\nphilosophy that have held this faith, in this singular particular:\nthey recognize the inability of the Latin race to pursue the worship of\nNature in an abstract spirit, and they desired to revive those exquisite\npersonifications of the abounding qualities of the mighty mother which\nthe Aryan genius had bequeathed to the admiration of man. Parthenope was\nagain to rule at Naples instead of Januarius, and starveling saints and\nwinking madonnas were to restore their usurped altars to the god of the\nsilver bow and the radiant daughter of the foaming wave.\n\nAlthough the society of \"Madre Natura\" themselves accepted the\nallegorical interpretation which the Neo-Platonists had placed upon\nthe pagan creeds during the first ages of Christianity, they could\nnot suppose that the populace could ever comprehend an exposition so\nrefined, not to say so fanciful. They guarded, therefore, against the\ncorruptions and abuses of the religion of Nature by the entire abolition\nof the priestly order, and in the principle that every man should be his\nown priest they believed they had found the necessary security.\n\nAs it was evident that the arrest of Garibaldi could not be kept secret,\nthe general thought it most prudent to be himself the herald of its\noccurrence, which he announced to the troops in a manner as little\ndiscouraging as he could devise. It was difficult to extenuate the\nconsequences of so great a blow, but they were assured that it was not a\ncatastrophe, and would not in the slightest degree affect the execution\nof the plans previously resolved on. Two or three days later some\nincrease of confidence was occasioned by the authentic intelligence that\nGaribaldi had been removed from his stern imprisonment at Alessandria,\nand conveyed to his island-home, Caprera, though still a prisoner.\n\nAbout this time, the general said to Lothair: \"My secretary has occasion\nto go on an expedition. I shall send a small detachment of cavalry with\nher, and you will be at its head. She has requested that her husband\nshould have this office, but that is impossible; I cannot spare my best\nofficer. It is your first command, and, though I hope it will involve no\ngreat difficulty, there is no command that does not require courage and\ndiscretion. The distance is not very great, and so long as you are in\nthe mountains you will probably be safe; but in leaving this range and\ngaining the southern Apennines, which is your point of arrival, you will\nhave to cross the open country. I do not hear the Papalini are in force\nthere; I believe they have concentrated themselves at Rome, and about\nViterbo. If you meet any scouts and reconnoitring parties, you will be\nable to give a good account of them, and probably they will be as little\nanxious to encounter you as you to meet them. But we must be prepared\nfor every thing, and you may be threatened by the enemy in force;\nin that case you will cross the Italian frontier, in the immediate\nneighborhood of which you will keep during the passage of the open\ncountry, and surrender yourselves and your arms to the authorities. They\nwill not be very severe; but, at whatever cost and whatever may be the\nodds, Theodora must never be a prisoner to the Papalini. You will depart\nto-morrow at dawn.\"\n\nThere is nothing so animating, so invigorating alike to the body and\nsoul, so truly delicious, as travelling among mountains in the early\nhours of day. The freshness of Nature falls upon a responsive frame,\nand the nobility of the scene discards the petty thoughts that pester\nordinary life. So felt Captain Muriel, as with every military precaution\nhe conducted his little troop and his precious charge among the winding\npasses of the Apennines; at first dim in the matin twilight, then soft\nwith incipient day, then coruscating with golden flashes. Sometimes\nthey descended from the austere heights into the sylvan intricacies\nof chestnut-forests, amid the rush of waters and the fragrant stir of\nancient trees; and, then again ascending to lofty summits, ranges of\ninterminable hills, gray or green, expanded before them, with ever and\nanon a glimpse of plains, and sometimes the splendor and the odor of the\nsea.\n\nTheodora rode a mule, which had been presented to the general by\nsome admirer. It was an animal of remarkable beauty and intelligence,\nperfectly aware, apparently, of the importance of its present trust, and\nproud of its rich accoutrements, its padded saddle of crimson velvet,\nand its silver bells. A couple of troopers formed the advanced guard,\nand the same number at a certain distance furnished the rear. The body\nof the detachment, fifteen strong, with the sumpter-mules, generally\nfollowed Theodora, by whose side, whenever the way permitted, rode their\ncommander. Since he left England Lothair had never been so much with\nTheodora. What struck him most now, as indeed previously at the camp,\nwas that she never alluded to the past. For her there would seem to be\nno Muriel Towers, no Belmont, no England. You would have supposed that\nshe had been born in the Apennines and had never quitted them. All her\nconversation was details, political or military. Not that her manner\nwas changed to Lothair. It was not only as kind as before, but it was\nsometimes unusually and even unnecessary tender, as if she reproached\nherself for the too frequent and too evident self-engrossment of her\nthoughts, and wished to intimate to him that, though her brain were\nabsorbed, her heart was still gentle and true.\n\nTwo hours after noon they halted in a green nook, near a beautiful\ncascade that descended in a mist down a sylvan cleft, and poured its\npellucid stream, for their delightful use, into a natural basin of\nmarble. The men picketed their horses, and their corporal, who was a man\nof the country and their guide, distributed their rations. All vied with\neach other in administering to the comfort and convenience of Theodora,\nand Lothair hovered about her as a bee about a flower, but she was\nsilent, which he wished to impute to fatigue. But she said she was not\nat all fatigued, indeed quite fresh. Before they resumed their\njourney he could not refrain from observing on the beauty of their\nresting-place. She assented with a pleasing nod, and then resuming\nher accustomed abstraction she said: \"The more I think, the more I am\nconvinced that the battle is not to be fought in this country, but in\nFrance.\"\n\nAfter one more ascent, and that comparatively a gentle one, it was\nevident that they were gradually emerging from the mountainous region.\nTheir course since their halting lay through a spur of the chief chain\nthey had hitherto pursued, and a little after sunset they arrived at\na farm-house, which the corporal informed his captain was the intended\nquarter of Theodora for the night, as the horses could proceed no\nfarther without rest. At dawn they were to resume their way, and soon to\ncross the open country, where danger, if any, was to be anticipated.\n\nThe farmer was frightened when he was summoned from his house by a party\nof armed men; but having some good ducats given him in advance, and\nbeing assured they were all Christians, he took heart and labored to do\nwhat they desired. Theodora duly found herself in becoming quarters, and\na sentry was mounted at her residence. The troopers, who had been quite\ncontent to wrap themselves in their cloaks and pass the night in\nthe air, were pleased to find no despicable accommodation in the\nout-buildings of the farm, and still more with the proffered vintage of\ntheir host. As for Lothair, he enveloped himself in his mantle and threw\nhimself on a bed of sacks, with a truss of Indian corn for his pillow,\nand, though he began by musing over Theodora, in a few minutes he was\nimmersed in that profound and dreamless sleep which a life of action and\nmountain-air combined can alone secure.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 55\n\n\nThe open country extending from the Apennines to the very gates of\nRome, and which they had now to cross, was in general a desert; a plain\nclothed with a coarse vegetation, and undulating with an interminable\nseries of low and uncouth mounds, without any of the grace of form which\nalways attends the disposition of Nature. Nature had not created them.\nThey were the offspring of man and time, and of their rival powers of\ndestruction. Ages of civilization were engulfed in this drear expanse.\nThey were the tombs of empires and the sepulchres of contending races.\nThe Campagna proper has at least the grace of aqueducts to break its\nmonotony, and everywhere the cerulean spell of distance; but in this\ngrim solitude antiquity has left only the memory of its violence and\ncrimes, and nothing is beautiful except the sky.\n\nThe orders of the general to direct their course as much as possible\nin the vicinity of the Italian frontier, though it lengthened their\njourney, somewhat mitigated its dreariness, and an hour after noon,\nafter traversing some flinty fields, they observed in the distance an\nolive-wood, beneath the pale shade of which, and among whose twisted\nbranches and contorted roots, they had contemplated finding a\nhalting-place. But here the advanced guard observed already an\nencampment, and one of them rode back to report the discovery.\n\nA needless alarm; for, after a due reconnoissance, they were ascertained\nto be friends--a band of patriots about to join the general in his\nencampment among the mountains. They reported that a division of the\nItalian army was assembled in force upon the frontier, but that several\nregiments had already signified to their commanders that they would not\nfight against Garibaldi or his friends. They confirmed also the news\nthat the great leader himself was a prisoner at Caprera; that, although,\nhis son Menotti by his command had withdrawn from Nerola, his force\nwas really increased by the junction of Ghirelli and the Roman legion,\ntwelve hundred strong, and that five hundred riflemen would join the\ngeneral in the course of the week.\n\nA little before sunset they had completed the passage of the open\ncountry, and had entered the opposite branch of the Apennines, which\nthey had long observed in the distance. After wandering among some rocky\nground, they entered a defile amid hills covered with ilex, and thence\nemerging found themselves in a valley of some expanse and considerable\ncultivation; bright crops, vineyards in which the vine was married to\nthe elm, orchards full of fruit, and groves of olive; in the distance\nblue hills that were becoming dark in the twilight, and in the centre of\nthe plain, upon a gentle and wooded elevation, a vast file of building,\nthe exact character of which at this hour it was difficult to recognize,\nfor, even as Theodora mentioned to Lothair that they now beheld the\nobject of their journey, the twilight seemed to vanish and the stars\nglistened in the dark heavens.\n\nThough the building seemed so near, it was yet a considerable time\nbefore they reached the wooded hill, and, though its ascent was easy,\nit was night before they halted in face of a huge gate flanked by high\nstone walls. A single light in one of the windows of the vast pile which\nit enclosed was the only evidence of human habitation.\n\nThe corporal sounded a bugle, and immediately the light moved and noises\nwere heard--the opening of the hall-doors, and then the sudden flame of\ntorches, and the advent of many feet. The great gate slowly opened,\nand a steward and several serving-men appeared. The steward addressed\nTheodora and Lothair, and invited them to dismount and enter what now\nappeared to be a garden with statues and terraces and fountains and\nrows of cypress, its infinite dilapidation not being recognizable in\nthe deceptive hour; and he informed the escort that their quarters were\nprepared for them, to which they were at once attended. Guiding their\ncaptain and his charge, they soon approached a double flight of steps,\nand, ascending, reached the main terrace from which the building\nimmediately rose. It was, in truth, a castle of the middle ages, on\nwhich a Roman prince, at the commencement of the last century, had\nengrafted the character of one of those vast and ornate villas then\nthe mode, but its original character still asserted itself, and,\nnotwithstanding its Tuscan basement and its Ionic pilasters, its rich\npediments and delicate volutes, in the distant landscape it still seemed\na fortress in the commanding position which became the residence of a\nfeudal chief.\n\nThey entered, through a Palladian vestibule, a hall which they felt\nmust be of huge dimensions, though with the aid of a single torch it was\nimpossible to trace its limits, either of extent or of elevation. Then\nbowing before them, and lighting as it were their immediate steps, the\nsteward guided them down a long and lofty corridor, which led to the\nentrance of several chambers, all vast, with little furniture, but their\nwells covered with pictures. At length he opened a door and ushered them\ninto a saloon, which was in itself bright and glowing, but of which the\nlively air was heightened by its contrast with the preceding scene. It\nwas lofty, and hung with faded satin in gilded panels still bright. An\nancient chandelier of Venetian crystal hung illumined from the painted\nceiling, and on the silver dogs of the marble hearth a fresh block of\ncedar had just been thrown and blazed with aromatic light.\n\nA lady came forward and embraced Theodora, and then greeted Lothair with\ncordiality. \"We must dine to-day even later than you do in London,\"\nsaid the Princess of Tivoli, \"but we have been expecting you these two\nhours.\" Then she drew Theodora aside, and said, \"He is here; but\nyou must be tired, my best beloved. As some wise man said: 'Business\nto-morrow.'\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said Theodora; \"now, now,--I am never tired. The only thing\nthat exhausts me is suspense.\"\n\n\"It shall be so. At present I will take you away to shake the dust off\nyour armor, and, Serafino, attend to Captain Muriel.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 56\n\n\nWhen they assembled again in the saloon there was an addition to their\nparty in the person of a gentleman of distinguished appearance. His age\ncould hardly have much exceeded that of thirty, but time had agitated\nhis truly Roman countenance, one which we now find only in consular\nand imperial busts, or in the chance visage of a Roman shepherd or a\nNeapolitan bandit. He was a shade above the middle height, with a\nframe of well-knit symmetry. His proud head was proudly placed on broad\nshoulders, and neither time nor indulgence had marred his slender\nwaist. His dark-brown hair was short and hyacinthine, close to his white\nforehead, and naturally showing his small ears. He wore no whiskers, and\nhis mustache was limited to the centre of his upper lip.\n\nWhen Theodora entered and offered him her hand he pressed it to his lips\nwith gravity and proud homage, and then their hostess said: \"Captain\nMuriel, let me present you to a prince who will not bear his titles, and\nwhom, therefore, I must call by his name--Romolo Colonna.\"\n\nThe large folding-doors, richly painted and gilt, though dim from\nneglect and time, and sustained by columns of precious marbles, were\nsuddenly opened and revealed another saloon, in which was a round table\nbrightly lighted, and to which the princess invited her friends.\n\nTheir conversation at dinner was lively and sustained; the travels of\nthe last two days formed a natural part and were apposite to commence\nwith, but they were soon engrossed in the great subject of their lives;\nand Colonna, who had left Rome only four-and-twenty hours, gave them\ninteresting details of the critical condition of that capital. When the\nrepast was concluded the princess rose, and, accompanied by Lothair,\nreentered the saloon, but Theodora and Colonna lingered behind, and,\nfinally seating themselves at the farthest end of the apartment in which\nthey had dined, became engaged in earnest conversation.\n\n\"You have seen a great deal since we first met at Belmont,\" said the\nprincess to Lothair.\n\n\"It seems to me now,\" said Lothair, \"that I knew as much of life then as\nI did of the stars above us, about whose purposes and fortunes I used to\npuzzle myself.\"\n\n\"And might have remained in that ignorance. The great majority of men\nexist but do not live--like Italy in the last century. The power of\nthe passions, the force of the will, the creative energy of the\nimagination--these make life, and reveal to us a world of which the\nmillion are entirely ignorant You have been fortunate in your youth\nto have become acquainted with a great woman. It develops all a man's\npowers, and gives him a thousand talents.\"\n\n\"I often think,\" said Lothair, \"that I have neither powers nor talents,\nbut am, drifting without an orbit.\"\n\n\"Into infinite space,\" said the priestess. \"Well, one might do worse\nthan that. But it is not so. In the long-run your nature will prevail,\nand you will fulfil your organic purpose; but you will accomplish your\nends with a completeness which can only be secured by the culture and\ndevelopment you are now experiencing.\"\n\n\"And what is my nature?\" said Lothair. \"I wish you would tell me.\"\n\n\"Has not the divine Theodora told you?\"\n\n\"She has told me many things, but not that.\"\n\n\"How, then, could I know,\" said the princess, \"if she has not discovered\nit?\"\n\n\"But perhaps she has discovered it,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"Oh! then she would tell you,\" said the princess, \"for she is the soul\nof truth.\"\n\n\"But she is also the soul of kindness, and she might wish to spare my\nfeelings.\"\n\n\"Well, that is very modest, and I dare say not affected. For there is no\nman, however gifted, even however conceited, who has any real confidence\nin himself until he has acted.\"\n\n\"Well, we shall soon act,\" said Lothair, \"and then I. suppose I shall\nknow my nature.\"\n\n\"In time,\" said the princess, \"and with the continued inspiration of\nfriendship.\"\n\n\"But you too are a great friend of Theodora?\"\n\n\"Although a woman. I see you are laughing at female friendships, and,\ngenerally speaking, there is foundation for the general sneer. I will\nown, for my part, I have every female weakness, and in excess. I\nam vain, I am curious, I am jealous, and I am envious; but I adore\nTheodora. I reconcile my feelings toward her and my disposition in this\nway. It is not friendship--it is worship. And indeed there are moments\nwhen I sometimes think she is one of those beautiful divinities that\nwe once worshipped in this land, and who, when they listened to our\nprayers, at least vouchsafed that our country should not be the terrible\nwilderness that you crossed this day.\"\n\nIn the mean time Colonna, with folded arms and eyes fixed on the ground,\nwas listening to Theodora.\n\n\"Thus you see,\" she continued, \"it comes to this--Rome can only be freed\nby the Romans. He looks upon the secret societies of his own country as\nhe does upon universal suffrage--a wild beast, and dangerous, but which\nmay be watched and tamed and managed by the police. He listens, but he\nplays with them. He temporizes. At the bottom of his heart, his Italian\nblood despises the Gauls. It must be something deeper and more touching\nthan this. Rome must appeal to him, and in the ineffable name.\"\n\n\"It has been uttered before,\" said Colonna, looking up at his companion,\n\"and--\" And he hesitated.\n\n\"And in vain you would say,\" said Theodora. \"Not so. There was a\nmartyrdom, but the blood of Felice baptized the new birth of Italian\nlife. But I am not thinking of bloodshed. Had it not been for the double\nintrigues of the Savoyards it need not then have been shed. We bear him\nno ill-will--at least not now--and we can make great offers. Make them.\nThe revolution in Gaul is ever a mimicry of Italian thought and life.\nTheir great affair of the last century, which they have so marred and\nmuddied, would never have occurred had it not been for Tuscan reform;\n1848 was the echo of our societies; and the Seine will never be\ndisturbed if the Tiber flows unruffled. Let him consent to Roman\nfreedom, and 'Madre Natura' will guarantee him against Lutetian\nbarricades.\"\n\n\"It is only the offer of Mary-Anne in another form,\" said Colonna.\n\n\"Guarantee the dynasty,\" said Theodora. \"There is the point. He can\ntrust us. Emperors and kings break treaties without remorse, but he\nknows that what is registered by the most ancient power in the world is\nsacred.\"\n\n\"'Can republicans guarantee dynasties?\" said Colonna, shaking his head.\n\n\"Why, what is a dynasty, when we are dealing with eternal things?\nThe casualties of life compared with infinite space? Rome is eternal.\nCenturies of the most degrading and foreign priestcraft--enervating\nrites brought in by Hellogabalus and the Syrian emperors--have failed\nto destroy her. Dynasties! Why, even in our dark servitude we have\nseen Merovingian and Carlovingian kings, and Capets, and Valois, and\nBourbons, and now Bonapartes. They have disappeared, and will disappear\nlike Orgetorix and the dynasties of the time of Caesar. What we want is\nRome free. Do not you see that everything has been preparing for that\nevent? This monstrous masquerade of United Italy--what is it but an\ninitiatory ceremony, to prove that Italy without Rome is a series of\nprovinces? Establish the Roman republic, and the Roman race will, as\nbefore, conquer them in detail. And, when the Italians are thus really\nunited, what will become of the Gauls? Why, the first Bonaparte said\nthat if Italy were really united the Gauls would have no chance. And he\nwas a good judge of such things.\"\n\n\"What would you have me do, then?\" said Colonna.\n\n\"See him--see him at once. Say every thing that I have said, and say\nit better. His disposition is with us. Convenience, all political\npropriety, counsel and would justify his abstinence. A return to Rome\nwould seem weak, fitful, capricious, and would prove that his previous\nretirement was ill-considered and ill-informed. It would disturb and\nalarm Europe. But you have, nevertheless, to fight against great odds.\nIt is 'Madre Natura' against St. Peter's. Never was the abomination of\nthe world so active as at present. It is in the very throes of its fell\ndespair. To save itself it would poison in the Eucharist.\"\n\n\"And if I fail?\" said Colonna.\n\n\"You will not fail. On the whole, his interest lies on our side.\"\n\n\"The sacerdotal influences are very strong there. When the calculation\nof interest is fine, a word, a glance, sometimes a sigh, a tear, may\nhave a fatal effect.\"\n\n\"All depends upon him,\" said Theodora. \"If he were to disappear from the\nstage, interference would be impossible.\"\n\n\"But he is on the stage, and apparently will remain.\"\n\n\"A single life should not stand between Rome and freedom.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean that Romolo Colonna should go to Paris and free his country.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 57\n\n\nWhen Captain Muriel and his detachment returned to the camp, they found\nthat the force had been not inconsiderably increased in their absence,\nwhile the tidings of the disposition of the Italian army brought by the\nrecruits and the deserters from the royal standard, cherished the hopes\nof the troops, and stimulated their desire for action. Theodora had been\nfar more communicative during their journey back than in that of her\ndeparture. She was less absorbed, and had resumed that serene yet even\nsympathizing character which was one of her charms. Without going into\ndetail, she mentioned more than once to Lothair how relieved she felt\nby Colonna accepting the mission to Paris. He was a person of so much\ninfluence, she said, and of such great judgment and resource. She\naugured the most satisfactory results from his presence on the main\nscene of action.\n\nTime passed rapidly at the camp. When a life of constant activity\nis combined with routine, the hours fly. Neither letter nor telegram\narrived from Colonna, and neither was expected; and yet. Theodora heard\nfrom him, and even favorably. One day, as she was going the rounds\nwith her husband, a young soldier, a new recruit, approached her, and,\npressing to his lips a branch of the olive-tree, presented it to her.\nOn another occasion when she returned to her tent, she found a bunch of\nfruit from the same tree, though not quite ripe, which showed that the\ncause of peace had not only progressed but had almost matured. All these\ncommunications sustained her sanguine disposition, and, full of happy\nconfidence, she labored with unceasing and inspiring energy, so that\nwhen the looked-for signal came they might be prepared to obey it; and\nrapidly gather the rich fruition of their glorious hopes.\n\nWhile she was in this mood of mind, a scout arrived from Nerola,\nbringing news that a brigade of the French army had positively embarked\nat Marseilles, and might be hourly expected at Civita Vecchia. The news\nwas absolute. The Italian consul at Marseilles had telegraphed to his\ngovernment both when the first regiment was on board and when the last\nhad embarked. Copies of these telegrams had been forwarded instantly by\na secret friend to the volunteers on the southern frontier.\n\nWhen Theodora heard this news she said nothing, but, turning pale, she\nquitted the group round the general and hastened to her own tent. She\ntold her attendant, the daughter of the custom-house officer at Narni,\nand a true child of the mountains, that no one must approach her, not\neven Colonel Campian, and the girl sat without the tent at its entrance,\ndressed in her many-colored garments, with fiery eyes and square white\nteeth, and her dark hair braided with gold coins and covered with a long\nwhite kerchief of perfect cleanliness; and she had a poniard at her side\nand a revolver in her hand, and she would have used both weapons sooner\nthan that her mistress should be disobeyed.\n\nAlone in her tent, Theodora fell upon her knees, and, lifting up her\nhands to heaven and bowing her head to the earth, she said: \"O God! whom\nI have ever worshipped, God of justice and of truth, receive the agony\nof my soul!\"\n\nAnd on the earth she remained for hours in despair.\n\nNight came, and it brought no solace, and the day returned, but to her\nit brought no light. Theodora was no longer seen. The soul of the camp\nseemed extinct. The mien of majesty that ennobled all; the winning smile\nthat rewarded the rifleman at his practice and the sapper at his toil;\nthe inciting word that reanimated the recruit and recalled to the\nveteran the glories of Sicilian struggles--all vanished--all seemed\nspiritless and dull, and the armorer clinked his forge as if he were the\nheartless hireling of a king.\n\nIn this state of moral discomfiture there was one person who did not\nlose his head, and this was the general. Calm, collected, and critical,\nhe surveyed the situation and indicated the possible contingencies.\n\"Our best, if not our only, chance,\" he said to Colonel Campian, \"is\nthis--that the Italian army now gathered in force upon the frontier\nshould march to Rome and arrive there before the French. Whatever then\nhappens, we shall at least get rid of the great imposture, but in all\nprobability the French and Italians will fight. In that case I shall\njoin the Savoyards, and in the confusion we may do some business yet.\"\n\n\"This embarkation,\" said the colonel, \"explains the gathering of\nthe Italians on the frontier. They must have foreseen this event at\nFlorence. They never can submit to another French occupation. It would\nupset their throne. The question is, who will be at Rome first.\"\n\n\"Just so,\" said the general; \"and as it is an affair upon which all\ndepends, and is entirely beyond my control, I think I shall now take\na nap.\" So saying, he turned into his tent, and, in five minutes, this\nbrave and exact man, but in whom the muscular development far exceeded\nthe nervous, was slumbering without a dream.\n\nCivita Vecchia was so near at hand, and the scouts of the general\nwere so numerous and able, that he soon learned the French had not yet\narrived, and another day elapsed and still no news of the French. But,\non the afternoon of the following day, the startling but authentic\ninformation arrived, that, after the French army having embarked and\nremained two days in port, the original orders had been countermanded,\nand the troops had absolutely disembarked.\n\nThere was a cheer in the camp when the news was known, and Theodora\nstarted from her desolation, surprised that there could be in such a\nscene a sound of triumph. Then there was another cheer, and though she\ndid not move, but remained listening and leaning on her arm, the light\nreturned to her eyes. The cheer was repeated, and there were steps about\nher tent. She caught the voice of Lothair speaking to her attendant, and\nadjuring her to tell her mistress immediately that there was good news,\nand that the French troops had disembarked. Then he heard her husband\ncalling Theodora.\n\nThe camp became a scene of excitement and festivity which, in general,\nonly succeeds some signal triumph. The troops lived always in the air,\nexcept in the hours of night, when the atmosphere of the mountains in\nthe late autumn is dangerous. At present they formed groups and parties\nin the vicinity of the tents; there was their gay canteen and there\ntheir humorous kitchen. The man of the Gulf with his rich Venetian\nbanter and the Sicilian with his scaramouch tricks got on very well with\nthe gentle and polished Tuscan, and could amuse without offending the\nhigh Roman soul; but there were some quips and cranks and sometimes\nsome antics which were not always relished by the simpler men from the\nislands, and the offended eye of a Corsican sometimes seemed to threaten\n\"vendetta.\"\n\nAbout sunset, Colonel Campian led forth Theodora. She was in female\nattire, and her long hair, restrained only by a fillet, reached nearly\nto the ground. Her Olympian brow seemed distended; a phosphoric light\nglittered in her Hellenic eyes; a deep pink spot burnt upon each of\nthose cheeks usually so immaculately fair.\n\nThe general and the chief officers gathered round her with their\ncongratulations, but she would visit all the quarters. She spoke to the\nmen in all the dialects of that land of many languages. The men of\nthe Gulf, in general of gigantic stature, dropped their merry Venetian\nstories and fell down on their knees and kissed the hem of her garment;\nthe Scaramouch forgot his tricks, and wept as he would to the Madonna;\nTuscany and Rome made speeches worthy of the Arno and the Forum; and\nthe Corsicans and the islanders unsheathed their poniards and brandished\nthem in the air, which is their mode of denoting affectionate devotion.\nAs the night advanced, the crescent moon glittering above the Apennine,\nTheodora, attended by the whole staff, having visited all the troops,\nstopped at the chief fire of the camp, and in a voice which might have\nmaddened nations sang the hymn of Roman liberty, the whole army ranged\nin ranks along the valley joining in the solemn and triumphant chorus.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 58\n\n\nThis exaltation of feeling in the camp did not evaporate. All felt that\nthey were on the eve of some great event, and that the hour was at hand.\nAnd it was in this state of enthusiasm that couriers arrived with\nthe intelligence that Garibaldi had escaped from Caprera, that he had\nreached Nerola in safety, and was in command of the assembled forces;\nand that the general was, without loss of time, to strike his camp, join\nthe main body at a given place, and then march to Rome.\n\nThe breaking-up of the camp was as the breaking-up of a long frost and\nthe first scent of spring. There was a brightness in every man's face\nand a gay elasticity in all their movements. But when the order of the\nday informed them that they must prepare for instant combat, and that in\neight-and-forty hours they would probably be in face of the enemy, the\nhearts of the young recruits fluttered with strange excitement, and the\nveterans nodded to each other with grim delight.\n\nIt was nearly midnight when the troops quitted the valley, through a\ndefile, in an opposite direction to the pass by which they had entered\nit. It was a bright night. Colonel Campian had the command of the\ndivision in advance, which was five hundred strong. After the defile,\nthe country, though hilly, was comparatively open, and here the advanced\nguard was to halt until the artillery and cavalry had effected the\npassage, and this was the most laborious and difficult portion of the\nmarch, but all was well considered, and all went right. The artillery\nand cavalry, by sunrise, had joined the advanced guard, who were\nbivouacking in the rocky plain, and about noon the main columns of the\ninfantry began to deploy from the heights, and, in a short time, the\nwhole force was in the field. Soon after this some of the skirmishers,\nwho had been sent forward, returned, and reported the enemy in force,\nand in a strong position, commanding the intended route of the invading\nforce. On this the general resolved to halt for a few hours, and rest\nand refresh the troops, and to recommence their march after sunset,\nso that, without effort, they might be in the presence of the enemy by\ndawn.\n\nLothair had been separated from Theodora during this, to him, novel and\nexciting scene. She had accompanied her husband, but, when the whole\nforce advanced in battle array, the general had desired that she should\naccompany the staff. They advanced through the night, and by dawn they\nwere fairly in the open country. In the distance, and in the middle of\nthe rough and undulating plain, was a round hill with an ancient city,\nfor it was a bishop's see, built all about and over it. It would have\nlooked like a gigantic beehive, had it not been for a long convent on\nthe summit, flanked by some stone-pines, as we see in the pictures of\nGaspar and Claude.\n\nBetween this city and the invading force, though not in a direct line,\nwas posted the enemy in a strong position; their right wing protected\nby one of the mounds common in the plain, and their left backed by an\nolive-wood of considerable extent, and which grew on the last rocky\nspur of the mountains. They were, therefore, as regards the plain, on\ncommanding ground. The strength of the two forces was not unequal, and\nthe papal troops were not to be despised, consisting, among others, of a\ndetachment of the legion of Antibes and the Zouaves. They had artillery,\nwhich was well posted.\n\nThe general surveyed the scene, for which he was not unprepared.\nDisposing his troops in positions in which they were as much protected\nas possible from the enemy's fire, he opened upon them a fierce and\ncontinuous cannonade, while he ordered Colonel Campian and eight hundred\nmen to fall back among the hills, and, following a circuitous path which\nhad been revealed by a shepherd, gain the spur of the mountains, and\nattack the enemy in their rear through the olive-wood. It was calculated\nthat this movement, if successful, would require about three hours, and\nthe general, for that period of the time, had to occupy the enemy and\nhis own troops with what were, in realty, feint attacks.\n\nWhen the calculated time had elapsed, the general became anxious, and\nhis glass was never from his eye. He was posted on a convenient ridge,\nand the wind, which was high this day from the sea, frequently cleared\nthe field from the volumes of smoke; so his opportunities of observation\nwere good. But the three hours passed, and there was no sign of the\napproach of Campian, and he ordered Sarano, with his division, to\nadvance toward the mound and occupy the attention of the right wing of\nthe enemy; but, very shortly after Lothair had carried this order, and\nfour hours having elapsed, the general observed some confusion in\nthe left wing of the enemy, and, instantly countermanding the order,\ncommanded a general attack in line. The troops charged with enthusiasm,\nbut they were encountered with a resolution as determined. At first\nthey carried the mound, broke the enemy's centre, and were mixed up with\ntheir great guns; but the enemy fiercely rallied, and the invaders were\nrepulsed. The papal troops retained their position, and their opponents\nwere in disorder on the plain, and a little dismayed. It was at this\nmoment that Theodora rushed forward, and, waving a sword in one hand,\nand in the other the standard of the republic, exclaimed, \"Brothers, to\nRome!\"\n\nThis sight inflamed their faltering hearts, which, after all, were\nrather confounded than dismayed. They formed and rallied round her, and\ncharged with renewed energy at the very moment that Campian had brought\nthe force of his division on the enemy's rear. A panic came over the\npapal troops, thus doubly assailed, and their rout was complete. They\nretreated in the utmost disorder to Viterbo, which they abandoned that\nnight, and hurried to Rome.\n\nAt the last moment, when the victory was no longer doubtful, and all\nwere in full retreat or in full pursuit, a Zouave, in wantonness, firing\nhis weapon before he throw it away, sent a random-shot which struck\nTheodora, and she fell. Lothair, who had never left her during the\nbattle, was at her side in a moment, and a soldier, who had also marked\nthe fatal shot; and, strange to say, so hot and keen was the pursuit,\nthat, though a moment before they seemed to be in the very thick of the\nstrife, they almost instantaneously found themselves alone, or rather\nwith no companions than the wounded near them. She looked at Lothair,\nbut, at first, could not speak. She seemed stunned, but soon murmured:\n\"Go! go! you are wanted!\"\n\nAt this moment the general rode up with some of his staff. His\ncountenance was elate, and his eye sparkled with fire. But, catching the\nfigure of Lothair kneeling on the field, he reined in his charger\nand said, \"What is this?\" Then looking more closely, he instantly\ndismounted, and muttering to himself, \"This mars the victory,\" he was at\nTheodora's side.\n\nA slight smile came over her when she recognized the general, and she\nfaintly pressed his hand, and then said again: \"Go, go; you are all\nwanted.\"\n\n\"None of up are wanted. The day is won; we must think of you.\"\n\n\"Is it won?\" she murmured.\n\n\"Complete.\"\n\n\"I die content.\"\n\n\"Who talks of death?\" said the general. \"This is a wound, but I have\nhad some worse. What we must think of now are remedies. I passed an\nambulance this moment. Run for, it,\" he said to his aide-de-camp. \"We\nmust stanch the wound at once; but it is only a mile to the city, and\nthen we shall find every thing, for we were expected. I will ride on,\nand there shall be proper attendance ready before you arrive. You will\nconduct our friend to the city,\" he said to Lothair, \"and be of good\ncourage, as I am.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 59\n\n\nThe troops were rushing through the gates of the city when the general\nrode up. There was a struggling and stifling crowd; cheers and shrieks.\nIt was that moment of wild fruition, when the master is neither\nrecognized nor obeyed. It is not easy to take a bone out of a dog's\nmouth; nevertheless, the presence of the general in time prevailed,\nsomething like order was established, and, before the ambulance could\narrive, a guard had been appointed to receive it, and the ascent to the\nmonastery, where a quarter was prepared, kept clear.\n\nDuring the progress to the city Theodora never spoke, but she seemed\nstunned rather than suffering; and once, when Lothair, who was walking\nby her side, caught her glance with his sorrowful and anxious face, she\nput forth her head, and pressed his.\n\nThe ascent to the convent was easy, and the advantages of air and\ncomparative tranquillity which the place offered counterbalanced the\nrisk of postponing, for a very brief space, the examination of the\nwound.\n\nThey laid her on their arrival on a large bed, without poles or canopy,\nin a lofty whitewashed room of considerable dimensions, clean and airy,\nwith high, open windows. There was no furniture in the room except a\nchair, a table, and a crucifix. Lothair took her in his arms and laid\nher on the bed; and the common soldier who had hitherto assisted him, a\ngiant in stature, with a beard a foot long, stood by the bedside crying\nlike a child. The chief surgeon almost at the same moment arrived with\nan aide-de-camp of the general, and her faithful female attendant, and\nin a few minutes her husband, himself wounded and covered with dust.\n\nThe surgeon at once requested that all should withdraw except her\ndevoted maid, and they waited his report without, in that deep sad\nsilence which will not despair, and yet dares not hope.\n\nWhen the wound had been examined and probed and dressed, Theodora in a\nfaint voice said, \"Is it desperate?\"\n\n\"Not desperate,\" said the surgeon, \"but serious. All depends upon your\nperfect tranquility--of mind as well as body.\"\n\n\"Well I am here and cannot move; and as for my mind, I am not only\nserene, but happy.\"\n\n\"Then we shall get through this,\" said the surgeon, encouragingly.\n\n\"I do not like you to stay with me,\" said Theodora. \"There are other\nsufferers besides myself.\"\n\n\"My orders are not to quit you,\" said the surgeon, \"but I can be of\ngreat use within these walls. I shall return when the restorative has\nhad its effect. But remember, if I be wanted, I am always here.\"\n\nSoon after this Theodora fell into a gentle slumber, and after two hours\nwoke refreshed. The countenance of the surgeon when he again visited her\nwas less troubled; it was hopeful.\n\nThe day was now beginning to decline; notwithstanding the scenes of\ntumult and violence near at hand, all was here silent; and the breeze,\nwhich had been strong during the whole day, but which blew from the sea,\nand was very soft, played gratefully upon the pale countenance of the\nsufferer. Suddenly she said, \"What is that?\"\n\nAnd they answered and said, \"We heard nothing.\"\n\n\"I hear the sound of great guns,\" said Theodora.\n\nAnd they listened, and in a moment both the surgeon and the maid heard\nthe sound of distant ordnance.\n\n\"The liberator is at hand,\" said the maid.\n\n\"I dare say,\" said the surgeon.\n\n\"No,\" said Theodora, looking distressed. \"The sounds do not come from\nhis direction. Go and see, Dolores; ask, and tell me what are these\nsounds.\"\n\nThe surgeon was sitting by her side, and occasionally touching her\npulse, or wiping the slight foam from her brow, when Dolores returned\nand said, \"Lady, the sounds are the great guns of Civita Vecchia.\"\n\nA deadly change come over the countenance of Theodora, and the surgeon\nlooked alarmed. He would have given her some restorative, but she\nrefused it. \"No, kind friend,\" she said; \"it is finished. I have just\nreceived a wound more fatal than the shot in the field this morning. The\nFrench are at Rome. Tell me, kind friend, how long do you think I may\nlive?\"\n\nThe surgeon felt her pulse; his look was gloomy. \"In such a case as\nyours,\" he said, \"the patient is the best judge.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" she said. \"Send, then, at once for my husband.\"\n\nHe was at hand, for his wound had been dressed in the convent, and he\ncame to Theodora with his arm in a sling, but with the attempt of a\ncheerful visage.\n\nIn the mean time, Lothair, after having heard the first, and by no means\nhopeless, bulletin of the surgeon, had been obliged to leave the convent\nto look after his men, and having seen theme in quarters and made his\nreport to the general, he obtained permission to return to the convent\nand ascertain the condition of Theodora. Arrived there, he heard that\nshe had had refreshing slumber, and that her husband was now with her,\nand a ray of hope lighted up the darkness of his soul. He was walking up\nand down the refectory of the convent with that sickening restlessness\nwhich attends impending and yet uncertain sorrow, when Colonel Campian\nentered the apartment and beckoned to him.\n\nThere was an expression in his face which appalled Lothair, and he was\nabout to inquire after Theodora, when his tongue cleaved to the roof of\nhis mouth, and he could not speak. The Colonel shook his head, and said\nin a low, hollow voice, \"She wishes to see you, and alone. Come.\"\n\nTheodora was sitting in the bed, propped up by cushions, when Lothair\nentered, and, as her wound was internal, there was no evidence of her\nsufferings. The distressful expression of her face, when she heard the\ngreat guns of Civita Vecchia, had passed away. It was serious, but it\nwas serene. She bade her maid leave the chamber, and then she said to\nLothair, \"It is the last time I shall speak to you, and I wish that we\nshould be alone. There is something much on my mind at this moment, and\nyou can relieve it.\"\n\n\"Adored being,\" murmured Lothair with streaming eyes, \"there is no wish\nof yours that I will not fulfil.\"\n\n\"I know your life, for you have told it me, and you are true. I know\nyour nature; it is gentle and brave, but perhaps too susceptible. I\nwished it to be susceptible only of the great and good. Mark me--I have\na vague but strong conviction that there will be another and a more\npowerful attempt to gain you to the Church of Rome. If I have ever been\nto you, as you have sometimes said, an object of kind thoughts--if not\na fortunate, at least a faithful friend--promise me now, at this hour\nof trial, with all the solemnity that becomes the moment, that you will\nnever enter that communion.\"\n\nLothair would have spoken, but his voice was choked, and he could only\npress her hand and bow his head.\n\n\"But promise me,\" said Theodora.\n\n\"I promise,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"And now,\" she said, \"embrace me, for I wish that your spirit should be\nupon me as mine departs.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 60\n\n\nIt was a November day in Rome, and the sky was as gloomy as the heaven\nof London. The wind moaned through the silent streets, deserted except\nby soldiers. The shops were shut, not a civilian or a priest could\nbe seen. The Corso was occupied by the Swiss Guard and Zouaves, with\nartillery ready to sweep it at a moment's notice. Six of the city\ngates were shut and barricaded with barrels full of earth. Troops and\nartillery were also posted in several of the principal piazzas, and on\nsome commanding heights, and St. Peter's itself was garrisoned.\n\nAnd yet these were the arrangements rather of panic than precaution.\nThe utmost dismay pervaded the council-chamber of the Vatican. Since\nthe news had arrived of the disembarkation of the French troops at\nMarseilles, all hope of interference had expired. It was clear that\nBerwick had been ultimately foiled, and his daring spirit and teeming\ndevice were the last hope, as they were the ablest representation,\nof Roman audacity and stratagem. The Revolutionary Committee, whose\nabiding-place or agents never could be traced or discovered, had\nposted every part of the city, during the night, with their manifesto,\nannouncing that the hour had arrived; an attempt, partially successful,\nhad been made to blow up the barracks of the Zouaves; and the cardinal\nsecretary was in possession of information that an insurrection was\nimmediate, and that the city won fired in four different quarters.\n\nThe pope had escaped from the Vatican to the Castle of St. Angelo, where\nhe was secure, and where his courage could be sustained by the presence\nof the Noble Guard, with their swords always drawn. The six-score of\nmonsignori, who in their different offices form what is styled the court\nof Rome, had either accompanied his holiness, or prudently secreted\nthemselves in the strongest palaces and convents at their command. Later\nin the day news arrived of the escape of Garibaldi from Caprera; he was\nsaid to be marching on the city, and only five-and-twenty miles distant.\nThere appeared another proclamation from the Revolutionary Committee,\nmysteriously posted under the very noses of the guards and police,\npostponing the insurrection till the arrival of the liberator.\n\nThe papal cause seemed hopeless. There was a general feeling throughout\nthe city and all classes, that this time it was to be an affair of\nAlaric or Genseric, or the Constable of Bourbon; no negotiations, no\ncompromises, no conventions, but slaughter, havoc, a great judicial\ndevastation, that was to extirpate all signs and memories of Mediaeval\nand Semitic Rome, and restore and renovate the inheritance of the true\noffspring of the she-wolf. The very aspect of the place itself was\nsinister. Whether it were the dulness of the dark sky, or the frown of\nMadre Natura herself, but the old Seven Hills seemed to look askance.\nThe haughty capitol, impatient of its chapels, sighed once more for\ntriumphs; and the proud Palatine, remembering the Caesars, glanced with\nimperial contempt on the palaces of the papal princelings that, in the\ncourse of ignominious ages, had been constructed out of the exhaustless\nwomb of its still sovereign ruin. The Jews in their quarter spoke\nnothing, but exchanged a curious glance, as if to say, \"Has it come at\nlast? And will they indeed serve her as they served Sion?\"\n\nThis dreadful day at last passed, followed by as dreadful a night, and\nthen another day equally gloomy, equally silent, equally panic-stricken.\nEven insurrection would have been a relief amid the horrible and wearing\nsuspense. On the third day the government made some wild arrests of\nthe wrong persons, and then came out a fresh proclamation from the\nRevolutionary Committee, directing the Romans to make no move until the\nadvanced guard of Garibaldi had appeared upon Monte Mario. About this\ntime the routed troops of the pope arrived in confusion from Viterbo,\nand of course extenuated their discomfiture by exaggerating the strength\nof their opponents. According to them, they had encountered not less\nthan ten thousand men, who now; having joined the still greater force of\nGaribaldi, were in full march on the city.\n\nThe members of the papal party who showed the greatest spirit and the\nhighest courage at this trying conjuncture were the Roman ladies and\ntheir foreign friends. They scraped lint for the troops as incessantly\nas they offered prayers to the Virgin. Some of them were trained\nnurses, and they were training others to tend the sick and wounded. They\norganized a hospital service, and when the wounded arrived from Viterbo,\nnotwithstanding the rumors of incendiarism and massacre, they came forth\nfrom their homes, and proceeded in companies, with no male attendants\nbut armed men, to the discharge of their self-appointed public duties.\nThere: were many foreigners in the papal ranks, and the sympathies\nand services of the female visitors to Rome were engaged for their\ncountrymen. Princesses of France and Flanders might be seen by the\ntressel-beds of many a suffering soldier of Dauphin and Brabant; but\nthere were numerous subjects of Queen Victoria in the papal ranks--some\nEnglishmen, several Scotchmen, and many Irish. For them the English\nladies had organized a special service. Lady St. Jerome, with unflagging\nzeal, presided over this department; and the superior of the sisterhood\nof mercy, that shrank from no toil and feared no danger in the\nfulfilment of those sacred duties of pious patriots, was Miss Arundel.\n\nShe was leaning over the bed of one who had been cut down in the\nolive-wood by a sabre of Campian's force, when a peal of artillery\nwas heard. She thought that her hour had arrived, and the assault had\ncommenced.\n\n\"Most holy Mary!\" she exclaimed, \"sustain me.\"\n\nThere was another peal, and it was repeated, and again and again at\nregular intervals.\n\n\"That is not a battle, it is a salute,\" murmured the wounded soldier.\n\nAnd he was right; it was the voice of the great guns telling that the\nFrench had arrived.\n\nThe consternation of the Revolutionary Committee, no longer sustained\nby Colonna, absent in France, was complete. Had the advanced guard of\nGaribaldi been in sight, it might still have been the wisest course to\nrise; but Monte Mario was not yet peopled by them, and an insurrection\nagainst the papal troops, reanimated by the reported arrival of the\nFrench, and increased in numbers by the fugitives from Viterbo, would\nhave been certainly a rash and probably a hopeless effort. And so, in\nthe midst of confused and hesitating councils, the first division of the\nFrench force arrived at the gates of Rome, and marched into the gloomy\nand silent city.\n\nSince the interference of St. Peter and St. Paul against Alaric, the\npapacy had never experienced a more miraculous interposition in its\nfavor. Shortly after this the wind changed, and the sky became serene;\na sunbeam played on the flashing cross of St. Peter's; the Pope left the\nCastle of Angelo, and returned to the Quirinal; the Noble Guard sheathed\ntheir puissant blades; the six-score of monsignori reappeared in all\ntheir busy haunts and stately offices; and the court of Rome, no longer\ndespairing of the republic, and with a spirit worthy of the Senate after\nCannae, ordered the whole of its forces into the field to combat its\ninvaders, with the prudent addition, in order to insure a triumph, of a\nbrigade of French infantry armed with chassepots.\n\nGaribaldi, who was really at hand, hearing of these events, fell back on\nMonte Rotondo, about fifteen miles from the city, and took up a strong\nposition. He was soon attacked by his opponents, and defeated with\nconsiderable slaughter, and forced to fly. The papal troops returned\nto Rome in triumph, but with many wounded. The Roman ladies and their\nfriends resumed their noble duties with enthusiasm. The ambulances were\napportioned to the different hospitals, and the services of all were\nrequired. Our own countrymen had suffered severely, but the skill\nand energy and gentle care of Clare Arundel and her companions only\nincreased with the greater calls upon their beautiful and sublime\nvirtue.\n\nA woman came to Miss Arundel and told her that, in one of the\nambulances, was a young man whom they could not make out. He was\nseverely wounded, and had now swooned; but they had reason to believe he\nwas an Englishman. Would she see him and speak to him? And she went.\n\nThe person who had summoned her was a woman of much beauty, not an\nuncommon quality in Rome, and of some majesty of mien, as little rare,\nin that city. She was said, at the time when some inquiry was made, to\nbe Maria Serafina de Angelis, the wife of a tailor in the Ripetta.\n\nThe ambulance was in the court-yard of the hospital of the Santissima\nTrinita di Pellegrini. The woman pointed to it, and then went away.\nThere was only one person in the ambulance; the rest had been taken to\nthe hospital, but he had been left because he was in a swoon, and they\nwere trying to restore him. Those around the ambulance made room for\nMiss Arundel as she approached, and she beheld a young man, covered\nwith the stains of battle, and severely wounded; but his countenance was\nuninjured though insensible. His eyes were closed, and his auburn hair\nfell in clusters on his white forehead. The sister of mercy touched the\npulse to ascertain whether there yet was life, but, in the very act,\nher own frame became agitated, and the color left her cheek as she\nrecognized--Lothair.'\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 61\n\n\nWhen Lothair in some degree regained consciousness, he found himself\nin bed. The chamber was lofty and dim, and had once been splendid.\nThoughtfulness had invested it with an air of comfort rare under Italian\nroofs. The fagots sparkled on the hearth, the light from the windows\nwas veiled with hangings, and the draughts from the tall doors guarded\nagainst by screens. And by his bedside there were beautiful flowers, and\na crucifix, and a silver bell.\n\nWhere was he? He looked up at the velvet canopy above, and then at the\npictures that covered the walls, but there was no familiar aspect. He\nremembered nothing since he was shot down in the field of Mentana, and\neven that incoherently.\n\nAnd there had been another battle before that, followed by a catastrophe\nstill more dreadful. When had all this happened, and where? He tried\nto move his bandaged form, but he had no strength, and his mind seemed\nweaker than his frame. But he was soon sensible that he was not alone. A\nveiled figure gently lifted him, and another one refreshed his pillows.\nHe spoke, or tried to speak, but one of them pressed her finger to her\nshrouded lips, and he willingly relapsed into the silence which he had\nhardly strength enough to break.\n\nAnd sometimes these veiled and gliding ministers brought him sustenance\nand sometimes remedies, and he complied with all their suggestions, but\nwith absolute listlessness; and sometimes a coarser hand interposed, and\nsometimes he caught a countenance that was not concealed, but was ever\nstrange. He had a vague impression that they examined and dressed his\nwounds, and arranged his bandages; but whether he really had wounds, and\nwhether he were or were not bandaged, he hardly knew, and did not care\nto know. He was not capable of thought, and memory was an effort under\nwhich he always broke down. Day after day he remained silent and almost\nmotionless alike in mind and body. He had a vague feeling that, after\nsome great sorrows, and some great trials, he was in stillness and in\nsafety; and he had an indefinite mysterious sentiment of gratitude to\nsome unknown power, that had cherished him in his dark calamities, and\npoured balm and oil into his wounds.\n\nIt was in this mood of apathy that, one evening, there broke upon his\near low but beautiful voices performing the evening service of the\nChurch. His eye glistened, his heart was touched by the vesper spell. He\nlistened with rapt attention to the sweet and sacred strains, and when\nthey died away he felt depressed. Would they ever sound again?\n\nSooner than he could have hoped, for, when he woke in the morning from\nhis slumbers, which, strange to say, were always disturbed, for the mind\nand the memory seemed to work at night though in fearful and exhausting\nchaos, the same divine melodies that had soothed him in the eve, now\nsounded in the glad and grateful worship of matin praise.\n\n\"I have heard the voice of angels,\" he murmured to his veiled attendant.\n\nThe vesper and the matin hours became at once the epochs of his day. He\nwas ever thinking of them, and soon was thinking of the feelings which\ntheir beautiful services celebrate and express. His mind seemed no\nlonger altogether a blank, and the religious sentiment was the first\nthat returned to his exhausted heart.\n\n\"There will be a requiem to-day,\" whispered one of his veiled\nattendants.\n\nA requiem! a service for the dead; a prayer for their peace and\nrest! And who was dead? The bright, the matchless one, the spell and\nfascination of his life! Was it possible? Could she be dead, who\nseemed vitality in its consummate form? Was there ever such a being as\nTheodora? And if there were no Theodora on earth, why should one think\nof any thing but heaven?\n\nThe sounds came floating down the chamber till they seemed to cluster\nround his brain; sometimes solemn, sometimes thrilling, sometimes\nthe divine pathos melting the human heart with celestial sympathy and\nheavenly solace. The tears fell fast from his agitated vision, and he\nsank back exhausted, almost insensible, on his pillow.\n\n\"The Church has a heart for all our joys and all our sorrows, and for\nall our hopes, and all our fears,\" whispered a veiled attendant, as she\nbathed his temples with fragrant waters.\n\nThough the condition of Lothair had at first seemed desperate, his\nyouthful and vigorous frame had enabled him to rally, and, with time\nand the infinite solicitude which he received, his case was not\nwithout hope. But, though his physical cure was somewhat advanced, the\nprostration of his mind seemed susceptible of no relief. The services\nof the Church accorded with his depressed condition; they were the only\nevents of his life, and he cherished them. His attendants now permitted\nand even encouraged him to speak; but he seemed entirely incurious and\nindifferent. Sometimes they read to him, and he listened, but he\nnever made remarks. The works which they selected had a religious or\necclesiastical bias, even while they were imaginative; and it seemed\ndifficult not to be interested by the ingenious fancy by which it was\nworked out, that every thing that was true and sacred in heaven had its\nsymbol and significance in the qualities and accidents of earth.\n\nAfter a month passed in this manner, the surgeons having announced that\nLothair might now prepare to rise from his bed, a veiled attendant said\nto him one day, \"There is a gentleman here who is a friend of yours, and\nwho would like to see you. And perhaps you would like to see him also\nfor other reasons, for you must have much to say to God after all that\nyou have suffered. And he is a most holy man.\"\n\n\"I have no wish to see any one. Are you sure he is not a stranger?\"\nasked Lothair.\n\n\"He is in the next room,\" said the attendant. \"He has been here\nthroughout your illness, conducting our services; often by your bedside\nwhen you were asleep, and always praying for you.\"\n\nThe veiled attendant drew back and waved her hand, and some one glided\nforward, and said in a low, soft voice, \"You have not forgotten me?\"\n\nAnd Lothair beheld Monsignore Catesby.\n\n\"It is a long time since we met,\" said Lothair, looking at him with some\nscrutiny, and then all interest died away, and he turned away his vague\nand wandering eyes.\n\n\"But you know me?\"\n\n\"I know not where I am, and I but faintly comprehend what has happened,\"\nmurmured Lothair.\n\n\"You are among friends,\" said the monsignore, in tones of sympathy.\n\"What has happened,\" he added, with an air of mystery, not unmixed with\na certain expression of ecstasy in his glance, \"must be reserved for\nother times, when you are stronger, and can grapple with such high\nthemes.\"\n\n\"How long have I been here?\" inquired Lothair, dreamily.\n\n\"It is a month since the Annunciation.\"\n\n\"What Annunciation?\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said the monsignore, and he raised his finger to his lip. \"We\nmust not talk of these things--at least at present. No doubt, the game\nblessed person that saved you from the jaws of death is at this moment\nguarding over your recovery and guiding it; but we do not deserve, nor\ndoes the Church expect, perpetual miracles. We must avail ourselves,\nunder Divine sanction, of the beneficent tendencies of Nature; and in\nyour case her operations must not be disturbed at this moment by any\nexcitement, except, indeed, the glow of gratitude for celestial aid, and\nthe inward joy which must permeate the being of any one who feels that\nhe is among the most favored of men.\"\n\nFrom this time Monsignore Catesby scarcely ever quitted Lothair.\nHe hailed Lothair in the morn, and parted from him at night with a\nblessing; and in the interval Catesby devoted his whole life, and\nthe inexhaustible resources of his fine and skilled intelligence,\nto alleviate or amuse the existence of his companion. Sometimes he\nconversed with Lothair, adroitly taking the chief burden of the talk;\nand yet, whether it were bright narrative or lively dissertation, never\nseeming to lecture or hold forth, but relieving the monologue, when\nexpedient, by an interesting inquiry, which he was always ready in due\ntime to answer himself, or softening the instruction by the playfulness\nof his mind and manner. Sometimes he read to Lothair, and attuned the\nmind of his charge to the true spiritual note by melting passages from\nKempis or Chrysostom.  Then he would bring a portfolio of wondrous\ndrawings by the mediaeval masters, of saints and seraphs, and accustom\nthe eye and thought of Lothair to the forms and fancies of the court of\nheaven.\n\nOne day, Lothair, having risen from his bed for the first time, and\nlying on a sofa in an adjoining chamber to that in which he had been\nso long confined, the monsignore seated himself by the side of Lothair,\nand, opening a portfolio, took out a drawing and held it before Lothair,\nobserving his countenance with a glance of peculiar scrutiny.\n\n\"Well!\" said Catesby, after some little pause, as if awaiting a remark\nfrom his companion.\n\n\"'Tis beautiful!\" said Lothair. \"Is it by Raffaelle?\"\n\n\"No; by Fra Bartolomeo. But the countenance, do you remember ever having\nmet such a one?\"\n\nLothair shook his head. Catesby took out another drawing, the same\nsubject, the Blessed Virgin. \"By Giulio,\" said the monsignore, and he\nwatched the face of Lothair, but it was listless.\n\nThen he showed Lothair another, and another, and another. At last he\nheld before him one which was really by Raffaelle, and by which Lothair\nwas evidently much moved. His eye lit up, a blush suffused his pale\ncheek, he took the drawing himself, and held it before his gaze with a\ntrembling hand.\n\n\"Yes I remember this,\" he murmured, for it was one of those faces of\nGreek beauty which the great painter not infrequently caught up at Rome.\nThe monsignore looked gently round and waved his hand, and immediately\narose the hymn to the Virgin in subdued strains of exquisite melody.\n\nOn the next morning, when Lothair woke, he found on the table, by his\nside, the drawing of the Virgin in a sliding frame.\n\nAbout this time the monsignore began to accustom Lothair to leave his\napartment, and, as he was not yet permitted to walk, Catesby introduced\nwhat he called an English chair, in which Lothair was enabled to survey\na little the place which had been to him a refuge and a home. It seemed\na building of vast size, raised round an inner court with arcades\nand windows, and, in the higher story where he resided, an apparently\nendless number of chambers and galleries. One morning, in their\nperambulations, the monsignore unlocked the door of a covered way which\nhad no light but from a lamp which guided their passage. The opposite\ndoor at the end of this covered way opened into a church, but one of a\ncharacter different from any which Lothair had yet entered.\n\nIt had been raised during the latter of the sixteenth century by\nVignola, when, under the influence of the great Pagan revival, the\nChristian church began to assume the character of an Olympian temple. A\ncentral painted cupola of large but exquisite proportions, supported\nby pilasters with gilded capitals, and angels of white marble springing\nfrom golden brackets; walls incrusted with rare materials of every tint,\nand altars supported by serpentine columns of agate and alabaster;\na blaze of pictures, and statues, and precious stones, and precious\nmetals, denoted one of the chief temples of the sacred brotherhood of\nJesus, raised when the great order had recognized that the views of\nprimitive and mediaeval Christianity, founded on the humility of man,\nwere not in accordance with the age of confidence in human energy, in\nwhich they were destined to rise, and which they were determined to\ndirect.\n\nGuided by Catesby, and leaning on a staff, Lothair gained a gorgeous\nside chapel in which mass was celebrating; the air was rich with\nincense, and all heaven seemed to open in the ministrations of a\nseraphic choir. Crushed by his great calamities, both physical and\nmoral, Lothair sometimes felt that he could now be content if the rest\nof his life could flow away amid this celestial fragrance and these\ngushing sounds of heavenly melody. And absorbed in these feelings it was\nnot immediately observed by him that on the altar, behind the dazzling\nblaze of tapers, was a picture of the Virgin, and identically the same\ncountenance as that he had recognized with emotion in the drawing of\nRaffaelle.\n\nIt revived perplexing memories which agitated him, thoughts on which\nit seemed his brain had not now strength enough to dwell, and yet with\nwhich it now seemed inevitable for him to grapple. The congregation\nwas not very numerous, and, when it broke up, several of them lingered\nbehind and whispered to the monsignore, and then, after a little time,\nCatesby approached Lothair and said: \"There are some here who would\nwish to kiss your hand, or even touch the hem of your garments. It is\ntroublesome, but natural, considering all that has occurred and that\nthis is the first time, perhaps, that they have met any one who has been\nso favored.\"\n\n\"Favored!\" said Lothair; \"Am I favored? It seems to me I am the most\nforlorn of men--if even I am that.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said the monsignore, \"we must not talk of these things at\npresent;\" and he motioned to some, who approached and contemplated\nLothair with blended curiosity and reverence.\n\nThese visits of Lothair to the beautiful church of the Jesuits became\nof daily occurrence, and often happened several times on the same\nday; indeed they formed the only incident which seemed to break his\nlistlessness. He became interested in the change and variety of the\nservices, in the persons and characters of the officiating priests. The\nsoft manners of these fathers, their intelligence in the performance of\ntheir offices, their obliging carriage, and the unaffected concern\nwith which all he said or did seemed to inspire the won upon him\nunconsciously. The church had become his world; and his sympathies, if\nhe still had sympathies, seemed confined to those within its walls.\n\nIn the mean time his physical advancement though slow was gradual and\nhad hitherto never been arrested. He could even walk a little alone,\nthough artificially supported, and ramble about the halls and galleries\nfull of a prodigious quantity of pictures, from the days of Raffael\nSanzio to those of Raffael Mengs.\n\n\"The doctors think now we might try a little drive,\" said the monsignore\none morning. \"The rains have ceased and refreshed every thing. To-day\nis like the burst of spring;\" and, when Lothair seemed to shudder at\nthe idea of facing any thing like the external world, the monsignore\nsuggested immediately that they should go out in a close carriage, which\nthey finally entered in the huge quadrangle of the building. Lothair\nwas so nervous that he pulled down even the blind of his window; and the\nmonsignore, who always humored him, half pulled down his own.\n\nTheir progress seemed through a silent land, and they could hardly be\ntraversing streets. Then the ascent became a little precipitous, and\nthen the carriage stopped, and the monsignore said: \"Here is a solitary\nspot. We shall meet no one. The view is charming, and the air is soft.\"\nAnd he placed his hand gently on the arm of Lothair, and, as it were,\ndrew him out of the carriage.\n\nThe sun was bright, and the sky was bland. There was something in the\nbreath of Nature that was delightful. The scent of violets was worth\nall the incense in the world; all the splendid marbles and priestly\nvestments seemed hard and cold when compared with the glorious colors\nof the cactus and the wild forms of the golden and gigantic aloes.\nThe Favonian breeze played on the brow of this beautiful hill, and the\nexquisite palm-trees, while they bowed their rustling heads, answered in\nresponsive chorus to the antiphon of Nature.\n\nThe dreary look that had been so long imprinted on the face of Lothair\nmelted away.\n\n\"'Tis well that we came, is it not?\" said Catesby; \"and now we will\nseat ourselves.\" Below and before them, on an undulating site, a city\nof palaces and churches spread out its august form, enclosing within its\nample walls sometimes a wilderness of classic ruins--column, and arch,\nand theatre--sometimes the umbrageous spread of princely gardens. A\nwinding and turbid river divided the city in unequal parts, in one of\nwhich there rose a vast and glorious temple, crowned with a dome of\nalmost superhuman size and skill, on which the favorite sign of heaven\nflashed with triumphant truth.\n\nThe expression of relief which, for a moment, had reposed on the face of\nLothair, left it when he said, in an agitated voice, \"I at length behold\nRome!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 62\n\n\nThis recognition of Rome by Lothair evinced not only a consciousness of\nlocality, but an interest in it not before exhibited; and the monsignore\nsoon after seized the opportunity of drawing the mind of his companion\nto the past, and feeling how far he now realized the occurrences that\nimmediately preceded his arrival in the city. But Lothair would not\ndwell on them. \"I wish to think of nothing,\" he said, \"that happened\nbefore I entered this city: all I desire now is to know those to whom I\nam indebted for my preservation in a condition that seemed hopeless.\"\n\n\"There is nothing hopeless with Divine aid,\" said the monsignore; \"but,\nhumanly speaking, you are indebted for your preservation to English\nfriends, long and intimately cherished. It is under their roof that you\ndwell, the Agostini palace, tenanted by Lord St. Jerome.\"\n\n\"Lord St. Jerome!\" murmured Lothair to himself.\n\n\"And the ladies of his house are those who, only with some slight\nassistance from my poor self, tended you throughout your most desperate\nstate, and when we sometimes almost feared that mind and body were alike\nwrecked.\"\n\n\"I have a dream of angels,\" said Lothair; \"and sometimes I listened to\nheavenly voices that I seemed to have heard before.\"\n\n\"I am sure you have not forgotten the ladies of that house?\" said\nCatesby, watching his countenance.\n\n\"No; one of them summoned me to meet her at Rome,\" murmured Lothair,\n\"and I am here.\"\n\n\"That summons was divine,\" said Catesby, \"and only the herald of the\ngreat event that was ordained and has since occurred. In this holy city,\nMiss Arundel must ever count as the most sanctified of her sex.\"\n\nLothair lapsed into silence, which subsequently appeared to be\nmeditation, for, when the carriage stopped, and the monsignore assisted\nhim to alight, he said, \"I must see Lord St. Jerome.\"\n\nAnd, in the afternoon, with due and preparatory announcement, Lord St.\nJerome waited on Lothair. The monsignore ushered him into the chamber,\nand, though he left them as it were alone, never quitted it. He watched\nthem conversing, while he seemed to be arranging books and flowers; he\nhovered over the conference, dropping down on them at a critical moment,\nwhen the words became either languid or embarrassing. Lord St. Jerome\nwas a hearty man, simple and high-bred. He addressed Lothair with all\nhis former kindness, but with some degree of reserve, and even a dash\nof ceremony. Lothair was not insensible to the alteration in his manner,\nbut could ascribe it to many causes. He was himself resolved to make\nan effort, when Lord St. Jerome arose to depart, and expressed the\nintention of Lady St. Jerome to wait on him on the morrow. \"No, my dear\nlord,\" said Lothair; \"to-morrow I make my first visit, and it shall be\nto my best friends. I would try to come this evening, but they will not\nbe alone; and I must see them alone if it be only once.\"\n\nThis visit of the morrow rather pressed on the nervous system of\nLothair. It was no slight enterprise, and called up many recollections.\nHe brooded over his engagement during the whole evening, and his night\nwas disturbed. His memory, long in a state of apathy, or curbed and\ncontrolled into indifference, seemed endowed with unnatural vitality,\nreproducing the history of his past life in rapid and exhausting tumult.\nAll its scenes rose before him--Brentham, and Vauxe, and, Muriel--and\nclosing with one absorbing spot, which, for a long time, it avoided, and\nin which all merged and ended--Belmont. Then came that anguish of the\nheart, which none can feel but those who in the youth of life have lost\nsome one infinitely fascinating and dear, and the wild query why he,\ntoo, had not fallen on the fatal plain which had entombed all the hope\nand inspiration of his existence.\n\nThe interview was not so trying an incident as Lothair anticipated, as\noften under such circumstances occurs. Miss Arundel was not present;\nand, in the second place, although Lothair could not at first be\ninsensible to a change in the manner of Lady St. Jerome, as well as\nin that of her lord, exhibiting as it did a degree of deference and\nceremony which with her toward him were quite unusual, still the genial,\ngushing nature of this lively and enthusiastic woman, full of sympathy,\nsoon asserted itself, and her heart was overflowing with sorrow for all\nhis sufferings and gratitude for his escape.\n\n\"And, after all,\" she said, \"every thing must have been ordained; and,\nwithout these trials, and even calamities, that great event could not\nhave been brought about which must make all hail you as the most favored\nof men.\"\n\nLothair stared with a look of perplexity, and then said: \"If I be the\nmost favored of men, it is only because two angelic beings have deigned\nto minister to me in my sorrow, with a sweet devotion I can never\nforget, and, alas! can never repay.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 63\n\n\nLothair was not destined to meet Clare Arundel alone or only in the\npresence of her family. He had acceded, after a short time, to the wish\nof Lady St. Jerome, and the advice of Monsignore Catesby, to wait on her\nin the evening, when Lady St. Jerome was always at home and never alone.\nHer rooms were the privileged resort of the very cream of Roman society\nand of those English who, like herself, had returned to the Roman\nChurch. An Italian palace supplied an excellent occasion for the display\nof the peculiar genius of our countrywomen to make a place habitable.\nBeautiful carpets, baskets of flowers and cases of ferns, and\nchairs which you could sit upon, tables covered with an infinity of\ntoys--sparkling, useful, and fantastic--huge silken screens of rich\ncolor, and a profusion of light, produced a scene of combined comfort\nand brilliancy which made every one social who entered it, and seemed to\ngive a bright and graceful turn even to the careless remarks of ordinary\ngossip.\n\nLady St. Jerome rose the moment her eye caught the entry of Lothair,\nand, advancing, received him with an air of ceremony, mixed, however,\nwith an expression of personal devotion which was distressing to him,\nand singularly contrasted with the easy and genial receptions that he\nremembered at Vauxe. Then Lady St. Jerome led Lothair to her\ncompanion whom she had just quitted, and presented him to the Princess\nTarpeia-Cinque Cento, a dame in whose veins, it was said, flowed both\nconsular and pontifical blood of the rarest tint.\n\nThe Princess Tarpeia-Cinque Cento was the greatest lady in Rome; had\nstill vast possessions--palaces and villas and vineyards and broad\nfarms. Notwithstanding all that had occurred, she still looked upon the\nkings and emperors of the world as the mere servants of the pope, and on\nthe old Roman nobility as still the conscript fathers of the world. Her\nother characteristic was superstition. So she was most distinguished\nby an irrepressible haughtiness and an illimitable credulity. The only\nsoftening circumstance was that, being in the hands of the Jesuits, her\nreligion did not assume an ascetic or gloomy character. She was fond\nof society, and liked to show her wondrous jewels, which were still\nunrivalled, although she had presented his holiness in his troubles with\na tiara of diamonds.\n\nThere were rumors that the Princess Tarpeia-Cinque Cento had on\noccasions treated even the highest nobility of England with a certain\nindifference; and all agreed that to laymen, however distinguished,\nher highness was not prone too easily to relax. But, in the present\ninstance, it is difficult to convey a due conception of the graciousness\nof her demeanor when Lothair bent before her. She appeared even\nagitated, almost rose from her seat, and blushed through her rouge. Lady\nSt. Jerome, guiding Lothair into her vacant seat, walked away.\n\n\"We shall never forget what you have done for us,\" said the princess to\nLothair.\n\n\"I have done nothing,\" said Lothair, with a surprised air.\n\n\"Ali, that is so like gifted beings like you,\" said the princess. \"They\nnever will think they have done any thing, even were they to save the\nworld.\"\n\n\"You are too gracious, princess,\" said Lothair; \"I have no claims to\nesteem which all must so value.\"\n\n\"Who has, if you have not?\" rejoined the princess. \"Yes, it is to you,\nand to you alone, that we must look. I am very impartial in what I say,\nfor, to be frank, I have not been of those who believed that the great\nchampion would rise without the patrimony of St. Peter. I am ashamed to\nsay that I have even looked with jealousy on the energy that has been\nshown by individuals in other countries; but I now confess that I was\nin error. I cannot resist this manifestation. It was a privilege to\nhave lived when it happened. All that we can do now is to cherish your\nfavored life.\"\n\n\"You are too kind, madam,\" murmured the perplexed Lothair.\n\n\"I have done nothing,\" rejoined the princess, \"and am ashamed that I\nhave done nothing. But it is well for you, at this season, to be at\nRome; and you cannot be better, I am sure, than under this roof. But,\nwhen the spring breaks, I hope you will honor me, by accepting for your\nuse a villa which I have at Albano, and which, at that season, has many\ncharms.\"\n\nThere were other Roman ladies in the room only inferior in rank and\nimportance to the Princess Tarpeia-Cinque Cento; and in the course of\nthe evening, at their earnest request, they were made acquainted with\nLothair, for it cannot be said he was presented to them. These ladies,\ngenerally so calm, would not wait for the ordinary ceremony of life,\nbut, as he approached to be introduced, sank to the ground with the\nobeisance offered only to royalty.\n\nThere were some cardinals in the apartment and several monsignori.\nCatesby was there in close attendance on a pretty English countess, who\nhad just \"gone over.\" Her husband had been at first very much distressed\nat the event, and tore himself from the severe duties of the House of\nLords, in the hope that he might yet arrive in time at Rome to save\nher soul. But he was too late; and, strange to say, being of a domestic\nturn, and disliking family dissensions, he remained at Rome during the\nrest of the session, and finally \"went over\" himself.\n\nLater in the evening arrived his eminence, Cardinal Berwick, for our\nfriend had gained, and bravely gained, the great object of a churchman's\nambition, and which even our Laud was thinking at one time of accepting,\nalthough he was to remain a firm Anglican. In the death-struggle between\nthe Church and the secret societies, Berwick had been the victor, and no\none in the Sacred College more truly deserved the scarlet hat.\n\nHis eminence had a reverence of radiant devotion for the Princess\nTarpeia-Cinque Cento, a glance of friendship for Lady St. Jerome--for\nall, a courtly and benignant smile; but, when he recognized Lothair,\nhe started forward, seized and retained his hand, and then seemed\nspeechless with emotion. \"Ah! my comrade in the great struggle!\" he at\nlength exclaimed; \"this is, indeed, a pleasure--and to see you here!\"\n\nEarly in the evening, while Lothair was sitting by the side of the\nprincess, his eye had wandered round the room, not unsuccessfully, in\nsearch of Miss Arundel; and, when he was free, he would immediately have\napproached her, but she was in conversation with a Roman prince. Then,\nwhen she was for a moment free, he was himself engaged; and, at last,\nhe had to quit abruptly a cardinal of taste, who was describing to him a\nstatue just discovered in the baths of Diocletian, in order to seize the\noccasion that again offered itself.\n\nHer manner was constrained when he addressed her, but she gave him her\nhand, which he pressed to his lips. Looking deeply into her violet eyes,\nhe said: \"You summoned me to meet you at Rome; I am here.\"\n\n\"And I summoned you to other things,\" she answered, at first with\nhesitation and a blush; but then, as if rallying herself to the\nperformance of a duty too high to allow of personal embarrassment,\nshe added: \"all of which you will perform, as becomes one favored by\nHeaven.\"\n\n\"I have been favored by you,\" said Lothair, speaking low and hurriedly;\n\"to whom I owe my life, and more than my life. Yes,\" he continued, \"this\nis not the scene I would have chosen to express my gratitude to you\nfor all that you have done for me, and my admiration of your sublime\nvirtues; but I can no longer repress the feelings of my heart, though\ntheir utterance be as inadequate as your deeds have been transcendent.\"\n\n\"I was but the instrument of a higher power.\"\n\n\"We are all instruments of a higher power, but the instruments chosen\nare always choice.\"\n\n\"Ay, there it is!\" said Miss Arundel; \"and that is what I rejoice you\nfeel. For it is impossible that such a selection could have been made,\nas in your case, without your being reserved for great results.\"\n\n\"I am but a shattered actor for great results,\" said Lothair, shaking\nhis head.\n\n\"You have had trials,\" said Miss Arundel, \"so had St. Ignatius, so\nhad St. Francis, and great temptations; but these are the tests of\ncharacter, of will, of spiritual power--the fine gold is searched. All\nthings that have happened have tended and have been ordained to one end,\nand that was to make you the champion of the Church of which you are now\nmore than the child.\"\n\n\"More than the child?\"\n\n\"Indeed I think so. However, this is hardly the place and occasion to\ndwell on such matters; and, indeed, I know your friends--my\nfriends equally--are desirous that your convalescence should not be\nunnecessarily disturbed by what must be, however delightful, still\nagitating thoughts; but you touched yourself unexpectedly on the theme,\nand, at any rate, you will pardon one who has the inconvenient quality\nof having only one thought.\"\n\n\"Whatever you say or think must always interest me.\"\n\n\"You are kind to say so. I suppose you know that our cardinal, Cardinal\nGrandison, will be here in a few days?\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 64\n\n\nAlthough the reception of Lothair by his old friends and by the leaders\nof the Roman world was in the highest degree flattering, there was\nsomething in its tone which was perplexing to him and ambiguous. Could\nthey be ignorant of his Italian antecedents? Impossible. Miss Arundel\nhad admitted, or rather declared, that he had experienced great trials,\nand, even temptations. She could only allude to what had occurred\nsince their parting in England. But all this was now looked upon as\nsatisfactory, because it was ordained, and tended to one end; and what\nwas that end? His devotion to the Church of Rome, of which they admitted\nhe was not formally a child.\n\nIt was true that his chief companion was a priest, and that he passed a\ngreat portion of his life within the walls of a church. But the priest\nwas his familiar friend in England, who in a foreign land had nursed\nhim with devotion in a desperate illness; and, although in the great\ncalamities, physical and moral, that had overwhelmed him, he had found\nsolace in the beautiful services of a religion which he respected, no\none for a moment had taken advantage of this mood of his suffering and\nenfeebled mind to entrap him into controversy, or to betray him into\nadmissions that he might afterward consider precipitate and immature.\nIndeed, nothing could be more delicate than the conduct of the Jesuit\nfathers throughout his communications with them. They seemed sincerely\ngratified that a suffering fellow creature should find even temporary\nconsolation within their fair and consecrated structure; their voices\nmodulated with sympathy; their glances gushed with fraternal affection;\ntheir affectionate politeness contrived, in a thousand slight instances,\nthe selection of a mass, the arrangement of a picture, the loan of a\nbook, to contribute to the interesting or elegant distraction of his\nforlorn and brooding being.\n\nAnd yet Lothair began to feel uneasy, and his uneasiness increased\nproportionately as his health improved. He sometimes thought that he\nshould like to make an effort and get about a little in the world, but\nhe was very weak, and without any of the resources to which he had been\naccustomed throughout life. He had no servants of his own, no carriages,\nno man of business, no banker; and when at last he tried to bring\nhimself to write to Mr. Putney Giles--a painful task--Monsignore Catesby\noffered to undertake his whole correspondence for him, and announced\nthat his medical attendants had declared that he must under no\ncircumstances whatever attempt at present to write a letter. Hitherto he\nhad been without money, which was lavishly supplied for his physicians\nand other wants; and he would have been without clothes if the\nmost fashionable tailor in Rome, a German, had not been in frequent\nattendance on him under the direction of Monsignore Catesby, who, in\nfact, had organized his wardrobe as he did every thing else.\n\nSomehow or other Lothair never seemed alone. When he woke in the morning\nthe monsignore was frequently kneeling before an oratory in his room,\nand if by any chance Lothair was wanting at Lady St. Jerome's reception,\nFather Coleman, who was now on a visit to the family, would look in\nand pass the evening with him, as men who keep a gaming-table find\nit discreet occasionally to change the dealer. It is a huge and even\nstupendous pile--that Palazzo Agostini, and yet Lothair never tried\nto thread his way through its vestibules and galleries, or attempt a\nreconnaissance of its endless chambers, without some monsignore or other\ngliding up quite propos and relieving him from the dulness of solitary\nexistence during the rest of his promenade.\n\nLothair was relieved by hearing that big former guardian, Cardinal\nGrandison, was daily expected at Rome; and he revolved in his mind\nwhether he should not speak to his eminence generally on the system of\nhis life, which he felt now required some modification. In the interval,\nhowever, no change did occur. Lothair attended every day the services\nof the church, and every evening the receptions of Lady St. Jerome;\nand between the discharge of these two duties he took a drive with\na priest--sometimes with more than one, but always most agreeable\nmen--generally in the environs of the city, or visited a convent, or a\nvilla, some beautiful gardens, or a gallery of works of art.\n\nIt was at Lady St. Jerome's that Lothair met his former guardian. The\ncardinal had only arrived in the morning. His manner to Lothair was\naffectionate. He retained Lothair's hand and pressed it with his pale,\nthin fingers; his attenuated countenance blazed for a moment with a\ndivine light.\n\n\"I have long wished to see you, sir,\" said Lothair, \"and much wish to\ntalk with you.\"\n\n\"I can hear nothing from you nor of you but what must be most pleasing\nto me,\" said the cardinal.\n\n\"I wish I could believe that,\" said Lothair.\n\nThe cardinal caressed him; put his arm round Lothair's neck and said,\n\"There is no time like the present. Let us walk together in this\ngallery,\" and they withdrew naturally from the immediate scene.\n\n\"You know all that has happened, I dare say,\" said Lothair with\nembarrassment and with a sigh, \"since we parted in England, sir.\"\n\n\"All,\" said the cardinal. \"It has been a most striking and merciful\ndispensation.\"\n\n\"Then I need not dwell upon it,\" said Lothair, \"and naturally it would\nbe most painful. What I wish particularly to speak to you about is my\nposition under this roof. What I owe to those who dwell under it no\nlanguage can describe, and no efforts on my part, and they shall be\nunceasing, can repay. But I think the time has come when I ought no\nlonger to trespass on their affectionate devotion, though, when I allude\nto the topic, they seem to misinterpret the motives which influence me,\nand to be pained rather than relieved by my suggestions. I cannot bear\nbeing looked upon as ungrateful, when in fact I am devoted to them. I\nthink, sir, you might help me in putting all this right.\"\n\n\"If it be necessary,\" said the cardinal; \"but I apprehend you\nmisconceive them. When I last left Rome you were very ill, but Lady St.\nJerome and others have written to me almost daily about you, during my\nabsence, so that I am familiar with all that has occurred, and quite\ncognizant of their feelings. Rest assured that, toward yourself, they\nare exactly what they ought to be and what you would desire.\"\n\n\"Well, I am glad,\" said Lothair, \"that you are acquainted with every\nthing that has happened, for you can put them right if it be necessary;\nbut I sometimes cannot help fancying that they are under some false\nimpression both as to my conduct and my convictions.\"\n\n\"Not in the slightest,\" said the cardinal, \"trust me, my dear friend,\nfor that. They know everything and appreciate everything; and, great\nas, no doubt, have been your sufferings, feel that every thing has been\nordained for the best; that the hand of the Almighty has been visible\nthroughout all these strange events; that His Church was never\nmore clearly built upon a rock than at this moment; that this great\nmanifestation will revive, and even restore, the faith of Christendom;\nand that you yourself must be looked upon as one of the most favored of\nmen.\"\n\n\"Everybody says that,\" said Lothair, rather peevishly.\n\n\"And everybody feels it,\" said the cardinal.\n\n\"Well, to revert to lesser points,\" said Lothair, \"I do not say I want\nto return to England, for I dread returning to England, and do not\nknow whether I shall ever go back there; and at any rate I doubt not\nmy health at present is unequal to the effort; but I should like some\nchange in my mode of life. I will not say it is too much controlled,\nfor nothing seems ever done without first consulting me; but, somehow\nor other, we are always in the same groove. I wish to see more of the\nworld; I wish to see Rome, and the people of Rome. I wish to see and do\nmany things which, if I mention, it would seem to hurt the feelings of\nothers, and my own are misconceived, but, if mentioned by you, all would\nprobably be different.\"\n\n\"I understand you, my dear young friend, my child, I will still say,\"\nsaid the cardinal. \"Nothing can be more reasonable than what you\nsuggest. No doubt our friends may be a little too anxious about you, but\nthey are the best people in the world. You appear to me to be quite well\nenough now to make more exertion than hitherto they have thought you\ncapable of. They see you every day, and cannot judge so well of you as\nI who have been absent. I will charge myself to effect all your wishes.\nAnd we will begin by my taking you out to-morrow and your driving with\nme about the city. I will show you Rome and the Roman people.\"\n\nAccordingly, on the morrow, Cardinal Grandison and his late pupil\nvisited together Rome and the Romans. And first of all Lothair was\npresented to the cardinal-prefect of the Propaganda, who presides over\nthe ecclesiastical affairs of every country in which the Roman Church\nhas a mission, and that includes every land between the Arctic and the\nSouthern Pole. This glimpse of the organized correspondence with both\nthe Americas, all Asia, all Africa, all Australia, and many European\ncountries, carried on by a countless staff of clerks in one of the most\ncapacious buildings in the world, was calculated to impress the visitor\nwith a due idea of the extensive authority of the Roman Pontiff. This\ninstitution, greater, according to the cardinal, than any which existed\nin ancient Rome, was to propagate the faith, the purity of which the\nnext establishment they visited was to maintain. According to Cardinal\nGrandison, there never was a body the character of which had been\nso wilfully and so malignantly misrepresented as that of the Roman\nInquisition. Its true object is reformation not punishment and therefore\npardon was sure to follow the admission of error. True it was there\nwere revolting stories afloat, for which there was undoubtedly some\nfoundation, though their exaggeration and malice were evident, of the\nruthless conduct of the Inquisition; but these details were entirely\nconfined to Spain, and were the consequences not of the principles of\nthe Holy Office, but of the Spanish race, poisoned by Moorish and Jewish\nblood, or by long contact with those inhuman infidels. Had it not been\nfor the Inquisition organizing and directing the mitigating influences\nof the Church, Spain would have been a land of wild beasts; and even in\nquite modern times it was the Holy Office at Rome which always stepped\nforward to protect the persecuted, and, by the power of appeal\nfrom Madrid to Rome, saved the lives of those who were unjustly or\nextravagantly accused.\n\n\"The real business, however, of the Holy Office now,\" continued the\ncardinal, \"is in reality only doctrinal; and there is something truly\nsublime--essentially divine, I would say--in this idea of an old man,\nlike the Holy Father, himself the object of ceaseless persecution by all\nthe children of Satan, never for a moment relaxing his heaven-inspired\nefforts to maintain the purity of the faith once delivered to the\nsaints, and at the same time to propagate it throughout the whole world,\nso that there should be no land on which the sun shines that should not\nafford means of salvation to suffering man. Yes, the Propaganda and the\nInquisition alone are sufficient to vindicate the sacred claims of\nRome. Compared with them, mere secular and human institutions, however\nexalted, sink into insignificance.\"\n\nThese excursions with the cardinal were not only repeated, but became\nalmost of daily occurrence. The cardinal took Lothair with him in his\nvisits of business, and introduced him to the eminent characters of the\ncity. Some of these priests were illustrious scholars or votaries of\nscience, whose names were quoted with respect and as authority in the\ncircles of cosmopolitan philosophy. Then there were other institutions\nat Rome, which the cardinal snatched occasions to visit, and which,\nif not so awfully venerable as the Propaganda and the Inquisition,\nnevertheless testified to the advanced civilization of Rome and the\nRomans, and the enlightened administration of the Holy Father. According\nto Cardinal Grandison, all the great modern improvements in the\nadministration of hospitals and prisons originated in the eternal city;\nscientific ventilation, popular lavatories, the cellular or silent\nsystem, the reformatory. And yet these were nothing compared with\nthe achievements of the Pontifical Government in education. In short,\ncomplete popular education only existed at Rome. Its schools were more\nnumerous even than its fountains. Gratuitous instruction originated\nwith the ecclesiastics; and from the night-school to the university here\nmight be found the perfect type.\n\n\"I really believe,\" said the cardinal, \"that a more virtuous, a more\nreligious, a more happy and contented people than the Romans never\nexisted. They could all be kept in order with the police of one of your\ncounties. True it is, the Holy Father is obliged to garrison the city\nwith twelve thousand men of arms, but not against the Romans, not\nagainst his own subjects. It is the secret societies of atheism who\nhave established their lodges in this city, entirely consisting of\nforeigners, that render these lamentable precautions necessary. They\nwill not rest until they have extirpated the religious principle from\nthe soul of man, and until they have reduced him to the condition\nof wild beasts. But they will fail, as they failed the other day, as\nSennacherib failed. These men may conquer zouaves and cuirassiers, but\nthey cannot fight against Saint Michael and all the angels. They may do\nmischief, they may aggravate and prolong the misery of man, but they are\ndoomed to entire and eternal failure.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 65\n\n\nLady St. Jerome was much interested in the accounts which the cardinal\nand Lothair gave her of their excursions in the city and their visits.\n\n\"It is very true,\" she said, \"I never knew such good people; and they\nought to be; so favored by Heaven, and leading a life which, if any\nthing earthly can, must give them, however faint, some foretaste of our\njoys hereafter. Did your eminence visit the Pellegrini?\" This was the\nhospital, where Miss Arundel had found Lothair.\n\nThe cardinal looked grave. \"No,\" he replied. \"My object was to secure\nfor our young friend some interesting but not agitating distraction from\ncertain ideas which, however admirable and transcendently important,\nare nevertheless too high and profound to permit their constant\ncontemplation with impunity to our infirm natures. Besides,\" he added,\nin a lower, but still distinct tone, \"I was myself unwilling to visit\nin a mere casual manner the scene of what I must consider the greatest\nevent of this century.\"\n\n\"But you have been there?\" inquired Lady St. Jerome.\n\nHis eminence crossed himself.\n\nIn the course of the evening Monsignore Catesby told Lothair that a\ngrand service was about to be celebrated in the church of St. George:\nthanks were to be offered to the Blessed Virgin by Miss Arundel for the\nmiraculous mercy vouchsafed to her in saving the life of a countryman,\nLothair. \"All her friends will make a point of being there,\" added the\nmonsignore, \"even the Protestants and some Russians. Miss Arundel was\nvery unwilling at first to fulfil this office, but the Holy Father has\ncommanded it. I know that nothing will induce her to ask you to attend;\nand yet, if I were you, I would turn it over in your mind. I know she\nsaid that she would sooner that you were present than all her English\nfriends together. However, you can think about it. One likes to do what\nis proper.\"\n\nOne does; and yet it is difficult. Sometimes, in doing what we think\nproper, we get into irremediable scrapes; and often, what we hold to be\nproper, society in its caprice resolves to be highly improper.\n\nLady St. Jerome had wished Lothair to see Tivoli, and they were all\nconsulting together when they might go there. Lord St. Jerome who,\nbesides his hunters, had his drag at Rome, wanted to drive them to the\nplace. Lothair sat opposite Miss Arundel, gazing on her beauty. It was\nlike being at Vauxe again. And yet a great deal had happened since they\nwere at Vauxe; and what? So far as they two were concerned, nothing but\nwhat should create or confirm relations of confidence and affection.\nWhatever may have been the influence of others on his existence, hers\nat least had been one of infinite benignity. She had saved his life; she\nhad cherished it. She had raised him from the lowest depth of physical\nand moral prostration to health and comparative serenity. If at Vauxe he\nhad beheld her with admiration, had listened with fascinated interest to\nthe fervid expression of her saintly thoughts, and the large purposes of\nher heroic mind, all these feelings were naturally heightened now when\nhe had witnessed her lofty and consecrated spirit in action, and when\nthat action in his own case had only been exercised for his ineffable\nadvantage.\n\n\"Your uncle cannot go to-morrow,\" continued Lady St. Jerome, \"and on\nThursday I am engaged.\"\n\n\"And on Friday--,\" said Miss Arundel, hesitating.\n\n\"We are all engaged,\" said Lady St. Jerome.\n\n\"I should hardly wish to go out before Friday anywhere,\" said Miss\nArundel, speaking to her aunt, and in a lower tone.\n\nFriday was the day on which the thanksgiving service was to be\ncelebrated in the Jesuit church of St. George of Cappadocia. Lothair\nknew this well enough and was embarrassed: a thanksgiving for the mercy\nvouchsafed to Miss Arundel in saving the life of a fellow-countryman, an\nthat fellow-countryman not present! All her Protestant friends would be\nthere, and some Russians. And he not there! It seemed, on his part,\nthe most ungracious and intolerable conduct. And he knew that she would\nprefer his presence to that of all her acquaintances together. It was\nmore than ungracious on his part; it was ungrateful, almost inhuman.\n\nLothair sat silent, and stupid, and stiff, and dissatisfied with\nhimself. Once or twice he tried to speak, but his tongue would not move,\nor his throat was not clear. And, if he had spoken, he would only have\nmade some trifling and awkward remark. In his mind's eye he saw, gliding\nabout him, the veiled figure of his sick-room, and he recalled with\nclearness the unceasing and angelic tenderness of which at the time he\nseemed hardly conscious.\n\nMiss Arundel had risen and had proceeded some way down the room to a\ncabinet where she was accustomed to place her work. Suddenly Lothair\nrose and followed her. \"Miss Arundel!\" he said, and she looked round,\nhardly stopping when he had reached her. \"Miss Arundel, I hope you will\npermit me to be present at the celebration on Friday?\"\n\nShe turned round quickly, extending, even eagerly, her hand with\nmantling cheek. Her eyes glittered with celestial fire. The words\nhurried from her palpitating lips: \"And support me,\" she said, \"for I\nneed support.\"\n\nIn the evening reception, Monsignore Catesby approached Father Coleman.\n\"It is done,\" he said, with a look of saintly triumph. \"It is done at\nlast. He will not only be present, but he will support her. There are\nyet eight-and-forty hours to elapse. Can any thing happen to defeat us?\nIt would seem not; yet, when so much is at stake, one is fearful. He\nmust never be out of our sight; not a human being must approach him.\"\n\n\"I think we can manage that,\" said Father Coleman.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 66\n\n\nThe Jesuit church of St. George of Cappadocia was situate in one of\nthe finest piazzas of Rome. It was surrounded with arcades, and in its\ncentre the most beautiful fountain of the city spouted forth its streams\nto an amazing height, and in forms of graceful fancy. On Friday morning\nthe arcades were festooned with tapestry and hangings of crimson velvet\nand gold. Every part was crowded, and all the rank and fashion and\npower of Rome seemed to be there assembling. There had been once some\nintention on the part of the Holy Father to be present, but a slight\nindisposition had rendered that not desirable. His holiness, however,\nhad ordered a company of his halberdiers to attend, and the ground was\nkept by those wonderful guards in the dress of the middle ages--halberds\nand ruffs, and white plumes, and party-colored coats, a match for our\nbeef-eaters. Carriages with scarlet umbrellas on the box, and each\nwith three serving-men behind, denoted the presence of the cardinals in\nforce. They were usually brilliant equipages, being sufficiently new, or\nsufficiently new purchases, Garibaldi and the late commanding officer\nof Lothair having burnt most of the ancient coaches in the time of the\nRoman republics twenty years before. From each carriage an eminence\ndescended with his scarlet cap and his purple train borne by two\nattendants. The Princess Tarpeia-Cinque Cento was there, and most of the\nRoman princes and princesses, and dukes, and duchesses. It seemed that\nthe whole court of Rome was there--monsignori and prelates without\nend. Some of their dresses, and those of the generals of the orders,\nappropriately varied the general effect, for the ladies were all in\nblack, their heads covered only with black veils.\n\nMonsignore Catesby had arranged with Lothair that they should enter the\nchurch by their usual private way, and Lothair therefore was not in any\ndegree prepared for the sight which awaited him on his entrance into it.\nThe church was crowded; not a chair nor a tribune vacant. There was a\nsuppressed gossip going on as in a public place before a performance\nbegins, much fluttering of fans, some snuff taken, and many sugar-plums.\n\n\"Where shall we find a place?\" said Lothair.\n\n\"They expect us in the sacristy,\" said the monsignore.\n\nThe sacristy of the Jesuit church of St. George of Cappadocia might have\nserved for the ballroom of a palace. It was lofty, and proportionately\nspacious, with a grooved ceiling painted with all the court of heaven.\nAbove the broad and richly-gilt cornice floated a company of seraphim\nthat might have figured as the Cupids of Albano. The apartment was\ncrowded, for there and in some adjoining chambers were assembled\nthe cardinals and prelates, and all the distinguished or official\ncharacters, who, in a few minutes, were about to form a procession of\nalmost unequal splendor and sanctity, and which was to parade the whole\nbody of the church.\n\nLothair felt nervous; an indefinable depression came over him, as on the\nmorning of a contest when a candidate enters his crowded committee-room.\nConsiderable personages, bowing, approached to address him--the Cardinal\nPrefect of the Propaganda, the Cardinal Assessor of the Holy Office,\nthe Cardinal Pro-Datario, and the Cardinal Vicar of Rome. Monsignori the\nSecretary of Briefs to Princes and the Master of the Apostolic Palace\nwere presented to him. Had this been a conclave, and Lothair the future\npope, it would have been impossible to have treated him with more\nconsideration than he experienced. They assured him that they looked\nupon this day as one of the most interesting in their lives, and the\nimportance of which to the Church could not be overrated. All this\nsomewhat encouraged him, and he was more himself when a certain general\nstir, and the entrance of individuals from adjoining apartments,\nintimated that the proceedings were about to commence. It seemed\ndifficult to marshal so considerable and so stately an assemblage,\nbut those who had the management of affairs were experienced in such\nmatters. The acolytes and the thurifers fell into their places; there\nseemed no end of banners and large golden crosses; great was the company\nof the prelates--a long purple line, some only in cassocks, some in\nrobes, and mitred; then came a new banner of the Blessed Virgin, which\nexcited intense interest, and every eye was strained to catch the\npictured scene. After this banner, amid frequent incense, walked two\nof the most beautiful children in Rome, dressed as angels with golden\nwings; the boy bearing a rose of Jericho, the girl a lily. After these,\nas was understood, dressed in black and veiled, walked six ladies, who\nwere said to be daughters of the noblest houses of England, and then a\nsingle form with a veil touching the ground.\n\n\"Here we must go,\" said Monsignore Catesby to Lothair, and he gently\nbut irresistibly pushed him into his place. \"You know you promised to\nsupport her. You had better take this,\" he said, thrusting a lighted\ntaper into his hand; \"it is usual, and one should never be singular.\"\n\nSo they walked on, followed by the Roman princes, bearing a splendid\nbaldachin. And then came the pomp of the cardinals, each with his\ntrain-bearers, exhibiting with the skill of artists the splendor of\ntheir violet robes.\n\nAs the head of the procession emerged from the sacristy into the church,\nthree organs and a choir, to which all the Roman churches had lent their\nchoicest voices, burst into the Te Deum. Round the church and to all the\nchapels, and then up the noble nave, the majestic procession moved, and\nthen, the gates of the holy place opening, the cardinals entered and\nseated themselves, their train-bearers crouching at their knees, the\nprelates grouped themselves, and the banners and crosses were ranged in\nthe distance, except the new banner of the Virgin, which seemed to hang\nover the altar. The Holy One seemed to be in what was recently a field\nof battle, and was addressing a beautiful maiden in the dress of a\nSister of Mercy.\n\n\"This is your place,\" said Monsignore Catesby, and he pushed Lothair\ninto a prominent position.\n\nThe service was long, but, sustained by exquisite music, celestial\nperfumes, and the graceful movements of priests in resplendent dresses\ncontinually changing, it could not be said to be wearisome. When all was\nover, Monsignore Catesby said to Lothair, \"I think we had better return\nby the public way; it seems expected.\"\n\nIt was not easy to leave the church. Lothair was detained, and received\nthe congratulations of the Princess Tarpeia-Cinque Cento and many\nothers. The crowd, much excited by the carriages of the cardinals, had\nnot diminished when they came forth, and they were obliged to linger\nsome little time upon the steps, the monsignore making difficulties when\nLothair more than once proposed to advance.\n\n\"I think we may go now,\" said Catesby, and they descended into the\npiazza. Immediately many persons in this immediate neighborhood fell\nupon their knees, many asked a blessing from Lothair, and some rushed\nforward to kiss the hem of his garment.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 67\n\n\nThe Princess Tarpeia-Cinque Cento gave an entertainment in the evening\nin honor of \"the great event.\" Italian palaces are so vast, are so\nill-adapted to the moderate establishments of modern tones, that their\ngrand style in general only impresses those who visit them with a\nfeeling of disappointment and even mortification. The meagre retinue are\nalmost invisible as they creep about the corridors and galleries, and\nlinger in the sequence of lofty chambers. These should be filled with\ncrowds of serving-men and groups of splendid retainers. They were built\nfor the days when a great man was obliged to have a great following;\nand when the safety of his person, as well as the success of his career,\ndepended on the number and the lustre of his train.\n\nThe palace of the Princess Tarpeia was the most celebrated in Rome, one\nof the most ancient, and certainly the most beautiful. She dwelt in it\nin a manner not unworthy of her consular blood and her modern income.\nTo-night her guests were received by a long line of foot-servants in\nshowy liveries, and bearing the badge of her house, while in every\nconvenient spot pages and gentlemen-ushers, in courtly dress, guided the\nguests to their place of destination. The palace blazed with light, and\nshowed to advantage the thousand pictures which, it is said, were there\nenshrined, and the long galleries full of the pale statues of Grecian\ngods and goddesses, and the busts of the former rulers of Rome and\nthe Romans. The atmosphere was fragrant with rare odors, and music was\nheard, amid the fall of fountains, in the dim but fancifully-illumined\ngardens.\n\nThe princess herself wore all those famous jewels which had been spared\nby all the Goths from the days of Brennus to those of Garibaldi, and on\nher bosom reposed the celebrated transparent cameo of Augustus, which\nCaesar himself is said to have presented to Livia, and which Benvenuto\nCellini had set in a framework of Cupids and rubies. If the weight of\nher magnificence were sometimes distressing, she had the consolation of\nbeing supported by the arm of Lothair.\n\nTwo young Roman princes, members of the Guarda Nobile, discussed the\nsituation.\n\n\"The English here say,\" said one, \"that he is their richest man.\"\n\n\"And very noble, too,\" said the other.\n\n\"Certainly, truly noble--a kind of cousin of the queen.\"\n\n\"This great event must have an effect upon all their nobility. I cannot\ndoubt they will all return to the Holy Father.\"\n\n\"They would if they were not afraid of having to restore their church\nlands. But they would be much more happy if Rome were again the capital\nof the world.\"\n\n\"No shadow of doubt. I wonder if this young prince will hunt in the\nCampagna?\"\n\n\"All Englishmen hunt.\"\n\n\"I make no doubt he rides well, and has famous horses, and will\nsometimes lend us one. I am glad his soul is saved.\"\n\n\"Yes; it is well, when the Blessed Virgin interferes, it should be in\nfavor of princes. When princes become good Christians, it is an example.\nIt does good. And this man will give an impulse to our opera, which\nwants it, and, as you say, he will have many horses.\"\n\nIn the course of the evening, Miss Arundel, with a beaming face, but of\ndeep expression, said to Lothair: \"I could tell you some good news,\nhad I not promised the cardinal that he should communicate it to you\nhimself. He will see you to-morrow. Although it does not affect me\npersonally, it will be to me the happiest event that ever occurred,\nexcept, of course, one.\"\n\n\"What can she mean?\" thought Lothair. But at that moment Cardinal\nBerwick approached him, and Miss Arundel glided away.\n\nFather Coleman attended Lothair home to the Agostini Palace, and when\nthey parted said, with much emphasis, \"I must congratulate you once more\non the great event.\"\n\nOn the following morning, Lothair found on his table a number of the\nRoman journal published that day. It was customary to place it there,\nbut in general he only glanced at it, and scarcely that. On the present\noccasion his own name caught immediately his eye. It figured in a\nlong account of the celebration of the preceding day. It was with a\ncontinually changing countenance, now scarlet, now pallid as death;\nwith a palpitating heart, a trembling hand, a cold perspiration, and, at\nlength, a disordered vision, that Lothair read the whole of an article,\nof which we now give a summary:\n\n\"Rome was congratulated on the service of yesterday, which celebrated\nthe greatest event of this century. And it came to pass in this wise.\nIt seems that a young English noble of the highest rank, family, and for\ntune\" (and here the name and titles of Lothair were accurately given),\n\"like many of the scions of the illustrious and influential families of\nBritain, was impelled by an irresistible motive to enlist as a volunteer\nin the service of the pope, when the Holy Father was recently-attacked\nby the secret societies of atheism. This gallant and gifted youth, after\nprodigies of valor and devotion, had fallen at Mentana in the sacred\ncause, and was given up for lost. The day after the battle, when the\nambulances laden with the wounded were hourly arriving at Rome from the\nfield, an English lady, daughter of an illustrious house, celebrated\nthroughout centuries for its devotion to the Holy See, and who during\nthe present awful trial had never ceased in her efforts to support the\ncause of Christianity, was employed, as was her wont, in offices of\ncharity, and was tending, with her companion sisters, her wounded\ncountrymen at the Hospital La Consolazione, in the new ward which has\nbeen recently added to that establishment by the Holy Father.\n\n\"While she was leaning over one of the beds, she felt a gentle and\npeculiar pressure on her shoulder, and, looking round, beheld a most\nbeautiful woman, with a countenance of singular sweetness and yet\nmajesty. And the visitor said: 'You are attending to those English who\nbelieve in the Virgin Mary. Now at the Hospital Santissima Trinita di\nPellegrini there is in an ambulance a young Englishman apparently dead,\nbut who will not die if you go to him immediately and say you came in\nthe name of the Virgin.'\n\n\"The influence of the stranger was so irresistible that the young\nEnglish lady, attended by a nurse and one of the porters of La\nConsolazione, repaired instantly to the Di Pellegrini, and there they\nfound in the court-yard, as they had been told, an ambulance, in form\nand color and equipment unlike any ambulance used by the papal troops,\nand in the ambulance the senseless body of a youth, who was recognized\nby the English lady as her young and gallant countryman. She claimed\nhim in the name of the Blessed Virgin, and, after due remedies, was\npermitted to take him at once to his noble relatives, who lived in the\nPalazzo Agostini.\n\n\"After a short time much conversation began to circulate about this\nincident. The family wished to testify their gratitude to the individual\nwhose information had led to the recovery of the body, and subsequently\nof the life of their relation; but all that they could at first learn\nat La Consolazione was, that the porter believed the woman was Maria\nSerafina di Angelis, the handsome wife of a tailor in the Strada di\nRipetta. But it was soon shown that this could not be true, for it was\nproved that, on the day in question, Maria Serafina di Angelis was on a\nvisit to a friend at La Riccia; and, in the second place, that she did\nnot bear the slightest resemblance to the stranger who had given the\nnews. Moreover, the porter of the gate being required to state why he\nhad admitted any stranger without the accustomed order, denied that he\nhad so done; that he was in his lodge and the gates were locked, and the\nstranger had passed through without his knowledge.\n\n\"Two priests were descending the stairs when the stranger came upon\nthem, and they were so struck by the peculiarity of her carriage, that\nthey turned round and looked at her, and clearly observed at the back of\nher head a sort of halo. She was out of their sight when they made this\nobservation, but in consequence of it they made inquiries of the porter\nof the gate, and remained in the court-yard till she returned.\n\n\"This she did a few minutes before the English lady and her attendants\ncame down, as they had been detained by the preparation of some bandages\nand other remedies, without which they never moved. The porter of the\ngate having his attention called to the circumstance by the priests,\nwas most careful in his observations as to the halo, and described it\nas most distinct. The priests then followed the stranger, who proceeded\ndown a long and solitary street, made up in a great degree of garden and\nconvent walls, and without a turning. They observed her stop and speak\nto two or three children, and then, though there was no house to enter\nand no street to turn into, she vanished.\n\n\"When they had reached the children they found each of them holding in\nits hand a beautiful flower. It seems the lady had given the boy a rose\nof Jericho, and to his sister a white and golden lily. Inquiring whether\nshe had spoken to them, they answered that she had said, 'Let these\nflowers be kept in remembrance of me; they will never fade.' And truly,\nthough months had elapsed, these flowers had never failed, and, after\nthe procession of yesterday, they were placed under crystal in the\nchapel of the Blessed Virgin in the Jesuit Church of St. George of\nCappadocia, and may be seen every day, and will be seen forever in\nprimeval freshness.\n\n\"This is the truthful account of what really occurred with respect to\nthis memorable event, and as it was ascertained by a consulta of the\nHoly Office, presided over by the cardinal prefect himself. The Holy\nOffice is most severe in its inquisition of the truth, and, though it\nwell knows that the Divine presence never leaves His Church, it is most\nscrupulous in its investigations whenever any miraculous interposition\nis alleged. It was entirely by its exertions that the somewhat\ninconsistent and unsatisfactory evidence of the porter of the gate, in\nthe first instance, was explained, cleared, and established; the whole\nchain of evidence worked out; all idle gossip and mere rumors rejected;\nand the evidence obtained of above twenty witnesses of all ranks\nof life, some of them members of the learned profession, and others\nmilitary officers of undoubted honor and veracity, who witnessed the\nfirst appearance of the stranger at the Pellegrini and the undoubted\nfact of the halo playing round her temples.\n\n\"The consulta of the Holy Office could only draw one inference,\nsanctioned by the Holy Father himself, as to the character of the\npersonage who thus deigned to appear; and interpose; and no wonder that,\nin the great function of yesterday, the eyes of all Rome were fixed upon\nLothair as the most favored of living men.\"\n\nHe himself now felt as one sinking into an unfathomable abyss. The\ndespair came over him that involves a man engaged in a hopeless contest\nwith a remorseless power. All his life during the last year passed\nrushingly across his mind. He recalled the wiles that had been employed\nto induce him to attend a function in a Jesuits' chapel, in an obscure\nnook of London; the same agencies had been employed there; then, as now,\nthe influence of Clare Arundel had been introduced to sway him when all\nothers had failed. Belmont had saved him then. There was no Belmont now.\nThe last words of Theodora murmured in his ear like the awful voice of\na distant sea. They were the diapason of all the thought and feeling of\nthat profound and passionate spirit.\n\nThat seemed only a petty plot in London, and he had since sometimes\nsmiled when he remembered how it had been baffled. Shallow apprehension!\nThe petty plot was only part of a great and unceasing and triumphant\nconspiracy, and the obscure and inferior agencies which he had been rash\nenough to deride had consummated their commanded purpose in the eyes of\nall Europe, and with the aid of the great powers of the world.\n\nHe felt all the indignation natural to a sincere and high-spirited man,\nwho finds that he has been befooled by those whom he has trustee; but,\nsummoning all his powers to extricate himself from his desolate dilemma,\nhe found himself without resource. What public declaration on his part\ncould alter the undeniable fact, now circulating throughout the world,\nthat in the supernatural scene of yesterday he was the willing and the\nprincipal actor? Unquestionably he had been very imprudent, not only\nin that instance, but in his habitual visits to the church; he felt all\nthat now. But he was tom and shattered, infinitely distressed, both in\nbody and in mind; weak and miserable; and he thought he was leaning\non angelic hearts, when he found himself in the embrace of spirits of\nanother sphere.\n\nIn what a position of unexampled pain did he not now find himself! To\nfeel it your duty to quit the faith in which you have been bred must\ninvolve an awful pang; but to be a renegade without the consolation\nof conscience, against your sense, against your will, alike for\nno celestial hope and no earthly object--this was agony mixed with\nself-contempt.\n\nHe remembered what Lady Corisande had once said to him about those who\nquitted their native church for the Roman communion. What would she say\nnow? He marked in imagination the cloud of sorrow on her imperial brow\nand the scorn of her curled lip.\n\nWhatever happened, he could never return to England--at least for\nmany years, when all the things and persons he cared for would have\ndisappeared or changed, which is worse; and then what would be the use\nof returning? He would go to America, or Australia, or the Indian Ocean,\nor the interior of Africa; but even in all these places, according to\nthe correspondence of the Propaganda, he would find Roman priests, and\nactive priests. He felt himself a lost man; not free from faults in this\nmatter, but punished beyond his errors. But this is the fate of men who\nthink they can struggle successfully with a supernatural power.\n\nA servant opened a door and said, in a loud voice, that, with his\npermission, his eminence, the English cardinal, would wait on him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 68\n\n\nIt is proverbial to what drowning men will cling. Lothair, in his\nutter hopelessness, made a distinction between the cardinal and the\nconspirators. The cardinal had been absent from Rome during the greater\nportion of the residence of Lothair in that city. The cardinal was his\nfather's friend, an English gentleman, with an English education, once\nan Anglican, a man of the world, a man of honor, a good, kind-hearted\nman. Lothair explained the apparent and occasional cooperation of his\neminence with the others, by their making use of him without a due\nconsciousness of their purpose on his part. Lothair remembered how\ndelicately his former guardian had always treated the subject of\nreligion in their conversations. The announcement of his visit,\ninstead of aggravating the distresses of Lothair, seemed, as all these\nconsiderations rapidly occurred to him, almost to impart a ray of hope.\n\n\"I see,\" said the cardinal, as he entered serene and graceful as usual,\nand glancing at the table, \"that you have been reading the account of\nour great act of yesterday.\"\n\n\"Yes; and I have been reading it,\" said Lothair, reddening, \"with\nindignation; with alarm; I should add, with disgust.\"\n\n\"How is this?\" said the cardinal, feeling or affecting surprise.\n\n\"It is a tissue of falsehood and imposture,\" continued Lothair; \"and I\nwill take care that my opinion is known of it.\"\n\n\"Do nothing rashly,\" said the cardinal. \"This is an official journal,\nand I have reason to believe that nothing appears in it which is not\ndrawn up, or well considered, by truly pious men.\"\n\n\"You yourself, sir, must know,\" continued Lothair, \"that the whole of\nthis statement is founded on falsehood.\"\n\n\"Indeed, I should be sorry to believe,\" said the cardinal, \"that there\nwas a particle of misstatement, or even exaggeration, either in the base\nor the superstructure of the narrative.\"\n\n\"Good God!\" exclaimed Lothair. \"Why, take the very first allegation,\nthat I fell at Mentana, fighting in the ranks of the Holy Father.\nEveryone knows that I fell fighting against him, and that I was almost\nslain by one of his chassepots. It is notorious; and though, as a matter\nof taste, I have not obtruded the fact in the society in which I have\nbeen recently living, I have never attempted to conceal it, and have not\nthe slightest doubt that it must be as familiar to every member of that\nsociety as to your eminence.\"\n\n\"I know there are two narratives of your relations with the battle of\nMentana,\" observed the cardinal, quietly. \"The one accepted as authentic\nis that which appears in this journal; the other account, which can only\nbe traced to yourself, bears no doubt a somewhat different character;\nbut considering that it is in the highest degree improbable, and\nthat there is not a tittle of confirmatory or collateral evidence to\nextenuate its absolute unlikelihood, I hardly think you are justified\nin using, with reference to the statement in this article, the harsh\nexpression, which I am persuaded, on reflection, you will feel you have\nhastily used.\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Lothair, with a kindling eye and a burning cheek, \"that\nI am the best judge of what I did at Mentana.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" said the cardinal, with dulcet calmness, \"you naturally\nthink so; but you must remember you have been very ill, my dear young\nfriend, and laboring under much excitement. If I were you--and I speak\nas your friend, I hope your best one--I would not dwell too much on this\nfancy of yours about the battle of Mentana. I would myself always deal\ntenderly with a fixed idea: harsh attempts to terminate hallucination\nare seldom successful. Nevertheless, in the case of a public event, a\nmatter of fact, if a man finds that he is of one opinion, and all\norders of society of another, he should not be encouraged to dwell on a\nperverted view; he should be gradually weaned from it.\"\n\n\"You amaze me!\" said Lothair.\n\n\"Not at all,\" said the cardinal. \"I am sure you will benefit by my\nadvice. And you must already perceive that, assuming the interpretation\nwhich the world without exception places on your conduct in the field to\nbe the just one, there really is not a single circumstance in the whole\nof this interesting and important statement, the accuracy of which you\nyourself would for a moment dispute.\"\n\n\"What is there said about me at Mentana makes me doubt of all the rest,\"\nsaid Lothair.\n\n\"Well, we will not dwell on Mentana,\" said the cardinal, with a sweet\nsmile; \"I have treated of that point. Your case is by no means an\nuncommon one. It will wear off with returning health. King George IV\nbelieved that he was at the battle of Waterloo, and indeed commanded\nthere; and his friends were at one time a little alarmed; but Knighton,\nwho was a sensible man, said, 'His majesty has only to leave off\nCuracao, and rest assured he will gain no more victories.' The rest of\nthis statement, which is to-day officially communicated to the whole\nworld, and which in its results will probably be not less important even\nthan the celebration of the centenary of St. Peter, is established by\nevidence so incontestable--by witnesses so numerous, so various--in all\nthe circumstances and accidents of testimony so satisfactory--I may\nsay so irresistible, that controversy on this head would be a mere\nimpertinence and waste of time.\"\n\n\"I am not convinced,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"Hush!\" said the cardinal; \"the freaks of your own mind about personal\nincidents, however lamentable, may be viewed with indulgence--at least\nfor a time. But you cannot be permitted to doubt of the rest. You must\nbe convinced, and on reflection you will be convinced. Remember, sir,\nwhere you are. You are in the centre of Christendom, where truth, and\nwhere alone truth resides. Divine authority has perused this paper and\napproved it. It is published for the joy and satisfaction of two\nhundred millions of Christians, and for the salvation of all those who,\nunhappily for themselves, are not yet converted to the faith. It\nrecords the most memorable event of this century. Our Blessed Lady has\npersonally appeared to her votaries before during that period, but\nnever at Rome. Wisely and well she has worked in villages and among the\nilliterate as at the beginning did her Divine Son. But the time is now\nripe for terminating the infidelity of the world. In the eternal city,\namid all its matchless learning and profound theology, in the sight of\nthousands, this great act has been accomplished, in a manner which can\nadmit of no doubt, and which can lead to no controversy. Some of the\nmost notorious atheists of Rome have already solicited to be admitted\nto the offices of the Church; the secret societies have received their\ndeathblow; I look to the alienation of England as virtually over. I am\npanting to see you return to the home of your fathers, and re-conquer it\nfor the Church in the name of the Lord God of Sabaoth. Never was a\nman in a greater position since Godfrey or Ignatius. The eyes of all\nChristendom are upon you as the most favored of men, and you stand there\nlike Saint Thomas.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he was as bewildered as I am,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"Well, his bewilderment ended in his becoming an apostle, as yours will.\nI am glad we have had this conversation, and that we agree; I knew we\nshould. But now I wish to speak to you on business, and very grave. The\nworld assumes that, being the favored of Heaven, you are naturally and\nnecessarily a member of the Church. I, your late guardian, know that is\nnot the case, and sometimes I blame myself that it is not so. But I have\never scrupulously refrained from attempting to control your convictions;\nand the result has justified me. Heaven has directed your life, and I\nhave now to impart to you the most gratifying intelligence that can be\ncommunicated by man, and that the Holy Father will to-morrow himself\nreceive you into the bosom of that Church of which he is the divine\nhead. Christendom will then hail you as its champion and regenerator,\nand thus will be realized the divine dream with which you were inspired\nin our morning walk in the park at Vauxe.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 69\n\n\nIt was the darkest hour in Lothair's life. He had become acquainted with\nsorrow; he had experienced calamities physical and moral. The death of\nTheodora had shaken him to the centre. It was that first great grief\nwhich makes a man acquainted with his deepest feelings, which detracts\nsomething from the buoyancy of the youngest life, and dims, to a certain\ndegree, the lustre of existence. But even that bereavement was mitigated\nby distractions alike inevitable and ennobling. The sternest and highest\nof all obligations, military duty, claimed him with an unfaltering\ngrasp, and the clarion sounded almost as he closed her eyes. Then he\nwent forth to struggle for a cause which at least she believed to be\njust and sublime; and if his own convictions on that head might be less\nassured or precise, still there was doubtless much that was inspiring\nin the contest, and much dependent on the success of himself and his\ncomrades that tended to the elevation of man.\n\nBut, now, there was not a single circumstance to sustain his involved\nand sinking life. A renegade--a renegade without conviction, without\nnecessity, in absolute violation of the pledge he had given to the\nperson he most honored and most loved, as he received her parting\nspirit. And why was all this? and bow was all this? What system of\nsorcery had encompassed his existence? For he was spell-bound--as much\nas any knight in fairy-tale whom malignant influences had robbed of his\nvalor and will and virtue. No sane person could credit, even comprehend,\nhis position. Had he the opportunity of stating it in a court of justice\nto-morrow, he could only enter into a narrative which would decide\nhis lot as an insane being. The magical rites had been so gradual, so\nsubtle, so multifarious, all in appearance independent of each other,\nthough in reality scientifically combined, that, while the conspirators\nhad probably effected his ruin both in body and in soul, the only\ncharges he could make against them would be acts of exquisite charity,\ntenderness, self-sacrifice, personal devotion, refined piety, and\nreligious sentiment of the most exalted character.\n\nWhat was to be done? And could any thing be done? Could he escape? Where\nfrom and where to? He was certain, and had been for some time, from many\ncircumstances, that he was watched. Could he hope that the vigilance\nwhich observed all his movements would scruple to prevent any which\nmight be inconvenient? He felt assured that, to quit that palace alone,\nwas not in his power. And were it, whither could he go? To whom was he\nto appeal? And about what was he to appeal? Should he appeal to the Holy\nFather? There would be an opportunity for that to-morrow. To the College\nof Cardinals, who had solemnized yesterday with gracious unction his\nspiritual triumph? To those congenial spirits, the mild Assessor of the\nInquisition, or the president of the Propaganda, who was busied at\nthat moment in circulating throughout both the Americas, all Asia,\nall Africa, all Australia, and parts of Europe, for the edification of\ndistant millions, the particulars of the miraculous scene in which he\nwas the principal actor? Should he throw himself on the protection of\nthe ambiguous minister of the British crown, and invoke his aid against\na conspiracy touching the rights, reason, and freedom of one of her\nmajesty's subjects? He would probably find that functionary inditing a\nprivate letter to the English Secretary of State, giving the minister\na graphic account of the rare doings of yesterday, and assuring the\nminister, from his own personal and ocular experience, that a member\nof one of the highest orders of the British peerage carried in the\nprocession a lighted taper after two angels with amaranthine flowers and\ngolden wings.\n\nLothair remained in his apartments; no one approached him. It was the\nonly day that the monsignore had not waited on him. Father Coleman was\nequally reserved. Strange to say, not one of those agreeable and polite\ngentlemen, fathers of the oratory, who talked about gems, torsos, and\nexcavations, and who always more or less attended his levee, troubled\nhim this morning. With that exquisite tact which pervades the\nhierarchical circles of Rome, every one felt that Lothair, on the eve of\nthat event of his life which Providence had so long and so mysteriously\nprepared, would wish to be undisturbed.\n\nRestless, disquieted, revolving all the incidents of his last year,\ntrying, by terrible analysis, to ascertain how he ever could have got\ninto such a false position, and how he could yet possibly extricate\nhimself from it, not shrinking in many things from self-blame, and yet\nnot recognizing on his part such a degree of deviation from the standard\nof right feeling, or even of commonsense, as would authorize such\nan overthrow as that awaiting him--high rank and boundless wealth, a\nstation of duty and of honor, some gifts of Nature, and golden youth,\nand a disposition that at least aspired, in the employment of these,\naccidents of life and fortune, at something better than selfish\ngratification, all smashed--the day drew on.\n\nDrew on the day, and every hour it seemed his spirit was more lone\nand dark. For the first time the thought of death occurred to him as a\nrelief from the perplexities of existence. How much better had he died\nat Mentana! To this pass had arrived the cordial and brilliant Lord of\nMuriel, who enjoyed and adorned life, and wished others to adorn and\nto enjoy it; the individual whom, probably, were the majority of the\nEnglish people polled, they would have fixed upon as filling the most\nenviable of all positions, and holding out a hope that he was not\nunworthy of it. Born with every advantage that could command the\nsympathies of his fellow-men, with a quick intelligence and a noble\ndisposition, here he was at one-and-twenty ready to welcome death,\nperhaps even to devise it, as the only rescue from a doom of confusion,\ndegradation, and remorse.\n\nHe had thrown himself on a sofa, and had buried his face in his hands to\nassist the abstraction which he demanded. There was not an incident of\nhis life that escaped the painful inquisition of his memory. He passed\nhis childhood once more in that stern Scotch home, that, after all, had\nbeen so kind, and, as it would seem, so wise. The last words of counsel\nand of warning from his uncle, expressed at Muriel, came back to him.\nAnd yet there seemed a destiny throughout these transactions which was;\nirresistible! The last words of Theodora, her look, even more solemn\nthan her tone, might have been breathed over a tripod, for they were a\nprophecy, not a warning.\n\nHow long he had been absorbed in this passionate reverie he knew not\nbut when he looked up again it was night, and the moon had touched his\nwindow. He rose and walked up and down the room, and then went into\nthe corridor. All was silent; not an attendant was visible; the sky was\nclear and starry, and the moonlight fell on the tall, still cypresses in\nthe vast quadrangle.\n\nLothair leaned over the balustrade and gazed upon the moonlit fountains.\nThe change of scene, silent and yet not voiceless, and the softening\nspell of the tranquillizing hour, were a relief to him. And after a time\nhe wandered about the corridors, and after a time he descended into the\ncourt. The tall Swiss, in his grand uniform, was closing the gates which\nhad just released a visitor. Lothair motioned that he too wished to go\nforth, and the Swiss obeyed him. The threshold was passed, and Lothair\nfound himself for the first time alone in Rome.\n\nUtterly reckless, he cared not where he went or what might happen.\nThe streets were quite deserted, and he wandered about with a strange\ncuriosity, gratified as he sometimes encountered famous objects he had\nread of, and yet the true character of which no reading ever realizes.\n\nThe moonlight becomes the proud palaces of Rome, their corniced and\nbalconied fronts rich with deep shadows in the blaze. Sometimes he\nencountered an imperial column; sometimes he came to an arcadian square\nflooded with light and resonant with the fall of statued fountains.\nEmerging from a long, straggling street of convents and gardens, he\nfound himself in an open space full of antique ruins, and among them the\nform of a colossal amphitheatre that he at once recognized.\n\nIt rose with its three tiers of arches and the huge wall that crowns\nthem, black and complete in the air; and not until Lothair had entered\nit could he perceive the portion of the outer wall that was in ruins,\nand now bathed with the silver light. Lothair was alone. In that\nhuge creation, once echoing with the shouts, and even the agonies, of\nthousands, Lothair was alone.\n\nHe sat him down on a block of stone in that sublime and desolate arena,\nand asked himself the secret spell of this Rome that had already so\nagitated his young life, and probably was about critically to affect it.\nTheodora lived for Rome and died for Rome. And the cardinal, born and\nbred an English gentleman, with many hopes and honors, had renounced his\nreligion, and, it might be said, his country, for Rome. And for Rome,\nto-morrow, Catesby would die without a pang, and sacrifice himself for\nRome, as his race for three hundred years had given, for the same cause,\nhonor and broad estates and unhesitating lives. And these very people\nwere influenced by different motives, and thought they were devoting\nthemselves to opposite ends. But still it was Rome--republican or\nCaesarian, papal or pagan, it still was Rome.\n\nWas it a breeze in a breezeless night that was sighing amid these ruins?\nA pine-tree moved its head on a broken arch, and there was a stir\namong the plants that hung on the ancient walls. It was a breeze in a\nbreezeless night that was sighing amid the ruins.\n\nThere was a tall crag of ancient building contiguous to the block\non which Lothair was seated, and which on his arrival he had noted,\nalthough, long lost in reverie, he had not recently turned his glance in\nthat direction. He was roused from that reverie by the indefinite sense\nof some change having occurred which often disturbs and terminates one's\nbrooding thoughts. And looking round, he felt, he saw, he was no longer\nalone. The moonbeams fell upon a figure that was observing him from the\ncrag of ruin that was near, and, as the light clustered and gathered\nround the form, it became every moment more definite and distinct.\n\nLothair would have sprung forward, but he could only extend his arms: he\nwould have spoken, but his tongue was paralyzed.\n\n\"Lothair,\" said a deep, sweet voice that never could be forgotten.\n\n\"I am here,\" he at last replied.\n\n\"Remember!\" and she threw upon him that glance, at once serene and\nsolemn, that had been her last, and was impressed indelibly upon his\nheart of hearts.\n\nNow, he could spring forward and throw himself at her feet, but alas!\nas he reached her, the figure melted into the moonlight, and she was\ngone--that divine Theodora, who, let us hope, returned at last to those\nElysian fields she so well deserved.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 70\n\n\n\"They have overdone it, Gertrude, with Lothair,\" said Lord Jerome to\nhis wife. \"I spoke to Monsignore Catesby about it some time ago, but\nhe would not listen to me; I had more confidence in the cardinal and am\ndisappointed; but a priest is ever too hot. His nervous system has been\ntried too much.\"\n\nLady St. Jerome still hoped the best, and believed in it. She was\nprepared to accept the way Lothair was found senseless in the Coliseum\nas a continuance of miraculous interpositions. He might have remained\nthere for a day or days, and never have been recognized when discovered.\nHow marvelously providential that Father Coleman should have been in the\nvicinity, and tempted to visit the great ruin that very night!\n\nLord St. Jerome was devout, and easy in his temper. Priests and women\nseemed to have no difficulty in managing him. But he was an English\ngentleman, and there was at the bottom of his character a fund of\ncourage, firmness, and commonsense, that sometimes startled and\nsometimes perplexed those who assumed that he could be easily\ncontrolled. He was not satisfied with the condition of Lothair, \"a peer\nof England and my connection;\" and he had not unlimited confidence\nin those who had been hitherto consulted as to his state. There was a\ncelebrated English physician at that time visiting Rome, and Lord St.\nJerome, notwithstanding the multiform resistance of Monsignors Catesby,\ninsisted he should be called in to Lothair.\n\nThe English physician was one of those men who abhor priests, and do\nnot particularly admire ladies. The latter, in revenge, denounced his\nmanners as brutal, though they always sent for him, and were always\ntrying, though vainly, to pique him into sympathy. He rarely spoke,\nbut he listened to every one with entire patience. He sometimes asked a\nquestion, but he never made a remark.\n\nLord St. Jerome had seen the physician, alone before he visited the\nPalazzo Agostini, and had talked to him freely about Lothair. The\nphysician saw at once that Lord St. Jerome was truthful, and that,\nthough his intelligence might be limited, it was pure and direct.\nAppreciating Lord St. Jerome, that nobleman found the redoubtable doctor\nnot ungenial, and assured his wife that she would meet on the morrow\nby no means so savage a being as she anticipated. She received him\naccordingly, and in the presence of Monsignore Catesby. Never had she\nexercised her distinguished powers of social rhetoric with more art\nand fervor, and never apparently had they proved less productive of the\nintended consequences. The physician said not a word, and merely bowed\nwhen exhausted Nature consigned the luminous and impassioned Lady St.\nJerome to inevitable silence. Monsignore Catesby felt he was bound in\nhonor to make some diversion in her favor; repeat some of her unanswered\ninquiries, and reiterate some of her unnoticed views; but the only\nreturn he received was silence, without a bow, and then the physician\nremarked, \"I presume I can now see the patient.\"\n\nThe English physician was alone with Lothair for some time, and then\nhe met in consultation the usual attendants. The result of all these\nproceedings was that he returned to the saloon, in which he found Lord\nand Lady St. Jerome, Monsignore Catesby, and Father Coleman, and he then\nsaid: \"My opinion is, that his lordship should quit Rome immediately,\nand I think he had better return at once to his own country.\"\n\nAll the efforts of the English Propaganda were now directed to prevent\nthe return of Lothair to his own country. The cardinal and Lady St.\nJerome, and the monsignore, and Father Coleman, all the beautiful young\ncountesses who had \"gone over\" to Rome, and all the spirited young\nearls who had come over to bring their wives back, but had unfortunately\nremained themselves, looked very serious, and spoke much in whispers.\nLord St. Jerome was firm that Lothair should immediately leave the city,\nand find that change of scene and air which were declared by authority\nto be indispensable for his health, both of mind and body. But his\nreturn to England, at this moment, was an affair of serious difficulty.\nHe could not return unattended, and attended, too, by some intimate\nand devoted friend. Besides, it was very doubtful whether Lothair had\nstrength remaining to bear so great an exertion, and at such a season\nof the year--and he seemed disinclined to it himself. He also wished to\nleave Rome, but he wished also in time to extend his travels. Amid these\ndifficulties, a Neapolitan duke, a great friend of Monsignore Catesby, a\ngentleman who always had a friend in need, offered to the young English\nnoble, the interesting young Englishman so favored by Heaven, the use\nof his villa on the coast of the remotest part of Sicily, near Syracuse.\nHere was a solution of many difficulties: departure from Rome, change\nof scene and air--sea air, too, particularly recommended--and almost\nthe same as a return to England, without an effort, for was it not an\nisland, only with a better climate, and a people with free institutions,\nor a taste for them, which is the same?\n\nThe mode in which Lady St. Jerome and Monsignors Catesby consulted\nLord St. Jerome on the subject took the adroit but insidious form\nof congratulating him on the entire and unexpected fulfilment of his\npurpose. \"Are we not fortunate?\" exclaimed her ladyship, looking up\nbrightly in his face, and gently pressing one of his arms.\n\n\"Exactly everything your lordship required,\" echoed Monsignore Catesby,\ncongratulating him by pressing the other.\n\nThe cardinal said to Lord St. Jerome, in the course of the morning, in\nan easy way, and as if he were not thinking too much of the matter, \"So,\nyou have got out of all your difficulties.\"\n\nLord St. Jerome was not entirely satisfied, but he thought he had done\na great deal, and, to say the truth, the effort for him had not been\ninconsiderable; and so the result was that Lothair, accompanied by\nMonsignore Catesby and Father Coleman, travelled by easy stages, and\nchiefly on horseback, through a delicious and romantic country, which\nalone did Lothair a great deal of good, to the coast; crossed the\nstraits on a serene afternoon, visited Messina and Palermo, and finally\nsettled at their point of destination--the Villa Catalano.\n\nNothing could be more satisfactory than the monsignore's bulletin,\nannouncing to his friends at Rome their ultimate arrangements. Three\nweeks' travel, air, horse exercise, the inspiration of the landscape\nand the clime, had wonderfully restored Lothair, and they might entirely\ncount on his passing Holy Week at Rome, when all they had hoped and\nprayed for would, by the blessing of the Holy Virgin, be accomplished.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 71\n\n\nThe terrace of the Villa Catalano, with its orange and palm trees,\nlooked upon a sea of lapiz lazuli, and rose from a shelving shore of\naloes and arbutus. The waters reflected the color of the sky, and all\nthe foliage wag bedewed with the same violet light of morn which bathed\nthe softness of the distant mountains, and the undulating beauty of the\never-varying coast.\n\nLothair was walking on the terrace, his favorite walk, for it was the\nduly occasion on which he ever found himself alone. Not that he had any\nreason to complain of his companions. More complete ones could scarcely\nbe selected. Travel, which, they say, tries all tempers, had only proved\nthe engaging equanimity of Catesby, and had never disturbed the amiable\nrepose of his brother priest: and then they were so entertaining and so\ninstructive, as well as handy and experienced in all common things. The\nmonsignore had so much taste and feeling, and various knowledge; and as\nfor the reverend father, all the antiquaries they daily encountered\nwere mere children in his hands, who, without effort, could explain and\nillustrate every scene and object, and spoke as if he had never given a\nthought to any other theme than Sicily and Syracuse, the expedition\nof Nicias, and the adventures of Agathocles. And yet, during all their\ntravels, Lothair felt that he never was alone. This was remarkable at\nthe great cities, such as Messina and Palermo, but it was a prevalent\nhabit in less-frequented places. There was a petty town near them, which\nhe had never visited alone, although he had made more than one attempt\nwith that view; and it was only on the terrace in the early morn, a spot\nwhence he could be observed from the villa, and which did not easily\ncommunicate with the precipitous and surrounding scenery, that Lothair\nwould indulge that habit of introspection which he had pursued through\nmany a long ride, and which to him was a never-failing source of\ninterest and even excitement.\n\nHe wanted to ascertain the causes of what he deemed the failure of his\nlife, and of the dangers and discomfiture that were still impending\nover him. Were these causes to be found in any peculiarity of his\ndisposition, or in the general inexperience and incompetence of youth?\nThe latter, he was now quite willing to believe, would lead their\npossessors into any amount of disaster, but his ingenuous nature\nhesitated before it accepted them as the self-complacent solution of his\npresent deplorable position.\n\nOf a nature profound and inquisitive, though with a great fund of\nreverence which had been developed by an ecclesiastical education,\nLothair now felt that he had started in life with an extravagant\nappreciation of the influence of the religious principle on the conduct\nof human affairs. With him, when heaven was so nigh, earth could not be\nremembered; and yet experience showed that, so long as one was on\nthe earth, the incidents of this planet considerably controlled one's\nexistence, both in behavior and in thought. All the world could not\nretire to Mount Athos. It was clear, therefore, that there was a juster\nconception of the relations between religion and life than that which he\nhad at first adopted.\n\nPractically, Theodora had led, or was leading, him to this result; but\nTheodora, though religious, did not bow before those altars to which\nhe for a moment had never been faithless. Theodora believed in\nher immortality, and did not believe in death according to the\necclesiastical interpretation. But her departure from the scene, and\nthe circumstances under which it had taken place, had unexpectedly and\nviolently restored the course of his life to its old bent. Shattered and\nshorn, he was willing to believe that he was again entering the kingdom\nof heaven, but found he was only under the gilded dome of a Jesuit's\nchurch, and woke to reality, from a scene of magical deceptions, with\na sad conviction that even cardinals and fathers of the Church were\ninevitably influenced in this life by its interest and his passions.\n\nBut the incident of his life that most occupied--it might be said\nengrossed--his meditation was the midnight apparition in the Coliseum.\nMaking every allowance that a candid nature and an ingenious mind\ncould suggest for explicatory circumstances; the tension of his nervous\nsystem, which was then doubtless strained to its last point; the memory\nof her death-scene, which always harrowed and haunted him; and that dark\ncollision between his promise and his life which then, after so many\nefforts, appeared by some supernatural ordination to be about inevitably\nto occur in that very Rome whose gigantic shades surrounded him; he\nstill could not resist the conviction that he had seen the form of\nTheodora and had listened to her voice. Often the whole day, when they\nwere travelling, and his companions watched him on his saddle in silent\nthought, his mind in reality was fixed on this single incident and he\nwas cross-examining his memory as some adroit and ruthless advocate\ndeals with the witness in the box, and tries to demonstrate his\ninfidelity or his weakness.\n\nBut whether it were indeed the apparition of his adored friend or a\ndistempered dream, Lothair not less recognized the warning as divine,\nand the only conviction he had arrived at throughout his Sicilian\ntravels was a determination that, however tragical the cost, his promise\nto Theodora should never be broken.\n\nThe beautiful terrace of the Villa Catalano overlooked a small bay to\nwhich it descended by winding walks. The water was deep, and in any\nother country the bay might have been turned to good account; but\nbays abounded on this coast, and the people, with many harbors, had no\nfreights to occupy them. This morn, this violet morn, when the balm of\nthe soft breeze refreshed Lothair, and the splendor of the rising sun\nbegan to throw a flashing line upon the azure waters, a few fishermen in\none of the country boats happened to come in, about to dry a net upon a\nsunny bank. The boat was what is called a speronaro; an open boat worked\nwith oars, but with a lateen sail at the same time when the breeze\nserved.\n\nLothair admired the trim of the vessel, and got talking with the men as\nthey ate their bread and olives, and a small fish or two.\n\n\"And your lateen sail--?\" continued Lothair.\n\n\"Is the best thing in the world, except in a white squall,\" replied the\nsailor, \"and then every thing is queer in these seas with an open boat,\nthough I am not afraid of Santa Agnese, and that is her name. But I took\ntwo English officers who came over here for sport and whose leave of\nabsence was out--I took them over in her to Malta, and did it in ten\nhours. I believe it had never been done in an open boat before, but it\nwas neck or nothing with them.\"\n\n\"And you saved them?\"\n\n\"With the lateen up the whole way.\"\n\n\"They owed you much, and I hope they paid you well.\"\n\n\"I asked them ten ducats,\" said the man, \"and they paid me ten ducats.\"\n\nLothair had his hand in his pocket all this time, feeling, but\nimperceptibly, for his purse, and, when he had found it, feeling how it\nwas lined. He generally carried about him as much as Fortunatus.\n\n\"What are you going to do with yourselves this morning?\" said Lothair.\n\n\"Well, not much; we thought of throwing the net, but we have had one\ndip, and no great luck.\"\n\n\"Are you inclined to give me a sail?\"\n\n\"Certainly, signor.\"\n\n\"Have you a mind to go to Malta?\"\n\n\"That is business, signor.\"\n\n\"Look here,\" said Lothair, \"here are ten ducats in this purse, and a\nlittle more. I will give them to you if you will take me to Malta\nat once; but, if you will start in a hundred seconds, before the sun\ntouches that rock, and the waves just beyond it are already bright, you\nshall have ten more ducats when you reach the isle.\"\n\n\"Step in, signor.\"\n\nFrom the nature of the course, which was not in the direction of the\nopen sea, for they had to double Cape Passaro, the speronaro was out of\nthe sight of the villa in a few minutes. They rowed only till they had\ndoubled the cape, and then set the lateen sail, the breeze being light,\nbut steady and favorable. They were soon in open sea, no land in sight.\n\"And, if a white squall does rise,\" thought Lothair, \"it will only\nsettle many difficulties.\"\n\nBut no white squall came; every thing was favorable to their progress;\nthe wind the current, the courage, and spirit of the men, who liked the\nadventure, and liked Lothair. Night came on, but they were as tender to\nhim as women, fed him with their least coarse food, and covered him with\na cloak made of stuff spun by their mothers and their sisters.\n\nLothair was slumbering when the patron of the boat roused him, and he\nsaw at hand many lights, and, in a few minutes, was in still water.\nThey were in one of the harbors of Malta, but not permitted to land at\nmidnight, and, when the morn arrived, the obstacles to the release of\nLothair were not easily removed. A speronaro, an open boat from Sicily,\nof course with no papers to prove their point of departure--here were\nmaterials for doubt and difficulty, of which the petty officers of the\nport knew how to avail themselves. They might come from Barbary, from an\ninfected port; plague might be aboard, a question of quarantine. Lothair\nobserved that they were nearly alongside of a fine steam-yacht, English,\nfor it bore the cross of St. George; and, while on the quay, he and\nthe patron of the speronaro arguing with the officers of the port,\na gentleman from the yacht put ashore in a boat, of which the bright\nequipment immediately attracted attention. The gentleman landed almost\nclose to the point where the controversy was carrying on. The excited\nmanner and voice of the Sicilian mariner could not escape notice. The\ngentleman stopped and looked at the group, and then suddenly exclaimed:\n\"Good Heavens! my lord, can it be you?\"\n\n\"Ah, Mr. Phoebus, you will help me!\" said Lothair; and then he went up\nto him and told him every thing. All difficulties, of course, vanished\nbefore the presence of Mr. Phoebus, whom the officers of the port\nevidently looked upon as a being beyond criticism and control.\n\n\"And now,\" said Mr. Phoebus, \"about your people and your baggage?\"\n\n\"I have neither servants nor clothes,\" said Lothair, \"and, if it had not\nbeen for these good people, I should not have had food.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 72\n\n\nPhoebus, in his steam-yacht Pan, of considerable admeasurement, and\nfitted up with every luxury and convenience that science and experience\ncould suggest, was on his way to an island which he occasionally\ninhabited, near the Asian coast of the gean Sea, and which he rented\nfrom the chief of his wife's house, the Prince of Samos. Mr. Phoebus,\nby his genius and fame, commanded a large income, and he spent it\nfreely and fully. There was nothing of which he more disapproved than\naccumulation. It was a practice which led to sordid habits, and was\nfatal to the beautiful. On the whole, he thought it more odious even\nthan debt, more permanently degrading. Mr. Phoebus liked pomp and\ngraceful ceremony, and he was of opinion that great artists should lead\na princely life, so that, in their manners and method of existence, they\nmight furnish models to mankind in general, and elevate the tone and\ntaste of nations.\n\nSometimes, when he observed a friend noticing with admiration, perhaps\nwith astonishment, the splendor or finish of his equipments, he would\nsay: \"The world think I had a large fortune with Madame Phoebus. I had\nnothing. I understand that a fortune, and no inconsiderable one, would\nhave been given had I chosen to ask for it. But I did not choose to\nask for it. I made Madame Phoebus my wife because she was the finest\nspecimen of the Aryan race that I was acquainted with, and I would have\nno considerations mixed up with the high motive that influenced me.\nMy father-in-law Cantacuzene, whether from a feeling of gratitude or\nremorse, is always making us magnificent presents. I like to receive\nmagnificent presents, but also to make them; and I presented him with a\npicture which is the gem of his gallery, and which, if he ever part with\nit, will in another generation be contended for by kings and peoples.\n\n\"On her last birthday we breakfasted with my father-in-law Cantacuzene,\nand Madame Phoebus found in her napkin a check for five thousand pounds.\nI expended it immediately in jewels for her personal use; for I wished\nmy father-in-law to understand that there are other princely families in\nthe world besides the Cantacuzenes.\"\n\nA friend once ventured inquiringly to suggest whether his way of\nlife might not be conducive to envy, and so disturb that serenity of\nsentiment necessary to the complete life of an artist. But Mr. Phoebus\nwould not for a moment admit the soundness of the objection. \"No,\" he\nsaid, \"envy is a purely intellectual process. Splendor never excites\nit; a man of splendor is looked upon always with favor--his appearance\nexhilarates the heart of man. He is always popular. People wish to dine\nwith him, to borrow his money, but they do not envy him. If you want\nto know what envy is, you should live among artists. You should hear\nme lecture at the Academy. I have sometimes suddenly turned round and\ncaught countenances like that of the man who was waiting at the corner\nof the street for Benvenuto Cellini, in order to assassinate the great\nFlorentine.\"\n\nIt was impossible for Lothair in his present condition to have fallen\nupon a more suitable companion than Mr. Phoebus. It is not merely\nchange of scene and air that we sometimes want, but a revolution in the\natmosphere of thought and feeling in which we live and breathe. Besides\nhis great intelligence and fancy, and his peculiar views on art and\nman and affairs in general, which always interested their hearer, and\nsometimes convinced, there was a general vivacity in Mr. Phoebus and a\nvigorous sense of life, which were inspiriting to his companions. When\nthere was any thing to be done, great or small, Mr. Phoebus liked to do\nit; and this, as he averred, from a sense of duty, since, if any thing\nis to be done, it should be done in the best manner, and no one could do\nit so well as Mr. Phoebus. He always acted as if he had been created\nto be the oracle and model of the human race, but the oracle was never\npompous or solemn, and the model was always beaming with good-nature and\nhigh spirits.\n\nMr. Phoebus liked Lothair. He liked youth, and good-looking youth; and\nyouth that was intelligent and engaging and well-mannered. He also liked\nold men. But, between fifty and seventy, he saw little to approve of in\nthe dark sex. They had lost their good looks if they ever had any,\ntheir wits were on the wane, and they were invariably selfish. When they\nattained second childhood, the charm often returned. Age was frequently\nbeautiful, wisdom appeared like an aftermath, and the heart which seemed\ndry and deadened suddenly put forth shoots of sympathy.\n\nMr. Phoebus postponed his voyage in order that Lothair might make his\npreparations to become his guest in his island. \"I cannot take you to a\nbanker,\" said Mr. Phoebus, \"for I have none; but I wish you would share\nmy purse. Nothing will ever induce me to use what they call paper money.\nIt is the worst thing that what they call civilization has produced;\nneither hue nor shape, and yet a substitute for the richest color, and,\nwhere the arts flourish, the finest forms.\"\n\nThe telegraph which brought an order to the bankers at Malta to give an\nunlimited credit to Lothair, rendered it unnecessary for our friend to\nshare what Mr. Phoebus called his purse, and yet he was glad to have the\nopportunity of seeing it, as Mr. Phoebus one morning opened a chest in\nhis cabin and produced several velvet bags, one full of pearls, another\nof rubies, others of Venetian sequins, Napoleons, and golden piastres.\n\"I like to look at them,\" said Mr. Phoebus, \"and find life more intense\nwhen they are about my person. But bank-notes, so cold and thin--they\ngive me an ague.\"\n\nMadame Phoebus and her sister Euphrosyne welcomed Lothair in maritime\ncostumes which were absolutely bewitching; wondrous jackets with loops\nof pearls, girdles defended by dirks with handles of turquoises, and\ntilted hats that; while they screened their long eyelashes from the sun,\ncrowned the longer braids of their never-ending hair. Mr. Phoebus gave\nbanquets every day on board his yacht, attended by the chief personages\nof the island, and the most agreeable officers of the garrison. They\ndined upon deck, and it delighted him, with a surface of sang-froid, to\nproduce a repast which both in its material and its treatment was equal\nto the refined festivals of Paris. Sometimes they had a dance; sometimes\nin his barge, rowed by a crew in Venetian dresses, his guests glided on\nthe tranquil waters, under a starry sky, and listened to the exquisite\nmelodies of their hostess and her sister.\n\nAt length the day of departure arrived. It was bright, with a breeze\nfavorable to the sail and opportune for the occasion. For all the\nofficers of the garrison, and all beautiful Valetta itself, seemed\npresent in their yachts and barges to pay their last tribute of\nadmiration to the enchanting sisters and the all-accomplished owner of\nthe Pan. Placed on the galley of his yacht, Mr. Phoebus surveyed the\nbrilliant and animated scene with delight. \"This is the way to conduct\nlife,\" he said. \"If, fortunately for them, I could have passed another\nmonth among these people, I could have developed a feeling equal to the\nold regattas of the Venetians.\"\n\nThe gean isle occupied by Mr. Phoebus was of no inconsiderable\ndimensions. A chain of mountains of white marble intersected it, covered\nwith forests of oak, though in parts precipitous and bare. The lowlands,\nwhile they produced some good crops of grain, and even cotton and silk,\nwere chiefly clothed with fruit-trees--orange and lemon, and the fig,\nthe olive, and the vine. Sometimes the land was uncultivated, and was\nprincipally covered with myrtles, of large size, and oleanders,\nand arbutus, and thorny brooms. Here game abounded, while from the\nmountain-forests the wolf sometimes descended, and spoiled and scared\nthe islanders.\n\nOn the sea-shore, yet not too near the wave, and on a sylvan declivity,\nwas along, pavilion-looking building, painted in white and arabesque.\nIt was backed by the forest, which had a park-like character from its\npartial clearance, and which, after a convenient slip of even land,\nascended the steeper country and took the form of wooded hills, backed\nin due time by still sylvan yet loftier elevations, and sometimes a\nglittering peak.\n\n\"Welcome, my friend!\" said Mr. Phoebus to Lothair. \"Welcome to an Aryan\nclime, an Aryan landscape, and an Aryan race! It will do you good after\nyour Semitic hallucinations.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 73\n\n\nMr. Phoebus pursued a life in his island partly feudal, partly Oriental,\npartly Venetian, and partly idiosyncratic. He had a grand studio, where\nhe could always find interesting occupation in drawing every fine face\nand form in his dominions. Then he hunted, and that was a remarkable\nscene. The ladies, looking like Diana or her nymphs, were mounted on\ncream-colored Anatolian chargers, with golden bells; while Mr. Phoebus\nhimself, in green velvet and seven-leagued boots, sounded a wondrous\ntwisted horn, rife with all the inspiring or directing notes of musical\nand learned venerie. His neighbors of condition came mounted, but the\nfield was by no means confined to cavaliers. A vast crowd of men, in\nsmall caps and jackets and huge white breeches, and armed with all the\nweapons of Palikari, handjars and ataghans and silver-sheathed muskets\nof uncommon length and almost as old as the battle of Lepanto, always\nrallied round his standard. The equestrians caracoled about the park,\nand the horns sounded, and the hounds bayed, and the men shouted, till\nthe deer had all scudded away. Then, by degrees, the hunters entered the\nforest, and the notes of venerie became more faint and the shouts more\ndistant. Then, for two or three hours, all was silent, save the sound\nof an occasional shot or the note of a stray hound, until the human\nstragglers began to reappear emerging from the forest, and in due\ntime the great body of the hunt, and a gilded cart drawn by mules and\ncarrying the prostrate forms of fallow-deer and roebuck. None of the\nceremonies of the chase were omitted, and the crowd dispersed, refreshed\nby Samian wine, which Mr. Phoebus was teaching them to make without\nresin, and which they quaffed with shrugging shoulders.\n\n\"We must have a wolf-hunt for you,\" said Euphrosyne to Lothair. \"You\nlike excitement, I believe?\"\n\n\"Well, I am rather inclined for repose at present, and I came here with\nthe hope of obtaining it.\"\n\n\"Well, we are never idle here; in fact, that would be impossible with\nGaston. He has established here an academy of the fine arts, and also\nrevived the gymnasia; and my sister and myself have schools--only music\nand dancing; Gaston does not approve of letters. The poor people have,\nof course, their primary schools, with their priests, and Gaston does\nnot interfere with them, but he regrets their existence. He looks upon\nreading and writing as very injurious to education.\"\n\nSometimes reposing on divans, the sisters received the chief persons of\nthe isle, and regaled them with fruits and sweetmeats, and coffee and\nsherbets, while Gaston's chibouques and tobacco of Salonica were a\nproverb. These meetings always ended with dance and song, replete,\naccording to Mr. Phoebus, with studies of Aryan life.\n\n\"I believe these islanders to be an unmixed race,\" said Mr. Phoebus.\n\"The same form and visage prevails throughout; and very little changed\nin any thing--even in their religion.\"\n\n\"Unchanged in their religion!\" said Lothair, with some astonishment.\n\n\"Yes; you will find it so. Their existence is easy; their wants are not\ngreat, and their means of subsistence plentiful. They pass much of their\nlife in what is called amusement--and what is it? They make parties of\npleasure; they go in procession to a fountain or a grove. They dance and\neat fruit, and they return home singing songs. They have, in fact, been\nperforming unconsciously the religious ceremonies of their ancestors,\nand which they pursue, and will forever, though they may have forgotten\nthe name of the dryad or the nymph who presides over their waters.\"\n\n\"I should think their priests would guard them from these errors,\" said\nLothair.\n\n\"The Greek priests, particularly in these Asian islands, are good sort\nof people,\" said Mr. Phoebus. \"They marry and have generally large\nfamilies, often very beautiful. They have no sacerdotal feelings, for\nthey never can have any preferment; all the high posts in the Greek\nChurch being reserved for the monks, who study what is called theology.\nThe Greek parish priest is not at all Semitic; there is nothing to\ncounteract his Aryan tendencies. I have already raised the statue of\na nymph at one of their favorite springs and places of pleasant\npilgrimage, and I have a statue now in the island, still in its case,\nwhich I contemplate installing in a famous grove of laurel not far off\nand very much resorted to.\"\n\n\"And what then?\" inquired Lothair.\n\n\"Well, I have a conviction that among the great races the old creeds\nwill come back,\" said Mr. Phoebus, \"and it will be acknowledged that\ntrue religion is the worship of the beautiful. For the beautiful cannot\nbe attained without virtue, if virtue consists, as I believe, in the\ncontrol of the passions, in the sentiment of repose, and the avoidance\nin all things of excess.\"\n\nOne night Lothair was walking home with the sisters from a village\nfestival where they had been much amused.\n\n\"You have had a great many adventures since we first met?\" said Madame\nPhoebus.\n\n\"Which makes it seem longer ago than it really is,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"You count time by emotion, then?\" said Euphrosyne.\n\n\"Well, it is a wonderful thing, however it be computed,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"For my part, I do not think that it ought to be counted at all,\" said\nMadame Phoebus; \"and there is nothing to me so detestable in Europe as\nthe quantity of clocks and watches.\"\n\n\"Do you use a watch, my lord?\" asked Euphrosyne, in a tone which always\nseemed to Lothair one of mocking artlessness.\n\n\"I believe I never wound it up when I had one,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"But you make such good use of your time,\" said Madame Phoebus, \"you do\nnot require watches.\"\n\n\"I am glad to hear I make good use of my time,\" said Lothair, \"but a\nlittle surprised.\"\n\n\"But you are so good, so religious,\" said Madame Phoebus. \"That is a\ngreat thing; especially for one so young.\"\n\n\"Hem!\" said Lothair.\n\n\"That must have been a beautiful procession at Rome,\" said Euphrosyne.\n\n\"I was rather a spectator of it than an actor in it,\" said Lothair, with\nsome seriousness. \"It is too long a tale to enter into, but my part in\nthose proceedings was entirely misrepresented.\"\n\n\"I believe that nothing in the newspapers is ever true,\" said Madame\nPhoebus.\n\n\"And that is why they are so popular,\" added Euphrosyne; \"the taste of\nthe age being so decidedly for fiction.\"\n\n\"Is it true that you escaped from a convent to Malta?\" said Madame\nPhoebus.\n\n\"Not quite,\" said Lothair, \"but true enough for conversations.\"\n\n\"As confidential as the present, I suppose?\" said Euphrosyne.\n\n\"Yes, when we are grave, as we are inclined to be now,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"Then, you have been fighting a good deal,\" said Madame Phoebus.\n\n\"You are putting me on a court-martial, Madame Phoebus,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"But we do not know on which side you were,\" said Euphrosyne.\n\n\"That is matter of history,\" said Lothair, \"and that, you know, is\nalways doubtful.\"\n\n\"Well, I do not like fighting,\" said Madame Phoebus, \"and for my part I\nnever could find out that it did an good.\"\n\n\"And what do you like?\" said Lothair. \"Tell me how would you pass your\nlife?\"\n\n\"Well, much as I do. I do not know that I want any change, except I\nthink I should like it to be always summer.\"\n\n\"And I would have perpetual spring,\" said Euphrosyne.\n\n\"But, summer or spring, what would be your favorite pursuit?\"\n\n\"Well, dancing is very nice,\" said Madame Phoebus.\n\n\"But we cannot always, be dancing,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"Then we would sing,\" said Euphrosyne.\n\n\"But the time comes when one can neither dance nor sing,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"Oh, then we become part of the audience,\" said Madame Phoebus, \"the\npeople for whose amusement everybody labors.\"\n\n\"And enjoy power without responsibility,\" said Euphrosyne, \"detect false\nnotes and mark awkward gestures. How can any one doubt of Providence\nwith such a system of constant compensation!\"\n\nThere was something in the society of these two sisters that Lothair\nbegan to find highly attractive. Their extraordinary beauty, their\ngenuine and unflagging gayety, their thorough enjoyment of existence,\nand the variety of resources with which they made life amusing and\ngraceful, all contributed to captivate him. They had, too, a great love\nand knowledge both of art and nature, and insensibly they weaned Lothair\nfrom that habit of introspection which, though natural to him, he\nhad too much indulged, and taught him to find sources of interest and\ndelight in external objects. He was beginning to feel happy in this\nislands and wishing that his life might never change, when one day Mr.\nPhoebus informed them that the Prince Agathonides, the eldest son of\nthe Prince of Samos, would arrive from Constantinople in a few days,\nand would pay them a visit. \"He will come with some retinue,\" said Mr.\nPhoebus, \"but I trust we shall be able by our reception to show that the\nCantacuzenes are not the only princely family in the world.\"\n\nMr. Phoebus was confident in his resources in this respect, for his\nyacht's crew in their Venetian dresses could always furnish a guard of\nhonor which no Grecian prince or Turkish pacha could easily rival. When\nthe eventful day arrived, he was quite equal to the occasion. The yacht\nwas dressed in every part with the streaming colors of all nations, the\nbanner of Gaston Phoebus waved from his pavilion, the guard of honor\nkept the ground, but the population of the isle were present in numbers\nand in their most showy costume, and a battery of ancient Turkish guns\nfired a salute without an accident.\n\nThe Prince Agathonides was a youth, good looking and dressed in a\nsplendid Palikar costume, though his manners were quite European, being\nan attach to the Turkish embassy at Vienna. He had with him a sort of\ngovernor, a secretary, servants in Mamlouk dresses, pipe-bearers, and\ngrooms, there being some horses as presents from his father to Mr.\nPhoebus, and some rarely-embroidered kerchiefs and choice perfumes and\nPersian greyhounds for the ladies.\n\n'The arrival of the young prince was the signal for a series of\nentertainments on the island. First of all, Mr. Phoebus resolved to give\na dinner in the Frank style, to prove to Agathonides that there were\nother members of the Cantacuzene family besides himself who comprehended\na first-rate Frank dinner. The chief people of the island were invited\nto this banquet. They drank the choicest grapes of France and Germany,\nwere stuffed with truffles, and sat on little cane chairs. But one might\ndetect in their countenances how they sighed for their easy divans,\ntheir simple dishes, and their resinous wine. Then there was a\nwolf-hunt, and other sport; a great day of gymnasia, many dances and\nmuch music; in fact, there were choruses all over the island, and every\nnight was a serenade.\n\nWhy such general joy? Because it was understood that the heir-apparent\nof the isle, their future sovereign, had in fact arrived to make his bow\nto the beautiful Euphrosyne, as though he saw her for the first time.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 74\n\n\nVery shortly after his arrival at Malta, Mr. Phoebus had spoken to\nLothair about Theodora. It appeared that Lucien Campian, though severely\nwounded, had escaped with Garibaldi after the battle of Mentana into the\nItalian territories. Here they were at once arrested, but not severely\ndetained, and Colonel Campian took the first opportunity of revisiting\nEngland, where, after settling his affairs, he had returned to his\nnative country, from which he had been separated for many years. Mr.\nPhoebus during the interval had seen a great deal of him, and the\ncolonel departed for America under the impression that Lothair had been\namong the slain at the final struggle.\n\n\"Campian is one of the beat men I over knew,\" said Phoebus. \"He was a\nremarkable instance of energy combined with softness of disposition. In\nmy opinion, however, he ought never to have visited Europe: he was made\nto clear the backwoods, and govern man by the power of his hatchet and\nthe mildness of his words. He was fighting for freedom all his life,\nyet slavery made and slavery destroyed him. Among all the freaks of Fate\nnothing is more surprising than that this Transatlantic planter should\nhave been ordained to be the husband of a divine being--a true Hellenic\ngoddess, who in the good days would have been worshipped in this\ncountry, and have inspired her race to actions of grace, wisdom, and\nbeauty.\"\n\n\"I greatly esteem him,\" said Lothair \"and I shall write to him\ndirectly.\"\n\n\"Except by Campian, who spoke probably about you to no one save myself,\"\ncontinued Phoebus, \"your name has never been mentioned with reference to\nthose strange transactions. Once there was a sort of rumor that you had\nmet with some mishap, but these things were contradicted and explained,\nand then forgotten: and people were all out of town. I believe that\nCardinal Grandison communicated with your man of business, and between\nthem every thing was kept quiet, until this portentous account of your\ndoings at Rome, which transpired after we left England and which met us\nat Malta.\"\n\n\"I have written to my man of business about that,\" said Lothair, \"but\nI think it will tax all his ingenuity to explain, or to mystify it as\nsuccessfully as he did the preceding adventures. At any rate, he will\nnot have the assistance of my lord cardinal.\"\n\n\"Theodora was a remarkable woman on many accounts,\" said Mr. Phoebus,\n\"but particularly on this, that, although one of the most beautiful\nwomen that ever existed, she was adored by beautiful women. My wife\nadored her; Euphrosyne, who has no enthusiasm, adored her; the Princess\nof Tivoli, the most capricious being probably that ever existed, adored;\nand always adored, Theodora. I think it must have been that there was\non her part a total absence of vanity, and this the more strange in\none whose vocation in her earlier life had been to attract and live\non popular applause; but I have seen her quit theatres ringing with\nadmiration and enter her carriage with the serenity of a Phidian muse.\"\n\n\"I adored her,\" said Lothair, \"but I never could quite solve her\ncharacter. Perhaps it was too rich and deep far rapid comprehension.\"\n\n\"We shall never perhaps see her like again,\" said Mr. Phoebus. \"It was a\nrare combination, peculiar to the Tyrrhenian sea. I am satisfied that we\nmust go there to find the pure Hellenic blood, and from thence it got to\nRome.\"\n\n\"We may not see her like again, but we may see her again,\" said Lothair;\n\"and sometimes I think she is always hovering over me.\"\n\nIn this vein, when they were alone, they were frequently speaking of\nthe departed, and one day--it was before the arrival of Prince\nAgathonides--Mr. Phoebus said to Lothair: \"We will ride this morning to\nwhat we call the grove of Daphne. It is a real laurel-grove. Some of the\ntrees must be immemorial, and deserve to have been sacred, if once\nthey were not so. In their huge, grotesque forms you would not easily\nrecognize your polished friends of Europe, so trim and glossy and\nshrub-like. The people are very fond of this grove, and make frequent\nprocessions there. Once a year they must be headed by their priest.\nNo one knows why, nor has he the slightest idea of the reason of the\nvarious ceremonies which he that day performs. But we know, and some day\nhe or his successors will equally understand them. Yes, if I remain here\nlong enough--and I sometimes think I will never again quit the isle--I\nshall expect some fine summer night, when there is that rich stillness\nwhich the whispering waves only render more intense, to hear a voice\nof music on the mountains declaring that the god Pan has returned to\nearth.\"\n\nIt was a picturesque ride, as every ride was on this island, skirting\nthe sylvan hills with the sea glimmering in the distance. Lothair was\npleased with the approaches to the sacred grove: now and then a single\ntree with gray branches and a green head, then a great spread of\nunderwood, all laurel, and then spontaneous plantations of young trees.\n\n\"There was always a vacant space in the centre of the grove,\" said Mr.\nPhoebus, \"once sadly overrun with wild shrubs, but I have cleared it and\nrestored the genius of the spot. See!\"\n\nThey entered the sacred circle and beheld a statue raised on a porphyry\npedestal. The light fell with magical effect on the face of the statue.\nIt was the statue of Theodora, the placing of which in the pavilion\nof Belmont Mr. Phoebus was superintending when Lothair first made his\nacquaintance.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 75\n\n\nThe Prince Agathonides seemed quite to monopolize the attention\nof Madame Phoebus and her sister. This was not very unreasonable,\nconsidering that he was their visitor, the future chief of their house,\nand had brought them so many embroidered pocket-handkerchiefs, choice\nscents, and fancy dogs. But Lothair thought it quite disgusting, nor\ncould he conceive what they saw in him, what they were talking about or\nlaughing about, for, so far as he had been able to form any opinion on\nthe subject, the prince was a shallow-pated coxcomb without a single\nquality to charm any woman of sense and spirit. Lothair began to\nconsider how he could pursue his travels, where he should go to, and,\nwhen that was settled, how he should get there.\n\nJust at this moment of perplexity, as is often the case, something\noccurred which no one could foresee, but which, like every event,\nremoved some difficulties and introduced others.\n\nThere arrived at the island a dispatch forwarded to Mr. Phoebus by\nthe Russian ambassador at Constantinople, who had received it from\nhis colleague at London. This dispatch contained a proposition to\nMr. Phoebus to repair to the court of St. Petersburg, and accept\nappointments of high distinction and emolument. Without in any way\nrestricting the independent pursuit of his profession, he was offered\na large salary, the post of court painter, and the presidency of the\nAcademy of Fine Arts. Of such moment did the Russian Government deem the\nofficial presence of this illustrious artist in their country, that\nit was intimated, if the arrangement could be effected, its conclusion\nmight be celebrated by conferring on Mr. Phoebus a patent of nobility\nand a decoration of a high class. The dispatch contained a private\nletter from an exalted member of the imperial family, who had had the\nhigh and gratifying distinction of making Mr. Phoebus's acquaintance\nin London, personally pressing the acceptance by him of the general\nproposition, assuring him of cordial welcome and support, and informing\nMr. Phoebus that what was particularly desired at this moment was a\nseries of paintings illustrative of some of the most memorable scenes\nin the Holy Land and especially the arrival of the pilgrims of the Greek\nrite at Jerusalem. As for this purpose he would probably like to visit\nPalestine, the whole of the autumn or even a longer period was placed at\nhis disposal; so that, enriched with all necessary drawings and studies,\nhe might achieve his more elaborate performances in Russia at his\nleisure and with every advantage.\n\nConsidering that the great objects in life with Mr. Phoebus were to live\nin an Aryan country, amid an Aryan race, and produce works which should\nrevive for the benefit of human nature Aryan creeds, a proposition to\npass some of the prime years of his life among the Mongolian race, and\nat the same time devote his pencil to the celebration Semitic subjects,\nwas startling.\n\n\"I shall say nothing to Madame Phoebus until the prince has gone,\" he\nremarked to Lothair; \"he will go the day after to-morrow. I do not know\nwhat they may offer to make me--probably only a baron, perhaps a count.\nBut you know in Russia a man may become a prince, and I certainly should\nlike those Cantacuzenes to feel that after all their daughter is a\nprincess with no thanks to them. The climate is detestable, but one owes\nmuch to one's profession. Art would be honored at a great, perhaps the\ngreatest, court. There would not be a fellow at his easel in the\nstreets about Fitzroy Square who would not be prouder. I wonder what\nthe decoration will be? 'Of a high class'--vague. It might be Alexander\nNewsky. You know you have a right, whatever your decoration, to have\nit expressed, of course at your own expense, in brilliants. I confess I\nhave my weaknesses. I should like to get over to the Academy dinner--one\ncan do any thing in these days of railroads--and dine with the R. A's\nin my ribbon and the star of the Alexander Newsky in brilliants. I think\nevery academician would feel elevated. What I detest are their Semitic\nsubjects--nothing but drapery. They cover even their heads in those\nscorching climes. Can any one make any thing of a caravan of pilgrims?\nTo be sure, they say no one can draw a camel. If I went to Jerusalem, a\ncamel would at last be drawn. There is something in that. We must think\nover these things, and when the prince has gone talk it over with\nMadame Phoebus. I wish you all to come to a wise decision, without the\nslightest reference to my individual tastes or, it may be, prejudices.\"\n\nThe result of all this was that Mr. Phoebus, without absolutely\ncommitting himself, favorably entertained the general proposition of the\nRussian court; while, with respect to their particular object in art, he\nagreed to visit Palestine and execute at least one work for his imperial\nfriend and patron. He counted on reaching Jerusalem before the Easter\npilgrims returned to their homes.\n\n\"If they would make me a prince at once, and give me the Alexander\nNewsky in brilliants, it might be worth thinking of,\" he said to\nLothair.\n\nThe ladies, though they loved their isle, were quite delighted with\nthe thought of going to Jerusalem. Madame Phoebus knew a Russian\ngrand-duchess who had boasted to her that she had been both to Jerusalem\nand Torquay, and Madame Phoebus had felt quite ashamed that she had been\nto neither.\n\n\"I suppose you will feel quite at home there,\" said Euphrosyne to\nLothair.\n\n\"No; I never was there.\"\n\n\"No; but you know all about those places and people--holy places and\nholy persons. The Blessed Virgin did not, I believe, appear to you. It\nwas to a young lady, was it not? We were asking each other last night\nwho the young lady could be.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 76\n\n\nTime, which changes every thing, is changing even the traditionary\nappearance of forlorn Jerusalem. Not that its mien, after all, was ever\nvery sad. Its airy site, its splendid mosque, its vast monasteries, the\nbright material of which the whole city is built, its cupolaed houses\nof freestone, and above all the towers and gates and battlements of its\nlofty and complete walls, always rendered it a handsome city. Jerusalem\nhas not been sacked so often or so recently as the other two great\nancient cities, Rome and Athens. Its vicinage was never more desolate\nthan the Campagna, or the state of Attica and the Morea in 1830.\n\nThe battle-field of western Asia from the days of the Assyrian kings\nto those of Mehemet Ali, Palestine endured the same devastation as in\nmodern times has been the doom of Flanders and the Milanese; but the\nyears of havoc in the Low Countries and Lombardy must be counted in\nPalestine by centuries. Yet the wide plains of the Holy Land, Sharon,\nand Shechem, and Esdraelon, have recovered; they are as fertile and as\nfair as in old days; it is the hill-culture that has been destroyed, and\nthat is the culture on which Jerusalem mainly depended. Its hills were\nterraced gardens, vineyards, and groves of olive-trees. And here it\nis that we find renovation. The terraces are again ascending the stony\nheights, and the eye is frequently gladdened with young plantations.\nFruit-trees, the peach and the pomegranate, the almond and the fig,\noffer gracious groups; and the true children of the land, the vine and\nthe olive, are again exulting in their native soil.\n\nThere is one spot, however, which has been neglected, and yet the one\nthat should have been the first remembered, as it has been the most\nrudely wasted. Blessed be the hand which plants trees upon Olivet!\nBlessed be the hand that builds gardens about Sion!\n\nThe most remarkable creation, however, in modern Jerusalem is the\nRussian settlement which within a few years has risen on the elevated\nground on the western side of the city. The Latin, the Greek, and the\nArmenian Churches had for centuries possessed enclosed establishments\nin the city, which, under the name of monasteries, provided shelter and\nprotection for hundreds--it might be said even thousands--of pilgrims\nbelonging to their respective rites. The great scale, therefore, on\nwhich Russia secured hospitality for her subjects was not in reality\nso remarkable as the fact that it seemed to indicate a settled\ndetermination to separate the Muscovite Church altogether from the\nGreek, and throw off what little dependence is still acknowledged on the\nPatriarchate of Constantinople. Whatever the motive, the design has been\naccomplished on a large scale. The Russian buildings, all well defended,\nare a caravanserai, a cathedral, a citadel. The consular flag crowns the\nheight and indicates the office of administration; priests and monks are\npermanent inhabitants, and a whole caravan of Muscovite pilgrim and the\ntrades on which they depend can be accommodated within the precinct.\n\nMr. Phoebus, his family and suite, were to be the guests of the Russian\nconsul, and every preparation was made to insure the celebrated\npainter a becoming reception. Frequent telegrams had duly impressed the\nrepresentative of all the Russias in the Holy Land with the importance\nof his impending visitor. Even the qualified and strictly provisional\nacceptance of the Russian proposition by Mr. Phoebus had agitated the\nwires of Europe scarcely less than a suggested conference.\n\n\"An artist should always remember what he owes to posterity and his\nprofession,\" said Mr. Phoebus to Lothair, as they were walking the deck,\n\"even if you can distinguish between them, which I doubt, for it is only\nby a sense of the beautiful that the human family can be sustained\nin Its proper place in the scale of creation, and the sense of the\nbeautiful is a result of the study of the fine arts. It would be\nsomething to sow the seeds of organic change in the Mongolian type, but\nI am nor sanguine of success. There is no original fund of aptitude to\nact upon. The most ancient of existing communities is Turanian, and yet,\nthough they could invent gunpowder and the mariner's compass, they never\ncould understand perspective.--Man ahead there! tell Madame Phoebus to\ncome on deck for the first sight of Mount Lebanon.\"\n\nWhen the Pan entered the port of Joppa they observed another English\nyacht in those waters; but, before they could speculate on its owner,\nthey were involved in all the complications of landing. On the quay, the\nRussian vice-consul was in attendance with horses and mules, and\ndonkeys handsomer than either. The ladies were delighted with the vast\norange-gardens of Joppa, which Madame Phoebus said realized quite her\nidea of the Holy Land.\n\n\"I was prepared for milk and honey,\" said Euphrosyne, \"but this is too\ndelightful,\" as she travelled through lanes of date-bearing palm-trees,\nand sniffed with her almond-shaped nostrils the all-pervading fragrance.\n\nThey passed the night at Arimathea, a pretty village surrounded\nwith gardens enclosed with hedges of prickly pear. Here they found\nhospitality, in an old convent, but all the comforts of Europe and many\nof the refinements of Asia had been forwarded for their accommodations.\n\n\"It is a great homage to art,\" said Mr. Phoebus, as he scattered his\ngold like a great seigneur of Gascony.\n\nThe next day, two miles from Jerusalem, the consul met them with a\ncavalcade, and the ladies assured their host that they were not at all\nwearied with their journey, but were quite prepared, in due time, to\njoin his dinner-party, which he was most anxious they should attend, as\nhe had \"two English lords\" who had arrived, and whom he had invited\nto meet them. They were all curious to know their names, though that,\nunfortunately, the consul could not tell them, but he had sent to the\nEnglish consulate to have them written down. All he could assure them\nwas, that they were real English lords, not travelling English lords,\nbut in sober earnestness great personages.\n\nMr. Phoebus was highly gratified. He was pleased with his reception.\nThere was nothing he liked much more than a procession. He was also a\nsincere admirer of the aristocracy of his country. \"On the whole,\"\nhe would say, \"they most resemble the old Hellenic race; excelling in\nathletic sports, speaking no other language than their own, and never\nreading.\"\n\n\"Your fault,\" he would sometimes say to Lothair, \"and the cause of many\nof your sorrows, is the habit of mental introspection. Man is born to\nobserve, but if he falls into psychology he observes nothing, and then\nhe is astonished that life has no charms for him, or that, never seizing\nthe occasion, his career is a failure. No, sir, it is the eye that must\nbe occupied and cultivated; no one knows the capacity of the eye who has\nnot developed it, or the visions of beauty and delight and inexhaustible\ninterest which it commands. To a man who observes, life is as different\nas the existence of a dreaming psychologist is to that of the animals of\nthe field.\"\n\n\"I fear,\" said Lothair, \"that I have at length found out the truth, and\nthat I am a dreaming psychologist.\"\n\n\"You are young and not irremediably lost,\" said Mr. Phoebus.\n\"Fortunately, you have received the admirable though partial education\nof your class. You are a good shot, you can ride, you can row, you can\nswim. That imperfect secretion of the brain which is called thought has\nnot yet bowed your frame. You have not had time to read much. Give it up\naltogether. The conversation of a woman like Theodora is worth all the\nlibraries in the world. If it were only for her sake, I should wish\nto save you, but I wish to do it for your own. Yes, profit by the vast\nthough calamitous experience which you have gained in a short time. We\nmay know a great deal about our bodies, we can know very little about\nour minds.\"\n\nThe \"real English lords\" turned out to be Bertram and St. Aldegonde,\nreturning from Nubia. They had left England about the same time as\nLothair, and had paired together on the Irish Church till Easter, with a\nsort of secret hope on the part of St. Aldegonde that they might neither\nof them reappear in the House of Commons again until the Irish Church\nwere either saved or subverted. Holy Week had long passed, and they were\nat Jerusalem, not quite so near the House of Commons as the Reform\nClub or the Carlton, but still St. Aldegonde had mentioned that he\nwas beginning to be bored with Jerusalem, and Bertram counted on their\nimmediate departure when they accepted the invitation to dine with the\nRussian consul.\n\nLothair was unaffectedly delighted to meet Bertram, and glad to see\nSt. Aldegonde, but he was a little nervous and embarrassed as to the\nprobable tone of his reception by them. But their manner relieved him in\nan instant, for he saw they knew nothing of his adventures.\n\n\"Well,\" said St. Aldegonde, \"what have you been doing with yourself\nsince we last met? I wish you had come with us, and had a shot at a\ncrocodile.\"\n\nBertram told Lothair in the course of the evening that he found letters\nat Cairo from Corisande, on his return, in which there was a good deal\nabout Lothair, and which had made him rather uneasy. \"That there was a\nrumor you had been badly wounded, and some other things,\" and Bertram\nlooked him full in the face; \"but I dare say not a word of truth.\"\n\n\"I was never better in my life,\" said Lothair, \"and I have been in\nSicily and in Greece. However, we will talk over all this another time.\"\n\nThe dinner at the consulate was, one of the most successful banquets\nthat was ever given, if to please your guests be the test of good\nfortune in such enterprises. St. Aldegonde was perfectly charmed with\nthe Phoebus family; he did not know which to admire most--the great\nartist, who was in remarkable spirits to-day, considering he was in a\nSemitic country, or his radiant wife, or his brilliant sister-in-law.\nSt. Aldegonde took an early opportunity of informing Bertram that if he\nliked to go over and vote for the Irish Church he would release him from\nhis pair with the greatest pleasure, but for his part he had not the\nslightest intention of leaving Jerusalem at present. Strange to say,\nBertram received this intimation without a murmur. He was not so loud\nin his admiration of the Phoebus family as St. Aldegonde, but there is\na silent sentiment sometimes more expressive than the noisiest applause,\nand more dangerous. Bertram had sat next to Euphrosyne, and was entirely\nspell-bound.\n\nThe consul's wife, a hostess not unworthy of such guests, had\nentertained her friends in the European style. The dinner-hour was not\nlate, and the gentlemen who attended the ladies from the dinner-table\nwere allowed to remain some time in the saloon. Lothair talked much to\nthe consul's wife, by whose side sat Madame Phoebus. St. Aldegonde was\nalways on his legs, distracted by the rival attractions of that lady and\nher husband. More remote, Bertram whispered to Euphrosyne, who answered\nhim with laughing eyes.\n\nAt a certain hour, the consul, attended by his male guests, crossing a\ncourt, proceeded to his divan, a lofty and capacious chamber painted in\nfresco, and with no furniture except the low but broad raised seat that\nsurrounded the room. Here, when they were seated, an equal number of\nattendants--Arabs in Arab dress, blue gowns, and red slippers, and red\ncaps--entered, each proffering a long pipe of cherry or jasmine wood.\nThen, in a short time, guests dropped in, and pipes and coffee were\nimmediately brought to them. Any person who had been formally presented\nto the consul had this privilege, without any further invitation. The\nsociety often found in these consular divans in the more remote places\nof the East--Cairo, Damascus, Jerusalem--is often extremely entertaining\nand instructive. Celebrated travellers, distinguished men of science,\nartists, adventurers who ultimately turn out to be heroes, eccentric\ncharacters of all kinds, are here encountered, and give the fruits of\ntheir original or experienced observation without reserve.\n\n\"It is the smoking-room over again,\" whispered St. Aldegonde to Lothair,\n\"only in England one is so glad to get away from the women, but here I\nmust say I should have liked to remain behind.\"\n\nAn individual in a Syrian dress, fawn-colored robes girdled with a rich\nshawl, and a white turban, entered. He made his salute with grace and\ndignity to the consul, touching his forehead, his lip, and his heart,\nand took his seat with the air of one not unaccustomed to be received,\nplaying, until he received his chibouque, with a chaplet of beads.\n\n\"That is a good-looking fellow, Lothair,\" said St. Aldegonde; \"or is it\nthe dress that turns them out such swells? I feel quite a lout by some\nof these fellows.\"\n\n\"I think he would be good-looking in any dress,\" said Lothair. \"A\nremarkable countenance.\"\n\nIt was an oval visage, with features in harmony with that form; large\ndark-brown eyes and lashes, and brows delicately but completely defined;\nno hair upon the face except a beard, full but not long. He seemed about\nthe same age as Mr. Phoebus, and his complexion, though pale, was clear\nand fair.\n\nThe conversation, after some rambling, had got upon the Suez Canal. Mr.\nPhoebus did not care for the political or the commercial consequences of\nthat great enterprise, but he was glad that a natural division should\nbe established between the greater races and the Ethiopian. It might not\nlead to any considerable result, but it asserted a principle. He looked\nupon that trench as a protest.\n\n\"But would you place the Nilotic family in the Ethiopian race?\" inquired\nthe Syrian in a voice commanding from its deep sweetness.\n\n\"I would certainly. The were Cushim, and that means negroes.\"\n\nThe Syrian did not agree with Mr. Phoebus; he stated his views firmly\nand, clearly, but without urging them. He thought that we must look to\nthe Pelasgi as the colonizing race that had peopled and produced Egypt.\nThe mention of the Pelasgi fired Mr. Phoebus to even unusual\neloquence. He denounced the Pelasgi as a barbarous race: men of gloomy\nsuperstitions, who, had it not been for the Hellenes, might have fatally\narrested the human development. The triumph of the Hellenes was the\ntriumph of the beautiful, and all that is great and good in life was\nowing to their victory.\n\n\"It is difficult to ascertain what is great in life,\" said the Syrian,\n\"because nations differ on the subject and ages. Some, for example,\nconsider war to be a great thing, others condemn it. I remember also\nwhen patriotism was a boast, and now it is a controversy. But it is not\nso difficult to ascertain what is good. For man has in his own being\nsome guide to such knowledge, and divine aid to acquire it has not\nbeen wanting to him. For my part I could not maintain that the Hellenic\nsystem led to virtue.\"\n\nThe conversation was assuming an ardent character when the consul, as a\ndiplomatist, turned the channel. Mr. Phoebus had vindicated the Hellenic\nreligion, the Syrian, with a terse protest against the religion of\nNature, however idealized, as tending to the corruption of man, had let\nthe question die away, and the Divan were discussing dromedaries,\nand dancing-girls, and sherbet made of pomegranate, which the consul\nrecommended and ordered to be produced. Some of the guests retired, and\namong them the Syrian with the same salute and the same graceful dignity\nas had distinguished his entrance.\n\n\"Who is that man?\" said Mr. Phoebus. \"I met him at Rome ten years ago.\nBaron Mecklenburg brought him to me to paint for my great picture of\nSt. John, which is in the gallery of Munich. He said in his way--you\nremember his way--that he would bring me a face of Paradise.\"\n\n\"I cannot exactly tell you his name,\" said the consul. \"Prince Galitzin\nbrought him here, and thought highly of him. I believe he is one of the\nold Syrian families in the mountain; but whether he be a Maronite or a\nDruse, or any thing else, I really cannot say. Now try the sherbet.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 77\n\n\nThere are few things finer than the morning view of Jerusalem from the\nMount of Olives. The fresh and golden light falls on a walled city with\nturrets and towers and frequent gates: the houses of freestone, with\nterraced or oval roofs, sparkle in the sun, while the cupolaed pile of\nthe Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the vast monasteries, and the broad\nsteep of Sion crowned with the tower of David, vary the monotony of the\ngeneral masses of building. But the glory of the scene is the Mosque of\nOmar as it rises on its broad platform of marble from the deep ravine\nof Kedron, with its magnificent dome high in the air, its arches and\ngardened courts, and its ornaments glittering amid the cedar, the\ncypress, and the palm.\n\nReclining on Olivet, Lothair, alone and in charmed abstraction, gazed on\nthe wondrous scene. Since his arrival at Jerusalem he lived much apart,\nnor had he found difficulty in effecting this isolation. Mr. Phoebus had\nalready established a studio on a considerable scale, and was engaged\nin making sketches of pilgrims and monks, tall donkeys of Bethlehem with\nstarry fronts, in which he much delighted, and grave Jellaheen sheiks,\nwho were hanging about the convents in the hopes of obtaining a convoy\nto the Dead Sea. As for St. Aldegonde and Bertram, they passed their\nlives at the Russian consulate, or with its most charming inhabitants.\nThis morning, with the consul and his wife and the matchless sisters, as\nSt. Aldegonde always termed them, they had gone on an excursion to the\nConvent of the Nativity. Dinner usually reassembled all the party, and\nthen the Divan followed.\n\n\"I say, Bertram,\" said St. Aldegonde, \"what a lucky thing we paired and\nwent to Nubia! I rejoice in the Divan, and yet, somehow, I cannot bear\nleaving those women. If the matchless sisters would only smoke, by Jove\nthey would be perfect!\"\n\n\"I should not like Euphrosyne to smoke,\" said Bertram.\n\nA person approached Lothair by the pathway from Bethany. It was the\nSyrian gentleman whom he had met at the consulate. As he was passing\nLothair, he saluted him with the grace which had been before remarked,\nand Lothair, who was by nature courteous, and even inclined a little\nto ceremony in his manners, especially with those with whom he was not\nintimate, immediately rose, as he would not receive such a deputation in\na reclining posture.\n\n\"Let me not disturb you,\" said the stranger, \"or, if we must be on equal\nterms, let me also be seated, for this is a view that never palls.\"\n\n\"It is perhaps familiar to you,\" said Lothair, \"but with me, only a\npilgrim, its effect is fascinating, almost overwhelming.\"\n\n\"The view of Jerusalem never becomes familiar,\" said the Syrian, \"for\nits associations are so transcendent, so various, so inexhaustible, that\nthe mind can never anticipate its course of thought and feeling, when\none sits, as we do now, on this immortal mount.\"\n\n\"I presume you live here?\" said Lothair.\n\n\"Not exactly,\" said his companion. \"I have recently built a house\nwithout the walls, and I have planted my hill with fruit-trees, and\nmade vineyards and olive-grounds, but I have done this as much--perhaps\nmore--to set an example, which, I am glad, to say, has been followed,\nas for my own convenience or pleasure. My home is in the north of\nPalestine, on the other side of, Jordan, beyond the Sea of Galilee. My\nfamily has dwelt there from time immemorial; but they always loved this\ncity, and have a legend that they dwelt occasionally within its walls,\neven in the days when Titus from that hill looked down upon the temple.\"\n\n\"I have often wished to visit the Sea of Galilee,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"Well, you have now an opportunity,\" said the Syrian; \"the north of\nPalestine, though it has no topical splendor, has much variety and a\npeculiar natural charm. The burst and brightness of spring have not yet\nquite vanished: you would find our plains radiant with wild-flowers, and\nour hills green with young crops; and, though we cannot rival Lebanon,\nwe have forest glades among our famous hills that, when once seen, are\nremembered.\"\n\n\"But there is something to me more interesting than the splendor of\ntropical scenery,\" said Lothair, \"even if Galilee could offer it. I wish\nto visit the cradle of my faith.\"\n\n\"And you would do wisely,\" said the Syrian, \"for there is no doubt the\nspiritual nature of man is developed in this land.\"\n\n\"And yet there are persons at the present day who doubt--even deny--the\nspiritual nature of man,\" said Lothair. \"I do not, I could not--there\nare reasons why I could not.\"\n\n\"There are some things I know, and some things I believe,\" said the\nSyrian. \"I know that I have a soul, and I believe that it is immortal.\"\n\n\"It is science that, by demonstrating the insignificance of this\nglobe in the vast scale of creation, has led to this infidelity,\" said\nLothair.\n\n\"Science may prove the insignificance of this globe in the scale of\ncreation,\" said the stranger, \"but it cannot prove the insignificance of\nman. What is the earth compared with the sun? a molehill by a mountain;\nyet the inhabitants of this earth can discover the elements of which\nthe great orb consists, and will probably ere long ascertain all the\nconditions of its being. Nay, the human mind can penetrate far beyond\nthe sun. There is no relation, therefore, between the faculties of man\nand the scale in creation of the planet which he inhabits.\"\n\n\"I was glad to hear you assert the other night the spiritual nature of\nman in opposition to Mr. Phoebus.\"\n\n\"Ah! Mr. Phoebus!\" said the stranger, with a smile. \"He is an old\nacquaintance of mine. And I must say he is very consistent--except in\npaying a visit to Jerusalem. That does surprise me. He said to me the\nother night the same things as he said to me at Rome many years ago. He\nwould revive the worship of Nature. The deities whom he so eloquently\ndescribes and so exquisitely delineates are the ideal personifications\nof the most eminent human qualities, and chiefly the physical. Physical\nbeauty is his standard of excellence, and he has a fanciful theory that\nmoral order would be the consequence of the worship of physical beauty,\nfor without moral order he holds physical beauty cannot be maintained.\nBut the answer to Mr. Phoebus is, that his system has been tried and\nhas failed, and under conditions more favorable than are likely to\nexist again; the worship of Nature ended in the degradation of the human\nrace.\"\n\n\"But Mr. Phoebus cannot really believe in Apollo and Venus,\" said\nLothair. \"These are phrases. He is, I suppose, what is called a\nPantheist.\"\n\n\"No doubt the Olympus of Mr. Phoebus is the creation of his easel,\"\nreplied the Syrian. \"I should not, however, describe him as a Pantheist,\nwhose creed requires more abstraction than Mr. Phoebus, the worshipper\nof nature, would tolerate. His school never care to pursue any\ninvestigation which cannot be followed by the eye--and the worship of\nthe beautiful always ends in an orgy. As for Pantheism, it is Atheism in\ndomino. The belief in a Creator who is unconscious of creating is more\nmonstrous than any dogma of any of the Churches in this city, and we\nhave them all here.\"\n\n\"But there are people now who tell you that there never was any\nCreation, and therefore there never could have been a Creator,\" said\nLothair.\n\n\"And which is now advanced with the confidences of novelty,\" said the\nSyrian, \"though all of it has been urged, and vainly urged, thousands of\nyears ago. There must be design, or all we see would be without sense,\nand I do not believe in the unmeaning. As for the natural forces to\nwhich all creation is now attributed, we know they are unconscious,\nwhile consciousness is as inevitable a portion of our existence as the\neye or the hand. The conscious cannot be derived from the unconscious.\nMan is divine.\"\n\n\"I wish I could assure myself of the personality of the Creator,\" said\nLothair. \"I cling to that, but they say it is unphilosophical.\"\n\n\"In what sense?\" asked the Syrian. \"Is it more unphilosophical to\nbelieve in a personal God, omnipotent and omniscient, than in natural\nforces unconscious and irresistible? Is it unphilosophical to combine\npower with intelligence? Goethe, a Spinozist who did not believe in\nSpinoza, said that he could bring his mind to the conception that in the\ncentre of space we might meet with a monad of pure intelligence. What\nmay be the centre of space I leave to the daedal imagination of the\nauthor of 'Faust;' but a monad of pure intelligence--is that more\nphilosophical than the truth, first revealed to man amid these\neverlasting hills,\" said the Syrian, \"that God made man in His own\nimage?\"\n\n\"I have often found in that assurance a source of sublime consolation,\"\nsaid Lothair.\n\n\"It is the charter of the nobility of man,\" said the Syrian, \"one of the\ndivine dogmas revealed in this land; not the invention of councils, not\none of which was held on this sacred soil, confused assemblies first\ngot together by the Greeks, and then by barbarous nations in barbarous\ntimes.\"\n\n\"Yet the divine land no longer tells us divine things,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"It may or it may not have fulfilled its destiny,\" said the Syrian. \"'In\nmy Father's house are many mansions,' and by the various families of\nnations the designs of the Creator are accomplished. God works by races,\nand one was appointed in due season and after many developments to\nreveal and expound in this land the spiritual nature of man. The Aryan\nand the Semite are of the same blood and origin, but when they quitted\ntheir central land they were ordained to follow opposite courses. Each\ndivision of the great race has developed one portion of the double\nnature of humanity, till, after all their wanderings, they met again,\nand, represented by their two choicest families, the Hellenes and the\nHebrews, brought together the treasures of their accumulated wisdom, and\nsecured the civilization of man.\"\n\n\"Those among whom I have lived of late,\" said Lothair, \"have taught me\nto trust much in councils, and to believe that without them there could\nbe no foundation for the Church. I observe you do not speak in that\nvein, though, like myself, you find solace in those dogmas which\nrecognize the relations between the created and the Creator.\"\n\n\"There can be no religion without that recognition,\" said the Syrian,\n\"and no creed can possibly be devised without such a recognition that\nwould satisfy man. Why we are here, whence we come, whither we go--these\nare questions which man is organically framed and forced to ask himself,\nand that would not be the case if they could not be answered. As for\nchurches depending on councils, the first council was held more than\nthree centuries after the Sermon on the Mount. We Syrians had churches\nin the interval: no one can deny that. I bow before the Divine decree\nthat swept them away from Antioch to Jerusalem, but I am not yet\nprepared to transfer my spiritual allegiance to Italian popes and Greek\npatriarchs. We believe that our family were among the first followers of\nJesus, and that we then held lands in Bashan which we hold now. We had\na gospel once in our district where there was some allusion to this, and\nbeing written by neighbors, and probably at the time, I dare say it\nwas accurate, but the Western Churches declared our gospel was not\nauthentic, though why I cannot tell, and they succeeded in extirpating\nit. It was not an additional reason why we, should enter into their\nfold. So I am content to dwell in Galilee and trace the footsteps of my\nDivine Master, musing over His life and pregnant sayings amid the mounts\nHe sanctified and the waters He loved so well.\"\n\nThe sun was now rising in the heavens, and the hour had arrived when it\nbecame expedient to seek the shade. Lothair and the Syrian rose at the\nsame time.\n\n\"I shall not easily forget our conversation on the Mount of Olives,\"\nsaid Lothair, \"and I would ask you to add to this kindness by permitting\nme, before I leave Jerusalem, to pay my respects to you under your\nroof.\"\n\n\"Peace be with you!\" said the Syrian. \"I live without the gate of\nDamascus, on a hill which you will easily recognize, and my name is\nPARACLETE.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 78\n\n\nTime passed very agreeably to St. Aldegonde and Bertram at Jerusalem,\nfor it was passed entirely at the Russian consulate, or with its\ninteresting and charming inmates, who were always making excursions, or,\nas they styled them, pilgrimages. They saw little of Lothair, who would\nwillingly have conversed with his friend on many topics, but his friend\nwas almost always engaged, and, if by some chance they succeeded in\nfinding themselves alone, Bertram appeared to be always preoccupied.\nOne day he said to Lothair: \"I tell you what, old fellow, if you want\nto know all about what has happened at home, I will give you Corisande's\nletters. They are a sort of journal which she promised to keep for me,\nand they will tell you every thing. I found an immense packet of them on\nour return from Cairo, and I meant to have read them here; but I do not\nknow how it is--I suppose there is so much to be seen here--but I never\nseem to have a moment to myself. I have got an engagement now to the\nconsulate. We are going to Elisha's Fountain to-day. Why do not you\ncome?\"\n\n\"Well, I am engaged too,\" said Lothair. \"I have settled to go to the\nTombs of the Kings to-day, with Signor Paraclete, and I cannot well get\noff; but remember the letters.\"\n\nThe box of letters arrived at Lothair's rooms in due season, and their\nperusal deeply interested him. In their pages, alike earnest and lively,\nand a picture of a mind of high intelligence adorned with fancy\nand feeling, the name of Lothair frequently appeared, and sometimes\naccompanied with expressions that made his heart beat. All the rumors\nof his adventures, as they gradually arrived in England, generally\ndistorted, were duly chronicled, and sometimes with comments, which\nintimated the interest they occasioned to the correspondent of Bertram.\nMore than once she could not refrain from reproaching her brother for\nhaving left his friend so much to himself. \"Of all your friends,\" she\nsaid, \"the one who always most interested me, and seemed most worthy of\nyour affection.\" And then she deplored the absolute ruin of Lothair, for\nsuch she deemed his entrance into the Roman Church.\n\n\"I was right in my appreciation of that woman, though I was utterly\ninexperienced in life,\" thought Lothair. \"If her mother had only favored\nmy views two years ago, affairs would have been different. Would they\nhave been better? Can they be worse? But I have gained experience.\nCertainly; and paid for it with my heart's blood. And might I not have\ngained experience tranquilly, in the discharge of the duties of my\nposition at home--dear home? Perhaps not. And suppose I never had gained\nexperience, I still might have been happy? And what am I now? Most lone\nand sad. So lone and sad that nothing but the magical influence of the\nscene around me saves me from an overwhelming despondency.\"\n\nLothair passed his life chiefly with Paraclete, and, a few weeks after\ntheir first acquaintance, they left Jerusalem together for Galilee.\n\nThe month of May had disappeared, and June was advancing. Bertram and\nSaint Aldegonde no longer talked about their pair, and their engagements\nin the House of Commons. There seemed a tacit understanding between\nthem to avoid the subject; remarkable on the part of Bertram, for he had\nalways been urgent on his brother-in-law to fulfil their parliamentary\nobligation.\n\nThe party at the Russian consulate had gone on a grand expedition to the\nDead Sea, and had been absent for many days from Jerusalem. They were\nconveyed by one of the sheiks of the Jordan valley. It was a most\nsuccessful expedition--constant adventure, novel objects and habits, all\nthe spell of a romantic life. The ladies were delighted with the scenery\nof the Jordan valley, and the gentlemen had good sport; St. Aldegonde\nhad killed a wild-boar, and Bertram an ibex, whose horns were preserved\nfor Brentham. Mr. Phoebus intensely studied the camel and its habits. He\npersuaded himself that the ship of the desert entirely understood him.\n\"But it is always so,\" he added. \"There is no animal that in a week does\nnot perfectly comprehend me. Had I time and could give myself up to it,\nI have no doubt I could make them speak. Nature has endowed me, so far\nas dumb animals are concerned, with a peculiar mesmeric power.\"\n\nAt last this happy caravan was again within sight of the walls of\nJerusalem.\n\n\"I should like to have remained in the valley of the Jordan forever,\"\nsaid St. Aldegonde.\n\n\"And so should I,\" whispered Bertram to Euphrosyne, \"with the same\ncompanions.\"\n\nWhen they had returned to the consulate, they found the post from\nEngland had arrived during their absence. There were dispatches for all.\nIt is an agitating moment--that arrival of letters in a distant land.\nLord St. Aldegonde seemed much disturbed when he tore open and perused\nhis. His countenance became clouded; he dashed his hand through his\ndishevelled locks; he pouted; and then he said to Bertram, \"Come to my\nroom.\"\n\n\"Anything wrong at home?\"\n\n\"Not at home,\" said St. Aldegonde. \"Bertha is all right. But a most\ninfernal letter from Glyn--most insolent. If I do return I will vote\nagainst them. But I will not return. I have made up my mind to that.\nPeople are so selfish,\" exclaimed St. Aldegonde, with indignation. \"They\nnever think of any thing but themselves.\"\n\n\"Show me his letter,\" said Bertram. \"I have got a letter too; it is from\nthe duke.\"\n\nThe letter of the Opposition whip did not deserve the epithets ascribed\nto it by St. Aldegonde. It was urgent and courteously peremptory; but,\nconsidering the circumstances of the case, by no means too absolute.\nPaired to Easter by great indulgence, St. Aldegonde was passing\nWhitsuntide at Jerusalem. The parliamentary position was critical, and\nthe future of the Opposition seemed to depend on the majority by which\ntheir resolutions on the Irish Church were sent up to the House of\nLords.\n\n\"Well,\" said Bertram. \"I see nothing to complain of in that letter.\nExcept a little more urgency, it is almost the same language as reached\nus at Cairo, and then you said Glyn was a capital fellow, and seemed\nquite pleased.\"\n\n\"Yes, because I hated Egypt,\" said St. Aldegonde. \"I hated the pyramids,\nand I was disappointed with the dancing-girls; and it seemed to me\nthat, if it had not been for the whip, we never should have been able to\nescape. But things are very different now.\"\n\n\"Yes, they are,\" said Bertram, in a melancholy tone.\n\n\"You do not think of returning?\" said St. Aldegonde.\n\n\"Instantly,\" replied Bertram. \"I have a letter from the duke which is\nperemptory. The county is dissatisfied with my absence. And mine is\na queer constituency; very numerous and several large towns; the\npopularity of my family gained me the seat, not their absolute\ninfluence.\"\n\n\"My constituents never trouble me,\" said St. Aldegonde.\n\n\"You have none,\" said Bertram.\n\n\"Well, if I were member for a metropolitan district I would hot budge.\nAnd I little thought you would have deserted me.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" sighed Bertram. \"You're discontented, because your amusements are\ninterrupted. But think of my position, torn from a woman whom I adore.\"\n\n\"Well, you know you must have left her sooner or later,\" urged St.\nAldegonde.\n\n\"Why?\" asked Bertram.\n\n\"You know what Lothair told us. She is engaged to her cousin the Prince\nof Samos, and--\"\n\n\"If I had only the Prince of Samos to deal with, I should care little,\"\nsaid Bertram.\n\n\"Why, what do you mean?\"\n\n\"That Euphrosyne is mine, if my family will sanction our union, but not\notherwise.\"\n\nSt. Aldegonde gave a long whistle, and he added, \"I wish Bertha were\nhere. She is the only person I know who has a head.\"\n\n\"You see, my dear Granville, while you are talking of your little\ndisappointments, I am involved in awful difficulties.\"\n\n\"You are sure about the Palace of Samos?\"\n\n\"Clear your head of that. There is no engagement of any kind between\nhim and Euphrosyne. The visit to the island was only a preliminary\nceremony--just to show himself. No doubt the father wishes the alliance;\nnor is there any reason to suppose that it would be disagreeable to the\nson; but, I repeat it--no engagement exists.\"\n\n\"If I were not your brother-in-law, I should have been very glad to have\nmarried Euphrosyne myself,\" said St. Aldegonde.\n\n\"Yes, but what am I to do?\" asked Bertram, rather impatiently.\n\n\"It will not do to write to Brentham,\" said St. Aldegonde, gravely;\n\"that I see clearly.\" Then, after musing a while, he added: \"I am vexed\nto leave our friends here and shall miss them sadly. They are the most\nagreeable people I ever knew. I never enjoyed myself so much. But we\nmust think of nothing but your affairs. We must return instantly. The\nwhip will be an excuse, but the real business will be Euphrosyne. I\nshould delight in having her for a sister-in-law, but the affair will\nrequire management. We can make short work of getting home: steam to\nMarseilles, leave the yacht there, and take the railroad. I have half\na mind to telegraph to Bertha to meet us there. She would be of great\nuse.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 79\n\n\nLothair was delighted with Galilee, and particularly with the blue\nwaters of its lake slumbering beneath the surrounding hills. Of all its\nonce pleasant towns, Tiberias alone remains, and that in ruins from a\nrecent earthquake. But where are Chorazin, and Bethsaida, and Capernaum?\nA group of hovels and an ancient tower still bear the magic name of\nMagdala, and all around are green mounts and gentle slopes, the scenes\nof miracles that softened the heart of man, and of sermons that never\ntire his ear. Dreams passed over Lothair of settling forever on the\nshores of these waters, and of reproducing all their vanished happiness:\nrebuilding their memorable cities, reviving their fisheries, cultivating\nthe plain of Gennesaret and the country of the Gadarenes, and making\nresearches in this cradle of pure and primitive Christianity.\n\nThe heritage of Paraclete was among the oaks of Bashan, a lofty land,\nrising suddenly from the Jordan valley, verdant and well watered, and\nclothed in many parts with forest; there the host of Lothair resided\namong his lands and people, and himself dwelt in a stone and castellated\nbuilding, a portion of which was of immemorial antiquity, and where he\ncould rally his forces and defend himself in case of the irruption and\ninvasion of the desert tribes. And here one morn arrived a messenger\nfrom Jerusalem summoning Lothair back to that city, in consequence of\nthe intended departure of his friends.\n\nThe call was urgent, and was obeyed immediately with that promptitude\nwhich the manners of the East, requiring no preparation, admit.\nParaclete accompanied his guest. They had to cross the Jordan, and then\nto trace their way till they reached the southern limit of the plain\nof Esdraelon, from whence they counted on the following day to reach\nJerusalem. While they were encamped on this spot, a body of Turkish\nsoldiery seized all their horses, which were required, they said, by the\nPacha of Damascus, who was proceeding to Jerusalem, attending a great\nTurkish general, who was on a mission to examine the means of defence\nof Palestine on the Egyptian side. This was very vexatious, but one\nof those incidents of Eastern life against which it is impossible to\ncontend; so Lothair and Paraclete were obliged to take refuge in their\npipes beneath a huge and solitary sycamore-tree, awaiting the arrival of\nthe Ottoman magnificoes.\n\nThey came at last, a considerable force of cavalry, then mules and\nbarbarous carriages with the harem, all the riders and inmates enveloped\nin what appeared to be winding-sheets, white and shapeless; about them\neunuchs and servants. The staff of the pachas followed, preceding the\ngrandees who closed the march, mounted on Anatolian chargers.\n\nParaclete and Lothair had been obliged to leave the grateful shade of\nthe sycamore-tree, as the spot had been fixed on by the commander of the\nadvanced guard for the resting-place of the pachas. They were standing\naside and watching the progress of the procession, and contemplating the\nearliest opportunity of representing their grievances to high authority,\nwhen the Turkish general, or the seraskier, as the Syrians inaccurately\nstyled him, suddenly reined in his steed, and said, in a loud voice,\n\"Captain Muriel!\"\n\nLothair recognized the well-known voice of his commanding officer in\nthe Apennine, and advanced to him with a military salute. \"I must\nfirst congratulate you on being alive, which I hardly hoped,\" said the\ngeneral. \"Then let me know why you are here.\"\n\nAnd Lothair told him.\n\n\"Well, you shall have back your horses,\" said the general; \"and I will\nescort you to El Khuds. In the mean time you must be our guest;\" and he\npresented him to the Pacha of Damascus with some form. \"You and I have\nbivouacked in the open air before this, and not in so bland a clime.\"\n\nBeneath the shade of the patriarchal sycamore, the general narrated to\nLothair his adventures since they were fellow-combatants on the fatal\nfield of Mentana.\n\n\"When all was over,\" continued the general, \"I fled with Garibaldi, and\ngained the Italian frontier at Terrni. Here we were of course arrested\nby the authorities, but not very maliciously. I escaped one morning, and\ngot among the mountains in the neighborhood of our old camp. I had to\nwander about these parts for some time, for the Papalini were in the\nvicinity, and there was danger. It was a hard time; but I found a\nfriend now and then among the country people, though they are dreadfully\nsuperstitious. At last I got to the shore, and induced an honest fellow\nto put to sea in an open boat, on the chance of something turning up. It\ndid, in the shape of a brigantine from Elba bound for Corfu. Here I\nwas sure to find friends, for the brotherhood are strong in the Ionian\nIsles. And I began to look about for business. The Greeks made me some\noffers, but their schemes were all vanity, worse than the Irish. You\nremember our Fenian squabble? From something that transpired, I had made\nup my mind, so soon as I was well equipped, to go to Turkey. I had had\nsome transactions with the house of Cantacuzene, through the kindness of\nour dear friend whom we will never forget, but will never mention; and\nthrough them I became acquainted with the Prince of Samos, who is the\nchief of their house. He is in the entire confidence of Aali Pacha. I\nsoon found out that there was real business on the carpet. The Ottoman\narmy, after many trials and vicissitudes, is now in good case; and the\nPorte has resolved to stand no more nonsense either in this direction--\"\nand the general gave a significant glance--\"or in any other. But they\nwanted a general; they wanted a man who knew his business. I am not a\nGaribaldi, you know, and never pretended to be. I have no genius, or\nvolcanic fire, or that sort of thing; but I do presume to say, with\nfair troops, paid with tolerable regularity, a battery or two of rifled\ncannon, and a well-organized commissariat, I am not afraid of meeting\nany captain of my acquaintance, whatever his land or language. The Turks\nare a brave people, and there is nothing in their system, political or\nreligious, which jars with my convictions. In the army, which is all\nthat I much care for, there is the career of merit, and I can promote\nany able man that I recognize. As for their religion, they are tolerant\nand exact nothing from me; and if I had any religion except Madre\nNatura, I am not sure I would not prefer Islamism; which is at least\nsimple, and as little sacerdotal as any organized creed can be. The\nPorte made me a liberal offer, and I accepted it. It so happened that,\nthe moment I entered their service, I was wanted. They had a difficulty\non their Dalmatian frontier; I settled it in a way they liked. And now I\nam sent here with full powers, and am a pacha of the highest class, and\nwith a prospect of some warm work. I do not know what your views are,\nbut, if you would like a little more soldiering, I will put you on my\nstaff; and, for aught I know, we may find your winter-quarters at Grand\nCairo--they say a pleasant place for such a season.\"\n\n\"My soldiering has not been very fortunate,\" said Lothair; \"and I am not\nquite as great an admirer of the Turks as you are, general. My mind is\nrather on the pursuits of peace, and twenty hours ago I had a dream of\nsettling on the shores of the Sea of Galilee.\"\n\n\"Whatever you do,\" said the general, \"give up dreams.\"\n\n\"I think you may be right in that,\" said Lothair, with half a sigh.\n\n\"Action may not always be happiness,\" said the general; \"but there is\nno happiness without action. If you will not fight the Egyptians, were I\nyou, I would return home and plunge into affairs. That was a fine castle\nof yours I visited one morning; a man who lives in such a place must be\nable to find a great deal to do.\"\n\n\"I almost wish I were there, with you for my companion,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"The wheel may turn,\" said the general; \"but I begin to think I shall\nnot see much of Europe again. I have given it some of my best years and\nbest blood; and, if I had assisted in establishing the Roman republic,\nI should not have lived in vain; but the old imposture seems to me\nstronger than ever. I have got ten good years in me yet; and, if I\nbe well supported and in luck, for, after all, every thing depends on\nfortune, and manage to put a couple of hundred thousand men in perfect\ndiscipline, I may find some consolation for not blowing up St. Peter's,\nand may do something for the freedom of mankind on the banks of the\nDanube.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 80\n\n\nMrs. Putney Giles, in full toilet, was standing before the mantel-piece\nof her drawing-room in Hyde Park Gardens, and watching, with some\nanxiety, the clock that rested on it. It was the dinner-hour, and Mr.\nPutney Giles, particular in such matters, had not returned. No one\nlooked forward to his dinner, and a chat with his wife, with greater\nzest than Mr. Putney Giles; and he deserved the gratification which\nboth incidents afforded him, for he fairly earned it. Full of news and\nbustle, brimful of importance and prosperity, sunshiny and successful,\nhis daily return home--which, with many, perhaps most, men, is a process\nlugubriously monotonous--was in Hyde Park Gardens, even to Apollonia,\nwho possessed many means of amusement and occupation, a source ever of\ninterest and excitement.\n\nTo-day too, particularly, for their great client, friend, and patron,\nLothair, had arrived last night, from the Continent, at Muriel House,\nand had directed Mr. Putney Giles to be in attendance on him on the\nafternoon of this day.\n\nMuriel House was a family mansion in the Green Park. It was built of\nhewn stone, during the last century--a Palladian edifice, for a time\nmuch neglected, but now restored and duly prepared for the reception\nof its lord and master by the same combined energy and taste which had\nproved so satisfactory and successful at Muriel Towers.\n\nIt was a long room, the front saloon at Hyde Park Gardens, and the door\nwas as remote as possible from the mantel-piece. It opened suddenly, but\nonly the panting face of Mr. Putney Giles was seen, as he poured forth\nin hurried words: \"My dear, dreadfully late, but I can dress in five\nminutes. I only opened the door in passing, to tell you that I have seen\nour great friend; wonderful man! but I will tell you all at dinner, or\nafter. It was not he who kept me, but the Duke of Brecon. The duke has\nbeen with me two hours. I had a good mind to bring him home to dinner,\nand give him a bottle of my '48. They like that sort of thing, but it\nwill keep,\" and the head vanished.\n\nThe Duke of Brecon would not have dined ill, had he honored this\nhousehold. It is a pleasant thing to see an opulent and prosperous man\nof business, sanguine and full of health, and a little overworked, at\nthat royal meal, dinner. How he enjoys his soup! And how curious in his\nfish! How critical in his entr e, and how nice in his Welsh mutton! His\nexhausted brain rallies under the glass of dry sherry, and he realizes\nall his dreams with the aid of claret that has the true flavor of the\nviolet.\n\n\"And now, my dear Apollonia,\" said Mr. Putney Giles, when the servants\nhad retired, and he turned his chair and played with a new nut from the\nBrazils, \"about our great friend. Well, I was there at two o'clock, and\nfound him at breakfast. Indeed, he said that, had he not given me an\nappointment, he thought he should not have risen at all. So delighted\nhe was to find himself again in an English bed. Well, he told me every\nthing that had happened. I never knew a man so unreserved, and so\ndifferent from what he was when I first knew him, for he never much\ncared then to talk about himself. But no egotism, nothing of that sort\nof thing--all his mistakes, all his blunders, as he called them. He told\nme every thing, that I might thoroughly understand his position, and\nthat he might judge whether the steps I had taken in reference to it\nwere adequate.\"\n\n\"I suppose about his religion,\" said Apollonia. \"What is he, after all?\"\n\n\"As sound as you are. But you are right; that was the point on which he\nwas most anxious. He wrote, you know, to me from Malta, when the\naccount of his conversion first appeared, to take all necessary steps to\ncontradict the announcement, and counteract its consequences. He gave me\ncarte blanche, and was anxious to know precisely what I had done. I\ntold him that a mere contradiction, anonymous, or from a third person,\nhowever unqualified its language, would have no effect in the face of\na detailed narrative, like that in all the papers, of his walking in\nprocession and holding a lighted taper, and all that sort of thing. What\nI did was this. I commenced building, by his direction, two new churches\non his estate, and announced in the local journals, copied in London,\nthat he would be present at the consecration of both. I subscribed, in\nhis name, and largely, to all the diocesan societies, gave a thousand\npounds to the Bishop of London's fund, and accepted for him the office\nof steward, for this year, for the Sons of the Clergy. Then, when the\npublic feeling was ripe, relieved from all its anxieties, and beginning\nto get indignant at the calumnies that had been so freely circulated,\nthe time for paragraphs had arrived, and one appeared stating that\na discovery had taken place of the means by which an unfounded and\npreposterous account of the conversion of a distinguished young English\nnobleman at Rome had been invented and circulated, and would probably\nfurnish the occasion for an action for libel. And now his return and\nappearance at the Chapel Royal, next Sunday, will clinch the whole\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"And he was satisfied?\"\n\n\"Most satisfied; a little anxious whether his personal friends,\nand particularly the Brentham family, were assured of the truth. He\ntravelled home with the duke's son and Lord St. Aldegonde, but they came\nfrom remote parts, and their news from home was not very recent.\"\n\n\"And how does he look?\"\n\n\"Very well; never saw him look better. He is handsomer than he was. But\nhe is changed. I could not conceive in a year that any one could be so\nchanged. He was young for his years; he is now old for his years. He\nwas, in fact, a boy; he is now a man; and yet it is only a year. He said\nit seemed to him ten.\"\n\n\"He has been through a fiery furnace,\" said Apollonia.\n\n\"Well, he has borne it well,\" said Mr. Giles. \"It is worth while serving\nsuch a client, so cordial, so frank, and yet so full of thought. He\nsay he does not in the least regret all the money he has wasted. Had he\nremained at home, it would have gone to building a cathedral.\"\n\n\"And a popish one!\" said Apollonia. \"I cannot agree with him,\" she\ncontinued, \"that his Italian campaign was a waste of money. It will bear\nfruit. We shall still see the end of the 'abomination of desolation.'\"\n\n\"Very likely,\" said Mr. Giles; \"but I trust my client will have no more\nto do with such questions either way.\"\n\n\"And did he ask after his friends?\" said Apollonia.\n\n\"Very much: he asked after you. I think he went through all the guests\nat Muriel Towers except the poor Campians. He spoke, to me about the\ncolonel, to whom it appears he has written; but Theodora he never\nmentioned, except by some periphrasis, some allusion to a great sorrow,\nor to some dear friend whom he had lost. He seems a little embarrassed\nabout the St. Jeromes, and said more than once that he owed his life to\nMiss Arundel. He dwelt a good deal upon this. He asked also a great deal\nabout the Brentham family. They seem the people whom he most affects.\nWhen I told him of Lady Corisande's approaching union with the Duke of\nBrecon, I did not think he half liked it.\"\n\n\"But is it settled?\"\n\n\"The same as--. The duke has been with me two hours to-day about his\narrangements. He has proposed to the parents, who are delighted with\nthe match, and has received every encouragement from the young lady. He\nlooks upon it as certain.\"\n\n\"I wish our kind friend had not gone abroad,\" said Apollonia.\n\n\"Well, at any rate, he has come back,\" said Mr. Giles; \"that is\nsomething. I am sure I more than once never expected to see him again.\"\n\n\"He has every virtue, and every charm,\" said Apollonia, \"and principles\nthat are now proved. I shall never forget his kindness at the Towers. I\nwish he were settled for life. But who is worthy of him? I hope he will\nnot fall into the clutches of that popish girl. I have sometimes, from\nwhat I observed at Muriel, and other reasons, a dread misgiving.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 81\n\n\nIt was the first night that Lothair had slept in his own house, and,\nwhen he awoke in the morning, he was quite bewildered, and thought for a\nmoment he was in the Palazzo Agostini. He had not reposed in so spacious\nand lofty a chamber since he was at Rome. And this brought all his\nrecollection to his Roman life, and every thing that had happened there.\n\"And yet, after all,\" he said, \"had it not been for Clare Arundel,\nI should never have seen Muriel House. I owe to her my life.\" His\nrelations with the St. Jerome family were doubtless embarrassing, even\npainful; and yet his tender and susceptible nature could not for a\nmoment tolerate that he should passively submit to an estrangement\nfrom those who had conferred on him so much kindness, and whose\nill-considered and injurious courses, as he now esteemed them, were\nperhaps, and probably, influenced and inspired by exalted, even sacred\nmotives.\n\nHe wondered whether they were in London; and, if so, what should he do?\nShould he call, or should he write? He wished he could do something\nto show to Miss Arundel how much he appreciated her kindness, and how\ngrateful he was. She was a fine creature, and all her errors were noble\nones; enthusiasm, energy, devotion to a sublime cause. Errors, but are\nthese errors? Are they not, on the contrary, qualities which should\ncommand admiration in any one? and in a woman--and a beautiful\nwoman--more than admiration?\n\nThere is always something to worry you. It comes as regularly as\nsunrise. Here was Lothair under his own roof again, after strange\nand trying vicissitudes, with his health restored, his youth little\ndiminished, with some strange memories and many sweet ones; on the\nwhole, once more in great prosperity, and yet his mind harped only on\none vexing thought, and that was his painful and perplexed relations\nwith the St. Jerome family.\n\nHis thoughts were a little distracted from this harassing theme by\nthe novelty of his house, and the pleasure it gave him. He admired the\ndouble staircase and the somewhat heavy, yet richly-carved ceilings; and\nthe look into the park, shadowy and green, with a rich summer sun, and\nthe palace in the distance. What an agreeable contrast to his hard,\nnoisy sojourn in a bran-new, brobdingnagian hotel, as was his coarse\nfate when he was launched into London life! This made him think of\nmany comforts for which he ought to be grateful, and then he remembered\nMuriel Towers, and how completely and capitally every thing was there\nprepared and appointed, and while he was thinking over all this--and\nkindly of the chief author of these satisfactory arrangements, and the\ninstances in which that individual had shown, not merely professional\ndexterity and devotion, but some of the higher qualities that make life\nsweet and pleasant--Mr. Putney Giles was announced, and Lothair sprang\nforward and gave him his hand with a cordiality which repaid at once\nthat perfect but large-hearted lawyer for all his exertions, and some\nanxieties that he had never expressed even to Apollonia.\n\nNothing in life is more remarkable than the unnecessary anxiety which\nwe endure, and generally, occasion ourselves. Between four and five\no'clock, having concluded his long conference with Mr. Putney Giles,\nLothair, as if he were travelling the principal street of a foreign\ntown, or rather treading on tiptoe like a prince in some enchanted\ncastle, ventured to walk down St. James Street, and the very first\nperson he met was Lord St. Jerome!\n\nNothing could be more unaffectedly hearty than his greeting by that good\nman and thorough gentleman. \"I saw, by the Post, you had arrived,\" said\nLord St. Jerome, \"and we were all saying at breakfast how glad we should\nbe to see you again. And looking so well! Quite yourself! I never saw\nyou looking better. You have been to Egypt with Lord St. Aldegonde, I\nthink? It was the wisest thing you could do. I said to Gertrude, when\nyou went to Sicily, 'If I were Lothair, I would go a good deal farther\nthan Sicily.' You wanted change of scene and air, more than any man I\nknow.\"\n\n\"And how are they all?\" said Lothair; \"my first visit will be to them.\"\n\n\"And they will be delighted to see you. Lady St. Jerome is a little\nindisposed--a cold caught at one of her bazaars. She will hold them, and\nthey say that no one ever sells so much. But still, as I often say, 'My\ndear Gertrude, would it not be better if I were to give you a check\nfor the institution; it would be the same to them, and would save you\na great deal of trouble.' But she fancies her presence inspires others,\nand perhaps there is something in it.\"\n\n\"I doubt not; and Miss Arundel?\"\n\n\"Clare is quite well, and I am hurrying home now to ride with her. I\nshall tell her that you asked after her.\"\n\n\"And offer her my kindest remembrances.\"\n\n\"What a relief!\" exclaimed Lothair, when once more alone. \"I thought I\nshould have sunk into the earth when he first addressed me, and now I\nwould not have missed this meeting for any consideration.\"\n\nHe had not the courage to go into White's. He was under a vague\nimpression that the whole population of the metropolis, and especially\nthose who reside in the sacred land, bounded on the one side by\nPiccadilly, and on the other by Pall Mall, were unceasingly talking\nof his scrapes and misadventures; but he met Lord Carisbrooke and Mr.\nBrancepeth.\n\n\"Ah! Lothair,\" said Carisbrooke, \"I do not think we have seen you\nthis season--certainly not since Easter. What have you been doing with\nyourself?\"\n\n\"You have been in Egypt?\" said Mr. Brancepeth. \"The duke was mentioning\nat White's to-day that you had returned with his son and Lord St.\nAldegonde.\"\n\n\"And does it pay?\" inquired Carisbrooke. \"Egypt? What I have found\ngenerally in this sort of thing is, that one hardly knows what to do\nwith one's evenings.\"\n\n\"There is something in that,\" said Lothair, \"and perhaps it applies to\nother countries besides Egypt. However, though it is true I did return\nwith St. Aldegonde and Bertram, I have myself not been to Egypt.\"\n\n\"And where did you pick them up?\"\n\n\"At Jerusalem.\"\n\n\"Jerusalem! What on earth could they go to Jerusalem for?\" said Lord\nCarisbrooke. \"I am told there is no sort of sport there. They say, in\nthe Upper Nile, there is good shooting.\"\n\n\"St. Aldegonde was disappointed. I suppose our countrymen have disturbed\nthe crocodiles and frightened away the pelicans?\"\n\n\"We were going to look in at White's--come with us.\"\n\nLothair was greeted with general kindness; but nobody seemed aware that\nhe had been long and unusually absent from them. Some had themselves not\ncome up to town till after Easter, and had therefore less cause to miss\nhim. The great majority, however, were so engrossed with themselves that\nthey never missed anybody. The Duke of Brecon appealed to Lothair\nabout something that had happened at the last Derby, and was under the\nimpression, until better informed, that Lothair had been one of his\nparty. There were some exceptions to this general unacquaintance with\nevents which an hour before Lothair had feared fearfully engrossed\nsociety. Hugo Bohun was doubly charmed to see him, \"because we were all\nin a fright one day that they were going to make you a cardinal, and it\nturned out that, at the very time they said you were about to enter the\nconclave, you happened to be at the second cataract. What lies these\nnewspapers do tell!\"\n\nBut the climax of relief was reached when the noble and gray-headed\npatron of the arts in Great Britain approached him with polished\nbenignity, and said, \"I can give you perhaps even later news than you\ncan give me of our friends at Jerusalem. I had a letter from Madame\nPhoebus this morning, and she mentioned with great regret that you had\njust left them. Your first travels, I believe?\"\n\n\"My first.\"\n\n\"And wisely planned. You were right in starting out and seeing the\ndistant parts. One may not always have the energy which such an\nexpedition requires. You can keep Italy for a later and calmer day.\"\n\nThus, one by one, all the cerulean demons of the morn had vanished,\nand Lothair had nothing to worry him. He felt a little dull as the\ndinner-hour approached. Bertram was to dine at home, and then go to\nthe House of Commons; St. Aldegonde, concluding the day with the same\ncatastrophe, had in the most immoral manner, in the interval, gone to\nthe play to see \"School,\" of which he had read an account in Galignani\nwhen he was in quarantine. Lothair was so displeased with this unfeeling\nconduct on his part that he declined to accompany him; but Lady St.\nAldegonde, who dined at Crecy House, defended her husband, and thought\nit very right and reasonable that one so fond of the drama as he, who\nhad been so long deprived of gratifying his taste in that respect,\nshould take the first opportunity of enjoying this innocent amusement.\nA solitary dinner at Muriel House, in one of those spacious and lofty\nchambers, rather appalled Lothair, and he was getting low again,\nremembering nothing but his sorrows, when Mr. Pinto came up to him and\nsaid: \"The impromptu is always successful in life; you cannot be engaged\nto dinner, for everybody believes you are at Jericho. What say you to\ndining with me? Less than the Muses and more than the Graces, certainly,\nif you come. Lady Beatrice has invited herself, and she is to pick up\na lady, and I was to look out for a couple of agreeable men. Huge is\ncoming, and you will complete the charm.\"\n\n\"The spell then is complete,\" said Lothair; \"I suppose a late eight.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 82\n\n\nLothair was breakfasting alone on the morrow, when his servant announced\nthe arrival of Mr. Ruby, who had been ordered to be in attendance.\n\n\"Show him up,\" said Lothair, \"and bring me the dispatch-box which is in\nmy dressing-room.\"\n\nMr. Ruby was deeply gratified to be again in the presence of a nobleman\nso eminently distinguished, both for his property and his taste, as\nLothair. He was profuse in his congratulations to his lordship on his\nreturn to his native land, while at the same time he was opening a bag,\nfrom which he extracted a variety of beautiful objects, none of them\nfor sale, all executed commissions, which were destined to adorn the\nfortunate and the fair. \"This is lovely, my lord, quite new, for the\nQueen of Madagascar; for the empress this, her majesty's own design, at\nleast almost. Lady Melton's bridal necklace, and my lord's George, the\nlast given by King James II.; broken up during the revolution, but reset\nby us from an old drawing with picked stones.\"\n\n\"Very pretty,\" said Lothair; \"but it is not exactly this sort of thing\nthat I want. See,\" and he opened the dispatch-box, and took from out\nof it a crucifix. It was made of some Eastern wood, inlaid with\nmother-of-pearl; the figure carved in brass, though not without power,\nand at the end of each of the four terminations of the cross was a small\ncavity, enclosing something, and covered with glass.\n\n\"See,\" continued Lothair, \"this is the crucifix, given with a carved\nshell to each pilgrim who visits the Holy Sepulchre. Within these four\ncavities is earth from the four holy places: Calvary, Sion, Bethlehem,\nand Gethsemane. Now, what I want is a crucifix, something of this\ndimension, but made of the most costly materials; the figure must be of\npure gold; I should like the cross to be of choice emeralds, which I am\ntold are now more precious even than brilliants, and I wish the earth of\nthe sacred places to be removed from this crucifix, and introduced in a\nsimilar manner into the one which you are to make; and each cavity must\nbe covered with a slit diamond. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"I follow you, my lord,\" said Mr. Ruby, with glistening eyes. \"It will\nbe a rare jewel. Is there to be a limit as to the cost?\"\n\n\"None but such as taste and propriety suggest,\" said Lothair. \"You will\nof course make a drawing and an estimate, and send them to me; but I\ndesire dispatch.\"\n\nWhen Mr. Ruby had retired, Lothair took from the dispatch-box a sealed\npacket, and looked at it for some moments, and then pressed it to his\nlips.\n\nIn the afternoon, Lothair found himself again in the saddle, and was\nriding about London, as if he had never quitted it. He left his cards\nat Crecy House, and many other houses, and he called at the St. Jeromes'\nlate, but asked if they were at home. He had reckoned that they would\nnot be, and his reckoning was right. It was impossible to conceal from\nhimself that it was a relief. Mr. Putney Giles dined alone with Lothair\nthis evening, and they talked over many things; among others the\napproaching marriage of Lady Corisande with the Duke of Brecon.\n\n\"Everybody marries except myself,\" said Lothair, rather peevishly.\n\n\"But your lordship is too young to think of that yet,\" said Mr. Putney\nGiles.\n\n\"I feel very old,\" said Lothair.\n\nAt this moment there arrived a note from Bertram, saying his mother was\nquite surprised and disappointed that Lothair had not asked to see\nher in the morning. She had expected him, as a matter of course, at\nluncheon, and begged that he would come on the morrow.\n\n\"I have had many pleasant luncheons in that house,\" said Lothair, \"but\nthis will be the last. When all the daughters are married, nobody eats\nluncheon.\"\n\n\"That would hardly apply to this family,\" said Mr. Putney Giles, who\nalways affected to know every thing, and generally did. \"They are so\nunited, that I fancy the famous luncheons at Crecy House will always go\non, and be a popular mode of their all meeting.\"\n\n\"I half agree with St. Aldegonde,\" said Lothair, grumbling to himself,\n\"that if one is to meet that Duke of Brecon every day at luncheon, for\nmy part I had rather stay away.\"\n\nIn the course of the evening there also arrived invitations to all the\nimpending balls and assemblies, for Lothair; and there seemed little\nprospect of his again being forced to dine with his faithful solicitor\nas a refuge from melancholy.\n\nOn the morrow he went in his brougham to Crecy House, and he had such\na palpitation of the heart when he arrived, that, for a moment, he\nabsolutely thought he must retire. His mind was full of Jerusalem, the\nMount of Olives, and the Sea of Galilee. He was never nervous there,\nnever agitated, never harassed, no palpitations of the heart, no dread\nsuspense. There was repose alike of body and soul. Why did he ever\nleave Palestine and Paraclete? He should have remained in Syria forever,\ncherishing, in a hallowed scene, a hallowed sorrow, of which even the\nbitterness was exalted and ennobling.\n\nHe stood for a moment in the great hall at Crecy House, and the groom\nof the chambers in vain solicited his attention. It was astonishing\nhow much passed through his mind while the great clock hardly described\nsixty seconds. But in that space he had reviewed his life, arrived at\nthe conclusion that all was vanity and bitterness, that he had failed\nin every thing, was misplaced, had no object and no hope, and that a\ndistant and unbroken solitude in some scene, where either the majesty of\nNature was overwhelming, or its moral associations were equally sublime,\nmust be his only refuge. In the meditation of the Cosmos, or in the\ndivine reverie of sacred lands, the burden of existence might be\nendured.\n\n\"Her grace is at luncheon, my lord,\" at length said the groom of the\nchamber--and Lothair was ushered into the gay, and festive, and cordial\nscene. The number of the self-invited guests alone saved him. His\nconfusion was absolute, and the duchess remarked afterward that Lothair\nseemed to have regained all his shyness.\n\nWhen Lothair had rallied and could survey the scene, he found he was\nsitting by his hostess; that the duke, not a luncheon man, was present,\nand, as it turned out afterward, for the pleasure of meeting Lothair.\nBertram also was present, and several married daughters, and Lord\nMontairy, and Captain Mildmay, and one or two others; and next to Lady\nCorisande was the Duke of Brecon.\n\nSo far as Lothair was concerned, the luncheon was unsuccessful. His\nconversational powers deserted him. He answered in monosyllables, and\nnever originated a remark. He was greatly relieved when they rose and\nreturned to the gallery, in which they seemed all disposed to linger.\nThe duke approached him, and, in his mood, he found it easier to talk to\nmen than to women. Male conversation is of a coarser grain, and does not\nrequire so much play of thought and manner; discourse about Suez Canal,\nand Arab horses, and pipes, and pachas, can be carried on without any\npsychological effort, and, by degrees, banishes all sensibility. And yet\nhe was rather dreamy, talked better than he listened, did not look his\ncompanion in the face, as the duke spoke, which was his custom, and his\neye was wandering. Suddenly, Bertram having joined them, and speaking to\nhis father, Lothair darted away and approached Lady Corisande, whom Lady\nMontairy had just quitted.\n\n\"As I may never have the opportunity again,\" said Lothair, \"let me thank\nyou, Lady Corisande, for some kind thoughts which you deigned to bestow\non me in my absence.\"\n\nHis look was serious; his tone almost sad. Neither were in keeping with\nthe scene and the apparent occasion; and Lady Corisande, not displeased,\nbut troubled, murmured: \"Since I last met you, I heard you had seen much\nand suffered much.\"\n\n\"And that makes the kind thoughts of friends more precious,\" said\nLothair. \"I have few; your brother is the chief, but even he never did\nme any kindness so great as when he told me that you had spoken of me\nwith sympathy.\"\n\n\"Bertram's friends are mine,\" said Lady Corisande; \"but, otherwise, it\nwould be impossible for us all not to feel an interest in--, one of whom\nwe had seen so much,\" she added, with some hesitation.\n\n\"Ah, Brentham!\" said Lothair; \"dear Brentham! Do you remember once\nsaying to me that you hoped you should never leave Brentham?\"\n\n\"Did I say so?\" said Lady Corisande.\n\n\"I wish I had never left Brentham,\" said Lothair; \"it was the happiest\ntime of my life. I had not then a sorrow or a care.\"\n\n\"But everybody has sorrows and cares,\" said Lady Corisande; \"you have,\nhowever, a great many things which ought to make you happy.\"\n\n\"I do not deserve to be happy,\" said Lothair, \"for I have made so many\nmistakes. My only consolation is that one great error, which you most\ndeprecated, I have escaped.\"\n\n\"Take a brighter and a nobler view of your life,\" said Lady Corisande;\n\"feel rather you have been tried and not found wanting.\"\n\nAt this moment the duchess approached them, and interrupted their\nconversation; and, soon after this, Lothair left Crecy House, still\nmoody, but less despondent.\n\nThere was a ball at Lady Clanmorne's in the evening, and Lothair was\npresent. He was astonished at the number of new faces he saw, the new\nphrases he heard, the new fashions alike in dress and manner. He could\nnot believe it was the same world that he had quitted only a year ago.\nHe was glad to take refuge with Hugo Bohun as with an old friend, and\ncould not refrain from expressing to that eminent person his surprise at\nthe novelty of all around him.\n\n\"It is you, my dear Lothair,\" replied Hugo, \"that is surprising, not the\nworld--that has only developed in your absence. What could have induced\na man like you to be away for a whole season from the scene? Our\nforefathers might afford to travel--the world was then stereotyped. It\nwill not do to be out of sight now. It is very well for St. Aldegonde to\ndo these things, for the great object of St. Aldegonde is not to be in\nsociety, and he has never succeeded in his object. But here is the new\nbeauty.\"\n\nThere was a stir and a sensation. Men made way, and even women\nretreated--and, leaning on the arm of Lord Carisbrooke, in an exquisite\ncostume that happily displayed her splendid figure, and, radiant\nwith many charms, swept by a lady of commanding mien and stature,\nself-possessed, and even grave, when, suddenly turning her head, her\npretty face broke into enchanting dimples, as she exclaimed: \"Oh, cousin\nLothair!\"\n\nYes, the beautiful giantesses of Muriel Towers had become the beauties\nof the season. Their success had been as sudden and immediate as it was\ncomplete and sustained. \"Well, this is stranger than all!\" said Lothair\nto Hugo Bohun when Lady Flora had passed on.\n\n\"The only persons talked of,\" said Hugo. \"I am proud of my previous\nacquaintance with them. I think Carisbrooke has serious thoughts; but\nthere are some who prefer Lady Grizell.\"\n\n\"Lady Corisande was your idol last season,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"Oh, she is out of the running,\" said Hugo; \"she is finished. But I have\nnot heard yet of any day being fixed. I wonder, when he marries, whether\nBrecon will keep on his theatre?\"\n\n\"His theatre!\"\n\n\"Yes; the high mode now for a real swell is to have a theatre. Brecon\nhas the Frolic; Kate Simmons is his manager, who calls herself Athalie\nde Montfort. You ought to have a theatre, Lothair; and, if there is\nnot one to hire, you should build one. It would show that you are alive\nagain and had the spirit of an English noble, and atone for some of your\neccentricities.\"\n\n\"But I have no Kate Simmons who calls herself Athalie de Montfort,\" said\nLothair. \"I am not so favored, Hugo. However, I might succeed Brecon,\nas I hardly suppose he will maintain such an establishment when he is\nmarried.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" rejoined Hugo. \"It is the thing. Several of our\ngreatest swells have theatres and are married. In fact, a first-rate man\nshould have every thing, and therefore he ought to have both a theatre\nand a wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I do not think your manners have improved since, last year, or\nyour words,\" said Lothair. \"I have half a mind to go down to Muriel, and\nshut myself up there.\"\n\nHe walked away and sauntered into the ballroom. The first forms he\nrecognized were Lady Corisande waltzing with the Duke of Brecon, who was\nrenowned for this accomplishment. The heart of Lothair felt bitter. He\nremembered his stroll to the dairy with the Duchess at Brentham, and\ntheir conversation. Had his views then been acceded to, how different\nwould have been his lot! And it was not his fault that they had been\nrejected. And yet, had they been accomplished, would they have been\nhappy? The character of Corisande, according to her mother, was not then\nformed, nor easily scrutable. Was it formed now? and what were its bent\nand genius? And his own character? It could not be denied that his mind\nwas somewhat crude then, and his general conclusions on life and duty\nhardly sufficiently matured and developed to offer a basis for domestic\nhappiness on which one might confidently depend.\n\nAnd Theodora? Had he married then, he should never have known Theodora.\nIn this bright saloon, amid the gayety of festive music, and surrounded\nby gliding forms of elegance and brilliancy, his heart was full of\nanguish when he thought of Theodora. To have known such a woman and to\nhave lost her! Why should a man live after this? Yes; he would retire to\nMuriel, once hallowed by her presence, and he would raise to her memory\nsome monumental fane, beyond the dreams ever of Artemisia, and which\nshould commemorate alike her wondrous life and wondrous mind.\n\nA beautiful hand was extended to him, and a fair face, animated with\nintelligence, welcomed him without a word. It was Lady St. Jerome.\nLothair bowed lowly and touched her hand with his lip.\n\n\"I was sorry to have missed you yesterday. We had gone down to Vauxe for\nthe day, but I heard of you from my lord with great pleasure. We are all\nof us so happy that you have entirely recovered your health.\"\n\n\"I owe that to you, dearest lady,\" said Lothair, \"and to those under\nyour roof. I can never forget your goodness to me. Had it not been for\nyou, I should not have been here or anywhere else.\"\n\n\"No, no; we did our best for the moment. But I quite agree with my lord,\nnow, that you stayed too long at Rome under the circumstances. It was a\ngood move--that going to Sicily, and so wise of you to travel in Egypt.\nMen should travel.\"\n\n\"I have not been to Egypt,\" said Lothair; \"I have been to the Holy Land,\nand am a pilgrim. I wish you would tell Miss Arundel that I shall ask\nher permission to present her with my crucifix, which contains the earth\nof the holy places. I should have told her this myself, if I had seen\nher yesterday. Is she here?\"\n\n\"She is at Vauxe; she could not tear herself away from the roses.\"\n\n\"But she might have brought them with her as companions,\" said Lothair,\n\"as you have, I apprehend, yourself.\"\n\n\"I will give you this in Clare's name,\" said Lady St. Jerome, as she\nselected a beautiful flower and presented it to Lothair. \"It is in\nreturn for your crucifix, which I am sure she will highly esteem. I only\nwish it were a rose of Jericho.\"\n\nLothair started. The name brought up strange and disturbing\nassociations: the procession in the Jesuits' church, the lighted tapers,\nthe consecrated children, one of whom had been supernaturally presented\nwith the flower in question. There was an awkward silence, until\nLothair, almost without intending it, expressed a hope that the cardinal\nwas well.\n\n\"Immersed in affairs, but I hope well,\" replied Lady St. Jerome. \"You\nknow what has happened? But you will see him. He will speak to you of\nthese matters himself.\"\n\n\"But I should like also to hear from you.\"\n\n\"Well, they are scarcely yet to be spoken of,\" said Lady St. Jerome. \"I\nought not perhaps even to have alluded to the subject; but I know how\ndeeply devoted you are to religion. We are on the eve of the greatest\nevent of this century. When I wake in the morning, I always fancy that\nI have heard of it only in dreams. And many--all this room--will\nnot believe in the possibility of its happening. They smile when the\ncontingency is alluded to, and if I were not present they would mock.\nBut it will happen--I am assured it will happen,\" exclaimed Lady St.\nJerome, speaking with earnestness, though in a hushed voice. \"And no\nhuman imagination can calculate or conceive what may be its effect on\nthe destiny of the human race.\"\n\n\"You excite my utmost curiosity,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"Hush! there are listeners. But we shall soon meet again. You will come\nand see us, and soon. Come down to Vauxe on Saturday; the cardinal\nwill be there. And the place is so lovely now. I always say Vauxe at\nWhitsuntide, or a little later, is a scene for Shakespeare. You know you\nalways liked Vauxe.\"\n\n\"More than liked it,\" said Lothair; \"I have passed at Vauxe some of the\nhappiest hours of my life.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 83\n\n\nOn the morning of the very Saturday on which Lothair was to pay his\nvisit to Vauxe, riding in the park, he was joined by that polished\nand venerable nobleman who presides over the destinies of art in Great\nBritain. This distinguished person had taken rather a fancy to Lothair,\nand liked to talk to him about the Phoebus family; about the great\nartist himself, and all his theories and styles; but especially about\nthe fascinating Madame Phoebus and the captivating Euphrosyne.\n\n\"You have not found time, I dare say,\" said the nobleman, \"to visit the\nexhibition of the Royal Academy?\"\n\n\"Well, I have only been here a week,\" said Lothair, \"and have had so\nmany things to think of, and so many persons to see.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" said the nobleman; \"but I recommend you to go. I am now\nabout to make my fifth visit there; but it is only to a single picture,\nand I envy its owner.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said Lothair. \"Pray tell me its subject, that I may not fail\nto see it.\"\n\n\"It is a portrait,\" said the nobleman, \"only a portrait, some would\nsay, as if the finest pictures in the world were not only portraits. The\nmasterpieces of the English school are portraits, and some day when you\nhave leisure and inclination, and visit Italy, you will see portraits\nby Titian and Raffaelle and others, which are the masterpieces of art.\nWell, the picture in question is a portrait by a young English painter\nat Rome and of an English lady. I doubt not the subject was equal to\nthe genius of the artist, but I do not think that the modern pencil\nhas produced any thing equal to it, both, in design and color and\nexpression. You should see it, by all means, and I have that opinion of\nyour taste that I do not think you will be content by seeing it once.\nThe real taste for fine art in this country is proved by the crowd that\nalways surrounds that picture; and yet only a portrait of an English\nlady, a Miss Arundel.\"\n\n\"A Miss Arundel?\" said Lothair.\n\n\"Yes, of a Roman Catholic family; I believe a relative of the St.\nJeromes. They were at Rome last year, when this portrait was executed.\"\n\n\"If you will permit me,\" said Lothair, \"I should like to accompany you\nto the Academy. I am going out of town this afternoon, but not far, and\ncould manage it.\"\n\nSo they went together. It was the last exhibition of the Academy in\nTrafalgar Square. The portrait in question was in the large room, and\nhung on the eye line; so, as the throng about it was great, it was not\neasy immediately to inspect it. But one or two R. A's who were gliding\nabout, and who looked upon the noble patron of art as a sort of\ndivinity, insensibly controlled the crowd, and secured for their friend\nand his companion the opportunity which they desired.\n\n\"It is the finest thing since the portrait of the Cenci,\" said the noble\npatron.\n\nThe painter had represented Miss Arundel in her robe of a sister of\nmercy, but with uncovered head. A wallet was at her side, and she held a\ncrucifix. Her beautiful eyes, full of mystic devotions met those of the\nspectator with a fascinating power that kept many spell-bound. In the\nbackground of the picture was a masterly glimpse of the papal gardens\nand the wondrous dome.\n\n\"That must be a great woman,\" said the noble patron of art.\n\nLothair nodded assent in silence.\n\nThe crowd about the picture seemed breathless and awe-struck. There were\nmany women, and in some eyes there were tears.\n\n\"I shall go home,\" said one of the spectators; \"I do not wish to see any\nthing else.\"\n\n\"That is religion,\" murmured her companion. \"They may say what they\nlike, but it would be well for us if we were all like her.\"\n\nIt was a short half-hour by the railroad to Vauxe, and the station\nwas close to the park gates. The sun was in its last hour when Lothair\narrived, but he was captivated by the beauty of the scene, which he had\nnever witnessed in its summer splendor. The rich foliage of the great\navenues, the immense oaks that stood alone, the deer glancing in the\ngolden light, and the quaint and stately edifice itself, so finished and\nso fair, with its freestone pinnacles and its gilded vanes glistening\nand sparkling in the warm and lucid sky, contrasted with the chilly\nhours when the cardinal and himself had first strolled together in that\npark, and when they tried to flatter themselves that the morning mist\nclinging to the skeleton trees was perhaps the burst of spring.\n\nLothair found himself again in his old rooms, and, as his valet unpacked\nhis toilet, he fell into one of his reveries.\n\n\"What,\" he thought to himself, \"if life after all be only a dream? I can\nscarcely realize what is going on. It seems to me; I have passed through\na year of visions. That I should be at Vauxe again! A roof I once\nthought rife with my destiny. And perhaps it may prove so. And, were it\nnot for the memory of one event, I should be a ship without a rudder.\"\n\nThere were several guests in the house, and, when Lothair entered the\ndrawing-room, he was glad to find that it was rather full. The cardinal\nwas by the side of Lady St. Jerome when Lothair entered, and immediately\nafter saluting his hostess it was his duty to address his late guardian.\nLothair had looked forward to this meeting with apprehension. It seemed\nimpossible that it should not to a certain degree be annoying. Nothing\nof the kind. It was impossible to greet him more cordially, more\naffectionately than did Cardinal Grandison.\n\n\"You have seen a great deal since we parted,\" said the cardinal.\n\"Nothing could be wiser than your travelling. You remember that at\nMuriel I recommended you to go to Egypt, but I thought it better that\nyou should see Rome first. And it answered: you made the acquaintance of\nits eminent men, men whose names will be soon in everybody's mouth,\nfor before another year elapses Rome will be the cynosure of the world.\nThen, when the great questions come on which will decide the fate of\nthe human race for centuries, you will feel the inestimable advantage\nof being master of the situation, and that you are familiar with every\nplace and every individual. I think you were not very well at Rome; but\nnext time you must choose your season. However, I may congratulate you\non your present looks. The air of the Levant seems to have agreed with\nyou.\"\n\nDinner was announced almost at this moment, and Lothair, who had to take\nout Lady Clanmorne, had no opportunity before dinner of addressing\nany one else except his hostess and the cardinal. The dinner-party was\nlarge, and it took some time to reconnoitre all the guests. Lothair\nobserved Miss Arundel, who was distant from him and on the same side of\nthe table, but neither Monsignore Capel nor Father Coleman were present.\n\nLady Clanmorne chatted agreeably. She was content to talk, and did not\ninsist on conversational reciprocity. She was a pure free-trader in\ngossip. This rather suited Lothair. It pleased Lady Clanmorne to-day to\ndilate upon marriage and the married state, but especially on all her\nacquaintances, male and female, who were meditating the surrender of\ntheir liberty and about to secure the happiness of their lives.\n\n\"I suppose the wedding of the season--the wedding of weddings--will be\nthe Duke of Brecon's,\" she said. \"But I do not hear of any day being\nfixed.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Lothair, \"I have been abroad and am very deficient in these\nmatters. But I was travelling with the lady's brother, and he has never\nyet told me that his sister was going to be married.\"\n\n\"There is no doubt about that,\" said Lady Clanmorne. \"The duchess said\nto a friend of mine the other day, who congratulated her, that there was\nno person in whom she should have more confidence as a son-in-law than\nthe duke.\"\n\n\"But most marriages turn out unhappy,\" said Lothair, rather morosely.\n\n\"Oh! my dear lord, what can you mean?\"\n\n\"Well I think so,\" he said doggedly. \"Among the lower orders, if we may\njudge from the newspapers, they are always killing their wives, and in\nour class we get rid of them in a more polished way, or they get rid of\nus.\"\n\n\"You quite astonish me with such sentiments,\" said Lady Clanmorne. \"What\nwould Lady St. Jerome think if she heard you, who told me the other day\nthat she believed you to be a faultless character? And the duchess too,\nyour friend's mamma, who thinks you so good, and that it is so fortunate\nfor her son to have such a companion?\"\n\n\"As for Lady St. Jerome, she believes in every thing,\" said Lothair;\n\"and it is no compliment that she believes in me. As for my friend's\nmamma, her ideal character, according to you, is the Duke of Brecon, and\nI cannot pretend to compete with him. He may please the duchess, but I\ncannot say the Duke of Brecon is a sort of man I admire.\"\n\n\"Well, he is no great favorite of mine,\" said Lady Clanmorne; \"I think\nhim overbearing and selfish, and I should not like at all to be his\nwife.\"\n\n\"What do you think of Lady Corisande?\" said Lothair.\n\n\"I admire her more than any girl in society, and I think she will be\nthrown away on the Duke of Brecon. She is clever and she has strong\ncharacter, and, I am told, is capable of great affections. Her manners\nare good, finished, and natural; and she is beloved by her young\nfriends, which I always think a test.\"\n\n\"Do you think her handsome?\"\n\n\"There can be no question about that: she is beautiful, and her beauty\nis of a high class. I admire her much more than all her sisters. She has\na grander mien.\"\n\n\"Have you seen Miss Arundel's picture at the Academy?\"\n\n\"Everybody has seen that: it has made a fury.\"\n\n\"I heard an eminent judge say to-day, that it was the portrait of one\nwho must be a great woman.\"\n\n\"Well, Miss Arundel is a remarkable person.\"\n\n\"Do you admire her?\"\n\n\"I have heard first-rate critics say that there was no person to be\ncompared to Miss Arundel. And unquestionably it is a most striking\ncountenance: that profound brow and those large deep eyes--and then her\nfigure is so fine; but, to tell you the truth, Miss Arundel is a person\nI never could make out.\"\n\n\"I wonder she does not marry,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"She is very difficult,\" said Lady Clanmorne. \"Perhaps, too, she is of\nyour opinion about marriage.\"\n\n\"I have a good mind to ask her after dinner whether she is,\" said\nLothair. \"I fancy she would not marry a Protestant?\"\n\n\"I am no judge of such matters,\" said Lady Clanmorne; \"only I cannot\nhelp thinking that there would be more chance of a happy marriage when\nboth were of the same religion.\"\n\n\"I wish we were all of the same religion. Do not you?\"\n\n\"Well, that depends a little on what the religion might be.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" sighed Lothair, \"what between religion and marriage and some other\nthings, it appears to me one never has a tranquil moment. I wonder what\nreligious school the Duke of Brecon belongs to? Very high and dry, I\nshould think.\"\n\nThe moment the gentlemen returned to the drawing-room, Lothair singled\nout Miss Arundel, and attached himself to her.\n\n\"I have been to see your portrait today,\" he said. She changed color.\n\n\"I think it,\" he continued, \"the triumph of modern art, and I could not\neasily fix on any production of the old masters that excels it.\"\n\n\"It was painted at Rome,\" she said, in a low voice.\n\n\"So I understood. I regret that, when I was at Rome, I saw so little of\nits art. But my health, you know, was wretched. Indeed, if it had not\nbeen for some friends--I might say for one friend--I should not have\nbeen here or in this world. I can never express to that person my\ngratitude, and it increases every day. All that I have dreamed of angels\nwas then realized.\"\n\n\"You think too kindly of us.\"\n\n\"Did Lady St. Jerome give you my message about the earth from the holy\nplaces which I had placed in a crucifix, and which I hope you will\naccept from me, in remembrance of the past and your Christian kindness\nto me? I should have left it at St. James's Square before this, but it\nrequired some little arrangement after its travels.\"\n\n\"I shall prize it most dearly, both on account of its consecrated\ncharacter and for the donor's sake, whom I have ever wished to see the\nchampion of our Master.\"\n\n\"You never had a wish, I am sure,\" said Lothair, \"that was not sublime\nand pure.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 84\n\n\nThey breakfasted at Vauxe, in the long gallery. It was always a merry\nmeal, and it was the fashion of the house that all should be present.\nThe cardinal was seldom absent. He used to say: \"I feel more on equal\nterms with my friends at breakfast, and rather look forward to my\nbanquet of dry toast.\" Lord St. Jerome was quite proud of receiving\nhis letters and newspapers at Vauxe earlier by far than he did at\nSt. James's Square; and, as all were supplied with their letters\nand journals, there was a great demand, for news, and a proportional\ncirculation of it. Lady Clanmorne indulged this passion for gossip\namusingly one morning, and read a letter from her correspondent, written\nwith the grace of a Sevigne, but which contained details of marriages,\nelopements, and a murder among their intimate acquaintance, which made\nall the real intelligence quite insipid, and was credited for at least\nhalf an hour.\n\nThe gallery at Vauxe was of great length, and the breakfast-table was\nlaid at one end of it. The gallery was of panelled oak, with windows of\nstained glass in the upper panes, and the ceiling, richly and heavily\ncarved, was entirely gilt, but with deadened gold. Though stately, the\ngeneral effect was not free from a certain character of gloom. Lit,\nas it was, by sconces, this was at night much softened; but, on a rich\nsummer morn, the gravity and repose of this noble chamber were grateful\nto the senses.\n\nThe breakfast was over; the ladies had retired, stealing off with the\nMorning Post, the gentlemen gradually disappearing for the solace of\ntheir cigars. The cardinal, who was conversing with Lothair, continued\ntheir conversation while walking up and down the gallery, far from the\nhearing of the servants, who were disembarrassing the breakfast-table,\nand preparing it for luncheon. A visit to a country-house, as Pinto\nsays, is a series of meals mitigated by the new dresses of the ladies.\n\n\"The more I reflect on your travels,\" said the cardinal, \"the more I am\nsatisfied with what has happened. I recognize the hand of Providence in\nyour preliminary visit to Rome and your subsequent one to Jerusalem. In\nthe vast events which are impending, that man is in a strong position\nwho has made a pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre. Yo remember our walk\nin the park here,\" continued the cardinal; \"I felt then that we were on\nthe eve of some mighty change, but it was then indefinite, though to me\ninevitable. You were destined, I was persuaded, to witness it, even, as\nI hoped, to take no inconsiderable share in its fulfilment. But I hardly\nbelieved that I should have been spared for this transcendent day, and,\nwhen it is consummated, I will gratefully exclaim, 'Nunc me dimittis!'\"\n\n\"You, allude, sir, to some important matter which Lady St. Jerome a few\ndays ago intimated to me, but it was only an intimation, and purposely\nvery vague.\"\n\n\"There is no doubt,\" said the cardinal, speaking with solemnity, \"of\nwhat I now communicate to you. The Holy Father, Pius IX., has resolved\nto summon an Oecumenical Council.\"\n\n\"An Oecumenical Council!\" said Lothair.\n\n\"It is a weak phrase,\" resumed the cardinal, \"to say it will be the\ngreatest event of this century. I believe it will be the greatest event\nsince the Episcopate of St. Peter; greater, in its consequences to the\nhuman race, than the fall of the Roman Empire, the pseudo-Reformation,\nor the Revolution of France. It is much more than three hundred years\nsince the last Oecumenical Council, the Council of Trent, and the world\nstill vibrates with its decisions. But the Council of Trent, compared\nwith the impending Council of the Vatican, will be as the mediaeval\nworld of Europe compared with the vast and complete globe which man has\nsince discovered and mastered.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said Lothair.\n\n\"Why, the very assembly of the Fathers of the Church will astound the\nFreemasons, and the secret societies, and the atheists. That alone will\nbe a demonstration of power on the part of the Holy Father which no\nconqueror from Sesostris to Napoleon has ever equalled. It was only the\nbishops of Europe that assembled at Trent, and, inspired by the Holy\nSpirit, their decisions have governed man for more than three hundred\nyears. But now the bishops of the whole world will assemble round the\nchair of St. Peter, and prove by their presence the catholic character\nof the Church. Asia will send its patriarchs and pontiffs, and America\nand Australia its prelates; and at home, my dear young friend, the\nCouncil of the Vatican will offer a striking contrast to the Council\nof Trent; Great Britain will be powerfully represented. The bishops of\nIreland might have been counted on, but it is England also that will\nsend her prelates now, and some of them will take no ordinary share in\ntransactions that will give a new form and color to human existence.\"\n\n\"Is it true, sir, that the object of the council is to declare the\ninfallibility of the pope?\"\n\n\"In matters of faith and morals,\" said the cardinal quickly. \"There is\nno other infallibility. That is a secret with God. All that we can know\nof the decision of the council on this awful head is, that its decision,\ninspired by the Holy Spirit, must infallibly be right. We must await\nthat decision, and, when made known, we must embrace it, not only with\nobedience, but with the interior assent of mind and will. But there are\nother results of the council on which we may speculate; and which, I\nbelieve, it will certainly accomplish: first, it will show in a manner\nthat cannot be mistaken that there is only one alternative for the human\nintellect: Rationalism or Faith; and, secondly, it will exhibit to\nthe Christian powers the inevitable future they are now preparing for\nthemselves.\"\n\n\"I am among the faithful,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"Then you must be a member of the Church Catholic,\" said the cardinal.\n\"The basis on which God has willed that His revelation should rest in\nthe world is the testimony of the Catholic Church, which, if considered\nonly as a human and historical witness, affords the highest and\nmost certain evidence for the fact and the contents of the Christian\nreligion. If this be denied, there is no such thing as history. But the\nCatholic Church is not only a human and historical witness of its own\norigin, constitution, and authority, it is also a supernatural and\ndivine witness, which can neither fail nor err. When it oecumenically\nspeaks, it is not merely the voice of the fathers of the world; it\ndeclares what 'it hath seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us.'\"\n\nThere was a pause, and then Lothair remarked: \"You said, air, that\nthe council would show to the civil powers of the Christian world the\ninevitable future they are preparing for themselves?\"\n\n\"Even so. Now mark this, my child. At the Council of Trent the Christian\npowers were represented, and properly so. Their seats will be empty at\nthe Council of the Vatican. What does that mean? The separation between\nChurch and State, talked of for a long time, now demonstrated. And what\ndoes separation between Church and State mean? That society is no longer\nconsecrated. The civil governments of the world no longer profess to be\nCatholic. The faithful indeed among their subjects will be represented\nat the council by their pastors, but the civil powers have separated\nthemselves from the Church; either by royal edict, or legislative\nenactment, or revolutionary changes, they have abolished the legal\nstatus of the Catholic Church within their territory. It is not their\nchoice; they are urged on by an invisible power that is anti-Christian,\nand which is the true, natural, and implacable enemy of the one visible\nand universal Church. The coming anarchy is called progress, because it\nadvances along the line of departure from the old Christian order of the\nworld. Christendom was the offspring of the Christian family, and the\nfoundation of the Christian family is the sacrament of matrimony, the\nsprit of all domestic and public morals. The anti-Christian societies\nare opposed to the principle of home. When they have destroyed the\nhearth, the morality of society will perish. A settlement in the\nfoundations may be slow in sinking, but it brings all down at last.\nThe next step in de-Christianizing the political life of nations is\nto establish national education without Christianity. This is\nsystematically aimed at wherever the revolution has its way. The period\nand policy of Julian are returning. Some think this bodes ill for the\nChurch; no, it is the State that will suffer. The secret societies are\nhurrying the civil governments of the world, and mostly the governments\nwho disbelieve in their existence, to the brink of a precipice, over\nwhich monarchies, and law, and civil order, will ultimately fall and\nperish together.\"\n\n\"Then all is hopeless,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"To human speculation,\" said the cardinal; \"but none can fathom the\nmysteries of Divine interposition. This coming council may save society,\nand on that I would speak to you most earnestly. His holiness has\nresolved to invite the schismatic priesthoods to attend it, and labor to\nbring about the unity of Christendom. He will send an ambassador to the\npatriarch of the heresy of Photius, which is called the Greek Church. He\nwill approach Lambeth. I have little hope of the latter, though there is\nmore than one of the Anglican bishops who revere the memory and example\nof Laud. But I by no means despair of your communion being present in\nsome form at the council. There are true spirits at Oxford who sigh for\nunity. They will form, I hope, a considerable deputation; but, as\nnot yet being prelates, they cannot take their seats formally in the\ncouncil, I wish, in order to increase and assert their influence, that\nthey should be accompanied by a band of powerful laymen, who shall\nrepresent the pious and pure mind of England--the coming guardians of\nthe land in the dark hour that may be at hand. Considering your previous\nknowledge of Rome, your acquaintance with its eminent men and its\nlanguage, and considering too, as I well know, that the Holy Father\nlooks to you as one marked out by Providence to assert the truth, it\nwould please me--and, trust me, it would be wise in you--were you to\nvisit Rome on this sublime occasion, and perhaps put your mark on the\nworld's history.\"\n\n\"It must yet be a long time before the council meets,\" said Lothair,\nafter a pause.\n\n\"Not too long for preparation,\" replied the cardinal. \"From this hour,\nuntil its assembling, the pulse of humanity will throb. Even at this\nhour they are speaking of the same matters as ourselves alike on\nthe Euphrates and the St. Lawrence. The good Catesby is in Ireland,\nconferring with the bishops, and awakening them to the occasion. There\nis a party among them narrow-minded and local, the effects of their\neducation. There ought not to be an Irish priest who was not brought\nup at the Propaganda. You know that admirable institution. We had some\nhappy hours at Rome together--may we soon repeat them! You were very\nunwell there; next time you will judge of Rome in health and vigor.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 85\n\n\nThey say there is a skeleton in every house; it may be doubted. What is\nmore certain are the sorrow and perplexity which sometimes, without a\nwarning and preparation, suddenly fall upon a family living in a world\nof happiness and ease, and meriting their felicity by every gift of\nfortune and disposition.\n\nPerhaps there never was a circle that enjoyed life more, and deserved\nto enjoy life more, than the Brentham family. Never was a family more\nadmired and less envied. Nobody grudged them their happy gifts and\naccidents, for their demeanor was so winning, and their manners so\ncordial and sympathetic, that every one felt as if he shared their\namiable prosperity. And yet, at this moment, the duchess, whose\ncountenance was always as serene as her soul, was walking with disturbed\nvisage and agitated step up and down the private room of the duke;\nwhile his grace, seated, his head upon his arm, and with his eyes on the\nground, was apparently in anxious thought.\n\nNow, what had happened? It seems that these excellent parents had\nbecome acquainted, almost at the same moment, with two astounding and\ndisturbing facts: their son wanted to marry Euphrosyne Cantacuzene, and\ntheir daughter would not marry the Duke of Brecon.\n\n\"I was so perfectly unprepared for the communication,\" said the duke,\nlooking up, \"that I have no doubt I did not express myself as I ought to\nhave done. But I do not think I said any thing wrong. I showed surprise,\nsorrow--no anger. I was careful not to say any thing to hurt his\nfeelings--that is a great point in these matters--nothing disrespectful\nof the young lady. I invited him to speak to me again about it when I\nhad a little got over my surprise.\"\n\n\"It is really a catastrophe,\" exclaimed the duchess; \"and only think,\nI came to you for sympathy in my sorrow, which, after all, though\ndistressing, is only a mortification!\"\n\n\"I am very sorry about Brecon,\" said the duke, \"who is a man of honor,\nand would have suited us very well; but, my dear Augusta, I never took\nexactly the same view of this affair as you did--I was never satisfied\nthat Corisande returned his evident, I might say avowed, admiration of\nher.\"\n\n\"She spoke of him always with great respect,\" said the duchess, \"and\nthat is much in a girl of Corisande's disposition. I never heard her\nspeak of any of her admirers in the same tone--certainly not of Lord\nCarisbrooke; I was quite prepared for her rejection of him. She never\nencouraged him.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the duke, \"I grant you it is mortifying--infinitely\ndistressing; and Brecon is the last man I could have wished that it\nshould occur to; but, after all, our daughter must decide for herself\nin such affairs. She is the person most interested in the event. I never\ninfluenced her sisters in their choice, and she also must be free. The\nother subject is more grave.\"\n\n\"If we could only ascertain who she really is,\" said the duchess.\n\n\"According to Bertram, fully our equal; but I confess I am no judge of\nLevantine nobility,\" his grace added, with a mingled expression of pride\nand despair.\n\n\"That dreadful travelling abroad!\" exclaimed the duchess. \"I always had\na foreboding of something disastrous from it. Why should he have gone\nabroad, who has never been to Ireland, or seen half the counties of his\nown country?\"\n\n\"They all will go,\" said the duke; \"and I thought, with St. Aldegonde,\nhe was safe from getting into any scrape of this kind.\"\n\n\"I should like to speak to Granville about it,\" said the duchess. \"When\nhe is serious, his judgment is good.\"\n\n\"I am to see St. Aldegonde before I speak to Bertram,\" said the duke. \"I\nshould not be surprised if he were here immediately.\"\n\nOne of the social mysteries is, \"how things get about!\" It is not the\ninterest of any of the persons immediately connected with the subject\nthat society should be aware that the Lady Corisande had declined the\nproposal of the Duke of Brecon. Society had no right even to assume that\nsuch a proposal was either expected or contemplated. The Duke of Brecon\nadmired Lady Corisande, so did many others; and many others were admired\nby the Duke of Brecon. The duchess even hoped that, as the season was\nwaning, it might break up, and people go into the country or abroad, and\nnothing be observed. And yet it \"got about.\" The way things get about\nis through the Hugo Bohuns. Nothing escapes their quick eyes and\nslow hearts. Their mission is to peer into society, like professional\nastronomers ever on the watch to detect the slightest change in the\nphenomena. Never embarrassed by any passion of their own, and their only\nsocial scheming being to maintain their transcendent position, all their\nlife and energy are devoted to the discovery of what is taking place\naround them; and experience, combined with natural tact, invests them\nwith almost a supernatural skill in the detection of social secrets.\nAnd so it happened that scarcely a week had passed before Hugo began to\nsniff the air, and then to make fine observations at balls, as to whom\ncertain persons danced with, or did not dance with; and then he began\nthe curious process of what he called putting two and two together, and\nputting two and two together proved in about a fortnight that it was all\nup between Lady Corisande and the Duke of Brecon.\n\nAmong others he imparted this information to Lothair, and it set Lothair\na thinking; and he went to a ball that evening solely with the purpose\nof making social observations like Hugo Bohun. But Lady Corisande was\nnot there, though the Duke of Brecon was, apparently in high spirits,\nand waltzing more than once with Lady Grizell Falkirk. Lothair was not\nvery fortunate in his attempts to see Bertram. He called more than once\nat Crecy House too, but in vain. The fact is, Bertram was naturally\nentirely engrossed with his own difficulties, and the duchess, harassed\nand mortified, could no longer be at home in the morning.\n\nHer grace, however, evinced the just appreciation of character for which\nwomen are remarkable, in the confidence which she reposed in the good\nsense of Lord St. Aldegonde at this crisis. St. Aldegonde was the only\none of his sons-in-law whom the duke really considered and a little\nfeared. When St. Aldegonde was serious, his influence over men\nwas powerful. And he was serious now. St. Aldegonde, who was not\nconventional, had made the acquaintance of Mr. Cantacuzene immediately\non his return to England, and they had become friends. He had dined in\nthe Tyburnian palace of the descendant of the Greek emperors more than\nonce, and had determined to make his second son, who was only four years\nof age, a Greek merchant. When the duke therefore consulted him on \"the\ncatastrophe,\" St. Aldegonde took high ground, spoke of Euphrosyne in\nthe way she deserved, as one equal to an elevated social position, and\ndeserving it. \"But if you ask me my opinion, sir,\" he continued, \"I do\nnot think, except for Bertram's sake, that you have any cause to fret\nyourself. The family wish her to marry her cousin, the eldest son of the\nPrince of Samos. It is an alliance of the highest, and suits them much\nbetter than any connection with us. Besides, Cantacuzene will give\nhis children large fortunes, and they like the money to remain in\nthe family. A hundred or a hundred and fifty thousand pounds--perhaps\nmore--goes a great way on the coasts of Asia Minor. You might buy up\nhalf the Archipelago. The Cantacuzenes are coming to dine with us next\nweek. Bertha is delighted with them. Mr. Cantacuzene is so kind as to\nsay he will take Clovis into his counting-house. I wish I could induce\nyour grace to come and meet him: then you could judge for yourself. You\nwould not be in the least shocked were Bertram to marry the daughter\nof some of our great merchants or bankers. This is a great merchant and\nbanker, and the descendant of princes, and his daughter one of the most\nbeautiful and gifted of women and worthy to be a princess.\"\n\n\"There is a good deal in what St. Aldegonde says,\" said the duke\nafterward to his wife. \"The affair takes rather a different aspect. It\nappears they are really people of high consideration, and great wealth\ntoo. Nobody could describe them as adventurers.\"\n\n\"We might gain a little time,\" said the duchess. \"I dislike peremptory\ndecisions. It is a pity we have not an opportunity of seeing the young\nlady.\"\n\n\"Granville says she is the most beautiful woman he ever met, except her\nsister.\"\n\n\"That is the artist's wife?\" said the duchess.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the duke, \"I believe a most distinguished man, but it rather\nadds to the imbroglio. Perhaps things may turn out better than they\nfirst promised. The fact is, I am more amazed than annoyed. Granville\nknows the father, it seems, intimately. He knows so many odd people. He\nwants me to meet him at dinner. What do you think about it? It is a good\nthing sometimes to judge for one's self. They say this Prince of Samos\nshe is half betrothed to is attach to the Turkish embassy at Vienna, and\nis to visit England.\"\n\n\"My nervous system is quite shaken,\" said the duchess. \"I wish we could\nall go to Brentham. I mentioned it to Corisande this morning, and I was\nsurprised to find that she wished to remain in town.\"\n\n\"Well, we will decide nothing, my dear, in a hurry. St. Aldegonde says\nthat, if we decide in that sense, he will undertake to break off the\nwhole affair. We may rely on that. We need consider the business only\nwith reference to Bertram's happiness and feelings. That is an important\nissue, no doubt, but it is a limited one. The business is not of so\ndisagreeable a nature as it seemed. It is not an affair of a rash\nengagement, in a discreditable quarter, from which he cannot extricate\nhimself. There is no doubt they are thoroughly reputable people, and\nwill sanction nothing which is not decorous and honorable. St. Aldegonde\nhas been a comfort to me in this matter; and you will find out a great\ndeal when you speak to him about it. Things might be worse. I wish I was\nas easy about the Duke of Brecon. I met him this morning and rode with\nhim--to show there was no change in my feelings.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 86\n\n\nThe world goes on with its aching hearts and its smiling faces, and\nvery often, when a year has revolved, the world finds out there was\nno sufficient cause for the sorrows or the smiles. There is too much\nunnecessary anxiety in the world, which is apt too hastily to calculate\nthe consequences of any unforeseen event, quite forgetting that, acute\nas it is in observation, the world, where the future is concerned, is\ngenerally wrong. The duchess would have liked to have buried herself in\nthe shades of Brentham, but Lady Corisande, who deported herself as\nif there were no care at Crecy House except that occasioned by her\nbrother's rash engagement, was of opinion that \"mamma would only brood\nover this vexation in the country,\" and that it would be much better\nnot to anticipate the close of the waning season. So the duchess and her\nlovely daughter were seen everywhere where they ought to be seen, and\nappeared the pictures of serenity and satisfaction.\n\nAs for Bertram's affair itself, under the manipulation of St. Aldegonde,\nit began to assume a less anxious and more practicable aspect. The duke\nwas desirous to secure his son's happiness, but wished nothing to be\ndone rashly. If, for example, in a year's time or so, Bertram continued\nin the same mind, his father would never be an obstacle to his\nwell-considered wishes. In the mean time, an opportunity might offer of\nmaking the acquaintance of the young lady and her friends.\n\nAnd, in the mean time, the world went on dancing, and betting, and\nbanqueting, and making speeches, and breaking hearts and heads, till\nthe time arrived when social stock is taken, the results of the campaign\nestimated and ascertained, and the question asked, \"Where do you think\nof going this year?\"\n\n\"We shall certainly winter at Rome,\" said Lady St. Jerome to Lady\nClanmorne, who was paying a morning visit. \"I wish you could induce Lord\nClanmorne to join us.\"\n\n\"I wish so, too,\" said the lady, \"but that is impossible. He never will\ngive up his hunting.\"\n\n\"I am sure there are more foxes in the Campagna than at Vauxe,\" said\nLady St. Jerome.\n\n\"I suppose you have heard of what they call the double event?\" said Lady\nClanmorne.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, it is quite true; Mr. Bohun told me last night, and he always\nknows every thing.\"\n\n\"Every thing!\" said Lady St. Jerome; \"but what is it that he knows now?\"\n\n\"Both the Ladies Falkirk are to be married! And on the same day.\"\n\n\"But to whom?\"\n\n\"Whom should you think?\"\n\n\"I will not even guess,\" said Lady St. Jerome.\n\n\"Clare,\" she said to Miss Arundel, who was engaged apart, \"you always\nfind out conundrums. Lady Clanmorne has got some news for us. Lady Flora\nFalkirk and her sister are going to be married, and on the same day. And\nto whom, think you?\"\n\n\"Well, I should think that somebody has made Lord Carisbrooke a happy\nman,\" said Miss Arundel.\n\n\"Very good,\" said Lady Clanmorne. \"I think Lady Flora will make an\nexcellent Lady Carisbrooke. He is not quite as tall as she is, but he is\na man of inches. And now for Lady Grizell.\"\n\n\"My powers of divination are quite exhausted,\" said Miss Arundel.\n\n\"Well, I will not keep you in suspense,\" said Lady Clanmorne. \"Lady\nGrizell is to be Duchess of Brecon.\"\n\n\"Duchess of Brecon!\" exclaimed both Miss Arundel and Lady St. Jerome.\n\n\"I always admired the ladies,\" said Miss Arundel. \"We met them at\na country-house last year, and I thought them pleasing in every\nway--artless and yet piquant; but I did not anticipate their fate being\nso soon sealed.\"\n\n\"And so brilliantly,\" added Lady St. Jerome.\n\n\"You met them at Muriel Towers,\" said Lady Clanmorne. \"I heard of you\nthere: a most distinguished party. There was an American lady there, was\nthere not? a charming person, who sang, and acted, and did all sorts of\nthings.\"\n\n\"Yes; there was. I believe, however, she was an Italian, married to an\nAmerican.\"\n\n\"Have you seen much of your host at Muriel Towers?\" said Lady Clanmorne.\n\n\"We see him frequently,\" said Lady St. Jerome.\n\n\"Ah! yes, I remember; I met him at Vauxe the other day. He is a great\nadmirer of yours,\" Lady Clanmorne added, addressing Miss Arundel.\n\n\"Oh! we are friends, and have long been so,\" said Miss Arundel, and she\nleft the room.\n\n\"Clare does not recognize admirers,\" said Lady St. Jerome, gravely.\n\n\"I hope the ecclesiastical fancy is not reviving,\" said Lady Clanmorne.\n\"I was half in hopes that the lord of Muriel Towers might have deprived\nthe Church of its bride.\"\n\n\"That could never be,\" said Lady St. Jerome; \"though, if it could have\nbeen, a source of happiness to Lord St. Jerome and myself would not have\nbeen wanting. We greatly regard our kinsman, but, between ourselves,\"\nadded Lady St. Jerome in a low voice, \"it was supposed that he was\nattached to the American lady of whom you were speaking.\"\n\n\"And where is she now?\"\n\n\"I have heard nothing of late. Lothair was in Italy at the same time as\nourselves, and was ill there, under our roof; so we saw a great deal of\nhim. Afterward he travelled for his health, and has now just returned\nfrom the East.\"\n\nA visitor was announced, and Lady Clanmorne retired.\n\nNothing happens as you expect. On his voyage home Lothair had indulged\nin dreams of renewing his intimacy at Crecy House, around whose hearth\nall his sympathies were prepared to cluster. The first shock to\nthis romance was the news he received of the impending union of Lady\nCorisande with the Duke of Brecon. And, what with this unexpected\nobstacle to intimacy, and the domestic embarrassments occasioned by\nBertram's declaration, he had become a stranger to a roof which had so\nfilled his thoughts. It seemed to him that he could not enter the house\neither as the admirer of the daughter or as the friend of her brother.\nShe was probably engaged to another, and, as Bertram's friend and\nfellow-traveller, he fancied he was looked upon by the family as one who\nhad in some degree contributed to their mortification. Much of this was\nimaginary, but Lothair was very sensitive, and the result was that he\nceased to call at Crecy House, and for some time, kept aloof from the\nduchess and her daughter, when he met them in general society. He was\nglad to hear from Bertram and St. Aldegonde that the position of the\nformer was beginning to soften at home, and that the sharpness of his\nannouncement was passing away. And, when he had clearly ascertained that\nthe contemplated union of Lady Corisande with the duke was certainly\nnot to take place, Lothair began to reconnoitre, and try to resume his\noriginal position. But his reception was not encouraging, at least not\nsufficiently cordial for one who by nature was retiring and reserved.\nLady Corisande was always kind, and after some time he danced with her\nagain. But there were no invitations to luncheon from the duchess; they\nnever asked him to dinner. His approaches were received with courtesy,\nbut he was not courted.\n\nThe announcement of the marriage of the Duke of Brecon did not,\napparently, in any degree, distress Lady Corisande. On the contrary, she\nexpressed much satisfaction at her two young friends settling in life\nwith such success and splendor. The ambition both of Lady Flora and\nLady Grizell was that Corisande should be a bridesmaid. This would be a\nrather awkward post to occupy under the circumstances, so she embraced\nboth, and said that she loved them both so equally, that she would not\ngive a preference to either, and therefore, though she certainly\nwould attend their wedding, she would refrain from taking part in the\nceremony.\n\nThe duchess went with Lady Corisande one morning to Mr. Ruby's to choose\na present from her daughter to each of the young ladies. Mr. Ruby in\na back shop poured forth his treasures of bracelets, and rings, and\nlockets. The presents must be similar in value and in beauty, and yet\nthere must be some difference between them; so it was a rather long and\ntroublesome investigation, Mr. Ruby, as usual, varying its monotony, or\nmitigating its wearisomeness, by occasionally, or suddenly, exhibiting\nsome splendid or startling production of his art. The parure of an\nempress, the bracelets of grand-duchesses, a wonderful fan that was to\nflutter in the hands of majesty, had all in due course appeared, as well\nas the black pearls and yellow diamonds that figure and flash on such\noccasions, before eyes so favored and so fair.\n\nAt last--for, like a prudent general, Mr. Ruby had always a great\nreserve--opening a case, he said, \"There!\" and displayed a crucifix of\nthe most exquisite workmanship and the most precious materials.\n\n\"I have no hesitation in saying the rarest jewel which this century has\nproduced. See! the figure by Monti; a masterpiece. Every emerald in\nthe cross a picked stone. These corners, your grace is aware,\" said\nMr. Ruby, condescendingly, \"contain the earth of the holy places at\nJerusalem. It has been shown to no one but your grace.\"\n\n\"It is indeed most rare and beautiful,\" said the duchess, \"and most\ninteresting, too, from containing the earth of the holy places. A\ncommission, of course?\"\n\n\"From one of our most eminent patrons,\" and then he mentioned Lothair's\nname.\n\nLady Corisande looked agitated.\n\n\"Not for himself,\" said Mr. Ruby.\n\nLady Corisande seemed relieved.\n\n\"It is a present to a young lady--Miss Arundel.\"\n\nLady Corisande changed color, and, turning away, walked toward a case\nof works of art, which was in the centre of the shop, and appeared to be\nengrossed in their examination.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 87\n\n\nA day or two after this adventure of the crucifix, Lothair met Bertram,\nwho said to him, \"By-the-by, if you want to see my people before they\nleave town, you must call at once.\"\n\n\"You do not mean that,\" replied Lothair, much surprised. \"Why, the\nduchess told me, only three or four days ago, that they should not leave\ntown until the end of the first week of August. They are going to the\nweddings.\"\n\n\"I do not know what my mother said to you, my dear fellow, but they go\nto Brentham the day after to-morrow, and will not return. The duchess\nhas been for a long time wishing this, but Corisande would stay. She\nthought they would only bother themselves about my affairs, and there\nwas more distraction for them in town. But now they are going, and it is\nfor Corisande they go. She is not well, and they have suddenly resolved\nto depart.\"\n\n\"Well, I am very sorry to hear it,\" said Lothair; \"I shall call at Crecy\nHouse. Do you think they will see me?\"\n\n\"Certain.\"\n\n\"And what are your plans?\"\n\n\"I have none,\" said Bertram. \"I suppose I must not leave my father alone\nat this moment. He has behaved well; very kindly, indeed. I have nothing\nto complain of. But still all is vague, and I feel somehow or other I\nought to be about him.\"\n\n\"Have you heard from our dear friends abroad?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Bertram, with a sigh, \"Euphrosyne writes to me; but I\nbelieve St. Aldegonde knows more about their views and plans than I do.\nHe and Mr. Phoebus correspond much. I wish to Heaven they were here, or\nrather that we were with them!\" he added, with another sigh. \"How happy\nwe all were, at Jerusalem! How I hate London! And Brentham worse. I\nshall have to go to a lot of agricultural dinners and all sorts of\nthings. The duke expects it, and I am bound now to do every thing to\nplease him. What do you think of doing?\"\n\n\"I neither know nor care,\" said Lothair, in a tone of great despondency.\n\n\"You are a little hipped.\"\n\n\"Not a little. I suppose it is the excitement of the last two years that\nhas spoiled me for ordinary life. But I find the whole thing utterly\nintolerable, and regret now that I did not rejoin the staff of the\ngeneral. I shall never have such a chance again. It was a mistake; but\none is born to blunder.\"\n\nLothair called at Crecy House. The hall-porter was not sure whether the\nduchess was at home, and the groom of the chambers went to see. Lothair\nhad never experienced this form. When the groom of the chambers came\ndown again, he gave her grace's compliments; but she had a headache, and\nwas obliged to lie down, and was sorry she could not see Lothair, who\nwent away livid.\n\nCrecy House was only yards from St. James's Square, and Lothair repaired\nto an accustomed haunt. He was not in a humor for society, and yet he\nrequired sympathy. There were some painful associations with the\nSt. Jerome family, and yet they had many charms. And the painful\nassociations had been greatly removed by their easy and cordial\nreception of him, and the charms had been renewed and increased by\nsubsequent intercourse. After all, they were the only people who had\nalways been kind to him. And, if they had erred in a great particular,\nthey had been animated by pure, and even sacred, motives. And had\nthey erred? Were not his present feelings of something approaching to\ndesolation a fresh proof that the spirit of man can alone be sustained\nby higher relations than merely human ones? So he knocked at the door,\nand Lady St. Jerome was at home. She had not a headache; there were no\nmysterious whisperings between hall-porters and grooms of the chamber,\nto ascertain whether he was one of the initiated. Whether it were London\nor Vauxe, the eyes of the household proved that he was ever a welcome\nand cherished guest.\n\nLady St. Jerome was alone, and rose from her writing-table to receive\nhim. And then--for she was a lady who never lost a moment--she resumed\nsome work, did not interfere with their conversation. Her talking\nresources were so happy and inexhaustible, that it signified little that\nher visitor, who was bound in that character to have something to say,\nwas silent and moody.\n\n\"My lord,\" she continued, \"has taken the Palazzo Agostini for a term. I\nthink we should always pass our winters at Rome under any circumstances,\nbut--the cardinal has spoken to you about the great event--if that comes\noff, of which, between ourselves, whatever the world may say, I believe\nthere is no sort of doubt, we should not think of being absent from Rome\nfor a day during the council.\"\n\n\"Why! it may last years,\" said Lothair. \"There is no reason why it\nshould not last the Council of Trent. It has in reality much more to\ndo.\"\n\n\"We do things quicker now,\" said Lady St. Jerome.\n\n\"That depends on what there is to do. To revive faith is more difficult\nthan to create it.\"\n\n\"There will be no difficulty when the Church has assembled,\" said\nLady St. Jerome. \"This sight of the universal Fathers coming from the\nuttermost ends of the earth to bear witness to the truth will at once\nsweep away all the vain words and vainer thoughts of this unhappy\ncentury. It will be what they call a great fact, dear Lothair; and when\nthe Holy Spirit descends upon their decrees, my firm belief is the whole\nworld will rise as it were from a trance, and kneel before the divine\ntomb of St. Peter.\"\n\n\"Well, we shall see,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"The cardinal wishes you very much to attend the council. He wishes you\nto attend it as an Anglican, representing with a few others our laity.\nHe says it would have the very best effect for religion.\"\n\n\"He spoke to me.\"\n\n\"And you agreed to go?\"\n\n\"I have not refused him. If I thought I could do any good I am not sure\nI would not go,\" said Lothair; \"but, from what I have seen of the Roman\ncourt, there is little hope of reconciling our differences. Rome is\nstubborn. Now, look at the difficulty they make about the marriage of a\nProtestant and one of their own communion. It to cruel, and I think on\ntheir part unwise.\"\n\n\"The sacrament of marriage is of ineffable holiness,\" said Lady St.\nJerome.\n\n\"I do not wish to deny that,\" said Lothair, \"but I see no reason why I\nshould not marry a Roman Catholic if I liked, without the Roman Church\ninterfering and entirely regulating my house and home.\"\n\n\"I wish you would speak to Father Coleman about this,\" said Lady St.\nJerome.\n\n\"I have had much talk with Father Coleman about many things in my time,\"\nsaid Lothair, \"but not about this. By-the-by, have you any news of the\nmonsignore?\"\n\n\"He is in Ireland, arranging about the Oecumenical Council. They do\nnot understand these matters there as well as we do in England, and\nhis holiness, by the cardinal's advice, has sent the monsignore to put\nthings right.\"\n\n\"All the Father Colemans in the world cannot alter the state of affairs\nabout mixed marriages,\" said Lothair; \"they can explain, but they cannot\nalter. I want change in this matter, and Rome never changes.\"\n\n\"It is impossible for the Church to change,\" said Lady St. Jerome,\n\"because it is Truth.\"\n\n\"Is Miss Arundel at home?\" said Lothair.\n\n\"I believe so,\" said Lady St. Jerome.\n\n\"I never see her now,\" he said, discontentedly. \"She never goes to\nballs, and she never rides. Except occasionally under this roof, she is\ninvisible.\"\n\n'\"Clare does not go any longer into society,\" said Lady St. Jerome.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Well, it is a secret,\" said Lady St. Jerome, with some disturbance of\ncountenance and speaking in a lower tone; \"at least at present; and yet\nI can hardly on such a subject wish that there should be a secret from\nyou--Clare is about to take the veil.\"\n\n\"Then I have not a friend left in the world,\" said Lothair, in a\ndespairing tone.\n\nLady St. Jerome looked at him with an anxious glance. \"Yes,\" she\ncontinued; \"I do not wish to conceal it from you, that for a time we\ncould have wished it otherwise--it has been, it is a trying event for\nmy lord and myself--but the predisposition, which was always strong,\nhas ended in a determination so absolute, that we recognize the Divine\npurpose in her decision, and we bow to it.\"\n\n\"I do not bow to it,\" said Lothair; \"I think it barbarous and unwise.\"\n\n\"Hush, hush! dear friend.\"\n\n\"And does the cardinal approve of this step?\"\n\n\"Entirely.\"\n\n\"Then my confidence in him is entirely destroyed,\" said Lothair.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 88\n\n\nIt was August, and town was thinning fast. Parliament still lingered,\nbut only for technical purposes; the political struggle of the session\nhaving terminated at the end of July. One social event was yet to be\nconsummated--the marriages of Lothair's cousins. They were to be married\non the same day, at the same time, and in the same place. Westminster\nAbbey was to be the scene, and, as it was understood that the service\nwas to be choral, great expectations of ecclesiastical splendor and\neffect were much anticipated by the fair sex. They were, however,\ndoomed to disappointment, for, although the day was fine, the attendance\nnumerous and brilliant beyond precedent, Lord Culloden would have\n\"no popery.\" Lord Carisbrooke, who was a ritualist, murmured, and was\nencouraged in his resistance by Lady Clanmorne and a party, but, as the\nDuke of Brecon was high and dry, there was a want of united action, and\nLord Culloden had his way.\n\nAfter the ceremony, the world repaired to the mansion of Lord Culloden\nin Belgrave Square, to inspect the presents, and to partake of a dinner\ncalled a breakfast. Cousin Lothair wandered about the rooms, and had\nthe satisfaction of seeing a bracelet with a rare and splendid sapphire\nwhich he had given to Lady Flora, and a circlet of diamond stars which\nhe had placed on the brow of the Duchess of Brecon. The St. Aldegondes\nwere the only members of the Brentham family who were present. St.\nAldegonde had a taste for marriages and public executions, and Lady\nSt. Aldegonde wandered about with Lothair, and pointed out to him\nCorisande's present to his cousins.\n\n\"I never was more disappointed than by your family leaving town so early\nthis year,\" he said.\n\n\"We were quite surprised.\"\n\n\"I am sorry to bear your sister is indisposed.\"\n\n\"Corisande! she is perfectly well.\"\n\n\"I hope the duchess's headache is better,\" said Lothair. \"She could not\nreceive me when I called to say farewell, because she had a headache.\"\n\n\"I never knew mamma to have a headache,\" said Lady St. Aldegonde.\n\n\"I suppose you will be going to Brentham?\"\n\n\"Next week.\"'\n\n\"And Bertram too?\"\n\n\"I fancy that we shall be all there.\"\n\n\"I suppose we may consider now that the season is really over!\"\n\n\"Yes; they stayed for this. I should not be surprised if every one in\nthese rooms had disappeared by to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Except myself,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"Do you think of going abroad again?\"\n\n\"One might as well go,\" said Lothair, \"as remain.\"\n\n\"I wish Granville would take me to Paris. It seems so odd not to have\nseen Paris. All I want is to see the new streets and dine at a caf.\"\n\n\"Well, you have an object; that is something,\" said Lothair. \"I have\nnone.\"\n\n\"Men have always objects,\" said Lady St. Aldegonde. \"They make business\nwhen they have none, or it makes itself. They move about, and it comes.\"\n\n\"I have moved about a great deal,\" said Lothair, \"and nothing has come\nto me but disappointment. I think I shall take to croquet, like that\ncurious gentleman I remember at Brentham.\"\n\n\"Ah! you remember every thing.\"\n\n\"It is not easy to forget any thing at Brentham,\" said Lothair. \"It is\njust two years ago. That was a happy time.\"\n\n\"I doubt whether our reassembling will be quite as happy this year,\"\nsaid Lady St. Aldegonde, in a serious tone. \"This engagement of Bertram\nis an anxious business; I never saw papa before really fret. And there\nare other things which are not without vexation--at least to mamma.\"\n\n\"I do not think I am a great favorite of your mamma,\" said Lothair. \"She\nonce used to be very kind to me, but she is so no longer.\"\n\n\"I am sure you mistake her,\" said Lady St. Aldegonde, but not in a tone\nwhich indicated any confidence in her remark. \"Mamma is anxious about my\nbrother, and all that.\"\n\n\"I believe the duchess thinks that I am in some way or other connected\nwith this embarrassment; but I really had nothing to do with it, though\nI could not refuse my testimony to the charms of the young lady, and my\nbelief she would make Bertram a happy man.\"\n\n\"As for that, you know, Granville saw a great deal more of her, at least\nat Jerusalem, than you did, and he has said to mamma a great deal more\nthan you have done.\"\n\n\"Yes; but she thinks that, had it not been for me, Bertram would never\nhave known the Phoebus family. She could not conceal that from me, and\nit has poisoned her mind.\"\n\n\"Oh! do not use such words.\"\n\n\"Yes; but they are true. And your sister is prejudiced against me also.\"\n\n\"That I am sure she is not,\" said Lady St. Aldegonde, quickly.\n\"Corisande was always your friend.\"\n\n\"Well, they refused to see me, when we may never meet again for months,\nperhaps for years,\" said Lothair, \"perhaps never.\"\n\n\"What shocking things you are saying, my dear lord, to-day! Here, Lord\nCulloden wants you to return thanks for the bridesmaids. You must put on\na merry face.\"\n\nThe dreary day at last arrived, and very quickly, when Lothair was the\nonly person left in town. When there is nobody you know in London, the\nmillion that go about are only voiceless phantoms. Solitude in a city is\na trance. The motion of the silent beings with whom you have no speech\nor sympathy, only makes the dreamlike existence more intense. It is not\nso in the country; the voices of Nature are abundant, and, from the hum\nof insects to the fall of the avalanche, something is always talking to\nyou.\n\nLothair shrank from the streets. He could not endure the dreary glare of\nSt. James's and the desert sheen of Pall Mall. He could mount his horse\nin the park, and soon lose himself in suburban roads that he once loved.\nYes; it was irresistible; and he made a visit to Belmont. The house\nwas dismantled, and the gardens shorn of their lustre, but still it\nwas there; very fair in the sunshine, and sanctified in his heart. He\nvisited every room that he had frequented, and lingered in her boudoir.\nHe did not forget the now empty pavilion, and he plucked some flowers\nthat she once loved, and pressed them to his lips, and placed them near\nhis heart. He felt now what it was that made him unhappy: it was the\nwant of sympathy.\n\nHe walked through the park to the residence of Mr. Phoebus, where he had\ndirected his groom to meet him. His heart beat as he wandered along, and\nhis eye was dim with tears. What characters and what scenes had he not\nbecome acquainted with since his first visit to Belmont! And, even now,\nwhen they had departed, or were absent, what influence were they not\nexercising over his life, and the life of those most intimate with him!\nHad it not been for his pledge to Theodora, it was far from improbable\nthat he would now have been a member of the Roman Catholic Church, and\nall his hopes at Brentham, and his intimacy with the family on which he\nhad most reckoned in life for permanent friendship and support,\nseemed to be marred and blighted by the witching eyes of that mirthful\nEuphrosyne, whose mocking words on the moonlit terrace at Belmont first\nattracted his notice to her. And then, by association of ideas, he\nthought of the general, and what his old commander had said at their\nlast interview, reminding him of his fine castle, and expressing his\nconviction that the lord of such a domain must have much to do.\n\n\"I will try to do it,\" said Lothair; \"and will go down to Muriel\ntomorrow.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 89\n\n\nLothair, who was very sensible to the charms of Nature, found at first\nrelief in the beauties of Muriel. The season was propitious to the\nscene. August is a rich and leafy month, and the glades and avenues and\nstately trees of his parks and pleasaunces seemed, at the same time, to\nsoothe and gladden his perturbed spirit. Muriel was still new to him,\nand there was much to examine and explore for the first time. He found a\nconsolation also in the frequent remembrance that these scenes had been\nknown to those whom he loved. Often in the chamber, and often in the\nbower, their forms arose; sometimes their voices lingered in his ear; a\nfrolic laugh, or whispered words of kindness and enjoyment. Such a\nplace as Muriel should always be so peopled. But that is impossible.\nOne cannot always have the most agreeable people in the world assembled\nunder one's roof. And yet the alternative should not be the loneliness\nhe now experienced. The analytical Lothair resolved that there was no\nhappiness without sympathy.\n\nThe most trying time were the evenings. A man likes to be alone in the\nmorning. He writes his letters and reads the newspapers, attempts to\nexamine his steward's accounts, and if he wants society can gossip with\nhis stud-groom. But a solitary evening in the country is gloomy, however\nbrilliant the accessories. As Mr. Phoebus was not present, Lothair\nviolated the prime principles of a first-class Aryan education, and\nventured to read a little. It is difficult to decide which is the most\nvaluable companion to a country eremite at his nightly studies, the\nvolume that keeps him awake or the one that sets him a-slumbering.\n\nAt the end of a week Lothair had some good sport on his moors--and this\nreminded him of the excellent Campian, who had received and answered his\nletter. The colonel, however, held out but a faint prospect of returning\nat present to Europe, though, whenever he did, he promised to be the\nguest of Lothair. Lothair asked some of his neighbors to dinner, and he\nmade two large parties to slaughter his grouse. They were grateful and\nhe was popular, but \"we have not an idea in common,\" thought Lothair,\nas, wearied and uninterested, he bade his last guest his last\ngood-night. Then Lothair paid a visit to the lord-lieutenant, and stayed\ntwo nights at Agramont Castle. Here he met many county notables, and\n\"great was the company of the preachers;\" but the talk was local\nor ecclesiastical, and, after the high-spiced condiments of the\nconversation to which he was accustomed, the present discourse was\ninsipid even to nausea. He sought some relief in the society of Lady\nIda Alice, but she blushed when she spoke to him, and tittered when he\nreplied to her; and at last he found refuge in pretty Mrs. Ardenne, who\nconcluded by asking him for his photograph.\n\nOn the morrow of his return to Muriel, the servant bringing in his\nletters, he seized one in the handwriting of Bertram, and, discarding\nthe rest, devoured the communication of his friend, which was eventful.\n\nIt seems that the Phoebus family had returned to England, and were at\nBrentham, and had been there a week. The family were delighted with\nthem, and Euphrosyne was an especial favorite. But this was not all. It\nseems that Mr. Cantacuzene had been down to Brentham, and stayed, which\nhe never did anywhere, a couple of days. And the duke was particularly\ncharmed with Mr. Cantacuzene. This gentleman, who was only in the\nearlier term of middle age, and looked younger than his age, was\ndistinguished in appearance, highly polished, and singularly acute. He\nappeared to be the master of great wealth, for he offered to make upon\nEuphrosyne any settlement which the duke desired. He had no son, and\ndid not wish his sons-in-law to be sighing for his death. He wished his\ndaughters, therefore, to enjoy the bulk of their inheritances in his\nlifetime. He told the duke that he had placed one hundred thousand\npounds in the names of trustees on the marriage of Madame Phoebus, to\naccumulate, \"and when the genius and vanity of her husband are both\nexhausted, though I believe they are inexhaustible,\" remarked Mr.\nCantacuzene, \"it will be a nest's-egg for them to fall back upon, and at\nleast save them from penury.\" The duke had no doubt that Mr. Cantacuzene\nwas of imperial lineage. But the latter portion of the letter was the\nmost deeply interesting to Lothair. Bertram wrote that his mother had\njust observed that she thought the Phoebus family would like to meet\nLothair, and begged Bertram to invite him to Brentham. The letter ended\nby an urgent request, that, if disengaged, he should arrive immediately.\n\nMr. Phoebus highly approved of Brentham. All was art, and art of a high\ncharacter. He knew no residence with an aspect so thoroughly Aryan.\nThough it was really a family party, the house was quite full; at least,\nas Bertram said to Lothair on his arrival, \"there is only room for\nyou--and you are in your old quarters.\"\n\n\"That is exactly what I wished,\" said Lothair.\n\nHe had to escort the duchess to dinner. Her manner was of old days. \"I\nthought you would like to meet your friends,\" she said.\n\n\"It gives me much pleasure, but much more to find myself at Brentham.\"\n\n\"There seems every prospect of Bertram being happy. We are enchanted\nwith the young lady. You know her, I believe, well? The duke is highly\npleased with her, father, Mr. Cantacuzene--he says one of the most\nsensible men he ever met, and a thorough gentleman, which he may\nwell be, for I believe there is no doubt he is of the highest\ndescent--emperors they say, princes even now. I wish you could have\nmet him, but he would only stay eight-and-forty hours. I understand his\naffairs are vast.\"\n\n\"I have always heard a considerable person; quite the head of the Greek\ncommunity in this country--indeed, in Europe generally.\"\n\n\"I see by the morning papers that Miss Arundel has taken the veil.\"\n\n\"I missed my papers to-day,\" said Lothair, a little agitated, \"but I\nhave long been aware of her intention of doing so.\"\n\n\"Lady St. Jerome will miss her very much. She was quite the soul of the\nhouse.\"\n\n\"It must be a great and painful sacrifice,\" said Lothair; \"but, I\nbelieve, long meditated. I remember when I was at Vauxe, nearly two\nyears ago, that I was told this was to be her fate. She was quite\ndetermined on it.\"\n\n\"I saw the beautiful crucifix you gave her, at Mr. Ruby's.\"\n\n\"It was an homage to her for her great goodness to me when I was ill at\nRome--and it was difficult to find any thing that would please or suit\nher. I fixed on the crucifix, because it permitted me to transfer to it\nthe earth of the holy places, which were included in the crucifix,\nthat was given to me by the monks of the Holy Sepulchre, when I made my\npilgrimage to Jerusalem.\"\n\nIn the evening St. Aldegonde insisted on their dancing, and he\nengaged himself to Madame Phoebus. Bertram and Euphrosyne seemed never\nseparated; Lothair was successful in inducing Lady Corisande to be his\npartner.\n\n\"Do you remember your first ball at Crecy House?\" asked Lothair. \"You\nare not nervous now?\"\n\n\"I would hardly say that,\" said Lady Corisande, \"though I try not to\nshow it.\"\n\n\"It was the first ball for both of us,\" said Lothair. \"I have not danced\nso much in the interval as you have. Do you know, I was thinking, just\nnow, I have danced oftener with you than with any one else?\"\n\n\"Are not you glad about Bertram's affair ending so well?\"\n\n\"Very; he will be a happy man. Every body is happy, I think, except\nmyself.\"\n\nIn the course of the evening, Lady St. Aldegonde, on the arm of Lord\nMontairy, stopped for a moment as she passed Lothair, and said: \"Do you\nremember our conversation at Lord Culloden's breakfast? Who was right\nabout mamma?\"\n\nThey passed their long summer days in rambling and riding, and in\nwondrous new games which they played in the hall. The striking feature,\nhowever, were the matches at battledore and shuttlecock between Madame\nPhoebus and Lord St. Aldegonde, in which the skill and energy displayed\nwere supernatural, and led to betting. The evenings were always gay;\nsometimes they danced; more or less they always had some delicious\nsinging. And Mr. Phoebus arranged some tableaux most successfully.\n\nAll this time, Lothair hung much about Lady Corisande; he was by her\nside in the riding-parties, always very near her when they walked, and\nsometimes he managed unconsciously to detach her from the main party,\nand they almost walked alone. If he could not sit by her at dinner,\nhe joined her immediately afterward, and whether it were a dance, a\ntableau, or a new game, somehow or other he seemed always to be her\ncompanion.\n\nIt was about a week after the arrival of Lothair, and they were at\nbreakfast at Brentham, in that bright room full of little round tables\nwhich Lothair always admired, looking, as it did, upon a garden of many\ncolors.\n\n\"How I hate modern gardens!\" said St. Aldegonde. \"What a horrid thing\nthis is! One might as well have a mosaic pavement there. Give me\ncabbage-roses, sweet-peas, and wall-flowers. That is my idea of a\ngarden. Corisande's garden is the only sensible thing of the sort.\"\n\n\"One likes a mosaic pavement to look like a garden,\" said Euphrosyne,\n\"but not a garden like a mosaic pavement.\"\n\n\"The worst of these mosaic beds,\" said Madame Phoebus, \"is, you can\nnever get a nosegay, and if it were not for the kitchen-garden, we\nshould be destitute of that gayest and sweetest of creations.\"\n\n\"Corisande's garden is, since your first visit to Brentham,\" said the\nduchess to Lothair. \"No flowers are admitted that have not perfume. It\nis very old-fashioned. You must get her to show it you.\"\n\nIt was agreed that after breakfast they should go and see Corisande's\ngarden. And a party did go--all the Phoebus family, and Lord and Lady\nSt. Aldegonde, and Lady Corisande, and Bertram, and Lothair.\n\nIn the pleasure-grounds of Brentham were the remains of an ancient\ngarden of the ancient house that had long ago been pulled down. When the\nmodern pleasure-grounds were planned and created, notwithstanding the\nprotests of the artists in landscape, the father of the present duke\nwould not allow this ancient garden to be entirely destroyed, and you\ncame upon its quaint appearance in the dissimilar world in which it was\nplaced, as you might in some festival of romantic costume upon a person\nhabited in the courtly dress of the last century. It was formed upon a\ngentle southern slope, with turfen terraces walled in on three sides,\nthe fourth consisting of arches of golden yew. The duke had given this\ngarden to Lady Corisande, in order that she might practise her theory,\nthat flower-gardens should be sweet and luxuriant, and not hard and\nscentless imitations of works of art. Here, in their season, flourished\nabundantly all those productions of Nature which are now banished from\nour once delighted senses; huge bushes of honey-suckle, and bowers of\nsweet-pea and sweet-brier, and jessamine clustering over the walls, and\ngillyflowers scenting with their sweet breath the ancient bricks from\nwhich they seemed to spring. There were banks of violets which the\nsouthern breeze always stirred, and mignonette filled every vacant nook.\nAs they entered now, it seemed a blaze of roses and carnations, though\none recognized in a moment the presence of the lily, the heliotrope, and\nthe stock. Some white peacocks were basking on the southern wall, and\none of them, as their visitors entered, moved and displayed its plumage\nwith scornful pride. The bees were busy in the air, but their homes were\nnear, and you might watch them laboring in their glassy hives.\n\n\"Now, is not Corisande quite right?\" said Lord St. Aldegonde, as he\npresented Madame Phoebus with a garland of woodbine, with which she said\nshe would dress her head at dinner. All agreed with him, and Bertram and\nEuphrosyne adorned each other with carnations, and Mr. Phoebus placed\na flower on the uncovered head of Lady St. Aldegonde, according to the\nprinciples of high art, and they sauntered and rambled in the sweet and\nsunny air amid a blaze of butterflies and the ceaseless hum of bees.\n\nBertram and Euphrosyne had disappeared; and the rest were lingering\nabout the hives while Mr. Phoebus gave them a lecture on the apiary and\nits marvellous life. The bees understood Mr. Phoebus, at least he said\nso, and thus his friends had considerable advantage in this lesson in\nentomology. Lady Corisande and Lothair were in a distant corner of the\ngarden, and she was explaining to him her plans; what she had done and\nwhat she meant to do.\n\n\"I wish I had a garden like this at Muriel,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"You could easily make one.\"\n\n\"If you helped me.\"\n\n\"I have told you all my plans,\" said Lady Corisande.\n\n\"Yes; but I was thinking of something else when you spoke,\" said\nLothair.\n\n\"That was not very complimentary.\"\n\n\"I do not wish to be complimentary,\" said Lothair, \"if compliments mean\nless than they declare. I was not thinking of your garden, but of you.\"\n\n\"Where can they have all gone?\" said Lady Corisande, looking round. \"We\nmust find them.\"\n\n\"And leave this garden?\" said Lothair. \"And I without a flower, the only\none without a flower? I am afraid that is significant of my lot.\"\n\n\"You shall choose a rose,\" said Lady Corisande.\n\n\"Nay; the charm is, that it should be your choice.\"\n\nBut choosing the rose lost more times and, when Corisande and Lothair\nreached the arches of golden yew, there were no friends in sight.\n\n\"I think I hear sounds this way,\" said Lothair, and he led his companion\nfarther from home.\n\n\"I see no one,\" said Lady Corisande, distressed, and when they had\nadvanced a little way.\n\n\"We are sure to find them in good time,\" said Lothair. \"Besides, I\nwanted to speak to you about the garden at Muriel. I wanted to induce\nyou to go there and help me to make it. Yes,\" he added, after some\nhesitation, \"on this spot--I believe on this very spot--I asked the\npermission of your mother two years ago to express to you my love. She\nthought me a boy, and she treated me as a boy. She said I knew nothing\nof the world, and both our characters were unformed. I know the world\nnow. I have committed many mistakes, doubtless many follies--have formed\nmany opinions, and have changed many opinions; but to one I have been\nconstant, in one I am unchanged--and that is my adoring love to you.\"\n\nShe turned pale, she stopped, then, gently taking his arm, she hid her\nface in his breast.\n\nHe soothed and sustained her agitated frame, and sealed with an embrace\nher speechless form. Then, with soft thoughts and softer words, clinging\nto him, he induced her to resume their stroll, which both of them now\nwished might assuredly be undisturbed. They had arrived at the limit\nof the pleasure-grounds, and they wandered into the park and its most\nsequestered parts. All this time Lothair spoke much, and gave her the\nhistory of his life since he first visited her home. Lady Corisande\nsaid little, but, when she was more composed, she told him that from the\nfirst her heart had been his, but every thing seemed to go against her\nhopes. Perhaps at last, to please her parents, she would have married\nthe Duke of Brecon, had not Lothair returned; and what he had said to\nher that morning at Crecy House had decided her resolution, whatever\nmight be her lot; to unite it to no one else but him. But then came the\nadventure of the crucifix, and she thought all was over for her, and she\nquitted town in despair.\n\n\"Let us rest here for a while;\" said Lothair, \"under the shade of this\noak;\" and Lady Corisande reclined against its mighty trunk, and Lothair\nthrew himself at her feet. He had a great deal still to tell her, and,\namong other things, the story of the pearls, which he had wished to give\nto Theodora.\n\n\"She was, after all, your good genius,\" said Lady Corisande. \"I always\nliked her.\"\n\n\"Well, now,\" said Lothair, \"that case has never been opened. The year\nhas elapsed, but I would not open it, for I had always a wild wish that\nthe person who opened it should be yourself. See, here it is.\" And he\ngave her the case.\n\n\"We will not break the seal,\" said Corisande. \"Let us respect it for\nher sake--ROMA!\" she said, examining it; and then they opened the case.\nThere was the slip of paper which Theodora, at the time, had placed upon\nthe pearls, and on which she had written some unseen words. They were\nread now, and ran thus:\n\n\"THE OFFERING OF THEODORA TO LOTHAIR'S BRIDE.\"\n\n\"Let me place them on you now,\" said Lothair.\n\n\"I will wear them as your chains,\" said Corisande.\n\nThe sun began to tell them that some hours had elapsed since they\nquitted Brentham House. At last a soft hand, which Lothair retained,\ngave him a slight pressure, and a sweet voice whispered: \"Dearest, I\nthink we ought to return.\"\n\nAnd they returned almost in silence. They rather calculated that, taking\nadvantage of the luncheon-hour, Corisande might escape to her room, but\nthey were a little too late. Luncheon was over, and they met the duchess\nand a large party on the terrace.\n\n\"What has become of you, my good people?\" said her grace; \"bells have\nbeen ringing for you in every direction. Where can you have been?\"\n\n\"I have been in Corisande's garden,\" said Lothair, \"and she has given me\na rose.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Lothair, by Benjamin Disraeli\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LOTHAIR ***\n\n***** This file should be named 7835.txt or 7835.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/7\/8\/3\/7835\/\n\nProduced by K.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1180,"split":"test"}
