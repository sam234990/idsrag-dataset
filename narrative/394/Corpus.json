{"ori_id":"5bac8c9c918869b5e59fab36c21fbd914f0e26a0","title":"The Captain's Daughter","context":"The Captain's Daughter\n Pyotr Andreyich Grinyov is the only surviving child of a retired army officer. When Pyotr turns 17, his father sends him into military service in Orenburg. En route Pyotr gets lost in a blizzard, but is rescued by a mysterious man. As a token of his gratitude, Pyotr gives the guide his hareskin coat.\nArriving in Orenburg, Pyotr reports to his commanding officer and is assigned to serve at Fort Belogorsky under captain Ivan Mironov. The fort is little more than a fence around a village, and the captain's wife Vasilisa is really in charge. Pyotr befriends his fellow officer Shvabrin, who has been banished here after a duel resulted in the death of his opponent. When Pyotr dines with the Mironov family, he meets their daughter Masha and falls in love with her. This causes a rift between Pyotr and Shvabrin, who has been turned down by Masha. When Shvabrin insults Masha's honor, Pyotr and Shvabrin duel and Pyotr is injured. Pyotr asks his father's consent to marry Masha, but is refused.\nNot much later, the fortress is besieged by the insurgent Yemelyan Pugachev, who claims to be the murdered emperor Peter III. The cossacks stationed at the fortress defect to the forces of Pugachev, and he takes the fortress easily. He demands that Captain Mironov swear an oath of allegiance to him, and when refused, hangs the Captain and kills his wife. When it is Pyotr's turn, Shvabrin suddenly appears to have defected as well, and upon his advice Pugachev orders Pyotr to be hanged. However, his life is suddenly spared as Pugachev turns out to be the guide who rescued Pyotr from the blizzard, and he recognizes Pyotr whom he remembers with affection.\nThe next evening, Pyotr and Pugachev talk in private. Pyotr impresses Pugachev with the sincerity of his insistence that he cannot serve him. Pugachev decides to let Pyotr go to Orenburg. He is to relay a message to the Governor that Pugachev will be marching on his city. The fort is to be left under the command of Shvabrin, who takes advantage of the situation to try to compel Masha to marry him. Pyotr rushes off to prevent this marriage, but is captured by Pugachev's troops. After explaining the situation to Pugachev, they both ride off to the fortress.\nAfter Masha has been freed, she and Pyotr take off to his father's estate, but they are intercepted by the army. Pyotr decides to stay with the army and sends Masha to his father. The war with Pugachev goes on and Pyotr rejoins the army. But at the moment of Pugachev's defeat, Pyotr is arrested for having friendly relations with Pugachev. During his interrogation, Shvabrin testifies that Pyotr is a traitor. Not willing to drag Masha into court, Pyotr is unable to repudiate this accusation and receives the death penalty. Although Empress Catherine the Great spares his life, Pyotr remains a prisoner.\nMasha understands why Pyotr wasn't able to defend himself and decides to go to St. Petersburg, to present a petition to the empress. In Tsarskoye Selo, she meets a lady of the court and details her plan to see the Empress on Pyotr's behalf. The lady refuses at first, saying that Pyotr is a traitor, but Masha is able to explain all the circumstances. Soon, Masha receives an invitation to see the Empress, and is shocked to recognize her as the lady she had talked to earlier. The Empress has become convinced of Pyotr's innocence and has ordered his release. Pyotr witnesses the beheading of Pugachev. He and Masha are married.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, The Daughter of the Commandant, by Alexksandr\nSergeevich Pushkin, Translated by Mrs. Milne Home\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

The\nnovel here offered to the public is considered by Russians his best\nprose work. Others are _Boris God\u00c3\u00banof_, a dramatic sketch, but never\nintended to be put on the stage, and _The Prisoner of the Caucasus_.\nAmong his poems are \"The Gipsies,\" \"R\u00c3\u00baslan and Ludmilla,\" \"The Fountain\nof Tears,\" and \"Evgeni On\u00c3\u00a9ghin.\" The last, if I mistake not, was\ntranslated into English some years ago. Some of Poushkin's writings\nhaving drawn suspicion on him he was banished to a distant part of the\nEmpire, where he filled sundry administrative posts. The Tzar Nicholai,\non his accession in 1825, recalled him to Petersburg and made him\nHistoriographer. The works of the poet were much admired in society, but\nhe was not happy in his domestic life. His outspoken language made him\nmany enemies, and disgraceful reports were purposely spread abroad\nconcerning him, which resulted in a duel in which he was mortally\nwounded by his brother-in-law, George Danth\u00c3\u00a8s. His death was mourned\npublicly by all Russia.\n\nM.P.M.H.\n\nApril, 1891.\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS.\n\n\nCHAPTER\n\nI.    Sergeant of the Guards\nII.   The Guide\nIII.  The Little Fort\nIV.

Since\nthat time he had always lived on his estate in the district of Simbirsk,\nwhere he married Avdotia, the eldest daughter of a poor gentleman in the\nneighbourhood. Of the nine children born of this union I alone survived;\nall my brothers and sisters died young. I had been enrolled as sergeant\nin the S\u00c3\u00a9m\u00c3\u00a9nofsky regiment by favour of the major of the Guard, Prince\nBanojik, our near relation. I was supposed to be away on leave till my\neducation was finished. At that time we were brought up in another\nmanner than is usual now.\n\nFrom five years old I was given over to the care of the huntsman,\nSav\u00c3\u00a9liitch,[2] who from his steadiness and sobriety was considered\nworthy of becoming my attendant. Thanks to his care, at twelve years old\nI could read and write, and was considered a good judge of the points of\na greyhound. At this time, to complete my education, my father hired a\nFrenchman, M. Beaupr\u00c3\u00a9, who was imported from Moscow at the same time as\nthe annual provision of wine and Provence oil. His arrival displeased\nSav\u00c3\u00a9liitch very much.\n\n\"It seems to me, thank heaven,\" murmured he, \"the child was washed,\ncombed, and fed. What was the good of spending money and hiring a\n'_moussi\u00c3\u00a9_,' as if there were not enough servants in the house?\"\n\nBeaupr\u00c3\u00a9, in his native country, had been a hairdresser, then a soldier\nin Prussia, and then had come to Russia to be \"_outchitel_,\" without\nvery well knowing the meaning of this word.[3] He was a good creature,\nbut wonderfully absent and hare-brained. His greatest weakness was a\nlove of the fair sex. Neither, as he said himself, was he averse to the\nbottle, that is, as we say in Russia, that his passion was drink. But,\nas in our house the wine only appeared at table, and then only in\n_liqueur_ glasses, and as on these occasions it somehow never came to\nthe turn of the \"_outchitel_\" to be served at all, my Beaupr\u00c3\u00a9 soon\naccustomed himself to the Russian brandy, and ended by even preferring\nit to all the wines of his native country as much better for the\nstomach. We became great friends, and though, according to the contract,\nhe had engaged himself to teach me _French, German, and all the\nsciences_, he liked better learning of me to chatter Russian\nindifferently. Each of us busied himself with our own affairs; our\nfriendship was firm, and I did not wish for a better mentor. But Fate\nsoon parted us, and it was through an event which I am going to relate.\n\nThe washerwoman, Polashka, a fat girl, pitted with small-pox, and the\none-eyed cow-girl, Akoulka, came one fine day to my mother with such\nstories against the \"_moussi\u00c3\u00a9_,\" that she, who did not at all like these\nkind of jokes, in her turn complained to my father, who, a man of hasty\ntemperament, instantly sent for that _rascal of a Frenchman_. He was\nanswered humbly that the \"_moussi\u00c3\u00a9_\" was giving me a lesson. My father\nran to my room. Beaupr\u00c3\u00a9 was sleeping on his bed the sleep of the just.\nAs for me, I was absorbed in a deeply interesting occupation. A map had\nbeen procured for me from Moscow, which hung against the wall without\never being used, and which had been tempting me for a long time from the\nsize and strength of its paper. I had at last resolved to make a kite of\nit, and, taking advantage of Beaupr\u00c3\u00a9's slumbers, I had set to work.\n\nMy father came in just at the very moment when I was tying a tail to the\nCape of Good Hope.\n\nAt the sight of my geographical studies he boxed my ears sharply, sprang\nforward to Beaupr\u00c3\u00a9's bed, and, awaking him without any consideration, he\nbegan to assail him with reproaches. In his trouble and confusion\nBeaupr\u00c3\u00a9 vainly strove to rise; the poor \"_outchitel_\" was dead drunk.\nMy father pulled him up by the collar of his coat, kicked him out of the\nroom, and dismissed him the same day, to the inexpressible joy of\nSav\u00c3\u00a9liitch.\n\nThus was my education finished.\n\nI lived like a stay-at-home son (_n\u00c3\u00a9doross'l_),[4] amusing myself by\nscaring the pigeons on the roofs, and playing leapfrog with the lads of\nthe courtyard,[5] till I was past the age of sixteen. But at this age my\nlife underwent a great change.\n\nOne autumn day, my mother was making honey jam in her parlour, while,\nlicking my lips, I was watching the operations, and occasionally tasting\nthe boiling liquid. My father, seated by the window, had just opened the\n_Court Almanack_, which he received every year. He was very fond of\nthis book; he never read it except with great attention, and it had the\npower of upsetting his temper very much. My mother, who knew all his\nwhims and habits by heart, generally tried to keep the unlucky book\nhidden, so that sometimes whole months passed without the _Court\nAlmanack_ falling beneath his eye. On the other hand, when he did chance\nto find it, he never left it for hours together. He was now reading it,\nfrequently shrugging his shoulders, and muttering, half aloud--\n\n\"General! He was sergeant in my company. Knight of the Orders of Russia!\nWas it so long ago that we--\"\n\nAt last my father threw the _Almanack_ away from him on the sofa, and\nremained deep in a brown study, which never betokened anything good.\n\n\"Avdotia Vassili\u00c3\u00a9va,\"[6] said he, sharply addressing my mother, \"how\nold is Petr\u00c3\u00b3usha?\"[7]\n\n\"His seventeenth year has just begun,\" replied my mother. \"Petr\u00c3\u00b3usha was\nborn the same year our Aunt Anastasia Garasimofna[8] lost an eye, and\nthat--\"\n\n\"All right,\" resumed my father; \"it is time he should serve. 'Tis time\nhe should cease running in and out of the maids' rooms and climbing into\nthe dovecote.\"\n\nThe thought of a coming separation made such an impression on my mother\nthat she dropped her spoon into her saucepan, and her eyes filled with\ntears. As for me, it is difficult to express the joy which took\npossession of me. The idea of service was mingled in my mind with the\nliberty and pleasures offered by the town of Petersburg. I already saw\nmyself officer of the Guard, which was, in my opinion, the height of\nhuman happiness.\n\nMy father neither liked to change his plans, nor to defer the execution\nof them. The day of my departure was at once fixed. The evening before\nmy father told me that he was going to give me a letter for my future\nsuperior officer, and bid me bring him pen and paper.\n\n\"Don't forget, Andr\u00c3\u00a9j Petr\u00c3\u00b3vitch,\" said my mother, \"to remember me to\nPrince Banojik; tell him I hope he will do all he can for my Petr\u00c3\u00b3usha.\"\n\n\"What nonsense!\" cried my father, frowning. \"Why do you wish me to write\nto Prince Banojik?\"\n\n\"But you have just told us you are good enough to write to Petr\u00c3\u00b3usha's\nsuperior officer.\"\n\n\"Well, what of that?\"\n\n\"But Prince Banojik is Petr\u00c3\u00b3usha's superior officer. You know very well\nhe is on the roll of the S\u00c3\u00a9m\u00c3\u00a9nofsky regiment.\"\n\n\"On the roll! What is it to me whether he be on the roll or no?\nPetr\u00c3\u00b3usha shall not go to Petersburg! What would he learn there? To\nspend money and commit follies. No, he shall serve with the army, he\nshall smell powder, he shall become a soldier and not an idler of the\nGuard, he shall wear out the straps of his knapsack. Where is his\ncommission? Give it to me.\"\n\nMy mother went to find my commission, which she kept in a box with my\nchristening clothes, and gave it to my father with, a trembling hand. My\nfather read it with attention, laid it before him on the table, and\nbegan his letter.\n\nCuriosity pricked me.\n\n\"Where shall I be sent,\" thought I, \"if not to Petersburg?\"\n\nI never took my eyes off my father's pen as it travelled slowly over the\npaper. At last he finished his letter, put it with my commission into\nthe same cover, took off his spectacles, called me, and said--\n\n\"This letter is addressed to Andr\u00c3\u00a9j Karlovitch R., my old friend and\ncomrade. You are to go to Orenburg[9] to serve under him.\"\n\nAll my brilliant expectations and high hopes vanished. Instead of the\ngay and lively life of Petersburg, I was doomed to a dull life in a far\nand wild country. Military service, which a moment before I thought\nwould be delightful, now seemed horrible to me. But there was nothing\nfor it but resignation. On the morning of the following day a travelling\n_kibitka_ stood before the hall door. There were packed in it a trunk\nand a box containing a tea service, and some napkins tied up full of\nrolls and little cakes, the last I should get of home pampering.\n\nMy parents gave me their blessing, and my father said to me--\n\n\"Good-bye, Petr'; serve faithfully he to whom you have sworn fidelity;\nobey your superiors; do not seek for favours; do not struggle after\nactive service, but do not refuse it either, and remember the proverb,\n'Take care of your coat while it is new, and of your honour while it is\nyoung.'\"\n\nMy mother tearfully begged me not to neglect my health, and bade\nSav\u00c3\u00a9liitch take great care of the darling. I was dressed in a short\n\"_touloup_\"[10] of hareskin, and over it a thick pelisse of foxskin. I\nseated myself in the _kibitka_ with Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch, and started for my\ndestination, crying bitterly.\n\nI arrived at Simbirsk during the night, where I was to stay twenty-four\nhours, that Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch might do sundry commissions entrusted to him. I\nremained at an inn, while Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch went out to get what he wanted.\nTired of looking out at the windows upon a dirty lane, I began wandering\nabout the rooms of the inn. I went into the billiard room. I found there\na tall gentleman, about forty years of age, with long, black\nmoustachios, in a dressing-gown, a cue in his hand, and a pipe in his\nmouth. He was playing with the marker, who was to have a glass of brandy\nif he won, and, if he lost, was to crawl under the table on all fours. I\nstayed to watch them; the longer their games lasted, the more frequent\nbecame the all-fours performance, till at last the marker remained\nentirely under the table. The gentleman addressed to him some strong\nremarks, as a funeral sermon, and proposed that I should play a game\nwith him. I replied that I did not know how to play billiards. Probably\nit seemed to him very odd. He looked at me with a sort of pity.\nNevertheless, he continued talking to me. I learnt that his name was\nIv\u00c3\u00a1n Iv\u00c3\u00a1novitch[11] Zourine, that he commanded a troop in the ----th\nHussars, that he was recruiting just now at Simbirsk, and that he had\nestablished himself at the same inn as myself. Zourine asked me to lunch\nwith him, soldier fashion, and, as we say, on what Heaven provides. I\naccepted with pleasure; we sat down to table; Zourine drank a great\ndeal, and pressed me to drink, telling me I must get accustomed to the\nservice. He told good stories, which made me roar with laughter, and we\ngot up from table the best of friends. Then he proposed to teach me\nbilliards.\n\n\"It is,\" said he, \"a necessity for soldiers like us. Suppose, for\ninstance, you come to a little town; what are you to do? One cannot\nalways find a Jew to afford one sport. In short, you must go to the inn\nand play billiards, and to play you must know how to play.\"\n\nThese reasons completely convinced me, and with great ardour I began\ntaking my lesson. Zourine encouraged me loudly; he was surprised at my\nrapid progress, and after a few lessons he proposed that we should play\nfor money, were it only for a \"_groch_\" (two kopeks),[12] not for the\nprofit, but that we might not play for nothing, which, according to him,\nwas a very bad habit.\n\nI agreed to this, and Zourine called for punch; then he advised me to\ntaste it, always repeating that I must get accustomed to the service.\n\n\"And what,\" said he, \"would the service be without punch?\"\n\nI followed his advice. We continued playing, and the more I sipped my\nglass, the bolder I became. My balls flew beyond the cushions. I got\nangry; I was impertinent to the marker who scored for us. I raised the\nstake; in short, I behaved like a little boy just set free from school.\nThus the time passed very quickly. At last Zourine glanced at the clock,\nput down his cue, and told me I had lost a hundred roubles.[13] This\ndisconcerted me very much; my money was in the hands of Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch. I\nwas beginning to mumble excuses, when Zourine said--\n\n\"But don't trouble yourself; I can wait, and now let us go to\nArin\u00c3\u00bashka's.\"\n\nWhat could you expect? I finished my day as foolishly as I had begun it.\nWe supped with this Arin\u00c3\u00bashka. Zourine always filled up my glass,\nrepeating that I must get accustomed to the service.\n\nUpon leaving the table I could scarcely stand. At midnight Zourine took\nme back to the inn.\n\nSav\u00c3\u00a9liitch came to meet us at the door.\n\n\"What has befallen you?\" he said to me in a melancholy voice, when he\nsaw the undoubted signs of my zeal for the service. \"Where did you thus\nswill yourself? Oh! good heavens! such a misfortune never happened\nbefore.\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, old owl,\" I replied, stammering; \"I am sure you are\ndrunk. Go to bed, ... but first help me to bed.\"\n\nThe next day I awoke with a bad headache. I only remembered confusedly\nthe occurrences of the past evening. My meditations were broken by\nSav\u00c3\u00a9liitch, who came into my room with a cup of tea.\n\n\"You begin early making free, Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch,\" he said to me, shaking\nhis head. \"Well, where do you get it from? It seems to me that neither\nyour father nor your grandfather were drunkards. We needn't talk of\nyour mother; she has never touched a drop of anything since she was\nborn, except '_kvass_.'[14] So whose fault is it? Whose but the\nconfounded '_moussi\u00c3\u00a9_;' he taught you fine things, that son of a dog,\nand well worth the trouble of taking a Pagan for your servant, as if our\nmaster had not had enough servants of his own!\"\n\nI was ashamed. I turned round and said to him--\n\n\"Go away, Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch; I don't want any tea.\"\n\nBut it was impossible to quiet Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch when once he had begun to\nsermonize.\n\n\"Do you see now, Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch,\" said he, \"what it is to commit\nfollies? You have a headache; you won't take anything. A man who gets\ndrunk is good for nothing. Do take a little pickled cucumber with honey\nor half a glass of brandy to sober you. What do you think?\"\n\nAt this moment a little boy came in, who brought me a note from Zourine.\nI unfolded it and read as follows:--\n\n\"DEAR PETR' ANDR\u00c3\u0089J\u00c3\u008fTCH,\n\n\"Oblige me by sending by bearer the hundred roubles you lost to me\nyesterday. I want money dreadfully.\n\n\"Your devoted\n\n\"IV\u00c3\u0081N ZOURINE.\"\n\nThere was nothing for it. I assumed a look of indifference, and,\naddressing myself to Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch, I bid him hand over a hundred roubles\nto the little boy.\n\n\"What--why?\" he asked me in great surprise.\n\n\"I owe them to him,\" I answered as coldly as possible.\n\n\"You owe them to him!\" retorted Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch, whose surprise became\ngreater. \"When had you the time to run up such a debt? It is\nimpossible. Do what you please, excellency, but I will not give this\nmoney.\"\n\nI then considered that, if in this decisive moment I did not oblige this\nobstinate old man to obey me, it would be difficult for me in future to\nfree myself from his tutelage. Glancing at him haughtily, I said to\nhim--\n\n\"I am your master; you are my servant. The money is mine; I lost it\nbecause I chose to lose it. I advise you not to be headstrong, and to\nobey your orders.\"\n\nMy words made such an impression on Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch that he clasped his hands\nand remained dumb and motionless.\n\n\"What are you standing there for like a stock?\" I exclaimed, angrily.\n\nSav\u00c3\u00a9liitch began to weep.\n\n\"Oh! my father, Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch,\" sobbed he, in a trembling voice; \"do\nnot make me die of sorrow. Oh! my light, hearken to me who am old;\nwrite to this robber that you were only joking, that we never had so\nmuch money. A hundred roubles! Good heavens! Tell him your parents have\nstrictly forbidden you to play for anything but nuts.\"\n\n\"Will you hold your tongue?\" said I, hastily, interrupting him. \"Hand\nover the money, or I will kick you out of the place.\"\n\nSav\u00c3\u00a9liitch looked at me with a deep expression of sorrow, and went to\nfetch my money. I was sorry for the poor old man, but I wished to assert\nmyself, and prove that I was not a child. Zourine got his hundred\nroubles.\n\nSav\u00c3\u00a9liitch was in haste to get me away from this unlucky inn; he came in\ntelling me the horses were harnessed. I left Simbirsk with an uneasy\nconscience, and with some silent remorse, without taking leave of my\ninstructor, whom I little thought I should ever see again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nTHE GUIDE.\n\n\nMy reflections during the journey were not very pleasant. According to\nthe value of money at that time, my loss was of some importance. I could\nnot but confess to myself that my conduct at the Simbirsk Inn had been\nmost foolish, and I felt guilty toward Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch. All this worried me.\nThe old man sat, in sulky silence, in the forepart of the sledge, with\nhis face averted, every now and then giving a cross little cough. I had\nfirmly resolved to make peace with him, but I did not know how to begin.\nAt last I said to him--\n\n\"Look here, Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch, let us have done with all this; let us make\npeace.\"\n\n\"Oh! my little father, Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch,\" he replied, with a deep sigh,\n\"I am angry with myself; it is I who am to blame for everything. What\npossessed me to leave you alone in the inn? But what could I do; the\ndevil would have it so, else why did it occur to me to go and see my\ngossip the deacon's wife, and thus it happened, as the proverb says, 'I\nleft the house and was taken to prison.' What ill-luck! What ill-luck!\nHow shall I appear again before my master and mistress? What will they\nsay when they hear that their child is a drunkard and a gamester?\"\n\nTo comfort poor Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch, I gave him my word of honour that in future\nI would not spend a single kopek without his consent. Gradually he\ncalmed down, though he still grumbled from time to time, shaking his\nhead--\n\n\"A hundred roubles, it is easy to talk!\"\n\nI was approaching my destination. Around me stretched a wild and dreary\ndesert, intersected by little hills and deep ravines. All was covered\nwith snow. The sun was setting. My _kibitka_ was following the narrow\nroad, or rather the track, left by the sledges of the peasants. All at\nonce my driver looked round, and addressing himself to me--\n\n\"Sir,\" said he, taking off his cap, \"will you not order me to turn\nback?\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"The weather is uncertain. There is already a little wind. Do you not\nsee how it is blowing about the surface snow.\"\n\n\"Well, what does that matter?\"\n\n\"And do you see what there is yonder?\"\n\nThe driver pointed east with his whip.\n\n\"I see nothing more than the white steppe and the clear sky.\"\n\n\"There, there; look, that little cloud!\"\n\nI did, in fact, perceive on the horizon a little white cloud which I\nhad at first taken for a distant hill. My driver explained to me that\nthis little cloud portended a \"_bourane_.\"[15] I had heard of the\nsnowstorms peculiar to these regions, and I knew of whole caravans\nhaving been sometimes buried in the tremendous drifts of snow.\nSav\u00c3\u00a9liitch was of the same opinion as the driver, and advised me to turn\nback, but the wind did not seem to me very violent, and hoping to reach\nin time the next posting station, I bid him try and get on quickly. He\nput his horses to a gallop, continually looking, however, towards the\neast. But the wind increased in force, the little cloud rose rapidly,\nbecame larger and thicker, at last covering the whole sky. The snow\nbegan to fall lightly at first, but soon in large flakes. The wind\nwhistled and howled; in a moment the grey sky was lost in the whirlwind\nof snow which the wind raised from the earth, hiding everything around\nus.\n\n\"How unlucky we are, excellency,\" cried the driver; \"it is the\n_bourane_.\"\n\nI put my head out of the _kibitka_; all was darkness and confusion. The\nwind blew with such ferocity that it was difficult not to think it an\nanimated being.\n\nThe snow drifted round and covered us. The horses went at a walk, and\nsoon stopped altogether.\n\n\"Why don't you go on?\" I said, impatiently, to the driver.\n\n\"But where to?\" he replied, getting out of the sledge. \"Heaven only\nknows where we are now. There is no longer any road, and it is all\ndark.\"\n\nI began to scold him, but Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch took his part.\n\n\"Why did you not listen to him?\" he said to me, angrily. \"You would have\ngone back to the post-house; you would have had some tea; you could\nhave slept till morning; the storm would have blown over, and we should\nhave started. And why such haste? Had it been to get married, now!\"\n\nSav\u00c3\u00a9liitch was right. What was there to do? The snow continued to\nfall--a heap was rising around the _kibitka_. The horses stood\nmotionless, hanging their heads and shivering from time to time.\n\nThe driver walked round them, settling their harness, as if he had\nnothing else to do. Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch grumbled. I was looking all round in\nhopes of perceiving some indication of a house or a road; but I could\nnot see anything but the confused whirling of the snowstorm.\n\nAll at once I thought I distinguished something black.\n\n\"Hullo, driver!\" I exclaimed, \"what is that black thing over there?\"\n\nThe driver looked attentively in the direction I was pointing out.\n\n\"Heaven only knows, excellency,\" replied he, resuming his seat.\n\n\"It is not a sledge, it is not a tree, and it seems to me that it moves.\nIt must be a wolf or a man.\"\n\nI ordered him to move towards the unknown object, which came also to\nmeet us. In two minutes I saw it was a man, and we met.\n\n\"Hey, there, good man,\" the driver hailed him, \"tell us, do you happen\nto know the road?\"\n\n\"This is the road,\" replied the traveller. \"I am on firm ground; but\nwhat the devil good does that do you?\"\n\n\"Listen, my little peasant,\" said I to him, \"do you know this part of\nthe country? Can you guide us to some place where we may pass the\nnight?\"\n\n\"Do I know this country? Thank heaven,\" rejoined the stranger, \"I have\ntravelled here, on horse and afoot, far and wide. But just look at this\nweather! One cannot keep the road. Better stay here and wait; perhaps\nthe hurricane will cease and the sky will clear, and we shall find the\nroad by starlight.\"\n\nHis coolness gave me courage, and I resigned myself to pass the night on\nthe steppe, commending myself to the care of Providence, when suddenly\nthe stranger, seating himself on the driver's seat, said--\n\n\"Grace be to God, there _is_ a house not far off. Turn to the right, and\ngo on.\"\n\n\"Why should I go to the right?\" retorted my driver, ill-humouredly.\n\n\"How do you know where the road is that you are so ready to say, 'Other\npeople's horses, other people's harness--whip away!'\"\n\nIt seemed to me the driver was right.\n\n\"Why,\" said I to the stranger, \"do you think a house is not far off?\"\n\n\"The wind blew from that direction,\" replied he, \"and I smelt smoke, a\nsure sign that a house is near.\"\n\nHis cleverness and the acuteness of his sense of smell alike astonished\nme. I bid the driver go where the other wished. The horses ploughed\ntheir way through the deep snow. The _kibitka_ advanced slowly,\nsometimes upraised on a drift, sometimes precipitated into a ditch, and\nswinging from side to side. It was very like a boat on a stormy sea.\n\nSav\u00c3\u00a9liitch groaned deeply as every moment he fell upon me. I lowered the\n_tsinofka_,[16] I rolled myself up in my cloak and I went to sleep,\nrocked by the whistle of the storm and the lurching of the sledge. I had\nthen a dream that I have never forgotten, and in which I still see\nsomething prophetic, as I recall the strange events of my life. The\nreader will forgive me if I relate it to him, as he knows, no doubt, by\nexperience how natural it is for man to retain a vestige of superstition\nin spite of all the scorn for it he may think proper to assume.\n\nI had reached the stage when the real and unreal begin to blend into the\nfirst vague visions of drowsiness. It seemed to me that the snowstorm\ncontinued, and that we were wandering in the snowy desert. All at once I\nthought I saw a great gate, and we entered the courtyard of our house.\nMy first thought was a fear that my father would be angry at my\ninvoluntary return to the paternal roof, and would attribute it to a\npremeditated disobedience. Uneasy, I got out of my _kibitka_, and I saw\nmy mother come to meet me, looking very sad.\n\n\"Don't make a noise,\" she said to me. \"Your father is on his death-bed,\nand wishes to bid you farewell.\"\n\nStruck with horror, I followed her into the bedroom. I look round; the\nroom is nearly dark. Near the bed some people were standing, looking sad\nand cast down. I approached on tiptoe. My mother raised the curtain, and\nsaid--\n\n\"Andr\u00c3\u00a9j Petr\u00c3\u00b3vitch, Petr\u00c3\u00b3usha has come back; he came back having heard\nof your illness. Give him your blessing.\"\n\nI knelt down. But to my astonishment instead of my father I saw in the\nbed a black-bearded peasant, who regarded me with a merry look. Full of\nsurprise, I turned towards my mother.\n\n\"What does this mean?\" I exclaimed. \"It is not my father. Why do you\nwant me to ask this peasant's blessing?\"\n\n\"It is the same thing, Petr\u00c3\u00b3usha,\" replied my mother. \"That person is\nyour _godfather_.[17] Kiss his hand, and let him bless you.\"\n\nI would not consent to this. Whereupon the peasant sprang from the bed,\nquickly drew his axe from his belt, and began to brandish it in all\ndirections. I wished to fly, but I could not. The room seemed to be\nsuddenly full of corpses. I stumbled against them; my feet slipped in\npools of blood. The terrible peasant called me gently, saying to me--\n\n\"Fear nothing, come near; come and let me bless you.\"\n\nFear had stupified me....\n\nAt this moment I awoke. The horses had stopped; Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch had hold of\nmy hand.\n\n\"Get out, excellency,\" said he to me; \"here we are.\"\n\n\"Where?\" I asked, rubbing my eyes.\n\n\"At our night's lodging. Heaven has helped us; we came by chance right\nupon the hedge by the house. Get out, excellency, as quick as you can,\nand let us see you get warm.\"\n\nI got out of the _kibitka_. The snowstorm still raged, but less\nviolently. It was so dark that one might, as we say, have as well been\nblind. The host received us near the entrance, holding a lantern beneath\nthe skirt of his caftan, and led us into a room, small but prettily\nclean, lit by a _loutchina_.[18] On the wall hung a long carbine and a\nhigh Cossack cap.\n\nOur host, a Cossack of the Ya\u00c3\u00afk,[19] was a peasant of about sixty, still\nfresh and hale. Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch brought the tea canister, and asked for a\nfire that he might make me a cup or two of tea, of which, certainly, I\nnever had more need. The host hastened to wait upon him.\n\n\"What has become of our guide? Where is he?\" I asked Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch.\n\n\"Here, your excellency,\" replied a voice from above.\n\nI raised my eyes to the recess above the stove, and I saw a black beard\nand two sparkling eyes.\n\n\"Well, are you cold?\"\n\n\"How could I not be cold,\" answered he, \"in a little caftan all holes? I\nhad a _touloup_, but, it's no good hiding it, I left it yesterday in\npawn at the brandy shop; the cold did not seem to me then so keen.\"\n\nAt this moment the host re-entered with the boiling _samovar_.[20] I\noffered our guide a cup of tea. He at once jumped down.\n\nI was struck by his appearance. He was a man about forty, middle height,\nthin, but broad-shouldered. His black beard was beginning to turn grey;\nhis large quick eyes roved incessantly around. In his face there was an\nexpression rather pleasant, but slightly mischievous. His hair was cut\nshort. He wore a little torn _armak_,[21] and wide Tartar trousers.\n\nI offered him a cup of tea; he tasted it, and made a wry face.\n\n\"Do me the favour, your excellency,\" said he to me, \"to give me a glass\nof brandy; we Cossacks do not generally drink tea.\"\n\nI willingly acceded to his desire. The host took from one of the shelves\nof the press a jug and a glass, approached him, and, having looked him\nwell in the face--\n\n\"Well, well,\" said he, \"so here you are again in our part of the world.\nWhere, in heaven's name, do you come from now?\"\n\nMy guide winked in a meaning manner, and replied by the well-known\nsaying--\n\n\"The sparrow was flying about in the orchard; he was eating hempseed;\nthe grandmother threw a stone at him, and missed him. And you, how are\nyou all getting on?\"\n\n\"How are we all getting on?\" rejoined the host, still speaking in\nproverbs.\n\n\"Vespers were beginning to ring, but the wife of the _pope_[22] forbid\nit; the pope went away on a visit, and the devils are abroad in the\nchurchyard.\"\n\n\"Shut up, uncle,\" retorted the vagabond. \"When it rains there will be\nmushrooms, and when you find mushrooms you will find a basket to put\nthem in. But now\" (he winked a second time) \"put your axe behind your\nback,[23] the gamekeeper is abroad. To the health of your excellency.\"\n\nSo saying he took the glass, made the sign of the cross, and swallowed\nhis brandy at one gulp, then, bowing to me, returned to his lair above\nthe stove.\n\nI could not then understand a single word of the thieves' slang they\nemployed. It was only later on that I understood that they were talking\nabout the army of the Ya\u00c3\u00afk, which had only just been reduced to\nsubmission after the revolt of 1772.[24]\n\nSav\u00c3\u00a9liitch listened to them talking with a very discontented manner, and\ncast suspicious glances, sometimes on the host and sometimes on the\nguide.\n\nThe kind of inn where we had sought shelter stood in the very middle of\nthe steppe, far from the road and from any dwelling, and certainly was\nby no means unlikely to be a robber resort. But what could we do? We\ncould not dream of resuming our journey. Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch's uneasiness amused\nme very much. I stretched myself on a bench. My old retainer at last\ndecided to get up on the top of the stove,[25] while the host lay down\non the floor. They all soon began to snore, and I myself soon fell dead\nasleep.\n\nWhen I awoke, somewhat late, on the morrow I saw that the storm was\nover. The sun shone brightly; the snow stretched afar like a dazzling\nsheet. The horses were already harnessed. I paid the host, who named\nsuch a mere trifle as my reckoning that Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch did not bargain as he\nusually did. His suspicions of the evening before were quite gone. I\ncalled the guide to thank him for what he had done for us, and I told\nSav\u00c3\u00a9liitch to give him half a rouble as a reward.\n\nSav\u00c3\u00a9liitch frowned.\n\n\"Half a rouble!\" cried he. \"Why? Because you were good enough to bring\nhim yourself to the inn? I will obey you, excellency, but we have no\nhalf roubles to spare. If we take to giving gratuities to everybody we\nshall end by dying of hunger.\"\n\nI could not dispute the point with Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch; my money, according to my\nsolemn promise, was entirely at his disposal. Nevertheless, I was\nannoyed that I was not able to reward a man who, if he had not brought\nme out of fatal danger, had, at least, extricated me from an awkward\ndilemma.\n\n\"Well,\" I said, coolly, to Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch, \"if you do not wish to give him\nhalf a rouble give him one of my old coats; he is too thinly clad. Give\nhim my hareskin _touloup_.\"\n\n\"Have mercy on me, my father, Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch!\" exclaimed Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch.\n\"What need has he of your _touloup_? He will pawn it for drink, the\ndog, in the first tavern he comes across.\"\n\n\"That, my dear old fellow, is no longer your affair,\" said the vagabond,\n\"whether I drink it or whether I do not. His excellency honours me with\na coat off his own back.[26] It is his excellency's will, and it is your\nduty as a serf not to kick against it, but to obey.\"\n\n\"You don't fear heaven, robber that you are,\" said Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch, angrily.\n\"You see the child is still young and foolish, and you are quite ready\nto plunder him, thanks to his kind heart. What do you want with a\ngentleman's _touloup_? You could not even put it across your cursed\nbroad shoulders.\"\n\n\"I beg you will not play the wit,\" I said to my follower. \"Get the cloak\nquickly.\"\n\n\"Oh! good heavens!\" exclaimed Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch, bemoaning himself. \"A\n_touloup_ of hareskin, and still quite new! And to whom is it\ngiven?--to a drunkard in rags.\"\n\nHowever, the _touloup_ was brought. The vagabond began trying it on\ndirectly. The _touloup_, which had already become somewhat too small for\nme, was really too tight for him. Still, with some trouble, he succeeded\nin getting it on, though he cracked all the seams. Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch gave, as\nit were, a subdued howl when he heard the threads snapping.\n\nAs to the vagabond, he was very pleased with my present. He ushered me\nto my _kibitka_, and saying, with a low bow, \"Thanks, your excellency;\nmay Heaven reward you for your goodness; I shall never forget, as long\nas I live, your kindnesses,\" went his way, and I went mine, without\npaying any attention to Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch's sulkiness.\n\nI soon forgot the snowstorm, the guide, and my hareskin _touloup_.\n\nUpon arrival at Orenburg I immediately waited on the General. I found a\ntall man, already bent by age. His long hair was quite white; his old\nuniform reminded one of a soldier of Tzarina Anne's[27] time, and he\nspoke with a strongly-marked German accent. I gave him my father's\nletter. Upon reading his name he cast a quick glance at me.\n\n\"Ah,\" said he, \"it was but a short time Andr\u00c3\u00a9j Petr\u00c3\u00b3vitch was your age,\nand now he has got a fine fellow of a son. Well, well--time, time.\"\n\nHe opened the letter, and began reading it half aloud, with a running\nfire of remarks--\n\n\"'Sir, I hope your excellency'--What's all this ceremony? For shame! I\nwonder he's not ashamed of himself! Of course, discipline before\neverything; but is it thus one writes to an old comrade? 'Your\nexcellency will not have forgotten'--Humph! 'And when under the late\nField Marshal M\u00c3\u00bcnich during the campaign, as well as little\nCaroline'--Eh! eh! _bruder_! So he still remembers our old pranks? 'Now\nfor business. I send you my rogue'--Hum! 'Hold him with gloves of\nporcupine-skin'--What does that mean--'gloves of porcupine-skin?' It\nmust be a Russian proverb.\n\n\"What does it mean, 'hold with gloves of porcupine-skin?'\" resumed he,\nturning to me.\n\n\"It means,\" I answered him, with the most innocent face in the world,\n\"to treat someone kindly, not too strictly, to leave him plenty of\nliberty; that is what holding with gloves of porcupine-skin means.\"\n\n\"Humph! I understand.\"\n\n\"'And not give him any liberty'--No; it seems that porcupine-skin gloves\nmeans something quite different.' Enclosed is his commission'--Where is\nit then? Ah! here it is!--'in the roll of the S\u00c3\u00a9m\u00c3\u00a9nofsky Regiment'--All\nright; everything necessary shall be done. 'Allow me to salute you\nwithout ceremony, and like an old friend and comrade'--Ah! he has at\nlast remembered it all,\" etc., etc.\n\n\"Well, my little father,\" said he, after he had finished the letter and\nput my commission aside, \"all shall be done; you shall be an officer in\nthe ----th Regiment, and you shall go to-morrow to Fort B\u00c3\u00a9logorsk, where\nyou will serve under the orders of Commandant Mironoff, a brave and\nworthy man. There you will really serve and learn discipline. There is\nnothing for you to do at Orenburg; amusement is bad for a young man.\nTo-day I invite you to dine with me.\"\n\n\"Worse and worse,\" thought I to myself. \"What good has it done me to\nhave been a sergeant in the Guard from my cradle? Where has it brought\nme? To the ----th Regiment, and to a fort stranded on the frontier of\nthe Kirghiz-Ka\u00c3\u00afsak Steppes!\"\n\nI dined at Andr\u00c3\u00a9j Karlovitch's, in the company of his old aide de camp.\nStrict German economy was the rule at his table, and I think that the\ndread of a frequent guest at his bachelor's table contributed not a\nlittle to my being so promptly sent away to a distant garrison.\n\nThe next day I took leave of the General, and started for my\ndestination.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nTHE LITTLE FORT.\n\n\nThe little fort of B\u00c3\u00a9logorsk lay about forty versts[28] from Orenburg.\nFrom this town the road followed along by the rugged banks of the R.\nYa\u00c3\u00afk. The river was not yet frozen, and its lead-coloured waves looked\nalmost black contrasted with its banks white with snow. Before me\nstretched the Kirghiz Steppes. I was lost in thought, and my reverie was\ntinged with melancholy. Garrison life did not offer me much attraction.\nI tried to imagine what my future chief, Commandant Mironoff, would be\nlike. I saw in my mind's eye a strict, morose old man, with no ideas\nbeyond the service, and prepared to put me under arrest for the smallest\ntrifle.\n\nTwilight was coming on; we were driving rather quickly.\n\n\"Is it far from here to the fort?\" I asked the driver.\n\n\"Why, you can see it from here,\" replied he.\n\nI began looking all round, expecting to see high bastions, a wall, and a\nditch. I saw nothing but a little village, surrounded by a wooden\npalisade. On one side three or four haystacks, half covered with snow;\non another a tumble-down windmill, whose sails, made of coarse limetree\nbark, hung idly down.\n\n\"But where is the fort?\" I asked, in surprise.\n\n\"There it is yonder, to be sure,\" rejoined the driver, pointing out to\nme the village which we had just reached.\n\nI noticed near the gateway an old iron cannon. The streets were narrow\nand crooked, nearly all the _izb\u00c3\u00a1s_[29] were thatched. I ordered him to\ntake me to the Commandant, and almost directly my _kibitka_ stopped\nbefore a wooden house, built on a knoll near the church, which was also\nin wood.\n\nNo one came to meet me. From the steps I entered the ante-room. An old\npensioner, seated on a table, was busy sewing a blue patch on the elbow\nof a green uniform. I begged him to announce me.\n\n\"Come in, my little father,\" he said to me; \"we are all at home.\"\n\nI went into a room, very clean, but furnished in a very homely manner.\nIn one corner there stood a dresser with crockery on it. Against the\nwall hung, framed and glazed, an officer's commission. Around this were\narranged some bark pictures,[30] representing the \"Taking of Kustrin\"\nand of \"Otchak\u00c3\u00b3f,\"[31] \"The Choice of the Betrothed,\" and the \"Burial of\nthe Cat by the Mice.\" Near the window sat an old woman wrapped in a\nshawl, her head tied up in a handkerchief. She was busy winding thread,\nwhich a little, old, one-eyed man in an officer's uniform was holding on\nhis outstretched hands.\n\n\"What do you want, my little father?\" she said to me, continuing her\nemployment.\n\nI answered that I had been ordered to join the service here, and that,\ntherefore, I had hastened to report myself to the Commandant. With these\nwords I turned towards the little, old, one-eyed man, whom I had taken\nfor the Commandant. But the good lady interrupted the speech with which\nI had prepared myself.\n\n\"Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch[32] is not at home,\" said she. \"He is gone to see Father\nGarassim. But it's all the same, I am his wife. Be so good as to love us\nand take us into favour.[33] Sit down, my little father.\"\n\nShe called a servant, and bid her tell the \"_ouriadnik_\"[34] to come.\nThe little, old man was looking curiously at me with his one eye.\n\n\"Might I presume to ask you,\" said he to me, \"in what regiment you have\ndeigned to serve?\"\n\nI satisfied his curiosity.\n\n\"And might I ask you,\" continued he, \"why you have condescended to\nexchange from the Guard into our garrison?\"\n\nI replied that it was by order of the authorities.\n\n\"Probably for conduct unbecoming an officer of the Guard?\" rejoined my\nindefatigable questioner.\n\n\"Will you be good enough to stop talking nonsense?\" the wife of the\nCommandant now said to him. \"You can see very well that this young man\nis tired with his journey. He has something else to do than to answer\nyour questions. Hold your hands better. And you, my little father,\" she\ncontinued, turning to me, \"do not bemoan yourself too much because you\nhave been shoved into our little hole of a place; you are not the first,\nand you will not be the last. One may suffer, but one gets accustomed to\nit. For instance, Chvabrine, Alexey Iv\u00c3\u00a1nytch,[35] was transferred to us\nfour years ago on account of a murder. Heaven knows what ill-luck befel\nhim. It happened one day he went out of the town with a lieutenant, and\nthey had taken swords, and they set to pinking one another, and Alexey\nIv\u00c3\u00a1nytch killed the lieutenant, and before a couple of witnesses. Well,\nwell, there's no heading ill-luck!\"\n\nAt this moment the \"_ouriadnik_,\" a young and handsome Cossack, came in.\n\n\"Maximitch,\" the Commandant's wife said to him, \"find a quarter for this\nofficer, and a clean one.\"\n\n\"I obey, Vassilissa Igorofna,\"[36] replied the \"_ouriadnik_.\" \"Ought not\nhis excellency to go to Iw\u00c3\u00a1n Pol\u00c3\u00a9ja\u00c3\u00afeff?\"\n\n\"You are doting, Maximitch,\" retorted the Commandant's wife; \"Pol\u00c3\u00a9ja\u00c3\u00afeff\nhas already little enough room; and, besides, he is my gossip; and then\nhe does not forget that we are his superiors. Take the gentleman--What\nis your name, my little father?\"\n\n\"Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch.\"\n\n\"Take Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch to S\u00c3\u00a9m\u00c3\u00a9on Kouzoff's. The rascal let his horse get\ninto my kitchen garden. Is everything in order, Maximitch?\"\n\n\"Thank heaven! all is quiet,\" replied the Cossack. \"Only Corporal\nProkoroff has been fighting in the bathhouse with the woman Oustinia\nPegoulina for a pail of hot water.\"\n\n\"Iw\u00c3\u00a1n Ignatiitch,\"[37] said the Commandant's wife to the little one-eyed\nman, \"you must decide between Prokoroff and Oustinia which is to blame,\nand punish both of them; and you, Maximitch, go, in heaven's name! Petr'\nAndr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch, Maximitch will take you to your lodging.\"\n\nI took leave. The \"_ouriadnik\"_ led me to an _izb\u00c3\u00a1_, which stood on the\nsteep bank of the river, quite at the far end of the little fort. Half\nthe _izb\u00c3\u00a1_ was occupied by the family of S\u00c3\u00a9m\u00c3\u00a9on Kouzoff, the other half\nwas given over to me. This half consisted of a tolerably clean room,\ndivided into two by a partition.\n\nSav\u00c3\u00a9liitch began to unpack, and I looked out of the narrow window. I saw\nstretching out before me a bare and dull steppe; on one side there stood\nsome huts. Some fowls were wandering down the street. An old woman,\nstanding on a doorstep, holding in her hand a trough, was calling to\nsome pigs, the pigs replying by amicable grunts.\n\nAnd it was in such a country as this I was condemned to pass my youth!\n\nOvercome by bitter grief, I left the window, and went to bed supperless,\nin spite of Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch's remonstrances, who continued to repeat, in a\nmiserable tone--\n\n\"Oh, good heavens! he does not deign to eat anything. What would my\nmistress say if the child should fall ill?\"\n\nOn the morrow, I had scarcely begun to dress before the door of my room\nopened, and a young officer came in. He was undersized, but, in spite of\nirregular features, his bronzed face had a remarkably gay and lively\nexpression.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said he to me in French,[38] \"for coming thus\nunceremoniously to make your acquaintance. I heard of your arrival\nyesterday, and the wish to see at last a human being took such\npossession of me that I could not resist any longer. You will understand\nthat when you have been here some time!\"\n\nI easily guessed that this was the officer sent away from the Guard in\nconsequence of the duel.\n\nWe made acquaintance. Chvabrine was very witty. His conversation was\nlively and interesting. He described to me, with, much raciness and\ngaiety, the Commandant's family, the society of the fort, and, in short,\nall the country where my fate had led me.\n\nI was laughing heartily when the same pensioner whom I had seen patching\nhis uniform in the Commandant's ante-room, came in with an invitation to\ndinner for me from Vassilissa Igorofna.\n\nChvabrine said he should accompany me.\n\nAs we drew near the Commandant's house we saw in the square about twenty\nlittle old pensioners, with long pigtails and three-cornered hats. They\nwere drawn up in line. Before them stood the Commandant, a tall, old\nman, still hale, in a dressing-gown and a cotton nightcap.\n\nAs soon as he perceived us he came up, said a few pleasant words to me,\nand went back to the drill. We were going to stop and see the\nmanoeuvres, but he begged us to go at once to Vassilissa Igorofna's,\npromising to follow us directly. \"Here,\" said he, \"there's really\nnothing to see.\"\n\nVassilissa Igorofna received us with simplicity and kindness, and\ntreated me as if she had known me a long time. The pensioner and\nPalashka were laying the cloth.\n\n\"What possesses my Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch to-day to drill his troops so long?\"\nremarked the Commandant's wife. \"Palashka, go and fetch him for dinner.\nAnd what can have become of Masha?\"[39]\n\nHardly had she said the name than a young girl of sixteen came into the\nroom. She had a fresh, round face, and her hair was smoothly put back\nbehind her ears, which were red with shyness and modesty. She did not\nplease me very much at first sight; I looked at her with prejudice.\nChvabrine had described Marya, the Commandant's daughter, to me as being\nrather silly. She went and sat down in a corner, and began to sew. Still\nthe \"_chtchi_\"[40] had been brought in. Vassilissa Igorofna, not seeing\nher husband come back, sent Palashka for the second time to call him.\n\n\"Tell the master that the visitors are waiting, and the soup is getting\ncold. Thank heaven, the drill will not run away. He will have plenty of\ntime to shout as much as he likes.\"\n\nThe Commandant soon appeared, accompanied by the little old one-eyed\nman.\n\n\"What does all this mean, my little father?\" said his wife to him.\n\"Dinner has been ready a long time, and we cannot make you come.\"\n\n\"But don't you see, Vassilissa Igorofna,\" replied Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch, \"I\nwas very busy drilling my little soldiers.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" replied she, \"that's only a boast; they are past service,\nand you don't know much about it. You should have stayed at home, and\nsaid your prayers; that would have been much better for you. My dear\nguests, pray sit down to table.\"\n\nWe took our places. Vassilissa Igorofna never ceased talking for a\nmoment, and overwhelmed me with questions. Who were my parents, were\nthey alive, where did they live, and what was their income? When she\nlearnt that my father had three hundred serfs--\n\n\"Well!\" she exclaimed, \"there are rich people in this world! And as to\nus, my little father, we have as to souls[41] only the servant girl,\nPalashka. Well, thank heaven, we get along little by little. We have\nonly one care on our minds--Masha, a girl who must be married. And what\ndowry has she got? A comb and two-pence to pay for a bath twice a year.\nIf only she could light on some honest man! If not she must remain an\nold maid!\"\n\nI glanced at Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna.[42] She had become quite red, and tears\nwere rolling down, even into her plate. I was sorry for her, and I\nhastened to change the conversation.\n\n\"I have heard,\" I exclaimed (very much to the point), \"that the Bashkirs\nintend to attack your fort.\"\n\n\"Who told you that, my little father?\" replied Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch.\n\n\"I heard it said at Orenburg,\" replied I.\n\n\"That's all rubbish,\" said the Commandant. \"We have not heard a word of\nit for ever so long. The Bashkir people have been thoroughly awed, and\nthe Kirghiz, too, have had some good lessons. They won't dare to attack\nus, and if they venture to do so I'll give them such a fright that they\nwon't stir for ten years at least.\"\n\n\"And you are not afraid,\" I continued, addressing the Commandant's wife,\n\"to stay in a fort liable to such dangers?\"\n\n\"It's all a question of custom, my little father,\" answered she. \"It's\ntwenty years ago now since we were transferred from the regiment here.\nYou would never believe how frightened I used to be of those confounded\nPagans. If ever I chanced to see their hairy caps, or hear their howls,\nbelieve me, my little father, I nearly died of it. And now I am so\naccustomed to it that I should not budge an inch if I was told that the\nrascals were prowling all around the fort.\"\n\n\"Vassilissa Igorofna is a very brave lady,\" remarked Chvabrine, gravely.\n\"Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch knows something of that.\"\n\n\"Oh! yes, indeed,\" said Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch, \"she's no coward.\"\n\n\"And Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna,\" I asked her mother, \"is she as bold as you?\"\n\n\"Masha!\" replied the lady; \"no, Masha is a coward. Till now she has\nnever been able to hear a gun fired without trembling all over. It is\ntwo years ago now since Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch took it into his head to fire his\ncannon on my birthday; she was so frightened, the poor little dove, she\nnearly ran away into the other world. Since that day we have never fired\nthat confounded cannon any more.\"\n\nWe got up from table; the Commandant and his wife went to take their\nsiesta, and I went to Chvabrine's quarters, where we passed the evening\ntogether.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nTHE DUEL.\n\n\nSeveral weeks passed, during which my life in Fort B\u00c3\u00a9logorsk became not\nmerely endurable, but even pleasant. I was received like one of the\nfamily in the household of the Commandant. The husband and wife were\nexcellent people. Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch, who had been a child of the regiment,\nhad become an officer, and was a simple, uneducated man, but good and\ntrue. His wife led him completely, which, by the way, very well suited\nhis natural laziness.\n\nIt was Vassilissa Igorofna who directed all military business as she\ndid that of her household, and commanded in the little fort as she did\nin her house. Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna soon ceased being shy, and we became better\nacquainted. I found her a warm-hearted and sensible girl. By degrees I\nbecame attached to this honest family, even to Iw\u00c3\u00a1n Ignatiitch, the\none-eyed lieutenant, whom Chvabrine accused of secret intrigue with\nVassilissa Igorofna, an accusation which had not even a shadow of\nprobability. But that did not matter to Chvabrine.\n\nI became an officer. My work did not weigh heavily upon me. In this\nheaven-blest fort there was no drill to do, no guard to mount, nor\nreview to pass. Sometimes the Commandant instructed his soldiers for his\nown pleasure. But he had not yet succeeded in teaching them to know\ntheir right hand from their left. Chvabrine had some French books; I\ntook to reading, and I acquired a taste for literature. In the morning I\nused to read, and I tried my hand at translations, sometimes even at\ncompositions in verse. Nearly every day I dined at the Commandant's,\nwhere I usually passed the rest of the day. In the evening, Father\nGarasim used to drop in, accompanied by his wife, Akoulina, who was the\nsturdiest gossip of the neighbourhood. It is scarcely necessary to say\nthat every day we met, Chvabrine and I. Still hour by hour his\nconversation pleased me less. His everlasting jokes about the\nCommandant's family, and, above all, his witty remarks upon Marya\nIv\u00c3\u00a1nofna, displeased me very much. I had no other society but that of\nthis family within the little fort, but I did not want any other.\n\nIn spite of all the prophecies, the Bashkirs did not revolt. Peace\nreigned around our little fort. But this peace was suddenly troubled by\nwar within.\n\nI have already said I dabbled a little in literature. My attempts were\ntolerable for the time, and Soumarokoff[43] himself did justice to them\nmany years later. One day I happened to write a little song which\npleased me. It is well-known that under colour of asking advice, authors\nwillingly seek a benevolent listener; I copied out my little song, and\ntook it to Chvabrine, the only person in the fort who could appreciate a\npoetical work.\n\nAfter a short preface, I drew my manuscript from my pocket, and read to\nhim the following verses:[44]\n\n  \"By waging war with thoughts of love\n  I try to forget my beauty;\n  Alas! by flight from Masha,\n  I hope my freedom to regain!\n\n  \"But the eyes which enslaved me are ever before me.\n  My soul have they troubled and ruined my rest.\n\n    \"Oh! Masha, who knowest my sorrows,\n    Seeing me in this miserable plight,\n    Take pity on thy captive.\"\n\n\"What do you think of that?\" I said to Chvabrine, expecting praise as a\ntribute due to me. But to my great displeasure Chvabrine, who usually\nshowed kindness, told me flatly my song was worth nothing.\n\n\"Why?\" I asked, trying to hide my vexation.\n\n\"Because such verses,\" replied he, \"are only worthy of my master\nTr\u00c3\u00a9diakofski,[45] and, indeed, remind me very much of his little erotic\ncouplets.\"\n\nHe took the MSS. from my hand and began unmercifully criticizing each\nverse, each word, cutting me up in the most spiteful way. That was too\nmuch for me; I snatched the MSS. out of his hands, and declared that\nnever, no never, would I ever again show him one of my compositions.\nChvabrine did not laugh the less at this threat.\n\n\n\n\"Let us see,\" said he, \"if you will be able to keep your word; poets\nhave as much need of an audience as Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch has need of his\n'_petit verre_' before dinner. And who is this Masha to whom you declare\nyour tender sentiments and your ardent flame? Surely it must be Marya\nIv\u00c3\u00a1nofna?\"\n\n\"That does not concern you,\" replied I, frowning; \"I don't ask for your\nadvice nor your suppositions.\"\n\n\"Oh! oh! a vain poet and a discreet lover,\" continued Chvabrine,\nirritating me more and more. \"Listen to a little friendly advice: if you\nwish to succeed, I advise you not to stick at songs.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, sir?\" I exclaimed; \"explain yourself if you please.\"\n\n\"With pleasure,\" rejoined he. \"I mean that if you want to be well with\nMasha Mironoff, you need only make her a present of a pair of earrings\ninstead of your languishing verses.\"\n\nMy blood boiled.\n\n\"Why have you such an opinion of her?\" I asked him, restraining with\ndifficulty my indignation.\n\n\"Because,\" replied he, with a satanic smile, \"because I know by\nexperience her views and habits.\"\n\n\"You lie, you rascal!\" I shouted at him, in fury. \"You are a shameless\nliar.\"\n\nChvabrine's face changed.\n\n\"This I cannot overlook,\" he said; \"you shall give me satisfaction.\"\n\n\"Certainly, whenever you like,\" replied I, joyfully; for at that moment\nI was ready to tear him in pieces.\n\nI rushed at once to Iw\u00c3\u00a1n Ignatiitch, whom I found with a needle in his\nhand. In obedience to the order of the Commandant's wife, he was\nthreading mushrooms to be dried for the winter.\n\n\"Ah! Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch,\" said he, when he saw me; \"you are welcome. On\nwhat errand does heaven send you, if I may presume to ask?\"\n\nI told him in a few words that I had quarrelled with Alexey Iv\u00c3\u00a1nytch,\nand that I begged him, Iw\u00c3\u00a1n Ignatiitch, to be my second. Iw\u00c3\u00a1n Ignatiitch\nheard me till I had done with great attention, opening wide his single\neye.\n\n\"You deign to tell me,\" said he, \"that you wish to kill Alexey Iv\u00c3\u00a1nytch,\nand that I am to be witness? Is not that what you mean, if I may presume\nto ask you?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"But, good heavens, Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch, what folly have you got in your\nhead? You and Alexey Iv\u00c3\u00a1nytch have insulted one another; well, a fine\naffair! You needn't wear an insult hung round your neck. He has said\nsilly things to you, give him some impertinence; he in return will give\nyou a blow, give him in return a box on the ear; he another, you\nanother, and then you part. And presently we oblige you to make peace.\nWhereas now--is it a good thing to kill your neighbour, if I may presume\nto ask you? Even if it were _you_ who should kill _him_! May heaven be\nwith him, for I do not love him. But if it be he who is to run you\nthrough, you will have made a nice business of it. Who will pay for the\nbroken pots, allow me to ask?\"\n\nThe arguments of the prudent officer did not deter me. My resolution\nremained firm.\n\n\"As you like,\" said Iw\u00c3\u00a1n Ignatiitch, \"do as you please; but what good\nshould I do as witness? People fight; what is there extraordinary in\nthat, allow me to ask? Thank heaven I have seen the Swedes and the\nTurks at close quarters, and I have seen a little of everything.\"\n\nI endeavoured to explain to him as best I could the duty of a second,\nbut I found Iw\u00c3\u00a1n Ignatiitch quite unmanageable.\n\n\"Do as you like,\" said he; \"if I meddled in the matter, it would be to\ngo and tell Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch, according to the rules of the service, that\na criminal deed is being plotted in the fort, in opposition to the\ninterests of the crown, and remark to the Commandant how advisable it\nwould be that he should think of taking the necessary measures.\"\n\nI was frightened, and I begged Iw\u00c3\u00a1n Ignatiitch not to say anything to\nthe Commandant. With great difficulty I managed to quiet him, and at\nlast made him promise to hold his tongue, when I left him in peace.\n\nAs usual I passed the evening at the Commandant's. I tried to appear\nlively and unconcerned in order not to awaken any suspicions, and avoid\nany too curious questions. But I confess I had none of the coolness of\nwhich people boast who have found themselves in the same position. All\nthat evening I felt inclined to be soft-hearted and sentimental.\n\nMarya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna pleased me more than usual. The thought that perhaps I\nwas seeing her for the last time gave her, in my eyes, a touching grace.\n\nChvabrine came in. I took him aside and told him about my interview with\nIw\u00c3\u00a1n Ignatiitch.\n\n\"Why any seconds?\" he said to me, dryly. \"We shall do very well without\nthem.\"\n\nWe decided to fight on the morrow behind the haystacks, at six o'clock\nin the morning.\n\nSeeing us talking in such a friendly manner, Iw\u00c3\u00a1n Ignatiitch, full of\njoy, nearly betrayed us.\n\n\"You should have done that long ago,\" he said to me, with a face of\nsatisfaction. \"Better a hollow peace than an open quarrel.\"\n\n\"What is that you say, Iw\u00c3\u00a1n Ignatiitch?\" said the Commandant's wife, who\nwas playing patience in a corner. \"I did not exactly catch what you\nsaid.\"\n\nIw\u00c3\u00a1n Ignatiitch, who saw my face darken, recollected his promise, became\nconfused, and did not know what to say. Chvabrine came to the rescue.\n\n\"Iw\u00c3\u00a1n Ignatiitch,\" said he, \"approves of the compact we have made.\"\n\n\"And with whom, my little father, did you quarrel?\"\n\n\"Why, with Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch, to be sure, and we even got to high words.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"About a mere trifle, over a little song.\"\n\n\"Fine thing to quarrel over--a little song! How did it happen?\"\n\n\"Thus. Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch lately composed a song, and he began singing it\nto me this morning. So I--I struck up mine, 'Captain's daughter, don't\ngo abroad at dead of night!' As we did not sing in the same key, Petr'\nAndr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch became angry. But afterwards he reflected that 'every one is\nfree to sing what he pleases,' and that's all.\"\n\nChvabrine's insolence made me furious, but no one else, except myself,\nunderstood his coarse allusions. Nobody, at least, took up the subject.\nFrom poetry the conversation passed to poets in general, and the\nCommandant made the remark that they were all rakes and confirmed\ndrunkards; he advised me as a friend to give up poetry as a thing\nopposed to the service, and leading to no good.\n\nChvabrine's presence was to me unbearable. I hastened to take leave of\nthe Commandant and his family. After coming home I looked at my sword; I\ntried its point, and I went to bed after ordering Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch to wake me\non the morrow at six o'clock.\n\nOn the following day, at the appointed hour, I was already behind the\nhaystacks, waiting for my foeman. It was not long before he appeared.\n\n\"We may be surprised,\" he said to me; \"we must make haste.\"\n\nWe laid aside our uniforms, and in our waistcoats we drew our swords\nfrom the scabbard.\n\nAt this moment Iw\u00c3\u00a1n Ignatiitch, followed by five pensioners, came out\nfrom behind a heap of hay. He gave us an order to go at once before the\nCommandant. We sulkily obeyed. The soldiers surrounded us, and we\nfollowed Iw\u00c3\u00a1n Ignatiitch who brought us along in triumph, walking with\na military step, with majestic gravity.\n\nWe entered the Commandant's house. Iw\u00c3\u00a1n Ignatiitch threw the door wide\nopen, and exclaimed, emphatically--\n\n\"They are taken!\"\n\nVassilissa Igorofna ran to meet us.\n\n\"What does all this mean? Plotting assassination in our very fort! Iv\u00c3\u00a1n\nKouzmitch, put them under arrest at once. Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch, Alexey\nIv\u00c3\u00a1nytch, give up your swords, give them up--give them up. Palashka,\ntake away the swords to the garret. Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch, I did not expect\nthis of you; aren't you ashamed of yourself? As to Alexey Iv\u00c3\u00a1nytch, it's\ndifferent; he was transferred from the Guard for sending a soul into the\nother world. He does not believe in our Lord! But do you wish to do\nlikewise?\"\n\nIv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch approved of all his wife said, repeating--\n\n\"Look there, now, Vassilissa Igorofna is quite right--duels are\nformally forbidden by martial law.\"\n\nPalashka had taken away our swords, and had carried them to the garret.\nI could not help laughing. Chvabrine looked grave.\n\n\"In spite of all the respect I have for you,\" he said, coolly, to the\nCommandant's wife, \"I cannot help remarking that you are giving yourself\nuseless trouble by trying us at your tribunal. Leave this cure do Iv\u00c3\u00a1n\nKouzmitch--it is his business.\"\n\n\"What! what! my little father!\" retorted the Commandant's wife, \"are not\nhusband and wife the same flesh and spirit? Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch, are you\ntrifling? Lock them up separately, and keep them on broad and water till\nthis ridiculous idea goes out of their heads. And Father Garasim shall\nmake them do penance that they may ask pardon of heaven and of men.\"\n\nIv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch did not know what to do. Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna was very pale.\nLittle by little the storm sank. The Commandant's wife became more easy\nto deal with. She ordered us to make friends. Palashka brought us back\nour swords. We left the house apparently reconciled. Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Ignatiitch\naccompanied us.\n\n\"Weren't you ashamed,\" I said to him, angrily, \"thus to denounce us to\nthe Commandant after giving me your solemn word not to do so?\"\n\n\"As God is holy,\" replied he, \"I said nothing to Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch; it was\nVassilissa Igorofna who wormed it all out of me. It was she who took all\nthe necessary measures unknown to the Commandant. As it is, heaven be\npraised that it has all ended in this way.\"\n\nAfter this reply he returned to his quarters, and I remained alone with\nChvabrine.\n\n\"Our affair can't end thus,\" I said to him.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" rejoined Chvabrine. \"You shall wash out your insolence\nin blood. But they will watch us; we must pretend to be friends for a\nfew days. Good-bye.\"\n\nAnd we parted as if nothing had happened.\n\nUpon my return to the Commandant's, I sat down according to my custom by\nMarya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna; her father was not at home, and her mother was engaged\nwith household cares. We spoke in a low voice Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna reproached\nme tenderly for the anxiety my quarrel with Chvabrine had occasioned\nher.\n\n\"My heart failed me,\" said she, \"when they came to tell us that you were\ngoing to draw swords on each other. How strange men are! For a word\nforgotten the next week they are ready to cut each other's throats, and\nto sacrifice not only their life, but their honour, and the happiness of\nthose who--But I am sure it was not you who began the quarrel; it was\nAlexey Iv\u00c3\u00a1nytch who was the aggressor.\"\n\n\"What makes you think so, Marya?\"\n\n\"Why, because--because he is so sneering. I do not like Alexey Iv\u00c3\u00a1nytch;\nI even dislike him. Yet, all the same, I should not have liked him to\ndislike me; it would have made me very uneasy.\"\n\n\"And what do you think, Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna, does he dislike you or no?\"\n\nMarya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna looked disturbed, and grew very red.\n\n\"I think,\" she said, at last, \"I think he likes me.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because he proposed to me.\"\n\n\"Proposed to you! When?\"\n\n\"Last year, two months before you came.\"\n\n\"And you did not consent?\"\n\n\"As you see, Alexey Iv\u00c3\u00a1nytch is a man of wit, and of good family, to be\nsure, well off, too; but only to think of being obliged to kiss him\nbefore everybody under the marriage crown! No, no; nothing in the world\nwould induce me.\"\n\nThe words of Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna enlightened me, and made many things clear\nto me. I understood now why Chvabrine so persistently followed her up.\nHe had probably observed our mutual attraction, and was trying to detach\nus one from another.\n\nThe words which had provoked our quarrel seemed to me the more infamous\nwhen, instead of a rude and coarse joke, I saw in them a premeditated\ncalumny.\n\nThe wish to punish the barefaced liar took more entire possession of me,\nand I awaited impatiently a favourable moment. I had not to wait long.\nOn the morrow, just as I was busy composing an elegy, and I was biting\nmy pen as I searched for a rhyme, Chvabrine tapped at my window. I laid\ndown the pen, and I took up my sword and left the house.\n\n\"Why delay any longer?\" said Chvabrine. \"They are not watching us any\nmore. Let us go to the river-bank; there nobody will interrupt us.\"\n\nWe started in silence, and after having gone down a rugged path we\nhalted at the water's edge and crossed swords.\n\nChvabrine was a better swordsman than I was, but I was stronger and\nbolder, and M. Beaupr\u00c3\u00a9, who had, among other things, been a soldier, had\ngiven me some lessons in fencing, by which I had profited.\n\nChvabrine did not in the least expect to find in me such a dangerous\nfoeman. For a long while we could neither of us do the other any harm,\nbut at last, noticing that Chvabrine was getting tired, I vigorously\nattacked him, and almost forced him backwards into the river.\n\nSuddenly I heard my own name called in a loud voice. I quickly turned my\nhead, and saw Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch running towards me down the path. At this\nmoment I felt a sharp prick in the chest, under the right shoulder, and\nI fell senseless.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nLOVE.\n\n\nWhen I came to myself I remained some time without understanding what\nhad befallen me, nor where I chanced to be. I was in bed in an\nunfamiliar room, and I felt very weak indeed. Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch was standing by\nme, a light in his hand. Someone was unrolling with care the bandages\nround my shoulder and chest. Little by little my ideas grew clearer. I\nrecollected my duel and guessed without any difficulty that I had been\nwounded. At this moment the door creaked slightly on its hinges.\n\n\"Well, how is he getting on?\" whispered a voice which thrilled through\nme.\n\n\"Always the same still,\" replied Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch, sighing; \"always\nunconscious, as he has now been these four days.\"\n\nI wished to turn, but I had not strength to do so.\n\n\"Where am I? Who is there?\" I said, with difficulty. Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna came\nnear to my bed and leaned gently over me.\n\n\"How do you feel?\" she said to me.\n\n\"All right, thank God!\" I replied in a weak voice. \"It is you, Marya\nIv\u00c3\u00a1nofna; tell me--\"\n\nI could not finish. Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch exclaimed, joy painted on his face--\n\n\"He is coming to himself!--he is coming to himself! Oh! thanks be to\nheaven! My father Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch, have you frightened me enough? Four\ndays! That seems little enough to say, but--\"\n\nMarya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna interrupted him.\n\n\"Do not talk to him too much, Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch; he is still very weak.\"\n\nShe went away, shutting the door carefully.\n\nI felt myself disturbed with confused thoughts. I was evidently in the\nhouse of the Commandant, as Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna could thus come and see me! I\nwished to question Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch; but the old man shook his head and turned\na deaf ear. I shut my eyes in displeasure, and soon fell asleep. Upon\nwaking I called Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch, but in his stead I saw before me Marya\nIv\u00c3\u00a1nofna, who greeted me in her soft voice. I cannot describe the\ndelicious feeling which thrilled through me at this moment, I seized her\nhand and pressed it in a transport of delight, while bedewing it with my\ntears. Marya did not withdraw it, and all of a sudden I felt upon my\ncheek the moist and burning imprint of her lips. A wild flame of love\nthrilled through my whole being.\n\n\"Dear, good Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna,\" I said to her, \"be my wife. Consent to give\nme happiness.\"\n\nShe became reasonable again.\n\n\"For heaven's sake, calm yourself,\" she said, withdrawing her hand. \"You\nare still in danger; your wound may reopen; be careful of yourself--were\nit only for my sake.\"\n\nAfter these words she went away, leaving me at the height of happiness.\nI felt that life was given back to me.\n\n\"She will be mine! She loves me!\"\n\nThis thought filled all my being.\n\nFrom this moment I hourly got better. It was the barber of the regiment\nwho dressed my wound, for there was no other doctor in all the fort,\nand, thank God, he did not attempt any doctoring. Youth and nature\nhastened my recovery. All the Commandant's family took the greatest\ncare of me. Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna scarcely ever left me. It is unnecessary to\nsay that I seized the first favourable opportunity to resume my\ninterrupted proposal, and this time Marya heard me more patiently. She\nna\u00c3\u00afvely avowed to me her love, and added that her parents would, in all\nprobability, rejoice in her happiness.\n\n\"But think well about it,\" she used to say to me. \"Will there be no\nobjections on the part of your family?\"\n\nThese words made me reflect. I had no doubt of my mother's tenderness;\nbut knowing the character and way of thinking of my father, I foresaw\nthat my love would not touch him very much, and that he would call it\nyouthful folly. I frankly confessed this to Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna, but in spite\nof this I resolved to write to my father as eloquently as possible to\nask his blessing. I showed my letter to Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna, who found it so\nconvincing and touching that she had no doubt of success, and gave\nherself up to the feelings of her heart with all the confidence of youth\nand love.\n\nI made peace with Chvabrine during the early days of my convalescence.\nIv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch said to me, reproaching me for the duel--\n\n\"You know, Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch, properly speaking, I ought to put you under\narrest; but you are already sufficiently punished without that. As to\nAlexey Iv\u00c3\u00a1nytch, he is confined by my order, and under strict guard, in\nthe corn magazine, and Vassilissa Igorofna has his sword under lock and\nkey. He will have time to reflect and repent at his ease.\"\n\nI was too happy to cherish the least rancour. I began to intercede for\nChvabrine, and the good Commandant, with his wife's leave, agreed to set\nhim at liberty. Chvabrine came to see me. He expressed deep regret for\nall that had occurred, declared it was all his fault, and begged me to\nforget the past. Not being of a rancorous disposition, I heartily\nforgave him both our quarrel and my wound. I saw in his slander the\nirritation of wounded vanity and rejected love, so I generously forgave\nmy unhappy rival.\n\nI was soon completely recovered, and was able to go back to my quarters.\nI impatiently awaited the answer to my letter, not daring to hope, but\ntrying to stifle sad forebodings that would arise. I had not yet\nattempted any explanation as regarded Vassilissa Igorofna and her\nhusband. But my courtship could be no surprise to them, as neither Marya\nnor myself made any secret of our feelings before them, and we were sure\nbeforehand of their consent.\n\nAt last, one fine day, Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch came into my room with a letter in his\nhand.\n\nI took it trembling. The address was written in my father's hand.\n\nThis prepared me for something serious, since it was usually my mother\nwho wrote, and he only added a few lines at the end. For a long time I\ncould not make up my mind to break the seal. I read over the solemn\naddress:--\n\n\"To my son, Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch Grineff, District of Orenburg, Fort\nB\u00c3\u00a9logorsk.\"\n\nI tried to guess from my father's handwriting in what mood he had\nwritten the letter. At last I resolved to open it, and I did not need to\nread more than the first few lines to see that the whole affair was at\nthe devil. Here are the contents of this letter:--\n\n\"My Son Petr',--\n\n\"We received the 15th of this month the letter in which you ask our\nparental blessing and our consent to your marriage with Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna,\nthe Mironoff daughter.[46] And not only have I no intention of giving\nyou either my blessing or my consent, but I intend to come and punish\nyou well for your follies, like a little boy, in spite of your officer's\nrank, because you have shown me that you are not fit to wear the sword\nentrusted to you for the defence of your country, and not for fighting\nduels with fools like yourself. I shall write immediately to Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\nKarlovitch to beg him to send you away from Fort B\u00c3\u00a9logorsk to some place\nstill further removed, so that you may get over this folly.\n\n\"Upon hearing of your duel and wound your mother fell ill with sorrow,\nand she is still confined to her bed.\n\n\"What will become of you? I pray God may correct you, though I scarcely\ndare trust in His goodness.\n\n\"Your father,\n\n\"A.G.\"\n\nThe perusal of this letter aroused in me a medley of feelings. The\nharsh expressions which my father had not scrupled to make use of hurt\nme deeply; the contempt which he cast on Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna appeared to me\nas unjust as it was unseemly; while, finally, the idea of being sent\naway from Fort B\u00c3\u00a9logorsk dismayed me. But I was, above all, grieved at\nmy mother's illness.\n\nI was disgusted with Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch, never doubting that it was he who had\nmade known my duel to my parents. After walking up and down awhile in my\nlittle room, I suddenly stopped short before him, and said to him,\nangrily--\n\n\"It seems that it did not satisfy you that, thanks to you, I've been\nwounded and at death's door, but that you must also want to kill my\nmother as well.\"\n\nSav\u00c3\u00a9liitch remained motionless, as it struck by a thunderbolt.\n\n\"Have pity on me, sir,\" he exclaimed, almost sobbing. \"What is it you\ndeign to tell me--that I am the cause of your wound? But God knows I was\nonly running to stand between you and Alexey Iv\u00c3\u00a1nytch's sword. Accursed\nold age alone prevented me. What have I now done to your mother?\"\n\n\"What did you do?\" I retorted. \"Who told you to write and denounce me?\nWere you put in my service to be a spy upon me?\"\n\n\"I denounce you!\" replied Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch, in tears. \"Oh, good heavens! Here,\nbe so good as to read what master has written to me, and see if it was I\nwho denounced you.\"\n\nWith this he drew from his pocket a letter, which he offered to me, and\nI read as follows:--\n\n\"Shame on you, you old dog, for never writing and telling me anything\nabout my son, Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch, in spite of my strict orders, and that\nit should be from strangers that I learn his follies! Is it thus you do\nyour duty and act up to your master's wishes? I shall send you to keep\nthe pigs, old rascal, for having hid from me the truth, and for your\nweak compliance with the lad's whims. On receipt of this letter, I order\nyou to let me know directly the state of his health, which, judging by\nwhat I hear, is improving, and to tell me exactly the place where he was\nhit, and if the wound be well healed.\"\n\nEvidently Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch had not been the least to blame, and it was I who\nhad insulted him by my suspicions and reproaches. I begged his pardon,\nbut the old man was inconsolable.\n\n\"That I should have lived to see it!\" repeated he. \"These be the thanks\nthat I have deserved of my masters for all my long service. I am an old\ndog. I'm only fit, to keep pigs, and in addition to all this I am the\ncause of your wound. No, my father, Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch, 'tis not I who am\nto blame, it is rather the confounded '_mossoo_;' it was he who taught\nyou to fight with those iron spits, stamping your foot, as though by\nramming and stamping you could defend yourself from a bad man. It was,\nindeed, worth while spending money upon a '_mossoo_' to teach you that.\"\n\nBut who could have taken the trouble to tell my father what I had done.\nThe General? He did not seem to trouble himself much about me; and,\nindeed, Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch had not thought it necessary to report my duel to\nhim. I could not think. My suspicions fell upon Chvabrine; he alone\ncould profit by this betrayal, which might end in my banishment from the\nfort and my separation from the Commandant's family. I was going to tell\nall to Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna when she met me on the doorstep.\n\n\"What has happened?\" she said to me. \"How pale you are!\"\n\n\"All is at an end,\" replied I, handing her my father's letter.\n\nIn her turn she grew pale. After reading the letter she gave it me back,\nand said, in a voice broken by emotion--\n\n\"It was not my fate. Your parents do not want me in your family; God's\nwill be done! God knows better than we do what is fit for us. There is\nnothing to be done, Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch; may you at least be happy.\"\n\n\"It shall not be thus!\" I exclaimed, seizing her hand. \"You love me; I\nam ready for anything. Let us go and throw ourselves at your parents'\nfeet. They are honest people, neither proud nor hard; they--they will\ngive us their blessing--we will marry, and then with time, I am sure, we\nshall succeed in mollifying my father. My mother will intercede for us,\nand he will forgive me.\"\n\n\"No, Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch,\" replied Marya, \"I will not marry you without\nthe blessing of your parents. Without their blessing you would not be\nhappy. Let us submit to the will of God. Should you meet with another\nbetrothed, should you love her, _God be with you_,[47] Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch,\nI--I will pray for you both.\"\n\nShe began to cry, and went away. I meant to follow her to her room; but\nI felt unable to control myself, and I went home. I was seated, deep in\nmelancholy reflections, when Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch suddenly came and interrupted\nme.\n\n\"Here, sir,\" said he, handing me a sheet of paper all covered with\nwriting, \"see if I be a spy on my master, and if I try to sow discord\nbetwixt father and son.\"\n\nI took the paper from his hand; it was Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch's reply to the letter\nhe had received. Here it is word for word--\n\n\"My lord, Andr\u00c3\u00a9j Petr\u00c3\u00b3vitch, our gracious father, I have received your\ngracious letter, in which you deign to be angered with me, your serf,\nbidding me be ashamed of not obeying my master's orders. And I, who am\nnot an old dog, but your faithful servant, I do obey my master's orders,\nand I have ever served you zealously, even unto white hairs. I did not\nwrite to you about Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch's wound in order not to frighten you\nwithout cause, and now we hear that our mistress, our mother, Avdotia\nVassili\u00c3\u00a9va is ill of fright, and I shall go and pray heaven for her\nhealth. Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch has been wounded in the chest, beneath the\nright shoulder, under one rib, to the depth of a _verchok_[48] and a\nhalf, and he has been taken care of in the Commandant's house, whither\nwe brought him from the river bank, and it was the barber here, St\u00c3\u00a9pan\nParamonoff, who treated him; and now Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch, thank God, is\ngoing on well, and there is nothing but good to tell of him. His\nsuperiors, according to hearsay, are well pleased with him, and\nVassilissa Igorofna treats him as her own son; and because such an\naffair should have happened to him you must not reproach him; the horse\nmay have four legs and yet stumble. And you deign to write that you will\nsend me to keep the pigs. My lord's will be done. And now I salute you\ndown to the ground.\n\n\"Your faithful serf,\n\n\"ARKHIP SAV\u00c3\u0089LI\u00c3\u0089FF.\"\n\nI could not help smiling once or twice as I read the good old man's\nletter. I did not feel equal to writing to my father. And to make my\nmother easy the letter of Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch seemed to me amply sufficient.\n\nFrom this day my position underwent a change. Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna scarcely\never spoke to me, and even tried to avoid me. The Commandant's house\nbecame unbearable to me; little by little I accustomed myself to stay\nalone in my quarters.\n\nAt first Vassilissa Igorofna remonstrated, but, seeing I persisted in my\nline of conduct, she left me in peace. I only saw Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch when\nmilitary duties brought us in contact. I had only rare interviews with\nChvabrine, whom I disliked the more that I thought I perceived in him a\nsecret enmity, which confirmed all the more my suspicions. Life became a\nburden to me. I gave myself up, a prey to dark melancholy, which was\nfurther fed by loneliness and inaction. My love burnt the more hotly for\nmy enforced quiet, and tormented me more and more. I lost all liking for\nreading and literature. I was allowing myself to be completely cast\ndown, and I dreaded either becoming mad or dissolute, when events\nsuddenly occurred which strongly influenced my life, and gave my mind a\nprofound and salutary rousing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nPUGATCH\u00c3\u0089F.\n\n\nBefore beginning to relate those strange events to which I was witness,\nI must say a few words about the state of affairs in the district of\nOrenburg about the end of the year 1773. This rich and large province\nwas peopled by a crowd of half-savage tribes, who had lately\nacknowledged the sovereignty of the Russian Tzars. Their perpetual\nrevolts, their impatience of all rule and civilized life, their\ntreachery and cruelty, obliged the authorities to keep a sharp watch\nupon them in order to reduce them to submission.\n\nForts had been placed at suitable points, and in most of them troops\nhad been permanently established, composed of Cossacks, formerly\npossessors of the banks of the River Ya\u00c3\u00afk. But even these Cossacks, who\nshould have been a guarantee for the peace and quiet of the country, had\nfor some time shown a dangerous and unruly spirit towards the Imperial\nGovernment. In 1772 a riot took place in the principal settlement. This\nriot was occasioned by the severe measures taken by General Traubenberg,\nin order to quell the insubordination of the army. The only result was\nthe barbarous murder of Traubenberg, the substitution of new chiefs, and\nat last the suppression of the revolt by volleys of grape and harsh\npenalties.\n\nAll this befell shortly before my coming to Fort B\u00c3\u00a9logorsk. Then all\nwas, or seemed, quiet. But the authorities had too lightly lent faith\nto the pretended repentance of the rebels, who were silently brooding\nover their hatred, and only awaiting a favourable opportunity to reopen\nthe struggle.\n\nOne evening (it was early in October, 1773) I was alone in my quarters,\nlistening to the whistling of the autumn wind and watching the clouds\npassing rapidly over the moon. A message came from the Commandant that\nhe wished to see me at once at his house. I found there Chvabrine, Iw\u00c3\u00a1n\nIgnatiitch, and the \"_ouriadnik_\" of the Cossacks. Neither the wife nor\ndaughter of the Commandant was in the room. He greeted me in an absent\nmanner. Then, closing the door, he made everybody sit down, except the\n\"_ouriadnik_,\" who remained standing, drew a letter from his pocket, and\nsaid to us--\n\n\"Gentlemen, important news. Listen to what the General writes.\"\n\nHe put on his spectacles and read as follows:--\n\n\"_To the Commandant of Fort B\u00c3\u00a9logorsk,\n\n\"Captain Mironoff, these. (Secret.)_\n\n\"I hereby inform you that the fugitive and schismatic Don Cossack,\nEmelian Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f, after being guilty of the unpardonable insolence of\nusurping the name of our late Emperor, Peter III.,[49] has assembled a\ngang of robbers, excited risings in villages on the Ya\u00c3\u00afk, and taken and\noven destroyed several forts, while committing everywhere robberies and\nmurders. In consequence, when you shall receive this, it will be your\nduty to take such measures as may be necessary against the aforesaid\nrascally usurper, and, if possible, crush him completely should he\nventure to attack the fort confided to your care.\"\n\n\"Take such measures as may be necessary,\" said the Commandant, taking\noff his spectacles and folding up the paper. \"You know it is very easy\nto say that. The scoundrel seems in force, and we have but a hundred and\nthirty men, even counting the Cossacks, on whom we must not count too\nmuch, be it said, without any reproach to you, Maximitch.\" The\n\"_ouriadnik_\" smiled. \"Nevertheless, let us do our duty, gentlemen. Be\nready, place sentries, let there be night patrols in case of attack,\nshut the gates, and turn out the troops. You, Maximitch, keep a sharp\neye on the Cossacks; look to the cannon, and let it be well cleansed;\nand, above all, let everything be kept secret. Let no one in the fort\nknow anything until the time comes.\"\n\nAfter thus giving his orders, Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch dismissed us. I went out\nwith Chvabrine, speculating upon what we had just heard.\n\n\"What do you think of it? How will it all end?\" I asked him.\n\n\"God knows,\" said he; \"we shall see. As yet there is evidently nothing\nserious. If, however--\"\n\nThen he fell into a brown study while whistling absently a French air.\n\nIn spite of all our precautions the news of Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f's appearance\nspread all over the fort. Whatever was the respect in which Iv\u00c3\u00a1n\nKouzmitch held his wife, he would not have revealed to her for the world\na secret confided to him on military business.\n\nAfter receiving the General's letter he had rather cleverly got rid of\nVassilissa Igorofna by telling her that Father Garasim had heard most\nextraordinary news from Orenburg, which he was keeping most profoundly\ndark.\n\nVassilissa Igorofna instantly had a great wish to go and see the Pope's\nwife, and, by the advice of Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch, she took Masha, lest she\nshould be dull all alone.\n\nLeft master of the field, Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch sent to fetch us at once, and\ntook care to shut up Polashka in the kitchen so that she might not spy\nupon us.\n\nVassilissa Igorofna came home without having been able to worm anything\nout of the Pope's wife; she learnt upon coming in that during her\nabsence Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch had held a council of war, and that Palashka had\nbeen locked up. She suspected that her husband had deceived her, and she\nimmediately began overwhelming him with questions. But Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch\nwas ready for this onset; he did not care in the least, and he boldly\nanswered his curious better-half--\n\n\"Look here, little mother, the country-women have taken it into their\nheads to light fires with straw, and as that might be the cause of a\nmisfortune, I assembled my officers, and I ordered them to watch that\nthe women do not make fires with straw, but rather with faggots and\nbrambles.\"\n\n\"And why were you obliged to shut up Polashka?\" his wife asked him. \"Why\nwas the poor girl obliged to stay in the kitchen till we came back?\"\n\nIv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch was not prepared for such a question; he stammered some\nincoherent words.\n\nVassilissa Igorofna instantly understood that her husband had deceived\nher, but as she could not at that moment get anything out of him, she\nforebore questioning him, and spoke of some pickled cucumbers which\nAkoulina Pamphilovna knew how to prepare in a superlative manner. All\nnight long Vassilissa Igorofna lay awake trying to think what her\nhusband could have in his head that she was not permitted to know.\n\nThe morrow, on her return from mass, she saw Iw\u00c3\u00a1n Ignatiitch busy\nclearing the cannon of the rags, small stones, bits of wood,\nknuckle-bones, and all kinds of rubbish that the little boys had crammed\nit with.\n\n\"What can these warlike preparations mean?\" thought the Commandant's\nwife. \"Can it be that they are afraid of an attack by the Kirghiz; but\nthen is it likely that Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch would hide from me such a trifle?\"\n\nShe called Iw\u00c3\u00a1n Ignatiitch, determined to have out of him the secret\nwhich was provoking her feminine curiosity.\n\nVassilissa Igorofna began by making to him some remarks on household\nmatters, like a judge who begins a cross-examination by questions\nirrelevant to the subject in hand, in order to reassure and lull the\nwatchfulness of the accused. Then, after a few minutes' silence, she\ngave a deep sigh, and said, shaking her head--\n\n\"Oh! good Lord! Just think what news! What will come of all this?\"\n\n\"Eh! my little mother,\" replied Iw\u00c3\u00a1n Ignatiitch; \"the Lord is merciful.\nWe have soldiers enough, and much, powder; I have cleared the cannon.\nPerhaps we may be able to defeat this Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f. If God do not forsake\nus, the wolf will eat none of us here.\"\n\n\"And what manner of man is this Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f?\" questioned the Commandant's\nwife.\n\nIw\u00c3\u00a1n Ignatiitch saw plainly that he had said too much, and bit his\ntongue; but it was too late. Vassilissa Igorofna obliged him to tell her\nall, after giving her word that she would tell no one.\n\nShe kept her promise, and did not breathe a word indeed to anyone, save\nonly to the Pope's wife, and that for the very good reason that the good\nlady's cow, being still out on the steppe, might be \"lifted\" by the\nrobbers.\n\nSoon everybody was talking of Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f. The rumours abroad about him\nwere very diverse. The Commandant sent the \"_ouriadnik_\" on a mission to\nlook well into all in the neighbouring village and little forts. The\n\"_ouriadnik_\" came back after an absence of two days, and reported that\nhe had seen in the steppe, about sixty versts from the fort, many fires,\nand that he had heard the Bashkirs say that an innumerable force was\napproaching. He had nothing of a more detailed or accurate nature to\nrelate, having been afraid of going too far.\n\nWe soon began to notice a certain stir among the Cossacks in the\ngarrison. They gathered in all the streets in little groups, spoke among\nthemselves in low voices, and dispersed directly they caught sight of a\ndragoon or any other Russian soldier. They were watched. Joula\u00c3\u00af, a\nbaptized Kalmuck, revealed to the Commandant something very serious.\nAccording to him the \"_ouriadnik_\" had made a false report. On his\nreturn the perfidious Cossack had told his comrades that he had advanced\nupon the rebels, and that he had been presented to their chief, and that\nthis chief gave him his hand to kiss and had had a long interview with\nhim. At once the Commandant put the \"_ouriadnik_\" in arrest, and\ndeclared Joula\u00c3\u00af his substitute. This change was received by the Cossacks\nwith manifest discontent. They grumbled aloud, and Iw\u00c3\u00a1n Ignatiitch, who\nexecuted the Commandant's orders, heard them with his own ears say\npretty clearly--\n\n\"Only wait a bit, you garrison rat!\"\n\nThe Commandant had intended to cross-examine his prisoner that same day,\nbut the \"_ouriadnik_\" had escaped, doubtless with the connivance of his\naccomplices.\n\nAnother thing occurred to augment the Commandant's disquiet; a Bashkir\nwas taken bearing seditious letters. Upon this occasion the Commandant\ndecided upon assembling his officers anew, and in order to do that he\nwished again to get rid of his wife under some plausible pretext. But as\nIv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch was one of the most upright and sincere of men he could\nnot think of any other way than that which he had already employed on a\nprevious occasion.\n\n\"Do you know, Vassilissa Igorofna,\" said he to her, while clearing his\nthroat once or twice, \"it is said that Father Garosim has received from\nthe town--\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue,\" interrupted his wife; \"you want again to call a\ncouncil of war, and talk without me about Emelian Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f; but you\nwill not deceive me this time.\"\n\nIv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch opened his eyes wide.\n\n\"Well, little mother,\" said he, \"if you know all, stay; there is nothing\nmore to be done, we will talk before you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are quite right, my little father,\" rejoined she; \"it is of\nno use your trying to play the sly fox. Send for the officers.\"\n\nWe again met. Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch read to us, before his wife, Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f's\nproclamation, drawn up by some illiterate Cossack. The robber proclaimed\nhis intention of marching directly upon our fort, inviting the Cossacks\nand the soldiers to join him, and counselling the chiefs not to\nwithstand him, threatening them, should they do so, with the utmost\ntorture.\n\nThe proclamation was written in coarse but emphatic terms, and was\nlikely to produce a great impression on the minds of simple people.\n\n\"What a rascal,\" cried the Commandant's wife. \"Just look what he dares\nto propose to us! To go out to meet him and lay our colours at his feet!\nOh! the son of a dog! He doesn't then know that we have been forty\nyears in the service, and that, thank heaven, we have had a taste of all\nsorts! Is it possible that there can have been commandants base and\ncowardly enough to obey this robber?\"\n\n\"Such a thing should not be possible,\" rejoined Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch;\n\"nevertheless, they say the scoundrel has already got possession of\nseveral forts.\"\n\n\"It appears that he is in strength, indeed,\" observed Chvabrine.\n\n\"We shall know directly the amount of his strength,\" resumed the\nCommandant. \"Vassilissa Igorofna, give me the key of the barn. Iv\u00c3\u00a1n\nIgnatiitch, bring up the Bashkir and tell Joula\u00c3\u00af to fetch the rods.\"[50]\n\n\"Wait a bit, Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch,\" said the Commandant's wife, rising; \"let\nme take Masha out of the house. Without I do so she would hear the\ncries, and they would frighten her. And as for me, to tell the truth, I\nam not over curious about such matters. So hoping to see you again--\"\n\nTorture was then so rooted in the practice of justice that the\nbeneficial ukase[51] ordaining its abolition remained a long time of\nnone effect. It was thought that the confession of the accused was\nindispensable to condemnation, an idea not merely unreasonable, but\ncontrary to the dictates of the simplest good sense in legal matters,\nfor, if the denial of the accused be not accepted as proof of his\ninnocence, the extorted confession should still less serve as proof of\nhis guilt. Yet even now I still hear old judges sometimes regret the\nabolition of this barbarous custom.\n\nBut in those days no one ever doubted of the necessity for torture,\nneither the judges nor the accused themselves. That is why the\nCommandant's order did not arouse any surprise or emotion among us. Iw\u00c3\u00a1n\nIgnatiitch went off to seek the Bashkir, who was under lock and key in\nthe Commandant's barn, and a few minutes later he was brought into the\nante-room. The Commandant ordered him to be brought before him.\n\nThe Bashkir crossed the sill with difficulty, owing to the wooden\nshackles he had on his feet. I glanced at him and involuntarily\nshuddered.\n\nHe lifted his high cap and remained near the door. I shall never forget\nthat man; he seemed to be at least seventy years old, and he had neither\nnose nor ears. His head was shaven, and his beard consisted of a few\ngrey hairs. He was little of stature, thin and bent; but his Tartar eyes\nstill sparkled.\n\n\"Eh! eh!\" said the Commandant, who recognized by these terrible marks\none of the rebels punished in 1741, \"you are an old wolf, by what I see.\nYou have already been caught in our traps. 'Tis not the first time you\nhave rebelled, since you have been so well cropped. Come near and tell\nme who sent you.\"\n\nThe old Bashkir remained silent, and looked at the Commandant with a\nlook of complete idiocy.\n\n\"Well, why don't you speak?\" continued Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch. \"Don't you\nunderstand Russ? Joula\u00c3\u00af, ask him in your language who sent him to our\nfort.\"\n\nJoula\u00c3\u00af repeated Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch's question in the Tartar language. But\nthe Bashkir looked at him with the same expression, and spoke never a\nword.\n\n\"Jachki!\" the Commandant rapped out a Tartar oath, \"I'll make you speak.\nHere, Joula\u00c3\u00af, strip him of his striped dressing-gown, his idiot's dress,\nand stripe his shoulders. Now then, Joula\u00c3\u00af, touch him up properly.\"\n\nTwo pensioners began undressing the Bashkir. Great uneasiness then\noverspread the countenance of the unhappy man. He began looking all\nround like a poor little animal in the hands of children. But when one\nof the pensioners seized his hands in order to twine them round his\nneck, and, stooping, upraised the old man on his shoulders, when Joula\u00c3\u00af\ntook the rods and lifted his hands to strike, then the Bashkir gave a\nlong, deep moan, and, throwing back his head, opened his mouth, wherein,\ninstead of a tongue, was moving a short stump.\n\nWe were all horrified.\n\n\"Well,\" said the Commandant, \"I see we can get nothing out of him.\nJoula\u00c3\u00af, take the Bashkir back to the barn; and as for us, gentlemen, we\nhave still to deliberate.\"\n\nWe were continuing to discuss our situation, when Vassilissa Igorofna\nburst into the room, breathless, and looking affrighted.\n\n\"What has happened to you?\" asked the Commandant, surprised.\n\n\"Misery! misery!\" replied Vassilissa Igorofna. \"Fort Nijn\u00c3\u00a9osern was\ntaken this morning. Father Garasim's boy has just come back. He saw how\nit was taken. The Commandant and all the officers have been hanged, all\nthe soldiers are prisoners. The rascals are coming here.\"\n\nThis unexpected news made a great impression upon me. The Commandant of\nFort Nijn\u00c3\u00a9osern, a gentle and quiet young man, was known to me. Two\nmonths previously he had passed on his way from Orenburg with his young\nwife, and he had stayed with Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch.\n\nThe Nijn\u00c3\u00a9osernaia was only twenty-five versts away from our fort. From\nhour to hour we might expect to be attacked by Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f. The probable\nfate of Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna rose vividly before my imagination, and my heart\nfailed me as I thought of it.\n\n\"Listen, Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch,\" I said to the Commandant, \"it is our duty to\ndefend the fort to the last gasp, that is understood. But we must think\nof the women's safety. Send them to Orenburg, if the road be still open,\nor to some fort further off and safer, which the rascals have not yet\nhad time to reach.\"\n\nIv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch turned to his wife.\n\n\"Look here, mother, really, had we not better send you away to some more\ndistant place till the rebels be put down?\"\n\n\"What nonsense!\" replied his wife.\n\n\"Show me the fortress that bullets cannot reach. In what respect is\nB\u00c3\u00a9logorskaia not safe? Thank heaven, we have now lived here more than\ntwenty-one years. We have seen the Bashkirs and the Kirghiz; perhaps we\nmay weary out Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f here.\"\n\n\"Well, little mother,\" rejoined Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch, \"stay if you like, since\nyou reckon so much on our fort. But what are we to do with Masha? It is\nall right if we weary him out or if we be succoured. But if the robbers\ntake the fort?\"\n\n\"Well, then--\"\n\nBut here Vassilissa Igorofna could only stammer and become silent,\nchoked by emotion.\n\n\"No, Vassilissa Igorofna,\" resumed the Commandant, who remarked that his\nwords had made a great impression on his wife, perhaps for the first\ntime in her life; \"it is not proper for Masha to stay here. Let us send\nher to Orenburg to her godmother. There are enough soldiers and cannons\nthere, and the walls are stone. And I should even advise you to go away\nthither, for though you be old yet think on what will befall you if the\nfort be taken by assault.\"\n\n\"Well! well!\" said the wife, \"we will send away Masha; but don't ask me\nto go away, and don't think to persuade me, for I will do no such thing.\nIt will not suit me either in my old age to part from you and go to seek\na lonely grave in a strange land. We have lived together; we will die\ntogether.\"\n\n\"And you are right,\" said the Commandant. \"Let us see, there is no time\nto lose. Go and get Masha ready for her journey; to-morrow we will start\nher off at daybreak, and we will even give her an escort, though, to\ntell the truth, we have none too many people here. But where is she?\"\n\n\"At Akoulina Pamphilovna's,\" answered his wife. \"She turned sick when\nshe heard of the taking of Nijn\u00c3\u00a9osern; I dread lest she should fall\nill. Oh! God in heaven! that we should have lived to see this!\"\n\nVassilissa Igorofna went away to make ready for her daughter's\ndeparture.\n\nThe council at the Commandant's still continued, but I no longer took\nany part in it. Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna reappeared for supper, pale and her eyes\nred. We supped in silence, and we rose from table earlier than usual.\nEach of us returned to his quarters after bidding good-bye to the whole\nfamily. I purposely forgot my sword, and came back to fetch it. I felt I\nshould find Marya alone; in fact, she met me in the porch, and handed me\nmy sword.\n\n\"Good-bye, Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch,\" she said to me, crying; \"they are sending\nme to Orenburg. Keep well and happy. Mayhap God will allow us to see one\nanother again, if not--\"\n\nShe began to sob. I pressed her in my arms.\n\n\"God be with you, my angel,\" I said to her. \"My darling, my loved one,\nwhatever befall me, rest assured that my last thought and my last prayer\nwill be for you.\"\n\nMasha still wept, sheltered on my breast. I kissed her passionately, and\nabruptly went out.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nTHE ASSAULT.\n\n\nAll the night I could not sleep, and I did not even take off my clothes.\nI had meant in the early morning to gain the gate of the fort, by which\nMarya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna was to leave, to bid her a last good-bye. I felt that a\ncomplete change had come over me. The agitation of my mind seemed less\nhard to bear than the dark melancholy in which I had been previously\nplunged. Blended with the sorrow of parting, I felt within me vague, but\nsweet, hopes, an eager expectation of coming dangers, and a feeling of\nnoble ambition.\n\nThe night passed quickly. I was going out, when my door opened and the\ncorporal came in to tell me that our Cossacks had left the fort during\nthe night, taking away with them by force Joula\u00c3\u00af, and that around our\nramparts unknown people were galloping. The thought that Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna\nhad not been able to get away terrified me to death. I hastily gave some\norders to the corporal, and I ran to the Commandant's house.\n\nDay was breaking. I was hurrying down the street when I heard myself\ncalled by someone. I stopped.\n\n\"Where are you going, if I may presume to ask you?\" said Iw\u00c3\u00a1n\nIgnatiitch, catching me up. \"Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch is on the ramparts, and has\nsent me to seek you. The '_pugatch_'[52] has come.\"\n\n\"Is Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna gone?\" I asked, with an inward trembling.\n\n\"She hasn't had time,\" rejoined Iw\u00c3\u00a1n Ignatiitch. \"The road to Orenburg\nis blocked, the fort surrounded, and it's a bad look-out, Petr'\nAndr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch.\"\n\nWe went to the ramparts, a little natural height, and fortified by a\npalisade. We found the garrison here under arms. The cannon had been\ndragged hither the preceding evening. The Commandant was walking up and\ndown before his little party; the approach of danger had given the old\nwarrior wonderful activity. Out on the steppe, and not very far from the\nfort, could be seen about twenty horsemen, who appeared to be Cossacks;\nbut amongst them were some Bashkirs, easily distinguished by their high\ncaps and their quivers. The Commandant passed down the ranks of the\nlittle army, saying to the soldiers--\n\n\"Now, children, let us do well to-day for our mother, the Empress, and\nlet us show all the world that we are brave men, and true to our\noaths.\"\n\nThe soldiers by loud shouts expressed their goodwill and assent.\nChvabrine remained near me, attentively watching the enemy. The people\nwhom we could see on the steppe, noticing doubtless some stir in the\nfort, gathered into parties, and consulted together. The Commandant\nordered Iw\u00c3\u00a1n Ignatiitch to point the cannon at them, and himself applied\nthe match. The ball passed whistling over their heads without doing them\nany harm. The horsemen at once dispersed at a gallop, and the steppe was\ndeserted.\n\nAt this moment Vassilissa Igorofna appeared on the ramparts, followed by\nMarya, who had not wished to leave her.\n\n\"Well,\" said the Commandant's wife, \"how goes the battle? Where is the\nenemy?\"\n\n\"The enemy is not far,\" replied Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch; \"but if God wills all\nwill be well. And you, Masha, are you afraid?\"\n\n\"No, papa,\" replied Marya, \"I am more frightened alone in the house.\"\n\nShe glanced at me, trying to smile. I squeezed the hilt of my sword,\nremembering that I had received it the eve from her hand, as if for her\ndefence. My heart burnt within my breast; I felt as if I were her\nknight; I thirsted to prove to her that I was worthy of her trust, and I\nimpatiently expected the decisive moment.\n\nAll at once, coming from a height about eight versts from the fort,\nappeared fresh parties of horsemen, and soon the whole steppe became\ncovered with people, armed with arrows and lances. Amongst them, dressed\nin a red caftan, sword in hand, might be seen a man mounted on a white\nhorse, a conspicuous figure. This was Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f himself.\n\nHe stopped, and they closed round him, and soon afterwards, probably by\nhis orders, four men came out of the crowd, and approached our ramparts\nat full gallop. We recognized in them some of our traitors. One of them\nwaved a sheet of paper above his head; another bore on the point of his\npike the head of Joula\u00c3\u00af, which he cast to us over the palisade. The head\nof the poor Kalmuck rolled to the feet of the Commandant.\n\nThe traitors shouted to us--\n\n\"Don't fire. Come out to receive the Tzar; the Tzar is here.\"\n\n\"Children, fire!\" cried the Commandant for all answer.\n\nThe soldiers fired a volley. The Cossack who had the letter quivered and\nfell from his horse; the others fled at full speed. I glanced at Marya\nIv\u00c3\u00a1nofna. Spellbound with horror at the sight of Joula\u00c3\u00af's head, stunned\nby the noise of the volley, she seemed unconscious. The Commandant\ncalled the corporal, and bid him go and take the paper from the fallen\nCossack. The corporal went out into the open, and came back leading by\nits bridle the dead man's horse. He gave the letter to the Commandant.\n\nIv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch read it in a low voice, and tore it into bits. We now saw\nthat the rebels were making ready to attack. Soon the bullets whistled\nabout our ears, and some arrows came quivering around us in the earth\nand in the posts of the palisade.\n\n\"Vassilissa Igorofna,\" said the Commandant, \"this is not a place for\nwomen. Take away Masha; you see very well that the girl is more dead\nthan alive.\"\n\nVassilissa Igorofna, whom the sound of the bullets had somewhat subdued,\nglanced towards the steppe, where a great stir was visible in the crowd,\nand said to her husband--\n\n\"Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch, life and death are in God's hands; bless Masha. Masha,\ngo to your father.\"\n\nPale and trembling, Marya approached Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch and dropped on her\nknees, bending before him with reverence.\n\nThe old Commandant made the sign of the cross three times over her, then\nraised her up, kissed her, and said to her, in a voice husky with\nemotion--\n\n\"Well, Masha, may you be happy. Pray to God, and He will not forsake\nyou. If an honest man come forward, may God grant you both love and\nwisdom. Live together as we have lived, my wife and I. And now farewell,\nMasha. Vassilissa Igorofna, take her away quickly.\"\n\nMarya threw herself upon his neck and began sobbing.\n\n\"Kiss me, too,\" said the Commandant's wife, weeping. \"Good-bye, my Iv\u00c3\u00a1n\nKouzmitch. Forgive me if I have ever vexed you.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, good-bye, little mother,\" said the Commandant, embracing his\nold companion. \"There, now, enough; go away home, and if you have time\nput Masha on a '_sarafan_.'\"[53]\n\nThe Commandant's wife went away with her daughter. I followed Marya with\nmy eyes; she turned round and made me a last sign.\n\nIv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch came back to us, and turned his whole attention to the\nenemy. The rebels gathered round their leader, and all at once\ndismounted hastily.\n\n\"Be ready,\" the Commandant said to us, \"the assault is about to begin.\"\n\nAt the same moment resounded wild war cries. The rebels were racing down\non the fort. Our cannon was loaded with grape. The Commandant allowed\nthem to approach within a very short distance, and again applied a\nmatch to the touch-hole. The grape struck in the midst of the crowd, and\ndispersed it in every direction. The leader alone remained to the fore,\nbrandishing his sword; he appeared to be exhorting them hotly. The yells\nwhich had ceased for a moment were redoubled anew.\n\n\"Now, children,\" cried the Commandant, \"open the door, beat the drum,\nand forward! Follow me for a sally!\"\n\nThe Commandant, Iw\u00c3\u00a1n Ignatiitch, and I found ourselves in a moment\nbeyond the parapet. But the garrison, afraid, had not stirred.\n\n\"What are you doing, my children?\" shouted Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch. \"If we must\ndie, let us die; it is our duty.\"\n\nAt this moment the rebels fell upon us and forced the entrance of the\ncitadel. The drum ceased, the garrison threw down its arms. I had been\nthrown down, but I got up and passed helter-skelter with the crowd into\nthe fort. I saw the Commandant wounded in the head, and hard pressed by\na little band of robbers clamouring for the keys. I was running to help\nhim, when several strong Cossacks seized me, and bound me with their\n\"_k\u00c3\u00bachaks_,\"[54] shouting--\n\n\"Wait a bit, you will see what will become of you traitors to the Tzar!\"\n\nWe were dragged along the streets. The inhabitants came out of their\nhouses, offering bread and salt. The bells were rung. All at once shouts\nannounced that the Tzar was in the square waiting to receive the oaths\nof the prisoners. All the crowd diverged in that direction, and our\nkeepers dragged us thither.\n\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f was seated in an armchair on the threshold of the Commandant's\nhouse. He wore an elegant Cossack caftan, embroidered down the seams. A\nhigh cap of marten sable, ornamented with gold tassels, came closely\ndown over his flashing eyes. His face did not seem unknown to me. The\nCossack chiefs surrounded him. Father Garasim, pale and trembling, was\nstanding, cross in hand, at the foot of the steps, and seemed to be\nsilently praying for the victims brought before him. In the square a\ngallows was being hastily erected. When we came near, some Bashkirs\ndrove back the crowd, and we were presented to Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f.\n\nThe bells ceased clanging, and the deepest silence reigned again.\n\n\"Where is the Commandant?\" asked the usurper. Our \"_ouriadnik_\" came\nforward and pointed out Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch. Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f looked fiercely upon\nthe old man and said to him, \"How was it you dared to oppose me, your\nrightful Emperor?\"\n\nThe Commandant, enfeebled by his wound, collected his remaining\nstrength, and replied, in a resolute tone--\n\n\"You are not my Emperor; you are a usurper and a robber!\"\n\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f frowned and waved his white handkerchief. Several Cossacks\nimmediately seized the old Commandant and dragged him away to the\ngallows. Astride on the crossbeam, sat the disfigured Bashkir who had\nbeen cross-examined on the preceding evening; he held a rope in his\nhand, and I saw the next moment poor Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch swinging in the air.\nThen Iw\u00c3\u00a1n Ignatiitch was brought before Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f.\n\n\"Swear fidelity,\" Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f said to him, \"to the Emperor, Petr'\nF\u00c3\u00a9dorovitch!\"[55]\n\n\"You are not our Emperor!\" replied the lieutenant, repeating his\nCommandant's words; \"you are a robber, my uncle, and a usurper.\"\n\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f again gave the handkerchief signal, and good Iw\u00c3\u00a1n Ignatiitch\nswung beside his old chief. It was my turn. Boldly I looked on Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f\nand made ready to echo the answer of my outspoken comrades.\n\nThen, to my inexpressible surprise, I saw among the rebels Chvabrine,\nwho had found time to cut his hair short and to put on a Cossack caftan.\nHe approached Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f, and whispered a few words in his ear.\n\n\"Hang him!\" said Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f, without deigning to throw me a look. The\nrope was passed about my neck. I began saying a prayer in a low voice,\noffering up to God a sincere repentance for all my sins, imploring Him\nto save all those who were dear to my heart. I was already at the foot\nof the gallows.\n\n\"Fear nothing! Fear nothing!\" the assassins said to me, perhaps to give\nme courage, when all at once a shout was heard--\n\n\"Stop, accursed ones!\"\n\nThe executioners stayed their hand. I looked up. Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch lay\nprostrate at the feet of Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f.\n\n\"Oh! my own father!\" my poor follower was saying. \"What need have you of\nthe death of this noble child? Let him go free, and you will get a good\nransom; but for an example and to frighten the rest, let them hang me,\nan old man!\"\n\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f gave a signal; I was immediately unbound.\n\n\"Our father shows you mercy,\" they said to me. At this moment I cannot\nsay that I was much overjoyed at my deliverance, but I cannot say either\nthat I regretted it, for my feelings were too upset. I was again brought\nbefore the usurper and forced to kneel at his feet. Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f held out\nto me his muscular hand. \"Kiss his hand! kiss his hand!\" was shouted\naround me. But rather would I have preferred the most cruel torture to\nsuch an abasement.\n\n\"My father, Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch,\" whispered Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch to me, and nudged me\nwith his elbow, \"don't be obstinate. What does it matter? Spit and kiss\nthe hand of the rob--, kiss his hand!\"\n\nI did not stir. Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f withdrew his hand and said, smiling--\n\n\"Apparently his lordship is quite idiotic with joy; raise him.\"\n\nI was helped up and left free. The infamous drama drew to a close.\n\nThe villagers began to swear fidelity. One after another they came near,\nkissed the cross, and saluted the usurper. Then it came to the turn of\nthe soldiers of the garrison. The tailor of the company, armed with his\nbig blunt scissors, cut off their queues. They shook their heads and\ntouched their lips to Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f's hand; the latter told them they were\npardoned and enrolled amongst his troops.\n\nAll this lasted about three hours. At last Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f rose from his\narmchair and went down the steps, followed by his chiefs. There was\nbrought for him a white horse, richly caparisoned. Two Cossacks held his\narms and helped him into the saddle.\n\nHe announced to Father Garasim that he would dine at his house. At this\nmoment arose a woman's heartrending shrieks. Some robbers were dragging\nto the steps Vassilissa Igorofna, with dishevelled hair and\nhalf-dressed. One of them had already appropriated her cloak; the others\nwere carrying off the mattresses, boxes, linen, tea sets, and all manner\nof things.\n\n\"Oh, my fathers!\" cried the poor old woman. \"Let me alone, I pray you;\nmy fathers, my fathers, bring me to Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch.\" All of a sudden\nshe perceived the gallows and recognized her husband. \"Villains!\" she\nexclaimed, beside herself; \"what have you done? Oh, my light, my Iv\u00c3\u00a1n\nKouzmitch! Bold soldier heart, neither Prussian bayonets nor Turkish\nbullets ever harmed you; and you have died before a vile runaway felon.\"\n\n\"Silence the old witch,\" said Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f.\n\nA young Cossack struck her with his sword on the head, and she fell dead\nat the foot of the steps. Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f went away, all the people crowding\nin his train.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nTHE UNEXPECTED VISIT.\n\n\nThe square remained empty. I stood in the same place, unable to collect\nmy thoughts, disturbed by so many terrible events.\n\nMy uncertainty about Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna's fate tormented me more than I can\nsay. Where was she? What had become of her? Had she had time to hide\nherself? Was her place of refuge safe and sure? Full of these oppressive\nthoughts, I went to the Commandant's house. All was empty. The chairs,\nthe tables, the presses were burned, and the crockery in bits; the\nplace was in dreadful disorder. I quickly ran up the little stair which\nled to Marya's room, where I was about to enter for the first time in my\nlife.\n\nHer bed was topsy-turvy, the press open and ransacked. A lamp still\nburned before the \"_kivott_\"[56] equally empty; but a small\nlooking-glass hanging between the door and window had not been taken\naway. What had become of the inmate of this simple maiden's cell? A\nterrible apprehension crossed my mind. I thought of Marya in the hands\nof the robbers. My heart failed me; I burst into tears and murmured the\nname of my loved one. At this moment I heard a slight noise, and\nPolashka, very pale, came out from behind the press.\n\n\"Oh, Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch,\" said she, wringing her hands; \"what a day, what\nhorrors!\"\n\n\"Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna,\" cried I, impatiently, \"where is Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna?\"\n\n\"The young lady is alive,\" replied Polashka; \"she is hidden at Akoulina\nPamphilovna's.\"\n\n\"In the pope's house!\" I exclaimed, affrighted. \"Good God! Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f is\nthere!\"\n\nI rushed out of the room, in two jumps I was in the street and running\nwildly towards the pope's house. From within there resounded songs,\nshouts, and bursts of laughter; Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f was at the table with his\ncompanions. Polashka had followed me; I sent her secretly to call aside\nAkoulina Pamphilovna. The next minute the pope's wife came out into the\nante-room, an empty bottle in her hand.\n\n\"In heaven's name where is Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna?\" I asked, with indescribable\nagitation.\n\n\"She is in bed, the little dove,\" replied the pope's wife, \"in my bed,\nbehind the partition. Ah! Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch, a misfortune very nearly\nhappened. But, thank God, all has passed happily over. The villain had\nscarcely sat down to table before the poor darling began to moan. I\nnearly died of fright. He heard her.\"\n\n\"'Who is that moaning, old woman?' said he.\n\n\"I saluted the robber down to the ground.\n\n\"'My niece, Tzar; she has been ill and in bed for more than a week.'\n\n\"'And your niece, is she young?'\n\n\"'She is young, Tzar.'\n\n\"'Let us see, old woman; show me your niece.'\n\n\"I felt my heart fail me; but what could I do?\n\n\"'Very well, Tzar; but the girl is not strong enough to rise and come\nbefore your grace.'\n\n\"'That's nothing, old woman; I'll go myself and see her.'\n\n\"And, would you believe it, the rascal actually went behind the\npartition. He drew aside the curtain, looked at her with his hawk's\neyes, and nothing more; God helped us. You may believe me when I say the\nfather and I were already prepared to die the death of martyrs. Luckily\nthe little dove did not recognize him. O, Lord God! what have we lived\nto see! Poor Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch! who would have thought it! And Vassilissa\nIgorofna and Iw\u00c3\u00a1n Ignatiitch! Why him too? And you, how came it that you\nwere spared? And what do you think of Chvabrine, of Alexy Iv\u00c3\u00a1nytch? He\nhas cut his hair short, and he is there having a spree with them. He is\na sly fox, you'll agree. And when I spoke of my sick niece, would you\nbelieve it, he looked at me as if he would like to run me through with\nhis knife. Still, he did not betray us, and I'm thankful to him for\nthat!\"\n\nAt this moment up rose the vinous shouts of the guests and the voice of\nFather Garasim. The guests wanted more wine, and the pope was calling\nhis wife.\n\n\"Go home, Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch,\" she said to me, in great agitation, \"I have\nsomething else to do than chatter to you. Some ill will befall you if\nyou come across any of them now. Good-bye, Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch. What must\nbe, must be; and it may be God will not forsake us.\"\n\nThe pope's wife went in; a little relieved, I returned to my quarters.\nCrossing the square I saw several Bashkirs crowding round the gallows in\norder to tear off the high boots of the hanged men. With difficulty I\nforbore showing my anger, which I knew would be wholly useless.\n\nThe robbers pervaded the fort, and were plundering the officers'\nquarters, and the shouts of the rebels making merry were heard\neverywhere. I went home. Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch met me on the threshold.\n\n\"Thank heaven!\" cried he, upon seeing me, \"I thought the villains had\nagain laid hold on you. Oh! my father, Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch, would you\nbelieve it, the robbers have taken everything from us: clothes, linen,\ncrockery and goods; they have left nothing. But what does it matter?\nThank God that they have at least left you your life! But oh! my master,\ndid you recognize their '_atam\u00c3\u00a1n_?'\"[57]\n\n\"No, I did not recognize him. Who is he?\"\n\n\"What, my little father, you have already forgotten the drunkard who\ndid you out of your '_touloup_' the day of the snowstorm, a hareskin\n'_touloup_,' brand new. And he, the rascal, who split all the seams\nputting it on.\"\n\nI was dumbfounded. The likeness of Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f to my guide was indeed\nstriking. I ended by feeling certain that he and Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f were one and\nthe same man, and I then understood why he had shown me mercy. I was\nfilled with astonishment at the extraordinary connection of events. A\nboy's \"_touloup_,\" given to a vagabond, saved my neck from the hangman,\nand a drunken frequenter of pothouses besieged forts and shook the\nEmpire.\n\n\"Will you not eat something?\" asked Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch, faithful to his old\nhabits. \"There is nothing in the house, it is true; but I shall look\nabout everywhere, and I will get something ready for you.\"\n\nLeft alone, I began to reflect. What could I do? To stay in the fort,\nwhich was now in the hands of the robber, or to join his band were\ncourses alike unworthy of an officer. Duty prompted me to go where I\ncould still be useful to my country in the critical circumstances in\nwhich it was now situated.\n\nBut my love urged me no less strongly to stay by Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna, to be\nher protector and her champion. Although I foresaw a new and inevitable\nchange in the state of things, yet I could not help trembling as I\nthought of the dangers of her situation.\n\nMy reflections were broken by the arrival of a Cossack, who came running\nto tell me that the great Tzar summoned me to his presence.\n\n\"Where is he?\" I asked, hastening to obey.\n\n\"In the Commandant's house,\" replied the Cossack. \"After dinner our\nfather went to the bath; now he is resting. Ah, sir! you can see he is a\nperson of importance--he deigned at dinner to eat two roast\nsucking-pigs; and then he went into the upper part of the vapour-bath,\nwhere it was so hot that Tarass Kurotchkin himself could not stand it;\nhe passed the broom to Bikbaieff, and only recovered by dint of cold\nwater. You must agree; his manners are very majestic, and in the bath,\nthey say, he showed his marks of Tzar--on one of his breasts a\ndouble-headed eagle as large as a p\u00c3\u00a9tak,[58] and on the other his own\nface.\"\n\nI did not think it worth while to contradict the Cossack, and I followed\nhim into the Commandant's house, trying to imagine beforehand my\ninterview with Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f, and to guess how it would end.\n\nThe reader will easily believe me when I say that I did not feel wholly\nreassured.\n\nIt was getting dark when I reached the house of the Commandant.\n\nThe gallows, with its victims, stood out black and terrible; the body of\nthe Commandant's poor wife still lay beneath the porch, close by two\nCossacks, who were on guard.\n\nHe who had brought me went in to announce my arrival. He came back\nalmost directly, and ushered me into the room where, the previous\nevening, I had bidden good-bye to Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna.\n\nI saw a strange scene before me. At a table covered with a cloth and\nladen with bottles and glasses was seated Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f, surrounded by ten\nCossack chiefs, in high caps and coloured shirts, heated by wine, with\nflushed faces and sparkling eyes. I did not see among them the new\nconfederates lately sworn in, the traitor Chvabrine and the\n\"_ouriadnik_.\"\n\n\"Ah, ah! so it is you, your lordship,\" said Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f, upon seeing me.\n\"You are welcome. All honour to you, and a place at our feast.\"\n\nThe guests made room. I sat down in silence at the end of the table.\n\nMy neighbour, a tall and slender young Cossack, with a handsome face,\npoured me out a bumper of brandy, which I did not touch. I was busy\nnoting the company.\n\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f was seated in the place of honour, his elbows on the table,\nand resting his black beard on his broad fist. His features, regular and\nagreeable, wore no fierce expression. He often addressed a man of about\nfifty years old, calling him sometimes Count, sometimes Timofeitsh,\nsometimes Uncle.\n\nEach man considered himself as good as his fellow, and none showed any\nparticular deference to their chief. They were talking of the morning's\nassault, of the success of the revolt, and of their forthcoming\noperations.\n\nEach man bragged of his prowess, proclaimed his opinions, and freely\ncontradicted Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f. And it was decided to march upon Orenburg, a\nbold move, which was nearly crowned with success. The departure was\nfixed for the day following.\n\nThe guests drank yet another bumper, rose from table, and took leave of\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f. I wished to follow them, but Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f said--\n\n\"Stay there, I wish to speak to you!\"\n\nWe remained alone together, and for a few moments neither spoke.\n\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f looked sharply at me, winking from time to time his left eye\nwith an indefinable expression of slyness and mockery. At last he gave\nway to a long burst of laughter, and that with such unfeigned gaiety\nthat I myself, regarding him, began to laugh without knowing why.\n\n\"Well, your lordship,\" said he, \"confess you were afraid when my fellows\ncast the rope about your neck. I warrant the sky seemed to you the size\nof a sheepskin. And you would certainly have swung beneath the\ncross-beam but for your old servant. I knew the old owl again directly.\nWell, would you ever have thought, sir, that the man who guided you to a\nlodging in the steppe was the great Tzar himself?\" As he said these\nwords he assumed a grave and mysterious air. \"You are very guilty as\nregards me,\" resumed he, \"but I have pardoned you on account of your\ncourage, and because you did me a good turn when I was obliged to hide\nfrom my enemies. But you shall see better things; I will load you with\nother favours when I shall have recovered my empire. Will you promise to\nserve me zealously?\"\n\nThe robber's question and his impudence appeared to be so absurd that I\ncould not restrain a smile.\n\n\"Why do you laugh?\" he asked, frowning. \"Do you not believe me to be the\ngreat Tzar? Answer me frankly.\"\n\nI did not know what to do. I could not recognize a vagabond as Emperor;\nsuch conduct was to me unpardonably base. To call him an impostor to his\nface was to devote myself to death; and the sacrifice for which I was\nprepared on the gallows, before all the world, and in the first heat of\nmy indignation, appeared to me a useless piece of bravado. I knew not\nwhat to say.\n\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f awaited my reply in fierce silence. At last (and I yet recall\nthat moment with satisfaction) the feeling of duty triumphed in me over\nhuman weakness, and I made reply to Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f--\n\n\"Just listen, and I will tell you the whole truth. You shall be judge.\nCan I recognize in you a Tzar? You are a clever man; you would see\ndirectly that I was lying.\"\n\n\"Who, then, am I, according to you?\"\n\n\"God alone knows; but whoever you be, you are playing a dangerous game.\"\n\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f cast at me a quick, keen glance.\n\n\"You do not then think that I am the Tzar Peter? Well, so let it be. Is\nthere no chance of success for the bold? In former times did not\nGrischka Otr\u00c3\u00a9pieff[59] reign? Think of me as you please, but do not\nleave me. What does it matter to you whether it be one or the other? He\nwho is pope is father. Serve me faithfully, and I will make you a\nfield-marshal and a prince. What do you say to this?\"\n\n\"No,\" I replied, firmly. \"I am a gentleman. I have sworn fidelity to Her\nMajesty the Tzarina; I cannot serve you. If you really wish me well,\nsend me back to Orenburg.\"\n\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f reflected.\n\n\"But if I send you away,\" said he, \"will you promise me at least not to\nbear arms against me?\"\n\n\"How can you expect me to promise you that?\" replied I. \"You know\nyourself that that does not depend upon me. If I be ordered to march\nagainst you I must submit. You are a chief now--you wish your\nsubordinates to obey you. How can I refuse to serve if I am wanted? My\nhead is at your disposal; if you let me go free, I thank you; if you\ncause me to die, may God judge you. Howbeit, I have told you the truth.\"\n\nMy outspoken candour pleased Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f.\n\n\"E'en so let it be,\" said he, clapping me on the shoulder; \"either\nentirely punish or entirely pardon. Go to the four winds and do what\nseems good in your eyes, but come to-morrow and bid me good-bye; and now\nbegone to bed--I am sleepy myself.\"\n\nI left Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f, and went out into the street. The night was still and\ncold, the moon and stars, sparkling with all their brightness, lit up\nthe square and the gallows. All was quiet and dark in the rest of the\nfort. Only in the tavern were lights still to be seen, and from within\narose the shouts of the lingering revellers.\n\nI threw a glance at the pope's house. The doors and the shutters were\nclosed; all seemed perfectly quiet there. I went home and found\nSav\u00c3\u00a9liitch deploring my absence. The news of my regained liberty\noverwhelmed him with joy.\n\n\"Thanks be to Thee, O Lord!\" said he, making the sign of the cross. \"We\nwill leave the fort to-morrow at break of day and we will go in God's\ncare. I have prepared something for you; eat, my father, and sleep till\nmorning quietly, as though in the pocket of Christ!\"\n\nI took his advice, and, after having supped with a good appetite, I went\nto sleep on the bare boards, as weary in mind as in body.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nTHE PARTING.\n\n\nThe drum awoke me very early, and I went to the Square. There the troops\nof Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f were beginning to gather round the gallows where the\nvictims of the preceding evening still hung. The Cossacks were on\nhorseback, the foot-soldiers with their arms shouldered, their colours\nflying in the air.\n\nSeveral cannons, among which I recognized ours, were placed on field-gun\ncarriages. All the inhabitants had assembled in the same place, awaiting\nthe usurper. Before the door of the Commandant's house a Cossack held by\nthe bridle a magnificent white horse of Kirghiz breed. I sought with my\neyes the body of the Commandant's wife; it had been pushed aside and\ncovered over with an old bark mat.\n\nAt last Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f came out of the house. All the crowd uncovered.\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f stopped on the doorstep and said good-morning to everybody.\nOne of the chiefs handed him a bag filled with small pieces of copper,\nwhich he began to throw broadcast among the people, who rushed to pick\nthem up, fighting for them with blows.\n\nThe principal confederates of Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f surrounded him. Among them was\nChvabrine. Our eyes met; he could read contempt in mine, and he looked\naway with an expression of deep hatred and pretended mockery. Seeing me\nin the crowd Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f beckoned to me and called me up to him.\n\n\"Listen,\" said he, \"start this very minute for Orenburg. You will tell\nthe governor and all the generals from me that they may expect me in a\nweek. Advise them to receive me with submission and filial love; if not,\nthey will not escape a terrible punishment. A good journey, to your\nlordship.\"\n\nThen turning to the people, he pointed out Chvabrine.\n\n\"There, children,\" said he, \"is your new Commandant; obey him in all\nthings; he answers to me for you and the fort.\"\n\nI heard these words with affright. Chvabrine become master of the place!\nMarya remained in his power! Good God! what would become of her?\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f came down the steps, his horse was brought round, he sprang\nquickly into the saddle, without waiting for the help of the Cossacks\nprepared to aid him.\n\nAt this moment I saw my Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch come out of the crowd, approach\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f, and present him with a sheet of paper. I could not think what\nit all meant.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f, with dignity.\n\n\"Deign to read it, and you will see,\" replied Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch.\n\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f took the paper and looked at it a long time with an air of\nimportance. At last he said--\n\n\"You write very illegibly; our lucid[60] eyes cannot make out anything.\nWhere is our Chief Secretary?\"\n\nA youth in a corporal's uniform ran up to Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f.\n\n\"Read it aloud,\" the usurper said to him, handing him the paper.\n\nI was extremely curious to know on what account my retainer had thought\nof writing to Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f. The Chief Secretary began in a loud voice,\nspelling out what follows--\n\n\"Two dressing gowns, one cotton, the other striped silk, six roubles.\"\n\n\"What does that mean?\" interrupted Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f, frowning.\n\n\"Tell him to read further,\" rejoined Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch, quite unmoved.\n\nThe Chief Secretary continued to read--\n\n\"One uniform of fine green cloth, seven roubles; one pair trousers,\nwhite cloth, five roubles; twelve shirts of Holland shirting, with\ncuffs, ten roubles; one box with tea service, two-and-a-half roubles.\"\n\n\"What is all this nonsense?\" cried Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f. \"What do these tea-boxes\nand breeches with cuffs matter to me?\"\n\nSav\u00c3\u00a9liitch cleared his throat with a cough, and set to work to explain\nmatters.\n\n\"Let my father condescend to understand that that is the bill of my\nmaster's goods which have been taken away by the rascals.\"\n\n\"What rascals?\" quoth Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f, in a fierce and terrible manner.\n\n\"Beg pardon, my tongue played me false,\" replied Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch. \"Rascals,\nno they are not rascals; but still your fellows have well harried and\nwell robbed, you must agree. Do not get angry; the horse has four legs,\nand yet he stumbles. Bid him read to the end.\"\n\n\"Well, let us see, read on,\" said Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f.\n\nThe Secretary continued--\n\n\"One chintz rug, another of wadded silk, four roubles; one pelisse fox\nskin lined with red ratteen, forty roubles; and lastly, a small hareskin\n'_touloup_,' which was left in the hands of your lordship in the wayside\nhouse on the steppe, fifteen roubles.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" cried Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f, whose eyes suddenly sparkled.\n\nI confess I was in fear for my poor follower. He was about to embark on\nnew explanations when Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f interrupted him.\n\n\"How dare you bother me with such nonsense?\" cried he, snatching the\npaper out of the hands of the Secretary and throwing it in Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch's\nface. \"Foolish old man, you have been despoiled; well, what does it\nsignify. But, old owl, you should eternally pray God for me and my lads\nthat you and your master do not swing up there with the other rebels. A\nhareskin '_touloup!_' Hark ye, I'll have you flayed alive that\n'_touloups_' may be made of your skin.\"\n\n\"As it may please you!\" replied Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch. \"But I am not a free man,\nand I must answer for my lord's goods.\"\n\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f was apparently in a fit of high-mindedness. He turned aside\nhis head, and went off without another word. Chvabrine and the chiefs\nfollowed him. All the band left the fort in order. The people escorted\nit.\n\nI remained alone in the square with Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch. My follower held in his\nhand the memorandum, and was contemplating it with an air of deep\nregret. Seeing my friendly understanding with Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f, he had thought\nto turn it to some account. But his wise hope did not succeed. I was\ngoing to scold him sharply for his misplaced zeal, and I could not help\nlaughing.\n\n\"Laugh, sir, laugh,\" said Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch; \"but when you are obliged to fit\nup your household anew, we shall see if you still feel disposed to\nlaugh.\"\n\nI ran to the pope's house to see Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna. The pope's wife came to\nmeet me with a sad piece of news. During the night high fever had set\nin, and the poor girl was now delirious. Akoulina Pamphilovna brought me\nto her room. I gently approached the bed. I was struck by the frightful\nchange in her face. The sick girl did not know me. Motionless before\nher, it was long ere I understood the words of Father Garasim and his\nwife, who apparently were trying to comfort me.\n\nGloomy thoughts overwhelmed me. The position of a poor orphan left\nsolitary and friendless in the power of rascals filled me with fear,\nwhile my own powerlessness equally distressed me; but Chvabrine,\nChvabrine above all, filled me with alarm. Invested with all power by\nthe usurper, and left master in the fort, with the unhappy girl, the\nobject of his hatred, he was capable of anything. What should I do? How\ncould I help her? How deliver her? Only in one way, and I embraced it.\nIt was to start with all speed for Orenburg, so as to hasten the\nrecapture of B\u00c3\u00a9logorsk, and to aid in it if possible.\n\nI took leave of the pope and of Akoulina Pamphilovna, recommending\nwarmly to them her whom I already regarded as my wife. I seized the hand\nof the young girl and covered it with tears and kisses.\n\n\"Good-bye,\" the pope's wife said to me, as she led me away. \"Good-bye,\nPetr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch; perhaps we may meet again in happier times. Don't\nforget us, and write often to us. Except you, poor Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna has no\nlonger stay or comforter.\"\n\nOut in the Square I stopped a minute before the gallows, which I\nrespectfully saluted, and I then took the road to Orenburg, accompanied\nby Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch, who did not forsake me.\n\nAs I thus went along, deep in thought, I heard all at once a horse\ngalloping behind me. I turned round, and saw a Cossack coming up from\nthe fort, leading a Bashkir horse, and making signs to me from afar to\nwait for him. I stopped, and soon recognized our \"_ouriadnik_.\"\n\nAfter joining us at a gallop, he jumped from the back of his own horse,\nand handing me the bridle of the other--\n\n\"Your lordship,\" said he, \"our father makes you a present of a horse,\nand a pelisse from his own shoulder.\" On the saddle was slung a plain\nsheepskin \"_touloup_.\" \"And, besides,\" added he, hesitatingly, \"he gives\nyou a half-rouble, but I have lost it by the way; kindly excuse it.\"\n\nSav\u00c3\u00a9liitch looked askance at him.\n\n\"You have lost it by the way,\" said he, \"and pray what is that which\njingles in your pocket, barefaced liar that you are?\"\n\n\"Jingling in my pocket?\" replied the \"_ouriadnik_,\" not a whit\ndisconcerted; \"God forgive you, old man, 'tis a bridlebit, and never a\nhalf rouble.\"\n\n\"Well! well!\" said I, putting an end to the dispute. \"Thank from me he\nwho sent you: and you may as well try as you go back to find the lost\nhalf rouble and keep it for yourself.\"\n\n\"Many thanks, your lordship,\" said he, turning his horse round; \"I will\npray God for ever for you.\"\n\nWith these words, he started off at a gallop, keeping one hand on his\npocket, and was soon out of sight. I put on the \"_touloup_\" and mounted\nthe horse, taking up Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch behind me.\n\n\"Don't you see, your lordship,\" said the old man, \"that it was not in\nvain that I presented my petition to the robber? The robber was ashamed\nof himself, although this long and lean Bashkir hoss and this peasant's\n'_touloup_' be not worth half what those rascals stole from us, nor what\nyou deigned to give him as a present, still they may be useful to us.\n'From an evil dog be glad of a handful of hairs.'\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nTHE SIEGE.\n\n\nAs we approached Orenburg we saw a crowd of convicts with cropped heads,\nand faces disfigured by the pincers of the executioner.[61]\n\nThey were working on the fortifications of the place under the\npensioners of the garrison. Some were taking away in wheelbarrows the\nrubbish which filled the ditch; others were hollowing out the earth with\nspades. Masons were bringing bricks and repairing the walls.\n\nThe sentries stopped us at the gates to demand our passports.\n\nWhen the Sergeant learnt that we came from Fort B\u00c3\u00a9logorsk he took us\ndirect to the General.\n\nI found him in his garden. He was examining the apple-trees which the\nbreath of autumn had already deprived of their leaves, and, with the\nhelp of an old gardener, he was enveloping them in straw. His face\nexpressed calm, good-humour and health.\n\nHe seemed very pleased to see me, and began to question me on the\nterrible events which I had witnessed. I related them.\n\nThe old man heard me with attention, and, while listening, cut the dead\nbranches.\n\n\"Poor Mironoff!\" said he, when I had done my sad story; \"'tis a pity! he\nwas a goot officer! And Matame Mironoff, she was a goot lady and\nfirst-rate at pickled mushrooms. And what became of Masha, the Captain's\ndaughter?\"\n\nI replied that she had stayed in the fort, at the pope's house.\n\n\"A\u00c3\u00afe! a\u00c3\u00afe! a\u00c3\u00afe!\" said the General. \"That's bad! very bad; it is quite\nimpossible to count on the discipline of robbers.\"\n\nI drew his attention to the fact that Fort B\u00c3\u00a9logorsk was not very far\naway, and that probably his excellency would not delay dispatching a\ndetachment of troops to deliver the poor inhabitants.\n\nThe General shook his head with an air of indecision--\n\n\"We shall see! we shall see!\" said he, \"we have plenty of time to talk\nabout it. I beg you will come and take tea with me. This evening there\nwill be a council of war; you can give us exact information about that\nrascal Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f and his army. Now in the meantime go and rest.\"\n\nI went away to the lodging that had been assigned me, and where\nSav\u00c3\u00a9liitch was already installed. There I impatiently awaited the hour\nfixed.\n\nThe reader may well believe I was anxious not to miss this council of\nwar, which was to have so great an influence on my life. I went at the\nappointed hour to the General's, where I found one of the civil\nofficials of Orenburg, the head of the Customs, if I recollect right, a\nlittle old man, fat and red-faced, dressed in a coat of watered silk.\n\nHe began questioning me on the fate of Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch, whom he called\nhis gossip, and he often interrupted me by many questions and\nsententious remarks, which if they did not show a man versed in the\nconduct of war, yet showed that he was possessed of natural wit, and of\nintelligence. During this time the other guests had assembled. When all\nwere seated, and each one had been offered a cup of tea, the General\nexplained lengthily and minutely what was the affair in hand.\n\n\"Now, gentlemen, we must decide how we mean to act against the rebels.\nShall it be offensively or defensively? Each way has its disadvantages\nand its advantages. Offensive warfare offers more hope of the enemy\nbeing speedily crushed; but a defensive war is surer and less dangerous.\nConsequently we will collect the votes according to the proper order,\nthat is to say, begin first consulting the juniors in respect of rank.\nNow, Mr. Ensign,\" continued he, addressing me, \"be so good as to give us\nyour opinion.\"\n\nI rose, and after having depicted in a few words Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f and his band,\nI declared that the usurper was not in a state to resist disciplined\ntroops. My opinion was received by the civil officials with visible\ndiscontent.\n\nThey saw in it the headstrong impertinence of youth.\n\nA murmur arose, and I distinctly heard said, half-aloud, the words,\n\"Beardless boy.\" The General turned towards me, and smilingly said--\n\n\"Mr. Ensign, the early votes in a council of war are generally for\noffensive measures. Now we will proceed. Mr. College Counsellor, tell us\nyour opinion?\"\n\nThe little old man in the watered silk coat made haste to swallow his\nthird cup of tea, which he had mixed with a good help of rum.\n\n\"I think, your excellency,\" said he, \"we must neither act on the\ndefensive nor yet on the offensive.\"\n\n\"How so, Mr. Counsellor?\" replied the General, astounded. \"There is\nnothing else open to us in tactics--one must act either on the defensive\nor the offensive.\"\n\n\"Your excellency, endeavour to suborn.\"\n\n\"Eh! eh! your opinion is very judicious; the act of corruption is one\nadmitted by the rules of war, and we will profit by your counsel. We\nmight offer for the rascal's head seventy or even a hundred roubles, and\ntake them from the secret funds.\"\n\n\"And then,\" interrupted the head of the Customs, \"I'm a Kirghiz instead\nof a College Counsellor if these robbers do not deliver up their at\u00c3\u00a1man,\nchained hand and foot.\"\n\n\"We will think of it, and talk of it again,\" rejoined the General.\n\"Still, in any case, we must also take military measures. Gentlemen,\ngive your votes in proper order.\"\n\nEveryone's opinion was contrary to mine. Those present vied with each\nother about the untrustworthiness of the troops, the uncertainty of\nsuccess, the necessity of prudence, and so forth. All were of opinion\nthat it was better to stay behind a strong wall, their safety assured by\ncannon, than to tempt the fortune of war in the open field.\n\nAt last, when all the opinions had been given, the General shook the\nashes out of his pipe and made the following speech:--\n\n\"Gentlemen, I must tell you, for my part, I am entirely of the opinion\nof our friend the ensign, for this opinion is based on the precepts of\ngood tactics, in which nearly always offensive movements are preferable\nto defensive ones.\" Here he paused a moment and filled his pipe. My\nself-love was triumphant, and I cast a proud glance at the civil\nofficials who were whispering among themselves, with an air of disquiet\nand discontent. \"But, gentlemen,\" resumed the General, with a sigh, and\npuffing out a cloud of smoke, \"I dare not take upon myself such a great\nresponsibility, when the safety is in question of the provinces\nentrusted to my care by Her Imperial Majesty, my gracious Sovereign.\nTherefore I see I am obliged to abide by the advice of the majority,\nwhich has ruled that prudence as well as reason declares that we should\nawait in the town the siege which threatens us, and that we should\ndefeat the attacks of the enemy by the force of artillery, and, if the\npossibility present itself, by well-directed sorties.\"\n\nIt was now the turn of the officials to look mockingly at me. The\ncouncil broke up. I could not help deploring the weakness of the honest\nsoldier who, against his own judgment, had decided to abide by the\ncounsel of ignorant and inexperienced people.\n\nSeveral days after this memorable council of war, Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f, true to his\nword, approached Orenburg. From the top of the city wall I took note of\nthe army of the rebels, and it seemed to me that their number had\nincreased tenfold since the last assault I had witnessed. They had also\nartillery, which had been taken from the little forts which had fallen\nbefore Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f. As I recollected the decision of the council of war, I\nforesaw a long imprisonment within the walls of Orenburg, and I was\nready to cry with vexation.\n\nFar be from me any intention of describing the siege of Orenburg, which\nbelongs to history, and not to a family memoir. In a few words,\ntherefore, I shall say that in consequence of the bad arrangements of\nthe authorities, the siege was disastrous for the inhabitants, who were\nforced to suffer hunger and privation of all kinds. Life at Orenburg was\nbecoming unendurable; each one awaited in anxiety the fate that should\nbefall him. All complained of the famine, which was, indeed, awful.\n\nThe inhabitants ended by becoming accustomed to the shells falling on\ntheir houses. Even the assaults of Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f no longer excited great\ndisturbance. I was dying of ennui. The time passed but slowly. I could\nnot get any letter from B\u00c3\u00a9logorsk, for all the roads were blocked, and\nthe separation from Marya became unbearable. My only occupation\nconsisted in my military rounds.\n\nThanks to Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f, I had a pretty good horse, with which I shared my\nscanty rations. Every day I passed beyond the ramparts, and I went and\nfired away against the scouts of Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f. In these sort of skirmishes\nthe rebels generally got the better of us, as they had plenty of food\nand were capitally mounted.\n\nOur thin, starved cavalry was unable to stand against them. Sometimes\nour famished infantry took the field, but the depth of the snow\nprevented action with any success against the flying cavalry of the\nenemy. The artillery thundered vainly from the height of the ramparts,\nand in the field guns could not work because of the weakness of the\nworn-out horses. This is how we made war, and this is what the officials\nof Orenburg called prudence and foresight.\n\nOne day, when we had succeeded in dispersing and driving before us a\nrather numerous band, I came up with one of the hindmost Cossacks, and I\nwas about to strike him with my Turkish sabre when he took off his cap\nand cried--\n\n\"Good day, Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch; how is your health?\"\n\nI recognized our \"_ouriadnik_.\" I cannot say how glad I was to see him.\n\n\"Good day, Maximitch,\" said I, \"is it long since you left B\u00c3\u00a9logorsk?\"\n\n\"No, not long, my little father, Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch; I only came back\nyesterday. I have a letter for you.\"\n\n\"Where is it?\" I cried, overjoyed.\n\n\"I have got it,\" rejoined Maximitch, putting his hand into his breast.\n\"I promised Palashka to give it to you.\"\n\nHe handed me a folded paper, and immediately darted off at full gallop.\nI opened it and read with emotion the following lines--\n\n\"It has pleased God to deprive me at once of my father and my mother. I\nhave no longer on earth either parents or protectors. I have recourse to\nyou, because I know you have always wished me well, and also that you\nare ever ready to help those in need. I pray God this letter may reach\nyou. Maximitch has promised me he will ensure it reaching you. Palashka\nhas also heard Maximitch say that he often sees you from afar in the\nsorties, and that you do not take care of yourself, nor think of those\nwho pray God for you with tears.\n\n\"I was long ill, and when at last I recovered, Alexey Iv\u00c3\u00a1nytch, who\ncommands here in the room of my late father, forced Father Garasim to\nhand me over to him by threatening him with Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f. I live under his\nguardianship in our house. Alexey Iv\u00c3\u00a1nytch tries to oblige me to marry\nhim. He avers that he saved my life by not exposing Akoulina\nPamphilovna's stratagem when she spoke of me to the robbers as her\nniece, but it would be easier to me to die than to become the wife of a\nman like Chvabrine. He treats me with great cruelty, and threatens, if I\ndo not change my mind, to bring me to the robber camp, where I should\nsuffer the fate of Elizabeth Kharloff.[62]\n\n\"I have begged Alexey Iv\u00c3\u00a1nytch to give me some time to think it over. He\nhas given me three days; if at the end of that time I do not become his\nwife I need expect no more consideration at his hands. Oh! my father,\nPetr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch, you are my only stay. Defend me, a poor girl. Beg the\nGeneral and all your superiors to send us help as soon as possible, and\ncome yourself if you can.\n\n\"I remain, your submissive orphan,\n\n\"MARYA MIRONOFF.\"\n\nI almost went mad when I read this letter. I rushed to the town,\nspurring without pity my poor horse. During the ride I turned over in my\nmind a thousand projects for rescuing the poor girl without being able\nto decide on any. Arrived in the town I went straight to the General's,\nand I actually ran into his room. He was walking up and down, smoking\nhis meerschaum pipe. Upon seeing me he stood still; my appearance\ndoubtless struck him, for he questioned me with a kind of anxiety on the\ncause of my abrupt entry.\n\n\"Your excellency,\" said I, \"I come to you as I would to my poor father.\nDo not reject my request; the happiness of my whole life is in\nquestion.\"\n\n\"What is all this, my father?\" asked the astounded General. \"What can I\ndo for you? Speak.\"\n\n\"Your excellency, allow me to take a battalion of soldiers and fifty\nCossacks, and go and clear out Fort B\u00c3\u00a9logorsk.\"\n\nThe General stared, thinking, probably, that I was out of my senses; and\nhe was not far wrong.\n\n\"How? What! what! Clear out Fort B\u00c3\u00a9logorsk!\" he said at last.\n\n\"I'll answer for success!\" I rejoined, hotly. \"Only let me go.\"\n\n\"No, young man,\" he said, shaking his head; \"it is so far away. The\nenemy would easily block all communication with the principal strategic\npoint, which would quickly enable him to defeat you utterly and\ndecisively. A blocked communication, do you see?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI took fright when I saw he was getting involved in a military\ndissertation, and I made haste to interrupt him.\n\n\"The daughter of Captain Mironoff,\" I said, \"has just written me a\nletter asking for help. Chvabrine is obliging her to become his wife.\"\n\n\"Indeed! Oh! this Chvabrine is a great rascal. If he falls into my hands\nI'll have him tried in twenty-four hours, and we will shoot him on the\nglacis of the fort. But in the meantime we must have patience.\"\n\n\"Have patience!\" I cried, beside myself. \"Between this and then he will\nill-treat Marya.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" replied the General. \"Still that would not be such a terrible\nmisfortune for her. It would be better for her to be the wife of\nChvabrine, who can now protect her. And when we shall have shot him,\nthen, with heaven's help, the betrothed will come together again. Pretty\nlittle widows do not long remain single; I mean to say a widow more\neasily finds a husband.\"\n\n\"I'd rather die,\" I cried, furiously, \"than leave her to Chvabrine.\"\n\n\"Ah! Bah!\" said the old man, \"I understand now. Probably you are in love\nwith Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna. Then it is another thing. Poor boy! But still it is\nnot possible for me to give you a battalion and fifty Cossacks. This\nexpedition is unreasonable, and I cannot take it upon my own\nresponsibility.\"\n\nI bowed my head; despair overwhelmed me. All at once an idea flashed\nacross me, and what it was the reader will see in the next chapter, as\nthe old novelists used to say.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nTHE REBEL CAMP.\n\n\nI left the General and made haste to return home.\n\nSav\u00c3\u00a9liitch greeted me with his usual remonstrances--\n\n\"What pleasure can you find, sir, in fighting with these drunken\nrobbers? Is it the business of a _'boy\u00c3\u00a1r_?' The stars are not always\npropitious, and you will only get killed for naught. Now if you were\nmaking war with Turks or Swedes! But I'm ashamed even to talk of these\nfellows with whom you are fighting.\"\n\nI interrupted his speech.\n\n\"How much money have I in all?\"\n\n\"Quite enough,\" replied he, with a complacent and satisfied air. \"It was\nall very well for the rascals to hunt everywhere, but I over-reached\nthem.\"\n\nThus saying he drew from his pocket a long knitted purse, all full of\nsilver pieces.\n\n\"Very well, Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch,\" said I. \"Give me half what you have there, and\nkeep the rest for yourself. I am about to start for Fort B\u00c3\u00a9logorsk.\"\n\n\"Oh! my father, Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch,\" cried my good follower, in a\ntremulous voice; \"do you not fear God? How do you mean to travel now\nthat all the roads be blocked by the robbers? At least, take pity on\nyour parents if you have none on yourself. Where do you wish to go?\nWherefore? Wait a bit, the troops will come and take all the robbers.\nThen you can go to the four winds.\"\n\nMy resolution was fixed.\n\n\"It is too late to reflect,\" I said to the old man. \"I must go; it is\nimpossible for me not to go. Do not make yourself wretched, Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch.\nGod is good; we shall perhaps meet again. Mind you be not ashamed to\nspend my money; do not be a miser. Buy all you have need of, even if you\npay three times the value of things. I make you a present of the money\nif in three days' time I be not back.\"\n\n\"What's that you're saying, sir?\" broke in Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch; \"that I shall\nconsent to let you go alone? Why, don't dream of asking me to do so. If\nyou have resolved to go I will e'en go along with you, were it on foot;\nbut I will not forsake you. That I should stay snugly behind a stone\nwall! Why, I should be mad! Do as you please, sir, but I do not leave\nyou.\"\n\nI well knew it was not possible to contradict Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch, and I allowed\nhim to make ready for our departure.\n\nIn half-an-hour I was in the saddle on my horse, and Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch on a\nthin and lame \"_garron_,\" which a townsman had given him for nothing,\nhaving no longer anything wherewith to feed it. We gained the town\ngates; the sentries let us pass, and at last we were out of Orenburg.\n\nNight was beginning to fall. The road I had to follow passed before the\nlittle village of Berd, held by Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f. This road was deep in snow,\nand nearly hidden; but across the steppe were to be seen tracks of\nhorses each day renewed.\n\nI was trotting. Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch could hardly keep up with me, and cried to me\nevery minute--\n\n\"Not so fast, sir, in heaven's name not so fast! My confounded\n'_garron_' cannot catch up your long-legged devil. Why are you in such a\nhurry? Are we bound to a feast? Rather have we our necks under the axe.\nPetr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch! Oh! my father, Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch! Oh, Lord! this\n'_boy\u00c3\u00a1r's_' child will die, and all for nothing!\"\n\nWe soon saw twinkling the fires of Berd. We were approaching the deep\nravines which served as natural fortifications to the little settlement.\nSav\u00c3\u00a9liitch, though keeping up to me tolerably well, did not give over\nhis lamentable supplications. I was hoping to pass safely by this\nunfriendly place, when all at once I made out in the dark five peasants,\narmed with big sticks.\n\nIt was an advance guard of Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f's camp. They shouted to us--\n\n\"Who goes there?\"\n\nNot knowing the pass-word, I wanted to pass them without reply, but in\nthe same moment they surrounded me, and one of them seized my horse by\nthe bridle. I drew my sword, and struck the peasant on the head. His\nhigh cap saved his life; still, he staggered, and let go the bridle. The\nothers were frightened, and jumped aside. Taking advantage of their\nscare, I put spurs to my horse, and dashed off at full gallop.\n\nThe fast increasing darkness of the night might have saved me from any\nmore difficulties, when, looking back, I discovered that Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch was\nno longer with me. The poor old man with his lame horse had not been\nable to shake off the robbers. What was I to do?\n\nAfter waiting a few minutes and becoming certain he had been stopped, I\nturned my horse's head to go to his help. As I approached the ravine I\nheard from afar confused shouts, and the voice of my Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch.\nQuickening my pace, I soon came up with the peasants of the advance\nguard who had stopped me a few minutes previously. They had surrounded\nSav\u00c3\u00a9liitch, and had obliged the poor old man to get off his horse, and\nwere making ready to bind him.\n\nThe sight of me filled them with joy. They rushed upon me with shouts,\nand in a moment I was off my horse. One of them, who appeared to be the\nleader, told me they were going to take me before the Tzar.\n\n\"And our father,\" added he, \"will decide whether you are to be hung at\nonce or if we are to wait for God's sunshine!\"\n\nI offered no resistance. Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch followed my example, and the\nsentries led us away in triumph.\n\nWe crossed the ravine to enter the settlement. All the peasants' houses\nwere lit up. All around arose shouts and noise. I met a crowd of people\nin the street, but no one paid any attention to us, or recognized in me\nan officer of Orenburg. We were taken to a \"_izb\u00c3\u00a1_,\" built in the angle\nof two streets. Near the door were several barrels of wine and two\ncannons.\n\n\"Here is the palace!\" said one of the peasants; \"we will go and announce\nyou.\"\n\nHe entered the \"_izb\u00c3\u00a1_.\" I glanced at Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch; the old man was making\nthe sign of the cross, and muttering prayers. We waited a long time. At\nlast the peasant reappeared, and said to me--\n\n\"Come, our father has given orders that the officer be brought in.\"\n\nI entered the \"_izb\u00c3\u00a1_,\" or the palace, as the peasant called it. It was\nlighted by two tallow candles, and the walls were hung with gold paper.\nAll the rest of the furniture, the benches, the table, the little\nwashstand jug hung to a cord, the towel on a nail, the oven fork\nstanding up in a corner, the wooden shelf laden with earthen pots, all\nwas just as in any other \"_izb\u00c3\u00a1_. Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f sat beneath the holy\npictures in a red caftan and high cap, his hand on his thigh. Around\nhim stood several of his principal chiefs, with a forced expression of\nsubmission and respect. It was easy to see that the news of the arrival\nof an officer from Orenburg had aroused a great curiosity among the\nrebels, and that they were prepared to receive me in pomp. Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f\nrecognized me at the first glance. His feigned gravity disappeared at\nonce.\n\n\"Ah! it is your lordship,\" said he, with liveliness. \"How are you? What\nin heaven's name brings you here?\"\n\nI replied that I had started on a journey on my own business, and that\nhis people had stopped me.\n\n\"And on what business?\" asked he.\n\nI knew not what to say. Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f, thinking I did not want to explain\nmyself before witnesses, made a sign to his comrades to go away. All\nobeyed except two, who did not offer to stir.\n\n\"Speak boldly before these,\" said Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f; \"hide nothing from them.\"\n\nI threw a side glance upon these two confederates of the usurper. One of\nthem, a little old man, meagre and bent, with a scanty grey beard, had\nnothing remarkable about him, except a broad blue ribbon worn cross-ways\nover his caftan of thick grey cloth. But I shall never forget his\ncompanion. He was tall, powerfully built, and appeared to be about\nforty-five. A thick red beard, piercing grey eyes, a nose without\nnostrils, and marks of the hot iron on his forehead and on his cheeks,\ngave to his broad face, seamed with small-pox, a strange and indefinable\nexpression. He wore a red shirt, a Kirghiz dress, and wide Cossack\ntrousers. The first, as I afterwards learnt, was the deserter, Corporal\nB\u00c3\u00a9loborodoff. The other, Athanasius Sokoloff, nicknamed Khlop\u00c3\u00basha,[63]\nwas a criminal condemned to the mines of Siberia, whence he had escaped\nthree times. In spite of the feelings which then agitated me, this\ncompany wherein I was thus unexpectedly thrown greatly impressed me. But\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f soon recalled me to myself by his question.\n\n\"Speak! On what business did you leave Orenburg?\"\n\nA strange idea occurred to me. It seemed to me that Providence, in\nbringing me a second time before Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f, opened to me a way of\nexecuting my project. I resolved to seize the opportunity, and, without\nconsidering any longer what course I should pursue, I replied to\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f--\n\n\"I was going to Fort B\u00c3\u00a9logorsk, to deliver there an orphan who is being\noppressed.\"\n\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f's eyes flashed.\n\n\"Who among my people would dare to harm an orphan?\" cried he. \"Were he\never so brazen-faced, he should never escape my vengeance! Speak, who\nis the guilty one?\"\n\n\"Chvabrine,\" replied I; \"he keeps in durance the same young girl whom\nyou saw with the priest's wife, and he wants to force her to become his\nwife.\"\n\n\"I'll give him a lesson, Master Chvabrine!\" cried Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f, with a\nfierce air. \"He shall learn what it is to do as he pleases under me, and\nto oppress my people. I'll hang him.\"\n\n\"Bid me speak a word,\" broke in Khlop\u00c3\u00basha, in a hoarse voice. \"You were\ntoo hasty in giving Chvabrine command of the fort, and now you are too\nhasty in hanging him. You have already offended the Cossacks by giving\nthem a gentleman as leader--do not, therefore, now affront the gentlemen\nby executing them on the first accusation.\"\n\n\"They need neither be overwhelmed with favours nor be pitied,\" the\nlittle old man with the blue ribbon now said, in his turn. \"There would\nbe no harm in hanging Chvabrine, neither would there be any harm in\ncross-examining this officer. Why has he deigned to pay us a visit? If\nhe do not recognize you as Tzar, he needs not to ask justice of you; if,\non the other hand, he do recognize you, wherefore, then, has he stayed\nin Orenburg until now, in the midst of your enemies. Will you order that\nhe be tried by fire?[64] It would appear that his lordship is sent to us\nby the Generals in Orenburg.\"\n\nThe logic of the old rascal appeared plausible even to me. An\ninvoluntary shudder thrilled through me as I remembered in whose hands I\nwas.\n\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f saw my disquiet.\n\n\"Eh, eh! your lordship,\" said he, winking, \"it appears to me my\nfield-marshal is right. What do you think of it?\"\n\nThe banter of Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f in some measure restored me to myself.\n\nI quietly replied that I was in his power, and that he could do with me\nas he listed.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f; \"now tell me in what state is your town?\"\n\n\"Thank God,\" replied I, \"all is in good order.\"\n\n\"In good order!\" repeated Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f, \"and the people are dying of hunger\nthere.\"\n\nThe usurper spoke truth; but, according to the duty imposed on me by my\noath, I assured him it was a false report, and that Orenburg was amply\nvictualled.\n\n\"You see,\" cried the little old man, \"that he is deceiving you. All the\ndeserters are unanimous in declaring famine and plague are in Orenburg,\nthat they are eating carrion there as a dish of honour. And his lordship\nassures us there is abundance of all. If you wish to hang Chvabrine,\nhang on the same gallows this lad, so that they need have naught\nwherewith to reproach each other.\"\n\nThe words of the confounded old man seemed to have shaken Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f.\n\nHappily, Khlop\u00c3\u00basha began to contradict his companion.\n\n\"Hold your tongue, Na\u00c3\u00bamitch,\" said he; \"you only think of hanging and\nstrangling. It certainly suits you well to play the hero. Already you\nhave one foot in the grave, and you want to kill others. Have you not\nenough blood on your conscience?\"\n\n\"But are you a saint yourself?\" retorted B\u00c3\u00a9loborodoff. \"Wherefore, then,\nthis pity?\"\n\n\"Without doubt,\" replied Khlop\u00c3\u00basha, \"I am also a sinner, and this hand\"\n(he closed his bony fist, and turning back his sleeve displayed his\nhairy arm), \"and this hand is guilty of having shed Christian blood. But\n_I_ killed my enemy, and not my host, on the free highway and in the\ndark wood, but not in the house, and behind the stove with axe and club,\nneither with old women's gossip.\"\n\nThe old man averted his head, and muttered between his teeth--\n\n\"Branded!\"\n\n\"What are you muttering there, old owl?\" rejoined Khlop\u00c3\u00basha. \"I'll brand\nyou! Wait a bit, your turn will come. By heaven, I hope some day you may\nsmell the hot pincers, and till then have a care that I do not tear out\nyour ugly beard.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f, with dignity, \"stop quarrelling. It would\nnot be a great misfortune if all the mangy curs of Orenburg dangled\ntheir legs beneath the same cross-bar, but it would be a pity if our\ngood dogs took to biting each other.\"\n\nKhlop\u00c3\u00basha and B\u00c3\u00a9loborodoff said nothing, and exchanged black looks.\n\nI felt it was necessary to change the subject of the interview, which\nmight end in a very disagreeable manner for me. Turning toward\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f, I said to him, smiling--\n\n\"Ah! I had forgotten to thank you for your horse and '_touloup_.' Had it\nnot been for you, I should never have reached the town, for I should\nhave died of cold on the journey.\"\n\nMy stratagem succeeded. Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f became good-humoured.\n\n\"The beauty of a debt is the payment!\" said he, with his usual wink.\n\"Now, tell me the whole story. What have you to do with this young girl\nwhom Chvabrine is persecuting? Has she not hooked your young\naffections, eh?\"\n\n\"She is my betrothed,\" I replied, as I observed the favourable change\ntaking place in Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f, and seeing no risk in telling him the truth.\n\n\"Your betrothed!\" cried Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f. \"Why didn't you tell me before? We\nwill marry you, and have a fine junket at your wedding.\" Then, turning\nto B\u00c3\u00a9loborodoff, \"Listen, field-marshal,\" said he, \"we are old friends,\nhis lordship and me; let us sit down to supper. To-morrow we will see\nwhat is to be done with him; one's brains are clearer in the morning\nthan by night.\"\n\nI should willingly have refused the proposed honour, but I could not get\nout of it. Two young Cossack girls, children of the master of the\n\"_izb\u00c3\u00a1_,\" laid the table with a white cloth, brought bread, fish, soup,\nand big jugs of wine and beer.\n\nThus for the second time I found myself at the table of Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f and\nhis terrible companions. The orgy of which I became the involuntary\nwitness went on till far into the night.\n\nAt last drunkenness overcame the guests; Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f fell asleep in his\nplace, and his companions rose, making me a sign to leave him.\n\nI went out with them. By the order of Khlop\u00c3\u00basha the sentry took me to\nthe lockup, where I found Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch, and I was left alone with him\nunder lock and key.\n\nMy retainer was so astounded by the turn affairs had taken that he did\nnot address a single question to me. He lay down in the dark, and for a\nlong while I heard him moan and lament. At last, however, he began to\nsnore, and as for me, I gave myself up to thoughts which did not allow\nme to close my eyes for a moment all night.\n\nOn the morrow morning Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f sent someone to call me.\n\nI went to his house. Before his door stood a \"_kibitka_\" with three\nTartar horses. The crowd filled the street. Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f, whom I met in the\nante-room, was dressed in a travelling suit, a pelisse and Kirghiz cap.\nHis guests of yesterday evening surrounded him, and wore a submissive\nair, which contrasted strongly with what I had witnessed the previous\nevening.\n\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f gaily bid me \"good morning,\" and ordered me to seat myself\nbeside him in the \"_kibitka_.\" We took our places.\n\n\"To Fort B\u00c3\u00a9logorsk!\" said Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f to the robust Tartar driver, who\nstanding guided the team. My heart beat violently.\n\nThe horses dashed forward, the little bell tinkled, the \"_kibitka_,\"\nbounded across the snow.\n\n\"Stop! stop!\" cried a voice which I knew but too well; and I saw\nSav\u00c3\u00a9liitch running towards us. Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f bid the man stop.\n\n\"Oh! my father, Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch,\" cried my follower, \"don't forsake me\nin my old age among the rob--\"\n\n\"Aha! old owl!\" said Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f, \"so God again brings us together. Here,\nseat yourself in front.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Tzar, thanks my own father,\" replied Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch, taking his\nseat. \"May God give you a hundred years of life for having reassured a\npoor old man. I shall pray God all my life for you, and I'll never talk\nabout the hareskin '_touloup_.'\"\n\nThis hareskin \"_touloup_\" might end at last by making Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f\nseriously angry. But the usurper either did not hear or pretended not to\nhear this ill-judged remark. The horses again galloped.\n\nThe people stopped in the street, and each one saluted us, bowing low.\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f bent his head right and left.\n\nIn a moment we were out of the village and were taking our course over\na well-marked road. What I felt may be easily imagined. In a few hours I\nshould see again her whom I had thought lost to me for ever. I imagined\nto myself the moment of our reunion, but I also thought of the man in\nwhose hands lay my destiny, and whom a strange concourse of events bound\nto me by a mysterious link.\n\nI recalled the rough cruelty and bloody habits of him who was disposed\nto prove the defender of my love. Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f did not know she was the\ndaughter of Captain Mironoff; Chvabrine, driven to bay, was capable of\ntelling him all, and Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f might learn the truth in other ways.\nThen, what would become of Marya? At this thought a shudder ran through\nmy body, and my hair seemed to stand on end.\n\nAll at once Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f broke upon my reflections.\n\n\"What does your lordship,\" said he, \"deign to think about?\"\n\n\"How can you expect me to be thinking?\" replied I. \"I am an officer and\na gentleman; but yesterday I was waging war with you, and now I am\ntravelling with you in the same carriage, and the whole happiness of my\nlife depends on you.\"\n\n\"What,\" said Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f, \"are you afraid?\"\n\nI made reply that having already received my life at his hands, I\ntrusted not merely in his good nature but in his help.\n\n\"And you are right--'fore God, you are right,\" resumed the usurper; \"you\nsaw that my merry men looked askance at you. Even to-day the little old\nman wanted to prove indubitably to me that you were a spy, and should be\nput to the torture and hung. But I would not agree,\" added he, lowering\nhis voice, lest Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch and the Tartar should hear him, \"because I\nbore in mind your glass of wine and your '_touloup_.' You see clearly\nthat I am not bloodthirsty, as your comrades would make out.\"\n\nRemembering the taking of Fort B\u00c3\u00a9logorsk, I did not think wise to\ncontradict him, and I said nothing.\n\n\"What do they say of me in Orenburg?\" asked Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f, after a short\nsilence.\n\n\"Well, it is said that you are not easy to get the better of. You will\nagree we have had our hands full with you.\"\n\nThe face of the usurper expressed the satisfaction of self-love.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, with a glorious air, \"I am a great warrior. Do they know\nin Orenburg of the battle of Jouze\u00c3\u00afff?[65] Forty Generals were killed,\nfour armies made prisoners. Do you think the King of Prussia is about my\nstrength?\"\n\nThis boasting of the robber rather amused me.\n\n\"What do you think yourself?\" I said to him. \"Could you beat Frederick?\"\n\n\"F\u00c3\u00a9dor F\u00c3\u00a9dorovitch,[66] eh! why not? I can beat your Generals, and your\nGenerals have beaten him. Until now my arms have been victorious. Wait a\nbit--only wait a bit--you'll see something when I shall march on\nMoscow?\"\n\n\"And you are thinking of marching on Moscow?\"\n\nThe usurper appeared to reflect. Then he said, half-aloud--\n\n\"God knows my way is straight. I have little freedom of action. My\nfellows don't obey me--they are marauders. I have to keep a sharp look\nout--at the first reverse they would save their necks with my head.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said to Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f, \"would it not be better to forsake them\nyourself, ere it be too late, and throw yourself on the mercy of the\nTzarina?\"\n\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f smiled bitterly.\n\n\"No,\" said he, \"the day of repentance is past and gone; they will not\ngive me grace. I must go on as I have begun. Who knows? It may be.\nGrischka Otr\u00c3\u00a9pieff certainly became Tzar at Moscow.\"\n\n\"But do you know his end? He was cast out of a window, he was massacred,\nburnt, and his ashes blown abroad at the cannon's mouth, to the four\nwinds of heaven.\"\n\nThe Tartar began to hum a plaintive song; Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch, fast asleep,\noscillated from one side to the other. Our \"_kibitka_\" was passing\nquickly over the wintry road. All at once I saw a little village I knew\nwell, with a palisade and a belfry, on the rugged bank of the Ya\u00c3\u00afk. A\nquarter of an hour afterwards we were entering Fort B\u00c3\u00a9logorsk.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nTHE ORPHAN.\n\n\nThe \"_kibitka\"_ stopped before the door of the Commandant's house. The\ninhabitants had recognized the little bell of Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f's team, and had\nassembled in a crowd. Chvabrine came to meet the usurper; he was dressed\nas a Cossack, and had allowed his beard to grow.\n\nThe traitor helped Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f to get out of the carriage, expressing by\nobsequious words his zeal and joy.\n\nSeeing me he became uneasy, but soon recovered himself.\n\n\"You are one of us,\" said he; \"it should have been long ago.\"\n\nI turned away my head without answering him. My heart failed me when we\nentered the little room I knew so well, where could still be seen on the\nwall the commission of the late deceased Commandant, as a sad memorial.\n\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f sat down on the same sofa where ofttimes Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Kouzmitch had\ndozed to the sound of his wife's scolding.\n\nChvabrine himself brought brandy to his chief. Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f drank a glass\nof it, and said to him, pointing to me--\n\n\"Offer one to his lordship.\"\n\nChvabrine approached me with his tray. I turned away my head for the\nsecond time. He seemed beside himself. With his usual sharpness he had\ndoubtless guessed that Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f was not pleased with me. He regarded\nhim with alarm and me with mistrust. Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f asked him some questions\non the condition of the fort, on what was said concerning the Tzarina's\ntroops, and other similar subjects. Then suddenly and in an unexpected\nmanner--\n\n\"Tell me, brother,\" asked he, \"who is this young girl you are keeping\nunder watch and ward? Show me her.\"\n\nChvabrine became pale as death.\n\n\"Tzar,\" he said, in a trembling voice, \"Tzar, she is not under\nrestraint; she is in bed in her room.\"\n\n\"Take me to her,\" said the usurper, rising.\n\nIt was impossible to hesitate. Chvabrine led Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f to Marya\nIv\u00c3\u00a1nofna's room. I followed them. Chvabrine stopped on the stairs.\n\n\"Tzar,\" said he, \"you can constrain me to do as you list, but do not\npermit a stranger to enter my wife's room.\"\n\n\"You are married!\" cried I, ready to tear him in pieces.\n\n\"Hush!\" interrupted Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f, \"it is my concern. And you,\" continued\nhe, turning towards Chvabrine, \"do not swagger; whether she be your wife\nor no, I take whomsoever I please to see her. Your lordship, follow me.\"\n\nAt the door of the room Chvabrine again stopped, and said, in a broken\nvoice--\n\n\"Tzar, I warn you she is feverish, and for three days she has been\ndelirious.\"\n\n\"Open!\" said Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f.\n\nChvabrine began to fumble in his pockets, and ended by declaring he had\nforgotten the key.\n\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f gave a push to the door with his foot, the lock gave way, the\ndoor opened, and we went in. I cast a rapid glance round the room and\nnearly fainted. Upon the floor, in a coarse peasant's dress, sat Marya,\npale and thin, with her hair unbound. Before her stood a jug of water\nand a bit of bread. At the sight of me she trembled and gave a piercing\ncry. I cannot say what I felt. Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f looked sidelong at Chvabrine,\nand said to him with a bitter smile--\n\n\"Your hospital is well-ordered!\" Then, approaching Marya, \"Tell me, my\nlittle dove, why your husband punishes you thus?\"\n\n\"My husband!\" rejoined she; \"he is not my husband. Never will I be his\nwife. I am resolved rather to die, and I shall die if I be not\ndelivered.\"\n\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f cast a furious glance upon Chvabrine.\n\n\"You dared deceive me,\" cried he. \"Do you know, villain, what you\ndeserve?\"\n\nChvabrine dropped on his knees. Then contempt overpowered in me all\nfeelings of hatred and revenge. I looked with disgust upon a gentleman\nat the feet of a Cossack deserter. Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f allowed himself to be\nmoved.\n\n\"I pardon you this time,\" he said, to Chvabrine; \"but next offence I\nwill remember this one.\" Then, addressing Marya, he said to her, gently,\n\"Come out, pretty one; I give you your liberty. I am the Tzar.\"\n\nMarya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna threw a quick look at him, and divined that the murderer\nof her parents was before her eyes. She covered her face with her hands,\nand fell unconscious.\n\nI was rushing to help her, when my old acquaintance, Polashka, came very\nboldly into the room, and took charge of her mistress.\n\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f withdrew, and we all three returned to the parlour.\n\n\"Well, your lordship,\" Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f said to me, laughing, \"we have\ndelivered the pretty girl; what do you say to it? Ought we not to send\nfor the pope and get him to marry his niece? If you like I will be your\n_marriage godfather_, Chvabrine best man; then we will set to and drink\nwith closed doors.\"\n\nWhat I feared came to pass.\n\nNo sooner had he heard Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f's proposal than Chvabrine lost his\nhead.\n\n\"Tzar,\" said he, furiously, \"I am guilty, I have lied to you; but\nGrineff also deceives you. This young girl is not the pope's niece; she\nis the daughter of Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Mironoff, who was executed when the fort was\ntaken.\"\n\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f turned his flashing eyes on me.\n\n\"What does all this mean?\" cried he, with indignant surprise.\n\nBut I made answer boldly--\n\n\"Chvabrine has told you the truth.\"\n\n\"You had not told me that,\" rejoined Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f, whose brow had suddenly\ndarkened.\n\n\"But judge yourself,\" replied I; \"could I declare before all your\npeople that she was Mironoff's daughter? They would have torn her in\npieces, nothing could have saved her.\"\n\n\"Well, you are right,\" said Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f. \"My drunkards would not have\nspared the poor girl; my gossip, the pope's wife, did right to deceive\nthem.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" I resumed, seeing how well disposed he was towards me, \"I do\nnot know what to call you, nor do I seek to know. But God knows I stand\nready to give my life for what you have done for me. Only do not ask of\nme anything opposed to my honour and my conscience as a Christian. You\nare my benefactor; end as you have begun. Let me go with the poor orphan\nwhither God shall direct, and whatever befall and wherever you be we\nwill pray God every day that He watch over the safety of your soul.\"\n\nI seemed to have touched Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f's fierce heart.\n\n\"Be it even as you wish,\" said he. \"Either entirely punish or entirely\npardon; that is my motto. Take your pretty one, take her away wherever\nyou like, and may God grant you love and wisdom.\"\n\nHe turned towards Chvabrine, and bid him write me a safe conduct pass\nfor all the gates and forts under his command. Chvabrine remained still,\nand as if petrified.\n\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f went to inspect the fort; Chvabrine followed him, and I stayed\nbehind under the pretext of packing up. I ran to Marya's room. The door\nwas shut; I knocked.\n\n\"Who is there?\" asked Polashka.\n\nI gave my name. Marya's gentle voice was then heard through the door.\n\n\"Wait, Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch,\" said she, \"I am changing my dress. Go to\nAkoulina Pamphilovna's; I shall be there in a minute.\"\n\nI obeyed and went to Father Garasim's house.\n\nThe pope and his wife hastened to meet me. Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch had already told\nthem all that had happened.\n\n\"Good-day, Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch,\" the pope's wife said to me; \"here has God\nso ruled that we meet again. How are you? We have talked about you every\nday. And Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna, what has she not suffered anent you, my pigeon?\nBut tell me, my father, how did you get out of the difficulty with\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f? How was it that he did not kill you? Well, for _that_, thanks\nbe to the villain.\"\n\n\"There, hush, old woman,\" interrupted Father Garasim; \"don't gossip\nabout all you know; too much talk, no salvation. Come in, Petr'\nAndr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch, and welcome. It is long since we have seen each other.\"\n\nThe pope's wife did me honour with everything she had at hand, without\nceasing a moment to talk.\n\nShe told me how Chvabrine had obliged them to deliver up Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna\nto him; how the poor girl cried, and would not be parted from them; how\nshe had had continual intercourse with them through the medium of\nPolashka, a resolute, sharp girl who made the _\"ouriadnik\"_ himself\ndance (as they say) to the sound of her flageolet; how she had\ncounselled Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna to write me a letter, etc. As for me, in a few\nwords I told my story.\n\nThe pope and his wife crossed themselves when they heard that Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f\nwas aware they had deceived him.\n\n\"May the power of the cross be with us!\" Akoulina Pamphilovna said. \"May\nGod turn aside this cloud. Very well, Alexey Iv\u00c3\u00a1nytch, we shall see! Oh!\nthe sly fox!\"\n\nAt this moment the door opened, and Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna appeared, with a\nsmile on her pale face. She had changed her peasant dress, and was\ndressed as usual, simply and suitably. I seized her hand, and could not\nfor a while say a single word. We were both silent, our hearts were too\nfull.\n\nOur hosts felt we had other things to do than to talk to them; they left\nus. We remained alone. Marya told me all that had befallen her since the\ntaking of the fort; painted me the horrors of her position, all the\ntorment the infamous Chvabrine had made her suffer. We recalled to each\nother the happy past, both of us shedding tears the while.\n\nAt last I could tell her my plans. It was impossible for her to stay in\na fort which had submitted to Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f, and where Chvabrine was in\ncommand. Neither could I dream of taking refuge with her in Orenburg,\nwhere at this juncture all the miseries of a siege were being undergone.\nMarya had no longer a single relation in the world. Therefore I proposed\nto her that she should go to my parents' country house.\n\nShe was very much surprised at such a proposal. The displeasure my\nfather had shown on her account frightened her. But I soothed her. I\nknew my father would deem it a duty and an honour to shelter in his\nhouse the daughter of a veteran who had died for his country.\n\n\"Dear Marya,\" I said, at last, \"I look upon you as my wife. These\nstrange events have irrevocably united us. Nothing in the whole world\ncan part us any more.\"\n\nMarya heard me in dignified silence, without misplaced affectation. She\nfelt as I did, that her destiny was irrevocably linked with mine; still,\nshe repeated that she would only be my wife with my parents' consent. I\nhad nothing to answer. We fell in each other's arms, and my project\nbecame our mutual decision.\n\nAn hour afterwards the \"_ouriadnik_\" brought me my safe-conduct pass,\nwith the scrawl which did duty as Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f's signature, and told me the\nTzar awaited me in his house.\n\nI found him ready to start.\n\nHow express what I felt in the presence of this man, awful and cruel for\nall, myself only excepted? And why not tell the whole truth? At this\nmoment I felt a strong sympathy with him. I wished earnestly to draw him\nfrom the band of robbers of which he was the chief, and save his head\nere it should be too late.\n\nThe presence of Chvabrine and of the crowd around us prevented me from\nexpressing to him all the feelings which filled my heart.\n\nWe parted friends.\n\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f saw in the crowd Akoulina Pamphilovna, and amicably threatened\nher with his finger, with a meaning wink. Then he seated himself in his\n_\"kibitka\"_ and gave the word to return to Berd. When the horses\nstarted, he leaned out of his carriage and shouted to me--\n\n\"Farewell, your lordship; it may be we shall yet meet again!\"\n\nWe did, indeed, see one another once again; but under what\ncircumstances!\n\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f was gone.\n\nI long watched the steppe over which his _\"kibitka\"_ was rapidly\ngliding.\n\nThe crowd dwindled away; Chvabrine disappeared. I went back to the\npope's house, where all was being made ready for our departure. Our\nlittle luggage had been put in the old vehicle of the Commandant. In a\nmoment the horses were harnessed.\n\nMarya went to bid a last farewell to the tomb of her parents, buried\nbehind the church.\n\nI wished to escort her there, but she begged me to let her go alone, and\nsoon came back, weeping quiet tears.\n\nFather Garasim and his wife came to the door to see us off. We took our\nseats, three abreast, inside the \"_kibitka_,\" and Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch again\nperched in front.\n\n\"Good-bye, Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna, our dear dove; good-bye, Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch,\nour gay goshawk!\" the pope's wife cried to us. \"A lucky journey to you,\nand may God give you abundant happiness!\"\n\nWe started. At the Commandant's window I saw Chvabrine standing, with a\nface of dark hatred.\n\nI did not wish to triumph meanly over a humbled enemy, and looked away\nfrom him.\n\nAt last we passed the principal gate, and for ever left Fort B\u00c3\u00a9logorsk.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nTHE ARREST.\n\n\nReunited in so marvellous a manner to the young girl who, that very\nmorning even, had caused me so much unhappy disquiet, I could not\nbelieve in my happiness, and I deemed all that had befallen me a dream.\n\nMarya looked sometimes thoughtfully upon me and sometimes upon the road,\nand did not seem either to have recovered her senses. We kept\nsilence--our hearts were too weary with emotion.\n\nAt the end of two hours we had already reached the neighbouring fort,\nwhich also belonged to Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f. We changed horses there.\n\nBy the alertness with which we were served and the eager zeal of the\nbearded Cossack whom Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f had appointed Commandant, I saw that,\nthanks to the talk of the postillion who had driven us, I was taken for\na favourite of the master.\n\nWhen we again set forth it was getting dark. We were approaching a\nlittle town where, according to the bearded Commandant, there ought to\nbe a strong detachment on the march to join the usurper.\n\nThe sentries stopped us, and to the shout, \"Who goes there?\" our\npostillion replied aloud--\n\n\"The Tzar's gossip, travelling with his good woman.\"\n\nImmediately a party of Russian hussars surrounded us with awful oaths.\n\n\"Get out, devil's gossip!\" a Quartermaster with thick moustachios said\nto me.\n\n\"We'll give you a bath, you and your good woman!\"\n\nI got out of the \"_kibitka_,\" and asked to be taken before the\nauthorities.\n\nSeeing I was an officer, the men ceased swearing, and the Quartermaster\ntook me to the Major's.\n\nSav\u00c3\u00a9liitch followed me, grumbling--\n\n\"That's fun--gossip of the Tzar!--out of the frying-pan into the fire!\nOh, Lord! how will it all end?\"\n\nThe \"_kibitka_\" followed at a walk. In five minutes we reached a little\nhouse, brilliantly lit up. The Quartermaster left me under the guard,\nand went in to announce his capture.\n\nHe returned almost directly, and told me \"his high mightiness,\"[67] had\nnot time to see me, and that he had bid me be taken to prison, and that\nmy good woman be brought before him.\n\n\"What does it all mean?\" I cried, furiously; \"is he gone mad?\"\n\n\"I cannot say, your lordship,\" replied the Quartermaster, \"only his high\nmightiness has given orders that your lordship be taken to prison, and\nthat her ladyship be taken before his high mightiness, your lordship.\"\n\nI ran up the steps. The sentries had not time to stop me, and I entered\nstraightway the room, where six hussar officers were playing\n\"_faro_.\"[68]\n\nThe Major held the bank.\n\nWhat was my surprise when, in a momentary glance at him, I recognized in\nhim that very Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Iv\u00c3\u00a1novitch Zourine who had so well fleeced me in the\nSimbirsk inn!\n\n\"Is it possible?\" cried I. \"Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Iv\u00c3\u00a1novitch, is it you?\"\n\n\"Ah, bah! Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch! By what chance, and where do you drop from?\nGood day, brother, won't you punt a card?\"\n\n\"Thanks--rather give me a lodging.\"\n\n\"What, lodging do you want? Stay with me.\"\n\n\"I cannot. I am not alone.\"\n\n\"Well, bring your comrade too.\"\n\n\"I am not with a comrade. I am--with a lady.\"\n\n\"With a lady--where did you pick her up, brother?\"\n\nAfter saying which words Zourine began to whistle so slyly that all the\nothers began to laugh, and I remained confused.\n\n\"Well,\" continued Zourine, \"then there is nothing to be done. I'll give\nyou a lodging. But it is a pity; we would have had a spree like last\ntime. Hullo! there, boy, why is not Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f's gossip brought up? Is\nshe refractory? Tell her she has nothing to fear, that the gentleman\nwho wants her is very good, that he will not offend her in any way, and\nat the same time shove her along by the shoulder.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" I said to Zourine; \"of what gossip of\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f's are you speaking? It is the daughter of Captain Mironoff. I\nhave delivered her from captivity, and I am taking her now to my\nfather's house, where I shall leave her.\"\n\n\"What? So it's you whom they came to announce a while ago? In heaven's\nname, what does all this mean?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you all about it presently. But now I beg of you, do reassure\nthe poor girl, whom your hussars have frightened dreadfully.\"\n\nZourine directly settled matters. He went out himself into the street to\nmake excuses to Marya for the involuntary misunderstanding, and ordered\nthe Quartermaster to take her to the best lodging in the town. I stayed\nto sleep at Zourine's house. We supped together, and as soon as I found\nmyself alone with Zourine, I told him all my adventures.\n\nHe heard me with great attention, and when I had done, shaking his\nhead--\n\n\"All that's very well, brother,\" said he, \"but one thing is not well.\nWhy the devil do you want to marry? As an honest officer, as a good\nfellow, I would not deceive you. Believe me, I implore you, marriage is\nbut a folly. Is it wise of you to bother yourself with a wife and rock\nbabies? Give up the idea. Listen to me; part with the Commandant's\ndaughter. I have cleared and made safe the road to Simbirsk; send her\nto-morrow to your parents alone, and you stay in my detachment. If you\nfall again into the hands of the rebels it will not be easy for you to\nget off another time. In this way, your love fit will cure itself, and\nall will be for the best.\"\n\nThough I did not completely agree with him, I yet felt that duty and\nhonour alike required my presence in the Tzarina's army; so I resolved\nto follow in part Zourine's advice, and send Marya to my parents, and\nstay in his troop.\n\nSav\u00c3\u00a9liitch came to help me to undress. I told him he would have to be\nready to start on the morrow with Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna. He began by showing\nobstinacy.\n\n\"What are you saying, sir? How can you expect me to leave you? Who will\nserve you, and what will your parents say?\"\n\nKnowing the obstinacy of my retainer, I resolved to meet him with\nsincerity and coaxing.\n\n\"My friend, Arkhip Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch,\" I said to him, \"do not refuse me. Be my\nbenefactor. Here I have no need of a servant, and I should not be easy\nif Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna were to go without you. In serving her you serve me,\nfor I have made up my mind to marry her without fail directly\ncircumstances will permit.\"\n\nSav\u00c3\u00a9liitch clasped his hands with a look of surprise and stupefaction\nimpossible to describe.\n\n\"Marry!\" repeated he, \"the child wants to marry. But what will your\nfather say? And your mother, what will she think?\"\n\n\"They will doubtless consent,\" replied I, \"when they know Marya\nIv\u00c3\u00a1nofna. I count on you. My father and mother have full confidence in\nyou. You will intercede for us, won't you?\"\n\nThe old fellow was touched.\n\n\"Oh! my father, Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch,\" said he, \"although you do want to\nmarry too early, still Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna is such a good young lady it would\nbe a sin to let slip so good a chance. I will do as you wish. I will\ntake her, this angel of God, and I will tell your parents, with all due\ndeference, that such a betrothal needs no dowry.\"\n\nI thanked Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch, and went away to share Zourine's room.\n\nIn my emotion I again began to talk. At first Zourine willingly\nlistened, then his words became fewer and more vague, and at last he\nreplied to one of my questions by a vigorous snore, and I then followed\nhis example.\n\nOn the morrow, when I told Marya my plans, she saw how reasonable they\nwere, and agreed to them.\n\nAs Zourine's detachment was to leave the town that same day, and it was\nno longer possible to hesitate, I parted with Marya after entrusting her\nto Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch, and giving him a letter for my parents. Marya bid me\ngood-bye all forlorn; I could answer her nothing, not wishing to give\nway to the feelings of my heart before the bystanders.\n\nI returned to Zourine's silent and thoughtful; he wished to cheer me. I\nhoped to raise my spirits; we passed the day noisily, and on the morrow\nwe marched.\n\nIt was near the end of the month of February. The winter, which had\nrendered manoeuvres difficult, was drawing to a close, and our Generals\nwere making ready for a combined campaign.\n\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f had reassembled his troops, and was still to be found before\nOrenburg. At the approach of our forces the disaffected villages\nreturned to their allegiance.\n\nSoon Prince Gal\u00c3\u00adtsyn won a complete victory over Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f, who had\nventured near Fort Talitcheff; the victor relieved Orenburg, and\nappeared to have given the finishing stroke to the rebellion.\n\nIn the midst of all this Zourine had been detached against some mounted\nBashkirs, who dispersed before we even set eyes on them.\n\nSpring, which caused the rivers to overflow, and thus block the roads,\nsurprised us in a little Tartar village, when we consoled ourselves for\nour forced inaction by the thought that this insignificant war of\nskirmishers with robbers would soon come to an end.\n\nBut Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f had not been taken; he reappeared very soon in the mining\ncountry of the Ural, on the Siberian frontier. He reassembled new bands,\nand again began his robberies. We soon learnt the destruction of\nSiberian forts, then the fall of Khasan, and the audacious march of the\nusurper on Moscow.\n\nZourine received orders to cross the River Volga. I shall not stay to\nrelate the events of the war.\n\nI shall only say that misery reached its height. The gentry hid in the\nwoods; the authorities had no longer any power anywhere; the leaders of\nsolitary detachments punished or pardoned without giving account of\ntheir conduct. All this extensive and beautiful country-side was laid\nwaste with fire and sword.\n\nMay God grant we never see again so senseless and pitiless a revolt. At\nlast Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f was beaten by Michelson, and was obliged to fly again.\n\nZourine received soon afterwards the news that the robber had been taken\nand the order to halt.\n\nThe war was at an end.\n\nIt was at last possible for me to go home. The thought of embracing my\nparents and seeing Marya again, of whom I had no news, filled me with\njoy. I jumped like a child.\n\nZourine laughed, and said, shrugging his shoulders--\n\n\"Wait a bit, wait till you be married; you'll see all go to the devil\nthen.\"\n\nAnd I must confess a strange feeling embittered my joy.\n\nThe recollection of the man covered with the blood of so many innocent\nvictims, and the thought of the punishment awaiting him, never left me\nany peace.\n\n\"Em\u00c3\u00a9la,\"[69] I said to myself, in vexation, \"why did you not cast\nyourself on the bayonets, or present your heart to the grapeshot. That\nhad been best for you.\"\n\n_(After advancing as far as the gates of Moscow, which he might perhaps\nhave taken had not his bold heart failed him at the last moment,\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f, beaten, had been delivered up by his comrades for the sum of\na hundred thousand roubles, shut up in an iron cage, and conveyed to\nMoscow. He was executed by order of Catherine II., in 1775.)_\n\nZourine gave me leave.\n\nA few days later I should have been in the bosom of my family, when an\nunforeseen thunderbolt struck me. The day of my departure, just as I was\nabout to start, Zourine entered my room with a paper in his hand,\nlooking anxious. I felt a pang at my heart; I was afraid, without\nknowing wherefore. The Major bade my servant leave us, and told me he\nwished to speak to me.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" I asked, with disquietude.\n\n\"A little unpleasantness,\" replied he, offering me the paper. \"Read what\nI have just received.\"\n\nIt was a secret dispatch, addressed to all Commanders of detachments,\nordering them to arrest me wherever I should be found, and to send me\nunder a strong escort to Khasan, to the Commission of Inquiry appointed\nto try Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f and his accomplices.\n\nThe paper dropped from my hands.\n\n\"Come,\" said Zourine, \"it is my duty to execute the order. Probably the\nreport of your journeys in Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f's intimate company has reached\nheadquarters. I hope sincerely the affair will not end badly, and that\nyou will be able to justify yourself to the Commission. Don't be cast\ndown, and start at once.\"\n\nI had a clear conscience, but the thought that our reunion was delayed\nfor some months yet made my heart fail me.\n\nAfter receiving Zourine's affectionate farewell I got into my\n\"_telega_,\"[70] two hussars, with drawn swords, seated themselves, one\non each side of me, and we took the road to Khasan.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nTHE TRIAL.\n\n\nI did not doubt that the cause of my arrest was my departure from\nOrenburg without leave. Thus I could easily exculpate myself, for not\nonly had we not been forbidden to make sorties against the enemy, but\nwere encouraged in so doing.\n\nStill my friendly understanding with Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f seemed to be proved by a\ncrowd of witnesses, and must appear at least suspicious. All the way I\npondered the questions I should be asked, and mentally resolved upon my\nanswers. I determined to tell the judges the whole truth, convinced\nthat it was at once the simplest and surest way of justifying myself.\n\nI reached Khasan, a miserable town, which I found laid waste, and\nwell-nigh reduced to ashes. All along the street, instead of houses,\nwere to be seen heaps of charred plaster and rubbish, and walls without\nwindows or roofs. These were the marks Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f had left. I was taken\nto the fort, which had remained whole, and the hussars, my escort,\nhanded me over to the officer of the guard.\n\nHe called a farrier, who coolly rivetted irons on my ankles.\n\nThen I was led to the prison building, where I was left alone in a\nnarrow, dark cell, which had but its four walls and a little skylight,\nwith iron bars.\n\nSuch a beginning augured nothing good. Still I did not lose either hope\nor courage. I had recourse to the consolation of all who suffer, and,\nafter tasting for the first time the sweetness of a prayer from an\ninnocent heart full of anguish, I peacefully fell asleep without giving\na thought to what might befall me.\n\nOn the morrow the gaoler came to wake me, telling me that I was summoned\nbefore the Commission.\n\nTwo soldiers conducted me across a court to the Commandant's house,\nthen, remaining in the ante-room, left me to enter alone the inner\nchamber. I entered a rather large reception room. Behind the table,\ncovered with papers, were seated two persons, an elderly General,\nlooking severe and cold, and a young officer of the Guard, looking, at\nmost, about thirty, of easy and attractive demeanour; near the window at\nanother table sat a secretary with a pen behind his ear, bending over\nhis paper ready to take down my evidence.\n\nThe cross-examination began. They asked me my name and rank. The\nGeneral inquired if I were not the son of Andr\u00c3\u00a9j Petr\u00c3\u00b3vitch Grineff, and\non my affirmative answer, he exclaimed, severely--\n\n\"It is a great pity such an honourable man should have a son so very\nunworthy of him!\"\n\nI quietly made answer that, whatever might be the accusations lying\nheavily against me, I hoped to be able to explain them away by a candid\navowal of the truth.\n\nMy coolness displeased him.\n\n\"You are a bold, barefaced rascal,\" he said to me, frowning. \"However,\nwe have seen many of them.\"\n\nThen the young officer asked me by what chance and at what time I had\nentered Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f's service, and on what affairs he had employed me.\n\nI indignantly rejoined that, being an officer and a gentleman, I had\nnot been able to enter Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f's service, and that he had not employed\nme on any business whatsoever.\n\n\"How, then, does it happen,\" resumed my judge, \"that the officer and\ngentleman be the only one pardoned by the usurper, while all his\ncomrades are massacred in cold blood? How does it happen, also, that the\nsame officer and gentleman could live snugly and pleasantly with the\nrebels, and receive from the ringleader presents of a '_pelisse_,' a\nhorse, and a half rouble? What is the occasion of so strange a\nfriendship? And upon what can it be founded if not on treason, or at the\nleast be occasioned by criminal and unpardonable baseness?\"\n\nThe words of the officer wounded me deeply, and I entered hotly on my\nvindication.\n\nI related how my acquaintance with Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f had begun, on the steppe,\nin the midst of a snowstorm; how he had recognized me and granted me my\nlife at the taking of Fort B\u00c3\u00a9logorsk. I admitted that, indeed, I had\naccepted from the usurper a \"_touloup_\" and a horse; but I had defended\nFort B\u00c3\u00a9logorsk against the rascal to the last gasp. Finally I appealed\nto the name of my General, who could testify to my zeal during the\ndisastrous siege of Orenburg.\n\nThe severe old man took from the table an open letter, which he began to\nread aloud.\n\n\"In answer to your excellency on the score of Ensign Grineff, who is\nsaid to have been mixed up in the troubles, and to have entered into\ncommunication with the robber, communication contrary to the rules and\nregulations of the service, and opposed to all the duties imposed by his\noath, I have the honour to inform you that the aforesaid Ensign Grineff\nserved at Orenburg from the month of Oct., 1773, until Feb. 24th of the\npresent year, upon which day he left the town, and has not been seen\nsince. Still the enemy's deserters have been heard to declare that he\nwent to Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f's camp, and that he accompanied him to Fort B\u00c3\u00a9logorsk,\nwhere he was formerly in garrison. On the other hand, in respect to his\nconduct I can--\"\n\nHere the General broke off, and said to me with harshness--\n\n\"Well, what have you to say now for yourself?\"\n\nI was about to continue as I had begun, and relate my connection with\nMarya as openly as the rest. But suddenly I felt an unconquerable\ndisgust to tell such a story. It occurred to me that if I mentioned her,\nthe Commission would oblige her to appear; and the idea of exposing her\nname to all the scandalous things said by the rascals under\ncross-examination, and the thought of even seeing her in their presence,\nwas so repugnant to me that I became confused, stammered, and took\nrefuge in silence.\n\nMy judges, who appeared to be listening to my answers with a certain\ngood will, were again prejudiced against me by the sight of my\nconfusion. The officer of the Guard requested that I should be\nconfronted with the principal accuser. The General bade them bring in\n_yesterday's rascal._ I turned eagerly towards the door to look out for\nmy accuser.\n\nA few moments afterwards the clank of chains was heard, and there\nentered--Chvabrine. I was struck by the change that had come over him.\nHe was pale and thin. His hair, formerly black as jet, had begun to turn\ngrey. His long beard was unkempt. He repeated all his accusations in a\nfeeble, but resolute tone. According to him, I had been sent by\nPugatch\u00c3\u00a9f as a spy to Orenburg; I went out each day as far as the line\nof sharpshooters to transmit written news of all that was passing within\nthe town; finally, I had definitely come over to the usurper's side,\ngoing with him from fort to fort, and trying, by all the means in my\npower, to do evil to my companions in treason, to supplant them in their\nposts, and profit more by the favours of the arch-rebel. I heard him to\nthe end in silence, and felt glad of one thing; he had never pronounced\nMarya's name. Was it because his self-love was wounded by the thought of\nher who had disdainfully rejected him, or was it that still within his\nheart yet lingered a spark of the same feeling which kept me silent?\nWhatever it was, the Commission did not hear spoken the name of the\ndaughter of the Commandant of Fort B\u00c3\u00a9logorsk. I was still further\nconfirmed in the resolution I had taken, and when the judges asked me if\nI had aught to answer to Chvabrine's allegations, I contented myself\nwith saying that I did abide by my first declaration, and that I had\nnothing more to show for my vindication.\n\nThe General bid them take us away. We went out together. I looked calmly\nat Chvabrine, and did not say one word to him. He smiled a smile of\nsatisfied hatred, gathered up his fetters, and quickened his pace to\npass before me. I was taken back to prison, and after that I underwent\nno further examination.\n\nI was not witness to all that I have still to tell my readers, but I\nhave heard the whole thing related so often that the least little\ndetails have remained graven in my memory, and it seems to me I was\npresent myself.\n\nMarya was received by my parents with the cordial kindness\ncharacteristic of people in old days. In the opportunity presented to\nthem of giving a home to a poor orphan they saw a favour of God. Very\nsoon they became truly attached to her, for one could not know her\nwithout loving her. My love no longer appeared a folly even to my\nfather, and my mother thought only of the union of her Petr\u00c3\u00basha with the\nCommandant's daughter.\n\nThe news of my arrest electrified with horror my whole family. Still,\nMarya had so simply told my parents the origin of my strange friendship\nwith Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f that, not only were they not uneasy, but it even made\nthem laugh heartily. My father could not believe it possible that I\nshould be mixed up in a disgraceful revolt, of which the object was the\ndownfall of the throne and the extermination of the race of \"_boy\u00c3\u00a1rs_.\"\nHe cross-examined Sav\u00c3\u00a9liitch sharply, and my retainer confessed that I\nhad been the guest of Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f, and that the robber had certainly\nbehaved generously towards me. But at the same time he solemnly averred\nupon oath that he had never heard me speak of any treason. My old\nparents' minds were relieved, and they impatiently awaited better news.\nBut as to Marya, she was very uneasy, and only caution and modesty kept\nher silent.\n\nSeveral weeks passed thus. All at once my father received from\nPetersburg a letter from our kinsman, Prince Banojik. After the usual\ncompliments he announced to him that the suspicions which had arisen of\nmy participation in the plots of the rebels had been proved to be but\ntoo well founded, adding that condign punishment as a deterrent should\nhave overtaken me, but that the Tzarina, through consideration for the\nloyal service and white hairs of my father, had condescended to pardon\nthe criminal son, and, remitting the disgrace-fraught execution, had\ncondemned him to exile for life in the heart of Siberia.\n\nThis unexpected blow nearly killed my father. He lost his habitual\nfirmness, and his sorrow, usually dumb, found vent in bitter lament.\n\n\"What!\" he never ceased repeating, well-nigh beside himself, \"What! my\nson mixed up in the plots of Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f! Just God! what have I lived to\nsee! The Tzarina grants him life, but does that make it easier for me to\nbear? It is not the execution which is horrible. My ancestor perished on\nthe scaffold for conscience sake,[71] my father fell with the martyrs\nVolynski and Khuchtchoff,[72] but that a '_boy\u00c3\u00a1r_' should forswear his\noath--that he should join with robbers, rascals, convicted felons,\nrevolted slaves! Shame for ever--shame on our race!\"\n\nFrightened by his despair, my mother dared not weep before him, and\nendeavoured to give him courage by talking of the uncertainty and\ninjustice of the verdict. But my father was inconsolable.\n\nMarya was more miserable than anyone. Fully persuaded that I could have\njustified myself had I chosen, she suspected the motive which had kept\nme silent, and deemed herself the sole cause of my misfortune. She hid\nfrom all eyes her tears and her suffering, but never ceased thinking how\nshe could save me.\n\nOne evening, seated on the sofa, my father was turning over the Court\nCalendar; but his thoughts were far away, and the book did not produce\nits usual effect on him. He was whistling an old march. My mother was\nsilently knitting, and her tears were dropping from time to time on her\nwork. Marya, who was working in the same room, all at once informed my\nparents that she was obliged to start for Petersburg, and begged them to\ngive her the means to do so.\n\nMy mother was much affected by this declaration.\n\n\"Why,\" said she, \"do you want to go to Petersburg? You, too--do you also\nwish to forsake us?\"\n\nMarya made answer that her fate depended on the journey, and that she\nwas going to seek help and countenance from people high in favour, as\nthe daughter of a man who had fallen victim to his fidelity.\n\nMy father bowed his head. Each word which reminded him of the alleged\ncrime of his son was to him a keen reproach.\n\n\"Go,\" he said at last, with a sigh; \"we do not wish to cast any\nobstacles between you and happiness. May God grant you an honest man as\na husband, and not a disgraced and convicted traitor.\"\n\nHe rose and left the room.\n\nLeft alone with my mother, Marya confided to her part of her plans. My\nmother kissed her with tears, and prayed God would grant her success.\n\nA few days afterwards Marya set forth with Palashka and her faithful\nSav\u00c3\u00a9liitch, who, necessarily, parted from me, consoled himself by\nremembering he was serving my betrothed.\n\nMarya arrived safely at Sofia, and, learning that the court at this time\nwas at the summer palace of Tzarskoe-Selo, she resolved to stop there.\nIn the post-house she obtained a little dressing-room behind a\npartition.\n\nThe wife of the postmaster came at once to gossip with her, and\nannounced to her pompously that she was the niece of a stove-warmer\nattached to the Palace, and, in a word, put her up to all the mysteries\nof the Palace. She told her at what hour the Tzarina rose, had her\ncoffee, went to walk; what high lords there were about her, what she had\ndeigned to say the evening before at table, who she received in the\nevening, and, in a word, the conversation of Anna Vlassi\u00c3\u00a9fna[73] might\nhave been a leaf from any memoir of the day, and would be invaluable\nnow. Marya Ivanofna heard her with great attention.\n\nThey went together to the Imperial Gardens, where Anna Vlassi\u00c3\u00a9fna told\nMarya the history of every walk and each little bridge. Both then\nreturned home, charmed with one another.\n\nOn the morrow, very early, Marya dressed herself and went to the\nImperial Gardens. The morning was lovely. The sun gilded with its beams\nthe tops of the lindens, already yellowed by the keen breath of autumn.\nThe large lake sparkled unruffled; the swans, just awake, were gravely\nquitting the bushes on the bank. Marya went to the edge of a beautiful\nlawn, where had lately been erected a monument in honour of the recent\nvictories of Count Roumianzeff.[74]\n\nAll at once a little dog of English breed ran towards her, barking.\nMarya stopped short, alarmed. At this moment a pleasant woman's voice\nsaid--\n\n\"Do not be afraid; he will not hurt you.\"\n\nMarya saw a lady seated on a little rustic bench opposite the monument,\nand she went and seated herself at the other end of the bench. The lady\nlooked attentively at her, and Marya, who had stolen one glance at her,\ncould now see her well. She wore a cap and a white morning gown and a\nlittle light cloak. She appeared about 50 years old; her face, full and\nhigh-coloured, expressed repose and gravity, softened by the sweetness\nof her blue eyes and charming smile. She was the first to break the\nsilence.\n\n\"Doubtless you are not of this place?\" she asked.\n\n\"You are right, lady; I only arrived yesterday from the country.\"\n\n\"You came with your parents?\"\n\n\"No, lady, alone.\"\n\n\"Alone! but you are very young to travel by yourself.\"\n\n\"I have neither father nor mother.\"\n\n\"You are here on business?\"\n\n\"Yes, lady, I came to present a petition to the Tzarina.\"\n\n\"You are an orphan; doubtless you have to complain of injustice or\nwrong.\"\n\n\"No, lady, I came to ask grace, and not justice.\"\n\n\"Allow me to ask a question: Who are you?\"\n\n\"I am the daughter of Captain Mironoff.\"\n\n\"Of Captain Mironoff? He who commanded one of the forts in the Orenburg\ndistrict?\"\n\n\"Yes, lady.\"\n\nThe lady appeared moved.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" she resumed, in a yet softer voice, \"if I meddle in your\naffairs; but I am going to Court. Explain to me the object of your\nrequest; perhaps I may be able to help you.\"\n\nMarya rose, and respectfully saluted her. Everything in the unknown lady\ninvoluntarily attracted her, and inspired trust. Marya took from her\npocket a folded paper; she offered it to her protectress, who ran over\nit in a low voice.\n\nWhen she began she looked kind and interested, but all at once her face\nchanged, and Marya, who followed with her eyes her every movement, was\nalarmed by the hard expression of the face lately so calm and gracious.\n\n\"You plead for Grineff,\" said the lady, in an icy tone. \"The Tzarina\ncannot grant him grace. He passed over to the usurper, not as an\nignorant and credulous man, but as a depraved and dangerous\ngood-for-nothing.\"\n\n\"It's not true!\" cried Marya.\n\n\"What! it's not true?\" retorted the lady, flushing up to her eyes.\n\n\"It is not true, before God it is not true,\" exclaimed Marya. \"I know\nall; I will tell you all. It is for me only that he exposed himself to\nall the misfortunes which have overtaken him. And if he did not\nvindicate himself before the judges, it is because he did not wish me to\nbe mixed up in the affair.\"\n\nAnd Marya eagerly related all the reader already knows.\n\nThe lady listened with deep attention.\n\n\"Where do you lodge?\" she asked, when the young girl concluded her\nstory. And when she heard that it was with Anna Vlassi\u00c3\u00a9fna, she added,\nwith a smile: \"Ah! I know! Good-bye! Do not tell anyone of our meeting.\nI hope you will not have to wait long for an answer to your letter.\"\n\nHaving said these words, she rose and went away by a covered walk.\n\nMarya returned home full of joyful hope.\n\nHer hostess scolded her for her early morning walk--bad, she said, in\nthe autumn for the health of a young girl. She brought the \"_samovar_,\"\nand over a cup of tea she was about to resume her endless discussion of\nthe Court, when a carriage with a coat-of-arms stopped before the door.\n\nA lackey in the Imperial livery entered the room, announcing that the\nTzarina deigned to call to her presence the daughter of Captain\nMironoff.\n\nAnna Vlassi\u00c3\u00a9fna was quite upset by this news.\n\n\"Oh, good heavens!\" cried she; \"the Tzarina summons you to Court! How\ndid she know of your arrival? And how will you acquit yourself before\nthe Tzarina, my little mother? I think you do not even know how to walk\nCourt fashion. I ought to take you; or, stay, should I not send for the\nmidwife, that she might lend you her yellow gown with flounces?\"\n\nBut the lackey declared that the Tzarina wanted Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna to come\nalone, and in the dress she should happen to be wearing. There was\nnothing for it but to obey, and Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna started.\n\nShe foresaw that our fate was in the balance, and her heart beat\nviolently. After a few moments the coach stopped before the Palace, and\nMarya, after crossing a long suite of empty and sumptuous rooms, was\nushered at last into the boudoir of the Tzarina. Some lords, who stood\naround there, respectfully opened a way for the young girl.\n\nThe Tzarina, in whom Marya recognized the lady of the garden, said to\nher, graciously--\n\n\"I am delighted to be able to accord you your prayer. I have had it all\nlooked into. I am convinced of the innocence of your betrothed. Here is\na letter which you will give your future father-in-law.\" Marya, all in\ntears, fell at the feet of the Tzarina, who raised her, and kissed her\nforehead. \"I know,\" said she, \"you are not rich, but I owe a debt to\nthe daughter of Captain Mironoff. Be easy about your future.\"\n\nAfter overwhelming the poor orphan with caresses, the Tzarina dismissed\nher, and Marya started the same day for my father's country house,\nwithout having even had the curiosity to take a look at Petersburg.\n\n\nHere end the memoirs of Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch Grineff; but family tradition\nasserts that he was released from captivity at the end of the year 1774,\nthat he was present at the execution of Pugatch\u00c3\u00a9f, and that the latter,\nrecognizing him in the crowd, made him a farewell sign with the head\nwhich, a few moments later, was held up to the people, lifeless and\nbleeding.\n\nSoon afterwards Petr' Andr\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00aftch became the husband of Marya Iv\u00c3\u00a1nofna.\nTheir descendants still live in the district of Simbirsk.\n\nIn the ancestral home in the village of ---- is still shown the\nautograph letter of Catherine II., framed and glazed.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":394,"split":"train"}
