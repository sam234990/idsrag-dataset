He is a condemned man at the outset of the story. The narrator tells us that from an early age he has loved animals. He and his wife have many pets, including a large, beautiful black cat (as described by the narrator) named Pluto. This cat is especially fond of the narrator and vice versa. Their mutual friendship lasts for several years, until the narrator becomes an alcoholic. One night, after coming home completely intoxicated, he believes the cat to be avoiding him. When he tries to seize it, the panicked cat bites the narrator, and in a fit of rage, he seizes the animal, pulls a pen-knife from his pocket, and deliberately gouges out the cat's eye.\nFrom that moment onward, the cat flees in terror at his master's approach. At first, the narrator is remorseful and regrets his cruelty. \"But this feeling soon gave place to irritation. And then came, as if to my final and irrevocable overthrow, the spirit of perverseness.\" He takes the cat out in the garden one morning and ties a noose around its neck, hanging it from a tree where it dies. That very night, his house mysteriously catches fire, forcing the narrator, his wife and their servant to flee the premises.\nThe next day, the narrator returns to the ruins of his home to find, imprinted on the single wall that survived the fire, the apparition of a gigantic cat, with a rope around the animal's neck.\nAt first, this image deeply disturbs the narrator, but gradually he determines a logical explanation for it, that someone outside had cut the cat from the tree and thrown the dead creature into the bedroom to wake him during the fire. The narrator begins to miss Pluto, feeling guilty. Some time later, he finds a similar cat in a tavern. It is the same size and color as the original and is even missing an eye. The only difference is a large white patch on the animal's chest. The narrator takes it home, but soon begins to loathe, even fear the creature. After a time, the white patch of fur begins to take shape and, to the narrator, forms the shape of the gallows. This terrifies and angers him more, and he avoids the cat whenever possible. Then, one day when the narrator and his wife are visiting the cellar in their new home, the cat gets under its master's feet and nearly trips him down the stairs. Enraged, the man grabs an axe and tries to kill the cat but is stopped by his wife- whom, out of fury, he kills instead. To conceal her body he removes bricks from a protrusion in the wall, places her body there, and repairs the hole. A few days later, when the police show up at the house to investigate the wife's disappearance, they find nothing and the narrator goes free. The cat, which he intended to kill as well, has also gone missing. This grants him the freedom to sleep, even with the burden of murder.\nOn the last day of the investigation, the narrator accompanies the police into the cellar. They still find nothing significant. Then, completely confident in his own safety, the narrator comments on the sturdiness of the building and raps upon the wall he had built around his wife's body. A loud, inhuman wailing sound fills the room. The alarmed police tear down the wall and find the wife's corpse, and on its rotting head, to the utter horror of the narrator, is the screeching black cat.

B\u00c3\u00a9dolli\u00c3\u00a8re's charming story of Mother Michel and her cat was turned\ninto English for the entertainment of two small readers at the writer's\nfireside. Subsequently the translation was fortunate enough to find a\nlarger audience in the pages of a popular juvenile magazine. The\ningenious and spirited series of silhouettes with which Mr. Hopkins has\nenriched the text is the translator's only plea for presenting in book\nform so slight a performance as his own part of the work.\n\n\n\n\nTHE STORY OF A CAT.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nHOW MOTHER MICHEL MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF\nHER CAT.\n\n\nThere lived in Paris, under the reign of King Louis XV., a very rich old\ncountess named Yolande de la Grenouill\u00c3\u00a8re. She was a worthy and\ncharitable lady, who distributed alms not only to the poor of her own\nparish, Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois, but to the unfortunate of other\nquarters. Her husband, Roch-Eustache-J\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a9mie, Count of Grenouill\u00c3\u00a8re, had\nfallen gloriously at the battle of Fontenoy, on the 11th of May, 1745.\nThe noble widow had long mourned for him, and even now at times wept over\nhis death. Left without children, and almost entirely alone in the world,\nshe gave herself up to a strange fancy,--a fancy, it is true, which in no\nmanner detracted from her real virtues and admirable qualities: she had\na passion for animals. And an unhappy passion it was, since all those she\nhad possessed had died in her arms.\n\n[Illustration: The Countess distributes Alms.]\n\nThe first, in date, in her affections had been a green parrot, which,\nhaving been so imprudent as to eat some parsley, fell a victim to\nfrightful colics. An indigestion, caused by sweet biscuits, had taken\nfrom Madame de la Grenouill\u00c3\u00a8re a pug-dog of the most brilliant promise. A\nthird favorite, an ape of a very interesting species, having broken his\nchain one night, went clambering over the trees in the garden, where,\nduring a shower, he caught a cold in the head, which conducted him to the\ntomb.\n\n[Illustration: The Ape fatally exposes himself.]\n\nFollowing these, the Countess had birds of divers kinds; but some of them\nhad flown away, and the others had died of the pip. Cast down by such\ncontinuous disasters, Madame de la Grenouill\u00c3\u00a8re shed many tears. Seeing\nher inconsolable, the friends of the Countess proposed successively\nsquirrels, learned canaries, white mice, cockatoos; but she would not\nlisten to them; she even refused a superb spaniel who played dominoes,\ndanced to music, ate salad, and translated Greek.\n\n[Illustration: Her Friends propose Squirrels, Canaries, Mice, etc.]\n\n\"No, no,\" she said, \"I do not want any more animals; the air of my house\nis death to them.\"\n\n[Illustration: The Boys after the Cat.]\n\nShe had ended by believing in fatality.\n\nOne day, as the Countess was leaving the church, she saw a crowd of boys\nhustling and elbowing each other, and giving vent to peals of joyous\nlaughter. When, seated in her carriage, she was able to overlook the\nthrong, she discovered that the cause of this tumult was a poor cat to\nwhose tail the little wretches had tied a tin saucepan.\n\nThe unfortunate cat had evidently been running a long time, for he seemed\novercome with fatigue. Seeing that he slackened his speed, his tormentors\nformed a circle around him, and began pelting him with stones. The\nluckless creature bowed his head, and, recognizing that he was surrounded\nby none but enemies, resigned himself to his hard fate with the heroism\nof a Roman senator. Several stones had already reached him, when Madame\nde la Grenouill\u00c3\u00a8re, seized with deep compassion, descended from her\ncarriage, and, pushing the crowd aside, exclaimed: \"I will give a louis\nto whoever will save that animal!\"\n\nThese words produced a magical effect; they transformed the persecutors\ninto liberators; the poor cat came near being suffocated by those who now\ndisputed the honor of rescuing him safe and sound. Finally, a sort of\nyoung Hercules overthrew his rivals, brought off the cat, and presented\nit half dead to the Countess.\n\n[Illustration: The Luckless Creature bowed his Head.]\n\n\"Very well,\" she said; \"here, my brave little man, is the reward I\npromised.\" She gave him a bright golden louis just out of the mint, and\nthen added, \"Relieve this poor animal of his inconvenient burden.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Dear me, how homely he is!\"]\n\nWhile the young Hercules obeyed, Madame de la Grenouill\u00c3\u00a8re regarded the\ncreature she had rescued. It was a true type of the street-cat. His\nnatural hideousness was increased by the accidents of a long and\nirregular career; his short hair was soiled with mud; one could scarcely\ndistinguish beneath the various splashes his gray fur robe striped with\nblack. He was so thin as to be nearly transparent, so shrunken that one\ncould count his ribs, and so dispirited that a mouse might have beaten\nhim. There was only one thing in his favor, and that was his physiognomy.\n\n[Illustration: The Cat is presented, half dead, to the Countess.]\n\n\"Dear me, how homely he is!\" said Madame de la Grenouill\u00c3\u00a8re, after\nfinishing her examination.\n\nAt the moment she stepped into the carriage, the cat fixed his great\nsea-green eyes upon her and gave her a look, strange, indefinable, full\nat the same time of gratitude and reproach, and so expressive that the\ngood lady was instantly fascinated. She read in this glance a discourse\nof great eloquence. The look seemed to wish to say,--\n\n\"You have obeyed a generous impulse; you saw me feeble, suffering,\noppressed, and you took pity on me. Now that your benevolence is\nsatisfied, my deformity inspires you with contempt. I thought you were\ngood, but you are not good; you have the instinct of kindness, but you\nare not kind. If you were really charitable you would continue to\ninterest yourself in me for the very reason that I am homely; you would\nreflect that my misfortunes are owing to my ugly appearance, and that the\nsame cause,--should you leave me there in the street, at the mercy of the\nwicked boys,--the same cause, I say, would produce the same effects. Go!\nyou needn't pride yourself on your half-way benevolence!--you have not\ndone me a service; you have only prolonged my agony. I am an outcast, the\nwhole world is against me, I am condemned to die; let my destiny be\naccomplished!\"\n\nMadame de la Grenouill\u00c3\u00a8re was moved to tears. The cat seemed to her\nsuperhuman--no, it was a cat; it seemed to her superanimal! She thought\nof the mysteries of transformation, and imagined that the cat, before\nassuming his present form, had been a great orator and a person of\nstanding. She said to her maid, Mother Michel, who was in the\ncarriage,--\n\n\"Take the cat and carry him.\"\n\n\"What, you will bring him with you, madame?\" cried Mother Michel.\n\n\"Certainly. As long as I live that animal shall have a place at my\nfireside and at my table. If you wish to please me, you will treat him\nwith the same zeal and affection you show to myself.\"\n\n\"Madame shall be obeyed.\"\n\n\"That is well,--and now for home!\"\n\n[Illustration: Mother Michel is told to take the Cat.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nHOW THE CAT WAS INSTALLED WITH MADAME DE LA\nGRENOUILL\u00c3\u0088RE, AND CONFIDED TO THE CARE OF\nMOTHER MICHEL.\n\n\n[Illustration: Mother Michel.]\n\nMadame de la Grenouill\u00c3\u00a8re inhabited a magnificent mansion situated on the\ncorner of the streets Saint-Thomas-du-Louvre and Orties-Saint-Louis;\nthere she led a very retired life, on almost intimate terms with her two\nprincipal domestics,--Madame Michel, her maid and companion, and M.\nLustucru, the steward. These servants being elderly persons, the\nCountess, who was possessed of a pleasant humor, had christened them\nMother Michel and Father Lustucru.\n\nThe features of Mother Michel bore the imprint of her amiable\ndisposition; she was as open and candid as Father Lustucru was sly and\ndissimulating. The plausible air of the steward might deceive persons\nwithout much experience; but close observers could easily discover the\nmost perverse inclinations under his false mask of good nature. There\nwas duplicity in his great blue eyes, anger concentrated in his nostrils,\nsomething wily in the end of his tapering nose, and malice in the shape\nof his lips.\n\nHowever, this man had never, in appearance, at least, done anything to\nforfeit his honor; he had been able to guard an outside air of honesty,\nhiding very carefully the blackness of his nature. His wickedness was\nlike a mine to which one has not yet applied the match,--it waited only\nfor an occasion to flash out.\n\n[Illustration: Father Lustucru.]\n\nLustucru detested animals, but, in order to flatter the taste of his\nmistress, he pretended to idolize them. On seeing Mother Michel bearing\nin her arms the rescued cat, he said to himself:\n\n\"What, another beast! As if there were not enough of us in the house!\"\n\nHe could not help throwing a glance of antipathy at the new-comer; then,\ncurbing himself quickly, he cried, with an affected admiration,--\n\n\"Oh, the beautiful cat! the pretty cat! that cat hasn't his equal!\"--and\nhe caressed it in the most perfidious fashion.\n\n\"Truly?\" said Madame de la Grenouill\u00c3\u00a8re; \"you do not find him too\nhomely?\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Oh, the Beautiful Cat!\"]\n\n\"Too homely! But, then, he has charming eyes. But, if he was frightful,\nyour interesting yourself in him would change him.\"\n\n\"He displeased me at first.\"\n\n\"The beings who displease at first are those one loves the most after\nawhile,\" replied Father Lustucru, sententiously.\n\nThey proceeded at once to make the toilet of the cat, who, in spite of\nhis instinctive horror of water, submitted with touching resignation to\nbeing washed; he seemed to understand that it improved his personal\nappearance. After giving him a dish of broken meat, which he ate with\ngreat relish, they arranged the hours for his meals, the employment of\nhis days, and the place where he was to sleep.\n\n[Illustration: The Cat is washed.]\n\nThey thought also to give him a name. Mother Michel and Father Lustucru\nproposed several that were quite happy, such as Mistigris, Tristepatte,\netc.; but the Countess rejected them all successively. She desired a name\nthat would recall the circumstances in which the cat was found. An old\nscholar, whom she consulted the next day, suggested that of Moumouth,\ncomposed of two Hebrew words which signify _saved from saucepans_.\n\n[Illustration: The Cat grows Fat.]\n\n[Illustration: The Old Scholar looks for a Name.]\n\nAt the end of a few days, Moumouth was unrecognizable. His fur was\npolished with care; nourishing food had filled out his form; his\nmustaches stood up like those of a swordsman of the seventeenth century;\nhis eyes shone as emeralds. He was a living proof of the influence of\ngood fare upon the race. He owed his excellent condition chiefly to\nMother Michel, whom he held in affectionate consideration; he showed, on\nthe other hand, for Father Lustucru a very marked dislike. As if he had\ndivined that here he had to do with an enemy, he refused to accept\nanything presented by the steward. However, they saw but little of each\nother. The days passed very happily with Moumouth, and everything\npromised a smiling future for him; but, like the sword of Damocles,\ntroubles are ever suspended above the heads of men and of cats. On the\n24th of January, 1753, an unusual sadness was observed in Moumouth; he\nscarcely responded to the caresses which Madame de la Grenouill\u00c3\u00a8re\nlavished upon him; he ate nothing, and spent the day crouched on a corner\nof the hearth, gazing mournfully into the fire. He had a presentiment of\nsome misfortune, and the misfortune came.\n\n[Illustration: He will take Nothing from the Steward.]\n\n[Illustration: He crouches in a Corner of the Hearth.]\n\nThat night a messenger, sent from the Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau de la Gingeole in Normandy,\nbrought a letter to the Countess from her younger sister, who, having\nbroken a leg in getting out of her carriage, begged the Countess, her\nonly relative, to come to her at once. Madame de la Grenouill\u00c3\u00a8re was too\nsympathetic and kind-hearted to hesitate an instant.\n\n\"I depart to-morrow,\" said she.\n\nAt these words, Moumouth, who followed his benefactress with his eyes,\ngave a melancholy _miau_.\n\n[Illustration: \"In her Youth she caressed a Kitten.\"]\n\n[Illustration: \"I depart To-morrow!\"]\n\n\"Poor cat!\" resumed the lady, with emotion, \"it is necessary that we\nshould be separated! I cannot bring you with me, for my sister has the\nweakness to hate animals of your species; she pretends they are\ntreacherous. What slander! In her youth she caressed a kitten, who, too\nmuch excited by marks of affection, scratched her involuntarily. Was it\nfrom wickedness? No, it was from sensibility. However, since that day my\nsister has sworn an eternal hatred for cats.\"\n\nMoumouth regarded his mistress with an air which seemed to say,--\n\n\"But you, at least, you do us justice, truly superior woman!\"\n\nAfter a moment of silence and meditation, the Countess added,--\n\n\"Mother Michel, I confide my cat to you.\"\n\n\"We will take good care of him, madame,\" said Father Lustucru.\n\n\"Don't you trouble yourself about him, I pray you,\" interrupted the\nCountess. \"You know that he has taken a dislike to you; your presence\nmerely is sufficient to irritate him. Why, I don't know; but you are\ninsupportable to him.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Father Lustucru, with contrition; \"but the cat is\nunjust, for I love him and he doesn't love me.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Mother Michel, I confide my Cat to you.\"]\n\n\"My sister is also unjust. Cats, perhaps, love her, and she does not love\nthem. I respect her opinion. Respect that of Moumouth.\" Having pronounced\nthese words in a firm tone, Madame de la Grenouill\u00c3\u00a8re addressed herself\nto Mother Michel.\n\n\"It is to you, Mother Michel, and to you alone, that I confide him.\nReturn him to me safe and sound, and I will cover you with benefits. I am\nsixty-five years of age, you are ten years younger; it is probable that\nyou will live to close my eyes\"--\n\n\"Ah, madame! why such sorrowful ideas?\"\n\n\"Let me finish. To guard against mischance, I have already thought to\nprovide for you comfortably; but, if you keep Moumouth for me, I will\ngive you a pension of fifteen hundred livres.\"\n\n\"Ah, madame!\" said Mother Michel, in an impressive tone, \"it is not\nnecessary to hire my services; I love the cat with all my heart, and I\nwill always be devoted to him.\"\n\n\"I am sure of it, and I shall also know how to reward your zeal.\" During\nthis conversation, Father Lustucru employed all his forces to conceal the\nexpression of his jealousy.\n\n\"Everything for her, and nothing for me!\" he said to himself. \"Fifteen\nhundred livres a year! It is a fortune, and she will have it! Oh, no! she\nshall not have it.\"\n\n[Illustration: The Post-chaise is ready.]\n\nThe next morning, at half-past seven, four lively horses were harnessed\nto the post-chaise which was to convey the excellent old lady to\nNormandy. She said a last adieu to her favorite, pressed him to her\nheart, and stepped into the carriage.\n\nUntil then, Moumouth had felt only a vague uneasiness; but at this moment\nhe understood it all! He saw his benefactress ready to depart; and,\ntrembling at the thought of losing her, he made one bound to her side.\n\n\"It is necessary for you to stay here,\" said Madame de la Grenouill\u00c3\u00a8re,\nmaking an effort to restrain her tears.\n\nWill it be believed?--the cat also wept!\n\n[Illustration: The Cat wishes to go with the Carriage.]\n\nTo put an end to this painful scene, Mother Michel seized the cat by the\nshoulders and detached him from the carriage-cushion, to which he clung;\nthe door closed, the horses gave a vigorous pull, and started off at a\nspeed of not less than three leagues an hour. Moumouth rolled in a\nconvulsion, and then fainted.\n\n[Illustration: Moumouth faints.]\n\nMadame de la Grenouill\u00c3\u00a8re, her head stretched out of the post-chaise,\nwaved her handkerchief, crying:--\n\n\"Mother Michel, I commend my cat to you!\"\n\n[Illustration: \"He shall die!\"]\n\n\"Be tranquil, madame; I swear you shall find him large and plump when you\nreturn.\"\n\n\"And I,\" muttered Father Lustucru, in a deep voice, \"I swear he shall\ndie!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nIN WHICH ARE SHOWN THE GOODNESS OF MOTHER\nMICHEL AND THE WICKEDNESS OF FATHER\nLUSTUCRU.\n\n\nMother Michel, worthy of the confidence which had been reposed in her,\ndisplayed for Moumouth a truly maternal tenderness; she tended him,\ncoddled him, took such pains with him, in short, that he became one of\nthe most beautiful cats in that quarter of the town where the cats are\nmagnificent. She watched over him constantly, gave him the choicest bits\nto eat, and put him to bed at night on the softest of eider-down quilts.\n\nFearing that he might fall ill some day, and wishing to inform herself\nconcerning the maladies to which cats are liable, she procured various\nbooks on that important subject; she even went so far in her devotion as\nto read the \"History of Cats,\" by Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois-Auguste Paradis de Moncrif, a\nmember of the French Academy.\n\nThe conduct of Mother Michel had no low motive of personal interest. She\ngave scarcely a thought to herself, the good old soul! Content with\nlittle, she would always have enough to live on; she required nothing but\na small room, brown bread, a supply of wood in winter, and a\nspinning-wheel. But she had nephews and nieces, god-children, whom she\nhoped to be able to help; it was to them that she destined in advance the\ngifts of Madame de la Grenouill\u00c3\u00a8re.\n\nThe continually increasing prosperity of Moumouth exasperated Father\nLustucru. He saw with a sort of dread the approach of the hour when the\nfaithful guardian would be rewarded; he dreamt day and night of the means\nto prevent it,--to carry off her four-footed pupil, and bring down on her\nthe wrath of their mistress. By dint of indulging his hatred and envy in\nsolitary reflections, he ceased at last to draw back at the prospect of\ncommitting a crime.\n\n\"How,\" he said, \"how rid the house of that miserable cat? What arms shall\nI use against him? Fire, poison, or water? I will try water!\"\n\nThis resolution taken, he thought of nothing but to put it into\nexecution. It was difficult to get possession of Moumouth, of whom Mother\nMichel rarely lost sight; and Moumouth, too, not having the slightest\nconfidence in the steward, was always on the defensive. Lustucru watched\nduring several days for a favorable occasion.\n\nOne night, after making an excellent supper, Moumouth curled himself up\nnear the fire in the parlor, at the feet of Mother Michel, and slept the\nsleep of the just with good digestion. In the midst of this, Father\nLustucru came into the room.\n\n\"Good!\" he thought. \"The cat sleeps. Let us get the guardian out of the\nway.\"\n\n\"How amiable of you to come and keep me company!\" said Mother Michel,\npolitely. \"You are quite well this evening?\"\n\n[Illustration: Father Lustucru's Stratagem.]\n\n\"Perfectly; but everybody is not like me. Our porter, for example, is in\na deplorable state; he is suffering excessively from his rheumatism, and\nwould be very happy to see you a moment. You have gentle words to console\nthe afflicted, and excellent receipts to cure them. Go, then, and pay a\nlittle visit to our friend Krautman; I am persuaded that your presence\nwill help him.\"\n\n[Illustration: The Porter.]\n\nMother Michel got up at once and descended to the apartment of the\nporter, who was, indeed, suffering from a violent rheumatic pain.\n\n\"Now for us two!\" cried Father Lustucru to himself.\n\n[Illustration: The Steward seizes Moumouth.]\n\nHe went stealthily into an adjoining room, walking upon the tips of his\ntoes, and took a covered basket which he had hidden in the bottom of a\ncloset. Then he returned to Moumouth, whom he seized roughly by the neck.\nThe unfortunate animal awoke with a start, and found himself suspended in\nthe air face to face with Father Lustucru, his enemy. In that horrible\nsituation he would have cried, and struggled, and called for assistance,\nbut he had no time. The odious steward plunged the poor cat into the\nbasket, quickly clapped down the solid cover, and ran rapidly to the\nstaircase, his eyes haggard and his hair standing on end, like a man who\ncommits a crime.\n\n[Illustration: The Cat is plunged into the Basket.]\n\nIt was a beautiful night in February, with a clear sky and a dry, cold\natmosphere. The moon shone with all her brightness; but, at intervals,\ngreat clouds drifted over her face and rendered the obscurity complete.\nFather Lustucru was obliged to cross the garden, in order to pass out by\na small door, of which he had taken the key. He glided from bush to bush,\ncarefully avoiding the paths, except when the clouds veiled the moon. He\nhad half-opened the door, when he heard a sound of footsteps and voices\noutside. He started back involuntarily, then stood still and listened.\n\n[Illustration: The Steward hurries away.]\n\n\"What foolishness!\" he said, after a moment of silent observation. \"I had\nforgotten that it was carnival-time; those are masqueraders passing.\"\n\n[Illustration: He dances with Delight.]\n\nIt was, in effect, a band of masqueraders from the Palais Royal. Lustucru\nwaited until they were gone; then he hurried out. When he reached the\nquay, in the joy of success, he began to whistle a dancing-tune and cut\ncapers; his transports resembled those of a cannibal who dances around\nhis victim.\n\n[Illustration: The Cat is thrown into the River.]\n\nHe went up the Seine as far as the bridge of Notre Dame, in the middle of\nwhich he halted, and holding the basket over the parapet, turned it\nsuddenly upside down, and launched the luckless Moumouth into the icy\nwaters of the river. The cat, in dropping through space, gave a cry that\nseemed to come from a human voice. The assassin shuddered, but his\nemotion did not last long. He thrust his hands into his pockets and said,\nin a tone of bitter mockery,--\n\n\"Pleasant voyage to you, dear Moumouth; endeavor to arrive all right! By\nthe way,\" added he, \"I think cats know how to swim; that brigand is\ncapable of getting himself out of this business. Bah! it is a long\ndistance from the bridge of Notre Dame to Saint-Thomas-du-Louvre!\"\n\nReassured by this reflection, Lustucru continued on his way home,\nre-entered by the door of the garden, climbed cautiously up to his room,\nand held himself in readiness to enjoy the lamentations of Mother\nMichel.\n\nMother Michel was detained some time by the porter; finally, she left\nhim, to give her cat the cup of milk and sugar with which she regaled him\nevery night.\n\nShe ascended to the parlor with measured steps, calmly, not anticipating\nany catastrophe. Failing to see Moumouth in the place he had occupied,\nshe simply believed that he had smuggled himself behind the cushions of\nthe sofa. She looked there, and beneath the sofa, and searched under the\nother pieces of furniture. Then, running to the staircase, she called:\n\"Moumouth! Moumouth!\"\n\n[Illustration: Mother Michel looks for the Cat.]\n\n\"He doesn't answer me,\" said she. \"But when I went down-stairs, Lustucru\nwas here; may be he can tell me what has become of the cat.\"\n\nShe knocked without delay at the door of the steward, who pretended to\nrouse himself from a deep slumber, and, in a gruff voice, demanded what\nwas wanted.\n\n\"Isn't Moumouth with you?\"\n\n\"Does your cat ever come where I am? You know very well that he can't\nbear me.\"\n\n\"Alas! where is he? I left him in the parlor, near the fire, and I cannot\nfind him.\"\n\n[Illustration: She knocks at the Steward's Door.]\n\n\"Can he be lost?\" said Father Lustucru, feigning the most lively\nanxiety.\n\n\"Lost! Oh, no, it is impossible! He is somewhere in the house.\"\n\n\"He ought to be found,\" said the villain, gravely. \"He ought to be\nsearched for this very instant. Moumouth is a precious animal, whose\nmerit makes it well worth while to wake up the servants.\"\n\nAll the inmates of the house were soon on foot, each armed with a candle.\nThey ransacked the nooks and corners, from the cellar to the garret, from\nthe court to the garden. Lustucru directed the operations with apparent\nzeal. After ineffectual searches, Mother Michel, exhausted by emotion and\nfatigue, threw herself helplessly into an arm-chair.\n\n[Illustration: Every Nook and Corner is ransacked.]\n\n\"Alas!\" said she, \"I left him only an instant, and it was to do a good\naction.\"\n\n\"I begin to believe that your cat is really lost,\" replied Lustucru, in a\nsevere tone. \"It is a great misfortune for you! What will Madame de la\nGrenouill\u00c3\u00a8re say when she comes back? She is capable of turning you out\nof doors!\"\n\n[Illustration: The Shock is too much for Mother Michel.]\n\n\"Turn me out of doors!\" cried Mother Michel, suddenly drawing herself up\nto her full height. Then she sunk down again, her face grew pallid, her\neyes closed, and she fell back without consciousness.\n\nFather Lustucru regarded her with a dry eye, and without feeling the\nslightest remorse. He laughed, the infamous man!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nIN WHICH THE CAT DISPLAYS INTELLIGENCE BEYOND\nHIS STATION IN LIFE, AND BEHAVES HANDSOMELY\nIN ADVERSITY.\n\n\nWe lost sight of Moumouth at the moment when, precipitated from the\nparapet of the bridge of Notre Dame, he found himself struggling in the\nwater.\n\nLuckily for him, the piles of the principal arch had a wide ledge, to\nwhich he was able to attach himself. From this place he cast a glance\naround him. The Seine appeared to him a boundless ocean, which it was\nbeyond his strength to cross; rather than attempt to reach the shores\nthat seemed to recede before him, he prepared to stay where he was, at\nthe risk of perishing with hunger or cold, or being swept away by a wave.\nHe mewed at first in sign of distress, but very soon, believing himself\nhopelessly lost, he judged it useless to tire his lungs, and awaited the\nend with a resignation which formed the basis of his character.\n\nToward five o'clock in the morning, two gentlemen from the island of\nSaint-Louis,--two very skillful amateur fishermen,--came to throw their\nlines from the top of the bridge of Notre Dame.\n\n\"You are early, neighbor Guignolet,\" said the person who arrived last;\n\"it appears that we have both had the same idea.\"\n\n\"And we have done well, neighbor Groquemouche; there was a rise in the\nriver last night, great numbers of fish have descended from the upper\nSeine, and one will have to be dreadfully awkward not to take them.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Agreed!\" said M. Guignolet.]\n\n\"Will you enter into an agreement, neighbor Guignolet? Let us fish in\npartnership, divide the catch, and dine together to-day.\"\n\n\"Agreed!\" said M. Guignolet, and as each held his line in his right hand,\nthey clasped their left hands together in token of the treaty.\n\nOn seeing the two cords descend Moumouth conceived some hope. As soon as\nthey were within his reach he grappled them, and the fishermen, feeling\nthe unusual weight, cried out with one voice, \"A bite! a bite!\" and\nhastened to haul in their lines.\n\n[Illustration: The Fishermen pursue the Cat.]\n\n\"I bet I have caught a wattle,\" said M. Guignolet, regretting that he\ncouldn't rub his hands together to testify his satisfaction.\n\n\"I must have an immense carp,\" replied M. Groquemouche. He had scarcely\nfinished the sentence when Moumouth leaped over the parapet.\n\n\"Treason!\" cried the two fishers, who started in pursuit of the quadruped\nthat had come so miraculously out of the water; but Moumouth ran faster\nthan they did and easily escaped them.\n\n[Illustration: Moumouth grapples the Lines.]\n\nWhen he was alone, he took breath, examined the houses, and, not finding\none that resembled his, naturally concluded that it was not there. It was\nnecessary, however, to find shelter; shivering with cold and panting with\nhis exertions, he could not remain a moment longer in the street without\nexposing himself to an inflammation of the chest. Guided by a light, he\nmade his way into the basement of a baker's shop, and, hiding himself\nbehind a pile of bread-baskets, went quietly to sleep.\n\nHe was awakened by hunger.\n\nMoumouth was born of poor parents who had abandoned him in his earliest\ninfancy; he had been brought up in the streets, obliged to procure his\nown living, and trained in the school of adversity. Thus he was very\nskillful in the art of catching rats and mice,--a useful art, too often\nneglected by cats belonging to the first families.\n\n[Illustration: The Imprudent Mouse.]\n\nHe placed himself on the watch, and surprised a mouse that had stolen out\nof its hole to eat some flour. He dropped upon the imprudent mouse, in\ndescribing what is called in geometry a parabola, and seized it by the\nnose, to prevent it from crying out. This feat, although performed with\naddress and in silence, attracted the attention of the baker's boy. \"Hi!\na cat!\" cried the apprentice, arming himself with a scoop.\n\n[Illustration: \"Don't hurt him!\" said the Baker.]\n\nThe master-baker turned his eyes towards Moumouth, saw him devouring the\nmouse, and said to the boy:--\n\n\"Don't hurt him; he is doing us a service.\"\n\n\"But where did he come from?\"\n\n\"What does that matter, provided he is useful here?\" answered the baker,\nwho was a man of intelligence. \"Eat, eat, my friend,\" he continued,\nstooping down to gently caress Moumouth; \"eat as many mice as possible,\nthere will always be enough left.\"\n\nOur cat profited by the permission accorded to him, and, having satisfied\nhis hunger, had a desire to set out in search of the mansion of Madame de\nla Grenouill\u00c3\u00a8re; but the baker barred the passage.\n\n[Illustration: Moumouth jumps out of the Window.]\n\n\"Wait a minute!\" he said. \"I wanted a good cat; Heaven sent me one, and I\nshall not forgive myself if I let him escape. Hulloo! Jacques, shut up\nall the openings, and if this rogue makes a show of running off, give him\nthree or four smart blows with the broom.\"\n\nThus the host of Moumouth became his tyrant; so true is it that personal\ninterest depraves the best natures. Our cat, as if comprehending what was\npassing, leaped without hesitation upon the shoulders of the baker's boy,\nand thence into the street.\n\n[Illustration: All the Street Dogs pursue Moumouth.]\n\nThere a new danger awaited him. Surprised by this unexpected apparition,\nan enormous bull-dog planted himself directly in front of Moumouth.\nMoumouth had a lively desire to avoid an unequal contest, but the dog\nkept an eye on him, and did not lose one of his movements, going to the\nright when Moumouth went to the left, and to the left when Moumouth moved\nto the right, and growled all the while in a malicious fashion. For an\ninstant they stood motionless, observing each other,--the dog with paws\nextended, teeth displayed, and body drawn back, and the cat with open\nmouth, his back arched and his head thrust forward.\n\n[Illustration: He meets a Bull-dog.]\n\nNeither seemed disposed to begin hostilities. Finally the dog rushed upon\nhis adversary, who avoided him adroitly, passed underneath him, and fled\nin the direction of the quay, the bull-dog giving chase. Away they went,\ndarting among the crowd of pedestrians and in and out between the\ncarriages. In a natural spirit of imitation, the wandering dogs that\nencountered them running joined in the race, and at the end of a minute\nMoumouth had more than thirty-seven dogs in pursuit of him.\n\n\"I am lost,\" he says to himself, \"but at least I shall sell my life\ndearly.\"\n\n[Illustration: He climbs a Wall.]\n\nHe backs against a wall, and braces himself haughtily on his feet; his\nteeth gnashing, his hair bristling, he faces his numerous enemies with\nso terrible an eye that they recoil like a single man. Profiting by their\nhesitation, he turns suddenly and scrambles to the top of the wall. He is\nsoon beyond the reach of the dogs, but he is not yet in safety; if he\nmakes a false step, if his strength gives out, if the plaster crumbles\nunder his claws, twenty yawning mouths, hungry for slaughter, are there\nto tear him to pieces!\n\nIn the meanwhile, Mother Michel had passed the night in lamentation. She\ncould not control her grief, for the loss of Moumouth; she called him\ncontinually in a plaintive voice, and--if we may credit the popular\nsong--the neighbors heard her cry at the window: \"Who will bring him back\nto me?\"\n\n[Illustration: Mother Michel laments.]\n\nThe next morning, at the rising of the smiling sun, the perfidious\nLustucru presented himself before Mother Michel in order to say to\nher:--\n\n\"Well, my dear companion, have you found him?\"\n\n\"Alas, no!\" she murmured. \"Have you any news of him?\"\n\n\"Nothing positive,\" replied the steward, who wished to torment the poor\nwoman; \"but I dreamed of him all night long; he appeared to me in a\ndream, with his face pale and an exhausted air, like a cat who did not\nfeel very well.\"\n\n[Illustration: Father Lustucru dreams.]\n\n\"In what place was he?\"\n\n\"He seemed to be in a garden, at the foot of a lilac-bush.\"\n\nMother Michel instantly ran to the garden, where, as you may imagine, she\ndid not find Moumouth.\n\nDuring the whole day Lustucru amused himself by giving her false\nexultations, which were followed by increased despondency.\n\n\"Mother Michel,\" said he, \"just now, in passing the store-room, I thought\nI heard a kind of meyowing.\"\n\nMother Michel hastened to visit the store-room.\n\nPresently he came to her out of breath, and said:--\n\n[Illustration: Illustration: Mother Michel encounters nothing but Rats.]\n\n\"We have him at last! I am nearly certain that he is rummaging in the\ncellar.\"\n\nAnd Mother Michel ventured into the gloomy vaults of the cellar, where\nshe encountered nothing but rats.\n\nIt was near the close of the day that Lustucru pronounced these words,\nwhich a popular song has happily preserved for us:--\n\n                      \"Oh, Mother Michel,\n                      Your cat is not lost;\n                      He is up in the garret\n                      A-hunting the rats,\n                      With his little straw gun\n                      And his sabre of wood!\"\n\nThe words were full of a bitter raillery, which Father Lustucru was\nunable to disguise. To pretend that Moumouth was hunting rats with his\nlittle straw gun and his wooden sword was to suppose something quite\nunlikely, for nobody ever saw a cat make use of such arms. But the\nagonies of Mother Michel had so confused her mind, that she noticed only\nwhat could give her a gleam of hope.\n\n\"He is in the garret!\" she cried, without paying attention to the rest of\nthe verse. \"Let us hasten there, my dear sir; let us search for him. Give\nme your arm, for I am so nervous, so troubled, so harassed by fatigue,\nthat I have not the strength to get up alone.\"\n\n[Illustration: She searches the Attic.]\n\nThe two mounted to the garret, and Mother Michel, lantern in hand,\nsearched in the attic and under the roof. Silence and solitude reigned\neverywhere.\n\n\"You are again mistaken,\" murmured Mother Michel.\n\n\"No, no,\" replied the malicious man; \"let us continue to hunt, we shall\nfinish by finding. We haven't looked there--behind those fagots.\"\n\nThe credulous Mother Michel advanced in the direction indicated, and--to\nthe great stupefaction of Lustucru--the cat, which he believed drowned,\nappeared in full health and strength, and fixed its gaze upon him\nindignantly.\n\n[Illustration: \"It is he! It is he!\" cried Mother Michel.]\n\n\"It is he! it is he!\" cried Mother Michel, seizing Moumouth in her arms.\n\"Ah, my dear Lustucru! my good and true friend, how I thank you for\nconducting me here!\"\n\nThe steward had scarcely any taste for compliments which he so little\nmerited. Pale-faced and cold, he hung his head before his victim, whose\npreservation he could not explain to himself. It was, however, a very\nsimple thing: Moumouth, pursued by the dogs, succeeded in leaping from\nthe wall, and, passing from gutter to gutter, from garden to garden, from\nroof to roof, had reached his domicile; but, dreading the resentment of\nhis enemy, he had not dared to appear, and had hidden himself in the\ngarret.\n\n\"Am I the dupe of a nightmare?\" said Father Lustucru to himself. \"Is it\nreally that rascal of a Moumouth that I have there under my eyes, in\nflesh and bone? Isn't it his ghost that has come back to torment me? This\ncat, then, is the evil one in person!\"\n\nThe cat was not the evil one--Providence had protected him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nIN WHICH THE CAT CONTENDS\nSUCCESSFULLY AGAINST\nHIS ENEMY.\n\n\nThe events we have recorded indicate very clearly the position of our\npersonages. Fearing to lose both the well-beloved cat and the advantages\nshe was ambitious to obtain, Mother Michel redoubled her vigilance and\nattention.\n\nMoumouth, knowing henceforth with whom he had to deal, promised himself\nto avoid the steward, or to fight him, if need be, with tooth and nail.\n\nAs to Father Lustucru, it was enough that his projects had been defeated,\nin order that he should persist in them with desperation. He now wished\nthe destruction of the poor and innocent cat, not only on account of his\njealousy of Mother Michel, but because he hated the cat itself.\n\n\"Oh, what humiliation!\" he said to himself, with bitterness. \"I ought to\nhide myself, retire to a desert, and bury me in the bowels of the earth!\nWhat! I, J\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00b4me Lustucru, a grown man, a man of knowledge and experience,\na man--I dare say it--charming in society, I am vanquished, scoffed at,\ntaken for a dupe, by a cat of the gutter!... I leave him at the bottom of\na river, and find him at the top of a house! I wish to separate him from\nhis guardian, and I am the means of bringing them together! I lead Mother\nMichel to the garret to torture her, and there I witness her transports\nof joy! The cat I believed dead reappears to defy me!... He shall not\ndefy me long!\"\n\nAnd Father Lustucru remained absorbed in deep meditation.\n\n[Illustration: Lustucru meditates.]\n\nMoumouth had not yet dined that day, and he made it plain by expressive\nmiauing that he would very willingly place something under his teeth.\nPresently, Mother Michel said to him--for she spoke to him as if he were\nan intelligent being,--\n\n\"Have patience, sir; we are going to attend to you.\"\n\nShe descended to the parlor, which she habitually occupied since the\ndeparture of Madame de la Grenouill\u00c3\u00a8re, and the cat, who accompanied\nMother Michel, was clearly displeased at seeing her take the road to the\nchamber of Lustucru. Nevertheless, he went in with her, persuaded that in\nthe presence of that faithful friend the steward would not dare to\nundertake anything against him.\n\nAt the moment she knocked at the door, Father Lustucru was taking from\nthe shelf a green package which bore this label: _Death to Rats_.\n\n\"This is the thing,\" he said to himself, thrusting the paper into his\nvest. \"_Death to Rats_ should also be _Death to Cats_. Our dear Moumouth\nshall make the trial.... What can one do to serve you, my good Mother\nMichel?\"\n\n\"It is five o'clock, M. Lustucru, and you forget my cat.\"\n\n[Illustration: The Green Package.]\n\n\"I forget him!\" cried the steward, clasping his hands as if very much\nhurt by the suspicion, \"I was just thinking of him.... I am going to\nprepare for him such a delicious hash that he will never want another!\"\n\n\"Thanks, Monsieur Lustucru! I shall inform Madame, the Countess, of your\ncare for her favorite. I have received a letter from her this very day;\nshe sends me word that she shall return shortly; that she hopes to find\nMoumouth in good condition, and that she has in reserve for me a very\nhandsome reward. You comprehend my joy, Monsieur Lustucru! My sister is\nleft a widow with four children, to whom I hand over my little savings\neach year. Until now this assistance has not been much; but, thanks to\nthe gifts of Madame, the Countess, the poor children will be able to go\nto school and learn a trade.\"\n\nIn pronouncing these words the eyes of Mother Michel were moist and\nbright with the most sweet joy,--that which one experiences in performing\nor meditating good actions. The steward, however, was not affected. He\nhad so given himself up to his evil passions that they completely\nmastered him, and had by degrees stifled all generous sentiments in his\nsoul, as the tares which one lets grow choke the good grain.\n\n[Illustration: \"Come, let us go!\"]\n\nOne would have said that Moumouth understood this man. The cat approached\nMother Michel, who had seated herself to chat awhile, and looking at her\nwith supplicating eyes, pulled at the skirt of her robe, as if to say to\nher:--\n\n\"Come, let us go!\"\n\n\"Take care!\" said the good creature, \"you will tear my dress.\"\n\nMoumouth began again.\n\n\"What is it? Do you want to get out of here?\" asked Mother Michel.\n\nMoumouth made several affirmative capers in the air.\n\n\"Decidedly,\" she added, \"this cat is not contented anywhere but in the\nparlor.\"\n\nShe rose and withdrew, preceded by Moumouth, who bounded with joy.\n\nA quarter of an hour afterward the steward had prepared a most appetizing\nhash composed of the breast of chicken, the best quality of bread, and\nother ingredients justly esteemed by dainty eaters. After adding a large\ndose of the \"Death to Rats,\" he set the hash down in an adjoining room,\nand, opening the parlor door, cried:\n\n\"Monsieur is served!!\"\n\n[Illustration: Moumouth is pleased to see the Hash.]\n\nOn beholding this delicate dish, Moumouth thrilled with pleasure, for, to\ntell the truth, he was rather greedy. He stretched his nose over the\nplate, and then suddenly retreated, arching his back. A sickening and\ninfectious odor had mounted to his nostrils. He made a tour round the\nplate, took another sniff, and again retreated. This animal, full of\nsagacity, had scented the poison.\n\n\"Well, that is very extraordinary,\" said Mother Michel; and, having\nvainly offered the food to her cat, she went to find Lustucru, to inform\nhim what had occurred.\n\n[Illustration: He sniffs with Disgust.]\n\nThe traitor listened with inward rage.\n\n\"What!\" said he, \"he has refused to eat it? It is probably because he is\nnot hungry.\"\n\n\"So I suppose, Monsieur Lustucru; for your hash looks very nice. I should\nlike it myself, and I've half a mind to taste it, to set Moumouth an\nexample.\" At this, Father Lustucru, in spite of his hardness, could not\nhelp trembling. For a minute he was horrified at his crime, and cried\nhastily:--\n\n[Illustration: \"Don't touch it, I beg of you.\"]\n\n\"Don't touch it, I beg of you!\"\n\n\"Why not? Is there anything wrong in the hash?\"\n\n\"No, certainly not,\" stammered Father Lustucru; \"but what has been\nprepared for a cat should not serve for a Christian. It is necessary to\nguard propriety, and not trifle with the dignity of human nature.\"\n\nMother Michel accepted this reasoning, and said, a little snappishly:--\n\n\"Very well; Moumouth may suit himself! I do not wish to yield to all his\nfancies, and I shall not give him anything else.\"\n\nThe following day the hash was still uneaten.\n\nThe steward had hoped that the cat, pressed by hunger, would have thrown\nhimself upon the poisoned food; but Moumouth knew how to suffer. He put\nup with abstinence, lived on scraps and crumbs of bread, and recoiled\nwith terror every time that his guardian offered him the fatal plate,\nwhich finally remained forgotten in a corner of the closet in the\nantechamber.\n\n[Illustration: The Fatal Plate remains forgotten.]\n\nFather Lustucru, seeing that his plot had not succeeded, was more\nirritable than ever. The desire to rid himself of Moumouth became a fixed\nidea with him, a passion, a monomania; he dreamed of it day and night.\nEach letter in which Madame de la Grenouill\u00c3\u00a8re demanded news of the cat\nand repeated her promise of recompense to Mother Michel, each sign of\ninterest given by the Countess to her two favorites, increased the blind\nfury of their enemy. He thought of the most infernal plans to demolish\nMoumouth without risk to himself, but none of them seemed sufficiently\nsafe and expeditious. Finally he decided on this one:--\n\n[Illustration: Louis XIV.]\n\nOn a heavy pedestal, in the chamber of Mother Michel, was a marble bust\nof Louis XIV., represented with a Roman helmet and a peruke interlaced\nwith laurel-leaves. Behind this bust was a round window, which looked\nupon the staircase; and just in front of the pedestal was the downy\ncushion that served as a bed for Moumouth, who would certainly have been\ncrushed if the bust had taken it into its head to topple over.\n\nOne night Lustucru stole noiselessly into the chamber of Mother Michel,\nopened the round window, which he was careful to leave ajar, and retired\nsilently. At midnight, when everybody was asleep in the house, he took\none of those long brooms, commonly called a wolf-head, placed himself on\nthe staircase opposite the small window, rested his back firmly against\nthe banister, and, with the aid of the wolf-head, pushed over the bust,\nwhich tumbled with a loud crash on the cushion beneath.\n\n[Illustration: Downfall of Louis XIV.]\n\nThe wicked man had expected this result of his movement; it was for him\nthe signal of his triumph and the death of Moumouth. However, when he\nheard the bust roll heavily on the floor, he was seized by a panic, and,\nwith trembling steps, regained his chamber. Mother Michel awoke with a\nstart; she was in complete darkness, and unable to procure a light, for\nGerman chemical matches were not yet invented. Surprise and fright had\ntaken away her faculties for an instant, then she cried, \"Stop thief!\"\nwith all the strength of her lungs. Very soon the whole house was roused,\nand all the servants came running in to learn what was the matter.\n\n[Illustration: Lustucru appears.]\n\nLustucru appeared last, with a cotton night-cap on his head, and, for the\nrest, very simply clad.\n\n\"What has happened?\" he demanded.\n\n\"I see now,\" answered Mother Michel; \"it is the bust of Louis XIV. that\nhas fallen down.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" said Father Lustucru, playing astonishment. \"But, in that case,\nyour cat must have received it on his head.\"\n\nAs he said these words, Moumouth came out from under the bed and threw\nhimself before Mother Michel, as if to implore her aid and protection.\nLustucru stood amazed.\n\n[Illustration: Moumouth comes forth.]\n\nEverybody knows how light is the slumber of cats. Moumouth, who had the\nhabit of sleeping with only one eye, had risen quickly on hearing a\nrustling behind the round window. Like nearly all animals, he was\ncurious, and sought to understand anything that astonished him; so he\ncamped himself in the middle of the chamber, the better to observe with\nwhat intention the wolf-head advanced at that unseasonable hour by so\nunusual a route. Startled by the fall of the bust, he had fled for refuge\nto the bottom of the alcove.\n\nThey gave Mother Michel, to revive her, a glass of sugar and water,\nflavored with orange-flower; they picked up the great king, who had\nsmashed his nose and chin, and lost half of his beautiful peruke; then\neverybody went to bed once more.\n\n\"Saved again!\" said Father Lustucru to himself. \"He always escapes me! I\nshall not be able, then, to send him to his fathers before the return of\nthe Countess! Mother Michel will get her pension of fifteen hundred\nlivres, and I shall remain a nobody, the same as before. That rascally\ncat distrusts me; everything I undertake alone against him fails....\nDecidedly, I must get somebody to help me!\"\n\n[Illustration: Mother Michel is revived.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nHOW FATHER LUSTUCRU CONFIDES HIS ODIOUS PLANS\nTO NICHOLAS FARIBOLE.\n\n\nFather Lustucru searched for an accomplice. He at first thought of\nfinding one among the domestics of the household; but he reflected that\nthey all were devoted to Mother Michel, and were capable of betraying\nhim, and causing him to be shamefully turned out of the mansion, in which\nhe held so honorable and lucrative a post. However, he had great desire\nfor an accomplice. In what class, of what age and sex, and on what terms\nshould he select one?\n\nOccupied with these thoughts, Lustucru went out one morning at about\nhalf-past six, to take a walk on the quay. As he crossed the threshold,\nhe noticed on the other side of the street a large woman, dry and\nangular, clothed in cheap, flashy colors. This woman had sunken eyes, a\ncopper-colored complexion, the nose of a bird of prey, and a face as\nwrinkled as an old apple. She was talking with a boy of thirteen or\nfourteen, covered with rags, but possessing a sharp, intelligent\ncountenance.\n\n[Illustration: The old Woman and the Boy.]\n\nFather Lustucru thought he recognized the old woman, but without\nrecalling where he had seen her. If he had been less occupied he would\nhave searched longer into his memory; but the idea of making away with\nthe cat absorbed him entirely, and he continued his route with a\nthoughtful air, his head bent forward, his arms crossed upon his breast,\nand his eyes fixed upon the ground, as if the accomplice he wanted might\npossibly spring up out of the earth.\n\nThus he wandered for some time; the breeze of the morning failed to cool\nhis blood, heated with evil passions. Neither the spectacle of the pure\nskies, nor the songs of the birds, who enjoyed themselves on the border\nof the river, awoke in him those calm and sweet emotions with which they\ninspire honest people.\n\n[Illustration: Lustucru is absorbed.]\n\nAt the moment when he returned, the old woman was no longer to be seen;\nbut the boy remained in the same place, seated upon a stone post, with\nhis nose in the air, regarding the mansion of Madame de la Grenouill\u00c3\u00a8re\nvery attentively. Lustucru approached him and addressed him in these\nterms:--\n\n\"What are you doing there, youngster?\"\n\n\"I? Nothing. I am looking at that mansion.\"\n\n\"I believe that without difficulty; but why do you look at it?\"\n\n\"Because I find it handsome, and would like to live in it; one ought to\nbe happy there.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" answered the steward, with emphasis; \"they pass the days\nthere happily enough. Who is that woman with whom you were speaking a\nwhile since?\"\n\n\"It was Madame Bradamor.\"\n\n[Illustration: The Boy on the Stone Post.]\n\n\"Madame Bradamor, the famous fortune-teller, who lives below, at the\nother end of the street?\"\n\n\"The same.\"\n\n\"You know her?\"\n\n\"A little; I sometimes do errands for her.\"\n\n\"Ah, ah!... And what did the old wizard say to you?\"\n\n\"She said that if I could enter that house as a domestic, I should have a\nvery agreeable existence.\"\n\n\"Madame de la Grenouill\u00c3\u00a8re is absent, my little friend, and, besides, her\nhouse is full.\"\n\n\"That is a pity,\" said the boy, drawing a deep sigh.\n\nFather Lustucru made several steps as if to re-enter, rested his hand\nupon the knocker of the door, then turned abruptly and walked up to the\nboy.\n\n\"What is your name?\"\n\n\"Nicholas Langlum\u00c3\u00a9, the same as my father's; but I am more generally\nknown under the nickname of Faribole.\"\n\n\"What do you do?\"\n\n\"Nothing; my father works on the quay, and I,--I live from day to day,\ngaining my bread as I can. I run errands, I sell May-bugs and black-birds\nand sparrows, I pick up nails in the gutters and sell them, I open the\ndoors of carriages, I fish for logs in the Seine, I sing verses in the\nstreets, I light lamps, and sometimes I play in the pantomimes at the\ntheatre of Nicolet. These trades, sir, are not worth much; and I have\nall I can do to get something to eat every day.\"\n\n\"You interest me,\" replied Father Lustucru, \"and I've a wish to help you\non in the world. Tell me, Faribole, have you a taste for cooking?\"\n\n\"Rather! I love the tid-bits, but my means do not allow me\"--\n\n\"I did not ask you if you were fond of eating, stupid! I asked you if you\nhad the taste, the inclination, to do cooking.\"\n\n\"I don't know; I never tried.\"\n\n[Illustration: The Steward engages Faribole.]\n\n\"Well, then, Faribole, I will give you lessons. Come, follow me; I will\nclothe you and take care of you at my own expense, in awaiting the\narrival of Madame de la Grenouill\u00c3\u00a8re. She is a good lady, and will\ndoubtless retain you; but if she does not, your education will be\ncommenced, and you'll be able to place yourself elsewhere.\"\n\n\"You are, then, in the service of the Countess?\"\n\n\"I am her steward,\" said Father Lustucru, with dignity.\n\nThe eyes of Faribole sparkled with pleasure; he bowed respectfully before\nthe steward, and said with warmth:--\n\n\"Ah, how much I owe to you!\"\n\n[Illustration: A little awkward at first.]\n\nFaribole was installed that same day, and cordially received by the other\nservants of the household. He was a good-natured boy, serviceable and\nquick, and, although a little awkward in his new clothes and at his new\nduties, he showed plenty of willingness.\n\n\"Faribole,\" said the steward to his prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9, several days afterward, \"It\nis well to let you know the ways of the house. There is an individual\nhere, all-powerful, who reigns as sovereign master, whose will is obeyed,\nwhose whims are anticipated,--and that individual is a cat. If you wish\nto make your way in the world, it is necessary to seek to please\nMoumouth; if the cat Moumouth accords you his affections, you will also\nhave that of Madame de la Grenouill\u00c3\u00a8re and her companion, Mother\nMichel.\"\n\n[Illustration: The Cat and the Boy become Friends.]\n\n\"The cat shall be my friend, and I will be the friend of the cat,\"\nresponded the young fellow, confidently.\n\nIn effect, he showered on Moumouth so many kindnesses and caresses and\nattentions, that the cat, although naturally suspicious, conceived a\nlively attachment for Faribole, followed him with pleasure, teased him,\nand invited him to frolics. Mother Michel was nearly jealous of the small\nboy; Father Lustucru, who had ideas of his own, laughed in his sleeve,\nand rubbed his hands together.\n\nThe steward, one evening, ordered Faribole to come to his chamber, and\nafter closing the door carefully and assuring himself that no one was\nlistening, he said:--\n\n\"Moumouth is your friend; you have followed my recommendations exactly.\"\n\n\"I shall remain in the house--is it not so?\"\n\n\"Probably. You find yourself very well here?\"\n\n\"Without doubt! I, who lived on black bread, I make four good meals a\nday. I had a wretched blouse, full of holes, and patched trousers, and\nnow I am dressed like a prince. I suffer no more from cold, and, instead\nof lying out under the stars, I go to sleep every night in a comfortable\nbed, where I dream of gingerbread and fruit-cake.\"\n\nFather Lustucru rested his chin on the palm of his right hand, and fixing\nhis piercing eyes upon Faribole, said to him:--\n\n\"Suppose you were obliged to take up again with the vagabond life from\nwhich I lifted you?\"\n\n\"I believe I should die with shame!\"\n\n\"Then you would do anything to preserve your present position?\"\n\n\"I would do anything.\"\n\n[Illustration: Lustucru and Faribole.]\n\n\"Anything?\"\n\n\"Anything, absolutely.\"\n\n\"Very well. Now, this is what I demand of you imperatively: Moumouth\nfollows you willingly; to-morrow, just at night-fall, you will lead him\ninto the garden; you will put him into a sack which I have made\nexpressly, and tightly draw the cords of the sack\"--\n\n\"And then?\" said Faribole, who opened his eyes wide.\n\n\"We will each arm us with a stick, and we will beat upon the sack until\nhe is dead.\"\n\n\"Never! never!\" cried the poor boy, whose hair stood up with fright.\n\n\"Then pack your bundle quickly, and be off; I turn you away!\"\n\n\"You turn me away!\" repeated young Faribole, lifting up his hands to the\nsky.\n\n\"I do not give you five minutes to be gone; you depend upon me here,\nsolely on me.\"\n\nThe unhappy Faribole began to weep, and the steward added, in a savage\nvoice,--\n\n\"Come, now! no faces! Take off your clothes, and put on your rags, and\ndisappear!\"\n\nHaving pronounced these words, Lustucru took from a closet the miserable\nvestments which Faribole had worn the day of his installation. The\nsteward seized them disdainfully between his thumb and forefinger, and\nthrew them upon the floor.\n\n[Illustration: Faribole's Old Clothes.]\n\nThe boy looked with an air of despair at the habits he had on, compared\nthem with those which he was obliged to resume, and the comparison was so\nlittle to the advantage of the latter, that he broke into loud sobs.\n\nHowever, he was decided not to purchase handsome clothes at the price of\na perfidy and a horrible murder. He resolutely threw off his vest, then\nhis neckerchief; but at the idea of giving up his new shoes, of walking\nbarefoot, as formerly, over roads paved with gravel and broken glass, the\nluckless Faribole had a moment of hesitation.\n\nFather Lustucru, who observed him closely, profited by this circumstance\nwith consummate cunning.\n\n\"Foolish fellow!\" said he; \"you refuse happiness when it would be so easy\nfor you to retain it. If I proposed to you the death of a man, I could\nunderstand, I could even approve of your scruples; but I propose that of\na cat--a simple cat! What do you find in that so terrible? What is a cat?\nNothing--less than nothing; one doesn't attach the least value to the\nlives of cats. Inn-keepers give them to their customers to eat; the most\ncelebrated surgeons massacre them in making certain experiments. Cats are\nthought so little of, that when a litter of six or seven are born, only\none is kept; the rest are tossed into the river.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Only one is kept; the rest are tossed into the River.\"]\n\n\"But Moumouth is large, Moumouth is fully grown,\" said Faribole in a\nplaintive tone; \"and then, you do not know, I love him.\"\n\n\"You love him! you dare to love him!\" cried the steward with\ninexpressible rage. \"Very well! I--I detest him, and I wish his death!\"\n\n\"But what has he done to you, then?\"\n\n\"What business is that to you? I desire his death, and that's enough.\"\n\n\"Mercy for him!\" cried Faribole, throwing himself at the feet of\nhard-hearted Lustucru.\n\n[Illustration: \"Get up! Depart!\"]\n\n\"No mercy!\" replied Lustucru, hissing the words through his clenched\nteeth. \"No mercy, neither for him nor for you. Get up, depart, be off\nthis very instant! It rains in torrents; you will be drenched, you will\ndie of cold this night,--so much the better!\"\n\nA beating rain, mixed with hailstones, pattered against the window-panes,\nand the wind swept with a mournful sound through the halls of the house.\nThen poor Faribole thought of the cold that would seize him, of the\nprivations which awaited him, of his few resources, of his immense\nappetite, and how disagreeable it was to sleep on the damp earth. His\nevil genius took possession of him, and whispered into his ear these\nwords of Father Lustucru: \"What is a cat?\"\n\n\"Monsieur Lustucru,\" said he, weeping, \"do not send me away, I will do\nall that you wish.\"\n\n\"To-morrow, at night-fall, you will lead Moumouth into the garden?\"\n\n\"Yes, Monsieur Lustucru.\"\n\n\"You will put him into this sack?\"\n\n\"Yes, Monsieur Lustucru.\"\n\n\"And you will beat it with me?\"\n\nThe response to this question was long coming; Faribole turned pale, his\nlegs bent under him; finally he bowed his head, letting his arms droop at\nhis sides, as if he had sunk under the weight of his destiny, and\nmurmured, in a stifled voice:--\n\n\"Yes, Monsieur Lustucru.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nIN WHICH FATHER LUSTUCRU IS ON THE POINT OF\nACCOMPLISHING HIS PURPOSE, AND MOTHER MICHEL'S\nCAT IS IN AN UNPLEASANT PREDICAMENT.\n\n\nLustucru had fixed the following day for the cruel execution of Moumouth,\nfor he knew that Mother Michel on that day was to carry to the express\noffice a package destined for her sister.\n\nAll the forenoon and afternoon Faribole was plunged in the darkest\ndespondency, and when the fatal hour sounded, he was assailed by the\nirresolutions of the previous day. When Mother Michel, before going out,\nsaid to him, \"I leave Moumouth in your charge; you must take care of him,\nand make him play, so that he will not fret too much during my absence,\"\nthe poor lad felt his heart fail, and his natural loyalty revolted.\n\n\"Come, we have not a minute to lose,\" said Father Lustucru to Faribole;\n\"here is the sack; go look for the beast!\"\n\nFaribole once more appealed to the pity of the steward; he was eloquent,\nhe had tears in his voice, he pronounced a most touching plea, but\nwithout being able to gain his cause. The executioner was immovable; he\ninsisted on the death of the cat; and the boy, overpowered by this evil\nspirit, saw himself forced to obey.\n\nMoumouth allowed himself to be enticed into the garden; he followed his\ntreacherous friend with the confidence of the lamb following the butcher,\nand, at the very moment when he least thought of it, he found himself\nfastened in the sack that was to be his tomb. Lustucru, who was hiding,\nappeared suddenly, bearing two enormous cudgels; he handed one to his\naccomplice, and taking hold of the sack, cried:--\"Now!--to work, and no\nquarter!\"\n\nFaribole heard him not; the boy was struck with stupor--his eyes rolled\nwildly in their sockets, his face was livid, his mouth open, his arms\nwithout strength.\n\nFather Lustucru, animated by the nearness of his vengeance, did not\nremark what passed in the mind of his companion. Having thrown the sack\nrudely on the ground, the steward lifted his cudgel, and was about to\nstrike when the small door of the garden opened.\n\n\"How unfortunate!\" he muttered; \"Faribole, hide yourself in the hedge; I\nwill come back here presently.\"\n\n[Illustration: The Steward lifted his Cudgel.]\n\nHe approached the person who had entered, and halted, petrified with\namazement, on beholding Mother Michel. He imagined at first that she had\nbeen brought back by some vague suspicion, by some presentiment; but he\nrecovered himself, hearing her say:--\n\n\"I am obliged to postpone my walk, for I have seen Madame de la\nGrenouill\u00c3\u00a8re's carriage coming; it turned out of its way on account of\nthe repairs being made in the street. By reentering through the garden I\nwas able to get here in advance. Come, Monsieur Lustucru, let us hasten\nto receive our good mistress.\"\n\n\"I am with you, madame,\" said the steward; then, making a\nspeaking-trumpet of his hand, he cried to Faribole:--\n\n[Illustration: Making a Speaking-trumpet of his Hand.]\n\n\"Strike all alone! strike until the cat has ceased to move!\" and he\nrejoined Mother Michel in the court, where the domestics were drawn up in\na line like a well-drilled battalion.\n\nOn stepping from the carriage Madame de la Grenouill\u00c3\u00a8re honored her\nservitors with a benevolent glance, embraced Mother Michel with touching\nfamiliarity, and demanded news of Moumouth.\n\n[Illustration: The Countess embraces Mother Michel.]\n\n\"Your prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9 is wonderfully well,\" said Mother Michel, \"he grows fatter\nand handsomer under our very eyes; but it may be said, without injury to\nthe truth, that his moral qualities are even beyond his physical\ncharms.\"\n\n\"Poor friend, if he does not love me he will be a monster of ingratitude,\nfor since our separation I have thought of him constantly; Heaven has\ntaken away many beings that were dear to me, but Moumouth will be the\nconsolation of my old age!\"\n\nAs soon as the Countess had given the orders which her arrival made\nnecessary, she prayed Mother Michel to fetch Moumouth.\n\n\"He will be charmed to see you again, madame,\" Mother Michel answered;\n\"he is in the garden in the care of Faribole, a little young man whom\nyour steward judged proper to admit to the house; the young rogue and\nthe cat have become a pair of intimate friends.\"\n\n[Illustration: Faribole seated in the Garden.]\n\nMother Michel went down to the garden and there found Faribole alone,\nseated upon a bench, and with a preoccupied air stripping the leaves from\na branch of boxwood which he held in his hand.\n\n\"My friend,\" said the good woman, \"Madame, the Countess, desires you to\nbring Moumouth to her.\"\n\n\"Moumouth!\" stammered Faribole, starting at the name as if he had been\nstung by a wasp.\n\n\"Yes, Moumouth; I thought he was with you.\"\n\n\"He just quitted me; some persons passing in the street made a noise that\nfrightened him, and he leaped into the hedge.\"\n\nMother Michel, after having spent more than half an hour in scouring the\ngarden, returned to Madame de la Grenouill\u00c3\u00a8re and said: \"Moumouth is\nabsent, madame; but do not be anxious; he disappeared once before, and we\nfound him in the garret.\"\n\n\"Let him be searched for! I do not wish to wait. I desire to see him this\ninstant!\"\n\nAlas! this desire was not likely to be gratified, if any reliance could\nbe placed upon the words exchanged in the dark between Lustucru and his\naccomplice.\n\n\"Well, did you do it?\"\n\n\"Yes, Monsieur Lustucru, I pounded until the cat ceased to move.\"\n\n\"What have you done with the body?\"\n\n\"I have thrown it into the Seine.\"\n\n\"Was he quite dead?\"\n\n\"He didn't stir.\"\n\n\"Anyway, the sack was securely fastened. Justice is done!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nIN WHICH MOTHER MICHEL SEARCHES FOR HER CAT.\n\n\nSeveral days passed in painful expectation; but the cat, like General\nMarlborough, did not come back. The despair of Madame de la Grenouill\u00c3\u00a8re\nwas sincere, profound, and silent,--all the more intense because it was\nsuppressed. She continually pictured to herself the charming ways of\nMoumouth, his natural goodness, his superior intelligence. No animal had\never displayed to her so many brilliant qualities; not one of her\nprevious favorites had ever caused her such bitter regrets.\n\nGenerous in her misfortune, she did not reproach Mother Michel; on the\ncontrary, the Countess sought to comfort that poor woman, who had given\nherself up wholly to grief. The Countess said to her one night:--\n\n\"What can you do against an irresistible calamity? The wisdom of man\nconsists not in struggling with unhappiness, but in submitting himself\nto the will of Heaven.\"\n\n\"I am of your opinion,\" replied Mother Michel. \"If I believed, like you,\nin the death of Moumouth, I would resign myself without a murmur. But I\nhave the idea that he still lives; I picture him running through the\nstreets, the victim of ill treatment, with saucepans, may be\"--\n\n\"Go to, Mother Michel, you deceive yourself; Moumouth is dead, otherwise\nhe would have come back to us.\"\n\n\"Something tells me that he is still in this world, and if Madame the\nCountess wishes to have tidings of him, she has only to address\nherself\"--\n\n\"To whom?\"\n\n\"To our neighbor, Madame Bradamor, that celebrated fortune-teller, who\npredicts the future, removes freckles, reads in the Book of Destinies,\nand charms away the toothache.\"\n\n\"Fie, Mother Michel! how can you, a sensible woman, have any confidence\nin the juggling of an adventuress?\"\n\n\"But, madame, I am not alone; the most distinguished people go to Madame\nBradamor; she is more learned and less dear than her rivals, and asks\nonly ten crowns to make you behold the devil Astaroth.\"\n\n\"Enough, for pity's sake!\" responded the Countess, dryly.\n\nMother Michel remained silent; but she had made up her mind, and, the\nfirst time she had a moment of liberty, she ran to the house of the\nnecromancer.\n\nThe fortune-teller occupied a spacious apartment richly furnished, for\nshe gained a great deal of money by cheating the public. Her\nconsultation-room was draped with hangings of black velvet sprinkled with\ngilt stars; upon a square table, in the centre of the chamber, stood\npainted tin obelisks, jars of electricity, retorts, and divers\nmathematical instruments, of whose uses the pretended sorceress was quite\nignorant, but which she had placed there in order to impose on the\nweak-minded persons who came to consult her.\n\nShe at first showed some embarrassment on beholding Mother Michel;\nhowever, after having closed a glass door which communicated with the\nother apartments, she returned to salute her new client, and said in a\nsolemn tone:--\n\n\"What is your desire?\"\n\n\"To question the present, the past, and the future.\"\n\n\"I am the very one to satisfy you,\" replied Madame Bradamor; \"but what\nyou demand is very difficult, and will cost you three crowns.\"\n\n\"There they are; I give them to you with all my heart.\"\n\nMadame Bradamor, full of regret that she had not insisted on having more,\npocketed the money, and began in these terms:--\n\n\"What is the date of your birth?\"\n\n\"The 24th of May, 1698.\"\n\n\"What are the initials of your name and the first letter of the place in\nwhich you were born?\"\n\n[Illustration: Mother Michel pays Three Crowns.]\n\n\"A, R, M, N, L, S.\"\n\nMadame Michel was named Anastasie Ravegot; the widow, since twelve years,\nof Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Michel, in life inspector of butter in the Paris markets; she\nwas born in Noisy-le-Sec.\n\n\"What is your favorite flower?\"\n\n\"The Jerusalem artichoke.\"\n\nAfter these customary questions, the fortune-teller examined some\ncoffee-grounds poured into a saucer, and said:--\n\n\"Phaldarus, the genie of things unknown, informs me that you are in\nsearch of a being very dear to you.\"\n\nMother Michel bounded in her chair with surprise.\n\nMadame Bradamor continued: \"This being is not a man; it is a\nquadruped--either a dog or a cat. Ariel, spirit celestial, reveals to me\nthat it is a cat.\"\n\nMother Michel was more and more impressed; without giving her time to\nrecover herself, the fortune-teller took a pack of cards, shuffled them,\ncut them three times, then disposed them in a systematic order on the\ntable, and said gravely:--\n\n\"Your cat is the knave of clubs; let us see what happens to him. One,\ntwo, three, four; ten of spades! He is a wanderer, he has a passion for\ntravel, he sets out at night to see the curiosities of Paris. One, two,\nthree, four; the queen of spades! It is a woman who manufactures ermine\nfur out of cat-skin. One, two, three, four; the knave of spades! It is a\nrag-picker. One, two, three, four; the king of spades! It is a\nrestaurant-keeper. The falling together of these three persons alarms me.\nOne, two, three, four,--clubs! One, two, three, four,--clubs again! One,\ntwo, three, four,--always clubs. Your cat would bring money to these\nthree persons: the rag-picker wishes to kill him in order to sell the\nskin to the furrier, and the body to the restaurant-keeper, who will\nserve it up to his customers as stewed rabbit. Will the cat be able to\nresist his persecutors. One, two, three, four; seven of spades! It is all\nover, madame; your cat no longer exists!\"\n\n[Illustration: The Fortune-teller consults her Cards.]\n\n\"They have eaten him, the cannibals!\" cried Mother Michel, sinking back,\nand she fancied she heard a plaintive _miau_, the last agonized cry of\nMoumouth. But it was not an illusion; a cat had miaued, and was still\nmiauing in the next chamber. Suddenly a pane of glass in the door\ndescribed was shivered to atoms, and Moumouth in person tumbled at the\nfeet of Mother Michel.\n\n[Illustration: Moumouth appears.]\n\nFrom the top of a wardrobe he had perceived his affectionate guardian; he\nhad called to her several times, and as she did not answer him, he had\nthrown himself, in his desperation, against the glass door, through which\nhe had broken a passage.\n\n\"My cat was with you!\" said Mother Michel; \"you have stolen him! My\nmistress is powerful; my mistress is the Countess Yolande de la\nGrenouill\u00c3\u00a8re; she will have you chastised as you deserve to be!\"\n\nWhile making these threats Mother Michel placed Moumouth under her arm,\nand prepared to depart. Madame Bradamor stopped her, saying:--\n\n\"Do not ruin me, I conjure you! I have not stolen your cat!\"\n\n\"How is it in your house, then?\"\n\n\"I have it from a little boy named Faribole; he got this cat for me,\nwhich I have long desired to have, on account of his supernatural shape\nand appearance, to figure in my cabalistic conjurations. This is the\ntruth, the whole truth. I beg of you that your mistress will not disturb\nme.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Do not ruin me, I conjure you!\"]\n\n\"Madame the Countess will act as she thinks proper,\" responded Mother\nMichel, haughtily; and she vanished with her cat.\n\nShe made but one step from the house of Madame Bradamor to that of Madame\nde la Grenouill\u00c3\u00a8re; one would have said that Mother Michel had on the\nseven-league boots of little Tom Thumb. She did not linger in the parlor,\nwhen she arrived out of breath and unable to speak a word, but carried\nMoumouth straight to the Countess.\n\nOn recognizing the animal, the Countess gave so loud a cry of joy that it\nwas heard as far as the Place de la Carrousel.\n\nLustucru assisted at this touching scene. At the sight of the cat he was\nso dumbfounded that his reason wavered for a moment. He imagined that the\ncat, so many times saved, was a fantastic being, capable of speaking,\nlike the beasts in the fairy-tales, and he said to himself with a shiver:\n\"I am lost! Moumouth is going to denounce me!\"\n\n[Illustration: Lustucru assisted at this touching Scene.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nWHICH IS SATISFACTORY TO EVERYBODY BUT THE\nGUILTY.\n\n\nAs soon as Madame de la Grenouill\u00c3\u00a8re learned how Moumouth had been\nrecovered, she ordered young Faribole to be brought before her.\n\n\"I'll go and look him up,\" said Father Lustucru, with alacrity. He was\nvery anxious to warn his accomplice, and sought an excuse to steal off.\n\n\"No, remain! You have admitted him to the mansion, you shall see him\nturned away, and will learn to bestow your confidence more wisely in\nfuture.\"\n\nLustucru remained, and, recovering from his first stupor, resolved to\nboldly deny everything, if Faribole should dare to accuse him.\n\nIntroduced into the parlor, Faribole did not wait to be interrogated.\n\n[Illustration: Faribole Explains.]\n\n\"Madame the Countess,\" said he, \"the presence of your cat tells me why\nyou have called me; but I am less guilty than I appear; permit me to\nexplain.\"\n\n\"It is useless,\" replied Madame de la Grenouill\u00c3\u00a8re; \"your justification\nis impossible.\"\n\nThe steward, believing it best to play a bold game, said with irony:--\n\n\"I am curious to know what unlikely story this rogue has to tell,\" and in\naccenting these words slowly he gave Faribole a glance which signified:\n\"If you accuse me, woe to you!'\"\n\nWithout allowing himself to be confused, Faribole commenced in these\nterms:--\n\n\"It is necessary to avow it, madame; I entered into your service with the\nintention of stealing your cat; the fortune-teller wished to have him, to\nmake him play the part of the devil Astaroth; and she had seduced me by\nthe promise of a crown of six livres and a pair of shoes. They treated me\nso well, and Moumouth appeared to me so charming, that I renounced my\nwicked plans; I never, no, never would have put them into execution, if I\nhad not found it was necessary to get Moumouth out of the way in order to\nrescue him from the attacks of an enemy all the more terrible because he\nwas hidden.\"\n\n\"Of whom does he wish to speak?\" demanded Lustucru.\n\n\"Of you! of you who have said to me, 'Kill Moumouth, or I chase you from\nthe house!'\"\n\n\"I, I have said that! what an impudent falsehood! Ah, Madame the\nCountess, you know me well enough not to hesitate between the\ndeclarations of this fellow and my flat denial.\"\n\n\"Faribole,\" said the Countess severely, \"your charge is grave; can you\nbring any proof to support it?\"\n\n\"Proof, alas! no, madame; but I am ready to swear to you\"--\n\n\"Enough,\" interrupted the Countess; \"do not add calumny to the theft of\nthe cat, but deliver me of your presence.\"\n\n[Illustration: Faribole is treated Roughly on the Staircase.]\n\nThe miserable Faribole wished to protest, but at a sign from Madame de la\nGrenouill\u00c3\u00a8re, Lustucru seized him by the arm, led him through the door\nwithout further ceremony, and treated him in so rough a manner on the\nstaircase as to quite relieve him of any idea of asking for his personal\neffects.\n\nHowever, the iniquities of the steward were not to remain long\nunpunished; that same day, Mother Michel, in arranging the closet in the\nantechamber, was very much astonished at finding the bodies of several\ndead rats and mice; she was wondering what had caused their death, when\nshe recognized the famous hash that the cat had refused to eat, and which\nhad been left there by mistake. Two mice were dead in the plate itself,\nso powerful and subtile was the poison!\n\nThis discovery tore away the veil which covered the past of Lustucru.\nMother Michel, divining that the charges of Faribole were well founded,\nhastened to inform Madame de la Grenouill\u00c3\u00a8re, who recommended her to keep\nsilent, and sent for the steward.\n\n\"Have you still the 'Death to Rats?'\" she asked him.\n\n\"Yes, madame, I think I have a little left.\"\n\n\"Some should be placed in the antechamber; you have not thought of that\nbefore?\"\n\n\"Never, madame; I did not know there were rats in that part of the\nhouse.\"\n\n\"Very well; you can retire.\"\n\n[Illustration: A Celebrated Chemist analyzes the Hash.]\n\nMadame de la Grenouill\u00c3\u00a8re wrote to a celebrated chemist, who, after\nhaving analyzed the hash, declared that it contained a prodigious\nquantity of poison.\n\nThe crime of Lustucru was then evident; but other proofs were not long in\nrising against him. The adventure of Groquemouche and Guignolet was\ntalked about among the boatmen; Faribole heard the story from one of\nthem, and discovered a person who had seen Lustucru throw Moumouth from\nthe bridge of Notre Dame.\n\n[Illustration: The Fate of the Steward.]\n\nThe steward, confounded, did not wait to be discharged; he fled, and, to\nescape the vengeance of Madame de la Grenouill\u00c3\u00a8re, embarked as cook on\nboard of a merchant vessel bound for Oceanica.\n\nIt was afterward learned that this ship had been wrecked upon the\nSandwich Islands, and that the savages had eaten Lustucru. History\nrecords that at the moment of expiring he pronounced but a single word,\nthe name of Moumouth!\n\n[Illustration: Lustucru flies.]\n\nWhat was it that brought this name to the lips of the guilty man? Was it\nremorse? or was it the last explosion of an unforgiving hatred? This is\nwhat history has neglected to inform us.\n\nThe health of Madame de la Grenouill\u00c3\u00a8re had been altered by the heavy\nshocks she had experienced in losing her favorite animals. The tenderness\nand graces of Moumouth would perhaps have been sufficient to attach her\nto life; but the respectable lady had reached an age when sorrows press\nvery heavily. Mother Michel had the grief, one morning, to find the\nCountess dead in her bed; her face was so calm and bore so plainly the\nimpress of all her lovable qualities, that one would have believed she\nslept. She was nearly in her seventy-ninth year.\n\nBy her will, which she had deposited with her lawyer, she had left to\nMoumouth and Mother Michel an income of two thousand livres, to revert,\nin case of the death of either, to the survivor.\n\nMother Michel took up her residence near her sister, provided handsomely\nfor all the children, and selected for her own retreat a pretty cottage\nsituated in Low-Breton upon the banks of the river among the green\ntrees.\n\n[Illustration: Mother Michel's Cottage.]\n\nFaribole, received again into the service of Madame de la Grenouill\u00c3\u00a8re,\nconducted himself so well that his transient error was forgotten. He\nwould have been able to distinguish himself in the kitchen, but he\npreferred to serve the State, and enlisted at the age of sixteen in an\ninfantry regiment. He took part in the expedition against Majorca under\nthe command of Marshal Richelieu, and was named corporal after the\ncapture of Port-Mahon, June the 29th, 1756. When he obtained his\ndischarge, he returned to live near Mother Michel, for whom he had an\naffection truly filial. To the agitations of their existence succeeded\ncalm and happy days, embellished by the constantly increasing graces of\nMoumouth.\n\nOur cat henceforth was without an enemy; he won, on the contrary, the\nesteem and affection of all who knew him. His adventures had made him\nquite famous. Besides the ballad,--of which, unfortunately, only two\ncouplets have been preserved,--the poets of the period wrote in his honor\na large number of verses that have not come down to us. He received\nvisits from the most distinguished men of the time, even from the King\nhimself, who once, on his way to the Chateau of Bellevue, dropped in for\na moment on Moumouth.\n\nA grand lady of the court condescended to choose for Moumouth a very\ngentle and very pretty companion, whom he accepted with gratitude. In\nseeing himself a father Moumouth's happiness was at its highest, as was\nalso that of Mother Michel, who felt that she lived again in the\nposterity of her cat.\n\nYou wish to know what finally became of Moumouth? He died,--but it was\nnot until after a long and joyous career. His eyes, in closing, looked\nwith sweet satisfaction upon groups of weeping children and\ngrandchildren. His mortal remains were not treated like those of ordinary\ncats. Mother Michel had built for him a magnificent mausoleum of white\nmarble. Following a custom then adopted at the burial of all illustrious\npersonages, they engraved upon the tomb of Moumouth an epitaph in Latin,\ncomposed by a learned professor of the University of Paris.\n\n[Illustration: Moumouth and his Family.]\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE STORY OF A CAT***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 27472-8.txt or 27472-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/2\/7\/4\/7\/27472\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/about\/contact\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":727,"split":"train"}
