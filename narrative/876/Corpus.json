{"ori_id":"cb5468ec85bb82131dad276d2bdf82161d607aba","title":"L'Assommoir","context":"L'Assommoir\n The novel is essentially the story of Gervaise Macquart, who was featured briefly in the first novel in the series, La Fortune des Rougon, running away to Paris with her shiftless lover Lantier to work as a washerwoman in a hot, busy laundry in one of the seedier areas of the city. L'Assommoir begins with Gervaise and her two young sons being abandoned by Lantier, who takes off for parts unknown; she later takes up with Coupeau, a teetotal roofing engineer, and they are married in one of the most famous set-pieces of Zola's fiction; the account of the wedding party's chaotic trip to the Louvre is perhaps the novelist's most famous passage. Through a combination of happy circumstances Gervaise is able to raise enough money to open her own laundry, and the couple's happiness appears to be complete with the birth of a daughter, Anna, nicknamed Nana (the protagonist of Zola's later novel of the same title).\nThe second half of the novel deals with the downward trajectory of Gervaise's life from this happy high point. Coupeau is injured in a fall from the roof of a new hospital he is working on, and during his lengthy and painful convalescence he takes to drink. Only a few chapters pass before Coupeau is a vindictive alcoholic, with no intention of trying to find more work; Gervaise struggles to keep her home together, but her excessive pride leads her to a number of embarrassing failures and before long everything is going downhill. The home is further disrupted by the return of Lantier, warmly welcomed by Coupeau\u2014by this point losing interest in both Gervaise and life itself, and becoming seriously ill\u2014and the ensuing chaos and financial strain is too much for Gervaise, who loses her laundry-shop and is sucked into debt. She decides to join Coupeau in the drinking and soon slides into heavy alcoholism too, prompting Nana\u2014already suffering from the chaotic life at home and getting into trouble on a daily basis\u2014to run away from her parents' home and become a streetwalker. The novel continues in this unhappy vein until Gervaise dies.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of L'Assommoir, by Emile Zola\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

For the last week when they came out of the\nVeau a Deux Tetes, where they ate, he had sent her off to bed with the\nchildren and had not appeared until late into the night and always\nwith a story that he had been looking for work.\n\nThis very night, while she was watching for his return, she fancied\nshe saw him enter the ballroom of the Grand-Balcon, whose ten windows\nblazing with lights illuminated, as with a sheet of fire, the black\nlines of the outer boulevards. She caught a glimpse of Adele, a pretty\nbrunette who dined at their restaurant and who was walking a few steps\nbehind him, with her hands swinging as if she had just dropped his\narm, rather than pass before the bright light of the globes over the\ndoor in his company.\n\nWhen Gervaise awoke about five o'clock, stiff and sore, she burst into\nwild sobs, for Lantier had not come in. For the first time he had\nslept out. She sat on the edge of the bed, half shrouded in the canopy\nof faded chintz that hung from the arrow fastened to the ceiling by a\nstring. Slowly, with her eyes suffused with tears, she looked around\nthis miserable _chambre garnie_, whose furniture consisted of a\nchestnut bureau of which one drawer was absent, three straw chairs\nand a greasy table on which was a broken-handled pitcher.\n\nAnother bedstead--an iron one--had been brought in for the children.\nThis stood in front of the bureau and filled up two thirds of the\nroom.\n\nA trunk belonging to Gervaise and Lantier stood in the corner wide\nopen, showing its empty sides, while at the bottom a man's old hat lay\namong soiled shirts and hose. Along the walls and on the backs of the\nchairs hung a ragged shawl, a pair of muddy pantaloons and a dress or\ntwo--all too bad for the old-clothes man to buy. In the middle of the\nmantel between two mismated tin candlesticks was a bundle of pawn\ntickets from the Mont-de-Piete. These tickets were of a delicate shade\nof rose.\n\nThe room was the best in the hotel--the first floor looking out on the\nboulevard.\n\nMeanwhile side by side on the same pillow the two children lay calmly\nsleeping. Claude, who was eight years old, was breathing calmly and\nregularly with his little hands outside of the coverings, while\nEtienne, only four, smiled with one arm under his brother's neck.\n\nWhen their mother's eyes fell on them she had a new paroxysm of sobs\nand pressed her handkerchief to her mouth to stifle them. Then with\nbare feet, not stopping to put on her slippers which had fallen off,\nshe ran to the window out of which she leaned as she had done half the\nnight and inspected the sidewalks as far as she could see.\n\nThe hotel was on the Boulevard de la Chapelle, at the left of the\nBarriere Poissonniers. It was a two-story building, painted a deep red\nup to the first floor, and had disjointed weather-stained blinds.\n\nAbove a lantern with glass sides was a sign between the two windows:\n\nHOTEL BONCOEUR\n\nKEPT BY\n\nMARSOULLIER\n\nin large yellow letters, partially obliterated by the dampness.\nGervaise, who was prevented by the lantern from seeing as she desired,\nleaned out still farther, with her handkerchief on her lips. She\nlooked to the right toward the Boulevard de Rochechoumart, where\ngroups of butchers stood with their bloody frocks before their\nestablishments, and the fresh breeze brought in whiffs, a strong\nanimal smell--the smell of slaughtered cattle.\n\nShe looked to the left, following the ribbonlike avenue, past the\nHospital de Lariboisiere, then building. Slowly, from one end to the\nother of the horizon, did she follow the wall, from behind which in\nthe nightime she had heard strange groans and cries, as if some fell\nmurder were being perpetrated. She looked at it with horror, as if in\nsome dark corner--dark with dampness and filth--she should distinguish\nLantier--Lantier lying dead with his throat cut.\n\nWhen she gazed beyond this gray and interminable wall she saw a great\nlight, a golden mist waving and shimmering with the dawn of a new\nParisian day. But it was to the Barriere Poissonniers that her eyes\npersistently returned, watching dully the uninterrupted flow of men\nand cattle, wagons and sheep, which came down from Montmartre and\nfrom La Chapelle. There were scattered flocks dashed like waves on\nthe sidewalk by some sudden detention and an endless succession of\nlaborers going to their work with their tools over their shoulders\nand their loaves of bread under their arms.\n\nSuddenly Gervaise thought she distinguished Lantier amid this crowd,\nand she leaned eagerly forward at the risk of falling from the window.\nWith a fresh pang of disappointment she pressed her handkerchief to\nher lips to restrain her sobs.\n\nA fresh, youthful voice caused her to turn around.\n\n\"Lantier has not come in then?\"\n\n\"No, Monsieur Coupeau,\" she answered, trying to smile.\n\nThe speaker was a tinsmith who occupied a tiny room at the top of the\nhouse. His bag of tools was over his shoulder; he had seen the key in\nthe door and entered with the familiarity of a friend.\n\n\"You know,\" he continued, \"that I am working nowadays at the hospital.\nWhat a May this is! The air positively stings one this morning.\"\n\nAs he spoke he looked closely at Gervaise; he saw her eyes were red\nwith tears and then, glancing at the bed, discovered that it had not\nbeen disturbed. He shook his head and, going toward the couch where\nthe children lay with their rosy cherub faces, he said in a lower\nvoice:\n\n\"You think your husband ought to have been with you, madame. But don't\nbe troubled; he is busy with politics. He went on like a mad man the\nother day when they were voting for Eugene Sue. Perhaps he passed the\nnight with his friends abusing that reprobate Bonaparte.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" she murmured with an effort. \"You think nothing of that kind.\nI know where Lantier is only too well. We have our sorrows like the\nrest of the world!\"\n\nCoupeau gave a knowing wink and departed, having offered to bring her\nsome milk if she did not care to go out; she was a good woman, he told\nher and might count on him any time when she was in trouble.\n\nAs soon as Gervaise was alone she returned to the window.\n\nFrom the Barriere the lowing of the cattle and the bleating of the\nsheep still came on the keen, fresh morning air. Among the crowd she\nrecognized the locksmiths by their blue frocks, the masons by their\nwhite overalls, the painters by their coats, from under which hung\ntheir blouses. This crowd was cheerless. All of neutral tints--grays\nand blues predominating, with never a dash of color. Occasionally a\nworkman stopped and lighted his pipe, while his companions passed on.\nThere was no laughing, no talking, but they strode on steadily with\ncadaverous faces toward that Paris which quickly swallowed them up.\n\nAt the two corners of La Rue des Poissonniers were two wineshops,\nwhere the shutters had just been taken down. Here some of the workmen\nlingered, crowding into the shop, spitting, coughing and drinking\nglasses of brandy and water. Gervaise was watching the place on the\nleft of the street, where she thought she had seen Lantier go in, when\na stout woman, bareheaded and wearing a large apron, called to her\nfrom the pavement,\n\n\"You are up early, Madame Lantier!\"\n\nGervaise leaned out.\n\n\"Ah, is it you, Madame Boche! Yes, I am up early, for I have much to\ndo today.\"\n\n\"Is that so? Well, things don't get done by themselves, that's sure!\"\n\nAnd a conversation ensued between the window and the sidewalk. Mme\nBoche was the concierge of the house wherein the restaurant Veau a\nDeux Tetes occupied the _rez-de-chaussee_.\n\nMany times Gervaise had waited for Lantier in the room of this woman\nrather than face the men who were eating. The concierge said she had\njust been round the corner to arouse a lazy fellow who had promised to\ndo some work and then went on to speak of one of her lodgers who had\ncome in the night before with some woman and had made such a noise\nthat every one was disturbed until after three o'clock.\n\nAs she gabbled, however, she examined Gervaise with considerable\ncuriosity and seemed, in fact, to have come out under the window for\nthat express purpose.\n\n\"Is Monsieur Lantier still asleep?\" she asked suddenly.\n\n\"Yes, he is asleep,\" answered Gervaise with flushing cheeks.\n\nMadame saw the tears come to her eyes and, satisfied with her\ndiscovery, was turning away when she suddenly stopped and called out:\n\n\"You are going to the lavatory this morning, are you not? All right\nthen, I have some things to wash, and I will keep a place for you next\nto me, and we can have a little talk!\"\n\nThen as if moved by sudden compassion, she added:\n\n\"Poor child, don't stay at that window any longer. You are purple with\ncold and will surely make yourself sick!\"\n\nBut Gervaise did not move. She remained in the same spot for two\nmortal hours, until the clock struck eight. The shops were now\nall open. The procession in blouses had long ceased, and only an\noccasional one hurried along. At the wineshops, however, there was\nthe same crowd of men drinking, spitting and coughing. The workmen in\nthe street had given place to the workwomen. Milliners' apprentices,\nflorists, burnishers, who with thin shawls drawn closely around them\ncame in bands of three or four, talking eagerly, with gay laughs\nand quick glances. Occasionally one solitary figure was seen, a\npale-faced, serious woman, who walked rapidly, neither looking to\nthe right nor to the left.\n\nThen came the clerks, blowing on their fingers to warm them, eating a\nroll as they walked; young men, lean and tall, with clothing they had\noutgrown and with eyes heavy with sleep; old men, who moved along with\nmeasured steps, occasionally pulling out their watches, but able, from\nmany years' practice, to time their movements almost to a second.\n\nThe boulevards at last were comparatively quiet. The inhabitants were\nsunning themselves. Women with untidy hair and soiled petticoats were\nnursing their babies in the open air, and an occasional dirty-faced\nbrat fell into the gutter or rolled over with shrieks of pain or joy.\n\nGervaise felt faint and ill; all hope was gone. It seemed to her that\nall was over and that Lantier would come no more. She looked from the\ndingy slaughterhouses, black with their dirt and loathsome odor, on to\nthe new and staring hospital and into the rooms consecrated to disease\nand death. As yet the windows were not in, and there was nothing to\nimpede her view of the large, empty wards. The sun shone directly in\nher face and blinded her.\n\nShe was sitting on a chair with her arms dropping drearily at her side\nbut not weeping, when Lantier quietly opened the door and walked in.\n\n\"You have come!\" she cried, ready to throw herself on his neck.\n\n\"Yes, I have come,\" he answered, \"and what of it? Don't begin any\nof your nonsense now!\" And he pushed her aside. Then with an angry\ngesture he tossed his felt hat on the bureau.\n\nHe was a small, dark fellow, handsome and well made, with a delicate\nmustache which he twisted in his fingers mechanically as he spoke.\nHe wore an old coat, buttoned tightly at the waist, and spoke with\na strongly marked Provencal accent.\n\nGervaise had dropped upon her chair again and uttered disjointed\nphrases of lamentation.\n\n\"I have not closed my eyes--I thought you were killed! Where have you\nbeen all night? I feel as if I were going mad! Tell me, Auguste, where\nhave you been?\"\n\n\"Oh, I had business,\" he answered with an indifferent shrug of his\nshoulders. \"At eight o'clock I had an engagement with that friend,\nyou know, who is thinking of starting a manufactory of hats. I was\ndetained, and I preferred stopping there. But you know I don't like\nto be watched and catechized. Just let me alone, will you?\"\n\nHis wife began to sob. Their voices and Lantier's noisy movements as\nhe pushed the chairs about woke the children. They started up, half\nnaked with tumbled hair, and hearing their mother cry, they followed\nher example, rending the air with their shrieks.\n\n\"Well, this is lovely music!\" cried Lantier furiously. \"I warn you,\nif you don't all stop, that out of this door I go, and you won't see\nme again in a hurry! Will you hold your tongue? Good-by then; I'll\ngo back where I came from.\"\n\nHe snatched up his hat, but Gervaise rushed toward him, crying:\n\n\"No! No!\"\n\nAnd she soothed the children and stifled their cries with kisses and\nlaid them tenderly back in their bed, and they were soon happy and\nmerrily playing together. Meanwhile the father, not even taking off\nhis boots, threw himself on the bed with a weary air. His face was\nwhite from exhaustion and a sleepless night; he did not close his\neyes but looked around the room.\n\n\"A nice-looking place, this!\" he muttered.\n\nThen examining Gervaise, he said half aloud and half to himself:\n\n\"So! You have given up washing yourself, it seems!\"\n\nGervaise was only twenty-two. She was tall and slender with delicate\nfeatures, already worn by hardships and anxieties. With her hair\nuncombed and shoes down at the heel, shivering in her white sack, on\nwhich was much dust and many stains from the furniture and wall where\nit had hung, she looked at least ten years older from the hours of\nsuspense and tears she had passed.\n\nLantier's word startled her from her resignation and timidity.\n\n\"Are you not ashamed?\" she said with considerable animation. \"You know\nvery well that I do all I can. It is not my fault that we came here.\nI should like to see you with two children in a place where you can't\nget a drop of hot water. We ought as soon as we reached Paris to have\nsettled ourselves at once in a home; that was what you promised.\"\n\n\"Pshaw,\" he muttered; \"You had as much good as I had out of our\nsavings. You ate the fatted calf with me--and it is not worth while\nto make a row about it now!\"\n\nShe did not heed his word but continued:\n\n\"There is no need of giving up either. I saw Madame Fauconnier, the\nlaundress in La Rue Neuve. She will take me Monday. If you go in with\nyour friend we shall be afloat again in six months. We must find some\nkind of a hole where we can live cheaply while we work. That is the\nthing to do now. Work! Work!\"\n\nLantier turned his face to the wall with a shrug of disgust which\nenraged his wife, who resumed:\n\n\"Yes, I know very well that you don't like to work. You would like to\nwear fine clothes and walk about the streets all day. You don't like\nmy looks since you took all my dresses to the pawnbrokers. No, no,\nAuguste, I did not intend to speak to you about it, but I know very\nwell where you spent the night. I saw you go into the Grand-Balcon\nwith that streetwalker Adele. You have made a charming choice. She\nwears fine clothes and is clean. Yes, and she has reason to be,\ncertainly; there is not a man in that restaurant who does not know\nher far better than an honest girl should be known!\"\n\nLantier leaped from the bed. His eyes were as black as night and his\nface deadly pale.\n\n\"Yes,\" repeated his wife, \"I mean what I say. Madame Boche will not\nkeep her or her sister in the house any longer, because there are\nalways a crowd of men hanging on the staircase.\"\n\nLantier lifted both fists, and then conquering a violent desire to\nbeat her, he seized her in his arms, shook her violently and threw her\non the bed where the children were. They at once began to cry again\nwhile he stood for a moment, and then, with the air of a man who\nfinally takes a resolution in regard to which he has hesitated, he\nsaid:\n\n\"You do not know what you have done, Gervaise. You are wrong--as you\nwill soon discover.\"\n\nFor a moment the voices of the children filled the room. Their mother,\nlying on their narrow couch, held them both in her arms and said over\nand over again in a monotonous voice:\n\n\"If you were not here, my poor darlings! If you were not here! If you\nwere not here!\"\n\nLantier was lying flat on his back with his eyes fixed on the ceiling.\nHe was not listening; his attention was concentrated on some fixed\nidea. He remained in this way for an hour and more, not sleeping, in\nspite of his evident and intense fatigue. When he turned and, leaning\non his elbow, looked about the room again, he found that Gervaise had\narranged the chamber and made the children's bed. They were washed\nand dressed. He watched her as she swept the room and dusted the\nfurniture.\n\nThe room was very dreary still, however, with its smoke-stained\nceiling and paper discolored by dampness and three chairs and\ndilapidated bureau, whose greasy surface no dusting could clean.\nThen while she washed herself and arranged her hair before the small\nmirror, he seemed to examine her arms and shoulders, as if instituting\na comparison between herself and someone else. And he smiled a\ndisdainful little smile.\n\nGervaise was slightly, very slightly, lame, but her lameness was\nperceptible, only on such days as she was very tired. This morning,\nso weary was she from the watches of the night, that she could hardly\nwalk without support.\n\nA profound silence reigned in the room; they did not speak to each\nother. He seemed to be waiting for something. She, adopting an\nunconcerned air, seemed to be in haste.\n\nShe made up a bundle of soiled linen that had been thrown into a\ncorner behind the trunk, and then he spoke:\n\n\"What are you doing? Are you going out?\"\n\nAt first she did not reply. Then when he angrily repeated the question\nshe answered:\n\n\"Certainly I am. I am going to wash all these things. The children\ncannot live in dirt.\"\n\nHe threw two or three handkerchiefs toward her, and after another long\nsilence he said:\n\n\"Have you any money?\"\n\nShe quickly rose to her feet and turned toward him; in her hand she\nheld some of the soiled clothes.\n\n\"Money! Where should I get money unless I had stolen it? You know very\nwell that day before yesterday you got three francs on my black skirt.\nWe have breakfasted twice on that, and money goes fast. No, I have no\nmoney. I have four sous for the lavatory. I cannot make money like\nother women we know.\"\n\nHe did not reply to this allusion but rose from the bed and passed in\nreview the ragged garments hung around the room. He ended by taking\ndown the pantaloons and the shawl and, opening the bureau, took out a\nsack and two chemises. All these he made into a bundle, which he threw\nat Gervaise.\n\n\"Take them,\" he said, \"and make haste back from the pawnbroker's.\"\n\n\"Would you not like me to take the children?\" she asked. \"Heavens! If\npawnbrokers would only make loans on children, what a good thing it\nwould be!\"\n\nShe went to the Mont-de-Piete, and when she returned a half-hour later\nshe laid a silver five-franc piece on the mantelshelf and placed the\nticket with the others between the two candlesticks.\n\n\"This is what they gave me,\" she said coldly. \"I wanted six francs,\nbut they would not give them. They always keep on the safe side there,\nand yet there is always a crowd.\"\n\nLantier did not at once take up the money. He had sent her to the\nMont-de-Piete that he might not leave her without food or money, but\nwhen he caught sight of part of a ham wrapped in paper on the table\nwith half a loaf of bread he slipped the silver piece into his vest\npocket.\n\n\"I did not dare go to the milk woman,\" explained Gervaise, \"because\nwe owe her for eight days. But I shall be back early. You can get some\nbread and some chops and have them ready. Don't forget the wine too.\"\n\nHe made no reply. Peace seemed to be made, but when Gervaise went to\nthe trunk to take out some of Lantier's clothing he called out:\n\n\"No--let that alone.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she said, turning round in surprise. \"You can't\nwear these things again until they are washed! Why shall I not take\nthem?\"\n\nAnd she looked at him with some anxiety. He angrily tore the things\nfrom her hands and threw them back into the trunk.\n\n\"Confound you!\" he muttered. \"Will you never learn to obey? When I say\na thing I mean it--\"\n\n\"But why?\" she repeated, turning very pale and seized with a terrible\nsuspicion. \"You do not need these shirts; you are not going away. Why\nshould I not take them?\"\n\nHe hesitated a moment, uneasy under the earnest gaze she fixed upon\nhim. \"Why? Why? Because,\" he said, \"I am sick of hearing you say that\nyou wash and mend for me. Attend to your own affairs, and I will\nattend to mine.\"\n\nShe entreated him, defended herself from the charge of ever having\ncomplained, but he shut the trunk with a loud bang and then sat down\nupon it, repeating that he was master at least of his own clothing.\nThen to escape from her eyes, he threw himself again on the bed,\nsaying he was sleepy and that she made his head ache, and finally\nslept or pretended to do so.\n\nGervaise hesitated; she was tempted to give up her plan of going to\nthe lavatory and thought she would sit down to her sewing. But at last\nshe was reassured by Lantier's regular breathing; she took her soap\nand her ball of bluing and, going to the children, who were playing\non the floor with some old corks, she said in a low voice:\n\n\"Be very good and keep quiet. Papa is sleeping.\"\n\nWhen she left the room there was not a sound except the stifled\nlaughter of the little ones. It was then after ten, and the sun was\nshining brightly in at the window.\n\nGervaise, on reaching the boulevard, turned to the left and followed\nthe Rue de la Goutte-d'Or. As she passed Mme Fauconnier's shop she\nnodded to the woman. The lavatory, whither she went, was in the middle\nof this street, just where it begins to ascend. Over a large low\nbuilding towered three enormous reservoirs for water, huge cylinders\nof zinc strongly made, and in the rear was the drying room, an\napartment with a very high ceiling and surrounded by blinds through\nwhich the air passed. On the right of the reservoirs a steam engine\nlet off regular puffs of white smoke. Gervaise, habituated apparently\nto puddles, did not lift her skirts but threaded her way through the\npart of _eau de Javelle_ which encumbered the doorway. She knew\nthe mistress of the establishment, a delicate woman who sat in a\ncabinet with glass doors, surrounded by soap and bluing and packages\nof bicarbonate of soda.\n\nAs Gervaise passed the desk she asked for her brush and beater, which\nshe had left to be taken care of after her last wash. Then having\ntaken her number, she went in. It was an immense shed, as it were,\nwith a low ceiling--the beams and rafters unconcealed--and lighted by\nlarge windows, through which the daylight streamed. A light gray mist\nor steam pervaded the room, which was filled with a smell of soapsuds\nand _eau de Javelle_ combined. Along the central aisle were tubs\non either side, and two rows of women with their arms bare to the\nshoulders and their skirts tucked up stood showing their colored\nstockings and stout laced shoes.\n\nThey rubbed and pounded furiously, straightening themselves\noccasionally to utter a sentence and then applying themselves again\nto their task, with the steam and perspiration pouring down their red\nfaces. There was a constant rush of water from the faucets, a great\nsplashing as the clothes were rinsed and pounding and banging of the\nbeaters, while amid all this noise the steam engine in the corner kept\nup its regular puffing.\n\nGervaise went slowly up the aisle, looking to the right and the left.\nShe carried her bundle under her arm and limped more than usual, as\nshe was pushed and jarred by the energy of the women about her.\n\n\"Here! This way, my dear,\" cried Mme Boche, and when the young woman\nhad joined her at the very end where she stood, the concierge, without\nstopping her furious rubbing, began to talk in a steady fashion.\n\n\"Yes, this is your place. I have kept it for you. I have not much to\ndo. Boche is never hard on his linen, and you, too, do not seem to\nhave much. Your package is quite small. We shall finish by noon, and\nthen we can get something to eat. I used to give my clothes to a woman\nin La Rue Pelat, but bless my heart, she washed and pounded them all\naway, and I made up my mind to wash myself. It is clear gain, you see,\nand costs only the soap.\"\n\nGervaise opened her bundle and sorted the clothes, laying aside all\nthe colored pieces, and when Mme Boche advised her to try a little\nsoda she shook her head.\n\n\"No, no!\" she said. \"I know all about it!\"\n\n\"You know?\" answered Boche curiously. \"You have washed then in your\nown place before you came here?\"\n\nGervaise, with her sleeves rolled up, showing her pretty, fair arms,\nwas soaping a child's shirt. She rubbed it and turned it, soaped and\nrubbed it again. Before she answered she took up her beater and began\nto use it, accenting each phrase or rather punctuating them with her\nregular blows.\n\n\"Yes, yes, washed--I should think I had! Ever since I was ten years\nold. We went to the riverside, where I came from. It was much nicer\nthan here. I wish you could see it--a pretty corner under the trees\nby the running water. Do you know Plassans? Near Marseilles?\"\n\n\"You are a strong one, anyhow!\" cried Mme Boche, astonished at the\nrapidity and strength of the woman. \"Your arms are slender, but they\nare like iron.\"\n\nThe conversation continued until all the linen was well beaten and\nyet whole! Gervaise then took each piece separately, rinsed it, then\nrubbed it with soap and brushed it. That is to say, she held the cloth\nfirmly with one hand and with the other moved the short brush from\nher, pushing along a dirty foam which fell off into the water below.\n\nAs she brushed they talked.\n\n\"No, we are not married,\" said Gervaise. \"I do not intend to lie about\nit. Lantier is not so nice that a woman need be very anxious to be\nhis wife. If it were not for the children! I was fourteen and he was\neighteen when the first one was born. The other child did not come for\nfour years. I was not happy at home. Papa Macquart, for the merest\ntrifle, would beat me. I might have married, I suppose.\"\n\nShe dried her hands, which were red under the white soapsuds.\n\n\"The water is very hard in Paris,\" she said.\n\nMme Boche had finished her work long before, but she continued to\ndabble in the water merely as an excuse to hear this story, which for\ntwo weeks had excited her curiosity. Her mouth was open, and her eyes\nwere shining with satisfaction at having guessed so well.\n\n\"Oh yes, just as I knew,\" she said to herself, \"but the little woman\ntalks too much! I was sure, though, there had been a quarrel.\"\n\nThen aloud:\n\n\"He is not good to you then?\"\n\n\"He was very good to me once,\" answered Gervaise, \"but since we came\nto Paris he has changed. His mother died last year and left him about\nseventeen hundred francs. He wished to come to Paris, and as Father\nMacquart was in the habit of hitting me in the face without any\nwarning, I said I would come, too, which we did, with the two\nchildren. I meant to be a fine laundress, and he was to continue with\nhis trade as a hatter. We might have been very happy. But, you see,\nLantier is extravagant; he likes expensive things and thinks of his\namusement before anything else. He is not good for much, anyhow!\n\n\"We arrived at the Hotel Montmartre. We had dinners and carriages,\nsuppers and theaters, a watch for him, a silk dress for me--for he is\nnot selfish when he has money. You can easily imagine, therefore, at\nthe end of two months we were cleaned out. Then it was that we came\nto Hotel Boncoeur and that this life began.\" She checked herself with\na strange choking in the throat. Tears gathered in her eyes. She\nfinished brushing her linen.\n\n\"I must get my scalding water,\" she murmured.\n\nBut Mme Boche, much annoyed at this sudden interruption to the\nlong-desired confidence, called the boy.\n\n\"Charles,\" she said, \"it would be very good of you if you would bring\na pail of hot water to Madame Lantier, as she is in a great hurry.\"\nThe boy brought a bucketful, and Gervaise paid him a sou. It was a sou\nfor each bucket. She turned the hot water into her tub and soaked her\nlinen once more and rubbed it with her hands while the steam hovered\nround her blonde head like a cloud.\n\n\"Here, take some of this,\" said the concierge as she emptied into the\nwater that Gervaise was using the remains of a package of bicarbonate\nof soda. She offered her also some _eau de Javelle_, but the\nyoung woman refused. It was only good, she said, for grease spots\nand wine stains.\n\n\"I thought him somewhat dissipated,\" said Mme Boche, referring to\nLantier without naming him.\n\nGervaise, leaning over her tub and her arms up to the elbows in the\nsoapsuds, nodded in acquiescence.\n\n\"Yes,\" continued the concierge, \"I have seen many little things.\"\nBut she started back as Gervaise turned round with a pale face and\nquivering lips.\n\n\"Oh, I know nothing,\" she continued. \"He likes to laugh--that is\nall--and those two girls who are with us, you know, Adele and\nVirginie, like to laugh too, so they have their little jokes together,\nbut that is all there is of it, I am sure.\"\n\nThe young woman, with the perspiration standing on her brow and\nher arms still dripping, looked her full in the face with earnest,\ninquiring eyes.\n\nThen the concierge became excited and struck her breast, exclaiming:\n\n\"I tell you I know nothing whatever, nothing more than I tell you!\"\n\nThen she added in a gentle voice, \"But he has honest eyes, my dear.\nHe will marry you, child; I promise that he will marry you!\"\n\nGervaise dried her forehead with her damp hand and shook her head.\nThe two women were silent for a moment; around them, too, it was very\nquiet. The clock struck eleven. Many of the women were seated swinging\ntheir feet, drinking their wine and eating their sausages, sandwiched\nbetween slices of bread. An occasional economical housewife hurried\nin with a small bundle under her arm, and a few sounds of the pounder\nwere still heard at intervals; sentences were smothered in the full\nmouths, or a laugh was uttered, ending in a gurgling sound as the wine\nwas swallowed, while the great machine puffed steadily on. Not one\nof the women, however, heard it; it was like the very respiration of\nthe lavatory--the eager breath that drove up among the rafters the\nfloating vapor that filled the room.\n\nThe heat gradually became intolerable. The sun shone in on the left\nthrough the high windows, imparting to the vapor opaline tints--the\npalest rose and tender blue, fading into soft grays. When the women\nbegan to grumble the boy Charles went from one window to the other,\ndrawing down the heavy linen shades. Then he crossed to the other\nside, the shady side, and opened the blinds. There was a general\nexclamation of joy--a formidable explosion of gaiety.\n\nAll this time Gervaise was going on with her task and had just\ncompleted the washing of her colored pieces, which she threw over a\ntrestle to drip; soon small pools of blue water stood on the floor.\nThen she began to rinse the garments in cold water which ran from a\nspigot near by.\n\n\"You have nearly finished,\" said Mme Boche. \"I am waiting to help you\nwring them.\"\n\n\"Oh, you are very good! It is not necessary though!\" answered the\nyoung woman as she swashed the garments through the clear water. \"If\nI had sheets I would not refuse your offer, however.\"\n\nNevertheless, she accepted the aid of the concierge. They took up a\nbrown woolen skirt, badly faded, from which poured out a yellow stream\nas the two women wrung it together.\n\nSuddenly Mme Boche cried out:\n\n\"Look! There comes big Virginie! She is actually coming here to wash\nher rags tied up in a handkerchief.\"\n\nGervaise looked up quickly. Virginie was a woman about her own age,\nlarger and taller than herself, a brunette and pretty in spite of the\nelongated oval of her face. She wore an old black dress with flounces\nand a red ribbon at her throat. Her hair was carefully arranged and\nmassed in a blue chenille net.\n\nShe hesitated a moment in the center aisle and half shut her eyes,\nas if looking for something or somebody, but when she distinguished\nGervaise she went toward her with a haughty, insolent air and\nsupercilious smile and finally established herself only a short\ndistance from her.\n\n\"That is a new notion!\" muttered Mme Boche in a low voice. \"She was\nnever known before to rub out even a pair of cuffs. She is a lazy\ncreature, I do assure you. She never sews the buttons on her boots.\nShe is just like her sister, that minx of an Adele, who stays away\nfrom the shop two days out of three. What is she rubbing now? A skirt,\nis it? It is dirty enough, I am sure!\"\n\nIt was clear that Mme Boche wished to please Gervaise. The truth was\nshe often took coffee with Adele and Virginie when the two sisters\nwere in funds. Gervaise did not reply but worked faster than before.\nShe was now preparing her bluing water in a small tub standing on\nthree legs. She dipped in her pieces, shook them about in the colored\nwater, which was almost a lake in hue, and then, wringing them, she\nshook them out and threw them lightly over the high wooden bars.\n\nWhile she did this she kept her back well turned on big Virginie. But\nshe felt that the girl was looking at her, and she heard an occasional\nderisive sniff. Virginie, in fact, seemed to have come there to\nprovoke her, and when Gervaise turned around the two women fixed their\neyes on each other.\n\n\"Let her be,\" murmured Mme Boche. \"She is not the one, now I tell\nyou!\"\n\nAt this moment, as Gervaise was shaking her last piece of linen, she\nheard laughing and talking at the door of the lavatory.\n\n\"Two children are here asking for their mother!\" cried Charles.\n\nAll the women looked around, and Gervaise recognized Claude and\nEtienne. As soon as they saw her they ran toward her, splashing\nthrough the puddle's, their untied shoes half off and Claude, the\neldest, dragging his little brother by the hand.\n\nThe women as they passed uttered kindly exclamations of pity, for\nthe children were evidently frightened. They clutched their mother's\nskirts and buried their pretty blond heads.\n\n\"Did Papa send you?\" asked Gervaise.\n\nBut as she stooped to tie Etienne's shoes she saw on Claude's finger\nthe key of her room with its copper tag and number.\n\n\"Did you bring the key?\" she exclaimed in great surprise. \"And why,\npray?\"\n\nThe child looked down on the key hanging on his finger, which he had\napparently forgotten. This seemed to remind him of something, and he\nsaid in a clear, shrill voice:\n\n\"Papa is gone!\"\n\n\"He went to buy your breakfast, did he not? And he told you to come\nand look for me here, I suppose?\"\n\nClaude looked at his brother and hesitated. Then he exclaimed:\n\n\"Papa has gone, I say. He jumped from the bed, put his things in\nhis trunk, and then he carried his trunk downstairs and put it on\na carriage. We saw him--he has gone!\"\n\nGervaise was kneeling, tying the boy's shoe. She rose slowly with a\nvery white face and with her hands pressed to either temple, as if she\nwere afraid of her head cracking open. She could say nothing but the\nsame words over and over again:\n\n\"Great God! Great God! Great God!\"\n\nMme Boche, in her turn, interrogated the child eagerly, for she was\ncharmed at finding herself an actor, as it were, in this drama.\n\n\"Tell us all about it, my dear. He locked the door, did he? And then\nhe told you to bring the key here?\" And then, lowering her voice, she\nwhispered in the child's ear:\n\n\"Was there a lady in the carriage?\" she asked.\n\nThe child looked troubled for a moment but speedily began his story\nagain with a triumphant air.\n\n\"He jumped off the bed, put his things in the trunk, and he went\naway.\"\n\nThen as Mme Boche made no attempt to detain him, he drew his brother\nto the faucet, where the two amused themselves in making the water\nrun.\n\nGervaise could not weep. She felt as if she were stifling. She covered\nher face with her hands and turned toward the wall. A sharp, nervous\ntrembling shook her from head to foot. An occasional sobbing sigh or,\nrather, gasp escaped from her lips, while she pressed her clenched\nhands more tightly on her eyes, as if to increase the darkness of the\nabyss in which she felt herself to have fallen.\n\n\"Come! Come, my child!\" muttered Mme Boche.\n\n\"If you knew! If you only knew all!\" answered Gervaise. \"Only this\nvery morning he made me carry my shawl and my chemises to the\nMont-de-Piete, and that was the money he had for the carriage.\"\n\nAnd the tears rushed to her eyes. The recollection of her visit to the\npawnbroker's, of her hasty return with the money in her hand, seemed\nto let loose the sobs that strangled her and was the one drop too\nmuch. Tears streamed from her eyes and poured down her face. She did\nnot think of wiping them away.\n\n\"Be reasonable, child! Be quiet,\" whispered Mme Boche. \"They are all\nlooking at you. Is it possible you can care so much for any man? You\nlove him still, although such a little while ago you pretended you did\nnot care for him, and you cry as if your heart would break! Oh lord,\nwhat fools we women are!\"\n\nThen in a maternal tone she added:\n\n\"And such a pretty little woman as you are too. But now I may as\nwell tell you the whole, I suppose? Well then, you remember when\nI was talking to you from the sidewalk and you were at your window?\nI knew then that it was Lantier who came in with Adele. I did not see\nhis face, but I knew his coat, and Boche watched and saw him come\ndownstairs this morning. But he was with Adele, you understand. There\nis another person who comes to see Virginie twice a week.\"\n\nShe stopped for a moment to take breath and then went on in a lower\ntone still.\n\n\"Take care! She is laughing at you--the heartless little cat! I bet\nall her washing is a sham. She has seen her sister and Lantier well\noff and then came here to find out how you would take it.\"\n\nGervaise took her hands down from her face and looked around. When\nshe saw Virginie talking and laughing with two or three women a wild\ntempest of rage shook her from head to foot. She stooped with her arms\nextended, as if feeling for something, and moved along slowly for a\nstep or two, then snatched up a bucket of soapsuds and threw it at\nVirginie.\n\n\"You devil! Be off with you!\" cried Virginie, starting back. Only her\nfeet were wet.\n\nAll the women in the lavatory hurried to the scene of action. They\njumped up on the benches, some with a piece of bread in their hands,\nothers with a bit of soap, and a circle of spectators was soon formed.\n\n\"Yes, she is a devil!\" repeated Virginie. \"What has got into the\nfool?\" Gervaise stood motionless, her face convulsed and lips apart.\nThe other continued:\n\n\"She got tired of the country, it seems, but she left one leg behind\nher, at all events.\"\n\nThe women laughed, and big Virginie, elated at her success, went on\nin a louder and more triumphant tone:\n\n\"Come a little nearer, and I will soon settle you. You had better have\nremained in the country. It is lucky for you that your dirty soapsuds\nonly went on my feet, for I would have taken you over my knees and\ngiven you a good spanking if one drop had gone in my face. What is\nthe matter with her, anyway?\" And big Virginie addressed her audience:\n\"Make her tell what I have done to her! Say! Fool, what harm have I\never done to you?\"\n\n\"You had best not talk so much,\" answered Gervaise almost inaudibly;\n\"you know very well where my husband was seen yesterday. Now be quiet\nor harm will come to you. I will strangle you--quick as a wink.\"\n\n\"Her husband, she says! Her husband! The lady's husband! As if a\nlooking thing like that had a husband! Is it my fault if he has\ndeserted her? Does she think I have stolen him? Anyway, he was much\ntoo good for her. But tell me, some of you, was his name on his\ncollar? Madame has lost her husband! She will pay a good reward,\nI am sure, to anyone who will carry him back!\"\n\nThe women all laughed. Gervaise, in a low, concentrated voice,\nrepeated:\n\n\"You know very well--you know very well! Your sister--yes, I will\nstrangle your sister!\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I understand,\" answered Virginie. \"Strangle her if you\nchoose. What do I care? And what are you staring at me for? Can't\nI wash my clothes in peace? Come, I am sick of this stuff. Let me\nalone!\"\n\nBig Virginie turned away, and after five or six angry blows with her\nbeater she began again:\n\n\"Yes, it is my sister, and the two adore each other. You should see\nthem bill and coo together. He has left you with these dirty-faced\nimps, and you left three others behind you with three fathers! It was\nyour dear Lantier who told us all that. Ah, he had had quite enough\nof you--he said so!\"\n\n\"Miserable fool!\" cried Gervaise, white with anger.\n\nShe turned and mechanically looked around on the floor; seeing\nnothing, however, but the small tub of bluing water, she threw that\nin Virginie's face.\n\n\"She has spoiled my dress!\" cried Virginie, whose shoulder and one\nhand were dyed a deep blue. \"You just wait a moment!\" she added as\nshe, in her turn, snatched up a tub and dashed its contents at\nGervaise. Then ensued a most formidable battle. The two women ran up\nand down the room in eager haste, looking for full tubs, which they\nquickly flung in the faces of each other, and each deluge was heralded\nand accompanied by a shout.\n\n\"Is that enough? Will that cool you off?\" cried Gervaise.\n\nAnd from Virginie:\n\n\"Take that! It is good to have a bath once in your life!\"\n\nFinally the tubs and pails were all empty, and the two women began to\ndraw water from the faucets. They continued their mutual abuse while\nthe water was running, and presently it was Virginie who received\na bucketful in her face. The water ran down her back and over her\nskirts. She was stunned and bewildered, when suddenly there came\nanother in her left ear, knocking her head nearly off her shoulders;\nher comb fell and with it her abundant hair.\n\nGervaise was attacked about her legs. Her shoes were filled with\nwater, and she was drenched above her knees. Presently the two women\nwere deluged from head to foot; their garments stuck to them, and they\ndripped like umbrellas which had been out in a heavy shower.\n\n\"What fun!\" said one of the laundresses as she looked on at a safe\ndistance.\n\nThe whole lavatory were immensely amused, and the women applauded\nas if at a theater. The floor was covered an inch deep with water,\nthrough which the termagants splashed. Suddenly Virginie discovered\na bucket of scalding water standing a little apart; she caught it and\nthrew it upon Gervaise. There was an exclamation of horror from the\nlookers-on. Gervaise escaped with only one foot slightly burned, but\nexasperated by the pain, she threw a tub with all her strength at the\nlegs of her opponent. Virginie fell to the ground.\n\n\"She has broken her leg!\" cried one of the spectators.\n\n\"She deserved it,\" answered another, \"for the tall one tried to scald\nher!\"\n\n\"She was right, after all, if the blonde had taken away her man!\"\n\nMme Boche rent the air with her exclamations, waving her arms\nfrantically high above her head. She had taken the precaution to place\nherself behind a rampart of tubs, with Claude and Etienne clinging to\nher skirts, weeping and sobbing in a paroxysm of terror and keeping up\na cry of \"Mamma! Mamma!\" When she saw Virginie prostrate on the ground\nshe rushed to Gervaise and tried to pull her away.\n\n\"Come with me!\" she urged. \"Do be sensible. You are growing so angry\nthat the Lord only knows what the end of all this will be!\"\n\nBut Gervaise pushed her aside, and the old woman again took refuge\nbehind the tubs with the children. Virginie made a spring at the\nthroat of her adversary and actually tried to strangle her. Gervaise\nshook her off and snatched at the long braid hanging from the girl's\nhead and pulled it as if she hoped to wrench it off, and the head\nwith it.\n\nThe battle began again, this time silent and wordless and literally\ntooth and nail. Their extended hands with fingers stiffly crooked,\ncaught wildly at all in their way, scratching and tearing. The red\nribbon and the chenille net worn by the brunette were torn off; the\nwaist of her dress was ripped from throat to belt and showed the\nwhite skin on the shoulder.\n\nGervaise had lost a sleeve, and her chemise was torn to her waist.\nStrips of clothing lay in every direction. It was Gervaise who was\nfirst wounded. Three long scratches from her mouth to her throat\nbled profusely, and she fought with her eyes shut lest she should be\nblinded. As yet Virginia showed no wound. Suddenly Gervaise seized\none of her earrings--pear-shaped, of yellow glass--she tore it out\nand brought blood.\n\n\"They will kill each other! Separate them,\" cried several voices.\n\nThe women gathered around the combatants; the spectators were divided\ninto two parties--some exciting and encouraging Gervaise and Virginie\nas if they had been dogs fighting, while others, more timid, trembled,\nturned away their heads and said they were faint and sick. A general\nbattle threatened to take place, such was the excitement.\n\nMme Boche called to the boy in charge:\n\n\"Charles! Charles! Where on earth can he be?\"\n\nFinally she discovered him, calmly looking on with his arms folded. He\nwas a tall youth with a big neck. He was laughing and hugely enjoying\nthe scene. It would be a capital joke, he thought, if the women tore\neach other's clothes to rags and if they should be compelled to finish\ntheir fight in a state of nudity.\n\n\"Are you there then?\" cried Mme Boche when she saw him. \"Come and help\nus separate them, or you can do it yourself.\"\n\n\"No, thank you,\" he answered quietly. \"I don't propose to have my own\neyes scratched out! I am not here for that. Let them alone! It will do\nthem no harm to let a little of their hot blood out!\"\n\nMme Boche declared she would summon the police, but to this the\nmistress of the lavatory, the delicate-looking woman with weak eyes,\nstrenuously objected.\n\n\"No, no, I will not. It would injure my house!\" she said over and over\nagain.\n\nBoth women lay on the ground. Suddenly Virginie struggled up to her\nknees. She had got possession of one of the beaters, which she\nbrandished. Her voice was hoarse and low as she muttered:\n\n\"This will be as good for you as for your dirty linen!\"\n\nGervaise, in her turn, snatched another beater, which she held like a\nclub. Her voice also was hoarse and low.\n\n\"I will beat your skin,\" she muttered, \"as I would my coarse towels.\"\n\nThey knelt in front of each other in utter silence for at least a\nminute, with hair streaming, eyes glaring and distended nostrils. They\neach drew a long breath.\n\nGervaise struck the first blow with her beater full on the shoulders\nof her adversary and then threw herself over on the side to escape\nVirginie's weapon, which touched her on the hip.\n\nThus started, they struck each other as laundresses strike their\nlinen, in measured cadence.\n\nThe women about them ceased to laugh; many went away, saying they were\nfaint. Those who remained watched the scene with a cruel light in\ntheir eyes. Mme Boche had taken Claude and Etienne to the other end of\nthe room, whence came the dreary sound of their sobs which were heard\nthrough the dull blows of the beaters.\n\nSuddenly Gervaise uttered a shriek. Virginie had struck her just above\nthe elbow on her bare arm, and the flesh began to swell at once. She\nrushed at Virginie; her face was so terrible that the spectators\nthought she meant to kill her.\n\n\"Enough! Enough!\" they cried.\n\nWith almost superhuman strength she seized Virginie by the waist, bent\nher forward with her face to the brick floor and, notwithstanding her\nstruggles, lifted her skirts and showed the white and naked skin. Then\nshe brought her beater down as she had formerly done at Plassans under\nthe trees on the riverside, where her employer had washed the linen of\nthe garrison.\n\nEach blow of the beater fell on the soft flesh with a dull thud,\nleaving a scarlet mark.\n\n\"Oh! Oh!\" murmured Charles with his eyes nearly starting from his\nhead.\n\nThe women were laughing again by this time, but soon the cry began\nagain of \"Enough! Enough!\"\n\nGervaise did not even hear. She seemed entirely absorbed, as if she\nwere fulfilling an appointed task, and she talked with strange, wild\ngaiety, recalling one of the rhymes of her childhood:\n\n _\"Pan! Pan! Margot au lavoir,\n   Pan! Pan! a coups de battoir;\n   Pan! Pan! va laver son coeur,\n   Pan! Pan! tout noir de douleur_\n\n\"Take that for yourself and that for your sister and this for Lantier.\nAnd now I shall begin all over again. That is for Lantier--that for\nyour sister--and this for yourself!\n\n _\"Pan! Pan! Margot au lavoir!\n   Pan! Pan! a coups de battoir.\"_\n\nThey tore Virginie from her hands. The tall brunette, weeping and\nsobbing, scarlet with shame, rushed out of the room, leaving Gervaise\nmistress of the field, who calmly arranged her dress somewhat and,\nas her arm was stiff, begged Mme Boche to lift her bundle of linen\non her shoulder.\n\nWhile the old woman obeyed she dilated on her emotions during the\nscene that had just taken place.\n\n\"You ought to go to a doctor and see if something is not broken.\nI heard a queer sound,\" she said.\n\nBut Gervaise did not seem to hear her and paid no attention either to\nthe women who crowded around her with congratulations. She hastened\nto the door where her children awaited her.\n\n\"Two hours!\" said the mistress of the establishment, already installed\nin her glass cabinet. \"Two hours and two sous!\"\n\nGervaise mechanically laid down the two sous, and then, limping\npainfully under the weight of the wet linen which was slung over her\nshoulder and dripped as she moved, with her injured arm and bleeding\ncheek, she went away, dragging after her with her naked arm the\nstill-sobbing and tear-stained Etienne and Claude.\n\nBehind her the lavatory resumed its wonted busy air, a little gayer\nthan usual from the excitement of the morning. The women had eaten\ntheir bread and drunk their wine, and they splashed the water and used\ntheir beaters with more energy than usual as they recalled the blows\ndealt by Gervaise. They talked from alley to alley, leaning over their\ntubs. Words and laughs were lost in the sound of running water. The\nsteam and mist were golden in the sun that came in through holes in\nthe curtain. The odor of soapsuds grew stronger and stronger.\n\nWhen Gervaise entered the alley which led to the Hotel Boncoeur her\ntears choked her. It was a long, dark, narrow alley, with a gutter\non one side close to the wall, and the loathsome smell brought to her\nmind the recollection of having passed through there with Lantier\na fortnight previous.\n\nAnd what had that fortnight been? A succession of quarrels and\ndissensions, the remembrance of which would be forevermore a regret\nand bitterness.\n\nHer room was empty, filled with the glowing sunlight from the open\nwindow. This golden light rendered more apparent the blackened ceiling\nand the walls with the shabby, dilapidated paper. There was not an\narticle beyond the furniture left in the room, except a woman's fichu\nthat seemed to have caught on a nail near the chimney. The children's\nbed was pulled out into the center of the room; the bureau drawers\nwere wide open, displaying their emptiness. Lantier had washed and had\nused the last of the pomade--two cents' worth on the back of a playing\ncard--the dirty water in which he had washed still stood in the basin.\nHe had forgotten nothing; the corner hitherto occupied by his trunk\nnow seemed to Gervaise a vast desert. Even the small mirror was gone.\nWith a presentiment of evil she turned hastily to the chimney. Yes,\nshe was right, Lantier had carried away the tickets. The pink papers\nwere no longer between the candlesticks!\n\nShe threw her bundle of linen into a chair and stood looking first at\none thing and then at another in a dull agony that no tears came to\nrelieve.\n\nShe had but one sou in the world. She heard a merry laugh from her\nboys who, already consoled, were at the window. She went toward them\nand, laying a hand on each of their heads, looked out on that scene\non which her weary eyes had dwelt so long that same morning.\n\nYes, it was on that street that she and her children would soon be\nthrown, and she turned her hopeless, despairing eyes toward the outer\nboulevards--looking from right to left, lingering at the two\nextremities, seized by a feeling of terror, as if her life\nthenceforward was to be spent between a slaughterhouse and a hospital.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nGERVAISE AND COUPEAU\n\nThree weeks later, about half-past eleven one fine sunny morning,\nGervaise and Coupeau, the tinworker, were eating some brandied fruit\nat the Assommoir.\n\nCoupeau, who was smoking outside, had seen her as she crossed the\nstreet with her linen and compelled her to enter. Her huge basket\nwas on the floor, back of the little table where they sat.\n\nFather Colombe's Tavern, known as the Assommoir, was on the corners\nof the Rue des Poissonniers and of the Boulevard de Rochechouart.\nThe sign bore the one single word in long, blue letters:\n\nDISTILLATION\n\nAnd this word stretched from one end to the other. On either side of\nthe door stood tall oleanders in small casks, their leaves covered\nthick with dust. The enormous counter with its rows of glasses, its\nfountain and its pewter measures was on the left of the door, and the\nhuge room was ornamented by gigantic casks painted bright yellow and\nhighly varnished, hooped with shining copper. On high shelves were\nbottles of liquors and jars of fruits; all sorts of flasks standing in\norder concealed the wall and repeated their pale green or deep crimson\ntints in the great mirror behind the counter.\n\nThe great feature of the house, however, was the distilling apparatus\nwhich stood at the back of the room behind an oak railing on which the\ntipsy workmen leaned as they stupidly watched the still with its long\nneck and serpentine tubes descending to subterranean regions--a very\ndevil's kitchen.\n\nAt this early hour the Assommoir was nearly empty. A stout man in his\nshirt sleeves--Father Colombe himself--was serving a little girl not\nmore than twelve years old with four cents' worth of liquor in a cup.\n\nThe sun streamed in at the door and lay on the floor, which was black\nwhere the men had spat as they smoked. And from the counter, from the\ncasks, from all the room, rose an alcoholic emanation which seemed to\nintoxicate the very particles of dust floating in the sunshine.\n\nIn the meantime Coupeau rolled a new cigarette. He was very neat and\nclean, wearing a blouse and a little blue cloth cap and showing his\nwhite teeth as he smiled.\n\nThe lower jaw was somewhat prominent and the nose slightly flat; he\nhad fine brown eyes and the face of a happy child and good-natured\nanimal. His hair was thick and curly. His complexion was delicate\nstill, for he was only twenty-six. Opposite him sat Gervaise in a\nblack gown, leaning slightly forward, finishing her fruit, which she\nheld by the stem.\n\nThey were near the street, at the first of the four tables arranged\nin front of the counter. When Coupeau had lighted his cigar he placed\nboth elbows on the table and looked at the woman without speaking.\nHer pretty face had that day something of the delicate transparency\nof fine porcelain.\n\nThen continuing something which they apparently had been previously\ndiscussing, he said in a low voice:\n\n\"Then you say no, do you? Absolutely no?\"\n\n\"Of course. No it must be, Monsieur Coupeau,\" answered Gervaise with\na smile. \"Surely you do not intend to begin that again here! You\npromised to be reasonable too. Had I known, I should certainly have\nrefused your treat.\"\n\nHe did not speak but gazed at her more intently than before with\ntender boldness. He looked at her soft eyes and dewy lips, pale at the\ncorners but half parted, allowing one to see the rich crimson within.\n\nShe returned his look with a kind and affectionate smile. Finally she\nsaid:\n\n\"You should not think of such a thing. It is folly! I am an old woman.\nI have a boy eight years old. What should we do together?\"\n\n\"Much as other people do, I suppose!\" answered Coupeau with a wink.\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"You know nothing about it, Monsieur Coupeau, but I have had some\nexperience. I have two mouths in the house, and they have excellent\nappetites. How am I to bring up my children if I trifle away my time?\nThen, too, my misfortune has taught me one great lesson, which is that\nthe less I have to do with men, the better!\"\n\nShe then proceeded to explain all her reasons, calmly and without\nanger. It was easy to see that her words were the result of grave\nconsideration.\n\nCoupeau listened quietly, saying only at intervals:\n\n\"You are hurting my feelings. Yes, hurting my feelings.\"\n\n\"Yes, I see that,\" she answered, \"and I am really very sorry for you.\nIf I had any idea of leading a different life from that which I follow\ntoday it might as well be with you as with another. You have the look\nof a good-natured man. But what is the use? I have now been with\nMadame Fauconnier for a fortnight. The children are going to school,\nand I am very happy, for I have plenty to do. Don't you see,\ntherefore, that it is best for us to remain as we are?\"\n\nAnd she stooped to pick up her basket.\n\n\"You are keeping me here to talk,\" she said, \"and they are waiting for\nme at my employer's. You will find some other woman, Monsieur Coupeau,\nfar prettier than I, who will not have two children to bring up!\"\n\nHe looked at the clock and made her sit down again.\n\n\"Wait!\" he cried. \"It is still thirty-five minutes of eleven. I have\ntwenty-five minutes still, and don't be afraid of my familiarity, for\nthe table is between us! Do you dislike me so very much that you can't\nstay and talk with me for five minutes?\"\n\nShe put down her basket, unwilling to seem disobliging, and they\ntalked for some time in a friendly sort of way. She had breakfasted\nbefore she left home, and he had swallowed his soup in the greatest\nhaste and laid in wait for her as she came out. Gervaise, as she\nlistened to him, watched from the windows--between the bottles of\nbrandied fruit--the movement of the crowd in the street, which at\nthis hour--that of the Parisian breakfast--was unusually lively.\nWorkmen hurried into the baker's and, coming out with a loaf under\ntheir arms, they went into the Veau a Deux Tetes, three doors higher\nup, to breakfast at six sous. Next the baker's was a shop where fried\npotatoes and mussels with parsley were sold. A constant succession of\nshopgirls carried off paper parcels of fried potatoes and cups filled\nwith mussels, and others bought bunches of radishes. When Gervaise\nleaned a little more toward the window she saw still another shop,\nalso crowded, from which issued a steady stream of children holding\nin their hands, wrapped in paper, a breaded cutlet or a sausage,\nstill warm.\n\nA group formed around the door of the Assommoir.\n\n\"Say, Bibi-la-Grillade,\" asked a voice, \"will you stand a drink all\naround?\"\n\nFive workmen went in, and the same voice said:\n\n\"Father Colombe, be honest now. Give us honest glasses, and no\nnutshells, if you please.\"\n\nPresently three more workmen entered together, and finally a crowd\nof blouses passed in between the dusty oleanders.\n\n\"You have no business to ask such questions,\" said Gervaise to\nCoupeau; \"of course I loved him. But after the manner in which he\ndeserted me--\"\n\nThey were speaking of Lantier. Gervaise had never seen him again;\nshe supposed him to be living with Virginie's sister, with a friend\nwho was about to start a manufactory for hats.\n\nAt first she thought of committing suicide, of drowning herself,\nbut she had grown more reasonable and had really begun to trust that\nthings were all for the best. With Lantier she felt sure she never\ncould have done justice to the children, so extravagant were his\nhabits.\n\nHe might come, of course, and see Claude and Etienne. She would not\nshow him the door; only so far as she herself was concerned, he had\nbest not lay his finger on her. And she uttered these words in a tone\nof determination, like a woman whose plan of life is clearly defined,\nwhile Coupeau, who was by no means inclined to give her up lightly,\nteased and questioned her in regard to Lantier with none too much\ndelicacy, it is true, but his teeth were so white and his face so\nmerry that the woman could not take offense. \"Did you beat him?\"\nhe asked finally. \"Oh, you are none too amiable. You beat people\nsometimes, I have heard.\"\n\nShe laughed gaily.\n\nYes, it was true she had whipped that great Virginie. That day she\ncould have strangled someone with a glad heart. And she laughed again,\nbecause Coupeau told her that Virginie, in her humiliation, had left\nthe _Quartier_.\n\nGervaise's face, as she laughed, however, had a certain childish\nsweetness. She extended her slender, dimpled hands, declaring she\nwould not hurt a fly. All she knew of blows was that she had received\na good many in her life. Then she began to talk of Plassans and of her\nyouth. She had never been indiscreet, nor was she fond of men. When\nshe had fallen in with Lantier she was only fourteen, and she regarded\nhim as her husband. Her only fault, she declared, was that she was too\namiable and allowed people to impose on her and that she got fond of\npeople too easily; were she to love another man, she should wish and\nexpect to live quietly and comfortably with him always, without any\nnonsense.\n\nAnd when Coupeau slyly asked her if she called her dear children\nnonsense she gave him a little slap and said that she, of course,\nwas much like other women. But women were not like men, after all;\nthey had their homes to take care of and keep clean; she was like\nher mother, who had been a slave to her brutal father for more than\ntwenty years!\n\n\"My very lameness--\" she continued.\n\n\"Your lameness?\" interrupted Coupeau gallantly. \"Why, it is almost\nnothing. No one would ever notice it!\"\n\nShe shook her head. She knew very well that it was very evident, and\nat forty it would be far worse, but she said softly, with a faint\nsmile, \"You have a strange taste, to fall in love with a lame woman!\"\n\nHe, with his elbows on the table, still coaxed and entreated, but she\ncontinued to shake her head in the negative. She listened with her\neyes fixed on the street, seemingly fascinated by the surging crowd.\n\nThe shops were being swept; the last frying pan of potatoes was taken\nfrom the stove; the pork merchant washed the plates his customers had\nused and put his place in order. Groups of mechanics were hurrying out\nfrom all the workshops, laughing and pushing each other like so many\nschoolboys, making a great scuffling on the sidewalk with their\nhobnailed shoes; while some, with their hands in their pockets,\nsmoked in a meditative fashion, looking up at the sun and winking\nprodigiously. The sidewalks were crowded and the crowd constantly\nadded to by men who poured from the open door--men in blouses and\nfrocks, old jackets and coats, which showed all their defects in\nthe clear morning light.\n\nThe bells of the various manufactories were ringing loudly, but the\nworkmen did not hurry. They deliberately lighted their pipes and then\nwith rounded shoulders slouched along, dragging their feet after them.\n\nGervaise mechanically watched a group of three, one man much taller\nthan the other two, who seemed to be hesitating as to what they should\ndo next. Finally they came directly to the Assommoir.\n\n\"I know them,\" said Coupeau, \"or rather I know the tall one. It is\nMes-Bottes, a comrade of mine.\"\n\nThe Assommoir was now crowded with boisterous men. Two glasses rang\nwith the energy with which they brought down their fists on the\ncounter. They stood in rows, with their hands crossed over their\nstomachs or folded behind their backs, waiting their turn to be\nserved by Father Colombe.\n\n\"Hallo!\" cried Mes-Bottes, giving Coupeau a rough slap on the\nshoulders. \"How fine you have got to be with your cigarettes and\nyour linen shirt bosom! Who is your friend that pays for all this?\nI should like to make her acquaintance.\"\n\n\"Don't be so silly!\" returned Coupeau angrily.\n\nBut the other gave a knowing wink.\n\n\"Ah, I understand. 'A word to the wise--'\" And he turned round with\na fearful lurch to look at Gervaise, who shuddered and recoiled. The\ntobacco smoke, the odor of humanity added to this air heavy with\nalcohol, was oppressive, and she choked a little and coughed.\n\n\"Ah, what an awful thing it is to drink!\" she said in a whisper to her\nfriend, to whom she then went on to say how years before she had drunk\nanisette with her mother at Plassans and how it had made her so very\nsick that ever since that day she had never been able to endure even\nthe smell of liquors.\n\n\"You see,\" she added as she held up her glass, \"I have eaten, the\nfruit, but I left the brandy, for it would make me ill.\"\n\nCoupeau also failed to understand how a man could swallow glasses of\nbrandy and water, one after the other. Brandied fruit, now and again,\nwas not bad. As to absinthe and similar abominations, he never touched\nthem--not he, indeed. His comrades might laugh at him as much as they\npleased; he always remained on the other side of the door when they\ncame in to swallow perdition like that.\n\nHis father, who was a tinworker like himself, had fallen one day from\nthe roof of No. 25, in La Rue Coquenaud, and this recollection had\nmade him very prudent ever since. As for himself, when he passed\nthrough that street and saw the place he would sooner drink the water\nin the gutter than swallow a drop at the wineshop. He concluded with\nthe sentence:\n\n\"You see, in my trade a man needs a clear head and steady legs.\"\n\nGervaise had taken up her basket; she had not risen from her chair,\nhowever, but held it on her knees with a dreary look in her eyes, as\nif the words of the young mechanic had awakened in her mind strange\nthoughts of a possible future.\n\nShe answered in a low, hesitating tone, without any apparent\nconnection:\n\n\"Heaven knows I am not ambitious. I do not ask for much in this world.\nMy idea would be to live a quiet life and always have enough to eat--a\nclean place to live in--with a comfortable bed, a table and a chair or\ntwo. Yes, I would like to bring my children up in that way and see\nthem good and industrious. I should not like to run the risk of being\nbeaten--no, that would not please me at all!\"\n\nShe hesitated, as if to find something else to say, and then resumed:\n\n\"Yes, and at the end I should wish to die in my bed in my own home!\"\n\nShe pushed back her chair and rose. Coupeau argued with her vehemently\nand then gave an uneasy glance at the clock. They did not, however,\ndepart at once. She wished to look at the still and stood for some\nminutes gazing with curiosity at the great copper machine. The\ntinworker, who had followed her, explained to her how the thing\nworked, pointing out with his finger the various parts of the machine,\nand showed the enormous retort whence fell the clear stream of\nalcohol. The still, with its intricate and endless coils of wire and\npipes, had a dreary aspect. Not a breath escaped from it, and hardly\na sound was heard. It was like some night task performed in daylight\nby a melancholy, silent workman.\n\nIn the meantime Mes-Bottes, accompanied by his two comrades, had\nlounged to the oak railing and leaned there until there was a corner\nof the counter free. He laughed a tipsy laugh as he stood with his\neyes fixed on the machine.\n\n\"By thunder!\" he muttered. \"That is a jolly little thing!\"\n\nHe went on to say that it held enough to keep their throats fresh for\na week. As for himself, he would like to hold the end of that pipe\nbetween his teeth, and he would like to feel that liquor run down his\nthroat in a steady stream until it reached his heels.\n\nThe still did its work slowly but surely. There was not a glimmer on\nits surface--no firelight reflected in its clean-colored sides. The\nliquor dropped steadily and suggested a persevering stream which would\ngradually invade the room, spread over the streets and boulevard and\nfinally deluge and inundate Paris itself.\n\nGervaise shuddered and drew back. She tried to smile, but her lips\nquivered as she murmured:\n\n\"It frightens me--that machine! It makes me feel cold to see that\nconstant drip.\"\n\nThen returning to the idea which had struck her as the acme of human\nhappiness, she said:\n\n\"Say, do you not think that would be very nice? To work and have\nplenty to eat, to have a little home all to oneself, to bring up\nchildren and then die in one's bed?\"\n\n\"And not be beaten,\" added Coupeau gaily. \"But I will promise never\nto beat you, Madame Gervaise, if you will agree to what I ask. I will\npromise also never to drink, because I love you too much! Come now,\nsay yes.\"\n\nHe lowered his voice and spoke with his lips close to her throat,\nwhile she, holding her basket in front of her, was making a path\nthrough the crowd of men.\n\nBut she did not say no or shake her head as she had done. She glanced\nup at him with a half-tender smile and seemed to rejoice in the\nassurance he gave that he did not drink.\n\nIt was clear that she would have said yes if she had not sworn never\nto have anything more to do with men.\n\nFinally they reached the door and went out of the place, leaving it\ncrowded to overflowing. The fumes of alcohol and the tipsy voices of\nthe men carousing went out into the street with them.\n\nMes-Bottes was heard accusing Father Colombe of cheating by not\nfilling his glasses more than half full, and he proposed to his\ncomrades to go in future to another place, where they could do\nmuch better and get more for their money.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Gervaise, drawing a long breath when they stood on the\nsidewalk, \"here one can breathe again. Good-by, Monsieur Coupeau,\nand many thanks for your politeness. I must hasten now!\"\n\nShe moved on, but he took her hand and held it fast.\n\n\"Go a little way with me. It will not be much farther for you.\nI must stop at my sister's before I go back to the shop.\"\n\nShe yielded to his entreaties, and they walked slowly on together.\nHe told her about his family. His mother, a tailoress, was the\nhousekeeper. Twice she had been obliged to give up her work on account\nof trouble with her eyes. She was sixty-two on the third of the last\nmonth. He was the youngest child. One of his sisters, Mme Lerat,\na widow, thirty-six years old, was a flower maker and lived at\nBatignolles, in La Rue Des Moines. The other, who was thirty, had\nmarried a chainmaker--a man by the name of Lorilleux. It was to their\nrooms that he was now going. They lived in that great house on the\nleft. He ate his dinner every night with them; it was an economy for\nthem all. But he wanted to tell them now not to expect him that night,\nas he was invited to dine with a friend.\n\nGervaise interrupted him suddenly:\n\n\"Did I hear your friend call you Cadet-Cassis?\"\n\n\"Yes. That is a name they have given me, because when they drag me\ninto a wineshop it is cassis I always take. I had as lief be called\nCadet-Cassis as Mes-Bottes, any time.\"\n\n\"I do not think Cadet-Cassis so very bad,\" answered Gervaise, and she\nasked him about his work. How long should he be employed on the new\nhospital?\n\n\"Oh,\" he answered, \"there was never any lack of work.\" He had always\nmore than he could do. He should remain in that shop at least a year,\nfor he had yards and yards of gutters to make.\n\n\"Do you know,\" he said, \"when I am up there I can see the Hotel\nBoncoeur. Yesterday you were at the window, and I waved my hand,\nbut you did not see me.\"\n\nThey by this time had turned into La Rue de la Goutte-d'Or. He stopped\nand looked up.\n\n\"There is the house,\" he said, \"and I was born only a few doors\nfarther off. It is an enormous place.\"\n\nGervaise looked up and down the fa\u00c3\u00a7ade. It was indeed enormous. The\nhouse was of five stories, with fifteen windows on each floor. The\nblinds were black and with many of the slats broken, which gave an\nindescribable air of ruin and desolation to the place. Four shops\noccupied the _rez-de-chaussee_. On the right of the door was a\nlarge room, occupied as a cookshop. On the left was a charcoal vender,\na thread-and-needle shop and an establishment for the manufacture of\numbrellas.\n\nThe house appeared all the higher for the reason that on either side\nwere two low buildings, squeezed close to it, and stood square, like\na block of granite roughly hewn, against the blue sky. Totally without\nornament, the house grimly suggested a prison.\n\nGervaise looked at the entrance, an immense doorway which rose to the\nheight of the second story and made a deep passage, at the end of\nwhich was a large courtyard. In the center of this doorway, which was\npaved like the street, ran a gutter full of pale rose-colored water.\n\n\"Come up,\" said Coupeau; \"they won't eat you.\"\n\nGervaise preferred to wait for him in the street, but she consented\nto go as far as the room of the concierge, which was within the porch,\non the left.\n\nWhen she had reached this place she again looked up.\n\nWithin there were six floors, instead of five, and four regular\nfacades surrounded the vast square of the courtyard. The walls were\ngray, covered with patches of leprous yellow, stained by the dripping\nfrom the slate-covered roof. The wall had not even a molding to break\nits dull uniformity--only the gutters ran across it. The windows had\nneither shutters nor blinds but showed the panes of glass which were\ngreenish and full of bubbles. Some were open, and from them hung\nchecked mattresses and sheets to air. Lines were stretched in front\nof others, on which the family wash was hung to dry--men's shirts,\nwomen's chemises and children's breeches! There was a look as if the\ndwellers under that roof found their quarters too small and were\noozing out at every crack and aperture.\n\nFor the convenience of each facade there was a narrow, high doorway,\nfrom which a damp passage led to the rear, where were four staircases\nwith iron railings. These each had one of the first four letters of\nthe alphabet painted at the side.\n\nThe _rez-de-chaussee_ was divided into enormous workshops and lit\nby windows black with dust. The forge of a locksmith blazed in one;\nfrom another came the sound of a carpenter's plane, while near the\ndoorway a pink stream from a dyeing establishment poured into the\ngutter. Pools of stagnant water stood in the courtyard, all littered\nwith shavings and fragments of charcoal. A few pale tufts of grass\nstruggled up between the flat stones, and the whole courtyard was\nlit but dimly.\n\nIn the shade near the water faucet three small hens were pecking\nwith the vain hope of finding a worm, and Gervaise looked about her,\namazed at the enormous place which seemed like a little world and as\ninterested in the house as if it were a living creature.\n\n\"Are you looking for anyone?\" asked the concierge, coming to her door\nconsiderably puzzled.\n\nBut the young woman explained that she was waiting for a friend and\nthen turned back toward the street. As Coupeau still delayed, she\nreturned to the courtyard, finding in it a strange fascination.\n\nThe house did not strike her as especially ugly. At some of the\nwindows were plants--a wallflower blooming in a pot--a caged canary,\nwho uttered an occasional warble, and several shaving mirrors caught\nthe light and shone like stars.\n\nA cabinetmaker sang, accompanied by the regular whistling sounds\nof his plane, while from the locksmith's quarters came a clatter\nof hammers struck in cadence.\n\nAt almost all the open windows the laughing, dirty faces of merry\nchildren were seen, and women sat with their calm faces in profile,\nbending over their work. It was the quiet time--after the morning\nlabors were over and the men were gone to their work and the house\nwas comparatively quiet, disturbed only by the sounds of the various\ntrades. The same refrain repeated hour after hour has a soothing\neffect, Gervaise thought.\n\nTo be sure, the courtyard was a little damp. Were she to live there,\nshe should certainly prefer a room on the sunny side.\n\nShe went in several steps and breathed that heavy odor of the homes of\nthe poor--an odor of old dust, of rancid dirt and grease--but as the\nacridity of the smells from the dyehouse predominated, she decided it\nto be far better than the Hotel Boncoeur.\n\nShe selected a window--a window in the corner on the left, where there\nwas a small box planted with scarlet beans, whose slender tendrils\nwere beginning to wind round a little arbor of strings.\n\n\"I have made you wait too long, I am afraid,\" said Coupeau, whom she\nsuddenly heard at her side. \"They make a great fuss when I do not dine\nthere, and she did not like it today, especially as my sister had\nbought veal. You are looking at this house,\" he continued. \"Think of\nit--it is always lit from top to bottom. There are a hundred lodgers\nin it. If I had any furniture I would have had a room in it long ago.\nIt would be very nice here, wouldn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" murmured Gervaise, \"very nice indeed. At Plassans there were\nnot so many people in one whole street. Look up at that window on the\nfifth floor--the window, I mean, where those beans are growing. See\nhow pretty that is!\"\n\nHe, with his usual recklessness, declared he would hire that room\nfor her, and they would live there together.\n\nShe turned away with a laugh and begged him not to talk any more\nnonsense. The house might stand or fall--they would never have a room\nin it together.\n\nBut Coupeau, all the same, was not reproved when he held her hand\nlonger than was necessary in bidding her farewell when they reached\nMme Fauconnier's laundry.\n\nFor another month the kindly intercourse between Gervaise and Coupeau\ncontinued on much the same footing. He thought her wonderfully\ncourageous, declared she was killing herself with hard work all day\nand sitting up half the night to sew for the children. She was not\nlike the women he had known; she took life too seriously, by far!\n\nShe laughed and defended herself modestly. Unfortunately, she said,\nshe had not always been discreet. She alluded to her first confinement\nwhen she was not more than fourteen and to the bottles of anisette she\nhad emptied with her mother, but she had learned much from experience,\nshe said. He was mistaken, however, in thinking she was persevering\nand strong. She was, on the contrary, very weak and too easily\ninfluenced, as she had discovered to her cost. Her dream had always\nbeen to live in a respectable way among respectable people, because\nbad company knocks the life out of a woman. She trembled when she\nthought of the future and said she was like a sou thrown up in the\nair, falling, heads up or down, according to chance, on the muddy\npavement. All she had seen, the bad example spread before her childish\neyes, had given her valuable lessons. But Coupeau laughed at these\ngloomy notions and brought back her courage by attempting to put his\narm around her waist. She slapped his hands, and he cried out that\n\"for a weak woman, she managed to hurt a fellow considerably!\"\n\nAs for himself, he was always as merry as a grig, and no fool, either.\nHe parted his hair carefully on one side, wore pretty cravats and\npatent-leather shoes on Sunday and was as saucy as only a fine\nParisian workman can be.\n\nThey were of mutual use to each other at the Hotel Boncoeur. Coupeau\nwent for her milk, did many little errands for her and carried home\nher linen to her customers and often took the children out to walk.\nGervaise, to return these courtesies, went up to the tiny room where\nhe slept and in his absence looked over his clothes, sewed on buttons\nand mended his garments. They grew to be very good and cordial\nfriends. He was to her a constant source of amusement. She listened\nto the songs he sang and to their slang and nonsense, which as yet\nhad for her much of the charm of novelty. But he began to grow uneasy,\nand his smiles were less frequent. He asked her whenever they met the\nsame question, \"When shall it be?\"\n\nShe answered invariably with a jest but passed her days in a fire\nof indelicate allusions, however, which did not bring a flush to\nher cheek. So long as he was not rough and brutal, she objected to\nnothing, but one day she was very angry when he, in trying to steal\na kiss, tore out a lock of her hair.\n\nAbout the last of June Coupeau became absolutely morose, and Gervaise\nwas so much disturbed by certain glances he gave her that she fairly\nbarricaded her door at night. Finally one Tuesday evening, when he had\nsulked from the previous Sunday, he came to her door at eleven in the\nevening. At first she refused to open it, but his voice was so gentle,\nso sad even, that she pulled away the barrier she had pushed against\nthe door for her better protection. When he came in she was startled\nand thought him ill; he was so deadly pale and his eyes were so\nbright. No, he was not ill, he said, but things could not go on\nlike this; he could not sleep.\n\n\"Listen, Madame Gervaise,\" he exclaimed with tears in his eyes and a\nstrange choking sensation in his throat. \"We must be married at once.\nThat is all there is to be said about it.\"\n\nGervaise was astonished and very grave.\n\n\"Oh, Monsieur Coupeau, I never dreamed of this, as you know very well,\nand you must not take such a step lightly.\"\n\nBut he continued to insist; he was certainly fully determined. He had\ncome down to her then, without waiting until morning, merely because\nhe needed a good sleep. As soon as she said yes he would leave her.\nBut he would not go until he heard that word.\n\n\"I cannot say yes in such a hurry,\" remonstrated Gervaise. \"I do not\nchoose to run the risk of your telling me at some future day that\nI led you into this. You are making a great mistake, I assure you.\nSuppose you should not see me for a week--you would forget me\nentirely. Men sometimes marry for a fancy and in twenty-four hours\nwould gladly take it all back. Sit down here and let us talk a\nlittle.\"\n\nThey sat in that dingy room lit only by one candle, which they forgot\nto snuff, and discussed the expediency of their marriage until after\nmidnight, speaking very low, lest they should disturb the children,\nwho were asleep with weir heads on the same pillow.\n\nAnd Gervaise pointed them out to Coupeau. That was an odd sort of\ndowry to carry a man, surely! How could she venture to go to him with\nsuch encumbrances? Then, too, she was troubled about another thing.\nPeople would laugh at him. Her story was known; her lover had been\nseen, and there would be no end of talk if she should marry now.\n\nTo all these good and excellent reasons Coupeau answered with a shrug\nof his shoulders. What did he care for talk and gossip? He never\nmeddled with the affairs of others; why should they meddle with his?\n\nYes, she had children, to be sure, and he would look out for them with\nher. He had never seen a woman in his life who was so good and so\ncourageous and patient. Besides, that had nothing to do with it! Had\nshe been ugly and lazy, with a dozen dirty children, he would have\nwanted her and only her.\n\n\"Yes,\" he continued, tapping her on the knee, \"you are the woman I\nwant, and none other. You have nothing to say against that, I\nsuppose?\"\n\nGervaise melted by degrees. Her resolution forsook her, and a weakness\nof her heart and her senses overwhelmed her in the face of this brutal\npassion. She ventured only a timid objection or two. Her hands lay\nloosely folded on her knees, while her face was very gentle and sweet.\n\nThrough the open window came the soft air of a fair June night; the\ncandle flickered in the wind; from the street came the sobs of a\nchild, the child of a drunken man who was lying just in front of the\ndoor in the street. From a long distance the breeze brought the notes\nof a violin playing at a restaurant for some late marriage festival--a\ndelicate strain it was, too, clear and sweet as musical glasses.\n\nCoupeau, seeing that the young woman had exhausted all her arguments,\nsnatched her hands and drew her toward him. She was in one of those\nmoods which she so much distrusted, when she could refuse no one\nanything. But the young man did not understand this, and he contented\nhimself with simply holding her hands closely in his.\n\n\"You say yes, do you not?\" he asked.\n\n\"How you tease,\" she replied. \"You wish it--well then, yes. Heaven\ngrant that the day will not come when you will be sorry for it.\"\n\nHe started up, lifting her from her feet, and kissed her loudly. He\nglanced at the children.\n\n\"Hush!\" he said. \"We must not wake the boys. Good night.\"\n\nAnd he went out of the room. Gervaise, trembling from head to foot,\nsat for a full hour on the side of her bed without undressing. She was\nprofoundly touched and thought Coupeau very honest and very kind. The\ntipsy man in the street uttered a groan like that of a wild beast, and\nthe notes of the violin had ceased.\n\nThe next evening Coupeau urged Gervaise to go with him to call on his\nsister. But the young woman shrank with ardent fear from this visit to\nthe Lorilleuxs'. She saw perfectly well that her lover stood in dread\nof these people.\n\nHe was in no way dependent on this sister, who was not the eldest\neither. Mother Coupeau would gladly give her consent, for she had\nnever been known to contradict her son. In the family, however, the\nLorilleuxs were supposed to earn ten francs per day, and this gave\nthem great weight. Coupeau would never venture to marry unless they\nagreed to accept his wife.\n\n\"I have told them about you,\" he said. \"Gervaise--good heavens, what\na baby you are! Come there tonight with me; you will find my sister\na little stiff, and Lorilleux is none too amiable. The truth is they\nare much vexed, because, you see, if I marry I shall no longer dine\nwith them--and that is their great economy. But that makes no odds;\nthey won't put you out of doors. Do what I ask, for it is absolutely\nnecessary.\"\n\nThese words frightened Gervaise nearly out of her wits. One Saturday\nevening, however, she consented. Coupeau came for her at half-past\neight. She was all ready, wearing a black dress, a shawl with printed\npalm leaves in yellow and a white cap with fluted ruffles. She had\nsaved seven francs for the shawl and two francs fifty centimes for\nthe cap; the dress was an old one, cleaned and made over.\n\n\"They expect you,\" said Coupeau as they walked along the street, \"and\nthey have become accustomed to the idea of seeing me married. They are\nreally quite amiable tonight. Then, too, if you have never seen a gold\nchain made you will be much amused in watching it. They have an order\nfor Monday.\"\n\n\"And have they gold in these rooms?\" asked Gervaise.\n\n\"I should say so! It is on the walls, on the floors--everywhere!\"\n\nBy this time they had reached the door and had entered the courtyard.\nThe Lorilleuxs lived on the sixth floor--staircase B. Coupeau told her\nwith a laugh to keep tight hold of the iron railing and not let it go.\n\nShe looked up, half shutting her eyes, and gasped as she saw the\nheight to which the staircase wound. The last gas burner, higher up,\nlooked like a star trembling in a black sky, while two others on\nalternate floors cast long, slanting rays down the interminable\nstairs.\n\n\"Aha!\" cried the young man as they stopped a moment on the second\nlanding. \"I smell onion soup; somebody has evidently been eating onion\nsoup about here, and it smells good too.\"\n\nIt is true. Staircase B, dirty and greasy, both steps and railing with\nplastering knocked off and showing the laths beneath, was permeated\nwith the smell of cooking. From each landing ran narrow corridors,\nand on either side were half-open doors painted yellow and black, with\nfinger marks about the lock and handles, and through the open window\ncame the damp, disgusting smell of sinks and sewers mingling with the\nodor of onions.\n\nUp to the sixth floor came the noises from the\n_rez-de-chaussee_--the rattling of dishes being washed, the\nscraping of saucepans, and all that sort of thing. On one floor\nGervaise saw through an open door on which were the words DESIGNER AND\nDRAUGHTSMAN in large letters two men seated at a table covered with a\nvarnished cloth; they were disputing violently amid thick clouds of\nsmoke from their pipes. The second and third floors were the quietest.\nHere through the open doors came the sound of a cradle rocking, the\nwail of a baby, a woman's voice, the rattle of a spoon against a cup.\nOn one door she read a placard, MME GAUDRON, CARDER; on the next, M.\nMADINIER, MANUFACTURER OF BOXES.\n\nOn the fourth there was a great quarrel going on--blows and\noaths--which did not prevent the neighbors opposite from playing cards\nwith their door wide open for the benefit of the air. When Gervaise\nreached the fifth floor she was out of breath. Such innumerable stairs\nwere a novelty to her. These winding railings made her dizzy. One\nfamily had taken possession of the landing; the father was washing\nplates in a small earthen pan near the sink, while the mother was\nscrubbing the baby before putting it to sleep. Coupeau laughingly bade\nGervaise keep up her courage, and at last they reached the top, and\nshe looked around to see whence came the clear, shrill voice which\nshe had heard above all other sounds ever since her foot touched the\nfirst stair. It was a little old woman who sang as she worked, and her\nwork was dressing dolls at three cents apiece. Gervaise clung to the\nrailing, all out of breath, and looked down into the depths below--the\ngas burner now looked like a star at the bottom of a deep well. The\nsmells, the turbulent life of this great house, seemed to rush over\nher in one tremendous gust. She gasped and turned pale.\n\n\"We have not got there yet,\" said Coupeau; \"we have much farther\nto go.\" And he turned to the left and then to the right again. The\ncorridor stretched out before them, faintly lit by an occasional gas\nburner; a succession of doors, like those of a prison or a convent,\ncontinued to appear, nearly all wide open, showing the sordid\ninteriors. Finally they reached a corridor that was entirely dark.\n\n\"Here we are,\" said the tinworker. \"Isn't it a journey? Look out\nfor three steps. Hold onto the wall.\"\n\nAnd Gervaise moved cautiously for ten paces or more. She counted the\nthree steps, and then Coupeau pushed open a door without knocking.\nA bright light streamed forth. They went in.\n\nIt was a long, narrow apartment, almost like a prolongation of the\ncorridor; a woolen curtain, faded and spotted, drawn on one side,\ndivided the room in two.\n\nOne compartment, the first, contained a bed pushed under the corner\nof the mansard roof; a stove, still warm from the cooking of the\ndinner; two chairs, a table and a wardrobe. To place this last piece\nof furniture where it stood, between the bed and the door, had\nnecessitated sawing away a portion of the ceiling.\n\nThe second compartment was the workshop. At the back, a tiny forge\nwith bellows; on the right, a vice screwed against the wall under\nan _etagere_, where were iron tools piled up; on the left, in front\nof the window, was a small table covered with pincers, magnifying\nglasses, tiny scales and shears--all dirty and greasy.\n\n\"We have come!\" cried Coupeau, going as far as the woolen curtain.\n\nBut he was not answered immediately.\n\nGervaise, much agitated by the idea that she was entering a place\nfilled with gold, stood behind her friend and did not know whether\nto speak or retreat.\n\nThe bright light which came from a lamp and also from a brazier of\ncharcoal in the forge added to her trouble. She saw Mme Lorilleux,\na small, dark woman, agile and strong, drawing with all the vigor\nof her arms--assisted by a pair of pincers--a thread of black metal,\nwhich she passed through the holes of a drawplate held by the vice.\nBefore the desk or table in front of the window sat Lorilleux, as\nshort as his wife, but with broader shoulders. He was managing a tiny\npair of pincers and doing some work so delicate that it was almost\nimperceptible. It was he who first looked up and lifted his head with\nits scanty yellow hair. His face was the color of old wax, was long\nand had an expression of physical suffering.\n\n\"Ah, it is you, is it? Well! Well! But we are in a hurry, you\nunderstand. We have an order to fill. Don't come into the workroom.\nRemain in the chamber.\" And he returned to his work; his face was\nreflected in a ball filled with water, through which the lamp sent\non his work a circle of the brightest possible light.\n\n\"Find chairs for yourselves,\" cried Mme Lorilleux. \"This is the lady,\nI suppose. Very well! Very well!\"\n\nShe rolled up her wire and carried it to the forge, and then she\nfanned the coals a little to quicken the heat.\n\nCoupeau found two chairs and made Gervaise seat herself near the\ncurtain. The room was so narrow that he could not sit beside her, so\nhe placed his chair a little behind and leaned over her to give her\nthe information he deemed desirable.\n\nGervaise, astonished by the strange reception given her by these\npeople and uncomfortable under their sidelong glances, had a buzzing\nin her ears which prevented her from hearing what was said.\n\nShe thought the woman very old looking for her thirty years and also\nextremely untidy, with her hair tumbling over her shoulders and her\ndirty camisole.\n\nThe husband, not more than a year older, seemed to Gervaise really\nan old man with thin, compressed lips and bowed figure. He was in his\nshirt sleeves, and his naked feet were thrust into slippers down at\nthe heel.\n\nShe was infinitely astonished at the smallness of the atelier, at the\nblackened walls and at the terrible heat.\n\nTiny drops bedewed the waxed forehead of Lorilleux himself, while Mme\nLorilleux threw off her sack and stood in bare arms and chemise half\nslipped off.\n\n\"And the gold?\" asked Gervaise softly.\n\nHer eager eyes searched the corners, hoping to discover amid all the\ndirt something of the splendor of which she had dreamed.\n\nBut Coupeau laughed.\n\n\"Gold?\" he said. \"Look! Here it is--and here--and here again, at your\nfeet.\"\n\nHe pointed in succession to the fine thread with which his sister was\nbusy and at another package of wire hung against the wall near the\nvice; then falling down on his hands and knees, he gathered up from\nthe floor, on the tip of his moistened finger, several tiny specks\nwhich looked like needle points.\n\nGervaise cried out, \"That surely is not gold! That black metal which\nlooks precisely like iron!\"\n\nHer lover laughed and explained to her the details of the manufacture\nin which his brother-in-law was engaged. The wire was furnished them\nin coils, just as it hung against the wall, and then they were obliged\nto heat and reheat it half a dozen times during their manipulations,\nlest it should break. Considerable strength and a vast deal of skill\nwere needed, and his sister had both. He had seen her draw out the\ngold until it was like a hair. She would never let her husband do it\nbecause he always had a cough.\n\nAll this time Lorilleux was watching Gervaise stealthily, and after\na violent fit of coughing he said with an air as if he were speaking\nto himself:\n\n\"I make columns.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Coupeau in an explanatory voice, \"there are four different\nkinds of chains, and his style is called a column.\"\n\nLorilleux uttered a little grunt of satisfaction, all the time at\nwork, with the tiny pincers held between very dirty nails.\n\n\"Look here, Cadet-Cassis,\" he said. \"This very morning I made a little\ncalculation. I began my work when I was only twelve years old. How\nmany yards do you think I have made up to this day?\"\n\nHe lifted his pale face.\n\n\"Eight thousand! Do you understand? Eight thousand! Enough to twist\naround the necks of all the women in this _Quartier_.\"\n\nGervaise returned to her chair, entirely disenchanted. She thought it\nwas all very ugly and uninteresting. She smiled in order to gratify\nthe Lorilleuxs, but she was annoyed and troubled at the profound\nsilence they preserved in regard to her marriage, on account of which\nshe had called there that evening. These people treated her as if she\nwere simply a spectator whose curiosity had induced Coupeau to bring\nher to see their work.\n\nThey began to talk; it was about the lodgers in the house. Mme\nLorilleux asked her brother if he had not heard those Benard people\nquarreling as he came upstairs. She said the husband always came home\ntipsy. Then she spoke of the designer, who was overwhelmed with debts,\nalways smoking and always quarreling. The landlord was going to turn\nout the Coquets, who owed three quarters now and who would put their\nfurnace out on the landing, which was very dangerous. Mlle Remanjon,\nas she was going downstairs with a bundle of dolls, was just in time\nto rescue one of the children from being burned alive.\n\nGervaise was beginning to find the place unendurable. The heat was\nsuffocating; the door could not be opened, because the slightest draft\ngave Lorilleux a cold. As they ignored the marriage question utterly,\nshe pulled her lover's sleeve to signify her wish to depart. He\nunderstood and was himself annoyed at this affectation of silence.\n\n\"We are going,\" he said coldly, \"We do not care to interrupt your\nwork any longer.\"\n\nHe lingered a moment, hoping for a word or an allusion. Suddenly he\ndecided to begin the subject himself.\n\n\"We rely on you, Lorilleux. You will be my wife's witness,\" he said.\n\nThe man lifted his head in affected surprise, while his wife stood\nstill in the center of the workshop.\n\n\"Are you in earnest?\" he murmured, and then continued as if\nsoliloquizing, \"It is hard to know when this confounded Cadet-Cassis\nis in earnest.\"\n\n\"We have no advice to give,\" interrupted his wife. \"It is a foolish\nnotion, this marrying, and it never succeeds. Never--no--never.\"\n\nShe drawled out these last words, examining Gervaise from head to foot\nas she spoke.\n\n\"My brother is free to do as he pleases, of course,\" she continued.\n\"Of course his family would have liked--But then people always plan,\nand things turn out so different. Of course it is none of my business.\nHad he brought me the lowest of the low, I should have said, 'Marry\nher and let us live in peace!' He was very comfortable with us,\nnevertheless. He has considerable flesh on his bones and does not look\nas if he had been starved. His soup was always ready to the minute.\nTell me, Lorilleux, don't you think that my brother's friend looks\nlike Therese--you know whom I mean--that woman opposite, who died of\nconsumption?\"\n\n\"She certainly does,\" answered the chainmaker contemplatively.\n\n\"And you have two children, madame? I said to my brother I could not\nunderstand how he could marry a woman with two children. You must not\nbe angry if I think of his interests; it is only natural. You do not\nlook very strong. Say, Lorilleux, don't you think that Madame looks\ndelicate?\"\n\nThis courteous pair made no allusion to her lameness, but Gervaise\nfelt it to be in their minds. She sat stiff and still before them, her\nthin shawl with its yellow palm leaves wrapped closely about her, and\nanswered in monosyllables, as if before her judges. Coupeau, realizing\nher sufferings, cried out:\n\n\"This is all nonsense you are talking! What I want to know is if the\nday will suit you, July twenty-ninth.\"\n\n\"One day is the same as another to us,\" answered his sister severely.\n\"Lorilleux can do as he pleases in regard to being your witness. I\nonly ask for peace.\"\n\nGervaise, in her embarrassment, had been pushing about with her feet\nsome of the rubbish on the floor; then fearing she had done some harm,\nshe stooped to ascertain. Lorilleux hastily approached her with a lamp\nand looked at her fingers with evident suspicion.\n\n\"Take care,\" he said. \"Those small bits of gold stick to the shoes\nsometimes and are carried off without your knowing it.\"\n\nThis was a matter of some importance, of course, for his employers\nweighed what they entrusted to him. He showed the hare's-foot with\nwhich he brushed the particles of gold from the table and the skin\nspread on his knees to receive them. Twice each week the shop was\ncarefully brushed; all the rubbish was kept and burned, and the ashes\nwere examined, where were found each month twenty-five or thirty\nfrancs of gold.\n\nMme Lorilleux did not take her eyes from the shoes of her guest.\n\n\"If Mademoiselle would be so kind,\" she murmured with an amiable\nsmile, \"and would just look at her soles herself. There is no cause\nfor offense, I am sure!\"\n\nGervaise, indignant and scarlet, reseated herself and held up her\nshoes for examination. Coupeau opened the door with a gay good night,\nand she followed him into the corridor after a word or two of polite\nfarewell.\n\nThe Lorilleuxs turned to their work at the end of their room where\nthe tiny forge still glittered. The woman with her chemise slipped off\nher shoulder which was red with the reflection from the brazier, was\ndrawing out another wire, the muscles in her throat swelling with her\nexertions.\n\nThe husband, stooping under the green light of the ball of water, was\nagain busy with his pincers, not stopping even to wipe the sweat from\nhis brow.\n\nWhen Gervaise emerged from the narrow corridors on the sixth landing\nshe said with tears in her eyes:\n\n\"This certainly does not promise very well!\"\n\nCoupeau shook his head angrily. Lorilleux should pay for this evening!\nWas there ever such a miser? To care if one carried off three grains\nof gold in the dust on one's shoes. All the stories his sister told\nwere pure fictions and malice. His sister never meant him to marry;\nhis eating with them saved her at least four sous daily. But he did\nnot care whether they appeared on the twenty-ninth of July or not;\nhe could get along without them perfectly well.\n\nBut Gervaise, as she descended the staircase, felt her heart swell\nwith pain and fear. She did not like the strange shadows on the dimly\nlit stairs. From behind the doors, now closed, came the heavy\nbreathing of sleepers who had gone to their beds on rising from the\ntable. A faint laugh was heard from one room, while a slender thread\nof light filtered through the keyhole of the old lady who was still\nbusy with her dolls, cutting out the gauze dresses with squeaking\nscissors. A child was crying on the next floor, and the smell from\nthe sinks was worse than ever and seemed something tangible amid this\nsilent darkness. Then in the courtyard, while Coupeau pulled the cord,\nGervaise turned and examined the house once more. It seemed enormous\nas it stood black against the moonless sky. The gray facades rose tall\nand spectral; the windows were all shut. No clothes fluttered in the\nbreeze; there was literally not the smallest look of life, except in\nthe few windows that were still lighted. From the damp corner of the\ncourtyard came the drip-drip of the fountain. Suddenly it seemed to\nGervaise as if the house were striding toward her and would crush her\nto the earth. A moment later she smiled at her foolish fancy.\n\n\"Take care!\" cried Coupeau.\n\nAnd as she passed out of the courtyard she was compelled to jump over\na little sea which had run from the dyer's. This time the water was\nblue, as blue as the summer sky, and the reflection of the lamps\ncarried by the concierge was like the stars themselves.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nA MARRIAGE OF THE PEOPLE\n\nGervaise did not care for any great wedding. Why should they spend\ntheir money so foolishly? Then, too, she felt a little ashamed and\ndid not care to parade their marriage before the whole _Quartier_.\nBut Coupeau objected. It would never do not to have some\nfestivities--a little drive and a supper, perhaps, at a restaurant;\nhe would ask for nothing more. He vowed that no one should drink too\nmuch and finally obtained the young woman's consent and organized a\npicnic at five francs per head at the Moulin d'Argent, Boulevard de\nla Chapelle. He was a small wine merchant who had a garden back of\nhis restaurant. He made out a list. Among others appeared the names of\ntwo of his comrades, Bibi-la-Grillade and Mes-Bottes. It was true that\nMes-Bottes crooked his elbow, but he was so deliciously funny that he\nwas always invited to picnics. Gervaise said she, in her turn, would\nbring her employer, Mme Fauconnier--all told, there would be fifteen\nat the table. That was quite enough.\n\nNow as Coupeau was literally penniless, he borrowed fifty francs from\nhis employer. He first bought his wedding ring; it cost twelve francs\nout of the shop, but his brother-in-law purchased it for him for nine\nat the factory. He then ordered an overcoat, pantaloons and vest\nfrom a tailor to whom he paid twenty-five francs on account. His\npatent-leather shoes and his bolivar could last awhile longer. Then\nhe put aside his ten francs for the picnic, which was what he and\nGervaise must pay, and they had precisely six francs remaining, the\nprice of a Mass at the altar of the poor. He had no liking for those\nblack frocks, and it broke his heart to give these beloved francs\nto them. But a marriage without a Mass, he had heard, was really\nno marriage at all.\n\nHe went to the church to see if he could not drive a better bargain,\nand for an hour he fought with a stout little priest in a dirty\nsoutane who, finally declaring that God could never bless such a\nunion, agreed that the Mass should cost only five francs. Thus Coupeau\nhad twenty sous in hand with which to begin the world!\n\nGervaise, in her turn, had made her preparations, had worked late\ninto the night and laid aside thirty francs. She had set her heart\non a silk mantelet marked thirteen francs, which she had seen in a\nshopwindow. She paid for it and bought for ten francs from the husband\nof a laundress who had died in Mme Fauconnier's house a delaine dress\nof a deep blue, which she made over entirely. With the seven francs\nthat remained she bought a rose for her cap, a pair of white cotton\ngloves and shoes for Claude. Fortunately both the boys had nice\nblouses. She worked for four days mending and making; there was not\na hole or a rip in anything. At last the evening before the important\nday arrived; Gervaise and Coupeau sat together and talked, happy that\nmatters were so nearly concluded. Their arrangements were all made.\nThey were to go to the mayor's office--the two sisters of Coupeau\ndeclared they would remain at home, their presence not being necessary\nthere. Then Mother Coupeau began to weep, saying she wished to go\nearly and hide in a corner, and they promised to take her.\n\nThe hour fixed for the party to assemble at the Moulin d'Argent was\none o'clock sharp. From then they were to seek an appetite on the\nPlaine-St-Denis and return by rail. Saturday morning, as he dressed,\nCoupeau thought with some anxiety of his scanty funds; he supposed\nhe ought to offer a glass of wine and a slice of ham to his witnesses\nwhile waiting for dinner; unexpected expenses might arise; no, it was\nclear that twenty sous was not enough. He consequently, after taking\nClaude and Etienne to Mlle Boche, who promised to appear with them at\ndinner, ran to his brother-in-law and borrowed ten francs; he did it\nwith reluctance, and the words stuck in his throat, for he half\nexpected a refusal. Lorilleux grumbled and growled but finally lent\nthe money. But Coupeau heard his sister mutter under her breath,\n\"That is a good beginning.\"\n\nThe civil marriage was fixed for half-past ten. The day was clear and\nthe sun intensely hot. In order not to excite observation the bridal\npair, the mother and the four witnesses, separated--Gervaise walked\nin front, having the arm of Lorilleux, while M. Madinier gave his\nto Mamma Coupeau; on the opposite sidewalk were Coupeau, Boche and\nBibi-la-Grillade. These three wore black frock coats and walked with\ntheir arms dangling from their rounded shoulders. Boche wore yellow\npantaloons. Bibi-la-Grillade's coat was buttoned to the chin, as he\nhad no vest, and a wisp of a cravat was tied around his neck.\n\nM. Madinier was the only one who wore a dress coat, a superb coat\nwith square tails, and people stared as he passed with the stout Mamma\nCoupeau in a green shawl and black bonnet with black ribbons. Gervaise\nwas very sweet and gentle, wearing her blue dress and her trim little\nsilk mantle. She listened graciously to Lorilleux, who, in spite of\nthe warmth of the day, was nearly lost in the ample folds of a loose\novercoat. Occasionally she would turn her head and glance across the\nstreet with a little smile at Coupeau, who was none too comfortable\nin his new clothes. They reached the mayor's office a half-hour too\nearly, and their turn was not reached until nearly eleven. They sat in\nthe corner of the office, stiff and uneasy, pushing back their chairs\na little out of politeness each time one of the clerks passed them,\nand when the magistrate appeared they all rose respectfully. They were\nbidden to sit down again, which they did, and were the spectators of\nthree marriages--the brides in white and the bridesmaids in pink and\nblue, quite fine and stylish.\n\nWhen their own turn came Bibi-la-Grillade had disappeared, and Boche\nhunted him up in the square, where he had gone to smoke a pipe. All\nthe forms were so quickly completed that the party looked at each\nother in dismay, feeling as if they had been defrauded of half the\nceremony. Gervaise listened with tears in her eyes, and the old lady\nwept audibly.\n\nThen they turned to the register and wrote their names in big, crooked\nletters--all but the newly made husband, who, not being able to write,\ncontented himself with making a cross.\n\nThen the clerk handed the certificate to Coupeau. He, admonished by\na touch of his wife's elbow, presented him with five sous.\n\nIt was quite a long walk from the mayor's office to the church. The\nmen stopped midway to take a glass of beer, and Gervaise and Mamma\nCoupeau drank some cassis with water. There was not a particle of\nshade, for the sun was directly above their heads. The beadle awaited\nthem in the empty church; he hurried them toward a small chapel,\nasking them indignantly if they were not ashamed to mock at religion\nby coming so late. A priest came toward them with an ashen face, faint\nwith hunger, preceded by a boy in a dirty surplice. He hurried through\nthe service, gabbling the Latin phrases with sidelong glances at the\nbridal party. The bride and bridegroom knelt before the altar in\nconsiderable embarrassment, not knowing when it was necessary to kneel\nand when to stand and not always understanding the gestures made by\nthe clerk.\n\nThe witnesses thought it more convenient to stand all the time, while\nMamma Coupeau, overcome by her tears again, shed them on a prayer book\nwhich she had borrowed from a neighbor.\n\nIt was high noon. The last Mass was said, and the church was noisy\nwith the movements of the sacristans, who were putting the chairs in\ntheir places. The center altar was being prepared for some fete, for\nthe hammers were heard as the decorations were being nailed up. And in\nthe choking dust raised by the broom of the man who was sweeping the\ncorner of the small altar the priest laid his cold and withered hand\non the heads of Gervaise and Coupeau with a sulky air, as if he were\nuniting them as a mere matter of business or to occupy the time\nbetween the two Masses.\n\nWhen the signatures were again affixed to the register in the vestry\nand the party stood outside in the sunshine, they had a sensation as\nif they had been driven at full speed and were glad to rest.\n\n\"I feel as if I had been at the dentist's. We had no time to cry out\nbefore it was all over!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" muttered Lorilleux, \"they take less than five minutes to do\nwhat can't be undone in all one's life! Poor Cadet-Cassis!\"\n\nGervaise kissed her new mother with tears in her eyes but with smiling\nlips. She answered the old woman gently:\n\n\"Do not be afraid. I will do my best to make him happy. If things turn\nout ill it shall not be my fault.\"\n\nThe party went at once to the Moulin d'Argent. Coupeau now walked with\nhis wife some little distance in advance of the others. They whispered\nand laughed together and seemed to see neither the people nor the\nhouses nor anything that was going on about them.\n\nAt the restaurant Coupeau ordered at once some bread and ham; then\nseeing that Boche and Bibi-la-Grillade were really hungry, he ordered\nmore wine and more meat. His mother could eat nothing, and Gervaise,\nwho was dying of thirst, drank glass after glass of water barely\nreddened with wine.\n\n\"This is my affair,\" said Coupeau, going to the counter where he paid\nfour francs, five sous.\n\nThe guests began to arrive. Mme Fauconnier, stout and handsome, was\nthe first. She wore a percale gown, ecru ground with bright figures,\na rose-colored cravat and a bonnet laden with flowers. Then came Mlle\nRemanjon in her scanty black dress, which seemed so entirely a part\nof herself that it was doubtful if she laid it aside at night. The\nGaudron household followed. The husband, enormously stout, looked as\nif his vest would burst at the least movement, and his wife, who was\nnearly as huge as himself, was dressed in a delicate shade of violet\nwhich added to her apparent size.\n\n\"Ah,\" cried Mme Lerat as she entered, \"we are going to have a\ntremendous shower!\" And she bade them all look out the window\nto see how black the clouds were.\n\nMme Lerat, Coupeau's eldest sister, was a tall, thin woman, very\nmasculine in appearance and talking through her nose, wearing a\npuce-colored dress that was much too loose for her. It was profusely\ntrimmed with fringe, which made her look like a lean dog just coming\nout of the water. She brandished an umbrella as she talked, as if it\nhad been a walking stick. As she kissed Gervaise she said:\n\n\"You have no idea how the wind blows, and it is as hot as a blast\nfrom a furnace!\"\n\nEverybody at once declared they had felt the storm coming all the\nmorning. Three days of extreme heat, someone said, always ended in\na gust.\n\n\"It will blow over,\" said Coupeau with an air of confidence, \"but\nI wish my sister would come, all the same.\"\n\nMme Lorilleux, in fact, was very late. Mme Lerat had called for her,\nbut she had not then begun to dress. \"And,\" said the widow in her\nbrother's ear, \"you never saw anything like the temper she was in!\"\n\nThey waited another half-hour. The sky was growing blacker and\nblacker. Clouds of dust were rising along the street, and down came\nthe rain. And it was in the first shower that Mme Lorilleux arrived,\nout of temper and out of breath, struggling with her umbrella, which\nshe could not close.\n\n\"I had ten minds,\" she exclaimed, \"to turn back. I wanted you to wait\nuntil next Saturday. I knew it would rain today--I was certain of it!\"\n\nCoupeau tried to calm her, but she quickly snubbed him. Was it he, she\nwould like to know, who was to pay for her dress if it were spoiled?\n\nShe wore black silk, so tight that the buttonholes were burst out, and\nit showed white on the shoulders,--while the skirt was so scant that\nshe could not take a long step.\n\nThe other women, however, looked at her silk with envy.\n\nShe took no notice of Gervaise, who sat by the side of her\nmother-in-law. She called to Lorilleux and with his aid carefully\nwiped every drop of rain from her dress with her handkerchief.\n\nMeanwhile the shower ceased abruptly, but the storm was evidently not\nover, for sharp flashes of lightning darted through the black clouds.\n\nSuddenly the rain poured down again. The men stood in front of the\ndoor with their hands in their pockets, dismally contemplating the\nscene. The women crouched together with their hands over their eyes.\nThey were in such terror they could not talk; when the thunder was\nheard farther off they all plucked up their spirits and became\nimpatient, but a fine rain was falling that looked interminable.\n\n\"What are we to do?\" cried Mme Lorilleux crossly.\n\nThen Mlle Remanjon timidly observed that the sun perhaps would soon\nbe out, and they might yet go into the country; upon this there was\none general shout of derision.\n\n\"Nice walking it would be! And how pleasant the grass would be to sit\nupon!\"\n\nSomething must be done, however, to get rid of the time until dinner.\nBibi-la-Grillade proposed cards; Mme Lerat suggested storytelling.\nTo each proposition a thousand objections were offered. Finally when\nLorilleux proposed that the party should visit the tomb of Abelard\nand Heloise his wife's indignation burst forth.\n\nShe had dressed in her best only to be drenched in the rain and to\nspend the day in a wineshop, it seemed! She had had enough of the\nwhole thing and she would go home. Coupeau and Lorilleux held the\ndoor, she exclaiming violently:\n\n\"Let me go; I tell you I will go!\"\n\nHer husband having induced her to listen to reason, Coupeau went to\nGervaise, who was calmly conversing with her mother-in-law and Mme\nFauconnier.\n\n\"Have you nothing to propose?\" he asked, not venturing to add any term\nof endearment.\n\n\"No,\" she said with a smile, \"but I am ready to do anything you wish.\nI am very well suited as I am.\"\n\nHer face was indeed as sunny as a morning in May. She spoke to\neveryone kindly and sympathetically. During the storm she had sat\nwith her eyes riveted on the clouds, as if by the light of those\nlurid flashes she was reading the solemn book of the future.\n\nM. Madinier had proposed nothing; he stood leaning against the counter\nwith a pompous air; he spat upon the ground, wiped his mouth with the\nback of his hand and rolled his eyes about.\n\n\"We could go to the Musee du Louvre, I suppose,\" and he smoothed his\nchin while awaiting the effect of this proposition.\n\n\"There are antiquities there--statues, pictures, lots of things. It\nis very instructive. Have any of you been there?\" he asked.\n\nThey all looked at each other. Gervaise had never even heard of the\nplace, nor had Mme Fauconnier nor Boche. Coupeau thought he had been\nthere one Sunday, but he was not sure, but Mme Lorilleux, on whom\nMadinier's air of importance had produced a profound impression,\napproved of the idea. The day was wasted anyway; therefore, if a\nlittle instruction could be got it would be well to try it. As\nthe rain was still falling, they borrowed old umbrellas of every\nimaginable hue from the establishment and started forth for the\nMusee du Louvre.\n\nThere were twelve of them, and they walked in couples, Mme Lorilleux\nwith Madinier, to whom she grumbled all the way.\n\n\"We know nothing about her,\" she said, \"not even where he picked her\nup. My husband has already lent them ten francs, and whoever heard of\na bride without a single relation? She said she had a sister in Paris.\nWhere is she today, I should like to know!\"\n\nShe checked herself and pointed to Gervaise, whose lameness was very\nperceptible as she descended the hill.\n\n\"Just look at her!\" she muttered. \"Wooden legs!\"\n\nThis epithet was heard by Mme Fauconnier, who took up the cudgels for\nGervaise who, she said, was as neat as a pin and worked like a tiger.\n\nThe wedding party, coming out of La Rue St-Denis, crossed the\nboulevard under their umbrellas amid the pouring rain, driving here\nand there among the carriages. The drivers, as they pulled up their\nhorses, shouted to them to look out, with an oath. On the gray and\nmuddy sidewalk the procession was very conspicuous--the blue dress of\nthe bride, the canary-colored breeches of one of the men, Madinier's\nsquare-tailed coat--all gave a carnivallike air to the group. But it\nwas the hats of the party that were the most amusing, for they were\nof all heights, sizes and styles. The shopkeepers on the boulevard\ncrowded to their windows to enjoy the drollery of the sight.\nThe wedding procession, quite undisturbed by the observation it\nexcited, went gaily on. They stopped for a moment on the Place des\nVictoire--the bride's shoestring was untied--she fastened it at the\nfoot of the statue of Louis XIV, her friends waiting as she did so.\n\nFinally they reached the Louvre. Here Madinier politely asked\npermission to take the head of the party; the place was so large,\nhe said, that it was a very easy thing to lose oneself; he knew the\nprettiest rooms and the things best worth seeing, because he had\noften been there with an artist, a very intelligent fellow, from\nwhom a great manufacturer of pasteboard boxes bought pictures.\n\nThe party entered the museum of Assyrian antiquities. They shivered\nand walked about, examining the colossal statues, the gods in black\nmarble, strange beasts and monstrosities, half cats and half women.\nThis was not amusing, and an inscription in Phoenician characters\nappalled them. Who on earth had ever read such stuff as that? It\nwas meaningless nonsense!\n\nBut Madinier shouted to them from the stairs, \"Come on! That is\nnothing! Much more interesting things up here, I assure you!\"\n\nThe severe nudity of the great staircase cast a gloom over their\nspirits; an usher in livery added to their awe, and it was with great\nrespect and on the tips of their toes they entered the French gallery.\n\nHow many statues! How many pictures! They wished they had all the\nmoney they had cost.\n\nIn the Gallerie d'Apollon the floor excited their admiration; it was\nsmooth as glass; even the feet of the sofas were reflected in it.\nMadinier bade them look at the ceiling and at its many beauties of\ndecoration, but they said they dared not look up. Then before entering\nthe Salon Carre he pointed to the window and said:\n\n\"That is the balcony where Charles IX fired on the people!\"\n\nWith a magnificent gesture he ordered his party to stand still in the\ncenter of the Salon Carre.\n\n\"There are only chefs-d'oeuvres here,\" he whispered as solemnly as if\nhe had been in a church.\n\nThey walked around the salon. Gervaise asked the meaning of one of\nthe pictures, the _Noces de Cana_; Coupeau stopped before _La\nJoconde_, declaring that it was like one of his aunts.\n\nBoche and Bibi-la-Grillade snickered and pushed each other at the\nsight of the nude female figures, and the Gaudrons, husband and wife,\nstood open-mouthed and deeply touched before Murillo's Virgin.\n\nWhen they had been once around the room Madinier, who was quite\nattentive to Mme Lorilleux on account of her silk gown, proposed\nthey should do it over again; it was well worth it, he said.\n\nHe never hesitated in replying to any question which she addressed\nto him in her thirst for information, and when she stopped before\nTitian's Mistress, whose yellow hair struck her as like her own, he\ntold her it was a mistress of Henri IV, who was the heroine of a play\nthen running at the Ambigu.\n\nThe wedding party finally entered the long gallery devoted to the\nItalian and Flemish schools of art. The pictures were all meaningless\nto them, and their heads were beginning to ache. They felt a thrill\nof interest, however, in the copyists with their easels, who painted\nwithout being disturbed by spectators. The artists scattered through\nthe rooms had heard that a primitive wedding party was making a tour\nof the Louvre and hurried with laughing faces to enjoy the scene,\nwhile the weary bride and bridegroom, accompanied by their friends,\nclumsily moved about over the shining, resounding floors much like\ncattle let loose and with quite as keen an appreciation of the\nmarvelous beauties about them.\n\nThe women vowed their backs were broken standing so long, and\nMadinier, declaring he knew the way, said they would leave after he\nhad shown them a certain room to which he could go with his eyes shut.\nBut he was very much mistaken. Salon succeeded to salon, and finally\nthe party went up a flight of stairs and found themselves among\ncannons and other instruments of war. Madinier, unwilling to confess\nthat he had lost himself, wandered distractedly about, declaring that\nthe doors had been changed. The party began to feel that they were\nthere for life, when suddenly to their great joy they heard the cry\nof the janitors resounding from room to room.\n\n\"Time to close the doors!\"\n\nThey meekly followed one of them, and when they were outside they\nuttered a sigh of relief as they put up their umbrellas once more,\nbut one and all affected great pleasure at having been to the Louvre.\n\nThe clock struck four. There were two hours to dispose of before\ndinner. The women would have liked to rest, but the men were more\nenergetic and proposed another walk, during which so tremendous a\nshower fell that umbrellas were useless and dresses were irretrievably\nruined. Then M. Madinier suggested that they should ascend the column\non the Place Vendome.\n\n\"It is not a bad idea,\" cried the men. And the procession began the\nascent of the spiral staircase, which Boche said was so old that he\ncould feel it shake. This terrified the ladies, who uttered little\nshrieks, but Coupeau said nothing; his arm was around his wife's\nwaist, and just as they emerged upon the platform he kissed her.\n\n\"Upon my word!\" cried Mme Lorilleux, much scandalized.\n\nMadinier again constituted himself master of ceremonies and pointed\nout all the monuments, but Mme Fauconnier would not put her foot\noutside the little door; she would not look down on that pavement for\nall the world, she said, and the party soon tired of this amusement\nand descended the stairs. At the foot Madinier wished to pay, but\nCoupeau interfered and put into the hand of the guard twenty-four\nsous--two for each person. It was now half-past five; they had just\ntime to get to the restaurant, but Coupeau proposed a glass of\nvermouth first, and they entered a cabaret for that purpose.\n\nWhen they returned to the Moulin d'Argent they found Mme Boche with\nthe two children, talking to Mamma Coupeau near the table, already\nspread and waiting. When Gervaise saw Claude and Etienne she took\nthem both on her knees and kissed them lovingly.\n\n\"Have they been good?\" she asked.\n\n\"I should think Coupeau would feel rather queer!\" said Mme Lorilleux\nas she looked on grimly.\n\nGervaise had been calm and smiling all day, but she had quietly\nwatched her husband with the Lorilleuxs. She thought Coupeau was\nafraid of his sister--cowardly, in fact. The evening previous he had\nsaid he did not care a sou for their opinion on any subject and that\nthey had the tongues of vipers, but now he was with them, he was like\na whipped hound, hung on their words and anticipated their wishes.\nThis troubled his wife, for it augured ill, she thought, for their\nfuture happiness.\n\n\"We won't wait any longer for Mes-Bottes,\" cried Coupeau. \"We are all\nhere but him, and his scent is good! Surely he can't be waiting for us\nstill at St-Denis!\"\n\nThe guests, in good spirits once more, took their seats with a great\nclatter of chairs.\n\nGervaise was between Lorilleux and Madinier, and Coupeau between Mme\nFauconnier and his sister Mme Lorilleux. The others seated themselves.\n\n\"No one has asked a blessing,\" said Boche as the ladies pulled the\ntablecloth well over their skirts to protect them from spots.\n\nBut Mme Lorilleux frowned at this poor jest. The vermicelli soup,\nwhich was cold and greasy, was eaten with noisy haste. Two\n_garcons_ served them, wearing aprons of a very doubtful white\nand greasy vests.\n\nThrough the four windows, open on the courtyard and its acacias,\nstreamed the light, soft and warm, after the storm. The trees, bathed\nin the setting sun, imparted a cool, green tinge to the dingy room,\nand the shadows of the waving branches and quivering leaves danced\nover the cloth.\n\nThere were two fly-specked mirrors at either end of the room, which\nindefinitely lengthened the table spread with thick china. Every time\nthe _garcons_ opened the door into the kitchen there came a strong\nsmell of burning fat.\n\n\"Don't let us all talk at once!\" said Boche as a dead silence fell on\nthe room, broken by the abrupt entrance of Mes-Bottes.\n\n\"You are nice people!\" he exclaimed. \"I have been waiting for you\nuntil I am wet through and have a fishpond in each pocket.\"\n\nThis struck the circle as the height of wit, and they all laughed\nwhile he ordered the _garcon_ to and fro. He devoured three plates of\nsoup and enormous slices of bread. The head of the establishment came\nand looked in in considerable anxiety; a laugh ran around the room.\nMes-Bottes recalled to their memories a day when he had eaten twelve\nhard-boiled eggs and drunk twelve glasses of wine while the clock was\nstriking twelve.\n\nThere was a brief silence. A waiter placed on the table a rabbit stew\nin a deep dish. Coupeau turned round.\n\n\"Say, boy, is that a gutter rabbit? It mews still.\"\n\nAnd the low mewing of a cat seemed, indeed, to come from the dish.\nThis delicate joke was perpetrated by Coupeau in the throat, without\nthe smallest movement of his lips. This feat always met with such\nsuccess that he never ordered a meal anywhere without a rabbit stew.\nThe ladies wiped their eyes with their napkins because they laughed\nso much.\n\nMme Fauconnier begged for the head--she adored the head--and Boche\nasked especially for onions.\n\nMme Lerat compressed her lips and said morosely:\n\n\"Of course. I might have known that!\"\n\nMme Lerat was a hard-working woman. No man had ever put his nose\nwithin her door since her widowhood, and yet her instincts were\nthoroughly bad; every word uttered by others bore to her ears a double\nmeaning, a coarse allusion sometimes so deeply veiled that no one but\nherself could grasp its meaning.\n\nBoche leaned over her with a sensual smile and entreated an\nexplanation. She shook her head.\n\n\"Of course,\" she repeated. \"Onions! I knew it!\"\n\nEverybody was talking now, each of his own trade. Madinier declared\nthat boxmaking was an art, and he cited the New Year bonbon boxes as\nwonders of luxury. Lorilleux talked of his chains, of their delicacy\nand beauty. He said that in former times jewelers wore swords at their\nsides. Coupeau described a weathercock made by one of his comrades out\nof tin. Mme Lerat showed Bibi-la-Grillade how a rose stem was made by\nrolling the handle of her knife between her bony fingers, and Mme\nFauconnier complained loudly of one of her apprentices who the night\nbefore had badly scorched a pair of linen sheets.\n\n\"It is no use to talk!\" cried Lorilleux, striking his fist on the\ntable. \"Gold is gold!\"\n\nA profound silence followed the utterance of this truism, amid which\narose from the other end of the table the piping tones of Mlle\nRemanjon's voice as she said:\n\n\"And then I sew on the skirt. I stick a pin in the head to hold on\nthe cap, and it is done. They sell for three cents.\"\n\nShe was describing her dolls to Mes-Bottes, whose jaws worked\nsteadily, like machinery.\n\nHe did not listen, but he nodded at intervals, with his eyes fixed\non the _garcons_ to see that they carried away no dishes that were\nnot emptied.\n\nThere had been veal cutlets and string beans served. As a _roti,_\ntwo lean chickens on a bed of water cresses were brought in. The room\nwas growing very warm; the sun was lingering on the tops of the\nacacias, but the room was growing dark. The men threw off their coats\nand ate in their shirt sleeves.\n\n\"Mme Boche,\" cried Gervaise, \"please don't let those children eat\nso much.\"\n\nBut Mme Coupeau interposed and declared that for once in a while a\nlittle fit of indigestion would do them no harm.\n\nMme Boche accused her husband of holding Mme Lerat's hand under the\ntable.\n\nMadinier talked politics. He was a Republican, and Bibi-la-Grillade\nand himself were soon in a hot discussion.\n\n\"Who cares,\" cried Coupeau, \"whether we have a king, an emperor or\na president, so long as we earn our five francs per day!\"\n\nLorilleux shook his head. He was born on the same day as the Comte de\nChambord, September 29, 1820, and this coincidence dwelt in his mind.\nHe seemed to feel that there was a certain connection between the\nreturn of the king to France and his own personal fortunes. He did\nnot say distinctly what he expected, but it was clear that it was\nsomething very agreeable.\n\nThe dessert was now on the table--a floating island flanked by two\nplates of cheese and two of fruit. The floating island was a great\nsuccess. Mes-Bottes ate all the cheese and called for more bread. And\nthen as some of the custard was left in the dish, he pulled it toward\nhim and ate it as if it had been soup.\n\n\"How extraordinary!\" said Madinier, filled with admiration.\n\nThe men rose to light their pipes and, as they passed Mes-Bottes,\nasked him how he felt.\n\nBibi-la-Grillade lifted him from the floor, chair and all.\n\n\"Zounds!\" he cried. \"The fellow's weight has doubled!\"\n\nCoupeau declared his friend had only just begun his night's work,\nthat he would eat bread until dawn. The waiters, pale with fright,\ndisappeared. Boche went downstairs on a tour of inspection and\nstated that the establishment was in a state of confusion, that the\nproprietor, in consternation, had sent out to all the bakers in the\nneighborhood, that the house, in fact, had an utterly ruined aspect.\n\n\"I should not like to take you to board,\" said Mme Gaudron.\n\n\"Let us have a punch,\" cried Mes-Bottes.\n\nBut Coupeau, seeing his wife's troubled face, interfered and said no\none should drink anything more. They had all had enough.\n\nThis declaration met with the approval of some of the party, but the\nothers sided with Mes-Bottes.\n\n\"Those who are thirsty are thirsty,\" he said. \"No one need drink that\ndoes not wish to do so, I am sure.\" And he added with a wink, \"There\nwill be all the more for those who do!\"\n\nThen Coupeau said they would settle the account, and his friend could\ndo as he pleased afterward.\n\nAlas! Mes-Bottes could produce only three francs; he had changed his\nfive-franc piece, and the remainder had melted away somehow on the\nroad from St-Denis. He handed over the three francs, and Coupeau,\ngreatly indignant, borrowed the other two from his brother-in-law,\nwho gave the money secretly, being afraid of his wife.\n\nM. Madinier had taken a plate. The ladies each laid down their five\nfrancs quietly and timidly, and then the men retreated to the other\nend of the room and counted up the amount, and each man added to his\nsubscription five sous for the _garcon_.\n\nBut when M. Madinier sent for the proprietor the little assembly were\nshocked at hearing him say that this was not all; there were \"extras.\"\n\nAs this was received with exclamations of rage, he went into\nexplanations. He had furnished twenty-five liters of wine instead of\ntwenty, as he agreed. The floating island was an addition, on seeing\nthat the dessert was somewhat scanty, whereupon ensued a formidable\nquarrel. Coupeau declared he would not pay a sou of the extras.\n\n\"There is your money,\" he said; \"take it, and never again will one\nof us step a foot under your roof!\"\n\n\"I want six francs more,\" muttered the man.\n\nThe women gathered about in great indignation; not a centime would\nthey give, they declared.\n\nMme Fauconnier had had a wretched dinner; she said she could have had\na better one at home for forty sous. Such arrangements always turned\nout badly, and Mme Gaudron declared aloud that if people wanted their\nfriends at their weddings they usually invited them out and out.\n\nGervaise took refuge with her mother-in-law in a distant window,\nfeeling heartily ashamed of the whole scene.\n\nM. Madinier went downstairs with the man, and low mutterings of the\nstorm reached the party. At the end of a half-hour he reappeared,\nhaving yielded to the extent of paying three francs, but no one was\nsatisfied, and they all began a discussion in regard to the extras.\n\nThe evening was spoiled, as was Mme Lerat's dress; there was no end\nto the chapter of accidents.\n\n\"I know,\" cried Mme Lorilleux, \"that the _garcon_ spilled gravy\nfrom the chickens down my back.\" She twisted and turned herself\nbefore the mirror until she succeeded in finding the spot.\n\n\"Yes, I knew it,\" she cried, \"and he shall pay for it, as true as\nI live. I wish I had remained at home!\"\n\nShe left in a rage, and Lorilleux at her heels.\n\nWhen Coupeau saw her go he was in actual consternation, and Gervaise\nsaw that it was best to make a move at once. Mme Boche had agreed to\nkeep the children with her for a day or two.\n\nCoupeau and his wife hurried out in the hope of overtaking Mme\nLorilleux which they soon did. Lorilleux, with the kindly desire\nof making all smooth said:\n\n\"We will go to your door with you.\"\n\n\"Your door, indeed!\" cried his wife, and then pleasantly went on to\nexpress her surprise that they did not postpone their marriage until\nthey had saved enough to buy a little furniture and move away from\nthat hole up under the roof.\n\n\"But I have given up that room,\" said her brother. \"We shall have\nthe one Gervaise occupies; it is larger.\"\n\nMme Lorilleux forgot herself; she wheeled around suddenly.\n\n\"What!\" she exclaimed. \"You are going to live in Wooden Legs' room?\"\n\nGervaise turned pale. This name she now heard for the first time,\nand it was like a slap in the face. She heard much more in her\nsister-in-law's exclamation than met the ear. That room to which\nallusion was made was the one where she had lived with Lantier for a\nwhole month, where she had wept such bitter tears, but Coupeau did not\nunderstand that; he was only wounded by the name applied to his wife.\n\n\"It is hardly wise of you,\" he said sullenly, \"to nickname people\nafter that fashion, as perhaps you are not aware of what you are\ncalled in your _Quartier_. Cow's-Tail is not a very nice name,\nbut they have given it to you on account of your hair. Why should\nwe not keep that room? It is a very good one.\"\n\nMme Lorilleux would not answer. Her dignity was sadly disturbed at\nbeing called Cow's-Tail.\n\nThey walked on in silence until they reached the Hotel Boncoeur, and\njust as Coupeau gave the two women a push toward each other and bade\nthem kiss and be friends, a man who wished to pass them on the right\ngave a violent lurch to the left and came between them.\n\n\"Look out!\" cried Lorilleux. \"It is Father Bazonge. He is pretty full\ntonight.\"\n\nGervaise, in great terror, flew toward the door. Father Bazonge was\na man of fifty; his clothes were covered with mud where he had fallen\nin the street.\n\n\"You need not be afraid,\" continued Lorilleux; \"he will do you no\nharm. He is a neighbor of ours--the third room on the left in our\ncorridor.\"\n\nBut Father Bazonge was talking to Gervaise. \"I am not going to eat\nyou, little one,\" he said. \"I have drunk too much, I know very well,\nbut when the work is done the machinery should be greased a little\nnow and then.\"\n\nGervaise retreated farther into the doorway and with difficulty kept\nback a sob. She nervously entreated Coupeau to take the man away.\n\nBazonge staggered off, muttering as he did so:\n\n\"You won't mind it so much one of these days, my dear. I know\nsomething about women. They make a great fuss, but they get used\nto it all the same.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nA HAPPY HOME\n\nFour years of hard and incessant toil followed this day. Gervaise and\nCoupeau were wise and prudent. They worked hard and took a little\nrelaxation on Sundays. The wife worked twelve hours of the twenty-four\nwith Mme Fauconnier and yet found time to keep her own home like\nwaxwork. The husband was never known to be tipsy but brought home his\nwages and smoked his pipe at his own window at night before going to\nbed. They were the bright and shining lights, the good example of the\nwhole _Quartier_, and as they made jointly about nine francs per\nday, it was easy to see they were putting by money.\n\nBut in the first few months of their married life they were obliged to\ntrim their sails closely and had some trouble to make both ends meet.\nThey took a great dislike to the Hotel Boncoeur. They longed for a\nhome of their own with their own furniture. They estimated the cost\nover and over again and decided that for three hundred and fifty\nfrancs they could venture, but they had little hope of saving such a\nsum in less than two years, when a stroke of good luck befell them.\n\nAn old gentleman in Plassans sent for Claude to place him at school.\nHe was a very eccentric old gentleman, fond of pictures and art.\nClaude was a great expense to his mother, and when Etienne alone was\nat home they saved the three hundred and fifty francs in seven months.\nThe day they purchased their furniture they took a long and happy walk\ntogether, for it was an important step they had taken--important not\nonly in their own eyes but in those of the people around them.\n\nFor two months they had been looking for an apartment. They wished,\nof all things, to take one in the old house where Mme Lorilleux\nlived, but there was not one single room to be rented, and they were\ncompelled to relinquish the idea. Gervaise was reconciled to this more\neasily, since she did not care to be thrown in any closer contact with\nthe Lorilleuxs. They looked further. It was essential that Gervaise\nshould be near her friend and employer Mme Fauconnier, and they\nfinally succeeded in their search and were indeed in wonderful luck,\nfor they obtained a large room with a kitchen and tiny bedroom just\nopposite the establishment of the laundress. It was a small house,\ntwo stories, with one steep staircase, and was divided into two\nlodgings--the one on the right, the other on the left, while the\nlower floor was occupied by a carriage maker.\n\nGervaise was delighted. It seemed to her that she was once more in the\ncountry--no neighbors, no gossip, no interference--and from the place\nwhere she stood and ironed all day at Mme Fauconnier's she could see\nthe windows of her own room.\n\nThey moved in the month of April. Gervaise was then near her\nconfinement, but it was she who cleaned and put in order her new home.\nEvery penny as of consequence, she said with pride, now that they\nwould soon have another other mouth to feed. She rubbed her furniture,\nwhich was of old mahogany, good, but secondhand, until it shone like\nglass and was quite brokenhearted when she discovered a scratch. She\nheld her breath if she knocked it when sweeping. The commode was her\nespecial pride; it was so dignified and stately. Her pet dream, which,\nhowever, she kept to herself, was someday to have a clock to put\nin the center of the marble slab. If there had not been a baby in\nprospect she would have purchased this much-coveted article at once,\nbut she sighed and dismissed the thought.\n\nEtienne's bed was placed in the tiny room, almost a closet, and there\nwas room for the cradle by its side. The kitchen was about as big as\none's hand and very dark, but by leaving the door open one could see\npretty well, and as Gervaise had no big dinners to get she managed\ncomfortably. The large room was her pride. In the morning the white\ncurtains of the alcove were drawn, and the bedroom was transformed\ninto a lovely dining room, with its table in the middle, the commode\nand a wardrobe opposite each other. A tiny stove kept them warm in\ncold weather for seven sous per day.\n\nCoupeau ornamented the walls with several engravings--one of a marshal\nof France on a spirited steed, with his baton in his hand. Above the\ncommode were the photographs of the family, arranged in two lines,\nwith an antique china _benitier_ between. On the corners of the\ncommode a bust of Pascal faced another of Beranger--one grave, the\nother smiling. It was, indeed, a fair and pleasant home.\n\n\"How much do you think we pay here?\" Gervaise would ask of each new\nvisitor.\n\nAnd when too high an estimate was given she was charmed.\n\n\"One hundred and fifty francs--not a penny more,\" she would exclaim.\n\"Is it not wonderful?\"\n\nNo small portion of the woman's satisfaction arose from an acacia\nwhich grew in her courtyard, one of whose branches crossed her window,\nand the scanty foliage was a whole wilderness to her.\n\nHer baby was born one afternoon. She would not allow her husband to be\nsent for, and when he came gaily into the room he was welcomed by his\npale wife, who whispered to him as he stooped over her:\n\n\"My dear, it is a girl.\"\n\n\"All right!\" said the tinworker, jesting to hide his real emotion.\n\"I ordered a girl. You always do just what I want!\"\n\nHe took up the child.\n\n\"Let us have a good look at you, young lady! The down on the top of\nyour head is pretty black, I think. Now you must never squall but be\nas good and reasonable always as your papa and mamma.\"\n\nGervaise, with a faint smile and sad eyes, looked at her daughter. She\nshook her head. She would have preferred a boy, because boys run less\nrisks in a place like Paris. The nurse took the baby from the father's\nhands and told Gervaise she must not talk. Coupeau said he must go and\ntell his mother and sister the news, but he was famished and must eat\nsomething first. His wife was greatly disturbed at seeing him wait\nupon himself, and she tossed about a little and complained that she\ncould not make him comfortable.\n\n\"You must be quiet,\" said the nurse again.\n\n\"It is lucky you are here, or she would be up and cutting my bread\nfor me,\" said Coupeau.\n\nHe finally set forth to announce the news to his family and returned\nin an hour with them all.\n\nThe Lorilleuxs, under the influence of the prosperity of their brother\nand his wife, had become extremely amiable toward them and only lifted\ntheir eyebrows in a significant sort of way, as much as to say that\nthey could tell something if they pleased.\n\n\"You must not talk, you understand,\" said Coupeau, \"but they would\ncome and take a peep at you, and I am going to make them some coffee.\"\n\nHe disappeared into the kitchen, and the women discussed the size of\nthe baby and whom it resembled. Meanwhile Coupeau was heard banging\nround in the kitchen, and his wife nervously called out to him and\ntold him where the things were that he wanted, but her husband rose\nsuperior to all difficulties and soon appeared with the smoking\ncoffeepot, and they all seated themselves around the table, except the\nnurse, who drank a cup standing and then departed; all was going well,\nand she was not needed. If she was wanted in the morning they could\nsend for her.\n\nGervaise lay with a faint smile on her lips. She only half heard what\nwas said by those about her. She had no strength to speak; it seemed\nto her that she was dead. She heard the word baptism. Coupeau saw no\nnecessity for the ceremony and was quite sure, too, that the child\nwould take cold. In his opinion, the less one had to do with priests,\nthe better. His mother was horrified and called him a heathen, while\nthe Lorilleuxs claimed to be religious people also.\n\n\"It had better be on Sunday,\" said his sister in a decided tone, and\nGervaise consented with a little nod. Everybody kissed her and then\nthe baby, addressing it with tender epithets, as if it could\nunderstand, and departed.\n\nWhen Coupeau was alone with his wife he took her hand and held it\nwhile he finished his pipe.\n\n\"I could not help their coming,\" he said, \"but I am sure they have\ngiven you the headache.\" And the rough, clumsy man kissed his wife\ntenderly, moved by a great pity for all she had borne for his sake.\n\nAnd Gervaise was very happy. She told him so and said her only anxiety\nnow was to be on her feet again as soon as possible, for they had\nanother mouth to feed. He soothed her and asked if she could not trust\nhim to look out for their little one.\n\nIn the morning when he went to his work he sent Mme Boche to spend the\nday with his wife, who at night told him she never could consent to\nlie still any longer and see a stranger going about her room, and the\nnext day she was up and would not be taken care of again. She had no\ntime for such nonsense! She said it would do for rich women but not\nfor her, and in another week she was at Mme Fauconnier's again at\nwork.\n\nMme Lorilleux, who was the baby's godmother, appeared on Saturday\nevening with a cap and baptismal robe, which she had bought cheap\nbecause they had lost their first freshness. The next day Lorilleux,\nas godfather, gave Gervaise six pounds of sugar. They flattered\nthemselves they knew how to do things properly and that evening, at\nthe supper given by Coupeau, did not appear empty-handed. Lorilleux\ncame with a couple of bottles of wine under each arm, and his wife\nbrought a large custard which was a specialty of a certain restaurant.\n\nYes, they knew how to do things, these people, but they also liked\nto tell of what they did, and they told everyone they saw in the next\nmonth that they had spent twenty francs, which came to the ears of\nGervaise, who was none too well pleased.\n\nIt was at this supper that Gervaise became acquainted with her\nneighbors on the other side of the house. These were Mme Goujet, a\nwidow, and her son. Up to this time they had exchanged a good morning\nwhen they met on the stairs or in the street, but as Mme Goujet had\nrendered some small services on the first day of her illness, Gervaise\ninvited them on the occasion of the baptism.\n\nThese people were from the _Department du Nond_. The mother\nrepaired laces, while the son, a blacksmith by trade, worked in\na factory.\n\nThey had lived in their present apartment for five years. Beneath the\npeaceful calm of their lives lay a great sorrow. Goujet, the husband\nand father, had killed a man in a fit of furious intoxication\nand then, while in prison, had choked himself with his pocket\nhandkerchief. His widow and child left Lille after this and came to\nParis, with the weight of this tragedy on their hearts and heads, and\nfaced the future with indomitable courage and sweet patience. Perhaps\nthey were overproud and reserved, for they held themselves aloof\nfrom those about them. Mme Goujet always wore mourning, and her pale,\nserene face was encircled with nunlike bands of white. Goujet was a\ncolossus of twenty-three with a clear, fresh complexion and honest\neyes. At the manufactory he went by the name of the Gueule-d'Or on\naccount of his beautiful blond beard.\n\nGervaise took a great fancy to these people and when she first entered\ntheir apartment and was charmed with the exquisite cleanliness of all\nshe saw. Mme Goujet opened the door into her son's room to show it\nto her. It was as pretty and white as the chamber of a young girl.\nA narrow iron bed, white curtains and quilt, a dressing table and\nbookshelves made up the furniture. A few colored engravings were\npinned against the wall, and Mme Goujet said that her son was a good\ndeal of a boy still--he liked to look at pictures rather than read.\nGervaise sat for an hour with her neighbor, watching her at work with\nher cushion, its numberless pins and the pretty lace.\n\nThe more she saw of her new friends the better Gervaise liked them.\nThey were frugal but not parsimonious. They were the admiration of\nthe neighborhood. Goujet was never seen with a hole or a spot on his\ngarments. He was very polite to all but a little diffident, in spite\nof his height and broad shoulders. The girls in the street were much\namused to see him look away when they met him; he did not fancy their\nways--their forward boldness and loud laughs. One day he came home\ntipsy. His mother uttered no word of reproach but brought out a\npicture of his father which was piously preserved in her wardrobe. And\nafter that lesson Goujet drank no more liquor, though he conceived no\nhatred for wine.\n\nOn Sunday he went out with his mother, who was his idol. He went to\nher with all his troubles and with all his joys, as he had done when\nlittle.\n\nAt first he took no interest in Gervaise, but after a while he began\nto like her and treated her like a sister, with abrupt familiarity.\n\nCadet-Cassis, who was a thorough Parisian, thought Gueule-d'Or very\nstupid. What was the sense of turning away from all the pretty girls\nhe met in the street? But this did not prevent the two young fellows\nfrom liking each other very heartily.\n\nFor three years the lives of these people flowed tranquilly on\nwithout an event. Gervaise had been elevated in the laundry where\nshe worked, had higher wages and decided to place Etienne at school.\nNotwithstanding all her expenses of the household, they were able to\nsave twenty and thirty francs each month. When these savings amounted\nto six hundred francs Gervaise could not rest, so tormented was she by\nambitious dreams. She wished to open a small establishment herself and\nhire apprentices in her turn. She hesitated, naturally, to take the\ndefinite steps and said they would look around for a shop that would\nanswer their purpose; their money in the savings bank was quietly\nrolling up. She had bought her clock, the object of her ambition; it\nwas to be paid for in a year--so much each month. It was a wonderful\nclock, rosewood with fluted columns and gilt moldings and pendulum.\nShe kept her bankbook under the glass shade, and often when she was\nthinking of her shop she stood with her eyes fixed on the clock, as\nif she were waiting for some especial and solemn moment.\n\nThe Coupeaus and the Goujets now went out on Sundays together. It was\nan orderly party with a dinner at some quiet restaurant. The men drank\na glass or two of wine and came home with the ladies and counted up\nand settled the expenditures of the day before they separated.\nThe Lorilleuxs were bitterly jealous of these new friends of their\nbrother's. They declared it had a very queer look to see him and his\nwife always with strangers rather than with his own family, and Mme\nLorilleux began to say hateful things again of Gervaise. Mme Lerat,\non the contrary, took her part, while Mamma Coupeau tried to please\neveryone.\n\nThe day that Nana--which was the pet name given to the little\ngirl--was three years old Coupeau, on coming in, found his wife in\na state of great excitement. She refused to give any explanation,\nsaying, in fact, there really was nothing the matter, but she finally\nbecame so abstracted that she stood still with the plates in her hand\nas she laid the table for dinner, and her husband insisted on an\nexplanation.\n\n\"If you must know,\" she said, \"that little shop in La Rue de la\nGoutte-d'Or is vacant. I heard so only an hour ago, and it struck\nme all of a heap!\"\n\nIt was a very nice shop in the very house of which they had so often\nthought. There was the shop itself--a back room--and two others. They\nwere small, to be sure, but convenient and well arranged; only she\nthought it dear--five hundred francs.\n\n\"You asked the price then?\"\n\n\"Yes, I asked it just out of curiosity,\" she answered with an air of\nindifference, \"but it is too dear, decidedly too dear. It would be\nunwise, I think, to take it.\"\n\nBut she could talk of nothing else the whole evening. She drew the\nplan of the rooms on the margin of a newspaper, and as she talked she\nmeasured the furniture, as if they were to move the next day. Then\nCoupeau, seeing her great desire to have the place, declared he would\nsee the owner the next morning, for it was possible he would take less\nthan five hundred francs, but how would she like to live so near his\nsister, whom she detested?\n\nGervaise was displeased at this and said she detested no one and even\ndefended the Lorilleuxs, declaring they were not so bad, after all.\nAnd when Coupeau was asleep her busy brain was at work arranging the\nrooms which as yet they had not decided to hire.\n\nThe next day when she was alone she lifted the shade from the clock\nand opened her bankbook. Just to think that her shop and future\nprosperity lay between those dirty leaves!\n\nBefore going to her work she consulted Mme Goujet, who approved of the\nplan. With a husband like hers, who never drank, she could not fail\nof success. At noon she called on her sister-in-law to ask her advice,\nfor she did not wish to have the air of concealing anything from the\nfamily.\n\nMme Lorilleux was confounded. What, did Wooden Legs think of having\nan establishment of her own? And with an envious heart she stammered\nout that it would be very well, certainly, but when she had recovered\nherself a little she began to talk of the dampness of the courtyard\nand of the darkness of the _rez-de-chaussee_. Oh yes, it was a\ncapital place for rheumatism, but of course if her mind was made up\nanything she could say would make no difference.\n\nThat night Gervaise told her husband that if he had thrown any\nobstacles in the way of her taking the shop she believed she should\nhave fallen sick and died, so great was her longing. But before they\ncame to any decision they must see if a diminution of the rent could\nbe obtained.\n\n\"We can go tomorrow if you say so,\" was her husband's reply; \"you can\ncall for me at six o'clock.\"\n\nCoupeau was then completing the roof of a three-storied house and\nwas laying the very last sheets of zinc. It was May and a cloudless\nevening. The sun was low in the horizon, and against the blue sky the\nfigure of Coupeau was clearly defined as he cut his zinc as quietly\nas a tailor might have cut out a pair of breeches in his workshop. His\nassistant, a lad of seventeen, was blowing up the furnace with a pair\nof bellows, and at each puff a great cloud of sparks arose.\n\n\"Put in the irons, Zidore!\" shouted Coupeau.\n\nThe boy thrust the irons among the coals which showed only a dull pink\nin the sunlight and then went to work again with his bellows. Coupeau\ntook up his last sheet of zinc. It was to be placed on the edge of the\nroof, near the gutter. Just at that spot the roof was very steep. The\nman walked along in his list slippers much as if he had been at home,\nwhistling a popular melody. He allowed himself to slip a little and\ncaught at the chimney, calling to Zidore as he did so:\n\n\"Why in thunder don't you bring the irons? What are you staring at?\"\n\nBut Zidore, quite undisturbed, continued to stare at a cloud of heavy\nblack smoke that was rising in the direction of Grenelle. He wondered\nif it were a fire, but he crawled with the irons toward Coupeau, who\nbegan to solder the zinc, supporting himself on the point of one foot\nor by one finger, not rashly, but with calm deliberation and perfect\ncoolness. He knew what he could do and never lost his head. His pipe\nwas in his mouth, and he would occasionally turn to spit down into\nthe street below.\n\n\"Hallo, Madame Boche!\" he cried as he suddenly caught sight of his\nold friend crossing the street. \"How are you today?\"\n\nShe looked up, laughed, and a brisk conversation ensued between the\nroof and the street. She stood with her hands under her apron and her\nface turned up, while he, with one arm round a flue, leaned over the\nside of the house.\n\n\"Have you seen my wife?\" he asked.\n\n\"No indeed; is she anywhere round?\"\n\n\"She is coming for me. Is everyone well with you?\"\n\n\"Yes, all well, thanks. I am going to a butcher near here who sells\ncheaper than up our way.\"\n\nThey raised their voices because a carriage was passing, and this\nbrought to a neighboring window a little old woman, who stood in\nbreathless horror, expecting to see the man fall from the roof in\nanother minute.\n\n\"Well, good night,\" cried Mme Boche. \"I must not detain you from your\nwork.\"\n\nCoupeau turned and took the iron Zidore held out to him. At the same\nmoment Mme Boche saw Gervaise coming toward her with little Nana\ntrotting at her side. She looked up to the roof to tell Coupeau, but\nGervaise closed her lips with an energetic signal, and then as she\nreached the old concierge she said in a low voice that she was always\nin deadly terror that her husband would fall. She never dared look at\nhim when he was in such places.\n\n\"It is not very agreeable, I admit,\" answered Mme Boche. \"My man is\na tailor, and I am spared all this.\"\n\n\"At first,\" continued Gervaise, \"I had not a moment's peace. I saw\nhim in my dreams on a litter, but now I have got accustomed to it\nsomewhat.\"\n\nShe looked up, keeping Nana behind her skirts, lest the child should\ncall out and startle her father, who was at that moment on the extreme\nedge. She saw the soldering iron and the tiny flame that rose as he\ncarefully passed it along the edges of the zinc. Gervaise, pale with\nsuspense and fear, raised her hands mechanically with a gesture of\nsupplication. Coupeau ascended the steep roof with a slow step, then\nglancing down, he beheld his wife.\n\n\"You are watching me, are you?\" he cried gaily. \"Ah, Madame Boche, is\nshe not a silly one? She was afraid to speak to me. Wait ten minutes,\nwill you?\"\n\nThe two women stood on the sidewalk, having as much as they could do\nto restrain Nana, who insisted on fishing in the gutter.\n\nThe old woman still stood at the window, looking up at the roof and\nwaiting.\n\n\"Just see her,\" said Mme Boche. \"What is she looking at?\"\n\nCoupeau was heard lustily singing; with the aid of a pair of compasses\nhe had drawn some lines and now proceeded to cut a large fan; this he\nadroitly, with his tools, folded into the shape of a pointed mushroom.\nZidore was again heating the irons. The sun was setting just behind\nthe house, and the whole western sky was flushed with rose, fading\nto a soft violet, and against this sky the figures of the two men,\nimmeasurably exaggerated, stood clearly out, as well as the strange\nform of the zinc which Coupeau was then manipulating.\n\n\"Zidore! The irons!\"\n\nBut Zidore was not to be seen. His master, with an oath, shouted down\nthe scuttle window which was open near by and finally discovered him\ntwo houses off. The boy was taking a walk, apparently, with his scanty\nblond hair blowing all about his head.\n\n\"Do you think you are in the country?\" cried Coupeau in a fury. \"You\nare another Beranger, perhaps--composing verses! Will you have the\nkindness to give me my irons? Whoever heard the like? Give me my\nirons, I say!\"\n\nThe irons hissed as he applied them, and he called to Gervaise:\n\n\"I am coming!\"\n\nThe chimney to which he had fitted this cap was in the center of the\nroof. Gervaise stood watching him, soothed by his calm self-possession.\nNana clapped her little hands.\n\n\"Papa! Papa!\" she cried. \"Look!\"\n\nThe father turned; his foot slipped; he rolled down the roof slowly,\nunable to catch at anything.\n\n\"Good God!\" he said in a choked voice, and he fell; his body turned\nover twice and crashed into the middle of the street with the dull\nthud of a bundle of wet linen.\n\nGervaise stood still. A shriek was frozen on her lips. Mme Boche\nsnatched Nana in her arms and hid her head that she might not see,\nand the little old woman opposite, who seemed to have waited for this\nscene in the drama, quietly closed her windows.\n\nFour men bore Coupeau to a druggist's at the corner, where he lay for\nan hour while a litter was sent for from the Hospital Lariboisiere.\nHe was breathing still, but that was all. Gervaise knelt at his side,\nhysterically sobbing. Every minute or two, in spite of the prohibition\nof the druggist, she touched him to see if he were still warm. When\nthe litter arrived and they spoke of the hospital, she started up,\nsaying violently:\n\n\"No--no! Not to the hospital--to our own home.\"\n\nIn vain did they tell her that the expenses would be very great if\nshe nursed him at home.\n\n\"No--no!\" she said. \"I will show them the way. He is my husband,\nis he not? And I will take care of him myself.\"\n\nAnd Coupeau was carried home, and as the litter was borne through the\n_Quartier_ the women crowded together and extolled Gervaise. She\nwas a little lame, to be sure, but she was very energetic, and she\nwould save her man.\n\nMme Boche took Nana home and then went about among her friends to tell\nthe story with interminable details.\n\n\"I saw him fall,\" she said. \"It was all because of the child; he was\ngoing to speak to her, when down he went. Good lord! I trust I may\nnever see such another sight.\"\n\nFor a week Coupeau's life hung on a thread. His family and his friends\nexpected to see him die from one hour to another. The physician, an\nexperienced physician whose every visit cost five francs, talked of\na lesion, and that word was in itself very terrifying to all but\nGervaise, who, pale from her vigils but calm and resolute, shrugged\nher shoulders and would not allow herself to be discouraged. Her man's\nleg was broken; that she knew very well, \"but he need not die for\nthat!\" And she watched at his side night and day, forgetting her\nchildren and her home and everything but him.\n\nOn the ninth day, when the physician told her he would recover,\nshe dropped, half fainting, on a chair, and at night she slept for\na couple of hours with her head on the foot of his bed.\n\nThis accident to Coupeau brought all his family about him. His mother\nspent the nights there, but she slept in her chair quite comfortably.\nMme Lerat came in every evening after work was over to make inquiries.\n\nThe Lorilleuxs at first came three or four times each day and brought\nan armchair for Gervaise, but soon quarrels and discussions arose as\nto the proper way of nursing the invalid, and Mme Lorilleux lost her\ntemper and declared that had Gervaise stayed at home and not gone to\npester her husband when he was at work the accident would not have\nhappened.\n\nWhen she saw Coupeau out of danger Gervaise allowed his family to\napproach him as they saw fit. His convalescence would be a matter of\nmonths. This again was a ground of indignation for Mme Lorilleux.\n\n\"What nonsense it was,\" she said, \"for Gervaise to take him home! Had\nhe gone to the hospital he would have recovered as quickly again.\"\n\nAnd then she made a calculation of what these four months would cost:\nFirst, there was the time lost, then the physician, the medicines,\nthe wines and finally the meat for beef tea. Yes, it would be a pretty\nsum, to be sure! If they got through it on their savings they would\ndo well, but she believed that the end would be that they would find\nthemselves head over heels in debt, and they need expect no assistance\nfrom his family, for none of them was rich enough to pay for sickness\nat home!\n\nOne evening Mme Lorilleux was malicious enough to say:\n\n\"And your shop, when do you take it? The concierge is waiting to know\nwhat you mean to do.\"\n\nGervaise gasped. She had utterly forgotten the shop. She saw the\ndelight of these people when they believed that this plan was given\nup, and from that day they never lost an occasion of twitting her on\nher dream that had toppled over like a house of cards, and she grew\nmorbid and fancied they were pleased at the accident to their brother\nwhich had prevented the realization of their plans.\n\nShe tried to laugh and to show them she did not grudge the money that\nhad been expended in the restoration of her husband's health. She did\nnot withdraw all her savings from the bank at once, for she had a\nvague hope that some miracle would intervene which would render the\nsacrifice unnecessary.\n\nWas it not a great comfort, she said to herself and to her enemies,\nfor as such she had begun to regard the Lorilleuxs, that she had this\nmoney now to turn to in this emergency?\n\nHer neighbors next door had been very kind and thoughtful to Gervaise\nall through her trouble and the illness of her husband.\n\nMme Goujet never went out without coming to inquire if there was\nanything she could do, any commission she could execute. She brought\ninnumerable bowls of soup and, even when Gervaise was particularly\nbusy, washed her dishes for her. Goujet filled her buckets every\nmorning with fresh water, and this was an economy of at least two\nsous, and in the evening came to sit with Coupeau. He did not say\nmuch, but his companionship cheered and comforted the invalid. He\nwas tender and compassionate and was thrilled by the sweetness of\nGervaise's voice when she spoke to her husband. Never had he seen such\na brave, good woman; he did not believe she sat in her chair fifteen\nminutes in the whole day. She was never tired, never out of temper,\nand the young man grew very fond of the poor woman as he watched her.\n\nHis mother had found a wife for him. A girl whose trade was the same\nas her own, a lace mender, and as he did not wish to go contrary to\nher desires he consented that the marriage should take place in\nSeptember.\n\nBut when Gervaise spoke of his future he shook his head.\n\n\"All women are not like you, Madame Coupeau,\" he said. \"If they were\nI should like ten wives.\"\n\nAt the end of two months Coupeau was on his feet again and could\nmove--with difficulty, of course--as far as the window, where he sat\nwith his leg on a chair. The poor fellow was sadly shaken by his\naccident. He was no philosopher, and he swore from morning until\nnight. He said he knew every crack in the ceiling. When he was\ninstalled in his armchair it was little better. How long, he asked\nimpatiently, was he expected to sit there swathed like a mummy? And\nhe cursed his ill luck. His accident was a cursed shame. If his head\nhad been disturbed by drink it would have been different, but he was\nalways sober, and this was the result. He saw no sense in the whole\nthing!\n\n\"My father,\" he said, \"broke his neck. I don't say he deserved it,\nbut I do say there was a reason for it. But I had not drunk a drop,\nand yet over I went, just because I spoke to my child! If there be\na Father in heaven, as they say, who watches over us all, I must say\nHe manages things strangely enough sometimes!\"\n\nAnd as his strength returned his trade grew strangely distasteful to\nhim. It was a miserable business, he said, roaming along gutters like\na cat. In his opinion there should be a law which should compel every\nhouseowner to tin his own roof. He wished he knew some other trade he\ncould follow, something that was less dangerous.\n\nFor two months more Coupeau walked with a crutch and after a while\nwas able to get into the street and then to the outer boulevard, where\nhe sat on a bench in the sun. His gaiety returned; he laughed again\nand enjoyed doing nothing. For the first time in his life he felt\nthoroughly lazy, and indolence seemed to have taken possession of his\nwhole being. When he got rid of his crutches he sauntered about and\nwatched the buildings which were in the process of construction in the\nvicinity, and he jested with the men and indulged himself in a general\nabuse of work. Of course he intended to begin again as soon as he\nwas quite well, but at present the mere thought made him feel ill,\nhe said.\n\nIn the afternoons Coupeau often went to his sister's apartment;\nshe expressed a great deal of compassion for him and showed every\nattention. When he was first married he had escaped from her\ninfluence, thanks to his affection for his wife and hers for him.\nNow he fell under her thumb again; they brought him back by declaring\nthat he lived in mortal terror of his wife. But the Lorilleuxs were\ntoo wise to disparage her openly; on the contrary, they praised her\nextravagantly, and he told his wife that they adored her and begged\nher, in her turn, to be just to them.\n\nThe first quarrel in their home arose on the subject of Etienne.\nCoupeau had been with his sister. He came in late and found the\nchildren fretting for their dinner. He cuffed Etienne's ears, bade him\nhold his tongue and scolded for an hour. He was sure he did not know\nwhy he let that boy stay in the house; he was none of his; until that\nday he had accepted the child as a matter of course.\n\nThree days after this he gave the boy a kick, and it was not long\nbefore the child, when he heard him coming, ran into the Goujets',\nwhere there was always a corner at the table for him.\n\nGervaise had long since resumed her work. She no longer lifted the\nglobe of her clock to take out her bankbook; her savings were all\ngone, and it was necessary to count the sous pretty closely, for there\nwere four mouths to feed, and they were all dependent on the work of\nher two hands. When anyone found fault with Coupeau and blamed him\nshe always took his part.\n\n\"Think how much he has suffered,\" she said with tears in her eyes.\n\"Think of the shock to his nerves! Who can wonder that he is a little\nsour? Wait awhile, though, until he is perfectly well, and you will\nsee that his temper will be as sweet as it ever was.\"\n\nAnd if anyone ventured to observe that he seemed quite well and that\nhe ought to go to work she would exclaim:\n\n\"No indeed, not yet. It would never do.\" She did not want him down in\nhis bed again. She knew what the doctor had said, and she every day\nbegged him to take his own time. She even slipped a little silver,\ninto his vest pocket. All this Coupeau accepted as a matter of course.\nHe complained of all sorts of pains and aches to gain a little longer\nperiod of indolence and at the end of six months had begun to look\nupon himself as a confirmed invalid.\n\nHe almost daily dropped into a wineshop with a friend; it was a place\nwhere he could chat a little, and where was the harm? Besides, whoever\nheard of a glass of wine killing a man? But he swore to himself that\nhe would never touch anything but wine--not a drop of brandy should\npass his lips. Wine was good for one--prolonged one's life, aided\ndigestion--but brandy was a very different matter. Notwithstanding all\nthese wise resolutions, it came to pass more than once that he came\nin, after visiting a dozen different cabarets, decidedly tipsy. On\nthese occasions Gervaise locked her doors and declared she was ill,\nto prevent the Goujets from seeing her husband.\n\nThe poor woman was growing very sad. Every night and morning she\npassed the shop for which she had so ardently longed. She made her\ncalculations over and over again until her brain was dizzy. Two\nhundred and fifty francs for rent, one hundred and fifty for moving\nand the apparatus she needed, one hundred francs to keep things going\nuntil business began to come in. No, it could not be done under five\nhundred francs.\n\nShe said nothing of this to anyone, deterred only by the fear of\nseeming to regret the money she had spent for her husband during his\nillness. She was pale and dispirited at the thought that she must work\nfive years at least before she could save that much money.\n\nOne evening Gervaise was alone. Goujet entered, took a chair in\nsilence and looked at her as he smoked his pipe. He seemed to be\nrevolving something in his mind. Suddenly he took his pipe from his\nmouth.\n\n\"Madame Gervaise,\" he said, \"will you allow me to lend you the money\nyou require?\"\n\nShe was kneeling at a drawer, laying some towels in a neat pile. She\nstarted up, red with surprise. He had seen her standing that very\nmorning for a good ten minutes, looking at the shop, so absorbed that\nshe had not seen him pass.\n\nShe refused his offer, however. No, she could never borrow money when\nshe did not know how she could return it, and when he insisted she\nreplied:\n\n\"But your marriage? This is the money you have saved for that.\"\n\n\"Don't worry on that account,\" he said with a heightened color. \"I\nshall not marry. It was an idea of my mother's, and I prefer to lend\nyou the money.\"\n\nThey looked away from each other. Their friendship had a certain\nelement of tenderness which each silently recognized.\n\nGervaise accepted finally and went with Goujet to see his mother, whom\nhe had informed of his intentions. They found her somewhat sad, with\nher serene, pale face bent over her work. She did not wish to thwart\nher son, but she no longer approved of the plan, and she told Gervaise\nwhy. With kind frankness she pointed out to her that Coupeau had\nfallen into evil habits and was living on her labors and would in\nall probability continue to do so. The truth was that Mme Goujet\nhad not forgiven Coupeau for refusing to read during all his long\nconvalescence; this and many other things had alienated her and her\nson from him, but they had in no degree lost their interest in\nGervaise.\n\nFinally it was agreed she should have five hundred francs and should\nreturn the money by paying each month twenty francs on account.\n\n\"Well, well!\" cried Coupeau as he heard of this financial transaction.\n\"We are in luck. There is no danger with us, to be sure, but if he\nwere dealing with knaves he might never see hide or hair of his cash\nagain!\"\n\nThe next day the shop was taken, and Gervaise ran about with such\na light heart that there was a rumor that she had been cured of her\nlameness by an operation.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nAMBITIOUS DREAMS\n\nThe Boche couple, on the first of April, moved also and took the loge\nof the great house in the Rue de la Goutte-d'Or. Things had turned out\nvery nicely for Gervaise who, having always got on very comfortably\nwith the concierge in the house in Rue Neuve, dreaded lest she should\nfall into the power of some tyrant who would quarrel over every drop\nof water that was spilled and a thousand other trifles like that. But\nwith Mme Boche all would go smoothly.\n\nThe day the lease was to be signed and Gervaise stood in her new home\nher heart swelled with joy. She was finally to live in that house like\na small town, with its intersecting corridors instead of streets.\n\nShe felt a strange timidity--a dread of failure--when she found\nherself face to face with her enterprise. The struggle for bread was a\nterrible and an increasing one, and it seemed to her for a moment that\nshe had been guilty of a wild, foolhardy act, like throwing herself\ninto the jaws of a machine, for the planes in the cabinetmaker's shop\nand the hammers in the locksmith's were dimly grasped by her as a part\nof a great whole.\n\nThe water that ran past the door that day from the dyer's was pale\ngreen. She smiled as she stepped over it, accepting this color as a\nhappy augury. She, with her husband, entered the loge, where Mme Boche\nand the owner of the building, M. Marescot, were talking on business.\n\nGervaise, with a thrill of pain, heard Boche advise the landlord to\nturn out the dressmaker on the third floor who was behindhand with her\nrent. She wondered if she would ever be turned out and then wondered\nagain at the attitude assumed by these Boche people, who did not seem\nto have ever seen her before. They had eyes and ears only for the\nlandlord, who shook hands with his new tenants but, when they spoke\nof repairs, professed to be in such haste that morning that it would\nbe necessary to postpone the discussion. They reminded him of certain\nverbal promises he had made, and finally he consented to examine the\npremises.\n\nThe shop stood with its four bare walls and blackened ceiling. The\ntenant who had been there had taken away his own counters and cases.\nA furious discussion took place. M. Marescot said it was for them\nto embellish the shop.\n\n\"That may be,\" said Gervaise gently, \"but surely you cannot call\nputting on a fresh paper, instead of this that hangs in strips, an\nembellishment. Whitening the curbing, too, comes under, the head of\nnecessary repairs.\" She only required these two things.\n\nFinally Marescot, with a desperate air, plunged his hands deep in his\npockets, shrugged his shoulders and gave his consent to the repairs on\nthe ceiling and to the paper, on condition that she would pay for half\nthe paper, and then he hurried away.\n\nWhen he had departed Boche clapped Coupeau on the shoulder. \"You may\nthank me for that!\" he cried and then went on to say that he was the\nreal master of the house, that he settled the whole business of the\nestablishment, and it was a nod and look from him that had influenced\nM. Marescot. That evening Gervaise, considering themselves in debt to\nBoche, sent him some wine.\n\nIn four days the shop should have been ready for them, but the repairs\nhung on for three weeks. At first they intended simply to have the\npaint scrubbed, but it was so shabby and worn that Gervaise repainted\nat her own expense. Coupeau went every morning, not to work, but to\ninspect operations, and Boche dropped the vest or pantaloons on which\nhe was working and gave the benefit of his advice, and the two men\nspent the whole day smoking and spitting and arguing over each stroke\nof the brush. Some days the painters did not appear at all; on others\nthey came and walked off in an hour's time, not to return again.\n\nPoor Gervaise wrung her hands in despair. But finally, after two days\nof energetic labor, the whole thing was done, and the men walked off\nwith their ladders, singing lustily.\n\nThen came the moving, and finally Gervaise called herself settled in\nher new home and was pleased as a child. As she came up the street\nshe could see her sign afar off:\n\n  CLEARSTARCHER\n\n  LACES AND EMBROIDERIES\n  DONE UP WITH ESPECIAL CARE\n\nThe first word was painted in large yellow letters on a pale blue\nground.\n\nIn the recessed window shut in at the back by muslin curtains lay\nmen's shirts, delicate handkerchiefs and cuffs; all these were on\nblue paper, and Gervaise was charmed. When she entered the door all\nwas blue there; the paper represented a golden trellis and blue\nmorning-glories. In the center was a huge table draped with\nblue-bordered cretonne to hide the trestles.\n\nGervaise seated herself and looked round, happy in the cleanliness of\nall about her. Her first glance, however, was directed to her stove,\na sort of furnace whereon ten irons could be heated at once. It was a\nsource of constant anxiety lest her little apprentice should fill it\ntoo full of coal and so injure it.\n\nBehind the shop was her bedroom and her kitchen, from which a door\nopened into the court. Nana's bed stood in a little room at the right,\nand Etienne was compelled to share his with the baskets of soiled\nclothes. It was all very well, except that the place was very damp\nand that it was dark by three o'clock in the afternoon in winter.\n\nThe new shop created a great excitement in the neighborhood. Some\npeople declared that the Coupeaus were on the road to ruin; they\nhad, in fact, spent the whole five hundred francs and were penniless,\ncontrary to their intentions. The morning that Gervaise first took\ndown her shutters she had only six francs in the world, but she was\nnot troubled, and at the end of a week she told her husband after two\nhours of abstruse calculations that they had taken in enough to cover\ntheir expenses.\n\nThe Lorilleuxs were in a state of rage, and one morning when the\napprentice was emptying, on the sly, a bowl of starch which she had\nburned in making, just as Mme Lorilleux was passing, she rushed in and\naccused her sister-in-law of insulting her. After this all friendly\nrelations were at an end.\n\n\"It all looks very strange to me,\" sniffed Mme Lorilleux. \"I can't\ntell where the money comes from, but I have my suspicions.\" And she\nwent on to intimate that Gervaise and Goujet were altogether too\nintimate. This was the groundwork of many fables; she said Wooden Legs\nwas so mild and sweet that she had deceived her to the extent that\nshe had consented to become Nana's godmother, which had been no small\nexpense, but now things were very different. If Gervaise were dying\nand asked her for a glass of water she would not give it. She could\nnot stand such people. As to Nana, it was different; they would\nalways receive her. The child, of course, was not responsible for her\nmother's crimes. Coupeau should take a more decided stand and not put\nup with his wife's vile conduct.\n\nBoche and his wife sat in judgment on the quarrel and gave as their\nopinion that the Lorilleuxs were much to blame. They were good\ntenants, of course. They paid regularly. \"But,\" added Mme Boche, \"I\nnever could abide jealousy. They are mean people and were never known\nto offer a glass of wine to a friend.\"\n\nMother Coupeau visited her son and daughter successive days, listened\nto the tales of each and said never a word in reply.\n\nGervaise lived a busy life and took no notice of all this foolish\ngossip and strife. She greeted her friends with a smile from the door\nof her shop, where she went for a breath of fresh air. All the people\nin the neighborhood liked her and would have called her a great beauty\nbut for her lameness. She was twenty-eight and had grown plump. She\nmoved more slowly, and when she took a chair to wait for her irons\nto heat she rose with reluctance. She was growing fond of good\nliving--that she herself admitted--but she did not regard it as a\nfault. She worked hard and had a right to good food. Why should she\nlive on potato parings? Sometimes she worked all night when she had\na great deal of work on hand.\n\nShe did the washing for the whole house and for some Parisian ladies\nand had several apprentices, besides two laundresses. She was making\nmoney hand over fist, and her good luck would have turned a wiser head\nthan her own. But hers was not turned; she was gentle and sweet and\nhated no one except her sister-in-law. She judged everybody kindly,\nparticularly after she had eaten a good breakfast. When people called\nher good she laughed. Why should she not be good? She had seen all her\ndreams realized. She remembered what she once said--that she wanted to\nwork hard, have plenty to eat, a home to herself, where she could\nbring up her children, not be beaten and die in her bed! As to dying\nin her bed, she added she wanted that still, but she would put it off\nas long as possible, \"if you please!\" It was to Coupeau himself that\nGervaise was especially sweet. Never a cross or an impatient word had\nhe heard from her lips, and no one had ever known her complain of him\nbehind his back. He had finally resumed his trade, and as the shop\nwhere he worked was at the other end of Paris, she gave him every\nmorning forty sous for his breakfast, his wine and tobacco. Two days\nout of six, however, Coupeau would meet a friend, drink up his forty\nsous and return to breakfast. Once, indeed, he sent a note, saying\nthat his account at the cabaret exceeded his forty sous. He was in\npledge, as it were; would his wife send the money? She laughed and\nshrugged her shoulders. Where was the harm in her husband's amusing\nhimself a little? A woman must give a man a long rope if she wished\nto live in peace and comfort. It was not far from words to blows--she\nknew that very well.\n\nThe hot weather had come. One afternoon in June the ten irons were\nheating on the stove; the door was open into the street, but not a\nbreath of air came in.\n\n\"What a melting day!\" said Gervaise, who was stooping over a great\nbowl of starch. She had rolled up her sleeves and taken off her sack\nand stood in her chemise and white skirt; the soft hair in her neck\nwas curling on her white throat. She dipped each cuff in the starch,\nthe fronts of the shirts and the whole of the skirts. Then she rolled\nup the pieces tightly and placed them neatly in a square basket after\nhaving sprinkled with clear water all those portions which were not\nstarched.\n\n\"This basket is for you, Madame Putois,\" she said, \"and you will have\nto hurry, for they dry so fast in this weather.\"\n\nMine Putois was a thin little woman who looked cool and comfortable\nin her tightly buttoned dress. She had not taken her cap off but stood\nat the table, moving her irons to and fro with the regularity of an\nautomaton. Suddenly she exclaimed:\n\n\"Put on your sack, Clemence; there are three men looking in, and I\ndon't like such things.\"\n\nClemence grumbled and growled. What did she care what she liked? She\ncould not and would not roast to suit anybody.\n\n\"Clemence, put on your sack,\" said Gervaise. \"Madame Putois is\nright--it is not proper.\"\n\nClemence muttered but obeyed and consoled herself by giving the\napprentice, who was ironing hose and towels by her side, a little\npush. Gervaise had a cap belonging to Mme Boche in her hand and was\nironing the crown with a round ball, when a tall, bony woman came in.\nShe was a laundress.\n\n\"You have come too soon, Madame Bijard!\" cried Gervaise. \"I said\ntonight. It is very inconvenient for me to attend to you at this\nhour.\" At the same time, however, Gervaise amiably laid down her work\nand went for the dirty clothes, which she piled up in the back shop.\nIt took the two women nearly an hour to sort them and mark them with\na stitch of colored cotton.\n\nAt this moment Coupeau entered.\n\n\"By Jove!\" he said. \"The sun beats down on one's head like a hammer.\"\nHe caught at the table to sustain himself; he had been drinking; a\nspider web had caught in his dark hair, where many a white thread\nwas apparent. His under jaw dropped a little, and his smile was good\nnatured but silly.\n\nGervaise asked her husband if he had seen the Lorilleuxs in rather\na severe tone; when he said no she smiled at him without a word of\nreproach.\n\n\"You had best go and lie down,\" she said pleasantly. \"We are very\nbusy, and you are in our way. Did I say thirty-two handkerchiefs,\nMadame Bijard? Here are two more; that makes thirty-four.\"\n\nBut Coupeau was not sleepy, and he preferred to remain where he was.\nGervaise called Clemence and bade her to count the linen while she\nmade out the list. She glanced at each piece as she wrote. She knew\nmany of them by the color. That pillow slip belonged to Mme Boche\nbecause it was stained with the pomade she always used, and so on\nthrough the whole. Gervaise was seated with these piles of soiled\nlinen about her. Augustine, whose great delight was to fill up the\nstove, had done so now, and it was red hot. Coupeau leaned toward\nGervaise.\n\n\"Kiss me,\" he said. \"You are a good woman.\"\n\nAs he spoke he gave a sudden lurch and fell among the skirts.\n\n\"Do take care,\" said Gervaise impatiently. \"You will get them all\nmixed again.\" And she gave him a little push with her foot, whereat\nall the other women cried out.\n\n\"He is not like most men,\" said Mme Putois; \"they generally wish to\nbeat you when they come in like this.\"\n\nGervaise already regretted her momentary vexation and assisted her\nhusband to his feet and then turned her cheek to him with a smile,\nbut he put his arm round her and kissed her neck. She pushed him\naside with a laugh.\n\n\"You ought to be ashamed!\" she said but yielded to his embrace, and\nthe long kiss they exchanged before these people, amid the sickening\nodor of the soiled linen and the alcoholic fumes of his breath, was\nthe first downward step in the slow descent of their degradation.\n\nMme Bijard tied up the linen and staggered off under their weight\nwhile Gervaise turned back to finish her cap. Alas! The stove and the\nirons were alike red hot; she must wait a quarter of an hour before\nshe could touch the irons, and Gervaise covered the fire with a couple\nof shovelfuls of cinders. She then hung a sheet before the window to\nkeep out the sun. Coupeau took a place in the corner, refusing to\nbudge an inch, and his wife and all her assistants went to work on\neach side of the square table. Each woman had at her right a flat\nbrick on which to set her iron. In the center of the table a dish of\nwater with a rag and a brush in it and also a bunch of tall lilies\nin a broken jar.\n\nMme Putois had attacked the basket of linen prepared by Gervaise, and\nAugustine was ironing her towels, with her nose in the air, deeply\ninterested in a fly that was buzzing about. As to Clemence, she was\npolishing off her thirty-fifth shirt; as she boasted of this great\nfeat Coupeau staggered toward her.\n\n\"Madame,\" she called, \"please keep him away; he will bother me, and\nI shall scorch my shirt.\"\n\n\"Let her be,\" said Gervaise without any especial energy. \"We are in\na great hurry today!\"\n\nWell, that was not his fault; he did not mean to touch the girl;\nhe only wanted to see what she was about.\n\n\"Really,\" said his wife, looking up from her fluting iron, \"I think\nyou had best go to bed.\"\n\nHe began to talk again.\n\n\"You need not make such a fuss, Clemence; it is only because these\nwomen are here, and--\"\n\nBut he could say no more; Gervaise quietly laid one hand on his mouth\nand the other on his shoulder and pushed him toward his room. He\nstruggled a little and with a silly laugh asked if Clemence was not\ncoming too.\n\nGervaise undressed her husband and tucked him up in bed as if he had\nbeen a child and then returned to her fluting irons in time to still\na grand dispute that was going on about an iron that had not been\nproperly cleaned.\n\nIn the profound silence that followed her appearance she could hear\nher husband's thick voice:\n\n\"What a silly wife I've got! The idea of putting me to bed in broad\ndaylight!\"\n\nSuddenly he began to snore, and Gervaise uttered a sigh of relief.\nShe used her fluting iron for a minute and then said quietly:\n\n\"There is no need of being offended by anything a man does when he\nis in this state. He is not an accountable being. He did not intend\nto insult you. Clemence, you know what a tipsy man is--he respects\nneither father nor mother.\"\n\nShe uttered these words in an indifferent, matter-of-fact way, not in\nthe least disturbed that he had forgotten the respect due to her and\nto her roof and really seeing no harm in his conduct.\n\nThe work now went steadily on, and Gervaise calculated they would\nbe finished by eleven o'clock. The heat was intense; the smell of\ncharcoal deadened the air, while the branch of white lilies slowly\nfaded and filled the room with their sweetness.\n\nThe day after all this Coupeau had a frightful headache and did not\nrise until late, too late to go to his work. About noon he began to\nfeel better, and toward evening was quite himself. His wife gave him\nsome silver and told him to go out and take the air, which meant with\nhim taking some wine.\n\nOne glass washed down another, but he came home as gay as a lark and\nquite disgusted with the men he had seen who were drinking themselves\nto death.\n\n\"Where is your lover?\" he said to his wife as he entered the shop.\nThis was his favorite joke. \"I never see him nowadays and must hunt\nhim up.\"\n\nHe meant Goujet, who came but rarely, lest the gossips in the\nneighborhood should take it upon themselves to gabble. Once in about\nten days he made his appearance in the evening and installed himself\nin a corner in the back shop with his pipe. He rarely spoke but\nlaughed at all Gervaise said.\n\nOn Saturday evenings the establishment was kept open half the night. A\nlamp hung from the ceiling with the light thrown down by a shade. The\nshutters were put up at the usual time, but as the nights were very\nwarm the door was left open, and as the hours wore on the women pulled\ntheir jackets open a little more at the throat, and he sat in his\ncorner and looked on as if he were at a theater.\n\nThe silence of the street was broken by a passing carriage. Two\no'clock struck--no longer a sound from outside. At half-past two a\nman hurried past the door, carrying with him a vision of flying arms,\npiles of white linen and a glow of yellow light.\n\nGoujet, wishing to save Etienne from Coupeau's rough treatment, had\ntaken him to the place where he was employed to blow the bellows, with\nthe prospect of becoming an apprentice as soon as he was old enough,\nand Etienne thus became another tie between the clearstarcher and the\nblacksmith.\n\nAll their little world laughed and told Gervaise that her friend\nworshiped the very ground she trod upon. She colored and looked like\na girl of sixteen.\n\n\"Dear boy,\" she said to herself, \"I know he loves me, but never has\nhe said or will he say a word of the kind to me!\" And she was proud\nof being loved in this way. When she was disturbed about anything her\nfirst thought was to go to him. When by chance they were left alone\ntogether they were never disturbed by wondering if their friendship\nverged on love. There was no harm in such affection.\n\nNana was now six years old and a most troublesome little sprite. Her\nmother took her every morning to a school in the Rue Polonceau, to\na certain Mlle Josse. Here she did all manner of mischief. She put\nashes into the teacher's snuffbox, pinned the skirts of her companions\ntogether. Twice the young lady was sent home in disgrace and then\ntaken back again for the sake of the six francs each month. As soon as\nschool hours were over Nana revenged herself for the hours of enforced\nquiet she had passed by making the most frightful din in the courtyard\nand the shop.\n\nShe found able allies in Pauline and Victor Boche. The whole great\nhouse resounded with the most extraordinary noises--the thumps of\nchildren falling downstairs, little feet tearing up one staircase\nand down another and bursting out on the sidewalk like a band of\npilfering, impudent sparrows.\n\nMme Gaudron alone had nine--dirty, unwashed and unkempt, their\nstockings hanging over their shoes and the slits in their garments\nshowing the white skin beneath. Another woman on the fifth floor had\nseven, and they came out in twos and threes from all the rooms. Nana\nreigned over this band, among which there were some half grown and\nothers mere infants. Her prime ministers were Pauline and Victor;\nto them she delegated a little of her authority while she played\nmamma, undressed the youngest only to dress them again, cuffed them\nand punished them at her own sweet will and with the most fantastic\ndisposition. The band pranced and waded through the gutter that ran\nfrom the dyehouse and emerged with blue or green legs. Nana decorated\nherself and the others with shavings from the cabinetmaker's, which\nthey stole from under the very noses of the workmen.\n\nThe courtyard belonged to all of these children, apparently, and\nresounded with the clatter of their heels. Sometimes this courtyard,\nhowever, was not enough for them, and they spread in every direction\nto the infinite disgust of Mme Boche, who grumbled all in vain. Boche\ndeclared that the children of the poor were as plentiful as mushrooms\non a dung heap, and his wife threatened them with her broom.\n\nOne day there was a terrible scene. Nana had invented a beautiful\ngame. She had stolen a wooden shoe belonging to Mme Boche; she bored\na hole in it and put in a string, by which she could draw it like a\ncart. Victor filled it with apple parings, and they started forth in\na procession, Nana drawing the shoe in front, followed by the whole\nflock, little and big, an imp about the height of a cigar box at the\nend. They all sang a melancholy ditty full of \"ahs\" and \"ohs.\" Nana\ndeclared this to be always the custom at funerals.\n\n\"What on earth are they doing now?\" murmured Mme Boche suspiciously,\nand then she came to the door and peered out.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" she cried. \"It is my shoe they have got.\"\n\nShe slapped Nana, cuffed Pauline and shook Victor. Gervaise was\nfilling a bucket at the fountain, and when she saw Nana with her nose\nbleeding she rushed toward the concierge and asked how she dared\nstrike her child.\n\nThe concierge replied that anyone who had a child like that had\nbest keep her under lock and key. The end of this was, of course,\na complete break between the old friends.\n\nBut, in fact, the quarrel had been growing for a month. Gervaise,\ngenerous by nature and knowing the tastes of the Boche people, was\nin the habit of making them constant presents--oranges, a little\nhot soup, a cake or something of the kind. One evening, knowing that\nthe concierge would sell her soul for a good salad, she took her\nthe remains of a dish of beets and chicory. The next day she was\ndumfounded at hearing from Mlle Remanjon how Mme Boche had thrown the\nsalad away, saying that she was not yet reduced to eating the leavings\nof other people! From that day forth Gervaise sent her nothing more.\nThe Boches had learned to look on her little offerings as their right,\nand they now felt themselves to be robbed by the Coupeaus.\n\nIt was not long before Gervaise realized she had made a mistake, for\nwhen she was one day late with her October rent Mme Boche complained\nto the proprietor, who came blustering to her shop with his hat on.\nOf course, too, the Lorilleuxs extended the right hand of fellowship\nat once to the Boche people.\n\nThere came a day, however, when Gervaise found it necessary to call on\nthe Lorilleuxs. It was on Mamma Coupeau's account, who was sixty-seven\nyears old, nearly blind and helpless. They must all unite in doing\nsomething for her now. Gervaise thought it a burning shame that a\nwoman of her age, with three well-to-do children, should be allowed\nfor a moment to regard herself as friendless and forsaken. And as her\nhusband refused to speak to his sister, Gervaise said she would.\n\nShe entered the room like a whirlwind, without knocking. Everything\nwas just as it was on that night when she had been received by them\nin a fashion which she had never forgotten or forgiven. \"I have come,\"\ncried Gervaise, \"and I dare say you wish to know why, particularly\nas we are at daggers drawn. Well then, I have come on Mamma Coupeau's\naccount. I have come to ask if we are to allow her to beg her bread\nfrom door to door----\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said Mme Lorilleux with a sneer, and she turned away.\n\nBut Lorilleux lifted his pale face.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" he asked, and as he had understood perfectly,\nhe went on:\n\n\"What is this cry of poverty about? The old lady ate her dinner with\nus yesterday. We do all we can for her, I am sure. We have not the\nmines of Peru within our reach, but if she thinks she is to run to\nand fro between our houses she is much mistaken. I, for one, have no\nliking for spies.\" He then added as he took up his microscope, \"When\nthe rest of you agree to give five francs per month toward her support\nwe will do the same.\" Gervaise was calmer now; these people always\nchilled the very marrow in her bones, and she went on to explain her\nviews. Five francs were not enough for each of the old lady's children\nto pay. She could not live on fifteen francs per month.\n\n\"And why not?\" cried Lorilleux. \"She ought to do so. She can see well\nenough to find the best bits in a dish before her, and she can do\nsomething toward her own maintenance.\" If he had the means to indulge\nsuch laziness he should not consider it his duty to do so, he added.\n\nThen Gervaise grew angry again. She looked at her sister-in-law and\nsaw her face set in vindictive firmness.\n\n\"Keep your money,\" she cried. \"I will take care of your mother. I\nfound a starving cat in the street the other night and took it in. I\ncan take in your mother too. She shall want for nothing. Good heavens,\nwhat people!\"\n\nMme Lorilleux snatched up a saucepan.\n\n\"Clear out,\" she said hoarsely. \"I will never give one sou--no, not\none sou--toward her keep. I understand you! You will make my mother\nwork for you like a slave and put my five francs in your pocket! Not\nif I know it, madame! And if she goes to live under your roof I will\nnever see her again. Be off with you, I say!\"\n\n\"What a monster!\" cried Gervaise as she shut the door with a bang. On\nthe very next day Mme Coupeau came to her. A large bed was put in the\nroom where Nana slept. The moving did not take long, for the old lady\nhad only this bed, a wardrobe, table and two chairs. The table was\nsold and the chairs new-seated, and the old lady the evening of her\narrival washed the dishes and swept up the room, glad to make herself\nuseful. Mme Lerat had amused herself by quarreling with her sister,\nto whom she had expressed her admiration of the generosity evinced\nby Gervaise, and when she saw that Mme Lorilleux was intensely\nexasperated she declared she had never seen such eyes in anybody's\nhead as those of the clearstarcher. She really believed one might\nlight paper at them. This declaration naturally led to bitter words,\nand the sisters parted, swearing they would never see each other\nagain, and since then Mme Lerat had spent most of her evenings at\nher brother's.\n\nThree years passed away. There were reconciliations and new quarrels.\nGervaise continued to be liked by her neighbors; she paid her bills\nregularly and was a good customer. When she went out she received\ncordial greetings on all sides, and she was more fond of going out in\nthese days than of yore. She liked to stand at the corners and chat.\nShe liked to loiter with her arms full of bundles at a neighbor's\nwindow and hear a little gossip.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nGOUJET AT HIS FORGE\n\nOne autumnal afternoon Gervaise, who had been to carry a basket of\nclothes home to a customer who lived a good way off, found herself in\nLa Rue des Poissonniers just as it was growing dark. It had rained in\nthe morning, and the air was close and warm. She was tired with her\nwalk and felt a great desire for something good to eat. Just then she\nlifted her eyes and, seeing the name of the street, she took it into\nher head that she would call on Goujet at his forge. But she would ask\nfor Etienne, she said to herself. She did not know the number, but she\ncould find it, she thought. She wandered along and stood bewildered,\nlooking toward Montmartre; all at once she heard the measured click of\nhammers and concluded that she had stumbled on the place at last. She\ndid not know where the entrance to the building was, but she caught a\ngleam of a red light in the distance; she walked toward it and was met\nby a workman.\n\n\"Is it here, sir,\" she said timidly, \"that my child--a little boy,\nthat is to say--works? A little boy by the name of Etienne?\"\n\n\"Etienne! Etienne!\" repeated the man, swaying from side to side. The\nwind brought from him to her an intolerable smell of brandy, which\ncaused Gervaise to draw back and say timidly:\n\n\"Is it here that Monsieur Goujet works?\"\n\n\"Ah, Goujet, yes. If it is Goujet you wish to see go to the left.\"\n\nGervaise obeyed his instructions and found herself in a large room\nwith the forge at the farther end. She spoke to the first man she saw,\nwhen suddenly the whole room was one blaze of light. The bellows had\nsent up leaping flames which lit every crevice and corner of the dusty\nold building, and Gervaise recognized Goujet before the forge with two\nother men. She went toward him.\n\n\"Madame Gervaise!\" he exclaimed in surprise, his face radiant with\njoy, and then seeing his companions laugh and wink, he pushed Etienne\ntoward his mother. \"You came to see your boy,\" he said; \"he does his\nduty like a hero.\n\n\"I am glad of it,\" she answered, \"but what an awful place this is to\nget at!\"\n\nAnd she described her journey, as she called it, and then asked why\nno one seemed to know Etienne there.\n\n\"Because,\" said the blacksmith, \"he is called Zou Zou here, as his\nhair is cut short as a Zouave's.\"\n\nThis visit paid by Gervaise to the forge was only the first of many\nothers. She often went on Saturdays when she carried the clean linen\nto Mme Goujet, who still resided in the same house as before. The\nfirst year Gervaise had paid them twenty francs each month, or rather\nthe difference between the amount of their washing, seven or eight\nfrancs, and the twenty which she agreed upon. In this way she had paid\nhalf the money she had borrowed, when one quarter day, not knowing\nto whom to turn, as she had not been able to collect her bills\npunctually, she ran to the Goujets' and borrowed the amount of her\nrent from them. Twice since she had asked a similar favor, so that the\namount of her indebtedness now stood at four hundred and twenty-five\nfrancs.\n\nNow she no longer paid any cash but did their washing. It was not that\nshe worked less hard or that her business was falling off. Quite the\ncontrary; but money had a way of melting away in her hands, and she\nwas content nowadays if she could only make both ends meet. What was\nthe use of fussing, she thought? If she could manage to live that was\nall that was necessary. She was growing quite stout withal.\n\nMme Goujet was always kind to Gervaise, not because of any fear of\nlosing her money, but because she really loved her and was afraid of\nher going wrong in some way.\n\nThe Saturday after the first visit paid by Gervaise to the forge was\nalso the first of the month. When she reached Mme Goujet's her basket\nwas so heavy that she panted for two good minutes before she could\nspeak. Every one knows how heavy shirts and such things are.\n\n\"Have you brought everything?\" asked Mme Goujet, who was very exacting\non this point. She insisted on every piece being returned each week.\nAnother thing she exacted was that the clothes should be brought back\nalways on the same day and hour.\n\n\"Everything is here,\" answered Gervaise with a smile. \"You know I\nnever leave anything behind.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" replied the elder woman. \"You have many faults, my\ndear, but not that one yet.\"\n\nAnd while the laundress emptied her basket, laying the linen on\nthe bed, Mme Goujet paid her many compliments. She never burned her\nclothes or ironed off the buttons or tore them, but she did use a\ntrifle too much bluing and made her shirts too stiff.\n\n\"Feel,\" she said; \"it is like pasteboard. My son never complains,\nbut I know he does not like them so.\"\n\n\"And they shall not be so again,\" said Gervaise. \"No one ever touches\nany of your things but myself, and I would do them over ten times\nrather than see you dissatisfied.\"\n\nShe colored as she spoke.\n\n\"I have no intention of disparaging your work,\" answered Mme Goujet.\n\"I never saw anyone who did up laces and embroideries as you do, and\nthe fluting is simply perfect; the only trouble is a little too much\nstarch, my dear. Goujet does not care to look like a fine gentleman.\"\n\nShe took up her book and drew a pen through the pieces as she spoke.\nEverything was there. She brought out the bundle of soiled clothes.\nGervaise put them in her basket and hesitated.\n\n\"Madame Goujet,\" she said at last, \"if you do not mind I should like\nto have the money for this week's wash.\"\n\nThe account this month was larger than usual, ten francs and over.\nMme Goujet looked at her gravely.\n\n\"My child,\" she said slowly, \"it shall be as you wish. I do not refuse\nto give you the money if you desire it; only this is not the way to\nget out of debt. I say this with no unkindness, you understand. Only\nyou must take care.\"\n\nGervaise, with downcast eyes, received the lesson meekly. She needed\nthe ten francs to complete the amount due the coal merchant, she said.\n\nBut her friend heard this with a stern countenance and told her\nshe should reduce her expenses, but she did not add that she, too,\nintended to do the same and that in future she should do her washing\nherself, as she had formerly done, if she were to be out of pocket\nthus.\n\nWhen Gervaise was on the staircase her heart was light, for she cared\nlittle for the reproof now that she had the ten francs in her hand;\nshe was becoming accustomed to paying one debt by contracting another.\n\nMidway on the stairs she met a tall woman coming up with a fresh\nmackerel in her hand, and behold! it was Virginie, the girl whom she\nhad whipped in the lavatory. The two looked each other full in the\nface. Gervaise instinctively closed her eyes, for she thought the girl\nwould slap her in the face with the mackerel. But, no; Virginie gave a\nconstrained smile. Then the laundress, whose huge basket filled up the\nstairway and who did not choose to be outdone in politeness, said:\n\n\"I beg your pardon--\"\n\n\"Pray don't apologize,\" answered Virginie in a stately fashion.\n\nAnd they stood and talked for a few minutes with not the smallest\nallusion, however, to the past.\n\nVirginie, then about twenty-nine, was really a magnificent-looking\nwoman, head well set on her shoulders and a long, oval face crowned by\nbands of glossy black hair. She told her history in a few brief words.\nShe was married. Had married the previous spring a cabinetmaker who\nhad given up his trade and was hoping to obtain a position on the\npolice force. She had just been out to buy this mackerel for him.\n\n\"He adores them,\" she said, \"and we women spoil our husbands, I think.\nBut come up. We are standing in a draft here.\"\n\nWhen Gervaise had, in her turn, told her story and added that Virginie\nwas living in the very rooms where she had lived and where her child\nwas born, Virginie became still more urgent that she should go up. \"It\nis always pleasant to see a place where one has been happy,\" she said.\nShe herself had been living on the other side of the water but had got\ntired of it and had moved into these rooms only two weeks ago. She was\nnot settled yet. Her name was Mme Poisson.\n\n\"And mine,\" said Gervaise, \"is Coupeau.\"\n\nGervaise was a little suspicious of all this courtesy. Might not some\nterrible revenge be hidden under it all? And she determined to be well\non her guard. But as Virginie was so polite just now she must be\npolite in her turn.\n\nPoisson, the husband, was a man of thirty-five with a mustache and\nimperial; he was seated at a table near the window, making little\nboxes. His only tools were a penknife, a tiny saw and a gluepot; he\nwas executing the most wonderful and delicate carving, however. He\nnever sold his work but made presents of it to his friends. It amused\nhim while he was awaiting his appointment.\n\nPoisson rose and bowed politely to Gervaise, whom his wife called an\nold friend. But he did not speak, his conversational powers not being\nhis strong point. He cast a plaintive glance at the mackerel, however,\nfrom time to time. Gervaise looked around the room and described her\nfurniture and where it had stood. How strange it was, after losing\nsight of each other so long, that they should occupy the same\napartment! Virginie entered into new details. He had a small\ninheritance from his aunt, and she herself sewed a little, made a\ndress now and then. At the end of a half-hour Gervaise rose to depart;\nVirginie went to the head of the stairs with her, and there both\nhesitated. Gervaise fancied that Virginie wished to say something\nabout Lantier and Adele, but they separated without touching on these\ndisagreeable topics.\n\nThis was the beginning of a great friendship. In another week Virginie\ncould not pass the shop without going in, and sometimes she remained\nfor two or three hours. At first Gervaise was very uncomfortable;\nshe thought every time Virginie opened her lips that she would hear\nLantier's name. Lantier was in her mind all the time she was with Mme\nPoisson. It was a stupid thing to do, after all, for what on earth\ndid she care what had become of Lantier or of Adele? But she was,\nnonetheless, curious to know something about them.\n\nWinter had come, the fourth winter that the Coupeaus had spent in La\nRue de la Goutte-d'Or. This year December and January were especially\nsevere, and after New Year's the snow lay three weeks in the street\nwithout melting. There was plenty of work for Gervaise, and her shop\nwas delightfully warm and singularly quiet, for the carriages made\nno noise in the snow-covered streets. The laughs and shouts of the\nchildren were almost the only sounds; they had made a long slide and\nenjoyed themselves hugely.\n\nGervaise took especial pleasure in her coffee at noon. Her apprentices\nhad no reason to complain, for it was hot and strong and unadulterated\nby chicory. On the morning of Twelfth-day the clock had struck twelve\nand then half past, and the coffee was not ready. Gervaise was ironing\nsome muslin curtains. Clemence, with a frightful cold, was, as usual,\nat work on a man's shirt. Mme Putois was ironing a skirt on a board,\nwith a cloth laid on the floor to prevent the skirt from being soiled.\nMamma Coupeau brought in the coffee, and as each one of the women took\na cup with a sigh of enjoyment the street door opened and Virginie\ncame in with a rush of cold air.\n\n\"Heavens!\" she cried. \"It is awful! My ears are cut off!\"\n\n\"You have come just in time for a cup of hot coffee,\" said Gervaise\ncordially.\n\n\"And I shall be only too glad to have it!\" answered Virginie with a\nshiver. She had been waiting at the grocer's, she said, until she was\nchilled through and through. The heat of that room was delicious, and\nthen she stirred her coffee and said she liked the damp, sweet smell\nof the freshly ironed linen. She and Mamma Coupeau were the only ones\nwho had chairs; the others sat on wooden footstools, so low that they\nseemed to be on the floor. Virginie suddenly stooped down to her\nhostess and said with a smile:\n\n\"Do you remember that day at the lavatory?\"\n\nGervaise colored; she could not answer. This was just what she had\nbeen dreading. In a moment she felt sure she would hear Lantier's\nname. She knew it was coming. Virginie drew nearer to her. The\napprentices lingered over their coffee and told each other as they\nlooked stupidly into the street what they would do if they had an\nincome of ten thousand francs. Virginie changed her seat and took\na footstool by the side of Gervaise, who felt weak and cowardly and\nhelpless to change the conversation or to stave off what was coming.\nShe breathlessly awaited the next words, her heart big with an emotion\nwhich she would not acknowledge to herself.\n\n\"I do not wish to give you any pain,\" said Virginie blandly. \"Twenty\ntimes the words have been on my lips, but I hesitated. Pray don't\nthink I bear you any malice.\"\n\nShe tipped up her cup and drank the last drop of her coffee. Gervaise,\nwith her heart in her mouth, waited in a dull agony of suspense,\nasking herself if Virginie could have forgiven the insult in the\nlavatory. There was a glitter in the woman's eyes she did not like.\n\n\"You had an excuse,\" Virginie added as she placed her cup on the\ntable. \"You had been abominably treated. I should have killed\nsomeone.\" And then, dropping her little-affected tone, she continued\nmore rapidly:\n\n\"They were not happy, I assure you, not at all happy. They lived in a\ndirty street, where the mud was up to their knees. I went to breakfast\nwith them two days after he left you and found them in the height of\na quarrel. You know that Adele is a wretch. She is my sister, to be\nsure, but she is a wretch all the same. As to Lantier--well, you know\nhim, so I need not describe him. But for a yes or a no he would not\nhesitate to thresh any woman that lives. Oh, they had a beautiful\ntime! Their quarrels were heard all over the neighborhood. One day\nthe police were sent for, they made such a hubbub.\"\n\nShe talked on and on, telling things that were enough to make the hair\nstand up on one's head. Gervaise listened, as pale as death, with a\nnervous trembling of her lips which might have been taken for a smile.\nFor seven years she had never heard Lantier's name, and she would\nnot have believed that she could have felt any such overwhelming\nagitation. She could no longer be jealous of Adele, but she smiled\ngrimly as she thought of the blows she had received in her turn from\nLantier, and she would have listened for hours to all that Virginia\nhad to tell, but she did not ask a question for some time. Finally\nshe said:\n\n\"And do they still live in that same place?\"\n\n\"No indeed! But I have not told you all yet. They separated a week\nago.\"\n\n\"Separated!\" exclaimed the clearstarcher.\n\n\"Who is separated?\" asked Clemence, interrupting her conversation\nwith Mamma Coupeau.\n\n\"No one,\" said Virginie, \"or at least no one whom you know.\"\n\nAs she spoke she looked at Gervaise and seemed to take a positive\ndelight in disturbing her still more. She suddenly asked her what\nshe would do or say if Lantier should suddenly make his appearance,\nfor men were so strange; no one could ever tell what they would do.\nLantier was quite capable of returning to his old love. Then Gervaise\ninterrupted her and rose to the occasion. She answered with grave\ndignity that she was married now and that if Lantier should appear\nshe would ask him to leave. There could never be anything more between\nthem, not even the most distant acquaintance.\n\n\"I know very well,\" she said, \"that Etienne belongs to him, and if\nLantier desires to see his son I shall place no obstacle in his way.\nBut as to myself, Madame Poisson, he shall never touch my little\nfinger again! It is finished.\"\n\nAs she uttered these last words she traced a cross in the air to seal\nher oath, and as if desirous to put an end to the conversation, she\ncalled out to her women:\n\n\"Do you think the ironing will be done today if you sit still? To\nwork! To work!\"\n\nThe women did not move; they were lulled to apathy by the heat, and\nGervaise herself found it very difficult to resume her labors. Her\ncurtains had dried in all this time, and some coffee had been spilled\non them, and she must wash out the spots.\n\n\"Au revoir!\" said Virginie. \"I came out to buy a half pound of cheese.\nPoisson will think I am frozen to death!\"\n\nThe better part of the day was now gone, and it was this way every\nday, for the shop was the refuge and haunt of all the chilly people\nin the neighborhood. Gervaise liked the reputation of having the\nmost comfortable room in the _Quartier_, and she held her receptions,\nas the Lorilleux and Boche clique said, with a sniff of disdain. She\nwould, in fact, have liked to bring in the very poor whom she saw\nshivering outside. She became very friendly toward a journeyman\npainter, an old man of seventy, who lived in a loft of the house,\nwhere he shivered with cold and hunger. He had lost his three sons\nin the Crimea, and for two years his hand had been so cramped by\nrheumatism that he could not hold a brush.\n\nWhenever Gervaise saw Father Bru she called him in, made a place for\nhim near the stove and gave him some bread and cheese. Father Bru,\nwith his white beard and his face wrinkled like an old apple, sat\nin silent content for hours at a time, enjoying the warmth and the\ncrackling of the coke.\n\n\"What are you thinking about?\" Gervaise would say gaily.\n\n\"Of nothing--of all sorts of things,\" he would reply with a dazed air.\n\nThe workwomen laughed and thought it a good joke to ask if he were in\nlove. He paid little heed to them but relapsed into silent thought.\n\nFrom this time Virginie often spoke to Gervaise of Lantier, and one\nday she said she had just met him. But as the clearstarcher made no\nreply Virginie then said no more. But on the next day she returned to\nthe subject and told her that he had talked long and tenderly of her.\nGervaise was much troubled by these whispered conversations in the\ncorner of her shop. The name of Lantier made her faint and sick at\nheart. She believed herself to be an honest woman. She meant, in every\nway, to do right and to shun the wrong, because she felt that only in\ndoing so could she be happy. She did not think much of Coupeau because\nshe was conscious of no shortcomings toward him. But she thought of\nher friend at the forge, and it seemed to her that this return of her\ninterest in Lantier, faint and undecided as it was, was an infidelity\nto Goujet and to that tender friendship which had become so very\nprecious to her. Her heart was much troubled in these days. She dwelt\non that time when her first lover left her. She imagined another day\nwhen, quitting Adele, he might return to her--with that old familiar\ntrunk.\n\nWhen she went into the street it was with a spasm of terror. She\nfancied that every step behind her was Lantier's. She dared not\nlook around lest his hand should glide about her waist. He might\nbe watching for her at any time. He might come to her door in the\nafternoon, and this idea brought a cold sweat to her forehead, because\nhe would certainly kiss her on her ear as he had often teased her by\ndoing in the years gone by. It was this kiss she dreaded. Its dull\nreverberation deafened her to all outside sounds, and she could hear\nonly the beatings of her own heart. When these terrors assailed her\nthe forge was her only asylum, from whence she returned smiling and\nserene, feeling that Goujet, whose sonorous hammer had put all her\nbad dreams to flight, would protect her always.\n\nWhat a happy season this was after all! The clearstarcher always\ncarried a certain basket of clothes to her customer each week, because\nit gave her a pretext for going into the forge, as it was on her\nway. As soon as she turned the corner of the street in which it was\nsituated she felt as lighthearted as if she were going to the country.\nThe black charcoal dust in the road, the black smoke rising slowly\nfrom the chimneys, interested and pleased her as much as a mossy path\nthrough the woods. Afar off the forge was red even at midday, and\nher heart danced in time with the hammers. Goujet was expecting her\nand making more noise than usual, that she might hear him at a great\ndistance. She gave Etienne a light tap on his cheek and sat quietly\nwatching these two--this man and boy, who were so dear to her--for an\nhour without speaking. When the sparks touched her tender skin she\nrather enjoyed the sensation. He, in his turn, was fully aware of\nthe happiness she felt in being there, and he reserved the work which\nrequired skill for the time when she could look on in wonder and\nadmiration. It was an idyl that they were unconsciously enacting all\nthat spring, and when Gervaise returned to her home it was in a spirit\nof sweet content.\n\nBy degrees her unreasonable fears of Lantier were conquered. Coupeau\nwas behaving very badly at this time, and one evening as she passed\nthe Assommoir she was certain she saw him drinking with Mes-Bottes.\nShe hurried on lest she should seem to be watching him. But as she\nhastened she looked over her shoulder. Yes, it was Coupeau who was\ntossing down a glass of liquor with an air as if it were no new\nthing. He had lied to her then; he did drink brandy. She was in utter\ndespair, and all her old horror of brandy returned. Wine she could\nhave forgiven--wine was good for a working man--liquor, on the\ncontrary, was his ruin and took from him all desire for the food that\nnourished and gave him strength for his daily toil. Why did not the\ngovernment interfere and prevent the manufacture of such pernicious\nthings?\n\nWhen she reached her home she found the whole house in confusion. Her\nemployees had left their work and were in the courtyard. She asked\nwhat the matter was.\n\n\"It is Father Bijard beating his wife; he is as drunk as a fool, and\nhe drove her up the stairs to her room, where he is murdering her.\nJust listen!\"\n\nGervaise flew up the stairs. She was very fond of Mme Bijard, who was\nher laundress and whose courage and industry she greatly admired. On\nthe sixth floor a little crowd was assembled. Mme Boche stood at an\nopen door.\n\n\"Have done!\" she cried. \"Have done, or the police will be summoned.\"\n\nNo one dared enter the room, because Bijard was well known to be like\na madman when he was tipsy. He was rarely thoroughly sober, and on the\noccasional days when he condescended to work he always had a bottle\nof brandy at his side. He rarely ate anything, and if a match had been\ntouched to his mouth he would have taken fire like a torch.\n\n\"Would you let her be killed?\" exclaimed Gervaise, trembling from head\nto foot, and she entered the attic room, which was very clean and very\nbare, for the man had sold the very sheets off the bed to satisfy his\nmad passion for drink. In this terrible struggle for life the table\nhad been thrown over, and the two chairs also. On the floor lay the\npoor woman with her skirts drenched as she had come from the washtub,\nher hair streaming over her bloody face, uttering low groans at each\nkick the brute gave her.\n\nThe neighbors whispered to each other that she had refused to give\nhim the money she had earned that day. Boche called up the staircase\nto his wife:\n\n\"Come down, I say; let him kill her if he will. It will only make one\nfool the less in the world!\"\n\nFather Bru followed Gervaise into the room, and the two expostulated\nwith the madman. But he turned toward them, pale and threatening;\na white foam glistened on his lips, and in his faded eyes there was a\nmurderous expression. He grasped Father Bru by the shoulder and threw\nhim over the table and shook Gervaise until her teeth chattered and\nthen returned to his wife, who lay motionless, with her mouth wide\nopen and her eyes closed; and during this frightful scene little\nLalie, four years old, was in the corner, looking on at the murder\nof her mother. The child's arms were round her sister Henriette,\na baby who had just been weaned. She stood with a sad, solemn face\nand serious, melancholy eyes but shed no tears.\n\nWhen Bijard slipped and fell Gervaise and Father Bru helped the poor\ncreature to her feet, who then burst into sobs. Lalie went to her\nside, but she did not cry, for the child was already habituated to\nsuch scenes. And as Gervaise went down the stairs she was haunted by\nthe strange look of resignation and courage in Lalie's eyes; it was\nan expression belonging to maturity and experience rather than to\nchildhood.\n\n\"Your husband is on the other side of the street,\" said Clemence\nas soon as she saw Gervaise; \"he is as tipsy as possible!\"\n\nCoupeau reeled in, breaking a square of glass with his shoulder as\nhe missed the doorway. He was not tipsy but drunk, with his teeth set\nfirmly together and a pinched expression about the nose. And Gervaise\ninstantly knew that it was the liquor of the Assommoir which had\nvitiated his blood. She tried to smile and coaxed him to go to bed.\nBut he shook her off and as he passed her gave her a blow.\n\nHe was just like the other--the beast upstairs who was now snoring,\ntired out by beating his wife. She was chilled to the heart and\ndesperate. Were all men alike? She thought of Lantier and of her\nhusband and wondered if there was no happiness in the world.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nA BIRTHDAY FETE\n\nThe nineteenth of June was the clearstarcher's birthday. There was\nalways an excuse for a fete in the Coupeau mansion; saints were\ninvented to serve as a pretext for idleness and festivities. Virginie\nhighly commended Gervaise for living luxuriously. What was the use\nof her husband drinking up everything? Why should she save for her\nhusband to spend at all the wineshops in the neighborhood? And\nGervaise accepted this excuse. She was growing very indolent and\nmuch stouter, while her lameness had perceptibly increased.\n\nFor a whole month they discussed the preparation for this fete; they\ntalked over dishes and licked their lips. They must have something out\nof the common way. Gervaise was much troubled as to whom she should\ninvite. She wanted exactly twelve at table, not one more or one less.\nShe, her husband, her mother-in-law and Mme Lerat were four. The\nGoujets and Poissons were four more. At first she thought she would\nnot ask her two women, Mme Putois and Clemence, lest it should make\nthem too familiar, but as the entertainment was constantly under\ndiscussion before them she ended by inviting them too. Thus there were\nten; she must have two more. She decided on a reconciliation with the\nLorilleuxs, who had extended the olive branch several times lately.\nFamily quarrels were bad things, she said. When the Boche people heard\nof this they showed several little courtesies to Gervaise, who felt\nobliged to urge them to come also. This made fourteen without counting\nthe children. She had never had a dinner like this, and she was both\ntriumphant and terrified.\n\nThe nineteenth fell on a Monday, and Gervaise thought it very\nfortunate, as she could begin her cooking on Sunday afternoon. On\nSaturday, while the women hurried through their work, there was an\nendless discussion as to what the dishes should be. In the last three\nweeks only one thing had been definitely decided upon--a roast goose\nstuffed with onions. The goose had been purchased, and Mme Coupeau\nbrought it in that Mme Putois might guess its weight. The thing looked\nenormous, and the fat seemed to burst from its yellow skin.\n\n\"Soup before that, of course,\" said Gervaise, \"and we must have\nanother dish.\"\n\nClemence proposed rabbits, but Gervaise wanted something more\ndistinguished. Mme Putois suggested a _blanquette du veau_.\n\nThat was a new idea. Veal was always good too. Then Mme Coupeau made\nan allusion to fish, which no one seconded. Evidently fish was not\nin favor. Gervaise proposed a sparerib of pork and potatoes, which\nbrightened all their faces, just as Virginie came in like a whirlwind.\n\n\"You are just in season. Mamma Coupeau, show her the goose,\" cried\nGervaise.\n\nVirginie admired it, guessed the weight and laid it down on the\nironing table between an embroidered skirt and a pile of shirts. She\nwas evidently thinking of something else. She soon led Gervaise into\nthe back shop.\n\n\"I have come to warn you,\" she said quickly. \"I just met Lantier\nat the very end of this street, and I am sure he followed me, and\nI naturally felt alarmed on your account, my dear.\"\n\nGervaise turned very pale. What did he want of her? And why on earth\nshould he worry her now amid all the busy preparations for the fete?\nIt seemed as if she never in her life had set her heart on anything\nthat she was not disappointed. Why was it that she could never have\na minute's peace?\n\nBut Virginie declared that she would look out for her. If Lantier\nfollowed her she would certainly give him over to the police. Her\nhusband had been in office now for a month, and Virginie was very\ndictatorial and aggressive and talked of arresting everyone who\ndispleased her. She raised her voice as she spoke, but Gervaise\nimplored her to be cautious, because her women could hear every word.\nThey went back to the front shop, and she was the first to speak.\n\n\"We have said nothing of vegetables,\" she said quietly.\n\n\"Peas, with a bit of pork,\" said Virginie authoritatively.\n\nThis was agreed upon with enthusiasm.\n\nThe next day at three Mamma Coupeau lighted the two furnaces belonging\nto the house and a third one borrowed from Mme Boche, and at half-past\nthree the soup was gently simmering in a large pot lent by the\nrestaurant at the corner. They had decided to cook the veal and the\npork the day previous, as those two dishes could be warmed up so well,\nand would leave for Monday only the goose to roast and the vegetables.\nThe back shop was ruddy with the glow from the three furnaces--sauces\nwere bubbling with a strong smell of browned flour. Mamma Coupeau\nand Gervaise, each with large white aprons, were washing celery and\nrunning hither and thither with pepper and salt or hurriedly turning\nthe veal with flat wooden sticks made for the purpose. They had told\nCoupeau pleasantly that his room was better than his company, but they\nhad plenty of people there that afternoon. The smell of the cooking\nfound its way out into the street and up through the house, and the\nneighbors, impelled by curiosity, came down on all sorts of pretexts,\nmerely to discover what was going on.\n\nAbout five Virginie made her appearance. She had seen Lantier twice.\nIndeed, it was impossible nowadays to enter the street and not see\nhim. Mme Boche, too, had spoken to him on the corner below. Then\nGervaise, who was on the point of going for a sou's worth of fried\nonions to season her soup, shuddered from head to foot and said she\nwould not go out ever again. The concierge and Virginie added to her\nterror by a succession of stories of men who lay in wait for women,\nwith knives and pistols hidden in their coats.\n\nSuch things were read every day in the papers! When such a scamp as\nLantier found a woman happy and comfortable, he was always wretched\nuntil he had made her so too. Virginie said she would go for the\nonions. \"Women,\" she observed sententiously, \"should protect each\nother, as well as serve each other, in such matters.\" When she\nreturned she reported that Lantier was no longer there. The\nconversation around the stove that evening never once drifted from\nthat subject. Mme Boche said that she, under similar circumstances,\nshould tell her husband, but Gervaise was horror-struck at this and\nbegged her never to breathe one single word about it. Besides, she\nfancied her husband had caught a glimpse of Lantier from something he\nhad muttered amid a volley of oaths two or three nights before. She\nwas filled with dread lest these two men should meet. She knew Coupeau\nso well that she had long since discovered that he was still jealous\nof Lantier, and while the four women discussed the imminent danger of\na terrible tragedy the sauces and the meats hissed and simmered on the\nfurnaces, and they ended by each taking a cup of soup to discover what\nimprovement was desirable.\n\nMonday arrived. Now that Gervaise had invited fourteen to dine, she\nbegan to be afraid there would not be room and finally decided to lay\nthe table in the shop. She was uncertain how to place the table, which\nwas the ironing table on trestles. In the midst of the hubbub and\nconfusion a customer arrived and made a scene because her linen had\nnot come home on the Friday previous. She insisted on having every\npiece that moment--clean or dirty, ironed or rough-dry.\n\nThen Gervaise, to excuse herself, told a lie with wonderful\n_sang-froid_. It was not her fault. She was cleaning her rooms. Her\nwomen would be at work again the next day, and she got rid of her\ncustomer, who went away soothed by the promise that her wash would\nbe sent to her early the following morning.\n\nBut Gervaise lost her temper, which was not a common thing with\nher, and as soon as the woman's back was turned called her by an\nopprobrious name and declared that if she did as people wished she\ncould not take time to eat and vowed she would not have an iron heated\nthat day or the next in her establishment. No! Not if the Grand Turk\nhimself should come and entreat her on his knees to do up a collar\nfor him. She meant to enjoy herself a little occasionally!\n\nThe entire morning was consumed in making purchases. Three times did\nGervaise go out and come in, laden with bundles. But when she went the\nfourth time for the wine she discovered that she had not money enough.\nShe could have got the wine on credit, but she could not be without\nmoney in the house, for a thousand little unexpected expenses arise\nat such times, and she and her mother-in-law racked their brains\nto know what they should do to get the twenty francs they considered\nnecessary. Mme Coupeau, who had once been housekeeper for an actress,\nwas the first to speak of the Mont-de-Piete. Gervaise laughed gaily.\n\n\"To be sure! Why had she not thought of it before?\"\n\nShe folded her black silk dress and pinned it in a napkin; then she\nhid the bundle under her mother-in-law's apron and bade her keep it\nvery flat, lest the neighbors, who were so terribly inquisitive,\nshould find it out, and then she watched the old woman from the door\nto see that no one followed her.\n\nBut when Mamma Coupeau had gone a few steps Gervaise called her back\ninto the shop and, taking her wedding ring from her finger, said:\n\n\"Take this, too, for we shall need all the money we can get today.\"\n\nAnd when the old woman came back with twenty-five francs she clapped\nher hands with joy. She ordered six bottles of wine with seals to\ndrink with the roast. The Lorilleuxs would be green with envy. For a\nfortnight this had been her idea, to crush the Lorilleuxs, who were\nnever known to ask a friend to their table; who, on the contrary,\nlocked their doors when they had anything special to eat. Gervaise\nwanted to give her a lesson and would have liked to offer the\nstrangers who passed her door a seat at her table. Money was a very\ngood thing and mighty pretty to look at, but it was good for nothing\nbut to spend.\n\nMamma Coupeau and Gervaise began to lay their table at three o'clock.\nThey had hung curtains before the windows, but as the day was warm the\ndoor into the street was open. The two women did not put on a plate\nor salt spoon without the avowed intention of worrying the Lorilleuxs.\nThey had given them seats where the table could be seen to the best\nadvantage, and they placed before them the real china plates.\n\n\"No, no, Mamma,\" cried Gervaise, \"not those napkins. I have two which\nare real damask.\"\n\n\"Well! Well! I declare!\" murmured the old woman. \"What will they say\nto all this?\"\n\nAnd they smiled as they stood at opposite sides of this long table\nwith its glossy white cloth and its places for fourteen carefully\nlaid. They worshiped there as if it had been a chapel erected in the\nmiddle of the shop.\n\n\"How false they are!\" said Gervaise. \"Do you remember how she declared\nshe had lost a piece of one of the chains when she was carrying them\nhome? That was only to get out of giving you your five francs.\"\n\n\"Which I have never had from them but just twice,\" muttered the old\nwoman.\n\n\"I will wager that next month they will invent another tale. That is\none reason why they lock their doors when they have a rabbit. They\nthink people might say, 'If you can eat rabbits you can give five\nfrancs to your mother!' How mean they are! What do they think would\nhave become of you if I had not asked you to come and live here?\"\n\nHer mother-in-law shook her head. She was rather severe in her\njudgment of the Lorilleuxs that day, inasmuch as she was influenced\nby the gorgeous entertainment given by the Coupeaus. She liked the\nexcitement; she liked to cook. She generally lived pretty well with\nGervaise, but on those days which occur in all households, when the\ndinner was scanty and unsatisfactory, she called herself a most\nunhappy woman, left to the mercy of a daughter-in-law. In the depths\nof her heart she still loved Mme Lorilleux; she was her eldest child.\n\n\"You certainly would have weighed some pounds less with her,\"\ncontinued Gervaise. \"No coffee, no tobacco, no sweets. And do you\nimagine that they would have put two mattresses on your bed?\"\n\n\"No indeed,\" answered the old woman, \"but I wish to see them when\nthey first come in--just to see how they look!\"\n\nAt four o'clock the goose was roasted, and Augustine, seated on a\nlittle footstool, was given a long-handled spoon and bidden to watch\nand baste it every few minutes. Gervaise was busy with the peas, and\nMamma Coupeau, with her head a little confused, was waiting until it\nwas time to heat the veal and the pork. At five the guests began to\narrive. Clemence and Mme Putois, gorgeous to behold in their Sunday\nrig, were the first.\n\nClemence wore a blue dress and had some geraniums in her hand; Madame\nwas in black, with a bunch of heliotrope. Gervaise, whose hands were\ncovered with flour, put them behind her back, came forward and kissed\nthem cordially.\n\nAfter them came Virginie in scarf and hat, though she had only to\ncross the street; she wore a printed muslin and was as imposing as\nany lady in the land. She brought a pot of red carnations and put\nboth her arms around her friend and kissed her.\n\nThe offering brought by Boche was a pot of pansies, and his wife's was\nmignonette; Mme Lerat's, a lemon verbena. The three furnaces filled\nthe room with an overpowering heat, and the frying potatoes drowned\ntheir voices. Gervaise was very sweet and smiling, thanking everyone\nfor the flowers, at the same time making the dressing for the salad.\nThe perfume of the flowers was perceived above all the smell of\ncooking.\n\n\"Can't I help you?\" said Virginie. \"It is a shame to have you work so\nhard for three days on all these things that we shall gobble up in no\ntime.\"\n\n\"No indeed,\" answered Gervaise; \"I am nearly through.\"\n\nThe ladies covered the bed with their shawls and bonnets and then went\ninto the shop that they might be out of the way and talked through the\nopen door with much noise and loud laughing.\n\nAt this moment Goujet appeared and stood timidly on the threshold with\na tall white rosebush in his arms whose flowers brushed against his\nyellow beard. Gervaise ran toward him with her cheeks reddened by her\nfurnaces. She took the plant, crying:\n\n\"How beautiful!\"\n\nHe dared not kiss her, and she was compelled to offer her cheek to\nhim, and both were embarrassed. He told her in a confused way that his\nmother was ill with sciatica and could not come. Gervaise was greatly\ndisappointed, but she had no time to say much just then: she was\nbeginning to be anxious about Coupeau--he ought to be in--then, too,\nwhere were the Lorilleuxs? She called Mme Lerat, who had arranged the\nreconciliation, and bade her go and see.\n\nMme Lerat put on her hat and shawl with excessive care and departed.\nA solemn hush of expectation pervaded the room.\n\nMme Lerat presently reappeared. She had come round by the street to\ngive a more ceremonious aspect to the affair. She held the door open\nwhile Mme Lorilleux, in a silk dress, stood on the threshold. All the\nguests rose, and Gervaise went forward to meet her sister and kissed\nher, as had been agreed upon.\n\n\"Come in! Come in!\" she said. \"We are friends again.\"\n\n\"And I hope for always,\" answered her sister-in-law severely.\n\nAfter she was ushered in the same program had to be followed out with\nher husband. Neither of the two brought any flowers. They had refused\nto do so, saying that it would look as if they were bowing down to\nWooden Legs. Gervaise summoned Augustine and bade her bring some wine\nand then filled glasses for all the party, and each drank the health\nof the family.\n\n\"It is a good thing before soup,\" muttered Boche.\n\nMamma Coupeau drew Gervaise into the next room.\n\n\"Did you see her?\" she said eagerly. \"I was watching her, and when she\nsaw the table her face was as long as my arm, and now she is gnawing\nher lips; she is so mad!\"\n\nIt was true the Lorilleuxs could not stand that table with its white\nlinen, its shining glass and square piece of bread at each place. It\nwas like a restaurant on the boulevard, and Mme Lorilleux felt of the\ncloth stealthily to ascertain if it were new.\n\n\"We are all ready,\" cried Gervaise, reappearing and pulling down her\nsleeves over her white arms.\n\n\"Where can Coupeau be?\" she continued.\n\n\"He is always late! He always forgets!\" muttered his sister. Gervaise\nwas in despair. Everything would be spoiled. She proposed that someone\nshould go out and look for him. Goujet offered to go, and she said she\nwould accompany him. Virginie followed, all three bareheaded. Everyone\nlooked at them, so gay and fresh on a week-day. Virginie in her pink\nmuslin and Gervaise in a white cambric with blue spots and a gray silk\nhandkerchief knotted round her throat. They went to one wineshop after\nanother, but no Coupeau. Suddenly, as they went toward the boulevard,\nhis wife uttered an exclamation.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Goujet.\n\nThe clearstarcher was very pale and so much agitated that she could\nhardly stand. Virginie knew at once and, leaning over her, looked in\nat the restaurant and saw Lantier quietly dining.\n\n\"I turned my foot,\" said Gervaise when she could speak. Finally at the\nAssommoir they found Coupeau and Poisson. They were standing in the\ncenter of an excited crowd. Coupeau, in a gray blouse, was quarreling\nwith someone, and Poisson, who was not on duty that day, was listening\nquietly, his red mustache and imperial giving him, however, quite a\nformidable aspect.\n\nGoujet left the women outside and, going in, placed his hand on\nCoupeau's shoulder, who, when he saw his wife and Virginie, fell\ninto a great rage.\n\nNo, he would not move! He would not stand being followed about by\nwomen in this way! They might go home and eat their rubbishy dinner\nthemselves! He did not want any of it!\n\nTo appease him Goujet was compelled to drink with him, and finally\nhe persuaded him to go with him. But when he was outside he said to\nGervaise:\n\n\"I am not going home; you need not think it!\"\n\nShe did not reply. She was trembling from head to foot. She had been\nspeaking of Lantier to Virginie and begged the other to go on in\nfront, while the two women walked on either side of Coupeau to prevent\nhim from seeing Lantier as they passed the open window where he sat\neating his dinner.\n\nBut Coupeau knew that Lantier was there, for he said:\n\n\"There's a fellow I know, and you know him too!\"\n\nHe then went on to accuse her, with many a coarse word, of coming out\nto look, not for him, but for her old lover, and then all at once he\npoured out a torrent of abuse upon Lantier, who, however, never looked\nup or appeared to hear it.\n\nVirginie at last coaxed Coupeau on, whose rage disappeared when they\nturned the corner of the street. They returned to the shop, however,\nin a very different mood from the one in which they had left it and\nfound the guests, with very long faces, awaiting them.\n\nCoupeau shook hands with the ladies in succession, with difficulty\nkeeping his feet as he did so, and Gervaise, in a choked voice, begged\nthem to take their seats. But suddenly she perceived that Mme Goujet\nnot having come, there was an empty seat next to Mme Lorilleux.\n\n\"We are thirteen,\" she said, much disturbed, as she fancied this to be\nan additional proof of the misfortune which for some time she had felt\nto be hanging over them.\n\nThe ladies, who were seated, started up. Mme Putois offered to leave\nbecause, she said, no one should fly in the face of Destiny; besides,\nshe was not hungry. As to Boche, he laughed, and said it was all\nnonsense.\n\n\"Wait!\" cried Gervaise. \"I will arrange it.\"\n\nAnd rushing out on the sidewalk, she called to Father Bru, who was\ncrossing the street, and the old man followed her into the room.\n\n\"Sit there,\" said the clearstarcher. \"You are willing to dine with\nus, are you not?\"\n\nHe nodded acquiescence.\n\n\"He will do as well as another,\" she continued in a low voice. \"He\nrarely, if ever, had as much as he wanted to eat, and it will be a\npleasure to us to see him enjoy his dinner.\"\n\nGoujet's eyes were damp, so much was he touched by the kind way in\nwhich Gervaise spoke, and the others felt that it would bring them\ngood luck. Mme Lorilleux was the only one who seemed displeased. She\ndrew her skirts away and looked down with disgusted mien upon the\npatched blouse at her side.\n\nGervaise served the soup, and the guests were just lifting their\nspoons to their mouths when Virginie noticed that Coupeau had\ndisappeared. He had probably returned to the more congenial society at\nthe Assommoir, and someone said he might stay in the street; certainly\nno one would go after him, but just as they had swallowed the soup\nCoupeau appeared bearing two pots, one under each arm--a balsam and\na wallflower. All the guests clapped their hands. He placed them on\neither side of Gervaise and, kissing her, he said:\n\n\"I forgot you, my dear, but all the same I loved you very much.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Coupeau is very amiable tonight; he has taken just enough\nto make him good natured,\" whispered one of the guests.\n\nThis little act on the part of the host brought back the smiles to the\nfaces around the table. The wine began to circulate, and the voices of\nthe children were heard in the next room. Etienne, Nana, Pauline and\nlittle Victor Fauconnier were installed at a small table and were told\nto be very good.\n\nWhen the _blanquette du veau_ was served the guests were moved to\nenthusiasm. It was now half-past seven. The door of the shop was shut\nto keep out inquisitive eyes, and curtains hung before the windows.\nThe veal was a great success; the sauce was delicious and the\nmushrooms extraordinarily good. Then came the sparerib of pork.\nOf course all these good things demanded a large amount of wine.\n\nIn the next room at the children's table Nana was playing the mistress\nof the household. She was seated at the head of the table and for a\nwhile was quite dignified, but her natural gluttony made her forget\nher good manners when she saw Augustine stealing the peas from the\nplate, and she slapped the girl vehemently.\n\n\"Take care, mademoiselle,\" said Augustine sulkily, \"or I will tell\nyour mother that I heard you ask Victor to kiss you.\"\n\nNow was the time for the goose. Two lamps were placed on the table,\none at each end, and the disorder was very apparent: the cloth was\nstained and spotted. Gervaise left the table to reappear presently,\nbearing the goose in triumph. Lorilleux and his wife exchanged a look\nof dismay.\n\n\"Who will cut it?\" said the clearstarcher. \"No, not I. It is too big\nfor me to manage!\"\n\nCoupeau said he could do it. After all, it was a simple thing\nenough--he should just tear it to pieces.\n\nThere was a cry of dismay.\n\nMme Lerat had an inspiration.\n\n\"Monsieur Poisson is the man,\" she said; \"of course he understands the\nuse of arms.\" And she handed the sergeant the carving knife. Poisson\nmade a stiff inclination of his whole body and drew the dish toward\nhim and went to work in a slow, methodical fashion. As he thrust his\nknife into the breast Lorilleux was seized with momentary patriotism,\nand he exclaimed:\n\n\"If it were only a Cossack!\"\n\nAt last the goose was carved and distributed, and the whole party\nate as if they were just beginning their dinner. Presently there was\na grand outcry about the heat, and Coupeau opened the door into the\nstreet. Gervaise devoured large slices of the breast, hardly speaking,\nbut a little ashamed of her own gluttony in the presence of Goujet.\nShe never forgot old Bru, however, and gave him the choicest morsels,\nwhich he swallowed unconsciously, his palate having long since lost\nthe power of distinguishing flavors. Mamma Coupeau picked a bone with\nher two remaining teeth.\n\nAnd the wine! Good heavens, how much they drank! A pile of empty\nbottles stood in the corner. When Mme Putois asked for water Coupeau\nhimself removed the carafes from the table. No one should drink water,\nhe declared, in his house--did she want to swallow frogs and live\nthings?--and he filled up all the glasses. Hypocrites might talk as\nmuch as they pleased; the juice of the grape was a mighty good thing\nand a famous invention!\n\nThe guests all laughed and approved; working people must have their\nwine, they said, and Father Noah had planted the vine for them\nespecially. Wine gave courage and strength for work; and if it chanced\nthat a man sometimes took a drop too much, in the end it did him no\nharm, and life looked brighter to him for a time. Goujet himself, who\nwas usually so prudent and abstemious, was becoming a little excited.\nBoche was growing red, and the Lorilleux pair very pale, while Poisson\nassumed a solemn and severe aspect. The men were all more or less\ntipsy, and the ladies--well, the less we say of the ladies, the\nbetter.\n\nSuddenly Gervaise remembered the six bottles of sealed wine she had\nomitted to serve with the goose as she had intended. She produced them\namid much applause. The glasses were filled anew, and Poisson rose\nand proposed the health of their hostess.\n\n\"And fifty more birthdays!\" cried Virginie.\n\n\"No, no,\" answered Gervaise with a smile that had a touch of sadness\nin it. \"I do not care to live to be very old. There comes a time when\none is glad to go!\"\n\nA little crowd had collected outside and smiled at the scene, and\nthe smell of the goose pervaded the whole street. The clerks in the\ngrocery opposite licked their lips and said it was good and curiously\nestimated the amount of wine that had been consumed.\n\nNone of the guests were annoyed by being the subjects of observation,\nalthough they were fully aware of it and, in fact, rather enjoyed it.\nCoupeau, catching sight of a familiar face, held up a bottle, which,\nbeing accepted with a nod, he sent it out with a glass. This\nestablished a sort of fraternity with the street.\n\nIn the next room the children were unmanageable. They had taken\npossession of a saucepan and were drumming on it with spoons. Mamma\nCoupeau and Father Bru were talking earnestly. The old man was\nspeaking of his two sons who had died in the Crimea. Ah, had they\nbut lived, he would have had bread to eat in his old age!\n\nMme Coupeau, whose tongue was a little thick, said:\n\n\"Yes, but one has a good deal of unhappiness with children. Many an\nhour have I wept on account of mine.\"\n\nFather Bru hardly heard what she said but talked on, half to himself.\n\n\"I can't get any work to do. I am too old. When I ask for any people\nlaugh and ask if it was I who blacked Henri Quatre's boots. Last year\nI earned thirty sous by painting a bridge. I had to lie on my back\nall the time, close to the water, and since then I have coughed\nincessantly.\" He looked down at his poor stiff hands and added,\n\"I know I am good for nothing. I wish I was by the side of my boys.\nIt is a great pity that one can't kill one's self when one begins\nto grow old.\"\n\n\"Really,\" said Lorilleux, \"I cannot see why the government does not\ndo something for people in your condition. Men who are disabled--\"\n\n\"But workmen are not soldiers,\" interrupted Poisson, who considered\nit his duty to espouse the cause of the government. \"It is foolish\nto expect them to do impossibilities.\"\n\nThe dessert was served. In the center was a pyramid of spongecake\nin the form of a temple with melonlike sides, and on the top was an\nartificial rose with a butterfly of silver paper hovering over it,\nheld by a gilt wire. Two drops of gum in the heart of the rose stood\nfor dew. On the left was a deep plate with a bit of cheese, and on the\nother side of the pyramid was a dish of strawberries, which had been\nsugared and carefully crushed.\n\nIn the salad dish there were a few leaves of lettuce left.\n\n\"Madame Boche,\" said Gervaise courteously, \"pray eat these. I know\nhow fond you are of salad.\"\n\nThe concierge shook her head. There were limits even to her\ncapacities, and she looked at the lettuce with regret. Clemence told\nhow she had once eaten three quarts of water cresses at her breakfast.\nMme Putois declared that she enjoyed lettuce with a pinch of salt and\nno dressing, and as they talked the ladies emptied the salad bowl.\n\nNone of the guests were dismayed at the dessert, although they had\neaten so enormously. They had the night before them too; there was no\nneed of haste. The men lit their pipes and drank more wine while they\nwatched Gervaise cut the cake. Poisson, who prided himself on his\nknowledge of the habits of good society, rose and took the rose from\nthe top and presented it to the hostess amid the loud applause of the\nwhole party. She fastened it just over her heart, and the butterfly\nfluttered at every movement. A song was proposed--comic songs were a\nspecialty with Boche--and the whole party joined in the chorus. The\nmen kept time with their heels and the women with their knives on\ntheir glasses. The windows of the shop jarred with the noise. Virginie\nhad disappeared twice, and the third time, when she came back, she\nsaid to Gervaise:\n\n\"My dear, he is still at the restaurant and pretends to be reading\nhis paper. I fear he is meditating some mischief.\"\n\nShe spoke of Lantier. She had been out to see if he were anywhere\nin the vicinity. Gervaise became very grave.\n\n\"Is he tipsy?\" she asked.\n\n\"No indeed, and that is what troubled me. Why on earth should he stay\nthere so long if he is not drinking? My heart is in my mouth; I am so\nafraid something will happen.\"\n\nThe clearstarcher begged her to say no more. Mme Putois started up\nand began a fierce piratical song, standing stiff and erect in her\nblack dress, her pale face surrounded by her black lace cap, and\ngesticulating violently. Poisson nodded approval. He had been to sea,\nand he knew all about it.\n\nGervaise, assisted by her mother-in-law, now poured out the coffee.\nHer guests insisted on a song from her, declaring that it was her\nturn. She refused. Her face was disturbed and pale, so much so that\nshe was asked if the goose disagreed with her.\n\nFinally she began to sing a plaintive melody all about dreams and\nrest. Her eyelids half closed as she ended, and she peered out into\nthe darkness. Then followed a barcarole from Mme Boche and a romance\nfrom Lorilleux, in which figured perfumes of Araby, ivory throats,\nebony hair, kisses, moonlight and guitars! Clemence followed with\na song which recalled the country with its descriptions of birds\nand flowers. Virginie brought down the house with her imitation of\na vivandiere, standing with her hand on her hip and a wineglass in\nher hand, which she emptied down her throat as she finished.\n\nBut the grand success of the evening was Goujet, who sang in his\nrich bass the _\"Adieux d'Abd-et-Kader.\"_ The words issued from his\nyellow beard like the call of a trumpet and thrilled everyone around\nthe table.\n\nVirginie whispered to Gervaise:\n\n\"I have just seen Lantier pass the door. Good heavens! There he is\nagain, standing still and looking in.\"\n\nGervaise caught her breath and timidly turned around. The crowd had\nincreased, attracted by the songs. There were soldiers and shopkeepers\nand three little girls, five or six years old, holding each other by\nthe hand, grave and silent, struck with wonder and admiration.\n\nLantier was directly in front of the door. Gervaise met his eyes and\nfelt the very marrow of her bones chilled; she could not move hand\nor foot.\n\nCoupeau called for more wine, and Clemence helped herself to more\nstrawberries. The singing ceased, and the conversation turned upon\na woman who had hanged herself the day before in the next street.\n\nIt was now Mme Lerat's turn to amuse the company, but she needed to\nmake certain preparations.\n\nShe dipped the corner of her napkin into a glass of water and applied\nit to her temples because she was too warm. Then she asked for a\nteaspoonful of brandy and wiped her lips.\n\n\"I will sing _'L'Enfant du Bon Dieu,'_\" she said pompously.\n\nShe stood up, with her square shoulders like those of a man, and\nbegan:\n\n _\"L'Enfant perdu que sa mere abandonne,\n   Troue toujours un asile au Saint lieu,\n   Dieu qui le voit, le defend de son trone,\n   L'Enfant perdu, c'est L'Enfant du bon Dieu.\"_\n\nShe raised her eyes to heaven and placed one hand on her heart; her\nvoice was not without a certain sympathetic quality, and Gervaise,\nalready quivering with emotion caused by the knowledge of Lantier's\npresence, could no longer restrain her tears. It seemed to her that\nshe was the deserted child whom _le bon Dieu_ had taken under His\ncare. Clemence, who was quite tipsy, burst into loud sobs. The ladies\ntook out their handkerchiefs and pressed them to their eyes, rather\nproud of their tenderness of heart.\n\nThe men felt it their duty to respect the feeling shown by the women\nand were, in fact, somewhat touched themselves. The wine had softened\ntheir hearts apparently.\n\nGervaise and Virginie watched the shadows outside. Mme Boche, in her\nturn, now caught a glimpse of Lantier and uttered an exclamation as\nshe wiped away her fast-falling tears. The three women exchanged\nterrified, anxious glances.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" muttered Virginie. \"Suppose Coupeau should turn\naround. There would be a murder, I am convinced.\" And the earnestness\nof their fixed eyes became so apparent that finally he said:\n\n\"What are you staring at?\"\n\nAnd leaning forward, he, too, saw Lantier.\n\n\"This is too much,\" he muttered, \"the dirty ruffian! It is too much,\nand I won't have it!\"\n\nAs he started to his feet with an oath, Gervaise put her hand on his\narm imploringly.\n\n\"Put down that knife,\" she said, \"and do not go out, I entreat of\nyou.\"\n\nVirginie took away the knife that Coupeau had snatched from the table,\nbut she could not prevent him from going into the street. The other\nguests saw nothing, so entirely absorbed were they in the touching\nwords which Mme Lerat was still singing.\n\nGervaise sat with her hands clasped convulsively, breathless with\nfear, expecting to hear a cry of rage from the street and see one of\nthe two men fall to the ground. Virginie and Mme Boche had something\nof the same feeling. Coupeau had been so overcome by the fresh air\nthat when he rushed forward to take Lantier by the collar he missed\nhis footing and found himself seated quietly in the gutter.\n\nLantier moved aside a little without taking his hands from his\npockets.\n\nCoupeau staggered to his feet again, and a violent quarrel commenced.\nGervaise pressed her hands over her eyes; suddenly all was quiet, and\nshe opened her eyes again and looked out.\n\nTo her intense astonishment she saw Lantier and her husband talking\nin a quiet, friendly manner.\n\nGervaise exchanged a look with Mme Boche and Virginie. What did this\nmean?\n\nAs the women watched them the two men began to walk up and down in\nfront of the shop. They were talking earnestly. Coupeau seemed to be\nurging something, and Lantier refusing. Finally Coupeau took Lantier's\narm and almost dragged him toward the shop.\n\n\"I tell you, you must!\" he cried. \"You shall drink a glass of wine\nwith us. Men will be men all the world over. My wife and I know that\nperfectly well.\"\n\nMme Lerat had finished her song and seated herself with the air of\nbeing utterly exhausted. She asked for a glass of wine. When she sang\nthat song, she said, she was always torn to pieces, and it left her\nnerves in a terrible state.\n\nLantier had been placed at the table by Coupeau and was eating a\npiece of cake, leisurely dipping it into his glass of wine. With\nthe exception of Mme Boche and Virginie, no one knew him.\n\nThe Lorilleuxs looked at him with some suspicion, which, however,\nwas very far from the mark. An awkward silence followed, broken by\nCoupeau, who said simply:\n\n\"He is a friend of ours!\"\n\nAnd turning to his wife, he added:\n\n\"Can't you move round a little? Perhaps there is a cup of hot coffee!\"\n\nGervaise looked from one to the other. She was literally dazed. When\nher husband first appeared with her former lover she had clasped her\nhands over her forehead with that instinctive gesture with which in\na great storm one waits for the approach of the thunderclap.\n\nIt did not seem possible that the walls would not fall and crush them\nall. Then seeing the two men calmly seated together, it all at once\nseemed perfectly natural to her. She was tired of thinking about it\nand preferred to accept it. Why, after all, should she worry? No one\nelse did. Everyone seemed to be satisfied; why should not she be also?\n\nThe children had fallen asleep in the back room, Pauline with her head\non Etienne's shoulder. Gervaise started as her eyes fell on her boy.\nShe was shocked at the thought of his father sitting there eating cake\nwithout showing the least desire to see his child. She longed to\nawaken him and show him to Lantier. And then again she had a feeling\nof passing wonder at the manner in which things settled themselves\nin this world.\n\nShe would not disturb the serenity of matters now, so she brought\nin the coffeepot and poured out a cup for Lantier, who received it\nwithout even looking up at her as he murmured his thanks.\n\n\"Now it is my turn to sing!\" shouted Coupeau.\n\nHis song was one familiar to them all and even to the street, for the\nlittle crowd at the door joined in the chorus. The guests within were\nall more or less tipsy, and there was so much noise that the policemen\nran to quell a riot, but when they saw Poisson they bowed respectfully\nand passed on.\n\nNo one of the party ever knew how or at what hour the festivities\nterminated. It must have been very late, for there was not a human\nbeing in the street when they departed. They vaguely remembered having\njoined hands and danced around the table. Gervaise remembered that\nLantier was the last to leave, that he passed her as she stood in the\ndoorway. She felt a breath on her cheek, but whether it was his or the\nnight air she could not tell.\n\nMme Lerat had refused to return to Batignolles so late, and a mattress\nwas laid on the floor in the shop near the table. She slept there amid\nthe debris of the feast, and a neighbor's cat profited by an open\nwindow to establish herself by her side, where she crunched the bones\nof the goose all night between her fine, sharp teeth.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nAN OLD ACQUAINTANCE\n\nThe following Saturday Coupeau, who had not been home to dinner, came\nin with Lantier about ten o'clock. They had been eating pigs' feet at\na restaurant at Montmarte.\n\n\"Don't scold, wife,\" said Coupeau; \"we have not been drinking, you\nsee; we can walk perfectly straight.\" And he went on to say how they\nhad met each other quite by accident in the street and how Lantier had\nrefused to drink with him, saying that when a man had married a nice\nlittle woman he had no business to throw away his money in that way.\nGervaise listened with a faint smile; she had no idea of scolding. Oh\nno, it was not worth the trouble, but she was much agitated at seeing\nthe two men together so soon again, and with trembling hands she\nknotted up her loosened hair.\n\nHer workwomen had been gone some time. Nana and Mamma Coupeau were in\nbed, and Gervaise, who was just closing her shutters when her husband\nappeared, brought out some glasses and the remains of a bottle of\nbrandy. Lantier did not sit down and avoided addressing her directly.\n\nWhen she served him, however, he exclaimed:\n\n\"A drop, madame; a mere drop!\"\n\nCoupeau looked at them for a moment and then expressed his mind fully.\nThey were no fools, he said, nor were they children. The past was the\npast. If people kept up their enmities for nine or ten years no one\nwould have a soul to speak to soon. As for himself, he was made\ndifferently. He knew they were honest people, and he was sure he\ncould trust them.\n\n\"Of course,\" murmured Gervaise, hardly knowing what she said, \"of\ncourse.\"\n\n\"I regard her as a sister,\" said Lantier, \"only as a sister.\"\n\n\"Give us your hand on that,\" cried Coupeau, \"and let us be good\nfriends in the future. After all, a good heart is better than gold,\nand I estimate friendship as above all price.\"\n\nAnd he gave himself a little tap on his breast and looked about for\napplause, as if he had uttered rather a noble sentiment.\n\nThen the three silently drank their brandy. Gervaise looked at Lantier\nand saw him for the first time, for on the night of the fete she had\nseen him, as it were, through a glass, darkly.\n\nHe had grown very stout, and his arms and legs very heavy. But his\nface was still handsome, although somewhat bloated by liquor and good\nliving. He was dressed with care and did not look any older than his\nyears. He was thirty-five. He wore gray pantaloons and a dark blue\nfrock coat, like any gentleman, and had a watch and a chain on which\nhung a ring--a souvenir, apparently.\n\n\"I must go,\" he said presently.\n\nHe was at the door when Coupeau recalled him to say that he must never\npass without coming in to say, \"How do you do?\"\n\nMeanwhile Gervaise, who had disappeared, returned, pushing Etienne\nbefore her. The boy was half asleep but smiled as he rubbed his eyes.\nWhen he saw Lantier he stared and looked uneasily from him to Coupeau.\n\n\"Do you know this gentleman?\" said his mother.\n\nThe child looked away and did not answer, but when his mother repeated\nthe question he made a little sign that he remembered him. Lantier,\ngrave and silent, stood still. When Etienne went toward him he stooped\nand kissed the child, who did not look at him but burst into tears,\nand when he was violently reproached by Coupeau he rushed away.\n\n\"It is excitement,\" said his mother, who was herself very pale.\n\n\"He is usually very good and very obedient,\" said Coupeau. \"I have\nbrought him up well, as you will find out. He will soon get used to\nyou. He must learn something of life, you see, and will understand one\nof these days that people must forget and forgive, and I would cut off\nmy head sooner than prevent a father from seeing his child!\"\n\nHe then proposed to finish the bottle of brandy. They all three drank\ntogether again. Lantier was quite undisturbed, and before he left he\ninsisted on aiding Coupeau to shut up the shop. Then as he dusted his\nhands with his handkerchief he wished them a careless good night.\n\n\"Sleep well. I am going to try and catch the omnibus. I will see you\nsoon again.\"\n\nLantier kept his word and was seen from that time very often in the\nshop. He came only when Coupeau was home and asked for him before he\ncrossed the threshold. Then seated near the window, always wearing\na frock coat, fresh linen and carefully shaved, he kept up a\nconversation like a man who had seen something of the world. By\ndegrees Coupeau learned something of his life. For the last eight\nyears he had been at the head of a hat manufactory, and when he was\nasked why he had given it up he said vaguely that he was not satisfied\nwith his partner; he was a rascal, and so on.\n\nBut his former position still imparted to him a certain air of\nimportance. He said, also, that he was on the point of concluding\nan important matter--that certain business houses were in process of\nestablishing themselves, the management of which would be virtually\nin his hands. In the meantime he had absolutely not one thing to do\nbut to walk about with his hands in his pockets.\n\nAny day he pleased, however, he could start again. He had only to\ndecide on some house. Coupeau did not altogether believe this tale\nand insisted that he must be doing something which he did not choose\nto tell; otherwise how did he live?\n\nThe truth was that Lantier, excessively talkative in regard to other\npeople's affairs, was very reticent about his own. He lied quite as\noften as he spoke the truth and would never tell where he resided.\nHe said he was never at home, so it was of no use for anyone to come\nand see him.\n\n\"I am very careful,\" he said, \"in making an engagement. I do not\nchoose to bind myself to a man and find, when it is too late, that\nhe intends to make a slave of me. I went one Monday to Champion at\nMonrouge. That evening Champion began a political discussion. He and I\ndiffered entirely, and on Tuesday I threw up the situation. You can't\nblame me, I am sure, for not being willing to sell my soul and my\nconvictions for seven francs per day!\"\n\nIt was now November. Lantier occasionally brought a bunch of violets\nto Gervaise. By degrees his visits became more frequent. He seemed\ndetermined to fascinate the whole house, even the _Quartier_, and\nhe began by ingratiating himself with Clemence and Mme Putois, showing\nthem both the greatest possible attention.\n\nThese two women adored him at the end of a month. Mme Boche, whom he\nflattered by calling on her in her loge, had all sorts of pleasant\nthings to say about him.\n\nAs to the Lorilleuxs, they were furious when they found out who he was\nand declared that it was a sin and a disgrace for Gervaise to bring\nhim into her house. But one fine day Lantier bearded them in their\nden and ordered a chain made for a lady of his acquaintance and made\nhimself so agreeable that they begged him to sit down and kept him an\nhour. After this visit they expressed their astonishment that a man so\ndistinguished could ever have seen anything in Wooden Legs to admire.\nBy degrees, therefore, people had become accustomed to seeing him and\nno longer expressed their horror or amazement. Goujet was the only one\nwho was disturbed. If Lantier came in while he was there he at once\ndeparted and avoided all intercourse with him.\n\nGervaise was very unhappy. She was conscious of a returning\ninclination for Lantier, and she was afraid of herself and of him.\nShe thought of him constantly; he had taken entire possession of her\nimagination. But she grew calmer as days passed on, finding that he\nnever tried to see her alone and that he rarely looked at her and\nnever laid the tip of his finger on her.\n\nVirginie, who seemed to read her through and through, asked her what\nshe feared. Was there ever a man more respectful?\n\nBut out of mischief or worse, the woman contrived to get the two into\na corner one day and then led the conversation into a most dangerous\ndirection. Lantier, in reply to some question, said in measured tones\nthat his heart was dead, that he lived now only for his son. He never\nthought of Claude, who was away. He embraced Etienne every night but\nsoon forgot he was in the room and amused himself with Clemence.\n\nThen Gervaise began to realize that the past was dead. Lantier had\nbrought back to her the memory of Plassans and the Hotel Boncoeur.\nBut this faded away again, and, seeing him constantly, the past was\nabsorbed in the present. She shook off these memories almost with\ndisgust. Yes, it was all over, and should he ever dare to allude to\nformer years she would complain to her husband.\n\nShe began again to think of Goujet almost unconsciously.\n\nOne morning Clemence said that the night before she had seen Lantier\nwalking with a woman who had his arm. Yes, he was coming up La Rue\nNotre-Dame de Lorette; the woman was a blonde and no better than she\nshould be. Clemence added that she had followed them until the woman\nreached a house where she went in. Lantier waited in the street until\nthere was a window opened, which was evidently a signal, for he went\ninto the house at once.\n\nGervaise was ironing a white dress; she smiled slightly and said that\nshe believed a Provencal was always crazy after women, and at night\nwhen Lantier appeared she was quite amused at Clemence, who at once\nattacked him. He seemed to be, on the whole, rather pleased that he\nhad been seen. The person was an old friend, he said, one whom he had\nnot seen for some time--a very stylish woman, in fact--and he told\nClemence to smell of his handkerchief on which his friend had put some\nof the perfume she used. Just then Etienne came in, and his father\nbecame very grave and said that he was in jest--that his heart was\ndead.\n\nGervaise nodded approval of this sentiment, but she did not speak.\n\nWhen spring came Lantier began to talk of moving into that\nneighborhood. He wanted a furnished, clean room. Mme Boche and\nGervaise tried to find one for him. But they did not meet with any\nsuccess. He was altogether too fastidious in his requirements. Every\nevening at the Coupeaus' he wished he could find people like\nthemselves who would take a lodger.\n\n\"You are very comfortable here, I am sure,\" he would say regularly.\n\nFinally one night when he had uttered this phrase, as usual, Coupeau\ncried out:\n\n\"If you like this place so much why don't you stay here? We can make\nroom for you.\"\n\nAnd he explained that the linen room could be so arranged that it\nwould be very comfortable, and Etienne could sleep on a mattress in\nthe corner.\n\n\"No, no,\" said Lantier; \"it would trouble you too much. I know that\nyou have the most generous heart in the world, but I cannot impose\nupon you. Your room would be a passageway to mine, and that would not\nbe agreeable to any of us.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said Coupeau. \"Have we no invention? There are two\nwindows; can't one be cut down to the floor and used as a door? In\nthat case you would enter from the court and not through the shop.\nYou would be by yourself, and we by ourselves.\"\n\nThere was a long silence, broken finally by Lantier.\n\n\"If this could be done,\" he said, \"I should like it, but I am afraid\nyou would find yourselves too crowded.\"\n\nHe did not look at Gervaise as he spoke, but it was clear that he was\nonly waiting for a word from her. She did not like the plan at all;\nnot that the thought of Lantier living under their roof disturbed her,\nbut she had no idea where she could put the linen as it came in to be\nwashed and again when it was rough-dry.\n\nBut Coupeau was enchanted with the plan. The rent, he said, had always\nbeen heavy to carry, and now they would gain twenty francs per month.\nIt was not dear for him, and it would help them decidedly. He told his\nwife that she could have two great boxes made in which all the linen\nof the _Quartier_ could be piled.\n\nGervaise still hesitated, questioning Mamma Coupeau with her eyes.\nLantier had long since propitiated the old lady by bringing her\ngumdrops for her cough.\n\n\"If we could arrange it I am sure--\" said Gervaise hesitatingly.\n\n\"You are too kind,\" remonstrated Lantier. \"I really feel that it would\nbe an intrusion.\"\n\nCoupeau flamed out. Why did she not speak up, he should like to know?\nInstead of stammering and behaving like a fool?\n\n\"Etienne! Etienne!\" he shouted.\n\nThe boy was asleep with his head on the table. He started up.\n\n\"Listen to me. Say to this gentleman, 'I wish it.' Say just those\nwords and nothing more.\"\n\n\"I wish it!\" stammered Etienne, half asleep.\n\nEverybody laughed. But Lantier almost instantly resumed his solemn\nair. He pressed Coupeau's hand cordially.\n\n\"I accept your proposition,\" he said. \"It is a most friendly one,\nand I thank you in my name and in that of my child.\"\n\nThe next morning Marescot, the owner of the house, happening to call,\nGervaise spoke to him of the matter. At first he absolutely refused\nand was as disturbed and angry as if she had asked him to build on a\nwing for her especial accommodation. Then after a minute examination\nof the premises he ended by giving his consent, only on condition,\nhowever, that he should not be required to pay any portion of the\nexpense, and the Coupeaus signed a paper, agreeing to put everything\ninto its original condition at the expiration of their lease.\n\nThat same evening Coupeau brought in a mason, a painter and a\ncarpenter, all friends and boon companions of his, who would do this\nlittle job at night, after their day's work was over.\n\nThe cutting of the door, the painting and the cleaning would come to\nabout one hundred francs, and Coupeau agreed to pay them as fast as\nhis tenant paid him.\n\nThe next question was how to furnish the room? Gervaise left Mamma\nCoupeau's wardrobe in it. She added a table and two chairs from her\nown room. She was compelled to buy a bed and dressing table and divers\nother things, which amounted to one hundred and thirty francs. This\nshe must pay for ten francs each month. So that for nearly a year they\ncould derive no benefit from their new lodger.\n\nIt was early in June that Lantier took possession of his new quarters.\nCoupeau had offered the night before to help him with his trunk in\norder to avoid the thirty sous for a fiacre. But the other seemed\nembarrassed and said his trunk was heavy, and it seemed as if he\npreferred to keep it a secret even now where he resided.\n\nHe came about three o'clock. Coupeau was not there, and Gervaise,\nstanding at her shop door, turned white as she recognized the trunk\non the fiacre. It was their old one with which they had traveled from\nPlassans. Now it was banged and battered and strapped with cords.\n\nShe saw it brought in as she had often seen it in her dreams, and she\nvaguely wondered if it were the same fiacre which had taken him and\nAdele away. Boche welcomed Lantier cordially. Gervaise stood by in\nsilent bewilderment, watching them place the trunk in her lodger's\nroom. Then hardly knowing what she said, she murmured:\n\n\"We must take a glass of wine together----\"\n\nLantier, who was busy untying the cords on his trunk, did not look up,\nand she added:\n\n\"You will join us, Monsieur Boche!\"\n\nAnd she went for some wine and glasses. At that moment she caught\nsight of Poisson passing the door. She gave him a nod and a wink which\nhe perfectly understood: it meant, when he was on duty, that he was\noffered a glass of wine. He went round by the courtyard in order not\nto be seen. Lantier never saw him without some joke in regard to his\npolitical convictions, which, however, had not prevented the men from\nbecoming excellent friends.\n\nTo one of these jests Boche now replied:\n\n\"Did you know,\" he said, \"that when the emperor was in London he was a\npoliceman, and his special duty was to carry all the intoxicated women\nto the station house?\"\n\nGervaise had filled three glasses on the table. She did not care\nfor any wine; she was sick at heart as she stood looking at Lantier\nkneeling on the floor by the side of the trunk. She was wild to know\nwhat it contained. She remembered that in one corner was a pile of\nstockings, a shirt or two and an old hat. Were those things still\nthere? Was she to be confronted with those tattered relics of the\npast?\n\nLantier did not lift the lid, however; he rose and, going to the\ntable, held his glass high in his hands.\n\n\"To your health, madame!\" he said.\n\nAnd Poisson and Boche drank with him.\n\nGervaise filled their glasses again. The three men wiped their lips\nwith the backs of their hands.\n\nThen Lantier opened his trunk. It was filled with a hodgepodge of\npapers, books, old clothes and bundles of linen. He pulled out a\nsaucepan, then a pair of boots, followed by a bust of Ledru Rollin\nwith a broken nose, then an embroidered shirt and a pair of ragged\npantaloons, and Gervaise perceived a mingled and odious smell of\ntobacco, leather and dust.\n\nNo, the old hat was not in the left corner; in its place was a pin\ncushion, the gift of some woman. All at once the strange anxiety with\nwhich she had watched the opening of this trunk disappeared, and in\nits place came an intense sadness as she followed each article with\nher eyes as Lantier took them out and wondered which belonged to her\ntime and which to the days when another woman filled his life.\n\n\"Look here, Poisson,\" cried Lantier, pulling out a small book. It\nwas a scurrilous attack on the emperor, printed at Brussels, entitled\n_The Amours of Napoleon III_.\n\nPoisson was aghast. He found no words with which to defend the\nemperor. It was in a book--of course, therefore, it was true. Lantier,\nwith a laugh of triumph, turned away and began to pile up his books\nand papers, grumbling a little that there were no shelves on which\nto put them. Gervaise promised to buy some for him. He owned Louis\nBlanc's _Histoire de Dix Ans_, all but the first volume, which he\nhad never had, Lamartine's _Les Girondins_, _The Mysteries of\nParis_ and _The Wandering Jew_, by Eugene Sue, without counting\na pile of incendiary volumes which he had picked up at bookstalls.\nHis old newspapers he regarded with especial respect. He had collected\nthem with care for years: whenever he had read an article at a cafe\nof which he approved, he bought the journal and preserved it. He\nconsequently had an enormous quantity, of all dates and names, tied\ntogether without order or sequence.\n\nHe laid them all in a corner of the room, saying as he did so:\n\n\"If people would study those sheets and adopt the ideas therein,\nsociety would be far better organized than it now is. Your emperor\nand all his minions would come down a bit on the ladder--\"\n\nHere he was interrupted by Poisson, whose red imperial and mustache\nirradiated his pale face.\n\n\"And the army,\" he said, \"what would you do with that?\"\n\nLantier became very much excited.\n\n\"The army!\" he cried. \"I would scatter it to the four winds of\nheaven! I want the military system of the country abolished! I want\nthe abolition of titles and monopolies! I want salaries equalized!\nI want liberty for everyone. Divorces, too--\"\n\n\"Yes; divorces, of course,\" interposed Boche. \"That is needed in the\ncause of morality.\"\n\nPoisson threw back his head, ready for an argument, but Gervaise,\nwho did not like discussions, interfered. She had recovered from the\ntorpor into which she had been plunged by the sight of this trunk, and\nshe asked the men to take another glass. Lantier was suddenly subdued\nand drank his wine, but Boche looked at Poisson uneasily.\n\n\"All this talk is between ourselves, is it not?\" he said to the\npoliceman.\n\nPoisson did not allow him to finish: he laid his hand on his heart\nand declared that he was no spy. Their words went in at one ear and\nout at another. He had forgotten them already.\n\nCoupeau by this time appeared, and more wine was sent for. But Poisson\ndared linger no longer, and, stiff and haughty, he departed through\nthe courtyard.\n\nFrom the very first Lantier was made thoroughly at home. Lantier had\nhis separate room, private entrance and key. But he went through the\nshop almost always. The accumulation of linen disturbed Gervaise, for\nher husband never arranged the boxes he had promised, and she was\nobliged to stow it away in all sorts of places, under the bed and in\nthe corner. She did not like making up Etienne's mattress late at\nnight either.\n\nGoujet had spoken of sending the child to Lille to his own old master,\nwho wanted apprentices. The plan pleased her, particularly as the\nboy, who was not very happy at home, was impatient to become his own\nmaster. But she dared not ask Lantier, who had come there to live\nostensibly to be near his son. She felt, therefore, that it was hardly\na good plan to send the boy away within a couple of weeks after his\nfather's arrival.\n\nWhen, however, she did make up her mind to approach the subject he\nexpressed warm approval of the idea, saying that youths were far\nbetter in the country than in Paris.\n\nFinally it was decided that Etienne should go, and when the morning\nof his departure arrived Lantier read his son a long lecture and then\nsent him off, and the house settled down into new habits.\n\nGervaise became accustomed to seeing the dirty linen lying about and\nto seeing Lantier coming in and going out. He still talked with an\nimportant air of his business operations. He went out daily, dressed\nwith the utmost care and came home, declaring that he was worn out\nwith the discussions in which he had been engaged and which involved\nthe gravest and most important interests.\n\nHe rose about ten o'clock, took a walk if the day pleased him, and if\nit rained he sat in the shop and read his paper. He liked to be there.\nIt was his delight to live surrounded by a circle of worshiping women,\nand he basked indolently in the warmth and atmosphere of ease and\ncomfort, which characterized the place.\n\nAt first Lantier took his meals at the restaurant at the corner, but\nafter a while he dined three or four times a week with the Coupeaus\nand finally requested permission to board with them and agreed to pay\nthem fifteen francs each Saturday. Thus he was regularly installed and\nwas one of the family. He was seen in his shirt sleeves in the shop\nevery morning, attending to any little matters or receiving orders\nfrom the customers. He induced Gervaise to leave her own wine merchant\nand go to a friend of his own. Then he found fault with the bread and\nsent Augustine to the Vienna bakery in a distant _faubourg_. He\nchanged the grocer but kept the butcher on account of his political\nopinions.\n\nAt the end of a month he had instituted a change in the cuisine.\nEverything was cooked in oil: being a Provencal, that was what he\nadored. He made the omelets himself, which were as tough as leather.\nHe superintended Mamma Coupeau and insisted that the beefsteaks should\nbe thoroughly cooked, until they were like the soles of an old shoe.\nHe watched the salad to see that nothing went in which he did not\nlike. His favorite dish was vermicelli, into which he poured half\na bottle of oil. This he and Gervaise ate together, for the others,\nbeing Parisians, could not be induced to taste it.\n\nBy degrees Lantier attended to all those affairs which fall to the\nshare of the master of the house and to various details of their\nbusiness, in addition. He insisted that if the five francs which the\nLorilleux people had agreed to pay toward the support of Mamma Coupeau\nwas not forthcoming they should go to law about it. In fact, ten\nfrancs was what they ought to pay. He himself would go and see if he\ncould not make them agree to that. He went up at once and asked them\nin such a way that he returned in triumph with the ten francs. And\nMme Lerat, too, did the same at his representation. Mamma Coupeau\ncould have kissed Lantier's hands, who played the part, besides, of\nan arbiter in the quarrels between the old woman and Gervaise.\n\nThe latter, as was natural, sometimes lost patience with the old\nwoman, who retreated to her bed to weep. He would bluster about and\nask if they were simpletons, to amuse people with their disagreements,\nand finally induced them to kiss and be friends once more.\n\nHe expressed his mind freely in regard to Nana also. In his opinion\nshe was brought up very badly, and here he was quite right, for when\nher father cuffed her her mother upheld her, and when, in her turn,\nthe mother reproved, the father made a scene.\n\nNana was delighted at this and felt herself free to do much as she\npleased.\n\nShe had started a new game at the farriery opposite. She spent entire\ndays swinging on the shafts of the wagons. She concealed herself, with\nher troop of followers, at the back of the dark court, redly lit by\nthe forge, and then would make sudden rushes with screams and whoops,\nfollowed by every child in the neighborhood, reminding one of a flock\nof martins or sparrows.\n\nLantier was the only one whose scoldings had any effect. She listened\nto him graciously. This child of ten years of age, precocious and\nvicious, coquetted with him as if she had been a grown woman. He\nfinally assumed the care of her education. He taught her to dance\nand to talk slang!\n\nThus a year passed away. The whole neighborhood supposed Lantier to\nbe a man of means--otherwise how did the Coupeaus live as they did?\nGervaise, to be sure, still made money, but she supported two men who\ndid nothing, and the shop, of course, did not make enough for that.\nThe truth was that Lantier had never paid one sou, either for board\nor lodging. He said he would let it run on, and when it amounted to\na good sum he would pay it all at once.\n\nAfter that Gervaise never dared to ask him for a centime. She got\nbread, wine and meat on credit; bills were running up everywhere, for\ntheir expenditures amounted to three and four francs every day. She\nhad never paid anything, even a trifle on account, to the man from\nwhom she had bought her furniture or to Coupeau's three friends who\nhad done the work in Lantier's room. The tradespeople were beginning\nto grumble and treated her with less politeness.\n\nBut she seemed to be insensible to this; she chose the most expensive\nthings, having thrown economy to the winds, since she had given up\npaying for things at once. She always intended, however, to pay\neventually and had a vague notion of earning hundreds of francs daily\nin some extraordinary way by which she could pay all these people.\n\nAbout the middle of summer Clemence departed, for there was not enough\nwork for two women; she had waited for her money for some weeks.\nLantier and Coupeau were quite undisturbed, however. They were in the\nbest of spirits and seemed to be growing fat over the ruined business.\n\nIn the _Quartier_ there was a vast deal of gossip. Everybody\nwondered as to the terms on which Lantier and Gervaise now stood. The\nLorilleuxs viciously declared that Gervaise would be glad enough to\nresume her old relations with Lantier but that he would have nothing\nto do with her, for she had grown old and ugly. The Boche people\ntook a different view, but while everyone declared that the whole\narrangement was a most improper one, they finally accepted it as\nquite a matter of course and altogether natural.\n\nIt is quite possible there were other homes which were quite as open\nto invidious remarks within a stone's throw, but these Coupeaus, as\ntheir neighbors said, were good, kind people. Lantier was especially\ningratiating. It was decided, therefore, to let things go their own\nway undisturbed.\n\nGervaise lived quietly indifferent to, and possibly entirely\nunsuspicious of, all these scandals. By and by it came to pass that\nher husband's own people looked on her as utterly heartless. Mme Lerat\nmade her appearance every evening, and she treated Lantier as if he\nwere utterly irresistible, into whose arms any and every woman would\nbe only too glad to fall. An actual league seemed to be forming\nagainst Gervaise: all the women insisted on giving her a lover.\n\nBut she saw none of these fascinations in him. He had changed,\nunquestionably, and the external changes were all in his favor. He\nwore a frock coat and had acquired a certain polish. But she who knew\nhim so well looked down into his soul through his eyes and shuddered\nat much she saw there. She could not understand what others saw in him\nto admire. And she said so one day to Virginie. Then Mme Lerat and\nVirginie vied with each other in the stories they told of Clemence and\nhimself--what they did and said whenever her back was turned--and now\nthey were sure, since she had left the establishment, that he went\nregularly to see her.\n\n\"Well, what of it?\" asked Gervaise, her voice trembling. \"What have\nI to do with that?\"\n\nBut she looked into Virginie's dark brown eyes, which were specked\nwith gold and emitted sparks as do those of cats. But the woman put\non a stupid look as she answered:\n\n\"Why, nothing, of course; only I should think you would advise him\nnot to have anything to do with such a person.\"\n\nLantier was gradually changing his manner to Gervaise. Now when he\nshook hands with her he held her fingers longer than was necessary.\nHe watched her incessantly and fixed his bold eyes upon her. He leaned\nover her so closely that she felt his breath on her cheek. But one\nevening, being alone with her, he caught her in both arms. At that\nmoment Goujet entered. Gervaise wrenched herself free, and the three\nexchanged a few words as if nothing had happened. Goujet was very pale\nand seemed embarrassed, supposing that he had intruded upon them and\nthat she had pushed Lantier aside only because she did not choose to\nbe embraced in public.\n\nThe next day Gervaise was miserable, unhappy and restless. She could\nnot iron a handkerchief. She wanted to see Goujet and tell him just\nwhat had happened, but ever since Etienne had gone to Lille she had\ngiven up going to the forge, as she was quite unable to face the\nknowing winks with which his comrades received her. But this day she\ndetermined to go, and, taking an empty basket on her arms, she started\noff, pretending that she was going with skirts to some customers in\nLa Rue des Portes-Blanches.\n\nGoujet seemed to be expecting her, for she met him loitering on the\ncorner.\n\n\"Ah,\" he said with a wan smile, \"you are going home, I presume?\"\n\nHe hardly knew what he was saying, and they both turned toward\nMontmartre without another word. They merely wished to go away from\nthe forge. They passed several manufactories and soon found themselves\nwith an open field before them. A goat was tethered near by and\nbleating as it browsed, and a dead tree was crumbling away in the\nhot sun.\n\n\"One might almost think oneself in the country,\" murmured Gervaise.\n\nThey took a seat under the dead tree. The clearstarcher set the basket\ndown at her feet. Before them stretched the heights of Montmartre,\nwith its rows of yellow and gray houses amid clumps of trees, and\nwhen they threw back their heads a little they saw the whole sky\nabove, clear and cloudless, but the sunlight dazzled them, and they\nlooked over to the misty outlines of the _faubourg_ and watched the\nsmoke rising from tall chimneys in regular puffs, indicating the\nmachinery which impelled it. These great sighs seemed to relieve\ntheir own oppressed breasts.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Gervaise after a long silence. \"I have been on a long\nwalk, and I came out--\"\n\nShe stopped. After having been so eager for an explanation she found\nherself unable to speak and overwhelmed with shame. She knew that he\nas well as herself had come to that place with the wish and intention\nof speaking on one especial subject, and yet neither of them dared to\nallude to it. The occurrence of the previous evening weighed on both\ntheir souls.\n\nThen with a heart torn with anguish and with tears in her eyes, she\ntold him of the death of Mme Bijard, who had breathed her last that\nmorning after suffering unheard-of agonies.\n\n\"It was caused by a kick of Bijard's,\" she said in her low, soft\nvoice; \"some internal injury. For three days she has suffered\nfrightfully. Why are not such men punished? I suppose, though, if the\nlaw undertook to punish all the wretches who kill their wives that it\nwould have too much to do. After all, one kick more or less: what does\nit matter in the end? And this poor creature, in her desire to save\nher husband from the scaffold, declared she had fallen over a tub.\"\n\nGoujet did not speak. He sat pulling up the tufts of grass.\n\n\"It is not a fortnight,\" continued Gervaise, \"since she weaned her\nlast baby, and here is that child Lalie left to take care of two\nmites. She is not eight years old but as quiet and sensible as if\nshe were a grown woman, and her father kicks and strikes her too.\nPoor little soul! There are some persons in this world who seem\nborn to suffer.\"\n\nGoujet looked at her and then said suddenly, with trembling lips:\n\n\"You made me suffer yesterday.\"\n\nGervaise clasped her hands imploringly, and he continued:\n\n\"I knew of course how it must end; only you should not have allowed me\nto think--\"\n\nHe could not finish. She started up, seeing what his convictions were.\nShe cried out:\n\n\"You are wrong! I swear to you that you are wrong! He was going to\nkiss me, but his lips did not touch me, and it is the very first time\nthat he made the attempt. Believe me, for I swear--on all that I hold\nmost sacred--that I am telling you the truth.\"\n\nBut the blacksmith shook his head. He knew that women did not always\ntell the truth on such points. Gervaise then became very grave.\n\n\"You know me well,\" she said; \"you know that I am no liar. I again\nrepeat that Lantier and I are friends. We shall never be anything\nmore, for if that should ever come to pass I should regard myself\nas the vilest of the vile and should be unworthy of the friendship\nof a man like yourself.\" Her face was so honest, her eyes were so\nclear and frank, that he could do no less than believe her. Once more\nhe breathed freely. He held her hand for the first time. Both were\nsilent. White clouds sailed slowly above their heads with the majesty\nof swans. The goat looked at them and bleated piteously, eager to be\nreleased, and they stood hand in hand on that bleak slope with tears\nin their eyes.\n\n\"Your mother likes me no longer,\" said Gervaise in a low voice. \"Do\nnot say no; how can it be otherwise? We owe you so much money.\"\n\nHe roughly shook her arm in his eagerness to check the words on her\nlips; he would not hear her. He tried to speak, but his throat was\ntoo dry; he choked a little and then he burst out:\n\n\"Listen to me,\" he cried; \"I have long wished to say something to you.\nYou are not happy. My mother says things are all going wrong with you,\nand,\" he hesitated, \"we must go away together and at once.\"\n\nShe looked at him, not understanding him but impressed by this abrupt\ndeclaration of a love from him, who had never before opened his lips\nin regard to it.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she said.\n\n\"I mean,\" he answered without looking in her face, \"that we two can\ngo away and live in Belgium. It is almost the same to me as home, and\nboth of us could get work and live comfortably.\"\n\nThe color came to her face, which she would have hidden on his\nshoulder to hide her shame and confusion. He was a strange fellow to\npropose an elopement. It was like a book and like the things she heard\nof in high society. She had often seen and known of the workmen about\nher making love to married women, but they did not think of running\naway with them.\n\n\"Ah, Monsieur Goujet!\" she murmured, but she could say no more.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"we two would live all by ourselves.\"\n\nBut as her self-possession returned she refused with firmness.\n\n\"It is impossible,\" she said, \"and it would be very wrong. I am\nmarried and I have children. I know that you are fond of me, and I\nlove you too much to allow you to commit any such folly as you are\ntalking of, and this would be an enormous folly. No; we must live on\nas we are. We respect each other now. Let us continue to do so. That\nis a great deal and will help us over many a roughness in our paths.\nAnd when we try to do right we are sure of a reward.\"\n\nHe shook his head as he listened to her, but he felt she was right.\nSuddenly he snatched her in his arms and kissed her furiously once and\nthen dropped her and turned abruptly away. She was not angry, but the\nlocksmith trembled from head to foot. He began to gather some of the\nwild daisies, not knowing what to do with his hands, and tossed them\ninto her empty basket. This occupation amused him and tranquillized\nhim. He broke off the head of the flowers and, when he missed his\nmark and they fell short of the basket, laughed aloud.\n\nGervaise sat with her back against the tree, happy and calm. And when\nshe set forth on her walk home her basket was full of daisies, and\nshe was talking of Etienne.\n\nIn reality Gervaise was more afraid of Lantier than she was willing\nto admit even to herself. She was fully determined never to allow\nthe smallest familiarity, but she was afraid that she might yield\nto his persuasions, for she well knew the weakness and amiability of\nher nature and how hard it was for her to persist in any opposition\nto anyone.\n\nLantier, however, did not put this determination on her part to\nthe test. He was often alone with her now and was always quiet and\nrespectful. Coupeau declared to everyone that Lantier was a true\nfriend. There was no nonsense about him; he could be relied upon\nalways and in all emergencies. And he trusted him thoroughly, he\ndeclared. When they went out together--the three--on Sundays he bade\nhis wife and Lantier walk arm in arm, while he mounted guard behind,\nready to cuff the ears of anyone who ventured on a disrespectful\nglance, a sneer or a wink.\n\nHe laughed good-naturedly before Lantier's face, told him he put on\na great many airs with his coats and his books, but he liked him in\nspite of them. They understood each other, he said, and a man's liking\nfor another man is more solid and enduring than his love for a woman.\n\nCoupeau and Lantier made the money fly. Lantier was continually\nborrowing money from Gervaise--ten francs, twenty francs--whenever\nhe knew there was money in the house. It was always because he was in\npressing need for some business matter. But still on those same days\nhe took Coupeau off with him and at some distant restaurant ordered\nand devoured such dishes as they could not obtain at home, and these\ndishes were washed down by bottle after bottle of wine.\n\nCoupeau would have preferred to get tipsy without the food, but he\nwas impressed by the elegance and experience of his friend, who found\non the carte so many extraordinary sauces. He had never seen a man\nlike him, he declared, so dainty and so difficult. He wondered if all\nsoutherners were the same as he watched him discussing the dishes with\nthe waiter and sending away a dish that was too salty or had too much\npepper.\n\nNeither could he endure a draft: his skin was all blue if a door was\nleft open, and he made no end of a row until it was closed again.\n\nLantier was not wasteful in certain ways, for he never gave a\n_garcon_ more than two sous after he had served a meal that cost\nsome seven or eight francs.\n\nThey never alluded to these dinners the next morning at their simple\nbreakfast with Gervaise. Naturally people cannot frolic and work, too,\nand since Lantier had become a member of his household Coupeau had\nnever lifted a tool. He knew every drinking shop for miles around and\nwould sit and guzzle deep into the night, not always pleased to find\nhimself deserted by Lantier, who never was known to be overcome by\nliquor.\n\nAbout the first of November Coupeau turned over a new leaf; he\ndeclared he was going to work the next day, and Lantier thereupon\npreached a little sermon, declaring that labor ennobled man, and\nin the morning arose before it was light to accompany his friend to\nthe shop, as a mark of the respect he felt. But when they reached a\nwineshop on the corner they entered to take a glass merely to cement\ngood resolutions.\n\nNear the counter they beheld Bibi-la-Grillade smoking his pipe with\na sulky air.\n\n\"What is the matter, Bibi?\" cried Coupeau.\n\n\"Nothing,\" answered his comrade, \"except that I got my walking ticket\nyesterday. Perdition seize all masters!\" he added fiercely.\n\nAnd Bibi accepted a glass of liquor. Lantier defended the masters.\nThey were not so bad after all; then, too, how were the men to get\nalong without them? \"To be sure,\" continued Lantier, \"I manage pretty\nwell, for I don't have much to do with them myself!\"\n\n\"Come, my boy,\" he added, turning to Coupeau; \"we shall be late if\nwe don't look out.\"\n\nBibi went out with them. Day was just breaking, gray and cloudy. It\nhad rained the night before and was damp and warm. The street lamps\nhad just been extinguished. There was one continued tramp of men going\nto their work.\n\nCoupeau, with his bag of tools on his shoulder, shuffled along; his\nfootsteps had long since lost their ring.\n\n\"Bibi,\" he said, \"come with me; the master told me to bring a comrade\nif I pleased.\"\n\n\"It won't be me then,\" answered Bibi. \"I wash my hands of them all.\nNo more masters for me, I tell you! But I dare say Mes-Bottes would\nbe glad of the offer.\"\n\nAnd as they reached the Assommoir they saw Mes-Bottes within.\nNotwithstanding the fact that it was daylight, the gas was blazing\nin the Assommoir. Lantier remained outside and told Coupeau to make\nhaste, as they had only ten minutes.\n\n\"Do you think I will work for your master?\" cried Mes-Bottes. \"He is\nthe greatest tyrant in the kingdom. No, I should rather suck my thumbs\nfor a year. You won't stay there, old man! No, you won't stay there\nthree days, now I tell you!\"\n\n\"Are you in earnest?\" asked Coupeau uneasily.\n\n\"Yes, I am in earnest. You can't speak--you can't move. Your nose\nis held close to the grindstone all the time. He watches you every\nmoment. If you drink a drop he says you are tipsy and makes no end\nof a row!\"\n\n\"Thanks for the warning. I will try this one day, and if the master\nbothers me I will just tell him what I think of him and turn on my\nheel and walk out.\"\n\nCoupeau shook his comrade's hand and turned to depart, much to the\ndisgust of Mes-Bottes, who angrily asked if the master could not wait\nfive minutes. He could not go until he had taken a drink. Lantier\nentered to join in, and Mes-Bottes stood there with his hat on the\nback of his head, shabby, dirty and staggering, ordering Father\nColombe to pour out the glasses and not to cheat.\n\nAt that moment Goujet and Lorilleux were seen going by. Mes-Bottes\nshouted to them to come in, but they both refused--Goujet saying he\nwanted nothing, and the other, as he hugged a little box of gold\nchains close to his heart, that he was in a hurry.\n\n\"Milksops!\" muttered Mes-Bottes. \"They had best pass their lives in\nthe corner by the fire!\"\n\nReturning to the counter, he renewed his attack on Father Colombe,\nwhom he accused of adulterating his liquors.\n\nIt was now bright daylight, and the proprietor of the Assommoir began\nto extinguish the lights. Coupeau made excuses for his brother-in-law,\nwho, he said, could never drink; it was not his fault, poor fellow!\nHe approved, too, of Goujet, declaring that it was a good thing never\nto be thirsty. Again he made a move to depart and go to his work when\nLantier, with his dictatorial air, reminded him that he had not paid\nhis score and that he could not go off in that way, even if it were\nto his duty.\n\n\"I am sick of the words 'work' and 'duty,'\" muttered Mes-Bottes.\n\nThey all paid for their drinks with the exception of Bibi-la-Grillade,\nwho stooped toward the ear of Father Colombe and whispered a few\nwords. The latter shook his head, whereupon Mes-Bottes burst into a\ntorrent of invectives, but Colombe stood in impassive silence, and\nwhen there was a lull in the storm he said:\n\n\"Let your friends pay for you then--that is a very simple thing to\ndo.\"\n\nBy this time Mes-Bottes was what is properly called howling drunk, and\nas he staggered away from the counter he struck the bag of tools which\nCoupeau had over his shoulder.\n\n\"You look like a peddler with his pack or a humpback. Put it down!\"\n\nCoupeau hesitated a moment, and then slowly and deliberately, as if he\nhad arrived at a decision after mature deliberation, he laid his bag\non the ground.\n\n\"It is too late to go this morning. I will wait until after breakfast\nnow. I will tell him my wife was sick. Listen, Father Colombe, I will\nleave my bag of tools under this bench and come for them this\nafternoon.\"\n\nLantier assented to this arrangement. Of course work was a good thing,\nbut friends and good company were better; and the four men stood,\nfirst on one foot and then on the other, for more than an hour, and\nthen they had another drink all round. After that a game of billiards\nwas proposed, and they went noisily down the street to the nearest\nbilliard room, which did not happen to please the fastidious Lantier,\nwho, however, soon recovered his good humor under the effect of the\nadmiration excited in the minds of his friends by his play, which\nwas really very extraordinary.\n\nWhen the hour arrived for breakfast Coupeau had an idea.\n\n\"Let us go and find Bec Sali. I know where he works. We will make him\nbreakfast with us.\"\n\nThe idea was received with applause. The party started forth. A fine\ndrizzling rain was now falling, but they were too warm within to mind\nthis light sprinkling on their shoulders.\n\nCoupeau took them to a factory where his friend worked and at the door\ngave two sous to a small boy to go up and find Bec Sali and to tell\nhim that his wife was very sick and had sent for him.\n\nBec Sali quickly appeared, not in the least disturbed, as he suspected\na joke.\n\n\"Aha!\" he said as he saw his friend. \"I knew it!\" They went to a\nrestaurant and ordered a famous repast of pigs' feet, and they sat\nand sucked the bones and talked about their various employers.\n\n\"Will you believe,\" said Bec Sali, \"that mine has had the brass to\nhang up a bell? Does he think we are slaves to run when he rings it?\nNever was he so mistaken--\"\n\n\"I am obliged to leave you!\" said Coupeau, rising at last with an\nimportant air. \"I promised my wife to go to work today, and I leave\nyou with the greatest reluctance.\"\n\nThe others protested and entreated, but he seemed so decided that they\nall accompanied him to the Assommoir to get his tools. He pulled out\nthe bag from under the bench and laid it at his feet while they all\ntook another drink. The clock struck one, and Coupeau kicked his bag\nunder the bench again. He would go tomorrow to the factory; one day\nreally did not make much difference.\n\nThe rain had ceased, and one of the men proposed a little walk on the\nboulevards to stretch their legs. The air seemed to stupefy them, and\nthey loitered along with their arms swinging at their sides, without\nexchanging a word. When they reached the wineshop on the corner of La\nRue des Poissonniers they turned in mechanically. Lantier led the way\ninto a small room divided from the public one by windows only. This\nroom was much affected by Lantier, who thought it more stylish by far\nthan the public one. He called for a newspaper, spread it out and\nexamined it with a heavy frown. Coupeau and Mes-Bottes played a game\nof cards, while wine and glasses occupied the center of the table.\n\n\"What is the news?\" asked Bibi.\n\nLantier did not reply instantly, but presently, as the others emptied\ntheir glasses, he began to read aloud an account of a frightful\nmurder, to which they listened with eager interest. Then ensued a hot\ndiscussion and argument as to the probable motives for the murder.\n\nBy this time the wine was exhausted, and they called for more. About\nfive all except Lantier were in a state of beastly intoxication, and\nhe found them so disgusting that, as usual, he made his escape without\nhis comrades noticing his defection.\n\nLantier walked about a little and then, when he felt all right, went\nhome and told Gervaise that her husband was with his friends. Coupeau\ndid not make his appearance for two days. Rumors were brought in that\nhe had been seen in one place and then in another, and always alone.\nHis comrades had apparently deserted him. Gervaise shrugged her\nshoulders with a resigned air.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" she said. \"What a way to live!\" She never thought of\nhunting him up. Indeed, on the afternoon of the third day, when she\nsaw him through the window of a wineshop, she turned back and would\nnot pass the door. She sat up for him, however, and listened for his\nstep or the sound of his hand fumbling at the lock.\n\nThe next morning he came in, only to begin the same thing at night\nagain. This went on for a week, and at last Gervaise went to the\nAssommoir to make inquiries. Yes, he had been there a number of times,\nbut no one knew where he was just then. Gervaise picked up the bag\nof tools and carried them home.\n\nLantier, seeing that Gervaise was out of spirits, proposed that she\nshould go with him to a cafe concert. She refused at first, being\nin no mood for laughing; otherwise she would have consented, for\nLantier's proposal seemed to be prompted by the purest friendliness.\nHe seemed really sorry for her trouble and, indeed, assumed an\nabsolutely paternal air.\n\nCoupeau had never stayed away like this before, and she continually\nfound herself going to the door and looking up and down the street.\nShe could not keep to her work but wandered restlessly from place\nto place. Had Coupeau broken a limb? Had he fallen into the water?\nShe did not think she could care so very much if he were killed, if\nthis uncertainty were over, if she only knew what she had to expect.\nBut it was very trying to live in this suspense.\n\nFinally when the gas was lit and Lantier renewed his proposition of\nthe cafe she consented. After all, why should she not go? Why should\nshe refuse all pleasures because her husband chose to behave in this\ndisgraceful way? If he would not come in she would go out.\n\nThey hurried through their dinner, and as she went out with Lantier\nat eight o'clock Gervaise begged Nana and Mamma Coupeau to go to bed\nearly. The shop was closed, and she gave the key to Mme Boche, telling\nher that if Coupeau came in it would be as well to look out for the\nlights.\n\nLantier stood whistling while she gave these directions. Gervaise\nwore her silk dress, and she smiled as they walked down the street\nin alternate shadow and light from the shopwindows.\n\nThe cafe concert was on the Boulevard de Rochechoumart. It had once\nbeen a cafe and had had a concert room built on of rough planks.\n\nOver the door was a row of glass globes brilliantly illuminated.\nLong placards, nailed on wood, were standing quite out in the street\nby the side of the gutter.\n\n\"Here we are!\" said Lantier. \"Mademoiselle Amanda makes her debut\ntonight.\"\n\nBibi-la-Grillade was reading the placard. Bibi had a black eye, as if\nhe had been fighting.\n\n\"Hallo!\" cried Lantier. \"How are you? Where is Coupeau? Have you lost\nhim?\"\n\n\"Yes, since yesterday. We had a little fight with a waiter at Baquets.\nHe wanted us to pay twice for what we had, and somehow Coupeau and I\ngot separated, and I have not seen him since.\"\n\nAnd Bibi gave a great yawn. He was in a disgraceful state of\nintoxication. He looked as if he had been rolling in the gutter.\n\n\"And you know nothing of my husband?\" asked Gervaise.\n\n\"No, nothing. I think, though, he went off with a coachman.\"\n\nLantier and Gervaise passed a very agreeable evening at the cafe\nconcert, and when the doors were closed at eleven they went home in a\nsauntering sort of fashion. They were in no hurry, and the night was\nfair, though a little cool. Lantier hummed the air which Amanda had\nsung, and Gervaise added the chorus. The room had been excessively\nwarm, and she had drunk several glasses of wine.\n\nShe expressed a great deal of indignation at Mlle Amanda's costume.\nHow did she dare face all those men, dressed like that? But her skin\nwas beautiful, certainly, and she listened with considerable curiosity\nto all that Lantier could tell her about the woman.\n\n\"Everybody is asleep,\" said Gervaise after she had rung the bell\nthree times.\n\nThe door was finally opened, but there was no light. She knocked at\nthe door of the Boche quarters and asked for her key.\n\nThe sleepy concierge muttered some unintelligible words, from which\nGervaise finally gathered that Coupeau had been brought in by Poisson\nand that the key was in the door.\n\nGervaise stood aghast at the disgusting sight that met her eyes as\nshe entered the room where Coupeau lay wallowing on the floor.\n\nShe shuddered and turned away. This sight annihilated every ray of\nsentiment remaining in her heart.\n\n\"What am I to do?\" she said piteously. \"I can't stay here!\"\n\nLantier snatched her hand.\n\n\"Gervaise,\" he said, \"listen to me.\"\n\nBut she understood him and drew hastily back.\n\n\"No, no! Leave me, Auguste. I can manage.\"\n\nBut Lantier would not obey her. He put his arm around her waist and\npointed to her husband as he lay snoring, with his mouth wide open.\n\n\"Leave me!\" said Gervaise, imploringly, and she pointed to the room\nwhere her mother-in-law and Nana slept.\n\n\"You will wake them!\" she said. \"You would not shame me before my\nchild? Pray go!\"\n\nHe said no more but slowly and softly kissed her on her ear, as\nhe had so often teased her by doing in those old days. Gervaise\nshivered, and her blood was stirred to madness in her veins.\n\n\"What does that beast care?\" she thought. \"It is his fault,\" she\nmurmured; \"all his fault. He sends me from his room!\"\n\nAnd as Lantier drew her toward his door Nana's face appeared for\na moment at the window which lit her little cabinet.\n\nThe mother did not see the child, who stood in her nightdress, pale\nwith sleep. She looked at her father as he lay and then watched her\nmother disappear in Lantier's room. She was perfectly grave, but\nin her eyes burned the sensual curiosity of premature vice.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nCLOUDS IN THE HORIZON\n\nThat winter Mamma Coupeau was very ill with an asthmatic attack,\nwhich she always expected in the month of December.\n\nThe poor woman suffered much, and the depression of her spirits was\nnaturally very great. It must be confessed that there was nothing very\ngay in the aspect of the room where she slept. Between her bed and\nthat of the little girl there was just room for a chair. The paper\nhung in strips from the wall. Through a round window near the ceiling\ncame a dreary gray light. There was little ventilation in the room,\nwhich made it especially unfit for the old woman, who at night, when\nNana was there and she could hear her breathe, did not complain, but\nwhen left alone during the day, moaned incessantly, rolling her head\nabout on her pillow.\n\n\"Ah,\" she said, \"how unhappy I am! It is the same as a prison. I wish\nI were dead!\"\n\nAnd as soon as a visitor came in--Virginie or Mme Boche--she poured\nout her grievances. \"I should not suffer so much among strangers.\nI should like sometimes a cup of tisane, but I can't get it; and\nNana--that child whom I have raised from the cradle--disappears in the\nmorning and never shows her face until night, when she sleeps right\nthrough and never once asks me how I am or if she can do anything for\nme. It will soon be over, and I really believe this clearstarcher\nwould smother me herself--if she were not afraid of the law!\"\n\nGervaise, it is true, was not as gentle and sweet as she had been.\nEverything seemed to be going wrong with her, and she had lost heart\nand patience together. Mamma Coupeau had overheard her saying that\nshe was really a great burden. This naturally cut her to the heart,\nand when she saw her eldest daughter, Mme Lerat, she wept piteously\nand declared that she was being starved to death, and when these\ncomplaints drew from her daughter's pocket a little silver, she\nexpended it in dainties.\n\nShe told the most preposterous tales to Mme Lerat about Gervaise--of\nher new finery and of cakes and delicacies eaten in the corner and\nmany other things of infinitely more consequence. Then in a little\nwhile she turned against the Lorilleuxs and talked of them in the most\nbitter manner. At the height of her illness it so happened that her\ntwo daughters met one afternoon at her bedside. Their mother made a\nmotion to them to come closer. Then she went on to tell them, between\nparoxysms of coughing, that her son came home dead drunk the night\nbefore and that she was absolutely certain that Gervaise spent the\nnight in Lantier's room. \"It is all the more disgusting,\" she added,\n\"because I am certain that Nana heard what was going on quite as well\nas I did.\"\n\nThe two women did not appear either shocked or surprised.\n\n\"It is none of our business,\" said Mme Lorilleux. \"If Coupeau does not\nchoose to take any notice of her conduct it is not for us to do so.\"\n\nAll the neighborhood were soon informed of the condition of things by\nher two sisters-in-law, who declared they entered her doors only on\ntheir mother's account, who, poor thing, was compelled to live amid\nthese abominations.\n\nEveryone accused Gervaise now of having perverted poor Lantier. \"Men\nwill be men,\" they said; \"surely you can't expect them to turn a cold\nshoulder to women who throw themselves at their heads. She has no\npossible excuse; she is a disgrace to the whole street!\"\n\nThe Lorilleuxs invited Nana to dinner that they might question her,\nbut as soon as they began the child looked absolutely stupid, and\nthey could extort nothing from her.\n\nAmid this sudden and fierce indignation Gervaise lived--indifferent,\ndull and stupid. At first she loathed herself, and if Coupeau laid\nhis hand on her she shivered and ran away from him. But by degrees\nshe became accustomed to it. Her indolence had become excessive,\nand she only wished to be quiet and comfortable.\n\nAfter all, she asked herself, why should she care? If her lover\nand her husband were satisfied, why should she not be too? So\nthe household went on much as usual to all appearance. In reality,\nwhenever Coupeau came in tipsy, she left and went to Lantier's room\nto sleep. She was not led there by passion or affection; it was simply\nthat it was more comfortable. She was very like a cat in her choice\nof soft, clean places.\n\nMamma Coupeau never dared to speak out openly to the clearstarcher,\nbut after a dispute she was unsparing in her hints and allusions. The\nfirst time Gervaise fixed her eyes on her and heard all she had to say\nin profound silence. Then without seeming to speak of herself, she\ntook occasion to say not long afterward that when a woman was married\nto a man who was drinking himself to death a woman was very much to\nbe pitied and by no means to blame if she looked for consolation\nelsewhere.\n\nAnother time, when taunted by the old woman, she went still further\nand declared that Lantier was as much her husband as was Coupeau--that\nhe was the father of two of her children. She talked a little twaddle\nabout the laws of nature, and a shrewd observer would have seen that\nshe--parrotlike--was repeating the words that some other person had\nput into her mouth. Besides, what were her neighbors doing all about\nher? They were not so extremely respectable that they had the right\nto attack her. And then she took house after house and showed her\nmother-in-law that while apparently so deaf to gossip she yet knew\nall that was going on about her. Yes, she knew--and now seemed to\ngloat over that which once had shocked and revolted her.\n\n\"It is none of my business, I admit,\" she cried; \"let each person\nlive as he pleases, according to his own light, and let everybody\nelse alone.\"\n\nOne day when Mamma Coupeau spoke out more clearly she said with\ncompressed lips:\n\n\"Now look here, you are flat on your back and you take advantage of\nthat fact. I have never said a word to you about your own life, but\nI know it all the same--and it was atrocious! That is all! I am not\ngoing into particulars, but remember, you had best not sit in\njudgment on me!\"\n\nThe old woman was nearly suffocated with rage and her cough.\n\nThe next day Goujet came for his mother's wash while Gervaise was\nout. Mamma Coupeau called him into her room and kept him for an hour.\nShe read the young man's heart; she knew that his suspicions made\nhim miserable. And in revenge for something that had displeased\nher she told him the truth with many sighs and tears, as if her\ndaughter-in-law's infamous conduct was a bitter blow to her.\n\nWhen Goujet left her room he was deadly pale and looked ten years\nolder than when he went in. The old woman had, too, the additional\npleasure of telling Gervaise on her return that Mme Goujet had sent\nword that her linen must be returned to her at once, ironed or\nunironed. And she was so animated and comparatively amiable that\nGervaise scented the truth and knew instinctively what she had done\nand what she was to expect with Goujet. Pale and trembling, she piled\nthe linen neatly in a basket and set forth to see Mme Goujet. Years\nhad passed since she had paid her friends one penny. The debt still\nstood at four hundred and twenty-five francs. Each time she took the\nmoney for her washing she spoke of being pressed just at that time.\nIt was a great mortification for her.\n\nCoupeau was, however, less scrupulous and said with a laugh that if\nshe kissed her friend occasionally in the corner it would keep things\nstraight and pay him well. Then Gervaise, with eyes blazing with\nindignation, would ask if he really meant that. Had he fallen so low?\nNor should he speak of Goujet in that way in her presence.\n\nEvery time she took home the linen of these former friends she\nascended the stairs with a sick heart.\n\n\"Ah, it is you, is it?\" said Mme Goujet coldly as she opened the door.\nGervaise entered with some hesitation; she did not dare attempt to\nexcuse herself. She was no longer punctual to the hour or the\nday--everything about her was becoming perfectly disorderly.\n\n\"For one whole week,\" resumed the lace mender, \"you have kept me\nwaiting. You have told me falsehood after falsehood. You have sent\nyour apprentice to tell me that there was an accident--something had\nbeen spilled on the shirts, they would come the next day, and so on.\nI have been unnecessarily annoyed and worried, besides losing much\ntime. There is no sense in it! Now what have you brought home? Are\nthe shirts here which you have had for a month and the skirt which\nwas missing last week?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Gervaise, almost inaudibly; \"yes, the skirt is here.\nLook at it!\"\n\nBut Mme Goujet cried out in indignation.\n\nThat skirt did not belong to her, and she would not have it. This was\nthe crowning touch, if her things were to be changed in this way. She\ndid not like other people's things.\n\n\"And the shirts? Where are they? Lost, I suppose. Very well, settle it\nas you please, but these shirts I must have tomorrow morning!\"\n\nThere was a long silence. Gervaise was much disturbed by seeing that\nthe door of Goujet's room was wide open. He was there, she was sure,\nand listening to all these reproaches which she knew to be deserved\nand to which she could not reply. She was very quiet and submissive\nand laid the linen on the bed as quickly as possible.\n\nMme Goujet began to examine the pieces.\n\n\"Well! Well!\" she said. \"No one can praise your washing nowadays.\nThere is not a piece here that is not dirtied by the iron. Look at\nthis shirt: it is scorched, and the buttons are fairly torn off by the\nroot. Everything comes back--that comes at all, I should say--with the\nbuttons off. Look at that sack: the dirt is all in it. No, no, I can't\npay for such washing as this!\"\n\nShe stopped talking--while she counted the pieces. Then she exclaimed:\n\n\"Two pairs of stockings, six towels and one napkin are missing from\nthis week. You are laughing at me, it seems. Now, just understand,\nI tell you to bring back all you have, ironed or not ironed. If in\nan hour your woman is not here with the rest I have done with you,\nMadame Coupeau!\"\n\nAt this moment Goujet coughed. Gervaise started. How could she bear\nbeing treated in this way before him? And she stood confused and\nsilent, waiting for the soiled clothes.\n\nMme Goujet had taken her place and her work by the window.\n\n\"And the linen?\" said Gervaise timidly.\n\n\"Many thanks,\" said the old woman. \"There is nothing this week.\"\n\nGervaise turned pale; it was clear that Mme Goujet meant to take away\nher custom from her. She sank into a chair. She made no attempt at\nexcuses; she only asked a question.\n\n\"Is Monsieur Goujet ill?\"\n\n\"He is not well; at least he has just come in and is lying down to\nrest a little.\"\n\nMme Goujet spoke very slowly, almost solemnly, her pale face encircled\nby her white cap, and wearing, as usual, her plain black dress.\n\nAnd she explained that they were obliged to economize very closely.\nIn future she herself would do their washing. Of course Gervaise must\nknow that this would not be necessary had she and her husband paid\ntheir debt to her son. But of course they would submit; they would\nnever think of going to law about it. While she spoke of the debt her\nneedle moved rapidly to and fro in the delicate meshes of her work.\n\n\"But,\" continued Mme Goujet, \"if you were to deny yourself a little\nand be careful and prudent, you could soon discharge your debt to us;\nyou live too well; you spend too freely. Were you to give us only ten\nfrancs each month--\"\n\nShe was interrupted by her son, who called impatiently, \"Mother! Come\nhere, will you?\"\n\nWhen she returned she changed the conversation. Her son had\nundoubtedly begged her to say no more about this money to Gervaise. In\nspite of her evident determination to avoid this subject, she returned\nto it again in about ten minutes. She knew from the beginning just\nwhat would happen. She had said so at the time, and all had turned out\nprecisely as she had prophesied. The tinworker had drunk up the shop\nand had left his wife to bear the load by herself. If her son had\ntaken her advice he would never have lent the money. His marriage\nhad fallen through, and he had lost his spirits. She grew very angry\nas she spoke and finally accused Gervaise openly of having, with her\nhusband, deliberately conspired to cheat her simplehearted son.\n\n\"Many women,\" she exclaimed, \"played the parts of hypocrites and\nprudes for years and were found out at the last!\"\n\n\"Mother! Mother!\" called Goujet peremptorily.\n\nShe rose and when she returned said:\n\n\"Go in; he wants to see you.\"\n\nGervaise obeyed, leaving the door open behind her. She found the room\nsweet and fresh looking, like that of a young girl, with its simple\npictures and white curtains.\n\nGoujet, crushed by what he had heard from Mamma Coupeau, lay at full\nlength on the bed with pale face and haggard eyes.\n\n\"Listen!\" he said. \"You must not mind my mother's words; she does not\nunderstand. You do not owe me anything.\"\n\nHe staggered to his feet and stood leaning against the bed and looking\nat her.\n\n\"Are you ill?\" she said nervously.\n\n\"No, not ill,\" he answered, \"but sick at heart. Sick when I remember\nwhat you said and see the truth. Leave me. I cannot bear to look at\nyou.\"\n\nAnd he waved her away, not angrily, but with great decision. She went\nout without a word, for she had nothing to say. In the next room she\ntook up her basket and stood still a moment; Mme Goujet did not look\nup, but she said:\n\n\"Remember, I want my linen at once, and when that is all sent back\nto me we will settle the account.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Gervaise. And she closed the door, leaving behind her\nall that sweet odor and cleanliness on which she had once placed so\nhigh a value. She returned to the shop with her head bowed down and\nlooking neither to the right nor the left.\n\nMother Coupeau was sitting by the fire, having left her bed for the\nfirst time. Gervaise said nothing to her--not a word of reproach or\ncongratulation. She felt deadly tired; all her bones ached, as if she\nhad been beaten. She thought life very hard and wished that it were\nover for her.\n\nGervaise soon grew to care for nothing but her three meals per day.\nThe shop ran itself; one by one her customers left her. Gervaise\nshrugged her shoulders half indifferently, half insolently; everybody\ncould leave her, she said: she could always get work. But she was\nmistaken, and soon it became necessary for her to dismiss Mme Putois,\nkeeping no assistant except Augustine, who seemed to grow more and\nmore stupid as time went on. Ruin was fast approaching. Naturally, as\nindolence and poverty increased, so did lack of cleanliness. No one\nwould ever have known that pretty blue shop in which Gervaise had\nformerly taken such pride. The windows were unwashed and covered with\nthe mud scattered by the passing carriages. Within it was still more\nforlorn: the dampness of the steaming linen had ruined the paper;\neverything was covered with dust; the stove, which once had been kept\nso bright, was broken and battered. The long ironing table was covered\nwith wine stains and grease, looking as if it had served a whole\ngarrison. The atmosphere was loaded with a smell of cooking and of\nsour starch. But Gervaise was unconscious of it. She did not notice\nthe torn and untidy paper and, having ceased to pay any attention to\npersonal cleanliness, was hardly likely to spend her time in scrubbing\nthe greasy floors. She allowed the dust to accumulate over everything\nand never lifted a finger to remove it. Her own comfort and\ntranquillity were now her first considerations.\n\nHer debts were increasing, but they had ceased to give her any\nuneasiness. She was no longer honest or straightforward. She did not\ncare whether she ever paid or not, so long as she got what she wanted.\nWhen one shop refused her more credit she opened an account next\ndoor. She owed something in every shop in the whole _Quartier_. She\ndared not pass the grocer or the baker in her own street and was\ncompelled to make a lengthy circuit each time she went out. The\ntradespeople muttered and grumbled, and some went so far as to call\nher a thief and a swindler.\n\nOne evening the man who had sold her the furniture for Lantier's room\ncame in with ugly threats.\n\nSuch scenes were unquestionably disagreeable. She trembled for an hour\nafter them, but they never took away her appetite.\n\nIt was very stupid of these people, after all, she said to Lantier.\nHow could she pay them if she had no money? And where could she get\nmoney? She closed her eyes to the inevitable and would not think of\nthe future. Mamma Coupeau was well again, but the household had been\ndisorganized for more than a year. In summer there was more work\nbrought to the shop--white skirts and cambric dresses. There were\nups and downs, therefore: days when there was nothing in the house\nfor supper and others when the table was loaded.\n\nMamma Coupeau was seen almost daily, going out with a bundle under her\napron and returning without it and with a radiant face, for the old\nwoman liked the excitement of going to the Mont-de-Piete.\n\nGervaise was gradually emptying the house--linen and clothes, tools\nand furniture. In the beginning she took advantage of a good week\nto take out what she had pawned the week before, but after a while\nshe ceased to do that and sold her tickets. There was only one thing\nwhich cost her a pang, and that was selling her clock. She had sworn\nshe would not touch it, not unless she was dying of hunger, and\nwhen at last she saw her mother-in-law carry it away she dropped\ninto a chair and wept like a baby. But when the old woman came back\nwith twenty-five francs and she found she had five francs more than\nwas demanded by the pressing debt which had caused her to make the\nsacrifice, she was consoled and sent out at once for four sous' worth\nof brandy. When these two women were on good terms they often drank\na glass together, sitting at the corner of the ironing table.\n\nMamma Coupeau had a wonderful talent for bringing a glass in the\npocket of her apron without spilling a drop. She did not care to have\nthe neighbors know, but, in good truth, the neighbors knew very well\nand laughed and sneered as the old woman went in and out.\n\nThis, as was natural and right, increased the prejudice against\nGervaise. Everyone said that things could not go on much longer;\nthe end was near.\n\nAmid all this ruin Coupeau thrived surprisingly. Bad liquor seemed\nto affect him agreeably. His appetite was good in spite of the amount\nhe drank, and he was growing stout. Lantier, however, shook his head,\ndeclaring that it was not honest flesh and that he was bloated. But\nCoupeau drank all the more after this statement and was rarely or ever\nsober. There began to be a strange bluish tone in his complexion. His\nspirits never flagged. He laughed at his wife when she told him of\nher embarrassments. What did he care, so long as she provided him with\nfood to eat? And the longer he was idle, the more exacting he became\nin regard to this food.\n\nHe was ignorant of his wife's infidelity, at least, so all his friends\ndeclared. They believed, moreover, that were he to discover it there\nwould be great trouble. But Mme Lerat, his own sister, shook her head\ndoubtfully, averring that she was not so sure of his ignorance.\n\nLantier was also in good health and spirits, neither too stout nor\ntoo thin. He wished to remain just where he was, for he was thoroughly\nwell satisfied with himself, and this made him critical in regard to\nhis food, as he had made a study of the things he should eat and those\nhe should avoid for the preservation of his figure. Even when there\nwas not a cent he asked for eggs and cutlets: nourishing and light\nthings were what he required, he said. He ruled Gervaise with a rod of\niron, grumbled and found fault far more than Coupeau ever did. It was\na house with two masters, one of whom, cleverer by far than the other,\ntook the best of everything. He skimmed the Coupeaus, as it were, and\nkept all the cream for himself. He was fond of Nana because he liked\ngirls better than boys. He troubled himself little about Etienne.\n\nWhen people came and asked for Coupeau it was Lantier who appeared\nin his shirt sleeves with the air of the man of the house who is\nneedlessly disturbed. He answered for Coupeau, said it was one and\nthe same thing.\n\nGervaise did not find this life always smooth and agreeable. She had\nno reason to complain of her health. She had become very stout. But\nit was hard work to provide for and please these two men. When they\ncame in, furious and out of temper, it was on her that they wreaked\ntheir rage. Coupeau abused her frightfully and called her by the\ncoarsest epithets. Lantier, on the contrary, was more select in his\nphraseology, but his words cut her quite as deeply. Fortunately people\nbecome accustomed to almost everything in this world, and Gervaise\nsoon ceased to care for the reproaches and injustice of these two men.\nShe even preferred to have them out of temper with her, for then they\nlet her alone in some degree; but when they were in a good humor they\nwere all the time at her heels, and she could not find a leisure\nmoment even to iron a cap, so constant were the demands they made upon\nher. They wanted her to do this and do that, to cook little dishes for\nthem and wait upon them by inches.\n\nOne night she dreamed she was at the bottom of a well. Coupeau was\npushing her down with his fists, and Lantier was tickling her to make\nher jump out quicker. And this, she thought, was a very fair picture\nof her life! She said that the people of the _Quartier_ were very\nunjust, after all, when they reproached her for the way of life into\nwhich she had fallen. It was not her fault. It was not she who had\ndone it, and a little shiver ran over her as she reflected that\nperhaps the worst was not yet.\n\nThe utter deterioration of her nature was shown by the fact that she\ndetested neither her husband nor Lantier. In a play at the Gaite she\nhad seen a woman hate her husband and poison him for the sake of her\nlover. This she thought very strange and unnatural. Why could the\nthree not have lived together peaceably? It would have been much\nmore reasonable!\n\nIn spite of her debts, in spite of the shifts to which her increasing\npoverty condemned her, Gervaise would have considered herself quite\nwell off, but for the exacting selfishness of Lantier and Coupeau.\n\nToward autumn Lantier became more and more disgusted, declared he\nhad nothing to live on but potato parings and that his health was\nsuffering. He was enraged at seeing the house so thoroughly cleared\nout, and he felt that the day was not far off when he must take his\nhat and depart. He had become accustomed to his den, and he hated to\nleave it. He was thoroughly provoked that the extravagant habits of\nGervaise necessitated this sacrifice on his part. Why could she not\nhave shown more sense? He was sure he didn't know what would become\nof them. Could they have struggled on six months longer, he could\nhave concluded an affair which would have enabled him to support\nthe whole family in comfort.\n\nOne day it came to pass that there was not a mouthful in the house,\nnot even a radish. Lantier sat by the stove in somber discontent.\nFinally he started up and went to call on the Poissons, to whom he\nsuddenly became friendly to a degree. He no longer taunted the police\nofficer but condescended to admit that the emperor was a good fellow\nafter all. He showed himself especially civil to Virginie, whom he\nconsidered a clever woman and well able to steer her bark through\nstormy seas.\n\nVirginie one day happened to say in his presence that she should like\nto establish herself in some business. He approved the plan and paid\nher a succession of adroit compliments on her capabilities and cited\nthe example of several women he knew who had made or were making their\nfortunes in this way.\n\nVirginie had the money, an inheritance from an aunt, but she\nhesitated, for she did not wish to leave the _Quartier_ and she\ndid not know of any shop she could have. Then Lantier led her into\na corner and whispered to her for ten minutes; he seemed to be\npersuading her to something. They continued to talk together in\nthis way at intervals for several days, seeming to have some secret\nunderstanding.\n\nLantier all this time was fretting and scolding at the Coupeaus,\nasking Gervaise what on earth she intended to do, begging her to\nlook things fairly in the face. She owed five or six hundred francs\nto the tradespeople about her. She was behindhand with her rent, and\nMarescot, the landlord, threatened to turn her out if they did not pay\nbefore the first of January.\n\nThe Mont-de-Piete had taken everything; there was literally nothing\nbut the nails in the walls left. What did she mean to do?\n\nGervaise listened to all this at first listlessly, but she grew angry\nat last and cried out:\n\n\"Look here! I will go away tomorrow and leave the key in the door.\nI had rather sleep in the gutter than live in this way!\"\n\n\"And I can't say that it would not be a wise thing for you to do!\"\nanswered Lantier insidiously. \"I might possibly assist you to find\nsomeone to take the lease off your hands whenever you really conclude\nto leave the shop.\"\n\n\"I am ready to leave it at once!\" cried Gervaise violently. \"I am\nsick and tired of it.\"\n\nThen Lantier became serious and businesslike. He spoke openly of\nVirginie, who, he said, was looking for a shop; in fact, he now\nremembered having heard her say that she would like just such a\none as this.\n\nBut Gervaise shrank back and grew strangely calm at this name of\nVirginie.\n\nShe would see, she said; on the whole, she must have time to think.\nPeople said a great many things when they were angry, which on\nreflection were found not to be advisable.\n\nLantier rang the changes on this subject for a week, but Gervaise said\nshe had decided to employ some woman and go to work again, and if she\nwere not able to get back her old customers she could try for new\nones. She said this merely to show Lantier that she was not so utterly\ndowncast and crushed as he had seemed to take for granted was the\ncase.\n\nHe was reckless enough to drop the name of Virginie once more, and she\nturned upon him in a rage.\n\n\"No, no, never!\" She had always distrusted Virginie, and if she wanted\nthe shop it was only to humiliate her. Any other woman might have it,\nbut not this hypocrite, who had been waiting for years to gloat over\nher downfall. No, she understood now only too well the meaning of the\nyellow sparks in her cat's eyes. It was clear to her that Virginie had\nnever forgotten the scene in the lavatory, and if she did not look out\nthere would be a repetition of it.\n\nLantier stood aghast at this anger and this torrent of words, but\npresently he plucked up courage and bade her hold her tongue and told\nher she should not talk of his friends in that way. As for himself, he\nwas sick and tired of other people's affairs; in future he would let\nthem all take care of themselves, without a word of counsel from him.\n\nJanuary arrived, cold and damp. Mamma Coupeau took to her bed with\na violent cold which she expected each year at this time. But those\nabout her said she would never leave the house again, except feet\nfirst.\n\nHer children had learned to look forward to her death as a happy\ndeliverance for all. The physician who came once was not sent for\nagain. A little tisane was given her from time to time that she might\nnot feel herself utterly neglected. She was just alive; that was all.\nIt now became a mere question of time with her, but her brain was\nclear still, and in the expression of her eyes there were many things\nto be read--sorrow at seeing no sorrow in those she left behind her\nand anger against Nana, who was utterly indifferent to her.\n\nOne Monday evening Coupeau came in as tipsy as usual and threw\nhimself on the bed, all dressed. Gervaise intended to remain with\nher mother-in-law part of the night, but Nana was very brave and\nsaid she would hear if her grandmother moved and wanted anything.\n\nAbout half-past three Gervaise woke with a start; it seemed to her\nthat a cold blast had swept through the room. Her candle had burned\ndown, and she nastily wrapped a shawl around her with trembling hands\nand hurried into the next room. Nana was sleeping quietly, and her\ngrandmother was dead in the bed at her side.\n\nGervaise went to Lantier and waked him.\n\n\"She is dead,\" she said.\n\n\"Well, what of it?\" he muttered, half asleep. \"Why don't you go to\nsleep?\"\n\nShe turned away in silence while he grumbled at her coming to disturb\nhim by the intelligence of a death in the house.\n\nGervaise dressed herself, not without tears, for she really loved the\ncross old woman whose son lay in the heavy slumbers of intoxication.\n\nWhen she went back to the room she found Nana sitting up and rubbing\nher eyes. The child realized what had come to pass and trembled\nnervously in the face of this death of which she had thought much in\nthe last two days, as of something which was hidden from children.\n\n\"Get up!\" said her mother in a low voice. \"I do not wish you to stay\nhere.\"\n\nThe child slipped from her bed slowly and regretfully, with her eyes\nfixed on the dead body of her grandmother.\n\nGervaise did not know what to do with her or where to send her. At\nthis moment Lantier appeared at the door. He had dressed himself,\nimpelled by a little shame at his own conduct.\n\n\"Let the child go into my room,\" he said, \"and I will help you.\"\n\nNana looked first at her mother and then at Lantier and then trotted\nwith her little bare feet into the next room and slipped into the bed\nthat was still warm.\n\nShe lay there wide awake with blazing cheeks and eyes and seemed to\nbe absorbed in thought.\n\nWhile Lantier and Gervaise were silently occupied with the dead\nCoupeau lay and snored.\n\nGervaise hunted in a bureau to find a little crucifix which she had\nbrought from Plassans, when she suddenly remembered that Mamma Coupeau\nhad sold it. They each took a glass of wine and sat by the stove until\ndaybreak.\n\nAbout seven o'clock Coupeau woke. When he heard what had happened he\ndeclared they were jesting. But when he saw the body he fell on his\nknees and wept like a baby. Gervaise was touched by these tears and\nfound her heart softer toward her husband than it had been for many\na long year.\n\n\"Courage, old friend!\" said Lantier, pouring out a glass of wine as\nhe spoke.\n\nCoupeau took some wine, but he continued to weep, and Lantier went off\nunder pretext of informing the family, but he did not hurry. He walked\nalong slowly, smoking a cigar, and after he had been to Mme Lerat's he\nstopped in at a _cremerie_ to take a cup of coffee, and there he\nsat for an hour or more in deep thought.\n\nBy nine o'clock the family were assembled in the shop, whose shutters\nhad not been taken down. Lorilleux only remained for a few moments and\nthen went back to his shop. Mme Lorilleux shed a few tears and then\nsent Nana to buy a pound of candles.\n\n\"How like Gervaise!\" she murmured. \"She can do nothing in a proper\nway!\"\n\nMme Lerat went about among the neighbors to borrow a crucifix. She\nbrought one so large that when it was laid on the breast of Mamma\nCoupeau the weight seemed to crush her.\n\nThen someone said something about holy water, so Nana was sent to the\nchurch with a bottle. The room assumed a new aspect. On a small table\nburned a candle, near it a glass of holy water in which was a branch\nof box.\n\n\"Everything is in order,\" murmured the sisters; \"people can come now\nas soon as they please.\"\n\nLantier made his appearance about eleven. He had been to make\ninquiries in regard to funeral expenses.\n\n\"The coffin,\" he said, \"is twelve francs, and if you want a Mass, ten\nfrancs more. A hearse is paid for according to its ornaments.\"\n\n\"You must remember,\" said Mme Lorilleux with compressed lips, \"that\nMamma must be buried according to her purse.\"\n\n\"Precisely!\" answered Lantier. \"I only tell you this as your guide.\nDecide what you want, and after breakfast I will go and attend to\nit all.\"\n\nHe spoke in a low voice, oppressed by the presence of the dead. The\nchildren were laughing in the courtyard and Nana singing loudly.\n\nGervaise said gently:\n\n\"We are not rich, to be sure, but we wish to do what she would have\nliked. If Mamma Coupeau has left us nothing it was not her fault and\nno reason why we should bury her as if she were a dog. No, there must\nbe a Mass and a hearse.\"\n\n\"And who will pay for it?\" asked Mme Lorilleux. \"We can't, for we\nlost much money last week, and I am quite sure you would find it\nhard work!\"\n\nCoupeau, when he was consulted, shrugged his shoulders with a gesture\nof profound indifference. Mme Lerat said she would pay her share.\n\n\"There are three of us,\" said Gervaise after a long calculation; \"if\nwe each pay thirty francs we can do it with decency.\"\n\nBut Mme Lorilleux burst out furiously:\n\n\"I will never consent to such folly. It is not that I care for the\nmoney, but I disapprove of the ostentation. You can do as you please.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" replied Gervaise, \"I will. I have taken care of your\nmother while she was living; I can bury her now that she is dead.\"\n\nThen Mme Lorilleux fell to crying, and Lantier had great trouble\nin preventing her from going away at once, and the quarrel grew so\nviolent that Mme Lerat hastily closed the door of the room where\nthe dead woman lay, as if she feared the noise would waken her.\nThe children's voices rose shrill in the air with Nana's perpetual\n\"Tra-la-la\" above all the rest.\n\n\"Heavens, how wearisome those children are with their songs,\" said\nLantier. \"Tell them to be quiet, and make Nana come in and sit down.\"\n\nGervaise obeyed these dictatorial orders while her sisters-in-law went\nhome to breakfast, while the Coupeaus tried to eat, but they were made\nuncomfortable by the presence of death in their crowded quarters. The\ndetails of their daily life were disarranged.\n\nGervaise went to Goujet and borrowed sixty francs, which, added to\nthirty from Mme Lerat, would pay the expenses of the funeral. In\nthe afternoon several persons came in and looked at the dead woman,\ncrossing themselves as they did so and shaking holy water over the\nbody with the branch of box. They then took their seats in the shop\nand talked of the poor thing and of her many virtues. One said she\nhad talked with her only three days before, and another asked if\nit were not possible it was a trance.\n\nBy evening the Coupeaus felt it was more than they could bear.\nIt was a mistake to keep a body so long. One has, after all, only\nso many tears to shed, and that done, grief turns to worry. Mamma\nCoupeau--stiff and cold--was a terrible weight on them all. They\ngradually lost the sense of oppression, however, and spoke louder.\n\nAfter a while M. Marescot appeared. He went to the inner room and\nknelt at the side of the corpse. He was very religious, they saw.\nHe made a sign of the cross in the air and dipped the branch into\nthe holy water and sprinkled the body. M. Marescot, having finished\nhis devotions, passed out into the shop and said to Coupeau:\n\n\"I came for the two quarters that are due. Have you got the money\nfor me?\"\n\n\"No sir, not entirely,\" said Gervaise, coming forward, excessively\nannoyed at this scene taking place in the presence of her\nsisters-in-law. \"You see, this trouble came upon us--\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" answered her landlord; \"but we all of us have our\ntroubles. I cannot wait any longer. I really must have the money.\nIf I am not paid by tomorrow I shall most assuredly take immediate\nmeasures to turn you out.\"\n\nGervaise clasped her hands imploringly, but he shook his head,\nsaying that discussion was useless; besides, just then it would\nbe a disrespect to the dead.\n\n\"A thousand pardons!\" he said as he went out. \"But remember that\nI must have the money tomorrow.\"\n\nAnd as he passed the open door of the lighted room he saluted the\ncorpse with another genuflection.\n\nAfter he had gone the ladies gathered around the stove, where a great\npot of coffee stood, enough to keep them all awake for the whole\nnight. The Poissons arrived about eight o'clock; then Lantier,\ncarefully watching Gervaise, began to speak of the disgraceful act\ncommitted by the landlord in coming to a house to collect money at\nsuch a time.\n\n\"He is a thorough hypocrite,\" continued Lantier, \"and were I in Madame\nCoupeau's place, I would walk off and leave his house on his hands.\"\n\nGervaise heard but did not seem to heed.\n\nThe Lorilleuxs, delighted at the idea that she would lose her shop,\ndeclared that Lantier's idea was an excellent one. They gave Coupeau\na push and repeated it to him.\n\nGervaise seemed to be disposed to yield, and then Virginie spoke in\nthe blandest of tones.\n\n\"I will take the lease off your hands,\" she said, \"and will arrange\nthe back rent with your landlord.\"\n\n\"No, no! Thank you,\" cried Gervaise, shaking off the lethargy in which\nshe had been wrapped. \"I can manage this matter and I can work. No,\nno, I say.\"\n\nLantier interposed and said soothingly:\n\n\"Never mind! We will talk of it another time--tomorrow, possibly.\"\n\nThe family were to sit up all night. Nana cried vociferously when she\nwas sent into the Boche quarters to sleep; the Poissons remained until\nmidnight. Virginia began to talk of the country: she would like to be\nburied under a tree with flowers and grass on her grave. Mme Lerat\nsaid that in her wardrobe--folded up in lavender--was the linen sheet\nin which her body was to be wrapped.\n\nWhen the Poissons went away Lantier accompanied them in order,\nhe said, to leave his bed for the ladies, who could take turns in\nsleeping there. But the ladies preferred to remain together about\nthe stove.\n\nMme Lorilleux said she had no black dress, and it was too bad that she\nmust buy one, for they were sadly pinched just at this time. And she\nasked Gervaise if she was sure that her mother had not a black skirt\nwhich would do, one that had been given her on her birthday. Gervaise\nwent for the skirt. Yes, it would do if it were taken in at the waist.\n\nThen Mme Lorilleux looked at the bed and the wardrobe and asked if\nthere was nothing else belonging to her mother.\n\nHere Mme Lerat interfered. The Coupeaus, she said, had taken care of\nher mother, and they were entitled to all the trifles she had left.\nThe night seemed endless. They drank coffee and went by turns to look\nat the body, lying silent and calm under the flickering light of the\ncandle.\n\nThe interment was to take place at half-past ten, but Gervaise would\ngladly have given a hundred francs, if she had had them, to anyone who\nwould have taken Mamma Coupeau away three hours before the time fixed.\n\n\"Ah,\" she said to herself, \"it is no use to disguise the fact: people\nare very much in the way after they are dead, no matter how much you\nhave loved them!\"\n\nFather Bazonge, who was never known to be sober, appeared with the\ncoffin and the pall. When he saw Gervaise he stood with his eyes\nstarting from his head.\n\n\"I beg you pardon,\" he said, \"but I thought it was for you,\" and he\nwas turning to go away.\n\n\"Leave the coffin!\" cried Gervaise, growing very pale. Bazonge began\nto apologize:\n\n\"I heard them talking yesterday, but I did not pay much attention. I\ncongratulate you that you are still alive. Though why I do, I do not\nknow, for life is not such a very agreeable thing.\"\n\nGervaise listened with a shiver of horror and a morbid dread that he\nwould take her away and shut her up in his box and bury her. She had\nonce heard him say that he knew a woman who would be only too thankful\nif he would do exactly that.\n\n\"He is horribly drunk,\" she murmured in a tone of mingled disgust and\nterror.\n\n\"It will come for you another time,\" he said with a laugh; \"you have\nonly to make me a little sign. I am a great consolation to women\nsometimes, and you need not sneer at poor Father Bazonge, for he has\nheld many a fine lady in his arms, and they made no complaint when\nhe laid them down to sleep in the shade of the evergreens.\"\n\n\"Do hold your tongue,\" said Lorilleux; \"this is no time for such talk.\nBe off with you!\"\n\nThe clock struck ten. The friends and neighbors had assembled in the\nshop while the family were in the back room, nervous and feverish with\nsuspense.\n\nFour men appeared--the undertaker, Bazonge and his three assistants\nplaced the body in the coffin. Bazonge held the screws in his mouth\nand waited for the family to take their last farewell.\n\nThen Coupeau, his two sisters and Gervaise kissed their mother,\nand their tears fell fast on her cold face. The lid was put on and\nfastened down.\n\nThe hearse was at the door to the great edification of the\ntradespeople of the neighborhood, who said under their breath that\nthe Coupeaus had best pay their debts.\n\n\"It is shameful,\" Gervaise was saying at the same moment, speaking\nof the Lorilleuxs. \"These people have not even brought a bouquet of\nviolets for their mother.\"\n\nIt was true they had come empty-handed, while Mme Lerat had brought\na wreath of artificial flowers which was laid on the bier.\n\nCoupeau and Lorilleux, with their hats in their hands, walked at the\nhead of the procession of men. After them followed the ladies, headed\nby Mme Lorilleux in her black skirt, wrenched from the dead, her\nsister trying to cover a purple dress with a large black shawl.\n\nGervaise had lingered behind to close the shop and give Nana into the\ncharge of Mme Boche and then ran to overtake the procession, while the\nlittle girl stood with the concierge, profoundly interested in seeing\nher grandmother carried in that beautiful carriage.\n\nJust as Gervaise joined the procession Goujet came up a side street\nand saluted her with a slight bow and with a faint sweet smile. The\ntears rushed to her eyes. She did not weep for Mamma Coupeau but\nrather for herself, but her sisters-in-law looked at her as if she\nwere the greatest hypocrite in the world.\n\nAt the church the ceremony was of short duration. The Mass dragged\na little because the priest was very old.\n\nThe cemetery was not far off, and the cortege soon reached it. A\npriest came out of a house near by and shivered as he saw his breath\nrise with each _De Profundis_ he uttered.\n\nThe coffin was lowered, and as the frozen earth fell upon it more\ntears were shed, accompanied, however, by sigh of relief.\n\nThe procession dispersed outside the gates of the cemetery, and at\nthe very first cabaret Coupeau turned in, leaving Gervaise alone on\nthe sidewalk. She beckoned to Goujet, who was turning the corner.\n\n\"I want to speak to you,\" she said timidly. \"I want to tell you how\nashamed I am for coming to you again to borrow money, but I was at\nmy wit's end.\"\n\n\"I am always glad to be of use to you,\" answered the blacksmith. \"But\npray never allude to the matter before my mother, for I do not wish\nto trouble her. She and I think differently on many subjects.\"\n\nShe looked at him sadly and earnestly. Through her mind flitted a\nvague regret that she had not done as he desired, that she had not\ngone away with him somewhere. Then a vile temptation assailed her.\nShe trembled.\n\n\"You are not angry now?\" she said entreatingly.\n\n\"No, not angry, but still heartsick. All is over between us now\nand forever.\" And he walked off with long strides, leaving Gervaise\nstunned by his words.\n\n\"All is over between us!\" she kept saying to herself. \"And what more\nis there for me then in life?\"\n\nShe sat down in her empty, desolate room and drank a large tumbler\nof wine. When the others came in she looked up suddenly and said to\nVirginie gently:\n\n\"If you want the shop, take it!\"\n\nVirginie and her husband jumped at this and sent for the concierge,\nwho consented to the arrangement on condition that the new tenants\nwould become security for the two quarters then due.\n\nThis was agreed upon. The Coupeaus would take a room on the sixth\nfloor near the Lorilleuxs. Lantier said politely that if it would not\nbe disagreeable to the Poissons he should like much to retain his\npresent quarters.\n\nThe policeman bowed stiffly but with every intention of being cordial\nand said he decidedly approved of the idea.\n\nThen Lantier withdrew from the discussion entirely, watching Gervaise\nand Virginie out of the corners of his eyes.\n\nThat evening when Gervaise was alone again she felt utterly exhausted.\nThe place looked twice its usual size. It seemed to her that in\nleaving Mamma Coupeau in the quiet cemetery she had also left much\nthat was precious to her, a portion of her own life, her pride in her\nshop, her hopes and her energy. These were not all, either, that she\nhad buried that day. Her heart was as bare and empty as her walls and\nher home. She was too weary to try and analyze her sensations but\nmoved about as if in a dream.\n\nAt ten o'clock, when Nana was undressed, she wept, begging that she\nmight be allowed to sleep in her grandmother's bed. Her mother vaguely\nwondered that the child was not afraid and allowed her to do as she\npleased.\n\nNana was not timid by nature, and only her curiosity, not her fears,\nhad been excited by the events of the last three days, and she curled\nherself up with delight in the soft, warm feather bed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nDISASTERS AND CHANGES\n\nThe new lodging of the Coupeaus was next that of the Bijards. Almost\nopposite their door was a closet under the stairs which went up to\nthe roof--a mere hole without light or ventilation, where Father Bru\nslept.\n\nA chamber and a small room, about as large as one's hand, were all the\nCoupeaus had now. Nana's little bed stood in the small room, the door\nof which had to be left open at night, lest the child should stifle.\n\nWhen it came to the final move Gervaise felt that she could not\nseparate from the commode which she had spent so much time in\npolishing when first married and insisted on its going to their new\nquarters, where it was much in the way and stopped up half the window,\nand when Gervaise wished to look out into the court she had not room\nfor her elbows.\n\nThe first few days she spent in tears. She felt smothered and cramped;\nafter having had so much room to move about in it seemed to her that\nshe was smothering. It was only at the window she could breathe. The\ncourtyard was not a place calculated to inspire cheerful thoughts.\nOpposite her was the window which years before had elicited her\nadmiration, where every successive summer scarlet beans had grown to\na fabulous height on slender strings. Her room was on the shady side,\nand a pot of mignonette would die in a week on her sill.\n\nNo, life had not been what she hoped, and it was all very hard to\nbear.\n\nInstead of flowers to solace her declining years she would have but\nthorns. One day as she was looking down into the court she had the\nstrangest feeling imaginable. She seemed to see herself standing just\nnear the loge of the concierge, looking up at the house and examining\nit for the first time.\n\nThis glimpse of the past made her feel faint. It was at least thirteen\nyears since she had first seen this huge building--this world within\na world. The court had not changed. The facade was simply more dingy.\nThe same clothes seemed to be hanging at the windows to dry. Below\nthere were the shavings from the cabinetmaker's shop, and the gutter\nglittered with blue water, as blue and soft in tone as the water she\nremembered.\n\nBut she--alas, how changed was she! She no longer looked up to the\nsky. She was no longer hopeful, courageous and ambitious. She was\nliving under the very roof in crowded discomfort, where never a ray\nof sunshine could reach her, and her tears fell fast in utter\ndiscouragement.\n\nNevertheless, when Gervaise became accustomed to her new surroundings\nshe grew more content. The pieces of furniture she had sold to\nVirginie had facilitated her installation. When the fine weather came\nCoupeau had an opportunity of going into the country to work. He went\nand lived three months without drinking--cured for the time being by\nthe fresh, pure air. It does a man sometimes an infinite deal of good\nto be taken away from all his old haunts and from Parisian streets,\nwhich always seem to exhale a smell of brandy and of wine.\n\nHe came back as fresh as a rose, and he brought four hundred francs\nwith which he paid the Poissons the amount for which they had become\nsecurity as well as several other small but pressing debts. Gervaise\nhad now two or three streets open to her again, which for some time\nshe had not dared to enter.\n\nShe now went out to iron by the day and had gone back to her old\nmistress, Mme Fauconnier, who was a kindhearted creature and ready\nto do anything for anyone who flattered her adroitly.\n\nWith diligence and economy Gervaise could have managed to live\ncomfortably and pay all her debts, but this prospect did not charm her\nparticularly. She suffered acutely in seeing the Poissons in her old\nshop. She was by no means of a jealous or envious disposition, but\nit was not agreeable to her to hear the admiration expressed for her\nsuccessors by her husband's sisters. To hear them one would suppose\nthat never had so beautiful a shop been seen before. They spoke of\nthe filthy condition of the place when Virginie moved in--who had\npaid, they declared, thirty francs for cleaning it.\n\nVirginie, after some hesitation, had decided on a small stock of\ngroceries--sugar, tea and coffee, also bonbons and chocolate. Lantier\nhad advised these because he said the profit on them was immense. The\nshop was repainted, and shelves and cases were put in, and a counter\nwith scales such as are seen at confectioners'. The little inheritance\nthat Poisson held in reserve was seriously encroached upon. But\nVirginie was triumphant, for she had her way, and the Lorilleuxs\ndid not spare Gervaise the description of a case or a jar.\n\nIt was said in the street that Lantier had deserted Gervaise,\nthat she gave him no peace running after him, but this was not true,\nfor he went and came to her apartment as he pleased. Scandal was\nconnecting his name and Virginie's. They said Virginie had taken the\nclearstarcher's lover as well as her shop! The Lorilleuxs talked of\nnothing when Gervaise was present but Lantier, Virginie and the shop.\nFortunately Gervaise was not inclined to jealousy, and Lantier's\ninfidelities had hitherto left her undisturbed, but she did not accept\nthis new affair with equal tranquillity. She colored or turned pale\nas she heard these allusions, but she would not allow a word to pass\nher lips, as she was fully determined never to gratify her enemies\nby allowing them to see her discomfiture; but a dispute was heard by\nthe neighbors about this time between herself and Lantier, who went\nangrily away and was not seen by anyone in the Coupeau quarters for\nmore than a fortnight.\n\nCoupeau behaved very oddly. This blind and complacent husband, who\nhad closed his eyes to all that was going on at home, was filled with\nvirtuous indignation at Lantier's indifference. Then Coupeau went so\nfar as to tease Gervaise in regard to this desertion of her lovers.\nShe had had bad luck, he said, with hatters and blacksmiths--why did\nshe not try a mason?\n\nHe said this as if it were a joke, but Gervaise had a firm conviction\nthat he was in deadly earnest. A man who is tipsy from one year's end\nto the next is not apt to be fastidious, and there are husbands who at\ntwenty are very jealous and at thirty have grown very complacent under\nthe influence of constant tippling.\n\nLantier preserved an attitude of calm indifference. He kept the peace\nbetween the Poissons and the Coupeaus. Thanks to him, Virginie and\nGervaise affected for each other the most tender regard. He ruled the\nbrunette as he had ruled the blonde, and he would swallow her shop as\nhe had that of Gervaise.\n\nIt was in June of this year that Nana partook of her first Communion.\nShe was about thirteen, slender and tall as an asparagus plant, and\nher air and manner were the height of impertinence and audacity.\n\nShe had been sent away from the catechism class the year before on\naccount of her bad conduct. And if the cure did not make a similar\nobjection this year it was because he feared she would never come\nagain and that his refusal would launch on the Parisian _pave_\nanother castaway.\n\nNana danced with joy at the mere thought of what the Lorilleuxs--as\nher godparents--had promised, while Mme Lerat gave the veil and cup,\nVirginie the purse and Lantier a prayer book, so that the Coupeaus\nlooked forward to the day without anxiety.\n\nThe Poissons--probably through Lantier's advice--selected this\noccasion for their housewarming. They invited the Coupeaus and the\nBoche family, as Pauline made her first Communion on that day, as\nwell as Nana.\n\nThe evening before, while Nana stood in an ecstasy of delight before\nher presents, her father came in in an abominable condition. His\nvirtuous resolutions had yielded to the air of Paris; he had fallen\ninto evil ways again, and he now assailed his wife and child with the\nvilest epithets, which did not seem to shock Nana, for they could fall\nfrom her tongue on occasion with facile glibness.\n\n\"I want my soup,\" cried Coupeau, \"and you two fools are chattering\nover those fal-lals! I tell you, I will sit on them if I am not waited\nupon, and quickly too.\"\n\nGervaise answered impatiently, but Nana, who thought it better taste\njust then--all things considered--to receive with meekness all her\nfather's abuse, dropped her eyes and did not reply.\n\n\"Take that rubbish away!\" he cried with growing impatience. \"Put it\nout of my sight or I will tear it to bits.\"\n\nNana did not seem to hear him. She took up the tulle cap and asked her\nmother what it cost, and when Coupeau tried to snatch the cap Gervaise\npushed him away.\n\n\"Let the child alone!\" she said. \"She is doing no harm!\"\n\nThen her husband went into a perfect rage:\n\n\"Mother and daughter,\" he cried, \"a nice pair they make. I understand\nvery well what all this row is for: it is merely to show yourself in a\nnew gown. I will put you in a bag and tie it close round your throat,\nand you will see if the cure likes that!\"\n\nNana turned like lightning to protect her treasures. She looked her\nfather full in the face, and, forgetting the lessons taught her by\nher priest, she said in a low, concentrated voice:\n\n\"Beast!\" That was all.\n\nAfter Coupeau had eaten his soup he fell asleep and in the morning\nwoke quite amiable. He admired his daughter and said she looked quite\nlike a young lady in her white robe. Then he added with a sentimental\nair that a father on such days was naturally proud of his child.\nWhen they were ready to go to the church and Nana met Pauline in\nthe corridor, she examined the latter from head to foot and smiled\ncondescendingly on seeing that Pauline had not a particle of chic.\n\nThe two families started off together, Nana and Pauline in front,\neach with her prayer book in one hand and with the other holding down\nher veil, which swelled in the wind like a sail. They did not speak\nto each other but keenly enjoyed seeing the shopkeepers run to their\ndoors to see them, keeping their eyes cast down devoutly but their\nears wide open to any compliment they might hear.\n\nNana's two aunts walked side by side, exchanging their opinions\nin regard to Gervaise, whom they stigmatized as an irreligious\nne'er-do-well whose child would never have gone to the Holy\nCommunion if it had depended on her.\n\nAt the church Coupeau wept all the time. It was very silly, he knew,\nbut he could not help it. The voice of the cure was pathetic; the\nlittle girls looked like white-robed angels; the organ thrilled him,\nand the incense gratified his senses. There was one especial anthem\nwhich touched him deeply. He was not the only person who wept, he\nwas glad to see, and when the ceremony was over he left the church\nfeeling that it was the happiest day of his life. But an hour later\nhe quarreled with Lorilleux in a wineshop because the latter was so\nhardhearted.\n\nThe housewarming at the Poissons' that night was very gay. Lantier\nsat between Gervaise and Virginie and was equally civil and attentive\nto both. Opposite was Poisson with his calm, impassive face, a look\nhe had cultivated since he began his career as a police officer.\n\nBut the queens of the fete were the two little girls, Nana and\nPauline, who sat very erect lest they should crush and deface their\npretty white dresses. At dessert there was a serious discussion in\nregard to the future of the children. Mme Boche said that Pauline\nwould at once enter a certain manufactory, where she would receive\nfive or six francs per week. Gervaise had not decided yet, for Nana\nhad shown no especial leaning in any direction. She had a good deal\nof taste, but she was butter-fingered and careless.\n\n\"I should make a florist of her,\" said Mme Lerat. \"It is clean work\nand pretty work too.\"\n\nWhereupon ensued a warm discussion. The men were especially careful\nof their language out of deference to the little girls, but Mme Lerat\nwould not accept the lesson: she flattered herself she could say what\nshe pleased in such a way that it could not offend the most fastidious\nears.\n\nWomen, she declared, who followed her trade were more virtuous than\nothers. They rarely made a slip.\n\n\"I have no objection to your trade,\" interrupted Gervaise. \"If Nana\nlikes to make flowers let her do so. Say, Nana, would you like it?\"\n\nThe little girl did not look up from her plate, into which she was\ndipping a crust of bread. She smiled faintly as she replied:\n\n\"Yes, Mamma; if you desire it I have no objection.\"\n\nThe decision was instantly made, and Coupeau wished his sister to\ntake her the very next day to the place where she herself worked,\nRue du Caire, and the circle talked gravely of the duties of life.\nBoche said that Pauline and Nana were now women, since they had been\nto Communion, and they ought to be serious and learn to cook and to\nmend. They alluded to their future marriages, their homes and their\nchildren, and the girls touched each other under the table, giggled\nand grew very red. Lantier asked them if they did not have little\nhusbands already, and Nana blushingly confessed that she loved Victor\nFauconnier and never meant to marry anyone else.\n\nMme Lorilleux said to Mme Boche on their way home:\n\n\"Nana is our goddaughter now, but if she goes into that flower\nbusiness, in six months she will be on the _pave_, and we will\nhave nothing to do with her.\"\n\nGervaise told Boche that she thought the shop admirably arranged. She\nhad looked forward to an evening of torture and was surprised that\nshe had not experienced a pang.\n\nNana, as she undressed, asked her mother if the girl on the next\nfloor, who had been married the week before, wore a dress of muslin\nlike hers.\n\nBut this was the last bright day in that household. Two years passed\naway, and their prospects grew darker and their demoralization and\ndegradation more evident. They went without food and without fire,\nbut never without brandy.\n\nThey found it almost impossible to meet their rent, and a certain\nJanuary came when they had not a penny, and Father Boche ordered\nthem to leave.\n\nIt was frightfully cold, with a sharp wind blowing from the north.\n\nM. Marescot appeared in a warm overcoat and his hands encased in warm\nwoolen gloves and told them they must go, even if they slept in the\ngutter. The whole house was oppressed with woe, and a dreary sound of\nlamentation arose from most of the rooms, for half the tenants were\nbehindhand. Gervaise sold her bed and paid the rent. Nana made nothing\nas yet, and Gervaise had so fallen off in her work that Mme Fauconnier\nhad reduced her wages. She was irregular in her hours and often\nabsented herself from the shop for several days together but was none\nthe less vexed to discover that her old employee, Mme Putois, had been\nplaced above her. Naturally at the end of the week Gervaise had little\nmoney coming to her.\n\nAs to Coupeau, if he worked he brought no money home, and his wife had\nceased to count upon it. Sometimes he declared he had lost it through\na hole in his pocket or it had been stolen, but after a while he\nceased to make any excuses.\n\nBut if he had no cash in his pockets it was because he had spent it\nall in drink. Mme Boche advised Gervaise to watch for him at the door\nof the place where he was employed and get his wages from him before\nhe had spent them all, but this did no good, as Coupeau was warned\nby his friends and escaped by a rear door.\n\nThe Coupeaus were entirely to blame for their misfortunes, but this\nis just what people will never admit. It is always ill luck or the\ncruelty of God or anything, in short, save the legitimate result\nof their own vices.\n\nGervaise now quarreled with her husband incessantly. The warmth of\naffection of husband and wife, of parents for their children and\nchildren for their parents had fled and left them all shivering,\neach apart from the other.\n\nAll three, Coupeau, Gervaise and Nana, watched each other with eyes\nof baleful hate. It seemed as if some spring had broken--the great\nmainspring that binds families together.\n\nGervaise did not shudder when she saw her husband lying drunk in the\ngutter. She would not have pushed him in, to be sure, but if he were\nout of the way it would be a good thing for everybody. She even went\nso far as to say one day in a fit of rage that she would be glad to\nsee him brought home on a shutter. Of what good was he to any human\nbeing? He ate and he drank and he slept. His child learned to hate\nhim, and she read the accidents in the papers with the feelings of\nan unnatural daughter. What a pity it was that her father had not\nbeen the man who was killed when that omnibus tipped over!\n\nIn addition to her own sorrows and privations, Gervaise, whose\nheart was not yet altogether hard, was condemned to hear now of the\nsufferings of others. The corner of the house in which she lived\nseemed to be consecrated to those who were as poor as herself. No\nsmell of cooking filled the air, which, on the contrary, was laden\nwith the shrill cries of hungry children, heavy with the sighs of\nweary, heartbroken mothers and with the oaths of drunken husbands\nand fathers.\n\nGervaise pitied Father Bru from the bottom of her heart; he lay the\ngreater part of the time rolled up in the straw in his den under the\nstaircase leading to the roof. When two or three days elapsed without\nhis showing himself someone opened the door and looked in to see if\nhe were still alive.\n\nYes, he was living; that is, he was not dead. When Gervaise had bread\nshe always remembered him. If she had learned to hate men because\nof her husband her heart was still tender toward animals, and Father\nBru seemed like one to her. She regarded him as a faithful old dog.\nHer heart was heavy within her whenever she thought of him, alone,\nabandoned by God and man, dying by inches or drying, rather, as an\norange dries on the chimney piece.\n\nGervaise was also troubled by the vicinity of the undertaker\nBazonge--a wooden partition alone separated their rooms. When he came\nin at night she could hear him throw down his glazed hat, which fell\nwith a dull thud, like a shovelful of clay, on the table. The black\ncloak hung against the wall rustled like the wings of some huge\nbird of prey. She could hear his every movement, and she spent most\nof her time listening to him with morbid horror, while he--all\nunconscious--hummed his vulgar songs and tipsily staggered to his\nbed, under which the poor woman's sick fancy pictured a dead body\nconcealed.\n\nShe had read in some paper a dismal tale of some undertaker who took\nhome with him coffin after coffin--children's coffins--in order to\nmake one trip to the cemetery suffice. When she heard his step the\nwhole corridor was pervaded to her senses with the odor of dead\nhumanity.\n\nShe would as lief have resided at Pere-Lachaise and watched the moles\nat their work. The man terrified her; his incessant laughter dismayed\nher. She talked of moving but at the same time was reluctant to do\nso, for there was a strange fascination about Bazonge after all. Had\nhe not told her once that he would come for her and lay her down to\nsleep in the shadow of waving branches, where she would know neither\nhunger nor toil?\n\nShe wished she could try it for a month. And she thought how delicious\nit would be in midwinter, just at the time her quarter's rent was due.\nBut, alas, this was not possible! The rest and the sleep must be\neternal; this thought chilled her, and her longing for death faded\naway before the unrelenting severity of the bonds exacted by Mother\nEarth.\n\nOne night she was sick and feverish, and instead of throwing herself\nout of the window as she was tempted to do, she rapped on the\npartition and called loudly:\n\n\"Father Bazonge! Father Bazonge!\"\n\nThe undertaker was kicking off his slippers, singing a vulgar song\nas he did so.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" he answered.\n\nBut at his voice Gervaise awoke as from a nightmare. What had she\ndone? Had she really tapped? she asked herself, and she recoiled from\nhis side of the wall in chill horror. It seemed to her that she felt\nthe undertaker's hands on her head. No! No! She was not ready. She\ntold herself that she had not intended to call him. It was her elbow\nthat had knocked the wall accidentally, and she shivered from head\nto foot at the idea of being carried away in this man's arms.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" repeated Bazonge. \"Can I serve you in any way,\nmadame?\"\n\n\"No! No! It is nothing!\" answered the laundress in a choked voice.\n\"I am very much obliged.\"\n\nWhile the undertaker slept she lay wide awake, holding her breath and\nnot daring to move, lest he should think she called him again.\n\nShe said to herself that under no circumstances would she ever appeal\nto him for assistance, and she said this over and over again with the\nvain hope of reassuring herself, for she was by no means at ease in\nher mind.\n\nGervaise had before her a noble example of courage and fortitude in\nthe Bijard family. Little Lalie, that tiny child--about as big as\na pinch of salt--swept and kept her room like wax; she watched over\nthe two younger children with all the care and patience of a mother.\nThis she had done since her father had kicked her mother to death.\nShe had entirely assumed that mother's place, even to receiving the\nblows which had fallen formerly on that poor woman. It seemed to be a\nnecessity of his nature that when he came home drunk he must have some\nwoman to abuse. Lalie was too small, he grumbled; one blow of his fist\ncovered her whole face, and her skin was so delicate that the marks of\nhis five fingers would remain on her cheek for days!\n\nHe would fly at her like a wolf at a poor little kitten for the merest\ntrifle. Lalie never answered, never rebelled and never complained.\nShe merely tried to shield her face and suppressed all shrieks, lest\nthe neighbors should come; her pride could not endure that. When her\nfather was tired kicking her about the room she lay where he left her\nuntil she had strength to rise, and then she went steadily about her\nwork, washing the children and making her soup, sweeping and dusting\nuntil everything was clean. It was a part of her plan of life to be\nbeaten every day.\n\nGervaise had conceived a strong affection for this little neighbor.\nShe treated her like a woman who knew something of life. It must be\nadmitted that Lalie was large for her years. She was fair and pale,\nwith solemn eyes for her years and had a delicate mouth. To have heard\nher talk one would have thought her thirty. She could make and mend,\nand she talked of the children as if she had herself brought them into\nthe world. She made people laugh sometimes when she talked, but more\noften she brought tears to their eyes.\n\nGervaise did everything she could for her, gave her what she could\nand helped the energetic little soul with her work. One day she was\naltering a dress of Nana's for her, and when the child tried it on\nGervaise was chilled with horror at seeing her whole back purple and\nbruised, the tiny arm bleeding--all the innocent flesh of childhood\nmartyrized by the brute--her father.\n\nBazonge might get the coffin ready, she thought, for the little girl\ncould not bear this long. But Lalie entreated her friend to say\nnothing, telling her that her father did not know what he was doing,\nthat he had been drinking. She forgave him with her whole heart,\nfor madmen must not be held accountable for their deeds. After that\nGervaise was on the watch whenever she heard Bijard coming up the\nstairs. But she never caught him in any act of absolute brutality.\nSeveral times she had found Lalie tied to the foot of the bedstead--an\nidea that had entered her father's brain, no one knew why, a whim of\nhis disordered brain, disordered by liquor, which probably arose from\nhis wish to tyrannize over the child, even when he was no longer\nthere.\n\nLalie sometimes was left there all day and once all night. When\nGervaise insisted on untying her the child entreated her not to touch\nthe knots, saying that her father would be furious if he found the\nknots had been tampered with.\n\nAnd really, she said with an angelic smile, she needed rest, and the\nonly thing that troubled her was not to be able to put the room in\norder. She could watch the children just as well, and she could think,\nso that her time was not entirely lost. When her father let her free,\nher sufferings were not over, for it was sometimes more than an hour\nbefore she could stand--before the blood circulated freely in her\nstiffened limbs.\n\nHer father had invented another cheerful game. He heated some sous red\nhot on the stove and laid them on the chimney piece. He then summoned\nLalie and bade her go buy some bread. The child unsuspiciously took up\nthe sous, uttered a little shriek and dropped them, shaking her poor\nburned fingers.\n\nThen he would go off in a rage. What did she mean by such nonsense?\nShe had thrown away the money and lost it, and he threatened her with\na hiding if she did not find the money instantly. The poor child\nhesitated; he gave her a cuff on the side of the head. With silent\ntears streaming down her cheeks she would pick up the sous and toss\nthem from hand to hand to cool them as she went down the long flights\nof stairs.\n\nThere was no limit to the strange ingenuity of the man. One afternoon,\nfor example, Lalie had completed playing with the children. The window\nwas open, and the air shook the door so that it sounded like gentle\nraps.\n\n\"It is Mr Wind,\" said Lalie; \"come in, Mr Wind. How are you today?\"\n\nAnd she made a low curtsy to Mr Wind. The children did the same in\nhigh glee, and she was quite radiant with happiness, which was not\noften the case.\n\n\"Come in, Mr Wind!\" she repeated, but the door was pushed open by\na rough hand and Bijard entered. Then a sudden change came over the\nscene. The two children crouched in a corner, while Lalie stood in the\ncenter of the floor, frozen stiff with terror, for Bijard held in his\nhand a new whip with a long and wicked-looking lash. He laid this whip\non the bed and did not kick either one of the children but smiled in\nthe most vicious way, showing his two lines of blackened, irregular\nteeth. He was very drunk and very noisy.\n\n\"What is the matter with you fools? Have you been struck dumb? I heard\nyou all talking and laughing merrily enough before I came in. Where\nare your tongues now? Here! Take off my shoes!\"\n\nLalie, considerably disheartened at not having received her customary\nkick, turned very pale as she obeyed. He was sitting on the side of\nthe bed. He lay down without undressing and watched the child as she\nmoved about the room. Troubled by this strange conduct, the child\nended by breaking a cup. Then without disturbing himself he took up\nthe whip and showed it to her.\n\n\"Look here, fool,\" he said grimly: \"I bought this for you, and it cost\nme fifty sous, but I expect to get a good deal more than fifty sous'\nworth of good out of it. With this long lash I need not run about\nafter you, for I can reach you in every corner of the room. You will\nbreak the cups, will you? Come, now, jump about a little and say good\nmorning to Mr Wind again!\"\n\nHe did not even sit up in the bed but, with his head buried in the\npillow, snapped the whip with a noise like that made by a postilion.\nThe lash curled round Lalie's slender body; she fell to the floor,\nbut he lashed her again and compelled her to rise.\n\n\"This is a very good thing,\" he said coolly, \"and saves my getting\nchilled on cold mornings. Yes, I can reach you in that corner--and\nin that! Skip now! Skip!\"\n\nA light foam was on his lips, and his suffused eyes were starting\nfrom their sockets. Poor little Lalie darted about the room like a\nterrified bird, but the lash tingled over her shoulders, coiled around\nher slender legs and stung like a viper. She was like an India-rubber\nball bounding from the floor, while her beast of a father laughed\naloud and asked her if she had had enough.\n\nThe door opened and Gervaise entered. She had heard the noise. She\nstood aghast at the scene and then was seized with noble rage.\n\n\"Let her be!\" she cried. \"I will go myself and summon the police.\"\n\nBijard growled like an animal who is disturbed over his prey.\n\n\"Why do you meddle?\" he exclaimed. \"What business is it of yours?\"\n\nAnd with another adroit movement he cut Lalie across the face. The\nblood gushed from her lip. Gervaise snatched a chair and flew at the\nbrute, but the little girl held her skirts and said it did not hurt\nmuch; it would be over soon, and she washed the blood away, speaking\ngently to the frightened children.\n\nWhen Gervaise thought of Lalie she was ashamed to complain. She wished\nshe had the courage of this child. She knew that she had lived on dry\nbread for weeks and that she was so weak she could hardly stand, and\nthe tears came to the woman's eyes as she saw the precocious mite who\nhad known nothing of the innocent happiness of her years. And Gervaise\ntook this slender creature for example, whose eyes alone told the\nstory of her misery and hardships, for in the Coupeau family the\nvitriol of the Assommoir was doing its work of destruction. Gervaise\nhad seen a whip. Gervaise had learned to dread it, and this dread\ninspired her with tenderest pity for Lalie. Coupeau had lost the\nflesh and the bloated look which had been his, and he was thin and\nemaciated. His complexion was gradually acquiring a leaden hue. His\nappetite was utterly gone. It was with difficulty that he swallowed\na mouthful of bread. His stomach turned against all solid food, but\nhe took his brandy every day. This was his meat as well as his drink,\nand he touched nothing else.\n\nWhen he crawled out of his bed in the morning he stood for a good\nfifteen minutes, coughing and spitting out a bitter liquid that rose\nin his throat and choked him.\n\nHe did not feel any better until he had taken what he called \"a good\ndrink,\" and later in the day his strength returned. He felt strange\nprickings in the skin of his hands and feet. But lately his limbs\nhad grown heavy. This pricking sensation gave place to the most\nexcruciating cramps, which he did not find very amusing. He rarely\nlaughed now but often stopped short and stood still on the sidewalk,\ntroubled by a strange buzzing in his ears and by flashes of light\nbefore his eyes. Everything looked yellow to him; the houses seemed to\nbe moving away from him. At other times, when the sun was full on his\nback, he shivered as if a stream of ice water had been poured down\nbetween his shoulders. But the thing he liked the least about himself\nwas a nervous trembling in his hands, the right hand especially.\n\nHad he become an old woman then? he asked himself with sudden fury.\nHe tried with all his strength to lift his glass and command his\nnerves enough to hold it steady. But the glass had a regular tremulous\nmovement from right to left and left to right again, in spite of all\nhis efforts.\n\nThen he emptied it down his throat, saying that when he had swallowed\na dozen more he would be all right and as steady as a monument.\nGervaise told him, on the contrary, that he must leave off drinking\nif he wished to leave off trembling.\n\nHe grew very angry and drank quarts in his eagerness to test the\nquestion, finally declaring that it was the passing omnibusses that\njarred the house and shook his hand.\n\nIn March Coupeau came in one night drenched to the skin. He had been\ncaught out in a shower. That night he could not sleep for coughing.\nIn the morning he had a high fever, and the physician who was sent\nfor advised Gervaise to send him at once to the hospital.\n\nAnd Gervaise made no objection; once she had refused to trust her\nhusband to these people, but now she consigned him to their tender\nmercies without a regret; in fact, she regarded it as a mercy.\n\nNevertheless, when the litter came she turned very pale and, if she\nhad had even ten francs in her pocket, would have kept him at home.\nShe walked to the hospital by the side of the litter and went into\nthe ward where he was placed. The room looked to her like a miniature\nPere-Lachaise, with its rows of beds on either side and its path down\nthe middle. She went slowly away, and in the street she turned and\nlooked up. How well she remembered when Coupeau was at work on those\ngutters, cheerily singing in the morning air! He did not drink in\nthose days, and she, at her window in the Hotel Boncoeur, had\nwatched his athletic form against the sky, and both had waved their\nhandkerchiefs. Yes, Coupeau had worked more than a year on this\nhospital, little thinking that he was preparing a place for himself.\nNow he was no longer on the roof--he had built a dismal nest within.\nGood God, was she and the once-happy wife and mother one and the same?\nHow long ago those days seemed!\n\nThe next day when Gervaise went to make inquiries she found the bed\nempty. A sister explained that her husband had been taken to the\nasylum of Sainte-Anne, because the night before he had suddenly become\nunmanageable from delirium and had uttered such terrible howls that it\ndisturbed the inmates of all the beds in that ward. It was the alcohol\nin his system, she said, which attacked his nerves now, when he was so\nreduced by the inflammation on his lungs that he could not resist it.\n\nThe clearstarcher went home, but how or by what route she never knew.\nHer husband was mad--she heard these words reverberating through her\nbrain. Life was growing very strange. Nana simply said that he must,\nof course, be left at the asylum, for he might murder them both.\n\nOn Sunday only could Gervaise go to Sainte-Anne. It was a long\ndistance off. Fortunately there was an omnibus which went very near.\nShe got out at La Rue Sante and bought two oranges that she might not\ngo quite empty-handed.\n\nBut when she went in, to her astonishment she found Coupeau sitting\nup. He welcomed her gaily.\n\n\"You are better!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes, nearly well,\" he replied, and they talked together awhile, and\nshe gave him the oranges, which pleased and touched him, for he was a\ndifferent man now that he drank tisane instead of liquor. She did not\ndare allude to his delirium, but he spoke of it himself.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"I was in a pretty state! I saw rats running all over\nthe floor and the walls, and you were calling me, and I saw all sorts\nof horrible things! But I am all right now. Once in a while I have a\nbad dream, but everybody does, I suppose.\"\n\nGervaise remained with him until night. When the house surgeon made\nhis rounds at six o'clock he told him to hold out his hands. They\nscarcely trembled--an almost imperceptible motion of the tips of his\nfingers was all. But as the room grew darker Coupeau became restless.\nTwo or three times he sat up and peered into the remote corners.\n\nSuddenly he stretched out his arms and seemed to crush some creature\non the wall.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Gervaise, terribly frightened.\n\n\"Rats!\" he said quietly. \"Only rats!\"\n\nAfter a long silence he seemed to be dropping off to sleep, with\ndisconnected sentences falling from his lips.\n\n\"Dirty beasts! Look out, one is under your skirts!\" He pulled the\ncovering hastily over his head, as if to protect himself against the\ncreature he saw.\n\nThen starting up in mad terror, he screamed aloud. A nurse ran to the\nbed, and Gervaise was sent away, mute with horror at this scene.\n\nBut when on the following Sunday she went again to the hospital,\nCoupeau was really well. All his dreams had vanished. He slept like\na child, ten hours without lifting a finger. His wife, therefore, was\nallowed to take him away. The house surgeon gave him a few words of\nadvice before he left, assuring him if he continued to drink he would\nbe a dead man in three months. All depended on himself. He could live\nat home just as he had lived at Sainte-Anne's and must forget that\nsuch things as wine and brandy existed.\n\n\"He is right,\" said Gervaise as they took their seats in the omnibus.\n\n\"Of course he is right,\" answered her husband. But after a moment's\nsilence he added:\n\n\"But then, you know, a drop of brandy now and then never hurts a man:\nit aids digestion.\"\n\nThat very evening he took a tiny drop and for a week was very\nmoderate; he had no desire, he said, to end his days at Bicetre.\nBut he was soon off his guard, and one day his little drop ended in\na full glass, to be followed by a second, and so on. At the end of\na fortnight he had fallen back in the old rut.\n\nGervaise did her best, but, after all, what can a wife do in such\ncircumstances?\n\nShe had been so startled by the scene at the asylum that she had\nfully determined to begin a regular life again and hoped that he would\nassist her and do the same himself. But now she saw that there was\nno hope, that even the knowledge of the inevitable results could not\nrestrain her husband now.\n\nThen the hell on earth began again; hopeless and intolerant, Nana\nasked indignantly why he had not remained in the asylum. All the money\nshe made, she said, should be spent in brandy for her father, for the\nsooner it was ended, the better for them all.\n\nGervaise blazed out one day when he lamented his marriage and told him\nthat it was for her to curse the day when she first saw him. He must\nremember that she had refused him over and over again. The scene was\na frightful one and one unexampled in the Coupeau annals.\n\nGervaise, now utterly discouraged, grew more indolent every day. Her\nroom was rarely swept. The Lorilleuxs said they could not enter it, it\nwas so dirty. They talked all day long over their work of the downfall\nof Wooden Legs. They gloated over her poverty and her rags.\n\n\"Well! Well!\" they murmured. \"A great change has indeed come to that\nbeautiful blonde who was so fine in her blue shop.\"\n\nGervaise suspected their comments on her and her acts to be most\nunkind, but she determined to have no open quarrel. It was for her\ninterest to speak to them when they met, but that was all the\nintercourse between them.\n\nOn Saturday Coupeau had told his wife he would take her to the circus;\nhe had earned a little money and insisted on indulging himself. Nana\nwas obliged to stay late at the place where she worked and would sleep\nwith her aunt Mme Lerat.\n\nSeven o'clock came, but no Coupeau. Her husband was drinking with his\ncomrades probably. She had washed a cap and mended an old gown with\nthe hope of being presentable. About nine o'clock, in a towering rage,\nshe sallied forth on an empty stomach to find Coupeau.\n\n\"Are you looking for your husband?\" said Mme Boche. \"He is at the\nAssommoir. Boche has just seen him there.\"\n\nGervaise muttered her thanks and went with rapid steps to the\nAssommoir.\n\nA fine rain was falling. The gas in the tavern was blazing brightly,\nlighting up the mirrors, the bottles and glasses. She stood at the\nwindow and looked in. He was sitting at a table with his comrades.\nThe atmosphere was thick with smoke, and he looked stupefied and\nhalf asleep.\n\nShe shivered and wondered why she should stay there and, so thinking,\nturned away, only to come back twice to look again.\n\nThe water lay on the uneven sidewalk in pools, reflecting all the\nlights from the Assommoir. Finally she determined on a bold step: she\nopened the door and deliberately walked up to her husband. After all,\nwhy should she not ask him why he had not kept his promise of taking\nher to the circus? At any rate, she would not stay out there in the\nrain and melt away like a cake of soap.\n\n\"She is crazy!\" said Coupeau when he saw her. \"I tell you, she is\ncrazy!\"\n\nHe and all his friends shrieked with laughter, but no one condescended\nto say what it was that was so very droll. Gervaise stood still, a\nlittle bewildered by this unexpected reception. Coupeau was so amiable\nthat she said:\n\n\"Come, you know it is not too late to see something.\"\n\n\"Sit down a minute,\" said her husband, not moving from his seat.\n\nGervaise saw she could not stand there among all those men, so she\naccepted the offered chair. She looked at the glasses, whose contents\nglittered like gold. She looked at these dirty, shabby men and at the\nothers crowding around the counter. It was very warm, and the pipe\nsmoke thickened the air.\n\nGervaise felt as if she were choking; her eyes smarted, and her head\nwas heavy with the fumes of alcohol. She turned around and saw the\nstill, the machine that created drunkards. That evening the copper\nwas dull and glittered only in one round spot. The shadows of the\napparatus on the wall behind were strange and weird--creatures with\ntails, monsters opening gigantic jaws as if to swallow the whole\nworld.\n\n\"What will you take to drink?\" said Coupeau.\n\n\"Nothing,\" answered his wife. \"You know I have had no dinner!\"\n\n\"You need it all the more then! Have a drop of something!\"\n\nAs she hesitated Mes-Bottes said gallantly:\n\n\"The lady would like something sweet like herself.\"\n\n\"I like men,\" she answered angrily, \"who do not get tipsy and talk\nlike fools! I like men who keep their promises!\"\n\nHer husband laughed.\n\n\"You had better drink your share,\" he said, \"for the devil a bit of\na circus will you see tonight.\"\n\nShe looked at him fixedly. A heavy frown contracted her eyebrows. She\nanswered slowly:\n\n\"You are right; it is a good idea. We can drink up the money\ntogether.\"\n\nBibi brought her a glass of anisette. As she sipped it she remembered\nall at once the brandied fruit she had eaten in the same place with\nCoupeau when he was courting her. That day she had left the brandy and\ntook only the fruit, and now she was sitting there drinking liqueur.\n\nBut the anisette was good. When her glass was empty she refused\nanother, and yet she was not satisfied.\n\nShe looked around at the infernal machine behind her--a machine that\nshould have been buried ten fathoms deep in the sea. Nevertheless, it\nhad for her a strange fascination, and she longed to quench her thirst\nwith that liquid fire.\n\n\"What is that you have in your glasses?\" she asked.\n\n\"That, my dear,\" answered her husband, \"is Father Colombe's own\nespecial brew. Taste it.\"\n\nAnd when a glass of the vitriol was brought to her Coupeau bade her\nswallow it down, saying it was good for her.\n\nAfter she had drunk this glass Gervaise was no longer conscious of the\nhunger that had tormented her. Coupeau told her they could go to the\ncircus another time, and she felt she had best stay where she was. It\ndid not rain in the Assommoir, and she had come to look upon the scene\nas rather amusing. She was comfortable and sleepy. She took a third\nglass and then put her head on her folded arms, supporting them on the\ntable, and listened to her husband and his friends as they talked.\n\nBehind her the still was at work with constant drip-drip, and she felt\na mad desire to grapple with it as with some dangerous beast and tear\nout its heart. She seemed to feel herself caught in those copper fangs\nand fancied that those coils of pipe were wound around her own body,\nslowly but surely crushing out her life.\n\nThe whole room danced before her eyes, for Gervaise was now in the\ncondition which had so often excited her pity and indignation with\nothers. She vaguely heard a quarrel arise and a crash of chairs and\ntables, and then Father Colombe promptly turned everyone into the\nstreet.\n\nIt was still raining and a cold, sharp wind blowing. Gervaise lost\nCoupeau, found him and then lost him again. She wanted to go home,\nbut she could not find her way. At the corner of the street she took\nher seat by the side of the gutter, thinking herself at her washtub.\nFinally she got home and endeavored to walk straight past the door\nof the concierge, within whose room she was vaguely conscious of\nthe Poissons and Lorilleuxs holding up their hands in disgust at\nher condition.\n\nShe never knew how she got up those six flights of stairs. But when\nshe turned into her own corridor little Lalie ran toward her with\nloving, extended arms.\n\n\"Dear Madame Gervaise,\" she cried, \"Papa has not come in; please\ncome and see my children. They are sleeping so sweetly!\"\n\nBut when she looked up in the face of the clearstarcher she recoiled,\ntrembling from head to foot. She knew only too well that alcoholic\nsmell, those wandering eyes and convulsed lips.\n\nThen as Gervaise staggered past her without speaking the child's arms\nfell at her side, and she looked after her friend with sad and solemn\neyes.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nLITTLE NANA\n\nNana was growing fast--fair, fresh and dimpled--her skin velvety, like\na peach, and eyes so bright that men often asked her if they might not\nlight their pipes at them. Her mass of blonde hair--the color of ripe\nwheat--looked around her temples as if it were powdered with gold.\nShe had a quaint little trick of sticking out the tip of her tongue\nbetween her white teeth, and this habit, for some reason, exasperated\nher mother.\n\nShe was very fond of finery and very coquettish. In this house, where\nbread was not always to be got, it was difficult for her to indulge\nher caprices in the matter of costume, but she did wonders. She\nbrought home odds and ends of ribbons from the shop where she worked\nand made them up into bows and knots with which she ornamented her\ndirty dresses. She was not overparticular in washing her feet, but\nshe wore her boots so tight that she suffered martyrdom in honor of\nSt Crispin, and if anyone asked her what the matter was when the pain\nflushed her face suddenly, she always and promptly laid it to the\nscore of the colic.\n\nSummer was the season of her triumphs. In a calico dress that cost\nfive or six francs she was as fresh and sweet as a spring morning and\nmade the dull street radiant with her youth and her beauty. She went\nby the name of \"The Little Chicken.\" One gown, in particular, suited\nher to perfection. It was white with rose-colored dots, without\ntrimming of any kind. The skirt was short and showed her feet. The\nsleeves were very wide and displayed her arms to the elbows. She\nturned the neck away and fastened it with pins--in a corner in the\ncorridor, dreading her father's jests--to exhibit her pretty rounded\nthroat. A rose-colored ribbon, knotted in the rippling masses of her\nhair, completed her toilet. She was a charming combination of child\nand woman.\n\nSundays at this period of her life were her days for coquetting with\nthe public. She looked forward to them all the week through with a\nlonging for liberty and fresh air.\n\nEarly in the morning she began her preparations and stood for hours in\nher chemise before the bit of broken mirror nailed by the window, and\nas everyone could see her, her mother would be very much vexed and ask\nhow long she intended to show herself in that way.\n\nBut she, quite undisturbed, went on fastening down the little curls on\nher forehead with a little sugar and water and then sewed the buttons\non her boots or took a stitch or two in her frock, barefooted all this\ntime and with her chemise slipping off her rounded shoulders.\n\nHer father declared he would exhibit her as the \"Wild Girl,\" at two\nsous a head.\n\nShe was very lovely in this scanty costume, the color flushing her\ncheeks in her indignation at her father's sometimes coarse remarks.\nShe did not dare answer him, however, but bit off her thread in silent\nrage. After breakfast she went down to the courtyard. The house was\nwrapped in Sunday quiet; the workshops on the lower floor were closed.\nThrough some of the open windows the tables were seen laid for\ndinners, the families being on the fortifications \"getting an\nappetite.\"\n\nFive or six girls--Nana, Pauline and others--lingered in the courtyard\nfor a time and then took flight altogether into the streets and thence\nto the outer boulevards. They walked in a line, filling up the whole\nsidewalk, with ribbons fluttering in their uncovered hair.\n\nThey managed to see everybody and everything through their downcast\nlids. The streets were their native heath, as it were, for they had\ngrown up in them.\n\nNana walked in the center and gave her arm to Pauline, and as they\nwere the oldest and tallest of the band, they gave the law to the\nothers and decided where they should go for the day and what they\nshould do.\n\nNana and Pauline were deep ones. They did nothing without\npremeditation. If they ran it was to show their slender ankles, and\nwhen they stopped and panted for breath it was sure to be at the side\nof some youths--young workmen of their acquaintance--who smoked in\ntheir faces as they talked. Nana had her favorite, whom she always\nsaw at a great distance--Victor Fauconnier--and Pauline adored a\nyoung cabinetmaker, who gave her apples.\n\nToward sunset the great pleasure of the day began. A band of\nmountebanks would spread a well-worn carpet, and a circle was formed\nto look on. Nana and Pauline were always in the thickest of the\ncrowd, their pretty fresh dresses crushed between dirty blouses, but\ninsensible to the mingled odors of dust and alcohol, tobacco and dirt.\nThey heard vile language; it did not disturb them; it was their own\ntongue--they heard little else. They listened to it with a smile,\ntheir delicate cheeks unflushed.\n\nThe only thing that disturbed them was the appearance of their\nfathers, particularly if these fathers seemed to have been drinking.\nThey kept a good lookout for this disaster.\n\n\"Look!\" cried Pauline. \"Your father is coming, Nana.\"\n\nThen the girl would crouch on her knees and bid the others stand\nclose around her, and when he had passed on after an inquiring look\nshe would jump up and they would all utter peals of laughter.\n\nBut one day Nana was kicked home by her father, and Boche dragged\nPauline away by her ear.\n\nThe girls would ordinarily return to the courtyard in the twilight and\nestablish themselves there with the air of not having been away, and\neach invented a story with which to greet their questioning parents.\nNana now received forty sous per day at the place where she had been\napprenticed. The Coupeaus would not allow her to change, because she\nwas there under the supervision of her aunt, Mme Lerat, who had been\nemployed for many years in the same establishment.\n\nThe girl went off at an early hour in her little black dress, which\nwas too short and too tight for her, and Mme Lerat was bidden,\nwhenever she was after her time, to inform Gervaise, who allowed her\njust twenty minutes, which was quite long enough. But she was often\nseven or eight minutes late, and she spent her whole day coaxing her\naunt not to tell her mother. Mme Lerat, who was fond of the girl and\nunderstood the follies of youth, did not tell, but at the same time\nshe read Nana many a long sermon on her follies and talked of her own\nresponsibility and of the dangers a young girl ran in Paris.\n\n\"You must tell me everything,\" she said. \"I am too indulgent to you,\nand if evil should come of it I should throw myself into the Seine.\nUnderstand me, my little kitten; if a man should speak to you you must\npromise to tell me every word he says. Will you swear to do this?\"\n\nNana laughed an equivocal little laugh. Oh yes, she would promise. But\nmen never spoke to her; she walked too fast for that. What could they\nsay to her? And she explained her irregularity in coming--her five or\nten minutes delay--with an innocent little air. She had stopped at a\nwindow to look at pictures or she had stopped to talk to Pauline. Her\naunt might follow her if she did not believe her.\n\n\"Oh, I will watch her. You need not be afraid!\" said the widow to her\nbrother. \"I will answer for her, as I would for myself!\"\n\nThe place where the aunt and niece worked side by side was a large\nroom with a long table down the center. Shelves against the wall were\npiled with boxes and bundles--all covered with a thick coating of\ndust. The gas had blackened the ceiling. The two windows were so large\nthat the women, seated at the table, could see all that was going on\nin the street below.\n\nMme Lerat was the first to make her appearance in the morning, but in\nanother fifteen minutes all the others were there. One morning in July\nNana came in last, which, however, was the usual case.\n\n\"I shall be glad when I have a carriage!\" she said as she ran to the\nwindow without even taking off her hat--a shabby little straw.\n\n\"What are you looking at?\" asked her aunt suspiciously. \"Did your\nfather come with you?\"\n\n\"No indeed,\" answered Nana carelessly; \"nor am I looking at anything.\nIt is awfully warm, and of all things in the world, I hate to be in a\nhurry.\"\n\nThe morning was indeed frightfully hot. The workwomen had closed the\nblinds, leaving a crack, however, through which they could inspect the\nstreet, and they took their seats on each side of the table--Mme Lerat\nat the farther end. There were eight girls, four on either side, each\nwith her little pot of glue, her pincers and other tools; heaps of\nwires of different lengths and sizes lay on the table, spools of\ncotton and of different-colored papers, petals and leaves cut out of\nsilk, velvet and satin. In the center, in a goblet, one of the girls\nhad placed a two-sou bouquet,--which was slowly withering in the heat.\n\n\"Did you know,\" said Leonie as she picked up a rose leaf with her\npincers, \"how wretched poor Caroline is with that fellow who used\nto call for her regularly every night?\"\n\nBefore anyone could answer Leonie added:\n\n\"Hush! Here comes Madame.\"\n\nAnd in sailed Mme Titreville, a tall, thin woman, who usually remained\nbelow in the shop. Her employees stood in dread terror of her, as she\nwas never known to smile. She went from one to another, finding fault\nwith all; she ordered one woman to pull a marguerite to pieces and\nmake it over and then went out as stiffly and silently as she had\ncome in.\n\n\"Houp! Houp!\" said Nana under her breath, and a giggle ran round the\ntable.\n\n\"Really, young ladies,\" said Mme Lerat, \"you will compel me to severe\nmeasures.\"\n\nBut no one was listening, and no one feared her. She was very\ntolerant. They could say what they pleased, provided they put it\nin decent language.\n\nNana was certainly in a good school! Her instincts, to be sure,\nwere vicious, but these instincts were fostered and developed in\nthis place, as is too often the case when a crowd of girls are\nherded together. It was the story of a basket of apples, the good\nones spoiled by those that were already rotten. If two girls were\nwhispering in a corner, ten to one they were telling some story that\ncould not be told aloud.\n\nNana was not yet thoroughly perverted, but the curiosity which had\nbeen her distinguishing characteristic as a child had not deserted\nher, and she scarcely took her eyes from a girl by the name of Lisa,\nabout whom strange stories were told.\n\n\"How warm it is!\" she exclaimed, suddenly rising and pushing open the\nblinds. Leonie saw a man standing on the sidewalk opposite.\n\n\"Who is that old fellow?\" she said. \"He has been there a full quarter\nof an hour.\"\n\n\"Some fool who has nothing better to do, I suppose,\" said Mme Lerat.\n\"Nana, will you come back to your work? I have told you that you\nshould not go to that window.\"\n\nNana took up her violets, and they all began to watch this man. He was\nwell dressed, about fifty, pale and grave. For a full hour he watched\nthe windows.\n\n\"Look!\" said Leonie. \"He has an eyeglass. Oh, he is very chic. He is\nwaiting for Augustine.\" But Augustine sharply answered that she did\nnot like the old man.\n\n\"You make a great mistake then,\" said Mme Lerat with her equivocal\nsmile.\n\nNana listened to the conversation which followed--reveling in\nindecency--as much at home in it as a fish is in water. All the time\nher fingers were busy at work. She wound her violet stems and fastened\nin the leaves with a slender strip of green paper. A drop of gum--and\nthen behold a bunch of delicate fresh verdure which would fascinate\nany lady. Her fingers were especially deft by nature. No instruction\ncould have imparted this quality.\n\nThe gentleman had gone away, and the workshop settled down into quiet\nonce more. When the bell rang for twelve Nana started up and said she\nwould go out and execute any commissions. Leonie sent for two sous'\nworth of shrimp, Augustine for some fried potatoes, Sophie for a\nsausage and Lisa for a bunch of radishes. As she was going out, her\naunt said quietly:\n\n\"I will go with you. I want something.\"\n\nLo, in the lane running up by the shop was the mysterious stranger.\nNana turned very red, and her aunt drew her arm within her own and\nhurried her along.\n\nSo then he had come for her! Was not this pretty behavior for a girl\nof her age? And Mme Lerat asked question after question, but Nana knew\nnothing of him, she declared, though he had followed her for five\ndays.\n\nMme Lerat looked at the man out of the corners of her eyes. \"You must\ntell me everything,\" she said.\n\nWhile they talked they went from shop to shop, and their arms grew\nfull of small packages, but they hurried back, still talking of the\ngentleman.\n\n\"It may be a good thing,\" said Mme Lerat, \"if his intentions are only\nhonorable.\"\n\nThe workwomen ate their breakfast on their knees; they were in no\nhurry, either, to return to their work, when suddenly Leonie uttered\na low hiss, and like magic each girl was busy. Mme Titreville entered\nthe room and again made her rounds.\n\nMme Lerat did not allow her niece after this day to set foot on the\nstreet without her. Nana at first was inclined to rebel, but, on the\nwhole, it rather flattered her vanity to be guarded like a treasure.\nThey had discovered that the man who followed her with such\npersistency was a manufacturer of buttons, and one night the aunt\nwent directly up to him and told him that he was behaving in a most\nimproper manner. He bowed and, turning on his heel, departed--not\nangrily, by any means--and the next day he did as usual.\n\nOne day, however, he deliberately walked between the aunt and the\nniece and said something to Nana in a low voice. This frightened Mme\nLerat, who went at once to her brother and told him the whole story,\nwhereupon he flew into a violent rage, shook the girl until her teeth\nchattered and talked to her as if she were the vilest of the vile.\n\n\"Let her be!\" said Gervaise with all a woman's sense. \"Let her be!\nDon't you see that you are putting all sorts of things into her head?\"\n\nAnd it was quite true; he had put ideas into her head and had taught\nher some things she did not know before, which was very astonishing.\nOne morning he saw her with something in a paper. It was _poudre de\nriz_, which, with a most perverted taste, she was plastering upon\nher delicate skin. He rubbed the whole of the powder into her hair\nuntil she looked like a miller's daughter. Another time she came in\nwith red ribbons to retrim her old hat; he asked her furiously where\nshe got them.\n\nWhenever he saw her with a bit of finery her father flew at her with\ninsulting suspicion and angry violence. She defended herself and her\nsmall possessions with equal violence. One day he snatched from her\na little cornelian heart and ground it to dust under his heel.\n\nShe stood looking on, white and stern; for two years she had longed\nfor this heart. She said to herself that she would not bear such\ntreatment long. Coupeau occasionally realized that he had made a\nmistake, but the mischief was done.\n\nHe went every morning with Nana to the shop door and waited outside\nfor five minutes to be sure that she had gone in. But one morning,\nhaving stopped to talk with a friend on the corner for some time, he\nsaw her come out again and vanish like a flash around the corner. She\nhad gone up two flights higher than the room where she worked and had\nsat down on the stairs until she thought him well out of the way.\n\nWhen he went to Mme Lerat she told him that she washed her hands of\nthe whole business; she had done all she could, and now he must take\ncare of his daughter himself. She advised him to marry the girl at\nonce or she would do worse.\n\nAll the people in the neighborhood knew Nana's admirer by sight. He\nhad been in the courtyard several times, and once he had been seen\non the stairs.\n\nThe Lorilleuxs threatened to move away if this sort of thing went on,\nand Mme Boche expressed great pity for this poor gentleman whom this\nscamp of a girl was leading by the nose.\n\nAt first Nana thought the whole thing a great joke, but at the end of\na month she began to be afraid of him. Often when she stopped before\nthe jeweler's he would suddenly appear at her side and ask her what\nshe wanted.\n\nShe did not care so much for jewelry or ornaments as she did for many\nother things. Sometimes as the mud was spattered over her from the\nwheels of a carriage she grew faint and sick with envious longings\nto be better dressed, to go to the theater, to have a pretty room all\nto herself. She longed to see another side of life, to know something\nof its pleasures. The stranger invariably appeared at these moments,\nbut she always turned and fled, so great was her horror of him.\n\nBut when winter came existence became well-nigh intolerable. Each\nevening Nana was beaten, and when her father was tired of this\namusement her mother scolded. They rarely had anything to eat and\nwere always cold. If the girl bought some trifling article of dress\nit was taken from her.\n\nNo! This life could not last. She no longer cared for her father. He\nhad thoroughly disgusted her, and now her mother drank too. Gervaise\nwent to the Assommoir nightly--for her husband, she said--and remained\nthere. When Nana saw her mother sometimes as she passed the window,\nseated among a crowd of men, she turned livid with rage, because youth\nhas little patience with the vice of intemperance. It was a dreary\nlife for her--a comfortless home and a drunken father and mother. A\nsaint on earth could not have remained there; that she knew very well,\nand she said she would make her escape some fine day, and then perhaps\nher parents would be sorry and would admit that they had pushed her\nout of the nest.\n\nOne Saturday Nana, coming in, found her mother and father in a\ndeplorable condition--Coupeau lying across the bed and Gervaise\nsitting in a chair, swaying to and fro. She had forgotten the dinner,\nand one untrimmed candle lighted the dismal scene.\n\n\"Is that you, girl?\" stammered Gervaise. \"Well, your father will\nsettle with you!\"\n\nNana did not reply. She looked around the cheerless room, at the\ncold stove, at her parents. She did not step across the threshold.\nShe turned and went away.\n\nAnd she did not come back! The next day when her father and mother\nwere sober, they each reproached the other for Nana's flight.\n\nThis was really a terrible blow to Gervaise, who had no longer the\nsmallest motive for self-control, and she abandoned herself at once\nto a wild orgy that lasted three days. Coupeau gave his daughter up\nand smoked his pipe quietly. Occasionally, however, when eating his\ndinner, he would snatch up a knife and wave it wildly in the air,\ncrying out that he was dishonored and then, laying it down as\nsuddenly, resumed eating his soup.\n\nIn this great house, whence each month a girl or two took flight, this\nincident astonished no one. The Lorilleuxs were rather triumphant at\nthe success of their prophecy. Lantier defended Nana.\n\n\"Of course,\" he said, \"she has done wrong, but bless my heart, what\nwould you have? A girl as pretty as that could not live all her days\nin such poverty!\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it!\" cried Mme Lorilleux one evening when they\nwere all assembled in the room of the concierge. \"Wooden Legs sold her\ndaughter out and out. I know it! I have positive proof of what I say.\nThe time that the old gentleman was seen on the stairs he was going to\npay the money. Nana and he were seen together at the Ambigu the other\nnight! I tell you, I know it!\"\n\nThey finished their coffee. This tale might or might not be true; it\nwas not improbable, at all events. And after this it was circulated\nand generally believed in the _Quartier_ that Gervaise had sold\nher daughter.\n\nThe clearstarcher, meanwhile, was going from bad to worse. She had\nbeen dismissed from Mme Fauconnier's and in the last few weeks had\nworked for eight laundresses, one after the other--dismissed from\nall for her untidiness.\n\nAs she seemed to have lost all skill in ironing, she went out by the\nday to wash and by degrees was entrusted with only the roughest work.\nThis hard labor did not tend to beautify her either. She continued to\ngrow stouter and stouter in spite of her scanty food and hard labor.\n\nHer womanly pride and vanity had all departed. Lantier never seemed\nto see her when they met by chance, and she hardly noticed that the\nliaison which had stretched along for so many years had ended in a\nmutual disenchantment.\n\nLantier had done wisely, so far as he was concerned, in counseling\nVirginie to open the kind of shop she had. He adored sweets and could\nhave lived on pralines and gumdrops, sugarplums and chocolate.\n\nSugared almonds were his especial delight. For a year his principal\nfood was bonbons. He opened all the jars, boxes and drawers when he\nwas left alone in the shop; and often, with five or six persons\nstanding around, he would take off the cover of a jar on the counter\nand put in his hand and crunch down an almond. The cover was not put\non again, and the jar was soon empty. It was a habit of his, they all\nsaid; besides, he was subject to a tickling in his throat!\n\nHe talked a great deal to Poisson of an invention of his which was\nworth a fortune--an umbrella and hat in one; that is to say, a hat\nwhich, at the first drops of a shower, would expand into an umbrella.\n\nLantier suggested to Virginie that she should have Gervaise come in\nonce each week to wash the floors, shop and the rooms. This she did\nand received thirty sous each time. Gervaise appeared on Saturday\nmornings with her bucket and brush, without seeming to suffer a single\npang at doing this menial work in the house where she had lived as\nmistress.\n\nOne Saturday Gervaise had hard work. It had rained for three days, and\nall the mud of the streets seemed to have been brought into the shop.\nVirginie stood behind the counter with collar and cuffs trimmed with\nlace. Near her on a low chair lounged Lantier, and he was, as usual,\neating candy.\n\n\"Really, Madame Coupeau,\" cried Virginie, \"can't you do better than\nthat? You have left all the dirt in the corners. Don't you see? Oblige\nme by doing that over again.\"\n\nGervaise obeyed. She went back to the corner and scrubbed it again.\nShe was on her hands and knees, with her sleeves rolled up over her\narms. Her old skirt clung close to her stout form, and the sweat\npoured down her face.\n\n\"The more elbow grease she uses, the more she shines,\" said Lantier\nsententiously with his mouth full.\n\nVirginie, leaning back in her chair with the air of a princess,\nfollowed the progress of the work with half-closed eyes.\n\n\"A little more to the right. Remember, those spots must all be taken\nout. Last Saturday, you know, I was not pleased.\"\n\nAnd then Lantier and Virginie fell into a conversation, while Gervaise\ncrawled along the floor in the dirt at their feet.\n\nMme Poisson enjoyed this, for her cat's eyes sparkled with malicious\njoy, and she glanced at Lantier with a smile. At last she was avenged\nfor that mortification at the lavatory, which had for years weighed\nheavy on her soul.\n\n\"By the way,\" said Lantier, addressing himself to Gervaise, \"I saw\nNana last night.\"\n\nGervaise started to her feet with her brush in her hand.\n\n\"Yes, I was coming down La Rue des Martyrs. In front of me was a young\ngirl on the arm of an old gentleman. As I passed I glanced at her face\nand assure you that it was Nana. She was well dressed and looked\nhappy.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Gervaise in a low, dull voice.\n\nLantier, who had finished one jar, now began another.\n\n\"What a girl that is!\" he continued. \"Imagine that she made me a sign\nto follow with the most perfect self-possession. She got rid of her\nold gentleman in a cafe and beckoned me to the door. She asked me to\ntell her about everybody.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" repeated Gervaise.\n\nShe stood waiting. Surely this was not all. Her daughter must have\nsent her some especial message. Lantier ate his sugarplums.\n\n\"I would not have looked at her,\" said Virginie. \"I sincerely trust,\nif I should meet her, that she would not speak to me for, really,\nit would mortify me beyond expression. I am sorry for you, Madame\nGervaise, but the truth is that Poisson arrests every day a dozen\njust such girls.\"\n\nGervaise said nothing; her eyes were fixed on vacancy. She shook her\nhead slowly, as if in reply to her own thoughts.\n\n\"Pray make haste,\" exclaimed Virginie fretfully. \"I do not care to\nhave this scrubbing going on until midnight.\"\n\nGervaise returned to her work. With her two hands clasped around the\nhandle of the brush she pushed the water before her toward the door.\nAfter this she had only to rinse the floor after sweeping the dirty\nwater into the gutter.\n\nWhen all was accomplished she stood before the counter waiting for\nher money. When Virginie tossed it toward her she did not take it up\ninstantly.\n\n\"Then she said nothing else?\" Gervaise asked.\n\n\"She?\" Lantier exclaimed. \"Who is she? Ah yes, I remember. Nana! No,\nshe said nothing more.\"\n\nAnd Gervaise went away with her thirty sous in her hand, her skirts\ndripping and her shoes leaving the mark of their broad soles on the\nsidewalk.\n\nIn the _Quartier_ all the women who drank like her took her part\nand declared she had been driven to intemperance by her daughter's\nmisconduct. She, too, began to believe this herself and assumed at\ntimes a tragic air and wished she were dead. Unquestionably she had\nsuffered from Nana's departure. A mother does not like to feel that\nher daughter will leave her for the first person who asks her to do\nso.\n\nBut she was too thoroughly demoralized to care long, and soon she had\nbut one idea: that Nana belonged to her. Had she not a right to her\nown property?\n\nShe roamed the streets day after day, night after night, hoping to\nsee the girl. That year half the _Quartier_ was being demolished. All\none side of the Rue des Poissonniers lay flat on the ground. Lantier\nand Poisson disputed day after day on these demolitions. The one\ndeclared that the emperor wanted to build palaces and drive the lower\nclasses out of Paris, while Poisson, white with rage, said the emperor\nwould pull down the whole of Paris merely to give work to the people.\n\nGervaise did not like the improvements, either, or the changes in\nthe dingy _Quartier_, to which she was accustomed. It was, in fact,\na little hard for her to see all these embellishments just when she\nwas going downhill so fast over the piles of brick and mortar, while\nshe was wandering about in search of Nana.\n\nShe heard of her daughter several times. There are always plenty of\npeople to tell you things you do not care to hear. She was told that\nNana had left her elderly friend for the sake of some young fellow.\n\nShe heard, too, that Nana had been seen at a ball in the Grand Salon,\nRue de la Chapelle, and Coupeau and she began to frequent all these\nplaces, one after another, whenever they had the money to spend.\n\nBut at the end of a month they had forgotten Nana and went for their\nown pleasure. They sat for hours with their elbows on a table, which\nshook with the movements of the dancers, amused by the sight.\n\nOne November night they entered the Grand Salon, as much to get warm\nas anything else. Outside it was hailing, and the rooms were naturally\ncrowded. They could not find a table, and they stood waiting until\nthey could establish themselves. Coupeau was directly in the mouth of\nthe passage, and a young man in a frock coat was thrown against him.\nThe youth uttered an exclamation of disgust as he began to dust off\nhis coat with his handkerchief. The blouse worn by Coupeau was\nassuredly none of the cleanest.\n\n\"Look here, my good fellow,\" cried Coupeau angrily, \"those airs\nare very unnecessary. I would have you to know that the blouse of\na workingman can do your coat no harm if it has touched it!\"\n\nThe young man turned around and looked at Coupeau from head to foot.\n\n\"Learn,\" continued the angry workman, \"that the blouse is the only\nwear for a man!\"\n\nGervaise endeavored to calm her husband, who, however, tapped his\nragged breast and repeated loudly:\n\n\"The only wear for a man, I tell you!\"\n\nThe youth slipped away and was lost in the crowd.\n\nCoupeau tried to find him, but it was quite impossible; the crowd was\ntoo great. The orchestra was playing a quadrille, and the dancers were\nbringing up the dust from the floor in great clouds, which obscured\nthe gas.\n\n\"Look!\" said Gervaise suddenly.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Look at that velvet bonnet!\"\n\nQuite at the left there was a velvet bonnet, black with plumes,\nonly too suggestive of a hearse. They watched these nodding plumes\nbreathlessly.\n\n\"Do you not know that hair?\" murmured Gervaise hoarsely. \"I am sure\nit is she!\"\n\nIn one second Coupeau was in the center of the crowd. Yes, it was\nNana, and in what a costume! She wore a ragged silk dress, stained\nand torn. She had no shawl over her shoulders to conceal the fact that\nhalf the buttonholes on her dress were burst out. In spite of all her\nshabbiness the girl was pretty and fresh. Nana, of course, danced on\nunsuspiciously. Her airs and graces were beyond belief. She curtsied\nto the very ground and then in a twinkling threw her foot over her\npartner's head. A circle was formed, and she was applauded\nvociferously.\n\nAt this moment Coupeau fell on his daughter.\n\n\"Don't try and keep me back,\" he said, \"for have her I will!\"\n\nNana turned and saw her father and mother.\n\nCoupeau discovered that his daughter's partner was the young man for\nwhom he had been looking. Gervaise pushed him aside and walked up to\nNana and gave her two cuffs on her ears. One sent the plumed hat on\nthe side; the other left five red marks on that pale cheek. The\norchestra played on. Nana neither wept nor moved.\n\nThe dancers began to grow very angry. They ordered the Coupeau party\nto leave the room.\n\n\"Go,\" said Gervaise, \"and do not attempt to leave us, for so sure\nas you do you will be given in charge of a policeman.\"\n\nThe young man had prudently disappeared.\n\nNana's old life now began again, for after the girl had slept for\ntwelve hours on a stretch, she was very gentle and sweet for a week.\nShe wore a plain gown and a simple hat and declared she would like\nto work at home. She rose early and took a seat at her table by five\no'clock the first morning and tried to roll her violet stems, but her\nfingers had lost their cunning in the six months in which they had\nbeen idle.\n\nThen the gluepot dried up; the petals and the paper were dusty and\nspotted; the mistress of the establishment came for her tools and\nmaterials and made more than one scene. Nana relapsed into utter\nindolence, quarreling with her mother from morning until night.\nOf course an end must come to this, so one fine evening the girl\ndisappeared.\n\nThe Lorilleuxs, who had been greatly amused by the repentance and\nreturn of their niece, now nearly died laughing. If she returned again\nthey would advise the Coupeaus to put her in a cage like a canary.\n\nThe Coupeaus pretended to be rather pleased, but in their hearts they\nraged, particularly as they soon learned that Nana was frequently seen\nin the _Quartier_. Gervaise declared this was done by the girl to\nannoy them.\n\nNana adorned all the balls in the vicinity, and the Coupeaus knew that\nthey could lay their hands on her at any time they chose, but they did\nnot choose and they avoided meeting her.\n\nBut one night, just as they were going to bed, they heard a rap on the\ndoor. It was Nana, who came to ask as coolly as possible if she could\nsleep there. What a state she was in! All rags and dirt. She devoured\na crust of dried bread and fell asleep with a part of it in her\nhand. This continued for some time, the girl coming and going like a\nwill-o'-the-wisp. Weeks and months would elapse without a sign from\nher, and then she would reappear without a word to say where she\nhad been, sometimes in rags and sometimes well dressed. Finally her\nparents began to take these proceedings as a matter of course. She\nmight come in, they said, or stay out, just as she pleased, provided\nshe kept the door shut. Only one thing exasperated Gervaise now, and\nthat was when her daughter appeared with a bonnet and feathers and\na train. This she would not endure. When Nana came to her it must be\nas a simple workingwoman! None of this dearly bought finery should\nbe exhibited there, for these trained dresses had created a great\nexcitement in the house.\n\nOne day Gervaise reproached her daughter violently for the life she\nled and finally, in her rage, took her by the shoulder and shook her.\n\n\"Let me be!\" cried the girl. \"You are the last person to talk to me\nin that way. You did as you pleased. Why can't I do the same?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" stammered the mother.\n\n\"I have never said anything about it because it was none of my\nbusiness, but do you think I did not know where you were when my\nfather lay snoring? Let me alone. It was you who set me the example.\"\n\nGervaise turned away pale and trembling, while Nana composed herself\nto sleep again.\n\nCoupeau's life was a very regular one--that is to say, he did not\ndrink for six months and then yielded to temptation, which brought him\nup with a round turn and sent him to Sainte-Anne's. When he came out\nhe did the same thing, so that in three years he was seven times at\nSainte-Anne's, and each time he came out the fellow looked more broken\nand less able to stand another orgy.\n\nThe poison had penetrated his entire system. He had grown very thin;\nhis cheeks were hollow and his eyes inflamed. Those who knew his age\nshuddered as they saw him pass, bent and decrepit as a man of eighty.\nThe trembling of his hands had so increased that some days he was\nobliged to use them both in raising his glass to his lips. This\nannoyed him intensely and seemed to be the only symptom of his failing\nhealth which disturbed him. He sometimes swore violently at these\nunruly members and at others sat for hours looking at these fluttering\nhands as if trying to discover by what strange mechanism they were\nmoved. And one night Gervaise found him sitting in this way with great\ntears pouring down his withered cheeks.\n\nThe last summer of his life was especially trying to Coupeau. His\nvoice was entirely changed; he was deaf in one ear, and some days he\ncould not see and was obliged to feel his way up and downstairs as\nif he were blind. He suffered from maddening headaches, and sudden\npains would dart through his limbs, causing him to snatch at a chair\nfor support. Sometimes after one of these attacks his arm would be\nparalyzed for twenty-four hours.\n\nHe would lie in bed with even his head wrapped up, silent and\nmoody, like some suffering animal. Then came incipient madness and\nfever--tearing everything to pieces that came in his way--or he would\nweep and moan, declaring that no one loved him, that he was a burden\nto his wife. One evening when his wife and daughter came in he was not\nin his bed; in his place lay the bolster carefully tucked in. They\nfound him at last crouched on the floor under the bed, with his teeth\nchattering with cold and fear. He told them he had been attacked by\nassassins.\n\nThe two women coaxed him back to bed as if he had been a baby.\n\nCoupeau knew but one remedy for all this, and that was a good stout\nmorning dram. His memory had long since fled; his brain had softened.\nWhen Nana appeared after an absence of six weeks he thought she had\nbeen on an errand around the corner. She met him in the street, too,\nvery often now, without fear, for he passed without recognizing her.\nOne night in the autumn Nana went out, saying she wanted some baked\npears from the fruiterer's. She felt the cold weather coming on, and\nshe did not care to sit before a cold stove. The winter before she\nwent out for two sous' worth of tobacco and came back in a month's\ntime; they thought she would do the same now, but they were mistaken.\nWinter came and went, as did the spring, and even when June arrived\nthey had seen and heard nothing of her.\n\nShe was evidently comfortable somewhere, and the Coupeaus, feeling\ncertain that she would never return, had sold her bed; it was very\nmuch in their way, and they could drink up the six francs it brought.\n\nOne morning Virginie called to Gervaise as the latter passed the shop\nand begged her to come in and help a little, as Lantier had had two\nfriends to supper the night before, and Gervaise washed the dishes\nwhile Lantier sat in the shop smoking. Presently he said:\n\n\"Oh, Gervaise, I saw Nana the other night.\"\n\nVirginie, who was behind the counter, opening and shutting drawer\nafter drawer, with a face that lengthened as she found each empty,\nshook her fist at him indignantly.\n\nShe had begun to think he saw Nana very often. She did not speak, but\nMme Lerat, who had just come in, said with a significant look:\n\n\"And where did you see her?\"\n\n\"Oh, in a carriage,\" answered Lantier with a laugh. \"And I was on the\nsidewalk.\" He turned toward Gervaise and went on:\n\n\"Yes, she was in a carriage, dressed beautifully. I did not recognize\nher at first, but she kissed her hand to me. Her friend this time must\nbe a vicomte at the least. She looked as happy as a queen.\"\n\nGervaise wiped the plate in her hands, rubbing it long and carefully,\nthough it had long since been dry. Virginie, with wrinkled brows,\nwondered how she could pay two notes which fell due the next day,\nwhile Lantier, fat and hearty from the sweets he had devoured, asked\nhimself if these drawers and jars would be filled up again or if the\nruin he anticipated was so near at hand that he would be compelled\nto pull up stakes at once. There was not another praline for him to\ncrunch, not even a gumdrop.\n\nWhen Gervaise went back to her room she found Coupeau sitting on the\nside of the bed, weeping and moaning. She took a chair near by and\nlooked at him without speaking.\n\n\"I have news for you,\" she said at last. \"Your daughter has been seen.\nShe is happy and comfortable. Would that I were in her place!\"\n\nCoupeau was looking down on the floor intently. He raised his head\nand said with an idiotic laugh:\n\n\"Do as you please, my dear; don't let me be any hindrance to you.\nWhen you are dressed up you are not so bad looking after all.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nPOVERTY AND DEGRADATION\n\nThe weather was intensely cold about the middle of January. Gervaise\nhad not been able to pay her rent, due on the first. She had little\nor no work and consequently no food to speak of. The sky was dark and\ngloomy and the air heavy with the coming of a storm. Gervaise thought\nit barely possible that her husband might come in with a little money.\nAfter all, everything is possible, and he had said that he would work.\nGervaise after a little, by dint of dwelling on this thought, had come\nto consider it a certainty. Yes, Coupeau would bring home some money,\nand they would have a good, hot, comfortable dinner. As to herself,\nshe had given up trying to get work, for no one would have her. This\ndid not much trouble her, however, for she had arrived at that point\nwhen the mere exertion of moving had become intolerable to her. She\nnow lay stretched on the bed, for she was warmer there.\n\nGervaise called it a bed. In reality it was only a pile of straw\nin the corner, for she had sold her bed and all her furniture. She\noccasionally swept the straw together with a broom, and, after all,\nit was neither dustier nor dirtier than everything else in the place.\nOn this straw, therefore, Gervaise now lay with her eyes wide open.\nHow long, she wondered, could people live without eating? She was not\nhungry, but there was a strange weight at the pit of her stomach. Her\nhaggard eyes wandered about the room in search of anything she could\nsell. She vaguely wished someone would buy the spider webs which hung\nin all the corners. She knew them to be very good for cuts, but she\ndoubted if they had any market value.\n\nTired of this contemplation, she got up and took her one chair to\nthe window and looked out into the dingy courtyard.\n\nHer landlord had been there that day and declared he would wait only\none week for his money, and if it were not forthcoming he would turn\nthem into the street. It drove her wild to see him stand in his heavy\novercoat and tell her so coldly that he would pack her off at once.\nShe hated him with a vindictive hatred, as she did her fool of a\nhusband and the Lorilleuxs and Poissons. In fact, she hated everyone\non that especial day.\n\nUnfortunately people can't live without eating, and before the woman's\nfamished eyes floated visions of food. Not of dainty little dishes.\nShe had long since ceased to care for those and ate all she could get\nwithout being in the least fastidious in regard to its quality. When\nshe had a little money she bought a bullock's heart or a bit of cheese\nor some beans, and sometimes she begged from a restaurant and made\na sort of panada of the crusts they gave her, which she cooked on a\nneighbor's stove. She was quite willing to dispute with a dog for a\nbone. Once the thought of such things would have disgusted her, but\nat that time she did not--for three days in succession--go without a\nmorsel of food. She remembered how last week Coupeau had stolen a half\nloaf of bread and sold it, or rather exchanged it, for liquor.\n\nShe sat at the window, looking at the pale sky, and finally fell\nasleep. She dreamed that she was out in a snowstorm and could not find\nher way home. She awoke with a start and saw that night was coming on.\nHow long the days are when one's stomach is empty! She waited for\nCoupeau and the relief he would bring.\n\nThe clock struck in the next room. Could it be possible? Was it only\nthree? Then she began to cry. How could she ever wait until seven?\nAfter another half-hour of suspense she started up. Yes, they might\nsay what they pleased, but she, at least, would try to borrow ten\nsous from the Lorilleuxs.\n\nThere was a continual borrowing of small sums in this corridor during\nthe winter, but no matter what was the emergency no one ever dreamed\nof applying to the Lorilleuxs. Gervaise summoned all her courage and\nrapped at the door.\n\n\"Come in!\" cried a sharp voice.\n\nHow good it was there! Warm and bright with the glow of the forge. And\nGervaise smelled the soup, too, and it made her feel faint and sick.\n\n\"Ah, it is you, is it?\" said Mme Lorilleux. \"What do you want?\"\n\nGervaise hesitated. The application for ten sous stuck in her throat,\nbecause she saw Boche seated by the stove.\n\n\"What do you want?\" asked Lorilleux, in his turn.\n\n\"Have you seen Coupeau?\" stammered Gervaise. \"I thought he was here.\"\n\nHis sister answered with a sneer that they rarely saw Coupeau. They\nwere not rich enough to offer him as many glasses of wine as he wanted\nin these days.\n\nGervaise stammered out a disconnected sentence.\n\nHe had promised to come home. She needed food; she needed money.\n\nA profound silence followed. Mme Lorilleux fanned her fire, and her\nhusband bent more closely over his work, while Boche smiled with an\nexpectant air.\n\n\"If I could have ten sous,\" murmured Gervaise.\n\nThe silence continued.\n\n\"If you would lend them to me,\" said Gervaise, \"I would give them back\nin the morning.\"\n\nMme Lorilleux turned and looked her full in the face, thinking to\nherself that if she yielded once the next day it would be twenty sous,\nand who could tell where it would stop?\n\n\"But, my dear,\" she cried, \"you know we have no money and no prospect\nof any; otherwise, of course, we would oblige you.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Lorilleux, \"the heart is willing, but the pockets\nare empty.\"\n\nGervaise bowed her head, but she did not leave instantly. She looked\nat the gold wire on which her sister-in-law was working and at that in\nthe hands of Lorilleux and thought that it would take a mere scrap to\ngive her a good dinner. On that day the room was very dirty and filled\nwith charcoal dust, but she saw it resplendent with riches like the\nshop of a money-changer, and she said once more in a low, soft voice:\n\n\"I will bring back the ten sous. I will, indeed!\" Tears were in her\neyes, but she was determined not to say that she had eaten nothing\nfor twenty-four hours.\n\n\"I can't tell you how much I need it,\" she continued.\n\nThe husband and wife exchanged a look. Wooden Legs begging at their\ndoor! Well! Well! Who would have thought it? Why had they not known it\nwas she when they rashly called out, \"Come in?\" Really, they could not\nallow such people to cross their threshold; there was too much that\nwas valuable in the room. They had several times distrusted Gervaise;\nshe looked about so queerly, and now they would not take their eyes\noff her.\n\nGervaise went toward Lorilleux as she spoke.\n\n\"Take care!\" he said roughly. \"You will carry off some of the\nparticles of gold on the soles of your shoes. It looks really as\nif you had greased them!\"\n\nGervaise drew back. She leaned against the _etagere_ for a moment\nand, seeing that her sister-in-law's eyes were fixed on her hands,\nshe opened them and said in a gentle, weary voice--the voice of a\nwoman who had ceased to struggle:\n\n\"I have taken nothing. You can look for yourself.\"\n\nAnd she went away; the warmth of the place and the smell of the soup\nwere unbearable.\n\nThe Lorilleuxs shrugged their shoulders as the door closed. They\nhoped they had seen the last of her face. She had brought all her\nmisfortunes on her own head, and she had, therefore, no right to\nexpect any assistance from them. Boche joined in these animadversions,\nand all three considered themselves avenged for the blue shop and all\nthe rest.\n\n\"I know her!\" said Mme Lorilleux. \"If I had lent her the ten sous she\nwanted she would have spent it in liquor.\"\n\nGervaise crawled down the corridor with slipshod shoes and slouching\nshoulders, but at her door she hesitated; she could not go in: she was\nafraid. She would walk up and down a little--that would keep her warm.\nAs she passed she looked in at Father Bru, but to her surprise he was\nnot there, and she asked herself with a pang of jealousy if anyone\ncould possibly have asked him out to dine. When she reached the\nBijards' she heard a groan. She went in.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" she said.\n\nThe room was very clean and in perfect order. Lalie that very morning\nhad swept and arranged everything. In vain did the cold blast of\npoverty blow through that chamber and bring with it dirt and disorder.\nLalie was always there; she cleaned and scrubbed and gave to\neverything a look of gentility. There was little money but much\ncleanliness within those four walls.\n\nThe two children were cutting out pictures in a corner, but Lalie was\nin bed, lying very straight and pale, with the sheet pulled over her\nchin.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Gervaise anxiously.\n\nLalie slowly lifted her white lids and tried to speak.\n\n\"Nothing,\" she said faintly; \"nothing, I assure you!\" Then as her eyes\nclosed she added:\n\n\"I am only a little lazy and am taking my ease.\"\n\nBut her face bore the traces of such frightful agony that Gervaise\nfell on her knees by the side of the bed. She knew that the child\nhad had a cough for a month, and she saw the blood trickling from\nthe corners of her mouth.\n\n\"It is not my fault,\" Lalie murmured. \"I thought I was strong enough,\nand I washed the floor. I could not finish the windows though.\nEverything but those are clean. But I was so tired that I was obliged\nto lie down----\"\n\nShe interrupted herself to say:\n\n\"Please see that my children are not cutting themselves with the\nscissors.\"\n\nShe started at the sound of a heavy step on the stairs. Her father\nnoisily pushed open the door. As usual he had drunk too much, and\nin his eyes blazed the lurid flames kindled by alcohol.\n\nWhen he saw Lalie lying down he walked to the corner and took up the\nlong whip, from which he slowly unwound the lash.\n\n\"This is a good joke!\" he said. \"The idea of your daring to go to bed\nat this hour. Come, up with you!\"\n\nHe snapped the whip over the bed, and the child murmured softly:\n\n\"Do not strike me, Papa. I am sure you will be sorry if you do. Do not\nstrike me!\"\n\n\"Up with you!\" he cried. \"Up with you!\"\n\nThen she answered faintly:\n\n\"I cannot, for I am dying.\"\n\nGervaise had snatched the whip from Bijard, who stood with his under\njaw dropped, glaring at his daughter. What could the little fool mean?\nWhoever heard of a child dying like that when she had not even been\nsick? Oh, she was lying!\n\n\"You will see that I am telling you the truth,\" she replied. \"I did\nnot tell you as long as I could help it. Be kind to me now, Papa, and\nsay good-by as if you loved me.\"\n\nBijard passed his hand over his eyes. She did look very strangely--her\nface was that of a grown woman. The presence of death in that cramped\nroom sobered him suddenly. He looked around with the air of a man who\nhad been suddenly awakened from a dream. He saw the two little ones\nclean and happy and the room neat and orderly.\n\nHe fell into a chair.\n\n\"Dear little mother!\" he murmured. \"Dear little mother!\"\n\nThis was all he said, but it was very sweet to Lalie, who had never\nbeen spoiled by overpraise. She comforted him. She told him how\ngrieved she was to go away and leave him before she had entirely\nbrought up her children. He would watch over them, would he not? And\nin her dying voice she gave him some little details in regard to their\nclothes. He--the alcohol having regained its power--listened with\nround eyes of wonder.\n\nAfter a long silence Lalie spoke again:\n\n\"We owe four francs and seven sous to the baker. He must be paid.\nMadame Goudron has an iron that belongs to us; you must not forget it.\nThis evening I was not able to make the soup, but there are bread and\ncold potatoes.\"\n\nAs long as she breathed the poor little mite continued to be the\nmother of the family. She died because her breast was too small to\ncontain so great a heart, and that he lost this precious treasure\nwas entirely her father's fault. He, wretched creature, had kicked\nher mother to death and now, just as surely, murdered his daughter.\n\nGervaise tried to keep back her tears. She held Lalie's hands, and\nas the bedclothes slipped away she rearranged them. In doing so she\ncaught a glimpse of the poor little figure. The sight might have drawn\ntears from a stone. Lalie wore only a tiny chemise over her bruised\nand bleeding flesh; marks of a lash striped her sides; a livid spot\nwas on her right arm, and from head to foot she was one bruise.\n\nGervaise was paralyzed at the sight. She wondered, if there were a God\nabove, how He could have allowed the child to stagger under so heavy\na cross.\n\n\"Madame Coupeau,\" murmured the child, trying to draw the sheet over\nher. She was ashamed, ashamed for her father.\n\nGervaise could not stay there. The child was fast sinking. Her eyes\nwere fixed on her little ones, who sat in the corner, still cutting\nout their pictures. The room was growing dark, and Gervaise fled from\nit. Ah, what an awful thing life was! And how gladly would she throw\nherself under the wheels of an omnibus, if that might end it!\n\nAlmost unconsciously Gervaise took her way to the shop where her\nhusband worked or, rather, pretended to work. She would wait for him\nand get the money before he had a chance to spend it.\n\nIt was a very cold corner where she stood. The sounds of the carriages\nand footsteps were strangely muffled by reason of the fast-falling\nsnow. Gervaise stamped her feet to keep them from freezing. The people\nwho passed offered few distractions, for they hurried by with their\ncoat collars turned up to their ears. But Gervaise saw several women\nwatching the door of the factory quite as anxiously as herself--they\nwere wives who, like herself, probably wished to get hold of a portion\nof their husbands' wages. She did not know them, but it required no\nintroduction to understand their business.\n\nThe door of the factory remained firmly shut for some time. Then it\nopened to allow the egress of one workman; then two, three, followed,\nbut these were probably those who, well behaved, took their wages home\nto their wives, for they neither retreated nor started when they saw\nthe little crowd. One woman fell on a pale little fellow and, plunging\nher hand into his pocket, carried off every sou of her husband's\nearnings, while he, left without enough to pay for a pint of wine,\nwent off down the street almost weeping.\n\nSome other men appeared, and one turned back to warn a comrade, who\ncame gamely and fearlessly out, having put his silver pieces in his\nshoes. In vain did his wife look for them in his pockets; in vain\ndid she scold and coax--he had no money, he declared.\n\nThen came another noisy group, elbowing each other in their haste to\nreach a cabaret, where they could drink away their week's wages. These\nfellows were followed by some shabby men who were swearing under their\nbreath at the trifle they had received, having been tipsy and absent\nmore than half the week.\n\nBut the saddest sight of all was the grief of a meek little woman in\nblack, whose husband, a tall, good-looking fellow, pushed her roughly\naside and walked off down the street with his boon companions, leaving\nher to go home alone, which she did, weeping her very heart out as she\nwent.\n\nGervaise still stood watching the entrance. Where was Coupeau? She\nasked some of the men, who teased her by declaring that he had just\ngone by the back door. She saw by this time that Coupeau had lied to\nher, that he had not been at work that day. She also saw that there\nwas no dinner for her. There was not a shadow of hope--nothing but\nhunger and darkness and cold.\n\nShe toiled up La Rue des Poissonniers when she suddenly heard\nCoupeau's voice and, glancing in at the window of a wineshop, she\nsaw him drinking with Mes-Bottes, who had had the luck to marry\nthe previous summer a woman with some money. He was now, therefore,\nwell clothed and fed and altogether a happy mortal and had Coupeau's\nadmiration. Gervaise laid her hands on her husband's shoulders as\nhe left the cabaret.\n\n\"I am hungry,\" she said softly.\n\n\"Hungry, are you? Well then, eat your fist and keep the other for\ntomorrow.\"\n\n\"Shall I steal a loaf of bread?\" she asked in a dull, dreary tone.\n\nMes-Bottes smoothed his chin and said in a conciliatory voice:\n\n\"No, no! Don't do that; it is against the law. But if a woman\nmanages----\"\n\nCoupeau interrupted him with a coarse laugh.\n\nYes, a woman, if she had any sense, could always get along, and it\nwas her own fault if she starved.\n\nAnd the two men walked on toward the outer boulevard. Gervaise\nfollowed them. Again she said:\n\n\"I am hungry. You know I have had nothing to eat. You must find me\nsomething.\"\n\nHe did not answer, and she repeated her words in a tone of agony.\n\n\"Good God!\" he exclaimed, turning upon her furiously. \"What can I do?\nI have nothing. Be off with you, unless you want to be beaten.\"\n\nHe lifted his fist; she recoiled and said with set teeth:\n\n\"Very well then; I will go and find some man who has a sou.\"\n\nCoupeau pretended to consider this an excellent joke. Yes of course\nshe could make a conquest; by gaslight she was still passably\ngoodlooking. If she succeeded he advised her to dine at the Capucin,\nwhere there was very good eating.\n\nShe turned away with livid lips; he called after her:\n\n\"Bring some dessert with you, for I love cake. And perhaps you can\ninduce your friend to give me an old coat, for I swear it is cold\ntonight.\"\n\nGervaise, with this infernal mirth ringing in her ears, hurried down\nthe street. She was determined to take this desperate step. She had\nonly a choice between that and theft, and she considered that she\nhad a right to dispose of herself as she pleased. The question of\nright and wrong did not present itself very clearly to her eyes.\n\"When one is starving is hardly the time,\" she said to herself, \"to\nphilosophize.\" She walked slowly up and down the boulevard. This part\nof Paris was crowded now with new buildings, between whose sculptured\nfacades ran narrow lanes leading to haunts of squalid misery, which\nwere cheek by jowl with splendor and wealth.\n\nIt seemed strange to Gervaise that among this crowd who elbowed her\nthere was not one good Christian to divine her situation and slip some\nsous into her hand. Her head was dizzy, and her limbs would hardly\nbear her weight. At this hour ladies with hats and well-dressed\ngentlemen who lived in these fine new houses were mingled with the\npeople--with the men and women whose faces were pale and sickly from\nthe vitiated air of the workshops in which they passed their lives.\nAnother day of toil was over, but the days came too often and were\ntoo long. One hardly had time to turn over in one's sleep when the\neverlasting grind began again.\n\nGervaise went with the crowd. No one looked at her, for the men were\nall hurrying home to their dinner. Suddenly she looked up and beheld\nthe Hotel Boncoeur. It was empty, the shutters and doors covered with\nplacards and the whole facade weather-stained and decaying. It was\nthere in that hotel that the seeds of her present life had been sown.\nShe stood still and looked up at the window of the room she had\noccupied and recalled her youth passed with Lantier and the manner\nin which he had left her. But she was young then and soon recovered\nfrom the blow. That was twenty years ago, and now what was she?\n\nThe sight of the place made her sick, and she turned toward\nMontmartre. She passed crowds of workwomen with little parcels in\ntheir hands and children who had been sent to the baker's, carrying\nfour-pound loaves of bread as tall as themselves, which looked like\nshining brown dolls.\n\nBy degrees the crowd dispersed, and Gervaise was almost alone.\nEveryone was at dinner. She thought how delicious it would be to lie\ndown and never rise again--to feel that all toil was over. And this\nwas the end of her life! Gervaise, amid the pangs of hunger, thought\nof some of the fete days she had known and remembered that she had not\nalways been miserable. Once she was pretty, fair and fresh. She had\nbeen a kind and admired mistress in her shop. Gentlemen came to it\nonly to see her, and she vaguely wondered where all this youth and\nthis beauty had fled.\n\nAgain she looked up; she had reached the abattoirs, which were now\nbeing torn down; the fronts were taken away, showing the dark holes\nwithin, the very stones of which reeked with blood. Farther on was\nthe hospital with its high, gray walls, with two wings opening out\nlike a huge fan. A door in the wall was the terror of the whole\n_Quartier_--the Door of the Dead, it was called--through which\nall the bodies were carried.\n\nShe hurried past this solid oak door and went down to the railroad\nbridge, under which a train had just passed, leaving in its rear\na floating cloud of smoke. She wished she were on that train which\nwould take her into the country, and she pictured to herself open\nspaces and the fresh air and expanse of blue sky; perhaps she could\nlive a new life there.\n\nAs she thought this her weary eyes began to puzzle out in the dim\ntwilight the words on a printed handbill pasted on one of the pillars\nof the arch. She read one--an advertisement offering fifty francs for\na lost dog. Someone must have loved the creature very much.\n\nGervaise turned back again. The street lamps were being lit and\ndefined long lines of streets and avenues. The restaurants were all\ncrowded, and people were eating and drinking. Before the Assommoir\nstood a crowd waiting their turn and room within, and as a respectable\ntradesman passed he said with a shake of the head that many a man\nwould be drunk that night in Paris. And over this scene hung the dark\nsky, low and clouded.\n\nGervaise wished she had a few sous: she would, in that case, have gone\ninto this place and drunk until she ceased to feel hungry, and through\nthe window she watched the still with an angry consciousness that all\nher misery and all her pain came from that. If she had never touched\na drop of liquor all might have been so different.\n\nShe started from her reverie; this was the hour of which she must\ntake advantage. Men had dined and were comparatively amiable. She\nlooked around her and toward the trees where--under the leafless\nbranches--she saw more than one female figure. Gervaise watched them,\ndetermined to do what they did. Her heart was in her throat; it seemed\nto her that she was dreaming a bad dream.\n\nShe stood for some fifteen minutes; none of the men who passed looked\nat her. Finally she moved a little and spoke to one who, with his\nhands in his pockets, was whistling as he walked.\n\n\"Sir,\" she said in a low voice, \"please listen to me.\"\n\nThe man looked at her from head to foot and went on whistling louder\nthan before.\n\nGervaise grew bolder. She forgot everything except the pangs of\nhunger. The women under the trees walked up and down with the\nregularity of wild animals in a cage.\n\n\"Sir,\" she said again, \"please listen.\"\n\nBut the man went on. She walked toward the Hotel Boncoeur again,\npast the hospital, which was now brilliantly lit. There she turned\nand went back over the same ground--the dismal ground between the\nslaughterhouses and the place where the sick lay dying. With these\ntwo places she seemed to feel bound by some mysterious tie.\n\n\"Sir, please listen!\"\n\nShe saw her shadow on the ground as she stood near a street lamp. It\nwas a grotesque shadow--grotesque because of her ample proportions.\nHer limp had become, with time and her additional weight, a very\ndecided deformity, and as she moved the lengthening shadow of herself\nseemed to be creeping along the sides of the houses with bows and\ncurtsies of mock reverence. Never before had she realized the change\nin herself. She was fascinated by this shadow. It was very droll, she\nthought, and she wondered if the men did not think so too.\n\n\"Sir, please listen!\"\n\nIt was growing late. Man after man, in a beastly state of\nintoxication, reeled past her; quarrels and disputes filled the air.\n\nGervaise walked on, half asleep. She was conscious of little except\nthat she was starving. She wondered where her daughter was and what\nshe was eating, but it was too much trouble to think, and she shivered\nand crawled on. As she lifted her face she felt the cutting wind,\naccompanied by the snow, fine and dry, like gravel. The storm had\ncome.\n\nPeople were hurrying past her, but she saw one man walking slowly.\nShe went toward him.\n\n\"Sir, please listen!\"\n\nThe man stopped. He did not seem to notice what she said but extended\nhis hand and murmured in a low voice:\n\n\"Charity, if you please!\"\n\nThe two looked at each other. Merciful heavens! It was Father Bru\nbegging and Mme Coupeau doing worse. They stood looking at each\nother--equals in misery. The aged workman had been trying to make up\nhis mind all the evening to beg, and the first person he stopped was\na woman as poor as himself! This was indeed the irony of fate. Was it\nnot a pity to have toiled for fifty years and then to beg his bread?\nTo have been one of the most flourishing laundresses in Paris and then\nto make her bed in the gutter? They looked at each other once more,\nand without a word each went their own way through the fast-falling\nsnow, which blinded Gervaise as she struggled on, the wind wrapping\nher thin skirts around her legs so that she could hardly walk.\n\nSuddenly an absolute whirlwind struck her and bore her breathless\nand helpless along--she did not even know in what direction. When at\nlast she was able to open her eyes she could see nothing through the\nblinding snow, but she heard a step and saw the outlines of a man's\nfigure. She snatched him by the blouse.\n\n\"Sir,\" she said, \"please listen.\"\n\nThe man turned. It was Goujet.\n\nAh, what had she done to be thus tortured and humiliated? Was God in\nheaven an angry God always? This was the last dreg of bitterness in\nher cup. She saw her shadow: her limp, she felt, made her walk like an\nintoxicated woman, which was indeed hard, when she had not swallowed\na drop.\n\nGoujet looked at her while the snow whitened his yellow beard.\n\n\"Come!\" he said.\n\nAnd he walked on, she following him. Neither spoke.\n\nPoor Mme Goujet had died in October of acute rheumatism, and her son\ncontinued to reside in the same apartment. He had this night been\nsitting with a sick friend.\n\nHe entered, lit a lamp and turned toward Gervaise, who stood humbly\non the threshold.\n\n\"Come in!\" he said in a low voice, as if his mother could have heard\nhim.\n\nThe first room was that of Mme Goujet, which was unchanged since her\ndeath. Near the window stood her frame, apparently ready for the old\nlady. The bed was carefully made, and she could have slept there had\nshe returned from the cemetery to spend a night with her son. The room\nwas clean, sweet and orderly.\n\n\"Come in,\" repeated Goujet.\n\nGervaise entered with the air of a woman who is startled at finding\nherself in a respectable place. He was pale and trembling. They\ncrossed his mother's room softly, and when Gervaise stood within\nhis own he closed the door.\n\nIt was the same room in which he had lived ever since she knew\nhim--small and almost virginal in its simplicity. Gervaise dared not\nmove.\n\nGoujet snatched her in his arms, but she pushed him away faintly.\n\nThe stove was still hot, and a dish was on the top of it. Gervaise\nlooked toward it. Goujet understood. He placed the dish on the table,\npoured her out some wine and cut a slice of bread.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she said. \"How good you are!\"\n\nShe trembled to that degree that she could hardly hold her fork.\nHunger gave her eyes the fierceness of a famished beast and to her\nhead the tremulous motion of senility. After eating a potato she burst\ninto tears but continued to eat, with the tears streaming down her\ncheeks and her chin quivering.\n\n\"Will you have some more bread?\" he asked. She said no; she said yes;\nshe did not know what she said.\n\nAnd he stood looking at her in the clear light of the lamp. How old\nand shabby she was! The heat was melting the snow on her hair and\nclothing, and water was dripping from all her garments. Her hair was\nvery gray and roughened by the wind. Where was the pretty white throat\nhe so well remembered? He recalled the days when he first knew her,\nwhen her skin was so delicate and she stood at her table, briskly\nmoving the hot irons to and fro. He thought of the time when she had\ncome to the forge and of the joy with which he would have welcomed\nher then to his room. And now she was there!\n\nShe finished her bread amid great silent tears and then rose to her\nfeet.\n\nGoujet took her hand.\n\n\"I love you, Madame Gervaise; I love you still,\" he cried.\n\n\"Do not say that,\" she exclaimed, \"for it is impossible.\"\n\nHe leaned toward her.\n\n\"Will you allow me to kiss you?\" he asked respectfully.\n\nShe did not know what to say, so great was her emotion.\n\nHe kissed her gravely and solemnly and then pressed his lips upon\nher gray hair. He had never kissed anyone since his mother's death,\nand Gervaise was all that remained to him of the past.\n\nHe turned away and, throwing himself on his bed, sobbed aloud.\nGervaise could not endure this. She exclaimed:\n\n\"I love you, Monsieur Goujet, and I understand. Farewell!\"\n\nAnd she rushed through Mme Goujet's room and then through the street\nto her home. The house was all dark, and the arched door into the\ncourtyard looked like huge, gaping jaws. Could this be the house where\nshe once desired to reside? Had she been deaf in those days, not to\nhave heard that wail of despair which pervaded the place from top to\nbottom? From the day when she first set her foot within the house she\nhad steadily gone downhill.\n\nYes, it was a frightful way to live--so many people herded together,\nto become the prey of cholera or vice. She looked at the courtyard\nand fancied it a cemetery surrounded by high walls. The snow lay white\nwithin it. She stepped over the usual stream from the dyer's, but\nthis time the stream was black and opened for itself a path through\nthe white snow. The stream was the color of her thoughts. But she\nremembered when both were rosy.\n\nAs she toiled up the six long flights in the darkness she laughed\naloud. She recalled her old dream--to work quietly, have plenty to\neat, a little home to herself, where she could bring up her children,\nnever to be beaten, and to die in her bed! It was droll how things had\nturned out. She worked no more; she had nothing to eat; she lived amid\ndirt and disorder. Her daughter had gone to the bad, and her husband\nbeat her whenever he pleased. As for dying in her bed, she had none.\nShould she throw herself out of the window and find one on the\npavement below?\n\nShe had not been unreasonable in her wishes, surely. She had not\nasked of heaven an income of thirty thousand francs or a carriage\nand horses. This was a queer world! And then she laughed again as\nshe remembered that she had once said that after she had worked for\ntwenty years she would retire into the country.\n\nYes, she would go into the country, for she should soon have her\nlittle green corner in Pere-Lachaise.\n\nHer poor brain was disturbed. She had bidden an eternal farewell to\nGoujet. They would never see each other again. All was over between\nthem--love and friendship too.\n\nAs she passed the Bijards' she looked in and saw Lalie lying dead,\nhappy and at peace. It was well with the child.\n\n\"She is lucky,\" muttered Gervaise.\n\nAt this moment she saw a gleam of light under the undertaker's door.\nShe threw it wide open with a wild desire that he should take her as\nwell as Lalie. Bazonge had come in that night more tipsy than usual\nand had thrown his hat and cloak in the corner, while he lay in the\nmiddle of the floor.\n\nHe started up and called out:\n\n\"Shut that door! And don't stand there--it is too cold. What do you\nwant?\"\n\nThen Gervaise, with arms outstretched, not knowing or caring what she\nsaid, began to entreat him with passionate vehemence:\n\n\"Oh, take me!\" she cried. \"I can bear it no longer. Take me, I implore\nyou!\"\n\nAnd she knelt before him, a lurid light blazing in her haggard eyes.\n\nFather Bazonge, with garments stained by the dust of the cemetery,\nseemed to her as glorious as the sun. But the old man, yet half\nasleep, rubbed his eyes and could not understand her.\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" he muttered.\n\n\"Take me,\" repeated Gervaise, more earnestly than before. \"Do you\nremember one night when I rapped on the partition? Afterward I said\nI did not, but I was stupid then and afraid. But I am not afraid now.\nHere, take my hands--they are not cold with terror. Take me and put\nme to sleep, for I have but this one wish now.\"\n\nBazonge, feeling that it was not proper to argue with a lady, said:\n\n\"You are right. I have buried three women today, who would each have\ngiven me a jolly little sum out of gratitude, if they could have put\ntheir hands in their pockets. But you see, my dear woman, it is not\nsuch an easy thing you are asking of me.\"\n\n\"Take me!\" cried Gervaise. \"Take me! I want to go away!\"\n\n\"But there is a certain little operation first, you know----\" And he\npretended to choke and rolled up his eyes.\n\nGervaise staggered to her feet. He, too, rejected her and would have\nnothing to do with her. She crawled into her room and threw herself on\nher straw. She was sorry she had eaten anything and delayed the work\nof starvation.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nTHE HOSPITAL\n\nThe next day Gervaise received ten francs from her son Etienne, who\nhad steady work. He occasionally sent her a little money, knowing that\nthere was none too much of that commodity in his poor mother's pocket.\n\nShe cooked her dinner and ate it alone, for Coupeau did not appear,\nnor did she hear a word of his whereabouts for nearly a week. Finally\na printed paper was given her which frightened her at first, but\nshe was soon relieved to find that it simply conveyed to her the\ninformation that her husband was at Sainte-Anne's again.\n\nGervaise was in no way disturbed. Coupeau knew the way back well\nenough; he would return in due season. She soon heard that he and\nMes-Bottes had spent the whole week in dissipation, and she even felt\na little angry that they had not seen fit to offer her a glass of wine\nwith all their feasting and carousing.\n\nOn Sunday, as Gervaise had a nice little repast ready for the evening,\nshe decided that an excursion would give her an appetite. The letter\nfrom the asylum stared her in the face and worried her. The snow had\nmelted; the sky was gray and soft, and the air was fresh. She started\nat noon, as the days were now short and Sainte-Anne's was a long\ndistance off, but as there were a great many people in the street,\nshe was amused.\n\nWhen she reached the hospital she heard a strange story. It seems that\nCoupeau--how, no one could say--had escaped from the hospital and had\nbeen found under the bridge. He had thrown himself over the parapet,\ndeclaring that armed men were driving him with the point of their\nbayonets.\n\nOne of the nurses took Gervaise up the stairs. At the head she heard\nterrific howls which froze the marrow in her bones.\n\n\"It is he!\" said the nurse.\n\n\"He? Whom do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean your husband. He has gone on like that ever since day before\nyesterday, and he dances all the time too. You will see!\"\n\nAh, what a sight it was! The cell was cushioned from the floor to the\nceiling, and on the floor were mattresses on which Coupeau danced and\nhowled in his ragged blouse. The sight was terrific. He threw himself\nwildly against the window and then to the other side of the cell,\nshaking hands as if he wished to break them off and fling them\nin defiance at the whole world. These wild motions are sometimes\nimitated, but no one who has not seen the real and terrible sight\ncan imagine its horror.\n\n\"What is it? What is it?\" gasped Gervaise.\n\nA house surgeon, a fair and rosy youth, was sitting, calmly taking\nnotes. The case was a peculiar one and had excited a great deal of\nattention among the physicians attached to the hospital.\n\n\"You can stay awhile,\" he said, \"but keep very quiet. He will not\nrecognize you, however.\"\n\nCoupeau, in fact, did not seem to notice his wife, who had not yet\nseen his face. She went nearer. Was that really he? She never would\nhave known him with his bloodshot eyes and distorted features. His\nskin was so hot that the air was heated around him and was as if it\nwere varnished--shining and damp with perspiration. He was dancing,\nit is true, but as if on burning plowshares; not a motion seemed to\nbe voluntary.\n\nGervaise went to the young surgeon, who was beating a tune on the\nback of his chair.\n\n\"Will he get well, sir?\" she said.\n\nThe surgeon shook his head.\n\n\"What is he saying? Hark! He is talking now.\"\n\n\"Just be quiet, will you?\" said the young man. \"I wish to listen.\"\n\nCoupeau was speaking fast and looking all about, as if he were\nexamining the underbrush in the Bois de Vincennes.\n\n\"Where is it now?\" he exclaimed and then, straightening himself,\nhe looked off into the distance.\n\n\"It is a fair,\" he exclaimed, \"and lanterns in the trees, and the\nwater is running everywhere: fountains, cascades and all sorts of\nthings.\"\n\nHe drew a long breath, as if enjoying the delicious freshness of\nthe air.\n\nBy degrees, however, his features contracted again with pain, and\nhe ran quickly around the wall of his cell.\n\n\"More trickery,\" he howled. \"I knew it!\"\n\nHe started back with a hoarse cry; his teeth chattered with terror.\n\n\"No, I will not throw myself over! All that water would drown me!\nNo, I will not!\"\n\n\"I am going,\" said Gervaise to the surgeon. \"I cannot stay another\nmoment.\"\n\nShe was very pale. Coupeau kept up his infernal dance while she\ntottered down the stairs, followed by his hoarse voice.\n\nHow good it was to breathe the fresh air outside!\n\nThat evening everyone in the huge house in which Coupeau had lived\ntalked of his strange disease. The concierge, crazy to hear the\ndetails, condescended to invite Gervaise to take a glass of cordial,\nforgetting that he had turned a cold shoulder upon her for many weeks.\n\nMme Lorilleux and Mme Poisson were both there also. Boche had heard\nof a cabinetmaker who had danced the polka until he died. He had drunk\nabsinthe.\n\nGervaise finally, not being able to make them understand her\ndescription, asked for the table to be moved and there, in the center\nof the loge, imitated her husband, making frightful leaps and horrible\ncontortions.\n\n\"Yes, that was what he did!\"\n\nAnd then everybody said it was not possible that man could keep up\nsuch violent exercise for even three hours.\n\nGervaise told them to go and see if they did not believe her. But\nMme Lorilleux declared that nothing would induce her to set foot\nwithin Sainte-Anne's, and Virginie, whose face had grown longer and\nlonger with each successive week that the shop got deeper into debt,\ncontented herself with murmuring that life was not always gay--in\nfact, in her opinion, it was a pretty dismal thing. As the wine was\nfinished, Gervaise bade them all good night. When she was not speaking\nshe had sat with fixed, distended eyes. Coupeau was before them all\nthe time.\n\nThe next day she said to herself when she rose that she would never go\nto the hospital again; she could do no good. But as midday arrived she\ncould stay away no longer and started forth, without a thought of the\nlength of the walk, so great were her mingled curiosity and anxiety.\n\nShe was not obliged to ask a question; she heard the frightful sounds\nat the very foot of the stairs. The keeper, who was carrying a cup of\ntisane across the corridor, stopped when he saw her.\n\n\"He keeps it up well!\" he said.\n\nShe went in but stood at the door, as she saw there were people there.\nThe young surgeon had surrendered his chair to an elderly gentleman\nwearing several decorations. He was the chief physician of the\nhospital, and his eyes were like gimlets.\n\nGervaise tried to see Coupeau over the bald head of that gentleman.\nHer husband was leaping and dancing with undiminished strength. The\nperspiration poured more constantly from his brow now; that was all.\nHis feet had worn holes in the mattress with his steady tramp from\nwindow to wall.\n\nGervaise asked herself why she had come back. She had been accused the\nevening before of exaggerating the picture, but she had not made it\nstrong enough. The next time she imitated him she could do it better.\nShe listened to what the physicians were saying: the house surgeon\nwas giving the details of the night with many words which she did not\nunderstand, but she gathered that Coupeau had gone on in the same way\nall night. Finally he said this was the wife of the patient. Wherefore\nthe surgeon in chief turned and interrogated her with the air of a\npolice judge.\n\n\"Did this man's father drink?\"\n\n\"A little, sir. Just as everybody does. He fell from a roof when he\nhad been drinking and was killed.\"\n\n\"Did his mother drink?\"\n\n\"Yes sir--that is, a little now and then. He had a brother who died\nin convulsions, but the others are very healthy.\"\n\nThe surgeon looked at her and said coldly:\n\n\"You drink too?\"\n\nGervaise attempted to defend herself and deny the accusation.\n\n\"You drink,\" he repeated, \"and see to what it leads. Someday you\nwill be here, and like this.\"\n\nShe leaned against the wall, utterly overcome. The physician turned\naway. He knelt on the mattress and carefully watched Coupeau; he\nwished to see if his feet trembled as much as his hands. His\nextremities vibrated as if on wires. The disease was creeping on,\nand the peculiar shivering seemed to be under the skin--it would\nease for a minute or two and then begin again. The belly and the\nshoulders trembled like water just on the point of boiling.\n\nCoupeau seemed to suffer more than the evening before. His complaints\nwere curious and contradictory. A million pins were pricking him.\nThere was a weight under the skin; a cold, wet animal was crawling\nover him. Then there were other creatures on his shoulder.\n\n\"I am thirsty,\" he groaned; \"so thirsty.\"\n\nThe house surgeon took a glass of lemonade from a tray and gave it to\nhim. He seized the glass in both hands, drank one swallow, spilling\nthe whole of it at the same time. He at once spat it out in disgust.\n\n\"It is brandy!\" he exclaimed.\n\nThen the surgeon, on a sign from his chief, gave him some water, and\nCoupeau did the same thing.\n\n\"It is brandy!\" he cried. \"Brandy! Oh, my God!\"\n\nFor twenty-four hours he had declared that everything he touched to\nhis lips was brandy, and with tears begged for something else, for it\nburned his throat, he said. Beef tea was brought to him; he refused\nit, saying it smelled of alcohol. He seemed to suffer intense and\nconstant agony from the poison which he vowed was in the air. He asked\nwhy people were allowed to rub matches all the time under his nose,\nto choke him with their vile fumes.\n\nThe physicians watched Coupeau with care and interest. The phantoms\nwhich had hitherto haunted him by night now appeared before him at\nmidday. He saw spiders' webs hanging from the wall as large as the\nsails of a man-of-war. Then these webs changed to nets, whose meshes\nwere constantly contracting only to enlarge again. These nets held\nblack balls, and they, too, swelled and shrank. Suddenly he cried out:\n\n\"The rats! Oh, the rats!\"\n\nThe balls had been transformed to rats. The vile beasts found their\nway through the meshes of the nets and swarmed over the mattress and\nthen disappeared as suddenly as they came.\n\nThe rats were followed by a monkey, who went in and came out from the\nwall, each time so near his face that Coupeau started back in disgust.\nAll this vanished in the twinkling of an eye. He apparently thought\nthe walls were unsteady and about to fall, for he uttered shriek after\nshriek of agony.\n\n\"Fire! Fire!\" he screamed. \"They can't stand long. They are shaking!\nFire! Fire! The whole heavens are bright with the light! Help! Help!\"\n\nHis shrieks ended in a convulsed murmur. He foamed at the mouth. The\nsurgeon in chief turned to the assistant.\n\n\"You keep the temperature at forty degrees?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes sir.\"\n\nA dead silence ensued. Then the surgeon shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Well, continue the same treatment--beef tea, milk, lemonade and\nquinine as directed. Do not leave him, and send for me if there is\nany change.\"\n\nAnd he left the room, Gervaise following close at his heels, seeking\nan opportunity of asking him if there was no hope. But he stalked down\nthe corridor with so much dignity that she dared not approach him.\n\nShe stood for a moment, undecided whether she should go back to\nCoupeau or not, but hearing him begin again the lamentable cry for\nwater:\n\n\"Water, not brandy!\"\n\nShe hurried on, feeling that she could endure no more that day. In the\nstreets the galloping horses made her start with a strange fear that\nall the inmates of Sainte-Anne's were at her heels. She remembered\nwhat the physician had said, with what terrors he had threatened her,\nand she wondered if she already had the disease.\n\nWhen she reached the house the concierge and all the others were\nwaiting and called her into the loge.\n\nWas Coupeau still alive? they asked.\n\nBoche seemed quite disturbed at her answer, as he had made a bet\nthat he would not live twenty-four hours. Everyone was astonished.\nMme Lorilleux made a mental calculation:\n\n\"Sixty hours,\" she said. \"His strength is extraordinary.\"\n\nThen Boche begged Gervaise to show them once more what Coupeau did.\n\nThe demand became general, and it was pointed out to her that she\nought not to refuse, for there were two neighbors there who had not\nseen her representation the night previous and who had come in\nexpressly to witness it.\n\nThey made a space in the center of the room, and a shiver of\nexpectation ran through the little crowd.\n\nGervaise was very reluctant. She was really afraid--afraid of making\nherself ill. She finally made the attempt but drew back again hastily.\n\nNo, she could not; it was quite impossible. Everyone was disappointed,\nand Virginie went away.\n\nThen everyone began to talk of the Poissons. A warrant had been\nserved on them the night before. Poisson was to lose his place. As to\nLantier, he was hovering around a woman who thought of taking the shop\nand meant to sell hot tripe. Lantier was in luck, as usual.\n\nAs they talked someone caught sight of Gervaise and pointed her out to\nthe others. She was at the very back of the loge, her feet and hands\ntrembling, imitating Coupeau, in fact. They spoke to her. She stared\nwildly about, as if awaking from a dream, and then left the room.\n\nThe next day she left the house at noon, as she had done before. And\nas she entered Sainte-Anne's she heard the same terrific sounds.\n\nWhen she reached the cell she found Coupeau raving mad! He was\nfighting in the middle of the cell with invisible enemies. He tried\nto hide himself; he talked and he answered, as if there were twenty\npersons. Gervaise watched him with distended eyes. He fancied himself\non a roof, laying down the sheets of zinc. He blew the furnace with\nhis mouth, and he went down on his knees and made a motion as if he\nhad soldering irons in his hand. He was troubled by his shoes: it\nseemed as if he thought they were dangerous. On the next roofs stood\npersons who insulted him by letting quantities of rats loose. He\nstamped here and there in his desire to kill them and the spiders\ntoo! He pulled away his clothing to catch the creatures who, he said,\nintended to burrow under his skin. In another minute he believed\nhimself to be a locomotive and puffed and panted. He darted toward\nthe window and looked down into the street as if he were on a roof.\n\n\"Look!\" he said. \"There is a traveling circus. I see the lions and\nthe panthers making faces at me. And there is Clemence. Good God,\nman, don't fire!\"\n\nAnd he gesticulated to the men who, he said, were pointing their guns\nat him.\n\nHe talked incessantly, his voice growing louder and louder, higher\nand higher.\n\n\"Ah, it is you, is it? But please keep your hair out of my mouth.\"\n\nAnd he passed his hand over his face as if to take away the hair.\n\n\"Who is it?\" said the keeper.\n\n\"My wife, of course.\"\n\nHe looked at the wall, turning his back to Gervaise, who felt very\nstrange, and looked at the wall to see if she were there! He talked\non.\n\n\"You look very fine. Where did you get that dress? Come here and let\nme arrange it for you a little. You devil! There he is again!\"\n\nAnd he leaped at the wall, but the soft cushions threw him back.\n\n\"Whom do you see?\" asked the young doctor.\n\n\"Lantier! Lantier!\"\n\nGervaise could not endure the eyes of the young man, for the scene\nbrought back to her so much of her former life.\n\nCoupeau fancied, as he had been thrown back from the wall in front,\nthat he was now attacked in the rear, and he leaped over the mattress\nwith the agility of a cat. His respiration grew shorter and shorter,\nhis eyes starting from their sockets.\n\n\"He is killing her!\" he shrieked. \"Killing her! Just see the blood!\"\n\nHe fell back against the wall with his hands wide open before him,\nas if he were repelling the approach of some frightful object. He\nuttered two long, low groans and then fell flat on the mattress.\n\n\"He is dead! He is dead!\" moaned Gervaise.\n\nThe keeper lifted Coupeau. No, he was not dead; his bare feet quivered\nwith a regular motion. The surgeon in chief came in, bringing two\ncolleagues. The three men stood in grave silence, watching the man\nfor some time. They uncovered him, and Gervaise saw his shoulders\nand back.\n\nThe tremulous motion had now taken complete possession of the body as\nwell as the limbs, and a strange ripple ran just under the skin.\n\n\"He is asleep,\" said the surgeon in chief, turning to his colleagues.\n\nCoupeau's eyes were closed, and his face twitched convulsively.\nCoupeau might sleep, but his feet did nothing of the kind.\n\nGervaise, seeing the doctors lay their hands on Coupeau's body,\nwished to do the same. She approached softly and placed her hand\non his shoulder and left it there for a minute.\n\nWhat was going on there? A river seemed hurrying on under that skin.\nIt was the liquor of the Assommoir, working like a mole through\nmuscle, nerves, bone and marrow.\n\nThe doctors went away, and Gervaise, at the end of another hour,\nsaid to the young surgeon:\n\n\"He is dead, sir.\"\n\nBut the surgeon, looking at the feet, said: \"No,\" for those poor feet\nwere still dancing.\n\nAnother hour, and yet another passed. Suddenly the feet were stiff\nand motionless, and the young surgeon turned to Gervaise.\n\n\"He is dead,\" he said.\n\nDeath alone had stopped those feet.\n\nWhen Gervaise went back she was met at the door by a crowd of people\nwho wished to ask her questions, she thought.\n\n\"He is dead,\" she said quietly as she moved on.\n\nBut no one heard her. They had their own tale to tell then. How\nPoisson had nearly murdered Lantier. Poisson was a tiger, and he ought\nto have seen what was going on long before. And Boche said the woman\nhad taken the shop and that Lantier was, as usual, in luck again, for\nhe adored tripe.\n\nIn the meantime Gervaise went directly to Mme Lerat and Mme Lorilleux\nand said faintly:\n\n\"He is dead--after four days of horror.\"\n\nThen the two sisters were in duty bound to pull out their\nhandkerchiefs. Their brother had lived a most dissolute life,\nbut then he was their brother.\n\nBoche shrugged his shoulders and said in an audible voice:\n\n\"Pshaw! It is only one drunkard the less!\"\n\nAfter this day Gervaise was not always quite right in her mind, and\nit was one of the attractions of the house to see her act Coupeau.\n\nBut her representations were often involuntary. She trembled at times\nfrom head to foot and uttered little spasmodic cries. She had taken\nthe disease in a modified form at Sainte-Anne's from looking so long\nat her husband. But she never became altogether like him in the few\nremaining months of her existence.\n\nShe sank lower day by day. As soon as she got a little money from\nany source whatever she drank it away at once. Her landlord decided\nto turn her out of the room she occupied, and as Father Bru was\ndiscovered dead one day in his den under the stairs, M. Marescot\nallowed her to take possession of his quarters. It was there,\ntherefore, on the old straw bed, that she lay waiting for death to\ncome. Apparently even Mother Earth would have none of her. She tried\nseveral times to throw herself out of the window, but death took her\nby bits, as it were. In fact, no one knew exactly when she died or\nexactly what she died of. They spoke of cold and hunger.\n\nBut the truth was she died of utter weariness of life, and Father\nBazonge came the day she was found dead in her den.\n\nUnder his arm he carried a coffin, and he was very tipsy and as gay\nas a lark.\n\n\"It is foolish to be in a hurry, because one always gets what one\nwants finally. I am ready to give you all your good pleasure when your\ntime comes. Some want to go, and some want to stay. And here is one\nwho wanted to go and was kept waiting.\"\n\nAnd when he lifted Gervaise in his great, coarse hands he did it\ntenderly. And as he laid her gently in her coffin he murmured between\ntwo hiccups:\n\n\"It is I--my dear, it is I,\" said this rough consoler of women. \"It is\nI. Be happy now and sleep quietly, my dear!\"\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of L'Assommoir, by Emile Zola\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK L'ASSOMMOIR ***\n\n***** This file should be named 8558-8.txt or 8558-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/8\/5\/5\/8558\/\n\nProduced by Cam Venezuela, Earle Beach, Eric Eldred, and\nthe Distributed Online Proofing Team\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":876,"split":"train"}
