They have only two possessions between them in which they take pride: Della's beautiful long, flowing hair, almost touching to her knees, and Jim's shiny gold watch, which had belonged to his father and grandfather.\nOn Christmas Eve, with only $1.87 in hand, and desperate to find a gift for Jim, Della sells her hair for $20 to a nearby hairdresser named Madame Sofronie, and eventually finds a platinum pocket watch fob chain for Jim's watch for $21. Satisfied with the perfect gift for Jim, Della runs home and begins to prepare pork chops for dinner.\nAt 7 o'clock, Della sits at a table near the door, waiting for Jim to come home. Unusually late, Jim walks in and immediately stops short at the sight of Della, who had previously prayed that she was still pretty to Jim. Della then admits to Jim that she sold her hair to buy him his present. Jim gives Della her present \u2013 an assortment of expensive hair accessories (referred to as \u201cThe Combs\u201d), useless now that her hair is short. Della then shows Jim the chain she bought for him, to which Jim says he sold his watch to get the money to buy her combs. Although Jim and Della are now left with gifts that neither one can use, they realize how far they are willing to go to show their love for each other, and how priceless their love really is.\nThe story ends with the narrator comparing the pair's mutually sacrificial gifts of love with those of the Biblical Magi:\nThe magi, as you know, were wise men \u2013 wonderfully wise men \u2013 who brought gifts to the new-born King of the Jews. They invented the art of giving Christmas presents. Being wise, their gifts were no doubt wise ones, possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication. And here I have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house. But in a last word to the wise of these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest. Of all who give and receive gifts, such as they are wisest. Everywhere they are wisest. They are the Magi.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Gift of the Magi, by O.

HTML version by Jose Menendez.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE GIFT OF THE MAGI\n\nby O. Henry\n\n\n\n\nOne dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all. And sixty cents of it\nwas in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the\ngrocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one's cheeks burned\nwith the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing\nimplied. Three times Della counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven\ncents. And the next day would be Christmas.\n\nThere was clearly nothing to do but flop down on the shabby little\ncouch and howl. So Della did it. Which instigates the moral reflection\nthat life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, with sniffles\npredominating.\n\nWhile the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the first\nstage to the second, take a look at the home. A furnished flat at $8\nper week. It did not exactly beggar description, but it certainly had\nthat word on the lookout for the mendicancy squad.\n\nIn the vestibule below was a letter-box into which no letter would go,\nand an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax a ring.\nAlso appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the name \"Mr.  James\nDillingham Young.\"\n\nThe \"Dillingham\" had been flung to the breeze during a former period of\nprosperity when its possessor was being paid $30 per week. Now, when\nthe income was shrunk to $20, though, they were thinking seriously of\ncontracting to a modest and unassuming D. But whenever Mr. James\nDillingham Young came home and reached his flat above he was called\n\"Jim\" and greatly hugged by Mrs. James Dillingham Young, already\nintroduced to you as Della. Which is all very good.\n\nDella finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag.\nShe stood by the window and looked out dully at a gray cat walking a\ngray fence in a gray backyard. Tomorrow would be Christmas Day, and she\nhad only $1.87 with which to buy Jim a present. She had been saving\nevery penny she could for months, with this result.  Twenty dollars a\nweek doesn't go far. Expenses had been greater than she had calculated.\nThey always are. Only $1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim. Many a\nhappy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him. Something\nfine and rare and sterling--something just a little bit near to being\nworthy of the honor of being owned by Jim.\n\nThere was a pier-glass between the windows of the room. Perhaps you\nhave seen a pierglass in an $8 flat. A very thin and very agile person\nmay, by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal\nstrips, obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks.  Della, being\nslender, had mastered the art.\n\nSuddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass.  Her\neyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its color within\ntwenty seconds. Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its\nfull length.\n\nNow, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in which\nthey both took a mighty pride. One was Jim's gold watch that had been\nhis father's and his grandfather's. The other was Della's hair. Had the\nqueen of Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have\nlet her hair hang out the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her\nMajesty's jewels and gifts. Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all\nhis treasures piled up in the basement, Jim would have pulled out his\nwatch every time he passed, just to see him pluck at his beard from\nenvy.\n\nSo now Della's beautiful hair fell about her rippling and shining like\na cascade of brown waters. It reached below her knee and made itself\nalmost a garment for her. And then she did it up again nervously and\nquickly. Once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a tear or\ntwo splashed on the worn red carpet.\n\nOn went her old brown jacket; on went her old brown hat. With a whirl\nof skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her eyes, she\nfluttered out the door and down the stairs to the street.\n\nWhere she stopped the sign read: \"Mme. Sofronie. Hair Goods of All\nKinds.\" One flight up Della ran, and collected herself, panting.\nMadame, large, too white, chilly, hardly looked the \"Sofronie.\"\n\n\"Will you buy my hair?\" asked Della.\n\n\"I buy hair,\" said Madame. \"Take yer hat off and let's have a sight at\nthe looks of it.\"\n\nDown rippled the brown cascade.\n\n\"Twenty dollars,\" said Madame, lifting the mass with a practised hand.\n\n\"Give it to me quick,\" said Della.\n\nOh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. Forget the hashed\nmetaphor. She was ransacking the stores for Jim's present.\n\nShe found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one else.\nThere was no other like it in any of the stores, and she had turned all\nof them inside out. It was a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in\ndesign, properly proclaiming its value by substance alone and not by\nmeretricious ornamentation--as all good things should do. It was even\nworthy of The Watch. As soon as she saw it she knew that it must be\nJim's. It was like him. Quietness and value--the description applied to\nboth. Twenty-one dollars they took from her for it, and she hurried\nhome with the 87 cents. With that chain on his watch Jim might be\nproperly anxious about the time in any company.  Grand as the watch\nwas, he sometimes looked at it on the sly on account of the old leather\nstrap that he used in place of a chain.\n\nWhen Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to prudence\nand reason. She got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and went\nto work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love. Which\nis always a tremendous task, dear friends--a mammoth task.\n\nWithin forty minutes her head was covered with tiny, close-lying curls\nthat made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy. She looked at\nher reflection in the mirror long, carefully, and critically.\n\n\"If Jim doesn't kill me,\" she said to herself, \"before he takes a\nsecond look at me, he'll say I look like a Coney Island chorus girl.\nBut what could I do--oh! what could I do with a dollar and eighty-seven\ncents?\"\n\nAt 7 o'clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on the back of\nthe stove hot and ready to cook the chops.\n\nJim was never late. Della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on\nthe corner of the table near the door that he always entered. Then she\nheard his step  on the stair away down on the first flight, and she\nturned white for just a moment. She had a habit of saying a little\nsilent prayer about the simplest everyday things, and now she\nwhispered: \"Please God, make him think I am still pretty.\"\n\nThe door opened and Jim stepped in and closed it. He looked thin and\nvery serious. Poor fellow, he was only twenty-two--and to be burdened\nwith a family! He needed a new overcoat and he was without gloves.\n\nJim stopped inside the door, as immovable as a setter at the scent of\nquail. His eyes were fixed upon Della, and there was an expression in\nthem that she could not read, and it terrified her. It was not anger,\nnor surprise, nor disapproval, nor horror, nor any of the sentiments\nthat she had been prepared for. He simply stared at her fixedly with\nthat peculiar expression on his face.\n\nDella wriggled off the table and went for him.\n\n\"Jim, darling,\" she cried, \"don't look at me that way. I had my hair\ncut off and sold because I couldn't have lived through Christmas\nwithout giving you a present. It'll grow out again--you won't mind,\nwill you? I just had to do it. My hair grows awfully fast. Say `Merry\nChristmas!' Jim, and let's be happy. You don't know what a nice--what a\nbeautiful, nice gift I've got for you.\"\n\n\"You've cut off your hair?\" asked Jim, laboriously, as if he had not\narrived at that patent fact yet even after the hardest mental labor.\n\n\"Cut it off and sold it,\" said Della. \"Don't you like me just as well,\nanyhow? I'm me without my hair, ain't I?\"\n\nJim looked about the room curiously.\n\n\"You say your hair is gone?\" he said, with an air almost of idiocy.\n\n\"You needn't look for it,\" said Della. \"It's sold, I tell you--sold and\ngone, too. It's Christmas Eve, boy. Be good to me, for it went for you.\nMaybe the hairs of my head were numbered,\" she went on with sudden\nserious sweetness, \"but nobody could ever count my love for you.  Shall\nI put the chops on, Jim?\"\n\nOut of his trance Jim seemed quickly to wake. He enfolded his Della.\nFor ten seconds let us regard with discreet scrutiny some\ninconsequential object in the other direction. Eight dollars a week or\na million a year--what is the difference? A mathematician or a wit\nwould give you the wrong answer. The magi brought valuable gifts, but\nthat was not among them. This dark assertion will be illuminated later\non.\n\nJim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it upon the table.\n\n\"Don't make any mistake, Dell,\" he said, \"about me. I don't think\nthere's anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that\ncould make me like my girl any less. But if you'll unwrap that package\nyou may see why you had me going a while at first.\"\n\nWhite fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper. And then an\necstatic scream of joy; and then, alas! a quick feminine change to\nhysterical tears and wails, necessitating the immediate employment of\nall the comforting powers of the lord of the flat.\n\nFor there lay The Combs--the set of combs, side and back, that Della\nhad worshipped long in a Broadway window. Beautiful combs, pure\ntortoise shell, with jewelled rims--just the shade to wear in the\nbeautiful vanished hair. They were expensive combs, she knew, and her\nheart had simply craved and yearned over them without the least hope of\npossession. And now, they were hers, but the tresses that should have\nadorned the coveted adornments were gone.\n\nBut she hugged them to her bosom, and at length she was able to look up\nwith dim eyes and a smile and say: \"My hair grows so fast, Jim!\"\n\nAnd then Della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried, \"Oh, oh!\"\n\nJim had not yet seen his beautiful present. She held it out to him\neagerly upon her open palm. The dull precious metal seemed to flash\nwith a reflection of her bright and ardent spirit.\n\n\"Isn't it a dandy, Jim? I hunted all over town to find it. You'll have\nto look at the time a hundred times a day now. Give me your watch.  I\nwant to see how it looks on it.\"\n\nInstead of obeying, Jim tumbled down on the couch and put his hands\nunder the back of his head and smiled.\n\n\"Dell,\" said he, \"let's put our Christmas presents away and keep 'em a\nwhile. They're too nice to use just at present. I sold the watch to get\nthe money to buy your combs. And now suppose you put the chops on.\"\n\nThe magi, as you know, were wise men--wonderfully wise men--who brought\ngifts to the Babe in the manger. They invented the art of giving\nChristmas presents. Being wise, their gifts were no doubt wise ones,\npossibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication. And\nhere I have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two\nfoolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other\nthe greatest treasures of their house.  But in a last word to the wise\nof these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were\nthe wisest. Of all who give and receive gifts, such as they are wisest.\nEverywhere they are wisest. They are the magi.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Gift of the Magi, by O.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":809,"split":"train"}
