Mrs. Ashe has her nephew, Walter, over for a visit and it is discovered that he has scarlet fever. Anxious that her only daughter Amy should not contract the disease, Amy is sent to live with the Carrs where she builds up a particular rapport with the eldest daughter Katy. Following Walter's recovery, Mrs. Ashe decides that she should have a vacation to Europe and asks that Katy be her travel companion. Initially reluctant due to familial obligations, Katy is persuaded by her father to go and is given $300 for the trip.\nBefore she begins her travels, Katy stops in Boston to visit her old friend Rose Red Browne from Hillsover. It is discovered that she has since gotten married to a man named Deniston and had a child by him. Whilst both ladies are affectionate for the baby, they disagree over the natural world which the self-confessed \"Bostonian\" Rose regards with disdain while Katy is enamored by all things natural. A reunion of the Hillsover girls is organised in Rose's house with Mary Silver, Esther Dearbon, Ellen Gray, and Alice Gibbons in attendance. The girls reminisce about their time at Hillsover and it is discovered what has happened to previous characters; Miss Jane is still teaching, Lilly Page is in Europe while Bella is teaching out on the prairies. Rose Red jokes that if Bella is scalped by the Indians, they will know her by her dreadful hair pomatum.\nAfter they meet up, Katy departs on a steamer to England with the Ashes and following a journey where all three experience bouts of seasickness, they eventually come within view of the Irish Coast and start their trip in Europe. Katy's experience in England (Chapter 3 Story Book England) involve her being perplexed by English culture, such as when she discovers a \"fine day\" in England is any day it's not raining and the English muffins Dickens commended in his books are really tasteless. She also does some sight-seeing.\nAfter spending time together with Mrs. Ashe's brother, Ned, they fell in love. When Katy got home, she received a letter from Ned and blushed and ran to her room, leaving Clover and the reader thinking that Katy and Ned may get married in the future.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of What Katy Did Next, by Susan Coolidge\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

It danced on the glossy hair and bright eyes of two\ngirls, who sat together hemming ruffles for a white muslin dress. The\nhalf-finished skirt of the dress lay on the bed; and as each crisp\nruffle was completed, the girls added it to the snowy heap, which looked\nlike a drift of transparent clouds or a pile of foamy white-of-egg\nbeaten stiff enough to stand alone.\n\nThese girls were Clover and Elsie Carr, and it was Clover's first\nevening dress for which they were hemming ruffles. It was nearly two\nyears since a certain visit made by Johnnie to Inches Mills, of which\nsome of you have read in \"Nine Little Goslings;\" and more than three\nsince Clover and Katy had returned home from the boarding-school at\nHillsover.\n\nClover was now eighteen. She was a very small Clover still, but it would\nhave been hard to find anywhere a prettier little maiden than she had\ngrown to be. Her skin was so exquisitely fair that her arms and wrists\nand shoulders, which were round and dimpled like a baby's, seemed cut\nout of daisies or white rose leaves. Her thick, brown hair waved and\ncoiled gracefully about her head. Her smile was peculiarly sweet; and\nthe eyes, always Clover's chief beauty, had still that pathetic look\nwhich made them irresistible to tender-hearted people.\n\nElsie, who adored Clover, considered her as beautiful as girls in\nbooks, and was proud to be permitted to hem ruffles for the dress in\nwhich she was to burst upon the world. Though, as for that, not much\n\"bursting\" was possible in Burnet, where tea-parties of a middle-aged\ndescription, and now and then a mild little dance, represented \"gayety\"\nand \"society.\" Girls \"came out\" very much, as the sun comes out in the\nmorning,--by slow degrees and gradual approaches, with no particular\none moment which could be fixed upon as having been the crisis of the\njoyful event.\n\n\"There,\" said Elsie, adding another ruffle to the pile on the\nbed,--\"there's the fifth done. It's going to be ever so pretty, I think.\nI'm glad you had it all white; it's a great deal nicer.\"\n\n\"Cecy wanted me to have a blue bodice and sash,\" said Clover, \"but I\nwouldn't. Then she tried to persuade me to get a long spray of pink\nroses for the skirt.\"\n\n\"I'm so glad you didn't! Cecy was always crazy about pink roses. I only\nwonder she didn't wear them when she was married!\"\n\nYes; the excellent Cecy, who at thirteen had announced her intention to\ndevote her whole life to teaching Sunday School, visiting the poor, and\nsetting a good example to her more worldly contemporaries, had actually\nforgotten these fine resolutions, and before she was twenty had become\nthe wife of Sylvester Slack, a young lawyer in a neighboring town!\nCecy's wedding and wedding-clothes, and Cecy's house-furnishing had been\nthe great excitement of the preceding year in Burnet; and a fresh\nexcitement had come since in the shape of Cecy's baby, now about two\nmonths old, and named \"Katherine Clover,\" after her two friends. This\nmade it natural that Cecy and her affairs should still be of interest in\nthe Carr household; and Johnnie, at the time we write of, was making her\na week's visit.\n\n\"She _was_ rather wedded to them,\" went on Clover, pursuing the subject\nof the pink roses. \"She was almost vexed when I wouldn't buy the spray.\nBut it cost lots, and I didn't want it in the least, so I stood firm.\nBesides, I always said that my first party dress should be plain white.\nGirls in novels always wear white to their first balls; and fresh\nflowers are a great deal prettier, any way, than artificial. Katy says\nshe'll give me some violets to wear.\"\n\n\"Oh, will she? That will be lovely!\" cried the adoring Elsie. \"Violets\nlook just like you, somehow. Oh, Clover, what sort of a dress do you\nthink I shall have when I grow up and go to parties and things? Won't it\nbe awfully interesting when you and I go out to choose it?\"\n\nJust then the noise of some one running upstairs quickly made the\nsisters look up from their work. Footsteps are very significant at\ntimes, and these footsteps suggested haste and excitement.\n\nAnother moment, the door opened, and Katy dashed in, calling out,\n\"Papa!--Elsie, Clover, where's papa?\"\n\n\"He went over the river to see that son of Mr. White's who broke his\nleg. Why, what's the matter?\" asked Clover.\n\n\"Is somebody hurt?\" inquired Elsie, startled at Katy's agitated looks.\n\n\"No, not hurt, but poor Mrs. Ashe is in such trouble.\"\n\nMrs. Ashe, it should be explained, was a widow who had come to Burnet\nsome months previously, and had taken a pleasant house not far from the\nCarrs'. She was a pretty, lady-like woman, with a particularly graceful,\nappealing manner, and very fond of her one child, a little girl. Katy\nand papa both took a fancy to her at once; and the families had grown\nneighborly and intimate in a short time, as people occasionally do when\ncircumstances are favorable.\n\n\"I'll tell you all about it in a minute,\" went on Katy. \"But first I\nmust find Alexander, and send him off to meet papa and beg him to hurry\nhome.\" She went to the head of the stairs as she spoke, and called\n\"Debby! Debby!\" Debby answered. Katy gave her direction, and then came\nback again to the room where the other two were sitting.\n\n\"Now,\" she said, speaking more collectedly, \"I must explain as fast as I\ncan, for I have got to go back. You know that Mrs. Ashe's little nephew\nis here for a visit, don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, he came on Saturday.\"\n\n\"Well, he was ailing all day yesterday, and to-day he is worse, and she\nis afraid it is scarlet-fever. Luckily, Amy was spending the day with\nthe Uphams yesterday, so she scarcely saw the boy at all; and as soon\nas her mother became alarmed, she sent her out into the garden to play,\nand hasn't let her come indoors since, so she can't have been exposed\nto any particular danger yet. I went by the house on my way down\nstreet, and there sat the poor little thing all alone in the arbor,\nwith her dolly in her lap, looking so disconsolate. I spoke to her over\nthe fence, and Mrs. Ashe heard my voice, and opened the upstairs window\nand called to me. She said Amy had never had the fever, and that the\nvery idea of her having it frightened her to death. She is such a\ndelicate child, you know.\"\n\n\"Oh, poor Mrs. Ashe!\" cried Clover; \"I am so sorry for her! Well, Katy,\nwhat did you do?\"\n\n\"I hope I didn't do wrong, but I offered to bring Amy here. Papa won't\nobject, I am almost sure.\"\n\n\"Why, of course he won't. Well?\"\n\n\"I am going back now to fetch Amy. Mrs. Ashe is to let Ellen, who hasn't\nbeen in the room with the little boy, pack a bagful of clothes and put\nit out on the steps, and I shall send Alexander for it by and by. You\ncan't think how troubled poor Mrs. Ashe was. She couldn't help crying\nwhen she said that Amy was all she had left in the world. And I nearly\ncried too, I was so sorry for her. She was so relieved when I said that\nwe would take Amy. You know she has a great deal of confidence in papa.\"\n\n\"Yes, and in you too. Where will you put Amy to sleep, Katy?\"\n\n\"What do you think would be best? In Dorry's room?\"\n\n\"I think she'd better come in here with you, and I'll go into Dorry's\nroom. She is used to sleeping with her mother, you know, and she would\nbe lonely if she were left to herself.\"\n\n\"Perhaps that will be better, only it is a great bother for you,\nClovy dear.\"\n\n\"I don't mind,\" responded Clover, cheerfully. \"I rather like to change\nabout and try a new room once in a while. It's as good as going on a\njourney--almost.\"\n\nShe pushed aside the half-finished dress as she spoke, opened a drawer,\ntook out its contents, and began to carry them across the entry to\nDorry's room, doing everything with the orderly deliberation that was\ncharacteristic of whatever Clover did. Her preparations were almost\ncomplete before Katy returned, bringing with her little Amy Ashe.\n\nAmy was a tall child of eight, with a frank, happy face, and long light\nhair hanging down her back. She looked like the pictures of \"Alice in\nWonderland;\" but just at that moment it was a very woful little Alice\nindeed that she resembled, for her cheeks were stained with tears and\nher eyes swollen with recent crying.\n\n\"Why, what is the matter?\" cried kind little Clover, taking Amy in her\narms, and giving her a great hug. \"Aren't you glad that you are coming\nto make us a visit? We are.\"\n\n\"Mamma didn't kiss me for good-by,\" sobbed the little girl. \"She didn't\ncome downstairs at all. She just put her head out of the window and\nsaid, 'Good-by; Amy, be very good, and don't make Miss Carr any\ntrouble,' and then she went away. I never went anywhere before without\nkissing mamma for good-by.\"\n\n\"Mamma was afraid to kiss you for fear she might give you the fever,\"\nexplained Katy, taking her turn as a comforter. \"It wasn't because she\nforgot. She felt worse about it than you did, I imagine. You know the\nthing she cares most for is that you shall not be ill as your cousin\nWalter is. She would rather do anything than have that happen. As soon\nas he gets well she will kiss you dozens of times, see if she doesn't.\nMeanwhile, she says in this note that you must write her a little letter\nevery day, and she will hang a basket by a string out of the window, and\nyou and I will go and drop the letters into the basket, and stand by the\ngate and see her pull it up. That will be funny, won't it? We will play\nthat you are my little girl, and that you have a real mamma and a\nmake-believe mamma.\"\n\n\"Shall I sleep with you?\" demanded Amy,\n\n\"Yes, in that bed over there.\"\n\n\"It's a pretty bed,\" pronounced Amy after examining it gravely for a\nmoment. \"Will you tell me a story every morning?\"\n\n[Illustration: \"She was having the measles on the back shelf of the\ncloset, you know.\"]\n\n\"If you don't wake me up too early. My stories are always sleepy\ntill seven o'clock. Let us see what Ellen has packed in that bag,\nand then I'll give you some drawers of your own, and we will put the\nthings away.\"\n\nThe bag was full of neat little frocks and underclothes stuffed hastily\nin all together. Katy took them out, smoothing the folds, and crimping\nthe tumbled ruffles with her fingers. As she lifted the last skirt, Amy,\nwith a cry of joy, pounced on something that lay beneath it.\n\n\"It is Maria Matilda,\" she said, \"I'm glad of that. I thought Ellen\nwould forget her, and the poor child wouldn't know what to do with me\nand her little sister not coming to see her for so long. She was having\nthe measles on the back shelf of the closet, you know, and nobody would\nhave heard her if she had cried ever so loud.\"\n\n\"What a pretty face she has!\" said Katy, taking the doll out of\nAmy's hands.\n\n\"Yes, but not so pretty as Mabel. Miss Upham says that Mabel is the\nprettiest child she ever saw. Look, Miss Clover,\" lifting the other doll\nfrom the table where she had laid it; \"hasn't she got _sweet_ eyes?\nShe's older than Maria Matilda, and she knows a great deal more. She's\nbegun on French verbs!\"\n\n\"Not really! Which ones?\"\n\n\"Oh, only 'J'aime, tu aimes, il aime,' you know,--the same that our\nclass is learning at school. She hasn't tried any but that. Sometimes\nshe says it quite nicely, but sometimes she's very stupid, and I have to\nscold her.\" Amy had quite recovered her spirits by this time.\n\n\"Are these the only dolls you have?\"\n\n\"Oh, please don't call them _that!_\" urged Amy. \"It hurts their feelings\ndreadfully. I never let them know that they are dolls. They think that\nthey are real children, only sometimes when they are very bad I use the\nword for a punishment. I've got several other children. There's old\nRagazza. My uncle named her, and she's made of rag, but she has such bad\nrheumatism that I don't play with her any longer; I just give her\nmedicine. Then there's Effie Deans, she's only got one leg; and Mopsa\nthe Fairy, she's a tiny one made out of china; and Peg of\nLinkinvaddy,--but she don't count, for she's all come to pieces.\"\n\n\"What very queer names your children have!\" said Elsie, who had come in\nduring the enumeration.\n\n\"Yes; Uncle Ned named them. He's a very funny uncle, but he's nice. He's\nalways so much interested in my children.\"\n\n\"There's papa now!\" cried Katy; and she ran downstairs to meet him.\n\n\"Did I do right?\" she asked anxiously after she had told her story.\n\n\"Yes, my dear, perfectly right,\" replied Dr. Carr. \"I only hope Amy was\ntaken away in time. I will go round at once to see Mrs. Ashe and the\nboy; and, Katy, keep away from me when I come back, and keep the others\naway, till I have changed my coat.\"\n\nIt is odd how soon and how easily human beings accustom themselves to a\nnew condition of things. When sudden illness comes, or sudden sorrow, or\na house is burned up, or blown down by a tornado, there are a few hours\nor days of confusion and bewilderment, and then people gather up their\nwits and their courage and set to work to repair damages. They clear\naway ruins, plant, rebuild, very much as ants whose hill has been\ntrodden upon, after running wildly about for a little while, begin all\ntogether to reconstruct the tiny cone of sand which is so important in\ntheir eyes. In a very short time the changes which at first seem so sad\nand strange become accustomed and matter-of-course things which no\nlonger surprise us.\n\nIt seemed to the Carrs after a few days as if they had always had Amy in\nthe house with them. Papa's daily visit to the sick-room, their\navoidance of him till after he had \"changed his coat,\" Amy's lessons and\ngames of play, her dressing and undressing, the walks with the\nmake-believe mamma, the dropping of notes into the little basket, seemed\npart of a system of things which had been going on for a long, long\ntime, and which everybody would miss should they suddenly stop.\n\nBut they by no means suddenly stopped. Little Walter Ashe's case proved\nto be rather a severe one; and after he had begun to mend, he caught\ncold somehow and was taken worse again. There were some serious\nsymptoms, and for a few days Dr. Carr did not feel sure how things would\nturn. He did not speak of his anxiety at home, but kept silence and a\ncheerful face, as doctors know how to do. Only Katy, who was more\nintimate with her father than the rest, guessed that things were going\ngravely at the other house, and she was too well trained to ask\nquestions. The threatening symptoms passed off, however, and little\nWalter slowly got better; but it was a long convalescence, and Mrs. Ashe\ngrew thin and pale before he began to look rosy. There was no one on\nwhom she could devolve the charge of the child. His mother was dead; his\nfather, an overworked business man, had barely time to run up once a\nweek to see about him; there was no one at his home but a housekeeper,\nin whom Mrs. Ashe had not full confidence. So the good aunt denied\nherself the sight of her own child, and devoted her strength and time to\nWalter; and nearly two months passed, and still little Amy remained at\nDr. Carr's.\n\nShe was entirely happy there. She had grown very fond of Katy, and was\nperfectly at home with the others. Phil and Johnnie, who had returned\nfrom her visit to Cecy, were by no means too old or too proud to be\nplay-fellows to a child of eight; and with all the older members of the\nfamily Amy was a chosen pet. Debby baked turnovers, and twisted cinnamon\ncakes into all sorts of fantastic shapes to please her; Alexander would\nlet her drive if she happened to sit on the front seat of the carryall;\nDr. Carr was seldom so tired that he could not tell her a story,--and\nnobody told such nice stories as Dr. Carr, Amy thought; Elsie invented\nall manner of charming games for the hour before bedtime; Clover made\nwonderful capes and bonnets for Mabel and Maria Matilda; and Katy--Katy\ndid all sorts of things.\n\nKaty had a peculiar gift with children which is not easy to define. Some\npeople possess it, and some do not; it cannot be learned, it comes by\nnature. She was bright and firm and equable all at once. She both amused\nand influenced them. There was something about her which excited the\nchildish imagination, and always they felt her sympathy. Amy was a\ntractable child, and intelligent beyond her age, but she was never quite\nso good with any one as with Katy. She followed her about like a little\nlover; she lavished upon her certain special words and caresses which\nshe gave to no one else; and would kneel on her lap, patting Katy's\nshoulders with her soft hand, and cooing up into her face like a happy\ndove, for a half-hour together. Katy laughed at these demonstrations,\nbut they pleased her very much. She loved to be loved, as all\naffectionate people do, but most of all to be loved by a child.\n\nAt last, the long convalescence ended, Walter was carried away to his\nfather, with every possible precaution against fatigue and exposure, and\nan army of workpeople was turned into Mrs. Ashe's house. Plaster was\nscraped and painted, wall-papers torn down, mattresses made over, and\nclothing burned. At last Dr. Carr pronounced the premises in a sanitary\ncondition, and Mrs. Ashe sent for her little girl to come home again.\n\nAmy was overjoyed at the prospect of seeing her mother; but at the last\nmoment she clung to Katy and cried as if her heart would break.\n\n\"I want you too,\" she said. \"Oh, if Dr. Carr would only let you come and\nlive with me and mamma, I should be so happy! I shall be so lone-ly!\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" cried Clover. \"Lonely with mamma, and those poor children of\nyours who have been wondering all these weeks what has become of you!\nThey'll want a great deal of attention at first, I am sure; medicine and\nnew clothes and whippings,--all manner of things. You remember I\npromised to make a dress for Effie Deans out of that blue and brown\nplaid like Johnnie's balmoral. I mean to begin it to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Oh, will you?\"--forgetting her grief--\"that will be lovely. The skirt\nneedn't be _very_ full, you know. Effie doesn't walk much, because of\nonly having one leg. She will be _so_ pleased, for she hasn't had a new\ndress I don't know when.\"\n\nConsoled by the prospect of Effie's satisfaction, Amy departed quite\ncheerfully, and Mrs. Ashe was spared the pain of seeing her only child\nin tears on the first evening of their reunion. But Amy talked so\nconstantly of Katy, and seemed to love her so much, that it put a plan\ninto her mother's head which led to important results, as the next\nchapter will show.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nAN INVITATION.\n\n\nIt is a curious fact, and makes life very interesting, that, generally\nspeaking, none of us have any expectation that things are going to\nhappen till the very moment when they do happen. We wake up some morning\nwith no idea that a great happiness is at hand, and before night it has\ncome, and all the world is changed for us; or we wake bright and\ncheerful, with never a guess that clouds of sorrow are lowering in our\nsky, to put all the sunshine out for a while, and before noon all is\ndark. Nothing whispers of either the joy or the grief. No instinct bids\nus to delay or to hasten the opening of the letter or telegram, or the\nlifting of the latch of the door at which stands the messenger of good\nor ill. And because it may be, and often is, happy tidings that come,\nand joyful things which happen, each fresh day as it dawns upon us is\nlike an unread story, full of possible interest and adventure, to be\nmade ours as soon as we have cut the pages and begun to read.\n\nNothing whispered to Katy Carr, as she sat at the window mending a long\nrent in Johnnie's school coat, and saw Mrs. Ashe come in at the side\ngate and ring the office bell, that the visit had any special\nsignificance for her. Mrs. Ashe often did come to the office to consult\nDr. Carr. Amy might not be quite well, Katy thought, or there might be a\nletter with something about Walter in it, or perhaps matters had gone\nwrong at the house, where paperers and painters were still at work. So\nshe went calmly on with her darning, drawing the \"ravelling,\" with which\nher needle was threaded, carefully in and out, and taking nice even\nstitches without one prophetic thrill or tremor; while, if only she\ncould have looked through the two walls and two doors which separated\nthe room in which she sat from the office, and have heard what Mrs. Ashe\nwas saying, the school coat would have been thrown to the winds, and for\nall her tall stature and propriety, she would have been skipping with\ndelight and astonishment. For Mrs. Ashe was asking papa to let her do\nthe very thing of all others that she most longed to do; she was asking\nhim to let Katy go with her to Europe!\n\n\"I am not very well,\" she told the Doctor. \"I got tired and run down\nwhile Walter was ill, and I don't seem to throw it off as I hoped I\nshould. I feel as if a change would do me good. Don't you think so\nyourself?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" Dr. Carr admitted.\n\n\"This idea of Europe is not altogether a new one,\" continued Mrs. Ashe.\n\"I have always meant to go some time, and have put it off, partly\nbecause I dreaded going alone, and didn't know anybody whom I exactly\nwanted to take with me. But if you will let me have Katy, Dr. Carr, it\nwill settle all my difficulties. Amy loves her dearly, and so do I; she\nis just the companion I need; if I have her with me, I sha'n't be afraid\nof anything. I do hope you will consent.\"\n\n\"How long do you mean to be away?\" asked Dr. Carr, divided between\npleasure at these compliments to Katy and dismay at the idea of\nlosing her.\n\n\"About a year, I think. My plans are rather vague as yet; but my idea\nwas to spend a few weeks in Scotland and England first,--I have some\ncousins in London who will be good to us; and an old friend of mine\nmarried a gentleman who lives on the Isle of Wight; perhaps we might go\nthere. Then we could cross over to France and visit Paris and a few\nother places; and before it gets cold go down to Nice, and from there to\nItaly. Katy would like to see Italy. Don't you think so?\"\n\n\"I dare say she would,\" said Dr. Carr, with a smile. \"She would be a\nqueer girl if she didn't.\"\n\n\"There is one reason why I thought Italy would be particularly pleasant\nthis winter for me and for her too,\" went on Mrs. Ashe; \"and that is,\nbecause my brother will be there. He is a lieutenant in the navy, you\nknow, and his ship, the 'Natchitoches,' is one of the Mediterranean\nsquadron. They will be in Naples by and by, and if we were there at the\nsame time we should have Ned to go about with; and he would take us to\nthe receptions on the frigate, and all that, which would be a nice\nchance for Katy. Then toward spring I should like to go to Florence and\nVenice, and visit the Italian lakes and Switzerland in the early summer.\nBut all this depends on your letting Katy go. If you decide against it,\nI shall give the whole thing up. But you won't decide against\nit,\"--coaxingly,--\"you will be kinder than that. I will take the best\npossible care of her, and do all I can to make her happy, if only you\nwill consent to lend her to me; and I shall consider it _such_ a favor.\nAnd it is to cost you nothing. You understand, Doctor, she is to be my\nguest all through. That is a point I want to make clear in the outset;\nfor she goes for my sake, and I cannot take her on any other conditions.\nNow, Dr. Carr, please, please! I am sure you won't deny me, when I have\nso set my heart upon having her.\"\n\nMrs. Ashe was very pretty and persuasive, but still Dr. Carr hesitated.\nTo send Katy for a year's pleasuring in Europe was a thing that had\nnever occurred to his mind as possible. The cost alone would have\nprevented; for country doctors with six children are not apt to be rich\nmen, even in the limited and old-fashioned construction of the word\n\"wealth.\" It seemed equally impossible to let her go at Mrs. Ashe's\nexpense; at the same time, the chance was such a good one, and Mrs. Ashe\nso much in earnest and so urgent, that it was difficult to refuse point\nblank. He finally consented to take time for consideration before making\nhis decision.\n\n\"I will talk it over with Katy,\" he said. \"The child ought to have a say\nin the matter; and whatever we decide, you must let me thank you in her\nname as well as my own for your great kindness in proposing it.\"\n\n\"Doctor, I'm not kind at all, and I don't want to be thanked. My desire\nto take Katy with me to Europe is purely selfish. I am a lonely person,\"\nshe went on; \"I have no mother or sister, and no cousins of my own age.\nMy brother's profession keeps him at sea; I scarcely ever see him. I\nhave no one but a couple of old aunts, too feeble in health to travel\nwith me or to be counted on in case of any emergency. You see, I am a\nreal case for pity.\"\n\nMrs. Ashe spoke gayly, but her brown eyes were dim with tears as she\nended her little appeal. Dr. Carr, who was soft-hearted where women were\nconcerned, was touched. Perhaps his face showed it, for Mrs. Ashe added\nin a more hopeful tone,--\n\n\"But I won't tease any more. I know you will not refuse me unless you\nthink it right and necessary; and,\" she continued mischievously, \"I have\ngreat faith in Katy as an ally. I am pretty sure that she will say that\nshe wants to go.\"\n\nAnd indeed Katy's cry of delight when the plan was proposed to her said\nthat sufficiently, without need of further explanation. To go to Europe\nfor a year with Mrs. Ashe and Amy seemed simply too delightful to be\ntrue. All the things she had heard about and read about--cathedrals,\npictures, Alpine peaks, famous places, famous people--came rushing into\nher mind in a sort of bewildering tide as dazzling as it was\noverwhelming. Dr. Carr's objections, his reluctance to part with her,\nmelted before the radiance of her satisfaction. He had no idea that\nKaty would care so much about it. After all, it was a great\nchance,--perhaps the only one of the sort that she would ever have.\nMrs. Ashe could well afford to give Katy this treat, he knew; and it\nwas quite true what she said, that it was a favor to her as well as to\nKaty. This train of reasoning led to its natural results. Dr. Carr\nbegan to waver in his mind.\n\nBut, the first excitement over, Katy's second thoughts were more sober\nones. How could papa manage without her for a whole year, she asked\nherself. He would miss her, she well knew, and might not the charge of\nthe house be too much for Clover? The preserves were almost all made,\nthat was one comfort; but there were the winter clothes to be seen to;\nDorry needed new flannels, Elsie's dresses must be altered over for\nJohnnie,--there were cucumbers to pickle, the coal to order! A host of\nhousewifely cares began to troop through Katy's mind, and a little\npucker came into her forehead, and a worried look across the face which\nhad been so bright a few minutes before. Strange to say, it was that\nlittle pucker and the look of worry which decided Dr. Carr.\n\n\"She is only twenty-one,\" he reflected; \"hardly out of childhood. I\ndon't want her to settle into an anxious, drudging state and lose her\nyouth with caring for us all. She shall go; though how we are to manage\nwithout her I don't see. Little Clover will have to come to the fore,\nand show what sort of stuff there is in her.\"\n\n\"Little Clover\" came gallantly \"to the fore\" when the first shock of\nsurprise was over, and she had relieved her mind with one long private\ncry over having to do without Katy for a year. Then she wiped her eyes,\nand began to revel unselfishly in the idea of her sister's having so\ngreat a treat. Anything and everything seemed possible to secure it for\nher; and she made light of all Katy's many anxieties and apprehensions.\n\n\"My dear child, I know a flannel undershirt when I see one, just as well\nas you do,\" she declared. \"Tucks in Johnnie's dress, forsooth! why, of\ncourse. Ripping out a tuck doesn't require any superhuman ingenuity!\nGive me your scissors, and I'll show you at once. Quince marmalade?\nDebby can make that. Hers is about as good as yours; and if it wasn't,\nwhat should we care, as long as you are ascending Mont Blanc, and\nhob-nobbing with Michael Angelo and the crowned heads of Europe? I'll\nmake the spiced peaches! I'll order the kindling! And if there ever\ncomes a time when I feel lost and can't manage without advice, I'll go\nacross to Mrs. Hall. Don't worry about us. We shall get on happily and\neasily; in fact, I shouldn't be surprised if I developed such a turn for\nhousekeeping, that when you come back the family refused to change, and\nyou had just to sit for the rest of your life and twirl your thumbs and\nwatch me do it! Wouldn't that be fine?\" and Clover laughed merrily. \"So,\nKaty darling, cast that shadow from your brow, and look as a girl ought\nto look who's going to Europe. Why, if it were I who were going, I\nshould simply stand on my head every moment of the time!\"\n\n\"Not a very convenient position for packing,\" said Katy, smiling.\n\n\"Yes, it is, if you just turn your trunk upside down! When I think of\nall the delightful things you are going to do, I can hardly sit still. I\n_love_ Mrs. Ashe for inviting you.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" said Katy, soberly. \"It was the kindest thing! I can't think\nwhy she did it.\"\n\n\"Well, I can,\" replied Clover, always ready to defend Katy even against\nherself. \"She did it because she wanted you, and she wanted you because\nyou are the dearest old thing in the world, and the nicest to have\nabout. You needn't say you're not, for you are! Now, Katy, don't waste\nanother thought on such miserable things as pickles and undershirts. We\nshall get along perfectly well, I do assure you. Just fix your mind\ninstead on the dome of St. Peter's, or try to fancy how you'll feel the\nfirst time you step into a gondola or see the Mediterranean. There will\nbe a moment! I feel a forty-horse power of housekeeping developing\nwithin me; and what fun it will be to get your letters! We shall fetch\nout the Encyclopaedia and the big Atlas and the 'History of Modern\nEurope,' and read all about everything you see and all the places you\ngo to; and it will be as good as a lesson in geography and history and\npolitical economy all combined, only a great deal more interesting! We\nshall stick out all over with knowledge before you come back; and this\nmakes it a plain duty to go, if it were only for our sakes.\" With these\nzealous promises, Katy was forced to be content. Indeed, contentment\nwas not difficult with such a prospect of delight before her. When once\nher little anxieties had been laid aside, the idea of the coming\njourney grew in pleasantness every moment. Night after night she and\npapa and the children pored over maps and made out schemes for travel\nand sight-seeing, every one of which was likely to be discarded as soon\nas the real journey began. But they didn't know that, and it made no\nreal difference. Such schemes are the preliminary joys of travel, and\nit doesn't signify that they come to nothing after they have served\ntheir purpose.\n\nKaty learned a great deal while thus talking over what she was to see\nand do. She read every scrap she could lay her hand on which related to\nRome or Florence or Venice or London. The driest details had a charm for\nher now that she was likely to see the real places. She went about with\nscraps of paper in her pocket, on which were written such things as\nthese: \"Forum. When built? By whom built? More than one?\" \"What does\n_Cenacola_ mean?\" \"Cecilia Metella. Who was she?\" \"Find out about Saint\nCatherine of Siena.\" \"Who was Beatrice Cenci?\" How she wished that she\nhad studied harder and more carefully before this wonderful chance came\nto her. People always wish this when they are starting for Europe; and\nthey wish it more and more after they get there, and realize of what\nvalue exact ideas and information and a fuller knowledge of the foreign\nlanguages are to all travellers; how they add to the charm of everything\nseen, and enhance the ease of everything done.\n\nAll Burnet took an interest in Katy's plans, and almost everybody had\nsome sort of advice or help, or some little gift to offer. Old Mrs.\nWorrett, who, though fatter than ever, still retained the power of\nlocomotion, drove in from Conic Section in her roomy carryall with the\npresent of a rather obsolete copy of \"Murray's Guide,\" in faded red\ncovers, which her father had used in his youth, and which she was sure\nKaty would find convenient; also a bottle of Brown's Jamaica Ginger, in\ncase of sea-sickness. Debby's sister-in-law brought a bundle of dried\nchamomile for the same purpose. Some one had told her it was the\n\"handiest thing in the world to take along with you on them steamboats.\"\nCecy sent a wonderful old-gold and scarlet contrivance to hang on the\nwall of the stateroom. There were pockets for watches, and pockets for\nmedicines, and pockets for handkerchief and hairpins,--in short, there\nwere pockets for everything; besides a pincushion with \"Bon Voyage\" in\nrows of shining pins, a bottle of eau-de-cologne, a cake of soap, and a\nhammer and tacks to nail the whole up with. Mrs. Hall's gift was a warm\nand very pretty woollen wrapper of dark blue flannel, with a pair of\nsoft knitted slippers to match. Old Mr. Worrett sent a note of advice,\nrecommending Katy to take a quinine pill every day that she was away,\nnever to stay out late, because the dews \"over there\" were said to be\nunwholesome, and on no account to drink a drop of water which had not\nbeen boiled.\n\nFrom Cousin Helen came a delightful travelling-bag, light and strong at\nonce, and fitted up with all manner of nice little conveniences. Miss\nInches sent a \"History of Europe\" in five fat volumes, which was so\nheavy that it had to be left at home. In fact, a good many of Katy's\npresents had to be left at home, including a bronze paper-weight in the\nshape of a griffin, a large pair of brass screw candlesticks, and an\normolu inkstand with a pen-rest attached, which weighed at least a pound\nand a half. These Katy laid aside to enjoy after her return. Mrs. Ashe\nand Cousin Helen had both warned her of the inconvenient consequences of\nweight in baggage; and by their advice she had limited herself to a\nsingle trunk of moderate size, besides a little flat valise for use in\nher stateroom.\n\nClover's gift was a set of blank books for notes, journals, etc. In one\nof these, Katy made out a list of \"Things I must see,\" \"Things I must\ndo,\" \"Things I would like to see,\" \"Things I would like to do.\" Another\nshe devoted to various good shopping addresses which had been given her;\nfor though she did not expect to do any shopping herself, she thought\nMrs. Ashe might find them useful. Katy's ideas were still so simple and\nunworldly, and her experience of life so small, that it had not occurred\nto her how very tantalizing it might be to stand in front of shop\nwindows full of delightful things and not be able to buy any of them.\nShe was accordingly overpowered with surprise, gratitude, and the sense\nof sudden wealth, when about a week before the start her father gave her\nthree little thin strips of paper, which he told her were circular\nnotes, and worth a hundred dollars apiece. He also gave her five English\nsovereigns.\n\n\"Those are for immediate use,\" he said. \"Put the notes away carefully,\nand don't lose them. You had better have them cashed one at a time as\nyou require them. Mrs. Ashe will explain how. You will need a gown or so\nbefore you come back, and you'll want to buy some photographs and so on,\nand there will be fees--\"\n\n\"But, papa,\" protested Katy, opening wide her candid eyes, \"I didn't\nexpect you to give me any money, and I'm afraid you are giving me too\nmuch. Do you think you can afford it? Really and truly, I don't want to\nbuy things. I shall see everything, you know, and that's enough.\"\n\nHer father only laughed.\n\n\"You'll be wiser and greedier before the year is out, my dear,\" he\nreplied. \"Three hundred dollars won't go far, as you'll find. But it's\nall I can spare, and I trust you to keep within it, and not come home\nwith any long bills for me to pay.\"\n\n\"Papa! I should think not!\" cried Katy, with unsophisticated horror.\n\nOne very interesting thing was to happen before they sailed, the thought\nof which helped both Katy and Clover through the last hard days, when\nthe preparations were nearly complete, and the family had leisure to\nfeel dull and out of spirits. Katy was to make Rose Red a visit.\n\nRose had by no means been idle during the three years and a half which\nhad elapsed since they all parted at Hillsover, and during which the\ngirls had not seen her. In fact, she had made more out of the time than\nany of the rest of them, for she had been engaged for eighteen months,\nhad been married, and was now keeping house near Boston with a little\nRose of her own, who, she wrote to Clover, was a perfect angel, and more\ndelicious than words could say! Mrs. Ashe had taken passage in the\n\"Spartacus,\" sailing from Boston; and it was arranged that Katy should\nspend the last two days before sailing, with Rose, while Mrs. Ashe and\nAmy visited an old aunt in Hingham. To see Rose in her own home, and\nRose's husband, and Rose's baby, was only next in interest to seeing\nEurope. None of the changes in her lot seemed to have changed her\nparticularly, to judge by the letter she sent in reply to Katy's\nannouncing her plans, which letter ran as follows:--\n\n\"LONGWOOD, September 20.\n\n\"My dearest child,--Your note made me dance with delight. I stood on my\nhead waving my heels wildly to the breeze till Deniston thought I must\nbe taken suddenly mad; but when I explained he did the same. It is too\nenchanting, the whole of it. I put it at the head of all the nice things\nthat ever happened, except my baby. Write the moment you get this by\nwhat train you expect to reach Boston, and when you roll into the\nstation you will behold two forms, one tall and stalwart, the other\nshort and fatsome, waiting for you. They will be those of Deniston and\nmyself. Deniston is not beautiful, but he is good, and he is prepared to\n_adore_ you. The baby is both good and beautiful, and you will adore\nher. I am neither; but you know all about me, and I always did adore you\nand always shall. I am going out this moment to the butcher's to order a\ncalf fatted for your special behoof; and he shall be slain and made into\ncutlets the moment I hear from you. My funny little house, which is\nquite a dear little house too, assumes a new interest in my eyes from\nthe fact that you so soon are to see it. It is somewhat queer, as you\nmight know my house would be; but I think you will like it.\n\n\"I saw Silvery Mary the other day and told her you were coming. She is\nthe same mouse as ever. I shall ask her and some of the other girls to\ncome out to lunch on one of your days. Good-by, with a hundred and fifty\nkisses to Clovy and the rest.\n\n\"Your loving\n\n\"ROSE RED.\"\n\n\"She never signs herself Browne, I observe,\" said Clover, as she\nfinished the letter.\n\n\"Oh, Rose Red Browne would sound too funny. Rose Red she must stay till\nthe end of the chapter; no other name could suit her half so well, and I\ncan't imagine her being called anything else. What fun it will be to see\nher and little Rose!\"\n\n\"And Deniston Browne,\" put in Clover.\n\n\"Somehow I find it rather hard to take in the fact that there is a\nDeniston Browne,\" observed Katy.\n\n\"It will be easier after you have seen him, perhaps.\"\n\nThe last day came, as last days will. Katy's trunk, most carefully\nand exactly packed by the united efforts of the family, stood in the\nhall, locked and strapped, not to be opened again till the party\nreached London. This fact gave it a certain awful interest in the\neyes of Phil and Johnnie, and even Elsie gazed upon it with respect.\nThe little valise was also ready; and Dorry, the neat-handed, had\npainted a red star on both ends of both it and the trunk, that they\nmight be easily picked from among a heap of luggage. He now proceeded\nto prepare and paste on two square cards, labelled respectively,\n\"Hold\" and \"State-room.\" Mrs. Hall had told them that this was the\ncorrect thing to do.\n\nMrs. Ashe had been full of business likewise in putting her house to\nrights for a family who had rented it for the time of her absence, and\nKaty and Clover had taken a good many hours from their own preparations\nto help her. All was done at last; and one bright morning in October,\nKaty stood on the wharf with her family about her, and a lump in her\nthroat which made it difficult to speak to any of them. She stood so\nvery still and said so very little, that a bystander not acquainted with\nthe circumstances might have dubbed her \"unfeeling;\" while the fact was\nthat she was feeling too much!\n\nThe first bell rang. Katy kissed everybody quietly and went on board\nwith her father. Her parting from him, hardest of all, took place in the\nmidst of a crowd of people; then he had to leave her, and as the wheels\nbegan to revolve she went out on the side deck to have a last glimpse of\nthe home faces. There they were: Elsie crying tumultuously, with her\nhead on papa's coat-sleeve; John laughing, or trying to laugh, with big\ntears running down her cheeks the while; and brave little Clover waving\nher handkerchief encouragingly, but with a very sober look on her face.\nKaty's heart went out to the little group with a sudden passion of\nregret and yearning. Why had she said she would go? What was all Europe\nin comparison with what she was leaving? Life was so short, how could\nshe take a whole year out of it to spend away from the people she loved\nbest? If it had been left to her to choose, I think she would have flown\nback to the shore then and there, and given up the journey, I also think\nshe would have been heartily sorry a little later, had she done so.\n\nBut it was not left for her to choose. Already the throb of the engines\nwas growing more regular and the distance widening between the great\nboat and the wharf. Gradually the dear faces faded into distance; and\nafter watching till the flutter of Clover's handkerchief became an\nundistinguishable speck, Katy went to the cabin with a heavy heart. But\nthere were Mrs. Ashe and Amy, inclined to be homesick also, and in need\nof cheering; and Katy, as she tried to brighten them, gradually grew\nbright herself, and recovered her hopeful spirits. Burnet pulled less\nstrongly as it got farther away, and Europe beckoned more brilliantly\nnow that they were fairly embarked on their journey. The sun shone, the\nlake was a beautiful, dazzling blue, and Katy said to herself, \"After\nall, a year is not very long, and how happy I am going to be!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nROSE AND ROSEBUD.\n\n\nThirty-six hours later the Albany train, running smoothly across the\ngreen levels beyond the Mill Dam, brought the travellers to Boston.\n\nKaty looked eagerly from the window for her first glimpse of the city of\nwhich she had heard so much. \"Dear little Boston! How nice it is to see\nit again!\" she heard a lady behind her say; but why it should be called\n\"little Boston\" she could not imagine. Seen from the train, it looked\nlarge, imposing, and very picturesque, after flat Burnet with its one\nbank down to the edge of the lake. She studied the towers, steeples, and\nred roofs crowding each other up the slopes of the Tri-Mountain, and the\nbig State House dome crowning all, and made up her mind that she liked\nthe looks of it better than any other city she had ever seen.\n\nThe train slackened its speed, ran for a few moments between rows of\ntall, shabby brick walls, and with a long, final screech of its whistle\ncame to halt in the station-house. Every one made a simultaneous rush\nfor the door; and Katy and Mrs. Ashe, waiting to collect their books and\nbags, found themselves wedged into their seats and unable to get out. It\nwas a confusing moment, and not comfortable; such moments never are.\n\nBut the discomfort brightened into a sense of relief as, looking out of\nthe window, Katy caught sight of a face exactly opposite, which had\nevidently caught sight of her,--a fresh, pretty face, with light, waving\nhair, pink cheeks all a-dimple, and eyes which shone with laughter and\nwelcome. It was Rose herself, not a bit changed during the years since\nthey parted. A tall young man stood beside her, who must, of course, be\nher husband, Deniston Browne.\n\n\"There is Rose Red,\" cried Katy to Mrs. Ashe. \"Oh, doesn't she look dear\nand natural? Do wait and let me introduce you. I want you to know her.\"\n\nBut the train had come in a little behind time, and Mrs. Ashe was\nafraid of missing the Hingham boat; so she only took a hasty peep\nfrom the window at Rose, pronounced her to be charming-looking,\nkissed Katy hurriedly, reminded her that they must be on the steamer\npunctually at twelve o'clock the following Saturday, and was gone,\nwith Amy beside her; so that Katy, following last of all the\nslow-moving line of passengers, stepped all alone down from the\nplatform into the arms of Rose Red.\n\n\"You darling!\" was Rose's first greeting. \"I began to think you meant\nto spend the night in the car, you were so long in getting out. Well,\nhow perfectly lovely this is! Deniston, here is Katy; Katy, this is\nmy husband.\"\n\nRose looked about fifteen as she spoke, and so absurdly young to have a\n\"husband,\" that Katy could not help laughing as she shook hands with\n\"Deniston;\" and his own eyes twinkled with fun and evident recognition\nof the same joke. He was a tall young man, with a pleasant, \"steady\"\nface, and seemed to be infinitely amused, in a quiet way, with\neverything which his wife said and did.\n\n\"Let us make haste and get out of this hole,\" went on Rose. \"I can\nscarcely see for the smoke. Deniston, dear, please find the cab, and\nhave Katy's luggage put on it. I am wild to get her home, and exhibit\nbaby before she chews up her new sash or does something else that is\ndreadful, to spoil her looks. I left her sitting in state, Katy, with\nall her best clothes on, waiting to be made known to you.\"\n\n\"My large trunk is to go straight to the steamer,\" explained Katy, as\nshe gave her checks to Mr. Browne. \"I only want the little one taken out\nto Longwood, please.\"\n\n\"Now, this is cosey,\" remarked Rose, when they were seated in the cab\nwith Katy's bag at their feet. \"Deniston, my love, I wish you were going\nout with us. There's a nice little bench here all ready and vacant,\nwhich is just suited to a man of your inches. You won't? Well, come in\nthe early train, then. Don't forget.--Now, isn't he just as nice as I\ntold you he was?\" she demanded, the moment the cab began to move.\n\n\"He looks very nice indeed, as far as I can judge in three minutes and\na quarter.\"\n\n\"My dear, it ought not to take anybody of ordinary discernment a minute\nand a quarter to perceive that he is simply the dearest fellow that ever\nlived,\" said Rose. \"I discovered it three seconds after I first beheld\nhim, and was desperately in love with him before he had fairly finished\nhis first bow after introduction.\"\n\n\"And was he equally prompt?\" asked Katy.\n\n\"He says so,\" replied Rose, with a pretty blush. \"But then, you know, he\ncould hardly say less after such a frank confession on my part. It is no\nmore than decent of him to make believe, even if it is not true. Now,\nKaty, look at Boston, and see if you don't _love_ it!\"\n\nThe cab had now turned into Boylston Street; and on the right hand lay\nthe Common, green as summer after the autumn rains, with the elm arches\nleafy still. Long, slant beams of afternoon sun were filtering through\nthe boughs and falling across the turf and the paths, where people were\nwalking and sitting, and children and babies playing together. It was a\ndelightful scene; and Katy received an impression of space and cheer and\nair and freshness, which ever after was associated with her recollection\nof Boston.\n\nRose was quite satisfied with her raptures as they drove through Charles\nStreet, between the Common and the Public Garden, all ablaze with autumn\nflowers, and down the length of Beacon Street with the blue bay shining\nbetween the handsome houses on the water side. Every vestibule and\nbay-window was gay with potted plants and flower-boxes; and a concourse\nof happy-looking people, on foot, on horseback, and in carriages, was\nsurging to and fro like an equal, prosperous tide, while the sunlight\nglorified all.\n\n\"'Boston shows a soft Venetian side,'\" quoted Katy, after a while. \"I\nknow now what Mr. Lowell meant when he wrote that. I don't believe there\nis a more beautiful place in the world.\"\n\n\"Why, of course there isn't,\" retorted Rose, who was a most devoted\nlittle Bostonian, in spite of the fact that she had lived in Washington\nnearly all her life. \"I've not seen much beside, to be sure, but that is\nno matter; I know it is true. It is the dream of my life to come into\nthe city to live. I don't care what part I live in,--West End, South\nEnd, North End; it's all one to me, so long as it is Boston!\"\n\n\"But don't you like Longwood?\" asked Katy, looking out admiringly at the\npretty places set amid vines and shrubberies, which they were now\npassing. \"It looks so very pretty and pleasant.\"\n\n\"Yes, it's well enough for any one who has a taste for natural\nbeauties,\" replied Rose. \"I haven't; I never had. There is nothing I\nhate so much as Nature! I'm a born cockney. I'd rather live in one room\nover Jordan and Marsh's, and see the world wag past, than be the owner\nof the most romantic villa that ever was built, I don't care where it\nmay be situated.\"\n\nThe cab now turned in at a gate and followed a curving drive bordered\nwith trees to a pretty stone house with a porch embowered with Virginia\ncreepers, before which it stopped.\n\n\"Here we are!\" cried Rose, springing out. \"Now, Katy, you mustn't even\ntake time to sit down before I show you the dearest baby that ever was\nsent to this sinful earth. Here, let me take your bag; come straight\nupstairs, and I will exhibit her to you.\"\n\nThey ran up accordingly, and Rose took Katy into a large sunny nursery,\nwhere, tied with pink ribbon into a little basket-chair and watched over\nby a pretty young nurse, sat a dear, fat, fair baby, so exactly like\nRose in miniature that no one could possibly have mistaken the\nrelationship. The baby began to laugh and coo as soon as it caught sight\nof its gay little mother, and exhibited just such another dimple as\nhers, in the middle of a pink cheek. Katy was enchanted.\n\n\"Oh, you darling!\" she said. \"Would she come to me, do you think, Rose?\"\n\n\"Why, of course she shall,\" replied Rose, picking up the baby as if she\nhad been a pillow, and stuffing her into Katy's arms head first. \"Now,\njust look at her, and tell me if ever you saw anything so enchanting in\nthe whole course of your life before? Isn't she big? Isn't she\nbeautiful? Isn't she good? Just see her little hands and her hair! She\nnever cries except when it is clearly her duty to cry. See her turn her\nhead to look at me! Oh, you angel!\" And seizing the long-suffering baby,\nshe smothered it with kisses. \"I never, never, never did see anything so\nsweet. Smell her, Katy! Doesn't she smell like heaven?\"\n\nLittle Rose was indeed a delicious baby, all dimples and good-humor and\nviolet-powder, with a skin as soft as a lily's leaf, and a happy\ncapacity for allowing herself to be petted and cuddled without\nremonstrance. Katy wanted to hold her all the time; but this Rose would\nby no means permit; in fact, I may as well say at once that the two\ngirls spent a great part of their time during the visit in fighting for\nthe possession of the baby, who looked on at the struggle, and smiled on\nthe victor, whichever it happened to be, with all the philosophic\ncomposure of Helen of Troy. She was so soft and sunny and equable, that\nit was no more trouble to care for and amuse her than if she had been a\nbird or a kitten; and, as Rose remarked, it was \"ten times better fun.\"\n\n\"I was never allowed as much doll as I wanted in my infancy,\" she said.\n\"I suppose I tore them to pieces too soon; and they couldn't give me tin\nones to play with, as they did wash-bowls when I broke the china ones.\"\n\n\"Were you such a very bad child?\" asked Katy.\n\n\"Oh, utterly depraved, I believe. You wouldn't think so now, would you?\nI recollect some dreadful occasions at school. Once I had my head pinned\nup in my apron because I _would_ make faces at the other scholars, and\nthey laughed; but I promptly bit a bay-window through the apron, and ran\nmy tongue out of it till they laughed worse than ever. The teacher used\nto send me home with notes fastened to my pinafore with things like this\nwritten in them: 'Little Frisk has been more troublesome than usual\nto-day. She has pinched all the younger children, and bent the bonnets\nof all the older ones. We hope to see an amendment soon, or we do not\nknow what we shall do.'\"\n\n\"Why did they call you Little Frisk?\" inquired Katy, after she had\nrecovered from the laugh which Rose's reminiscences called forth.\n\n\"It was a term of endearment, I suppose; but somehow my family never\nseemed to enjoy it as they ought. I cannot understand,\" she went on\nreflectively, \"why I had not sense enough to suppress those awful\nlittle notes. It would have been so easy to lose them on the way home,\nbut somehow it never occurred to me. Little Rose will be wiser than\nthat; won't you, my angel? She will tear up the horrid notes--mammy\nwill show her how!\"\n\nAll the time that Katy was washing her face and brushing the dust of the\nrailway from her dress, Rose sat by with the little Rose in her lap,\nentertaining her thus. When she was ready, the droll little mamma tucked\nher baby under her arm and led the way downstairs to a large square\nparlor with a bay-window, through which the westering sun was shining.\nIt was a pretty room, and had a flavor about it \"just like Rose,\" Katy\ndeclared. No one else would have hung the pictures or looped back the\ncurtains in exactly that way, or have hit upon the happy device of\nfilling the grate with a great bunch of marigolds, pale brown, golden,\nand orange, to simulate the fire, which would have been quite too warm\non so mild an evening. Morris papers and chintzes and \"artistic\" shades\nof color were in their infancy at that date; but Rose's taste was in\nadvance of her time, and with a foreshadowing of the coming \"reaction,\"\nshe had chosen a \"greenery, yallery\" paper for her walls, against which\nhung various articles which looked a great deal queerer then than they\nwould to-day. There was a mandolin, picked up at some Eastern sale, a\nwarming-pan in shining brass from her mother's attic, two old samplers\nworked in faded silks, and a quantity of gayly tinted Japanese fans and\nembroideries. She had also begged from an old aunt at Beverly Farms a\ncouple of droll little armchairs in white painted wood, with covers of\nantique needle-work. One had \"Chit\" embroidered on the middle of its\ncushion; the other, \"Chat.\" These stood suggestively at the corners of\nthe hearth.\n\n\"Now, Katy,\" said Rose, seating herself in \"Chit,\" \"pull up 'Chat' and\nlet us begin.\"\n\nSo they did begin, and went on, interrupted only by Baby Rose's coos and\nsplutters, till the dusk fell, till appetizing smells floated through\nfrom the rear of the house, and the click of a latch-key announced Mr.\nBrowne, come home just in time for dinner.\n\nThe two days' visit went only too quickly. There is nothing more\nfascinating to a girl than the menage of a young couple of her own age.\nIt is a sort of playing at real life without the cares and the sense of\nresponsibility that real life is sure to bring. Rose was an adventurous\nhousekeeper. She was still new to the position, she found it very\nentertaining, and she delighted in experiments of all sorts. If they\nturned out well, it was good fun; if not, that was funnier still! Her\nhusband, for all his serious manner, had a real boy's love of a lark,\nand he aided and abetted her in all sorts of whimsical devices. They\nowned a dog who was only less dear than the baby, a cat only less dear\nthan the dog, a parrot whose education required constant supervision,\nand a hutch of ring-doves whose melancholy little \"whuddering\" coos were\nthe delight of Rose the less. The house seemed astir with young life all\nover. The only elderly thing in it was the cook, who had the reputation\nof a dreadful temper; only, unfortunately, Rose made her laugh so much\nthat she never found time to be cross.\n\nKaty felt quite an old, experienced person amid all this movement and\nliveliness and cheer. It seemed to her that nobody in the world could\npossibly be having such a good time as Rose; but Rose did not take the\nsame view of the situation.\n\n\"It's all very well now,\" she said, \"while the warm weather lasts; but\nin winter Longwood is simply grewsome. The wind never stops blowing day\nnor night. It howls and it roars and it screams, till I feel as if every\nnerve in my body were on the point of snapping in two. And the snow,\nugh! And the wind, ugh! And burglars! Every night of our lives they\ncome,--or I think they come,--and I lie awake and hear them sharpening\ntheir tools and forcing the locks and murdering the cook and kidnapping\nBaby, till I long to die, and have done with them forever! Oh, Nature is\nthe most unpleasant thing!\"\n\n\"Burglars are not Nature,\" objected Katy.\n\n\"What are they, then? Art? High Art? Well, whatever they are, I do not\nlike them. Oh, if ever the happy day comes when Deniston consents to\nmove into town, I never wish to set my eyes on the country again as long\nas I live, unless--well, yes, I should like to come out just once more\nin the horse-cars and _kick_ that elm-tree by the fence! The number of\ntimes that I have lain awake at night listening to its creaking!\"\n\n\"You might kick it without waiting to have a house in town.\"\n\n\"Oh, I shouldn't dare as long as we are living here! You never know what\nNature may do. She has ways of her own of getting even with people,\"\nremarked her friend, solemnly.\n\nNo time must be lost in showing Boston to Katy, Rose said. So the\nmorning after her arrival she was taken in bright and early to see the\nsights. There were not quite so many sights to be seen then as there are\ntoday. The Art Museum had not got much above its foundations; the new\nTrinity Church was still in the future; but the big organ and the bronze\nstatue of Beethoven were in their glory, and every day at high noon a\nsmall straggling audience wandered into Music Hall to hear the\ninstrument played. To this extempore concert Katy was taken, and to\nFaneuil Hall and the Athenaeum, to Doll and Richards's, where was an\nexhibition of pictures, to the Granary Graveyard, and the Old South.\nThen the girls did a little shopping; and by that time they were quite\ntired enough to make the idea of luncheon agreeable, so they took the\npath across the Common to the Joy Street Mall.\n\nKaty was charmed by all she had seen. The delightful nearness of so many\ninteresting things surprised her. She perceived what is one of Boston's\nchief charms,--that the Common and its surrounding streets make a\nnatural centre and rallying-point for the whole city; as the heart is\nthe centre of the body and keeps up a quick correspondence and regulates\nthe life of all its extremities. The stately old houses on Beacon\nStreet, with their rounded fronts, deep window-casements, and here and\nthere a mauve or a lilac pane set in the sashes, took her fancy greatly;\nand so did the State House, whose situation made it sufficiently\nimposing, even before the gilding of the dome.\n\nUp the steep steps of the Joy Street Mall they went, to the house on Mt.\nVernon Street which the Reddings had taken on their return from\nWashington nearly three years before. Rose had previously shown Katy the\nsite of the old family house on Summer Street, where she was born, now\ngiven over wholly to warehouses and shops. Their present residence was\none of those wide old-fashioned brick houses on the crest of the hill,\nwhose upper windows command the view across to the Boston Highlands; in\nthe rear was a spacious yard, almost large enough to be called a garden,\nwalled in with ivies and grapevines, under which were long beds full of\nroses and chrysanthemums and marigolds and mignonette.\n\nRose carried a latch-key in her pocket, which she said had been one of\nher wedding-gifts; with this she unlocked the front door and let Katy\ninto a roomy white-painted hall.\n\n\"We will go straight through to the back steps,\" she said. \"Mamma is\nsure to be sitting there; she always sits there till the first frost;\nshe says it makes her think of the country. How different people are! I\ndon't want to think of the country, but I'm never allowed to forget it\nfor a moment. Mamma is so fond of those steps and the garden.\"\n\nThere, to be sure, Mrs. Redding was found sitting in a wicker-work\nchair under the shade of the grapevines, with a big basket of mending\nat her side. It looked so homely and country-like to find a person\nthus occupied in the middle of a busy city, that Katy's heart warmed\nto her at once.\n\nMrs. Redding was a fair little woman, scarcely taller than Rose and very\nmuch like her. She gave Katy a kind welcome.\n\n\"You do not seem like a stranger,\" she said, \"Rose has told us so much\nabout you and your sister. Sylvia will be very disappointed not to see\nyou. She went off to make some visits when we broke up in the country,\nand is not to be home for three weeks yet.\"\n\nKaty was disappointed, too, for she had heard a great deal about Sylvia\nand had wished very much to meet her. She was shown her picture, from\nwhich she gathered that she did not look in the least like Rose; for\nthough equally fair, her fairness was of the tall aquiline type, quite\ndifferent from Rose's dimpled prettiness. In fact, Rose resembled her\nmother, and Sylvia her father; they were only alike in little\npeculiarities of voice and manner, of which a portrait did not enable\nKaty to judge.\n\nThe two girls had a cosey little luncheon with Mrs. Redding, after which\nRose carried Katy off to see the house and everything in it which was in\nany way connected with her own personal history,--the room where she\nused to sleep, the high-chair in which she sat as a baby and which was\npresently to be made over to little Rose, the sofa where Deniston\noffered himself, and the exact spot on the carpet on which she had stood\nwhile they were being married! Last of all,--\n\n\"Now you shall see the best and dearest thing in the whole house,\"\nshe said, opening the door of a room in the second story.--\n\"Grandmamma, here is my friend Katy Carr, whom you have so often\nheard me tell about.\"\n\nIt was a large pleasant room, with a little wood-fire blazing in a\ngrate, by which, in an arm-chair full of cushions, with a\nSolitaire-board on a little table beside her, sat a sweet old lady.\nThis was Rose's father's mother. She was nearly eighty; but she was\nbeautiful still, and her manner had a gracious old-fashioned courtesy\nwhich was full of charm. She had been thrown from a carriage the year\nbefore, and had never since been able to come downstairs or to mingle\nin the family life.\n\n\"They come to me instead,\" she told Katy. \"There is no lack of pleasant\ncompany,\" she added; \"every one is very good to me. I have a reader for\ntwo hours a day, and I read to myself a little, and play Patience and\nSolitaire, and never lack entertainment.\"\n\nThere was something restful in the sight of such a lovely specimen of\nold age. Katy realized, as she looked at her, what a loss it had been\nto her own life that she had never known either of her grandparents.\nShe sat and gazed at old Mrs. Redding with a mixture of regret and\nfascination. She longed to hold her hand, and kiss her, and play with\nher beautiful silvery hair, as Rose did. Rose was evidently the old\nlady's peculiar darling. They were on the most intimate terms; and\nRose dimpled and twinkled, and made saucy speeches, and told all her\nlittle adventures and the baby's achievements, and made jests, and\ntalked nonsense as freely as to a person of her own age. It was a\ndelightful relation.\n\n\"Grandmamma has taken a fancy to you, I can see,\" she told Katy, as they\ndrove back to Longwood. \"She always wants to know my friends; and she\nhas her own opinions about them, I can tell you.\"\n\n\"Do you really think she liked me?\" said Katy, warmly. \"I am so glad\nif she did, for I _loved_ her. I never saw a really beautiful old\nperson before.\"\n\n\"Oh, there's nobody like her,\" rejoined Rose. \"I can't imagine what it\nwould be not to have her.\" Her merry little face was quite sad and\nserious as she spoke. \"I wish she were not so old,\" she added with a\nsigh. \"If we could only put her back twenty years! Then, perhaps, she\nwould live as long as I do.\"\n\nBut, alas! there is no putting back the hands on the dial of time, no\nmatter how much we may desire it.\n\nThe second day of Katy's visit was devoted to the luncheon-party of\nwhich Rose had written in her letter, and which was meant to be a\nreunion or \"side chapter\" of the S.S.U.C. Rose had asked every old\nHillsover girl who was within reach. There was Mary Silver, of course,\nand Esther Dearborn, both of whom lived in Boston; and by good luck\nAlice Gibbons happened to be making Esther a visit, and Ellen Gray came\nin from Waltham, where her father had recently been settled over a\nparish, so that all together they made six of the original nine of the\nsociety; and Quaker Row itself never heard a merrier confusion of\ntongues than resounded through Rose's pretty parlor for the first hour\nafter the arrival of the guests.\n\nThere was everybody to ask after, and everything to tell. The girls all\nseemed wonderfully unchanged to Katy, but they professed to find her\nvery grown up and dignified.\n\n\"I wonder if I am,\" she said. \"Clover never told me so. But perhaps she\nhas grown dignified too.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" cried Rose; \"Clover could no more be dignified than my baby\ncould. Mary Silver, give me that child this moment! I never saw such a\ngreedy thing as you are; you have kept her to yourself at least a\nquarter of an hour, and it isn't fair.\"\n\n\"Oh, I beg your pardon,\" said Mary, laughing and covering her mouth with\nher hand exactly in her old, shy, half-frightened way.\n\n\"We only need Mrs. Nipson to make our little party complete,\" went on\nRose, \"or dear Miss Jane! What has become of Miss Jane, by the way? Do\nany of you know?\"\n\n\"Oh, she is still teaching at Hillsover and waiting for her missionary.\nHe has never come back. Berry Searles says that when he goes out to walk\nhe always walks away from the United States, for fear of diminishing the\ndistance between them.\"\n\n\"What a shame!\" said Katy, though she could not help laughing. \"Miss\nJane was really quite nice,--no, not nice exactly, but she had good\nthings about her.\"\n\n\"Had she!\" remarked Rose, satirically. \"I never observed them. It\nrequired eyes like yours, real 'double million magnifying-glasses of\nh'extra power,' to find them out. She was all teeth and talons as far\nas I was concerned; but I think she really did have a softish spot in\nher old heart for you, Katy, and it's the only good thing I ever knew\nabout her.\"\n\n\"What has become of Lilly Page?\" asked Ellen.\n\n\"She's in Europe with her mother. I dare say you'll meet, Katy, and what\na pleasure that will be! And have you heard about Bella? she's teaching\nschool in the Indian Territory. Just fancy that scrap teaching school!\"\n\n\"Isn't it dangerous?\" asked Mary Silver.\n\n\"Dangerous? How? To her scholars, do you mean? Oh, the Indians! Well,\nher scalp will be easy to identify if she has adhered to her favorite\npomatum; that's one comfort,\" put in naughty Rose.\n\nIt was a merry luncheon indeed, as little Rose seemed to think, for she\nlaughed and cooed incessantly. The girls were enchanted with her, and\nvoted her by acclamation an honorary member of the S.S.U.C. Her health\nwas drunk in Apollinaris water with all the honors, and Rose returned\nthanks in a droll speech. The friends told each other their histories\nfor the past three years; but it was curious how little, on the whole,\nmost of them had to tell. Though, perhaps, that was because they did not\ntell all; for Alice Gibbons confided to Katy in a whisper that she\nstrongly suspected Esther of being engaged, and at the same moment Ellen\nGray was convulsing Rose by the intelligence that a theological student\nfrom Andover was \"very attentive\" to Mary Silver.\n\n\"My dear, I don't believe it,\" Rose said, \"not even a theological\nstudent would dare! and if he did, I am quite sure Mary would consider\nit most improper. You must be mistaken, Ellen.\"\n\n\"No, I'm not mistaken; for the theological student is my second cousin,\nand his sister told me all about it. They are not engaged exactly, but\nshe hasn't said no; so he hopes she will say yes.\"\n\n\"Oh, she'll never say no; but then she will never say yes, either. He\nwould better take silence as consent! Well, I never did think I should\nlive to see Silvery Mary married. I should as soon have expected to find\nthe Thirty-nine Articles engaged in a flirtation. She's a dear old\nthing, though, and as good as gold; and I shall consider your second\ncousin a lucky man if he persuades her.\"\n\n\"I wonder where we shall all be when you come back, Katy,\" said Esther\nDearborn as they parted at the gate. \"A year is a long time; all sorts\nof things may happen in a year.\"\n\nThese words rang in Katy's ears as she fell asleep that night. \"All\nsorts of things may happen in a year,\" she thought, \"and they may not be\nall happy things, either.\" Almost she wished that the journey to Europe\nhad never been thought of!\n\nBut when she waked the next morning to the brightest of October suns\nshining out of a clear blue sky, her misgivings fled. There could not\nhave been a more beautiful day for their start.\n\nShe and Rose went early into town, for old Mrs. Bedding had made Katy\npromise to come for a few minutes to say good-by. They found her sitting\nby the fire as usual, though her windows were open to admit the\nsun-warmed air. A little basket of grapes stood on the table beside her,\nwith a nosegay of tea-roses on top. These were from Rose's mother, for\nKaty to take on board the steamer; and there was something else, a small\nparcel twisted up in thin white paper.\n\n\"It is my good-by gift,\" said the dear old lady. \"Don't open it now.\nKeep it till you are well out at sea, and get some little thing with it\nas a keepsake from me.\"\n\nGrateful and wondering, Katy put the little parcel in her pocket. With\nkisses and good wishes she parted from these new made friends, and she\nand Rose drove to the steamer, stopping for Mr. Browne by the way. They\nwere a little late, so there was not much time for farewells after they\narrived; but Rose snatched a moment for a private interview with the\nstewardess, unnoticed by Katy, who was busy with Mrs. Ashe and Amy.\n\nThe bell rang, and the great steam-vessel slowly backed into the stream.\nThen her head was turned to sea, and down the bay she went, leaving Rose\nand her husband still waving their handkerchiefs on the pier. Katy\nwatched them to the last, and when she could no longer distinguish them,\nfelt that her final link with home was broken.\n\nIt was not till she had settled her things in the little cabin which\nwas to be her home for the next ten days, had put her bonnet and dress\nfor safe keeping in the upper berth, nailed up her red and yellow bag,\nand donned the woollen gown, ulster, and soft felt hat which were to do\nservice during the voyage, that she found time to examine the\nmysterious parcel.\n\nBehold, it was a large, beautiful gold-piece, twenty dollars!\n\n\"What a darling old lady!\" said Katy; and she gave the gold-piece a\nkiss. \"How did she come to think of such a thing? I wonder if there is\nanything in Europe good enough to buy with it?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nON THE \"SPARTACUS.\"\n\n\nThe ulster and the felt hat soon came off again, for a head wind lay\nwaiting in the offing, and the \"Spartacus\" began to pitch and toss in a\nmanner which made all her unseasoned passengers glad to betake\nthemselves to their berths. Mrs. Ashe and Amy were among the earliest\nvictims of sea-sickness; and Katy, after helping them to settle in their\nstaterooms, found herself too dizzy and ill to sit up a moment longer,\nand thankfully resorted to her own.\n\nAs the night came on, the wind grew stronger and the motion worse. The\n\"Spartacus\" had the reputation of being a dreadful \"roller,\" and seemed\nbound to justify it on this particular voyage. Down, down, down the\ngreat hull would slide till Katy would hold her breath with fear lest it\nmight never right itself again; then slowly, slowly the turn would be\nmade, and up, up, up it would go, till the cant on the other side was\nequally alarming. On the whole, Katy preferred to have her own side of\nthe ship, the downward one; for it was less difficult to keep herself in\nthe berth, from which she was in continual danger of being thrown. The\nnight seemed endless, for she was too frightened to sleep except in\nbroken snatches; and when day dawned, and she looked through the little\nround pane of glass in the port-hole, only gray sky and gray weltering\nwaves and flying spray and rain met her view.\n\n\"Oh, dear, why do people ever go to sea, unless they must?\" she thought\nfeebly to herself. She wanted to get up and see how Mrs. Ashe had lived\nthrough the night, but the attempt to move made her so miserably ill\nthat she was glad to sink again on her pillows.\n\nThe stewardess looked in with offers of tea and toast, the very idea\nof which was simply dreadful, and pronounced the other lady \"'orridly\nill, worse than you are, Miss,\" and the little girl \"takin' on\ndreadful in the h'upper berth.\" Of this fact Katy soon had audible\nproof; for as her dizzy senses rallied a little, she could hear Amy in\nthe opposite stateroom crying and sobbing pitifully. She seemed to be\nangry as well as sick, for she was scolding her poor mother in the\nmost vehement fashion.\n\n\"I hate being at sea,\" Katy heard her say. \"I won't stay in this nasty\nold ship. Mamma! Mamma! do you hear me? I won't stay in this ship! It\nwasn't a bit kind of you to bring me to such a horrid place. It was very\nunkind; it was cru-el. I want to go back, mamma. Tell the captain to\ntake me back to the land. Mamma, why don't you speak to me? Oh, I am so\nsick and so very un-happy. Don't you wish you were dead? I do!\"\n\nAnd then came another storm of sobs, but never a sound from Mrs. Ashe,\nwho, Katy suspected, was too ill to speak. She felt very sorry for poor\nlittle Amy, raging there in her high berth like some imprisoned\ncreature, but she was powerless to help her. She could only resign\nherself to her own discomforts, and try to believe that somehow,\nsometime, this state of things must mend,--either they should all get to\nland or all go to the bottom and be drowned, and at that moment she\ndidn't care very much which it turned out to be.\n\nThe gale increased as the day wore on, and the vessel pitched\ndreadfully. Twice Katy was thrown out of her berth on the floor; then\nthe stewardess came and fixed a sort of movable side to the berth, which\nheld her in, but made her feel like a child fastened into a railed crib.\nAt intervals she could still hear Amy crying and scolding her mother,\nand conjectured that they were having a dreadful time of it in the other\nstateroom. It was all like a bad dream. \"And they call this travelling\nfor pleasure!\" thought poor Katy.\n\nOne droll thing happened in the course of the second night,--at least it\nseemed droll afterward; at the time Katy was too uncomfortable to enjoy\nit. Amid the rush of the wind, the creaking of the ship's timbers, and\nthe shrill buzz of the screw, she heard a sound of queer little\nfootsteps in the entry outside of her open door, hopping and leaping\ntogether in an odd irregular way, like a regiment of mice or toy\nsoldiers. Nearer and nearer they came; and Katy opening her eyes saw a\nprocession of boots and shoes of all sizes and shapes, which had\nevidently been left on the floors or at the doors of various staterooms,\nand which in obedience to the lurchings of the vessel had collected in\nthe cabin. They now seemed to be acting in concert with one another, and\nreally looked alive as they bumped and trotted side by side, and two by\ntwo, in at the door and up close to her bedside. There they remained for\nseveral moments executing what looked like a dance; then the leading\nshoe turned on its heel as if giving a signal to the others, and they\nall hopped slowly again into the passage-way and disappeared. It was\nexactly like one of Hans Christian Andersen's fairy-tales, Katy wrote to\nClover afterward. She heard them going down the cabin; but how it ended,\nor whether the owners of the boots and shoes ever got their own\nparticular pairs again, she never knew.\n\nToward morning the gale abated, the sea became smoother, and she dropped\nasleep. When she woke the sun was struggling through the clouds, and she\nfelt better.\n\nThe stewardess opened the port-hole to freshen the air, and helped her\nto wash her face and smooth her tangled hair; then she produced a little\nbasin of gruel and a triangular bit of toast, and Katy found that her\nappetite was come again and she could eat.\n\n\"And 'ere's a letter, ma'am, which has come for you by post this\nmorning,\" said the nice old stewardess, producing an envelope from her\npocket, and eying her patient with great satisfaction.\n\n\"By post!\" cried Katy, in amazement; \"why, how can that be?\" Then\ncatching sight of Rose's handwriting on the envelope, she understood,\nand smiled at her own simplicity.\n\nThe stewardess beamed at her as she opened it, then saying again, \"Yes,\n'm, by post, m'm,\" withdrew, and left Katy to enjoy the little surprise.\n\nThe letter was not long, but it was very like its writer. Rose drew a\npicture of what Katy would probably be doing at the time it reached\nher,--a picture so near the truth that Katy felt as if Rose must have\nthe spirit of prophecy, especially as she kindly illustrated the\nsituation with a series of pen-and-ink drawings, in which Katy was\ndepicted as prone in her berth, refusing with horror to go to dinner,\nlooking longingly backward toward the quarter where the United States\nwas supposed to be, and fishing out of her port-hole with a crooked pin\nin hopes of grappling the submarine cable and sending a message to her\nfamily to come out at once and take her home. It ended with this short\n\"poem,\" over which Katy laughed till Mrs. Ashe called feebly across the\nentry to ask what _was_ the matter?\n\n  \"Break, break, break\n    And mis-behave, O sea,\n  And I wish that my tongue could utter\n    The hatred I feel for thee!\n\n  \"Oh, well for the fisherman's child\n    On the sandy beach at his play;\n  Oh, well for all sensible folk\n    Who are safe at home to-day!\n\n  \"But this horrible ship keeps on,\n    And is never a moment still,\n  And I yearn for the touch of the nice dry land,\n    Where I needn't feel so ill!\n\n  \"Break! break! break!\n    There is no good left in me;\n  For the dinner I ate on the shore so late\n    Has vanished into the sea!\"\n\nLaughter is very restorative after the forlornity of sea-sickness; and\nKaty was so stimulated by her letter that she managed to struggle into\nher dressing-gown and slippers and across the entry to Mrs. Ashe's\nstateroom. Amy had fallen asleep at last and must not be waked up, so\ntheir interview was conducted in whispers. Mrs. Ashe had by no means got\nto the tea-and-toast stage yet, and was feeling miserable enough.\n\n\"I have had the most dreadful time with Amy,\" she said. \"All day\nyesterday, when she wasn't sick she was raging at me from the upper\nberth, and I too ill to say a word in reply. I never knew her so\nnaughty! And it seemed very neglectful not to come to see after you,\npoor dear child! but really I couldn't raise my head.\"\n\n\"Neither could I, and I felt just as guilty not to be taking care of\nyou,\" said Katy. \"Well, the worst is over with all of us, I hope. The\nvessel doesn't pitch half so much now, and the stewardess says we shall\nfeel a great deal better as soon as we get on deck. She is coming\npresently to help me up; and when Amy wakes, won't you let her be\ndressed, and I will take care of her while Mrs. Barrett attends to you.\"\n\n\"I don't think I can be dressed,\" sighed poor Mrs. Ashe. \"I feel as if I\nshould just lie here till we get to Liverpool.\"\n\n\"Oh no, h'indeed, mum,--no, you won't,\" put in Mrs. Barrett, who at that\nmoment appeared, gruel-cup in hand. \"I don't never let my ladies lie in\ntheir berths a moment longer than there is need of. I h'always gets them\non deck as soon as possible to get the h'air. It's the best medicine you\ncan 'ave, ma'am, the fresh h'air; h'indeed it h'is.\"\n\nStewardesses are all-powerful on board ship, and Mrs. Barrett was so\npersuasive as well as positive that it was not possible to resist her.\nShe got Katy into her dress and wraps, and seated her on deck in a chair\nwith a great rug wrapped about her feet, with very little effort on\nKaty's part. Then she dived down the companion-way again, and in the\ncourse of an hour appeared escorting a big burly steward, who carried\npoor little pale Amy in his arms as easily as though she had been a\nkitten. Amy gave a scream of joy at the sight of Katy, and cuddled down\nin her lap under the warm rug with a sigh of relief and satisfaction.\n\n\"I thought I was never going to see you again,\" she said, with a little\nsqueeze. \"Oh, Miss Katy, it has been so horrid! I never thought that\ngoing to Europe meant such dreadful things as this!\"\n\n\"This is only the beginning; we shall get across the sea in a few days,\nand then we shall find out what going to Europe really means. But what\nmade you behave so, Amy, and cry and scold poor mamma when she was sick?\nI could hear you all the way across the entry.\"\n\n\"Could you? Then why didn't you come to me?\"\n\n\"I wanted to; but I was sick too, so sick that I couldn't move. But why\nwere you so naughty?--you didn't tell me.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean to be naughty, but I couldn't help crying. You would have\ncried too, and so would Johnnie, if you had been cooped up in a dreadful\nold berth at the top of the wall that you couldn't get out of, and\nhadn't had anything to eat, and nobody to bring you any water when you\nwanted some. And mamma wouldn't answer when I called to her.\"\n\n\"She couldn't answer; she was too ill,\" explained Katy. \"Well, my pet,\nit _was_ pretty hard for you. I hope we sha'n't have any more such days.\nThe sea is a great deal smoother now.\"\n\n\"Mabel looks quite pale; she was sick, too,\" said Amy, regarding the\ndoll in her arms with an anxious air. \"I hope the fresh h'air will do\nher good.\"\n\n\"Is she going to have any fresh hair?\" asked Katy, wilfully\nmisunderstanding.\n\n\"That was what that woman called it,--the fat one who made me come up\nhere. But I'm glad she did, for I feel heaps better already; only I keep\nthinking of poor little Maria Matilda shut up in the trunk in that dark\nplace, and wondering if she's sick. There's nobody to explain to her\ndown there.\"\n\n\"They say that you don't feel the motion half so much in the bottom of\nthe ship,\" said Katy. \"Perhaps she hasn't noticed it at all. Dear me,\nhow good something smells! I wish they would bring us something to eat.\"\n\nA good many passengers had come up by this time; and Robert, the deck\nsteward, was going about, tray in hand, taking orders for lunch. Amy and\nKaty both felt suddenly ravenous; and when Mrs. Ashe awhile later was\nhelped up the stairs, she was amazed to find them eating cold beef and\nroasted potatoes, with the finest appetites in the world. \"They had\nserved out their apprenticeships,\" the kindly old captain told them,\n\"and were made free of the nautical guild from that time on.\" So it\nproved; for after these two bad days none of the party were sick again\nduring the voyage.\n\nAmy had a clamorous appetite for stories as well as for cold beef; and\nto appease this craving, Katy started a sort of ocean serial, called\n\"The History of Violet and Emma,\" which she meant to make last till they\ngot to Liverpool, but which in reality lasted much longer. It might with\nequal propriety have been called \"The Adventures of two little Girls who\ndidn't have any Adventures,\" for nothing in particular happened to\neither Violet or Emma during the whole course of their long-drawn-out\nhistory. Amy, however, found them perfectly enchanting, and was never\nweary of hearing how they went to school and came home again, how they\ngot into scrapes and got out of them, how they made good resolutions and\nbroke them, about their Christmas presents and birthday treats, and what\nthey said and how they felt. The first instalment of this un-exciting\nromance was given that first afternoon on deck; and after that, Amy\nclaimed a new chapter daily, and it was a chief ingredient of her\npleasure during the voyage.\n\nOn the third morning Katy woke and dressed so early, that she gained the\ndeck before the sailors had finished their scrubbing and holystoning.\nShe took refuge within the companion-way, and sat down on the top step\nof the ladder, to wait till the deck was dry enough to venture upon it.\nThere the Captain found her and drew near for a talk.\n\nCaptain Bryce was exactly the kind of sea-captain that is found in\nstory-books, but not always in real life. He was stout and grizzled and\nbrown and kind. He had a bluff weather-beaten face, lit up with a pair\nof shrewd blue eyes which twinkled when he was pleased; and his manner,\nthough it was full of the habit of command, was quiet and pleasant. He\nwas a Martinet on board his ship. Not a sailor under him would have\ndared dispute his orders for a moment; but he was very popular with\nthem, notwithstanding; they liked him as much as they feared him, for\nthey knew him to be their best friend if it came to sickness or trouble\nwith any of them.\n\nKaty and he grew quite intimate during their long morning talk. The\nCaptain liked girls. He had one of his own, about Katy's age, and was\nfond of talking about her. Lucy was his mainstay at home, he told Katy.\nHer mother had been \"weakly\" now this long time back, and Bess and Nanny\nwere but children yet, so Lucy had to take command and keep things\nship-shape when he was away.\n\n\"She'll be on the lookout when the steamer comes in,\" said the Captain.\n\"There's a signal we've arranged which means 'All's well,' and when we\nget up the river a little way I always look to see if it's flying. It's\na bit of a towel hung from a particular window; and when I see it I say\nto myself, 'Thank God! another voyage safely done and no harm come of\nit.' It's a sad kind of work for a man to go off for a twenty-four days'\ncruise leaving a sick wife on shore behind him. If it wasn't that I have\nLucy to look after things, I should have thrown up my command long ago.\"\n\n\"Indeed, I am glad you have Lucy; she must be a great comfort to you,\"\nsaid Katy, sympathetically; for the Captain's hearty voice trembled a\nlittle as he spoke. She made him tell her the color of Lucy's hair and\neyes, and exactly how tall she was, and what she had studied, and what\nsort of books she liked. She seemed such a very nice girl, and Katy\nthought she should like to know her.\n\nThe deck had dried fast in the fresh sea-wind, and the Captain had just\narranged Katy in her chair, and was wrapping the rug about her feet in a\nfatherly way, when Mrs. Barrett, all smiles, appeared from below.\n\n\"Oh, 'ere you h'are, Miss. I couldn't think what 'ad come to you so\nearly; and you're looking ever so well again, I'm pleased to see; and\n'ere's a bundle just arrived, Miss, by the Parcels Delivery.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried simple Katy. Then she laughed at her own foolishness, and\ntook the \"bundle,\" which was directed in Rose's unmistakable hand.\n\nIt contained a pretty little green-bound copy of Emerson's Poems, with\nKaty's name and \"To be read at sea,\" written on the flyleaf. Somehow the\nlittle gift seemed to bridge the long misty distance which stretched\nbetween the vessel's stern and Boston Bay, and to bring home and friends\na great deal nearer. With a half-happy, half-tearful pleasure Katy\nrecognized the fact that distance counts for little if people love one\nanother, and that hearts have a telegraph of their own whose messages\nare as sure and swift as any of those sent over the material lines which\nlink continent to continent and shore with shore.\n\nLater in the morning, Katy, going down to her stateroom for something,\ncame across a pallid, exhausted-looking lady, who lay stretched on one\nof the long sofas in the cabin, with a baby in her arms and a little\ngirl sitting at her feet, quite still, with a pair of small hands folded\nin her lap. The little girl did not seem to be more than four years old.\nShe had two pig-tails of thick flaxen hair hanging over her shoulders,\nand at Katy's approach raised a pair of solemn blue eyes, which had so\nmuch appeal in them, though she said nothing, that Katy stopped at once.\n\n\"Can I do anything for you?\" she asked. \"I am afraid you have been\nvery ill.\"\n\nAt the sound of her voice the lady on the sofa opened her eyes. She\ntried to speak, but to Katy's dismay began to cry instead; and when the\nwords came they were strangled with sobs.\n\n\"You are so kin-d to ask,\" she said. \"If you would give my little girl\nsomething to eat! She has had nothing since yesterday, and I have been\nso ill; and no-nobody has c-ome near us!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Katy, with horror, \"nothing to eat since yesterday! How did\nit happen?\"\n\n\"Everybody has been sick on our side the ship,\" explained the poor lady,\n\"and I suppose the stewardess thought, as I had a maid with me, that I\nneeded her less than the others. But my maid has been sick, too; and oh,\nso selfish! She wouldn't even take the baby into the berth with her; and\nI have had all I could do to manage with him, when I couldn't lift up my\nhead. Little Gretchen has had to go without anything; and she has been\nso good and patient!\"\n\nKaty lost no time, but ran for Mrs. Barrett, whose indignation knew no\nbounds when she heard how the helpless party had been neglected.\n\n\"It's a new person that stewardess h'is, ma'am,\" she explained, \"and\nmost h'inefficient! I told the Captain when she come aboard that I\ndidn't 'ave much opinion of her, and now he'll see how it h'is. I'm\nh'ashamed that such a thing should 'appen on the 'Spartacus,' ma'am,--I\nh'am, h'indeed. H'it never would 'ave ben so h'under h'Eliza,\nma'am,--she's the one that went h'off and got herself married the trip\nbefore last, when this person came to take her place.\"\n\nAll the time that she talked Mrs. Barrett was busy in making Mrs.\nWare--for that, it seemed, was the sick lady's name--more comfortable;\nand Katy was feeding Gretchen out of a big bowl full of bread and milk\nwhich one of the stewards had brought. The little uncomplaining thing\nwas evidently half starved, but with the mouthfuls the pink began to\nsteal back into her cheeks and lips, and the dark circles lessened under\nthe blue eyes. By the time the bottom of the bowl was reached she could\nsmile, but still she said not a word except a whispered _Danke schon_.\nHer mother explained that she had been born in Germany, and always till\nnow had been cared for by a German nurse, so that she knew that language\nbetter than English.\n\n[Illustration: Katy was feeding Gretchen out of a big bowl full of bread\nand milk.]\n\nGretchen was a great amusement to Katy and Amy during the rest of the\nvoyage. They kept her on deck with them a great deal, and she was\nperfectly content with them and very good, though always solemn and\nquiet. Pleasant people turned up among the passengers, as always happens\non an ocean steamship, and others not so pleasant, perhaps, who were\nrather curious and interesting to watch.\n\nKaty grew to feel as if she knew a great deal about her fellow\ntravellers as time went on. There was the young girl going out to join\nher parents under the care of a severe governess, whom everybody on\nboard rather pitied. There was the other girl on her way to study art,\nwho was travelling quite alone, and seemed to have nobody to meet her or\nto go to except a fellow student of her own age, already in Paris, but\nwho seemed quite unconscious of her lonely position and competent to\ngrapple with anything or anybody. There was the queer old gentleman who\nhad \"crossed\" eleven times before, and had advice and experience to\nspare for any one who would listen to them; and the other gentleman, not\nso old but even more queer, who had \"frozen his stomach,\" eight years\nbefore, by indulging, on a hot summer's day, in sixteen successive\nice-creams, alternated with ten glasses of equally cold soda-water, and\nwho related this exciting experience in turn to everybody on board.\nThere was the bad little boy, whose parents were powerless to oppose\nhim, and who carried terror to the hearts of all beholders whenever he\nappeared; and the pretty widow who filled the role of reigning belle;\nand the other widow, not quite so pretty or so much a belle, who had a\ngood deal to say, in a voice made discreetly low, about what a pity it\nwas that dear Mrs. So-and-so should do this or that, and \"Doesn't it\nstrike you as very unfortunate that she should not consider\" the other\nthing? A great sea-going steamer is a little world in itself, and gives\none a glimpse of all sorts and conditions of people and characters.\n\nOn the whole, there was no one on the \"Spartacus\" whom Katy liked so\nwell as sedate little Gretchen except the dear old Captain, with whom\nshe was a prime favorite. He gave Mrs. Ashe and herself the seats next\nto him at table, looked after their comfort in every possible way, and\neach night at dinner sent Katy one of the apple-dumplings made specially\nfor him by the cook, who had gone many voyages with the Captain and knew\nhis fancies. Katy did not care particularly for the dumpling, but she\nvalued it as a mark of regard, and always ate it when she could.\n\nMeanwhile, every morning brought a fresh surprise from that dear,\npainstaking Rose, who had evidently worked hard and thought harder in\ncontriving pleasures for Katy's first voyage at sea. Mrs. Barrett was\nenlisted in the plot, there could be no doubt of that, and enjoyed the\njoke as much as any one, as she presented herself each day with the\ninvariable formula, \"A letter for you, ma'am,\" or \"A bundle, Miss, come\nby the Parcels Delivery.\" On the fourth morning it was a photograph of\nBaby Rose, in a little flat morocco case. The fifth brought a wonderful\nepistle, full of startling pieces of news, none of them true. On the\nsixth appeared a long narrow box containing a fountain pen. Then came\nMr. Howells's \"A Foregone Conclusion,\" which Katy had never seen; then a\nbox of quinine pills; then a sachet for her trunk; then another\nburlesque poem; last of all, a cake of delicious violet soap, \"to wash\nthe sea-smell from her hands,\" the label said. It grew to be one of the\nlittle excitements of ship life to watch for the arrival of these daily\ngifts; and \"What did the mail bring for you this time, Miss Carr?\" was a\nquestion frequently asked. Each arrival Katy thought must be the final\none; but Rose's forethought had gone so far even as to provide an extra\nparcel in case the voyage was a day longer than usual, and \"Miss Carr's\nmail\" continued to come in till the very last morning.\n\nKaty never forgot the thrill that went through her when, after so many\ndays of sea, her eyes first caught sight of the dim line of the Irish\ncoast. An exciting and interesting day followed as, after stopping at\nQueenstown to leave the mails, they sped northeastward between shores\nwhich grew more distinct and beautiful with every hour,--on one side\nIreland, on the other the bold mountain lines of the Welsh coast. It was\nlate afternoon when they entered the Mersey, and dusk had fallen before\nthe Captain got out his glass to look for the white fluttering speck in\nhis own window which meant so much to him. Long he studied before he\nmade quite sure that it was there. At last he shut the glass with a\nsatisfied air.\n\n\"It's all right,\" he said to Katy, who stood near, almost as much\ninterested as he. \"Lucy never forgets, bless her! Well, there's another\nvoyage over and done with, thank God, and my Mary is where she was. It's\na load taken from my mind.\"\n\nThe moon had risen and was shining softly on the river as the\ncrowded tender landed the passengers from the \"Spartacus\" at the\nLiverpool docks.\n\n\"We shall meet again in London or in Paris,\" said one to another, and\ncards and addresses were exchanged. Then after a brief delay at the\nCustom House they separated, each to his own particular destination;\nand, as a general thing, none of them ever saw any of the others again.\nIt is often thus with those who have been fellow voyagers at sea; and it\nis always a surprise and perplexity to inexperienced travellers that it\ncan be so, and that those who have been so much to each other for ten\ndays can melt away into space and disappear as though the brief intimacy\nhad never existed.\n\n\"Four-wheeler or hansom, ma'am?\" said a porter to Mrs. Ashe.\n\n\"Which, Katy?\"\n\n\"Oh, let us have a hansom! I never saw one, and they look so nice\nin 'Punch.'\"\n\nSo a hansom cab was called, the two ladies got in, Amy cuddled down\nbetween them, the folding-doors were shut over their knees like a\nlap-robe, and away they drove up the solidly paved streets to the hotel\nwhere they were to pass the night. It was too late to see or do anything\nbut enjoy the sense of being on firm land once more.\n\n\"How lovely it will be to sleep in a bed that doesn't tip or roll from\nside to side!\" said Mrs. Ashe.\n\n\"Yes, and that is wide enough and long enough and soft enough to be\ncomfortable!\" replied Katy. \"I feel as if I could sleep for a fortnight\nto make up for the bad nights at sea.\"\n\nEverything seemed delightful to her,--the space for undressing, the\ngreat tub of fresh water which stood beside the English-looking\nwashstand with its ample basin and ewer, the chintz-curtained bed, the\ncoolness, the silence,--and she closed her eyes with the pleasant\nthought in her mind, \"It is really England and we are really here!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nSTORYBOOK ENGLAND.\n\n\n\"Oh, is it raining?\" was Katy's first question next morning, when the\nmaid came to call her. The pretty room, with its gayly flowered chintz,\nand china, and its brass bedstead, did not look half so bright as when\nlit with gas the night before; and a dim gray light struggled in at the\nwindow, which in America would certainly have meant bad weather coming\nor already come.\n\n\"Oh no, h'indeed, ma'am, it's a very fine day,--not bright, ma'am, but\nvery dry,\" was the answer.\n\nKaty couldn't imagine what the maid meant, when she peeped between the\ncurtains and saw a thick dull mist lying over everything, and the\npavements opposite her window shining with wet. Afterwards, when she\nunderstood better the peculiarities of the English climate, she too\nlearned to call days not absolutely rainy \"fine,\" and to be grateful for\nthem; but on that first morning her sensations were of bewildered\nsurprise, almost vexation.\n\nMrs. Ashe and Amy were waiting in the coffee-room when she went in\nsearch of them.\n\n\"What shall we have for breakfast,\" asked Mrs. Ashe,--\"our first meal in\nEngland? Katy, you order it.\"\n\n\"Let's have all the things we have read about in books and don't have at\nhome,\" said Katy, eagerly. But when she came to look over the bill of\nfare there didn't seem to be many such things. Soles and muffins she\nfinally decided upon, and, as an after-thought, gooseberry jam.\n\n\"Muffins sound so very good in Dickens, you know,\" she explained to Mrs.\nAshe; \"and I never saw a sole.\"\n\nThe soles when they came proved to be nice little pan-fish, not unlike\nwhat in New England are called \"scup.\" All the party took kindly to\nthem; but the muffins were a great disappointment, tough and tasteless,\nwith a flavor about them as of scorched flannel.\n\n\"How queer and disagreeable they are!\" said Katy. \"I feel as if I were\neating rounds cut from an old ironing-blanket and buttered! Dear me!\nwhat did Dickens mean by making such a fuss about them, I wonder? And I\ndon't care for gooseberry jam, either; it isn't half as good as the jams\nwe have at home. Books are very deceptive.\"\n\n\"I am afraid they are. We must make up our minds to find a great many\nthings not quite so nice as they sound when we read about them,\" replied\nMrs. Ashe.\n\nMabel was breakfasting with them, of course, and was heard to remark at\nthis juncture that she didn't like muffins, either, and would a great\ndeal rather have waffles; whereupon Amy reproved her, and explained that\nnobody in England knew what waffles were, they were such a stupid\nnation, and that Mabel must learn to eat whatever was given her and not\nfind fault with it!\n\nAfter this moral lesson it was found to be dangerously near train-time;\nand they all hurried to the railroad station, which, fortunately, was\nclose by. There was rather a scramble and confusion for a few moments;\nfor Katy, who had undertaken to buy the tickets, was puzzled by the\nunaccustomed coinage; and Mrs. Ashe, whose part was to see after the\nluggage, found herself perplexed and worried by the absence of checks,\nand by no means disposed to accept the porter's statement, that if she'd\nonly bear in mind that the trunks were in the second van from the\nengine, and get out to see that they were safe once or twice during the\njourney, and call for them as soon as they reached London, she'd have no\ntrouble,--\"please remember the porter, ma'am!\" However all was happily\nsettled at last; and without any serious inconveniences they found\nthemselves established in a first-class carriage, and presently after\nrunning smoothly at full speed across the rich English midlands toward\nLondon and the eastern coast.\n\nThe extreme greenness of the October landscape was what struck them\nfirst, and the wonderfully orderly and trim aspect of the country, with\nno ragged, stump-dotted fields or reaches of wild untended woods. Late\nin October as it was, the hedgerows and meadows were still almost\nsummer-like in color, though the trees were leafless. The\ndelightful-looking old manor-houses and farm-houses, of which they had\nglimpses now and again, were a constant pleasure to Katy, with their\nmullioned windows, twisted chimney-stacks, porches of quaint build, and\nthick-growing ivy. She contrasted them with the uncompromising ugliness\nof farm-houses which she remembered at home, and wondered whether it\ncould be that at the end of another thousand years or so, America would\nhave picturesque buildings like these to show in addition to her\npicturesque scenery.\n\nSuddenly into the midst of these reflections there glanced a picture so\nvivid that it almost took away her breath, as the train steamed past a\npack of hounds in full cry, followed by a galloping throng of\nscarlet-coated huntsmen. One horse and rider were in the air, going over\na wall. Another was just rising to the leap. A string of others, headed\nby a lady, were tearing across a meadow bounded by a little brook, and\nbeyond that streamed the hounds following the invisible fox. It was like\none of Muybridge's instantaneous photographs of \"The Horse in Motion,\"\nfor the moment that it lasted; and Katy put it away in her memory,\ndistinct and brilliant, as she might a real picture.\n\nTheir destination in London was Batt's Hotel in Dover Street. The old\ngentleman on the \"Spartacus,\" who had \"crossed\" so many times, had\nfurnished Mrs. Ashe with a number of addresses of hotels and\nlodging-houses, from among which Katy had chosen Batt's for the reason\nthat it was mentioned in Miss Edgeworth's \"Patronage.\" \"It was the\nplace,\" she explained, \"where Godfrey Percy didn't stay when Lord\nOldborough sent him the letter.\" It seemed an odd enough reason for\ngoing anywhere that a person in a novel didn't stay there. But Mrs. Ashe\nknew nothing of London, and had no preference of her own; so she was\nperfectly willing to give Katy hers, and Batt's was decided upon.\n\n\"It is just like a dream or a story,\" said Katy, as they drove away from\nthe London station in a four-wheeler. \"It is really ourselves, and this\nis really London! Can you imagine it?\"\n\nShe looked out. Nothing met her eyes but dingy weather, muddy streets,\nlong rows of ordinary brick or stone houses. It might very well have\nbeen New York or Boston on a foggy day, yet to her eyes all things had a\nsubtle difference which made them unlike similar objects at home.\n\n\"Wimpole Street!\" she cried suddenly, as she caught sight of the name on\nthe corner; \"that is the street where Maria Crawford in Mansfield Park,\nyou know, 'opened one of the best houses' after she married Mr.\nRushworth. Think of seeing Wimpole Street! What fun!\" She looked eagerly\nout after the \"best houses,\" but the whole street looked uninteresting\nand old-fashioned; the best house to be seen was not of a kind, Katy\nthought, to reconcile an ambitious young woman to a dull husband. Katy\nhad to remind herself that Miss Austen wrote her novels nearly a century\nago, that London was a \"growing\" place, and that things were probably\nmuch changed since that day.\n\nMore \"fun\" awaited them when they arrived at Batt's, and exactly such a\nlandlady sailed forth to welcome them as they had often met with in\nbooks,--an old landlady, smiling and rubicund, with a towering lace cap\non her head, a flowered silk gown, a gold chain, and a pair of fat\nmittened hands demurely crossed over a black brocade apron. She alone\nwould have been worth crossing the ocean to see, they all declared.\nTheir telegram had been received, and rooms were ready, with a bright,\nsmoky fire of soft coals; the dinner-table was set, and a nice, formal,\nwhite-cravated old waiter, who seemed to have stepped out of the same\nbook with the landlady, was waiting to serve it. Everything was dingy\nand old-fashioned, but very clean and comfortable; and Katy concluded\nthat on the whole Godfrey Percy would have done wisely to go to Batt's,\nand could have fared no better at the other hotel where he did stay.\n\nThe first of Katy's \"London sights\" came to her next morning before she\nwas out of her bedroom. She heard a bell ring and a queer squeaking\nlittle voice utter a speech of which she could not make out a single\nword. Then came a laugh and a shout, as if several boys were amused at\nsomething or other; and altogether her curiosity was roused, so that she\nfinished dressing as fast as she could, and ran to the drawing-room\nwindow which commanded a view of the street. Quite a little crowd was\ncollected under the window, and in their midst was a queer box raised\nhigh on poles, with little red curtains tied back on either side to form\na miniature stage, on which puppets were moving and vociferating. Katy\nknew in a moment that she was seeing her first Punch and Judy!\n\nThe box and the crowd began to move away. Katy in despair ran to\nWilkins, the old waiter who was setting the breakfast-table.\n\n\"Oh, please stop that man!\" she said. \"I want to see him.\"\n\n\"What man is it, Miss?\" said Wilkins.\n\nWhen he reached the window and realized what Katy meant, his sense of\npropriety seemed to receive a severe shock. He even ventured on\nremonstrance.\n\n\"H'I wouldn't, Miss, h'if h'I was you. Them Punches are a low lot, Miss;\nthey h'ought to be put down, really they h'ought. Gentlefolks, h'as a\ngeneral thing, pays no h'attention to them.\"\n\nBut Katy didn't care what \"gentlefolks\" did or did not do, and insisted\nupon having Punch called back. So Wilkins was forced to swallow his\nremonstrances and his dignity, and go in pursuit of the objectionable\nobject. Amy came rushing out, with her hair flying and Mabel in her\narms; and she and Katy had a real treat of Punch and Judy, with all the\nwell-known scenes, and perhaps a few new ones thrown in for their\nespecial behoof; for the showman seemed to be inspired by the rapturous\nenjoyment of his little audience of three at the first-floor windows.\nPunch beat Judy and stole the baby, and Judy banged Punch in return, and\nthe constable came in and Punch outwitted him, and the hangman and the\ndevil made their appearance duly; and it was all perfectly satisfactory,\nand \"just exactly what she hoped it would be, and it quite made up for\nthe muffins,\" Katy declared.\n\nThen, when Punch had gone away, the question arose as to what they\nshould choose, out of the many delightful things in London, for their\nfirst morning.\n\nLike ninety-nine Americans out of a hundred, they decided on Westminster\nAbbey; and indeed there is nothing in England better worth seeing, or\nmore impressive, in its dim, rich antiquity, to eyes fresh from the\nworld which still calls itself \"new.\" So to the Abbey they went, and\nlingered there till Mrs. Ashe declared herself to be absolutely dropping\nwith fatigue.\n\n\"If you don't take me home and give me something to eat,\" she said, \"I\nshall drop down on one of these pedestals and stay there and be\nexhibited forever after as an 'h'effigy' of somebody belonging to\nancient English history.\"\n\nSo Katy tore herself away from Henry the Seventh and the Poets' Corner,\nand tore Amy away from a quaint little tomb shaped like a cradle, with\nthe marble image of a baby in it, which had greatly taken her fancy. She\ncould only be consoled by the promise that she should soon come again\nand stay as long as she liked. She reminded Katy of this promise the\nvery next morning.\n\n\"Mamma has waked up with rather a bad headache, and she thinks she\nwill lie still and not come to breakfast,\" she reported. \"And she\nsends her love, and says will you please have a cab and go where you\nlike; and if I won't be a trouble, she would be glad if you would take\nme with you. And I won't be a trouble, Miss Katy, and I know where I\nwish you would go.\"\n\n\"Where is that!\"\n\n\"To see that cunning little baby again that we saw yesterday. I want to\nshow her to Mabel,--she didn't go with us, you know, and I don't like to\nhave her mind not improved; and, darling Miss Katy, mayn't I buy some\nflowers and put them on the Baby? She's so dusty and so old that I don't\nbelieve anybody has put any flowers for her for ever so long.\"\n\nKaty found this idea rather pretty, and willingly stopped at Covent\nGarden, where they bought a bunch of late roses for eighteen pence,\nwhich entirely satisfied Amy. With them in her hand, and Mabel in her\narms, she led the way through the dim aisles of the Abbey, through\ngrates and doors and up and down steps; the guide following, but not at\nall needed, for Amy seemed to have a perfectly clear recollection of\nevery turn and winding. When the chapel was reached, she laid the roses\non the tomb with gentle fingers, and a pitiful, reverent look in her\ngray eyes. Then she lifted Mabel up to kiss the odd little baby effigy\nabove the marble quilt; whereupon the guide seemed altogether surprised\nout of his composure, and remarked to Katy,--\n\n\"Little Miss is an h'American, as is plain to see; no h'English child\nwould be likely to think of doing such a thing.\"\n\n\"Do not English children take any interest in the tombs of the Abbey?\"\nasked Katy.\n\n\"Oh yes, m'm,--h'interest; but they don't take no special notice of one\ntomb above h'another.\"\n\nKaty could scarcely keep from laughing, especially as she heard Amy, who\nhad been listening to the conversation, give an audible sniff, and\ninform Mabel that she was glad _she_ was not an English child, who\ndidn't notice things and liked grown-up graves as much as she did dear\nlittle cunning ones like this!\n\nLater in the day, when Mrs. Ashe was better, they all drove together to\nthe quaint old keep which has been the scene of so many tragedies, and\nis known as the Tower of London. Here they were shown various rooms and\nchapels and prisons; and among the rest the apartments where Queen\nElizabeth, when a friendless young Princess, was shut up for many months\nby her sister, Queen Mary. Katy had read somewhere, and now told Amy,\nthe pretty legend of the four little children who lived with their\nparents in the Tower, and used to play with the royal captive; and how\none little boy brought her a key which he had picked up on the ground,\nand said, \"Now you can go out when you will, lady;\" and how the Lords of\nthe Council, getting wind of it, sent for the children to question them,\nand frightened them and their friends almost to death, and forbade them\nto go near the Princess again.\n\nA story about children always brings the past much nearer to a child,\nand Amy's imagination was so excited by this tale, that when they got to\nthe darksome closet which is said to have been the prison of Sir Walter\nRaleigh, she marched out of it with a pale and wrathful face.\n\n\"If this is English history, I never mean to learn any more of it, and\nneither shall Mabel,\" she declared.\n\nBut it is not possible for Amy or any one else not to learn a great deal\nof history simply by going about London. So many places are associated\nwith people or events, and seeing the places makes one care so much more\nfor the people or the events, that one insensibly questions and wonders.\nKaty, who had \"browsed\" all through her childhood in a good\nold-fashioned library, had her memory stuffed with all manner of little\nscraps of information and literary allusions, which now came into use.\nIt was like owning the disjointed bits of a puzzle, and suddenly\ndiscovering that properly put together they make a pattern. Mrs. Ashe,\nwho had never been much of a reader, considered her young friend a\nprodigy of intelligence; but Katy herself realized how inadequate and\ninexact her knowledge was, and how many bits were missing from the\npattern of her puzzle. She wished with all her heart, as every one\nwishes under such circumstances, that she had studied harder and more\nwisely while the chance was in her power. On a journey you cannot read\nto advantage. Remember that, dear girls, who are looking forward to\ntravelling some day, and be industrious in time.\n\nOctober is not a favorable month in which to see England. Water, water\nis everywhere; you breathe it, you absorb it; it wets your clothes and\nit dampens your spirits. Mrs. Ashe's friends advised her not to think of\nScotland at that time of the year. One by one their little intended\nexcursions were given up. A single day and night in Oxford and\nStratford-on-Avon; a short visit to the Isle of Wight, where, in a\ncountry-place which seemed provokingly pretty as far as they could see\nit for the rain, lived that friend of Mrs. Ashe who had married an\nEnglishman and in so doing had, as Katy privately thought, \"renounced\nthe sun;\" a peep at Stonehenge from under the shelter of an umbrella,\nand an hour or two in Salisbury Cathedral,--was all that they\naccomplished, except a brief halt at Winchester, that Katy might have\nthe privilege of seeing the grave of her beloved Miss Austen. Katy had\ncome abroad with a terribly long list of graves to visit, Mrs. Ashe\ndeclared. They laid a few rain-washed flowers upon the tomb, and\nlistened with edification to the verger, who inquired,--\n\n\"Whatever was it, ma'am, that lady did which brings so many h'Americans\nto h'ask about her? Our h'English people don't seem to take the same\nh'interest.\"\n\n\"She wrote such delightful stories,\" explained Katy; but the old verger\nshook his head.\n\n\"I think h'it must be some other party, Miss, you've confused with this\nhere. It stands to reason, Miss, that we'd have heard of 'em h'over 'ere\nin England sooner than you would h'over there in h'America, if the books\n'ad been h'anything so h'extraordinary.\"\n\nThe night after their return to London they were dining for the second\ntime with the cousins of whom Mrs. Ashe had spoken to Dr. Carr; and as\nit happened Katy sat next to a quaint elderly American, who had lived\nfor twenty years in London and knew it much better than most Londoners\ndo. This gentleman, Mr. Allen Beach, had a hobby for antiquities, old\nbooks especially, and passed half his time at the British Museum, and\nthe other half in sales rooms and the old shops in Wardour Street.\n\nKaty was lamenting over the bad weather which stood in the way of\ntheir plans.\n\n\"It is so vexatious,\" she said. \"Mrs. Ashe meant to go to York and\nLincoln and all the cathedral towns and to Scotland; and we have had to\ngive it all up because of the rains. We shall go away having seen hardly\nanything.\"\n\n\"You can see London.\"\n\n\"We have,--that is, we have seen the things that everybody sees.\"\n\n\"But there are so many things that people in general do not see. How\nmuch longer are you to stay, Miss Carr?\"\n\n\"A week, I believe.\"\n\n\"Why don't you make out a list of old buildings which are connected with\nfamous people in history, and visit them in turn? I did that the second\nyear after I came. I gave up three months to it, and it was most\ninteresting. I unearthed all manner of curious stories and traditions.\"\n\n\"Or,\" cried Katy, struck with a sudden bright thought, \"why mightn't\nI put into the list some of the places I know about in books,--novels\nas well as history,--and the places where the people who wrote the\nbooks lived?\"\n\n\"You might do that, and it wouldn't be a bad idea, either,\" said Mr.\nBeach, pleased with her enthusiasm. \"I will get a pencil after dinner\nand help you with your list if you will allow me.\"\n\nMr. Beach was better than his word. He not only suggested places and\ntraced a plan of sight-seeing, but on two different mornings he went\nwith them himself; and his intelligent knowledge of London added very\nmuch to the interest of the excursions. Under his guidance the little\nparty of four--for Mabel was never left out; it was _such_ a chance for\nher to improve her mind, Amy declared--visited the Charter-House, where\nThackeray went to school, and the Home of the Poor Brothers connected\nwith it, in which Colonel Newcome answered \"Adsum\" to the roll-call of\nthe angels. They took a look at the small house in Curzon Street, which\nis supposed to have been in Thackeray's mind when he described the\nresidence of Becky Sharpe; and the other house in Russell Square which\nis unmistakably that where George Osborne courted Amelia Sedley. They\nwent to service in the delightful old church of St. Mary in the Temple,\nand thought of Ivanhoe and Brian de Bois-Guilbert and Rebecca the\nJewess. From there Mr. Beach took them to Lamb's Court, where Pendennis\nand George Warrington dwelt in chambers together; and to Brick Court,\nwhere Oliver Goldsmith passed so much of his life, and the little rooms\nin which Charles and Mary Lamb spent so many sadly happy years. On\nanother day they drove to Whitefriars, for the sake of Lord Glenvarloch\nand the old privilege of Sanctuary in the \"Fortunes of Nigel;\" and took\na peep at Bethnal Green, where the Blind Beggar and his \"Pretty Bessee\"\nlived, and at the old Prison of the Marshalsea, made interesting by its\nassociations with \"Little Dorrit.\" They also went to see Milton's house\nand St. Giles Church, in which he is buried; and stood a long time\nbefore St. James Palace, trying to make out which could have been Miss\nBurney's windows when she was dresser to Queen Charlotte of bitter\nmemory. And they saw Paternoster Row and No. 5 Cheyne Walk, sacred\nforevermore to the memory of Thomas Carlyle, and Whitehall, where Queen\nElizabeth lay in state and King Charles was beheaded, and the state\nrooms of Holland House; and by great good luck had a glimpse of George\nEliot getting out of a cab. She stood for a moment while she gave her\nfare to the cabman, and Katy looked as one who might not look again, and\ncarried away a distinct picture of the unbeautiful, interesting,\nremarkable face.\n\nWith all this to see and to do, the last week sped all too swiftly, and\nthe last day came before they were at all ready to leave what Katy\ncalled \"Story-book England.\" Mrs. Ashe had decided to cross by Newhaven\nand Dieppe, because some one had told her of the beautiful old town of\nRouen, and it seemed easy and convenient to take it on the way to Paris.\nJust landed from the long voyage across the Atlantic, the little passage\nof the Channel seemed nothing to our travellers, and they made ready for\ntheir night on the Dieppe steamer with the philosophy which is born of\nignorance. They were speedily undeceived!\n\nThe English Channel has a character of its own, which distinguishes it\nfrom other seas and straits. It seems made fractious and difficult by\nNature, and set as on purpose to be barrier between two nations who are\ntoo unlike to easily understand each other, and are the safer neighbors\nfor this wholesome difficulty of communication between them. The \"chop\"\nwas worse than usual on the night when our travellers crossed; the\nsteamer had to fight her way inch by inch. And oh, such a little\nsteamer! and oh, such a long night!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nACROSS THE CHANNEL.\n\n\nDawn had given place to day, and day was well advanced toward noon,\nbefore the stout little steamer gained her port. It was hours after\nthe usual time for arrival; the train for Paris must long since have\nstarted, and Katy felt dejected and forlorn as, making her way out of\nthe terrible ladies'-cabin, she crept on deck for her first glimpse\nof France.\n\nThe sun was struggling through the fog with a watery smile, and his\nfaint beams shone on a confusion of stone piers, higher than the\nvessel's deck, intersected with canal-like waterways, through whose\nintricate windings the steamer was slowly threading her course to the\nlanding-place. Looking up, Katy could see crowds of people assembled to\nwatch the boat come in,--workmen, peasants, women, children, soldiers,\ncustom-house officers, moving to and fro,--and all this crowd were\ntalking all at once and all were talking French!\n\nI don't know why this should have startled her as it did. She knew, of\ncourse, that people of different countries were liable to be found\nspeaking their own languages; but somehow the spectacle of the\nchattering multitude, all seeming so perfectly at ease with their\npreterits and subjunctives and never once having to refer to Ollendorf\nor a dictionary, filled her with a sense of dismayed surprise.\n\n\"Good gracious!\" she said to herself, \"even the babies understand it!\"\nShe racked her brains to recall what she had once known of French, but\nvery little seemed to have survived the horrors of the night!\n\n\"Oh dear! what is the word for trunk-key?\" she asked herself. \"They will\nall begin to ask questions, and I shall not have a word to say; and Mrs.\nAshe will be even worse off, I know.\" She saw the red-trousered\ncustom-house officers pounce upon the passengers as they landed one by\none, and she felt her heart sink within her.\n\nBut after all, when the time came it did not prove so very bad. Katy's\npleasant looks and courteous manner stood her in good stead. She did not\ntrust herself to say much; but the officials seemed to understand\nwithout saying. They bowed and gestured, whisked the keys in and out,\nand in a surprisingly short time all was pronounced right, the baggage\nhad \"passed,\" and it and its owners were free to proceed to the\nrailway-station, which fortunately was close at hand.\n\nInquiry revealed the fact that no train for Paris left till four in the\nafternoon.\n\n\"I am rather glad,\" declared poor Mrs. Ashe, \"for I feel too used up to\nmove. I will lie here on this sofa; and, Katy dear, please see if there\nis an eating-place, and get some breakfast for yourself and Amy, and\nsend me a cup of tea.\"\n\n\"I don't like to leave you alone,\" Katy was beginning; but at that\nmoment a nice old woman who seemed to be in charge of the waiting-room\nappeared, and with a flood of French which none of them could follow,\nbut which was evidently sympathetic in its nature, flew at Mrs. Ashe and\nbegan to make her comfortable. From a cupboard in the wall she produced\na pillow, from another cupboard a blanket; in a trice she had one under\nMrs. Ashe's head and the other wrapped round her feet.\n\n\"Pauvre madame,\" she said, \"si p\u00c3\u00a2le! si souffrante! Il faut avoir\nquelque chose \u00c3\u00a0 boire et \u00c3\u00a0 manger tout de suite.\" She trotted across the\nroom and into the restaurant which opened out of it, while Mrs. Ashe\nsmiled at Katy and said, \"You see you can leave me quite safely; I am to\nbe taken care of.\" And Katy and Amy passed through the same door into\nthe _buffet_, and sat down at a little table.\n\nIt was a particularly pleasant-looking place to breakfast in. There were\nmany windows with bright polished panes and very clean short muslin\ncurtains, and on the window-sills stood rows of thrifty potted plants in\nfull bloom,--marigolds, balsams, nasturtiums, and many colored\ngeraniums. Two birds in cages were singing loudly; the floor was waxed\nto a glass-like polish; nothing could have been whiter than the marble\nof the tables except the napkins laid over them. And such a good\nbreakfast as was presently brought to them,--delicious coffee in\nbowl-like cups, crisp rolls and rusks, an omelette with a delicate\nflavor of fine herbs, stewed chicken, little pats of freshly churned\nbutter without salt, shaped like shells and tasting like solidified\ncream, and a pot of some sort of nice preserve. Amy made great delighted\neyes at Katy, and remarking, \"I think France is heaps nicer than that\nold England,\" began to eat with a will; and Katy herself felt that if\nthis railroad meal was a specimen of what they had to expect in the\nfuture, they had indeed come to a land of plenty.\n\nFortified with the satisfactory breakfast, she felt equal to a walk; and\nafter they had made sure that Mrs. Ashe had all she needed, she and Amy\n(and Mabel) set off by themselves to see the sights of Dieppe. I don't\nknow that travellers generally have considered Dieppe an interesting\nplace, but Katy found it so. There was a really old church and some\nquaint buildings of the style of two centuries back, and even the more\nmodern streets had a novel look to her unaccustomed eyes. At first they\nonly ventured a timid turn or two, marking each corner, and going back\nnow and then to reassure themselves by a look at the station; but after\na while, growing bolder, Katy ventured to ask a question or two in\nFrench, and was surprised and charmed to find herself understood. After\nthat she grew adventurous, and, no longer fearful of being lost, led Amy\nstraight down a long street lined with shops, almost all of which were\nfor the sale of articles in ivory.\n\nIvory wares are one of the chief industries of Dieppe. There were cases\nfull, windows full, counters full, of the most exquisite combs and\nbrushes, some with elaborate monograms in silver and colors, others\nplain; there were boxes and caskets of every size and shape, ornaments,\nfans, parasol handles, looking-glasses, frames for pictures large and\nsmall, napkin-rings.\n\nKaty was particularly smitten with a paper-knife in the form of an angel\nwith long slender wings raised over its head and meeting to form a\npoint. Its price was twenty francs, and she was strongly tempted to buy\nit for Clover or Rose Red. But she said to herself sensibly, \"This is\nthe first shop I have been into and the first thing I have really wanted\nto buy, and very likely as we go on I shall see things I like better and\nwant more, so it would be foolish to do it. No, I won't.\" And she\nresolutely turned her back on the ivory angel, and walked away.\n\nThe next turn brought them to a gay-looking little market-place, where\nold women in white caps were sitting on the ground beside baskets and\npanniers full of apples, pears, and various queer and curly vegetables,\nnone of which Katy recognized as familiar; fish of all shapes and colors\nwere flapping in shallow tubs of sea-water; there were piles of\nstockings, muffetees, and comforters in vivid blue and red worsted, and\ncoarse pottery glazed in bright patterns. The faces of the women were\nbrown and wrinkled; there were no pretty ones among them, but their\nblack eyes were full of life and quickness, and their fingers one and\nall clicked with knitting-needles, as their tongues flew equally fast in\nthe chatter and the chaffer, which went on without stop or stay, though\ncustomers did not seem to be many and sales were few.\n\nReturning to the station they found that Mrs. Ashe had been asleep\nduring their absence, and seemed so much better that it was with greatly\namended spirits that they took their places in the late afternoon train\nwhich was to set them down at Rouen. Katy said they were like the Wise\nMen of the East, \"following a star,\" in their choice of a hotel; for,\nhaving no better advice, they had decided upon one of those thus\ndistinguished in Baedeker's Guide-book.\n\nThe star did not betray their confidence; for the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de la Cloche, to\nwhich it led them, proved to be quaint and old, and very pleasant of\naspect. The lofty chambers, with their dimly frescoed ceilings, and beds\ncurtained with faded patch, might to all appearances have been furnished\nabout the time when \"Columbus crossed the ocean blue;\" but everything\nwas clean, and had an air of old-time respectability. The dining-room,\nwhich was evidently of more modern build, opened into a square courtyard\nwhere oleanders and lemon trees in boxes stood round the basin of a\nlittle fountain, whose tinkle and plash blended agreeably with the\nrattle of the knives and forks. In one corner of the room was a raised\nand railed platform, where behind a desk sat the mistress of the house,\nbusy with her account-books, but keeping an eye the while on all that\nwent forward.\n\nMrs. Ashe walked past this personage without taking any notice of her,\nas Americans are wont to do under such circumstances; but presently the\nobservant Katy noticed that every one else, as they went in or out of\nthe room, addressed a bow or a civil remark to this lady. She quite\nblushed at the recollection afterward, as she made ready for bed.\n\n\"How rude we must have seemed!\" she thought. \"I am afraid the people\nhere think that Americans have _awful_ manners, everybody is so polite.\nThey said 'Bon soir' and 'Merci' and 'Voulez-vous avoir la bont\u00c3\u00a9,' to\nthe waiters even! Well, there is one thing,--I am going to reform.\nTo-morrow I will be as polite as anybody. They will think that I am\nmiraculously improved by one night on French soil; but, never mind! I am\ngoing to do it.\"\n\nShe kept her resolution, and astonished Mrs. Ashe next morning, by\nbowing to the dame on the platform in the most winning manner, and\nsaying, \"Bon jour, madame,\" as they went by.\n\n\"But, Katy, who is that person? Why do you speak to her?\"\n\n\"Don't you see that they all do? She is the landlady, I think; at all\nevents, everybody bows to her. And just notice how prettily these ladies\nat the next table speak to the waiter. They do not order him to do\nthings as we do at home. I noticed it last night, and I liked it so much\nthat I made a resolution to get up and be as polite as the French\nthemselves this morning.\"\n\nSo all the time that they went about the sumptuous old city, rich in\ncarvings and sculptures and traditions, while they were looking at the\nCathedral and the wonderful church of St. Ouen, and the Palace of\nJustice, and the \"Place of the Maid,\" where poor Jeanne d'Arc was burned\nand her ashes scattered to the winds, Katy remembered her manners, and\nsmiled and bowed, and used courteous prefixes in a soft pleasant voice;\nand as Mrs. Ashe and Amy fell in with her example more or less, I think\nthe guides and coachmen and the old women who showed them over the\nbuildings felt that the air of France was very civilizing indeed, and\nthat these strangers from savage countries over the sea were in a fair\nway to be as well bred as if they had been born in a more favored part\nof the world!\n\nParis looked very modern after the peculiar quaint richness and air of\nthe Middle Ages which distinguish Rouen. Rooms had been engaged for\nMrs. Ashe's party in a _pension_ near the Arc d'\u00c3\u0089toile, and there they\ndrove immediately on arriving. The rooms were not in the _pension_\nitself, but in a house close by,--a sitting-room with six mirrors,\nthree clocks, and a pinched little grate about a foot wide, a\ndining-room just large enough for a table and four chairs, and two\nbedrooms. A maid called Amandine had been detailed to take charge of\nthese rooms and serve their meals.\n\nDampness, as Katy afterward wrote to Clover, was the first impression\nthey received of \"gay Paris.\" The tiny fire in the tiny grate had only\njust been lighted, and the walls and the sheets and even the blankets\nfelt chilly and moist to the touch. They spent their first evening in\nhanging the bedclothes round the grate and piling on fuel; they even set\nthe mattresses up on edge to warm and dry! It was not very enlivening,\nit must be confessed. Amy had taken a cold, Mrs. Ashe looked worried,\nand Katy thought of Burnet and the safety and comfort of home with a\nthrob of longing.\n\nThe days that ensued were not brilliant enough to remove this\nimpression. The November fogs seemed to have followed them across the\nChannel, and Paris remained enveloped in a wet blanket which dimmed and\nhid its usually brilliant features. Going about in cabs with the windows\ndrawn up, and now and then making a rush through the drip into shops,\nwas not exactly delightful, but it seemed pretty much all that they\ncould do. It was worse for Amy, whose cold kept her indoors and denied\nher even the relaxation of the cab. Mrs. Ashe had engaged a\nwell-recommended elderly English maid to come every morning and take\ncare of Amy while they were out; and with this respectable functionary,\nwhose ideas were of a rigidly British type and who did not speak a word\nof any language but her own, poor Amy was compelled to spend most of her\ntime. Her only consolation was in persuading this serene attendant to\ntake a part in the French lessons which she made a daily point of giving\nto Mabel out of her own little phrase-book.\n\n\"Wilkins is getting on, I think,\" she told Katy one night. \"She says\n'Biscuit glac\u00c3\u00a9' quite nicely now. But I never will let her look at the\nbook, though she always wants to; for if once she saw how the words are\nspelled, she would never in the world pronounce them right again. They\nlook so very different, you know.\"\n\nKaty looked at Amy's pale little face and eager eyes with a real\nheartache. Her rapture when at the end of the long dull afternoons her\nmother returned to her was touching. Paris was very _triste_ to poor\nAmy, with all her happy facility for amusing herself; and Katy felt that\nthe sooner they got away from it the better it would be. So, in spite of\nthe delight which her brief glimpses at the Louvre gave her, and the fun\nit was to go about with Mrs. Ashe and see her buy pretty things, and the\nreal satisfaction she took in the one perfectly made walking-suit to\nwhich she had treated herself, she was glad when the final day came,\nwhen the belated dressmakers and artistes in jackets and wraps had sent\nhome their last wares, and the trunks were packed. It had been rather\nthe fault of circumstances than of Paris; but Katy had not learned to\nlove the beautiful capital as most Americans do, and did not feel at all\nas if she wanted that her \"reward of virtue\" should be to go there when\nshe died! There must be more interesting places for live people, and\nghosts too, to be found on the map of Europe, she was sure.\n\nNext morning as they drove slowly down the Champs \u00c3\u0089lys\u00c3\u00a9es, and\nlooked back for a last glimpse of the famous Arch, a bright object\nmet their eyes, moving vaguely against the mist. It was the gay red\nwagon of the Bon March\u00c3\u00a9, carrying bundles home to the dwellers of\nsome up-town street.\n\nKaty burst out laughing. \"It is an emblem of Paris,\" she said,--\"of our\nParis, I mean. It has been all Bon March\u00c3\u00a9 and fog!\"\n\n\"Miss Katy,\" interrupted Amy, \"_do_ you like Europe? For my part, I was\nnever so disgusted with any place in my life!\"\n\n\"Poor little bird, her views of 'Europe' are rather dark just now, and\nno wonder,\" said her mother. \"Never mind, darling, you shall have\nsomething pleasanter by and by if I can find it for you.\"\n\n\"Burnet is a great deal pleasanter than Paris,\" pronounced Amy,\ndecidedly. \"It doesn't keep always raining there, and I can take walks,\nand I understand everything that people say.\"\n\nAll that day they sped southward, and with every hour came a change in\nthe aspect of their surroundings. Now they made brief stops in large\nbusy towns which seemed humming with industry. Now they whirled through\ngrape countries with miles of vineyards, where the brown leaves still\nhung on the vines. Then again came glimpses of old Roman ruins,\namphitheatres, viaducts, fragments of wall or arch; or a sudden chill\nbetokened their approach to mountains, where snowy peaks could be seen\non the far horizon. And when the long night ended and day roused them\nfrom broken slumbers, behold, the world was made over! Autumn had\nvanished, and the summer, which they thought fled for good, had taken\nhis place. Green woods waved about them, fresh leaves were blowing in\nthe wind, roses and hollyhocks beckoned from white-walled gardens; and\nbefore they had done with exclaiming and rejoicing, the Mediterranean\nshot into view, intensely blue, with white fringes of foam, white sails\nblowing across, white gulls flying above it, and over all a sky of the\nsame exquisite blue, whose clouds were white as the drifting sails on\nthe water below, and they were at Marseilles.\n\nIt was like a glimpse of Paradise to eyes fresh from autumnal grays and\nglooms, as they sped along the lovely coast, every curve and turn\nshowing new combinations of sea and shore, olive-crowned cliff and\nshining mountain-peak. With every mile the blue became bluer, the wind\nsofter, the feathery verdure more dense and summer-like. Hy\u00c3\u00a8res and\nCannes and Antibes were passed, and then, as they rounded a long point,\ncame the view of a sunshiny city lying on a sunlit shore; the train\nslackened its speed, and they knew that their journey's end was come and\nthey were in Nice.\n\nThe place seemed to laugh with gayety as they drove down the Promenade\ndes Anglais and past the English garden, where the band was playing\nbeneath the acacias and palm-trees. On one side was a line of\nbright-windowed hotels and _pensions_, with balconies and striped\nawnings; on the other, the long reach of yellow sand-beach, where ladies\nwere grouped on shawls and rugs, and children ran up and down in the\nsun, while beyond stretched the waveless sea. The December sun felt as\nwarm as on a late June day at home, and had the same soft caressing\ntouch. The pavements were thronged with groups of leisurely-looking\npeople, all wearing an unmistakable holiday aspect; pretty girls in\ncorrect Parisian costumes walked demurely beside their mothers, with\ncavaliers in attendance; and among these young men appeared now and\nagain the well-known uniform of the United States Navy.\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Mrs. Ashe, struck by a sudden thought, \"if by any\nchance our squadron is here.\" She asked the question the moment they\nentered the hotel; and the porter, who prided himself on understanding\n\"zose Eenglesh,\" replied,--\n\n\"Mais oui, Madame, ze Americaine fleet it is here; zat is, not here,\nbut at Villefranche, just a leetle four mile away,--it is ze same\nzing exactly.\"\n\n\"Katy, do you hear that?\" cried Mrs. Ashe. \"The frigates _are_ here, and\nthe 'Natchitoches' among them of course; and we shall have Ned to go\nabout with us everywhere. It is a real piece of good luck for us. Ladies\nare at such a loss in a place like this with nobody to escort them. I am\nperfectly delighted.\"\n\n\"So am I,\" said Katy. \"I never saw a frigate, and I always wanted to see\none. Do you suppose they will let us go on board of them?\"\n\n\"Why, of course they will.\" Then to the porter, \"Give me a sheet\nof paper and an envelope, please.--I must let Ned know that I am\nhere at once.\"\n\nMrs. Ashe wrote her note and despatched it before they went upstairs to\ntake off their bonnets. She seemed to have a half-hope that some bird of\nthe air might carry the news of her arrival to her brother, for she kept\nrunning to the window as if in expectation of seeing him. She was too\nrestless to lie down or sleep, and after she and Katy had lunched,\nproposed that they should go out on the beach for a while.\n\n\"Perhaps we may come across Ned,\" she remarked.\n\nThey did not come across Ned, but there was no lack of other\ndelightful objects to engage their attention. The sands were smooth\nand hard as a floor. Soft pink lights were beginning to tinge the\nwestern sky. To the north shone the peaks of the maritime Alps, and\nthe same rosy glow caught them here and there, and warmed their grays\nand whites into color.\n\n\"I wonder what that can be?\" said Katy, indicating the rocky point which\nbounded the beach to the east, where stood a picturesque building of\nstone, with massive towers and steep pitches of roof. \"It looks half\nlike a house and half like a castle, but it is quite fascinating, I\nthink. Do you suppose that people live there?\"\n\n\"We might ask,\" suggested Mrs. Ashe.\n\nJust then they came to a shallow river spanned by a bridge, beside whose\npebbly bed stood a number of women who seemed to be washing clothes by\nthe simple and primitive process of laying them in the water on top of\nthe stones, and pounding them with a flat wooden paddle till they were\nwhite. Katy privately thought that the clothes stood a poor chance of\nlasting through these cleansing operations; but she did not say so, and\nmade the inquiry which Mrs. Ashe had suggested, in her best French.\n\n\"Celle-l\u00c3\u00a0?\" answered the old woman whom she had addressed. \"Mais c'est\nla Pension Suisse.\"\n\n\"A _pension_; why, that means a boarding-house,\" cried Katy. \"What fun\nit must be to board there!\"\n\n\"Well, why shouldn't we board there!\" said her friend. \"You know we\nmeant to look for rooms as soon as we were rested and had found out a\nlittle about the place. Let us walk on and see what the Pension Suisse\nis like. If the inside is as pleasant as the outside, we could not do\nbetter, I should think.\"\n\n\"Oh, I do hope all the rooms are not already taken,\" said Katy, who had\nfallen in love at first sight with the Pension Suisse. She felt quite\noppressed with anxiety as they rang the bell.\n\nThe Pension Suisse proved to be quite as charming inside as out. The\nthick stone walls made deep sills and embrasures for the casement\nwindows, which were furnished with red cushions to serve as seats and\nlounging-places. Every window seemed to command a view, for those which\ndid not look toward the sea looked toward the mountains. The house was\nby no means full, either. Several sets of rooms were to be had; and Katy\nfelt as if she had walked straight into the pages of a romance When Mrs.\nAshe engaged for a month a delightful suite of three, a sitting-room and\ntwo sleeping-chambers, in a round tower, with a balcony overhanging the\nwater, and a side window, from which a flight of steps led down into a\nlittle walled garden, nestled in among the masonry, where tall\nlaurestinus and lemon trees grew, and orange and brown wallflowers made\nthe air sweet. Her contentment knew no bounds.\n\n\"I am so glad that I came,\" she told Mrs. Ashe. \"I never confessed it to\nyou before; but sometimes.--when we were sick at sea, you know, and when\nit would rain all the time, and after Amy caught that cold in Paris--I\nhave almost wished, just for a minute or two at a time, that we hadn't.\nBut now I wouldn't not have come for the world! This is perfectly\ndelicious. I am glad, glad, glad we are here, and we are going to have a\nlovely time, I know.\"\n\nThey were passing out of the rooms into the hall as she said these\nwords, and two ladies who were walking up a cross passage turned their\nheads at the sound of her voice. To her great surprise Katy recognized\nMrs. Page and Lilly.\n\n\"Why, Cousin Olivia, is it you?\" she cried, springing forward with\nthe cordiality one naturally feels in seeing a familiar face in a\nforeign land.\n\nMrs. Page seemed rather puzzled than cordial. She put up her eyeglass\nand did not seem to quite make out who Katy was.\n\n\"It is Katy Carr, mamma,\" explained Lilly. \"Well, Katy, this _is_ a\nsurprise! Who would have thought of meeting you in Nice!\"\n\nThere was a decided absence of rapture in Lilly's manner. She was\nprettier than ever, as Katy saw in a moment, and beautifully dressed in\nsoft brown velvet, which exactly suited her complexion and her\npale-colored wavy hair.\n\n\"Katy Carr! why, so it is,\" admitted Mrs. Page. \"It is a surprise\nindeed. We had no idea that you were abroad. What has brought you so far\nfrom Tunket,--Burnet, I mean? Who are you with?\"\n\n\"With my friend Mrs. Ashe,\" explained Katy, rather chilled by this cool\nreception.\n\n\"Let me introduce you. Mrs. Ashe, these are my cousins Mrs. Page and\nMiss Page. Amy,--why where is Amy?\"\n\nAmy had walked back to the door of the garden staircase, and was\nstanding there looking down upon the flowers.\n\nCousin Olivia bowed rather distantly. Her quick eye took in the details\nof Mrs. Ashe's travelling-dress and Katy's dark blue ulster.\n\n\"Some countrified friend from that dreadful Western town where they\nlive,\" she said to herself. \"How foolish of Philip Carr to try to send\nhis girls to Europe! He can't afford it, I know.\" Her voice was rather\nrigid as she inquired,--\n\n\"And what brings you here?--to this house, I mean?\"\n\n\"Oh, we are coming to-morrow to stay; we have taken rooms for a month,\"\nexplained Katy. \"What a delicious-looking old place it is.\"\n\n\"Have you?\" said Lilly, in a voice which did not express any particular\npleasure. \"Why, we are staying here too.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nTHE PENSION SUISSE.\n\n\n\"What do you suppose can have brought Katy Carr to Europe?\" inquired\nLilly, as she stood in the window watching the three figures walk slowly\ndown the sands. \"She is the last person I expected to turn up here. I\nsupposed she was stuck in that horrid place--what is the name of\nit?--where they live, for the rest of her life.\"\n\n\"I confess I am surprised at meeting her myself,\" rejoined Mrs. Page. \"I\nhad no idea that her father could afford so expensive a journey.\"\n\n\"And who is this woman that she has got along with her?\"\n\n\"I have no idea, I'm sure. Some Western friend, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Dear me, I wish they were going to some other house than this,\" said\nLilly, discontentedly. \"If they were at the Rivoir, for instance, or one\nof those places at the far end of the beach, we shouldn't need to see\nanything of them, or even know that they were in town! It's a real\nnuisance to have people spring upon you this way, people you don't want\nto meet; and when they happen to be relations it is all the worse. Katy\nwill be hanging on us all the time, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear, there is no fear of that. A little repression on our part\nwill prevent her from being any trouble, I'm quite certain. But we\n_must_ treat her politely, you know, Lilly; her father is my cousin.\"\n\n\"That's the saddest part of it! Well, there's one thing, I shall _not_\ntake her with me every time we go to the frigates,\" said Lilly,\ndecisively. \"I am not going to inflict a country cousin on Lieutenant\nWorthington, and spoil all my own fun beside. So I give you fair\nwarning, mamma, and you must manage it somehow.\"\n\n\"Certainly, dear, I will. It would be a great pity to have your visit to\nNice spoiled in any way, with the squadron here too, and that pleasant\nMr. Worthington so very attentive.\"\n\nUnconscious of these plans for her suppression, Katy walked back to the\nhotel in a mood of pensive pleasure. Europe at last promised to be as\ndelightful as it had seemed when she only knew it from maps and books,\nand Nice so far appeared to her the most charming place in the world.\n\nSomebody was waiting for them at the Hotel des Anglais,--a tall,\nbronzed, good-looking somebody in uniform, with pleasant brown eyes\nbeaming from beneath a gold-banded cap; at the sight of whom Amy rushed\nforward with her long locks flying, and Mrs. Ashe uttered an exclamation\nof pleasure. It was Ned Worthington, Mrs. Ashe's only brother, whom she\nhad not met for two years and a half; and you can easily imagine how\nglad she was to see him.\n\n\"You got my note then?\" she said after the first eager greetings were\nover and she had introduced him to Katy.\n\n\"Note? No. Did you write me a note?\"\n\n\"Yes; to Villefranche.\"\n\n\"To the ship? I shan't get that till tomorrow. No; finding out that you\nwere here is just a bit of good fortune. I came over to call on some\nfriends who are staying down the beach a little way, and dropping in to\nlook over the list of arrivals, as I generally do, I saw your names; and\nthe porter not being able to say which way you had gone, I waited for\nyou to come in.\"\n\n\"We have been looking at such a delightful old place, the Pension\nSuisse, and have taken rooms.\"\n\n\"The Pension Suisse, eh? Why, that was where I was going to call. I know\nsome people who are staying there. It seems a pleasant house; I'm glad\nyou are going there, Polly. It's first-rate luck that the ships happen\nto be here just now. I can see you every day.\"\n\n\"But, Ned, surely you are not leaving me so soon? Surely you will stay\nand dine with us?\" urged his sister, as he took up his cap.\n\n\"I wish I could, but I can't to-night, Polly. You see I had engaged to\ntake some ladies out to drive, and they will expect me. I had no idea\nthat you would be here, or I should have kept myself free,\"\napologetically. \"Tomorrow I will come over early, and be at your service\nfor whatever you like to do.\"\n\n\"That's right, dear boy. We shall expect you.\" Then, the moment he was\ngone, \"Now, Katy, isn't he nice?\"\n\n\"Very nice, I should think,\" said Katy, who had watched the brief\ninterview with interest. \"I like his face so much, and how fond he\nis of you!\"\n\n\"Dear fellow! so he is. I am seven years older than he, but we have\nalways been intimate. Brothers and sisters are not always intimate, you\nknow,--or perhaps you don't know, for all of yours are.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said Katy, with a happy smile. \"There is nobody like\nClover and Elsie, except perhaps Johnnie and Dorry and Phil,\" she added\nwith a laugh.\n\nThe remove to the Pension Suisse was made early the next morning. Mrs.\nPage and Lilly did not appear to welcome them. Katy rather rejoiced in\ntheir absence, for she wanted the chance to get into order without\ninterruptions.\n\nThere was something comfortable in the thought that they were to stay a\nwhole month in these new quarters; for so long a time, it seemed worth\nwhile to make them pretty and homelike. So, while Mrs. Ashe unpacked her\nown belongings and Amy's, Katy, who had a natural turn for arranging\nrooms, took possession of the little parlor, pulled the furniture into\nnew positions, laid out portfolios and work-cases and their few books,\npinned various photographs which they had bought in Oxford and London on\nthe walls, and tied back the curtains to admit the sunshine. Then she\npaid a visit to the little garden, and came back with a long branch of\nlaurestinus, which she trained across the mantelpiece, and a bunch of\nwallflowers for their one little vase. The maid, by her orders, laid a\nfire of wood and pine cones ready for lighting; and when all was done\nshe called Mrs. Ashe to pronounce upon the effect.\n\n\"It is lovely,\" she said, sinking into a great velvet arm-chair which\nKaty had drawn close to the seaward window. \"I haven't seen anything so\npleasant since we left home. You are a witch, Katy, and the comfort of\nmy life. I am so glad I brought you! Now, pray go and unpack your own\nthings, and make yourself look nice for the second breakfast. We have\nbeen a shabby set enough since we arrived. I saw those cousins of yours\nlooking askance at our old travelling-dresses yesterday. Let us try to\nmake a more respectable impression to-day.\"\n\nSo they went down to breakfast, Mrs. Ashe in one of her new Paris gowns,\nKaty in a pretty dress of olive serge, and Amy all smiles and ruffled\npinafore, walking hand in hand with her uncle Ned, who had just arrived\nand whose great ally she was; and Mrs. Page and Lilly, who were already\nseated at table, had much ado to conceal their somewhat unflattering\nsurprise at the conjunction. For one moment Lilly's eyes opened into a\nwide stare of incredulous astonishment; then she remembered herself,\nnodded as pleasantly as she could to Mrs. Ashe and Katy, and favored\nLieutenant Worthington with a pretty blushing smile as he went by, while\nshe murmured,--\n\n\"Mamma, do you see that? What does it mean?\"\n\n\"Why, Ned, do you know those people?\" asked Mrs. Ashe at the same\nmoment.\n\n\"Do _you_ know them!\"\n\n\"Yes; we met yesterday. They are connections of my friend Miss Carr.\"\n\n\"Really? There is not the least family likeness between them.\" And Mr.\nWorthington's eyes travelled deliberately from Lilly's delicate, golden\nprettiness to Katy, who, truth to say, did not shine by the contrast.\n\n\"She has a nice, sensible sort of face,\" he thought, \"and she looks like\na lady, but for beauty there is no comparison between the two.\" Then he\nturned to listen to his sister as she replied,--\n\n\"No, indeed, not the least; no two girls could be less like.\" Mrs. Ashe\nhad made the same comparison, but with quite a different result. Katy's\nface was grown dear to her, and she had not taken the smallest fancy to\nLilly Page.\n\nHer relationship to the young naval officer, however, made a wonderful\ndifference in the attitude of Mrs. Page and Lilly toward the party. Katy\nbecame a person to be cultivated rather than repressed, and\nthenceforward there was no lack of cordiality on their part.\n\n\"I want to come in and have a good talk,\" said Lilly, slipping her arm\nthrough Katy's as they left the dining-room. \"Mayn't I come now while\nmamma is calling on Mrs. Ashe?\" This arrangement brought her to the side\nof Lieutenant Worthington, and she walked between him and Katy down the\nhall and into the little drawing-room.\n\n\"Oh, how perfectly charming! You have been fixing up ever since you\ncame, haven't you? It looks like home. I wish we had a _salon_, but\nmamma thought it wasn't worth while, as we were only to be here such a\nlittle time. What a delicious balcony over the water, too! May I go out\non it? Oh, Mr. Worthington, do see this!\"\n\nShe pushed open the half-closed window and stepped out as she spoke. Mr.\nWorthington, after hesitating a moment, followed. Katy paused uncertain.\nThere was hardly room for three in the balcony, yet she did not quite\nlike to leave them. But Lilly had turned her back, and was talking in a\nlow tone; it was nothing more in reality than the lightest chit-chat,\nbut it had the air of being something confidential; so Katy, after\nwaiting a little while, retreated to the sofa, and took up her work,\njoining now and then in the conversation which Mrs. Ashe was keeping up\nwith Cousin Olivia. She did not mind Lilly's ill-breeding, nor was she\nsurprised at it. Mrs. Ashe was less tolerant.\n\n\"Isn't it rather damp out there, Ned?\" she called to her brother; \"you\nhad better throw my shawl round Miss Page's shoulders.\"\n\n\"Oh, it isn't a bit damp,\" said Lilly, recalled to herself by this broad\nhint. \"Thank you so much for thinking of it, Mrs. Ashe, but I am just\ncoming in.\" She seated herself beside Katy, and began to question her\nrather languidly.\n\n\"When did you leave home, and how were they all when you came away?\"\n\n\"All well, thank you. We sailed from Boston on the 14th of October; and\nbefore that I spent two days with Rose Red,--you remember her? She is\nmarried now, and has the dearest little home and such a darling baby.\"\n\n\"Yes, I heard of her marriage. It didn't seem much of a match for Mr.\nRedding's daughter to make, did it? I never supposed she would be\nsatisfied with anything less than a member of Congress or a Secretary of\nLegation.\"\n\n\"Rose isn't particularly ambitious, I think, and she seems perfectly\nhappy,\" replied Katy, flushing.\n\n\"Oh, you needn't fire up in her defence; you and Clover always did adore\nRose Red, I know, but I never could see what there was about her that\nwas so wonderfully fascinating. She never had the least style, and she\nwas always just as rude to me as she could be.\"\n\n\"You were not intimate at school, but I am sure Rose was never rude,\"\nsaid Katy, with spirit.\n\n\"Well, we won't fight about her at this late day. Tell me where you have\nbeen, and where you are going, and how long you are to stay in Europe.\"\n\nKaty, glad to change the subject, complied, and the conversation\ndiverged into comparison of plans and experiences. Lilly had been in\nEurope nearly a year, and had seen \"almost everything,\" as she phrased\nit. She and her mother had spent the previous winter in Italy, had taken\na run into Russia, \"done\" Switzerland and the Tyrol thoroughly, and\nFrance and Germany, and were soon going into Spain, and from there to\nParis, to shop in preparation for their return home in the spring.\n\n\"Of course we shall want quantities of things,\" she said. \"No one will\nbelieve that we have been abroad unless we bring home a lot of clothes.\nThe _lingerie_ and all that is ordered already; but the dresses must be\nmade at the last moment, and we shall have a horrid time of it, I\nsuppose. Worth has promised to make me two walking-suits and two\nball-dresses, but he's very bad about keeping his word. Did you do much\nwhen you were in Paris, Katy?\"\n\n\"We went to the Louvre three times, and to Versailles and St. Cloud,\"\nsaid Katy, wilfully misunderstanding her.\n\n\"Oh, I didn't mean that kind of stupid thing; I meant gowns. What\ndid you buy?\"\n\n\"One tailor-made suit of dark blue cloth.\"\n\n\"My! what moderation!\"\n\nShopping played a large part in Lilly's reminiscences. She recollected\nplaces, not from their situation or beauty or historical associations,\nor because of the works of art which they contained, but as the places\nwhere she bought this or that.\n\n\"Oh, that dear Piazza di Spagna!\" she would say; \"that was where I\nfound my rococo necklace, the loveliest thing you ever saw, Katy.\" Or,\n\"Prague--oh yes, mother got the most enchanting old silver chatelaine\nthere, with all kinds of things hanging to it,--needlecases and watches\nand scent-bottles, all solid, and so beautifully chased.\" Or again,\n\"Berlin was horrid, we thought; but the amber is better and cheaper\nthan anywhere else,--great strings of beads, of the largest size and\nthat beautiful pale yellow, for a hundred francs. You must get yourself\none, Katy.\"\n\nPoor Lilly! Europe to her was all \"things.\" She had collected trunks\nfull of objects to carry home, but of the other collections which do not\ngo into trunks, she had little or none. Her mind was as empty, her heart\nas untouched as ever; the beauty and the glory and the pathos of art and\nhistory and Nature had been poured out in vain before her closed and\nindifferent eyes.\n\nLife soon dropped into a peaceful routine at the Pension Suisse, which\nwas at the same time restful and stimulating. Katy's first act in the\nmorning, as soon as she opened her eyes, was to hurry to the window in\nhopes of getting a glimpse of Corsica. She had discovered that this\nelusive island could almost always be seen from Nice at the dawning, but\nthat as soon as the sun was fairly up, it vanished to appear no more for\nthe rest of the day. There was something fascinating to her imagination\nin the hovering mountain outline between sea and sky. She felt as if she\nwere under an engagement to be there to meet it, and she rarely missed\nthe appointment. Then, after Corsica had pulled the bright mists over\nits face and melted from view, she would hurry with her dressing, and as\nsoon as was practicable set to work to make the _salon_ look bright\nbefore the coffee and rolls should appear, a little after eight o'clock.\nMrs. Ashe always found the fire lit, the little meal cosily set out\nbeside it, and Katy's happy untroubled face to welcome her when she\nemerged from her room; and the cheer of these morning repasts made a\ngood beginning for the day.\n\nThen came walking and a French lesson, and a long sitting on the beach,\nwhile Katy worked at her home letters and Amy raced up and down in the\nsun; and then toward noon Lieutenant Ned generally appeared, and some\nscheme of pleasure was set on foot. Mrs. Ashe ignored his evident\n_penchant_ for Lilly Page, and claimed his time and attentions as hers\nby right. Young Worthington was a good deal \"taken\" with the pretty\nLilly; still, he had an old-time devotion for his sister and the habit\nof doing what she desired, and he yielded to her behests with no audible\nobjections. He made a fourth in the carriage while they drove over the\nlovely hills which encircle Nice toward the north, to Cimiers and the\nVal de St. Andr\u00c3\u00a9, or down the coast toward Ventimiglia. He went with\nthem to Monte-Carlo and Mentone, and was their escort again and again\nwhen they visited the great war-ships as they lay at anchor in a bay\nwhich in its translucent blue was like an enormous sapphire.\n\nMrs. Page and her daughter were included in these parties more than\nonce; but there was something in Mrs. Ashe's cool appropriation of her\nbrother which was infinitely vexatious to Lilly, who before her\narrival had rather looked upon Lieutenant Worthington as her own\nespecial property.\n\n\"I wish _that_ Mrs. Ashe had stayed at home,\" she told her mother. \"She\nquite spoils everything. Mr. Worthington isn't half so nice as he was\nbefore she came. I do believe she has a plan for making him fall in love\nwith Katy; but there she makes a miss of it, for he doesn't seem to care\nanything about her.\"\n\n\"Katy is a nice girl enough,\" pronounced her mother, \"but not of the\nsort to attract a gay young man, I should fancy. I don't believe _she_\nis thinking of any such thing. You needn't be afraid, Lilly.\"\n\n\"I'm not afraid,\" said Lilly, with a pout; \"only it's so provoking.\"\n\nMrs. Page was quite right. Katy was not thinking of any such thing. She\nliked Ned Worthington's frank manners; she owned, quite honestly, that\nshe thought him handsome, and she particularly admired the sort of\ndeferential affection which he showed to Mrs. Ashe, and his nice ways\nwith Amy. For herself, she was aware that he scarcely noticed her except\nas politeness demanded that he should be civil to his sister's friend;\nbut the knowledge did not trouble her particularly. Her head was full of\ninteresting things, plans, ideas. She was not accustomed to being made\nthe object of admiration, and experienced none of the vexations of a\nneglected belle. If Lieutenant Worthington happened to talk to her, she\nresponded frankly and freely; if he did not, she occupied herself with\nsomething else; in either case she was quite unembarrassed both in\nfeeling and manner, and had none of the awkwardness which comes from\ndisappointed vanity and baffled expectations, and the need for\nconcealing them.\n\nToward the close of December the officers of the flag-ship gave a ball,\nwhich was the great event of the season to the gay world of Nice.\nAmericans were naturally in the ascendant on an American frigate; and of\nall the American girls present, Lilly Page was unquestionably the\nprettiest. Exquisitely dressed in white lace, with bands of turquoises\non her neck and arms and in her hair, she had more partners than she\nknew what to do with, more bouquets than she could well carry, and\ncompliments enough to turn any girl's head. Thrown off her guard by her\ntriumphs, she indulged a little vindictive feeling which had been\ngrowing in her mind of late on account of what she chose to consider\ncertain derelictions of duty on the part of Lieutenant Worthington, and\ntreated him to a taste of neglect. She was engaged three deep when he\nasked her to dance; she did not hear when he invited her to walk; she\nturned a cold shoulder when he tried to talk, and seemed absorbed by the\nother cavaliers, naval and otherwise, who crowded about her.\n\nPiqued and surprised, Ned Worthington turned to Katy. She did not dance,\nsaying frankly that she did not know how and was too tall; and she was\nrather simply dressed in a pearl-gray silk, which had been her best gown\nthe winter before in Burnet, with a bunch of red roses in the white lace\nof the tucker, and another in her hand, both the gifts of little Amy;\nbut she looked pleasant and serene, and there was something about her\nwhich somehow soothed his disturbed mind, as he offered her his arm for\na walk on the decks.\n\nFor a while they said little, and Katy was quite content to pace up and\ndown in silence, enjoying the really beautiful scene,--the moonlight on\nthe Bay, the deep wavering reflections of the dark hulls and slender\nspars, the fairy effect of the colored lamps and lanterns, and the\nbrilliant moving maze of the dancers.\n\n\"Do you care for this sort of thing?\" he suddenly asked.\n\n\"What sort of thing do you mean?\"\n\n\"Oh, all this jigging and waltzing and amusement.\"\n\n\"I don't know how to 'jig,' but it's delightful to look on,\" she\nanswered merrily. \"I never saw anything so pretty in my life.\"\n\nThe happy tone of her voice and the unruffled face which she turned upon\nhim quieted his irritation.\n\n\"I really believe you mean it,\" he said; \"and yet, if you won't think me\nrude to say so, most girls would consider the thing dull enough if they\nwere only getting out of it what you are,--if they were not dancing, I\nmean, and nobody in particular was trying to entertain them.\"\n\n\"But everything _is_ being done to entertain me,\" cried Katy. \"I can't\nimagine what makes you think that it could seem dull. I am in it all,\ndon't you see,--I have my share--. Oh, I am stupid, I can't make you\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"Yes, you do. I understand perfectly, I think; only it is such a\ndifferent point of view from what girls in general would take.\" (By\ngirls he meant Lilly!) \"Please do not think me uncivil.\"\n\n\"You are not uncivil at all; but don't let us talk any more about me.\nLook at the lights between the shadows of the masts on the water. How\nthey quiver! I never saw anything so beautiful, I think. And how warm it\nis! I can't believe that we are in December and that it is nearly\nChristmas.\"\n\n\"How is Polly going to celebrate her Christmas? Have you decided?\"\n\n\"Amy is to have a Christmas-tree for her dolls, and two other dolls are\ncoming. We went out this morning to buy things for it,--tiny little toys\nand candles fit for Lilliput. And that reminds me, do you suppose one\ncan get any Christmas greens here?\"\n\n\"Why not? The place seems full of green.\"\n\n\"That's just it; the summer look makes it unnatural. But I should like\nsome to dress the parlor with if they could be had.\"\n\n\"I'll see what I can find, and send you a load.\"\n\nI don't know why this very simple little talk should have made an\nimpression on Lieutenant Worthington's mind, but somehow he did not\nforget it.\n\n\"'Don't let us talk any more about me,'\" he said to himself that night\nwhen alone in his cabin. \"I wonder how long it would be before the other\none did anything to divert the talk from herself. Some time, I fancy.\"\nHe smiled rather grimly as he unbuckled his sword-belt. It is unlucky\nfor a girl when she starts a train of reflection like this. Lilly's\nlittle attempt to pique her admirer had somehow missed its mark.\n\nThe next afternoon Katy in her favorite place on the beach was at work\non the long weekly letter which she never failed to send home to Burnet.\nShe held her portfolio in her lap, and her pen ran rapidly over the\npaper, as rapidly almost as her tongue would have run could her\ncorrespondents have been brought nearer.\n\n\n    \"Nice, December 22.\n\n    \"Dear Papa and everybody,--Amy and I are sitting on my old purple\n    cloak, which is spread over the sand just where it was spread the\n    last time I wrote you. We are playing the following game: I am a\n    fairy and she is a little girl. Another fairy--not sitting on the\n    cloak at present--has enchanted the little girl, and I am telling\n    her various ways by which she can work out her deliverance. At\n    present the task is to find twenty-four dull red pebbles of the same\n    color, failing to do which she is to be changed into an owl. When we\n    began to play, I was the wicked fairy; but Amy objected to that\n    because I am 'so nice,' so we changed the characters. I wish you\n    could see the glee in her pretty gray eyes over this infantile game,\n    into which she has thrown herself so thoroughly that she half\n    believes in it. 'But I needn't really be changed into an owl! 'she\n    says, with a good deal of anxiety in her voice.\n\n    \"To think that you are shivering in the first snow-storm, or sending\n    the children out with their sleds and india-rubbers to slide! How I\n    wish instead that you were sharing the purple cloak with Amy and me,\n    and could sit all this warm balmy afternoon close to the surf-line\n    which fringes this bluest of blue seas! There is plenty of room for\n    you all. Not many people come down to this end of the beach, and if\n    you were very good we would let you play.\n\n    \"Our life here goes on as delightfully as ever. Nice is very full of\n    people, and there seem to be some pleasant ones among them. Here at\n    the Pension Suisse we do not see a great many Americans. The\n    fellow-boarders are principally Germans and Austrians with a\n    sprinkling of French. (Amy has found her twenty-four red pebbles, so\n    she is let off from being an owl. She is now engaged in throwing\n    them one by one into the sea. Each must hit the water under penalty\n    of her being turned into a Muscovy duck. She doesn't know exactly\n    what a Muscovy duck is, which makes her all the more particular\n    about her shots.) But, as I was saying, our little _suite_ in the\n    round tower is so on one side of the rest of the Pension that it is\n    as good as having a house of our own. The _salon_ is very bright and\n    sunny; we have two sofas and a square table and a round table and a\n    sort of what-not and two easy-chairs and two uneasy chairs and a\n    lamp of our own and a clock. There is also a sofa-pillow. There's\n    richness for you! We have pinned up all our photographs on the\n    walls, including Papa's and Clovy's and that bad one of Phil and\n    Johnnie making faces at each other, and three lovely red and yellow\n    Japanese pictures on muslin which Rose Red put in my trunk the last\n    thing, for a spot of color. There are some autumn leaves too; and we\n    always have flowers and in the mornings and evenings a fire.\n\n    \"Amy is now finding fifty snow-white pebbles, which when found are\n    to be interred in one common grave among the shingle. If she fails\n    to do this, she is to be changed to an electrical eel. The chief\n    difficulty is that she loses her heart to particular pebbles. 'I\n    can't bury you,' I hear her saying.\n\n    \"To return,--we have jolly little breakfasts together in the\n    _salon_. They consist of coffee and rolls, and are served by a\n    droll, snappish little _gar\u00c3\u00a7on_ with no teeth, and an Italian-French\n    patois which is very hard to understand when he sputters. He told me\n    the other day that he had been a _gar\u00c3\u00a7on_ for forty-six years, which\n    seemed rather a long boyhood.\n\n    \"The company, as we meet them at table, are rather entertaining.\n    Cousin Olivia and Lilly are on their best behavior to me because I\n    am travelling with Mrs. Ashe, and Mrs. Ashe is Lieutenant\n    Worthington's sister, and Lieutenant Worthington is Lilly's admirer,\n    and they like him very much. In fact, Lilly has intimated\n    confidentially that she is all but engaged to him; but I am not sure\n    about it, or if that was what she meant; and I fear, if it proves\n    true, that dear Polly will not like it at all. She is quite\n    unmanageable, and snubs Lilly continually in a polite way, which\n    makes me fidgety for fear Lilly will be offended, but she never\n    seems to notice it. Cousin Olivia looks very handsome and gorgeous.\n    She quite takes the color out of the little Russian Countess who\n    sits next to her, and who is as dowdy and meek as if she came from\n    Akron or Binghampton, or any other place where countesses are\n    unknown. Then there are two charming, well-bred young Austrians. The\n    one who sits nearest to me is a 'Candidat' for a Doctorate of Laws,\n    and speaks eight languages well. He has only studied English for the\n    past six weeks, but has made wonderful progress. I wish my French\n    were half as good as his English is already.\n\n    \"There is a very gossiping young woman on the story beneath ours,\n    whom I meet sometimes in the garden, and from her I hear all manner\n    of romantic tales about people in the house. One little French girl\n    is dying of consumption and a broken heart, because of a quarrel\n    with her lover, who is a courier; and the _padrona_, who is young\n    and pretty, and has only been married a few months to our elderly\n    landlord, has a story also. I forget some of the details; but there\n    was a stern parent and an admirer, and a cup of cold poison, and now\n    she says she wishes she were dying of consumption like poor\n    Alphonsine. For all that, she looks quite fat and rosy, and I often\n    see her in her best gown with a great deal of Roman scarf and mosaic\n    jewelry, stationed in the doorway, 'making the Pension look\n    attractive to the passers-by.' So she has a sense of duty, though\n    she is unhappy.\n\n    \"Amy has buried all her pebbles, and says she is tired of playing\n    fairy. She is now sitting with her head on my shoulder, and\n    professedly studying her French verb for to-morrow, but in reality,\n    I am sorry to say, she is conversing with me about be-headings,--a\n    subject which, since her visit to the Tower, has exercised a\n    horrible fascination over her mind. 'Do people die right away?' she\n    asks. 'Don't they feel one minute, and doesn't it feel awfully?'\n    There is a good deal of blood, she supposes, because there was so\n    much straw laid about the block in the picture of Lady Jane Gray's\n    execution, which enlivened our walls in Paris. On the whole, I am\n    rather glad that a fat little white dog has come waddling down the\n    beach and taken off her attention.\n\n    \"Speaking of Paris seems to renew the sense of fog which we had\n    there. Oh, how enchanting sunshine is after weeks of gloom! I shall\n    never forget how the Mediterranean looked when we saw it first,--all\n    blue, and such a lovely color. There ought, according to Morse's\n    Atlas, to have been a big red letter T on the water about where we\n    were, but I didn't see any. Perhaps they letter it so far out from\n    shore that only people in boats notice it.\n\n    \"Now the dusk is fading, and the odd chill which hides under these\n    warm afternoons begins to be felt. Amy has received a message\n    written on a mysterious white pebble to the effect--\"\n\nKaty was interrupted at this point by a crunching step on the gravel\nbehind her.\n\n\"Good afternoon,\" said a voice. \"Polly has sent me to fetch you and Amy\nin. She says it is growing cool.\"\n\n\"We were just coming,\" said Katy, beginning to put away her papers.\n\nNed Worthington sat down on the cloak beside her. The distance was now\nsteel gray against the sky; then came a stripe of violet, and then a\nbroad sheet of the vivid iridescent blue which one sees on the necks of\npeacocks, which again melted into the long line of flashing surf.\n\n\"See that gull,\" he said, \"how it drops plumb into the sea, as if bound\nto go through to China!\"\n\n\"Mrs. Hawthorne calls skylarks 'little raptures,'\" replied Katy.\n\"Sea-gulls seem to me like grown-up raptures.\"\n\n\"Are you going?\" said Lieutenant Worthington in a tone of surprise,\nas she rose.\n\n\"Didn't you say that Polly wanted us to come in?\"\n\n\"Why, yes; but it seems too good to leave, doesn't it? Oh, by the way,\nMiss Carr, I came across a man to-day and ordered your greens. They will\nbe sent on Christmas Eve. Is that right?\"\n\n\"Quite right, and we are ever so much obliged to you.\" She turned for a\nlast look at the sea, and, unseen by Ned Worthington, formed her lips\ninto a \"good-night.\" Katy had made great friends with the Mediterranean.\n\nThe promised \"greens\" appeared on the afternoon before Christmas Day, in\nthe shape of an enormous fagot of laurel and laurestinus and holly and\nbox; orange and lemon boughs with ripe fruit hanging from them, thick\nivy tendrils whole yards long, arbutus, pepper tree, and great branches\nof acacia, covered with feathery yellow bloom. The man apologized for\nbringing so little. The gentleman had ordered two francs worth, he said,\nbut this was all he could carry; he would fetch some more if the young\nlady wished! But Katy, exclaiming with delight over her wealth, wished\nno more; so the man departed, and the three friends proceeded to turn\nthe little _salon_ into a fairy bower. Every photograph and picture was\nwreathed in ivy, long garlands hung on either side the windows, and the\nchimney-piece and door-frames became clustering banks of leaf and\nblossom. A great box of flowers had come with the greens, and bowls of\nfresh roses and heliotrope and carnations were set everywhere; violets\nand primroses, gold-hearted brown auriculas, spikes of veronica, all the\nzones and all the seasons, combining to make the Christmas-tide sweet,\nand to turn winter topsy-turvy in the little parlor.\n\nMabel and Mary Matilda, with their two doll visitors, sat gravely round\nthe table, in the laps of their little mistresses; and Katy, putting on\nan apron and an improvised cap, and speaking Irish very fast, served\nthem with a repast of rolls and cocoa, raspberry jam, and delicious\nlittle almond cakes. The fun waxed fast and furious; and Lieutenant\nWorthington, coming in with his hands full of parcels for the\nChristmas-tree, was just in time to hear Katy remark in a strong County\nKerry brogue,--\n\n\"Och, thin indade, Miss Amy, and it's no more cake you'll be getting out\nof me the night. That's four pieces you've ate, and it's little slape\nyour poor mother'll git with you a tossin' and tumblin' forenenst her\nall night long because of your big appetite.\"\n\n\"Oh, Miss Katy, talk Irish some more!\" cried the delighted children.\n\n\"Is it Irish you'd be afther having me talk, when it's me own langwidge,\nand sorrow a bit of another do I know?\" demanded Katy. Then she caught\nsight of the new arrival and stopped short with a blush and a laugh.\n\n\"Come in, Mr. Worthington,\" she said; \"we're at supper, as you see, and\nI am acting as waitress.\"\n\n\"Oh, Uncle Ned, please go away,\" pleaded Amy, \"or Katy will be polite,\nand not talk Irish any more.\"\n\n\"Indade, and the less ye say about politeness the betther, when ye're\nafther ordering the jantleman out of the room in that fashion!\" said the\nwaitress. Then she pulled off her cap and untied her apron.\n\n\"Now for the Christmas-tree,\" she said.\n\nIt was a very little tree, but it bore some remarkable fruits; for in\naddition to the \"tiny toys and candles fit for Lilliput,\" various\nparcels were found to have been hastily added at the last moment for\nvarious people. The \"Natchitoches\" had lately come from the Levant, and\ndelightful Oriental confections now appeared for Amy and Mrs. Ashe;\nTurkish slippers, all gold embroidery; towels, with richly decorated\nends in silks and tinsel;--all the pretty superfluities which the East\nholds out to charm gold from the pockets of her Western visitors. A\npretty little dagger in agate and silver fell to Katy's share out of\nwhat Lieutenant Worthington called his \"loot;\" and beside, a most\nbeautiful specimen of the inlaid work for which Nice is famous,--a\nlooking-glass, with a stand and little doors to close it in,--which was\na present from Mrs. Ashe. It was quite unlike a Christmas Eve at home,\nbut altogether delightful; and as Katy sat next morning on the sand,\nafter the service in the English church, to finish her home letter, and\nfelt the sun warm on her cheek, and the perfumed air blow past as softly\nas in June, she had to remind herself that Christmas is not necessarily\nsynonymous with snow and winter, but means the great central heat and\nwarmth, the advent of Him who came to lighten the whole earth.\n\nA few days after this pleasant Christmas they left Nice. All of them\nfelt a reluctance to move, and Amy loudly bewailed the necessity.\n\n\"If I could stay here till it is time to go home, I shouldn't be\nhomesick at all,\" she declared.\n\n\"But what a pity it would be not to see Italy!\" said her mother. \"Think\nof Naples and Rome and Venice.\"\n\n\"I don't want to think about them. It makes me feel as if I was studying\na great long geography lesson, and it tires me so to learn it.\"\n\n\"Amy, dear, you're not well.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am,--quite well; only I don't want to go away from Nice.\"\n\n\"You only have to learn a little bit at a time of your geography lesson,\nyou know,\" suggested Katy; \"and it's a great deal nicer way to study it\nthan out of a book.\" But though she spoke cheerfully she was conscious\nthat she shared Amy's reluctance.\n\n\"It's all laziness,\" she told herself. \"Nice has been so pleasant that\nit has spoiled me.\"\n\nIt was a consolation and made going easier that they were to drive over\nthe famous Cornice Road as far as San Remo, instead of going to Genoa\nby rail as most travellers now-a-days do. They departed from the\nPension Suisse early on an exquisite morning, fair and balmy as June,\nbut with a little zest and sparkle of coolness in the air which made it\nadditionally delightful. The Mediterranean was of the deepest\nviolet-blue; a sort of bloom of color seemed to lie upon it. The sky\nwas like an arch of turquoise; every cape and headland shone jewel-like\nin the golden sunshine. The carriage, as it followed the windings of\nthe road cut shelf-like on the cliffs, seemed poised between earth and\nheaven; the sea below, the mountain summits above, with a fairy world\nof verdure between. The journey was like a dream of enchantment and\nrapidly changing surprises; and when it ended in a quaint hostelry at\nSan Remo, with palm-trees feathering the Bordighera Point and Corsica,\nfor once seen by day, lying in bold, clear outlines against the sunset,\nKaty had to admit to herself that Nice, much as she loved it, was not\nthe only, not even the most beautiful place in Europe. Already she felt\nher horizon growing, her convictions changing; and who should say what\nlay beyond?\n\nThe next day brought them to Genoa, to a hotel once the stately palace\nof an archbishop, where they were lodged, all three together, in an\nenormous room, so high and broad and long that their three little\ncurtained beds set behind a screen of carved wood made no impression on\nthe space. There were not less than four sofas and double that number of\narm-chairs in the room, besides a couple of monumental wardrobes; but,\nas Katy remarked, several grand pianos could still have been moved in\nwithout anybody's feeling crowded. On one side of them lay the port of\nGenoa, filled with craft from all parts of the world, and flying the\nflags of a dozen different nations. From the other they caught glimpses\nof the magnificent old city, rising in tier over tier of churches and\npalaces and gardens; while nearer still were narrow streets, which\nglittered with gold filigree and the shops of jewel-workers. And while\nthey went in and out and gazed and wondered, Lilly Page, at the Pension\nSuisse, was saying,--\n\n\"I am so glad that Katy and _that_ Mrs. Ashe are gone. Nothing has been\nso pleasant since they came. Lieutenant Worthington is dreadfully stiff\nand stupid, and seems quite different from what he used to be. But now\nthat we have got rid of them it will all come right again.\"\n\n\"I really don't think that Katy was to blame,\" said Mrs. Page. \"She\nnever seemed to me to be making any effort to attract him.\"\n\n\"Oh, Katy is sly,\" responded Lilly, vindictively. \"She never _seems_ to\ndo anything, but somehow she always gets her own way. I suppose she\nthought I didn't see her keeping him down there on the beach the other\nday when he was coming in to call on us, but I did. It was just out of\nspite, and because she wanted to vex me; I know it was.\"\n\n\"Well, dear, she's gone now, and you won't be worried with her again,\"\nsaid her mother, soothingly. \"Don't pout so, Lilly, and wrinkle up your\nforehead. It's very unbecoming.\"\n\n\"Yes, she's gone,\" snapped Lilly; \"and as she's bound for the East, and\nwe for the West, we are not likely to meet again, for which I am\ndevoutly thankful.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nON THE TRACK OF ULYSSES.\n\n\n\"We are going to follow the track of Ulysses,\" said Katy, with her eyes\nfixed on the little travelling-map in her guide-book. \"Do you realize\nthat, Polly dear? He and his companions sailed these very seas before\nus, and we shall see the sights they saw,--Circe's Cape and the Isles of\nthe Sirens, and Polyphemus himself, perhaps, who knows?\"\n\nThe \"Marco Polo\" had just cast off her moorings, and was slowly steaming\nout of the crowded port of Genoa into the heart of a still rosy sunset.\nThe water was perfectly smooth; no motion could be felt but the engine's\nthrob. The trembling foam of the long wake showed glancing points of\nphosphorescence here and there, while low on the eastern sky a great\nsilver planet burned like a signal lamp.\n\n\"Polyphemus was a horrible giant. I read about him once, and I don't\nwant to see him,\" observed Amy, from her safe protected perch in her\nmother's lap.\n\n\"He may not be so bad now as he was in those old times. Some missionary\nmay have come across him and converted him. If he were good, you\nwouldn't mind his being big, would you?\" suggested Katy.\n\n\"N-o,\" replied Amy, doubtfully; \"but it would take a great lot of\nmissionaries to make _him_ good, I should think. One all alone would be\nafraid to speak to him. We shan't really see him, shall we?\"\n\n\"I don't believe we shall; and if we stuff cotton in our ears and look\nthe other way, we need not hear the sirens sing,\" said Katy, who was in\nthe highest spirits.--\"And oh, Polly dear, there is one delightful thing\nI forgot to tell you about. The captain says he shall stay in Leghorn\nall day to-morrow taking on freight, and we shall have plenty of time to\nrun up to Pisa and see the Cathedral and the Leaning Tower and\neverything else. Now, that is something Ulysses didn't do! I am so glad\nI didn't die of measles when I was little, as Rose Red used to say.\" She\ngave her book a toss into the air as she spoke, and caught it again as\nit fell, very much as the Katy Carr of twelve years ago might have done.\n\n\"What a child you are!\" said Mrs. Ashe, approvingly; \"you never seem out\nof sorts or tired of things.\"\n\n\"Out of sorts? I should think not! And pray why should I be,\nPolly dear?\"\n\nKaty had taken to calling her friend \"Polly dear\" of late,--a trick\npicked up half unconsciously from Lieutenant Ned. Mrs. Ashe liked it;\nit was sisterly and intimate, she said, and made her feel nearer\nKaty's age.\n\n\"Does the tower really lean?\" questioned Amy,--\"far over, I mean, so\nthat we can see it?\"\n\n\"We shall know to-morrow,\" replied Katy. \"If it doesn't, I shall lose\nall my confidence in human nature.\"\n\nKaty's confidence in human nature was not doomed to be impaired. There\nstood the famous tower, when they reached the Place del Duomo in Pisa,\nnext morning, looking all aslant, exactly as it does in the pictures and\nthe alabaster models, and seeming as if in another moment it must topple\nover, from its own weight, upon their heads. Mrs. Ashe declared that it\nwas so unnatural that it made her flesh creep; and when she was coaxed\nup the winding staircase to the top, she turned so giddy that they were\nall thankful to get her safely down to firm ground again. She turned her\nback upon the tower, as they crossed the grassy space to the majestic\nold Cathedral, saying that if she thought about it any more, she should\nbecome a disbeliever in the attraction of gravitation, which she had\nalways been told all respectable people _must_ believe in.\n\nThe guide showed them the lamp swinging by a long slender chain, before\nwhich Galileo is said to have sat and pondered while he worked out his\ntheory of the pendulum. This lamp seemed a sort of own cousin to the\nattraction of gravitation, and they gazed upon it with respect. Then\nthey went to the Baptistery to see Niccolo Pisano's magnificent pulpit\nof creamy marble, a mass of sculpture supported on the backs of lions,\nand the equally lovely font, and to admire the extraordinary sound\nwhich their guide evoked from a mysterious echo, with which he seemed\nto be on intimate terms, for he made it say whatever he would and\nalmost \"answer back.\"\n\nIt was in coming out of the Baptistery that they met with an adventure\nwhich Amy could never quite forget. Pisa is the mendicant city of Italy,\nand her streets are infested with a band of religious beggars who call\nthemselves the Brethren of the Order of Mercy. They wear loose black\ngowns, sandals laced over their bare feet, and black cambric masks with\nholes, through which their eyes glare awfully; and they carry tin cups\nfor the reception of offerings, which they thrust into the faces of all\nstrangers visiting the city, whom they look upon as their lawful prey.\n\nAs our party emerged from the Baptistery, two of these Brethren espied\nthem, and like great human bats came swooping down upon them with long\nstrides, their black garments flying in the wind, their eyes rolling\nstrangely behind their masks, and brandishing their alms-cups, which had\n\"Pour les Pauvres\" lettered upon them, and gave forth a clapping sound\nlike a watchman's rattle. There was something terrible in their\nappearance and the rushing speed of their movements. Amy screamed and\nran behind her mother, who visibly shrank. Katy stood her ground; but\nthe bat-winged fiends in Dor\u00c3\u00a9's illustrations to Dante occurred to her,\nand her fingers trembled as she dropped some money in the cups.\n\nEven mendicant friars are human. Katy ceased to tremble as she observed\nthat one of them, as he retreated, walked backward for some distance in\norder to gaze longer at Mrs. Ashe, whose cheeks were flushed with bright\npink and who was looking particularly handsome. She began to laugh\ninstead, and Mrs. Ashe laughed too; but Amy could not get over the\nimpression of having been attacked by demons, and often afterward\nrecurred with a shudder to the time when those awful black _things_ flew\nat her and she hid behind mamma. The ghastly pictures of the Triumph of\nDeath, which were presently exhibited to them on the walls of the Campo\nSanto, did not tend to reassure her, and it was with quite a pale,\nscared little face that she walked toward the hotel where they were to\nlunch, and she held fast to Katy's hand.\n\nTheir way led them through a narrow street inhabited by the poorer\nclasses,--a dusty street with high shabby buildings on either side and\nwide doorways giving glimpses of interior courtyards, where empty\nhogsheads and barrels and rusty caldrons lay, and great wooden trays of\nmacaroni were spread out in the sun to dry. Some of the macaroni was\ngray, some white, some yellow; none of it looked at all desirable to\neat, as it lay exposed to the dust, with long lines of ill-washed\nclothes flapping above on wires stretched from one house to another. As\nis usual in poor streets, there were swarms of children; and the\nappearance of little Amy with her long bright hair falling over her\nshoulders and Mabel clasped in her arms created a great sensation. The\nchildren in the street shouted and exclaimed, and other children within\nthe houses heard the sounds and came trooping out, while mothers and\nolder sisters peeped from the doorways. The very air seemed full of\neager faces and little brown and curly heads bobbing up and down with\nexcitement, and black eyes all fixed upon big beautiful Mabel, who with\nher thick wig of flaxen hair, her blue velvet dress and jacket,\nfeathered hat, and little muff, seemed to them like some strange small\nmarvel from another world. They could not decide whether she was a\nliving child or a make-believe one, and they dared not come near enough\nto find out; so they clustered at a little distance, pointed with their\nfingers, and whispered and giggled, while Amy, much pleased with the\nadmiration shown for her darling, lifted Mabel up to view.\n\nAt last one droll little girl with a white cap on her round head seemed\nto make up _her_ mind, and darting indoors returned with her doll,--a\npoor little image of wood, its only garment a coarse shirt of red\ncotton. This she held out for Amy to see. Amy smiled for the first time\nsince her encounter with the bat-like friars; and Katy, taking Mabel\nfrom her, made signs that the two dolls should kiss each other. But\nthough the little Italian screamed with laughter at the idea of a\n_bacio_ between two dolls, she would by no means allow it, and hid her\ntreasure behind her back, blushing and giggling, and saying something\nvery fast which none of them understood, while she waved two fingers at\nthem with a curious gesture.\n\n\"I do believe she is afraid Mabel will cast the evil eye on her doll,\"\nsaid Katy at last, with a sudden understanding as to what this\npantomime meant.\n\n\"Why, you silly thing!\" cried the outraged Amy; \"do you suppose for one\nmoment that my child could hurt your dirty old dolly? You ought to be\nglad to have her noticed at all by anybody that's clean.\"\n\nThe sound of the foreign tongue completed the discomfiture of the\nlittle Italian. With a shriek she fled, and all the other children\nafter her; pausing at a distance to look back at the alarming creatures\nwho didn't speak the familiar language. Katy, wishing to leave a\npleasant impression, made Mabel kiss her waxen fingers toward them.\nThis sent the children off into another fit of laughter and chatter,\nand they followed our friends for quite a distance as they proceeded on\ntheir way to the hotel.\n\nAll that night, over a sea as smooth as glass, the \"Marco Polo\" slipped\nalong the coasts past which the ships of Ulysses sailed in those old\nlegendary days which wear so charmed a light to our modern eyes. Katy\nroused at three in the morning, and looking from her cabin window had a\nglimpse of an island, which her map showed her must be Elba, where that\nwar-eagle Napoleon was chained for a while. Then she fell asleep again,\nand when she roused in full daylight the steamer was off the coast of\nOstia and nearing the mouth of the Tiber. Dreamy mountain-shapes rose\nbeyond the far-away Campagna, and every curve and indentation of the\ncoast bore a name which recalled some interesting thing.\n\nAbout eleven a dim-drawn bubble appeared on the horizon, which the\ncaptain assured them was the dome of St. Peter's, nearly thirty miles\ndistant. This was one of the \"moments\" which Clover had been fond of\nspeculating about; and Katy, contrasting the real with the imaginary\nmoment, could not help smiling. Neither she nor Clover had ever supposed\nthat her first glimpse of the great dome was to be so little impressive.\n\nOn and on they went till the air-hung bubble disappeared; and Amy, grown\nvery tired of scenery with which she had no associations, and grown-up\nraptures which she did not comprehend, squeezed herself into the end of\nthe long wooden settee on which Katy sat, and began to beg for another\nstory concerning Violet and Emma.\n\n\"Just a little tiny chapter, you know, Miss Katy, about what they did on\nNew Year's Day or something. It's so dull to keep sailing and sailing\nall day and have nothing to do, and it's ever so long since you told me\nanything about them, really and truly it is!\"\n\nNow, Violet and Emma, if the truth is to be told, had grown to be the\nbane of Katy's existence. She had rung the changes on their uneventful\nadventures, and racked her brains to invent more and more details, till\nher imagination felt like a dry sponge from which every possible drop of\nmoisture had been squeezed. Amy was insatiable. Her interest in the tale\nnever flagged; and when her exhausted friend explained that she really\ncould not think of another word to say on the subject, she would turn\nthe tables by asking, \"Then, Miss Katy, mayn't I tell _you_ a chapter?\"\nwhereupon she would proceed somewhat in this fashion:--\n\n\"It was the day before Christmas--no, we won't have it the day before\nChristmas; it shall be three days before Thanksgiving. Violet and Emma\ngot up in the morning, and--well, they didn't do anything in particular\nthat day. They just had their breakfasts and dinners, and played and\nstudied a little, and went to bed early, you know, and the next morning\n--well, there didn't much happen that day, either; they just had their\nbreakfasts and dinners, and played.\"\n\nListening to Amy's stories was so much worse than telling them to her,\nthat Katy in self-defence was driven to recommence her narrations, but\nshe had grown to hate Violet and Emma with a deadly hatred. So when Amy\nmade this appeal on the steamer's deck, a sudden resolution took\npossession of her, and she decided to put an end to these dreadful\nchildren once for all.\n\n\"Yes, Amy,\" she said, \"I will tell you one more story about Violet and\nEmma; but this is positively the last.\"\n\nSo Amy cuddled close to her friend, and listened with rapt attention as\nKaty told how on a certain day just before the New Year, Violet and Emma\nstarted by themselves in a little sleigh drawn by a pony, to carry to a\npoor woman who lived in a lonely house high up on a mountain slope a\nbasket containing a turkey, a mould of cranberry jelly, a bunch of\ncelery, and a mince-pie.\n\n\"They were so pleased at having all these nice things to take to poor\nwidow Simpson and in thinking how glad she would be to see them,\"\nproceeded the naughty Katy, \"that they never noticed how black the sky\nwas getting to be, or how the wind howled through the bare boughs of the\ntrees. They had to go slowly, for the road was up hill all the way, and\nit was hard work for the poor pony. But he was a stout little fellow,\nand tugged away up the slippery track, and Violet and Emma talked and\nlaughed, and never thought what was going to happen. Just half-way up\nthe mountain there was a rocky cliff which overhung the road, and on\nthis cliff grew an enormous hemlock tree. The branches were loaded with\nsnow, which made them much heavier than usual. Just as the sleigh passed\nslowly underneath the cliff, a violent blast of wind blew up from the\nravine, struck the hemlock and tore it out of the ground, roots and all.\nIt fell directly across the sleigh, and Violet and Emma and the pony and\nthe basket with the turkey and the other things in it were all crushed\nas flat as pancakes!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Amy, as Katy stopped, \"go on! what happened then?\"\n\n\"Nothing happened then,\" replied Katy, in a tone of awful solemnity;\n\"nothing could happen! Violet and Emma were dead, the pony was dead, the\nthings in the basket were broken all to little bits, and a great\nsnowstorm began and covered them up, and no one knew where they were or\nwhat had become of them till the snow melted in the spring.\"\n\nWith a loud shriek Amy jumped up from the bench.\n\n\"No! no! no!\" she cried; \"they aren't dead! I won't let them be dead!\"\nThen she burst into tears, ran down the stairs, locked herself into her\nmother's stateroom, and did not appear again for several hours.\n\nKaty laughed heartily at first over this outburst, but presently she\nbegan to repent and to think that she had treated her pet unkindly. She\nwent down and knocked at the stateroom door; but Amy would not answer.\nShe called her softly through the key-hole, and coaxed and pleaded, but\nit was all in vain. Amy remained invisible till late in the afternoon;\nand when she finally crept up again to the deck, her eyes were red with\ncrying, and her little face as pale and miserable as if she had been\nattending the funeral of her dearest friend.\n\nKaty's heart smote her.\n\n\"Come here, my darling,\" she said, holding out her hand; \"come and sit\nin my lap and forgive me. Violet and Emma shall not be dead. They shall\ngo on living, since you care so much for them, and I will tell stories\nabout them to the end of the chapter.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Amy, shaking her head mournfully; \"you can't. They're dead,\nand they won't come to life again ever. It's all over, and I'm so\nso-o-rry.\"\n\nAll Katy's apologies and efforts to resuscitate the story were useless.\nViolet and Emma were dead to Amy's imagination, and she could not make\nherself believe in them any more.\n\nShe was too woe-begone to care for the fables of Circe and her swine\nwhich Katy told as they rounded the magnificent Cape Circello, and the\nisles where the sirens used to sing appealed to her in vain. The sun\nset, the stars came out; and under the beams of their countless lamps\nand the beckonings of a slender new moon, the \"Marco Polo\" sailed into\nthe Bay of Naples, past Vesuvius, whose dusky curl of smoke could be\nseen outlined against the luminous sky, and brought her passengers to\ntheir landing-place.\n\nThey woke next morning to a summer atmosphere full of yellow sunshine\nand true July warmth. Flower-vendors stood on every corner, and pursued\neach newcomer with their fragrant wares. Katy could not stop exclaiming\nover the cheapness of the flowers, which were thrust in at the carriage\nwindows as they drove slowly up and down the streets. They were tied\ninto flat nosegays, whose centre was a white camellia, encircled with\nconcentric rows of pink tea rosebuds, ring after ring, till the whole\nwas the size of an ordinary milk-pan; all to be had for the sum of ten\ncents! But after they had bought two or three of these enormous\nbouquets, and had discovered that not a single rose boasted an inch of\nstem, and that all were pierced with long wires through their very\nhearts, she ceased to care for them.\n\n\"I would rather have one Souvenir or General Jacqueminot, with a long\nstem and plenty of leaves, than a dozen of these stiff platters of\nbouquets,\" Katy told Mrs. Ashe. But when they drove beyond the city\ngates, and the coachman came to anchor beneath walls overhung with the\nsame roses, and she found that she might stand on the seat and pull down\nas many branches of the lovely flowers as she desired, and gather\nwallflowers for herself out of the clefts in the masonry, she was\nentirely satisfied.\n\n\"This is the Italy of my dreams,\" she said.\n\nWith all its beauty there was an underlying sense of danger about\nNaples, which interfered with their enjoyment of it. Evil smells came\nin at the windows, or confronted them as they went about the city.\nThere seemed something deadly in the air. Whispered reports met their\nears of cases of fever, which the landlords of the hotels were doing\ntheir best to hush up. An American gentleman was said to be lying very\nill at one house. A lady had died the week before at another. Mrs. Ashe\ngrew nervous.\n\n\"We will just take a rapid look at a few of the principal things,\" she\ntold Katy, \"and then get away as fast as we can. Amy is so on my mind\nthat I have no peace of my life. I keep feeling her pulse and imagining\nthat she does not look right; and though I know it is all my fancy, I am\nimpatient to be off. You won't mind, will you, Katy?\"\n\nAfter that everything they did was done in a hurry. Katy felt as if she\nwere being driven about by a cyclone, as they rushed from one sight to\nanother, filling up all the chinks between with shopping, which was\nirresistible where everything was so pretty and so wonderfully cheap.\nShe herself purchased a tortoise-shell fan and chain for Rose Red, and\nhad her monogram carved upon it; a coral locket for Elsie; some studs\nfor Dorry; and for her father a small, beautiful vase of bronze, copied\nfrom one of the Pompeian antiques.\n\n\"How charming it is to have money to spend in such a place as this!\" she\nsaid to herself with a sigh of satisfaction as she surveyed these\ndelightful buyings. \"I only wish I could get ten times as many things\nand take them to ten times as many people. Papa was so wise about it. I\ncan't think how it is that he always knows beforehand exactly how people\nare going to feel, and what they will want!\"\n\nMrs. Ashe also bought a great many things for herself and Amy, and to\ntake home as presents; and it was all very pleasant and satisfactory\nexcept for that subtle sense of danger from which they could not escape\nand which made them glad to go. \"See Naples and die,\" says the old\nadage; and the saying has proved sadly true in the case of many an\nAmerican traveller.\n\nBeside the talk of fever there was also a good deal of gossip about\nbrigands going about, as is generally the case in Naples and its\nvicinity. Something was said to have happened to a party on one of the\nheights above Sorrento; and though nobody knew exactly what the\nsomething was, or was willing to vouch for the story, Mrs. Ashe and\nKaty felt a good deal of trepidation as they entered the carriage which\nwas to take them to the neighborhood where the mysterious \"something\"\nhad occurred.\n\nThe drive between Castellamare and Sorrento is in reality as safe as\nthat between Boston and Brookline; but as our party did not know this\nfact till afterward, it did them no good. It is also one of the most\nbeautiful drives in the world, following the windings of the exquisite\ncoast mile after mile, in long links of perfectly made road, carved on\nthe face of sharp cliffs, with groves of oranges and lemons and olive\norchards above, and the Bay of Naples beneath, stretching away like a\nsolid sheet of lapis-lazuli, and gemmed with islands of the most\npicturesque form.\n\nIt is a pity that so much beauty should have been wasted on Mrs. Ashe\nand Katy, but they were too frightened to half enjoy it. Their carriage\nwas driven by a shaggy young savage, who looked quite wild enough to be\na bandit himself. He cracked his whip loudly as they rolled along, and\nevery now and then gave a long shrill whistle. Mrs. Ashe was sure that\nthese were signals to his band, who were lurking somewhere on the\nolive-hung hillsides. She thought she detected him once or twice making\nsigns to certain questionable-looking characters as they passed; and she\nfancied that the people they met gazed at them with an air of\ncommiseration, as upon victims who were being carried to execution. Her\nfears affected Katy; so, though they talked and laughed, and made jokes\nto amuse Amy, who must not be scared or led to suppose that anything was\namiss, and to the outward view seemed a very merry party, they were\nprivately quaking in their shoes all the way, and enjoying a deal of\nhighly superfluous misery. And after all they reached Sorrento in\nperfect safety; and the driver, who looked so dangerous, turned out to\nbe a respectable young man enough, with a wife and family to support,\nwho considered a plateful of macaroni and a glass of sour red wine as\nthe height of luxury, and was grateful for a small gratuity of thirty\ncents or so, which would enable him to purchase these dainties. Mrs.\nAshe had a very bad headache next day, to pay for her fright; but she\nand Katy agreed that they had been very foolish, and resolved to pay no\nmore attention to unaccredited rumors or allow them to spoil their\nenjoyment, which was a sensible resolution to make.\n\nTheir hotel was perched directly over the sea. From the balcony of their\nsitting-room they looked down a sheer cliff some sixty feet high, into\nthe water; their bedrooms opened on a garden of roses, with an orange\ngrove beyond. Not far from them was the great gorge which cuts the\nlittle town of Sorrento almost in two, and whose seaward end makes the\nharbor of the place. Katy was never tired of peering down into this\nstrange and beautiful cleft, whose sides, two hundred feet in depth, are\nhung with vines and trailing growths of all sorts, and seem all\na-tremble with the fairy fronds of maiden-hair ferns growing out of\nevery chink and crevice. She and Amy took walks along the coast toward\nMassa, to look off at the lovely island shapes in the bay, and admire\nthe great clumps of cactus and Spanish bayonet which grew by the\nroadside; and they always came back loaded with orange-flowers, which\ncould be picked as freely as apple-blossoms from New England orchards in\nthe spring. The oranges themselves at that time of the year were very\nsour, but they answered as well for a romantic date, \"From an orange\ngrove,\" as if they had been the sweetest in the world.\n\nThey made two different excursions to Pompeii, which is within easy\ndistance of Sorrento. They scrambled on donkeys over the hills, and had\nglimpses of the far-away Calabrian shore, of the natural arch, and the\ntemples of P\u00c3\u00a6stum shining in the sun many miles distant. On Katy's\nbirthday, which fell toward the end of January, Mrs. Ashe let her have\nher choice of a treat; and she elected to go to the Island of Capri,\nwhich none of them had seen. It turned out a perfect day, with sea and\nwind exactly right for the sail, and to allow of getting into the famous\n\"Blue Grotto,\" which can only be entered under particular conditions of\ntide and weather. And they climbed the great cliff-rise at the island's\nend, and saw the ruins of the villa built by the wicked emperor\nTiberius, and the awful place known as his \"Leap,\" down which, it is\nsaid, he made his victims throw themselves; and they lunched at a hotel\nwhich bore his name, and just at sunset pushed off again for the row\nhome over the charmed sea. This return voyage was almost the pleasantest\nthing of all the day. The water was smooth, the moon at its full. It was\nlarger and more brilliant than American moons are, and seemed to possess\nan actual warmth and color. The boatmen timed their oar-strokes to the\ncadence of Neapolitan _barcaroles_ and folk-songs, full of rhythmic\nmovement, which seemed caught from the pulsing tides. And when at last\nthe bow grated on the sands of the Sorrento landing-place, Katy drew a\nlong, regretful breath, and declared that this was her best\nbirthday-gift of all, better than Amy's flowers, or the pretty\ntortoise-shell locket that Mrs. Ashe had given her, better even than the\nletter from home, which, timed by happy accident, had arrived by the\nmorning's post to make a bright opening for the day.\n\nAll pleasant things must come to an ending.\n\n\"Katy,\" said Mrs. Ashe, one afternoon in early February, \"I heard some\nladies talking just now in the _salon_, and they said that Rome is\nfilling up very fast. The Carnival begins in less than two weeks, and\neverybody wants to be there then. If we don't make haste, we shall not\nbe able to get any rooms.\"\n\n\"Oh dear!\" said Katy, \"it is very trying not to be able to be in two\nplaces at once. I want to see Rome dreadfully, and yet I cannot bear to\nleave Sorrento. We have been very happy here, haven't we?\"\n\nSo they took up their wandering staves again, and departed for Rome,\nlike the Apostle, \"not knowing what should befall them there.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nA ROMAN HOLIDAY.\n\n\n\"Oh dear!\" said Mrs. Ashe, as she folded her letters and laid them\naside, \"I wish those Pages would go away from Nice, or else that the\nfrigates were not there.\"\n\n\"Why! what's the matter?\" asked Katy, looking up from the many-leaved\njournal from Clover over which she was poring.\n\n\"Nothing is the matter except that those everlasting people haven't gone\nto Spain yet, as they said they would, and Ned seems to keep on seeing\nthem,\" replied Mrs. Ashe, petulantly.\n\n\"But, dear Polly, what difference does it make? And they never did\npromise you to go on any particular time, did they?\"\n\n\"N-o, they didn't; but I wish they would, all the same. Not that Ned is\nsuch a goose as really to care anything for that foolish Lilly!\" Then\nshe gave a little laugh at her own inconsistency, and added, \"But I\noughtn't to abuse her when she is your cousin.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it,\" said Katy, cheerfully. \"But, really, I don't see why\npoor Lilly need worry you so, Polly dear.\"\n\nThe room in which this conversation took place was on the very topmost\nfloor of the Hotel del Hondo in Rome. It was large and many-windowed;\nand though there was a little bed in one corner half hidden behind a\ncalico screen, with a bureau and washing-stand, and a sort of stout\nmahogany hat-tree on which Katy's dresses and jackets were hanging, the\nremaining space, with a sofa and easy-chairs grouped round a fire, and a\nround table furnished with books and a lamp, was ample enough to make a\ngood substitute for the private sitting-room which Mrs. Ashe had not\nbeen able to procure on account of the near approach of the Carnival and\nthe consequent crowding of strangers to Rome. In fact, she was assured\nthat under the circumstances she was lucky in finding rooms as good as\nthese; and she made the most of the assurance as a consolation for the\nsomewhat unsatisfactory food and service of the hotel, and the four long\nflights of stairs which must be passed every time they needed to reach\nthe dining-room or the street door.\n\nThe party had been in Rome only four days, but already they had seen a\nhost of interesting things. They had stood in the strange sunken space\nwith its marble floor and broken columns, which is all that is left of\nthe great Roman Forum. They had visited the Coliseum, at that period\nstill overhung with ivy garlands and trailing greeneries, and not, as\nnow, scraped clean and bare and \"tidied\" out of much of its\npicturesqueness. They had seen the Baths of Caracalla and the Temple of\nJanus and St. Peter's and the Vatican marbles, and had driven out on the\nCampagna and to the Pamphili-Doria Villa to gather purple and red\nanemones, and to the English cemetery to see the grave of Keats. They\nhad also peeped into certain shops, and attended a reception at the\nAmerican Minister's,--in short, like most unwarned travellers, they had\ndone about twice as much as prudence and experience would have\npermitted, had those worthies been consulted.\n\nAll the romance of Katy's nature responded to the fascination of the\nancient city,--the capital of the world, as it may truly be called. The\nshortest drive or walk brought them face to face with innumerable and\nunexpected delights. Now it was a wonderful fountain, with plunging\nhorses and colossal nymphs and Tritons, holding cups and horns from\nwhich showers of white foam rose high in air to fall like rushing rain\ninto an immense marble basin. Now it was an arched doorway with\ntraceries as fine as lace,--sole-remaining fragment of a heathen temple,\nflung and stranded as it were by the waves of time on the squalid shore\nof the present. Now it was a shrine at the meeting of three streets,\nwhere a dim lamp burned beneath the effigy of the Madonna, with always a\nfresh rose beside it in a vase, and at its foot a peasant woman kneeling\nin red bodice and blue petticoat, with a lace-trimmed towel folded over\nher hair. Or again it would be a sunlit terrace lifted high on a\nhillside, and crowded with carriages full of beautifully dressed people,\nwhile below all Rome seemed spread out like a panorama, dim, mighty,\nmajestic, and bounded by the blue wavy line of the Campagna and the\nAlban hills. Or perhaps it might be a wonderful double flight of steps\nwith massive balustrades and pillars with urns, on which sat a crowd of\nfigures in strange costumes and attitudes, who all looked as though they\nhad stepped out of pictures, but who were in reality models waiting for\nartists to come by and engage them. No matter what it was,--a bit of\noddly tinted masonry with a tuft of brown and orange wallflowers hanging\nupon it, or a vegetable stall where endive and chiccory and curly\nlettuces were arranged in wreaths with tiny orange gourds and scarlet\npeppers for points of color,--it was all Rome, and, by virtue of that\nword, different from any other place,--more suggestive, more\ninteresting, ten times more mysterious than any other could possibly be,\nso Katy thought.\n\nThis fact consoled her for everything and anything,--for the fleas, the\ndirt, for the queer things they had to eat and the still queerer odors\nthey were forced to smell! Nothing seemed of any particular consequence\nexcept the deep sense of enjoyment, and the newly discovered world of\nthought and sensation of which she had become suddenly conscious.\n\nThe only drawback to her happiness, as the days went on, was that\nlittle Amy did not seem quite well or like herself. She had taken a\ncold on the journey from Naples, and though it did not seem serious,\nthat, or something, made her look pale and thin. Her mother said she\nwas growing fast, but the explanation did not quite account for the\nwistful look in the child's eyes and the tired feeling of which she\ncontinually complained. Mrs. Ashe, with vague uneasiness, began to talk\nof cutting short their Roman stay and getting Amy off to the more\nbracing air of Florence. But meanwhile there was the Carnival close at\nhand, which they must by no means lose; and the feeling that their\nopportunity might be a brief one made her and Katy all the more anxious\nto make the very most of their time. So they filled the days full with\nsights to see and things to do, and came and went; sometimes taking Amy\nwith them, but more often leaving her at the hotel under the care of a\nkind German chambermaid, who spoke pretty good English and to whom Amy\nhad taken a fancy.\n\n\"The marble things are so cold, and the old broken things make me so\nsorry,\" she explained; \"and I hate beggars because they are dirty, and\nthe stairs make my back ache; and I'd a great deal rather stay with\nMaria and go up on the roof, if you don't mind, mamma.\"\n\nThis roof, which Amy had chosen as a playplace, covered the whole of the\ngreat hotel, and had been turned into a sort of upper-air garden by the\nsimple process of gravelling it all over, placing trellises of ivy here\nand there, and setting tubs of oranges and oleanders and boxes of gay\ngeraniums and stock-gillyflowers on the balustrades. A tame fawn was\ntethered there. Amy adopted him as a playmate; and what with his company\nand that of the flowers, the times when her mother and Katy were absent\nfrom her passed not unhappily.\n\nKaty always repaired to the roof as soon as they came in from their long\nmornings and afternoons of sight-seeing. Years afterward, she would\nremember with contrition how pathetically glad Amy always was to see\nher. She would put her little head on Katy's breast and hold her tight\nfor many minutes without saying a word. When she did speak it was always\nabout the house and the garden that she talked. She never asked any\nquestions as to where Katy had been, or what she had done; it seemed to\ntire her to think about it.\n\n\"I should be very lonely sometimes if it were not for my dear little\nfawn,\" she told Katy once. \"He is so sweet that I don't miss you and\nmamma very much while I have him to play with. I call him Florio,--don't\nyou think that is a pretty name? I like to stay with him a great deal\nbetter than to go about with you to those nasty-smelling old churches,\nwith fleas hopping all over them!\"\n\nSo Amy was left in peace with her fawn, and the others made haste to see\nall they could before the time came to go to Florence.\n\n[Illustration: Amy was left in peace with her fawn.]\n\nKaty realized one of the \"moments\" for which she had come to Europe when\nshe stood for the first time on the balcony overhanging the Corso, which\nMrs. Ashe had hired in company with some acquaintances made at the\nhotel, and looked down at the ebb and surge of the just-begun Carnival.\nThe narrow street seemed humming with people of all sorts and\nconditions. Some were masked; some were not. There were ladies and\ngentlemen in fashionable clothes, peasants in the gayest costumes,\nsurprised-looking tourists in tall hats and linen dusters, harlequins,\nclowns, devils, nuns, dominoes of every color,--red, white, blue, black;\nwhile above, the balconies bloomed like a rose-garden with pretty faces\nframed in lace veils or picturesque hats. Flowers were everywhere,\nwreathed along the house-fronts, tied to the horses' ears, in ladies'\nhands and gentlemen's button-holes, while venders went up and down the\nstreet bearing great trays of violets and carnations and camellias for\nsale. The air was full of cries and laughter, and the shrill calls of\nmerchants advertising their wares,--candy, fruit, birds, lanterns, and\n_confetti_, the latter being merely lumps of lime, large or small, with\na pea or a bean embedded in each lump to give it weight. Boxes full of\nthis unpleasant confection were suspended in front of each balcony, with\ntin scoops to use in ladling it out and flinging it about. Everybody\nwore or carried a wire mask as protection against this white, incessant\nshower; and before long the air became full of a fine dust which hung\nabove the Corso like a mist, and filled the eyes and noses and clothes\nof all present with irritating particles.\n\nPasquino's Car was passing underneath just as Katy and Mrs. Ashe\narrived,--a gorgeous affair, hung with silken draperies, and bearing as\nsymbol an enormous egg, in which the Carnival was supposed to be in act\nof incubation. A huge wagon followed in its wake, on which was a house\nsome sixteen feet square, whose sole occupant was a gentleman attended\nby five servants, who kept him supplied with _confetti_, which he\nshowered liberally on the heads of the crowd. Then came a car in the\nshape of a steamboat, with a smoke-pipe and sails, over which flew the\nUnion Jack, and which was manned with a party wearing the dress of\nBritish tars. The next wagon bore a company of jolly maskers equipped\nwith many-colored bladders, which they banged and rattled as they went\nalong. Following this was a troupe of beautiful circus horses,\ncream-colored with scarlet trappings, or sorrel with blue, ridden by\nladies in pale green velvet laced with silver, or blue velvet and gold.\nAnother car bore a bird-cage which was an exact imitation of St.\nPeter's, within which perched a lonely old parrot. This device evidently\nhad a political signification, for it was alternately hissed and\napplauded as it went along. The whole scene was like a brilliant,\nrapidly shifting dream; and Katy, as she stood with lips apart and eyes\nwide open with wonderment and pleasure, forgot whether she was in the\nbody or not,--forgot everything except what was passing before her gaze.\n\nShe was roused by a stinging shower of lime-dust. An Englishman in the\nnext balcony had take courteous advantage of her preoccupation, and had\nflung a scoopful of _confetti_ in her undefended face! It is generally\nAnglo-Saxons of the less refined class, English or Americans, who do\nthese things at Carnival times. The national love of a rough joke comes\nto the surface, encouraged by the license of the moment, and all the\ngrace and prettiness of the festival vanish. Katy laughed, and dusted\nherself as well as she could, and took refuge behind her mask; while a\nnimble American boy of the party changed places with her, and\nthenceforward made that particular Englishman his special target, plying\nsuch a lively and adroit shovel as to make Katy's assailant rue the hour\nwhen he evoked this national reprisal. His powdered head and rather\nclumsy efforts to retaliate excited shouts of laughter from the\nadjoining balconies. The young American, fresh from tennis and college\nathletics, darted about and dodged with an agility impossible to his\nheavily built foe; and each effective shot and parry on his side was\ngreeted with little cries of applause and the clapping of hands on the\npart of those who were watching the contest.\n\nExactly opposite them was a balcony hung with white silk, in which sat a\nlady who seemed to be of some distinction; for every now and then an\nofficer in brilliant uniform, or some official covered with orders and\nstars, would be shown in by her servants, bow before her with the utmost\ndeference, and after a little conversation retire, kissing her gloved\nhand as he went. The lady was a beautiful person, with lustrous black\neyes and dark hair, over which a lace mantilla was fastened with diamond\nstars. She wore pale blue with white flowers, and altogether, as Katy\nafterward wrote to Clover, reminded her exactly of one of those\nbeautiful princesses whom they used to play about in their childhood and\nquarrel over, because every one of them wanted to be the Princess and\nnobody else.\n\n\"I wonder who she is,\" said Mrs. Ashe in a low tone. \"She might be\nalmost anybody from her looks. She keeps glancing across to us, Katy. Do\nyou know, I think she has taken a fancy to you.\"\n\nPerhaps the lady had; for just then she turned her head and said a word\nto one of her footmen, who immediately placed something in her hand. It\nwas a little shining bonbonniere, and rising she threw it straight at\nKaty. Alas! it struck the edge of the balcony and fell into the street\nbelow, where it was picked up by a ragged little peasant girl in a red\njacket, who raised a pair of astonished eyes to the heavens, as if sure\nthat the gift must have fallen straight from thence. Katy bent forward\nto watch its fate, and went through a little pantomime of regret and\ndespair for the benefit of the opposite lady, who only laughed, and\ntaking another from her servant flung with better aim, so that it fell\nexactly at Katy's feet. This was a gilded box in the shape of a\nmandolin, with sugar-plums tucked cunningly away inside. Katy kissed\nboth her hands in acknowledgment for the pretty toy, and tossed back a\nbunch of roses which she happened to be wearing in her dress. After that\nit seemed the chief amusement of the fair unknown to throw bonbons at\nKaty. Some went straight and some did not; but before the afternoon\nended, Katy had quite a lapful of confections and trifles,--roses,\nsugared almonds, a satin casket, a silvered box in the shape of a\nhorseshoe, a tiny cage with orange blossoms for birds on the perches, a\nminute gondola with a _marron glac\u00c3\u00a9e_ by way of passenger, and,\nprettiest of all, a little ivory harp strung with enamelled violets\ninstead of wires. For all these favors she had nothing better to offer,\nin return, than a few long-tailed bonbons with gay streamers of ribbon.\nThese the lady opposite caught very cleverly, rarely missing one, and\nkissing her hand in thanks each time.\n\n\"Isn't she exquisite?\" demanded Katy, her eyes shining with\nexcitement. \"Did you ever see any one so lovely in your life, Polly\ndear? I never did. There, now! she is buying those birds to set them\nfree, I do believe.\"\n\nIt was indeed so. A vender of larks had, by the aid of a long staff,\nthrust a cage full of wretched little prisoners up into the balcony; and\n\"Katy's lady,\" as Mrs. Ashe called her, was paying for the whole. As\nthey watched she opened the cage door, and with the sweetest look on her\nface encouraged the birds to fly away. The poor little creatures cowered\nand hesitated, not knowing at first what use to make of their new\nliberty; but at last one, the boldest of the company, hopped to the door\nand with a glad, exultant chirp flew straight upward. Then the others,\ntaking courage from his example, followed, and all were lost to view in\nthe twinkling of an eye.\n\n\"Oh, you angel!\" cried Katy, leaning over the edge of the balcony and\nkissing both hands impulsively, \"I never saw any one so sweet as you are\nin my life. Polly dear, I think carnivals are the most perfectly\nbewitching things in the world. How glad I am that this lasts a week,\nand that we can come every day. Won't Amy be delighted with these\nbonbons! I do hope my lady will be here tomorrow.\"\n\nHow little she dreamed that she was never to enter that balcony again!\nHow little can any of us see what lies before us till it comes so near\nthat we cannot help seeing it, or shut our eyes, or turn away!\n\nThe next morning, almost as soon as it was light, Mrs. Ashe tapped at\nKaty's door. She was in her dressing-gown, and her eyes looked large and\nfrightened.\n\n\"Amy is ill,\" she cried. \"She has been hot and feverish all night, and\nshe says that her head aches dreadfully. What shall I do, Katy? We\nought to have a doctor at once, and I don't know the name even of any\ndoctor here.\"\n\nKaty sat up in bed, and for one bewildered moment did not speak. Her\nbrain felt in a whirl of confusion; but presently it cleared, and she\nsaw what to do.\n\n\"I will write a note to Mrs. Sands,\" she said. Mrs. Sands was the wife\nof the American Minister, and one of the few acquaintances they had\nmade since they came to Rome. \"You remember how nice she was the other\nday, and how we liked her; and she has lived here so long that of\ncourse she must know all about the doctors. Don't you think that is the\nbest thing to do!\"\n\n\"The very best,\" said Mrs. Ashe, looking relieved. \"I wonder I did not\nthink of it myself, but I am so confused that I can't think. Write the\nnote at once, please, dear Katy. I will ring your bell for you, and then\nI must hurry back to Amy.\"\n\nKaty made haste with the note. The answer came promptly in half an hour,\nand by ten o'clock the physician recommended appeared. Dr. Hilary was a\ndark little Italian to all appearance; but his mother had been a\nScotch-woman, and he spoke English very well,--a great comfort to poor\nMrs. Ashe, who knew not a word of Italian and not a great deal of\nFrench. He felt Amy's pulse for a long time, and tested her temperature;\nbut he gave no positive opinion, only left a prescription, and said that\nhe would call later in the day and should then be able to judge more\nclearly what the attack was likely to prove.\n\nKaty augured ill from this reserve. There was no talk of going to the\nCarnival that afternoon; no one had any heart for it. Instead, Katy\nspent the time in trying to recollect all she had ever heard about the\ncare of sick people,--what was to be done first and what next,--and in\nsearching the shops for a feather pillow, which luxury Amy was\nimperiously demanding. The pillows of Roman hotels are, as a general\nthing, stuffed with wool, and very hard.\n\n\"I won't have this horrid pillow any longer,\" poor Amy was screaming.\n\"It's got bricks in it. It hurts the back of my neck. Take it away,\nmamma, and give me a nice soft American pillow. I won't have this a\nminute longer. Don't you hear me, mamma! Take it away!\"\n\nSo, while Mrs. Ashe pacified Amy to the best of her ability, Katy\nhurried out in quest of the desired pillow. It proved almost an\nunattainable luxury; but at last, after a long search, she secured an\nair-cushion, a down cushion about twelve inches square, and one old\nfeather pillow which had come from some auction, and had apparently lain\nfor years in the corner of the shop. When this was encased in a fresh\ncover of Canton flannel, it did very well, and stilled Amy's complaints\na little; but all night she grew worse, and when Dr. Hilary came next\nday, he was forced to utter plainly the dreaded words \"Roman fever.\" Amy\nwas in for an attack,--a light one he hoped it might be,--but they had\nbetter know the truth and make ready for it.\n\nMrs. Ashe was utterly overwhelmed by this verdict, and for the first\nbewildered moments did not know which way to turn. Katy, happily, kept\na steadier head. She had the advantage of a little preparation of\nthought, and had decided beforehand what it would be necessary to do\n\"in case.\" Oh, that fateful \"in case\"! The doctor and she consulted\ntogether, and the result was that Katy sought out the padrona of the\nestablishment, and without hinting at the nature of Amy's attack,\nsecured some rooms just vacated, which were at the end of a corridor,\nand a little removed from the rooms of other people. There was a large\nroom with corner windows, a smaller one opening from it, and another,\nstill smaller, close by, which would serve as a storeroom or might do\nfor the use of a nurse.\n\nThese rooms, without much consultation with Mrs. Ashe,--who seemed\nstunned and sat with her eyes fixed on Amy, just answering, \"Certainly,\ndear, anything you say,\" when applied to,--Katy had arranged according\nto her own ideas of comfort and hygienic necessity, as learned from Miss\nNightingale's excellent little book on nursing. From the larger room she\nhad the carpet, curtains, and nearly all the furniture taken away, the\nfloor scrubbed with hot soapsuds, and the bed pulled out from the wall\nto allow of a free circulation of air all round it. The smaller one she\nmade as comfortable as possible for the use of Mrs. Ashe, choosing for\nit the softest sofa and the best mattresses that were obtainable; for\nshe knew that her friend's strength was likely to be severely tried if\nAmy's illness proved serious. When all was ready, Amy, well wrapped in\nher coverings, was carried down the entry and laid in the fresh bed with\nthe soft pillows about her; and Katy, as she went to and fro, conveying\nclothes and books and filling drawers, felt that they were perhaps\nmaking arrangements for a long, hard trial of faith and spirits.\n\nBy the next day the necessity of a nurse became apparent, and in the\nafternoon Katy started out in a little hired carriage in search of one.\nShe had a list of names, and went first to the English nurses; but\nfinding them all engaged, she ordered the coachman to drive to a convent\nwhere there was hope that a nursing sister might be procured.\n\nTheir route lay across the Corso. So utterly had the Carnival with all\nits gay follies vanished from her mind, that she was for a moment\nastonished at finding herself entangled in a motley crowd, so dense\nthat the coachman was obliged to rein in his horses and stand still for\nsome time.\n\nThere were the same masks and dominos, the same picturesque peasant\ncostumes which had struck her as so gay and pretty only three days\nbefore. The same jests and merry laughter filled the air, but somehow\nit all seemed out of tune. The sense of cold, lonely fear that had\ntaken possession of her killed all capacity for merriment; the\napprehension and solicitude of which her heart was full made the gay\nchattering and squeaking of the crowd sound harsh and unfeeling. The\nbright colors affronted her dejection; she did not want to see them.\nShe lay back in the carriage, trying to be patient under the detention,\nand half shut her eyes.\n\nA shower of lime dust aroused her. It came from a party of burly figures\nin white cotton dominos, whose carriage had been stayed by the crowd\nclose to her own. She signified by gestures that she had no _confetti_\nand no protection, that she \"was not playing,\" in fact; but her appeal\nmade no difference. The maskers kept on shovelling lime all over her\nhair and person and the carriage, and never tired of the sport till an\nopportune break in the procession enabled their vehicle to move on.\n\nKaty was shaking their largesse from her dress and parasol as well as\nshe could, when an odd gibbering sound close to her ear, and the\nlaughter of the crowd attracted her attention to the back of the\ncarriage. A masker attired as a scarlet devil had climbed into the hood,\nand was now perched close behind her. She shook her head at him; but he\nonly shook his in return, and chattered and grimaced, and bent over till\nhis fiery mask almost grazed her shoulder. There was no hope but in good\nhumor, as she speedily realized; and recollecting that in her\nshopping-bag one or two of the Carnival bonbons still remained, she took\nthese out and offered them in the hope of propitiating him. The fiend\nbit one to insure that it was made of sugar and not lime, while the\ncrowd laughed more than ever; then, seeming satisfied, he made Katy a\nlittle speech in rapid Italian, of which she did not comprehend a word,\nkissed her hand, jumped down from the carriage and disappeared in the\ncrowd to her great relief.\n\nPresently after that the driver spied an opening, of which he took\nadvantage. They were across the Corso now, the roar and rush of the\nCarnival dying into silence as they drove rapidly on; and Katy, as she\nfinished wiping away the last of the lime dust, wiped some tears from\nher cheeks as well.\n\n\"How hateful it all was!\" she said to herself. Then she remembered a\nsentence read somewhere, \"How heavily roll the wheels of other people's\njoys when your heart is sorrowful!\" and she realized that it is true.\n\nThe convent was propitious, and promised to send a sister next morning,\nwith the proviso that every second day she was to come back to sleep and\nrest. Katy was too thankful for any aid to make objections, and drove\nhome with visions of saintly nuns with pure pale faces full of peace and\nresignation, such as she had read of in books, floating before her eyes.\n\nSister Ambrogia, when she appeared next day, did not exactly realize\nthese imaginations. She was a plump little person, with rosy cheeks, a\npair of demure black eyes, and a very obstinate mouth and chin. It soon\nappeared that natural inclination combined with the rules of her convent\nmade her theory of a nurse's duties a very limited one.\n\nIf Mrs. Ashe wished her to go down to the office with an order, she was\ntold: \"We sisters care for the sick; we are not allowed to converse with\nporters and hotel people.\"\n\nIf Katy suggested that on the way home she should leave a prescription\nat the chemist's, it was: \"We sisters are for nursing only; we do not\nvisit shops.\" And when she was asked if she could make beef tea, she\nreplied calmly but decisively, \"We sisters are not cooks.\"\n\nIn fact, all that Sister Ambrogia seemed able or willing to do, beyond\nthe bathing of Amy's face and brushing her hair, which she accomplished\nhandily, was to sit by the bedside telling her rosary, or plying a\nlittle ebony shuttle in the manufacture of a long strip of tatting. Even\nthis amount of usefulness was interfered with by the fact that Amy, who\nby this time was in a semi-delirious condition, had taken an aversion to\nher at the first glance, and was not willing to be left with her for a\nsingle moment.\n\n\"I won't stay here alone with Sister Embroidery,\" she would cry, if her\nmother and Katy went into the next room for a moment's rest or a private\nconsultation; \"I hate Sister Embroidery! Come back, mamma, come back\nthis moment! She's making faces at me, and chattering just like an old\nparrot, and I don't understand a word she says. Take Sister Embroidery\naway, mamma, I tell you! Don't you hear me? Come back, I say!\"\n\nThe little voice would be raised to a shrill scream; and Mrs. Ashe and\nKaty, hurrying back, would find Amy sitting up on her pillow with wet,\nscarlet-flushed cheeks and eyes bright with fever, ready to throw\nherself out of bed; while, calm as Mabel, whose curly head lay on the\npillow beside her little mistress, Sister Ambrogia, unaware of the\nintricacies of the English language, was placidly telling her beads and\nmuttering prayers to herself. Some of these prayers, I do not doubt,\nrelated to Amy's recovery if not to her conversion, and were well meant;\nbut they were rather irritating under the circumstances!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nCLEAR SHINING AFTER RAIN.\n\n\nWhen the first shock is over and the inevitable realized and accepted,\nthose who tend a long illness are apt to fall into a routine of life\nwhich helps to make the days seem short. The apparatus of nursing is got\ntogether. Every day the same things need to be done at the same hours\nand in the same way. Each little appliance is kept at hand; and sad and\ntired as the watchers may be, the very monotony and regularity of their\nproceedings give a certain stay for their thoughts to rest upon.\n\nBut there was little of this monotony to help Mrs. Ashe and Katy through\nwith Amy's illness. Small chance was there for regularity or exact\nsystem; for something unexpected was always turning up, and needful\nthings were often lacking. The most ordinary comforts of the sick-room,\nor what are considered so in America, were hard to come by, and much of\nKaty's time was spent in devising substitutes to take their places.\n\nWas ice needed? A pailful of dirty snow would be brought in, full of\nstraws, sticks, and other refuse, which had apparently been scraped from\nthe surface of the street after a frosty night. Not a particle of it\ncould be put into milk or water; all that could be done was to make the\npail serve the purpose of a refrigerator, and set bowls and tumblers in\nit to chill.\n\nWas a feeding-cup wanted? It came of a cumbrous and antiquated pattern,\nwhich the infant Hercules may have enjoyed, but which the modern Amy\nabominated and rejected. Such a thing as a glass tube could not be found\nin all Rome. Bed-rests were unknown. Katy searched in vain for an\nIndia-rubber hot-water bag.\n\nBut the greatest trial of all was the beef tea. It was Amy's sole food,\nand almost her only medicine; for Dr. Hilary believed in leaving Nature\npretty much to herself in cases of fever. The kitchen of the hotel sent\nup, under that name, a mixture of grease and hot water, which could not\nbe given to Amy at all. In vain Katy remonstrated and explained the\nprocess. In vain did she go to the kitchen herself to translate a\ncarefully written recipe to the cook, and to slip a shining five-franc\npiece in his hand, which it was hoped would quicken his energies and\nsoften his heart. In vain did she order private supplies of the best of\nbeef from a separate market. The cooks stole the beef and ignored the\nrecipe; and day after day the same bottle-full of greasy liquid came\nupstairs, which Amy would not touch, and which would have done her no\ngood had she swallowed it all. At last, driven to desperation, Katy\nprocured a couple of stout bottles, and every morning slowly and\ncarefully cut up two pounds of meat into small pieces, sealed the bottle\nwith her own seal ring, and sent it down to be boiled for a specified\ntime. This answered better, for the thieving cook dared not tamper with\nher seal; but it was a long and toilsome process, and consumed more time\nthan she well knew how to spare,--for there were continual errands to be\ndone which no one could attend to but herself, and the interminable\nflights of stairs taxed her strength painfully, and seemed to grow\nlonger and harder every day.\n\nAt last a good Samaritan turned up in the shape of an American lady with\na house of her own, who, hearing of their plight from Mrs. Sands,\nundertook to send each day a supply of strong, perfectly made beef tea,\nfrom her own kitchen, for Amy's use. It was an inexpressible relief, and\nthe lightening of this one particular care made all the rest seem easier\nof endurance.\n\nAnother great relief came, when, after some delay, Dr. Hilary succeeded\nin getting an English nurse to take the places of the unsatisfactory\nSister Ambrogia and her substitute, Sister Agatha, whom Amy in her\nhalf-comprehending condition persisted in calling \"Sister Nutmeg\nGrater.\" Mrs. Swift was a tall, wiry, angular person, who seemed made of\nequal parts of iron and whalebone. She was never tired; she could lift\nanybody, do anything; and for sleep she seemed to have a sort of\nantipathy, preferring to sit in an easy-chair and drop off into little\ndozes, whenever it was convenient, to going regularly to bed for a\nnight's rest.\n\nAmy took to her from the first, and the new nurse managed her\nbeautifully. No one else could soothe her half so well during the\ndelirious period, when the little shrill voice seemed never to be still,\nand went on all day and all night in alternate raving or screaming or,\nwhat was saddest of all to hear, low pitiful moans. There was no\nshutting in these sounds. People moved out of the rooms below and on\neither side, because they could get no sleep; and till the arrival of\nNurse Swift, there was no rest for poor Mrs. Ashe, who could not keep\naway from her darling for a moment while that mournful wailing sounded\nin her ears.\n\nSomehow the long, dry Englishwoman seemed to have a mesmeric effect on\nAmy, who was never quite so violent after she arrived. Katy was more\nthankful for this than can well be told; for her great underlying\ndread--a dread she dared not whisper plainly even to herself--was that\n\"Polly dear\" might break down before Amy was better, and then what\n_should_ they do?\n\nShe took every care that was possible of her friend. She made her eat;\nshe made her lie down. She forced daily doses of quinine and port-wine\ndown her throat, and saved her every possible step. But no one, however\naffectionate and willing, could do much to lift the crushing burden of\ncare, which was changing Mrs. Ashe's rosy fairness to wan pallor and\nlaying such dark shadows under the pretty gray eyes. She had taken small\nthought of looks since Amy's illness. All the little touches which had\nmade her toilette becoming, all the crimps and fluffs, had disappeared;\nyet somehow never had she seemed to Katy half so lovely as now in the\nplain black gown which she wore all day long, with her hair tucked into\na knot behind her ears. Her real beauty of feature and outline seemed\nonly enhanced by the rigid plainness of her attire, and the charm of\ntrue expression grew in her face. Never had Katy admired and loved her\nfriend so well as during those days of fatigue and wearing suspense, or\nrealized so strongly the worth of her sweetness of temper, her\nunselfishness and power of devoting herself to other people.\n\n\"Polly bears it wonderfully,\" she wrote her father; \"she was all broken\ndown for the first day or two, but now her courage and patience are\nsurprising. When I think how precious Amy is to her and how lonely her\nlife would be if she were to die, I can hardly keep the tears out of my\neyes. But Polly does not cry. She is quiet and brave and almost cheerful\nall the time, keeping herself busy with what needs to be done; she never\ncomplains, and she looks--oh, so pretty! I think I never knew how much\nshe had in her before.\"\n\nAll this time no word had come from Lieutenant Worthington. His sister\nhad written him as soon as Amy was taken ill, and had twice telegraphed\nsince, but no answer had been received, and this strange silence added\nto the sense of lonely isolation and distance from home and help which\nthose who encounter illness in a foreign land have to bear.\n\nSo first one week and then another wore themselves away somehow. The\nfever did not break on the fourteenth day, as had been hoped, and must\nrun for another period, the doctor said; but its force was lessened, and\nhe considered that a favorable sign. Amy was quieter now and did not\nrave so constantly, but she was very weak. All her pretty hair had been\nshorn away, which made her little face look tiny and sharp. Mabel's\ngolden wig was sacrificed at the same time. Amy had insisted upon it,\nand they dared not cross her.\n\n\"She has got a fever, too, and it's a great deal badder than mine is,\"\nshe protested. \"Her cheeks are as hot as fire. She ought to have ice on\nher head, and how can she when her bang is so thick? Cut it all off,\nevery bit, and then I will let you cut mine.\"\n\n\"You had better give ze child her way,\" said Dr. Hilary. \"She's in no\nstate to be fretted with triffles [trifles, the doctor meant], and in ze\nend it will be well; for ze fever infection might harbor in zat doll's\nhead as well as elsewhere, and I should have to disinfect it, which\nwould be bad for ze skin of her.\"\n\n\"She isn't a doll,\" cried Amy, overhearing him; \"she's my child, and you\nsha'n't call her names.\" She hugged Mabel tight in her arms, and glared\nat Dr. Hilary defiantly.\n\nSo Katy with pitiful fingers slashed away at Mabel's blond wig till her\nhead was as bare as a billiard-ball; and Amy, quite content, patted her\nchild while her own locks were being cut, and murmured, \"Perhaps your\nhair will all come out in little round curls, darling, as Johnnie Carr's\ndid;\" then she fell into one of the quietest sleeps she had yet had.\n\nIt was the day after this that Katy, coming in from a round of errands,\nfound Mrs. Ashe standing erect and pale, with a frightened look in her\neyes, and her back against Amy's door, as if defending it from somebody.\nConfronting her was Madame Frulini, the _padrona_ of the hotel. Madame's\ncheeks were red, and her eyes bright and fierce; she was evidently in a\nrage about something, and was pouring out a torrent of excited Italian,\nwith now and then a French or English word slipped in by way of\npunctuation, and all so rapidly that only a trained ear could have\nfollowed or grasped her meaning.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Katy, in amazement.\n\n\"Oh, Katy, I am so glad you have come,\" cried poor Mrs. Ashe. \"I can\nhardly understand a word that this horrible woman says, but I think she\nwants to turn us out of the hotel, and that we shall take Amy to some\nother place. It would be the death of her,--I know it would. I never,\nnever will go, unless the doctor says it is safe. I oughtn't to,--I\ncouldn't; she can't make me, can she, Katy?\"\n\n\"Madame,\" said Katy,--and there was a flash in her eyes before which the\nlandlady rather shrank,--\"what is all this? Why do you come to trouble\nmadame while her child is so ill?\"\n\nThen came another torrent of explanation which didn't explain; but Katy\ngathered enough of the meaning to make out that Mrs. Ashe was quite\ncorrect in her guess, and that Madame Frulini was requesting, nay,\ninsisting, that they should remove Amy from the hotel at once. There\nwere plenty of apartments to be had now that the Carnival was over, she\nsaid,--her own cousin had rooms close by,--it could easily be arranged,\nand people were going away from the Del Mondo every day because there\nwas fever in the house. Such a thing could not be, it should not\nbe,--the landlady's voice rose to a shriek, \"the child must go!\"\n\n\"You are a cruel woman,\" said Katy, indignantly, when she had grasped\nthe meaning of the outburst. \"It is wicked, it is cowardly, to come thus\nand attack a poor lady under your roof who has so much already to bear.\nIt is her only child who is lying in there,--her only one, do you\nunderstand, madame?--and she is a widow. What you ask might kill the\nchild. I shall not permit you or any of your people to enter that door\ntill the doctor comes, and then I shall tell him how you have behaved,\nand we shall see what he will say.\" As she spoke she turned the key of\nAmy's door, took it out and put it in her pocket, then faced the\n_padrona_ steadily, looking her straight in the eyes.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" stormed the landlady, \"I give you my word, four people\nhave left this house already because of the noises made by little miss.\nMore will go. I shall lose my winter's profit,--all of it,--all; it will\nbe said there is fever at the Del Mondo,--no one will hereafter come to\nme. There are lodgings plenty, comfortable,--oh, so comfortable! I will\nnot have my season ruined by a sickness; no, I will not!\"\n\nMadame Frulini's voice was again rising to a scream.\n\n\"Be silent!\" said Katy, sternly; \"you will frighten the child. I am\nsorry that you should lose any customers, madame, but the fever is here\nand we are here, and here we must stay till it is safe to go. The child\nshall not be moved till the doctor gives permission. Money is not the\nonly thing in the world! Mrs. Ashe will pay anything that is fair to\nmake up your losses to you, but you must leave this room now, and not\nreturn till Dr. Hilary is here.\"\n\nWhere Katy found French for all these long coherent speeches, she could\nnever afterward imagine. She tried to explain it by saying that\nexcitement inspired her for the moment, but that as soon as the moment\nwas over the inspiration died away and left her as speechless and\nconfused as ever. Clover said it made her think of the miracle of\nBalaam; and Katy merrily rejoined that it might be so, and that no\ndonkey in any age of the world could possibly have been more grateful\nthan was she for the sudden gift of speech.\n\n\"But it is not the money,--it is my prestige,\" declared the landlady.\n\n\"Thank Heaven! here is the doctor now,\" cried Mrs. Ashe.\n\nThe doctor had in fact been standing in the doorway for several moments\nbefore they noticed him, and had overheard part of the colloquy with\nMadame Frulini. With him was some one else, at the sight of whom Mrs.\nAshe gave a great sob of relief. It was her brother, at last.\n\nWhen Italian meets Italian, then comes the tug of expletive. It did not\nseem to take one second for Dr. Hilary to whirl the _padrona_ out into\nthe entry, where they could be heard going at each other like two\nfurious cats. Hiss, roll, sputter, recrimination, objurgation! In five\nminutes Madame Frulini was, metaphorically speaking, on her knees, and\nthe doctor standing over her with drawn sword, making her take back\nevery word she had said and every threat she had uttered.\n\n\"Prestige of thy miserable hotel!\" he thundered; \"where will that be\nwhen I go and tell the English and Americans--all of whom I know, every\none!--how thou hast served a countrywoman of theirs in thy house? Dost\nthou think thy prestige will help thee much when Dr. Hilary has fixed a\nblack mark on thy door! I tell thee no; not a stranger shalt thou have\nnext year to eat so much as a plate of macaroni under thy base roof! I\nwill advertise thy behavior in all the foreign papers,--in Figaro, in\nGalignani, in the Swiss Times, and the English one which is read by all\nthe nobility, and the Heraldo of New York, which all Americans peruse--\"\n\n\"Oh, doctor--pardon me--I regret what I said--I am afflicted--\"\n\n\"I will post thee in the railroad stations,\" continued the doctor,\nimplacably; \"I will bid my patients to write letters to all their\nfriends, warning them against thy flea-ridden Del Mondo; I will apprise\nthe steamboat companies at Genoa and Naples. Thou shalt see what comes\nof it,--truly, thou shalt see.\"\n\nHaving thus reduced Madame Frulini to powder, the doctor now\ncondescended to take breath and listen to her appeals for mercy; and\npresently he brought her in with her mouth full of protestations and\napologies, and assurances that the ladies had mistaken her meaning, she\nhad only spoken for the good of all; nothing was further from her\nintention than that they should be disturbed or offended in any way, and\nshe and all her household were at the service of \"the little sick angel\nof God.\" After which the doctor dismissed her with an air of\ncontemptuous tolerance, and laid his hand on the door of Amy's room.\nBehold, it was locked!\n\n\"Oh, I forgot,\" cried Katy, laughing; and she pulled the key out of\nher pocket.\n\n\"You are a hee-roine, mademoiselle,\" said Dr. Hilary. \"I watched you as\nyou faced that tigress, and your eyes were like a swordsman's as he\nregards his enemy's rapier.\"\n\n\"Oh, she was so brave, and such a help!\" said Mrs. Ashe, kissing her\nimpulsively. \"You can't think how she has stood by me all through, Ned,\nor what a comfort she has been.\"\n\n\"Yes, I can,\" said Ned Worthington, with a warm, grateful look at Katy.\n\"I can believe anything good of Miss Carr.\"\n\n\"But where have _you_ been all this time?\" said Katy, who felt this\nflood of compliment to be embarrassing; \"we have so wondered at not\nhearing from you.\"\n\n\"I have been off on a ten-days' leave to Corsica for moufflon-shooting,\"\nreplied Mr. Worthington. \"I only got Polly's telegrams and letters day\nbefore yesterday, and I came away as soon as I could get my leave\nextended. It was a most unlucky absence. I shall always regret it.\"\n\n\"Oh, it is all right now that you have come,\" his sister said, leaning\nher head on his arm with a look of relief and rest which was good to\nsee. \"Everything will go better now, I am sure.\"\n\n\"Katy Carr has behaved like a perfect angel,\" she told her brother when\nthey were alone.\n\n\"She is a trump of a girl. I came in time for part of that scene with\nthe landlady, and upon my word she was glorious! I didn't suppose she\ncould look so handsome.\"\n\n\"Have the Pages left Nice yet?\" asked his sister, rather irrelevantly.\n\n\"No,--at least they were there on Thursday, but I think that they were\nto start to-day.\"\n\nMr. Worthington answered carelessly, but his face darkened as he spoke.\nThere had been a little scene in Nice which he could not forget. He was\nsitting in the English garden with Lilly and her mother when his\nsister's telegrams were brought to him; and he had read them aloud,\npartly as an explanation for the immediate departure which they made\nnecessary and which broke up an excursion just arranged with the ladies\nfor the afternoon. It is not pleasant to have plans interfered with; and\nas neither Mrs. Page nor her daughter cared personally for little Amy,\nit is not strange that disappointment at the interruption of their\npleasure should have been the first impulse with them. Still, this did\nnot excuse Lilly's unstudied exclamation of \"Oh, bother!\" and though she\nspeedily repented it as an indiscretion, and was properly sympathetic,\nand \"hoped the poor little thing would soon be better,\" Amy's uncle\ncould not forget the jarring impression. It completed a process of\ndisenchantment which had long been going on; and as hearts are sometimes\ncaught at the rebound, Mrs. Ashe was not so far astray when she built\ncertain little dim sisterly hopes on his evident admiration for Katy's\ncourage and this sudden awakening to a sense of her good looks.\n\nBut no space was left for sentiment or match-making while still Amy's\nfate hung in the balance, and all three of them found plenty to do\nduring the next fortnight. The fever did not turn on the twenty-first\nday, and another weary week of suspense set in, each day bringing a\ndecrease of the dangerous symptoms, but each day as well marking a\nlessening in the childish strength which had been so long and severely\ntested. Amy was quite conscious now, and lay quietly, sleeping a great\ndeal and speaking seldom. There was not much to do but to wait and hope;\nbut the flame of hope burned low at times, as the little life flickered\nin its socket, and seemed likely to go out like a wind-blown torch.\n\nNow and then Lieutenant Worthington would persuade his sister to go\nwith him for a few minutes' drive or walk in the fresh air, from which\nshe had so long been debarred, and once or twice he prevailed on Katy\nto do the same; but neither of them could bear to be away long from\nAmy's bedside.\n\nIntimacy grows fast when people are thus united by a common anxiety,\nsharing the same hopes and fears day after day, speaking and thinking of\nthe same thing. The gay young officer at Nice, who had counted so little\nin Katy's world, seemed to have disappeared, and the gentle,\nconsiderate, tender-hearted fellow who now filled his place was quite a\ndifferent person in her eyes. Katy began to count on Ned Worthington as\na friend who could be trusted for help and sympathy and comprehension,\nand appealed to and relied upon in all emergencies. She was quite at\nease with him now, and asked him to do this and that, to come and help\nher, or to absent himself, as freely as if he had been Dorry or Phil.\n\nHe, on his part, found this easy intimacy charming. In the reaction of\nhis temporary glamour for the pretty Lilly, Katy's very difference from\nher was an added attraction. This difference consisted, as much as\nanything else, in the fact that she was so truly in earnest in what she\nsaid and did. Had Lilly been in Katy's place, she would probably have\nbeen helpful to Mrs. Ashe and kind to Amy so far as in her lay; but the\nthought of self would have tinctured all that she did and said, and the\nneed of keeping to what was tasteful and becoming would have influenced\nher in every emergency, and never have been absent from her mind.\n\nKaty, on the contrary, absorbed in the needs of the moment, gave little\nheed to how she looked or what any one was thinking about her. Her habit\nof neatness made her take time for the one thorough daily dressing,--the\nbrushing of hair and freshening of clothes, which were customary with\nher; but, this tax paid to personal comfort, she gave little further\nheed to appearances. She wore an old gray gown, day in and day out,\nwhich Lilly would not have put on for half an hour without a large\nbribe, so unbecoming was it; but somehow Lieutenant Worthington grew to\nlike the gray gown as a part of Katy herself. And if by chance he\nbrought a rose in to cheer the dim stillness of the sick-room, and she\ntucked it into her buttonhole, immediately it was as though she were\ndecked for conquest. Pretty dresses are very pretty on pretty\npeople,--they certainly play an important part in this queer little\nworld of ours; but depend upon it, dear girls, no woman ever has\nestablished so distinct and clear a claim on the regard of her lover as\nwhen he has ceased to notice or analyze what she wears, and just accepts\nit unquestioningly, whatever it is, as a bit of the dear human life\nwhich has grown or is growing to be the best and most delightful thing\nin the world to him.\n\nThe gray gown played its part during the long anxious night when they\nall sat watching breathlessly to see which way the tide would turn with\ndear little Amy. The doctor came at midnight, and went away to come\nagain at dawn. Mrs. Swift sat grim and watchful beside the pillow of her\ncharge, rising now and then to feel pulse and skin, or to put a spoonful\nof something between Amy's lips. The doors and windows stood open to\nadmit the air. In the outer room all was hushed. A dim Roman lamp, fed\nwith olive oil, burned in one corner behind a screen. Mrs. Ashe lay on\nthe sofa with her eyes closed, bearing the strain of suspense in\nabsolute silence. Her brother sat beside her, holding in his one of the\nhot hands whose nervous twitches alone told of the surgings of hope and\nfear within. Katy was resting in a big chair near by, her wistful eyes\nfixed on Amy's little figure seen in the dim distance, her ears alert\nfor every sound from the sick-room.\n\nSo they watched and waited. Now and then Ned Worthington or Katy would\nrise softly, steal on tiptoe to the bedside, and come back to whisper to\nMrs. Ashe that Amy had stirred or that she seemed to be asleep. It was\none of the nights which do not come often in a lifetime, and which\npeople never forget. The darkness seems full of meaning; the hush, of\nsound. God is beyond, holding the sunrise in his right hand, holding the\nsun of our earthly hopes as well,--will it dawn in sorrow or in joy? We\ndare not ask, we can only wait.\n\nA faint stir of wind and a little broadening of the light roused Katy\nfrom a trance of half-understood thoughts. She crept once more into\nAmy's room. Mrs. Swift laid a warning finger on her lips; Amy was\nsleeping, she said with a gesture. Katy whispered the news to the still\nfigure on the sofa, then she went noiselessly out of the room. The great\nhotel was fast asleep; not a sound stirred the profound silence of the\ndark halls. A longing for fresh air led her to the roof.\n\nThere was the dawn just tingeing the east. The sky, even thus early,\nwore the deep mysterious blue of Italy. A fresh _tramontana_ was\nblowing, and made Katy glad to draw her shawl about her.\n\nFar away in the distance rose the Alban Hills above the dim Campagna,\nwith the more lofty Sabines beyond, and Soracte, clear cut against the\nsky like a wave frozen in the moment of breaking. Below lay the ancient\ncity, with its strange mingling of the old and the new, of past things\nembedded in the present; or is it the present thinly veiling the rich\nand mighty past,--who shall say?\n\nFaint rumblings of wheels and here and there a curl of smoke showed that\nRome was waking up. The light insensibly grew upon the darkness. A pink\nflush lit up the horizon. Florio stirred in his lair, stretched his\ndappled limbs, and as the first sun-ray glinted on the roof, raised\nhimself, crossed the gravelled tiles with soundless feet, and ran his\nsoft nose into Katy's hand. She fondled him for Amy's sake as she stood\nbent over the flower-boxes, inhaling the scent of the mignonette and\ngilly-flowers, with her eyes fixed on the distance; but her heart was at\nhome with the sleepers there, and a rush of strong desire stirred her.\nWould this dreary time come to an end presently, and should they be set\nat liberty to go their ways with no heavy sorrow to press them down, to\nbe care-free and happy again in their own land?\n\nA footstep startled her. Ned Worthington was coming over the roof on\ntiptoe as if fearful of disturbing somebody. His face looked resolute\nand excited.\n\n\"I wanted to tell you,\" he said in a hushed voice, \"that the doctor is\nhere, and he says Amy has no fever, and with care may be considered out\nof danger.\"\n\n\"Thank God!\" cried Katy, bursting into tears. The long fatigue, the\nfears kept in check so resolutely, the sleepless night just passed, had\ntheir revenge now, and she cried and cried as if she could never stop,\nbut with all the time such joy and gratitude in her heart! She was\nconscious that Ned had his arm round her and was holding both her hands\ntight; but they were so one in the emotion of the moment that it did not\nseem strange.\n\n\"How sweet the sun looks!\" she said presently, releasing herself, with a\nhappy smile flashing through her tears; \"it hasn't seemed really bright\nfor ever so long. How silly I was to cry! Where is dear Polly? I must go\ndown to her at once. Oh, what does she say?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nNEXT.\n\n\nLieut. Worthington's leave had nearly expired. He must rejoin his\nship; but he waited till the last possible moment in order to help his\nsister through the move to Albano, where it had been decided that Amy\nshould go for a few days of hill air before undertaking the longer\njourney to Florence.\n\nIt was a perfect morning in late March when the pale little invalid was\ncarried in her uncle's strong arms, and placed in the carriage which was\nto take them to the old town on the mountain slopes which they had seen\nshining from far away for so many weeks past. Spring had come in her\nfairest shape to Italy. The Campagna had lost its brown and tawny hues\nand taken on a tinge of fresher color. The olive orchards were budding\nthickly. Almond boughs extended their dazzling shapes across the blue\nsky. Arums and acanthus and ivy filled every hollow, roses nodded from\nover every gate, while a carpet of violets and cyclamen and primroses\nstretched over the fields and freighted every wandering wind with\nfragrance.\n\nWhen once the Campagna with its long line of aqueducts, arches, and\nhoary tombs was left behind, and the carriage slowly began to mount the\ngradual rises of the hill, Amy revived. With every breath of the fresher\nair her eyes seemed to brighten and her voice to grow stronger. She held\nMabel up to look at the view; and the sound of her laugh, faint and\nfeeble as it was, was like music to her mother's ears.\n\nAmy wore a droll little silk-lined cap on her head, over which a downy\ngrowth of pale-brown fuzz was gradually thickening. Already it showed a\ntendency to form into tiny rings, which to Amy, who had always hankered\nfor curls, was an extreme satisfaction. Strange to say, the same thing\nexactly had happened to Mabel; her hair had grown out into soft little\nround curls also! Uncle Ned and Katy had ransacked Rome for this\nbaby-wig, which filled and realized all Amy's hopes for her child. On\nthe same excursion they had bought the materials for the pretty spring\nsuit which Mabel wore, for it had been deemed necessary to sacrifice\nmost of her wardrobe as a concession to possible fever-germs. Amy\nadmired the pearl-colored dress and hat, the fringed jacket and little\nlace-trimmed parasol so much, that she was quite consoled for the loss\nof the blue velvet costume and ermine muff which had been the pride of\nher heart ever since they left Paris, and whose destruction they had\nscarcely dared to confess to her.\n\nSo up, up, up, they climbed till the gateway of the old town was passed,\nand the carriage stopped before a quaint building once the residence of\nthe Bishop of Albano, but now known as the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de la Poste. Here they\nalighted, and were shown up a wide and lofty staircase to their rooms,\nwhich were on the sunny side of the house, and looked across a walled\ngarden, where roses and lemon trees grew beside old fountains guarded by\nsculptured lions and heathen divinities with broken noses and a scant\nsupply of fingers and toes, to the Campagna, purple with distance and\nstretching miles and miles away to where Rome sat on her seven hills,\nlifting high the Dome of St. Peter's into the illumined air.\n\nNurse Swift said that Amy must go to bed at once, and have a long rest.\nBut Amy nearly wept at the proposal, and declared that she was not a bit\ntired and couldn't sleep if she went to bed ever so much. The change of\nair had done her good already, and she looked more like herself than for\nmany weeks past. They compromised their dispute on a sofa, where Amy,\nwell wrapped up, was laid, and where, in spite of her protestations, she\npresently fell asleep, leaving the others free to examine and arrange\ntheir new quarters.\n\nSuch enormous rooms as they were! It was quite a journey to go from one\nside of them to another. The floors were of stone, with squares of\ncarpet laid down over them, which looked absurdly small for the great\nspaces they were supposed to cover. The beds and tables were of the\nusual size, but they seemed almost like doll furniture because the\nchambers were so big. A quaint old paper, with an enormous pattern of\nbanyan trees and pagodas, covered the walls, and every now and then\nbetrayed by an oblong of regular cracks the existence of a hidden door,\npapered to look exactly like the rest of the wall.\n\nThese mysterious doors made Katy nervous, and she never rested till she\nhad opened every one of them and explored the places they led to. One\ngave access to a queer little bathroom. Another led, through a narrow\ndark passage, to a sort of balcony or loggia overhanging the garden. A\nthird ended in a dusty closet with an artful chink in it from which you\ncould peep into what had been the Bishop's drawing-room but which was\nnow turned into the dining-room of the hotel. It seemed made for\npurposes of espial; and Katy had visions of a long line of reverend\nprelates with their ears glued to the chink, overhearing what was being\nsaid about them in the apartment beyond.\n\nThe most surprising of all she did not discover till she was going to\nbed on the second night after their arrival, when she thought she knew\nall about the mysterious doors and what they led to. A little\nunexplained draught of wind made her candle flicker, and betrayed the\nexistence of still another door so cunningly hid in the wall pattern\nthat she had failed to notice it. She had quite a creepy feeling as she\ndrew her dressing-gown about her, took a light, and entered the narrow\npassage into which it opened. It was not a long passage, and ended\npresently in a tiny oratory. There was a little marble altar, with a\nkneeling-step and candlesticks and a great crucifix above. Ends of wax\ncandles still remained in the candlesticks, and bunches of dusty paper\nflowers filled the vases which stood on either side of them. A faded\nsilk cushion lay on the step. Doubtless the Bishop had often knelt\nthere. Katy felt as if she were the first person to enter the place\nsince he went away. Her common-sense told her that in a hotel bedroom\nconstantly occupied by strangers for years past, some one _must_ have\ndiscovered the door and found the little oratory before her; but\ncommon-sense is sometimes less satisfactory than romance. Katy liked to\nthink that she was the first, and to \"make believe\" that no one else\nknew about it; so she did so, and invented legends about the place which\nAmy considered better than any fairy story.\n\nBefore he left them Lieutenant Worthington had a talk with his sister\nin the garden. She rather forced this talk upon him, for various\nthings were lying at her heart about which she longed for explanation;\nbut he yielded so easily to her wiles that it was evident he was not\naverse to the idea.\n\n\"Come, Polly, don't beat about the bush any longer,\" he said at last,\namused and a little irritated at her half-hints and little feminine\n_finesses_. \"I know what you want to ask; and as there's no use\nmaking a secret of it, I will take my turn in asking. Have I any chance,\ndo you think?\"\n\n\"Any chance?--about Katy, do you mean? Oh, Ned, you make me so happy.\"\n\n\"Yes; about her, of course.\"\n\n\"I don't see why you should say 'of course,'\" remarked his sister, with\nthe perversity of her sex, \"when it's only five or six weeks ago that I\nwas lying awake at night for fear you were being gobbled up by that\nLilly Page.\"\n\n\"There was a little risk of it,\" replied her brother, seriously. \"She's\nawfully pretty and she dances beautifully, and the other fellows were\nall wild about her, and--well, you know yourself how such things go. I\ncan't see now what it was that I fancied so much about her, I don't\nsuppose I could have told exactly at the time; but I can tell without\nthe smallest trouble what it is in--the other.\"\n\n\"In Katy? I should think so,\" cried Mrs. Ashe, emphatically; \"the two\nare no more to be compared than--than--well, bread and syllabub! You can\nlive on one, and you can't live on the other.\"\n\n\"Come, now, Miss Page isn't so bad as that. She is a nice girl enough,\nand a pretty girl too,--prettier than Katy; I'm not so far gone that I\ncan't see that. But we won't talk about her, she's not in the present\nquestion at all; very likely she'd have had nothing to say to me in any\ncase. I was only one out of a dozen, and she never gave me reason to\nsuppose that she cared more for me than the rest. Let us talk about this\nfriend of yours; have I any chance at all, do you think, Polly?\"\n\n\"Ned, you are the dearest boy! I would rather have Katy for a sister\nthan any one else I know. She's so nice all through,--so true and sweet\nand satisfactory.\"\n\n\"She is all that and more; she's a woman to tie to for life, to be\nperfectly sure of always. She would make a splendid wife for any man.\nI'm not half good enough for her; but the question is,--and you haven't\nanswered it yet, Polly,--what's my chance?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said his sister, slowly.\n\n\"Then I must ask herself, and I shall do so to-day.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" repeated Mrs. Ashe. \"'She is a woman, therefore to be\nwon:' and I don't think there is any one ahead of you; that is the best\nhope I have to offer, Ned. Katy never talks of such things; and though\nshe's so frank, I can't guess whether or not she ever thinks about them.\nShe likes you, however, I am sure of that. But, Ned, it will not be wise\nto say anything to her yet.\"\n\n\"Not say anything? Why not?\"\n\n\"No. Recollect that it is only a little while since she looked upon you\nas the admirer of another girl, and a girl she doesn't like very much,\nthough they are cousins. You must give her time to get over that\nimpression. Wait awhile; that's my advice, Ned.\"\n\n\"I'll wait any time if only she will say yes in the end. But it's hard\nto go away without a word of hope, and it's more like a man to speak\nout, it seems to me.\"\n\n\"It's too soon,\" persisted his sister. \"You don't want her to think\nyou a fickle fellow, falling in love with a fresh girl every time you\ngo into port, and falling out again when the ship sails. Sailors have\na bad reputation for that sort of thing. No woman cares to win a man\nlike that.\"\n\n\"Great Scott! I should think not! Do you mean to say that is the way my\nconduct appears to her, Polly?\"\n\n\"No, I don't mean just that; but wait, dear Ned, I am sure it is\nbetter.\"\n\nFortified by this sage counsel, Lieutenant Worthington went away next\nmorning, without saying anything to Katy in words, though perhaps eyes\nand tones may have been less discreet. He made them promise that some\none should send a letter every day about Amy; and as Mrs. Ashe\nfrequently devolved the writing of these bulletins upon Katy, and the\nreplies came in the shape of long letters, she found herself conducting\na pretty regular correspondence without quite intending it. Ned\nWorthington wrote particularly nice letters. He had the knack, more\noften found in women than men, of giving a picture with a few graphic\ntouches, and indicating what was droll or what was characteristic with\na single happy phrase. His letters grew to be one of Katy's pleasures;\nand sometimes, as Mrs. Ashe watched the color deepen in her cheeks\nwhile she read, her heart would bound hopefully within her. But she was\na wise woman in her way, and she wanted Katy for a sister very much; so\nshe never said a word or looked a look to startle or surprise her, but\nleft the thing to work itself out, which is the best course always in\nlove affairs.\n\nLittle Amy's improvement at Albano was something remarkable. Mrs. Swift\nwatched over her like a lynx. Her vigilance never relaxed. Amy was made\nto eat and sleep and walk and rest with the regularity of a machine; and\nthis exact system, combined with the good air, worked like a charm. The\nlittle one gained hour by hour. They could absolutely see her growing\nfat, her mother declared. Fevers, when they do not kill, operate\nsometimes as spring bonfires do in gardens, burning up all the refuse\nand leaving the soil free for the growth of fairer things; and Amy\npromised in time to be only the better and stronger for her hard\nexperience.\n\nShe had gained so much before the time came to start for Florence, that\nthey scarcely dreaded the journey; but it proved worse than their\nexpectations. They had not been able to secure a carriage to themselves,\nand were obliged to share their compartment with two English ladies, and\nthree Roman Catholic priests, one old, the others young. The older\npriest seemed to be a person of some consequence; for quite a number of\npeople came to see him off, and knelt for his blessing devoutly as the\ntrain moved away. The younger ones Katy guessed to be seminary students\nunder his charge. Her chief amusement through the long dusty journey was\nin watching the terrible time that one of these young men was having\nwith his own hat. It was a large three-cornered black affair, with sharp\nangles and excessively stiff; and a perpetual struggle seemed to be\ngoing on between it and its owner, who was evidently unhappy when it was\non his head and still more unhappy when it was anywhere else. If he\nperched it on his knees it was sure to slide away from him and fall with\na thump on the floor, whereupon he would pick it up, blushing furiously\nas he did so. Then he would lay it on the seat when the train stopped at\na station, and jump out with an air of relief; but he invariably forgot,\nand sat down upon it when he returned, and sprang up with a look of\nhorror at the loud crackle it made; after which he would tuck it into\nthe baggage-rack overhead, from which it would presently descend,\ngenerally into the lap of one of the staid English ladies, who would\nhand it back to him with an air of deep offence, remarking to her\ncompanion,--\n\n\"I never knew anything like it. Fancy! that makes four times that hat\nhas fallen on me. The young man is a feedgit! He's the most feegitty\ncreature I ever saw in my life.\"\n\nThe young _seminariat_ did not understand a word she said; but the\ntone needed no interpreter, and set him to blushing more painfully than\never. Altogether, the hat was never off his mind for a moment. Katy\ncould see that he was thinking about it, even when he was thumbing his\nBreviary and making believe to read.\n\nAt last the train, steaming down the valley of the Arno, revealed fair\nFlorence sitting among olive-clad hills, with Giotto's beautiful\nBell-tower, and the great, many-colored, soft-hued Cathedral, and the\nsquare tower of the old Palace, and the quaint bridges over the river,\nlooking exactly as they do in the photographs; and Katy would have felt\ndelighted, in spite of dust and fatigue, had not Amy looked so worn out\nand exhausted. They were seriously troubled about her, and for the\nmoment could think of nothing else. Happily the fatigue did no permanent\nharm, and a day or two of rest made her all right again. By good\nfortune, a nice little apartment in the modern quarter of the city had\nbeen vacated by its winter occupants the very day of their arrival, and\nMrs. Ashe secured it for a month, with all its conveniences and\nadvantages, including a maid named Maria, who had been servant to the\njust departed tenants.\n\nMaria was a very tall woman, at least six feet two, and had a splendid\ncontralto voice, which she occasionally exercised while busy over her\npots and pans. It was so remarkable to hear these grand arias and\nrecitatives proceeding from a kitchen some eight feet square, that Katy\nwas at great pains to satisfy her curiosity about it. By aid of the\ndictionary and much persistent questioning, she made out that Maria in\nher youth had received a partial training for the opera; but in the end\nit was decided that she was too big and heavy for the stage, and the\npoor \"giantess,\" as Amy named her, had been forced to abandon her\ncareer, and gradually had sunk to the position of a maid-of-all-work.\nKaty suspected that heaviness of mind as well as of body must have stood\nin her way; for Maria, though a good-natured giantess, was by no means\nquick of intelligence.\n\n\"I do think that the manner in which people over here can make homes for\nthemselves at five minutes' notice is perfectly delightful,\" cried Katy,\nat the end of their first day's housekeeping. \"I wish we could do the\nsame in America. How cosy it looks here already!\"\n\nIt was indeed cosy. Their new domain consisted of a parlor in a corner,\nfurnished in bright yellow brocade, with windows to south and west; a\nnice little dining-room; three bedrooms, with dimity-curtained beds; a\nsquare entrance hall, lighted at night by a tall slender brass lamp\nwhose double wicks were fed with olive oil; and the aforesaid tiny\nkitchen, behind which was a sleeping cubby, quite too small to be a good\nfit for the giantess. The rooms were full of conveniences,--easy-chairs,\nsofas, plenty of bureaus and dressing-tables, and corner fireplaces like\nFranklin stoves, in which odd little fires burned on cool days, made of\npine cones, cakes of pressed sawdust exactly like Boston brown bread cut\ninto slices, and a few sticks of wood thriftily adjusted, for fuel is\nworth its weight in gold in Florence. Katy's was the smallest of the\nbedrooms, but she liked it best of all for the reason that its one big\nwindow opened on an iron balcony over which grew a Banksia rose-vine\nwith a stem as thick as her wrist. It was covered just now with masses\nof tiny white blossoms, whose fragrance was inexpressibly delicious and\nmade every breath drawn in their neighborhood a delight. The sun\nstreamed in on all sides of the little apartment, which filled a\nnarrowing angle at the union of three streets; and from one window and\nanother, glimpses could be caught of the distant heights about the\ncity,--San Miniato in one direction, Bellosguardo in another, and for\nthe third the long olive-hung ascent of Fiesole, crowned by its gray\ncathedral towers.\n\nIt was astonishing how easily everything fell into train about the\nlittle establishment. Every morning at six the English baker left two\nsmall sweet brown loaves and a dozen rolls at the door. Then followed\nthe dairyman with a supply of tiny leaf-shaped pats of freshly churned\nbutter, a big flask of milk, and two small bottles of thick cream, with\na twist of vine leaf in each by way of a cork. Next came a _contadino_\nwith a flask of red Chianti wine, a film of oil floating on top to keep\nit sweet. People in Florence must drink wine, whether they like it or\nnot, because the lime-impregnated water is unsafe for use without some\nadmixture.\n\nDinner came from a _trattoria_, in a tin box, with a pan of coals inside\nto keep it warm, which box was carried on a man's head. It was furnished\nat a fixed price per day,--a soup, two dishes of meat, two vegetables,\nand a sweet dish; and the supply was so generous as always to leave\nsomething toward next day's luncheon. Salad, fruit, and fresh eggs Maria\nbought for them in the old market. From the confectioners came loaves of\n_pane santo_, a sort of light cake made with arrowroot instead of flour;\nand sometimes, by way of treat, a square of _pan forte da Siena_,\ncompounded of honey, almonds, and chocolate,--a mixture as pernicious\nas it is delicious, and which might take a medal anywhere for the sure\nproduction of nightmares.\n\nAmy soon learned to know the shops from which these delicacies came.\nShe had her favorites, too, among the strolling merchants who sold\noranges and those little sweet native figs, dried in the sun without\nsugar, which are among the specialties of Florence. They, in their\nturn, learned to know her and to watch for the appearance of her little\ncapped head and Mabel's blond wig at the window, lingering about till\nshe came, and advertising their wares with musical modulations, so\nappealing that Amy was always running to Katy, who acted as\nhousekeeper, to beg her to please buy this or that, \"because it is my\nold man, and he wants me to so much.\"\n\n\"But, chicken, we have plenty of figs for to-day.\"\n\n\"No matter; get some more, please do. I'll eat them all; really, I\nwill.\"\n\nAnd Amy was as good as her word. Her convalescent appetite was something\nprodigious.\n\nThere was another branch of shopping in which they all took equal\ndelight. The beauty and the cheapness of the Florence flowers are a\ncontinual surprise to a stranger. Every morning after breakfast an old\nman came creaking up the two long flights of stairs which led to Mrs.\nAshe's apartment, tapped at the door, and as soon as it opened, inserted\na shabby elbow and a large flat basket full of flowers. Such flowers!\nGreat masses of scarlet and cream-colored tulips, and white and gold\nnarcissus, knots of roses of all shades, carnations, heavy-headed trails\nof wistaria, wild hyacinths, violets, deep crimson and orange\nranunculus, _giglios_, or wild irises,--the Florence emblem, so deeply\npurple as to be almost black,--anemones, spring-beauties, faintly tinted\nwood-blooms tied in large loose nosegays, ivy, fruit\nblossoms,--everything that can be thought of that is fair and sweet.\nThese enticing wares the old man would tip out on the table. Mrs. Ashe\nand Katy would select what they wanted, and then the process of\nbargaining would begin, without which no sale is complete in Italy. The\nold man would name an enormous price, five times as much as he hoped to\nget. Katy would offer a very small one, considerably less than she\nexpected to give. The old man would dance with dismay, wring his hands,\nassure them that he should die of hunger and all his family with him if\nhe took less than the price named; he would then come down half a franc\nin his demand. So it would go on for five minutes, ten, sometimes for a\nquarter of an hour, the old man's price gradually descending, and Katy's\nterms very slowly going up, a cent or two at a time. Next the giantess\nwould mingle with the fray. She would bounce out of her kitchen, berate\nthe flower-vender, snatch up his flowers, declare that they smelt badly,\nfling them down again, pouring out all the while a voluble tirade of\nreproaches and revilings, and looking so enormous in her excitement that\nKaty wondered that the old man dared to answer her at all. Finally,\nthere would be a sudden lull. The old man would shrug his shoulders, and\nremarking that he and his wife and his aged grandmother must go without\nbread that day since it was the Signora's will, take the money offered\nand depart, leaving such a mass of flowers behind him that Katy would\nbegin to think that they had paid an unfair price for them and to feel a\nlittle rueful, till she observed that the old man was absolutely dancing\ndownstairs with rapture over the good bargain he had made, and that\nMaria was black with indignation over the extravagance of her ladies!\n\n\"The Americani are a nation of spend-thrifts,\" she would mutter to\nherself, as she quickened the charcoal in her droll little range by\nfanning it with a palm-leaf fan; \"they squander money like water. Well,\nall the better for us Italians!\" with a shrug of her shoulders.\n\n\"But, Maria, it was only sixteen cents that we paid, and look at those\nflowers! There are at least half a bushel of them.\"\n\n\"Sixteen cents for garbage like that! The Signorina would better let me\nmake her bargains for her. _Gi\u00c3\u00a0! Gi\u00c3\u00a0!_ No Italian lady would have paid\nmore than eleven sous for such useless _roba_. It is evident that the\nSignorina's countrymen eat gold when at home, they think so little of\ncasting it away!\"\n\nAltogether, what with the comfort and quiet of this little home, the\nnumberless delightful things that there were to do and to see, and\nViessieux's great library, from which they could draw books at will\nto make the doing and seeing more intelligible, the month at\nFlorence passed only too quickly, and was one of the times to which\nthey afterward looked back with most pleasure. Amy grew steadily\nstronger, and the freedom from anxiety about her after their long\nstrain of apprehension was restful and healing beyond expression to\nboth mind and body.\n\nTheir very last excursion of all, and one of the pleasantest, was to the\nold amphitheatre at Fiesole; and it was while they sat there in the soft\nglow of the late afternoon, tying into bunches the violets which they\nhad gathered from under walls whose foundations antedate Rome itself,\nthat a cheery call sounded from above, and an unexpected surprise\ndescended upon them in the shape of Lieutenant Worthington, who having\nsecured another fifteen days' furlough, had come to take his sister on\nto Venice.\n\n\"I didn't write you that I had applied for leave,\" he explained,\n\"because there seemed so little chance of my getting off again so soon;\nbut as luck had it, Carruthers, whose turn it was, sprained his ankle\nand was laid up, and the Commodore let us exchange. I made all the\ncapital I could out of Amy's fever; but upon my word, I felt like a\nhumbug when I came upon her and Mrs. Swift in the Cascine just now, as I\nwas hunting for you. How she has picked up! I should never have known\nher for the same child.\"\n\n\"Yes, she seems perfectly well again, and as strong as before she had\nthe fever, though that dear old Goody Swift is just as careful of her as\never. She would not let us bring her here this afternoon, for fear we\nshould stay out till the dew fell. Ned, it is perfectly delightful that\nyou were able to come. It makes going to Venice seem quite a different\nthing, doesn't it, Katy?\"\n\n\"I don't want it to seem quite different, because going to Venice was\nalways one of my dreams,\" replied Katy, with a little laugh.\n\n\"I hope at least it doesn't make it seem less pleasant,\" said Mr.\nWorthington, as his sister stopped to pick a violet.\n\n\"No, indeed, I am glad,\" said Katy; \"we shall all be seeing it for\nthe first time, too, shall we not? I think you said you had never\nbeen there.\" She spoke simply and frankly, but she was conscious of\nan odd shyness.\n\n\"I simply couldn't stand it any longer,\" Ned Worthington confided to his\nsister when they were alone. \"My head is so full of her that I can't\nattend to my work, and it came to me all of a sudden that this might be\nmy last chance. You'll be getting north before long, you know, to\nSwitzerland and so on, where I cannot follow you. So I made a clean\nbreast of it to the Commodore; and the good old fellow, who has a soft\nspot in his heart for a love-story, behaved like a brick, and made it\nall straight for me to come away.\"\n\nMrs. Ashe did not join in these commendations of the Commodore; her\nattention was fixed on another part of her brother's discourse.\n\n\"Then you won't be able to come to me again? I sha'n't see you again\nafter this!\" she exclaimed. \"Dear me! I never realized that before. What\nshall I do without you?\"\n\n\"You will have Miss Carr. She is a host in herself,\" suggested Ned\nWorthington. His sister shook her head.\n\n\"Katy is a jewel,\" she remarked presently; \"but somehow one wants a man\nto call upon. I shall feel lost without you, Ned.\"\n\nThe month's housekeeping wound up that night with a \"thick tea\" in honor\nof Lieutenant Worthington's arrival, which taxed all the resources of\nthe little establishment. Maria was sent out hastily to buy _pan forte\nda Siena_ and _vino d'Asti_, and fresh eggs for an omelette, and\nchickens' breasts smothered in cream from the restaurant, and artichokes\nfor a salad, and flowers to garnish all; and the guest ate and praised\nand admired; and Amy and Mabel sat on his knee and explained everything\nto him, and they were all very happy together. Their merriment was so\ninfectious that it extended to the poor giantess, who had been very\npensive all day at the prospect of losing her good place, and who now\nraised her voice in the grand aria from \"Orfeo,\" and made the kitchen\nring with the passionate demand \"Che far\u00c3\u00b2 senza Eurydice?\" The splendid\nnotes, full of fire and lamentation, rang out across the saucepans as\neffectively as if they had been footlights; and Katy, rising softly,\nopened the kitchen door a little way that they might not lose a sound.\n\nThe next day brought them to Venice. It was a \"moment,\" indeed, as Katy\nseated herself for the first time in a gondola, and looked from beneath\nits black hood at the palace walls on the Grand Canal, past which they\nwere gliding. Some were creamy white and black, some orange-tawny,\nothers of a dull delicious ruddy color, half pink, half red; but all, in\nbuild and ornament, were unlike palaces elsewhere. High on the prow\nbefore her stood the gondolier, his form defined in dark outline against\nthe sky, as he swayed and bent to his long oar, raising his head now and\nagain to give a wild musical cry, as warning to other approaching\ngondolas. It was all like a dream. Ned Worthington sat beside her,\nlooking more at the changes in her expressive face than at the palaces.\nVenice was as new to him as to Katy; but she was a new feature in his\nlife also, and even more interesting than Venice. They seemed to float\non pleasures for the next ten days. Their arrival had been happily timed\nto coincide with a great popular festival which for nearly a week kept\nVenice in a state of continual brilliant gala. All the days were spent\non the water, only landing now and then to look at some famous building\nor picture, or to eat ices in the Piazza with the lovely fa\u00c3\u00a7ade of St.\nMark's before them. Dining or sleeping seemed a sheer waste of time! The\nevenings were spent on the water too; for every night, immediately after\nsunset, a beautiful drifting pageant started from the front of the\nDoge's Palace to make the tour of the Grand Canal, and our friends\nalways took a part in it. In its centre went a barge hung with\nembroideries and filled with orange trees and musicians. This was\nsurrounded by a great convoy of skiffs and gondolas bearing colored\nlanterns and pennons and gay awnings, and managed by gondoliers in\npicturesque uniforms. All these floated and shifted and swept on\ntogether with a sort of rhythmic undulation as if keeping time to the\nmusic, while across their path dazzling showers and arches of colored\nfire poured from the palace fronts and the hotels. Every movement of the\nfairy flotilla was repeated in the illuminated water, every torch-tip\nand scarlet lantern and flake of green or rosy fire; above all the\nbright full moon looked down as if surprised. It was magically beautiful\nin effect. Katy felt as if her previous sober ideas about life and\nthings had melted away. For the moment the world was turned topsy-turvy.\nThere was nothing hard or real or sordid left in it; it was just a fairy\ntale, and she was in the middle of it as she had longed to be in her\nchildhood. She was the Princess, encircled by delights, as when she and\nClover and Elsie played in \"Paradise,\"--only, this was better; and, dear\nme! who was this Prince who seemed to belong to the story and to grow\nmore important to it every day?\n\nFairy tales must come to ending. Katy's last chapter closed with a\nsudden turn-over of the leaf when, toward the end of this happy\nfortnight, Mrs. Ashe came into her room with the face of one who has\nunpleasant news to communicate.\n\n\"Katy,\" she began, \"should you be _awfully_ disappointed, should\nyou consider me a perfect wretch, if I went home now instead of in\nthe autumn?\"\n\nKaty was too much astonished to reply.\n\n\"I am grown such a coward, I am so knocked up and weakened by what I\nsuffered in Rome, that I find I cannot face the idea of going on to\nGermany and Switzerland alone, without Ned to take care of me. You are a\nperfect angel, dear, and I know that you would do all you could to make\nit easy for me, but I am such a fool that I do not dare. I think my\nnerves must have given way,\" she continued half tearfully; \"but the very\nidea of shifting for myself for five months longer makes me so miserably\nhomesick that I cannot endure it. I dare say I shall repent afterward,\nand I tell myself now how silly it is; but it's no use,--I shall never\nknow another easy moment till I have Amy safe again in America and under\nyour father's care.\"\n\n\"I find,\" she continued after another little pause, \"that we can go down\nwith Ned to Genoa and take a steamer there which will carry us straight\nto New York without any stops. I hate to disappoint you dreadfully,\nKaty, but I have almost decided to do it. Shall you mind very much? Can\nyou ever forgive me?\" She was fairly crying now.\n\nKaty had to swallow hard before she could answer, the sense of\ndisappointment was so sharp; and with all her efforts there was almost a\nsob in her voice as she said,--\n\n\"Why yes, indeed, dear Polly, there is nothing to forgive. You are\nperfectly right to go home if you feel so.\" Then with another swallow\nshe added: \"You have given me the loveliest six months' treat that ever\nwas, and I should be a greedy girl indeed if I found fault because it is\ncut off a little sooner than we expected.\"\n\n\"You are so dear and good not to be vexed,\" said her friend, embracing\nher. \"It makes me feel doubly sorry about disappointing you. Indeed I\nwouldn't if I could help it, but I simply can't. I _must_ go home.\nPerhaps we'll come back some day when Amy is grown up, or safely married\nto somebody who will take good care of her!\"\n\nThis distant prospect was but a poor consolation for the immediate\ndisappointment. The more Katy thought about it the sorrier did she feel.\nIt was not only losing the chance--very likely the only one she would\never have--of seeing Switzerland and Germany; it was all sorts of other\nlittle things besides. They must go home in a strange ship with a\ncaptain they did not know, instead of in the \"Spartacus,\" as they had\nplanned; and they should land in New York, where no one would be waiting\nfor them, and not have the fun of sailing into Boston Bay and seeing\nRose on the wharf, where she had promised to be. Furthermore, they must\npass the hot summer in Burnet instead of in the cool Alpine valleys; and\nPolly's house was let till October. She and Amy would have to shift for\nthemselves elsewhere. Perhaps they would not be in Burnet at all. Oh\ndear, what a pity it was! what a dreadful pity!\n\nThen, the first shock of surprise and discomfiture over, other ideas\nasserted themselves; and as she realized that in three weeks more, or\nfour at the longest, she was to see papa and Clover and all her dear\npeople at home, she began to feel so very glad that she could hardly\nwait for the time to come. After all, there was nothing in Europe quite\nso good as that.\n\n\"No, I'm not sorry,\" she told herself; \"I am glad. Poor Polly! it's no\nwonder she feels nervous after all she has gone through. I hope I wasn't\ncross to her! And it will be _very_ nice to have Lieutenant Worthington\nto take care of us as far as Genoa.\"\n\nThe next three days were full of work. There was no more floating in\ngondolas, except in the way of business. All the shopping which they had\nput off must be done, and the trunks packed for the voyage. Every one\nrecollected last errands and commissions; there was continual coming and\ngoing and confusion, and Amy, wild with excitement, popping up every\nother moment in the midst of it all, to demand of everybody if they were\nnot glad that they were going back to America.\n\nKaty had never yet bought her gift from old Mrs. Redding. She had\nwaited, thinking continually that she should see something more tempting\nstill in the next place they went to; but now, with the sense that there\nwere to be no more \"next places,\" she resolved to wait no longer, and\nwith a hundred francs in her pocket, set forth to choose something from\namong the many tempting things for sale in the Piazza. A bracelet of old\nRoman coins had caught her fancy one day in a bric-\u00c3\u00a0-brac shop, and she\nwalked straight toward it, only pausing by the way to buy a pale blue\niridescent pitcher at Salviate's for Cecy Slack, and see it carefully\nrolled in seaweed and soft paper.\n\nThe price of the bracelet was a little more than she expected, and quite\na long process of bargaining was necessary to reduce it to the sum she\nhad to spend. She had just succeeded and was counting out the money when\nMrs. Ashe and her brother appeared, having spied her from the opposite\nside of the Piazza, where they were choosing last photographs at Naga's.\nKaty showed her purchase and explained that it was a present; \"for of\ncourse I should never walk out in cold blood and buy a bracelet for\nmyself,\" she said with a laugh.\n\n\"This is a fascinating little shop,\" said Mrs. Ashe. \"I wonder\nwhat is the price of that queer old chatelaine with the bottles\nhanging from it.\"\n\nThe price was high; but Mrs. Ashe was now tolerably conversant with\nshopping Italian, which consists chiefly of a few words repeated many\ntimes over, and it lowered rapidly under the influence of her _troppo's_\nand _\u00c3\u00a8 molto caro's_, accompanied with telling little shrugs and looks\nof surprise. In the end she bought it for less than two thirds of what\nhad been originally asked for it. As she put the parcel in her pocket,\nher brother said,--\n\n\"If you have done your shopping now, Polly, can't you come out for a\nlast row?\"\n\n\"Katy may, but I can't,\" replied Mrs. Ashe. \"The man promised to bring\nme gloves at six o'clock, and I must be there to pay for them. Take\nher down to the Lido, Ned. It's an exquisite evening for the water,\nand the sunset promises to be delicious. You can take the time, can't\nyou, Katy?\"\n\nKaty could.\n\nMrs. Ashe turned to leave them, but suddenly stopped short.\n\n\"Katy, look! Isn't that a picture!\"\n\nThe \"picture\" was Amy, who had come to the Piazza with Mrs. Swift, to\nfeed the doves of St. Mark's, which was one of her favorite amusements.\nThese pretty birds are the pets of all Venice, and so accustomed to\nbeing fondled and made much of by strangers, that they are perfectly\ntame. Amy, when her mother caught sight of her, was sitting on the\nmarble pavement, with one on her shoulder, two perched on the edge of\nher lap, which was full of crumbs, and a flight of others circling round\nher head. She was looking up and calling them in soft tones. The\nsunlight caught the little downy curls on her head and made them\nglitter. The flying doves lit on the pavement, and crowded round her,\ntheir pearl and gray and rose-tinted and white feathers, their scarlet\nfeet and gold-ringed eyes, making a shifting confusion of colors, as\nthey hopped and fluttered and cooed about the little maid, unstartled\neven by her clear laughter. Close by stood Nurse Swift, observant and\ngrimly pleased.\n\nThe mother looked on with happy tears in her eyes. \"Oh, Katy, think\nwhat she was a few weeks ago and look at her now! Can I ever be\nthankful enough?\"\n\nShe squeezed Katy's hand convulsively and walked away, turning her head\nnow and then for another glance at Amy and the doves; while Ned and Katy\nsilently crossed to the landing and got into a gondola. It was the\nperfection of a Venice evening, with silver waves lapsing and lulling\nunder a rose and opal sky; and the sense that it was their last row on\nthose enchanted waters made every moment seem doubly precious.\n\nI cannot tell you exactly what it was that Ned Worthington said to Katy\nduring that row, or why it took so long to say it that they did not get\nin till after the sun was set, and the stars had come out to peep at\ntheir bright, glinting faces, reflected in the Grand Canal. In fact, no\none can tell; for no one overheard, except Giacomo, the brown\nyellow-jacketed gondolier, and as he did not understand a word of\nEnglish he could not repeat the conversation. Venetian boatmen, however,\nknow pretty well what it means when a gentleman and lady, both young,\nfind so much to say in low tones to each other under the gondola hood,\nand are so long about giving the order to return; and Giacomo, deeply\nsympathetic, rowed as softly and made himself as imperceptible as he\ncould,--a display of tact which merited the big silver piece with which\nLieutenant Worthington \"crossed his palm\" on landing.\n\nMrs. Ashe had begun to look for them long before they appeared, but I\nthink she was neither surprised nor sorry that they were so late. Katy\nkissed her hastily and went away at once,--\"to pack,\" she said,--and\nNed was equally undemonstrative; but they looked so happy, both of them,\nthat \"Polly dear\" was quite satisfied and asked no questions.\n\nFive days later the parting came, when the \"Florio\" steamer put into the\nport of Genoa for passengers. It was not an easy good-by to say. Mrs.\nAshe and Amy both cried, and Mabel was said to be in deep affliction\nalso. But there were alleviations. The squadron was coming home in the\nautumn, and the officers would have leave to see their friends, and of\ncourse Lieutenant Worthington must come to Burnet--to visit his sister.\nFive months would soon go, he declared; but for all the cheerful\nassurance, his face was rueful enough as he held Katy's hand in a long\ntight clasp while the little boat waited to take him ashore.\n\nAfter that it was just a waiting to be got through with till they\nsighted Sandy Hook and the Neversinks,--a waiting varied with peeps at\nMarseilles and Gibraltar and the sight of a whale or two and one distant\niceberg. The weather was fair all the way, and the ocean smooth. Amy was\nnever weary of lamenting her own stupidity in not having taken Maria\nMatilda out of confinement before they left Venice.\n\n\"That child has hardly been out of the trunk since we started,\" she\nsaid. \"She hasn't seen anything except a little bit of Nice. I shall\nreally be ashamed when the other children ask her about it. I think I\nshall play that she was left at boarding-school and didn't come to\nEurope at all! Don't you think that would be the best way, mamma?\"\n\n\"You might play that she was left in the States-prison for having done\nsomething naughty,\" suggested Katy; but Amy scouted this idea.\n\n\"She never does naughty things,\" she said, \"because she never does\nanything at all. She's just stupid, poor child! It's not her fault.\"\n\nThe thirty-six hours between New York and Burnet seemed longer than all\nthe rest of the journey put together, Katy thought. But they ended at\nlast, as the \"Lake Queen\" swung to her moorings at the familiar wharf,\nwhere Dr. Carr stood surrounded with all his boys and girls just as they\nhad stood the previous October, only that now there were no clouds on\nanybody's face, and Johnnie was skipping up and down for joy instead of\ngrief. It was a long moment while the plank was being lowered from the\ngangway; but the moment it was in place, Katy darted across, first\nashore of all the passengers, and was in her father's arms.\n\nMrs. Ashe and Amy spent two or three days with them, while looking up\ntemporary quarters elsewhere; and so long as they stayed all seemed a\nhappy confusion of talking and embracing and exclaiming, and\ndistributing of gifts. After they went away things fell into their\ncustomary train, and a certain flatness became apparent. Everything had\nhappened that could happen. The long-talked-of European journey was\nover. Here was Katy at home again, months sooner than they expected; yet\nshe looked remarkably cheerful and content! Clover could not understand\nit; she was likewise puzzled to account for one or two private\nconversations between Katy and papa in which she had not been invited to\ntake part, and the occasional arrival of a letter from \"foreign parts\"\nabout whose contents nothing was said.\n\n\"It seems a dreadful pity that you had to come so soon,\" she said one\nday when they were alone in their bedroom. \"It's delightful to have you,\nof course; but we had braced ourselves to do without you till October,\nand there are such lots of delightful things that you could have been\ndoing and seeing at this moment.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, indeed,\" replied Katy, but not at all as if she were\nparticularly disappointed.\n\n\"Katy Carr, I don't understand you,\" persisted Clover. \"Why don't you\nfeel worse about it? Here you have lost five months of the most\nsplendid time you ever had, and you don't seem to mind it a bit! Why,\nif I were in your place my heart would be perfectly broken. And you\nneedn't have come, either; that's the worst of it. It was just a whim\nof Polly's. Papa says Amy might have stayed as well as not. Why aren't\nyou sorrier, Katy?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know. Perhaps because I had so much as it was,--enough to\nlast all my life, I think, though I _should_ like to go again. You can't\nimagine what beautiful pictures are put away in my memory.\"\n\n\"I don't see that you had so awfully much,\" said the aggravated Clover;\n\"you were there only a little more than six months,--for I don't count\nthe sea,--and ever so much of that time was taken up with nursing Amy.\nYou can't have any pleasant pictures of _that_ part of it.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have, some.\"\n\n\"Well, I should really like to know what. There you were in a dark room,\nfrightened to death and tired to death, with only Mrs. Ashe and the old\nnurse to keep you company--Oh, yes, that brother was there part of the\ntime; I forgot him--\"\n\nClover stopped short in sudden amazement. Katy was standing with her\nback toward her, smoothing her hair, but her face was reflected in the\nglass. At Clover's words a sudden deep flush had mounted in Katy's\ncheeks. Deeper and deeper it burned as she became conscious of Clover's\nastonished gaze, till even the back of her neck was pink. Then, as if\nshe could not bear it any longer, she put the brush down, turned, and\nfled out of the room; while Clover, looking after her, exclaimed in a\ntone of sudden comical dismay,--\n\n\"What does it mean? Oh, dear me! is that what Katy is going to do next?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of What Katy Did Next, by Susan Coolidge\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK WHAT KATY DID NEXT ***\n\n***** This file should be named 8995-8.txt or 8995-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/8\/9\/9\/8995\/\n\nProduced by Juliet Sutherland, Suzanne L.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":661,"split":"train"}
