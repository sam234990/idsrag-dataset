Not only has he condemned Maria to live in an insane asylum, but he has also taken their child away from her. She manages to befriend one of her attendants in the asylum, an impoverished, lower-class woman named Jemima, who, after realizing that Maria is not mad, agrees to bring her a few books. Some of these have notes scribbled in them by Henry Darnford, another inmate, and Maria falls in love with him via his marginalia. The two begin to communicate and eventually meet. Darnford reveals that he has had a debauched life; waking up in the asylum after a night of heavy drinking, he has been unable to convince the doctors to release him.\nJemima tells her life story to Maria and Darnford, explaining that she was born a bastard. Jemima's mother died while she was still an infant, making her already precarious social position worse. She was therefore forced to become a servant in her father's house and later bound out as an apprentice to a master who beat her, starved her, and raped her. When the man's wife discovers that Jemima is pregnant with his child, she is thrown out of the house. Unable to support herself, she aborts her child and becomes a prostitute. She becomes the kept woman of a man of some wealth who seems obsessed with pleasure of every kind: food, love, etc. After the death of the gentleman keeping her, she becomes an attendant at the asylum where Maria is imprisoned.\nIn chapters seven through fourteen (about half of the completed manuscript), Maria relates her own life story in a narrative she has written for her daughter. She explains how her mother and father loved their eldest son, Robert, more than their other children and how he ruled \"despotically\" over his siblings. To escape her unhappy home, Maria visited that of a neighbor and fell in love with his son, George Venables. Venables presented himself to everyone as a respectable and honorable young man; in actuality, he was a libertine. Maria's family life became untenable when her mother died and her father took the housekeeper as his mistress. A rich uncle who was fond of Maria, unaware of Venables' true character, arranged a marriage for her and gave her a dowry of \u00c2\u01415,000.\nMaria quickly learned of her husband's true character. She tried to ignore him by cultivating a greater appreciation for literature and the arts, but he became increasingly dissolute: he whored, gambled, and bankrupted the couple. Maria soon became pregnant after unwanted sexual encounters with her husband. As Maria's uncle is leaving for the continent, he warns Maria of the consequences should she leave her husband. This is the first that separation or divorce are discussed in the novel and Maria seems to take his words as inspiration rather than the warning they are meant to be. After Venables attempts to pay one of his friends to seduce Maria (a man referred to only as 'Mr. S') so that he can leave her for being an adulteress, Maria tries to leave him. She initially escapes and manages to live in several different locations, often with other women who have also been wronged by their husbands, but he always finds her. When she tries to leave England with her newborn child and the fortune her now deceased uncle has left them, her husband seizes the child and imprisons Maria in the asylum.

Godwin\n\nAuthor's Preface\n\nMaria\n\n\n\n\nMARIA\n\nor\n\nThe Wrongs of Woman\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE\n\nTHE PUBLIC are here presented with the last literary attempt of an\nauthor, whose fame has been uncommonly extensive, and whose talents have\nprobably been most admired, by the persons by whom talents are estimated\nwith the greatest accuracy and discrimination. There are few, to whom\nher writings could in any case have given pleasure, that would have\nwished that this fragment should have been suppressed, because it is\na fragment. There is a sentiment, very dear to minds of taste and\nimagination, that finds a melancholy delight in contemplating these\nunfinished productions of genius, these sketches of what, if they had\nbeen filled up in a manner adequate to the writer's conception, would\nperhaps have given a new impulse to the manners of a world.\n\nThe purpose and structure of the following work, had long formed a\nfavourite subject of meditation with its author, and she judged them\ncapable of producing an important effect. The composition had been in\nprogress for a period of twelve months. She was anxious to do justice\nto her conception, and recommenced and revised the manuscript several\ndifferent times. So much of it as is here given to the public, she was\nfar from considering as finished, and, in a letter to a friend directly\nwritten on this subject, she says, \"I am perfectly aware that some of\nthe incidents ought to be transposed, and heightened by more harmonious\nshading; and I wished in some degree to avail myself of criticism,\nbefore I began to adjust my events into a story, the outline of which\nI had sketched in my mind.\"* The only friends to whom the author\ncommunicated her manuscript, were Mr. Dyson, the translator of the\nSorcerer, and the present editor; and it was impossible for the most\ninexperienced author to display a stronger desire of profiting by the\ncensures and sentiments that might be suggested.**\n\n     * A more copious extract of this letter is subjoined to the\n     author's preface.\n\n     ** The part communicated consisted of the first fourteen\n     chapters.\n\nIn revising these sheets for the press, it was necessary for the editor,\nin some places, to connect the more finished parts with the pages of an\nolder copy, and a line or two in addition sometimes appeared requisite\nfor that purpose. Wherever such a liberty has been taken, the additional\nphrases will be found inclosed in brackets; it being the editor's most\nearnest desire to intrude nothing of himself into the work, but to give\nto the public the words, as well as ideas, of the real author.\n\nWhat follows in the ensuing pages, is not a preface regularly drawn\nout by the author, but merely hints for a preface, which, though never\nfilled up in the manner the writer intended, appeared to be worth\npreserving.\n\nW. GODWIN.\n\n\n\n\nAUTHOR'S PREFACE\n\nTHE WRONGS OF WOMAN, like the wrongs of the oppressed part of mankind,\nmay be deemed necessary by their oppressors: but surely there are a few,\nwho will dare to advance before the improvement of the age, and grant\nthat my sketches are not the abortion of a distempered fancy, or the\nstrong delineations of a wounded heart.\n\nIn writing this novel, I have rather endeavoured to pourtray passions\nthan manners.\n\nIn many instances I could have made the incidents more dramatic, would I\nhave sacrificed my main object, the desire of exhibiting the misery and\noppression, peculiar to women, that arise out of the partial laws and\ncustoms of society.\n\nIn the invention of the story, this view restrained my fancy; and\nthe history ought rather to be considered, as of woman, than of an\nindividual.\n\nThe sentiments I have embodied.\n\nIn many works of this species, the hero is allowed to be mortal, and\nto become wise and virtuous as well as happy, by a train of events and\ncircumstances. The heroines, on the contrary, are to be born immaculate,\nand to act like goddesses of wisdom, just come forth highly finished\nMinervas from the head of Jove.\n\n[The following is an extract of a letter from the author to a friend, to\nwhom she communicated her manuscript.]\n\nFor my part, I cannot suppose any situation more distressing, than for a\nwoman of sensibility, with an improving mind, to be bound to such a man\nas I have described for life; obliged to renounce all the humanizing\naffections, and to avoid cultivating her taste, lest her perception of\ngrace and refinement of sentiment, should sharpen to agony the pangs of\ndisappointment. Love, in which the imagination mingles its bewitching\ncolouring, must be fostered by delicacy. I should despise, or rather\ncall her an ordinary woman, who could endure such a husband as I have\nsketched.\n\nThese appear to me (matrimonial despotism of heart and conduct) to be\nthe peculiar Wrongs of Woman, because they degrade the mind. What are\ntermed great misfortunes, may more forcibly impress the mind of common\nreaders; they have more of what may justly be termed stage-effect;\nbut it is the delineation of finer sensations, which, in my opinion,\nconstitutes the merit of our best novels. This is what I have in\nview; and to show the wrongs of different classes of women, equally\noppressive, though, from the difference of education, necessarily\nvarious.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\n\nABODES OF HORROR have frequently been described, and castles, filled\nwith spectres and chimeras, conjured up by the magic spell of genius\nto harrow the soul, and absorb the wondering mind. But, formed of such\nstuff as dreams are made of, what were they to the mansion of despair,\nin one corner of which Maria sat, endeavouring to recall her scattered\nthoughts!\n\nSurprise, astonishment, that bordered on distraction, seemed to have\nsuspended her faculties, till, waking by degrees to a keen sense of\nanguish, a whirlwind of rage and indignation roused her torpid pulse.\nOne recollection with frightful velocity following another, threatened\nto fire her brain, and make her a fit companion for the terrific\ninhabitants, whose groans and shrieks were no unsubstantial sounds of\nwhistling winds, or startled birds, modulated by a romantic fancy, which\namuse while they affright; but such tones of misery as carry a dreadful\ncertainty directly to the heart. What effect must they then have\nproduced on one, true to the touch of sympathy, and tortured by maternal\napprehension!\n\nHer infant's image was continually floating on Maria's sight, and the\nfirst smile of intelligence remembered, as none but a mother, an unhappy\nmother, can conceive. She heard her half speaking half cooing, and felt\nthe little twinkling fingers on her burning bosom--a bosom bursting\nwith the nutriment for which this cherished child might now be pining\nin vain. From a stranger she could indeed receive the maternal aliment,\nMaria was grieved at the thought--but who would watch her with a\nmother's tenderness, a mother's self-denial?\n\nThe retreating shadows of former sorrows rushed back in a gloomy train,\nand seemed to be pictured on the walls of her prison, magnified by\nthe state of mind in which they were viewed--Still she mourned for her\nchild, lamented she was a daughter, and anticipated the aggravated ills\nof life that her sex rendered almost inevitable, even while dreading she\nwas no more. To think that she was blotted out of existence was agony,\nwhen the imagination had been long employed to expand her faculties;\nyet to suppose her turned adrift on an unknown sea, was scarcely less\nafflicting.\n\nAfter being two days the prey of impetuous, varying emotions, Maria\nbegan to reflect more calmly on her present situation, for she had\nactually been rendered incapable of sober reflection, by the discovery\nof the act of atrocity of which she was the victim. She could not\nhave imagined, that, in all the fermentation of civilized depravity, a\nsimilar plot could have entered a human mind. She had been stunned by\nan unexpected blow; yet life, however joyless, was not to be indolently\nresigned, or misery endured without exertion, and proudly termed\npatience. She had hitherto meditated only to point the dart of anguish,\nand suppressed the heart heavings of indignant nature merely by the\nforce of contempt. Now she endeavoured to brace her mind to fortitude,\nand to ask herself what was to be her employment in her dreary cell? Was\nit not to effect her escape, to fly to the succour of her child, and to\nbaffle the selfish schemes of her tyrant--her husband?\n\nThese thoughts roused her sleeping spirit, and the self-possession\nreturned, that seemed to have abandoned her in the infernal solitude\ninto which she had been precipitated. The first emotions of overwhelming\nimpatience began to subside, and resentment gave place to tenderness,\nand more tranquil meditation; though anger once more stopt the calm\ncurrent of reflection when she attempted to move her manacled arms. But\nthis was an outrage that could only excite momentary feelings of scorn,\nwhich evaporated in a faint smile; for Maria was far from thinking\na personal insult the most difficult to endure with magnanimous\nindifference.\n\nShe approached the small grated window of her chamber, and for a\nconsiderable time only regarded the blue expanse; though it commanded\na view of a desolate garden, and of part of a huge pile of buildings,\nthat, after having been suffered, for half a century, to fall to decay,\nhad undergone some clumsy repairs, merely to render it habitable. The\nivy had been torn off the turrets, and the stones not wanted to patch up\nthe breaches of time, and exclude the warring elements, left in heaps\nin the disordered court. Maria contemplated this scene she knew not how\nlong; or rather gazed on the walls, and pondered on her situation.\nTo the master of this most horrid of prisons, she had, soon after her\nentrance, raved of injustice, in accents that would have justified his\ntreatment, had not a malignant smile, when she appealed to his judgment,\nwith a dreadful conviction stifled her remonstrating complaints. By\nforce, or openly, what could be done? But surely some expedient might\noccur to an active mind, without any other employment, and possessed of\nsufficient resolution to put the risk of life into the balance with the\nchance of freedom.\n\nA woman entered in the midst of these reflections, with a firm,\ndeliberate step, strongly marked features, and large black eyes, which\nshe fixed steadily on Maria's, as if she designed to intimidate her,\nsaying at the same time \"You had better sit down and eat your dinner,\nthan look at the clouds.\"\n\n\"I have no appetite,\" replied Maria, who had previously determined to\nspeak mildly; \"why then should I eat?\"\n\n\"But, in spite of that, you must and shall eat something. I have had\nmany ladies under my care, who have resolved to starve themselves;\nbut, soon or late, they gave up their intent, as they recovered their\nsenses.\"\n\n\"Do you really think me mad?\" asked Maria, meeting the searching glance\nof her eye.\n\n\"Not just now. But what does that prove?--Only that you must be the more\ncarefully watched, for appearing at times so reasonable. You have\nnot touched a morsel since you entered the house.\"--Maria sighed\nintelligibly.--\"Could any thing but madness produce such a disgust for\nfood?\"\n\n\"Yes, grief; you would not ask the question if you knew what it was.\"\nThe attendant shook her head; and a ghastly smile of desperate fortitude\nserved as a forcible reply, and made Maria pause, before she added--\"Yet\nI will take some refreshment: I mean not to die.--No; I will preserve\nmy senses; and convince even you, sooner than you are aware of, that my\nintellects have never been disturbed, though the exertion of them may\nhave been suspended by some infernal drug.\"\n\nDoubt gathered still thicker on the brow of her guard, as she attempted\nto convict her of mistake.\n\n\"Have patience!\" exclaimed Maria, with a solemnity that inspired awe.\n\"My God! how have I been schooled into the practice!\" A suffocation of\nvoice betrayed the agonizing emotions she was labouring to keep down;\nand conquering a qualm of disgust, she calmly endeavoured to eat enough\nto prove her docility, perpetually turning to the suspicious female,\nwhose observation she courted, while she was making the bed and\nadjusting the room.\n\n\"Come to me often,\" said Maria, with a tone of persuasion, in\nconsequence of a vague plan that she had hastily adopted, when, after\nsurveying this woman's form and features, she felt convinced that she\nhad an understanding above the common standard, \"and believe me mad,\ntill you are obliged to acknowledge the contrary.\" The woman was no\nfool, that is, she was superior to her class; nor had misery quite\npetrified the life's-blood of humanity, to which reflections on our own\nmisfortunes only give a more orderly course. The manner, rather than the\nexpostulations, of Maria made a slight suspicion dart into her mind with\ncorresponding sympathy, which various other avocations, and the habit\nof banishing compunction, prevented her, for the present, from examining\nmore minutely.\n\nBut when she was told that no person, excepting the physician appointed\nby her family, was to be permitted to see the lady at the end of the\ngallery, she opened her keen eyes still wider, and uttered a--\"hem!\"\nbefore she enquired--\"Why?\" She was briefly told, in reply, that the\nmalady was hereditary, and the fits not occurring but at very long and\nirregular intervals, she must be carefully watched; for the length\nof these lucid periods only rendered her more mischievous, when any\nvexation or caprice brought on the paroxysm of phrensy.\n\nHad her master trusted her, it is probable that neither pity nor\ncuriosity would have made her swerve from the straight line of her\ninterest; for she had suffered too much in her intercourse with\nmankind, not to determine to look for support, rather to humouring\ntheir passions, than courting their approbation by the integrity of her\nconduct. A deadly blight had met her at the very threshold of existence;\nand the wretchedness of her mother seemed a heavy weight fastened on her\ninnocent neck, to drag her down to perdition. She could not heroically\ndetermine to succour an unfortunate; but, offended at the bare\nsupposition that she could be deceived with the same ease as a common\nservant, she no longer curbed her curiosity; and, though she never\nseriously fathomed her own intentions, she would sit, every moment she\ncould steal from observation, listening to the tale, which Maria was\neager to relate with all the persuasive eloquence of grief.\n\nIt is so cheering to see a human face, even if little of the divinity\nof virtue beam in it, that Maria anxiously expected the return of\nthe attendant, as of a gleam of light to break the gloom of idleness.\nIndulged sorrow, she perceived, must blunt or sharpen the faculties to\nthe two opposite extremes; producing stupidity, the moping melancholy of\nindolence; or the restless activity of a disturbed imagination. She\nsunk into one state, after being fatigued by the other: till the want\nof occupation became even more painful than the actual pressure or\napprehension of sorrow; and the confinement that froze her into a\nnook of existence, with an unvaried prospect before her, the most\ninsupportable of evils. The lamp of life seemed to be spending itself\nto chase the vapours of a dungeon which no art could dissipate.--And\nto what purpose did she rally all her energy?--Was not the world a vast\nprison, and women born slaves?\n\nThough she failed immediately to rouse a lively sense of injustice\nin the mind of her guard, because it had been sophisticated into\nmisanthropy, she touched her heart. Jemima (she had only a claim to a\nChristian name, which had not procured her any Christian privileges)\ncould patiently hear of Maria's confinement on false pretences; she had\nfelt the crushing hand of power, hardened by the exercise of injustice,\nand ceased to wonder at the perversions of the understanding, which\nsystematize oppression; but, when told that her child, only four\nmonths old, had been torn from her, even while she was discharging the\ntenderest maternal office, the woman awoke in a bosom long estranged\nfrom feminine emotions, and Jemima determined to alleviate all in her\npower, without hazarding the loss of her place, the sufferings of a\nwretched mother, apparently injured, and certainly unhappy. A sense of\nright seems to result from the simplest act of reason, and to preside\nover the faculties of the mind, like the master-sense of feeling, to\nrectify the rest; but (for the comparison may be carried still farther)\nhow often is the exquisite sensibility of both weakened or destroyed by\nthe vulgar occupations, and ignoble pleasures of life?\n\nThe preserving her situation was, indeed, an important object to Jemima,\nwho had been hunted from hole to hole, as if she had been a beast of\nprey, or infected with a moral plague. The wages she received, the\ngreater part of which she hoarded, as her only chance for independence,\nwere much more considerable than she could reckon on obtaining any\nwhere else, were it possible that she, an outcast from society, could\nbe permitted to earn a subsistence in a reputable family. Hearing Maria\nperpetually complain of listlessness, and the not being able to beguile\ngrief by resuming her customary pursuits, she was easily prevailed on,\nby compassion, and that involuntary respect for abilities, which those\nwho possess them can never eradicate, to bring her some books and\nimplements for writing. Maria's conversation had amused and interested\nher, and the natural consequence was a desire, scarcely observed\nby herself, of obtaining the esteem of a person she admired. The\nremembrance of better days was rendered more lively; and the sentiments\nthen acquired appearing less romantic than they had for a long period, a\nspark of hope roused her mind to new activity.\n\nHow grateful was her attention to Maria! Oppressed by a dead weight of\nexistence, or preyed on by the gnawing worm of discontent, with what\neagerness did she endeavour to shorten the long days, which left no\ntraces behind! She seemed to be sailing on the vast ocean of life,\nwithout seeing any land-mark to indicate the progress of time; to find\nemployment was then to find variety, the animating principle of nature.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\n\nEARNESTLY as Maria endeavoured to soothe, by reading, the anguish of her\nwounded mind, her thoughts would often wander from the subject she was\nled to discuss, and tears of maternal tenderness obscured the reasoning\npage. She descanted on \"the ills which flesh is heir to,\" with\nbitterness, when the recollection of her babe was revived by a tale\nof fictitious woe, that bore any resemblance to her own; and her\nimagination was continually employed, to conjure up and embody the\nvarious phantoms of misery, which folly and vice had let loose on the\nworld. The loss of her babe was the tender string; against other cruel\nremembrances she laboured to steel her bosom; and even a ray of hope,\nin the midst of her gloomy reveries, would sometimes gleam on the dark\nhorizon of futurity, while persuading herself that she ought to cease\nto hope, since happiness was no where to be found.--But of her child,\ndebilitated by the grief with which its mother had been assailed before\nit saw the light, she could not think without an impatient struggle.\n\n\"I, alone, by my active tenderness, could have saved,\" she would\nexclaim, \"from an early blight, this sweet blossom; and, cherishing it,\nI should have had something still to love.\"\n\nIn proportion as other expectations were torn from her, this tender one\nhad been fondly clung to, and knit into her heart.\n\nThe books she had obtained, were soon devoured, by one who had no\nother resource to escape from sorrow, and the feverish dreams of\nideal wretchedness or felicity, which equally weaken the intoxicated\nsensibility. Writing was then the only alternative, and she wrote some\nrhapsodies descriptive of the state of her mind; but the events of her\npast life pressing on her, she resolved circumstantially to relate them,\nwith the sentiments that experience, and more matured reason, would\nnaturally suggest. They might perhaps instruct her daughter, and shield\nher from the misery, the tyranny, her mother knew not how to avoid.\n\nThis thought gave life to her diction, her soul flowed into it, and she\nsoon found the task of recollecting almost obliterated impressions\nvery interesting. She lived again in the revived emotions of youth,\nand forgot her present in the retrospect of sorrows that had assumed an\nunalterable character.\n\nThough this employment lightened the weight of time, yet, never losing\nsight of her main object, Maria did not allow any opportunity to slip\nof winning on the affections of Jemima; for she discovered in her a\nstrength of mind, that excited her esteem, clouded as it was by the\nmisanthropy of despair.\n\nAn insulated being, from the misfortune of her birth, she despised and\npreyed on the society by which she had been oppressed, and loved not her\nfellow-creatures, because she had never been beloved. No mother had ever\nfondled her, no father or brother had protected her from outrage; and\nthe man who had plunged her into infamy, and deserted her when she stood\nin greatest need of support, deigned not to smooth with kindness the\nroad to ruin. Thus degraded, was she let loose on the world; and\nvirtue, never nurtured by affection, assumed the stern aspect of selfish\nindependence.\n\nThis general view of her life, Maria gathered from her exclamations and\ndry remarks. Jemima indeed displayed a strange mixture of interest\nand suspicion; for she would listen to her with earnestness, and then\nsuddenly interrupt the conversation, as if afraid of resigning, by\ngiving way to her sympathy, her dear-bought knowledge of the world.\n\nMaria alluded to the possibility of an escape, and mentioned a\ncompensation, or reward; but the style in which she was repulsed made\nher cautious, and determine not to renew the subject, till she knew\nmore of the character she had to work on. Jemima's countenance, and\ndark hints, seemed to say, \"You are an extraordinary woman; but let me\nconsider, this may only be one of your lucid intervals.\" Nay, the very\nenergy of Maria's character, made her suspect that the extraordinary\nanimation she perceived might be the effect of madness. \"Should her\nhusband then substantiate his charge, and get possession of her estate,\nfrom whence would come the promised annuity, or more desired protection?\nBesides, might not a woman, anxious to escape, conceal some of the\ncircumstances which made against her? Was truth to be expected from one\nwho had been entrapped, kidnapped, in the most fraudulent manner?\"\n\nIn this train Jemima continued to argue, the moment after compassion\nand respect seemed to make her swerve; and she still resolved not to be\nwrought on to do more than soften the rigour of confinement, till she\ncould advance on surer ground.\n\nMaria was not permitted to walk in the garden; but sometimes, from her\nwindow, she turned her eyes from the gloomy walls, in which she pined\nlife away, on the poor wretches who strayed along the walks, and\ncontemplated the most terrific of ruins--that of a human soul. What\nis the view of the fallen column, the mouldering arch, of the most\nexquisite workmanship, when compared with this living memento of the\nfragility, the instability, of reason, and the wild luxuriancy of\nnoxious passions? Enthusiasm turned adrift, like some rich stream\noverflowing its banks, rushes forward with destructive velocity,\ninspiring a sublime concentration of thought. Thus thought Maria--These\nare the ravages over which humanity must ever mournfully ponder, with a\ndegree of anguish not excited by crumbling marble, or cankering brass,\nunfaithful to the trust of monumental fame. It is not over the decaying\nproductions of the mind, embodied with the happiest art, we grieve most\nbitterly. The view of what has been done by man, produces a melancholy,\nyet aggrandizing, sense of what remains to be achieved by human\nintellect; but a mental convulsion, which, like the devastation of an\nearthquake, throws all the elements of thought and imagination into\nconfusion, makes contemplation giddy, and we fearfully ask on what\nground we ourselves stand.\n\nMelancholy and imbecility marked the features of the wretches allowed to\nbreathe at large; for the frantic, those who in a strong imagination\nhad lost a sense of woe, were closely confined. The playful tricks and\nmischievous devices of their disturbed fancy, that suddenly broke out,\ncould not be guarded against, when they were permitted to enjoy any\nportion of freedom; for, so active was their imagination, that every new\nobject which accidentally struck their senses, awoke to phrenzy their\nrestless passions; as Maria learned from the burden of their incessant\nravings.\n\nSometimes, with a strict injunction of silence, Jemima would allow\nMaria, at the close of evening, to stray along the narrow avenues that\nseparated the dungeon-like apartments, leaning on her arm. What a change\nof scene! Maria wished to pass the threshold of her prison, yet, when\nby chance she met the eye of rage glaring on her, yet unfaithful to its\noffice, she shrunk back with more horror and affright, than if she had\nstumbled over a mangled corpse. Her busy fancy pictured the misery of\na fond heart, watching over a friend thus estranged, absent, though\npresent--over a poor wretch lost to reason and the social joys of\nexistence; and losing all consciousness of misery in its excess. What\na task, to watch the light of reason quivering in the eye, or with\nagonizing expectation to catch the beam of recollection; tantalized by\nhope, only to feel despair more keenly, at finding a much loved face\nor voice, suddenly remembered, or pathetically implored, only to be\nimmediately forgotten, or viewed with indifference or abhorrence!\n\nThe heart-rending sigh of melancholy sunk into her soul; and when she\nretired to rest, the petrified figures she had encountered, the only\nhuman forms she was doomed to observe, haunting her dreams with tales of\nmysterious wrongs, made her wish to sleep to dream no more.\n\nDay after day rolled away, and tedious as the present moment appeared,\nthey passed in such an unvaried tenor, Maria was surprised to find that\nshe had already been six weeks buried alive, and yet had such faint\nhopes of effecting her enlargement. She was, earnestly as she had sought\nfor employment, now angry with herself for having been amused by writing\nher narrative; and grieved to think that she had for an instant thought\nof any thing, but contriving to escape.\n\nJemima had evidently pleasure in her society: still, though she often\nleft her with a glow of kindness, she returned with the same chilling\nair; and, when her heart appeared for a moment to open, some suggestion\nof reason forcibly closed it, before she could give utterance to the\nconfidence Maria's conversation inspired.\n\nDiscouraged by these changes, Maria relapsed into despondency, when she\nwas cheered by the alacrity with which Jemima brought her a fresh parcel\nof books; assuring her, that she had taken some pains to obtain them\nfrom one of the keepers, who attended a gentleman confined in the\nopposite corner of the gallery.\n\nMaria took up the books with emotion. \"They come,\" said she, \"perhaps,\nfrom a wretch condemned, like me, to reason on the nature of madness,\nby having wrecked minds continually under his eye; and almost to wish\nhimself--as I do--mad, to escape from the contemplation of it.\" Her\nheart throbbed with sympathetic alarm; and she turned over the leaves\nwith awe, as if they had become sacred from passing through the hands of\nan unfortunate being, oppressed by a similar fate.\n\nDryden's Fables, Milton's Paradise Lost, with several modern\nproductions, composed the collection. It was a mine of treasure. Some\nmarginal notes, in Dryden's Fables, caught her attention: they were\nwritten with force and taste; and, in one of the modern pamphlets, there\nwas a fragment left, containing various observations on the present\nstate of society and government, with a comparative view of the politics\nof Europe and America. These remarks were written with a degree of\ngenerous warmth, when alluding to the enslaved state of the labouring\nmajority, perfectly in unison with Maria's mode of thinking.\n\nShe read them over and over again; and fancy, treacherous fancy, began\nto sketch a character, congenial with her own, from these shadowy\noutlines.--\"Was he mad?\" She reperused the marginal notes, and\nthey seemed the production of an animated, but not of a disturbed\nimagination. Confined to this speculation, every time she re-read them,\nsome fresh refinement of sentiment, or acuteness of thought impressed\nher, which she was astonished at herself for not having before observed.\n\nWhat a creative power has an affectionate heart! There are beings who\ncannot live without loving, as poets love; and who feel the electric\nspark of genius, wherever it awakens sentiment or grace. Maria had often\nthought, when disciplining her wayward heart, \"that to charm, was to be\nvirtuous.\" \"They who make me wish to appear the most amiable and good\nin their eyes, must possess in a degree,\" she would exclaim, \"the graces\nand virtues they call into action.\"\n\nShe took up a book on the powers of the human mind; but, her attention\nstrayed from cold arguments on the nature of what she felt, while she\nwas feeling, and she snapt the chain of the theory to read Dryden's\nGuiscard and Sigismunda.\n\nMaria, in the course of the ensuing day, returned some of the books,\nwith the hope of getting others--and more marginal notes. Thus shut out\nfrom human intercourse, and compelled to view nothing but the prison of\nvexed spirits, to meet a wretch in the same situation, was more surely\nto find a friend, than to imagine a countryman one, in a strange land,\nwhere the human voice conveys no information to the eager ear.\n\n\"Did you ever see the unfortunate being to whom these books belong?\"\nasked Maria, when Jemima brought her slipper. \"Yes. He sometimes\nwalks out, between five and six, before the family is stirring, in the\nmorning, with two keepers; but even then his hands are confined.\"\n\n\"What! is he so unruly?\" enquired Maria, with an accent of\ndisappointment.\n\n\"No, not that I perceive,\" replied Jemima; \"but he has an untamed look,\na vehemence of eye, that excites apprehension. Were his hands free,\nhe looks as if he could soon manage both his guards: yet he appears\ntranquil.\"\n\n\"If he be so strong, he must be young,\" observed Maria.\n\n\"Three or four and thirty, I suppose; but there is no judging of a\nperson in his situation.\"\n\n\"Are you sure that he is mad?\" interrupted Maria with eagerness. Jemima\nquitted the room, without replying.\n\n\"No, no, he certainly is not!\" exclaimed Maria, answering herself;\n\"the man who could write those observations was not disordered in his\nintellects.\"\n\nShe sat musing, gazing at the moon, and watching its motion as it seemed\nto glide under the clouds. Then, preparing for bed, she thought, \"Of\nwhat use could I be to him, or he to me, if it be true that he is\nunjustly confined?--Could he aid me to escape, who is himself more\nclosely watched?--Still I should like to see him.\" She went to bed,\ndreamed of her child, yet woke exactly at half after five o'clock, and\nstarting up, only wrapped a gown around her, and ran to the window. The\nmorning was chill, it was the latter end of September; yet she did not\nretire to warm herself and think in bed, till the sound of the servants,\nmoving about the house, convinced her that the unknown would not walk\nin the garden that morning. She was ashamed at feeling disappointed; and\nbegan to reflect, as an excuse to herself, on the little objects which\nattract attention when there is nothing to divert the mind; and how\ndifficult it was for women to avoid growing romantic, who have no active\nduties or pursuits.\n\nAt breakfast, Jemima enquired whether she understood French? for, unless\nshe did, the stranger's stock of books was exhausted. Maria replied in\nthe affirmative; but forbore to ask any more questions respecting the\nperson to whom they belonged. And Jemima gave her a new subject for\ncontemplation, by describing the person of a lovely maniac, just brought\ninto an adjoining chamber. She was singing the pathetic ballad of\nold Rob* with the most heart-melting falls and pauses. Jemima had\nhalf-opened the door, when she distinguished her voice, and Maria stood\nclose to it, scarcely daring to respire, lest a modulation should escape\nher, so exquisitely sweet, so passionately wild. She began with sympathy\nto pourtray to herself another victim, when the lovely warbler flew, as\nit were, from the spray, and a torrent of unconnected exclamations and\nquestions burst from her, interrupted by fits of laughter, so\nhorrid, that Maria shut the door, and, turning her eyes up to heaven,\nexclaimed--\"Gracious God!\"\n\n     * A blank space about ten characters in length occurs here\n     in the original edition [Publisher's note].\n\nSeveral minutes elapsed before Maria could enquire respecting the rumour\nof the house (for this poor wretch was obviously not confined without a\ncause); and then Jemima could only tell her, that it was said, \"she\nhad been married, against her inclination, to a rich old man, extremely\njealous (no wonder, for she was a charming creature); and that, in\nconsequence of his treatment, or something which hung on her mind, she\nhad, during her first lying-in, lost her senses.\"\n\nWhat a subject of meditation--even to the very confines of madness.\n\n\"Woman, fragile flower! why were you suffered to adorn a world exposed\nto the inroad of such stormy elements?\" thought Maria, while the poor\nmaniac's strain was still breathing on her ear, and sinking into her\nvery soul.\n\nTowards the evening, Jemima brought her Rousseau's Heloise; and she sat\nreading with eyes and heart, till the return of her guard to extinguish\nthe light. One instance of her kindness was, the permitting Maria to\nhave one, till her own hour of retiring to rest. She had read this work\nlong since; but now it seemed to open a new world to her--the only\none worth inhabiting. Sleep was not to be wooed; yet, far from being\nfatigued by the restless rotation of thought, she rose and opened her\nwindow, just as the thin watery clouds of twilight made the long\nsilent shadows visible. The air swept across her face with a voluptuous\nfreshness that thrilled to her heart, awakening indefinable emotions;\nand the sound of a waving branch, or the twittering of a startled bird,\nalone broke the stillness of reposing nature. Absorbed by the sublime\nsensibility which renders the consciousness of existence felicity, Maria\nwas happy, till an autumnal scent, wafted by the breeze of morn from the\nfallen leaves of the adjacent wood, made her recollect that the season\nhad changed since her confinement; yet life afforded no variety to\nsolace an afflicted heart. She returned dispirited to her couch, and\nthought of her child till the broad glare of day again invited her to\nthe window. She looked not for the unknown, still how great was her\nvexation at perceiving the back of a man, certainly he, with his two\nattendants, as he turned into a side-path which led to the house!\nA confused recollection of having seen somebody who resembled\nhim, immediately occurred, to puzzle and torment her with endless\nconjectures. Five minutes sooner, and she should have seen his face, and\nbeen out of suspense--was ever any thing so unlucky! His steady, bold\nstep, and the whole air of his person, bursting as it were from a\ncloud, pleased her, and gave an outline to the imagination to sketch the\nindividual form she wished to recognize.\n\nFeeling the disappointment more severely than she was willing to\nbelieve, she flew to Rousseau, as her only refuge from the idea of him,\nwho might prove a friend, could she but find a way to interest him in\nher fate; still the personification of Saint Preux, or of an ideal lover\nfar superior, was after this imperfect model, of which merely a glance\nhad been caught, even to the minutiae of the coat and hat of the\nstranger. But if she lent St. Preux, or the demi-god of her fancy,\nhis form, she richly repaid him by the donation of all St. Preux's\nsentiments and feelings, culled to gratify her own, to which he\nseemed to have an undoubted right, when she read on the margin of an\nimpassioned letter, written in the well-known hand--\"Rousseau alone, the\ntrue Prometheus of sentiment, possessed the fire of genius necessary to\npourtray the passion, the truth of which goes so directly to the heart.\"\n\nMaria was again true to the hour, yet had finished Rousseau, and begun\nto transcribe some selected passages; unable to quit either the author\nor the window, before she had a glimpse of the countenance she daily\nlonged to see; and, when seen, it conveyed no distinct idea to her\nmind where she had seen it before. He must have been a transient\nacquaintance; but to discover an acquaintance was fortunate, could she\ncontrive to attract his attention, and excite his sympathy.\n\nEvery glance afforded colouring for the picture she was delineating on\nher heart; and once, when the window was half open, the sound of his\nvoice reached her. Conviction flashed on her; she had certainly, in\na moment of distress, heard the same accents. They were manly, and\ncharacteristic of a noble mind; nay, even sweet--or sweet they seemed to\nher attentive ear.\n\nShe started back, trembling, alarmed at the emotion a strange\ncoincidence of circumstances inspired, and wondering why she thought so\nmuch of a stranger, obliged as she had been by his timely interference;\n[for she recollected, by degrees all the circumstances of their former\nmeeting.] She found however that she could think of nothing else; or, if\nshe thought of her daughter, it was to wish that she had a father whom\nher mother could respect and love.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\n\nWHEN PERUSING the first parcel of books, Maria had, with her pencil,\nwritten in one of them a few exclamations, expressive of compassion and\nsympathy, which she scarcely remembered, till turning over the leaves of\none of the volumes, lately brought to her, a slip of paper dropped out,\nwhich Jemima hastily snatched up.\n\n\"Let me see it,\" demanded Maria impatiently, \"You surely are not afraid\nof trusting me with the effusions of a madman?\" \"I must consider,\"\nreplied Jemima; and withdrew, with the paper in her hand.\n\nIn a life of such seclusion, the passions gain undue force; Maria\ntherefore felt a great degree of resentment and vexation, which she had\nnot time to subdue, before Jemima, returning, delivered the paper.\n\n     \"Whoever you are, who partake of my fate,\n     accept my sincere commiseration--I would have said\n     protection; but the privilege of man is denied me.\n\n     \"My own situation forces a dreadful suspicion on\n     my mind--I may not always languish in vain for freedom--\n     say are you--I cannot ask the question; yet I will\n     remember you when my remembrance can be of any use.\n     I will enquire, why you are so mysteriously detained--\n     and I will have an answer.\n\n     \"HENRY DARNFORD.\"\n\nBy the most pressing intreaties, Maria prevailed on Jemima to permit her\nto write a reply to this note. Another and another succeeded, in which\nexplanations were not allowed relative to their present situation; but\nMaria, with sufficient explicitness, alluded to a former obligation;\nand they insensibly entered on an interchange of sentiments on the most\nimportant subjects. To write these letters was the business of the day,\nand to receive them the moment of sunshine. By some means, Darnford\nhaving discovered Maria's window, when she next appeared at it, he made\nher, behind his keepers, a profound bow of respect and recognition.\n\nTwo or three weeks glided away in this kind of intercourse, during\nwhich period Jemima, to whom Maria had given the necessary information\nrespecting her family, had evidently gained some intelligence, which\nincreased her desire of pleasing her charge, though she could not yet\ndetermine to liberate her. Maria took advantage of this favourable\ncharge, without too minutely enquiring into the cause; and such was her\neagerness to hold human converse, and to see her former protector, still\na stranger to her, that she incessantly requested her guard to gratify\nher more than curiosity.\n\nWriting to Darnford, she was led from the sad objects before her, and\nfrequently rendered insensible to the horrid noises around her, which\npreviously had continually employed her feverish fancy. Thinking it\nselfish to dwell on her own sufferings, when in the midst of wretches,\nwho had not only lost all that endears life, but their very selves, her\nimagination was occupied with melancholy earnestness to trace the mazes\nof misery, through which so many wretches must have passed to this\ngloomy receptacle of disjointed souls, to the grand source of human\ncorruption. Often at midnight was she waked by the dismal shrieks of\ndemoniac rage, or of excruciating despair, uttered in such wild tones of\nindescribable anguish as proved the total absence of reason, and roused\nphantoms of horror in her mind, far more terrific than all that dreaming\nsuperstition ever drew. Besides, there was frequently something so\ninconceivably picturesque in the varying gestures of unrestrained\npassion, so irresistibly comic in their sallies, or so heart-piercingly\npathetic in the little airs they would sing, frequently bursting out\nafter an awful silence, as to fascinate the attention, and amuse the\nfancy, while torturing the soul. It was the uproar of the passions which\nshe was compelled to observe; and to mark the lucid beam of reason,\nlike a light trembling in a socket, or like the flash which divides the\nthreatening clouds of angry heaven only to display the horrors which\ndarkness shrouded.\n\nJemima would labour to beguile the tedious evenings, by describing the\npersons and manners of the unfortunate beings, whose figures or voices\nawoke sympathetic sorrow in Maria's bosom; and the stories she told\nwere the more interesting, for perpetually leaving room to conjecture\nsomething extraordinary. Still Maria, accustomed to generalize her\nobservations, was led to conclude from all she heard, that it was a\nvulgar error to suppose that people of abilities were the most apt to\nlose the command of reason. On the contrary, from most of the instances\nshe could investigate, she thought it resulted, that the passions only\nappeared strong and disproportioned, because the judgment was weak and\nunexercised; and that they gained strength by the decay of reason, as\nthe shadows lengthen during the sun's decline.\n\nMaria impatiently wished to see her fellow-sufferer; but Darnford was\nstill more earnest to obtain an interview. Accustomed to submit to every\nimpulse of passion, and never taught, like women, to restrain the most\nnatural, and acquire, instead of the bewitching frankness of nature, a\nfactitious propriety of behaviour, every desire became a torrent that\nbore down all opposition.\n\nHis travelling trunk, which contained the books lent to Maria, had been\nsent to him, and with a part of its contents he bribed his principal\nkeeper; who, after receiving the most solemn promise that he would\nreturn to his apartment without attempting to explore any part of the\nhouse, conducted him, in the dusk of the evening, to Maria's room.\n\nJemima had apprized her charge of the visit, and she expected with\ntrembling impatience, inspired by a vague hope that he might again prove\nher deliverer, to see a man who had before rescued her from oppression.\nHe entered with an animation of countenance, formed to captivate an\nenthusiast; and, hastily turned his eyes from her to the apartment,\nwhich he surveyed with apparent emotions of compassionate indignation.\nSympathy illuminated his eye, and, taking her hand, he respectfully\nbowed on it, exclaiming--\"This is extraordinary!--again to meet you,\nand in such circumstances!\" Still, impressive as was the coincidence of\nevents which brought them once more together, their full hearts did not\noverflow.--*\n\n     * The copy which had received the author's last corrections\n     breaks off in this place, and the pages which follow, to the\n     end of Chap.  IV, are printed from a copy in a less finished\n     state. [Godwin's note]\n\n[And though, after this first visit, they were permitted frequently to\nrepeat their interviews, they were for some time employed in] a reserved\nconversation, to which all the world might have listened; excepting,\nwhen discussing some literary subject, flashes of sentiment, inforced\nby each relaxing feature, seemed to remind them that their minds were\nalready acquainted.\n\n[By degrees, Darnford entered into the particulars of his story.] In a\nfew words, he informed her that he had been a thoughtless, extravagant\nyoung man; yet, as he described his faults, they appeared to be the\ngenerous luxuriancy of a noble mind. Nothing like meanness tarnished\nthe lustre of his youth, nor had the worm of selfishness lurked in the\nunfolding bud, even while he had been the dupe of others. Yet he\ntardily acquired the experience necessary to guard him against future\nimposition.\n\n\"I shall weary you,\" continued he, \"by my egotism; and did not powerful\nemotions draw me to you,\"--his eyes glistened as he spoke, and a\ntrembling seemed to run through his manly frame,--\"I would not waste\nthese precious moments in talking of myself.\n\n\"My father and mother were people of fashion; married by their parents.\nHe was fond of the turf, she of the card-table. I, and two or three\nother children since dead, were kept at home till we became intolerable.\nMy father and mother had a visible dislike to each other, continually\ndisplayed; the servants were of the depraved kind usually found in the\nhouses of people of fortune. My brothers and parents all dying, I was\nleft to the care of guardians; and sent to Eton. I never knew the sweets\nof domestic affection, but I felt the want of indulgence and frivolous\nrespect at school. I will not disgust you with a recital of the vices of\nmy youth, which can scarcely be comprehended by female delicacy. I was\ntaught to love by a creature I am ashamed to mention; and the other\nwomen with whom I afterwards became intimate, were of a class of which\nyou can have no knowledge. I formed my acquaintance with them at the\ntheaters; and, when vivacity danced in their eyes, I was not easily\ndisgusted by the vulgarity which flowed from their lips. Having spent,\na few years after I was of age, [the whole of] a considerable patrimony,\nexcepting a few hundreds, I had no resource but to purchase a commission\nin a new-raised regiment, destined to subjugate America. The regret\nI felt to renounce a life of pleasure, was counter-balanced by the\ncuriosity I had to see America, or rather to travel; [nor had any\nof those circumstances occurred to my youth, which might have been\ncalculated] to bind my country to my heart. I shall not trouble you with\nthe details of a military life. My blood was still kept in motion; till,\ntowards the close of the contest, I was wounded and taken prisoner.\n\n\"Confined to my bed, or chair, by a lingering cure, my only refuge from\nthe preying activity of my mind, was books, which I read with great\navidity, profiting by the conversation of my host, a man of sound\nunderstanding. My political sentiments now underwent a total change;\nand, dazzled by the hospitality of the Americans, I determined to take\nup my abode with freedom. I, therefore, with my usual impetuosity, sold\nmy commission, and travelled into the interior parts of the country, to\nlay out my money to advantage. Added to this, I did not much like the\npuritanical manners of the large towns. Inequality of condition was\nthere most disgustingly galling. The only pleasure wealth afforded, was\nto make an ostentatious display of it; for the cultivation of the fine\narts, or literature, had not introduced into the first circles that\npolish of manners which renders the rich so essentially superior to the\npoor in Europe. Added to this, an influx of vices had been let in by\nthe Revolution, and the most rigid principles of religion shaken to the\ncentre, before the understanding could be gradually emancipated from the\nprejudices which led their ancestors undauntedly to seek an inhospitable\nclime and unbroken soil. The resolution, that led them, in pursuit\nof independence, to embark on rivers like seas, to search for unknown\nshores, and to sleep under the hovering mists of endless forests,\nwhose baleful damps agued their limbs, was now turned into commercial\nspeculations, till the national character exhibited a phenomenon in the\nhistory of the human mind--a head enthusiastically enterprising,\nwith cold selfishness of heart. And woman, lovely woman!--they charm\neverywhere--still there is a degree of prudery, and a want of taste and\nease in the manners of the American women, that renders them, in spite\nof their roses and lilies, far inferior to our European charmers. In the\ncountry, they have often a bewitching simplicity of character; but, in\nthe cities, they have all the airs and ignorance of the ladies who give\nthe tone to the circles of the large trading towns in England. They are\nfond of their ornaments, merely because they are good, and not because\nthey embellish their persons; and are more gratified to inspire the\nwomen with jealousy of these exterior advantages, than the men with\nlove. All the frivolity which often (excuse me, Madam) renders the\nsociety of modest women so stupid in England, here seemed to throw still\nmore leaden fetters on their charms. Not being an adept in gallantry,\nI found that I could only keep myself awake in their company by making\ndownright love to them.\n\n\"But, not to intrude on your patience, I retired to the track of land\nwhich I had purchased in the country, and my time passed pleasantly\nenough while I cut down the trees, built my house, and planted my\ndifferent crops. But winter and idleness came, and I longed for more\nelegant society, to hear what was passing in the world, and to do\nsomething better than vegetate with the animals that made a very\nconsiderable part of my household. Consequently, I determined to travel.\nMotion was a substitute for variety of objects; and, passing over\nimmense tracks of country, I exhausted my exuberant spirits, without\nobtaining much experience. I every where saw industry the fore-runner\nand not the consequence, of luxury; but this country, everything being\non an ample scale, did not afford those picturesque views, which a\ncertain degree of cultivation is necessary gradually to produce. The eye\nwandered without an object to fix upon over immeasureable plains, and\nlakes that seemed replenished by the ocean, whilst eternal forests\nof small clustering trees, obstructed the circulation of air, and\nembarrassed the path, without gratifying the eye of taste. No cottage\nsmiling in the waste, no travellers hailed us, to give life to silent\nnature; or, if perchance we saw the print of a footstep in our path, it\nwas a dreadful warning to turn aside; and the head ached as if assailed\nby the scalping knife. The Indians who hovered on the skirts of the\nEuropean settlements had only learned of their neighbours to plunder,\nand they stole their guns from them to do it with more safety.\n\n\"From the woods and back settlements, I returned to the towns, and\nlearned to eat and drink most valiantly; but without entering into\ncommerce (and I detested commerce) I found I could not live there; and,\ngrowing heartily weary of the land of liberty and vulgar aristocracy,\nseated on her bags of dollars, I resolved once more to visit Europe. I\nwrote to a distant relation in England, with whom I had been educated,\nmentioning the vessel in which I intended to sail. Arriving in London,\nmy senses were intoxicated. I ran from street to street, from theater\nto theater, and the women of the town (again I must beg pardon for my\nhabitual frankness) appeared to me like angels.\n\n\"A week was spent in this thoughtless manner, when, returning very late\nto the hotel in which I had lodged ever since my arrival, I was knocked\ndown in a private street, and hurried, in a state of insensibility, into\na coach, which brought me hither, and I only recovered my senses to\nbe treated like one who had lost them. My keepers are deaf to my\nremonstrances and enquiries, yet assure me that my confinement shall not\nlast long. Still I cannot guess, though I weary myself with conjectures,\nwhy I am confined, or in what part of England this house is situated. I\nimagine sometimes that I hear the sea roar, and wished myself again on\nthe Atlantic, till I had a glimpse of you.\"*\n\nA few moments were only allowed to Maria to comment on this narrative,\nwhen Darnford left her to her own thoughts, to the \"never ending, still\nbeginning,\" task of weighing his words, recollecting his tones of voice,\nand feeling them reverberate on her heart.\n\n     * The introduction of Darnford as the deliverer of Maria in\n     a former instance, appears to have been an after-thought of\n     the author.  This has occasioned the omission of any\n     allusion to that circumstance in the preceding narration.\n     EDITOR. [Godwin's note]\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\n\nPITY, and the forlorn seriousness of adversity, have both been\nconsidered as dispositions favourable to love, while satirical writers\nhave attributed the propensity to the relaxing effect of idleness; what\nchance then had Maria of escaping, when pity, sorrow, and solitude all\nconspired to soften her mind, and nourish romantic wishes, and, from a\nnatural progress, romantic expectations?\n\nMaria was six-and-twenty. But, such was the native soundness of her\nconstitution, that time had only given to her countenance the character\nof her mind. Revolving thought, and exercised affections had banished\nsome of the playful graces of innocence, producing insensibly that\nirregularity of features which the struggles of the understanding to\ntrace or govern the strong emotions of the heart, are wont to imprint on\nthe yielding mass. Grief and care had mellowed, without obscuring, the\nbright tints of youth, and the thoughtfulness which resided on her brow\ndid not take from the feminine softness of her features; nay, such\nwas the sensibility which often mantled over it, that she frequently\nappeared, like a large proportion of her sex, only born to feel; and the\nactivity of her well-proportioned, and even almost voluptuous figure,\ninspired the idea of strength of mind, rather than of body. There was a\nsimplicity sometimes indeed in her manner, which bordered on infantine\ningenuousness, that led people of common discernment to underrate her\ntalents, and smile at the flights of her imagination. But those who\ncould not comprehend the delicacy of her sentiments, were attached\nby her unfailing sympathy, so that she was very generally beloved by\ncharacters of very different descriptions; still, she was too much under\nthe influence of an ardent imagination to adhere to common rules.\n\nThere are mistakes of conduct which at five-and-twenty prove the\nstrength of the mind, that, ten or fifteen years after, would\ndemonstrate its weakness, its incapacity to acquire a sane judgment. The\nyouths who are satisfied with the ordinary pleasures of life, and do not\nsigh after ideal phantoms of love and friendship, will never arrive at\ngreat maturity of understanding; but if these reveries are cherished,\nas is too frequently the case with women, when experience ought to have\ntaught them in what human happiness consists, they become as useless as\nthey are wretched. Besides, their pains and pleasures are so dependent\non outward circumstances, on the objects of their affections, that they\nseldom act from the impulse of a nerved mind, able to choose its own\npursuit.\n\nHaving had to struggle incessantly with the vices of mankind, Maria's\nimagination found repose in pourtraying the possible virtues the\nworld might contain. Pygmalion formed an ivory maid, and longed for an\ninforming soul. She, on the contrary, combined all the qualities of a\nhero's mind, and fate presented a statue in which she might enshrine\nthem.\n\nWe mean not to trace the progress of this passion, or recount how often\nDarnford and Maria were obliged to part in the midst of an interesting\nconversation. Jemima ever watched on the tip-toe of fear, and frequently\nseparated them on a false alarm, when they would have given worlds to\nremain a little longer together.\n\nA magic lamp now seemed to be suspended in Maria's prison, and fairy\nlandscapes flitted round the gloomy walls, late so blank. Rushing from\nthe depth of despair, on the seraph wing of hope, she found herself\nhappy.--She was beloved, and every emotion was rapturous.\n\nTo Darnford she had not shown a decided affection; the fear of\noutrunning his, a sure proof of love, made her often assume a coldness\nand indifference foreign from her character; and, even when giving way\nto the playful emotions of a heart just loosened from the frozen bond of\ngrief, there was a delicacy in her manner of expressing her sensibility,\nwhich made him doubt whether it was the effect of love.\n\nOne evening, when Jemima left them, to listen to the sound of a distant\nfootstep, which seemed cautiously to approach, he seized Maria's\nhand--it was not withdrawn. They conversed with earnestness of their\nsituation; and, during the conversation, he once or twice gently drew\nher towards him. He felt the fragrance of her breath, and longed, yet\nfeared, to touch the lips from which it issued; spirits of purity seemed\nto guard them, while all the enchanting graces of love sported on her\ncheeks, and languished in her eyes.\n\nJemima entering, he reflected on his diffidence with poignant regret,\nand, she once more taking alarm, he ventured, as Maria stood near his\nchair, to approach her lips with a declaration of love. She drew back\nwith solemnity, he hung down his head abashed; but lifting his eyes\ntimidly, they met her's; she had determined, during that instant, and\nsuffered their rays to mingle. He took, with more ardour, reassured, a\nhalf-consenting, half-reluctant kiss, reluctant only from modesty; and\nthere was a sacredness in her dignified manner of reclining her glowing\nface on his shoulder, that powerfully impressed him. Desire was lost in\nmore ineffable emotions, and to protect her from insult and sorrow--to\nmake her happy, seemed not only the first wish of his heart, but the\nmost noble duty of his life. Such angelic confidence demanded the\nfidelity of honour; but could he, feeling her in every pulsation, could\nhe ever change, could he be a villain? The emotion with which she, for\na moment, allowed herself to be pressed to his bosom, the tear of\nrapturous sympathy, mingled with a soft melancholy sentiment of\nrecollected disappointment, said--more of truth and faithfulness, than\nthe tongue could have given utterance to in hours! They were silent--yet\ndiscoursed, how eloquently? till, after a moment's reflection, Maria\ndrew her chair by the side of his, and, with a composed sweetness of\nvoice, and supernatural benignity of countenance, said, \"I must open my\nwhole heart to you; you must be told who I am, why I am here, and why,\ntelling you I am a wife, I blush not to\"--the blush spoke the rest.\n\nJemima was again at her elbow, and the restraint of her presence did not\nprevent an animated conversation, in which love, sly urchin, was ever at\nbo-peep.\n\nSo much of heaven did they enjoy, that paradise bloomed around them; or\nthey, by a powerful spell, had been transported into Armida's garden.\nLove, the grand enchanter, \"lapt them in Elysium,\" and every sense was\nharmonized to joy and social extacy. So animated, indeed, were their\naccents of tenderness, in discussing what, in other circumstances, would\nhave been commonplace subjects, that Jemima felt, with surprise, a tear\nof pleasure trickling down her rugged cheeks. She wiped it away, half\nashamed; and when Maria kindly enquired the cause, with all the\neager solicitude of a happy being wishing to impart to all nature its\noverflowing felicity, Jemima owned that it was the first tear that\nsocial enjoyment had ever drawn from her. She seemed indeed to breathe\nmore freely; the cloud of suspicion cleared away from her brow; she felt\nherself, for once in her life, treated like a fellow-creature.\n\nImagination! who can paint thy power; or reflect the evanescent tints\nof hope fostered by thee? A despondent gloom had long obscured Maria's\nhorizon--now the sun broke forth, the rainbow appeared, and every\nprospect was fair. Horror still reigned in the darkened cells, suspicion\nlurked in the passages, and whispered along the walls. The yells of\nmen possessed, sometimes, made them pause, and wonder that they felt\nso happy, in a tomb of living death. They even chid themselves for such\napparent insensibility; still the world contained not three happier\nbeings. And Jemima, after again patrolling the passage, was so softened\nby the air of confidence which breathed around her, that she voluntarily\nbegan an account of herself.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\n\n\"MY FATHER,\" said Jemima, \"seduced my mother, a pretty girl, with whom\nhe lived fellow-servant; and she no sooner perceived the natural, the\ndreaded consequence, than the terrible conviction flashed on her--that\nshe was ruined. Honesty, and a regard for her reputation, had been the\nonly principles inculcated by her mother; and they had been so forcibly\nimpressed, that she feared shame, more than the poverty to which it\nwould lead. Her incessant importunities to prevail upon my father to\nscreen her from reproach by marrying her, as he had promised in the\nfervour of seduction, estranged him from her so completely, that her\nvery person became distasteful to him; and he began to hate, as well as\ndespise me, before I was born.\n\n\"My mother, grieved to the soul by his neglect, and unkind treatment,\nactually resolved to famish herself; and injured her health by the\nattempt; though she had not sufficient resolution to adhere to her\nproject, or renounce it entirely. Death came not at her call; yet\nsorrow, and the methods she adopted to conceal her condition, still\ndoing the work of a house-maid, had such an effect on her constitution,\nthat she died in the wretched garret, where her virtuous mistress had\nforced her to take refuge in the very pangs of labour, though my father,\nafter a slight reproof, was allowed to remain in his place--allowed by\nthe mother of six children, who, scarcely permitting a footstep to be\nheard, during her month's indulgence, felt no sympathy for the poor\nwretch, denied every comfort required by her situation.\n\n\"The day my mother, died, the ninth after my birth, I was consigned to\nthe care of the cheapest nurse my father could find; who suckled her own\nchild at the same time, and lodged as many more as she could get, in two\ncellar-like apartments.\n\n\"Poverty, and the habit of seeing children die off her hands, had so\nhardened her heart, that the office of a mother did not awaken the\ntenderness of a woman; nor were the feminine caresses which seem a part\nof the rearing of a child, ever bestowed on me. The chicken has a wing\nto shelter under; but I had no bosom to nestle in, no kindred warmth to\nfoster me. Left in dirt, to cry with cold and hunger till I was weary,\nand sleep without ever being prepared by exercise, or lulled by kindness\nto rest; could I be expected to become any thing but a weak and rickety\nbabe? Still, in spite of neglect, I continued to exist, to learn to\ncurse existence, [her countenance grew ferocious as she spoke,] and\nthe treatment that rendered me miserable, seemed to sharpen my wits.\nConfined then in a damp hovel, to rock the cradle of the succeeding\ntribe, I looked like a little old woman, or a hag shrivelling into\nnothing. The furrows of reflection and care contracted the youthful\ncheek, and gave a sort of supernatural wildness to the ever watchful\neye. During this period, my father had married another fellow-servant,\nwho loved him less, and knew better how to manage his passion, than my\nmother. She likewise proving with child, they agreed to keep a shop: my\nstep-mother, if, being an illegitimate offspring, I may venture thus\nto characterize her, having obtained a sum of a rich relation, for that\npurpose.\n\n\"Soon after her lying-in, she prevailed on my father to take me home, to\nsave the expense of maintaining me, and of hiring a girl to assist\nher in the care of the child. I was young, it was true, but appeared a\nknowing little thing, and might be made handy. Accordingly I was brought\nto her house; but not to a home--for a home I never knew. Of this\nchild, a daughter, she was extravagantly fond; and it was a part of\nmy employment, to assist to spoil her, by humouring all her whims, and\nbearing all her caprices. Feeling her own consequence, before she could\nspeak, she had learned the art of tormenting me, and if I ever dared to\nresist, I received blows, laid on with no compunctious hand, or was sent\nto bed dinnerless, as well as supperless. I said that it was a part of\nmy daily labour to attend this child, with the servility of a slave;\nstill it was but a part. I was sent out in all seasons, and from place\nto place, to carry burdens far above my strength, without being allowed\nto draw near the fire, or ever being cheered by encouragement or\nkindness. No wonder then, treated like a creature of another species,\nthat I began to envy, and at length to hate, the darling of the\nhouse. Yet, I perfectly remember, that it was the caresses, and\nkind expressions of my step-mother, which first excited my jealous\ndiscontent. Once, I cannot forget it, when she was calling in vain\nher wayward child to kiss her, I ran to her, saying, 'I will kiss you,\nma'am!' and how did my heart, which was in my mouth, sink, what was\nmy debasement of soul, when pushed away with--'I do not want you,\npert thing!' Another day, when a new gown had excited the highest good\nhumour, and she uttered the appropriate dear, addressed unexpectedly to\nme, I thought I could never do enough to please her; I was all alacrity,\nand rose proportionably in my own estimation.\n\n\"As her daughter grew up, she was pampered with cakes and fruit, while\nI was, literally speaking, fed with the refuse of the table, with her\nleavings. A liquorish tooth is, I believe, common to children, and I\nused to steal any thing sweet, that I could catch up with a chance of\nconcealment. When detected, she was not content to chastize me herself\nat the moment, but, on my father's return in the evening (he was\na shopman), the principal discourse was to recount my faults, and\nattribute them to the wicked disposition which I had brought into the\nworld with me, inherited from my mother. He did not fail to leave the\nmarks of his resentment on my body, and then solaced himself by playing\nwith my sister.--I could have murdered her at those moments. To save\nmyself from these unmerciful corrections, I resorted to falshood, and\nthe untruths which I sturdily maintained, were brought in judgment\nagainst me, to support my tyrant's inhuman charge of my natural\npropensity to vice. Seeing me treated with contempt, and always being\nfed and dressed better, my sister conceived a contemptuous opinion of\nme, that proved an obstacle to all affection; and my father, hearing\ncontinually of my faults, began to consider me as a curse entailed\non him for his sins: he was therefore easily prevailed on to bind me\napprentice to one of my step-mother's friends, who kept a slop-shop in\nWapping. I was represented (as it was said) in my true colours; but she,\n'warranted,' snapping her fingers, 'that she should break my spirit or\nheart.'\n\n\"My mother replied, with a whine, 'that if any body could make me\nbetter, it was such a clever woman as herself; though, for her own part,\nshe had tried in vain; but good-nature was her fault.'\n\n\"I shudder with horror, when I recollect the treatment I had now to\nendure. Not only under the lash of my task-mistress, but the drudge\nof the maid, apprentices and children, I never had a taste of human\nkindness to soften the rigour of perpetual labour. I had been introduced\nas an object of abhorrence into the family; as a creature of whom my\nstep-mother, though she had been kind enough to let me live in the house\nwith her own child, could make nothing. I was described as a wretch,\nwhose nose must be kept to the grinding stone--and it was held there\nwith an iron grasp. It seemed indeed the privilege of their superior\nnature to kick me about, like the dog or cat. If I were attentive, I\nwas called fawning, if refractory, an obstinate mule, and like a mule\nI received their censure on my loaded back. Often has my mistress, for\nsome instance of forgetfulness, thrown me from one side of the kitchen\nto the other, knocked my head against the wall, spit in my face, with\nvarious refinements on barbarity that I forbear to enumerate, though\nthey were all acted over again by the servant, with additional insults,\nto which the appellation of bastard, was commonly added, with taunts\nor sneers. But I will not attempt to give you an adequate idea of my\nsituation, lest you, who probably have never been drenched with the\ndregs of human misery, should think I exaggerate.\n\n\"I stole now, from absolute necessity,--bread; yet whatever else was\ntaken, which I had it not in my power to take, was ascribed to me. I was\nthe filching cat, the ravenous dog, the dumb brute, who must bear all;\nfor if I endeavoured to exculpate myself, I was silenced, without any\nenquiries being made, with 'Hold your tongue, you never tell truth.'\nEven the very air I breathed was tainted with scorn; for I was sent\nto the neighbouring shops with Glutton, Liar, or Thief, written on my\nforehead. This was, at first, the most bitter punishment; but sullen\npride, or a kind of stupid desperation, made me, at length, almost\nregardless of the contempt, which had wrung from me so many solitary\ntears at the only moments when I was allowed to rest.\n\n\"Thus was I the mark of cruelty till my sixteenth year; and then I have\nonly to point out a change of misery; for a period I never knew.\nAllow me first to make one observation. Now I look back, I cannot help\nattributing the greater part of my misery, to the misfortune of having\nbeen thrown into the world without the grand support of life--a mother's\naffection. I had no one to love me; or to make me respected, to enable\nme to acquire respect. I was an egg dropped on the sand; a pauper by\nnature, hunted from family to family, who belonged to nobody--and nobody\ncared for me. I was despised from my birth, and denied the chance of\nobtaining a footing for myself in society. Yes; I had not even the\nchance of being considered as a fellow-creature--yet all the people with\nwhom I lived, brutalized as they were by the low cunning of trade, and\nthe despicable shifts of poverty, were not without bowels, though they\nnever yearned for me. I was, in fact, born a slave, and chained by\ninfamy to slavery during the whole of existence, without having any\ncompanions to alleviate it by sympathy, or teach me how to rise above it\nby their example. But, to resume the thread of my tale--\n\n\"At sixteen, I suddenly grew tall, and something like comeliness\nappeared on a Sunday, when I had time to wash my face, and put on clean\nclothes. My master had once or twice caught hold of me in the passage;\nbut I instinctively avoided his disgusting caresses. One day however,\nwhen the family were at a methodist meeting, he contrived to be alone in\nthe house with me, and by blows--yes; blows and menaces, compelled me to\nsubmit to his ferocious desire; and, to avoid my mistress's fury, I was\nobliged in future to comply, and skulk to my loft at his command, in\nspite of increasing loathing.\n\n\"The anguish which was now pent up in my bosom, seemed to open a new\nworld to me: I began to extend my thoughts beyond myself, and grieve for\nhuman misery, till I discovered, with horror--ah! what horror!--that I\nwas with child. I know not why I felt a mixed sensation of despair and\ntenderness, excepting that, ever called a bastard, a bastard appeared to\nme an object of the greatest compassion in creation.\n\n\"I communicated this dreadful circumstance to my master, who was almost\nequally alarmed at the intelligence; for he feared his wife, and public\ncensure at the meeting. After some weeks of deliberation had elapsed, I\nin continual fear that my altered shape would be noticed, my master\ngave me a medicine in a phial, which he desired me to take, telling me,\nwithout any circumlocution, for what purpose it was designed. I burst\ninto tears, I thought it was killing myself--yet was such a self as\nI worth preserving? He cursed me for a fool, and left me to my own\nreflections. I could not resolve to take this infernal potion; but I\nwrapped it up in an old gown, and hid it in a corner of my box.\n\n\"Nobody yet suspected me, because they had been accustomed to view me as\na creature of another species. But the threatening storm at last broke\nover my devoted head--never shall I forget it! One Sunday evening when\nI was left, as usual, to take care of the house, my master came home\nintoxicated, and I became the prey of his brutal appetite. His extreme\nintoxication made him forget his customary caution, and my mistress\nentered and found us in a situation that could not have been more\nhateful to her than me. Her husband was 'pot-valiant,' he feared her not\nat the moment, nor had he then much reason, for she instantly turned the\nwhole force of her anger another way. She tore off my cap, scratched,\nkicked, and buffetted me, till she had exhausted her strength,\ndeclaring, as she rested her arm, 'that I had wheedled her husband from\nher.--But, could any thing better be expected from a wretch, whom she\nhad taken into her house out of pure charity?' What a torrent of abuse\nrushed out? till, almost breathless, she concluded with saying, 'that I\nwas born a strumpet; it ran in my blood, and nothing good could come to\nthose who harboured me.'\n\n\"My situation was, of course, discovered, and she declared that I should\nnot stay another night under the same roof with an honest family. I was\ntherefore pushed out of doors, and my trumpery thrown after me, when\nit had been contemptuously examined in the passage, lest I should have\nstolen any thing.\n\n\"Behold me then in the street, utterly destitute! Whither could I creep\nfor shelter? To my father's roof I had no claim, when not pursued\nby shame--now I shrunk back as from death, from my mother's cruel\nreproaches, my father's execrations. I could not endure to hear him\ncurse the day I was born, though life had been a curse to me. Of death\nI thought, but with a confused emotion of terror, as I stood leaning\nmy head on a post, and starting at every footstep, lest it should be\nmy mistress coming to tear my heart out. One of the boys of the shop\npassing by, heard my tale, and immediately repaired to his master,\nto give him a description of my situation; and he touched the right\nkey--the scandal it would give rise to, if I were left to repeat my\ntale to every enquirer. This plea came home to his reason, who had been\nsobered by his wife's rage, the fury of which fell on him when I was out\nof her reach, and he sent the boy to me with half-a-guinea, desiring him\nto conduct me to a house, where beggars, and other wretches, the refuse\nof society, nightly lodged.\n\n\"This night was spent in a state of stupefaction, or desperation. I\ndetested mankind, and abhorred myself.\n\n\"In the morning I ventured out, to throw myself in my master's way, at\nhis usual hour of going abroad. I approached him, he 'damned me for a\nb----, declared I had disturbed the peace of the family, and that he\nhad sworn to his wife, never to take any more notice of me.' He left me;\nbut, instantly returning, he told me that he should speak to his friend,\na parish-officer, to get a nurse for the brat I laid to him; and advised\nme, if I wished to keep out of the house of correction, not to make free\nwith his name.\n\n\"I hurried back to my hole, and, rage giving place to despair, sought\nfor the potion that was to procure abortion, and swallowed it, with\na wish that it might destroy me, at the same time that it stopped the\nsensations of new-born life, which I felt with indescribable emotion. My\nhead turned round, my heart grew sick, and in the horrors of approaching\ndissolution, mental anguish was swallowed up. The effect of the medicine\nwas violent, and I was confined to my bed several days; but, youth and\na strong constitution prevailing, I once more crawled out, to ask myself\nthe cruel question, 'Whither I should go?' I had but two shillings left\nin my pocket, the rest had been expended, by a poor woman who slept in\nthe same room, to pay for my lodging, and purchase the necessaries of\nwhich she partook.\n\n\"With this wretch I went into the neighbouring streets to beg, and my\ndisconsolate appearance drew a few pence from the idle, enabling me\nstill to command a bed; till, recovering from my illness, and taught\nto put on my rags to the best advantage, I was accosted from different\nmotives, and yielded to the desire of the brutes I met, with the same\ndetestation that I had felt for my still more brutal master. I have\nsince read in novels of the blandishments of seduction, but I had not\neven the pleasure of being enticed into vice.\n\n\"I shall not,\" interrupted Jemima, \"lead your imagination into all the\nscenes of wretchedness and depravity, which I was condemned to view; or\nmark the different stages of my debasing misery. Fate dragged me through\nthe very kennels of society: I was still a slave, a bastard, a common\nproperty. Become familiar with vice, for I wish to conceal nothing from\nyou, I picked the pockets of the drunkards who abused me; and proved by\nmy conduct, that I deserved the epithets, with which they loaded me at\nmoments when distrust ought to cease.\n\n\"Detesting my nightly occupation, though valuing, if I may so use the\nword, my independence, which only consisted in choosing the street in\nwhich I should wander, or the roof, when I had money, in which I should\nhide my head, I was some time before I could prevail on myself to accept\nof a place in a house of ill fame, to which a girl, with whom I had\naccidentally conversed in the street, had recommended me. I had been\nhunted almost into a fever, by the watchmen of the quarter of the town I\nfrequented; one, whom I had unwittingly offended, giving the word to\nthe whole pack. You can scarcely conceive the tyranny exercised by these\nwretches: considering themselves as the instruments of the very laws\nthey violate, the pretext which steels their conscience, hardens their\nheart. Not content with receiving from us, outlaws of society (let\nother women talk of favours) a brutal gratification gratuitously as a\nprivilege of office, they extort a tithe of prostitution, and harrass\nwith threats the poor creatures whose occupation affords not the means\nto silence the growl of avarice. To escape from this persecution, I once\nmore entered into servitude.\n\n\"A life of comparative regularity restored my health; and--do not\nstart--my manners were improved, in a situation where vice sought to\nrender itself alluring, and taste was cultivated to fashion the person,\nif not to refine the mind. Besides, the common civility of speech,\ncontrasted with the gross vulgarity to which I had been accustomed, was\nsomething like the polish of civilization. I was not shut out from all\nintercourse of humanity. Still I was galled by the yoke of service, and\nmy mistress often flying into violent fits of passion, made me dread\na sudden dismission, which I understood was always the case. I was\ntherefore prevailed on, though I felt a horror of men, to accept the\noffer of a gentleman, rather in the decline of years, to keep his house,\npleasantly situated in a little village near Hampstead.\n\n\"He was a man of great talents, and of brilliant wit; but, a worn-out\nvotary of voluptuousness, his desires became fastidious in proportion as\nthey grew weak, and the native tenderness of his heart was undermined by\na vitiated imagination. A thoughtless career of libertinism and social\nenjoyment, had injured his health to such a degree, that, whatever\npleasure his conversation afforded me (and my esteem was ensured by\nproofs of the generous humanity of his disposition), the being his\nmistress was purchasing it at a very dear rate. With such a keen\nperception of the delicacies of sentiment, with an imagination\ninvigorated by the exercise of genius, how could he sink into the\ngrossness of sensuality!\n\n\"But, to pass over a subject which I recollect with pain, I must remark\nto you, as an answer to your often-repeated question, 'Why my sentiments\nand language were superior to my station?' that I now began to read,\nto beguile the tediousness of solitude, and to gratify an inquisitive,\nactive mind. I had often, in my childhood, followed a ballad-singer,\nto hear the sequel of a dismal story, though sure of being severely\npunished for delaying to return with whatever I was sent to purchase.\nI could just spell and put a sentence together, and I listened to the\nvarious arguments, though often mingled with obscenity, which occurred\nat the table where I was allowed to preside: for a literary friend or\ntwo frequently came home with my master, to dine and pass the night.\nHaving lost the privileged respect of my sex, my presence, instead of\nrestraining, perhaps gave the reins to their tongues; still I had the\nadvantage of hearing discussions, from which, in the common course of\nlife, women are excluded.\n\n\"You may easily imagine, that it was only by degrees that I could\ncomprehend some of the subjects they investigated, or acquire from their\nreasoning what might be termed a moral sense. But my fondness of reading\nincreasing, and my master occasionally shutting himself up in this\nretreat, for weeks together, to write, I had many opportunities of\nimprovement. At first, considering money (I was right!\" exclaimed\nJemima, altering her tone of voice) \"as the only means, after my loss of\nreputation, of obtaining respect, or even the toleration of humanity, I\nhad not the least scruple to secrete a part of the sums intrusted to\nme, and to screen myself from detection by a system of falshood. But,\nacquiring new principles, I began to have the ambition of returning\nto the respectable part of society, and was weak enough to suppose it\npossible. The attention of my unassuming instructor, who, without being\nignorant of his own powers, possessed great simplicity of manners,\nstrengthened the illusion. Having sometimes caught up hints for thought,\nfrom my untutored remarks, he often led me to discuss the subjects he\nwas treating, and would read to me his productions, previous to their\npublication, wishing to profit by the criticism of unsophisticated\nfeeling. The aim of his writings was to touch the simple springs of\nthe heart; for he despised the would-be oracles, the self-elected\nphilosophers, who fright away fancy, while sifting each grain of thought\nto prove that slowness of comprehension is wisdom.\n\n\"I should have distinguished this as a moment of sunshine, a happy\nperiod in my life, had not the repugnance the disgusting libertinism of\nmy protector inspired, daily become more painful.--And, indeed, I soon\ndid recollect it as such with agony, when his sudden death (for he had\nrecourse to the most exhilarating cordials to keep up the convivial tone\nof his spirits) again threw me into the desert of human society. Had he\nhad any time for reflection, I am certain he would have left the little\nproperty in his power to me: but, attacked by the fatal apoplexy in\ntown, his heir, a man of rigid morals, brought his wife with him to take\npossession of the house and effects, before I was even informed of his\ndeath,--'to prevent,' as she took care indirectly to tell me, 'such a\ncreature as she supposed me to be, from purloining any of them, had I\nbeen apprized of the event in time.'\n\n\"The grief I felt at the sudden shock the information gave me, which at\nfirst had nothing selfish in it, was treated with contempt, and I was\nordered to pack up my clothes; and a few trinkets and books, given me by\nthe generous deceased, were contested, while they piously hoped, with a\nreprobating shake of the head, 'that God would have mercy on his\nsinful soul!' With some difficulty, I obtained my arrears of wages;\nbut asking--such is the spirit-grinding consequence of poverty and\ninfamy--for a character for honesty and economy, which God knows I\nmerited, I was told by this--why must I call her woman?--'that it would\ngo against her conscience to recommend a kept mistress.' Tears started\nin my eyes, burning tears; for there are situations in which a wretch is\nhumbled by the contempt they are conscious they do not deserve.\n\n\"I returned to the metropolis; but the solitude of a poor lodging was\ninconceivably dreary, after the society I had enjoyed. To be cut off\nfrom human converse, now I had been taught to relish it, was to wander a\nghost among the living. Besides, I foresaw, to aggravate the severity of\nmy fate, that my little pittance would soon melt away. I endeavoured to\nobtain needlework; but, not having been taught early, and my hands\nbeing rendered clumsy by hard work, I did not sufficiently excel to\nbe employed by the ready-made linen shops, when so many women, better\nqualified, were suing for it. The want of a character prevented my\ngetting a place; for, irksome as servitude would have been to me,\nI should have made another trial, had it been feasible. Not that I\ndisliked employment, but the inequality of condition to which I must\nhave submitted. I had acquired a taste for literature, during the five\nyears I had lived with a literary man, occasionally conversing with\nmen of the first abilities of the age; and now to descend to the lowest\nvulgarity, was a degree of wretchedness not to be imagined unfelt. I had\nnot, it is true, tasted the charms of affection, but I had been familiar\nwith the graces of humanity.\n\n\"One of the gentlemen, whom I had frequently dined in company with,\nwhile I was treated like a companion, met me in the street, and enquired\nafter my health. I seized the occasion, and began to describe my\nsituation; but he was in haste to join, at dinner, a select party of\nchoice spirits; therefore, without waiting to hear me, he impatiently\nput a guinea into my hand, saying, 'It was a pity such a sensible woman\nshould be in distress--he wished me well from his soul.'\n\n\"To another I wrote, stating my case, and requesting advice. He was\nan advocate for unequivocal sincerity; and had often, in my presence,\ndescanted on the evils which arise in society from the despotism of rank\nand riches.\n\n\"In reply, I received a long essay on the energy of the human mind, with\ncontinual allusions to his own force of character. He added, 'That the\nwoman who could write such a letter as I had sent him, could never be in\nwant of resources, were she to look into herself, and exert her powers;\nmisery was the consequence of indolence, and, as to my being shut out\nfrom society, it was the lot of man to submit to certain privations.'\n\n\"How often have I heard,\" said Jemima, interrupting her narrative, \"in\nconversation, and read in books, that every person willing to work may\nfind employment? It is the vague assertion, I believe, of insensible\nindolence, when it relates to men; but, with respect to women, I am\nsure of its fallacy, unless they will submit to the most menial bodily\nlabour; and even to be employed at hard labour is out of the reach of\nmany, whose reputation misfortune or folly has tainted.\n\n\"How writers, professing to be friends to freedom, and the improvement\nof morals, can assert that poverty is no evil, I cannot imagine.\"\n\n\"No more can I,\" interrupted Maria, \"yet they even expatiate on\nthe peculiar happiness of indigence, though in what it can consist,\nexcepting in brutal rest, when a man can barely earn a subsistence, I\ncannot imagine. The mind is necessarily imprisoned in its own little\ntenement; and, fully occupied by keeping it in repair, has not time to\nrove abroad for improvement. The book of knowledge is closely clasped,\nagainst those who must fulfil their daily task of severe manual labour\nor die; and curiosity, rarely excited by thought or information, seldom\nmoves on the stagnate lake of ignorance.\"\n\n\"As far as I have been able to observe,\" replied Jemima, \"prejudices,\ncaught up by chance, are obstinately maintained by the poor, to the\nexclusion of improvement; they have not time to reason or reflect to\nany extent, or minds sufficiently exercised to adopt the principles\nof action, which form perhaps the only basis of contentment in every\nstation.\"*\n\n     * The copy which appears to have received the author's\n     last corrections, ends at this place. [Godwin's note]\n\n\"And independence,\" said Darnford, \"they are necessarily strangers to,\neven the independence of despising their persecutors. If the poor are\nhappy, or can be happy, _things_ _are_ _very_ _well_ _as_ _they_ _are_.\nAnd I cannot conceive on what principle those writers contend for a\nchange of system, who support this opinion. The authors on the other\nside of the question are much more consistent, who grant the fact; yet,\ninsisting that it is the lot of the majority to be oppressed in this\nlife, kindly turn them over to another, to rectify the false weights\nand measures of this, as the only way to justify the dispensations of\nProvidence. I have not,\" continued Darnford, \"an opinion more firmly\nfixed by observation in my mind, than that, though riches may fail to\nproduce proportionate happiness, poverty most commonly excludes it, by\nshutting up all the avenues to improvement.\"\n\n\"And as for the affections,\" added Maria, with a sigh, \"how gross, and\neven tormenting do they become, unless regulated by an improving mind!\nThe culture of the heart ever, I believe, keeps pace with that of the\nmind. But pray go on,\" addressing Jemima, \"though your narrative gives\nrise to the most painful reflections on the present state of society.\"\n\n\"Not to trouble you,\" continued she, \"with a detailed description of all\nthe painful feelings of unavailing exertion, I have only to tell you,\nthat at last I got recommended to wash in a few families, who did me the\nfavour to admit me into their houses, without the most strict enquiry,\nto wash from one in the morning till eight at night, for eighteen or\ntwenty-pence a day. On the happiness to be enjoyed over a washing-tub\nI need not comment; yet you will allow me to observe, that this was\na wretchedness of situation peculiar to my sex. A man with half my\nindustry, and, I may say, abilities, could have procured a decent\nlivelihood, and discharged some of the duties which knit mankind\ntogether; whilst I, who had acquired a taste for the rational, nay, in\nhonest pride let me assert it, the virtuous enjoyments of life, was cast\naside as the filth of society. Condemned to labour, like a machine, only\nto earn bread, and scarcely that, I became melancholy and desperate.\n\n\"I have now to mention a circumstance which fills me with remorse, and\nfear it will entirely deprive me of your esteem. A tradesman became\nattached to me, and visited me frequently,--and I at last obtained\nsuch a power over him, that he offered to take me home to his\nhouse.--Consider, dear madam, I was famishing: wonder not that I became\na wolf!--The only reason for not taking me home immediately, was the\nhaving a girl in the house, with child by him--and this girl--I advised\nhim--yes, I did! would I could forget it!--to turn out of doors: and one\nnight he determined to follow my advice. Poor wretch! She fell upon her\nknees, reminded him that he had promised to marry her, that her parents\nwere honest!--What did it avail?--She was turned out.\n\n\"She approached her father's door, in the skirts of London,--listened at\nthe shutters,--but could not knock. A watchman had observed her go and\nreturn several times--Poor wretch!--[The remorse Jemima spoke of, seemed\nto be stinging her to the soul, as she proceeded.]\n\n\"She left it, and, approaching a tub where horses were watered, she\nsat down in it, and, with desperate resolution, remained in that\nattitude--till resolution was no longer necessary!\n\n\"I happened that morning to be going out to wash, anticipating the\nmoment when I should escape from such hard labour. I passed by, just\nas some men, going to work, drew out the stiff, cold corpse--Let me not\nrecall the horrid moment!--I recognized her pale visage; I listened to\nthe tale told by the spectators, and my heart did not burst. I thought\nof my own state, and wondered how I could be such a monster!--I worked\nhard; and, returning home, I was attacked by a fever. I suffered both in\nbody and mind. I determined not to live with the wretch. But he did not\ntry me; he left the neighbourhood. I once more returned to the wash-tub.\n\n\"Still this state, miserable as it was, admitted of aggravation. Lifting\none day a heavy load, a tub fell against my shin, and gave me great\npain. I did not pay much attention to the hurt, till it became a serious\nwound; being obliged to work as usual, or starve. But, finding myself\nat length unable to stand for any time, I thought of getting into an\nhospital. Hospitals, it should seem (for they are comfortless abodes for\nthe sick) were expressly endowed for the reception of the friendless;\nyet I, who had on that plea a right to assistance, wanted the\nrecommendation of the rich and respectable, and was several weeks\nlanguishing for admittance; fees were demanded on entering; and, what\nwas still more unreasonable, security for burying me, that expence\nnot coming into the letter of the charity. A guinea was the stipulated\nsum--I could as soon have raised a million; and I was afraid to apply\nto the parish for an order, lest they should have passed me, I knew\nnot whither. The poor woman at whose house I lodged, compassionating\nmy state, got me into the hospital; and the family where I received the\nhurt, sent me five shillings, three and six-pence of which I gave at my\nadmittance--I know not for what.\n\n\"My leg grew quickly better; but I was dismissed before my cure was\ncompleted, because I could not afford to have my linen washed to\nappear decently, as the virago of a nurse said, when the gentlemen (the\nsurgeons) came. I cannot give you an adequate idea of the wretchedness\nof an hospital; every thing is left to the care of people intent on\ngain. The attendants seem to have lost all feeling of compassion in the\nbustling discharge of their offices; death is so familiar to them,\nthat they are not anxious to ward it off. Every thing appeared to be\nconducted for the accommodation of the medical men and their pupils, who\ncame to make experiments on the poor, for the benefit of the rich. One\nof the physicians, I must not forget to mention, gave me half-a-crown,\nand ordered me some wine, when I was at the lowest ebb. I thought\nof making my case known to the lady-like matron; but her forbidding\ncountenance prevented me. She condescended to look on the patients, and\nmake general enquiries, two or three times a week; but the nurses knew\nthe hour when the visit of ceremony would commence, and every thing was\nas it should be.\n\n\"After my dismission, I was more at a loss than ever for a subsistence,\nand, not to weary you with a repetition of the same unavailing attempts,\nunable to stand at the washing-tub, I began to consider the rich and\npoor as natural enemies, and became a thief from principle. I could\nnot now cease to reason, but I hated mankind. I despised myself, yet I\njustified my conduct. I was taken, tried, and condemned to six months'\nimprisonment in a house of correction. My soul recoils with horror\nfrom the remembrance of the insults I had to endure, till, branded with\nshame, I was turned loose in the street, pennyless. I wandered from\nstreet to street, till, exhausted by hunger and fatigue, I sunk down\nsenseless at a door, where I had vainly demanded a morsel of bread. I\nwas sent by the inhabitant to the work-house, to which he had surlily\nbid me go, saying, he 'paid enough in conscience to the poor,' when,\nwith parched tongue, I implored his charity. If those well-meaning\npeople who exclaim against beggars, were acquainted with the treatment\nthe poor receive in many of these wretched asylums, they would not\nstifle so easily involuntary sympathy, by saying that they have all\nparishes to go to, or wonder that the poor dread to enter the gloomy\nwalls. What are the common run of workhouses, but prisons, in which many\nrespectable old people, worn out by immoderate labour, sink into the\ngrave in sorrow, to which they are carried like dogs!\"\n\nAlarmed by some indistinct noise, Jemima rose hastily to listen, and\nMaria, turning to Darnford, said, \"I have indeed been shocked beyond\nexpression when I have met a pauper's funeral. A coffin carried on the\nshoulders of three or four ill-looking wretches, whom the imagination\nmight easily convert into a band of assassins, hastening to conceal the\ncorpse, and quarrelling about the prey on their way. I know it is of\nlittle consequence how we are consigned to the earth; but I am led by\nthis brutal insensibility, to what even the animal creation appears\nforcibly to feel, to advert to the wretched, deserted manner in which\nthey died.\"\n\n\"True,\" rejoined Darnford, \"and, till the rich will give more than a\npart of their wealth, till they will give time and attention to the\nwants of the distressed, never let them boast of charity. Let them\nopen their hearts, and not their purses, and employ their minds in\nthe service, if they are really actuated by humanity; or charitable\ninstitutions will always be the prey of the lowest order of knaves.\"\n\nJemima returning, seemed in haste to finish her tale. \"The overseer\nfarmed the poor of different parishes, and out of the bowels of poverty\nwas wrung the money with which he purchased this dwelling, as a private\nreceptacle for madness. He had been a keeper at a house of the same\ndescription, and conceived that he could make money much more readily\nin his old occupation. He is a shrewd--shall I say it?--villain. He\nobserved something resolute in my manner, and offered to take me with\nhim, and instruct me how to treat the disturbed minds he meant to\nintrust to my care. The offer of forty pounds a year, and to quit a\nworkhouse, was not to be despised, though the condition of shutting my\neyes and hardening my heart was annexed to it.\n\n\"I agreed to accompany him; and four years have I been attendant on many\nwretches, and\"--she lowered her voice,--\"the witness of many enormities.\nIn solitude my mind seemed to recover its force, and many of the\nsentiments which I imbibed in the only tolerable period of my life,\nreturned with their full force. Still what should induce me to be the\nchampion for suffering humanity?--Who ever risked any thing for me?--Who\never acknowledged me to be a fellow-creature?\"--\n\nMaria took her hand, and Jemima, more overcome by kindness than she had\never been by cruelty, hastened out of the room to conceal her emotions.\n\nDarnford soon after heard his summons, and, taking leave of him, Maria\npromised to gratify his curiosity, with respect to herself, the first\nopportunity.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\n\nACTIVE as love was in the heart of Maria, the story she had just heard\nmade her thoughts take a wider range. The opening buds of hope closed,\nas if they had put forth too early, and the the happiest day of her life\nwas overcast by the most melancholy reflections. Thinking of Jemima's\npeculiar fate and her own, she was led to consider the oppressed state\nof women, and to lament that she had given birth to a daughter.\nSleep fled from her eyelids, while she dwelt on the wretchedness of\nunprotected infancy, till sympathy with Jemima changed to agony, when\nit seemed probable that her own babe might even now be in the very state\nshe so forcibly described.\n\nMaria thought, and thought again. Jemima's humanity had rather been\nbenumbed than killed, by the keen frost she had to brave at her entrance\ninto life; an appeal then to her feelings, on this tender point, surely\nwould not be fruitless; and Maria began to anticipate the delight it\nwould afford her to gain intelligence of her child. This project was now\nthe only subject of reflection; and she watched impatiently for the dawn\nof day, with that determinate purpose which generally insures success.\n\nAt the usual hour, Jemima brought her breakfast, and a tender note from\nDarnford. She ran her eye hastily over it, and her heart calmly hoarded\nup the rapture a fresh assurance of affection, affection such as she\nwished to inspire, gave her, without diverting her mind a moment from\nits design. While Jemima waited to take away the breakfast, Maria\nalluded to the reflections, that had haunted her during the night to\nthe exclusion of sleep. She spoke with energy of Jemima's unmerited\nsufferings, and of the fate of a number of deserted females, placed\nwithin the sweep of a whirlwind, from which it was next to impossible\nto escape. Perceiving the effect her conversation produced on the\ncountenance of her guard, she grasped the arm of Jemima with that\nirresistible warmth which defies repulse, exclaiming--\"With your heart,\nand such dreadful experience, can you lend your aid to deprive my babe\nof a mother's tenderness, a mother's care? In the name of God, assist me\nto snatch her from destruction! Let me but give her an education--let me\nbut prepare her body and mind to encounter the ills which await her sex,\nand I will teach her to consider you as her second mother, and herself\nas the prop of your age. Yes, Jemima, look at me--observe me closely,\nand read my very soul; you merit a better fate;\" she held out her hand\nwith a firm gesture of assurance; \"and I will procure it for you, as a\ntestimony of my esteem, as well as of my gratitude.\"\n\nJemima had not power to resist this persuasive torrent; and, owning that\nthe house in which she was confined, was situated on the banks of the\nThames, only a few miles from London, and not on the sea-coast, as\nDarnford had supposed, she promised to invent some excuse for her\nabsence, and go herself to trace the situation, and enquire concerning\nthe health, of this abandoned daughter. Her manner implied an intention\nto do something more, but she seemed unwilling to impart her design; and\nMaria, glad to have obtained the main point, thought it best to leave\nher to the workings of her own mind; convinced that she had the power of\ninteresting her still more in favour of herself and child, by a simple\nrecital of facts.\n\nIn the evening, Jemima informed the impatient mother, that on the morrow\nshe should hasten to town before the family hour of rising, and received\nall the information necessary, as a clue to her search. The \"Good\nnight!\" Maria uttered was peculiarly solemn and affectionate. Glad\nexpectation sparkled in her eye; and, for the first time since her\ndetention, she pronounced the name of her child with pleasureable\nfondness; and, with all the garrulity of a nurse, described her first\nsmile when she recognized her mother. Recollecting herself, a still\nkinder \"Adieu!\" with a \"God bless you!\"--that seemed to include a\nmaternal benediction, dismissed Jemima.\n\nThe dreary solitude of the ensuing day, lengthened by impatiently\ndwelling on the same idea, was intolerably wearisome. She listened\nfor the sound of a particular clock, which some directions of the wind\nallowed her to hear distinctly. She marked the shadow gaining on\nthe wall; and, twilight thickening into darkness, her breath seemed\noppressed while she anxiously counted nine.--The last sound was a stroke\nof despair on her heart; for she expected every moment, without seeing\nJemima, to have her light extinguished by the savage female who supplied\nher place. She was even obliged to prepare for bed, restless as she was,\nnot to disoblige her new attendant. She had been cautioned not to speak\ntoo freely to her; but the caution was needless, her countenance would\nstill more emphatically have made her shrink back. Such was the ferocity\nof manner, conspicuous in every word and gesture of this hag, that Maria\nwas afraid to enquire, why Jemima, who had faithfully promised to see\nher before her door was shut for the night, came not?--and, when the key\nturned in the lock, to consign her to a night of suspence, she felt a\ndegree of anguish which the circumstances scarcely justified.\n\nContinually on the watch, the shutting of a door, or the sound of a\nfoot-step, made her start and tremble with apprehension, something like\nwhat she felt, when, at her entrance, dragged along the gallery, she\nbegan to doubt whether she were not surrounded by demons?\n\nFatigued by an endless rotation of thought and wild alarms, she looked\nlike a spectre, when Jemima entered in the morning; especially as her\neyes darted out of her head, to read in Jemima's countenance, almost\nas pallid, the intelligence she dared not trust her tongue to demand.\nJemima put down the tea-things, and appeared very busy in arranging the\ntable. Maria took up a cup with trembling hand, then forcibly recovering\nher fortitude, and restraining the convulsive movement which agitated\nthe muscles of her mouth, she said, \"Spare yourself the pain of\npreparing me for your information, I adjure you!--My child is dead!\"\nJemima solemnly answered, \"Yes;\" with a look expressive of compassion\nand angry emotions. \"Leave me,\" added Maria, making a fresh effort to\ngovern her feelings, and hiding her face in her handkerchief, to conceal\nher anguish--\"It is enough--I know that my babe is no more--I will hear\nthe particulars when I am\"--calmer, she could not utter; and Jemima,\nwithout importuning her by idle attempts to console her, left the room.\n\nPlunged in the deepest melancholy, she would not admit Darnford's\nvisits; and such is the force of early associations even on strong\nminds, that, for a while, she indulged the superstitious notion that she\nwas justly punished by the death of her child, for having for an instant\nceased to regret her loss. Two or three letters from Darnford, full\nof soothing, manly tenderness, only added poignancy to these accusing\nemotions; yet the passionate style in which he expressed, what he termed\nthe first and fondest wish of his heart, \"that his affection might make\nher some amends for the cruelty and injustice she had endured,\" inspired\na sentiment of gratitude to heaven; and her eyes filled with delicious\ntears, when, at the conclusion of his letter, wishing to supply the\nplace of her unworthy relations, whose want of principle he execrated,\nhe assured her, calling her his dearest girl, \"that it should henceforth\nbe the business of his life to make her happy.\"\n\nHe begged, in a note sent the following morning, to be permitted to\nsee her, when his presence would be no intrusion on her grief, and so\nearnestly intreated to be allowed, according to promise, to beguile the\ntedious moments of absence, by dwelling on the events of her past life,\nthat she sent him the memoirs which had been written for her daughter,\npromising Jemima the perusal as soon as he returned them.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\n\n\"ADDRESSING these memoirs to you, my child, uncertain whether I shall\never have an opportunity of instructing you, many observations will\nprobably flow from my heart, which only a mother--a mother schooled in\nmisery, could make.\n\n\"The tenderness of a father who knew the world, might be great; but\ncould it equal that of a mother--of a mother, labouring under a portion\nof the misery, which the constitution of society seems to have entailed\non all her kind? It is, my child, my dearest daughter, only such a\nmother, who will dare to break through all restraint to provide for\nyour happiness--who will voluntarily brave censure herself, to ward off\nsorrow from your bosom. From my narrative, my dear girl, you may gather\nthe instruction, the counsel, which is meant rather to exercise than\ninfluence your mind.--Death may snatch me from you, before you can weigh\nmy advice, or enter into my reasoning: I would then, with fond anxiety,\nlead you very early in life to form your grand principle of action, to\nsave you from the vain regret of having, through irresolution, let\nthe spring-tide of existence pass away, unimproved, unenjoyed.--Gain\nexperience--ah! gain it--while experience is worth having, and acquire\nsufficient fortitude to pursue your own happiness; it includes your\nutility, by a direct path. What is wisdom too often, but the owl of the\ngoddess, who sits moping in a desolated heart; around me she shrieks,\nbut I would invite all the gay warblers of spring to nestle in your\nblooming bosom.--Had I not wasted years in deliberating, after I\nceased to doubt, how I ought to have acted--I might now be useful and\nhappy.--For my sake, warned by my example, always appear what you are,\nand you will not pass through existence without enjoying its genuine\nblessings, love and respect.\n\n\"Born in one of the most romantic parts of England, an enthusiastic\nfondness for the varying charms of nature is the first sentiment I\nrecollect; or rather it was the first consciousness of pleasure that\nemployed and formed my imagination.\n\n\"My father had been a captain of a man of war; but, disgusted with the\nservice, on account of the preferment of men whose chief merit was their\nfamily connections or borough interest, he retired into the country;\nand, not knowing what to do with himself--married. In his family, to\nregain his lost consequence, he determined to keep up the same passive\nobedience, as in the vessels in which he had commanded. His orders were\nnot to be disputed; and the whole house was expected to fly, at the word\nof command, as if to man the shrouds, or mount aloft in an elemental\nstrife, big with life or death. He was to be instantaneously obeyed,\nespecially by my mother, whom he very benevolently married for love;\nbut took care to remind her of the obligation, when she dared, in\nthe slightest instance, to question his absolute authority. My eldest\nbrother, it is true, as he grew up, was treated with more respect by\nmy father; and became in due form the deputy-tyrant of the house. The\nrepresentative of my father, a being privileged by nature--a boy, and\nthe darling of my mother, he did not fail to act like an heir apparent.\nSuch indeed was my mother's extravagant partiality, that, in comparison\nwith her affection for him, she might be said not to love the rest\nof her children. Yet none of the children seemed to have so little\naffection for her. Extreme indulgence had rendered him so selfish, that\nhe only thought of himself; and from tormenting insects and animals, he\nbecame the despot of his brothers, and still more of his sisters.\n\n\"It is perhaps difficult to give you an idea of the petty cares which\nobscured the morning of my life; continual restraint in the most trivial\nmatters; unconditional submission to orders, which, as a mere child,\nI soon discovered to be unreasonable, because inconsistent and\ncontradictory. Thus are we destined to experience a mixture of\nbitterness, with the recollection of our most innocent enjoyments.\n\n\"The circumstances which, during my childhood, occurred to fashion my\nmind, were various; yet, as it would probably afford me more pleasure\nto revive the fading remembrance of newborn delight, than you, my child,\ncould feel in the perusal, I will not entice you to stray with me\ninto the verdant meadow, to search for the flowers that youthful hopes\nscatter in every path; though, as I write, I almost scent the fresh\ngreen of spring--of that spring which never returns!\n\n\"I had two sisters, and one brother, younger than myself, my brother\nRobert was two years older, and might truly be termed the idol of his\nparents, and the torment of the rest of the family. Such indeed is the\nforce of prejudice, that what was called spirit and wit in him, was\ncruelly repressed as forwardness in me.\n\n\"My mother had an indolence of character, which prevented her from\npaying much attention to our education. But the healthy breeze of a\nneighbouring heath, on which we bounded at pleasure, volatilized the\nhumours that improper food might have generated. And to enjoy open\nair and freedom, was paradise, after the unnatural restraint of our\nfireside, where we were often obliged to sit three or four hours\ntogether, without daring to utter a word, when my father was out\nof humour, from want of employment, or of a variety of boisterous\namusement. I had however one advantage, an instructor, the brother of my\nfather, who, intended for the church, had of course received a liberal\neducation. But, becoming attached to a young lady of great beauty and\nlarge fortune, and acquiring in the world some opinions not consonant\nwith the profession for which he was designed, he accepted, with the\nmost sanguine expectations of success, the offer of a nobleman to\naccompany him to India, as his confidential secretary.\n\n\"A correspondence was regularly kept up with the object of his\naffection; and the intricacies of business, peculiarly wearisome to a\nman of a romantic turn of mind, contributed, with a forced absence,\nto increase his attachment. Every other passion was lost in this\nmaster-one, and only served to swell the torrent. Her relations, such\nwere his waking dreams, who had despised him, would court in their turn\nhis alliance, and all the blandishments of taste would grace the triumph\nof love.--While he basked in the warm sunshine of love, friendship also\npromised to shed its dewy freshness; for a friend, whom he loved next to\nhis mistress, was the confident, who forwarded the letters from one to\nthe other, to elude the observation of prying relations. A friend false\nin similar circumstances, is, my dearest girl, an old tale; yet, let not\nthis example, or the frigid caution of coldblooded moralists, make you\nendeavour to stifle hopes, which are the buds that naturally unfold\nthemselves during the spring of life! Whilst your own heart is sincere,\nalways expect to meet one glowing with the same sentiments; for to fly\nfrom pleasure, is not to avoid pain!\n\n\"My uncle realized, by good luck, rather than management, a handsome\nfortune; and returning on the wings of love, lost in the most enchanting\nreveries, to England, to share it with his mistress and his friend, he\nfound them--united.\n\n\"There were some circumstances, not necessary for me to recite, which\naggravated the guilt of the friend beyond measure, and the deception,\nthat had been carried on to the last moment, was so base, it produced\nthe most violent effect on my uncle's health and spirits. His native\ncountry, the world! lately a garden of blooming sweets, blasted by\ntreachery, seemed changed into a parched desert, the abode of hissing\nserpents. Disappointment rankled in his heart; and, brooding over his\nwrongs, he was attacked by a raging fever, followed by a derangement of\nmind, which only gave place to habitual melancholy, as he recovered more\nstrength of body.\n\n\"Declaring an intention never to marry, his relations were ever\nclustering about him, paying the grossest adulation to a man, who,\ndisgusted with mankind, received them with scorn, or bitter sarcasms.\nSomething in my countenance pleased him, when I began to prattle. Since\nhis return, he appeared dead to affection; but I soon, by showing him\ninnocent fondness, became a favourite; and endeavouring to enlarge and\nstrengthen my mind, I grew dear to him in proportion as I imbibed his\nsentiments. He had a forcible manner of speaking, rendered more so by\na certain impressive wildness of look and gesture, calculated to engage\nthe attention of a young and ardent mind. It is not then surprising that\nI quickly adopted his opinions in preference, and reverenced him as\none of a superior order of beings. He inculcated, with great warmth,\nself-respect, and a lofty consciousness of acting right, independent of\nthe censure or applause of the world; nay, he almost taught me to brave,\nand even despise its censure, when convinced of the rectitude of my own\nintentions.\n\n\"Endeavouring to prove to me that nothing which deserved the name of\nlove or friendship, existed in the world, he drew such animated pictures\nof his own feelings, rendered permanent by disappointment, as imprinted\nthe sentiments strongly on my heart, and animated my imagination. These\nremarks are necessary to elucidate some peculiarities in my character,\nwhich by the world are indefinitely termed romantic.\n\n\"My uncle's increasing affection led him to visit me often. Still,\nunable to rest in any place, he did not remain long in the country to\nsoften domestic tyranny; but he brought me books, for which I had a\npassion, and they conspired with his conversation, to make me form an\nideal picture of life. I shall pass over the tyranny of my father, much\nas I suffered from it; but it is necessary to notice, that it undermined\nmy mother's health; and that her temper, continually irritated by\ndomestic bickering, became intolerably peevish.\n\n\"My eldest brother was articled to a neighbouring attorney, the\nshrewdest, and, I may add, the most unprincipled man in that part of the\ncountry. As my brother generally came home every Saturday, to astonish\nmy mother by exhibiting his attainments, he gradually assumed a right of\ndirecting the whole family, not excepting my father. He seemed to take a\npeculiar pleasure in tormenting and humbling me; and if I ever ventured\nto complain of this treatment to either my father or mother, I was\nrudely rebuffed for presuming to judge of the conduct of my eldest\nbrother.\n\n\"About this period a merchant's family came to settle in our\nneighbourhood. A mansion-house in the village, lately purchased, had\nbeen preparing the whole spring, and the sight of the costly furniture,\nsent from London, had excited my mother's envy, and roused my father's\npride. My sensations were very different, and all of a pleasurable kind.\nI longed to see new characters, to break the tedious monotony of my\nlife; and to find a friend, such as fancy had pourtrayed. I cannot then\ndescribe the emotion I felt, the Sunday they made their appearance at\nchurch. My eyes were rivetted on the pillar round which I expected\nfirst to catch a glimpse of them, and darted forth to meet a servant who\nhastily preceded a group of ladies, whose white robes and waving plumes,\nseemed to stream along the gloomy aisle, diffusing the light, by which I\ncontemplated their figures.\n\n\"We visited them in form; and I quickly selected the eldest daughter\nfor my friend. The second son, George, paid me particular attention, and\nfinding his attainments and manners superior to those of the young men\nof the village, I began to imagine him superior to the rest of mankind.\nHad my home been more comfortable, or my previous acquaintance more\nnumerous, I should not probably have been so eager to open my heart to\nnew affections.\n\n\"Mr. Venables, the merchant, had acquired a large fortune by unremitting\nattention to business; but his health declining rapidly, he was obliged\nto retire, before his son, George, had acquired sufficient experience,\nto enable him to conduct their affairs on the same prudential plan, his\nfather had invariably pursued. Indeed, he had laboured to throw off his\nauthority, having despised his narrow plans and cautious speculation.\nThe eldest son could not be prevailed on to enter the firm; and, to\noblige his wife, and have peace in the house, Mr. Venables had purchased\na commission for him in the guards.\n\n\"I am now alluding to circumstances which came to my knowledge long\nafter; but it is necessary, my dearest child, that you should know the\ncharacter of your father, to prevent your despising your mother; the\nonly parent inclined to discharge a parent's duty. In London, George had\nacquired habits of libertinism, which he carefully concealed from his\nfather and his commercial connections. The mask he wore, was so complete\na covering of his real visage, that the praise his father lavished on\nhis conduct, and, poor mistaken man! on his principles, contrasted with\nhis brother's, rendered the notice he took of me peculiarly flattering.\nWithout any fixed design, as I am now convinced, he continued to single\nme out at the dance, press my hand at parting, and utter expressions of\nunmeaning passion, to which I gave a meaning naturally suggested by the\nromantic turn of my thoughts. His stay in the country was short; his\nmanners did not entirely please me; but, when he left us, the colouring\nof my picture became more vivid--Whither did not my imagination lead me?\nIn short, I fancied myself in love--in love with the disinterestedness,\nfortitude, generosity, dignity, and humanity, with which I had invested\nthe hero I dubbed. A circumstance which soon after occurred, rendered\nall these virtues palpable. [The incident is perhaps worth relating on\nother accounts, and therefore I shall describe it distinctly.]\n\n\"I had a great affection for my nurse, old Mary, for whom I used often\nto work, to spare her eyes. Mary had a younger sister, married to a\nsailor, while she was suckling me; for my mother only suckled my eldest\nbrother, which might be the cause of her extraordinary partiality.\nPeggy, Mary's sister, lived with her, till her husband, becoming a mate\nin a West-Indian trader, got a little before-hand in the world. He\nwrote to his wife from the first port in the Channel, after his most\nsuccessful voyage, to request her to come to London to meet him; he even\nwished her to determine on living there for the future, to save him\nthe trouble of coming to her the moment he came on shore; and to turn a\npenny by keeping a green-stall. It was too much to set out on a journey\nthe moment he had finished a voyage, and fifty miles by land, was worse\nthan a thousand leagues by sea.\n\n\"She packed up her alls, and came to London--but did not meet honest\nDaniel. A common misfortune prevented her, and the poor are bound to\nsuffer for the good of their country--he was pressed in the river--and\nnever came on shore.\n\n\"Peggy was miserable in London, not knowing, as she said, 'the face\nof any living soul.' Besides, her imagination had been employed,\nanticipating a month or six weeks' happiness with her husband. Daniel\nwas to have gone with her to Sadler's Wells, and Westminster Abbey, and\nto many sights, which he knew she never heard of in the country. Peggy\ntoo was thrifty, and how could she manage to put his plan in execution\nalone? He had acquaintance; but she did not know the very name of their\nplaces of abode. His letters were made up of--How do you does, and God\nbless yous,--information was reserved for the hour of meeting.\n\n\"She too had her portion of information, near at heart. Molly and Jacky\nwere grown such little darlings, she was almost angry that daddy did not\nsee their tricks. She had not half the pleasure she should have had from\ntheir prattle, could she have recounted to him each night the pretty\nspeeches of the day. Some stories, however, were stored up--and Jacky\ncould say papa with such a sweet voice, it must delight his heart. Yet\nwhen she came, and found no Daniel to greet her, when Jacky called papa,\nshe wept, bidding 'God bless his innocent soul, that did not know what\nsorrow was.'--But more sorrow was in store for Peggy, innocent as she\nwas.--Daniel was killed in the first engagement, and then the papa was\nagony, sounding to the heart.\n\n\"She had lived sparingly on his wages, while there was any hope of\nhis return; but, that gone, she returned with a breaking heart to the\ncountry, to a little market town, nearly three miles from our village.\nShe did not like to go to service, to be snubbed about, after being her\nown mistress. To put her children out to nurse was impossible: how far\nwould her wages go? and to send them to her husband's parish, a distant\none, was to lose her husband twice over.\n\n\"I had heard all from Mary, and made my uncle furnish a little cottage\nfor her, to enable her to sell--so sacred was poor Daniel's advice, now\nhe was dead and gone a little fruit, toys and cakes. The minding of the\nshop did not require her whole time, nor even the keeping her children\nclean, and she loved to see them clean; so she took in washing, and\naltogether made a shift to earn bread for her children, still weeping\nfor Daniel, when Jacky's arch looks made her think of his father.--It\nwas pleasant to work for her children.--'Yes; from morning till night,\ncould she have had a kiss from their father, God rest his soul! Yes; had\nit pleased Providence to have let him come back without a leg or an\narm, it would have been the same thing to her--for she did not love him\nbecause he maintained them--no; she had hands of her own.'\n\n\"The country people were honest, and Peggy left her linen out to dry\nvery late. A recruiting party, as she supposed, passing through, made\nfree with a large wash; for it was all swept away, including her own and\nher children's little stock.\n\n\"This was a dreadful blow; two dozen of shirts, stocks and\nhandkerchiefs. She gave the money which she had laid by for half a\nyear's rent, and promised to pay two shillings a week till all was\ncleared; so she did not lose her employment. This two shillings a week,\nand the buying a few necessaries for the children, drove her so hard,\nthat she had not a penny to pay her rent with, when a twelvemonth's\nbecame due.\n\n\"She was now with Mary, and had just told her tale, which Mary instantly\nrepeated--it was intended for my ear. Many houses in this town,\nproducing a borough-interest, were included in the estate purchased by\nMr. Venables, and the attorney with whom my brother lived, was appointed\nhis agent, to collect and raise the rents.\n\n\"He demanded Peggy's, and, in spite of her intreaties, her poor goods\nhad been seized and sold. So that she had not, and what was worse her\nchildren, 'for she had known sorrow enough,' a bed to lie on. She knew\nthat I was good-natured--right charitable, yet not liking to ask for\nmore than needs must, she scorned to petition while people could any how\nbe made to wait. But now, should she be turned out of doors, she must\nexpect nothing less than to lose all her customers, and then she must\nbeg or starve--and what would become of her children?--'had Daniel not\nbeen pressed--but God knows best--all this could not have happened.'\n\n\"I had two mattresses on my bed; what did I want with two, when such a\nworthy creature must lie on the ground? My mother would be angry, but I\ncould conceal it till my uncle came down; and then I would tell him all\nthe whole truth, and if he absolved me, heaven would.\n\n\"I begged the house-maid to come up stairs with me (servants always feel\nfor the distresses of poverty, and so would the rich if they knew what\nit was). She assisted me to tie up the mattrass; I discovering, at the\nsame time, that one blanket would serve me till winter, could I persuade\nmy sister, who slept with me, to keep my secret. She entering in the\nmidst of the package, I gave her some new feathers, to silence her.\nWe got the mattrass down the back stairs, unperceived, and I helped to\ncarry it, taking with me all the money I had, and what I could borrow\nfrom my sister.\n\n\"When I got to the cottage, Peggy declared that she would not take what\nI had brought secretly; but, when, with all the eager eloquence inspired\nby a decided purpose, I grasped her hand with weeping eyes, assuring her\nthat my uncle would screen me from blame, when he was once more in the\ncountry, describing, at the same time, what she would suffer in parting\nwith her children, after keeping them so long from being thrown on the\nparish, she reluctantly consented.\n\n\"My project of usefulness ended not here; I determined to speak to\nthe attorney; he frequently paid me compliments. His character did not\nintimidate me; but, imagining that Peggy must be mistaken, and that\nno man could turn a deaf ear to such a tale of complicated distress, I\ndetermined to walk to the town with Mary the next morning, and request\nhim to wait for the rent, and keep my secret, till my uncle's return.\n\n\"My repose was sweet; and, waking with the first dawn of day, I bounded\nto Mary's cottage. What charms do not a light heart spread over nature!\nEvery bird that twittered in a bush, every flower that enlivened the\nhedge, seemed placed there to awaken me to rapture--yes; to rapture.\nThe present moment was full fraught with happiness; and on futurity\nI bestowed not a thought, excepting to anticipate my success with the\nattorney.\n\n\"This man of the world, with rosy face and simpering features, received\nme politely, nay kindly; listened with complacency to my remonstrances,\nthough he scarcely heeded Mary's tears. I did not then suspect, that my\neloquence was in my complexion, the blush of seventeen, or that, in\na world where humanity to women is the characteristic of advancing\ncivilization, the beauty of a young girl was so much more interesting\nthan the distress of an old one. Pressing my hand, he promised to let\nPeggy remain in the house as long as I wished.--I more than returned\nthe pressure--I was so grateful and so happy. Emboldened by my innocent\nwarmth, he then kissed me--and I did not draw back--I took it for a kiss\nof charity.\n\n\"Gay as a lark, I went to dine at Mr. Venables'. I had previously\nobtained five shillings from my father, towards re-clothing the poor\nchildren of my care, and prevailed on my mother to take one of the girls\ninto the house, whom I determined to teach to work and read.\n\n\"After dinner, when the younger part of the circle retired to the music\nroom, I recounted with energy my tale; that is, I mentioned Peggy's\ndistress, without hinting at the steps I had taken to relieve her. Miss\nVenables gave me half-a-crown; the heir five shillings; but George sat\nunmoved. I was cruelly distressed by the disappointment--I scarcely\ncould remain on my chair; and, could I have got out of the room\nunperceived, I should have flown home, as if to run away from myself.\nAfter several vain attempts to rise, I leaned my head against the marble\nchimney-piece, and gazing on the evergreens that filled the fire-place,\nmoralized on the vanity of human expectations; regardless of the\ncompany. I was roused by a gentle tap on my shoulder from behind\nCharlotte's chair. I turned my head, and George slid a guinea into my\nhand, putting his finger to his mouth, to enjoin me silence.\n\n\"What a revolution took place, not only in my train of thoughts, but\nfeelings! I trembled with emotion--now, indeed, I was in love. Such\ndelicacy too, to enhance his benevolence! I felt in my pocket every five\nminutes, only to feel the guinea; and its magic touch invested my hero\nwith more than mortal beauty. My fancy had found a basis to erect its\nmodel of perfection on; and quickly went to work, with all the happy\ncredulity of youth, to consider that heart as devoted to virtue, which\nhad only obeyed a virtuous impulse. The bitter experience was yet to\ncome, that has taught me how very distinct are the principles of virtue,\nfrom the casual feelings from which they germinate.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\n\n\"I HAVE perhaps dwelt too long on a circumstance, which is only of\nimportance as it marks the progress of a deception that has been so\nfatal to my peace; and introduces to your notice a poor girl, whom,\nintending to serve, I led to ruin. Still it is probable that I was\nnot entirely the victim of mistake; and that your father, gradually\nfashioned by the world, did not quickly become what I hesitate to call\nhim--out of respect to my daughter.\n\n\"But, to hasten to the more busy scenes of my life. Mr. Venables and my\nmother died the same summer; and, wholly engrossed by my attention to\nher, I thought of little else. The neglect of her darling, my brother\nRobert, had a violent effect on her weakened mind; for, though boys may\nbe reckoned the pillars of the house without doors, girls are often\nthe only comfort within. They but too frequently waste their health\nand spirits attending a dying parent, who leaves them in comparative\npoverty. After closing, with filial piety, a father's eyes, they are\nchased from the paternal roof, to make room for the first-born, the\nson, who is to carry the empty family-name down to posterity; though,\noccupied with his own pleasures, he scarcely thought of discharging, in\nthe decline of his parent's life, the debt contracted in his childhood.\nMy mother's conduct led me to make these reflections. Great as was the\nfatigue I endured, and the affection my unceasing solicitude evinced, of\nwhich my mother seemed perfectly sensible, still, when my brother, whom\nI could hardly persuade to remain a quarter of an hour in her chamber,\nwas with her alone, a short time before her death, she gave him a little\nhoard, which she had been some years accumulating.\n\n\"During my mother's illness, I was obliged to manage my father's temper,\nwho, from the lingering nature of her malady, began to imagine that\nit was merely fancy. At this period, an artful kind of upper servant\nattracted my father's attention, and the neighbours made many remarks\non the finery, not honestly got, exhibited at evening service. But I was\ntoo much occupied with my mother to observe any change in her dress or\nbehaviour, or to listen to the whisper of scandal.\n\n\"I shall not dwell on the death-bed scene, lively as is the remembrance,\nor on the emotion produced by the last grasp of my mother's cold hand;\nwhen blessing me, she added, 'A little patience, and all will be over!'\nAh! my child, how often have those words rung mournfully in my ears--and\nI have exclaimed--'A little more patience, and I too shall be at rest!'\n\n\"My father was violently affected by her death, recollected instances of\nhis unkindness, and wept like a child.\n\n\"My mother had solemnly recommended my sisters to my care, and bid me\nbe a mother to them. They, indeed, became more dear to me as they became\nmore forlorn; for, during my mother's illness, I discovered the ruined\nstate of my father's circumstances, and that he had only been able to\nkeep up appearances, by the sums which he borrowed of my uncle.\n\n\"My father's grief, and consequent tenderness to his children, quickly\nabated, the house grew still more gloomy or riotous; and my refuge from\ncare was again at Mr. Venables'; the young 'squire having taken his\nfather's place, and allowing, for the present, his sister to preside at\nhis table. George, though dissatisfied with his portion of the fortune,\nwhich had till lately been all in trade, visited the family as usual.\nHe was now full of speculations in trade, and his brow became clouded by\ncare. He seemed to relax in his attention to me, when the presence of\nmy uncle gave a new turn to his behaviour. I was too unsuspecting, too\ndisinterested, to trace these changes to their source.\n\n\"My home every day became more and more disagreeable to me; my liberty\nwas unnecessarily abridged, and my books, on the pretext that they made\nme idle, taken from me. My father's mistress was with child, and he,\ndoating on her, allowed or overlooked her vulgar manner of tyrannizing\nover us. I was indignant, especially when I saw her endeavouring to\nattract, shall I say seduce? my younger brother. By allowing women but\none way of rising in the world, the fostering the libertinism of men,\nsociety makes monsters of them, and then their ignoble vices are brought\nforward as a proof of inferiority of intellect.\n\n\"The wearisomeness of my situation can scarcely be described. Though\nmy life had not passed in the most even tenour with my mother, it was\nparadise to that I was destined to endure with my father's mistress,\njealous of her illegitimate authority. My father's former occasional\ntenderness, in spite of his violence of temper, had been soothing to\nme; but now he only met me with reproofs or portentous frowns. The\nhouse-keeper, as she was now termed, was the vulgar despot of the\nfamily; and assuming the new character of a fine lady, she could never\nforgive the contempt which was sometimes visible in my countenance, when\nshe uttered with pomposity her bad English, or affected to be well bred.\n\n\"To my uncle I ventured to open my heart; and he, with his wonted\nbenevolence, began to consider in what manner he could extricate me out\nof my present irksome situation. In spite of his own disappointment,\nor, most probably, actuated by the feelings that had been petrified, not\ncooled, in all their sanguine fervour, like a boiling torrent of\nlava suddenly dash ing into the sea, he thought a marriage of mutual\ninclination (would envious stars permit it) the only chance for\nhappiness in this disastrous world. George Venables had the reputation\nof being attentive to business, and my father's example gave great\nweight to this circumstance; for habits of order in business would, he\nconceived, extend to the regulation of the affections in domestic life.\nGeorge seldom spoke in my uncle's company, except to utter a short,\njudicious question, or to make a pertinent remark, with all due\ndeference to his superior judgment; so that my uncle seldom left his\ncompany without observing, that the young man had more in him than\npeople supposed.\n\n\"In this opinion he was not singular; yet, believe me, and I am not\nswayed by resentment, these speeches so justly poized, this silent\ndeference, when the animal spirits of other young people were throwing\noff youthful ebullitions, were not the effect of thought or humility,\nbut sheer barrenness of mind, and want of imagination. A colt of mettle\nwill curvet and shew his paces. Yes; my dear girl, these prudent young\nmen want all the fire necessary to ferment their faculties, and are\ncharacterized as wise, only because they are not foolish. It is true,\nthat George was by no means so great a favourite of mine as during the\nfirst year of our acquaintance; still, as he often coincided in\nopinion with me, and echoed my sentiments; and having myself no other\nattachment, I heard with pleasure my uncle's proposal; but thought more\nof obtaining my freedom, than of my lover. But, when George, seemingly\nanxious for my happiness, pressed me to quit my present painful\nsituation, my heart swelled with gratitude--I knew not that my uncle had\npromised him five thousand pounds.\n\n\"Had this truly generous man mentioned his intention to me, I should\nhave insisted on a thousand pounds being settled on each of my sisters;\nGeorge would have contested; I should have seen his selfish soul;\nand--gracious God! have been spared the misery of discovering, when\ntoo late, that I was united to a heartless, unprincipled wretch. All my\nschemes of usefulness would not then have been blasted. The tenderness\nof my heart would not have heated my imagination with visions of the\nineffable delight of happy love; nor would the sweet duty of a mother\nhave been so cruelly interrupted.\n\n\"But I must not suffer the fortitude I have so hardly acquired, to be\nundermined by unavailing regret. Let me hasten forward to describe the\nturbid stream in which I had to wade--but let me exultingly declare\nthat it is passed--my soul holds fellowship with him no more. He cut\nthe Gordian knot, which my principles, mistaken ones, respected; he\ndissolved the tie, the fetters rather, that ate into my very vitals--and\nI should rejoice, conscious that my mind is freed, though confined in\nhell itself, the only place that even fancy can imagine more dreadful\nthan my present abode.\n\n\"These varying emotions will not allow me to proceed. I heave sigh after\nsigh; yet my heart is still oppressed. For what am I reserved? Why was I\nnot born a man, or why was I born at all?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\n\n\"I RESUME my pen to fly from thought. I was married; and we hastened to\nLondon. I had purposed taking one of my sisters with me; for a strong\nmotive for marrying, was the desire of having a home at which I could\nreceive them, now their own grew so uncomfortable, as not to deserve the\ncheering appellation. An objection was made to her accompanying me,\nthat appeared plausible; and I reluctantly acquiesced. I was however\nwillingly allowed to take with me Molly, poor Peggy's daughter. London\nand preferment, are ideas commonly associated in the country; and, as\nblooming as May, she bade adieu to Peggy with weeping eyes. I did not\neven feel hurt at the refusal in relation to my sister, till hearing\nwhat my uncle had done for me, I had the simplicity to request, speaking\nwith warmth of their situation, that he would give them a thousand\npounds a-piece, which seemed to me but justice. He asked me, giving me\na kiss, 'If I had lost my senses?' I started back, as if I had found\na wasp in a rose-bush. I expostulated. He sneered: and the demon of\ndiscord entered our paradise, to poison with his pestiferous breath\nevery opening joy.\n\n\"I had sometimes observed defects in my husband's understanding; but,\nled astray by a prevailing opinion, that goodness of disposition is of\nthe first importance in the relative situations of life, in proportion\nas I perceived the narrowness of his understanding, fancy enlarged the\nboundary of his heart. Fatal error! How quickly is the so much vaunted\nmilkiness of nature turned into gall, by an intercourse with the world,\nif more generous juices do not sustain the vital source of virtue!\n\n\"One trait in my character was extreme credulity; but, when my eyes\nwere once opened, I saw but too clearly all I had before overlooked. My\nhusband was sunk in my esteem; still there are youthful emotions, which,\nfor a while, fill up the chasm of love and friendship. Besides, it\nrequired some time to enable me to see his whole character in a just\nlight, or rather to allow it to become fixed. While circumstances were\nripening my faculties, and cultivating my taste, commerce and gross\nrelaxations were shutting his against any possibility of improvement,\ntill, by stifling every spark of virtue in himself, he began to imagine\nthat it no where existed.\n\n\"Do not let me lead you astray, my child, I do not mean to assert, that\nany human being is entirely incapable of feeling the generous emotions,\nwhich are the foundation of every true principle of virtue; but they are\nfrequently, I fear, so feeble, that, like the inflammable quality which\nmore or less lurks in all bodies, they often lie for ever dormant; the\ncircumstances never occurring, necessary to call them into action.\n\n\"I discovered however by chance, that, in consequence of some losses in\ntrade, the natural effect of his gambling desire to start suddenly into\nriches, the five thousand pounds given me by my uncle, had been\npaid very opportunely. This discovery, strange as you may think the\nassertion, gave me pleasure; my husband's embarrassments endeared him to\nme. I was glad to find an excuse for his conduct to my sisters, and my\nmind became calmer.\n\n\"My uncle introduced me to some literary society; and the theatres were\na never-failing source of amusement to me. My delighted eye followed\nMrs. Siddons, when, with dignified delicacy, she played Califta; and\nI involuntarily repeated after her, in the same tone, and with a\nlong-drawn sigh,\n\n'Hearts like our's were pair'd--not match'd.'\n\n\"These were, at first, spontaneous emotions, though, becoming acquainted\nwith men of wit and polished manners, I could not sometimes help\nregretting my early marriage; and that, in my haste to escape from a\ntemporary dependence, and expand my newly fledged wings, in an unknown\nsky, I had been caught in a trap, and caged for life. Still the novelty\nof London, and the attentive fondness of my husband, for he had some\npersonal regard for me, made several months glide away. Yet, not\nforgetting the situation of my sisters, who were still very young, I\nprevailed on my uncle to settle a thousand pounds on each; and to place\nthem in a school near town, where I could frequently visit, as well as\nhave them at home with me.\n\n\"I now tried to improve my husband's taste, but we had few subjects in\ncommon; indeed he soon appeared to have little relish for my society,\nunless he was hinting to me the use he could make of my uncle's wealth.\nWhen we had company, I was disgusted by an ostentatious display of\nriches, and I have often quitted the room, to avoid listening to\nexaggerated tales of money obtained by lucky hits.\n\n\"With all my attention and affectionate interest, I perceived that I\ncould not become the friend or confident of my husband. Every thing I\nlearned relative to his affairs I gathered up by accident; and I vainly\nendeavoured to establish, at our fire-side, that social converse,\nwhich often renders people of different characters dear to each other.\nReturning from the theatre, or any amusing party, I frequently began to\nrelate what I had seen and highly relished; but with sullen taciturnity\nhe soon silenced me. I seemed therefore gradually to lose, in his\nsociety, the soul, the energies of which had just been in action. To\nsuch a degree, in fact, did his cold, reserved manner affect me, that,\nafter spending some days with him alone, I have imagined myself the most\nstupid creature in the world, till the abilities of some casual visitor\nconvinced me that I had some dormant animation, and sentiments above the\ndust in which I had been groveling. The very countenance of my husband\nchanged; his complexion became sallow, and all the charms of youth were\nvanishing with its vivacity.\n\n\"I give you one view of the subject; but these experiments and\nalterations took up the space of five years; during which period, I\nhad most reluctantly extorted several sums from my uncle, to save my\nhusband, to use his own words, from destruction. At first it was to\nprevent bills being noted, to the injury of his credit; then to bail\nhim; and afterwards to prevent an execution from entering the house. I\nbegan at last to conclude, that he would have made more exertions of his\nown to extricate himself, had he not relied on mine, cruel as was the\ntask he imposed on me; and I firmly determined that I would make use of\nno more pretexts.\n\n\"From the moment I pronounced this determination, indifference on his\npart was changed into rudeness, or something worse.\n\n\"He now seldom dined at home, and continually returned at a late hour,\ndrunk, to bed. I retired to another apartment; I was glad, I own, to\nescape from his; for personal intimacy without affection, seemed, to me\nthe most degrading, as well as the most painful state in which a\nwoman of any taste, not to speak of the peculiar delicacy of fostered\nsensibility, could be placed. But my husband's fondness for women was of\nthe grossest kind, and imagination was so wholly out of the question, as\nto render his indulgences of this sort entirely promiscuous, and of the\nmost brutal nature. My health suffered, before my heart was entirely\nestranged by the loathsome information; could I then have returned to\nhis sullied arms, but as a victim to the prejudices of mankind, who have\nmade women the property of their husbands? I discovered even, by his\nconversation, when intoxicated that his favourites were wantons of the\nlowest class, who could by their vulgar, indecent mirth, which he called\nnature, rouse his sluggish spirits. Meretricious ornaments and manners\nwere necessary to attract his attention. He seldom looked twice at a\nmodest woman, and sat silent in their company; and the charms of youth\nand beauty had not the slightest effect on his senses, unless the\npossessors were initiated in vice. His intimacy with profligate women,\nand his habits of thinking, gave him a contempt for female endowments;\nand he would repeat, when wine had loosed his tongue, most of the\ncommon-place sarcasms levelled at them, by men who do not allow them to\nhave minds, because mind would be an impediment to gross enjoyment.\nMen who are inferior to their fellow men, are always most anxious to\nestablish their superiority over women. But where are these reflections\nleading me?\n\n\"Women who have lost their husband's affection, are justly reproved for\nneglecting their persons, and not taking the same pains to keep, as to\ngain a heart; but who thinks of giving the same advice to men, though\nwomen are continually stigmatized for being attached to fops; and from\nthe nature of their education, are more susceptible of disgust? Yet why\na woman should be expected to endure a sloven, with more patience than\na man, and magnanimously to govern herself, I cannot conceive; unless\nit be supposed arrogant in her to look for respect as well as a\nmaintenance. It is not easy to be pleased, because, after promising to\nlove, in different circumstances, we are told that it is our duty.\nI cannot, I am sure (though, when attending the sick, I never felt\ndisgust) forget my own sensations, when rising with health and spirit,\nand after scenting the sweet morning, I have met my husband at the\nbreakfast table. The active attention I had been giving to domestic\nregulations, which were generally settled before he rose, or a walk,\ngave a glow to my countenance, that contrasted with his squallid\nappearance. The squeamishness of stomach alone, produced by the last\nnight's intemperance, which he took no pains to conceal, destroyed my\nappetite. I think I now see him lolling in an arm-chair, in a dirty\npowdering gown, soiled linen, ungartered stockings, and tangled hair,\nyawning and stretching himself. The newspaper was immediately called\nfor, if not brought in on the tea-board, from which he would scarcely\nlift his eyes while I poured out the tea, excepting to ask for some\nbrandy to put into it, or to declare that he could not eat. In answer\nto any question, in his best humour, it was a drawling 'What do you say,\nchild?' But if I demanded money for the house expences, which I put off\ntill the last moment, his customary reply, often prefaced with an oath,\nwas, 'Do you think me, madam, made of money?'--The butcher, the baker,\nmust wait; and, what was worse, I was often obliged to witness his surly\ndismission of tradesmen, who were in want of their money, and whom I\nsometimes paid with the presents my uncle gave me for my own use.\n\n\"At this juncture my father's mistress, by terrifying his conscience,\nprevailed on him to marry her; he was already become a methodist; and\nmy brother, who now practised for himself, had discovered a flaw in\nthe settlement made on my mother's children, which set it aside, and he\nallowed my father, whose distress made him submit to any thing, a tithe\nof his own, or rather our fortune.\n\n\"My sisters had left school, but were unable to endure home, which my\nfather's wife rendered as disagreeable as possible, to get rid of girls\nwhom she regarded as spies on her conduct. They were accomplished, yet\nyou can (may you never be reduced to the same destitute state!)\nscarcely conceive the trouble I had to place them in the situation of\ngovernesses, the only one in which even a well-educated woman, with more\nthan ordinary talents, can struggle for a subsistence; and even this is\na dependence next to menial. Is it then surprising, that so many forlorn\nwomen, with human passions and feelings, take refuge in infamy? Alone\nin large mansions, I say alone, because they had no companions with whom\nthey could converse on equal terms, or from whom they could expect the\nendearments of affection, they grew melancholy, and the sound of joy\nmade them sad; and the youngest, having a more delicate frame, fell into\na decline. It was with great difficulty that I, who now almost supported\nthe house by loans from my uncle, could prevail on the _master_ of it,\nto allow her a room to die in. I watched her sick bed for some months,\nand then closed her eyes, gentle spirit! for ever. She was pretty, with\nvery engaging manners; yet had never an opportunity to marry, excepting\nto a very old man. She had abilities sufficient to have shone in any\nprofession, had there been any professions for women, though she shrunk\nat the name of milliner or mantua-maker as degrading to a gentlewoman.\nI would not term this feeling false pride to any one but you, my child,\nwhom I fondly hope to see (yes; I will indulge the hope for a moment!)\npossessed of that energy of character which gives dignity to any\nstation; and with that clear, firm spirit that will enable you to choose\na situation for yourself, or submit to be classed in the lowest, if it\nbe the only one in which you can be the mistress of your own actions.\n\n\"Soon after the death of my sister, an incident occurred, to prove to\nme that the heart of a libertine is dead to natural affection; and to\nconvince me, that the being who has appeared all tenderness, to gratify\na selfish passion, is as regardless of the innocent fruit of it, as\nof the object, when the fit is over. I had casually observed an old,\nmeanlooking woman, who called on my husband every two or three months\nto receive some money. One day entering the passage of his little\ncounting-house, as she was going out, I heard her say, 'The child is\nvery weak; she cannot live long, she will soon die out of your way, so\nyou need not grudge her a little physic.'\n\n\"'So much the better,' he replied,' and pray mind your own business,\ngood woman.'\n\n\"I was struck by his unfeeling, inhuman tone of voice, and drew back,\ndetermined when the woman came again, to try to speak to her, not out\nof curiosity, I had heard enough, but with the hope of being useful to a\npoor, outcast girl.\n\n\"A month or two elapsed before I saw this woman again; and then she had\na child in her hand that tottered along, scarcely able to sustain her\nown weight. They were going away, to return at the hour Mr. Venables\nwas expected; he was now from home. I desired the woman to walk into\nthe parlour. She hesitated, yet obeyed. I assured her that I should not\nmention to my husband (the word seemed to weigh on my respiration), that\nI had seen her, or his child. The woman stared at me with astonishment;\nand I turned my eyes on the squalid object [that accompanied her.] She\ncould hardly support herself, her complexion was sallow, and her eyes\ninflamed, with an indescribable look of cunning, mixed with the wrinkles\nproduced by the peevishness of pain.\n\n\"Poor child!' I exclaimed. 'Ah! you may well say poor child,' replied\nthe woman. 'I brought her here to see whether he would have the heart\nto look at her, and not get some advice. I do not know what they deserve\nwho nursed her. Why, her legs bent under her like a bow when she came to\nme, and she has never been well since; but, if they were no better paid\nthan I am, it is not to be wondered at, sure enough.'\n\n\"On further enquiry I was informed, that this miserable spectacle was\nthe daughter of a servant, a country girl, who caught Mr. Venables' eye,\nand whom he seduced. On his marriage he sent her away, her situation\nbeing too visible. After her delivery, she was thrown on the town;\nand died in an hospital within the year. The babe was sent to a\nparish-nurse, and afterwards to this woman, who did not seem much\nbetter; but what was to be expected from such a close bargain? She was\nonly paid three shillings a week for board and washing.\n\n\"The woman begged me to give her some old clothes for the child,\nassuring me, that she was almost afraid to ask master for money to buy\neven a pair of shoes.\n\n\"I grew sick at heart. And, fearing Mr. Venables might enter, and\noblige me to express my abhorrence, I hastily enquired where she lived,\npromised to pay her two shillings a week more, and to call on her in\na day or two; putting a trifle into her hand as a proof of my good\nintention.\n\n\"If the state of this child affected me, what were my feelings at a\ndiscovery I made respecting Peggy--?\"*\n\n     * The manuscript is imperfect here.

[Godwin's note]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\n\n\n\"MY FATHER'S situation was now so distressing, that I prevailed on my\nuncle to accompany me to visit him; and to lend me his assistance, to\nprevent the whole property of the family from becoming the prey of\nmy brother's rapacity; for, to extricate himself out of present\ndifficulties, my father was totally regardless of futurity. I took down\nwith me some presents for my step-mother; it did not require an effort\nfor me to treat her with civility, or to forget the past.\n\n\"This was the first time I had visited my native village, since my\nmarriage. But with what different emotions did I return from the busy\nworld, with a heavy weight of experience benumbing my imagination, to\nscenes, that whispered recollections of joy and hope most eloquently to\nmy heart! The first scent of the wild flowers from the heath, thrilled\nthrough my veins, awakening every sense to pleasure. The icy hand\nof despair seemed to be removed from my bosom; and--forgetting my\nhusband--the nurtured visions of a romantic mind, bursting on me with\nall their original wildness and gay exuberance, were again hailed as\nsweet realities. I forgot, with equal facility, that I ever felt sorrow,\nor knew care in the country; while a transient rainbow stole athwart\nthe cloudy sky of despondency. The picturesque form of several favourite\ntrees, and the porches of rude cottages, with their smiling hedges, were\nrecognized with the gladsome playfulness of childish vivacity. I could\nhave kissed the chickens that pecked on the common; and longed to pat\nthe cows, and frolic with the dogs that sported on it. I gazed with\ndelight on the windmill, and thought it lucky that it should be in\nmotion, at the moment I passed by; and entering the dear green lane,\nwhich led directly to the village, the sound of the well-known rookery\ngave that sentimental tinge to the varying sensations of my active soul,\nwhich only served to heighten the lustre of the luxuriant scenery. But,\nspying, as I advanced, the spire, peeping over the withered tops of the\naged elms that composed the rookery, my thoughts flew immediately to\nthe churchyard, and tears of affection, such was the effect of my\nimagination, bedewed my mother's grave! Sorrow gave place to devotional\nfeelings. I wandered through the church in fancy, as I used sometimes\nto do on a Saturday evening. I recollected with what fervour I addressed\nthe God of my youth: and once more with rapturous love looked above\nmy sorrows to the Father of nature. I pause--feeling forcibly all the\nemotions I am describing; and (reminded, as I register my sorrows, of\nthe sublime calm I have felt, when in some tremendous solitude, my soul\nrested on itself, and seemed to fill the universe) I insensibly breathe\nsoft, hushing every wayward emotion, as if fearing to sully with a sigh,\na contentment so extatic.\n\n\"Having settled my father's affairs, and, by my exertions in his favour,\nmade my brother my sworn foe, I returned to London. My husband's conduct\nwas now changed; I had during my absence, received several affectionate,\npenitential letters from him; and he seemed on my arrival, to wish by\nhis behaviour to prove his sincerity. I could not then conceive why he\nacted thus; and, when the suspicion darted into my head, that it might\narise from observing my increasing influence with my uncle, I almost\ndespised myself for imagining that such a degree of debasing selfishness\ncould exist.\n\n\"He became, unaccountable as was the change, tender and attentive; and,\nattacking my weak side, made a confession of his follies, and lamented\nthe embarrassments in which I, who merited a far different fate, might\nbe involved. He besought me to aid him with my counsel, praised my\nunderstanding, and appealed to the tenderness of my heart.\n\n\"This conduct only inspired me with compassion. I wished to be his\nfriend; but love had spread his rosy pinions and fled far, far away;\nand had not (like some exquisite perfumes, the fine spirit of which\nis continually mingling with the air) left a fragrance behind, to mark\nwhere he had shook his wings. My husband's renewed caresses then became\nhateful to me; his brutality was tolerable, compared to his distasteful\nfondness. Still, compassion, and the fear of insulting his supposed\nfeelings, by a want of sympathy, made me dissemble, and do violence to\nmy delicacy. What a task!\n\n\"Those who support a system of what I term false refinement, and will\nnot allow great part of love in the female, as well as male breast, to\nspring in some respects involuntarily, may not admit that charms are\nas necessary to feed the passion, as virtues to convert the mellowing\nspirit into friendship. To such observers I have nothing to say, any\nmore than to the moralists, who insist that women ought to, and can love\ntheir husbands, because it is their duty. To you, my child, I may\nadd, with a heart tremblingly alive to your future conduct, some\nobservations, dictated by my present feelings, on calmly reviewing this\nperiod of my life. When novelists or moralists praise as a virtue, a\nwoman's coldness of constitution, and want of passion; and make her\nyield to the ardour of her lover out of sheer compassion, or to promote\na frigid plan of future comfort, I am disgusted. They may be good women,\nin the ordinary acceptation of the phrase, and do no harm; but they\nappear to me not to have those 'finely fashioned nerves,' which render\nthe senses exquisite. They may possess tenderness; but they want that\nfire of the imagination, which produces _active_ sensibility, and\n_positive_ _virtue_. How does the woman deserve to be characterized, who\nmarries one man, with a heart and imagination devoted to another? Is she\nnot an object of pity or contempt, when thus sacrilegiously violating\nthe purity of her own feelings? Nay, it is as indelicate, when she is\nindifferent, unless she be constitutionally insensible; then indeed it\nis a mere affair of barter; and I have nothing to do with the secrets of\ntrade. Yes; eagerly as I wish you to possess true rectitude of mind,\nand purity of affection, I must insist that a heartless conduct is the\ncontrary of virtuous. Truth is the only basis of virtue; and we cannot,\nwithout depraving our minds, endeavour to please a lover or husband, but\nin proportion as he pleases us. Men, more effectually to enslave us, may\ninculcate this partial morality, and lose sight of virtue in subdividing\nit into the duties of particular stations; but let us not blush for\nnature without a cause!\n\n\"After these remarks, I am ashamed to own, that I was pregnant. The\ngreatest sacrifice of my principles in my whole life, was the allowing\nmy husband again to be familiar with my person, though to this cruel act\nof self-denial, when I wished the earth to open and swallow me, you owe\nyour birth; and I the unutterable pleasure of being a mother. There was\nsomething of delicacy in my husband's bridal attentions; but now\nhis tainted breath, pimpled face, and blood-shot eyes, were not more\nrepugnant to my senses, than his gross manners, and loveless familiarity\nto my taste.\n\n\"A man would only be expected to maintain; yes, barely grant a\nsubsistence, to a woman rendered odious by habitual intoxication; but\nwho would expect him, or think it possible to love her? And unless\n'youth, and genial years were flown,' it would be thought equally\nunreasonable to insist, [under penalty of] forfeiting almost every\nthing reckoned valuable in life, that he should not love another:\nwhilst woman, weak in reason, impotent in will, is required to moralize,\nsentimentalize herself to stone, and pine her life away, labouring\nto reform her embruted mate. He may even spend in dissipation, and\nintemperance, the very intemperance which renders him so hateful, her\nproperty, and by stinting her expences, not permit her to beguile in\nsociety, a wearisome, joyless life; for over their mutual fortune she\nhas no power, it must all pass through his hand. And if she be a mother,\nand in the present state of women, it is a great misfortune to be\nprevented from discharging the duties, and cultivating the affections of\none, what has she not to endure?--But I have suffered the tenderness\nof one to lead me into reflections that I did not think of making, to\ninterrupt my narrative--yet the full heart will overflow.\n\n\"Mr. Venables' embarrassments did not now endear him to me; still,\nanxious to befriend him, I endeavoured to prevail on him to retrench his\nexpences; but he had always some plausible excuse to give, to justify\nhis not following my advice. Humanity, compassion, and the interest\nproduced by a habit of living together, made me try to relieve, and\nsympathize with him; but, when I recollected that I was bound to live\nwith such a being for ever--my heart died within me; my desire of\nimprovement became languid, and baleful, corroding melancholy took\npossession of my soul. Marriage had bastilled me for life. I discovered\nin myself a capacity for the enjoyment of the various pleasures\nexistence affords; yet, fettered by the partial laws of society, this\nfair globe was to me an universal blank.\n\n\"When I exhorted my husband to economy, I referred to himself. I was\nobliged to practise the most rigid, or contract debts, which I had\ntoo much reason to fear would never be paid. I despised this paltry\nprivilege of a wife, which can only be of use to the vicious or\ninconsiderate, and determined not to increase the torrent that was\nbearing him down. I was then ignorant of the extent of his fraudulent\nspeculations, whom I was bound to honour and obey.\n\n\"A woman neglected by her husband, or whose manners form a striking\ncontrast with his, will always have men on the watch to soothe and\nflatter her. Besides, the forlorn state of a neglected woman, not\ndestitute of personal charms, is particularly interesting, and rouses\nthat species of pity, which is so near akin, it easily slides into love.\nA man of feeling thinks not of seducing, he is himself seduced by\nall the noblest emotions of his soul. He figures to himself all the\nsacrifices a woman of sensibility must make, and every situation in\nwhich his imagination places her, touches his heart, and fires his\npassions. Longing to take to his bosom the shorn lamb, and bid the\ndrooping buds of hope revive, benevolence changes into passion: and\nshould he then discover that he is beloved, honour binds him fast,\nthough foreseeing that he may afterwards be obliged to pay severe\ndamages to the man, who never appeared to value his wife's society, till\nhe found that there was a chance of his being indemnified for the loss\nof it.\n\n\"Such are the partial laws enacted by men; for, only to lay a stress\non the dependent state of a woman in the grand question of the comforts\narising from the possession of property, she is [even in this article]\nmuch more injured by the loss of the husband's affection, than he by\nthat of his wife; yet where is she, condemned to the solitude of a\ndeserted home, to look for a compensation from the woman, who seduces\nhim from her? She cannot drive an unfaithful husband from his house, nor\nseparate, or tear, his children from him, however culpable he may be;\nand he, still the master of his own fate, enjoys the smiles of a world,\nthat would brand her with infamy, did she, seeking consolation, venture\nto retaliate.\n\n\"These remarks are not dictated by experience; but merely by the\ncompassion I feel for many amiable women, the _outlaws_ of the world.\nFor myself, never encouraging any of the advances that were made to me,\nmy lovers dropped off like the untimely shoots of spring. I did not\neven coquet with them; because I found, on examining myself, I could not\ncoquet with a man without loving him a little; and I perceived that I\nshould not be able to stop at the line of what are termed _innocent_\n_freedoms_, did I suffer any. My reserve was then the consequence of\ndelicacy. Freedom of conduct has emancipated many women's minds; but\nmy conduct has most rigidly been governed by my principles, till the\nimprovement of my understanding has enabled me to discern the fallacy of\nprejudices at war with nature and reason.\n\n\"Shortly after the change I have mentioned in my husband's conduct, my\nuncle was compelled by his declining health, to seek the succour of a\nmilder climate, and embark for Lisbon. He left his will in the hands of\na friend, an eminent solicitor; he had previously questioned me relative\nto my situation and state of mind, and declared very freely, that he\ncould place no reliance on the stability of my husband's professions. He\nhad been deceived in the unfolding of his character; he now thought\nit fixed in a train of actions that would inevitably lead to ruin and\ndisgrace.\n\n\"The evening before his departure, which we spent alone together,\nhe folded me to his heart, uttering the endearing appellation of\n'child.'--My more than father! why was I not permitted to perform the\nlast duties of one, and smooth the pillow of death? He seemed by his\nmanner to be convinced that he should never see me more; yet requested\nme, most earnestly, to come to him, should I be obliged to leave my\nhusband. He had before expressed his sorrow at hearing of my pregnancy,\nhaving determined to prevail on me to accompany him, till I informed him\nof that circumstance. He expressed himself unfeignedly sorry that\nany new tie should bind me to a man whom he thought so incapable of\nestimating my value; such was the kind language of affection.\n\n\"I must repeat his own words; they made an indelible impression on my\nmind:\n\n\"'The marriage state is certainly that in which women, generally\nspeaking, can be most useful; but I am far from thinking that a\nwoman, once married, ought to consider the engagement as indissoluble\n(especially if there be no children to reward her for sacrificing her\nfeelings) in case her husband merits neither her love, nor esteem.\nEsteem will often supply the place of love; and prevent a woman from\nbeing wretched, though it may not make her happy. The magnitude of a\nsacrifice ought always to bear some proportion to the utility in view;\nand for a woman to live with a man, for whom she can cherish neither\naffection nor esteem, or even be of any use to him, excepting in the\nlight of a house-keeper, is an abjectness of condition, the enduring of\nwhich no concurrence of circumstances can ever make a duty in the sight\nof God or just men. If indeed she submits to it merely to be maintained\nin idleness, she has no right to complain bitterly of her fate; or to\nact, as a person of independent character might, as if she had a title\nto disregard general rules.\n\n\"But the misfortune is, that many women only submit in appearance, and\nforfeit their own respect to secure their reputation in the world. The\nsituation of a woman separated from her husband, is undoubtedly very\ndifferent from that of a man who has left his wife. He, with lordly\ndignity, has shaken of a clog; and the allowing her food and raiment, is\nthought sufficient to secure his reputation from taint. And, should she\nhave been inconsiderate, he will be celebrated for his generosity and\nforbearance. Such is the respect paid to the master-key of property! A\nwoman, on the contrary, resigning what is termed her natural protector\n(though he never was so, but in name) is despised and shunned, for\nasserting the independence of mind distinctive of a rational being, and\nspurning at slavery.'\n\n\"During the remainder of the evening, my uncle's tenderness led him\nfrequently to revert to the subject, and utter, with increasing warmth,\nsentiments to the same purport. At length it was necessary to say\n'Farewell!'--and we parted--gracious God! to meet no more.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11\n\n\n\"A GENTLEMAN of large fortune and of polished manners, had lately\nvisited very frequently at our house, and treated me, if possible,\nwith more respect than Mr. Venables paid him; my pregnancy was not yet\nvisible, his society was a great relief to me, as I had for some time\npast, to avoid expence, confined myself very much at home. I ever\ndisdained unnecessary, perhaps even prudent concealments; and my\nhusband, with great ease, discovered the amount of my uncle's parting\npresent. A copy of a writ was the stale pretext to extort it from me;\nand I had soon reason to believe that it was fabricated for the purpose.\nI acknowledge my folly in thus suffering myself to be continually\nimposed on. I had adhered to my resolution not to apply to my uncle,\non the part of my husband, any more; yet, when I had received a sum\nsufficient to supply my own wants, and to enable me to pursue a plan I\nhad in view, to settle my younger brother in a respectable employment,\nI allowed myself to be duped by Mr. Venables' shallow pretences, and\nhypocritical professions.\n\n\"Thus did he pillage me and my family, thus frustrate all my plans of\nusefulness. Yet this was the man I was bound to respect and esteem: as\nif respect and esteem depended on an arbitrary will of our own! But a\nwife being as much a man's property as his horse, or his ass, she has\nnothing she can call her own. He may use any means to get at what the\nlaw considers as his, the moment his wife is in possession of it, even\nto the forcing of a lock, as Mr. Venables did, to search for notes in\nmy writing-desk--and all this is done with a show of equity, because,\nforsooth, he is responsible for her maintenance.\n\n\"The tender mother cannot _lawfully_ snatch from the gripe of the\ngambling spendthrift, or beastly drunkard, unmindful of his offspring,\nthe fortune which falls to her by chance; or (so flagrant is the\ninjustice) what she earns by her own exertions. No; he can rob her with\nimpunity, even to waste publicly on a courtezan; and the laws of her\ncountry--if women have a country--afford her no protection or redress\nfrom the oppressor, unless she have the plea of bodily fear; yet how\nmany ways are there of goading the soul almost to madness, equally\nunmanly, though not so mean? When such laws were framed, should\nnot impartial lawgivers have first decreed, in the style of a great\nassembly, who recognized the existence of an _etre_ _supreme_, to fix\nthe national belief, that the husband should always be wiser and more\nvirtuous than his wife, in order to entitle him, with a show of justice,\nto keep this idiot, or perpetual minor, for ever in bondage. But I must\nhave done--on this subject, my indignation continually runs away with\nme.\n\n\"The company of the gentleman I have already mentioned, who had a\ngeneral acquaintance with literature and subjects of taste, was grateful\nto me; my countenance brightened up as he approached, and I unaffectedly\nexpressed the pleasure I felt. The amusement his conversation afforded\nme, made it easy to comply with my husband's request, to endeavour to\nrender our house agreeable to him.\n\n\"His attentions became more pointed; but, as I was not of the number\nof women, whose virtue, as it is termed, immediately takes alarm, I\nendeavoured, rather by raillery than serious expostulation, to give a\ndifferent turn to his conversation. He assumed a new mode of attack, and\nI was, for a while, the dupe of his pretended friendship.\n\n\"I had, merely in the style of _badinage_, boasted of my conquest, and\nrepeated his lover-like compliments to my husband. But he begged me,\nfor God's sake, not to affront his friend, or I should destroy all his\nprojects, and be his ruin. Had I had more affection for my husband, I\nshould have expressed my contempt of this time-serving politeness: now\nI imagined that I only felt pity; yet it would have puzzled a casuist to\npoint out in what the exact difference consisted.\n\n\"This friend began now, in confidence, to discover to me the real state\nof my husband's affairs. 'Necessity,' said Mr. S----; why should I\nreveal his name? for he affected to palliate the conduct he could not\nexcuse, 'had led him to take such steps, by accommodation bills, buying\ngoods on credit, to sell them for ready money, and similar transactions,\nthat his character in the commercial world was gone. He was considered,'\nhe added, lowering his voice, 'on 'Change as a swindler.'\n\n\"I felt at that moment the first maternal pang. Aware of the evils my\nsex have to struggle with, I still wished, for my own consolation, to be\nthe mother of a daughter; and I could not bear to think, that the _sins_\nof her father's entailed disgrace, should be added to the ills to which\nwoman is heir.\n\n\"So completely was I deceived by these shows of friendship (nay, I\nbelieve, according to his interpretation, Mr. S---- really was my\nfriend) that I began to consult him respecting the best mode of\nretrieving my husband's character: it is the good name of a woman only\nthat sets to rise no more. I knew not that he had been drawn into a\nwhirlpool, out of which he had not the energy to attempt to escape. He\nseemed indeed destitute of the power of employing his faculties in any\nregular pursuit. His principles of action were so loose, and his mind so\nuncultivated, that every thing like order appeared to him in the shape\nof restraint; and, like men in the savage state, he required the strong\nstimulus of hope or fear, produced by wild speculations, in which the\ninterests of others went for nothing, to keep his spirits awake. He one\ntime professed patriotism, but he knew not what it was to feel honest\nindignation; and pretended to be an advocate for liberty, when, with as\nlittle affection for the human race as for individuals, he thought of\nnothing but his own gratification. He was just such a citizen, as a\nfather. The sums he adroitly obtained by a violation of the laws of\nhis country, as well as those of humanity, he would allow a mistress to\nsquander; though she was, with the same _sang_ _froid_, consigned, as\nwere his children, to poverty, when another proved more attractive.\n\n\"On various pretences, his friend continued to visit me; and, observing\nmy want of money, he tried to induce me to accept of pecuniary aid; but\nthis offer I absolutely rejected, though it was made with such delicacy,\nI could not be displeased.\n\n\"One day he came, as I thought accidentally, to dinner. My husband was\nvery much engaged in business, and quitted the room soon after the cloth\nwas removed. We conversed as usual, till confidential advice led again\nto love. I was extremely mortified. I had a sincere regard for him, and\nhoped that he had an equal friendship for me. I therefore began\nmildly to expostulate with him. This gentleness he mistook for coy\nencouragement; and he would not be diverted from the subject. Perceiving\nhis mistake, I seriously asked him how, using such language to me, he\ncould profess to be my husband's friend? A significant sneer excited my\ncuriosity, and he, supposing this to be my only scruple, took a letter\ndeliberately out of his pocket, saying, 'Your husband's honour is not\ninflexible. How could you, with your discernment, think it so? Why,\nhe left the room this very day on purpose to give me an opportunity to\nexplain myself; _he_ thought me too timid--too tardy.\n\n\"I snatched the letter with indescribable emotion. The purport of it was\nto invite him to dinner, and to ridicule his chivalrous respect for\nme. He assured him, 'that every woman had her price, and, with gross\nindecency, hinted, that he should be glad to have the duty of a husband\ntaken off his hands. These he termed _liberal_ _sentiments_. He advised\nhim not to shock my romantic notions, but to attack my credulous\ngenerosity, and weak pity; and concluded with requesting him to lend him\nfive hundred pounds for a month or six weeks.' I read this letter twice\nover; and the firm purpose it inspired, calmed the rising tumult of my\nsoul. I rose deliberately, requested Mr. S---- to wait a moment, and\ninstantly going into the counting-house, desired Mr. Venables to return\nwith me to the dining-parlour.\n\n\"He laid down his pen, and entered with me, without observing any change\nin my countenance. I shut the door, and, giving him the letter, simply\nasked, 'whether he wrote it, or was it a forgery?'\n\n\"Nothing could equal his confusion. His friend's eye met his, and\nhe muttered something about a joke--But I interrupted him--'It is\nsufficient--We part for ever.'\n\n\"I continued, with solemnity, 'I have borne with your tyranny and\ninfidelities. I disdain to utter what I have borne with. I thought you\nunprincipled, but not so decidedly vicious. I formed a tie, in the sight\nof heaven--I have held it sacred; even when men, more conformable to my\ntaste, have made me feel--I despise all subterfuge!--that I was not\ndead to love. Neglected by you, I have resolutely stifled the enticing\nemotions, and respected the plighted faith you outraged. And you dare\nnow to insult me, by selling me to prostitution!--Yes--equally lost to\ndelicacy and principle--you dared sacrilegiously to barter the honour of\nthe mother of your child.'\n\n\"Then, turning to Mr. S----, I added, 'I call on you, Sir, to witness,'\nand I lifted my hands and eyes to heaven, 'that, as solemnly as I took\nhis name, I now abjure it,' I pulled off my ring, and put it on the\ntable; 'and that I mean immediately to quit his house, never to enter it\nmore. I will provide for myself and child. I leave him as free as I am\ndetermined to be myself--he shall be answerable for no debts of mine.'\n\n\"Astonishment closed their lips, till Mr. Venables, gently pushing\nhis friend, with a forced smile, out of the room, nature for a moment\nprevailed, and, appearing like himself, he turned round, burning with\nrage, to me: but there was no terror in the frown, excepting when\ncontrasted with the malignant smile which preceded it. He bade me\n'leave the house at my peril; told me he despised my threats; I had no\nresource; I could not swear the peace against him!--I was not afraid of\nmy life!--he had never struck me!'\n\n\"He threw the letter in the fire, which I had incautiously left in his\nhands; and, quitting the room, locked the door on me.\n\n\"When left alone, I was a moment or two before I could recollect\nmyself--One scene had succeeded another with such rapidity, I almost\ndoubted whether I was reflecting on a real event. 'Was it possible? Was\nI, indeed, free?'--Yes; free I termed myself, when I decidedly perceived\nthe conduct I ought to adopt. How had I panted for liberty--liberty,\nthat I would have purchased at any price, but that of my own esteem! I\nrose, and shook myself; opened the window, and methought the air never\nsmelled so sweet. The face of heaven grew fairer as I viewed it, and the\nclouds seemed to flit away obedient to my wishes, to give my soul room\nto expand. I was all soul, and (wild as it may appear) felt as if I\ncould have dissolved in the soft balmy gale that kissed my cheek,\nor have glided below the horizon on the glowing, descending beams. A\nseraphic satisfaction animated, without agitating my spirits; and my\nimagination collected, in visions sublimely terrible, or soothingly\nbeautiful, an immense variety of the endless images, which nature\naffords, and fancy combines, of the grand and fair. The lustre of these\nbright picturesque sketches faded with the setting sun; but I was still\nalive to the calm delight they had diffused through my heart.\n\n\"There may be advocates for matrimonial obedience, who, making a\ndistinction between the duty of a wife and of a human being, may blame\nmy conduct.--To them I write not--my feelings are not for them\nto analyze; and may you, my child, never be able to ascertain, by\nheart-rending experience, what your mother felt before the present\nemancipation of her mind!\n\n\"I began to write a letter to my father, after closing one to my\nuncle; not to ask advice, but to signify my determination; when I was\ninterrupted by the entrance of Mr. Venables. His manner was changed. His\nviews on my uncle's fortune made him averse to my quitting his house,\nor he would, I am convinced, have been glad to have shaken off even the\nslight restraint my presence imposed on him; the restraint of showing\nme some respect. So far from having an affection for me, he really hated\nme, because he was convinced that I must despise him.\n\n\"He told me, that 'As I now had had time to cool and reflect, he did not\ndoubt but that my prudence, and nice sense of propriety, would lead me\nto overlook what was passed.'\n\n\"'Reflection,' I replied, 'had only confirmed my purpose, and no power\non earth could divert me from it.'\n\n\"Endeavouring to assume a soothing voice and look, when he would\nwillingly have tortured me, to force me to feel his power, his\ncountenance had an infernal expression, when he desired me, 'Not to\nexpose myself to the servants, by obliging him to confine me in my\napartment; if then I would give my promise not to quit the house\nprecipitately, I should be free--and--.' I declared, interrupting him,\n'that I would promise nothing. I had no measures to keep with him--I was\nresolved, and would not condescend to subterfuge.'\n\n\"He muttered, 'that I should soon repent of these preposterous airs;'\nand, ordering tea to be carried into my little study, which had a\ncommunication with my bed-chamber, he once more locked the door upon\nme, and left me to my own meditations. I had passively followed him up\nstairs, not wishing to fatigue myself with unavailing exertion.\n\n\"Nothing calms the mind like a fixed purpose. I felt as if I had heaved\na thousand weight from my heart; the atmosphere seemed lightened; and,\nif I execrated the institutions of society, which thus enable men\nto tyrannize over women, it was almost a disinterested sentiment. I\ndisregarded present inconveniences, when my mind had done struggling\nwith itself,--when reason and inclination had shaken hands and were at\npeace. I had no longer the cruel task before me, in endless perspective,\naye, during the tedious for ever of life, of labouring to overcome my\nrepugnance--of labouring to extinguish the hopes, the maybes of a lively\nimagination. Death I had hailed as my only chance for deliverance; but,\nwhile existence had still so many charms, and life promised happiness, I\nshrunk from the icy arms of an unknown tyrant, though far more inviting\nthan those of the man, to whom I supposed myself bound without any other\nalternative; and was content to linger a little longer, waiting for I\nknew not what, rather than leave 'the warm precincts of the cheerful\nday,' and all the unenjoyed affection of my nature.\n\n\"My present situation gave a new turn to my reflection; and I wondered\n(now the film seemed to be withdrawn, that obscured the piercing\nsight of reason) how I could, previously to the deciding outrage, have\nconsidered myself as everlastingly united to vice and folly! 'Had an\nevil genius cast a spell at my birth; or a demon stalked out of\nchaos, to perplex my understanding, and enchain my will, with delusive\nprejudices?'\n\n\"I pursued this train of thinking; it led me out of myself, to expatiate\non the misery peculiar to my sex. 'Are not,' I thought, 'the despots for\never stigmatized, who, in the wantonness of power, commanded even the\nmost atrocious criminals to be chained to dead bodies? though surely\nthose laws are much more inhuman, which forge adamantine fetters to bind\nminds together, that never can mingle in social communion! What\nindeed can equal the wretchedness of that state, in which there is no\nalternative, but to extinguish the affections, or encounter infamy?'\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12\n\n\n\"TOWARDS midnight Mr. Venables entered my chamber; and, with calm\naudacity preparing to go to bed, he bade me make haste, 'for that was\nthe best place for husbands and wives to end their differences. He had\nbeen drinking plentifully to aid his courage.\n\n\"I did not at first deign to reply. But perceiving that he affected to\ntake my silence for consent, I told him that, 'If he would not go to\nanother bed, or allow me, I should sit up in my study all night.' He\nattempted to pull me into the chamber, half joking. But I resisted; and,\nas he had determined not to give me any reason for saying that he used\nviolence, after a few more efforts, he retired, cursing my obstinacy, to\nbed.\n\n\"I sat musing some time longer; then, throwing my cloak around me,\nprepared for sleep on a sopha. And, so fortunate seemed my deliverance,\nso sacred the pleasure of being thus wrapped up in myself, that I slept\nprofoundly, and woke with a mind composed to encounter the struggles of\nthe day. Mr. Venables did not wake till some hours after; and then he\ncame to me half-dressed, yawning and stretching, with haggard eyes, as\nif he scarcely recollected what had passed the preceding evening. He\nfixed his eyes on me for a moment, then, calling me a fool, asked 'How\nlong I intended to continue this pretty farce? For his part, he was\ndevilish sick of it; but this was the plague of marrying women who\npretended to know something.'\n\n\"I made no other reply to this harangue, than to say, 'That he ought to\nbe glad to get rid of a woman so unfit to be his companion--and that any\nchange in my conduct would be mean dissimulation; for maturer reflection\nonly gave the sacred seal of reason to my first resolution.'\n\n\"He looked as if he could have stamped with impatience, at being obliged\nto stifle his rage; but, conquering his anger (for weak people, whose\npassions seem the most ungovernable, restrain them with the greatest\nease, when they have a sufficient motive), he exclaimed, 'Very pretty,\nupon my soul! very pretty, theatrical flourishes! Pray, fair Roxana,\nstoop from your altitudes, and remember that you are acting a part in\nreal life.'\n\n\"He uttered this speech with a self-satisfied air, and went down stairs\nto dress.\n\n\"In about an hour he came to me again; and in the same tone said, 'That\nhe came as my gentleman-usher to hand me down to breakfast.\n\n\"'Of the black rod?' asked I.\n\n\"This question, and the tone in which I asked it, a little disconcerted\nhim. To say the truth, I now felt no resentment; my firm resolution to\nfree myself from my ignoble thraldom, had absorbed the various emotions\nwhich, during six years, had racked my soul. The duty pointed out by my\nprinciples seemed clear; and not one tender feeling intruded to make\nme swerve: The dislike which my husband had inspired was strong; but it\nonly led me to wish to avoid, to wish to let him drop out of my memory;\nthere was no misery, no torture that I would not deliberately have\nchosen, rather than renew my lease of servitude.\n\n\"During the breakfast, he attempted to reason with me on the folly of\nromantic sentiments; for this was the indiscriminate epithet he gave\nto every mode of conduct or thinking superior to his own. He asserted,\n'that all the world were governed by their own interest; those who\npretended to be actuated by different motives, were only deeper knaves,\nor fools crazed by books, who took for gospel all the rodomantade\nnonsense written by men who knew nothing of the world. For his part,\nhe thanked God, he was no hypocrite; and, if he stretched a point\nsometimes, it was always with an intention of paying every man his own.'\n\n\"He then artfully insinuated, 'that he daily expected a vessel to\narrive, a successful speculation, that would make him easy for the\npresent, and that he had several other schemes actually depending, that\ncould not fail. He had no doubt of becoming rich in a few years, though\nhe had been thrown back by some unlucky adventures at the setting out.'\n\n\"I mildly replied, 'That I wished he might not involve himself still\ndeeper.'\n\n\"He had no notion that I was governed by a decision of judgment, not to\nbe compared with a mere spurt of resentment. He knew not what it was to\nfeel indignation against vice, and often boasted of his placable temper,\nand readiness to forgive injuries. True; for he only considered the\nbeing deceived, as an effort of skill he had not guarded against; and\nthen, with a cant of candour, would observe, 'that he did not know how\nhe might himself have been tempted to act in the same circumstances.'\nAnd, as his heart never opened to friendship, it never was wounded by\ndisappointment. Every new acquaintance he protested, it is true, was\n'the cleverest fellow in the world; and he really thought so; till the\nnovelty of his conversation or manners ceased to have any effect on his\nsluggish spirits. His respect for rank or fortune was more permanent,\nthough he chanced to have no design of availing himself of the influence\nof either to promote his own views.\n\n\"After a prefatory conversation,--my blood (I thought it had been\ncooler) flushed over my whole countenance as he spoke--he alluded to my\nsituation. He desired me to reflect--'and act like a prudent woman,\nas the best proof of my superior understanding; for he must own I had\nsense, did I know how to use it. I was not,' he laid a stress on his\nwords, 'without my passions; and a husband was a convenient cloke.--He\nwas liberal in his way of thinking; and why might not we, like many\nother married people, who were above vulgar prejudices, tacitly consent\nto let each other follow their own inclination?--He meant nothing more,\nin the letter I made the ground of complaint; and the pleasure which I\nseemed to take in Mr. S.'s company, led him to conclude, that he was not\ndisagreeable to me.'\n\n\"A clerk brought in the letters of the day, and I, as I often did, while\nhe was discussing subjects of business, went to the _piano_ _forte_, and\nbegan to play a favourite air to restore myself, as it were, to nature,\nand drive the sophisticated sentiments I had just been obliged to listen\nto, out of my soul.\n\n\"They had excited sensations similar to those I have felt, in viewing\nthe squalid inhabitants of some of the lanes and back streets of\nthe metropolis, mortified at being compelled to consider them as my\nfellow-creatures, as if an ape had claimed kindred with me. Or, as when\nsurrounded by a mephitical fog, I have wished to have a volley of cannon\nfired, to clear the incumbered atmosphere, and give me room to breathe\nand move.\n\n\"My spirits were all in arms, and I played a kind of extemporary\nprelude. The cadence was probably wild and impassioned, while, lost in\nthought, I made the sounds a kind of echo to my train of thinking.\n\n\"Pausing for a moment, I met Mr. Venables' eyes. He was observing me\nwith an air of conceited satisfaction, as much as to say--'My last\ninsinuation has done the business--she begins to know her own interest.'\nThen gathering up his letters, he said, 'That he hoped he should hear\nno more romantic stuff, well enough in a miss just come from boarding\nschool;' and went, as was his custom, to the counting-house. I still\ncontinued playing; and, turning to a sprightly lesson, I executed it\nwith uncommon vivacity. I heard footsteps approach the door, and was\nsoon convinced that Mr. Venables was listening; the consciousness only\ngave more animation to my fingers. He went down into the kitchen, and\nthe cook, probably by his desire, came to me, to know what I would\nplease to order for dinner. Mr. Venables came into the parlour again,\nwith apparent carelessness. I perceived that the cunning man was\noverreaching himself; and I gave my directions as usual, and left the\nroom.\n\n\"While I was making some alteration in my dress, Mr. Venables peeped in,\nand, begging my pardon for interrupting me, disappeared. I took up some\nwork (I could not read), and two or three messages were sent to me,\nprobably for no other purpose, but to enable Mr. Venables to ascertain\nwhat I was about.\n\n\"I listened whenever I heard the street-door open; at last I imagined I\ncould distinguish Mr. Venables' step, going out. I laid aside my work;\nmy heart palpitated; still I was afraid hastily to enquire; and I waited\na long half hour, before I ventured to ask the boy whether his master\nwas in the counting-house?\n\n\"Being answered in the negative, I bade him call me a coach, and\ncollecting a few necessaries hastily together, with a little parcel\nof letters and papers which I had collected the preceding evening, I\nhurried into it, desiring the coachman to drive to a distant part of the\ntown.\n\n\"I almost feared that the coach would break down before I got out of the\nstreet; and, when I turned the corner, I seemed to breathe a freer air.\nI was ready to imagine that I was rising above the thick atmosphere of\nearth; or I felt, as wearied souls might be supposed to feel on entering\nanother state of existence.\n\n\"I stopped at one or two stands of coaches to elude pursuit, and then\ndrove round the skirts of the town to seek for an obscure lodging, where\nI wished to remain concealed, till I could avail myself of my uncle's\nprotection. I had resolved to assume my own name immediately, and openly\nto avow my determination, without any formal vindication, the moment\nI had found a home, in which I could rest free from the daily alarm of\nexpecting to see Mr. Venables enter.\n\n\"I looked at several lodgings; but finding that I could not, without\na reference to some acquaintance, who might inform my tyrant, get\nadmittance into a decent apartment--men have not all this trouble--I\nthought of a woman whom I had assisted to furnish a little haberdasher's\nshop, and who I knew had a first floor to let.\n\n\"I went to her, and though I could not persuade her, that the quarrel\nbetween me and Mr. Venables would never be made up, still she agreed to\nconceal me for the present; yet assuring me at the same time, shaking\nher head, that, when a woman was once married, she must bear every\nthing. Her pale face, on which appeared a thousand haggard lines and\ndelving wrinkles, produced by what is emphatically termed fretting,\ninforced her remark; and I had afterwards an opportunity of observing\nthe treatment she had to endure, which grizzled her into patience. She\ntoiled from morning till night; yet her husband would rob the till,\nand take away the money reserved for paying bills; and, returning home\ndrunk, he would beat her if she chanced to offend him, though she had a\nchild at the breast.\n\n\"These scenes awoke me at night; and, in the morning, I heard her, as\nusual, talk to her dear Johnny--he, forsooth, was her master; no slave\nin the West Indies had one more despotic; but fortunately she was of the\ntrue Russian breed of wives.\n\n\"My mind, during the few past days, seemed, as it were, disengaged from\nmy body; but, now the struggle was over, I felt very forcibly the effect\nwhich perturbation of spirits produces on a woman in my situation.\n\n\"The apprehension of a miscarriage, obliged me to confine myself to my\napartment near a fortnight; but I wrote to my uncle's friend for money,\npromising 'to call on him, and explain my situation, when I was well\nenough to go out; mean time I earnestly intreated him, not to mention\nmy place of abode to any one, lest my husband--such the law considered\nhim--should disturb the mind he could not conquer. I mentioned my\nintention of setting out for Lisbon, to claim my uncle's protection, the\nmoment my health would permit.'\n\n\"The tranquillity however, which I was recovering, was soon interrupted.\nMy landlady came up to me one day, with eyes swollen with weeping,\nunable to utter what she was commanded to say. She declared, 'That she\nwas never so miserable in her life; that she must appear an ungrateful\nmonster; and that she would readily go down on her knees to me, to\nintreat me to forgive her, as she had done to her husband to spare her\nthe cruel task.' Sobs prevented her from proceeding, or answering my\nimpatient enquiries, to know what she meant.\n\n\"When she became a little more composed, she took a newspaper out of\nher pocket, declaring, 'that her heart smote her, but what could she\ndo?--she must obey her husband.' I snatched the paper from her. An\nadvertisement quickly met my eye, purporting, that 'Maria Venables had,\nwithout any assignable cause, absconded from her husband; and any person\nharbouring her, was menaced with the utmost severity of the law.'\n\n\"Perfectly acquainted with Mr. Venables' meanness of soul, this step\ndid not excite my surprise, and scarcely my contempt. Resentment in my\nbreast, never survived love. I bade the poor woman, in a kind tone, wipe\nher eyes, and request her husband to come up, and speak to me himself.\n\n\"My manner awed him. He respected a lady, though not a woman; and began\nto mutter out an apology.\n\n\"'Mr. Venables was a rich gentleman; he wished to oblige me, but he had\nsuffered enough by the law already, to tremble at the thought; besides,\nfor certain, we should come together again, and then even I should not\nthank him for being accessary to keeping us asunder.--A husband and wife\nwere, God knows, just as one,--and all would come round at last.' He\nuttered a drawling 'Hem!' and then with an arch look, added--'Master\nmight have had his little frolics--but--Lord bless your heart!--men\nwould be men while the world stands.'\n\n\"To argue with this privileged first-born of reason, I perceived, would\nbe vain. I therefore only requested him to let me remain another day at\nhis house, while I sought for a lodging; and not to inform Mr. Venables\nthat I had ever been sheltered there.\n\n\"He consented, because he had not the courage to refuse a person for\nwhom he had an habitual respect; but I heard the pent-up choler burst\nforth in curses, when he met his wife, who was waiting impatiently at\nthe foot of the stairs, to know what effect my expostulations would have\non him.\n\n\"Without wasting any time in the fruitless indulgence of vexation, I\nonce more set out in search of an abode in which I could hide myself for\na few weeks.\n\n\"Agreeing to pay an exorbitant price, I hired an apartment, without any\nreference being required relative to my character: indeed, a glance at\nmy shape seemed to say, that my motive for concealment was sufficiently\nobvious. Thus was I obliged to shroud my head in infamy.\n\n\"To avoid all danger of detection--I use the appropriate word, my child,\nfor I was hunted out like a felon--I determined to take possession of my\nnew lodgings that very evening.\n\n\"I did not inform my landlady where I was going. I knew that she had a\nsincere affection for me, and would willingly have run any risk to show\nher gratitude; yet I was fully convinced, that a few kind words from\nJohnny would have found the woman in her, and her dear benefactress,\nas she termed me in an agony of tears, would have been sacrificed, to\nrecompense her tyrant for condescending to treat her like an equal. He\ncould be kind-hearted, as she expressed it, when he pleased. And this\nthawed sternness, contrasted with his habitual brutality, was the more\nacceptable, and could not be purchased at too dear a rate.\n\n\"The sight of the advertisement made me desirous of taking refuge with\nmy uncle, let what would be the consequence; and I repaired in a hackney\ncoach (afraid of meeting some person who might chance to know me, had I\nwalked) to the chambers of my uncle's friend.\n\n\"He received me with great politeness (my uncle had already prepossessed\nhim in my favour), and listened, with interest, to my explanation of the\nmotives which had induced me to fly from home, and skulk in obscurity,\nwith all the timidity of fear that ought only to be the companion of\nguilt. He lamented, with rather more gallantry than, in my situation,\nI thought delicate, that such a woman should be thrown away on a man\ninsensible to the charms of beauty or grace. He seemed at a loss what to\nadvise me to do, to evade my husband's search, without hastening to my\nuncle, whom, he hesitating said, I might not find alive. He uttered this\nintelligence with visible regret; requested me, at least, to wait for\nthe arrival of the next packet; offered me what money I wanted, and\npromised to visit me.\n\n\"He kept his word; still no letter arrived to put an end to my painful\nstate of suspense. I procured some books and music, to beguile the\ntedious solitary days.\n\n     'Come, ever smiling Liberty,\n     'And with thee bring thy jocund train:'\n\nI sung--and sung till, saddened by the strain of joy, I bitterly\nlamented the fate that deprived me of all social pleasure. Comparative\nliberty indeed I had possessed myself of; but the jocund train lagged\nfar behind!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13\n\n\n\"BY WATCHING my only visitor, my uncle's friend, or by some other means,\nMr. Venables discovered my residence, and came to enquire for me. The\nmaid-servant assured him there was no such person in the house. A bustle\nensued--I caught the alarm--listened--distinguished his voice, and\nimmediately locked the door. They suddenly grew still; and I waited\nnear a quarter of an hour, before I heard him open the parlour door,\nand mount the stairs with the mistress of the house, who obsequiously\ndeclared that she knew nothing of me.\n\n\"Finding my door locked, she requested me to open it, and prepare to go\nhome with my husband, poor gentleman! to whom I had already occasioned\nsufficient vexation.' I made no reply. Mr. Venables then, in an assumed\ntone of softness, intreated me, 'to consider what he suffered, and my\nown reputation, and get the better of childish resentment.' He ran on\nin the same strain, pretending to address me, but evidently adapting his\ndiscourse to the capacity of the landlady; who, at every pause, uttered\nan exclamation of pity; or 'Yes, to be sure--Very true, sir.'\n\n\"Sick of the farce, and perceiving that I could not avoid the hated\ninterview, I opened the door, and he entered. Advancing with easy\nassurance to take my hand, I shrunk from his touch, with an involuntary\nstart, as I should have done from a noisome reptile, with more disgust\nthan terror. His conductress was retiring, to give us, as she said, an\nopportunity to accommodate matters. But I bade her come in, or I would\ngo out; and curiosity impelled her to obey me.\n\n\"Mr. Venables began to expostulate; and this woman, proud of his\nconfidence, to second him. But I calmly silenced her, in the midst of a\nvulgar harangue, and turning to him, asked, 'Why he vainly tormented me?\ndeclaring that no power on earth should force me back to his house.'\n\n\"After a long altercation, the particulars of which, it would be to\nno purpose to repeat, he left the room. Some time was spent in loud\nconversation in the parlour below, and I discovered that he had brought\nhis friend, an attorney, with him.*\n\n     * In the original edition the paragraph following is\n     preceded by three lines of asterisks [Publisher's note].\n\n\"The tumult on the landing place, brought out a gentleman, who had\nrecently taken apartments in the house; he enquired why I was thus\nassailed?* The voluble attorney instantly repeated the trite tale. The\nstranger turned to me, observing, with the most soothing politeness and\nmanly interest, that 'my countenance told a very different story.' He\nadded, 'that I should not be insulted, or forced out of the house, by\nany body.'\n\n     * The introduction of Darnford as the deliverer of Maria, in\n     an early stage of the history, is already stated (Chap.\n     III.) to have been an after-thought of the author. This has\n     probably caused the imperfectness of the manuscript in the\n     above passage; though, at the same time, it must be\n     acknowledged to be somewhat uncertain, whether Darnford is\n     the stranger intended in this place.  It appears from Chap.\n     XVII, that an interference of a more decisive nature was\n     designed to be attributed to him.  EDITOR. [Godwin's note]\n\n\"'Not by her husband?' asked the attorney.\n\n\"'No, sir, not by her husband.' Mr. Venables advanced towards him--But\nthere was a decision in his attitude, that so well seconded that of his\nvoice, * They left the house: at the same time protesting, that any one\nthat should dare to protect me, should be prosecuted with the utmost\nrigour.\n\n     * Two and a half lines of asterisks appear here in the\n     original [Publisher's note].\n\n\"They were scarcely out of the house, when my landlady came up to me\nagain, and begged my pardon, in a very different tone. For, though Mr.\nVenables had bid her, at her peril, harbour me, he had not attended,\nI found, to her broad hints, to discharge the lodging. I instantly\npromised to pay her, and make her a present to compensate for my abrupt\ndeparture, if she would procure me another lodging, at a sufficient\ndistance; and she, in return, repeating Mr. Venables' plausible tale, I\nraised her indignation, and excited her sympathy, by telling her briefly\nthe truth.\n\n\"She expressed her commiseration with such honest warmth, that I felt\nsoothed; for I have none of that fastidious sensitiveness, which a\nvulgar accent or gesture can alarm to the disregard of real kindness. I\nwas ever glad to perceive in others the humane feelings I delighted\nto exercise; and the recollection of some ridiculous characteristic\ncircumstances, which have occurred in a moment of emotion, has convulsed\nme with laughter, though at the instant I should have thought it\nsacrilegious to have smiled. Your improvement, my dearest girl, being\never present to me while I write, I note these feelings, because women,\nmore accustomed to observe manners than actions, are too much alive to\nridicule. So much so, that their boasted sensibility is often stifled by\nfalse delicacy. True sensibility, the sensibility which is the auxiliary\nof virtue, and the soul of genius, is in society so occupied with the\nfeelings of others, as scarcely to regard its own sensations. With what\nreverence have I looked up at my uncle, the dear parent of my mind! when\nI have seen the sense of his own sufferings, of mind and body, absorbed\nin a desire to comfort those, whose misfortunes were comparatively\ntrivial. He would have been ashamed of being as indulgent to himself,\nas he was to others. 'Genuine fortitude,' he would assert, 'consisted in\ngoverning our own emotions, and making allowance for the weaknesses in\nour friends, that we would not tolerate in ourselves.' But where is my\nfond regret leading me!\n\n\"'Women must be submissive,' said my landlady. 'Indeed what could most\nwomen do? Who had they to maintain them, but their husbands? Every\nwoman, and especially a lady, could not go through rough and smooth, as\nshe had done, to earn a little bread.'\n\n\"She was in a talking mood, and proceeded to inform me how she had been\nused in the world. 'She knew what it was to have a bad husband, or\nshe did not know who should.' I perceived that she would be very much\nmortified, were I not to attend to her tale, and I did not attempt to\ninterrupt her, though I wished her, as soon as possible, to go out in\nsearch of a new abode for me, where I could once more hide my head.\n\n\"She began by telling me, 'That she had saved a little money in service;\nand was over-persuaded (we must all be in love once in our lives) to\nmarry a likely man, a footman in the family, not worth a groat. My\nplan,' she continued, 'was to take a house, and let out lodgings; and\nall went on well, till my husband got acquainted with an impudent slut,\nwho chose to live on other people's means--and then all went to rack and\nruin. He ran in debt to buy her fine clothes, such clothes as I never\nthought of wearing myself, and--would you believe it?--he signed an\nexecution on my very goods, bought with the money I worked so hard to\nget; and they came and took my bed from under me, before I heard a word\nof the matter. Aye, madam, these are misfortunes that you gentlefolks\nknow nothing of,--but sorrow is sorrow, let it come which way it will.\n\n\"'I sought for a service again--very hard, after having a house of my\nown!--but he used to follow me, and kick up such a riot when he was\ndrunk, that I could not keep a place; nay, he even stole my clothes, and\npawned them; and when I went to the pawnbroker's, and offered to take my\noath that they were not bought with a farthing of his money, they said,\n'It was all as one, my husband had a right to whatever I had.'\n\n\"'At last he listed for a soldier, and I took a house, making an\nagreement to pay for the furniture by degrees; and I almost starved\nmyself, till I once more got before-hand in the world.\n\n\"'After an absence of six years (God forgive me! I thought he was dead)\nmy husband returned; found me out, and came with such a penitent face,\nI forgave him, and clothed him from head to foot. But he had not been\na week in the house, before some of his creditors arrested him; and, he\nselling my goods, I found myself once more reduced to beggary; for I\nwas not as well able to work, go to bed late, and rise early, as when I\nquitted service; and then I thought it hard enough. He was soon tired of\nme, when there was nothing more to be had, and left me again.\n\n\"I will not tell you how I was buffeted about, till, hearing for certain\nthat he had died in an hospital abroad, I once more returned to my old\noccupation; but have not yet been able to get my head above water: so,\nmadam, you must not be angry if I am afraid to run any risk, when I know\nso well, that women have always the worst of it, when law is to decide.'\n\n\"After uttering a few more complaints, I prevailed on my landlady to go\nout in quest of a lodging; and, to be more secure, I condescended to the\nmean shift of changing my name.\n\n\"But why should I dwell on similar incidents!--I was hunted, like an\ninfected beast, from three different apartments, and should not have\nbeen allowed to rest in any, had not Mr. Venables, informed of my\nuncle's dangerous state of health, been inspired with the fear of\nhurrying me out of the world as I advanced in my pregnancy, by thus\ntormenting and obliging me to take sudden journeys to avoid him; and\nthen his speculations on my uncle's fortune must prove abortive.\n\n\"One day, when he had pursued me to an inn, I fainted, hurrying from\nhim; and, falling down, the sight of my blood alarmed him, and obtained\na respite for me. It is strange that he should have retained any hope,\nafter observing my unwavering determination; but, from the mildness of\nmy behaviour, when I found all my endeavours to change his disposition\nunavailing, he formed an erroneous opinion of my character, imagining\nthat, were we once more together, I should part with the money he\ncould not legally force from me, with the same facility as formerly.\nMy forbearance and occasional sympathy he had mistaken for weakness\nof character; and, because he perceived that I disliked resistance,\nhe thought my indulgence and compassion mere selfishness, and never\ndiscovered that the fear of being unjust, or of unnecessarily wounding\nthe feelings of another, was much more painful to me, than any thing I\ncould have to endure myself. Perhaps it was pride which made me imagine,\nthat I could bear what I dreaded to inflict; and that it was often\neasier to suffer, than to see the sufferings of others.\n\n\"I forgot to mention that, during this persecution, I received a letter\nfrom my uncle, informing me, 'that he only found relief from continual\nchange of air; and that he intended to return when the spring was a\nlittle more advanced (it was now the middle of February), and then we\nwould plan a journey to Italy, leaving the fogs and cares of England\nfar behind.' He approved of my conduct, promised to adopt my child,\nand seemed to have no doubt of obliging Mr. Venables to hear reason.\nHe wrote to his friend, by the same post, desiring him to call on\nMr. Venables in his name; and, in consequence of the remonstrances he\ndictated, I was permitted to lie-in tranquilly.\n\n\"The two or three weeks previous, I had been allowed to rest in peace;\nbut, so accustomed was I to pursuit and alarm, that I seldom closed my\neyes without being haunted by Mr. Venables' image, who seemed to assume\nterrific or hateful forms to torment me, wherever I turned.--Sometimes\na wild cat, a roaring bull, or hideous assassin, whom I vainly attempted\nto fly; at others he was a demon, hurrying me to the brink of a\nprecipice, plunging me into dark waves, or horrid gulfs; and I woke, in\nviolent fits of trembling anxiety, to assure myself that it was all\na dream, and to endeavour to lure my waking thoughts to wander to the\ndelightful Italian vales, I hoped soon to visit; or to picture some\naugust ruins, where I reclined in fancy on a mouldering column,\nand escaped, in the contemplation of the heart-enlarging virtues of\nantiquity, from the turmoil of cares that had depressed all the daring\npurposes of my soul. But I was not long allowed to calm my mind by\nthe exercise of my imagination; for the third day after your birth, my\nchild, I was surprised by a visit from my elder brother; who came in the\nmost abrupt manner, to inform me of the death of my uncle. He had left\nthe greater part of his fortune to my child, appointing me its guardian;\nin short, every step was taken to enable me to be mistress of his\nfortune, without putting any part of it in Mr. Venables' power. My\nbrother came to vent his rage on me, for having, as he expressed\nhimself, 'deprived him, my uncle's eldest nephew, of his inheritance;'\nthough my uncle's property, the fruit of his own exertion, being all in\nthe funds, or on landed securities, there was not a shadow of justice in\nthe charge.\n\n\"As I sincerely loved my uncle, this intelligence brought on a fever,\nwhich I struggled to conquer with all the energy of my mind; for, in my\ndesolate state, I had it very much at heart to suckle you, my poor\nbabe. You seemed my only tie to life, a cherub, to whom I wished to be\na father, as well as a mother; and the double duty appeared to me to\nproduce a proportionate increase of affection. But the pleasure I felt,\nwhile sustaining you, snatched from the wreck of hope, was cruelly\ndamped by melancholy reflections on my widowed state--widowed by the\ndeath of my uncle. Of Mr. Venables I thought not, even when I thought of\nthe felicity of loving your father, and how a mother's pleasure might\nbe exalted, and her care softened by a husband's tenderness.--'Ought to\nbe!' I exclaimed; and I endeavoured to drive away the tenderness that\nsuffocated me; but my spirits were weak, and the unbidden tears would\nflow. 'Why was I,' I would ask thee, but thou didst not heed me,--'cut\noff from the participation of the sweetest pleasure of life?' I imagined\nwith what extacy, after the pains of child-bed, I should have presented\nmy little stranger, whom I had so long wished to view, to a respectable\nfather, and with what maternal fondness I should have pressed them both\nto my heart!--Now I kissed her with less delight, though with the most\nendearing compassion, poor helpless one! when I perceived a slight\nresemblance of him, to whom she owed her existence; or, if any gesture\nreminded me of him, even in his best days, my heart heaved, and I\npressed the innocent to my bosom, as if to purify it--yes, I blushed to\nthink that its purity had been sullied, by allowing such a man to be its\nfather.\n\n\"After my recovery, I began to think of taking a house in the country,\nor of making an excursion on the continent, to avoid Mr. Venables; and\nto open my heart to new pleasures and affection. The spring was melting\ninto summer, and you, my little companion, began to smile--that smile\nmade hope bud out afresh, assuring me the world was not a desert. Your\ngestures were ever present to my fancy; and I dwelt on the joy I should\nfeel when you would begin to walk and lisp. Watching your wakening mind,\nand shielding from every rude blast my tender blossom, I recovered my\nspirits--I dreamed not of the frost--'the killing frost,' to which you\nwere destined to be exposed.--But I lose all patience--and execrate the\ninjustice of the world--folly! ignorance!--I should rather call it; but,\nshut up from a free circulation of thought, and always pondering on the\nsame griefs, I writhe under the torturing apprehensions, which ought to\nexcite only honest indignation, or active compassion; and would, could\nI view them as the natural consequence of things. But, born a woman--and\nborn to suffer, in endeavouring to repress my own emotions, I feel more\nacutely the various ills my sex are fated to bear--I feel that the evils\nthey are subject to endure, degrade them so far below their oppressors,\nas almost to justify their tyranny; leading at the same time superficial\nreasoners to term that weakness the cause, which is only the consequence\nof short-sighted despotism.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14\n\n\n\"AS MY MIND grew calmer, the visions of Italy again returned with their\nformer glow of colouring; and I resolved on quitting the kingdom for\na time, in search of the cheerfulness, that naturally results from a\nchange of scene, unless we carry the barbed arrow with us, and only see\nwhat we feel.\n\n\"During the period necessary to prepare for a long absence, I sent a\nsupply to pay my father's debts, and settled my brothers in eligible\nsituations; but my attention was not wholly engrossed by my family,\nthough I do not think it necessary to enumerate the common exertions of\nhumanity. The manner in which my uncle's property was settled, prevented\nme from making the addition to the fortune of my surviving sister, that\nI could have wished; but I had prevailed on him to bequeath her two\nthousand pounds, and she determined to marry a lover, to whom she had\nbeen some time attached. Had it not been for this engagement, I should\nhave invited her to accompany me in my tour; and I might have escaped\nthe pit, so artfully dug in my path, when I was the least aware of\ndanger.\n\n\"I had thought of remaining in England, till I weaned my child; but this\nstate of freedom was too peaceful to last, and I had soon reason to wish\nto hasten my departure. A friend of Mr. Venables, the same attorney\nwho had accompanied him in several excursions to hunt me from my hiding\nplaces, waited on me to propose a reconciliation. On my refusal, he\nindirectly advised me to make over to my husband--for husband he would\nterm him--the greater part of the property I had at command, menacing\nme with continual persecution unless I complied, and that, as a last\nresort, he would claim the child. I did not, though intimidated by the\nlast insinuation, scruple to declare, that I would not allow him to\nsquander the money left to me for far different purposes, but offered\nhim five hundred pounds, if he would sign a bond not to torment me any\nmore. My maternal anxiety made me thus appear to waver from my first\ndetermination, and probably suggested to him, or his diabolical agent,\nthe infernal plot, which has succeeded but too well.\n\n\"The bond was executed; still I was impatient to leave England. Mischief\nhung in the air when we breathed the same; I wanted seas to divide us,\nand waters to roll between, till he had forgotten that I had the means\nof helping him through a new scheme. Disturbed by the late occurrences,\nI instantly prepared for my departure. My only delay was waiting for a\nmaid-servant, who spoke French fluently, and had been warmly recommended\nto me. A valet I was advised to hire, when I fixed on my place of\nresidence for any time.\n\n\"My God, with what a light heart did I set out for Dover!--It was not\nmy country, but my cares, that I was leaving behind. My heart seemed\nto bound with the wheels, or rather appeared the centre on which\nthey twirled. I clasped you to my bosom, exclaiming 'And you will be\nsafe--quite safe--when--we are once on board the packet.--Would we were\nthere!' I smiled at my idle fears, as the natural effect of continual\nalarm; and I scarcely owned to myself that I dreaded Mr. Venables's\ncunning, or was conscious of the horrid delight he would feel, at\nforming stratagem after stratagem to circumvent me. I was already in\nthe snare--I never reached the packet--I never saw thee more.--I grow\nbreathless. I have scarcely patience to write down the details. The\nmaid--the plausible woman I had hired--put, doubtless, some stupefying\npotion in what I ate or drank, the morning I left town. All I know is,\nthat she must have quitted the chaise, shameless wretch! and taken (from\nmy breast) my babe with her. How could a creature in a female form\nsee me caress thee, and steal thee from my arms! I must stop, stop to\nrepress a mother's anguish; lest, in bitterness of soul, I imprecate the\nwrath of heaven on this tiger, who tore my only comfort from me.\n\n\"How long I slept I know not; certainly many hours, for I woke at the\nclose of day, in a strange confusion of thought. I was probably roused\nto recollection by some one thundering at a huge, unwieldy gate.\nAttempting to ask where I was, my voice died away, and I tried to\nraise it in vain, as I have done in a dream. I looked for my babe\nwith affright; feared that it had fallen out of my lap, while I had so\nstrangely forgotten her; and, such was the vague intoxication, I can\ngive it no other name, in which I was plunged, I could not recollect\nwhen or where I last saw you; but I sighed, as if my heart wanted room\nto clear my head.\n\n\"The gates opened heavily, and the sullen sound of many locks and\nbolts drawn back, grated on my very soul, before I was appalled by the\ncreeking of the dismal hinges, as they closed after me. The gloomy pile\nwas before me, half in ruins; some of the aged trees of the avenue were\ncut down, and left to rot where they fell; and as we approached some\nmouldering steps, a monstrous dog darted forwards to the length of his\nchain, and barked and growled infernally.\n\n\"The door was opened slowly, and a murderous visage peeped out, with a\nlantern. 'Hush!' he uttered, in a threatning tone, and the affrighted\nanimal stole back to his kennel. The door of the chaise flew back, the\nstranger put down the lantern, and clasped his dreadful arms around me.\nIt was certainly the effect of the soporific draught, for, instead of\nexerting my strength, I sunk without motion, though not without sense,\non his shoulder, my limbs refusing to obey my will. I was carried up the\nsteps into a close-shut hall. A candle flaring in the socket, scarcely\ndispersed the darkness, though it displayed to me the ferocious\ncountenance of the wretch who held me.\n\n\"He mounted a wide staircase. Large figures painted on the walls seemed\nto start on me, and glaring eyes to meet me at every turn. Entering a\nlong gallery, a dismal shriek made me spring out of my conductor's arms,\nwith I know not what mysterious emotion of terror; but I fell on the\nfloor, unable to sustain myself.\n\n\"A strange-looking female started out of one of the recesses, and\nobserved me with more curiosity than interest; till, sternly bid\nretire, she flitted back like a shadow. Other faces, strongly marked,\nor distorted, peeped through the half-opened doors, and I heard some\nincoherent sounds. I had no distinct idea where I could be--I looked on\nall sides, and almost doubted whether I was alive or dead.\n\n\"Thrown on a bed, I immediately sunk into insensibility again; and\nnext day, gradually recovering the use of reason, I began, starting\naffrighted from the conviction, to discover where I was confined--I\ninsisted on seeing the master of the mansion--I saw him--and perceived\nthat I was buried alive.--\n\n\"Such, my child, are the events of thy mother's life to this dreadful\nmoment--Should she ever escape from the fangs of her enemies, she will\nadd the secrets of her prison-house--and--\"\n\nSome lines were here crossed out, and the memoirs broke off abruptly\nwith the names of Jemima and Darnford.\n\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nADVERTISEMENT*\n\n\n\nTHE performance, with a fragment of which the reader has now been\npresented, was designed to consist of three parts. The preceding sheets\nwere considered as constituting one of those parts. Those persons who in\nthe perusal of the chapters, already written and in some degree finished\nby the author, have felt their hearts awakened, and their curiosity\nexcited as to the sequel of the story, will, of course, gladly accept\neven of the broken paragraphs and half-finished sentences, which have\nbeen found committed to paper, as materials for the remainder. The\nfastidious and cold-hearted critic may perhaps feel himself repelled\nby the incoherent form in which they are presented. But an inquisitive\ntemper willingly accepts the most imperfect and mutilated information,\nwhere better is not to be had: and readers, who in any degree resemble\nthe author in her quick apprehension of sentiment, and of the pleasures\nand pains of imagination, will, I believe, find gratification, in\ncontemplating sketches, which were designed in a short time to have\nreceived the finishing touches of her genius; but which must now for\never remain a mark to record the triumphs of mortality, over schemes of\nusefulness, and projects of public interest.\n\n     * Presumed to have been written by Godwin [Publisher's note].\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15\n\n\nDARNFORD returned the memoirs to Maria, with a most affectionate letter,\nin which he reasoned on \"the absurdity of the laws respecting matrimony,\nwhich, till divorces could be more easily obtained, was,\" he declared,\n\"the most insufferable bondage.\" Ties of this nature could not bind minds\ngoverned by superior principles; and such beings were privileged to act\nabove the dictates of laws they had no voice in framing, if they had\nsufficient strength of mind to endure the natural consequence. In her\ncase, to talk of duty, was a farce, excepting what was due to herself.\nDelicacy, as well as reason, forbade her ever to think of returning to\nher husband: was she then to restrain her charming sensibility through\nmere prejudice? These arguments were not absolutely impartial, for he\ndisdained to conceal, that, when he appealed to her reason, he felt\nthat he had some interest in her heart.--The conviction was not more\ntransporting, than sacred--a thousand times a day, he asked himself how\nhe had merited such happiness?--and as often he determined to purify the\nheart she deigned to inhabit--He intreated to be again admitted to her\npresence.\n\nHe was; and the tear which glistened in his eye, when he respectfully\npressed her to his bosom, rendered him peculiarly dear to the\nunfortunate mother. Grief had stilled the transports of love, only to\nrender their mutual tenderness more touching. In former interviews,\nDarnford had contrived, by a hundred little pretexts, to sit near\nher, to take her hand, or to meet her eyes--now it was all soothing\naffection, and esteem seemed to have rivalled love. He adverted to her\nnarrative, and spoke with warmth of the oppression she had endured.--His\neyes, glowing with a lambent flame, told her how much he wished to\nrestore her to liberty and love; but he kissed her hand, as if it had\nbeen that of a saint; and spoke of the loss of her child, as if it had\nbeen his own.--What could have been more flattering to Maria?--Every\ninstance of self-denial was registered in her heart, and she loved him,\nfor loving her too well to give way to the transports of passion.\n\nThey met again and again; and Darnford declared, while passion suffused\nhis cheeks, that he never before knew what it was to love.--\n\nOne morning Jemima informed Maria, that her master intended to wait on\nher, and speak to her without witnesses. He came, and brought a letter\nwith him, pretending that he was ignorant of its contents, though he\ninsisted on having it returned to him. It was from the attorney already\nmentioned, who informed her of the death of her child, and hinted, \"that\nshe could not now have a legitimate heir, and that, would she make over\nthe half of her fortune during life, she should be conveyed to Dover,\nand permitted to pursue her plan of travelling.\"\n\nMaria answered with warmth, \"That she had no terms to make with the\nmurderer of her babe, nor would she purchase liberty at the price of her\nown respect.\"\n\nShe began to expostulate with her jailor; but he sternly bade her \"Be\nsilent--he had not gone so far, not to go further.\"\n\nDarnford came in the evening. Jemima was obliged to be absent, and\nshe, as usual, locked the door on them, to prevent interruption or\ndiscovery.--The lovers were, at first, embarrassed; but fell insensibly\ninto confidential discourse. Darnford represented, \"that they might\nsoon be parted,\" and wished her \"to put it out of the power of fate to\nseparate them.\"\n\nAs her husband she now received him, and he solemnly pledged himself as\nher protector--and eternal friend.--\n\nThere was one peculiarity in Maria's mind: she was more anxious not to\ndeceive, than to guard against deception; and had rather trust without\nsufficient reason, than be for ever the prey of doubt. Besides, what\nare we, when the mind has, from reflection, a certain kind of elevation,\nwhich exalts the contemplation above the little concerns of prudence! We\nsee what we wish, and make a world of our own--and, though reality may\nsometimes open a door to misery, yet the moments of happiness procured\nby the imagination, may, without a paradox, be reckoned among the solid\ncomforts of life. Maria now, imagining that she had found a being of\ncelestial mould--was happy,--nor was she deceived.--He was then plastic\nin her impassioned hand--and reflected all the sentiments which animated\nand warmed her.*\n\n     * Two and a half lines of dashes follow here in the original\n     [Publisher's note].\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16\n\n\nONE morning confusion seemed to reign in the house, and Jemima came\nin terror, to inform Maria, \"that her master had left it, with a\ndetermination, she was assured (and too many circumstances corroborated\nthe opinion, to leave a doubt of its truth) of never returning. I am\nprepared then,\" said Jemima, \"to accompany you in your flight.\"\n\nMaria started up, her eyes darting towards the door, as if afraid that\nsome one should fasten it on her for ever.\n\nJemima continued, \"I have perhaps no right now to expect the performance\nof your promise; but on you it depends to reconcile me with the human\nrace.\"\n\n\"But Darnford!\"--exclaimed Maria, mournfully--sitting down again, and\ncrossing her arms--\"I have no child to go to, and liberty has lost its\nsweets.\"\n\n\"I am much mistaken, if Darnford is not the cause of my master's\nflight--his keepers assure me, that they have promised to confine him\ntwo days longer, and then he will be free--you cannot see him; but they\nwill give a letter to him the moment he is free.--In that inform\nhim where he may find you in London; fix on some hotel. Give me your\nclothes; I will send them out of the house with mine, and we will\nslip out at the garden-gate. Write your letter while I make these\narrangements, but lose no time!\"\n\nIn an agitation of spirit, not to be calmed, Maria began to write to\nDarnford. She called him by the sacred name of \"husband,\" and bade him\n\"hasten to her, to share her fortune, or she would return to him.\"--An\nhotel in the Adelphi was the place of rendezvous.\n\nThe letter was sealed and given in charge; and with light footsteps, yet\nterrified at the sound of them, she descended, scarcely breathing, and\nwith an indistinct fear that she should never get out at the garden\ngate. Jemima went first.\n\nA being, with a visage that would have suited one possessed by a devil,\ncrossed the path, and seized Maria by the arm. Maria had no fear but of\nbeing detained--\"Who are you? what are you?\" for the form was scarcely\nhuman. \"If you are made of flesh and blood,\" his ghastly eyes glared on\nher, \"do not stop me!\"\n\n\"Woman,\" interrupted a sepulchral voice, \"what have I to do with\nthee?\"--Still he grasped her hand, muttering a curse.\n\n\"No, no; you have nothing to do with me,\" she exclaimed, \"this is a\nmoment of life and death!\"--\n\nWith supernatural force she broke from him, and, throwing her arms round\nJemima, cried, \"Save me!\" The being, from whose grasp she had loosed\nherself, took up a stone as they opened the door, and with a kind of\nhellish sport threw it after them. They were out of his reach.\n\nWhen Maria arrived in town, she drove to the hotel already fixed on. But\nshe could not sit still--her child was ever before her; and all that had\npassed during her confinement, appeared to be a dream. She went to the\nhouse in the suburbs, where, as she now discovered, her babe had been\nsent. The moment she entered, her heart grew sick; but she wondered not\nthat it had proved its grave. She made the necessary enquiries, and the\nchurch-yard was pointed out, in which it rested under a turf. A little\nfrock which the nurse's child wore (Maria had made it herself) caught\nher eye. The nurse was glad to sell it for half-a-guinea, and Maria\nhastened away with the relic, and, reentering the hackney-coach which\nwaited for her, gazed on it, till she reached her hotel.\n\nShe then waited on the attorney who had made her uncle's will, and\nexplained to him her situation. He readily advanced her some of the\nmoney which still remained in his hands, and promised to take the whole\nof the case into consideration. Maria only wished to be permitted to\nremain in quiet--She found that several bills, apparently with her\nsignature, had been presented to her agent, nor was she for a moment\nat a loss to guess by whom they had been forged; yet, equally averse to\nthreaten or intreat, she requested her friend [the solicitor] to call on\nMr. Venables. He was not to be found at home; but at length his agent,\nthe attorney, offered a conditional promise to Maria, to leave her in\npeace, as long as she behaved with propriety, if she would give up the\nnotes. Maria inconsiderately consented--Darnford was arrived, and she\nwished to be only alive to love; she wished to forget the anguish she\nfelt whenever she thought of her child.\n\nThey took a ready furnished lodging together, for she was above\ndisguise; Jemima insisting on being considered as her house-keeper, and\nto receive the customary stipend. On no other terms would she remain\nwith her friend.\n\nDarnford was indefatigable in tracing the mysterious circumstances of\nhis confinement. The cause was simply, that a relation, a very distant\none, to whom he was heir, had died intestate, leaving a considerable\nfortune. On the news of Darnford's arrival [in England, a person,\nintrusted with the management of the property, and who had the writings\nin his possession, determining, by one bold stroke, to strip Darnford\nof the succession,] had planned his confinement; and [as soon as he had\ntaken the measures he judged most conducive to his object, this ruffian,\ntogether with his instrument,] the keeper of the private mad-house,\nleft the kingdom. Darnford, who still pursued his enquiries, at last\ndiscovered that they had fixed their place of refuge at Paris.\n\nMaria and he determined therefore, with the faithful Jemima, to visit\nthat metropolis, and accordingly were preparing for the journey, when\nthey were informed that Mr. Venables had commenced an action against\nDarnford for seduction and adultery. The indignation Maria felt cannot\nbe explained; she repented of the forbearance she had exercised in\ngiving up the notes. Darnford could not put off his journey, without\nrisking the loss of his property: Maria therefore furnished him with\nmoney for his expedition; and determined to remain in London till the\ntermination of this affair.\n\nShe visited some ladies with whom she had formerly been intimate, but\nwas refused admittance; and at the opera, or Ranelagh, they could not\nrecollect her. Among these ladies there were some, not her most intimate\nacquaintance, who were generally supposed to avail themselves of the\ncloke of marriage, to conceal a mode of conduct, that would for ever\nhave damned their fame, had they been innocent, seduced girls. These\nparticularly stood aloof.--Had she remained with her husband, practicing\ninsincerity, and neglecting her child to manage an intrigue, she would\nstill have been visited and respected. If, instead of openly living\nwith her lover, she could have condescended to call into play a thousand\narts, which, degrading her own mind, might have allowed the people who\nwere not deceived, to pretend to be so, she would have been caressed and\ntreated like an honourable woman. \"And Brutus* is an honourable man!\"\nsaid Mark-Antony with equal sincerity.\n\n     * The name in the manuscript is by mistake written Caesar.\n     EDITOR. [Godwin's note]\n\nWith Darnford she did not taste uninterrupted felicity; there was a\nvolatility in his manner which often distressed her; but love gladdened\nthe scene; besides, he was the most tender, sympathizing creature in the\nworld. A fondness for the sex often gives an appearance of humanity to\nthe behaviour of men, who have small pretensions to the reality;\nand they seem to love others, when they are only pursuing their own\ngratification. Darnford appeared ever willing to avail himself of her\ntaste and acquirements, while she endeavoured to profit by his decision\nof character, and to eradicate some of the romantic notions, which had\ntaken root in her mind, while in adversity she had brooded over visions\nof unattainable bliss.\n\nThe real affections of life, when they are allowed to burst forth, are\nbuds pregnant with joy and all the sweet emotions of the soul; yet they\nbranch out with wild ease, unlike the artificial forms of felicity,\nsketched by an imagination painful alive. The substantial happiness,\nwhich enlarges and civilizes the mind, may be compared to the pleasure\nexperienced in roving through nature at large, inhaling the sweet gale\nnatural to the clime; while the reveries of a feverish imagination\ncontinually sport themselves in gardens full of aromatic shrubs, which\ncloy while they delight, and weaken the sense of pleasure they gratify.\nThe heaven of fancy, below or beyond the stars, in this life, or in\nthose ever-smiling regions surrounded by the unmarked ocean of futurity,\nhave an insipid uniformity which palls. Poets have imagined scenes of\nbliss; but, sencing out sorrow, all the extatic emotions of the Soul,\nand even its grandeur, seem to be equally excluded. We dose over the\nunruffled lake, and long to scale the rocks which fence the happy valley\nof contentment, though serpents hiss in the pathless desert, and danger\nlurks in the unexplored wiles. Maria found herself more indulgent as\nshe was happier, and discovered virtues, in characters she had before\ndisregarded, while chasing the phantoms of elegance and excellence,\nwhich sported in the meteors that exhale in the marshes of misfortune.\nThe heart is often shut by romance against social pleasure; and,\nfostering a sickly sensibility, grows callous to the soft touches of\nhumanity.\n\nTo part with Darnford was indeed cruel.--It was to feel most painfully\nalone; but she rejoiced to think, that she should spare him the care and\nperplexity of the suit, and meet him again, all his own. Marriage, as\nat present constituted, she considered as leading to immorality--yet,\nas the odium of society impedes usefulness, she wished to avow her\naffection to Darnford, by becoming his wife according to established\nrules; not to be confounded with women who act from very different\nmotives, though her conduct would be just the same without the ceremony\nas with it, and her expectations from him not less firm. The being\nsummoned to defend herself from a charge which she was determined to\nplead guilty to, was still galling, as it roused bitter reflections on\nthe situation of women in society.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17\n\n\nSUCH was her state of mind when the dogs of law were let loose on her.\nMaria took the task of conducting Darnford's defence upon herself. She\ninstructed his counsel to plead guilty to the charge of adultery; but to\ndeny that of seduction.\n\nThe counsel for the plaintiff opened the cause, by observing, \"that his\nclient had ever been an indulgent husband, and had borne with several\ndefects of temper, while he had nothing criminal to lay to the charge\nof his wife. But that she left his house without assigning any cause. He\ncould not assert that she was then acquainted with the defendant; yet,\nwhen he was once endeavouring to bring her back to her home, this man\nput the peace-officers to flight, and took her he knew not whither.\nAfter the birth of her child, her conduct was so strange, and a\nmelancholy malady having afflicted one of the family, which delicacy\nforbade the dwelling on, it was necessary to confine her. By some\nmeans the defendant enabled her to make her escape, and they had lived\ntogether, in despite of all sense of order and decorum. The adultery was\nallowed, it was not necessary to bring any witnesses to prove it; but\nthe seduction, though highly probable from the circumstances which he\nhad the honour to state, could not be so clearly proved.--It was of the\nmost atrocious kind, as decency was set at defiance, and respect for\nreputation, which shows internal compunction, utterly disregarded.\"\n\nA strong sense of injustice had silenced every motion, which a mixture\nof true and false delicacy might otherwise have excited in Maria's\nbosom. She only felt in earnest to insist on the privilege of her\nnature. The sarcasms of society, and the condemnations of a mistaken\nworld, were nothing to her, compared with acting contrary to those\nfeelings which were the foundation of her principles. [She therefore\neagerly put herself forward, instead of desiring to be absent, on this\nmemorable occasion.]\n\nConvinced that the subterfuges of the law were disgraceful, she wrote a\npaper, which she expressly desired might be read in court:\n\n\"Married when scarcely able to distinguish the nature of the engagement,\nI yet submitted to the rigid laws which enslave women, and obeyed the\nman whom I could no longer love. Whether the duties of the state are\nreciprocal, I mean not to discuss; but I can prove repeated infidelities\nwhich I overlooked or pardoned. Witnesses are not wanting to establish\nthese facts. I at present maintain the child of a maid servant, sworn\nto him, and born after our marriage. I am ready to allow, that education\nand circumstances lead men to think and act with less delicacy, than the\npreservation of order in society demands from women; but surely I may\nwithout assumption declare, that, though I could excuse the birth, I\ncould not the desertion of this unfortunate babe:--and, while I\ndespised the man, it was not easy to venerate the husband. With proper\nrestrictions however, I revere the institution which fraternizes the\nworld. I exclaim against the laws which throw the whole weight of\nthe yoke on the weaker shoulders, and force women, when they claim\nprotectorship as mothers, to sign a contract, which renders them\ndependent on the caprice of the tyrant, whom choice or necessity has\nappointed to reign over them. Various are the cases, in which a woman\nought to separate herself from her husband; and mine, I may be allowed\nemphatically to insist, comes under the description of the most\naggravated.\n\n\"I will not enlarge on those provocations which only the individual can\nestimate; but will bring forward such charges only, the truth of which\nis an insult upon humanity. In order to promote certain destructive\nspeculations, Mr. Venables prevailed on me to borrow certain sums of a\nwealthy relation; and, when I refused further compliance, he thought of\nbartering my person; and not only allowed opportunities to, but urged,\na friend from whom he borrowed money, to seduce me. On the discovery of\nthis act of atrocity, I determined to leave him, and in the most\ndecided manner, for ever. I consider all obligations as made void by his\nconduct; and hold, that schisms which proceed from want of principles,\ncan never be healed.\n\n\"He received a fortune with me to the amount of five thousand pounds.\nOn the death of my uncle, convinced that I could provide for my child, I\ndestroyed the settlement of that fortune. I required none of my property\nto be returned to me, nor shall enumerate the sums extorted from me\nduring six years that we lived together.\n\n\"After leaving, what the law considers as my home, I was hunted like a\ncriminal from place to place, though I contracted no debts, and demanded\nno maintenance--yet, as the laws sanction such proceeding, and make\nwomen the property of their husbands, I forbear to animadvert. After\nthe birth of my daughter, and the death of my uncle, who left a\nvery considerable property to myself and child, I was exposed to new\npersecution; and, because I had, before arriving at what is termed years\nof discretion, pledged my faith, I was treated by the world, as bound\nfor ever to a man whose vices were notorious. Yet what are the vices\ngenerally known, to the various miseries that a woman may be subject to,\nwhich, though deeply felt, eating into the soul, elude description, and\nmay be glossed over! A false morality is even established, which\nmakes all the virtue of women consist in chastity, submission, and the\nforgiveness of injuries.\n\n\"I pardon my oppressor--bitterly as I lament the loss of my child, torn\nfrom me in the most violent manner. But nature revolts, and my soul\nsickens at the bare supposition, that it could ever be a duty to pretend\naffection, when a separation is necessary to prevent my feeling hourly\naversion.\n\n\"To force me to give my fortune, I was imprisoned--yes; in a private\nmad-house.--There, in the heart of misery, I met the man charged with\nseducing me. We became attached--I deemed, and ever shall deem, myself\nfree. The death of my babe dissolved the only tie which subsisted\nbetween me and my, what is termed, lawful husband.\n\n\"To this person, thus encountered, I voluntarily gave myself, never\nconsidering myself as any more bound to transgress the laws of moral\npurity, because the will of my husband might be pleaded in my excuse,\nthan to transgress those laws to which [the policy of artificial society\nhas] annexed [positive] punishments.--While no command of a husband can\nprevent a woman from suffering for certain crimes, she must be allowed\nto consult her conscience, and regulate her conduct, in some degree, by\nher own sense of right. The respect I owe to myself, demanded my strict\nadherence to my determination of never viewing Mr. Venables in the light\nof a husband, nor could it forbid me from encouraging another. If I am\nunfortunately united to an unprincipled man, am I for ever to be shut\nout from fulfilling the duties of a wife and mother?--I wish my country\nto approve of my conduct; but, if laws exist, made by the strong to\noppress the weak, I appeal to my own sense of justice, and declare\nthat I will not live with the individual, who has violated every moral\nobligation which binds man to man.\n\n\"I protest equally against any charge being brought to criminate the\nman, whom I consider as my husband. I was six-and-twenty when I left\nMr. Venables' roof; if ever I am to be supposed to arrive at an age to\ndirect my own actions, I must by that time have arrived at it.--I acted\nwith deliberation.--Mr. Darnford found me a forlorn and oppressed\nwoman, and promised the protection women in the present state of society\nwant.--But the man who now claims me--was he deprived of my society by\nthis conduct? The question is an insult to common sense, considering\nwhere Mr. Darnford met me.--Mr. Venables' door was indeed open to\nme--nay, threats and intreaties were used to induce me to return; but\nwhy? Was affection or honour the motive?--I cannot, it is true, dive\ninto the recesses of the human heart--yet I presume to assert,\n[borne out as I am by a variety of circumstances,] that he was merely\ninfluenced by the most rapacious avarice.\n\n\"I claim then a divorce, and the liberty of enjoying, free from\nmolestation, the fortune left to me by a relation, who was well aware\nof the character of the man with whom I had to contend.--I appeal to the\njustice and humanity of the jury--a body of men, whose private judgment\nmust be allowed to modify laws, that must be unjust, because definite\nrules can never apply to indefinite circumstances--and I deprecate\npunishment upon the man of my choice, freeing him, as I solemnly do,\nfrom the charge of seduction.\n\n\"I did not put myself into a situation to justify a charge of adultery,\ntill I had, from conviction, shaken off the fetters which bound me to\nMr. Venables.--While I lived with him, I defy the voice of calumny to\nsully what is termed the fair fame of woman.--Neglected by my husband,\nI never encouraged a lover; and preserved with scrupulous care, what is\ntermed my honour, at the expence of my peace, till he, who should have\nbeen its guardian, laid traps to ensnare me. From that moment I believed\nmyself, in the sight of heaven, free--and no power on earth shall force\nme to renounce my resolution.\"\n\nThe judge, in summing up the evidence, alluded to \"the fallacy of\nletting women plead their feelings, as an excuse for the violation of\nthe marriage-vow. For his part, he had always determined to oppose all\ninnovation, and the newfangled notions which incroached on the good old\nrules of conduct. We did not want French principles in public or private\nlife--and, if women were allowed to plead their feelings, as an excuse\nor palliation of infidelity, it was opening a flood-gate for immorality.\nWhat virtuous woman thought of her feelings?--It was her duty to love\nand obey the man chosen by her parents and relations, who were qualified\nby their experience to judge better for her, than she could for\nherself. As to the charges brought against the husband, they were vague,\nsupported by no witnesses, excepting that of imprisonment in a private\nmadhouse. The proofs of an insanity in the family, might render that\nhowever a prudent measure; and indeed the conduct of the lady did not\nappear that of a person of sane mind. Still such a mode of proceeding\ncould not be justified, and might perhaps entitle the lady [in another\ncourt] to a sentence of separation from bed and board, during the joint\nlives of the parties; but he hoped that no Englishman would legalize\nadultery, by enabling the adulteress to enrich her seducer. Too many\nrestrictions could not be thrown in the way of divorces, if we wished to\nmaintain the sanctity of marriage; and, though they might bear a little\nhard on a few, very few individuals, it was evidently for the good of\nthe whole.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nBY THE EDITOR *\n\n     * i.e., Godwin [Publisher's note].\n\nVERY FEW hints exist respecting the plan of the remainder of the work.\nI find only two detached sentences, and some scattered heads for the\ncontinuation of the story. I transcribe the whole.\n\nI. \"Darnford's letters were affectionate; but circumstances occasioned\ndelays, and the miscarriage of some letters rendered the reception of\nwished-for answers doubtful: his return was necessary to calm Maria's\nmind.\"\n\nII. \"As Darnford had informed her that his business was settled, his\ndelaying to return seemed extraordinary; but love to excess, excludes\nfear or suspicion.\"\n\nThe scattered heads for the continuation of the story, are as follow. *\n\n     * To understand these minutes, it is necessary the reader\n     should consider each of them as setting out from the same\n     point in the story, viz. the point to which it is brought\n     down in the preceding chapter. [Godwin's note]\n\nI. \"Trial for adultery--Maria defends herself--A separation from bed and\nboard is the consequence--Her fortune is thrown into chancery--Darnford\nobtains a part of his property--Maria goes into the country.\"\n\nII. \"A prosecution for adultery commenced--Trial--Darnford sets out\nfor France--Letters--Once more pregnant--He returns--Mysterious\nbehaviour--Visit--Expectation--Discovery--Interview--Consequence.\"\n\nIII. \"Sued by her husband--Damages awarded to him--Separation from bed\nand board--Darnford goes abroad--Maria into the country--Provides for\nher father--Is shunned--Returns to London--Expects to see her lover--The\nrack of expectation--Finds herself again with child--Delighted--A\ndiscovery--A visit--A miscarriage--Conclusion.\"\n\nIV. \"Divorced by her husband--Her lover\nunfaithful--Pregnancy--Miscarriage--Suicide.\"\n\n\n\n[The following passage appears in some respects to deviate from the\npreceding hints. It is superscribed] \"THE END.\n\n\"She swallowed the laudanum; her soul was calm--the tempest had\nsubsided--and nothing remained but an eager longing to forget\nherself--to fly from the anguish she endured to escape from\nthought--from this hell of disappointment.\n\n\"Still her eyes closed not--one remembrance with frightful velocity\nfollowed another--All the incidents of her life were in arms, embodied\nto assail her, and prevent her sinking into the sleep of death.--Her\nmurdered child again appeared to her, mourning for the babe of which she\nwas the tomb.--'And could it have a nobler?--Surely it is better to\ndie with me, than to enter on life without a mother's care!--I\ncannot live!--but could I have deserted my child the moment it was\nborn?--thrown it on the troubled wave of life, without a hand to support\nit?'--She looked up: 'What have I not suffered!--may I find a father\nwhere I am going!--Her head turned; a stupor ensued; a faintness--'Have\na little patience,' said Maria, holding her swimming head (she thought\nof her mother), 'this cannot last long; and what is a little bodily pain\nto the pangs I have endured?'\n\n\"A new vision swam before her. Jemima seemed to enter--leading a little\ncreature, that, with tottering footsteps, approached the bed. The voice\nof Jemima sounding as at a distance, called her--she tried to listen, to\nspeak, to look!\n\n\"'Behold your child!' exclaimed Jemima. Maria started off the bed, and\nfainted.--Violent vomiting followed.\n\n\"When she was restored to life, Jemima addressed her with great\nsolemnity: '----- led me to suspect, that your husband and brother\nhad deceived you, and secreted the child. I would not torment you with\ndoubtful hopes, and I left you (at a fatal moment) to search for the\nchild!--I snatched her from misery--and (now she is alive again) would\nyou leave her alone in the world, to endure what I have endured?'\n\n\"Maria gazed wildly at her, her whole frame was convulsed with emotion;\nwhen the child, whom Jemima had been tutoring all the journey, uttered\nthe word 'Mamma!' She caught her to her bosom, and burst into a passion\nof tears--then, resting the child gently on the bed, as if afraid of\nkilling it,--she put her hand to her eyes, to conceal as it were the\nagonizing struggle of her soul. She remained silent for five minutes,\ncrossing her arms over her bosom, and reclining her head,--then\nexclaimed: 'The conflict is over!--I will live for my child!'\"\n\n\nA few readers perhaps, in looking over these hints, will wonder how it\ncould have been practicable, without tediousness, or remitting in any\ndegree the interest of the story, to have filled, from these slight\nsketches, a number of pages, more considerable than those which have\nbeen already presented. But, in reality, these hints, simple as they\nare, are pregnant with passion and distress. It is the refuge of barren\nauthors only, to crowd their fictions with so great a number of events,\nas to suffer no one of them to sink into the reader's mind. It is\nthe province of true genius to develop events, to discover their\ncapabilities, to ascertain the different passions and sentiments with\nwhich they are fraught, and to diversify them with incidents, that give\nreality to the picture, and take a hold upon the mind of a reader of\ntaste, from which they can never be loosened. It was particularly\nthe design of the author, in the present instance, to make her story\nsubordinate to a great moral purpose, that \"of exhibiting the misery and\noppression, peculiar to women, that arise out of the partial laws and\ncustoms of society.--This view restrained her fancy.\"* It was necessary\nfor her, to place in a striking point of view, evils that are too\nfrequently overlooked, and to drag into light those details of\noppression, of which the grosser and more insensible part of mankind\nmake little account.\n\n     * See author's preface.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":966,"split":"train"}
