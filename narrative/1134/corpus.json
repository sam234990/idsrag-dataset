{"ori_id":"14fc0de61e9e8044764da1fb9f647d8ceb60e561","title":"A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy","context":"A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy\n Yorick's journey starts in Calais, where he meets a monk who begs for donations to his convent. Yorick initially refuses to give him anything, but later regrets his decision. He and the monk exchange their snuff-boxes. He buys a chaise to continue his journey. The next town he visits is Montreuil, where he hires a servant to accompany him on his journey, a young man named La Fleur.\nDuring his stay in Paris, Yorick is informed that the police inquired for his passport at his hotel. Without a passport at a time when England is at war with France (Sterne traveled to Paris in January 1762, before the Seven Years' War ended), he risks imprisonment in the Bastille. Yorick decides to travel to Versailles where he visits the Count de B**** to acquire a passport. When Yorick notices the count reads Hamlet, he points with his finger at Yorick's name, mentioning that he is Yorick. The count mistakes him for the king's jester and quickly procures him a passport. Yorick fails in his attempt to correct the count, and remains satisfied with receiving his passport so quickly.\nYorick returns to Paris, and continues his voyage to Italy after staying in Paris for a few more days. Along the way he decides to visit Maria\u00e2\u0080\u0094who was introduced in Sterne's previous novel, Tristram Shandy\u00e2\u0080\u0094in Moulins. Maria's mother tells Yorick that Maria has been struck with grief since her husband died. Yorick consoles Maria, and then leaves.\nAfter having passed Lyon during his journey, Yorick spends the night in a roadside inn. Because there is only one bedroom, he is forced to share the room with a lady and her chamber-maid (\"fille de chambre\"). When Yorick can't sleep and accidentally breaks his promise to remain silent during the night, an altercation with the lady ensues. During the confusion, Yorick accidentally grabs hold of something belonging to the chamber-maid. The last line is: \"when I stretch'd out my hand I caught hold of the fille de chambre's...End of vol II\". The sentence is open to interpretation. You can say the last word is omitted, or that he stretched out his hand, and caught hers (this would be grammatically correct). Another interpretation is to incorporate 'End of Vol. II' into the sentence, so that he grabs the Fille de Chambre's 'End'.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, A Sentimental Journey through France and\nItaly, by Laurence Sterne, Edited by Henry Morley\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most\nother parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions\nwhatsoever.

Sire, it is not well done; and much does it grieve me,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099tis the monarch of a people so civilized and courteous, and so renowned\nfor sentiment and fine feelings, that I have to reason with!\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nBut I have scarce set a foot in your dominions.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\n\n\nCALAIS.\n\n\nWhen I had fished my dinner, and drank the King of France\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health, to\nsatisfy my mind that I bore him no spleen, but, on the contrary, high\nhonour for the humanity of his temper,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I rose up an inch taller for the\naccommodation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094No\u00e2\u0080\u0094said I\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Bourbon is by no means a cruel race: they may be misled,\nlike other people; but there is a mildness in their blood.  As I\nacknowledged this, I felt a suffusion of a finer kind upon my cheek\u00e2\u0080\u0094more\nwarm and friendly to man, than what Burgundy (at least of two livres a\nbottle, which was such as I had been drinking) could have produced.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094Just God! said I, kicking my portmanteau aside, what is there in this\nworld\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goods which should sharpen our spirits, and make so many\nkind-hearted brethren of us fall out so cruelly as we do by the way?\n\nWhen man is at peace with man, how much lighter than a feather is the\nheaviest of metals in his hand! he pulls out his purse, and holding it\nairily and uncompressed, looks round him, as if he sought for an object\nto share it with.\u00e2\u0080\u0094In doing this, I felt every vessel in my frame\ndilate,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the arteries beat all cheerily together, and every power which\nsustained life, performed it with so little friction, that \u00e2\u0080\u0099twould have\nconfounded the most _physical pr\u00c3\u00a9cieuse_ in France; with all her\nmaterialism, she could scarce have called me a machine.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m confident, said I to myself, I should have overset her creed.\n\nThe accession of that idea carried nature, at that time, as high as she\ncould go;\u00e2\u0080\u0094I was at peace with the world before, and this finish\u00e2\u0080\u0099d the\ntreaty with myself.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094Now, was I King of France, cried I\u00e2\u0080\u0094what a moment for an orphan to have\nbegg\u00e2\u0080\u0099d his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s portmanteau of me!\n\n\n\n\nTHE MONK.\nCALAIS.\n\n\nI HAD scarce uttered the words, when a poor monk of the order of St.\nFrancis came into the room to beg something for his convent.  No man\ncares to have his virtues the sport of contingencies\u00e2\u0080\u0094or one man may be\ngenerous, as another is puissant;\u00e2\u0080\u0094_sed non quoad hanc_\u00e2\u0080\u0094or be it as it\nmay,\u00e2\u0080\u0094for there is no regular reasoning upon the ebbs and flows of our\nhumours; they may depend upon the same causes, for aught I know, which\ninfluence the tides themselves: \u00e2\u0080\u0099twould oft be no discredit to us, to\nsuppose it was so: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure at least for myself, that in many a case I\nshould be more highly satisfied, to have it said by the world, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had had\nan affair with the moon, in which there was neither sin nor shame,\u00e2\u0080\u009d than\nhave it pass altogether as my own act and deed, wherein there was so much\nof both.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094But, be this as it may,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the moment I cast my eyes upon him, I was\npredetermined not to give him a single sous; and, accordingly, I put my\npurse into my pocket\u00e2\u0080\u0094buttoned it\u00e2\u0080\u0094set myself a little more upon my centre,\nand advanced up gravely to him; there was something, I fear, forbidding\nin my look: I have his figure this moment before my eyes, and think there\nwas that in it which deserved better.\n\nThe monk, as I judged by the break in his tonsure, a few scattered white\nhairs upon his temples, being all that remained of it, might be about\nseventy;\u00e2\u0080\u0094but from his eyes, and that sort of fire which was in them,\nwhich seemed more temper\u00e2\u0080\u0099d by courtesy than years, could be no more than\nsixty:\u00e2\u0080\u0094Truth might lie between\u00e2\u0080\u0094He was certainly sixty-five; and the\ngeneral air of his countenance, notwithstanding something seem\u00e2\u0080\u0099d to have\nbeen planting-wrinkles in it before their time, agreed to the account.\n\nIt was one of those heads which Guido has often painted,\u00e2\u0080\u0094mild,\npale\u00e2\u0080\u0094penetrating, free from all commonplace ideas of fat contented\nignorance looking downwards upon the earth;\u00e2\u0080\u0094it look\u00e2\u0080\u0099d forwards; but\nlook\u00e2\u0080\u0099d as if it look\u00e2\u0080\u0099d at something beyond this world.\u00e2\u0080\u0094How one of his\norder came by it, heaven above, who let it fall upon a monk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulders\nbest knows: but it would have suited a Bramin, and had I met it upon the\nplains of Indostan, I had reverenced it.\n\nThe rest of his outline may be given in a few strokes; one might put it\ninto the hands of any one to design, for \u00e2\u0080\u0099twas neither elegant nor\notherwise, but as character and expression made it so: it was a thin,\nspare form, something above the common size, if it lost not the\ndistinction by a bend forward in the figure,\u00e2\u0080\u0094but it was the attitude of\nIntreaty; and, as it now stands presented to my imagination, it gained\nmore than it lost by it.\n\nWhen he had entered the room three paces, he stood still; and laying his\nleft hand upon his breast (a slender white staff with which he journey\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\nbeing in his right)\u00e2\u0080\u0094when I had got close up to him, he introduced himself\nwith the little story of the wants of his convent, and the poverty of his\norder;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and did it with so simple a grace,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and such an air of deprecation\nwas there in the whole cast of his look and figure,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I was bewitch\u00e2\u0080\u0099d not\nto have been struck with it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094A better reason was, I had predetermined not to give him a single sous.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MONK.\nCALAIS.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099TIS very true, said I, replying to a cast upwards with his eyes, with\nwhich he had concluded his address;\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099tis very true,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and heaven be their\nresource who have no other but the charity of the world, the stock of\nwhich, I fear, is no way sufficient for the many _great claims_ which are\nhourly made upon it.\n\nAs I pronounced the words _great claims_, he gave a slight glance with\nhis eye downwards upon the sleeve of his tunic:\u00e2\u0080\u0094I felt the full force of\nthe appeal\u00e2\u0080\u0094I acknowledge it, said I:\u00e2\u0080\u0094a coarse habit, and that but once in\nthree years with meagre diet,\u00e2\u0080\u0094are no great matters; and the true point of\npity is, as they can be earn\u00e2\u0080\u0099d in the world with so little industry, that\nyour order should wish to procure them by pressing upon a fund which is\nthe property of the lame, the blind, the aged and the infirm;\u00e2\u0080\u0094the captive\nwho lies down counting over and over again the days of his afflictions,\nlanguishes also for his share of it; and had you been of the _order of\nmercy_, instead of the order of St. Francis, poor as I am, continued I,\npointing at my portmanteau, full cheerfully should it have been open\u00e2\u0080\u0099d to\nyou, for the ransom of the unfortunate.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The monk made me a bow.\u00e2\u0080\u0094But of\nall others, resumed I, the unfortunate of our own country, surely, have\nthe first rights; and I have left thousands in distress upon our own\nshore.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The monk gave a cordial wave with his head,\u00e2\u0080\u0094as much as to say, No\ndoubt there is misery enough in every corner of the world, as well as\nwithin our convent\u00e2\u0080\u0094But we distinguish, said I, laying my hand upon the\nsleeve of his tunic, in return for his appeal\u00e2\u0080\u0094we distinguish, my good\nfather! betwixt those who wish only to eat the bread of their own\nlabour\u00e2\u0080\u0094and those who eat the bread of other people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and have no other\nplan in life, but to get through it in sloth and ignorance, _for the love\nof God_.\n\nThe poor Franciscan made no reply: a hectic of a moment pass\u00e2\u0080\u0099d across his\ncheek, but could not tarry\u00e2\u0080\u0094Nature seemed to have done with her\nresentments in him;\u00e2\u0080\u0094he showed none:\u00e2\u0080\u0094but letting his staff fall within his\narms, he pressed both his hands with resignation upon his breast, and\nretired.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MONK.\nCALAIS.\n\n\nMY heart smote me the moment he shut the door\u00e2\u0080\u0094Psha! said I, with an air\nof carelessness, three several times\u00e2\u0080\u0094but it would not do: every\nungracious syllable I had utter\u00e2\u0080\u0099d crowded back into my imagination: I\nreflected, I had no right over the poor Franciscan, but to deny him; and\nthat the punishment of that was enough to the disappointed, without the\naddition of unkind language.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I consider\u00e2\u0080\u0099d his gray hairs\u00e2\u0080\u0094his courteous\nfigure seem\u00e2\u0080\u0099d to re-enter and gently ask me what injury he had done\nme?\u00e2\u0080\u0094and why I could use him thus?\u00e2\u0080\u0094I would have given twenty livres for an\nadvocate.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I have behaved very ill, said I within myself; but I have only\njust set out upon my travels; and shall learn better manners as I get\nalong.\n\n\n\n\nTHE DESOBLIGEANT.\nCALAIS.\n\n\nWHEN a man is discontented with himself, it has one advantage however,\nthat it puts him into an excellent frame of mind for making a bargain.\nNow there being no travelling through France and Italy without a\nchaise,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and nature generally prompting us to the thing we are fittest\nfor, I walk\u00e2\u0080\u0099d out into the coach-yard to buy or hire something of that\nkind to my purpose: an old _d\u00c3\u00a9sobligeant_ {562} in the furthest corner of\nthe court, hit my fancy at first sight, so I instantly got into it, and\nfinding it in tolerable harmony with my feelings, I ordered the waiter to\ncall Monsieur Dessein, the master of the hotel:\u00e2\u0080\u0094but Monsieur Dessein\nbeing gone to vespers, and not caring to face the Franciscan, whom I saw\non the opposite side of the court, in conference with a lady just arrived\nat the inn,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I drew the taffeta curtain betwixt us, and being determined\nto write my journey, I took out my pen and ink and wrote the preface to\nit in the _d\u00c3\u00a9sobligeant_.\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE.\nIN THE DESOBLIGEANT.\n\n\nIT must have been observed by many a peripatetic philosopher, That nature\nhas set up by her own unquestionable authority certain boundaries and\nfences to circumscribe the discontent of man; she has effected her\npurpose in the quietest and easiest manner by laying him under almost\ninsuperable obligations to work out his ease, and to sustain his\nsufferings at home.  It is there only that she has provided him with the\nmost suitable objects to partake of his happiness, and bear a part of\nthat burden which in all countries and ages has ever been too heavy for\none pair of shoulders.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis true, we are endued with an imperfect power\nof spreading our happiness sometimes beyond _her_ limits, but \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis so\nordered, that, from the want of languages, connections, and dependencies,\nand from the difference in education, customs, and habits, we lie under\nso many impediments in communicating our sensations out of our own\nsphere, as often amount to a total impossibility.\n\nIt will always follow from hence, that the balance of sentimental\ncommerce is always against the expatriated adventurer: he must buy what\nhe has little occasion for, at their own price;\u00e2\u0080\u0094his conversation will\nseldom be taken in exchange for theirs without a large discount,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and\nthis, by the by, eternally driving him into the hands of more equitable\nbrokers, for such conversation as he can find, it requires no great\nspirit of divination to guess at his party\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nThis brings me to my point; and naturally leads me (if the see-saw of\nthis _d\u00c3\u00a9sobligeant_ will but let me get on) into the efficient as well as\nfinal causes of travelling\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nYour idle people that leave their native country, and go abroad for some\nreason or reasons which may be derived from one of these general causes:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n  Infirmity of body,\n  Imbecility of mind, or\n  Inevitable necessity.\n\nThe first two include all those who travel by land or by water, labouring\nwith pride, curiosity, vanity, or spleen, subdivided and combined _ad\ninfinitum_.\n\nThe third class includes the whole army of peregrine martyrs; more\nespecially those travellers who set out upon their travels with the\nbenefit of the clergy, either as delinquents travelling under the\ndirection of governors recommended by the magistrate;\u00e2\u0080\u0094or young gentlemen\ntransported by the cruelty of parents and guardians, and travelling under\nthe direction of governors recommended by Oxford, Aberdeen, and Glasgow.\n\nThere is a fourth class, but their number is so small that they would not\ndeserve a distinction, were it not necessary in a work of this nature to\nobserve the greatest precision and nicety, to avoid a confusion of\ncharacter.  And these men I speak of, are such as cross the seas and\nsojourn in a land of strangers, with a view of saving money for various\nreasons and upon various pretences: but as they might also save\nthemselves and others a great deal of unnecessary trouble by saving their\nmoney at home,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and as their reasons for travelling are the least complex\nof any other species of emigrants, I shall distinguish these gentlemen by\nthe name of\n\n                            Simple Travellers.\n\nThus the whole circle of travellers may be reduced to the following\n_heads_:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n  Idle Travellers,\n\n  Inquisitive Travellers,\n\n  Lying Travellers,\n\n  Proud Travellers,\n\n  Vain Travellers,\n\n  Splenetic Travellers.\n\nThen follow:\n\n  The Travellers of Necessity,\n\n  The Delinquent and Felonious Traveller,\n\n  The Unfortunate and Innocent Traveller,\n\n  The Simple Traveller,\n\nAnd last of all (if you please) The Sentimental Traveller, (meaning\nthereby myself) who have travell\u00e2\u0080\u0099d, and of which I am now sitting down to\ngive an account,\u00e2\u0080\u0094as much out of _Necessity_, and the _besoin de Voyager_,\nas any one in the class.\n\nI am well aware, at the same time, as both my travels and observations\nwill be altogether of a different cast from any of my forerunners, that I\nmight have insisted upon a whole nitch entirely to myself;\u00e2\u0080\u0094but I should\nbreak in upon the confines of the _Vain_ Traveller, in wishing to draw\nattention towards me, till I have some better grounds for it than the\nmere _Novelty of my Vehicle_.\n\nIt is sufficient for my reader, if he has been a traveller himself, that\nwith study and reflection hereupon he may be able to determine his own\nplace and rank in the catalogue;\u00e2\u0080\u0094it will be one step towards knowing\nhimself; as it is great odds but he retains some tincture and\nresemblance, of what he imbibed or carried out, to the present hour.\n\nThe man who first transplanted the grape of Burgundy to the Cape of Good\nHope (observe he was a Dutchman) never dreamt of drinking the same wine\nat the Cape, that the same grape produced upon the French mountains,\u00e2\u0080\u0094he\nwas too phlegmatic for that\u00e2\u0080\u0094but undoubtedly he expected to drink some\nsort of vinous liquor; but whether good or bad, or indifferent,\u00e2\u0080\u0094he knew\nenough of this world to know, that it did not depend upon his choice, but\nthat what is generally called _choice_, was to decide his success:\nhowever, he hoped for the best; and in these hopes, by an intemperate\nconfidence in the fortitude of his head, and the depth of his discretion,\n_Mynheer_ might possibly oversee both in his new vineyard; and by\ndiscovering his nakedness, become a laughing stock to his people.\n\nEven so it fares with the Poor Traveller, sailing and posting through the\npoliter kingdoms of the globe, in pursuit of knowledge and improvements.\n\nKnowledge and improvements are to be got by sailing and posting for that\npurpose; but whether useful knowledge and real improvements is all a\nlottery;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and even where the adventurer is successful, the acquired stock\nmust be used with caution and sobriety, to turn to any profit:\u00e2\u0080\u0094but, as\nthe chances run prodigiously the other way, both as to the acquisition\nand application, I am of opinion, That a man would act as wisely, if he\ncould prevail upon himself to live contented without foreign knowledge or\nforeign improvements, especially if he lives in a country that has no\nabsolute want of either;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and indeed, much grief of heart has it oft and\nmany a time cost me, when I have observed how many a foul step the\nInquisitive Traveller has measured to see sights and look into\ndiscoveries; all which, as Sancho Panza said to Don Quixote, they might\nhave seen dry-shod at home.  It is an age so full of light, that there is\nscarce a country or corner in Europe whose beams are not crossed and\ninterchanged with others.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Knowledge in most of its branches, and in most\naffairs, is like music in an Italian street, whereof those may partake\nwho pay nothing.\u00e2\u0080\u0094But there is no nation under heaven\u00e2\u0080\u0094and God is my record\n(before whose tribunal I must one day come and give an account of this\nwork)\u00e2\u0080\u0094that I do not speak it vauntingly,\u00e2\u0080\u0094but there is no nation under\nheaven abounding with more variety of learning,\u00e2\u0080\u0094where the sciences may be\nmore fitly woo\u00e2\u0080\u0099d, or more surely won, than here,\u00e2\u0080\u0094where art is encouraged,\nand will so soon rise high,\u00e2\u0080\u0094where Nature (take her altogether) has so\nlittle to answer for,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, to close all, where there is more wit and\nvariety of character to feed the mind with:\u00e2\u0080\u0094Where then, my dear\ncountrymen, are you going?\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nWe are only looking at this chaise, said they.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Your most obedient\nservant, said I, skipping out of it, and pulling off my hat.\u00e2\u0080\u0094We were\nwondering, said one of them, who, I found was an _Inquisitive\nTraveller_,\u00e2\u0080\u0094what could occasion its motion.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099Twas the agitation, said I,\ncoolly, of writing a preface.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I never heard, said the other, who was a\n_Simple Traveller_, of a preface wrote in a _d\u00c3\u00a9sobligeant_.\u00e2\u0080\u0094It would have\nbeen better, said I, in a _vis-a-vis_.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094_As an Englishman does not travel to see Englishmen_, I retired to my\nroom.\n\n\n\n\nCALAIS.\n\n\nI PERCEIVED that something darken\u00e2\u0080\u0099d the passage more than myself, as I\nstepp\u00e2\u0080\u0099d along it to my room; it was effectually Mons. Dessein, the master\nof the h\u00c3\u00b4tel, who had just returned from vespers, and with his hat under\nhis arm, was most complaisantly following me, to put me in mind of my\nwants.  I had wrote myself pretty well out of conceit with the\n_d\u00c3\u00a9sobligeant_, and Mons. Dessein speaking of it, with a shrug, as if it\nwould no way suit me, it immediately struck my fancy that it belong\u00e2\u0080\u0099d to\nsome _Innocent Traveller_, who, on his return home, had left it to Mons.\nDessein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s honour to make the most of.  Four months had elapsed since it\nhad finished its career of Europe in the corner of Mons. Dessein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncoach-yard; and having sallied out from thence but a vampt-up business at\nthe first, though it had been twice taken to pieces on Mount Sennis, it\nhad not profited much by its adventures,\u00e2\u0080\u0094but by none so little as the\nstanding so many months unpitied in the corner of Mons. Dessein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncoach-yard.  Much indeed was not to be said for it,\u00e2\u0080\u0094but something\nmight;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and when a few words will rescue misery out of her distress, I\nhate the man who can be a churl of them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094Now was I the master of this h\u00c3\u00b4tel, said I, laying the point of my\nfore-finger on Mons. Dessein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breast, I would inevitably make a point of\ngetting rid of this unfortunate _d\u00c3\u00a9sobligeant_;\u00e2\u0080\u0094it stands swinging\nreproaches at you every time you pass by it.\n\n_Mon Dieu_! said Mons. Dessein,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I have no interest\u00e2\u0080\u0094Except the interest,\nsaid I, which men of a certain turn of mind take, Mons. Dessein, in their\nown sensations,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m persuaded, to a man who feels for others as well as\nfor himself, every rainy night, disguise it as you will, must cast a damp\nupon your spirits:\u00e2\u0080\u0094You suffer, Mons. Dessein, as much as the machine\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nI have always observed, when there is as much _sour_ as _sweet_ in a\ncompliment, that an Englishman is eternally at a loss within himself,\nwhether to take it, or let it alone: a Frenchman never is: Mons. Dessein\nmade me a bow.\n\n_C\u00e2\u0080\u0099est bien vrai_, said he.\u00e2\u0080\u0094But in this case I should only exchange one\ndisquietude for another, and with loss: figure to yourself, my dear Sir,\nthat in giving you a chaise which would fall to pieces before you had got\nhalf-way to Paris,\u00e2\u0080\u0094figure to yourself how much I should suffer, in giving\nan ill impression of myself to a man of honour, and lying at the mercy,\nas I must do, _d\u00e2\u0080\u0099un homme d\u00e2\u0080\u0099esprit_.\n\nThe dose was made up exactly after my own prescription; so I could not\nhelp tasting it,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, returning Mons. Dessein his bow, without more\ncasuistry we walk\u00e2\u0080\u0099d together towards his Remise, to take a view of his\nmagazine of chaises.\n\n\n\n\nIN THE STREET.\nCALAIS.\n\n\nIT must needs be a hostile kind of a world, when the buyer (if it be but\nof a sorry post-chaise) cannot go forth with the seller thereof into the\nstreet to terminate the difference betwixt them, but he instantly falls\ninto the same frame of mind, and views his conventionist with the same\nsort of eye, as if he was going along with him to Hyde-park corner to\nfight a duel.  For my own part, being but a poor swordsman, and no way a\nmatch for Monsieur Dessein, I felt the rotation of all the movements\nwithin me, to which the situation is incident;\u00e2\u0080\u0094I looked at Monsieur\nDessein through and through\u00e2\u0080\u0094eyed him as he walk\u00e2\u0080\u0099d along in profile,\u00e2\u0080\u0094then,\n_en face_;\u00e2\u0080\u0094thought like a Jew,\u00e2\u0080\u0094then a Turk,\u00e2\u0080\u0094disliked his wig,\u00e2\u0080\u0094cursed him\nby my gods,\u00e2\u0080\u0094wished him at the devil.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094And is all this to be lighted up in the heart for a beggarly account of\nthree or four louis d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ors, which is the most I can be overreached\nin?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Base passion! said I, turning myself about, as a man naturally does\nupon a sudden reverse of sentiment,\u00e2\u0080\u0094base, ungentle passion! thy hand is\nagainst every man, and every man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand against thee.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Heaven forbid! said\nshe, raising her hand up to her forehead, for I had turned full in front\nupon the lady whom I had seen in conference with the monk:\u00e2\u0080\u0094she had\nfollowed us unperceived.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Heaven forbid, indeed! said I, offering her my\nown;\u00e2\u0080\u0094she had a black pair of silk gloves, open only at the thumb and two\nfore-fingers, so accepted it without reserve,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I led her up to the\ndoor of the Remise.\n\nMonsieur Dessein had _diabled_ the key above fifty times before he had\nfound out he had come with a wrong one in his hand: we were as impatient\nas himself to have it opened; and so attentive to the obstacle that I\ncontinued holding her hand almost without knowing it: so that Monsieur\nDessein left us together with her hand in mine, and with our faces turned\ntowards the door of the Remise, and said he would be back in five\nminutes.\n\nNow a colloquy of five minutes, in such a situation, is worth one of as\nmany ages, with your faces turned towards the street: in the latter case,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099tis drawn from the objects and occurrences without;\u00e2\u0080\u0094when your eyes are\nfixed upon a dead blank,\u00e2\u0080\u0094you draw purely from yourselves.  A silence of a\nsingle moment upon Mons. Dessein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leaving us, had been fatal to the\nsituation\u00e2\u0080\u0094she had infallibly turned about;\u00e2\u0080\u0094so I begun the conversation\ninstantly.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094But what were the temptations (as I write not to apologize for the\nweaknesses of my heart in this tour,\u00e2\u0080\u0094but to give an account of\nthem)\u00e2\u0080\u0094shall be described with the same simplicity with which I felt them.\n\n\n\n\nTHE REMISE DOOR.\nCALAIS.\n\n\nWHEN I told the reader that I did not care to get out of the\n_d\u00c3\u00a9sobligeant_, because I saw the monk in close conference with a lady\njust arrived at the inn\u00e2\u0080\u0094I told him the truth,\u00e2\u0080\u0094but I did not tell him the\nwhole truth; for I was as full as much restrained by the appearance and\nfigure of the lady he was talking to.  Suspicion crossed my brain and\nsaid, he was telling her what had passed: something jarred upon it within\nme,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I wished him at his convent.\n\nWhen the heart flies out before the understanding, it saves the judgment\na world of pains.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I was certain she was of a better order of\nbeings;\u00e2\u0080\u0094however, I thought no more of her, but went on and wrote my\npreface.\n\nThe impression returned upon my encounter with her in the street; a\nguarded frankness with which she gave me her hand, showed, I thought, her\ngood education and her good sense; and as I led her on, I felt a\npleasurable ductility about her, which spread a calmness over all my\nspirits\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094Good God! how a man might lead such a creature as this round the world\nwith him!\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nI had not yet seen her face\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099twas not material: for the drawing was\ninstantly set about, and long before we had got to the door of the\nRemise, _Fancy_ had finished the whole head, and pleased herself as much\nwith its fitting her goddess, as if she had dived into the Tiber for\nit;\u00e2\u0080\u0094but thou art a seduced, and a seducing slut; and albeit thou cheatest\nus seven times a day with thy pictures and images, yet with so many\ncharms dost thou do it, and thou deckest out thy pictures in the shapes\nof so many angels of light, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis a shame to break with thee.\n\nWhen we had got to the door of the Remise, she withdrew her hand from\nacross her forehead, and let me see the original:\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was a face of about\nsix-and-twenty,\u00e2\u0080\u0094of a clear transparent brown, simply set off without\nrouge or powder;\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was not critically handsome, but there was that in\nit, which, in the frame of mind I was in, attached me much more to it,\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\nwas interesting: I fancied it wore the characters of a widow\u00e2\u0080\u0099d look, and\nin that state of its declension, which had passed the two first paroxysms\nof sorrow, and was quietly beginning to reconcile itself to its loss;\u00e2\u0080\u0094but\na thousand other distresses might have traced the same lines; I wish\u00e2\u0080\u0099d to\nknow what they had been\u00e2\u0080\u0094and was ready to inquire, (had the same _bon ton_\nof conversation permitted, as in the days of Esdras)\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009c_What ailelh thee_?\n_and why art thou disquieted_? _and why is thy understanding\ntroubled_?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094In a word, I felt benevolence for her; and resolv\u00e2\u0080\u0099d some way\nor other to throw in my mite of courtesy,\u00e2\u0080\u0094if not of service.\n\nSuch were my temptations;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and in this disposition to give way to them,\nwas I left alone with the lady with her hand in mine, and with our faces\nboth turned closer to the door of the Remise than what was absolutely\nnecessary.\n\n\n\n\nTHE REMISE DOOR.\nCALAIS.\n\n\nTHIS certainly, fair lady, said I, raising her hand up little lightly as\nI began, must be one of Fortune\u00e2\u0080\u0099s whimsical doings; to take two utter\nstrangers by their hands,\u00e2\u0080\u0094of different sexes, and perhaps from different\ncorners of the globe, and in one moment place them together in such a\ncordial situation as Friendship herself could scarce have achieved for\nthem, had she projected it for a month.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094And your reflection upon it shows how much, Monsieur, she has\nembarrassed you by the adventure\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nWhen the situation is what we would wish, nothing is so ill-timed as to\nhint at the circumstances which make it so: you thank Fortune, continued\nshe\u00e2\u0080\u0094you had reason\u00e2\u0080\u0094the heart knew it, and was satisfied; and who but an\nEnglish philosopher would have sent notice of it to the brain to reverse\nthe judgment?\n\nIn saying this, she disengaged her hand with a look which I thought a\nsufficient commentary upon the text.\n\nIt is a miserable picture which I am going to give of the weakness of my\nheart, by owning, that it suffered a pain, which worthier occasions could\nnot have inflicted.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I was mortified with the loss of her hand, and the\nmanner in which I had lost it carried neither oil nor wine to the wound:\nI never felt the pain of a sheepish inferiority so miserably in my life.\n\nThe triumphs of a true feminine heart are short upon these discomfitures.\nIn a very few seconds she laid her hand upon the cuff of my coat, in\norder to finish her reply; so, some way or other, God knows how, I\nregained my situation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094She had nothing to add.\n\nI forthwith began to model a different conversation for the lady,\nthinking from the spirit as well as moral of this, that I had been\nmistaken in her character; but upon turning her face towards me, the\nspirit which had animated the reply was fled,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the muscles relaxed, and I\nbeheld the same unprotected look of distress which first won me to her\ninterest:\u00e2\u0080\u0094melancholy! to see such sprightliness the prey of sorrow,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\npitied her from my soul; and though it may seem ridiculous enough to a\ntorpid heart,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I could have taken her into my arms, and cherished her,\nthough it was in the open street, without brushing.\n\nThe pulsations of the arteries along my fingers pressing across hers,\ntold her what was passing within me: she looked down\u00e2\u0080\u0094a silence of some\nmoments followed.\n\nI fear in this interval, I must have made some slight efforts towards a\ncloser compression of her hand, from a subtle sensation I felt in the\npalm of my own,\u00e2\u0080\u0094not as if she was going to withdraw hers\u00e2\u0080\u0094but as if she\nthought about it;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I had infallibly lost it a second time, had not\ninstinct more than reason directed me to the last resource in these\ndangers,\u00e2\u0080\u0094to hold it loosely, and in a manner as if I was every moment\ngoing to release it, of myself; so she let it continue, till Monsieur\nDessein returned with the key; and in the mean time I set myself to\nconsider how I should undo the ill impressions which the poor monk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nstory, in case he had told it her, must have planted in her breast\nagainst me.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SNUFF BOX.\nCALAIS.\n\n\nTHE good old monk was within six paces of us, as the idea of him crossed\nmy mind; and was advancing towards us a little out of the line, as if\nuncertain whether he should break in upon us or no.\u00e2\u0080\u0094He stopp\u00e2\u0080\u0099d, however,\nas soon as he came up to us, with a world of frankness: and having a horn\nsnuff box in his hand, he presented it open to me.\u00e2\u0080\u0094You shall taste\nmine\u00e2\u0080\u0094said I, pulling out my box (which was a small tortoise one) and\nputting it into his hand.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis most excellent, said the monk.  Then do me\nthe favour, I replied, to accept of the box and all, and when you take a\npinch out of it, sometimes recollect it was the peace offering of a man\nwho once used you unkindly, but not from his heart.\n\nThe poor monk blush\u00e2\u0080\u0099d as red as scarlet.  _Mon Dieu_! said he, pressing\nhis hands together\u00e2\u0080\u0094you never used me unkindly.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I should think, said the\nlady, he is not likely.  I blush\u00e2\u0080\u0099d in my turn; but from what movements, I\nleave to the few who feel, to analyze.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Excuse me, Madame, replied I,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\ntreated him most unkindly; and from no provocations.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis impossible,\nsaid the lady.\u00e2\u0080\u0094My God! cried the monk, with a warmth of asseveration\nwhich seem\u00e2\u0080\u0099d not to belong to him\u00e2\u0080\u0094the fault was in me, and in the\nindiscretion of my zeal.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The lady opposed it, and I joined with her in\nmaintaining it was impossible, that a spirit so regulated as his, could\ngive offence to any.\n\nI knew not that contention could be rendered so sweet and pleasurable a\nthing to the nerves as I then felt it.\u00e2\u0080\u0094We remained silent, without any\nsensation of that foolish pain which takes place, when, in such a circle,\nyou look for ten minutes in one another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s faces without saying a word.\nWhilst this lasted, the monk rubbed his horn box upon the sleeve of his\ntunic; and as soon as it had acquired a little air of brightness by the\nfriction\u00e2\u0080\u0094he made me a low bow, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u0099twas too late to say whether it\nwas the weakness or goodness of our tempers which had involved us in this\ncontest\u00e2\u0080\u0094but be it as it would,\u00e2\u0080\u0094he begg\u00e2\u0080\u0099d we might exchange boxes.\u00e2\u0080\u0094In\nsaying this, he presented his to me with one hand, as he took mine from\nme in the other, and having kissed it,\u00e2\u0080\u0094with a stream of good nature in\nhis eyes, he put it into his bosom,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and took his leave.\n\nI guard this box, as I would the instrumental parts of my religion, to\nhelp my mind on to something better: in truth, I seldom go abroad without\nit; and oft and many a time have I called up by it the courteous spirit\nof its owner to regulate my own, in the justlings of the world: they had\nfound full employment for his, as I learnt from his story, till about the\nforty-fifth year of his age, when upon some military services ill\nrequited, and meeting at the same time with a disappointment in the\ntenderest of passions, he abandoned the sword and the sex together, and\ntook sanctuary not so much in his convent as in himself.\n\nI feel a damp upon my spirits, as I am going to add, that in my last\nreturn through Calais, upon enquiring after Father Lorenzo, I heard he\nhad been dead near three months, and was buried, not in his convent, but,\naccording to his desire, in a little cemetery belonging to it, about two\nleagues off: I had a strong desire to see where they had laid him,\u00e2\u0080\u0094when,\nupon pulling out his little horn box, as I sat by his grave, and plucking\nup a nettle or two at the head of it, which had no business to grow\nthere, they all struck together so forcibly upon my affections, that I\nburst into a flood of tears:\u00e2\u0080\u0094but I am as weak as a woman; and I beg the\nworld not to smile, but to pity me.\n\n\n\n\nTHE REMISE DOOR.\nCALAIS.\n\n\nI HAD never quitted the lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand all this time, and had held it so\nlong, that it would have been indecent to have let it go, without first\npressing it to my lips: the blood and spirits, which had suffered a\nrevulsion from her, crowded back to her as I did it.\n\nNow the two travellers, who had spoke to me in the coach-yard, happening\nat that crisis to be passing by, and observing our communications,\nnaturally took it into their heads that we must be _man and wife_ at\nleast; so, stopping as soon as they came up to the door of the Remise,\nthe one of them who was the Inquisitive Traveller, ask\u00e2\u0080\u0099d us, if we set\nout for Paris the next morning?\u00e2\u0080\u0094I could only answer for myself, I said;\nand the lady added, she was for Amiens.\u00e2\u0080\u0094We dined there yesterday, said\nthe Simple Traveller.\u00e2\u0080\u0094You go directly through the town, added the other,\nin your road to Paris.  I was going to return a thousand thanks for the\nintelligence, _that Amiens was in the road to Paris_, but, upon pulling\nout my poor monk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little horn box to take a pinch of snuff, I made them\na quiet bow, and wishing them a good passage to Dover.\u00e2\u0080\u0094They left us\nalone.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094Now where would be the harm, said I to myself, if I were to beg of this\ndistressed lady to accept of half of my chaise?\u00e2\u0080\u0094and what mighty mischief\ncould ensue?\n\nEvery dirty passion, and bad propensity in my nature took the alarm, as I\nstated the proposition.\u00e2\u0080\u0094It will oblige you to have a third horse, said\nAvarice, which will put twenty livres out of your pocket;\u00e2\u0080\u0094You know not\nwhat she is, said Caution;\u00e2\u0080\u0094or what scrapes the affair may draw you into,\nwhisper\u00e2\u0080\u0099d Cowardice.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nDepend upon it, Yorick! said Discretion, \u00e2\u0080\u0099twill be said you went off with\na mistress, and came by assignation to Calais for that purpose;\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094You can never after, cried Hypocrisy aloud, show your face in the\nworld;\u00e2\u0080\u0094or rise, quoth Meanness, in the church;\u00e2\u0080\u0094or be any thing in it,\nsaid Pride, but a lousy prebendary.\n\nBut \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis a civil thing, said I;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and as I generally act from the first\nimpulse, and therefore seldom listen to these cabals, which serve no\npurpose, that I know of, but to encompass the heart with adamant\u00e2\u0080\u0094I turned\ninstantly about to the lady.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094But she had glided off unperceived, as the cause was pleading, and had\nmade ten or a dozen paces down the street, by the time I had made the\ndetermination; so I set off after her with a long stride, to make her the\nproposal, with the best address I was master of: but observing she walk\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\nwith her cheek half resting upon the palm of her hand,\u00e2\u0080\u0094with the slow\nshort-measur\u00e2\u0080\u0099d step of thoughtfulness,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and with her eyes, as she went\nstep by step, fixed upon the ground, it struck me she was trying the same\ncause herself.\u00e2\u0080\u0094God help her! said I, she has some mother-in-law, or\ntartufish aunt, or nonsensical old woman, to consult upon the occasion,\nas well as myself: so not caring to interrupt the process, and deeming it\nmore gallant to take her at discretion than by surprise, I faced about\nand took a short turn or two before the door of the Remise, whilst she\nwalk\u00e2\u0080\u0099d musing on one side.\n\n\n\n\nIN THE STREET.\nCALAIS.\n\n\nHAVING, on the first sight of the lady, settled the affair in my fancy\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat she was of the better order of beings;\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094and then laid it down as a\nsecond axiom, as indisputable as the first, that she was a widow, and\nwore a character of distress,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I went no further; I got ground enough for\nthe situation which pleased me;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and had she remained close beside my\nelbow till midnight, I should have held true to my system, and considered\nher only under that general idea.\n\nShe had scarce got twenty paces distant from me, ere something within me\ncalled out for a more particular enquiry;\u00e2\u0080\u0094it brought on the idea of a\nfurther separation:\u00e2\u0080\u0094I might possibly never see her more:\u00e2\u0080\u0094The heart is for\nsaving what it can; and I wanted the traces through which my wishes might\nfind their way to her, in case I should never rejoin her myself; in a\nword, I wished to know her name,\u00e2\u0080\u0094her family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u0094her condition; and as I\nknew the place to which she was going, I wanted to know from whence she\ncame: but there was no coming at all this intelligence; a hundred little\ndelicacies stood in the way.  I form\u00e2\u0080\u0099d a score different plans.\u00e2\u0080\u0094There was\nno such thing as a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s asking her directly;\u00e2\u0080\u0094the thing was impossible.\n\nA little French _d\u00c3\u00a9bonnaire_ captain, who came dancing down the street,\nshowed me it was the easiest thing in the world: for, popping in betwixt\nus, just as the lady was returning back to the door of the Remise, he\nintroduced himself to my acquaintance, and before he had well got\nannounced, begg\u00e2\u0080\u0099d I would do him the honour to present him to the lady.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\nhad not been presented myself;\u00e2\u0080\u0094so turning about to her, he did it just as\nwell, by asking her if she had come from Paris?  No: she was going that\nroute, she said.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Vous n\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c3\u00aates pas de Londres_?\u00e2\u0080\u0094She was not, she\nreplied.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Then Madame must have come through Flanders.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Apparemment vous\n\u00c3\u00aates Flammande_? said the French captain.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The lady answered, she\nwas.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Peut \u00c3\u00aatre de Lisle_? added he.\u00e2\u0080\u0094She said, she was not of Lisle.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Nor\nArras?\u00e2\u0080\u0094nor Cambray?\u00e2\u0080\u0094nor Ghent?\u00e2\u0080\u0094nor Brussels?\u00e2\u0080\u0094She answered, she was of\nBrussels.\n\nHe had had the honour, he said, to be at the bombardment of it last\nwar;\u00e2\u0080\u0094that it was finely situated, _pour cela_,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and full of noblesse when\nthe Imperialists were driven out by the French (the lady made a slight\ncourtesy)\u00e2\u0080\u0094so giving her an account of the affair, and of the share he had\nhad in it,\u00e2\u0080\u0094he begg\u00e2\u0080\u0099d the honour to know her name,\u00e2\u0080\u0094so made his bow.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Et Madame a son Mari_?\u00e2\u0080\u0094said he, looking back when he had made two\nsteps,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, without staying for an answer\u00e2\u0080\u0094danced down the street.\n\nHad I served seven years apprenticeship to good breeding, I could not\nhave done as much.\n\n\n\n\nTHE REMISE.\nCALAIS.\n\n\nAs the little French captain left us, Mons. Dessein came up with the key\nof the Remise in his hand, and forthwith let us into his magazine of\nchaises.\n\nThe first object which caught my eye, as Mons. Dessein open\u00e2\u0080\u0099d the door of\nthe Remise, was another old tatter\u00e2\u0080\u0099d _d\u00c3\u00a9sobligeant_; and notwithstanding\nit was the exact picture of that which had hit my fancy so much in the\ncoach-yard but an hour before,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the very sight of it stirr\u00e2\u0080\u0099d up a\ndisagreeable sensation within me now; and I thought \u00e2\u0080\u0099twas a churlish\nbeast into whose heart the idea could first enter, to construct such a\nmachine; nor had I much more charity for the man who could think of using\nit.\n\nI observed the lady was as little taken with it as myself: so Mons.\nDessein led us on to a couple of chaises which stood abreast, telling us,\nas he recommended them, that they had been purchased by my lord A. and B.\nto go the grand tour, but had gone no further than Paris, so were in all\nrespects as good as new.\u00e2\u0080\u0094They were too good;\u00e2\u0080\u0094so I pass\u00e2\u0080\u0099d on to a third,\nwhich stood behind, and forthwith begun to chaffer for the price.\u00e2\u0080\u0094But\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099twill scarce hold two, said I, opening the door and getting in.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Have the\ngoodness, Madame, said Mons.

I declare, said I, clapping my hands\ncheerily together, that were I in a desert, I would find out wherewith in\nit to call forth my affections:\u00e2\u0080\u0094if I could not do better, I would fasten\nthem upon some sweet myrtle, or seek some melancholy cypress to connect\nmyself to;\u00e2\u0080\u0094I would court their shade, and greet them kindly for their\nprotection.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I would cut my name upon them, and swear they were the\nloveliest trees throughout the desert: if their leaves wither\u00e2\u0080\u0099d, I would\nteach myself to mourn; and, when they rejoiced, I would rejoice along\nwith them.\n\nThe learned Smelfungus travelled from Boulogne to Paris,\u00e2\u0080\u0094from Paris to\nRome,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and so on;\u00e2\u0080\u0094but he set out with the spleen and jaundice, and every\nobject he pass\u00e2\u0080\u0099d by was discoloured or distorted.\u00e2\u0080\u0094He wrote an account of\nthem, but \u00e2\u0080\u0099twas nothing but the account of his miserable feelings.\n\nI met Smelfungus in the grand portico of the Pantheon:\u00e2\u0080\u0094he was just coming\nout of it.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099_Tis nothing but a huge cockpit_, {580} said he:\u00e2\u0080\u0094I wish you\nhad said nothing worse of the Venus of Medicis, replied I;\u00e2\u0080\u0094for in passing\nthrough Florence, I had heard he had fallen foul upon the goddess, and\nused her worse than a common strumpet, without the least provocation in\nnature.\n\nI popp\u00e2\u0080\u0099d upon Smelfungus again at Turin, in his return home; and a sad\ntale of sorrowful adventures had he to tell, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwherein he spoke of moving\naccidents by flood and field, and of the cannibals that each other eat:\nthe Anthropophagi:\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094he had been flayed alive, and bedevil\u00e2\u0080\u0099d, and used\nworse than St. Bartholomew, at every stage he had come at.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell it, cried Smelfungus, to the world.  You had better tell it,\nsaid I, to your physician.\n\nMundungus, with an immense fortune, made the whole tour; going on from\nRome to Naples,\u00e2\u0080\u0094from Naples to Venice,\u00e2\u0080\u0094from Venice to Vienna,\u00e2\u0080\u0094to Dresden,\nto Berlin, without one generous connection or pleasurable anecdote to\ntell of; but he had travell\u00e2\u0080\u0099d straight on, looking neither to his right\nhand nor his left, lest Love or Pity should seduce him out of his road.\n\nPeace be to them! if it is to be found; but heaven itself, were it\npossible to get there with such tempers, would want objects to give it;\nevery gentle spirit would come flying upon the wings of Love to hail\ntheir arrival.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Nothing would the souls of Smelfungus and Mundungus hear\nof, but fresh anthems of joy, fresh raptures of love, and fresh\ncongratulations of their common felicity.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I heartily pity them; they have\nbrought up no faculties for this work; and, were the happiest mansion in\nheaven to be allotted to Smelfungus and Mundungus, they would be so far\nfrom being happy, that the souls of Smelfungus and Mundungus would do\npenance there to all eternity!\n\n\n\n\nMONTREUIL.\n\n\nI HAD once lost my portmanteau from behind my chaise, and twice got out\nin the rain, and one of the times up to the knees in dirt, to help the\npostilion to tie it on, without being able to find out what was\nwanting.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Nor was it till I got to Montreuil, upon the landlord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s asking\nme if I wanted not a servant, that it occurred to me, that that was the\nvery thing.\n\nA servant!  That I do most sadly, quoth I.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Because, Monsieur, said the\nlandlord, there is a clever young fellow, who would be very proud of the\nhonour to serve an Englishman.\u00e2\u0080\u0094But why an English one, more than any\nother?\u00e2\u0080\u0094They are so generous, said the landlord.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be shot if this is\nnot a livre out of my pocket, quoth I to myself, this very night.\u00e2\u0080\u0094But\nthey have wherewithal to be so, Monsieur, added he.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Set down one livre\nmore for that, quoth I.\u00e2\u0080\u0094It was but last night, said the landlord, _qu\u00e2\u0080\u0099un\nmilord Anglois pr\u00c3\u00a9sentoit un \u00c3\u00a9cu \u00c3\u00a0 la fille de chambre_.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Tant pis pour\nMademoiselle Janatone_, said I.\n\nNow Janatone, being the landlord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter, and the landlord supposing I\nwas young in French, took the liberty to inform me, I should not have\nsaid _tant pis_\u00e2\u0080\u0094but, _tant mieux_.  _Tant mieux_, _toujours_, _Monsieur_,\nsaid he, when there is any thing to be got\u00e2\u0080\u0094_tant pis_, when there is\nnothing.  It comes to the same thing, said I.  _Pardonnez-moi_, said the\nlandlord.\n\nI cannot take a fitter opportunity to observe, once for all, that _tant\npis_ and _tant mieux_, being two of the great hinges in French\nconversation, a stranger would do well to set himself right in the use of\nthem, before he gets to Paris.\n\nA prompt French marquis at our ambassador\u00e2\u0080\u0099s table demanded of Mr. H\u00e2\u0080\u0094, if\nhe was H\u00e2\u0080\u0094 the poet?  No, said Mr. H\u00e2\u0080\u0094, mildly.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Tant pis_, replied the\nmarquis.\n\nIt is H\u00e2\u0080\u0094 the historian, said another,\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Tant mieux_, said the marquis.\nAnd Mr. H\u00e2\u0080\u0094, who is a man of an excellent heart, return\u00e2\u0080\u0099d thanks for both.\n\nWhen the landlord had set me right in this matter, he called in La Fleur,\nwhich was the name of the young man he had spoke of,\u00e2\u0080\u0094saying only first,\nThat as for his talents he would presume to say nothing,\u00e2\u0080\u0094Monsieur was the\nbest judge what would suit him; but for the fidelity of La Fleur he would\nstand responsible in all he was worth.\n\nThe landlord deliver\u00e2\u0080\u0099d this in a manner which instantly set my mind to\nthe business I was upon;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and La Fleur, who stood waiting without, in that\nbreathless expectation which every son of nature of us have felt in our\nturns, came in.\n\n\n\n\nMONTREUIL.\n\n\nI AM apt to be taken with all kinds of people at first sight; but never\nmore so than when a poor devil comes to offer his service to so poor a\ndevil as myself; and as I know this weakness, I always suffer my judgment\nto draw back something on that very account,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and this more or less,\naccording to the mood I am in, and the case;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I may add, the gender\ntoo, of the person I am to govern.\n\nWhen La Fleur entered the room, after every discount I could make for my\nsoul, the genuine look and air of the fellow determined the matter at\nonce in his favour; so I hired him first,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and then began to enquire what\nhe could do: But I shall find out his talents, quoth I, as I want\nthem,\u00e2\u0080\u0094besides, a Frenchman can do every thing.\n\nNow poor La Fleur could do nothing in the world but beat a drum, and play\na march or two upon the fife.  I was determined to make his talents do;\nand can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say my weakness was ever so insulted by my wisdom as in the\nattempt.\n\nLa Fleur had set out early in life, as gallantly as most Frenchmen do,\nwith _serving_ for a few years; at the end of which, having satisfied the\nsentiment, and found, moreover, That the honour of beating a drum was\nlikely to be its own reward, as it open\u00e2\u0080\u0099d no further track of glory to\nhim,\u00e2\u0080\u0094he retired _\u00c3\u00a0 ses terres_, and lived _comme il plaisoit \u00c3\u00a0\nDieu_;\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is to say, upon nothing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094And so, quoth Wisdom, you have hired a drummer to attend you in this\ntour of yours through France and Italy!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Psha! said I, and do not one half\nof our gentry go with a humdrum _compagnon du voyage_ the same round, and\nhave the piper and the devil and all to pay besides?  When man can\nextricate himself with an _\u00c3\u00a9quivoque_ in such an unequal match,\u00e2\u0080\u0094he is not\nill off.\u00e2\u0080\u0094But you can do something else, La Fleur? said I.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_O qu\u00e2\u0080\u0099oui_! he\ncould make spatterdashes, and play a little upon the fiddle.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Bravo! said\nWisdom.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Why, I play a bass myself, said I;\u00e2\u0080\u0094we shall do very well.  You\ncan shave, and dress a wig a little, La Fleur?\u00e2\u0080\u0094He had all the\ndispositions in the world.\u00e2\u0080\u0094It is enough for heaven! said I, interrupting\nhim,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and ought to be enough for me.\u00e2\u0080\u0094So, supper coming in, and having a\nfrisky English spaniel on one side of my chair, and a French valet, with\nas much hilarity in his countenance as ever Nature painted in one, on the\nother,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I was satisfied to my heart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s content with my empire; and if\nmonarchs knew what they would be at, they might be as satisfied as I was.\n\n\n\n\nMONTREUIL.\n\n\nAS La Fleur went the whole tour of France and Italy with me, and will be\noften upon the stage, I must interest the reader a little further in his\nbehalf, by saying, that I had never less reason to repent of the impulses\nwhich generally do determine me, than in regard to this fellow;\u00e2\u0080\u0094he was a\nfaithful, affectionate, simple soul as ever trudged after the heels of a\nphilosopher; and, notwithstanding his talents of drum beating and\nspatterdash-making, which, though very good in themselves, happened to be\nof no great service to me, yet was I hourly recompensed by the festivity\nof his temper;\u00e2\u0080\u0094it supplied all defects:\u00e2\u0080\u0094I had a constant resource in his\nlooks in all difficulties and distresses of my own\u00e2\u0080\u0094I was going to have\nadded of his too; but La Fleur was out of the reach of every thing; for,\nwhether \u00e2\u0080\u0099twas hunger or thirst, or cold or nakedness, or watchings, or\nwhatever stripes of ill luck La Fleur met with in our journeyings, there\nwas no index in his physiognomy to point them out by,\u00e2\u0080\u0094he was eternally\nthe same; so that if I am a piece of a philosopher, which Satan now and\nthen puts it into my head I am,\u00e2\u0080\u0094it always mortifies the pride of the\nconceit, by reflecting how much I owe to the complexional philosophy of\nthis poor fellow, for shaming me into one of a better kind.  With all\nthis, La Fleur had a small cast of the coxcomb,\u00e2\u0080\u0094but he seemed at first\nsight to be more a coxcomb of nature than of art; and, before I had been\nthree days in Paris with him,\u00e2\u0080\u0094he seemed to be no coxcomb at all.\n\n\n\n\nMONTREUIL.\n\n\nTHE next morning, La Fleur entering upon his employment, I delivered to\nhim the key of my portmanteau, with an inventory of my half a dozen\nshirts and silk pair of breeches, and bid him fasten all upon the\nchaise,\u00e2\u0080\u0094get the horses put to,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and desire the landlord to come in with\nhis bill.\n\n_C\u00e2\u0080\u0099est un garcon de bonne fortune_, said the landlord, pointing through\nthe window to half a dozen wenches who had got round about La Fleur, and\nwere most kindly taking their leave of him, as the postilion was leading\nout the horses.  La Fleur kissed all their hands round and round again,\nand thrice he wiped his eyes, and thrice he promised he would bring them\nall pardons from Rome.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094The young fellow, said the landlord, is beloved by all the town, and\nthere is scarce a corner in Montreuil where the want of him will not be\nfelt: he has but one misfortune in the world, continued he, \u00e2\u0080\u009che is always\nin love.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094I am heartily glad of it, said I,\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099twill save me the trouble\nevery night of putting my breeches under my head.  In saying this, I was\nmaking not so much La Fleur\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eloge as my own, having been in love with\none princess or another almost all my life, and I hope I shall go on so\ntill I die, being firmly persuaded, that if ever I do a mean action, it\nmust be in some interval betwixt one passion and another: whilst this\ninterregnum lasts, I always perceive my heart locked up,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I can scarce\nfind in it to give Misery a sixpence; and therefore I always get out of\nit as fast as I can\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the moment I am rekindled, I am all generosity\nand good-will again; and would do anything in the world, either for or\nwith any one, if they will but satisfy me there is no sin in it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094But in saying this,\u00e2\u0080\u0094sure I am commanding the passion,\u00e2\u0080\u0094not myself.\n\n\n\n\nA FRAGMENT.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094THE town of Abdera, notwithstanding Democritus lived there, trying all\nthe powers of irony and laughter to reclaim it, was the vilest and most\nprofligate town in all Thrace.  What for poisons, conspiracies, and\nassassinations,\u00e2\u0080\u0094libels, pasquinades, and tumults, there was no going\nthere by day\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099twas worse by night.\n\nNow, when things were at the worst, it came to pass that the Andromeda of\nEuripides being represented at Abdera, the whole orchestra was delighted\nwith it: but of all the passages which delighted them, nothing operated\nmore upon their imaginations than the tender strokes of nature which the\npoet had wrought up in that pathetic speech of Perseus, _O Cupid_,\n_prince of gods and men_! &c.  Every man almost spoke pure iambics the\nnext day, and talked of nothing but Perseus his pathetic address,\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009c_O\nCupid! prince of gods and men_!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094in every street of Abdera, in every\nhouse, \u00e2\u0080\u009cO Cupid!

Had the whole _parterre_ cried out, _Place aux dames_, with\none voice, it would not have conveyed the sentiment of a deference for\nthe sex with half the effect.\n\nJust Heaven! for what wise reasons hast thou ordered it, that beggary and\nurbanity, which are at such variance in other countries, should find a\nway to be at unity in this?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094I insisted upon presenting him with a single sous, merely for his\n_politesse_.\n\nA poor little dwarfish brisk fellow, who stood over against me in the\ncircle, putting something first under his arm, which had once been a hat,\ntook his snuff-box out of his pocket, and generously offer\u00e2\u0080\u0099d a pinch on\nboth sides of him: it was a gift of consequence, and modestly\ndeclined.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The poor little fellow pressed it upon them with a nod of\nwelcomeness.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Prenez en\u00e2\u0080\u0094prenez_, said he, looking another way; so they\neach took a pinch.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Pity thy box should ever want one! said I to myself;\nso I put a couple of sous into it\u00e2\u0080\u0094taking a small pinch out of his box, to\nenhance their value, as I did it.  He felt the weight of the second\nobligation more than of the first,\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099twas doing him an honour,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the other\nwas only doing him a charity;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and he made me a bow down to the ground for\nit.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094Here! said I to an old soldier with one hand, who had been campaigned\nand worn out to death in the service\u00e2\u0080\u0094here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a couple of sous for\nthee.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Vive le Roi_! said the old soldier.\n\nI had then but three sous left: so I gave one, simply, _pour l\u00e2\u0080\u0099amour de\nDieu_, which was the footing on which it was begg\u00e2\u0080\u0099d.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The poor woman had a\ndislocated hip; so it could not be well upon any other motive.\n\n_Mon cher et tr\u00c3\u00a8s-charitable Monsieur_.\u00e2\u0080\u0094There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no opposing this, said I.\n\n_Milord Anglois_\u00e2\u0080\u0094the very sound was worth the money;\u00e2\u0080\u0094so I gave _my last\nsous for it_.  But in the eagerness of giving, I had overlooked a _pauvre\nhonteux_, who had had no one to ask a sous for him, and who, I believe,\nwould have perished, ere he could have ask\u00e2\u0080\u0099d one for himself: he stood by\nthe chaise a little without the circle, and wiped a tear from a face\nwhich I thought had seen better days.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Good God! said I\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I have not one\nsingle sous left to give him.\u00e2\u0080\u0094But you have a thousand! cried all the\npowers of nature, stirring within me;\u00e2\u0080\u0094so I gave him\u00e2\u0080\u0094no matter what\u00e2\u0080\u0094I am\nashamed to say _how much_ now,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and was ashamed to think how little, then:\nso, if the reader can form any conjecture of my disposition, as these two\nfixed points are given him, he may judge within a livre or two what was\nthe precise sum.\n\nI could afford nothing for the rest, but _Dieu vous b\u00c3\u00a9nisse_!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Et le bon Dieu vous b\u00c3\u00a9nisse encore_, said the old soldier, the dwarf,\n&c.  The _pauvre honteux_ could say nothing;\u00e2\u0080\u0094he pull\u00e2\u0080\u0099d out a little\nhandkerchief, and wiped his face as he turned away\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I thought he\nthanked me more than them all.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BIDET.\n\n\nHAVING settled all these little matters, I got into my post-chaise with\nmore ease than ever I got into a post-chaise in my life; and La Fleur\nhaving got one large jack-boot on the far side of a little _bidet_, {588}\nand another on this (for I count nothing of his legs)\u00e2\u0080\u0094he canter\u00e2\u0080\u0099d away\nbefore me as happy and as perpendicular as a prince.\u00e2\u0080\u0094But what is\nhappiness! what is grandeur in this painted scene of life!  A dead ass,\nbefore we had got a league, put a sudden stop to La Fleur\u00e2\u0080\u0099s career;\u00e2\u0080\u0094his\nbidet would not pass by it,\u00e2\u0080\u0094a contention arose betwixt them, and the poor\nfellow was kick\u00e2\u0080\u0099d out of his jack-boots the very first kick.\n\nLa Fleur bore his fall like a French Christian, saying neither more nor\nless upon it, than _Diable_!  So presently got up, and came to the charge\nagain astride his bidet, beating him up to it as he would have beat his\ndrum.\n\nThe bidet flew from one side of the road to the other, then back\nagain,\u00e2\u0080\u0094then this way, then that way, and in short, every way but by the\ndead ass:\u00e2\u0080\u0094La Fleur insisted upon the thing\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the bidet threw him.\n\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the matter, La Fleur, said I, with this bidet of thine?  Monsieur,\nsaid he, _c\u00e2\u0080\u0099est un cheval le plus opini\u00c3\u00a2tre du monde_.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Nay, if he is a\nconceited beast, he must go his own way, replied I.  So La Fleur got off\nhim, and giving him a good sound lash, the bidet took me at my word, and\naway he scampered back to Montreuil.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Peste_! said La Fleur.\n\nIt is not _mal-\u00c3\u00a0-propos_ to take notice here, that though La Fleur\navailed himself but of two different terms of exclamation in this\nencounter,\u00e2\u0080\u0094namely, _Diable_! and _Peste_! that there are, nevertheless,\nthree in the French language: like the positive, comparative, and\nsuperlative, one or the other of which serves for every unexpected throw\nof the dice in life.\n\n_Le Diable_! which is the first, and positive degree, is generally used\nupon ordinary emotions of the mind, where small things only fall out\ncontrary to your expectations; such as\u00e2\u0080\u0094the throwing once doublets\u00e2\u0080\u0094La\nFleur\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being kick\u00e2\u0080\u0099d off his horse, and so forth.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Cuckoldom, for the same\nreason, is always\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Le Diable_!\n\nBut, in cases where the cast has something provoking in it, as in that of\nthe bidet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s running away after, and leaving La Fleur aground in\njack-boots,\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099tis the second degree.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis then _Peste_!\n\nAnd for the third\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094But here my heart is wrung with pity and fellow feeling, when I reflect\nwhat miseries must have been their lot, and how bitterly so refined a\npeople must have smarted, to have forced them upon the use of it.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nGrant me, O ye powers which touch the tongue with eloquence in\ndistress!\u00e2\u0080\u0094what ever is my _cast_, grant me but decent words to exclaim\nin, and I will give my nature way.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094But as these were not to be had in France, I resolved to take every evil\njust as it befell me, without any exclamation at all.\n\nLa Fleur, who had made no such covenant with himself, followed the bidet\nwith his eyes till it was got out of sight,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and then, you may imagine, if\nyou please, with what word he closed the whole affair.\n\nAs there was no hunting down a frightened horse in jack-boots, there\nremained no alternative but taking La Fleur either behind the chaise, or\ninto it.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nI preferred the latter, and in half an hour we got to the post-house at\nNampont.\n\n\n\n\nNAMPONT.\nTHE DEAD ASS.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094AND this, said he, putting the remains of a crust into his wallet\u00e2\u0080\u0094and\nthis should have been thy portion, said he, hadst thou been alive to have\nshared it with me.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I thought, by the accent, it had been an apostrophe to\nhis child; but \u00e2\u0080\u0099twas to his ass, and to the very ass we had seen dead in\nthe road, which had occasioned La Fleur\u00e2\u0080\u0099s misadventure.  The man seemed\nto lament it much; and it instantly brought into my mind Sancho\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nlamentation for his; but he did it with more true touches of nature.\n\nThe mourner was sitting upon a stone bench at the door, with the ass\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\npannel and its bridle on one side, which he took up from time to\ntime,\u00e2\u0080\u0094then laid them down,\u00e2\u0080\u0094look\u00e2\u0080\u0099d at them, and shook his head.  He then\ntook his crust of bread out of his wallet again, as if to eat it; held it\nsome time in his hand,\u00e2\u0080\u0094then laid it upon the bit of his ass\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nbridle,\u00e2\u0080\u0094looked wistfully at the little arrangement he had made\u00e2\u0080\u0094and then\ngave a sigh.\n\nThe simplicity of his grief drew numbers about him, and La Fleur amongst\nthe rest, whilst the horses were getting ready; as I continued sitting in\nthe post-chaise, I could see and hear over their heads.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094He said he had come last from Spain, where he had been from the furthest\nborders of Franconia; and had got so far on his return home, when his ass\ndied.  Every one seemed desirous to know what business could have taken\nso old and poor a man so far a journey from his own home.\n\nIt had pleased heaven, he said, to bless him with three sons, the finest\nlads in Germany; but having in one week lost two of the eldest of them by\nthe small-pox, and the youngest falling ill of the same distemper, he was\nafraid of being bereft of them all; and made a vow, if heaven would not\ntake him from him also, he would go in gratitude to St. Iago in Spain.\n\nWhen the mourner got thus far on his story, he stopp\u00e2\u0080\u0099d to pay Nature her\ntribute,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and wept bitterly.\n\nHe said, heaven had accepted the conditions; and that he had set out from\nhis cottage with this poor creature, who had been a patient partner of\nhis journey;\u00e2\u0080\u0094that it had eaten the same bread with him all the way, and\nwas unto him as a friend.\n\nEvery body who stood about, heard the poor fellow with concern.\u00e2\u0080\u0094La Fleur\noffered him money.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The mourner said he did not want it;\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was not the\nvalue of the ass\u00e2\u0080\u0094but the loss of him.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The ass, he said, he was assured,\nloved him;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and upon this told them a long story of a mischance upon their\npassage over the Pyrenean mountains, which had separated them from each\nother three days; during which time the ass had sought him as much as he\nhad sought the ass, and that they had scarce either eaten or drank till\nthey met.\n\nThou hast one comfort, friend, said I, at least, in the loss of thy poor\nbeast; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure thou hast been a merciful master to him.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Alas! said the\nmourner, I thought so when he was alive;\u00e2\u0080\u0094but now that he is dead, I think\notherwise.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I fear the weight of myself and my afflictions together have\nbeen too much for him,\u00e2\u0080\u0094they have shortened the poor creature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s days, and\nI fear I have them to answer for.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Shame on the world! said I to\nmyself.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Did we but love each other as this poor soul loved his\nass\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099twould be something.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\n\n\nNAMPONT.\nTHE POSTILION.\n\n\nTHE concern which the poor fellow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story threw me into required some\nattention; the postilion paid not the least to it, but set off upon the\n_pav\u00c3\u00a9_ in a full gallop.\n\nThe thirstiest soul in the most sandy desert of Arabia could not have\nwished more for a cup of cold water, than mine did for grave and quiet\nmovements; and I should have had an high opinion of the postilion had he\nbut stolen off with me in something like a pensive pace.\u00e2\u0080\u0094On the contrary,\nas the mourner finished his lamentation, the fellow gave an unfeeling\nlash to each of his beasts, and set off clattering like a thousand\ndevils.\n\nI called to him as loud as I could, for heaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake to go slower:\u00e2\u0080\u0094and\nthe louder I called, the more unmercifully he galloped.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The deuce take\nhim and his galloping too\u00e2\u0080\u0094said I,\u00e2\u0080\u0094he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go on tearing my nerves to pieces\ntill he has worked me into a foolish passion, and then he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go slow that\nI may enjoy the sweets of it.\n\nThe postilion managed the point to a miracle: by the time he had got to\nthe foot of a steep hill, about half a league from Nampont,\u00e2\u0080\u0094he had put me\nout of temper with him,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and then with myself, for being so.\n\nMy case then required a different treatment; and a good rattling gallop\nwould have been of real service to me.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094Then, prithee, get on\u00e2\u0080\u0094get on, my good lad, said I.\n\nThe postilion pointed to the hill.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I then tried to return back to the\nstory of the poor German and his ass\u00e2\u0080\u0094but I had broke the clue,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and could\nno more get into it again, than the postilion could into a trot.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094The deuce go, said I, with it all!  Here am I sitting as candidly\ndisposed to make the best of the worst, as ever wight was, and all runs\ncounter.\n\nThere is one sweet lenitive at least for evils, which Nature holds out to\nus: so I took it kindly at her hands, and fell asleep; and the first word\nwhich roused me was _Amiens_.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094Bless me! said I, rubbing my eyes,\u00e2\u0080\u0094this is the very town where my poor\nlady is to come.\n\n\n\n\nAMIENS.\n\n\nTHE words were scarce out of my mouth when the Count de L\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099s post-chaise,\nwith his sister in it, drove hastily by: she had just time to make me a\nbow of recognition,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and of that particular kind of it, which told me she\nhad not yet done with me.  She was as good as her look; for, before I had\nquite finished my supper, her brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s servant came into the room with a\nbillet, in which she said she had taken the liberty to charge me with a\nletter, which I was to present myself to Madame R\u00e2\u0080\u0094 the first morning I\nhad nothing to do at Paris.  There was only added, she was sorry, but\nfrom what _penchant_ she had not considered, that she had been prevented\ntelling me her story,\u00e2\u0080\u0094that she still owed it to me; and if my route\nshould ever lay through Brussels, and I had not by then forgot the name\nof Madame de L\u00e2\u0080\u0094,\u00e2\u0080\u0094that Madame de L\u00e2\u0080\u0094 would be glad to discharge her\nobligation.\n\nThen I will meet thee, said I, fair spirit! at Brussels;\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099tis only\nreturning from Italy through Germany to Holland, by the route of\nFlanders, home;\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099twill scarce be ten posts out of my way; but, were it\nten thousand! with what a moral delight will it crown my journey, in\nsharing in the sickening incidents of a tale of misery told to me by such\na sufferer?  To see her weep! and, though I cannot dry up the fountain of\nher tears, what an exquisite sensation is there still left, in wiping\nthem away from off the cheeks of the first and fairest of women, as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\nsitting with my handkerchief in my hand in silence the whole night beside\nher?\n\nThere was nothing wrong in the sentiment; and yet I instantly reproached\nmy heart with it in the bitterest and most reprobate of expressions.\n\nIt had ever, as I told the reader, been one of the singular blessings of\nmy life, to be almost every hour of it miserably in love with some one;\nand my last flame happening to be blown out by a whiff of jealousy on the\nsudden turn of a corner, I had lighted it up afresh at the pure taper of\nEliza but about three months before,\u00e2\u0080\u0094swearing, as I did it, that it\nshould last me through the whole journey.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Why should I dissemble the\nmatter?  I had sworn to her eternal fidelity;\u00e2\u0080\u0094she had a right to my whole\nheart:\u00e2\u0080\u0094to divide my affections was to lessen them;\u00e2\u0080\u0094to expose them was to\nrisk them: where there is risk there may be loss:\u00e2\u0080\u0094and what wilt thou\nhave, Yorick, to answer to a heart so full of trust and confidence\u00e2\u0080\u0094so\ngood, so gentle, and unreproaching!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094I will not go to Brussels, replied I, interrupting myself.\u00e2\u0080\u0094But my\nimagination went on,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I recalled her looks at that crisis of our\nseparation, when neither of us had power to say adieu!

The poor soul burn\u00e2\u0080\u0099d with impatience; and\nthe Count de L\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099s servant coming with the letter, being the first\npracticable occasion which offer\u00e2\u0080\u0099d, La Fleur had laid hold of it; and, in\norder to do honour to his master, had taken him into a back parlour in\nthe auberge, and treated him with a cup or two of the best wine in\nPicardy; and the Count de L\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099s servant, in return, and not to be\nbehindhand in politeness with La Fleur, had taken him back with him to\nthe Count\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel.  La Fleur\u00e2\u0080\u0099s _prevenancy_ (for there was a passport in\nhis very looks) soon set every servant in the kitchen at ease with him;\nand as a Frenchman, whatever be his talents, has no sort of prudery in\nshowing them, La Fleur, in less than five minutes, had pulled out his\nfife, and leading off the dance himself with the first note, set the\n_fille de chambre_, the _ma\u00c3\u00aetre d\u00e2\u0080\u0099h\u00c3\u00b4tel_, the cook, the scullion, and all\nthe house-hold, dogs and cats, besides an old monkey, a dancing: I\nsuppose there never was a merrier kitchen since the flood.\n\nMadame de L\u00e2\u0080\u0094, in passing from her brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apartments to her own,\nhearing so much jollity below stairs, rung up her _fille de chambre_ to\nask about it; and, hearing it was the English gentleman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s servant, who\nhad set the whole house merry with his pipe, she ordered him up.\n\nAs the poor fellow could not present himself empty, he had loaded himself\nin going up stairs with a thousand compliments to Madame de L\u00e2\u0080\u0094, on the\npart of his master,\u00e2\u0080\u0094added a long apocrypha of inquiries after Madame de\nL\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health,\u00e2\u0080\u0094told her, that Monsieur his master was _au d\u00c3\u00a9sespoire_ for\nher re-establishment from the fatigues of her journey,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, to close all,\nthat Monsieur had received the letter which Madame had done him the\nhonour\u00e2\u0080\u0094And he has done me the honour, said Madame de L\u00e2\u0080\u0094, interrupting La\nFleur, to send a billet in return.\n\nMadame de L\u00e2\u0080\u0094 had said this with such a tone of reliance upon the fact,\nthat La Fleur had not power to disappoint her expectations;\u00e2\u0080\u0094he trembled\nfor my honour,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and possibly might not altogether be unconcerned for his\nown, as a man capable of being attached to a master who could be wanting\n_en \u00c3\u00a9gards vis \u00c3\u00a0 vis d\u00e2\u0080\u0099une femme_! so that when Madame de L\u00e2\u0080\u0094 asked La\nFleur if he had brought a letter,\u00e2\u0080\u0094_O qu\u00e2\u0080\u0099oui_, said La Fleur: so laying\ndown his hat upon the ground, and taking hold of the flap of his right\nside pocket with his left hand, he began to search for the letter with\nhis right;\u00e2\u0080\u0094then contrariwise.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Diable_! then sought every pocket\u00e2\u0080\u0094pocket\nby pocket, round, not forgetting his fob:\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Peste_!\u00e2\u0080\u0094then La Fleur emptied\nthem upon the floor,\u00e2\u0080\u0094pulled out a dirty cravat,\u00e2\u0080\u0094a handkerchief,\u00e2\u0080\u0094a comb,\u00e2\u0080\u0094a\nwhip lash,\u00e2\u0080\u0094a nightcap,\u00e2\u0080\u0094then gave a peep into his hat,\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Quelle\n\u00c3\u00a9tourderie_!  He had left the letter upon the table in the auberge;\u00e2\u0080\u0094he\nwould run for it, and be back with it in three minutes.\n\nI had just finished my supper when La Fleur came in to give me an account\nof his adventure: he told the whole story simply as it was: and only\nadded that if Monsieur had forgot (_par hazard_) to answer Madame\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nletter, the arrangement gave him an opportunity to recover the _faux\npas_;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and if not, that things were only as they were.\n\nNow I was not altogether sure of my _\u00c3\u00a9tiquette_, whether I ought to have\nwrote or no;\u00e2\u0080\u0094but if I had,\u00e2\u0080\u0094a devil himself could not have been angry:\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099twas but the officious zeal of a well meaning creature for my honour;\nand, however he might have mistook the road,\u00e2\u0080\u0094or embarrassed me in so\ndoing,\u00e2\u0080\u0094his heart was in no fault,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I was under no necessity to write;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and,\nwhat weighed more than all,\u00e2\u0080\u0094he did not look as if he had done amiss.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis all very well, La Fleur, said I.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099Twas sufficient.  La Fleur flew\nout of the room like lightning, and returned with pen, ink, and paper, in\nhis hand; and, coming up to the table, laid them close before me, with\nsuch a delight in his countenance, that I could not help taking up the\npen.\n\nI began and began again; and, though I had nothing to say, and that\nnothing might have been expressed in half a dozen lines, I made half a\ndozen different beginnings, and could no way please myself.\n\nIn short, I was in no mood to write.\n\nLa Fleur stepp\u00e2\u0080\u0099d out and brought a little water in a glass to dilute my\nink,\u00e2\u0080\u0094then fetch\u00e2\u0080\u0099d sand and seal-wax.\u00e2\u0080\u0094It was all one; I wrote, and\nblotted, and tore off, and burnt, and wrote again.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Le diable l\u00e2\u0080\u0099emporte_!\nsaid I, half to myself,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I cannot write this self-same letter, throwing\nthe pen down despairingly as I said it.\n\nAs soon as I had cast down my pen, La Fleur advanced with the most\nrespectful carriage up to the table, and making a thousand apologies for\nthe liberty he was going to take, told me he had a letter in his pocket\nwrote by a drummer in his regiment to a corporal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife, which he durst\nsay would suit the occasion.\n\nI had a mind to let the poor fellow have his humour.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Then prithee, said\nI, let me see it.\n\nLa Fleur instantly pulled out a little dirty pocket book cramm\u00e2\u0080\u0099d full of\nsmall letters and billet-doux in a sad condition, and laying it upon the\ntable, and then untying the string which held them all together, run them\nover, one by one, till he came to the letter in question,\u00e2\u0080\u0094_La voila_!\nsaid he, clapping his hands: so, unfolding it first, he laid it open\nbefore me, and retired three steps from the table whilst I read it.\n\n\n\n\nTHE LETTER.\n\n\nMadame,\n\nJe suis p\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9tr\u00c3\u00a9 de la douleur la plus vive, et r\u00c3\u00a9duit en m\u00c3\u00aame temps au\nd\u00c3\u00a9sespoir par ce retour impr\u00c3\u00a9v\u00c3\u00b9 du Caporal qui rend notre entrev\u00c3\u00bbe de ce\nsoir la chose du monde la plus impossible.\n\nMais vive la joie! et toute la mienne sera de penser \u00c3\u00a0 vous.\n\nL\u00e2\u0080\u0099amour n\u00e2\u0080\u0099est _rien_ sans sentiment.\n\nEt le sentiment est encore _moins_ sans amour.\n\nOn dit qu\u00e2\u0080\u0099on ne doit jamais se d\u00c3\u00a9sesper\u00c3\u00a9r.\n\nOn dit aussi que Monsieur le Caporal monte la garde Mercredi: alors ce\ncera mon tour.\n\n                           _Chacun \u00c3\u00a0 son tour_.\n\nEn attendant\u00e2\u0080\u0094Vive l\u00e2\u0080\u0099amour! et vive la bagatelle!\n\n                                                          Je suis, Madame,\n                                          Avec tous les sentimens les plus\n                                          respectueux et les plus tendres,\n                                                              tout \u00c3\u00a0 vous,\n                                                             JAQUES ROQUE.\n\nIt was but changing the Corporal into the Count,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and saying nothing about\nmounting guard on Wednesday,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the letter was neither right nor\nwrong:\u00e2\u0080\u0094so, to gratify the poor fellow, who stood trembling for my honour,\nhis own, and the honour of his letter,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I took the cream gently off it,\nand whipping it up in my own way, I seal\u00e2\u0080\u0099d it up and sent him with it to\nMadame de L\u00e2\u0080\u0094;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the next morning we pursued our journey to Paris.\n\n\n\n\nPARIS.\n\n\nWHEN a man can contest the point by dint of equipage, and carry all on\nfloundering before him with half a dozen of lackies and a couple of\ncooks\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099tis very well in such a place as Paris,\u00e2\u0080\u0094he may drive in at which\nend of a street he will.\n\nA poor prince who is weak in cavalry, and whose whole infantry does not\nexceed a single man, had best quit the field, and signalize himself in\nthe cabinet, if he can get up into it;\u00e2\u0080\u0094I say _up into it_\u00e2\u0080\u0094for there is no\ndescending perpendicular amongst \u00e2\u0080\u0099em with a \u00e2\u0080\u009c_Me voici_! _mes\nenfans_\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094here I am\u00e2\u0080\u0094whatever many may think.\n\nI own my first sensations, as soon as I was left solitary and alone in my\nown chamber in the hotel, were far from being so flattering as I had\nprefigured them.  I walked up gravely to the window in my dusty black\ncoat, and looking through the glass saw all the world in yellow, blue,\nand green, running at the ring of pleasure.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The old with broken lances,\nand in helmets which had lost their vizards;\u00e2\u0080\u0094the young in armour bright\nwhich shone like gold, beplumed with each gay feather of the\neast,\u00e2\u0080\u0094all,\u00e2\u0080\u0094all, tilting at it like fascinated knights in tournaments of\nyore for fame and love.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nAlas, poor Yorick! cried I, what art thou doing here?

All that can be said against the French\nsublime, in this instance of it, is this:\u00e2\u0080\u0094That the grandeur is _more_ in\nthe _word_, and _less_ in the _thing_.  No doubt, the ocean fills the\nmind with vast ideas; but Paris being so far inland, it was not likely I\nshould run post a hundred miles out of it, to try the experiment;\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\nParisian barber meant nothing.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nThe pail of water standing beside the great deep, makes, certainly, but a\nsorry figure in speech;\u00e2\u0080\u0094but, \u00e2\u0080\u0099twill be said,\u00e2\u0080\u0094it has one advantage\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099tis in\nthe next room, and the truth of the buckle may be tried in it, without\nmore ado, in a single moment.\n\nIn honest truth, and upon a more candid revision of the matter, _The\nFrench expression professes more than it performs_.\n\nI think I can see the precise and distinguishing marks of national\ncharacters more in these nonsensical _minuti\u00c3\u00a6_ than in the most important\nmatters of state; where great men of all nations talk and stalk so much\nalike, that I would not give ninepence to choose amongst them.\n\nI was so long in getting from under my barber\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands, that it was too\nlate to think of going with my letter to Madame R\u00e2\u0080\u0094 that night: but when a\nman is once dressed at all points for going out, his reflections turn to\nlittle account; so taking down the name of the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Modene, where I\nlodged, I walked forth without any determination where to go;\u00e2\u0080\u0094I shall\nconsider of that, said I, as I walk along.\n\n\n\n\nTHE PULSE.\nPARIS.\n\n\nHAIL, ye small sweet courtesies of life, for smooth do ye make the road\nof it! like grace and beauty, which beget inclinations to love at first\nsight: \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis ye who open this door and let the stranger in.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094Pray, Madame, said I, have the goodness to tell me which way I must turn\nto go to the Op\u00c3\u00a9ra Comique?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Most willingly, Monsieur, said she, laying\naside her work.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nI had given a cast with my eye into half a dozen shops, as I came along,\nin search of a face not likely to be disordered by such an interruption:\ntill at last, this, hitting my fancy, I had walked in.\n\nShe was working a pair of ruffles, as she sat in a low chair, on the far\nside of the shop, facing the door.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Tres volontiers_, most willingly, said she, laying her work down upon a\nchair next her, and rising up from the low chair she was sitting in, with\nso cheerful a movement, and so cheerful a look, that had I been laying\nout fifty louis d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ors with her, I should have said\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis woman is\ngrateful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nYou must turn, Monsieur, said she, going with me to the door of the shop,\nand pointing the way down the street I was to take,\u00e2\u0080\u0094you must turn first\nto your left hand,\u00e2\u0080\u0094_mais prenez garde_\u00e2\u0080\u0094there are two turns; and be so\ngood as to take the second\u00e2\u0080\u0094then go down a little way and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see a\nchurch: and, when you are past it, give yourself the trouble to turn\ndirectly to the right, and that will lead you to the foot of the Pont\nNeuf, which you must cross\u00e2\u0080\u0094and there any one will do himself the pleasure\nto show you.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nShe repeated her instructions three times over to me, with the same\ngoodnatur\u00e2\u0080\u0099d patience the third time as the first;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and if _tones and\nmanners_ have a meaning, which certainly they have, unless to hearts\nwhich shut them out,\u00e2\u0080\u0094she seemed really interested that I should not lose\nmyself.\n\nI will not suppose it was the woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beauty, notwithstanding she was the\nhandsomest grisette, I think, I ever saw, which had much to do with the\nsense I had of her courtesy; only I remember, when I told her how much I\nwas obliged to her, that I looked very full in her eyes,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and that I\nrepeated my thanks as often as she had done her instructions.\n\nI had not got ten paces from the door, before I found I had forgot every\ntittle of what she had said;\u00e2\u0080\u0094so looking back, and seeing her still\nstanding in the door of the shop, as if to look whether I went right or\nnot,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I returned back to ask her, whether the first turn was to my right\nor left,\u00e2\u0080\u0094for that I had absolutely forgot.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Is it possible! said she, half\nlaughing.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis very possible, replied I, when a man is thinking more of\na woman than of her good advice.\n\nAs this was the real truth\u00e2\u0080\u0094she took it, as every woman takes a matter of\nright, with a slight curtsey.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Attendez_! said she, laying her hand upon my arm to detain me, whilst\nshe called a lad out of the back shop to get ready a parcel of gloves.  I\nam just going to send him, said she, with a packet into that quarter, and\nif you will have the complaisance to step in, it will be ready in a\nmoment, and he shall attend you to the place.\u00e2\u0080\u0094So I walk\u00e2\u0080\u0099d in with her to\nthe far side of the shop: and taking up the ruffle in my hand which she\nlaid upon the chair, as if I had a mind to sit, she sat down herself in\nher low chair, and I instantly sat myself down beside her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094He will be ready, Monsieur, said she, in a moment.\u00e2\u0080\u0094And in that moment,\nreplied I, most willingly would I say something very civil to you for all\nthese courtesies.  Any one may do a casual act of good nature, but a\ncontinuation of them shows it is a part of the temperature; and\ncertainly, added I, if it is the same blood which comes from the heart\nwhich descends to the extremes (touching her wrist) I am sure you must\nhave one of the best pulses of any woman in the world.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Feel it, said she,\nholding out her arm.  So laying down my hat, I took hold of her fingers\nin one hand, and applied the two forefingers of my other to the artery.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094Would to heaven! my dear Eugenius, thou hadst passed by, and beheld me\nsitting in my black coat, and in my lack-a-day-sical manner, counting the\nthrobs of it, one by one, with as much true devotion as if I had been\nwatching the critical ebb or flow of her fever.\u00e2\u0080\u0094How wouldst thou have\nlaugh\u00e2\u0080\u0099d and moralized upon my new profession!\u00e2\u0080\u0094and thou shouldst have\nlaugh\u00e2\u0080\u0099d and moralized on.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Trust me, my dear Eugenius, I should have said,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are worse occupations in this world _than feeling a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\npulse_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094But a grisette\u00e2\u0080\u0099s! thou wouldst have said,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and in an open shop!\nYorick\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094So much the better: for when my views are direct, Eugenius, I care not\nif all the world saw me feel it.\n\n\n\n\nTHE HUSBAND.\nPARIS.\n\n\nI HAD counted twenty pulsations, and was going on fast towards the\nfortieth, when her husband, coming unexpected from a back parlour into\nthe shop, put me a little out of my reckoning.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099Twas nobody but her\nhusband, she said;\u00e2\u0080\u0094so I began a fresh score.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Monsieur is so good, quoth\nshe, as he pass\u00e2\u0080\u0099d by us, as to give himself the trouble of feeling my\npulse.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The husband took off his hat, and making me a bow, said, I did him\ntoo much honour\u00e2\u0080\u0094and having said that, he put on his hat and walk\u00e2\u0080\u0099d out.\n\nGood God! said I to myself, as he went out,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and can this man be the\nhusband of this woman!\n\nLet it not torment the few who know what must have been the grounds of\nthis exclamation, if I explain it to those who do not.\n\nIn London a shopkeeper and a shopkeeper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife seem to be one bone and\none flesh: in the several endowments of mind and body, sometimes the one,\nsometimes the other has it, so as, in general, to be upon a par, and\ntotally with each other as nearly as man and wife need to do.\n\nIn Paris, there are scarce two orders of beings more different: for the\nlegislative and executive powers of the shop not resting in the husband,\nhe seldom comes there:\u00e2\u0080\u0094in some dark and dismal room behind, he sits\ncommerce-less, in his thrum nightcap, the same rough son of Nature that\nNature left him.\n\nThe genius of a people, where nothing but the monarchy is _salique_,\nhaving ceded this department, with sundry others, totally to the\nwomen,\u00e2\u0080\u0094by a continual higgling with customers of all ranks and sizes from\nmorning to night, like so many rough pebbles shook long together in a\nbag, by amicable collisions they have worn down their asperities and\nsharp angles, and not only become round and smooth, but will receive,\nsome of them, a polish like a brilliant:\u00e2\u0080\u0094Monsieur _le Mari_ is little\nbetter than the stone under your foot.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094Surely,\u00e2\u0080\u0094surely, man! it is not good for thee to sit alone:\u00e2\u0080\u0094thou wast\nmade for social intercourse and gentle greetings; and this improvement of\nour natures from it I appeal to as my evidence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094And how does it beat, Monsieur? said she.\u00e2\u0080\u0094With all the benignity, said\nI, looking quietly in her eyes, that I expected.\u00e2\u0080\u0094She was going to say\nsomething civil in return\u00e2\u0080\u0094but the lad came into the shop with the\ngloves.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_\u00c3\u0081 propos_, said I, I want a couple of pairs myself.\n\n\n\n\nTHE GLOVES.\nPARIS.\n\n\nTHE beautiful grisette rose up when I said this, and going behind the\ncounter, reach\u00e2\u0080\u0099d down a parcel and untied it: I advanced to the side over\nagainst her: they were all too large.  The beautiful grisette measured\nthem one by one across my hand.\u00e2\u0080\u0094It would not alter their dimensions.\u00e2\u0080\u0094She\nbegg\u00e2\u0080\u0099d I would try a single pair, which seemed to be the least.\u00e2\u0080\u0094She held\nit open;\u00e2\u0080\u0094my hand slipped into it at once.\u00e2\u0080\u0094It will not do, said I, shaking\nmy head a little.\u00e2\u0080\u0094No, said she, doing the same thing.\n\nThere are certain combined looks of simple subtlety,\u00e2\u0080\u0094where whim, and\nsense, and seriousness, and nonsense, are so blended, that all the\nlanguages of Babel set loose together, could not express them;\u00e2\u0080\u0094they are\ncommunicated and caught so instantaneously, that you can scarce say which\nparty is the infector.  I leave it to your men of words to swell pages\nabout it\u00e2\u0080\u0094it is enough in the present to say again, the gloves would not\ndo; so, folding our hands within our arms, we both lolled upon the\ncounter\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was narrow, and there was just room for the parcel to lay\nbetween us.\n\nThe beautiful grisette looked sometimes at the gloves, then sideways to\nthe window, then at the gloves,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and then at me.  I was not disposed to\nbreak silence:\u00e2\u0080\u0094I followed her example: so, I looked at the gloves, then\nto the window, then at the gloves, and then at her,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and so on\nalternately.\n\nI found I lost considerably in every attack:\u00e2\u0080\u0094she had a quick black eye,\nand shot through two such long and silken eyelashes with such\npenetration, that she look\u00e2\u0080\u0099d into my very heart and reins.\u00e2\u0080\u0094It may seem\nstrange, but I could actually feel she did.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nIt is no matter, said I, taking up a couple of the pairs next me, and\nputting them into my pocket.\n\nI was sensible the beautiful grisette had not asked above a single livre\nabove the price.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I wish\u00e2\u0080\u0099d she had asked a livre more, and was puzzling my\nbrains how to bring the matter about.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Do you think, my dear Sir, said\nshe, mistaking my embarrassment, that I could ask a sous too much of a\nstranger\u00e2\u0080\u0094and of a stranger whose politeness, more than his want of\ngloves, has done me the honour to lay himself at my mercy?\u00e2\u0080\u0094_M\u00e2\u0080\u0099en croyez\ncapable_?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Faith! not I, said I; and if you were, you are welcome.  So\ncounting the money into her hand, and with a lower bow than one generally\nmakes to a shopkeeper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife, I went out, and her lad with his parcel\nfollowed me.\n\n\n\n\nTHE TRANSLATION.\nPARIS.\n\n\nTHERE was nobody in the box I was let into but a kindly old French\nofficer.  I love the character, not only because I honour the man whose\nmanners are softened by a profession which makes bad men worse; but that\nI once knew one,\u00e2\u0080\u0094for he is no more,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and why should I not rescue one page\nfrom violation by writing his name in it, and telling the world it was\nCaptain Tobias Shandy, the dearest of my flock and friends, whose\nphilanthropy I never think of at this long distance from his death\u00e2\u0080\u0094but my\neyes gush out with tears.  For his sake I have a predilection for the\nwhole corps of veterans; and so I strode over the two back rows of\nbenches and placed myself beside him.\n\nThe old officer was reading attentively a small pamphlet, it might be the\nbook of the opera, with a large pair of spectacles.  As soon as I sat\ndown, he took his spectacles off, and putting them into a shagreen case,\nreturn\u00e2\u0080\u0099d them and the book into his pocket together.  I half rose up, and\nmade him a bow.\n\nTranslate this into any civilized language in the world\u00e2\u0080\u0094the sense is\nthis:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a poor stranger come into the box\u00e2\u0080\u0094he seems as if he knew nobody;\nand is never likely, was he to be seven years in Paris, if every man he\ncomes near keeps his spectacles upon his nose:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099tis shutting the door of\nconversation absolutely in his face\u00e2\u0080\u0094and using him worse than a German.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe French officer might as well have said it all aloud: and if he had, I\nshould in course have put the bow I made him into French too, and told\nhim, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was sensible of his attention, and return\u00e2\u0080\u0099d him a thousand thanks\nfor it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere is not a secret so aiding to the progress of sociality, as to get\nmaster of this _short hand_, and to be quick in rendering the several\nturns of looks and limbs with all their inflections and delineations,\ninto plain words.  For my own part, by long habitude, I do it so\nmechanically, that, when I walk the streets of London, I go translating\nall the way; and have more than once stood behind in the circle, where\nnot three words have been said, and have brought off twenty different\ndialogues with me, which I could have fairly wrote down and sworn to.\n\nI was going one evening to Martini\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concert at Milan, and, was just\nentering the door of the hall, when the Marquisina di F\u00e2\u0080\u0094 was coming out\nin a sort of a hurry:\u00e2\u0080\u0094she was almost upon me before I saw her; so I gave\na spring to once side to let her pass.\u00e2\u0080\u0094She had done the same, and on the\nsame side too; so we ran our heads together: she instantly got to the\nother side to get out: I was just as unfortunate as she had been, for I\nhad sprung to that side, and opposed her passage again.\u00e2\u0080\u0094We both flew\ntogether to the other side, and then back,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and so on:\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was ridiculous:\nwe both blush\u00e2\u0080\u0099d intolerably: so I did at last the thing I should have\ndone at first;\u00e2\u0080\u0094I stood stock-still, and the Marquisina had no more\ndifficulty.  I had no power to go into the room, till I had made her so\nmuch reparation as to wait and follow her with my eye to the end of the\npassage.  She look\u00e2\u0080\u0099d back twice, and walk\u00e2\u0080\u0099d along it rather sideways, as\nif she would make room for any one coming up stairs to pass her.\u00e2\u0080\u0094No, said\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0094that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a vile translation: the Marquisina has a right to the best\napology I can make her, and that opening is left for me to do it in;\u00e2\u0080\u0094so I\nran and begg\u00e2\u0080\u0099d pardon for the embarrassment I had given her, saying it\nwas my intention to have made her way.  She answered, she was guided by\nthe same intention towards me;\u00e2\u0080\u0094so we reciprocally thank\u00e2\u0080\u0099d each other.\nShe was at the top of the stairs; and seeing no _cicisbeo_ near her, I\nbegg\u00e2\u0080\u0099d to hand her to her coach;\u00e2\u0080\u0094so we went down the stairs, stopping at\nevery third step to talk of the concert and the adventure.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Upon my word,\nMadame, said I, when I had handed her in, I made six different efforts to\nlet you go out.\u00e2\u0080\u0094And I made six efforts, replied she, to let you enter.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\nwish to heaven you would make a seventh, said I.\u00e2\u0080\u0094With all my heart, said\nshe, making room.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Life is too short to be long about the forms of it,\u00e2\u0080\u0094so\nI instantly stepp\u00e2\u0080\u0099d in, and she carried me home with her.\u00e2\u0080\u0094And what became\nof the concert, St. Cecilia, who I suppose was at it, knows more than I.\n\nI will only add, that the connexion which arose out of the translation\ngave me more pleasure than any one I had the honour to make in Italy.\n\n\n\n\nTHE DWARF.\nPARIS.\n\n\nI HAD never heard the remark made by any one in my life, except by one;\nand who that was will probably come out in this chapter; so that being\npretty much unprepossessed, there must have been grounds for what struck\nme the moment I cast my eyes over the parterre,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and that was, the\nunaccountable sport of Nature in forming such numbers of dwarfs.\u00e2\u0080\u0094No doubt\nshe sports at certain times in almost every corner of the world; but in\nParis there is no end to her amusements.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The goddess seems almost as\nmerry as she is wise.\n\nAs I carried my idea out of the Op\u00c3\u00a9ra Comique with me, I measured every\nbody I saw walking in the streets by it.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Melancholy application!\nespecially where the size was extremely little,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the face extremely\ndark,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the eyes quick,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the nose long,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the teeth white,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the jaw\nprominent,\u00e2\u0080\u0094to see so many miserables, by force of accidents driven out of\ntheir own proper class into the very verge of another, which it gives me\npain to write down:\u00e2\u0080\u0094every third man a pigmy!\u00e2\u0080\u0094some by rickety heads and\nhump backs;\u00e2\u0080\u0094others by bandy legs;\u00e2\u0080\u0094a third set arrested by the hand of\nNature in the sixth and seventh years of their growth;\u00e2\u0080\u0094a fourth, in their\nperfect and natural state like dwarf apple trees; from the first\nrudiments and stamina of their existence, never meant to grow higher.\n\nA Medical Traveller might say, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis owing to undue bandages;\u00e2\u0080\u0094a Splenetic\none, to want of air;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and an Inquisitive Traveller, to fortify the system,\nmay measure the height of their houses,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the narrowness of their streets,\nand in how few feet square in the sixth and seventh stories such numbers\nof the bourgeoisie eat and sleep together; but I remember Mr. Shandy the\nelder, who accounted for nothing like any body else, in speaking one\nevening of these matters, averred that children, like other animals,\nmight be increased almost to any size, provided they came right into the\nworld; but the misery was, the citizens of were Paris so coop\u00e2\u0080\u0099d up, that\nthey had not actually room enough to get them.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I do not call it getting\nanything, said he;\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099tis getting nothing.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Nay, continued he, rising in his\nargument, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis getting worse than nothing, when all you have got after\ntwenty or five and twenty years of the tenderest care and most nutritious\naliment bestowed upon it, shall not at last be as high as my leg.  Now,\nMr. Shandy being very short, there could be nothing more said of it.\n\nAs this is not a work of reasoning, I leave the solution as I found it,\nand content myself with the truth only of the remark, which is verified\nin every lane and by-lane of Paris.  I was walking down that which leads\nfrom the Carousal to the Palais Royal, and observing a little boy in some\ndistress at the side of the gutter which ran down the middle of it, I\ntook hold of his hand and help\u00e2\u0080\u0099d him over.  Upon turning up his face to\nlook at him after, I perceived he was about forty.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Never mind, said I,\nsome good body will do as much for me when I am ninety.\n\nI feel some little principles within me which incline me to be merciful\ntowards this poor blighted part of my species, who have neither size nor\nstrength to get on in the world.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I cannot bear to see one of them trod\nupon; and had scarce got seated beside my old French officer, ere the\ndisgust was exercised, by seeing the very thing happen under the box we\nsat in.\n\nAt the end of the orchestra, and betwixt that and the first side box,\nthere is a small esplanade left, where, when the house is full, numbers\nof all ranks take sanctuary.  Though you stand, as in the parterre, you\npay the same price as in the orchestra.  A poor defenceless being of this\norder had got thrust somehow or other into this luckless place;\u00e2\u0080\u0094the night\nwas hot, and he was surrounded by beings two feet and a half higher than\nhimself.  The dwarf suffered inexpressibly on all sides; but the thing\nwhich incommoded him most, was a tall corpulent German, near seven feet\nhigh, who stood directly betwixt him and all possibility of his seeing\neither the stage or the actors.  The poor dwarf did all he could to get a\npeep at what was going forwards, by seeking for some little opening\nbetwixt the German\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm and his body, trying first on one side, then the\nother; but the German stood square in the most unaccommodating posture\nthat can be imagined:\u00e2\u0080\u0094the dwarf might as well have been placed at the\nbottom of the deepest draw-well in Paris; so he civilly reached up his\nhand to the German\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sleeve, and told him his distress.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The German turn\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\nhis head back, looked down upon him as Goliah did upon David,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and\nunfeelingly resumed his posture.\n\nI was just then taking a pinch of snuff out of my monk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little horn\nbox.\u00e2\u0080\u0094And how would thy meek and courteous spirit, my dear monk! so\ntemper\u00e2\u0080\u0099d to _bear and forbear_!\u00e2\u0080\u0094how sweetly would it have lent an ear to\nthis poor soul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complaint!\n\nThe old French officer, seeing me lift up my eyes with an emotion, as I\nmade the apostrophe, took the liberty to ask me what was the matter?\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\ntold him the story in three words; and added, how inhuman it was.\n\nBy this time the dwarf was driven to extremes, and in his first\ntransports, which are generally unreasonable, had told the German he\nwould cut off his long queue with his knife.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The German look\u00e2\u0080\u0099d back\ncoolly, and told him he was welcome, if he could reach it.\n\nAn injury sharpen\u00e2\u0080\u0099d by an insult, be it to whom it will, makes every man\nof sentiment a party: I could have leap\u00e2\u0080\u0099d out of the box to have\nredressed it.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The old French officer did it with much less confusion; for\nleaning a little over, and nodding to a sentinel, and pointing at the\nsame time with his finger at the distress,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the sentinel made his way to\nit.\u00e2\u0080\u0094There was no occasion to tell the grievance,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the thing told himself;\nso thrusting back the German instantly with his musket,\u00e2\u0080\u0094he took the poor\ndwarf by the hand, and placed him before him.\u00e2\u0080\u0094This is noble! said I,\nclapping my hands together.\u00e2\u0080\u0094And yet you would not permit this, said the\nold officer, in England.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094In England, dear Sir, said I, _we sit all at our ease_.\n\nThe old French officer would have set me at unity with myself, in case I\nhad been at variance,\u00e2\u0080\u0094by saying it was a _bon mot_;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, as a _bon mot_\nis always worth something at Paris, he offered me a pinch of snuff.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ROSE.\nPARIS.\n\n\nIT was now my turn to ask the old French officer \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat was the matter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nfor a cry of \u00e2\u0080\u009c_Haussez les mains_, _Monsieur l\u00e2\u0080\u0099Abb\u00c3\u00a9_!\u00e2\u0080\u009d re-echoed from a\ndozen different parts of the parterre, was as unintelligible to me, as my\napostrophe to the monk had been to him.\n\nHe told me it was some poor Abb\u00c3\u00a9 in one of the upper loges, who, he\nsupposed, had got planted perdu behind a couple of grisettes in order to\nsee the opera, and that the parterre espying him, were insisting upon his\nholding up both his hands during the representation.\u00e2\u0080\u0094And can it be\nsupposed, said I, that an ecclesiastic would pick the grisettes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 pockets?\nThe old French officer smiled, and whispering in my ear, opened a door of\nknowledge which I had no idea of.\n\nGood God! said I, turning pale with astonishment\u00e2\u0080\u0094is it possible, that a\npeople so smit with sentiment should at the same time be so unclean, and\nso unlike themselves,\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Quelle grossi\u00c3\u00a8rt\u00c3\u00a9_! added I.\n\nThe French officer told me, it was an illiberal sarcasm at the church,\nwhich had begun in the theatre about the time the Tartuffe was given in\nit by Moli\u00c3\u00a8re: but like other remains of Gothic manners, was\ndeclining.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Every nation, continued he, have their refinements and\n_grossi\u00c3\u00a8rt\u00c3\u00a9s_, in which they take the lead, and lose it of one another by\nturns:\u00e2\u0080\u0094that he had been in most countries, but never in one where he\nfound not some delicacies, which others seemed to want.  _Le_ POUR _et\nle_ CONTRE _se trouvent en chaque nation_; there is a balance, said he,\nof good and bad everywhere; and nothing but the knowing it is so, can\nemancipate one half of the world from the prepossession which it holds\nagainst the other:\u00e2\u0080\u0094that the advantage of travel, as it regarded the\n_s\u00c3\u00a7avoir vivre_, was by seeing a great deal both of men and manners; it\ntaught us mutual toleration; and mutual toleration, concluded he, making\nme a bow, taught us mutual love.\n\nThe old French officer delivered this with an air of such candour and\ngood sense, as coincided with my first favourable impressions of his\ncharacter:\u00e2\u0080\u0094I thought I loved the man; but I fear I mistook the\nobject;\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099twas my own way of thinking\u00e2\u0080\u0094the difference was, I could not have\nexpressed it half so well.\n\nIt is alike troublesome to both the rider and his beast,\u00e2\u0080\u0094if the latter\ngoes pricking up his ears, and starting all the way at every object which\nhe never saw before.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I have as little torment of this kind as any\ncreature alive; and yet I honestly confess, that many a thing gave me\npain, and that I blush\u00e2\u0080\u0099d at many a word the first month,\u00e2\u0080\u0094which I found\ninconsequent and perfectly innocent the second.\n\nMadame do Rambouliet, after an acquaintance of about six weeks with her,\nhad done me the honour to take me in her coach about two leagues out of\ntown.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Of all women, Madame de Rambouliet is the most correct; and I never\nwish to see one of more virtues and purity of heart.\u00e2\u0080\u0094In our return back,\nMadame de Rambouliet desired me to pull the cord.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I asked her if she\nwanted anything\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Rien que pour pisser_, said Madame de Rambouliet.\n\nGrieve not, gentle traveller, to let Madame de Rambouliet p\u00e2\u0080\u0094ss on.\u00e2\u0080\u0094And,\nye fair mystic nymphs! go each one _pluck your rose_, and scatter them in\nyour path,\u00e2\u0080\u0094for Madame de Rambouliet did no more.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I handed Madame de\nRambouliet out of the coach; and had I been the priest of the chaste\nCastalia, I could not have served at her fountain with a more respectful\ndecorum.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FILLE DE CHAMBRE.\nPARIS.\n\n\nWHAT the old French officer had delivered upon travelling, bringing\nPolonius\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advice to his son upon the same subject into my head,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and that\nbringing in Hamlet, and Hamlet the rest of Shakespeare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s works, I stopp\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\nat the Quai de Conti in my return home, to purchase the whole set.\n\nThe bookseller said he had not a set in the world.  _Comment_! said I,\ntaking one up out of a set which lay upon the counter betwixt us.\u00e2\u0080\u0094He said\nthey were sent him only to be got bound, and were to be sent back to\nVersailles in the morning to the Count de B\u00e2\u0080\u0094.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094And does the Count de B\u00e2\u0080\u0094, said I, read Shakespeare?  _C\u00e2\u0080\u0099est un esprit\nfort_, replied the bookseller.\u00e2\u0080\u0094He loves English books! and what is more\nto his honour, Monsieur, he loves the English too.  You speak this so\ncivilly, said I, that it is enough to oblige an Englishman to lay out a\nlouis d\u00e2\u0080\u0099or or two at your shop.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The bookseller made a bow, and was going\nto say something, when a young decent girl about twenty, who by her air\nand dress seemed to be _fille de chambre_ to some devout woman of\nfashion, come into the shop and asked for _Les Egarements du C\u00c5\u0093ur et de\nl\u00e2\u0080\u0099Esprit_: the bookseller gave her the book directly; she pulled out a\nlittle green satin purse run round with a riband of the same colour, and\nputting her finger and thumb into it, she took out the money and paid for\nit.  As I had nothing more to stay me in the shop, we both walk\u00e2\u0080\u0099d out at\nthe door together.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094And what have you to do, my dear, said I, with _The Wanderings of the\nHeart_, who scarce know yet you have one? nor, till love has first told\nyou it, or some faithless shepherd has made it ache, canst thou ever be\nsure it is so.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Le Dieu m\u00e2\u0080\u0099en garde_! said the girl.\u00e2\u0080\u0094With reason, said I,\nfor if it is a good one, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis pity it should be stolen; \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis a little\ntreasure to thee, and gives a better air to your face, than if it was\ndress\u00e2\u0080\u0099d out with pearls.\n\nThe young girl listened with a submissive attention, holding her satin\npurse by its riband in her hand all the time.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis a very small one, said\nI, taking hold of the bottom of it\u00e2\u0080\u0094she held it towards me\u00e2\u0080\u0094and there is\nvery little in it, my dear, said I; but be but as good as thou art\nhandsome, and heaven will fill it.  I had a parcel of crowns in my hand\nto pay for Shakespeare; and, as she had let go the purse entirely, I put\na single one in; and, tying up the riband in a bow-knot, returned it to\nher.\n\nThe young girl made me more a humble courtesy than a low one:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099twas one\nof those quiet, thankful sinkings, where the spirit bows itself down,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\nbody does no more than tell it.  I never gave a girl a crown in my life\nwhich gave me half the pleasure.\n\nMy advice, my dear, would not have been worth a pin to you, said I, if I\nhad not given this along with it: but now, when you see the crown, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nremember it;\u00e2\u0080\u0094so don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, my dear, lay it out in ribands.\n\nUpon my word, Sir, said the girl, earnestly, I am incapable;\u00e2\u0080\u0094in saying\nwhich, as is usual in little bargains of honour, she gave me her\nhand:\u00e2\u0080\u0094_En v\u00c3\u00a9rit\u00c3\u00a9_, _Monsieur_, _je mettrai cet argent \u00c3\u00a0part_, said she.\n\nWhen a virtuous convention is made betwixt man and woman, it sanctifies\ntheir most private walks: so, notwithstanding it was dusky, yet as both\nour roads lay the same way, we made no scruple of walking along the Quai\nde Conti together.\n\nShe made me a second courtesy in setting off, and before we got twenty\nyards from the door, as if she had not done enough before, she made a\nsort of a little stop to tell me again\u00e2\u0080\u0094she thank\u00e2\u0080\u0099d me.\n\nIt was a small tribute, I told her, which I could not avoid paying to\nvirtue, and would not be mistaken in the person I had been rendering it\nto for the world;\u00e2\u0080\u0094but I see innocence, my dear, in your face,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and foul\nbefall the man who ever lays a snare in its way!\n\nThe girl seem\u00e2\u0080\u0099d affected some way or other with what I said;\u00e2\u0080\u0094she gave a\nlow sigh:\u00e2\u0080\u0094I found I was not empowered to enquire at all after it,\u00e2\u0080\u0094so said\nnothing more till I got to the corner of the Rue de Nevers, where, we\nwere to part.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094But is this the way, my dear, said I, to the Hotel de Modene?  She told\nme it was;\u00e2\u0080\u0094or that I might go by the Rue de Gueneguault, which was the\nnext turn.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Then I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go, my dear, by the Rue de Gueneguault, said I, for\ntwo reasons; first, I shall please myself, and next, I shall give you the\nprotection of my company as far on your way as I can.  The girl was\nsensible I was civil\u00e2\u0080\u0094and said, she wished the Hotel de Modene was in the\nRue de St. Pierre.\u00e2\u0080\u0094You live there? said I.\u00e2\u0080\u0094She told me she was _fille de\nchambre_ to Madame R\u00e2\u0080\u0094.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Good God! said I, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis the very lady for whom I\nhave brought a letter from Amiens.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The girl told me that Madame R\u00e2\u0080\u0094, she\nbelieved, expected a stranger with a letter, and was impatient to see\nhim:\u00e2\u0080\u0094so I desired the girl to present my compliments to Madame R\u00e2\u0080\u0094, and\nsay, I would certainly wait upon her in the morning.\n\nWe stood still at the corner of the Rue de Nevers whilst this pass\u00e2\u0080\u0099d.\u00e2\u0080\u0094We\nthen stopped a moment whilst she disposed of her _Egarements du C\u00c5\u0093ur_,\n&c. more commodiously than carrying them in her hand\u00e2\u0080\u0094they were two\nvolumes: so I held the second for her whilst she put the first into her\npocket; and then she held her pocket, and I put in the other after it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis sweet to feel by what fine spun threads our affections are drawn\ntogether.\n\nWe set off afresh, and as she took her third step, the girl put her hand\nwithin my arm.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I was just bidding her,\u00e2\u0080\u0094but she did it of herself, with\nthat undeliberating simplicity, which show\u00e2\u0080\u0099d it was out of her head that\nshe had never seen me before.  For my own part, I felt the conviction of\nconsanguinity so strongly, that I could not help turning half round to\nlook in her face, and see if I could trace out any thing in it of a\nfamily likeness.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Tut! said I, are we not all relations?\n\nWhen we arrived at the turning up of the Rue de Gueneguault, I stopp\u00e2\u0080\u0099d to\nbid her adieu for good and all: the girl would thank me again for my\ncompany and kindness.\u00e2\u0080\u0094She bid me adieu twice.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I repeated it as often; and\nso cordial was the parting between us, that had it happened any where\nelse, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure but I should have signed it with a kiss of charity, as\nwarm and holy as an apostle.\n\nBut in Paris, as none kiss each other but the men,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I did, what amounted\nto the same thing\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094I bid God bless her.\n\n\n\n\nTHE PASSPORT.\nPARIS.\n\n\nWHEN I got home to my hotel, La Fleur told me I had been enquired after\nby the Lieutenant de Police.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The deuce take it! said I,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I know the\nreason.  It is time the reader should know it, for in the order of things\nin which it happened, it was omitted: not that it was out of my head; but\nthat had I told it then it might have been forgotten now;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and now is the\ntime I want it.\n\nI had left London with so much precipitation, that it never enter\u00e2\u0080\u0099d my\nmind that we were at war with France; and had reached Dover, and looked\nthrough my glass at the hills beyond Boulogne, before the idea presented\nitself; and with this in its train, that there was no getting there\nwithout a passport.  Go but to the end of a street, I have a mortal\naversion for returning back no wiser than I set out; and as this was one\nof the greatest efforts I had ever made for knowledge, I could less bear\nthe thoughts of it: so hearing the Count de\u00e2\u0080\u0094had hired the packet, I\nbegg\u00e2\u0080\u0099d he would take me in his suite.  The Count had some little\nknowledge of me, so made little or no difficulty,\u00e2\u0080\u0094only said, his\ninclination to serve me could reach no farther than Calais, as he was to\nreturn by way of Brussels to Paris; however, when I had once pass\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\nthere, I might get to Paris without interruption; but that in Paris I\nmust make friends and shift for myself.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Let me get to Paris, Monsieur le\nCount, said I,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I shall do very well.  So I embark\u00e2\u0080\u0099d, and never\nthought more of the matter.\n\nWhen La Fleur told me the Lieutenant de Police had been enquiring after\nme,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the thing instantly recurred;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and by the time La Fleur had well told\nme, the master of the hotel came into my room to tell me the same thing,\nwith this addition to it, that my passport had been particularly asked\nafter: the master of the hotel concluded with saying, He hoped I had\none.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Not I, faith! said I.\n\nThe master of the hotel retired three steps from me, as from an infected\nperson, as I declared this;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and poor La Fleur advanced three steps\ntowards me, and with that sort of movement which a good soul makes to\nsuccour a distress\u00e2\u0080\u0099d one:\u00e2\u0080\u0094the fellow won my heart by it; and from that\nsingle trait I knew his character as perfectly, and could rely upon it as\nfirmly, as if he had served me with fidelity for seven years.\n\n_Mon seigneur_! cried the master of the hotel; but recollecting himself\nas he made the exclamation, he instantly changed the tone of it.\u00e2\u0080\u0094If\nMonsieur, said he, has not a passport (_apparemment_) in all likelihood\nhe has friends in Paris who can procure him one.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Not that I know of,\nquoth I, with an air of indifference.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Then _certes_, replied he, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nbe sent to the Bastile or the Chatelet _au moins_.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Poo! said I, the King\nof France is a good natur\u00e2\u0080\u0099d soul:\u00e2\u0080\u0094he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll hurt nobody.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Cela n\u00e2\u0080\u0099emp\u00c3\u00aache\npas_, said he\u00e2\u0080\u0094you will certainly be sent to the Bastile to-morrow\nmorning.\u00e2\u0080\u0094But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken your lodgings for a month, answer\u00e2\u0080\u0099d I, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nnot quit them a day before the time for all the kings of France in the\nworld.  La Fleur whispered in my ear, That nobody could oppose the king\nof France.\n\n_Pardi_! said my host, _ces Messieurs Anglois sont des gens tr\u00c3\u00a8s\nextraordinaires_;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, having both said and sworn it,\u00e2\u0080\u0094he went out.\n\n\n\n\nTHE PASSPORT.\nTHE HOTEL AT PARIS.\n\n\nI COULD not find in my heart to torture La Fleur\u00e2\u0080\u0099s with a serious look\nupon the subject of my embarrassment, which was the reason I had treated\nit so cavalierly: and to show him how light it lay upon my mind, I dropt\nthe subject entirely; and whilst he waited upon me at supper, talk\u00e2\u0080\u0099d to\nhim with more than usual gaiety about Paris, and of the Op\u00c3\u00a9ra Comique.\u00e2\u0080\u0094La\nFleur had been there himself, and had followed me through the streets as\nfar as the bookseller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shop; but seeing me come out with the young\n_fille de chambre_, and that we walk\u00e2\u0080\u0099d down the Quai de Conti together,\nLa Fleur deem\u00e2\u0080\u0099d it unnecessary to follow me a step further;\u00e2\u0080\u0094so making his\nown reflections upon it, he took a shorter cut,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and got to the hotel in\ntime to be inform\u00e2\u0080\u0099d of the affair of the police against my arrival.\n\nAs soon as the honest creature had taken away, and gone down to sup\nhimself, I then began to think a little seriously about my situation.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094And here, I know, Eugenius, thou wilt smile at the remembrance of a\nshort dialogue which passed betwixt us the moment I was going to set\nout:\u00e2\u0080\u0094I must tell it here.\n\nEugenius, knowing that I was as little subject to be overburden\u00e2\u0080\u0099d with\nmoney as thought, had drawn me aside to interrogate me how much I had\ntaken care for.  Upon telling him the exact sum, Eugenius shook his head,\nand said it would not do; so pull\u00e2\u0080\u0099d out his purse in order to empty it\ninto mine.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve enough in conscience, Eugenius, said I.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Indeed, Yorick,\nyou have not, replied Eugenius; I know France and Italy better than\nyou.\u00e2\u0080\u0094But you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t consider, Eugenius, said I, refusing his offer, that\nbefore I have been three days in Paris, I shall take care to say or do\nsomething or other for which I shall get clapp\u00e2\u0080\u0099d up into the Bastile, and\nthat I shall live there a couple of months entirely at the king of\nFrance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expense.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I beg pardon, said Eugenius drily: really I had forgot\nthat resource.\n\nNow the event I treated gaily came seriously to my door.\n\nIs it folly, or nonchalance, or philosophy, or pertinacity\u00e2\u0080\u0094or what is it\nin me, that, after all, when La Fleur had gone down stairs, and I was\nquite alone, I could not bring down my mind to think of it otherwise than\nI had then spoken of it to Eugenius?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094And as for the Bastile; the terror is in the word.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Make the most of it\nyou can, said I to myself, the Bastile is but another word for a\ntower;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and a tower is but another word for a house you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get out\nof.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Mercy on the gouty! for they are in it twice a year.\u00e2\u0080\u0094But with nine\nlivres a day, and pen and ink, and paper, and patience, albeit a man\ncan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get out, he may do very well within,\u00e2\u0080\u0094at least for a mouth or six\nweeks; at the end of which, if he is a harmless fellow, his innocence\nappears, and he comes out a better and wiser man than he went in.\n\nI had some occasion (I forget what) to step into the court-yard, as I\nsettled this account; and remember I walk\u00e2\u0080\u0099d down stairs in no small\ntriumph with the conceit of my reasoning.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Beshrew the sombre pencil! said\nI, vauntingly\u00e2\u0080\u0094for I envy not its powers, which paints the evils of life\nwith so hard and deadly a colouring.  The mind sits terrified at the\nobjects she has magnified herself, and blackened: reduce them to their\nproper size and hue, she overlooks them.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis true, said I, correcting\nthe proposition,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Bastile is not an evil to be despised;\u00e2\u0080\u0094but strip it\nof its towers\u00e2\u0080\u0094fill up the fosse,\u00e2\u0080\u0094unbarricade the doors\u00e2\u0080\u0094call it simply a\nconfinement, and suppose \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis some tyrant of a distemper\u00e2\u0080\u0094and not of a\nman, which holds you in it,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the evil vanishes, and you bear the other\nhalf without complaint.\n\nI was interrupted in the heyday of this soliloquy, with a voice which I\ntook to be of a child, which complained \u00e2\u0080\u009cit could not get out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094I look\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\nup and down the passage, and seeing neither man, woman, nor child, I went\nout without farther attention.\n\nIn my return back through the passage, I heard the same words repeated\ntwice over; and, looking up, I saw it was a starling hung in a little\ncage.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get out,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the starling.\n\nI stood looking at the bird: and to every person who came through the\npassage it ran fluttering to the side towards which they approach\u00e2\u0080\u0099d it,\nwith the same lamentation of its captivity.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nstarling.\u00e2\u0080\u0094God help thee! said I, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll let thee out, cost what it\nwill; so I turned about the cage to get to the door: it was twisted and\ndouble twisted so fast with wire, there was no getting it open without\npulling the cage to pieces.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I took both hands to it.\n\nThe bird flew to the place where I was attempting his deliverance, and\nthrusting his head through the trellis pressed his breast against it as\nif impatient.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I fear, poor creature! said I, I cannot set thee at\nliberty.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the starling,\u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get out\u00e2\u0080\u0094I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsaid the starling.\n\nI vow I never had my affections more tenderly awakened; nor do I remember\nan incident in my life, where the dissipated spirits, to which my reason\nhad been a bubble, were so suddenly call\u00e2\u0080\u0099d home.  Mechanical as the notes\nwere, yet so true in tune to nature were they chanted, that in one moment\nthey overthrew all my systematic reasonings upon the Bastile; and I\nheavily walked upstairs, unsaying every word I had said in going down\nthem.\n\nDisguise thyself as thou wilt, still, Slavery! said I,\u00e2\u0080\u0094still thou art a\nbitter draught! and though thousands in all ages have been made to drink\nof thee, thou art no less bitter on that account.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis thou, thrice sweet\nand gracious goddess, addressing myself to Liberty, whom all in public or\nin private worship, whose taste is grateful, and ever will be so, till\nNature herself shall change.\u00e2\u0080\u0094No _tint_ of words can spot thy snowy\nmantle, or chymic power turn thy sceptre into iron:\u00e2\u0080\u0094with thee to smile\nupon him as he eats his crust, the swain is happier than his monarch,\nfrom whose court thou art exiled!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Gracious Heaven! cried I, kneeling down\nupon the last step but one in my ascent, grant me but health, thou great\nBestower of it, and give me but this fair goddess as my companion,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and\nshower down thy mitres, if it seems good unto thy divine providence, upon\nthose heads which are aching for them!\n\n\n\n\nTHE CAPTIVE.\nPARIS.\n\n\nTHE bird in his cage pursued me into my room; I sat down close to my\ntable, and leaning my head upon my hand, I began to figure to myself the\nmiseries of confinement.  I was in a right frame for it, and so I gave\nfull scope to my imagination.\n\nI was going to begin with the millions of my fellow-creatures born to no\ninheritance but slavery: but finding, however affecting the picture was,\nthat I could not bring it near me, and that the multitude of sad groups\nin it did but distract me.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094I took a single captive, and having first shut him up in his dungeon, I\nthen look\u00e2\u0080\u0099d through the twilight of his grated door to take his picture.\n\nI beheld his body half-wasted away with long expectation and confinement,\nand felt what kind of sickness of the heart it was which arises from hope\ndeferr\u00e2\u0080\u0099d.  Upon looking nearer I saw him pale and feverish: in thirty\nyears the western breeze had not once fann\u00e2\u0080\u0099d his blood;\u00e2\u0080\u0094he had seen no\nsun, no moon, in all that time\u00e2\u0080\u0094nor had the voice of friend or kinsman\nbreathed through his lattice.\u00e2\u0080\u0094His children\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nBut here my heart began to bleed\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I was forced to go on with another\npart of the portrait.\n\nHe was sitting upon the ground upon a little straw, in the furthest\ncorner of his dungeon, which was alternately his chair and bed: a little\ncalendar of small sticks were laid at the head, notch\u00e2\u0080\u0099d all over with the\ndismal days and nights he had passed there;\u00e2\u0080\u0094he had one of these little\nsticks in his hand, and, with a rusty nail he was etching another day of\nmisery to add to the heap.  As I darkened the little light he had, he\nlifted up a hopeless eye towards the door, then cast it down,\u00e2\u0080\u0094shook his\nhead, and went on with his work of affliction.  I heard his chains upon\nhis legs, as he turned his body to lay his little stick upon the\nbundle.\u00e2\u0080\u0094He gave a deep sigh.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I saw the iron enter into his soul!\u00e2\u0080\u0094I burst\ninto tears.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I could not sustain the picture of confinement which my fancy\nhad drawn.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I started up from my chair, and calling La Fleur: I bid him\nbespeak me a remise, and have it ready at the door of the hotel by nine\nin the morning.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go directly, said I, myself to Monsieur le Duc de Choiseul.\n\nLa Fleur would have put me to bed; but\u00e2\u0080\u0094not willing he should see anything\nupon my cheek which would cost the honest fellow a heart-ache,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I told him\nI would go to bed by myself,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and bid him go do the same.\n\n\n\n\nTHE STARLING.\nROAD TO VERSAILLES.\n\n\nI GOT into my remise the hour I proposed: La Fleur got up behind, and I\nbid the coachman make the best of his way to Versailles.\n\nAs there was nothing in this road, or rather nothing which I look for in\ntravelling, I cannot fill up the blank better than with a short history\nof this self-same bird, which became the subject of the last chapter.\n\nWhilst the Honourable Mr. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 was waiting for a wind at Dover, it had been\ncaught upon the cliffs, before it could well fly, by an English lad who\nwas his groom; who, not caring to destroy it, had taken it in his breast\ninto the packet;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, by course of feeding it, and taking it once under\nhis protection, in a day or two grew fond of it, and got it safe along\nwith him to Paris.\n\nAt Paris the lad had laid out a livre in a little cage for the starling,\nand as he had little to do better the five months his master staid there,\nhe taught it, in his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tongue, the four simple words\u00e2\u0080\u0094(and no\nmore)\u00e2\u0080\u0094to which I own\u00e2\u0080\u0099d myself so much its debtor.\n\nUpon his master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on for Italy, the lad had given it to the master\nof the hotel.  But his little song for liberty being in an _unknown_\nlanguage at Paris, the bird had little or no store set by him: so La\nFleur bought both him and his cage for me for a bottle of Burgundy.\n\nIn my return from Italy I brought him with me to the country in whose\nlanguage he had learned his notes; and telling the story of him to Lord\nA\u00e2\u0080\u0094, Lord A\u00e2\u0080\u0094 begg\u00e2\u0080\u0099d the bird of me;\u00e2\u0080\u0094in a week Lord A\u00e2\u0080\u0094 gave him to Lord B\u00e2\u0080\u0094;\nLord B\u00e2\u0080\u0094 made a present of him to Lord C\u00e2\u0080\u0094; and Lord C\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gentleman sold\nhim to Lord D\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099s for a shilling; Lord D\u00e2\u0080\u0094 gave him to Lord E\u00e2\u0080\u0094; and so\non\u00e2\u0080\u0094half round the alphabet.  From that rank he pass\u00e2\u0080\u0099d into the lower\nhouse, and pass\u00e2\u0080\u0099d the hands of as many commoners.  But as all these\nwanted to _get in_, and my bird wanted to _get out_, he had almost as\nlittle store set by him in London as in Paris.\n\nIt is impossible but many of my readers must have heard of him; and if\nany by mere chance have ever seen him, I beg leave to inform them, that\nthat bird was my bird, or some vile copy set up to represent him.\n\n[Picture: The starling as the crest of arms] I have nothing farther to\nadd upon him, but that from that time to this I have borne this poor\nstarling as the crest to my arms.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Thus:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094And let the herald\u00e2\u0080\u0099s officers twist his neck about if they dare.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ADDRESS.\nVERSAILLES.\n\n\nI SHOULD not like to have my enemy take a view of my mind when I am going\nto ask protection of any man; for which reason I generally endeavour to\nprotect myself; but this going to Monsieur le Duc de C\u00e2\u0080\u0094 was an act of\ncompulsion; had it been an act of choice, I should have done it, I\nsuppose, like other people.\n\nHow many mean plans of dirty address, as I went along, did my servile\nheart form!  I deserved the Bastile for every one of them.\n\nThen nothing would serve me when I got within sight of Versailles, but\nputting words and sentences together, and conceiving attitudes and tones\nto wreath myself into Monsieur le Duc de C\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good graces.\u00e2\u0080\u0094This will do,\nsaid I.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Just as well, retorted I again, as a coat carried up to him by an\nadventurous tailor, without taking his measure.  Fool! continued I,\u00e2\u0080\u0094see\nMonsieur le Duc\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face first;\u00e2\u0080\u0094observe what character is written in\nit;\u00e2\u0080\u0094take notice in what posture he stands to hear you;\u00e2\u0080\u0094mark the turns and\nexpressions of his body and limbs;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and for the tone,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the first sound\nwhich comes from his lips will give it you; and from all these together\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll compound an address at once upon the spot, which cannot disgust\nthe Duke;\u00e2\u0080\u0094the ingredients are his own, and most likely to go down.\n\nWell! said I, I wish it well over.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Coward again! as if man to man was not\nequal throughout the whole surface of the globe; and if in the field\u00e2\u0080\u0094why\nnot face to face in the cabinet too?  And trust me, Yorick, whenever it\nis not so, man is false to himself and betrays his own succours ten times\nwhere nature does it once.  Go to the Duc de C\u00e2\u0080\u0094 with the Bastile in thy\nlooks;\u00e2\u0080\u0094my life for it, thou wilt be sent back to Paris in half an hour\nwith an escort.\n\nI believe so, said I.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Then I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go to the Duke, by heaven! with all the\ngaiety and debonairness in the world.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094And there you are wrong again, replied I.\u00e2\u0080\u0094A heart at ease, Yorick, flies\ninto no extremes\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099tis ever on its centre.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Well! well! cried I, as the\ncoachman turn\u00e2\u0080\u0099d in at the gates, I find I shall do very well: and by the\ntime he had wheel\u00e2\u0080\u0099d round the court, and brought me up to the door, I\nfound myself so much the better for my own lecture, that I neither\nascended the steps like a victim to justice, who was to part with life\nupon the top most,\u00e2\u0080\u0094nor did I mount them with a skip and a couple of\nstrides, as I do when I fly up, Eliza! to thee to meet it.\n\nAs I entered the door of the saloon I was met by a person, who possibly\nmight be the _ma\u00c3\u00aetre d\u00e2\u0080\u0099h\u00c3\u00b4tel_, but had more the air of one of the under\nsecretaries, who told me the Duc de C\u00e2\u0080\u0094 was busy.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I am utterly ignorant,\nsaid I, of the forms of obtaining an audience, being an absolute\nstranger, and what is worse in the present conjuncture of affairs, being\nan Englishman too.\u00e2\u0080\u0094He replied, that did not increase the difficulty.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\nmade him a slight bow, and told him, I had something of importance to say\nto Monsieur le Duc.  The secretary look\u00e2\u0080\u0099d towards the stairs, as if he\nwas about to leave me to carry up this account to some one.\u00e2\u0080\u0094But I must\nnot mislead you, said I,\u00e2\u0080\u0094for what I have to say is of no manner of\nimportance to Monsieur le Duc de C\u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u0094but of great importance to\nmyself.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_C\u00e2\u0080\u0099est une autre affaire_, replied he.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Not at all, said I, to a\nman of gallantry.\u00e2\u0080\u0094But pray, good sir, continued I, when can a stranger\nhope to have access?\u00e2\u0080\u0094In not less than two hours, said he, looking at his\nwatch.  The number of equipages in the court-yard seemed to justify the\ncalculation, that I could have no nearer a prospect;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and as walking\nbackwards and forwards in the saloon, without a soul to commune with, was\nfor the time as bad as being in the Bastile itself, I instantly went back\nto my remise, and bid the coachman drive me to the _Cordon Bleu_, which\nwas the nearest hotel.\n\nI think there is a fatality in it;\u00e2\u0080\u0094I seldom go to the place I set out\nfor.\n\n\n\n\nLE PATISSIER.\nVERSAILLES.\n\n\nBEFORE I had got half way down the street I changed my mind: as I am at\nVersailles, thought I, I might as well take a view of the town; so I\npull\u00e2\u0080\u0099d the cord, and ordered the coachman to drive round some of the\nprincipal streets.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I suppose the town is not very large, said I.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The\ncoachman begg\u00e2\u0080\u0099d pardon for setting me right, and told me it was very\nsuperb, and that numbers of the first dukes and marquises and counts had\nhotels.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The Count de B\u00e2\u0080\u0094, of whom the bookseller at the Quai de Conti had\nspoke so handsomely the night before, came instantly into my mind.\u00e2\u0080\u0094And\nwhy should I not go, thought I, to the Count de B\u00e2\u0080\u0094, who has so high an\nidea of English books and English men\u00e2\u0080\u0094and tell him my story? so I changed\nmy mind a second time.\u00e2\u0080\u0094In truth it was the third; for I had intended that\nday for Madame de R\u00e2\u0080\u0094, in the Rue St. Pierre, and had devoutly sent her\nword by her _fille de chambre_ that I would assuredly wait upon her;\u00e2\u0080\u0094but\nI am governed by circumstances;\u00e2\u0080\u0094I cannot govern them: so seeing a man\nstanding with a basket on the other side of the street, as if he had\nsomething to sell, I bid La Fleur go up to him, and enquire for the\nCount\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel.\n\nLa Fleur returned a little pale; and told me it was a Chevalier de St.\nLouis selling p\u00c3\u00a2t\u00c3\u00a9s.\u00e2\u0080\u0094It is impossible, La Fleur, said I.\u00e2\u0080\u0094La Fleur could\nno more account for the phenomenon than myself; but persisted in his\nstory: he had seen the croix set in gold, with its red riband, he said,\ntied to his buttonhole\u00e2\u0080\u0094and had looked into the basket and seen the p\u00c3\u00a2t\u00c3\u00a9s\nwhich the Chevalier was selling; so could not be mistaken in that.\n\nSuch a reverse in man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life awakens a better principle than curiosity: I\ncould not help looking for some time at him as I sat in the remise:\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\nmore I look\u00e2\u0080\u0099d at him, his croix, and his basket, the stronger they wove\nthemselves into my brain.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I got out of the remise, and went towards him.\n\nHe was begirt with a clean linen apron which fell below his knees, and\nwith a sort of a bib that went half way up his breast; upon the top of\nthis, but a little below the hem, hung his croix.  His basket of little\np\u00c3\u00a2t\u00c3\u00a9s was covered over with a white damask napkin; another of the same\nkind was spread at the bottom; and there was a look of _propret\u00c3\u00a9_ and\nneatness throughout, that one might have bought his p\u00c3\u00a2t\u00c3\u00a9s of him, as much\nfrom appetite as sentiment.\n\nHe made an offer of them to neither; but stood still with them at the\ncorner of an hotel, for those to buy who chose it without solicitation.\n\nHe was about forty-eight;\u00e2\u0080\u0094of a sedate look, something approaching to\ngravity.  I did not wonder.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I went up rather to the basket than him, and\nhaving lifted up the napkin, and taking one of his p\u00c3\u00a2t\u00c3\u00a9s into my hand,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\nbegg\u00e2\u0080\u0099d he would explain the appearance which affected me.\n\nHe told me in a few words, that the best part of his life had passed in\nthe service, in which, after spending a small patrimony, he had obtained\na company and the croix with it; but that, at the conclusion of the last\npeace, his regiment being reformed, and the whole corps, with those of\nsome other regiments, left without any provision, he found himself in a\nwide world without friends, without a livre,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and indeed, said he, without\nanything but this,\u00e2\u0080\u0094(pointing, as he said it, to his croix).\u00e2\u0080\u0094The poor\nChevalier won my pity, and he finished the scene with winning my esteem\ntoo.\n\nThe king, he said, was the most generous of princes, but his generosity\ncould neither relieve nor reward everyone, and it was only his misfortune\nto be amongst the number.  He had a little wife, he said, whom he loved,\nwho did the _p\u00c3\u00a2tisserie_; and added, he felt no dishonour in defending\nher and himself from want in this way\u00e2\u0080\u0094unless Providence had offer\u00e2\u0080\u0099d him a\nbetter.\n\nIt would be wicked to withhold a pleasure from the good, in passing over\nwhat happen\u00e2\u0080\u0099d to this poor Chevalier of St. Louis about nine months\nafter.\n\nIt seems he usually took his stand near the iron gates which lead up to\nthe palace, and as his croix had caught the eyes of numbers, numbers had\nmade the same enquiry which I had done.\u00e2\u0080\u0094He had told them the same story,\nand always with so much modesty and good sense, that it had reach\u00e2\u0080\u0099d at\nlast the king\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ears;\u00e2\u0080\u0094who, hearing the Chevalier had been a gallant\nofficer, and respected by the whole regiment as a man of honour and\nintegrity,\u00e2\u0080\u0094he broke up his little trade by a pension of fifteen hundred\nlivres a year.\n\nAs I have told this to please the reader, I beg he will allow me to\nrelate another, out of its order, to please myself:\u00e2\u0080\u0094the two stories\nreflect light upon each other,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis a pity they should be parted.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SWORD.\nRENNES.\n\n\nWHEN states and empires have their periods of declension, and feel in\ntheir turns what distress and poverty is,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I stop not to tell the causes\nwhich gradually brought the house d\u00e2\u0080\u0099E\u00e2\u0080\u0094, in Brittany, into decay.  The\nMarquis d\u00e2\u0080\u0099E\u00e2\u0080\u0094 had fought up against his condition with great firmness;\nwishing to preserve, and still show to the world, some little fragments\nof what his ancestors had been;\u00e2\u0080\u0094their indiscretions had put it out of his\npower.  There was enough left for the little exigencies of\n_obscurity_.\u00e2\u0080\u0094But he had two boys who looked up to him for _light_;\u00e2\u0080\u0094he\nthought they deserved it.  He had tried his sword\u00e2\u0080\u0094it could not open the\nway,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the _mounting_ was too expensive,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and simple economy was not a match\nfor it:\u00e2\u0080\u0094there was no resource but commerce.\n\nIn any other province in France, save Brittany, this was smiting the root\nfor ever of the little tree his pride and affection wish\u00e2\u0080\u0099d to see\nre-blossom.\u00e2\u0080\u0094But in Brittany, there being a provision for this, he avail\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\nhimself of it; and, taking an occasion when the states were assembled at\nRennes, the Marquis, attended with his two boys, entered the court; and\nhaving pleaded the right of an ancient law of the duchy, which, though\nseldom claim\u00e2\u0080\u0099d, he said, was no less in force, he took his sword from his\nside:\u00e2\u0080\u0094Here, said he, take it; and be trusty guardians of it, till better\ntimes put me in condition to reclaim it.\n\nThe president accepted the Marquis\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sword: he staid a few minutes to see\nit deposited in the archives of his house\u00e2\u0080\u0094and departed.\n\nThe Marquis and his whole family embarked the next day for Martinico,\nand in about nineteen or twenty years of successful application to\nbusiness, with some unlook\u00e2\u0080\u0099d for bequests from distant branches of his\nhouse, return home to reclaim his nobility, and to support it.\n\nIt was an incident of good fortune which will never happen to any\ntraveller but a Sentimental one, that I should be at Rennes at the very\ntime of this solemn requisition: I call it solemn;\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was so to me.\n\nThe Marquis entered the court with his whole family: he supported his\nlady,\u00e2\u0080\u0094his eldest son supported his sister, and his youngest was at the\nother extreme of the line next his mother;\u00e2\u0080\u0094he put his handkerchief to his\nface twice.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094There was a dead silence.  When the Marquis had approached within six\npaces of the tribunal, he gave the Marchioness to his youngest son, and\nadvancing three steps before his family,\u00e2\u0080\u0094he reclaim\u00e2\u0080\u0099d his sword.  His\nsword was given him, and the moment he got it into his hand he drew it\nalmost out of the scabbard:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099twas the shining face of a friend he had\nonce given up\u00e2\u0080\u0094he look\u00e2\u0080\u0099d attentively along it, beginning at the hilt, as\nif to see whether it was the same,\u00e2\u0080\u0094when, observing a little rust which it\nhad contracted near the point, he brought it near his eye, and bending\nhis head down over it,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I think\u00e2\u0080\u0094I saw a tear fall upon the place.  I could\nnot be deceived by what followed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall find,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009csome _other way_ to get it off.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen the Marquis had said this, he returned his sword into its scabbard,\nmade a bow to the guardians of it,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, with his wife and daughter, and\nhis two sons following him, walk\u00e2\u0080\u0099d out.\n\nO, how I envied him his feelings!\n\n\n\n\nTHE PASSPORT.\nVERSAILLES.\n\n\nI FOUND no difficulty in getting admittance to Monsieur le Count de B\u00e2\u0080\u0094.\nThe set of Shakespeares was laid upon the table, and he was tumbling them\nover.  I walk\u00e2\u0080\u0099d up close to the table, and giving first such a look at\nthe books as to make him conceive I knew what they were,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I told him I had\ncome without any one to present me, knowing I should meet with a friend\nin his apartment, who, I trusted, would do it for me:\u00e2\u0080\u0094it is my\ncountryman, the great Shakespeare, said I, pointing to his works\u00e2\u0080\u0094_et ayez\nla bout\u00c3\u00a9_, _mon cher ami_, apostrophizing his spirit, added I, _de me\nfaire cet honneur-l\u00c3\u00a0_.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nThe Count smiled at the singularity of the introduction; and seeing I\nlook\u00e2\u0080\u0099d a little pale and sickly, insisted upon my taking an arm-chair; so\nI sat down; and to save him conjectures upon a visit so out of all rule,\nI told him simply of the incident in the bookseller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shop, and how that\nhad impelled me rather to go to him with the story of a little\nembarrassment I was under, than to any other man in France.\u00e2\u0080\u0094And what is\nyour embarrassment? let me hear it, said the Count.  So I told him the\nstory just as I have told it the reader.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094And the master of my hotel, said I, as I concluded it, will needs have\nit, Monsieur le Count, that I shall be sent to the Bastile;\u00e2\u0080\u0094but I have no\napprehensions, continued I;\u00e2\u0080\u0094for, in falling into the hands of the most\npolish\u00e2\u0080\u0099d people in the world, and being conscious I was a true man, and\nnot come to spy the nakedness of the land, I scarce thought I lay at\ntheir mercy.\u00e2\u0080\u0094It does not suit the gallantry of the French, Monsieur le\nCount, said I, to show it against invalids.\n\nAn animated blush came into the Count de B\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cheeks as I spoke this.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Ne\ncraignez rien_\u00e2\u0080\u0094Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fear, said he.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Indeed, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, replied I\nagain.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Besides, continued I, a little sportingly, I have come laughing\nall the way from London to Paris, and I do not think Monsieur le Duc de\nChoiseul is such an enemy to mirth as to send me back crying for my\npains.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094My application to you, Monsieur le Count de B\u00e2\u0080\u0094 (making him a low bow),\nis to desire he will not.\n\nThe Count heard me with great good nature, or I had not said half as\nmuch,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and once or twice said,\u00e2\u0080\u0094_C\u00e2\u0080\u0099est bien dit_.  So I rested my cause\nthere\u00e2\u0080\u0094and determined to say no more about it.\n\nThe Count led the discourse: we talk\u00e2\u0080\u0099d of indifferent things,\u00e2\u0080\u0094of books,\nand politics, and men;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and then of women.\u00e2\u0080\u0094God bless them all! said I,\nafter much discourse about them\u00e2\u0080\u0094there is not a man upon earth who loves\nthem so much as I do: after all the foibles I have seen, and all the\nsatires I have read against them, still I love them; being firmly\npersuaded that a man, who has not a sort of affection for the whole sex,\nis incapable of ever loving a single one as he ought.\n\n_Eh bien_!  _Monsieur l\u00e2\u0080\u0099Anglois_, said the Count, gaily;\u00e2\u0080\u0094you are not come\nto spy the nakedness of the land;\u00e2\u0080\u0094I believe you;\u00e2\u0080\u0094_ni encore_, I dare say,\n_that_ of our women!\u00e2\u0080\u0094But permit me to conjecture,\u00e2\u0080\u0094if, _par hazard_, they\nfell into your way, that the prospect would not affect you.\n\nI have something within me which cannot bear the shock of the least\nindecent insinuation: in the sportability of chit-chat I have often\nendeavoured to conquer it, and with infinite pain have hazarded a\nthousand things to a dozen of the sex together,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the least of which I\ncould not venture to a single one to gain heaven.\n\nExcuse me, Monsieur le Count, said I;\u00e2\u0080\u0094as for the nakedness of your land,\nif I saw it, I should cast my eyes over it with tears in them;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and for\nthat of your women (blushing at the idea he had excited in me) I am so\nevangelical in this, and have such a fellow-feeling for whatever is weak\nabout them, that I would cover it with a garment if I knew how to throw\nit on:\u00e2\u0080\u0094But I could wish, continued I, to spy the nakedness of their\nhearts, and through the different disguises of customs, climates, and\nreligion, find out what is good in them to fashion my own by:\u00e2\u0080\u0094and\ntherefore am I come.\n\nIt is for this reason, Monsieur le Count, continued I, that I have not\nseen the Palais Royal,\u00e2\u0080\u0094nor the Luxembourg,\u00e2\u0080\u0094nor the Fa\u00c3\u00a7ade of the\nLouvre,\u00e2\u0080\u0094nor have attempted to swell the catalogues we have of pictures,\nstatues, and churches.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I conceive every fair being as a temple, and would\nrather enter in, and see the original drawings and loose sketches hung up\nin it, than the Transfiguration of Raphael itself.\n\nThe thirst of this, continued I, as impatient as that which inflames the\nbreast of the connoisseur, has led me from my own home into France,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and\nfrom France will lead me through Italy;\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099tis a quiet journey of the heart\nin pursuit of Nature, and those affections which arise out of her, which\nmake us love each other,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the world, better than we do.\n\nThe Count said a great many civil things to me upon the occasion; and\nadded very politely, how much he stood obliged to Shakespeare for making\nme known to him.\u00e2\u0080\u0094But _a propos_, said he;\u00e2\u0080\u0094Shakespeare is full of great\nthings;\u00e2\u0080\u0094he forgot a small punctilio of announcing your name:\u00e2\u0080\u0094it puts you\nunder a necessity of doing it yourself.\n\n\n\n\nTHE PASSPORT.\nVERSAILLES.\n\n\nTHERE is not a more perplexing affair in life to me, than to set about\ntelling any one who I am,\u00e2\u0080\u0094for there is scarce any body I cannot give a\nbetter account of than myself; and I have often wished I could do it in a\nsingle word,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and have an end of it.  It was the only time and occasion in\nmy life I could accomplish this to any purpose;\u00e2\u0080\u0094for Shakespeare lying\nupon the table, and recollecting I was in his books, I took up Hamlet,\nand turning immediately to the grave-diggers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 scene in the fifth act, I\nlaid my finger upon Yorick, and advancing the book to the Count, with my\nfinger all the way over the name,\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Me voici_! said I.\n\nNow, whether the idea of poor Yorick\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skull was put out of the Count\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nmind by the reality of my own, or by what magic he could drop a period of\nseven or eight hundred years, makes nothing in this account;\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099tis certain\nthe French conceive better than they combine;\u00e2\u0080\u0094I wonder at nothing in this\nworld, and the less at this; inasmuch as one of the first of our own\nChurch, for whose candour and paternal sentiments I have the highest\nveneration, fell into the same mistake in the very same case:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe could\nnot bear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto look into the sermons wrote by the King of\nDenmark\u00e2\u0080\u0099s jester.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Good, my Lord said I; but there are two Yoricks.  The\nYorick your Lordship thinks of, has been dead and buried eight hundred\nyears ago; he flourished in Horwendillus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s court;\u00e2\u0080\u0094the other Yorick is\nmyself, who have flourished, my Lord, in no court.\u00e2\u0080\u0094He shook his head.\nGood God! said I, you might as well confound Alexander the Great with\nAlexander the Coppersmith, my lord!\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Twas all one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094If Alexander, King of Macedon, could have translated your Lordship, said\nI, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure your Lordship would not have said so.\n\nThe poor Count de B\u00e2\u0080\u0094 fell but into the same _error_.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Et_, _Monsieur_, _est-il Yorick_? cried the Count.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Je le suis_, said\nI.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Vous_?\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Moi_,\u00e2\u0080\u0094_moi qui ai l\u00e2\u0080\u0099honneur de vous parler_, _Monsieur le\nComte_.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Mon Dieu_! said he, embracing me,\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Vous \u00c3\u00aates Yorick_!\n\nThe Count instantly put the Shakespeare into his pocket, and left me\nalone in his room.\n\n\n\n\nTHE PASSPORT.\nVERSAILLES.\n\n\nI COULD not conceive why the Count de B\u00e2\u0080\u0094 had gone so abruptly out of the\nroom, any more than I could conceive why he had put the Shakespeare into\nhis pocket.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Mysteries which must explain themselves are not worth the\nloss of time which a conjecture about them takes up_: \u00e2\u0080\u0099twas better to\nread Shakespeare; so taking up \u00e2\u0080\u009c_Much Ado About Nothing_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I transported\nmyself instantly from the chair I sat in to Messina in Sicily, and got so\nbusy with Don Pedro, and Benedict, and Beatrice, that I thought not of\nVersailles, the Count, or the passport.\n\nSweet pliability of man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spirit, that can at once surrender itself to\nillusions, which cheat expectation and sorrow of their weary\nmoments!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Long,\u00e2\u0080\u0094long since had ye number\u00e2\u0080\u0099d out my days, had I not trod so\ngreat a part of them upon this enchanted ground.  When my way is too\nrough for my feet, or too steep for my strength, I get off it, to some\nsmooth velvet path, which Fancy has scattered over with rosebuds of\ndelights; and having taken a few turns in it, come back strengthened and\nrefresh\u00e2\u0080\u0099d.\u00e2\u0080\u0094When evils press sore upon me, and there is no retreat from\nthem in this world, then I take a new course;\u00e2\u0080\u0094I leave it,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and as I have a\nclearer idea of the Elysian fields than I have of heaven, I force myself,\nlike \u00c3\u0086neas, into them.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I see him meet the pensive shade of his forsaken\nDido, and wish to recognise it;\u00e2\u0080\u0094I see the injured spirit wave her head,\nand turn off silent from the author of her miseries and dishonours;\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\nlose the feelings for myself in hers, and in those affections which were\nwont to make me mourn for her when I was at school.\n\n_Surely this is not walking in a vain shadow\u00e2\u0080\u0094nor does man disquiet\nhimself_ in vain _by it_:\u00e2\u0080\u0094he oftener does so in trusting the issue of his\ncommotions to reason only.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I can safely say for myself, I was never able\nto conquer any one single bad sensation in my heart so decisively, as\nbeating up as fast as I could for some kindly and gentle sensation to\nfight it upon its own ground.\n\nWhen I had got to the end of the third act the Count de B\u00e2\u0080\u0094 entered, with\nmy passport in his hand.  Monsieur le Duc de C\u00e2\u0080\u0094, said the Count, is as\ngood a prophet, I dare say, as he is a statesman.  _Un homme qui rit_,\nsaid the Duke, _ne sera jamais dangereux_.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Had it been for any one but\nthe king\u00e2\u0080\u0099s jester, added the Count, I could not have got it these two\nhours.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Pardonnez moi_, Monsieur le Count, said I\u00e2\u0080\u0094I am not the king\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\njester.\u00e2\u0080\u0094But you are Yorick?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Yes.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Et vous plaisantez_?\u00e2\u0080\u0094I answered, Indeed\nI did jest,\u00e2\u0080\u0094but was not paid for it;\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099twas entirely at my own expense.\n\nWe have no jester at court, Monsieur le Count, said I; the last we had\nwas in the licentious reign of Charles II.;\u00e2\u0080\u0094since which time our manners\nhave been so gradually refining, that our court at present is so full of\npatriots, who wish for _nothing_ but the honours and wealth of their\ncountry;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and our ladies are all so chaste, so spotless, so good, so\ndevout,\u00e2\u0080\u0094there is nothing for a jester to make a jest of.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n_Voila un persiflage_! cried the Count.\n\n\n\n\nTHE PASSPORT.\nVERSAILLES.\n\n\nAS the passport was directed to all lieutenant-governors, governors, and\ncommandants of cities, generals of armies, justiciaries, and all officers\nof justice, to let Mr. Yorick the king\u00e2\u0080\u0099s jester, and his baggage, travel\nquietly along, I own the triumph of obtaining the passport was not a\nlittle tarnish\u00e2\u0080\u0099d by the figure I cut in it.\u00e2\u0080\u0094But there is nothing unmix\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\nin this world; and some of the gravest of our divines have carried it so\nfar as to affirm, that enjoyment itself was attended even with a\nsigh,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and that the greatest _they knew of_ terminated, _in a general\nway_, in little better than a convulsion.\n\nI remember the grave and learned Bevoriskius, in his Commentary upon the\nGenerations from Adam, very naturally breaks off in the middle of a note\nto give an account to the world of a couple of sparrows upon the out-edge\nof his window, which had incommoded him all the time he wrote, and at\nlast had entirely taken him off from his genealogy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis strange! writes Bevoriskius; but the facts are certain, for I have\nhad the curiosity to mark them down one by one with my pen;\u00e2\u0080\u0094but the cock\nsparrow, during the little time that I could have finished the other half\nof this note, has actually interrupted me with the reiteration of his\ncaresses three-and-twenty times and a half.\n\nHow merciful, adds Bevoriskius, is heaven to his creatures!\n\nIll fated Yorick! that the gravest of thy brethren should be able to\nwrite that to the world, which stains thy face with crimson to copy, even\nin thy study.\n\nBut this is nothing to my travels.\u00e2\u0080\u0094So I twice,\u00e2\u0080\u0094twice beg pardon for it.\n\n\n\n\nCHARACTER.\nVERSAILLES.\n\n\nAND how do you find the French? said the Count de B\u00e2\u0080\u0094, after he had given\nme the passport.\n\nThe reader may suppose, that after so obliging a proof of courtesy, I\ncould not be at a loss to say something handsome to the enquiry.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Mais passe_, _pour cela_.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Speak frankly, said he: do you find all the\nurbanity in the French which the world give us the honour of?\u00e2\u0080\u0094I had found\nevery thing, I said, which confirmed it.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Vraiment_, said the Count, _les\nFran\u00c3\u00a7ois sont polis_.\u00e2\u0080\u0094To an excess, replied I.\n\nThe Count took notice of the word _exc\u00c3\u00a8s_; and would have it I meant more\nthan I said.  I defended myself a long time as well as I could against\nit.\u00e2\u0080\u0094He insisted I had a reserve, and that I would speak my opinion\nfrankly.\n\nI believe, Monsieur le Count, said I, that man has a certain compass, as\nwell as an instrument; and that the social and other calls have occasion\nby turns for every key in him; so that if you begin a note too high or\ntoo low, there must be a want either in the upper or under part, to fill\nup the system of harmony.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The Count de B\u00e2\u0080\u0094 did not understand music, so\ndesired me to explain it some other way.  A polish\u00e2\u0080\u0099d nation, my dear\nCount, said I, makes every one its debtor: and besides, Urbanity itself,\nlike the fair sex, has so many charms, it goes against the heart to say\nit can do ill; and yet, I believe, there is but a certain line of\nperfection, that man, take him altogether, is empower\u00e2\u0080\u0099d to arrive at:\u00e2\u0080\u0094if\nhe gets beyond, he rather exchanges qualities than gets them.  I must not\npresume to say how far this has affected the French in the subject we are\nspeaking of;\u00e2\u0080\u0094but, should it ever be the case of the English, in the\nprogress of their refinements, to arrive at the same polish which\ndistinguishes the French, if we did not lose the _politesse du c\u00c5\u0093ur_,\nwhich inclines men more to humane actions than courteous ones,\u00e2\u0080\u0094we should\nat least lose that distinct variety and originality of character, which\ndistinguishes them, not only from each other, but from all the world\nbesides.\n\nI had a few of King William\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shillings, as smooth as glass, in my\npocket; and foreseeing they would be of use in the illustration of my\nhypothesis, I had got them into my hand when I had proceeded so far:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nSee, Monsieur le Count, said I, rising up, and laying them before him\nupon the table,\u00e2\u0080\u0094by jingling and rubbing one against another for seventy\nyears together in one body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pocket or another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, they are become so much\nalike, you can scarce distinguish one shilling from another.\n\nThe English, like ancient medals, kept more apart, and passing but few\npeople\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands, preserve the first sharpnesses which the fine hand of\nNature has given them;\u00e2\u0080\u0094they are not so pleasant to feel,\u00e2\u0080\u0094but in return\nthe legend is so visible, that at the first look you see whose image and\nsuperscription they bear.\u00e2\u0080\u0094But the French, Monsieur le Count, added I\n(wishing to soften what I had said), have so many excellences, they can\nthe better spare this;\u00e2\u0080\u0094they are a loyal, a gallant, a generous, an\ningenious, and good temper\u00e2\u0080\u0099d people as is under heaven;\u00e2\u0080\u0094if they have a\nfault\u00e2\u0080\u0094they are too _serious_.\n\n_Mon Dieu_! cried the Count, rising out of his chair.\n\n_Mais vous plaisantez_, said he, correcting his exclamation.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I laid my\nhand upon my breast, and with earnest gravity assured him it was my most\nsettled opinion.\n\nThe Count said he was mortified he could not stay to hear my reasons,\nbeing engaged to go that moment to dine with the Duc de C\u00e2\u0080\u0094.\n\nBut if it is not too far to come to Versailles to eat your soup with me,\nI beg, before you leave France, I may have the pleasure of knowing you\nretract your opinion,\u00e2\u0080\u0094or, in what manner you support it.\u00e2\u0080\u0094But, if you do\nsupport it, Monsieur Anglois, said he, you must do it with all your\npowers, because you have the whole world against you.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I promised the\nCount I would do myself the honour of dining with him before I set out\nfor Italy;\u00e2\u0080\u0094so took my leave.\n\n\n\n\nTHE TEMPTATION.\nPARIS.\n\n\nWHEN I alighted at the hotel, the porter told me a young woman with a\nbandbox had been that moment enquiring for me.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I do not know, said the\nporter, whether she is gone away or not.  I took the key of my chamber of\nhim, and went upstairs; and when I had got within ten steps of the top of\nthe landing before my door, I met her coming easily down.\n\nIt was the fair _fille de chambre_ I had walked along the Quai de Conti\nwith; Madame de R\u00e2\u0080\u0094 had sent her upon some commission to a _marchande des\nmodes_ within a step or two of the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Modene; and as I had fail\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\nin waiting upon her, had bid her enquire if I had left Paris; and if so,\nwhether I had not left a letter addressed to her.\n\nAs the fair _fille de chambre_ was so near my door, she returned back,\nand went into the room with me for a moment or two whilst I wrote a card.\n\nIt was a fine still evening in the latter end of the month of May,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\ncrimson window curtains (which were of the same colour as those of the\nbed) were drawn close:\u00e2\u0080\u0094the sun was setting, and reflected through them so\nwarm a tint into the fair _fille de chambre\u00e2\u0080\u0099s_ face,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I thought she\nblush\u00e2\u0080\u0099d;\u00e2\u0080\u0094the idea of it made me blush myself:\u00e2\u0080\u0094we were quite alone; and\nthat superinduced a second blush before the first could get off.\n\nThere is a sort of a pleasing half guilty blush, where the blood is more\nin fault than the man:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099tis sent impetuous from the heart, and virtue\nflies after it,\u00e2\u0080\u0094not to call it back, but to make the sensation of it more\ndelicious to the nerves:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099tis associated.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nBut I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll not describe it;\u00e2\u0080\u0094I felt something at first within me which was\nnot in strict unison with the lesson of virtue I had given her the night\nbefore.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I sought five minutes for a card;\u00e2\u0080\u0094I knew I had not one.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I took up\na pen.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I laid it down again;\u00e2\u0080\u0094my hand trembled:\u00e2\u0080\u0094the devil was in me.\n\nI know as well as any one he is an adversary, whom, if we resist, he will\nfly from us;\u00e2\u0080\u0094but I seldom resist him at all; from a terror, though I may\nconquer, I may still get a hurt in the combat;\u00e2\u0080\u0094so I give up the triumph\nfor security; and, instead of thinking to make him fly, I generally fly\nmyself.\n\nThe fair _fille de chambre_ came close up to the bureau where I was\nlooking for a card\u00e2\u0080\u0094took up first the pen I cast down, then offer\u00e2\u0080\u0099d to\nhold me the ink; she offer\u00e2\u0080\u0099d it so sweetly, I was going to accept it;\u00e2\u0080\u0094but\nI durst not;\u00e2\u0080\u0094I have nothing, my dear, said I, to write upon.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Write it,\nsaid she, simply, upon anything.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nI was just going to cry out, Then I will write it, fair girl! upon thy\nlips.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nIf I do, said I, I shall perish;\u00e2\u0080\u0094so I took her by the hand, and led her\nto the door, and begg\u00e2\u0080\u0099d she would not forget the lesson I had given\nher.\u00e2\u0080\u0094She said, indeed she would not;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, as she uttered it with some\nearnestness, she turn\u00e2\u0080\u0099d about, and gave me both her hands, closed\ntogether, into mine;\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was impossible not to compress them in that\nsituation;\u00e2\u0080\u0094I wish\u00e2\u0080\u0099d to let them go; and all the time I held them, I kept\narguing within myself against it,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and still I held them on.\u00e2\u0080\u0094In two\nminutes I found I had all the battle to fight over again;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I felt my\nlegs and every limb about me tremble at the idea.\n\nThe foot of the bed was within a yard and a half of the place where we\nwere standing.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I had still hold of her hands\u00e2\u0080\u0094and how it happened I can\ngive no account; but I neither ask\u00e2\u0080\u0099d her\u00e2\u0080\u0094nor drew her\u00e2\u0080\u0094nor did I think of\nthe bed;\u00e2\u0080\u0094but so it did happen, we both sat down.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just show you, said the fair _fille de chambre_, the little purse I\nhave been making to-day to hold your crown.  So she put her hand into her\nright pocket, which was next me, and felt for it some time\u00e2\u0080\u0094then into the\nleft.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe had lost it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094I never bore expectation more quietly;\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was in\nher right pocket at last;\u00e2\u0080\u0094she pull\u00e2\u0080\u0099d it out; it was of green taffeta,\nlined with a little bit of white quilted satin, and just big enough to\nhold the crown: she put it into my hand;\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was pretty; and I held it ten\nminutes with the back of my hand resting upon her lap\u00e2\u0080\u0094looking sometimes\nat the purse, sometimes on one side of it.\n\nA stitch or two had broke out in the gathers of my stock; the fair _fille\nde chambre_, without saying a word, took out her little housewife,\nthreaded a small needle, and sew\u00e2\u0080\u0099d it up.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I foresaw it would hazard the\nglory of the day; and, as she pass\u00e2\u0080\u0099d her hand in silence across and\nacross my neck in the man\u00c5\u0093uvre, I felt the laurels shake which fancy had\nwreath\u00e2\u0080\u0099d about my head.\n\nA strap had given way in her walk, and the buckle of her shoe was just\nfalling off.\u00e2\u0080\u0094See, said the _fille de chambre_, holding up her foot.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\ncould not, for my soul but fasten the buckle in return, and putting in\nthe strap,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and lifting up the other foot with it, when I had done, to see\nboth were right,\u00e2\u0080\u0094in doing it too suddenly, it unavoidably threw the fair\n_fille de chambre_ off her centre,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and then\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\n\n\nTHE CONQUEST.\n\n\nYES,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and then\u00e2\u0080\u0094.  Ye whose clay-cold heads and luke-warm hearts can argue\ndown or mask your passions, tell me, what trespass is it that man should\nhave them? or how his spirit stands answerable to the Father of spirits\nbut for his conduct under them?\n\nIf Nature has so wove her web of kindness, that some threads of love and\ndesire are entangled with the piece,\u00e2\u0080\u0094must the whole web be rent in\ndrawing them out?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Whip me such stoics, great Governor of Nature! said I\nto myself:\u00e2\u0080\u0094wherever thy providence shall place me for the trials of my\nvirtue;\u00e2\u0080\u0094whatever is my danger,\u00e2\u0080\u0094whatever is my situation,\u00e2\u0080\u0094let me feel the\nmovements which rise out of it, and which belong to me as a man,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, if\nI govern them as a good one, I will trust the issues to thy justice; for\nthou hast made us, and not we ourselves.\n\nAs I finished my address, I raised the fair _fille de chambre_ up by the\nhand, and led her out of the room:\u00e2\u0080\u0094she stood by me till I locked the door\nand put the key in my pocket,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and then,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the victory being quite\ndecisive\u00e2\u0080\u0094and not till then, I press\u00e2\u0080\u0099d my lips to her cheek, and taking\nher by the hand again, led her safe to the gate of the hotel.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MYSTERY.\nPARIS.\n\n\nIf a man knows the heart, he will know it was impossible to go back\ninstantly to my chamber;\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was touching a cold key with a flat third to\nit upon the close of a piece of music, which had call\u00e2\u0080\u0099d forth my\naffections:\u00e2\u0080\u0094therefore, when I let go the hand of the _fille de chambre_,\nI remained at the gate of the hotel for some time, looking at every one\nwho pass\u00e2\u0080\u0099d by,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and forming conjectures upon them, till my attention got\nfix\u00e2\u0080\u0099d upon a single object which confounded all kind of reasoning upon\nhim.\n\nIt was a tall figure of a philosophic, serious, adust look, which passed\nand repass\u00e2\u0080\u0099d sedately along the street, making a turn of about sixty\npaces on each side of the gate of the hotel;\u00e2\u0080\u0094the man was about\nfifty-two\u00e2\u0080\u0094had a small cane under his arm\u00e2\u0080\u0094was dress\u00e2\u0080\u0099d in a dark\ndrab-colour\u00e2\u0080\u0099d coat, waistcoat, and breeches, which seem\u00e2\u0080\u0099d to have seen\nsome years service:\u00e2\u0080\u0094they were still clean, and there was a little air of\nfrugal _propret\u00c3\u00a9_ throughout him.  By his pulling off his hat, and his\nattitude of accosting a good many in his way, I saw he was asking\ncharity: so I got a sous or two out of my pocket ready to give him, as he\ntook me in his turn.\u00e2\u0080\u0094He pass\u00e2\u0080\u0099d by me without asking anything\u00e2\u0080\u0094and yet did\nnot go five steps further before he ask\u00e2\u0080\u0099d charity of a little woman.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\nwas much more likely to have given of the two.\u00e2\u0080\u0094He had scarce done with\nthe woman, when he pull\u00e2\u0080\u0099d off his hat to another who was coming the same\nway.\u00e2\u0080\u0094An ancient gentleman came slowly\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, after him, a young smart\none.\u00e2\u0080\u0094He let them both pass, and ask\u00e2\u0080\u0099d nothing.  I stood observing him\nhalf an hour, in which time he had made a dozen turns backwards and\nforwards, and found that he invariably pursued the same plan.\n\nThere were two things very singular in this, which set my brain to work,\nand to no purpose:\u00e2\u0080\u0094the first was, why the man should _only_ tell his\nstory to the sex;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, secondly,\u00e2\u0080\u0094what kind of story it was, and what\nspecies of eloquence it could be, which soften\u00e2\u0080\u0099d the hearts of the women,\nwhich he knew \u00e2\u0080\u0099twas to no purpose to practise upon the men.\n\nThere were two other circumstances, which entangled this mystery;\u00e2\u0080\u0094the one\nwas, he told every woman what he had to say in her ear, and in a way\nwhich had much more the air of a secret than a petition;\u00e2\u0080\u0094the other was,\nit was always successful.\u00e2\u0080\u0094He never stopp\u00e2\u0080\u0099d a woman, but she pull\u00e2\u0080\u0099d out\nher purse, and immediately gave him something.\n\nI could form no system to explain the phenomenon.\n\nI had got a riddle to amuse me for the rest of the evening; so I walk\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\nupstairs to my chamber.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CASE OF CONSCIENCE.\nPARIS.\n\n\nI WAS immediately followed up by the master of the hotel, who came into\nmy room to tell me I must provide lodgings elsewhere.\u00e2\u0080\u0094How so, friend?\nsaid I.\u00e2\u0080\u0094He answered, I had had a young woman lock\u00e2\u0080\u0099d up with me two hours\nthat evening in my bedchamber, and \u00e2\u0080\u0099twas against the rules of his\nhouse.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Very well, said I, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll all part friends then,\u00e2\u0080\u0094for the girl is no\nworse,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I am no worse,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and you will be just as I found you.\u00e2\u0080\u0094It was\nenough, he said, to overthrow the credit of his hotel.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Voyez vous_,\nMonsieur, said he, pointing to the foot of the bed we had been sitting\nupon.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I own it had something of the appearance of an evidence; but my\npride not suffering me to enter into any detail of the case, I exhorted\nhim to let his soul sleep in peace, as I resolved to let mine do that\nnight, and that I would discharge what I owed him at breakfast.\n\nI should not have minded, Monsieur, said he, if you had had twenty\ngirls\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis a score more, replied I, interrupting him, than I ever\nreckon\u00e2\u0080\u0099d upon\u00e2\u0080\u0094Provided, added he, it had been but in a morning.\u00e2\u0080\u0094And does\nthe difference of the time of the day at Paris make a difference in the\nsin?\u00e2\u0080\u0094It made a difference, he said, in the scandal.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I like a good\ndistinction in my heart; and cannot say I was intolerably out of temper\nwith the man.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I own it is necessary, resumed the master of the hotel,\nthat a stranger at Paris should have the opportunities presented to him\nof buying lace and silk stockings and ruffles, _et tout cela_;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis\nnothing if a woman comes with a band-box.\u00e2\u0080\u0094O, my conscience! said I, she\nhad one but I never look\u00e2\u0080\u0099d into it.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Then Monsieur, said he, has bought\nnothing?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Not one earthly thing, replied I.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Because, said he, I could\nrecommend one to you who would use you _en conscience_.\u00e2\u0080\u0094But I must see\nher this night, said I.\u00e2\u0080\u0094He made me a low bow, and walk\u00e2\u0080\u0099d down.\n\nNow shall I triumph over this _ma\u00c3\u00aetre d\u00e2\u0080\u0099h\u00c3\u00b4tel_, cried I,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and what then?\nThen I shall let him see I know he is a dirty fellow.\u00e2\u0080\u0094And what then?\nWhat then?\u00e2\u0080\u0094I was too near myself to say it was for the sake of others.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\nhad no good answer left;\u00e2\u0080\u0094there was more of spleen than principle in my\nproject, and I was sick of it before the execution.\n\nIn a few minutes the grisette came in with her box of lace.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll buy\nnothing, however, said I, within myself.\n\nThe grisette would show me everything.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I was hard to please: she would\nnot seem to see it; she opened her little magazine, and laid all her\nlaces one after another before me;\u00e2\u0080\u0094unfolded and folded them up again one\nby one with the most patient sweetness.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I might buy,\u00e2\u0080\u0094or not;\u00e2\u0080\u0094she would\nlet me have everything at my own price:\u00e2\u0080\u0094the poor creature seem\u00e2\u0080\u0099d anxious\nto get a penny; and laid herself out to win me, and not so much in a\nmanner which seem\u00e2\u0080\u0099d artful, as in one I felt simple and caressing.\n\nIf there is not a fund of honest gullibility in man, so much the\nworse;\u00e2\u0080\u0094my heart relented, and I gave up my second resolution as quietly\nas the first.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Why should I chastise one for the trespass of another?  If\nthou art tributary to this tyrant of an host, thought I, looking up in\nher face, so much harder is thy bread.\n\nIf I had not had more than four louis d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ors in my purse, there was no\nsuch thing as rising up and showing her the door, till I had first laid\nthree of them out in a pair of ruffles.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094The master of the hotel will share the profit with her;\u00e2\u0080\u0094no matter,\u00e2\u0080\u0094then\nI have only paid as many a poor soul has _paid_ before me, for an act he\n_could_ not do, or think of.\n\n\n\n\nTHE RIDDLE.\nPARIS.\n\n\nWHEN La Fleur came up to wait upon me at supper, he told me how sorry the\nmaster of the hotel was for his affront to me in bidding me change my\nlodgings.\n\nA man who values a good night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rest will not lie down with enmity in his\nheart, if he can help it.\u00e2\u0080\u0094So I bid La Fleur tell the master of the hotel,\nthat I was sorry on my side for the occasion I had given him;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and you may\ntell him, if you will, La Fleur, added I, that if the young woman should\ncall again, I shall not see her.\n\nThis was a sacrifice not to him, but myself, having resolved, after so\nnarrow an escape, to run no more risks, but to leave Paris, if it was\npossible, with all the virtue I enter\u00e2\u0080\u0099d it.\n\n_C\u00e2\u0080\u0099est d\u00c3\u00a9roger \u00c3\u00a0 noblesse_, _Monsieur_, said La Fleur, making me a bow\ndown to the ground as he said it.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Et encore_, _Monsieur_, said he, may\nchange his sentiments;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and if (_par hazard_) he should like to amuse\nhimself,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I find no amusement in it, said I, interrupting him.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n_Mon Dieu_! said La Fleur,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and took away.\n\nIn an hour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time he came to put me to bed, and was more than commonly\nofficious:\u00e2\u0080\u0094something hung upon his lips to say to me, or ask me, which he\ncould not get off: I could not conceive what it was, and indeed gave\nmyself little trouble to find it out, as I had another riddle so much\nmore interesting upon my mind, which was that of the man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s asking charity\nbefore the door of the hotel.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I would have given anything to have got to\nthe bottom of it; and that, not out of curiosity,\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099tis so low a principle\nof enquiry, in general, I would not purchase the gratification of it with\na two-sous piece;\u00e2\u0080\u0094but a secret, I thought, which so soon and so certainly\nsoften\u00e2\u0080\u0099d the heart of every woman you came near, was a secret at least\nequal to the philosopher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stone; had I both the Indies, I would have\ngiven up one to have been master of it.\n\nI toss\u00e2\u0080\u0099d and turn\u00e2\u0080\u0099d it almost all night long in my brains to no manner of\npurpose; and when I awoke in the morning, I found my spirits as much\ntroubled with my dreams, as ever the King of Babylon had been with his;\nand I will not hesitate to affirm, it would have puzzled all the wise men\nof Paris as much as those of Chaldea to have given its interpretation.\n\n\n\n\nLE DIMANCHE.\nPARIS.\n\n\nIT was Sunday; and when La Fleur came in, in the morning, with my coffee\nand roll and butter, he had got himself so gallantly array\u00e2\u0080\u0099d, I scarce\nknew him.\n\nI had covenanted at Montreuil to give him a new hat with a silver button\nand loop, and four louis d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ors, _pour s\u00e2\u0080\u0099adoniser_, when we got to Paris;\nand the poor fellow, to do him justice, had done wonders with it.\n\nHe had bought a bright, clean, good scarlet coat, and a pair of breeches\nof the same.\u00e2\u0080\u0094They were not a crown worse, he said, for the wearing.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\nwish\u00e2\u0080\u0099d him hang\u00e2\u0080\u0099d for telling me.\u00e2\u0080\u0094They look\u00e2\u0080\u0099d so fresh, that though I\nknew the thing could not be done, yet I would rather have imposed upon my\nfancy with thinking I had bought them new for the fellow, than that they\nhad come out of the Rue de Friperie.\n\nThis is a nicety which makes not the heart sore at Paris.\n\nHe had purchased, moreover, a handsome blue satin waistcoat, fancifully\nenough embroidered:\u00e2\u0080\u0094this was indeed something the worse for the service\nit had done, but \u00e2\u0080\u0099twas clean scour\u00e2\u0080\u0099d;\u00e2\u0080\u0094the gold had been touch\u00e2\u0080\u0099d up, and\nupon the whole was rather showy than otherwise;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and as the blue was not\nviolent, it suited with the coat and breeches very well: he had squeez\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\nout of the money, moreover, a new bag and a solitaire; and had insisted\nwith the _fripier_ upon a gold pair of garters to his breeches knees.\u00e2\u0080\u0094He\nhad purchased muslin ruffles, _bien brod\u00c3\u00a9es_, with four livres of his own\nmoney;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and a pair of white silk stockings for five more;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and to top all,\nnature had given him a handsome figure, without costing him a sous.\n\nHe entered the room thus set off, with his hair dressed in the first\nstyle, and with a handsome bouquet in his breast.\u00e2\u0080\u0094In a word, there was\nthat look of festivity in everything about him, which at once put me in\nmind it was Sunday;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, by combining both together, it instantly struck\nme, that the favour he wish\u00e2\u0080\u0099d to ask of me the night before, was to spend\nthe day as every body in Paris spent it besides.  I had scarce made the\nconjecture, when La Fleur, with infinite humility, but with a look of\ntrust, as if I should not refuse him, begg\u00e2\u0080\u0099d I would grant him the day,\n_pour faire le galant vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis de sa ma\u00c3\u00aetresse_.\n\nNow it was the very thing I intended to do myself vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis Madame de\nR\u00e2\u0080\u0094.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I had retained the remise on purpose for it, and it would not have\nmortified my vanity to have had a servant so well dress\u00e2\u0080\u0099d as La Fleur\nwas, to have got up behind it: I never could have worse spared him.\n\nBut we must _feel_, not argue in these embarrassments.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The sons and\ndaughters of Service part with liberty, but not with nature, in their\ncontracts; they are flesh and blood, and have their little vanities and\nwishes in the midst of the house of bondage, as well as their\ntask-masters;\u00e2\u0080\u0094no doubt, they have set their self-denials at a price,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and\ntheir expectations are so unreasonable, that I would often disappoint\nthem, but that their condition puts it so much in my power to do it.\n\n_Behold_,\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Behold_, _I am thy servant_\u00e2\u0080\u0094disarms me at once of the powers\nof a master.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nThou shalt go, La Fleur! said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094And what mistress, La Fleur, said I, canst thou have picked up in so\nlittle a time at Paris?  La Fleur laid his hand upon his breast, and said\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099twas a _petite demoiselle_, at Monsieur le Count de B\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\u00e2\u0080\u0094La Fleur had a\nheart made for society; and, to speak the truth of him, let as few\noccasions slip him as his master;\u00e2\u0080\u0094so that somehow or other,\u00e2\u0080\u0094but\nhow,\u00e2\u0080\u0094heaven knows,\u00e2\u0080\u0094he had connected himself with the demoiselle upon the\nlanding of the staircase, during the time I was taken up with my\npassport; and as there was time enough for me to win the Count to my\ninterest, La Fleur had contrived to make it do to win the maid to his.\nThe family, it seems, was to be at Paris that day, and he had made a\nparty with her, and two or three more of the Count\u00e2\u0080\u0099s household, upon the\nboulevards.\n\nHappy people! that once a week at least are sure to lay down all your\ncares together, and dance and sing and sport away the weights of\ngrievance, which bow down the spirit of other nations to the earth.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FRAGMENT.\nPARIS.\n\n\nLA FLEUR had left me something to amuse myself with for the day more than\nI had bargain\u00e2\u0080\u0099d for, or could have enter\u00e2\u0080\u0099d either into his head or mine.\n\nHe had brought the little print of butter upon a currant leaf: and as the\nmorning was warm, and he had a good step to bring it, he had begg\u00e2\u0080\u0099d a\nsheet of waste paper to put betwixt the currant leaf and his hand.\u00e2\u0080\u0094As\nthat was plate sufficient, I bade him lay it upon the table as it was;\nand as I resolved to stay within all day, I ordered him to call upon the\n_tra\u00c3\u00aeteur_, to bespeak my dinner, and leave me to breakfast by myself.\n\nWhen I had finished the butter, I threw the currant-leaf out of the\nwindow, and was going to do the same by the waste paper;\u00e2\u0080\u0094but stopping to\nread a line first, and that drawing me on to a second and third,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\nthought it better worth; so I shut the window, and drawing a chair up to\nit, I sat down to read it.\n\nIt was in the old French of Rabelais\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time, and for aught I know might\nhave been wrote by him:\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was moreover in a Gothic letter, and that so\nfaded and gone off by damps and length of time, it cost me infinite\ntrouble to make anything of it.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I threw it down; and then wrote a letter\nto Eugenius;\u00e2\u0080\u0094then I took it up again, and embroiled my patience with it\nafresh;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and then to cure that, I wrote a letter to Eliza.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Still it kept\nhold of me; and the difficulty of understanding it increased but the\ndesire.\n\nI got my dinner; and after I had enlightened my mind with a bottle of\nBurgundy; I at it again,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, after two or three hours poring upon it,\nwith almost as deep attention as ever Gruter or Jacob Spon did upon a\nnonsensical inscription, I thought I made sense of it; but to make sure\nof it, the best way, I imagined, was to turn it into English, and see how\nit would look then;\u00e2\u0080\u0094so I went on leisurely, as a trifling man does,\nsometimes writing a sentence,\u00e2\u0080\u0094then taking a turn or two,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and then looking\nhow the world went, out of the window; so that it was nine o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock at\nnight before I had done it.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I then began and read it as follows.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FRAGMENT.\nPARIS.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094NOW, as the notary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife disputed the point with the notary with too\nmuch heat,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I wish, said the notary, (throwing down the parchment) that\nthere was another notary here only to set down and attest all this.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094And what would you do then, Monsieur? said she, rising hastily up.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The\nnotary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife was a little fume of a woman, and the notary thought it\nwell to avoid a hurricane by a mild reply.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I would go, answered he, to\nbed.\u00e2\u0080\u0094You may go to the devil, answer\u00e2\u0080\u0099d the notary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife.\n\nNow there happening to be but one bed in the house, the other two rooms\nbeing unfurnished, as is the custom at Paris, and the notary not caring\nto lie in the same bed with a woman who had but that moment sent him pell\nmell to the devil, went forth with his hat and cane and short cloak, the\nnight being very windy, and walk\u00e2\u0080\u0099d out, ill at ease, towards the Pont\nNeuf.\n\nOf all the bridges which ever were built, the whole world who have pass\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\nover the Pont Neuf must own, that it is the noblest,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the finest,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\ngrandest,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the lightest,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the longest,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the broadest, that ever conjoin\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\nland and land together upon the face of the terraqueous globe.\n\n    [_By this it seems as if the author of the fragment had not been a\n                               Frenchman_.]\n\nThe worst fault which divines and the doctors of the Sorbonne can allege\nagainst it is, that if there is but a capfull of wind in or about Paris,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099tis more blasphemously _sacre Dieu\u00e2\u0080\u0099d_ there than in any other aperture\nof the whole city,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and with reason good and cogent, Messieurs; for it\ncomes against you without crying _garde d\u00e2\u0080\u0099eau_, and with such\nunpremeditable puffs, that of the few who cross it with their hats on,\nnot one in fifty but hazards two livres and a half, which is its full\nworth.\n\nThe poor notary, just as he was passing by the sentry, instinctively\nclapp\u00e2\u0080\u0099d his cane to the side of it, but in raising it up, the point of\nhis cane catching hold of the loop of the sentinel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hat, hoisted it over\nthe spikes of the ballustrade clear into the Seine.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099_Tis an ill wind_, said a boatman, who catched it, _which blows nobody\nany good_.\n\nThe sentry, being a Gascon, incontinently twirled up his whiskers, and\nlevell\u00e2\u0080\u0099d his arquebuss.\n\nArquebusses in those days went off with matches; and an old woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s paper\nlantern at the end of the bridge happening to be blown out, she had\nborrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099d the sentry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s match to light it:\u00e2\u0080\u0094it gave a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time for the\nGascon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blood to run cool, and turn the accident better to his\nadvantage.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099_Tis an ill wind_, said he, catching off the notary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s castor,\nand legitimating the capture with the boatman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s adage.\n\nThe poor notary crossed the bridge, and passing along the Rue de Dauphine\ninto the fauxbourgs of St. Germain, lamented himself as he walked along\nin this manner:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nLuckless man that I am! said the notary, to be the sport of hurricanes\nall my days:\u00e2\u0080\u0094to be born to have the storm of ill language levell\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\nagainst me and my profession wherever I go;

a little table with a taper\nburning was set close beside it, and close by the table was placed a\nchair:\u00e2\u0080\u0094the notary sat him down in it; and pulling out his inkhorn and a\nsheet or two of paper which he had in his pocket, he placed them before\nhim; and dipping his pen in his ink, and leaning his breast over the\ntable, he disposed everything to make the gentleman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last will and\ntestament.\n\nAlas!  _Monsieur le Notaire_, said the gentleman, raising himself up a\nlittle, I have nothing to bequeath, which will pay the expense of\nbequeathing, except the history of myself, which I could not die in\npeace, unless I left it as a legacy to the world: the profits arising out\nof it I bequeath to you for the pains of taking it from me.\u00e2\u0080\u0094It is a story\nso uncommon, it must be read by all mankind;\u00e2\u0080\u0094it will make the fortunes of\nyour house.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The notary dipp\u00e2\u0080\u0099d his pen into his inkhorn.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Almighty Director\nof every event in my life! said the old gentleman, looking up earnestly,\nand raising his hands towards heaven,\u00e2\u0080\u0094Thou, whose hand has led me on\nthrough such a labyrinth of strange passages down into this scene of\ndesolation, assist the decaying memory of an old, infirm, and\nbroken-hearted man;\u00e2\u0080\u0094direct my tongue by the spirit of thy eternal truth,\nthat this stranger may set down nought but what is written in that BOOK,\nfrom whose records, said he, clasping his hands together, I am to be\ncondemn\u00e2\u0080\u0099d or acquitted!\u00e2\u0080\u0094the notary held up the point of his pen betwixt\nthe taper and his eye.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nIt is a story, _Monsieur le Notaire_, said the gentleman, which will\nrouse up every affection in nature;\u00e2\u0080\u0094it will kill the humane, and touch\nthe heart of Cruelty herself with pity.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094The notary was inflamed with a desire to begin, and put his pen a third\ntime into his ink-horn\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the old gentleman, turning a little more\ntowards the notary, began to dictate his story in these words:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094And where is the rest of it, La Fleur? said I, as he just then enter\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\nthe room.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FRAGMENT, AND THE BOUQUET. {648}\nPARIS.\n\n\nWHEN La Fleur came up close to the table, and was made to comprehend what\nI wanted, he told me there were only two other sheets of it, which he had\nwrapped round the stalks of a bouquet to keep it together, which he had\npresented to the demoiselle upon the boulevards.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Then prithee, La Fleur,\nsaid I, step back to her to the Count de B\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel, and see if thou\ncanst get it.\u00e2\u0080\u0094There is no doubt of it, said La Fleur;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and away he flew.\n\nIn a very little time the poor fellow came back quite out of breath, with\ndeeper marks of disappointment in his looks than could arise from the\nsimple irreparability of the fragment.  _Juste Ciel_! in less than two\nminutes that the poor fellow had taken his last tender farewell of\nher\u00e2\u0080\u0094his faithless mistress had given his _gage d\u00e2\u0080\u0099amour_ to one of the\nCount\u00e2\u0080\u0099s footmen,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the footman to a young sempstress,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the sempstress to\na fiddler, with my fragment at the end of it.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Our misfortunes were\ninvolved together:\u00e2\u0080\u0094I gave a sigh,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and La Fleur echoed it back again to my\near.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094How perfidious! cried La Fleur.\u00e2\u0080\u0094How unlucky! said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094I should not have been mortified, Monsieur, quoth La Fleur, if she had\nlost it.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Nor I, La Fleur, said I, had I found it.\n\nWhether I did or no will be seen hereafter.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ACT OF CHARITY.\nPARIS.\n\n\nTHE man who either disdains or fears to walk up a dark entry may be an\nexcellent good man, and fit for a hundred things, but he will not do to\nmake a good Sentimental Traveller.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I count little of the many things I\nsee pass at broad noonday, in large and open streets.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Nature is shy, and\nhates to act before spectators; but in such an unobserved corner you\nsometimes see a single short scene of hers worth all the sentiments of a\ndozen French plays compounded together,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and yet they are absolutely\nfine;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and whenever I have a more brilliant affair upon my hands than\ncommon, as they suit a preacher just as well as a hero, I generally make\nmy sermon out of \u00e2\u0080\u0099em;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and for the text,\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cCappadocia, Pontus and Asia,\nPhrygia and Pamphylia,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094is as good as any one in the Bible.\n\nThere is a long dark passage issuing out from the Opera Comique into a\nnarrow street; \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis trod by a few who humbly wait for a _fiacre_, {649}\nor wish to get off quietly o\u00e2\u0080\u0099foot when the opera is done.  At the end of\nit, towards the theatre, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis lighted by a small candle, the light of\nwhich is almost lost before you get half-way down, but near the door\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099tis\nmore for ornament than use: you see it as a fixed star of the least\nmagnitude; it burns,\u00e2\u0080\u0094but does little good to the world, that we know of.\n\nIn returning along this passage, I discerned, as I approached within five\nor six paces of the door, two ladies standing arm-in-arm with their backs\nagainst the wall, waiting, as I imagined, for a _fiacre_;\u00e2\u0080\u0094as they were\nnext the door, I thought they had a prior right; so edged myself up\nwithin a yard or little more of them, and quietly took my stand.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I was in\nblack, and scarce seen.\n\nThe lady next me was a tall lean figure of a woman, of about thirty-six;\nthe other of the same size and make, of about forty: there was no mark of\nwife or widow in any one part of either of them;\u00e2\u0080\u0094they seem\u00e2\u0080\u0099d to be two\nupright vestal sisters, unsapped by caresses, unbroke in upon by tender\nsalutations.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I could have wish\u00e2\u0080\u0099d to have made them happy:\u00e2\u0080\u0094their happiness\nwas destin\u00e2\u0080\u0099d that night, to come from another quarter.\n\nA low voice, with a good turn of expression, and sweet cadence at the end\nof it, begg\u00e2\u0080\u0099d for a twelve-sous piece betwixt them, for the love of\nheaven.  I thought it singular that a beggar should fix the quota of an\nalms\u00e2\u0080\u0094and that the sum should be twelve times as much as what is usually\ngiven in the dark.\u00e2\u0080\u0094They both seemed astonished at it as much as\nmyself.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Twelve sous! said one.\u00e2\u0080\u0094A twelve-sous piece! said the other,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and\nmade no reply.\n\nThe poor man said, he knew not how to ask less of ladies of their rank;\nand bow\u00e2\u0080\u0099d down his head to the ground.\n\nPoo! said they,\u00e2\u0080\u0094we have no money.\n\nThe beggar remained silent for a moment or two, and renew\u00e2\u0080\u0099d his\nsupplication.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094Do not, my fair young ladies, said he, stop your good ears against\nme.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Upon my word, honest man! said the younger, we have no change.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Then\nGod bless you, said the poor man, and multiply those joys which you can\ngive to others without change!\u00e2\u0080\u0094I observed the elder sister put her hand\ninto her pocket.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see, said she, if I have a sous.  A sous! give\ntwelve, said the supplicant; Nature has been bountiful to you, be\nbountiful to a poor man.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094I would friend, with all my heart, said the younger, if I had it.\n\nMy fair charitable! said he, addressing himself to the elder,\u00e2\u0080\u0094what is it\nbut your goodness and humanity which makes your bright eyes so sweet,\nthat they outshine the morning even in this dark passage? and what was it\nwhich made the Marquis de Santerre and his brother say so much of you\nboth as they just passed by?\n\nThe two ladies seemed much affected; and impulsively, at the same time\nthey both put their hands into their pocket, and each took out a\ntwelve-sous piece.\n\nThe contest betwixt them and the poor supplicant was no more;\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was\ncontinued betwixt themselves, which of the two should give the\ntwelve-sous piece in charity;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, to end the dispute, they both gave it\ntogether, and the man went away.\n\n\n\n\nTHE RIDDLE EXPLAINED.\nPARIS.\n\n\nI STEPPED hastily after him: it was the very man whose success in asking\ncharity of the women before the door of the hotel had so puzzled me;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and\nI found at once his secret, or at least the basis of it:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099twas flattery.\n\nDelicious essence! how refreshing art thou to Nature! how strongly are\nall its powers and all its weaknesses on thy side! how sweetly dost thou\nmix with the blood, and help it through the most difficult and tortuous\npassages to the heart!\n\nThe poor man, as he was not straiten\u00e2\u0080\u0099d for time, had given it here in a\nlarger dose: \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis certain he had a way of bringing it into a less form,\nfor the many sudden cases he had to do with in the streets: but how he\ncontrived to correct, sweeten, concentre, and qualify it,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I vex not my\nspirit with the enquiry;\u00e2\u0080\u0094it is enough the beggar gained two twelve-sous\npieces\u00e2\u0080\u0094and they can best tell the rest, who have gained much greater\nmatters by it.\n\n\n\n\nPARIS.\n\n\nWE get forwards in the world, not so much by doing services, as receiving\nthem; you take a withering twig, and put it in the ground; and then you\nwater it, because you have planted it.\n\nMonsieur le Count de B\u00e2\u0080\u0094, merely because he had done me one kindness in\nthe affair of my passport, would go on and do me another, the few days he\nwas at Paris, in making me known to a few people of rank; and they were\nto present me to others, and so on.\n\nI had got master of my _secret_ just in time to turn these honours to\nsome little account; otherwise, as is commonly the case, I should have\ndined or supp\u00e2\u0080\u0099d a single time or two round, and then, by _translating_\nFrench looks and attitudes into plain English, I should presently have\nseen, that I had hold of the _couvert_ {652} of some more entertaining\nguest; and in course should have resigned all my places one after\nanother, merely upon the principle that I could not keep them.\u00e2\u0080\u0094As it was,\nthings did not go much amiss.\n\nI had the honour of being introduced to the old Marquis de B\u00e2\u0080\u0094: in days of\nyore he had signalized himself by some small feats of chivalry in the\n_Cour d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Amour_, and had dress\u00e2\u0080\u0099d himself out to the idea of tilts and\ntournaments ever since.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The Marquis de B\u00e2\u0080\u0094 wish\u00e2\u0080\u0099d to have it thought the\naffair was somewhere else than in his brain.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe could like to take a\ntrip to England,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and asked much of the English ladies.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Stay where you\nare, I beseech you, Monsieur le Marquis, said I.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Les Messieurs Anglois_\ncan scarce get a kind look from them as it is.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The Marquis invited me to\nsupper.\n\nMonsieur P\u00e2\u0080\u0094, the farmer-general, was just as inquisitive about our taxes.\nThey were very considerable, he heard.\u00e2\u0080\u0094If we knew but how to collect\nthem, said I, making him a low bow.\n\nI could never have been invited to Mons.

I had not taken my seat, before I saw she did not care a sous\nwhether I had any wit or no;\u00e2\u0080\u0094I was let in, to be convinced she had.  I\ncall heaven to witness I never once opened the door of my lips.\n\nMadame de V\u00e2\u0080\u0094 vow\u00e2\u0080\u0099d to every creature she met\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe had never had a more\nimproving conversation with a man in her life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere are three epochas in the empire of a French woman.\u00e2\u0080\u0094She is\ncoquette,\u00e2\u0080\u0094then deist,\u00e2\u0080\u0094then _d\u00c3\u00a9vote_: the empire during these is never\nlost,\u00e2\u0080\u0094she only changes her subjects when thirty-five years and more have\nunpeopled her dominion of the slaves of love, she re-peoples it with\nslaves of infidelity,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and then with the slaves of the church.\n\nMadame de V\u00e2\u0080\u0094 was vibrating betwixt the first of those epochas: the colour\nof the rose was fading fast away;\u00e2\u0080\u0094she ought to have been a deist five\nyears before the time I had the honour to pay my first visit.\n\nShe placed me upon the same sofa with her, for the sake of disputing the\npoint of religion more closely.\u00e2\u0080\u0094In short Madame de V\u00e2\u0080\u0094 told me she\nbelieved nothing.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I told Madame de V\u00e2\u0080\u0094 it might be her principle, but I\nwas sure it could not be her interest to level the outworks, without\nwhich I could not conceive how such a citadel as hers could be\ndefended;\u00e2\u0080\u0094that there was not a more dangerous thing in the world than for\na beauty to be a deist;\u00e2\u0080\u0094that it was a debt I owed my creed not to conceal\nit from her;\u00e2\u0080\u0094that I had not been five minutes sat upon the sofa beside\nher, but I had begun to form designs;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and what is it, but the sentiments\nof religion, and the persuasion they had excited in her breast, which\ncould have check\u00e2\u0080\u0099d them as they rose up?\n\nWe are not adamant, said I, taking hold of her hand;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and there is need of\nall restraints, till age in her own time steals in and lays them on\nus.\u00e2\u0080\u0094But my dear lady, said I, kissing her hand,\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099tis too\u00e2\u0080\u0094too soon.\n\nI declare I had the credit all over Paris of unperverting Madame de\nV\u00e2\u0080\u0094.\u00e2\u0080\u0094She affirmed to Monsieur D\u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the Abb\u00c3\u00a9 M\u00e2\u0080\u0094, that in one half hour I\nhad said more for revealed religion, than all their Encyclop\u00c3\u00a6dia had said\nagainst it.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I was listed directly into Madame de V\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099s _coterie_;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and she\nput off the epocha of deism for two years.\n\nI remember it was in this _coterie_, in the middle of a discourse, in\nwhich I was showing the necessity of a _first_ cause, when the young\nCount de Faineant took me by the hand to the farthest corner of the room,\nto tell me my _solitaire_ was pinn\u00e2\u0080\u0099d too straight about my neck.\u00e2\u0080\u0094It\nshould be _plus badinant_, said the Count, looking down upon his own;\u00e2\u0080\u0094but\na word, Monsieur Yorick, _to the wise_\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nAnd _from the wise_, Monsieur le Count, replied I, making him a bow,\u00e2\u0080\u0094_is\nenough_.\n\nThe Count de Faineant embraced me with more ardour than ever I was\nembraced by mortal man.\n\nFor three weeks together I was of every man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opinion I met.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Pardi_!

But I know not how it is, but I am never so\nperfectly conscious of the existence of a soul within me, as when I am\nentangled in them.\n\nThe old mother came to the door; her looks told me the story before she\nopen\u00e2\u0080\u0099d her mouth.\u00e2\u0080\u0094She had lost her husband; he had died, she said, of\nanguish, for the loss of Maria\u00e2\u0080\u0099s senses, about a month before.\u00e2\u0080\u0094She had\nfeared at first, she added, that it would have plunder\u00e2\u0080\u0099d her poor girl of\nwhat little understanding was left;\u00e2\u0080\u0094but, on the contrary, it had brought\nher more to herself:\u00e2\u0080\u0094still, she could not rest.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Her poor daughter, she\nsaid, crying, was wandering somewhere about the road.\n\nWhy does my pulse beat languid as I write this? and what made La Fleur,\nwhose heart seem\u00e2\u0080\u0099d only to be tuned to joy, to pass the back of his hand\ntwice across his eyes, as the woman stood and told it?  I beckoned to the\npostilion to turn back into the road.\n\nWhen we had got within half a league of Moulines, at a little opening in\nthe road leading to a thicket, I discovered poor Maria sitting under a\npoplar.  She was sitting with her elbow in her lap, and her head leaning\non one side within her hand:\u00e2\u0080\u0094a small brook ran at the foot of the tree.\n\nI bid the postilion go on with the chaise to Moulines\u00e2\u0080\u0094and La Fleur to\nbespeak my supper;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and that I would walk after him.\n\nShe was dress\u00e2\u0080\u0099d in white, and much as my friend described her, except\nthat her hair hung loose, which before was twisted within a silk net.\u00e2\u0080\u0094She\nhad superadded likewise to her jacket, a pale green riband, which fell\nacross her shoulder to the waist; at the end of which hung her pipe.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Her\ngoat had been as faithless as her lover; and she had got a little dog in\nlieu of him, which she had kept tied by a string to her girdle: as I\nlooked at her dog, she drew him towards her with the string.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cThou shalt\nnot leave me, Sylvio,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.  I look\u00e2\u0080\u0099d in Maria\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes and saw she\nwas thinking more of her father than of her lover, or her little goat;\nfor, as she utter\u00e2\u0080\u0099d them, the tears trickled down her cheeks.\n\nI sat down close by her; and Maria let me wipe them away as they fell,\nwith my handkerchief.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I then steep\u00e2\u0080\u0099d it in my own,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and then in hers,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and\nthen in mine,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and then I wip\u00e2\u0080\u0099d hers again;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and as I did it, I felt such\nundescribable emotions within me, as I am sure could not be accounted for\nfrom any combinations of matter and motion.\n\nI am positive I have a soul; nor can all the books with which\nmaterialists have pester\u00e2\u0080\u0099d the world ever convince me to the contrary.\n\n\n\n\nMARIA.\n\n\nWHEN Maria had come a little to herself, I ask\u00e2\u0080\u0099d her if she remembered a\npale thin person of a man, who had sat down betwixt her and her goat\nabout two years before?  She said she was unsettled much at that time,\nbut remembered it upon two accounts:\u00e2\u0080\u0094that ill as she was, she saw the\nperson pitied her; and next, that her goat had stolen his handkerchief,\nand she had beat him for the theft;\u00e2\u0080\u0094she had wash\u00e2\u0080\u0099d it, she said, in the\nbrook, and kept it ever since in her pocket to restore it to him in case\nshe should ever see him again, which, she added, he had half promised\nher.  As she told me this, she took the handkerchief out of her pocket to\nlet me see it; she had folded it up neatly in a couple of vine leaves,\ntied round with a tendril;\u00e2\u0080\u0094on opening it, I saw an S. marked in one of\nthe corners.\n\nShe had since that, she told me, stray\u00e2\u0080\u0099d as far as Rome, and walk\u00e2\u0080\u0099d round\nSt. Peter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s once,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and return\u00e2\u0080\u0099d back;\u00e2\u0080\u0094that she found her way alone across\nthe Apennines;\u00e2\u0080\u0094had travell\u00e2\u0080\u0099d over all Lombardy, without money,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and\nthrough the flinty roads of Savoy without shoes:\u00e2\u0080\u0094how she had borne it,\nand how she had got supported, she could not tell;\u00e2\u0080\u0094but _God tempers the\nwind_, said Maria, _to the shorn lamb_.\n\nShorn indeed! and to the quick, said I: and wast thou in my own land,\nwhere I have a cottage, I would take thee to it, and shelter thee: thou\nshouldst eat of my own bread and drink of my own cup;\u00e2\u0080\u0094I would be kind to\nthy Sylvio;\u00e2\u0080\u0094in all thy weaknesses and wanderings I would seek after thee\nand bring thee back;\u00e2\u0080\u0094when the sun went down I would say my prayers: and\nwhen I had done thou shouldst play thy evening song upon thy pipe, nor\nwould the incense of my sacrifice be worse accepted for entering heaven\nalong with that of a broken heart!\n\nNature melted within me, as I utter\u00e2\u0080\u0099d this; and Maria observing, as I\ntook out my handkerchief, that it was steep\u00e2\u0080\u0099d too much already to be of\nuse, would needs go wash it in the stream.\u00e2\u0080\u0094And where will you dry it,\nMaria? said I.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll dry it in my bosom, said she:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099twill do me good.\n\nAnd is your heart still so warm, Maria? said I.\n\nI touch\u00e2\u0080\u0099d upon the string on which hung all her sorrows:\u00e2\u0080\u0094she look\u00e2\u0080\u0099d with\nwistful disorder for some time in my face; and then, without saying any\nthing, took her pipe and play\u00e2\u0080\u0099d her service to the Virgin.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The string I\nhad touched ceased to vibrate;\u00e2\u0080\u0094in a moment or two Maria returned to\nherself,\u00e2\u0080\u0094let her pipe fall,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and rose up.\n\nAnd where are you going, Maria? said I.\u00e2\u0080\u0094She said, to Moulines.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Let us go,\nsaid I, together.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Maria put her arm within mine, and lengthening the\nstring, to let the dog follow,\u00e2\u0080\u0094in that order we enter\u00e2\u0080\u0099d Moulines.\n\n\n\n\nMARIA.\nMOULINES.\n\n\nTHOUGH I hate salutations and greetings in the market-place, yet, when we\ngot into the middle of this, I stopp\u00e2\u0080\u0099d to take my last look and last\nfarewell of Maria.\n\nMaria, though not tall, was nevertheless of the first order of fine\nforms:\u00e2\u0080\u0094affliction had touched her looks with something that was scarce\nearthly;\u00e2\u0080\u0094still she was feminine;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and so much was there about her of all\nthat the heart wishes, or the eye looks for in woman, that could the\ntraces be ever worn out of her brain, and those of Eliza out of mine, she\nshould _not only eat of my bread and drink of my own cup_, but Maria\nshould lie in my bosom, and be unto me as a daughter.\n\nAdieu, poor luckless maiden!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Imbibe the oil and wine which the compassion\nof a stranger, as he journeyeth on his way, now pours into thy\nwounds;\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Being, who has twice bruised thee, can only bind them up for\never.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BOURBONNNOIS.\n\n\nTHERE was nothing from which I had painted out for my self so joyous a\nriot of the affections, as in this journey in the vintage, through this\npart of France; but pressing through this gate, of sorrow to it, my\nsufferings have totally unfitted me.  In every scene of festivity, I saw\nMaria in the background of the piece, sitting pensive under her poplar;\nand I had got almost to Lyons before I was able to cast a shade across\nher.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094Dear Sensibility! source inexhausted of all that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s precious in our joys,\nor costly in our sorrows! thou chainest thy martyr down upon his bed of\nstraw\u00e2\u0080\u0094and \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis thou who lift\u00e2\u0080\u0099st him up to Heaven!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Eternal Fountain of our\nfeelings!\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099tis here I trace thee\u00e2\u0080\u0094and this is thy \u00e2\u0080\u009c_divinity which stirs\nwithin me_;\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094not that, in some sad and sickening moments, \u00e2\u0080\u009c_my soul\nshrinks back upon herself_, _and startles at destruction_;\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094mere pomp of\nwords!\u00e2\u0080\u0094but that I feel some generous joys and generous cares beyond\nmyself;\u00e2\u0080\u0094all comes from thee, great\u00e2\u0080\u0094great SENSORIUM of the world! which\nvibrates, if a hair of our heads but falls upon the ground, in the\nremotest desert of thy creation.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Touch\u00e2\u0080\u0099d with thee, Eugenius draws my\ncurtain when I languish\u00e2\u0080\u0094hears my tale of symptoms, and blames the weather\nfor the disorder of his nerves.  Thou giv\u00e2\u0080\u0099st a portion of it sometimes to\nthe roughest peasant who traverses the bleakest mountains;\u00e2\u0080\u0094he finds the\nlacerated lamb of another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flock.\u00e2\u0080\u0094This moment I behold him leaning with\nhis head against his crook, with piteous inclination looking down upon\nit!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Oh! had I come one moment sooner! it bleeds to death!\u00e2\u0080\u0094his gentle\nheart bleeds with it.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nPeace to thee, generous swain!\u00e2\u0080\u0094I see thou walkest off with anguish,\u00e2\u0080\u0094but\nthy joys shall balance it;\u00e2\u0080\u0094for, happy is thy cottage,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and happy is the\nsharer of it,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and happy are the lambs which sport about you!\n\n\n\n\nTHE SUPPER.\n\n\nA SHOE coming loose from the fore foot of the thill-horse, at the\nbeginning of the ascent of mount Taurira, the postilion dismounted,\ntwisted the shoe off, and put it in his pocket; as the ascent was of five\nor six miles, and that horse our main dependence, I made a point of\nhaving the shoe fastened on again, as well as we could; but the postilion\nhad thrown away the nails, and the hammer in the chaise box being of no\ngreat use without them, I submitted to go on.\n\nHe had not mounted half a mile higher, when, coming to a flinty piece of\nroad, the poor devil lost a second shoe, and from off his other fore\nfoot.  I then got out of the chaise in good earnest; and seeing a house\nabout a quarter of a mile to the left hand, with a great deal to do I\nprevailed upon the postilion to turn up to it.  The look of the house,\nand of every thing about it, as we drew nearer, soon reconciled me to the\ndisaster.\u00e2\u0080\u0094It was a little farm-house, surrounded with about twenty acres\nof vineyard, about as much corn;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and close to the house, on one side, was\na _potagerie_ of an acre and a half, full of everything which could make\nplenty in a French peasant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, on the other side, was a little\nwood, which furnished wherewithal to dress it.  It was about eight in the\nevening when I got to the house\u00e2\u0080\u0094so I left the postilion to manage his\npoint as he could;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, for mine, I walked directly into the house.\n\nThe family consisted of an old grey-headed man and his wife, with five or\nsix sons and sons-in-law, and their several wives, and a joyous genealogy\nout of them.\n\nThey were all sitting down together to their lentil-soup; a large wheaten\nloaf was in the middle of the table; and a flagon of wine at each end of\nit promised joy through the stages of the repast:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099twas a feast of love.\n\nThe old man rose up to meet me, and with a respectful cordiality would\nhave me sit down at the table; my heart was set down the moment I enter\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\nthe room; so I sat down at once like a son of the family; and to invest\nmyself in the character as speedily as I could, I instantly borrowed the\nold man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knife, and taking up the loaf, cut myself a hearty luncheon;\nand, as I did it, I saw a testimony in every eye, not only of an honest\nwelcome, but of a welcome mix\u00e2\u0080\u0099d with thanks that I had not seem\u00e2\u0080\u0099d to\ndoubt it.\n\nWas it this? or tell me, Nature, what else it was that made this morsel\nso sweet,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and to what magic I owe it, that the draught I took of their\nflagon was so delicious with it, that they remain upon my palate to this\nhour?\n\nIf the supper was to my taste,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the grace which followed it was much more\nso.\n\n\n\n\nTHE GRACE.\n\n\nWHEN supper was over, the old man gave a knock upon the table with the\nhaft of his knife, to bid them prepare for the dance: the moment the\nsignal was given, the women and girls ran altogether into a back\napartment to tie up their hair,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the young men to the door to wash\ntheir faces, and change their sabots; and in three minutes every soul was\nready upon a little esplanade before the house to begin.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The old man and\nhis wife came out last, and placing me betwixt them, sat down upon a sofa\nof turf by the door.\n\nThe old man had some fifty years ago been no mean performer upon the\nvielle,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and at the age he was then of, touch\u00e2\u0080\u0099d it well enough for the\npurpose.  His wife sung now and then a little to the tune,\u00e2\u0080\u0094then\nintermitted,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and join\u00e2\u0080\u0099d her old man again, as their children and\ngrand-children danced before them.\n\nIt was not till the middle of the second dance, when, from some pauses in\nthe movements, wherein they all seemed to look up, I fancied I could\ndistinguish an elevation of spirit different from that which is the cause\nor the effect of simple jollity.  In a word, I thought I beheld\n_Religion_ mixing in the dance:\u00e2\u0080\u0094but, as I had never seen her so engaged,\nI should have look\u00e2\u0080\u0099d upon it now as one of the illusions of an\nimagination which is eternally misleading me, had not the old man, as\nsoon as the dance ended, said, that this was their constant way; and that\nall his life long he had made it a rule, after supper was over, to call\nout his family to dance and rejoice; believing, he said, that a cheerful\nand contented mind was the best sort of thanks to heaven that an\nilliterate peasant could pay,\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nOr a learned prelate either, said I.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CASE OF DELICACY.\n\n\nWHEN you have gained the top of Mount Taurira, you run presently down to\nLyons:\u00e2\u0080\u0094adieu, then, to all rapid movements!  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis a journey of caution;\nand it fares better with sentiments, not to be in a hurry with them; so I\ncontracted with a voiturin to take his time with a couple of mules, and\nconvoy me in my own chaise safe to Turin, through Savoy.\n\nPoor, patient, quiet, honest people! fear not: your poverty, the treasury\nof your simple virtues, will not be envied you by the world, nor will\nyour valleys be invaded by it.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Nature! in the midst of thy disorders,\nthou art still friendly to the scantiness thou hast created: with all thy\ngreat works about thee, little hast thou left to give, either to the\nscythe or to the sickle;\u00e2\u0080\u0094but to that little thou grantest safety and\nprotection; and sweet are the dwellings which stand so shelter\u00e2\u0080\u0099d.\n\nLet the way-worn traveller vent his complaints upon the sudden turns and\ndangers of your roads,\u00e2\u0080\u0094your rocks,\u00e2\u0080\u0094your precipices;\u00e2\u0080\u0094the difficulties of\ngetting up,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the horrors of getting down,\u00e2\u0080\u0094mountains impracticable,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and\ncataracts, which roll down great stones from their summits, and block his\nroad up.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The peasants had been all day at work in removing a fragment of\nthis kind between St. Michael and Madane; and, by the time my voiturin\ngot to the place, it wanted full two hours of completing before a passage\ncould any how be gain\u00e2\u0080\u0099d: there was nothing but to wait with\npatience;\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099twas a wet and tempestuous night; so that by the delay, and\nthat together, the voiturin found himself obliged to put up five miles\nshort of his stage at a little decent kind of an inn by the roadside.\n\nI forthwith took possession of my bedchamber\u00e2\u0080\u0094got a good fire\u00e2\u0080\u0094order\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\nsupper; and was thanking heaven it was no worse, when a voiture arrived\nwith a lady in it and her servant maid.\n\nAs there was no other bed-chamber in the house, the hostess,\u00e2\u0080\u0094without much\nnicety, led them into mine, telling them, as she usher\u00e2\u0080\u0099d them in, that\nthere was nobody in it but an English gentleman;\u00e2\u0080\u0094that there were two good\nbeds in it, and a closet within the room which held another.  The accent\nin which she spoke of this third bed, did not say much for it;\u00e2\u0080\u0094however,\nshe said there were three beds and but three people, and she durst say,\nthe gentleman would do anything to accommodate matters.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I left not the\nlady a moment to make a conjecture about it\u00e2\u0080\u0094so instantly made a\ndeclaration that I would do anything in my power.\n\nAs this did not amount to an absolute surrender of my bed-chamber, I\nstill felt myself so much the proprietor, as to have a right to do the\nhonours of it;\u00e2\u0080\u0094so I desired the lady to sit down,\u00e2\u0080\u0094pressed her into the\nwarmest seat,\u00e2\u0080\u0094called for more wood,\u00e2\u0080\u0094desired the hostess to enlarge the\nplan of the supper, and to favour us with the very best wine.\n\nThe lady had scarce warm\u00e2\u0080\u0099d herself five minutes at the fire, before she\nbegan to turn her head back, and give a look at the beds; and the oftener\nshe cast her eyes that way, the more they return\u00e2\u0080\u0099d perplexd;\u00e2\u0080\u0094I felt for\nher\u00e2\u0080\u0094and for myself: for in a few minutes, what by her looks, and the case\nitself, I found myself as much embarrassed as it was possible the lady\ncould be herself.\n\nThat the beds we were to lie in were in one and the same room, was enough\nsimply by itself to have excited all this;\u00e2\u0080\u0094but the position of them, for\nthey stood parallel, and so very close to each other as only to allow\nspace for a small wicker chair betwixt them, rendered the affair still\nmore oppressive to us;\u00e2\u0080\u0094they were fixed up moreover near the fire; and the\nprojection of the chimney on one side, and a large beam which cross\u00e2\u0080\u0099d the\nroom on the other, formed a kind of recess for them that was no way\nfavourable to the nicety of our sensations:\u00e2\u0080\u0094if anything could have added\nto it, it was that the two beds were both of them so very small, as to\ncut us off from every idea of the lady and the maid lying together; which\nin either of them, could it have been feasible, my lying beside them,\nthough a thing not to be wish\u00e2\u0080\u0099d, yet there was nothing in it so terrible\nwhich the imagination might not have pass\u00e2\u0080\u0099d over without torment.\n\nAs for the little room within, it offer\u00e2\u0080\u0099d little or no consolation to us:\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099twas a damp, cold closet, with a half dismantled window-shutter, and\nwith a window which had neither glass nor oil paper in it to keep out the\ntempest of the night.  I did not endeavour to stifle my cough when the\nlady gave a peep into it; so it reduced the case in course to this\nalternative\u00e2\u0080\u0094That the lady should sacrifice her health to her feelings,\nand take up with the closet herself, and abandon the bed next mine to her\nmaid,\u00e2\u0080\u0094or that the girl should take the closet, &c., &c.\n\nThe lady was a Piedmontese of about thirty, with a glow of health in her\ncheeks.  The maid was a Lyonoise of twenty, and as brisk and lively a\nFrench girl as ever moved.\u00e2\u0080\u0094There were difficulties every way,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the\nobstacle of the stone in the road, which brought us into the distress,\ngreat as it appeared whilst the peasants were removing it, was but a\npebble to what lay in our ways now.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I have only to add, that it did not\nlessen the weight which hung upon our spirits, that we were both too\ndelicate to communicate what we felt to each other upon the occasion.\n\nWe sat down to supper; and had we not had more generous wine to it than a\nlittle inn in Savoy could have furnish\u00e2\u0080\u0099d, our tongues had been tied up,\ntill necessity herself had set them at liberty;\u00e2\u0080\u0094but the lady having a few\nbottles of Burgundy in her voiture, sent down her _fille de chambre_ for\na couple of them; so that by the time supper was over, and we were left\nalone, we felt ourselves inspired with a strength of mind sufficient to\ntalk, at least, without reserve upon our situation.  We turn\u00e2\u0080\u0099d it every\nway, and debated and considered it in all kinds of lights in the course\nof a two hours\u00e2\u0080\u0099 negotiation; at the end of which the articles were\nsettled finally betwixt us, and stipulated for in form and manner of a\ntreaty of peace,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I believe with as much religion and good faith on\nboth sides as in any treaty which has yet had the honour of being handed\ndown to posterity.\n\nThey were as follow:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nFirst, as the right of the bed-chamber is in Monsieur,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and he thinking\nthe bed next to the fire to be the warmest, he insists upon the\nconcession on the lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side of taking up with it.\n\nGranted, on the part of Madame; with a proviso, That as the curtains of\nthat bed are of a flimsy transparent cotton, and appear likewise too\nscanty to draw close, that the _fille de chambre_ shall fasten up the\nopening, either by corking pins, or needle and thread, in such manner as\nshall be deem\u00e2\u0080\u0099d a sufficient barrier on the side of Monsieur.\n\n2dly.  It is required on the part of Madame, that Monsieur shall lie the\nwhole night through in his _robe de chambre_.\n\nRejected: inasmuch as Monsieur is not worth a _robe de chambre_; he\nhaving nothing in his portmanteau but six shirts and a black silk pair of\nbreeches.\n\nThe mentioning the silk pair of breeches made an entire change of the\narticle,\u00e2\u0080\u0094for the breeches were accepted as an equivalent for the _robe de\nchambre_; and so it was stipulated and agreed upon, that I should lie in\nmy black silk breeches all night.\n\n3dly.  It was insisted upon and stipulated for by the lady, that after\nMonsieur was got to bed, and the candle and fire extinguished, that\nMonsieur should not speak one single word the whole night.\n\nGranted; provided Monsieur\u00e2\u0080\u0099s saying his prayers might not be deemed an\ninfraction of the treaty.\n\nThere was but one point forgot in this treaty, and that was the manner in\nwhich the lady and myself should be obliged to undress and get to\nbed;\u00e2\u0080\u0094there was but one way of doing it, and that I leave to the reader to\ndevise; protesting as I do it, that if it is not the most delicate in\nnature, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis the fault of his own imagination,\u00e2\u0080\u0094against which this is not\nmy first complaint.\n\nNow, when we were got to bed, whether it was the novelty of the\nsituation, or what it was, I know not; but so it was, I could not shut my\neyes; I tried this side, and that, and turn\u00e2\u0080\u0099d and turn\u00e2\u0080\u0099d again, till a\nfull hour after midnight; when Nature and patience both wearing out,\u00e2\u0080\u0094O,\nmy God! said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094You have broke the treaty, Monsieur, said the lady, who had no more\nslept than myself.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I begg\u00e2\u0080\u0099d a thousand pardons\u00e2\u0080\u0094but insisted it was no\nmore than an ejaculation.  She maintained \u00e2\u0080\u0099twas an entire infraction of\nthe treaty\u00e2\u0080\u0094I maintain\u00e2\u0080\u0099d it was provided for in the clause of the third\narticle.\n\nThe lady would by no means give up her point, though she weaken\u00e2\u0080\u0099d her\nbarrier by it; for in the warmth of the dispute, I could hear two or\nthree corking pins fall out of the curtain to the ground.\n\nUpon my word and honour, Madame, said I,\u00e2\u0080\u0094stretching my arm out of bed by\nway of asseveration.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n(I was going to have added, that I would not have trespassed against the\nremotest idea of decorum for the world);\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nBut the _fille de chambre_ hearing there were words between us, and\nfearing that hostilities would ensue in course, had crept silently out of\nher closet, and it being totally dark, had stolen so close to our beds,\nthat she had got herself into the narrow passage which separated them,\nand had advanced so far up as to be in a line betwixt her mistress and\nme:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nSo that when I stretch\u00e2\u0080\u0099d out my hand I caught hold of the _fille de\nchambre\u00e2\u0080\u0099s_\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n                                * * * * *\n\n                                 THE END\n\n                                * * * * *\n\n\n\n\nFOOTNOTES.\n\n\n{557}  All the effects of strangers (Swiss and Scotch excepted) dying in\nFrance, are seized by virtue of this law, though the heir be upon the\nspot\u00e2\u0080\u0094the profit of these contingencies being farmed, there is no redress.\n\n{562}  A chaise, so called, in France, from its holding but one person.\n\n{580}  Vide S\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Travels: [_i.e._ Dr. Smollett\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cTravels through France\nand Italy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094ED.]\n\n{588}  Post-horse.\n\n{648}  Nosegay.\n\n{649}  Hackney coach.\n\n{652}  Plate, napkin, knife, fork and spoon.\n\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY THROUGH FRANCE\nAND ITALY***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 804-0.txt or 804-0.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/8\/0\/804\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n","id":1134,"split":"test"}
