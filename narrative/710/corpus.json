He hopes for assistance from Poland. He declares that he is the son of Ivan the Terrible and was not, as reputed, murdered in 1591 as a child, but raised in a cloister and that he afterward was in the service of the Prince of Sendomir. He asserts that he is Czar Demetrius. His impressive speech convinces both the diet and the king. Although a formal resolution is not passed by the diet because of a veto by Prince Sapiehas, Poland goes into battle against Moscow. The Poles desire to oust Boris Godunov with the help of the upstart Demetrius. The forceful spirit behind the attempt is Demetrius' fianc\u0102\u0160e Marina, Mnischek's daughter and Czar Ivan's widow. The latter has been banned to a cloister by Godunov and has for years been grieving for her allegedly murdered son when she receives the news that Demetrius is alive, after all.\nSchiller only indicated the course of the further action. Boris hears about the successes of Demetrius and commits suicide with poison. The new czar is a benevolent ruler until he discovers that his claim to the throne is not legitimate. He is not Ivan's son, but was merely used as a tool by the faction of Godunov opponents. When his mother Marfa is supposed to provide identification, she does not recognize him. Despite the lacking legitimation, Demetrius requests her to recognize him as her son. But Marfa follows her conscience and refuses.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Demetrius, by Frederich Schiller\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

On a raised platform, elevated by three\n      steps, and surmounted by a canopy, is the imperial throne, the\n      escutcheons of Poland and Lithuania suspended on each side. The KING\n      seated upon the throne; on his right and left hand his ten royal\n      officers standing on the platform. Below the platform the BISHOPS,\n      PALATINES, and CASTELLANS seated on each side of the stage.\n      Opposite to these stand the Provincial DEPUTIES, in a double line,\n      uncovered. All armed. The ARCHBISHOP OF GNESEN, as the primate of\n      the kingdom, is seated next the proscenium; his chaplain behind him,\n      bearing a golden cross.\n\n   ARCHBISHOP OF GNESEN.\n   Thus then hath this tempestuous Diet been\n   Conducted safely to a prosperous close;\n   And king and commons part as cordial friends.\n   The nobles have consented to disarm,\n   And straight disband the dangerous Rocoss [1];\n   Whilst our good king his sacred word has pledged,\n   That every just complaint shall have redress.\n   And now that all is peace at home, we may\n   Look to the things that claim our care abroad.\n   Is it the will of the most high Estates\n   That Prince Demetrius, who hath advanced\n   A claim to Russia's crown, as Ivan's son,\n   Should at their bar appear, and in the face\n   Of this august assembly prove his right?\n\n      [1] An insurrectionary muster of the nobles.\n\n   CASTELLAN OF CRACOW.\n   Honor and justice both demand he should;\n   It were unseemly to refuse his prayer.\n\n   BISHOP OF WERMELAND.\n   The documents on which he rests have been\n   Examined, and are found authentic.

Advances some steps towards the throne,\n      and makes three bows with his head uncovered, first to the KING,\n      next to the SENATORS, and then to the DEPUTIES, who all severally\n      answer with an inclination of the head. He then takes up his\n      position so as to keep within his eye a great portion of the\n      assemblage, and yet not to turn his back upon the throne.\n\n   ARCHBISHOP OF GNESEN.\n   Prince Dmitri, son of Ivan! if the pomp\n   Of this great Diet scare thee, or a sight\n   So noble and majestic chain thy tongue,\n   Thou may'st--for this the senate have allowed--\n   Choose thee a proxy, wheresoe'er thou list,\n   And do thy mission by another's lips.\n\n   DEMETRIUS.\n   My lord archbishop, I stand here to claim\n   A kingdom, and the state of royalty.\n   'Twould ill beseem me should I quake before\n   A noble people, and its king and senate.\n   I ne'er have viewed a circle so august,\n   But the sight swells my heart within my breast\n   And not appals me. The more worthy ye,\n   To me ye are more welcome; I can ne'er\n   Address my claim to nobler auditory.\n\n   ARCHBISHOP OF GNESEN.\n    . . . .         The august republic\n   Is favorably bent.     . . . .\n\n   DEMETRIUS.\n   Most puissant king! Most worthy and most potent\n   Bishops and palatines, and my good lords,\n   The deputies of the august republic!\n   It gives me pause and wonder to behold\n   Myself, Czar Ivan's son, now stand before\n   The Polish people in their Diet here.\n   Both realms were sundered by a bloody hate,\n   And, whilst my father lived, no peace might be.\n   Yet now hath Heaven so ordered these events,\n   That I, his blood, who with my nurse's milk\n   Imbibed the ancestral hate, appear before you\n   A fugitive, compelled to seek my rights\n   Even here in Poland's heart. Then, ere I speak,\n   Forget magnanimously all rancors past,\n   And that the Czar, whose son I own myself,\n   Rolled war's red billows to your very homes.\n   I stand before you, sirs, a prince despoiled.\n   I ask protection. The oppressed may urge\n   A sacred claim on every noble breast.\n   And who in all earth's circuit shall be just,\n   If not a people great and valiant,--one\n   In plenitude of power so free, it needs\n   To render 'count but to itself alone,\n   And may, unchallenged, lend an open ear\n   And aiding hand to fair humanity.\n\n   ARCHBISHOP OF GNESEN.\n   You do allege you are Czar Ivan's son;\n   And truly, nor your bearing nor your speech\n   Gainsays the lofty title that you urge,\n   But shows us that you are indeed his son.\n   And you shall find that the republic bears\n   A generous spirit. She has never quailed\n   To Russia in the field! She loves, alike,\n   To be a noble foe--a cordial friend.\n\n   DEMETRIUS.\n   Ivan Wasilowitch, the mighty Czar\n   Of Moscow, took five spouses to his bed,\n   In the long years that spared him to the throne.\n   The first, a lady of the heroic line\n   Of Romanoff, bare him Feodor, who reigned\n   After his father's death. One only son,\n   Dmitri, the last blossom of his strength,\n   And a mere infant when his father died,\n   Was born of Marfa, of Nagori's line.\n   Czar Feodor, a youth, alike effeminate\n   In mind and body, left the reins of power\n   To his chief equerry, Boris Godunow,\n   Who ruled his master with most crafty skill.\n   Feodor was childless, and his barren bride\n   Denied all prospect of an heir. Thus, when\n   The wily Boiar, by his fawning arts,\n   Had coiled himself into the people's favor,\n   His wishes soared as high as to the throne.\n   Between him and his haughty hopes there stood\n   A youthful prince, the young Demetrius\n   Iwanowitsch, who with his mother lived\n   At Uglitsch, where her widowhood was passed.\n   Now, when his fatal purpose was matured,\n   He sent to Uglitsch ruffians, charged to put\n   The Czarowitsch to death.\n   One night, when all was hushed, the castle's wing,\n   Where the young prince, apart from all the rest,\n   With his attendants lay, was found on fire.\n   The raging flames ingulfed the pile; the prince\n   Unseen, unheard, was spirited away,\n   And all the world lamented him as dead.\n   All Moscow knows these things to be the truth.\n\n   ARCHBISHOP OF GNESEN.\n   Yes, these are facts familiar to us all.\n   The rumor ran abroad, both far and near,\n   That Prince Demetrius perished in the flames\n   When Uglitsch was destroyed. And, as his death\n   Raised to the throne the Czar who fills it now,\n   Fame did not hesitate to charge on him\n   This murder foul and pitiless. But yet,\n   His death is not the business now in hand!\n   This prince is living still! He lives in you!\n   So runs your plea. Now bring us to the proofs!\n   Whereby do you attest that you are he?\n   What are the signs by which you shall be known?\n   How 'scaped you those were sent to hunt you down\n   And now, when sixteen years are passed, and you\n   Well nigh forgot, emerge to light once more?\n\n   DEMETRIUS.\n   'Tis scarce a year since I have known myself;\n   I lived a secret to myself till then,\n   Surmising naught of my imperial birth.\n   I was a monk with monks, close pent within\n   The cloister's precincts, when I first began\n   To waken to a consciousness of self.\n   My impetuous spirit chafed against the bars,\n   And the high blood of princes began to course\n   In strange unbidden moods along my veins.\n   At length I flung the monkish cowl aside,\n   And fled to Poland, where the noble Prince\n   Of Sendomir, the generous, the good,\n   Took me as guest into his princely house,\n   And trained me up to noble deeds of arms.\n\n   ARCHBISHOP OF GNESEN.\n   How? You still ignorant of what you were?\n   Yet ran the rumor then on every side,\n   That Prince Demetrius was still alive.\n   Czar Boris trembled on his throne, and sent\n   His sassafs to the frontiers, to keep\n   Sharp watch on every traveller that stirred.\n   Had not the tale its origin with you?\n   Did you not give the rumor birth yourself?\n   Had you not named to any that you were\n   Demetrius?\n\n   DEMETRIUS.\n         I relate that which I know.\n   If a report went forth I was alive,\n   Then had some god been busy with the fame.\n   Myself I knew not. In the prince's house,\n   And in the throng of his retainers lost,\n   I spent the pleasant springtime of my youth.\n                In silent homage\n   My heart was vowed to his most lovely daughter.\n   Yet in those days it never dreamed to raise\n   Its wildest thoughts to happiness so high.\n   My passion gave offence to her betrothed,\n   The Castellan of Lemberg. He with taunts\n   Chafed me, and in the blindness of his rage\n   Forgot himself so wholly as to strike me.\n   Thus savagely provoked, I drew my sword;\n   He, blind with fury, rushed upon the blade,\n   And perished there by my unwitting hand.\n\n   MEISCHEK.\n   Yes, it was even so.\n\n   DEMETRIUS.\n   Mine was the worst mischance! A nameless youth,\n   A Russian and a stranger, I had slain\n   A grandee of the empire--in the house\n   Of my kind patron done a deed of blood,\n   And sent to death his son-in-law and friend.\n   My innocence availed not; not the pity\n   Of all his household, nor his kindness--his,\n   The noble Palatine's,--could save my life;\n   For it was forfeit to the law, that is,\n   Though lenient to the Poles, to strangers stern.\n   Judgment was passed on me--that judgment death.\n   I knelt upon the scaffold, by the block;\n   To the fell headsman's sword I bared my throat,\n   And in the act disclosed a cross of gold,\n   Studded with precious gems, which had been hung\n   About my neck at the baptismal font.\n   This sacred pledge of Christian redemption\n   I had, as is the custom of my people,\n   Worn on my neck concealed, where'er I went,\n   From my first hours of infancy; and now,\n   When from sweet life I was compelled to part,\n   I grasped it as my only stay, and pressed it\n   With passionate devotion to my lips.\n\n      [The Poles intimate their sympathy by dumb show.\n\n   The jewel was observed; its sheen and worth\n   Awakened curiosity and wonder.\n   They set me free, and questioned me; yet still\n   I could not call to memory a time\n   I had not worn the jewel on my person.\n   Now it so happened that three Boiars who\n   Had fled from the resentment of their Czar\n   Were on a visit to my lord at Sambor.\n   They saw the trinket,--recognized it by\n   Nine emeralds alternately inlaid\n   With amethysts, to be the very cross\n   Which Ivan Westislowsky at the font\n   Hung on the neck of the Czar's youngest son.\n   They scrutinized me closer, and were struck\n   To find me marked with one of nature's freaks,\n   For my right arm is shorter than my left.\n   Now, being closely plied with questions, I\n   Bethought me of a little psalter which\n   I carried from the cloister when I fled.\n   Within this book were certain words in Greek\n   Inscribed there by the Igumen himself.\n   What they imported was unknown to me,\n   Being ignorant of the language. Well, the psalter\n   Was sent for, brought, and the inscription read.\n   It bore that Brother Wasili Philaret\n   (Such was my cloister-name), who owned the book,\n   Was Prince Demetrius, Ivan's youngest son,\n   By Andrei, an honest Diak, saved\n   By stealth in that red night of massacre.\n   Proofs of the fact lay carefully preserved\n   Within two convents, which were pointed out.\n   On this the Boiars at my feet fell down,\n   Won by the force of these resistless proofs,\n   And hailed me as the offspring of their Czar.\n   So from the yawning gulfs of black despair\n   Fate raised me up to fortune's topmost heights.\n   And now the mists cleared off, and all at once\n   Memories on memories started into life\n   In the remotest background of the past.\n   And like some city's spires that gleam afar\n   In golden sunshine when naught else is seen,\n   So in my soul two images grew bright,\n   The loftiest sun-peaks in the shadowy past.\n   I saw myself escaping one dark night,\n   And a red lurid flame light up the gloom\n   Of midnight darkness as I looked behind me\n   A memory 'twas of very earliest youth,\n   For what preceded or came after it\n   In the long distance utterly was lost.\n   In solitary brightness there it stood\n   A ghastly beacon-light on memory's waste.\n   Yet I remembered how, in later years,\n   One of my comrades called me, in his wrath\n   Son of the Czar. I took it as a jest,\n   And with a blow avenged it at the time.\n   All this now flashed like lightning on my soul,\n   And told with dazzling certainty that I\n   Was the Czar's son, so long reputed dead.\n   With this one word the clouds that had perplexed\n   My strange and troubled life were cleared away.\n   Nor merely by these signs, for such deceive;\n   But in my soul, in my proud, throbbing heart\n   I felt within me coursed the blood of kings;\n   And sooner will I drain it drop by drop\n   Than bate one jot my title to the crown.\n\n   ARCHBISHOP OF GNESEN.\n   And shall we trust a scroll which might have found\n   Its way by merest chance into your hands\n   Backed by the tale of some poor renegades?\n   Forgive me, noble youth! Your tone, I grant,\n   And bearing, are not those of one who lies;\n   Still you in this may be yourself deceived.\n   Well may the heart be pardoned that beguiles\n   Itself in playing for so high a stake.\n   What hostage do you tender for your word?\n\n   DEMETRIUS.\n   I tender fifty, who will give their oaths,--\n   All Piasts to a man, and free-born Poles\n   Of spotless reputation,--each of whom\n   Is ready to enforce what I have urged.\n   There sits the noble Prince of Sendomir,\n   And at his side the Castellan of Lublin;\n   Let them declare if I have spoke the truth.\n\n   ARCHBISHOP OF GNESEN.\n   How seem these things to the august Estates?\n   To the enforcement of such numerous proofs\n   Doubt and mistrust, methinks, must needs give way.\n   Long has a creeping rumor filled the world\n   That Dmitri, Ivan's son, is still alive.\n   The Czar himself confirms it by his fears.\n   --Before us stands a youth, in age and mien\n   Even to the very freak that nature played,\n   The lost heir's counterpart, and of a soul\n   Whose noble stamp keeps rank with his high claims.\n   He left a cloister's precincts, urged by strange,\n   Mysterious promptings; and this monk-trained boy\n   Was straight distinguished for his knightly feats.\n   He shows a trinket which the Czarowitsch\n   Once wore, and one that never left his side;\n   A written witness, too, by pious hands,\n   Gives us assurance of his princely birth;\n   And, stronger still, from his unvarnished speech\n   And open brow truth makes his best appeal.\n   Such traits as these deceit doth never don;\n   It masks its subtle soul in vaunting words,\n   And in the high-glossed ornaments of speech.\n   No longer, then, can I withhold the title\n   Which he with circumstance and justice claims\n   And, in the exercise of my old right,\n   I now, as primate, give him the first voice.\n\n   ARCHBISHOP OF LEMBERG.\n   My voice goes with the primate's.\n\n   SEVERAL VOICES.\n                     So does mine.\n\n   SEVERAL PALATINES.\n   And mine!\n\n   ODOWALSKY.\n         And mine.\n\n   DEPUTIES.\n              And all!\n\n   SAPIEHA.\n                   My gracious sirs!\n   Weigh well ere you decide!

He is worsted in the first action, but the army of\nthe Czar Boris conquers in a manner against its will, and does not follow\nup its advantages. Demetrius, in despair, is about to destroy himself,\nand is with difficulty prevented from doing so by Korela and Odowalsky.\nOverbearing demeanor of the Cossacks even to DEMETRIUS.\n\n\nCamp of the army of the CZAR BORIS. He is absent himself, and this\ninjures his cause, as he is feared but not loved. His army is strong,\nbut not to be relied on. The leaders are not unanimous, and partly\nincline to the side of Demetrius from a variety of motives. One of their\nnumber, Soltikow, declares for him from conviction. His adherence is\nattended with the most important results; a large portion of the army\ndeserts to DEMETRIUS.\n\n\nBORIS in Moscow. He still maintains his position as absolute ruler, and\nhas faithful servants around him; but already he is discomposed by evil\ntidings. He is withheld from joining the army by apprehension of a\nrebellion in Moscow. He is also ashamed as Czar to enter the field in\nperson against a traitor. Scene between him and the archbishop.\n\n\nBad news pours in from all sides, and Boris' danger grows momently more\nimminent. He hears of the revolt of the peasantry and the provincial\ntowns,--of the inactivity and mutiny of the army,--of the commotions in\nMoscow,--of the advance of Demetrius. Romanow, whom he has deeply\nwronged, arrives in Moscow. This gives rise to new apprehensions. Now\ncome the tidings that the Boiars are flying to the camp of Demetrius, and\nthat the whole army has gone over to him.\n\n\nBORIS and AXINIA. The Czar appears in a touching aspect as father, and\nin the dialogue with his daughter unfolds his inmost nature.\n\n\nBORIS has made his way to the throne by crime, but undertaken and\nfulfilled all the duties of a monarch; to the country he is a valuable\nprince and a true father of his people. It is only in his personal\ndealings with individuals that he is cunning, revengeful, and cruel. His\nspirit as well as his rank elevates him above all that surround him. The\nlong possession of supreme power, the habit of ruling over men, and the\ndespotic form of government, have so nursed his pride that it is\nimpossible for him to outlive his greatness. He sees clearly what awaits\nhim; but still he is Czar, and not degraded, though he resolves to die.\n\n\nHe believes in forewarnings, and in his present mood things appear to him\nof significance which, on other occasions, he had despised. A particular\ncircumstance, in which he seems to hear the voice of destiny, decides\nhim.\n\n\nShortly before his death his nature changes; he grows milder, even\ntowards the messengers of evil, and is ashamed of the bursts of rage with\nwhich he had received them before. He permits the worst to be told to\nhim, and even rewards the narrator.\n\n\nSo soon as he learns the misfortune that seals his fate, he leaves the\nstage without further explanation, with composure and resignation.\nShortly afterwards he returns in the habit of a monk, and removes his\ndaughter from the sight of his last moments. She is to seek protection\nfrom insult in a cloister; his son, Feodor, as a child, will perhaps have\nless to fear. He takes poison, and enters a retired chamber to die in\npeace.\n\nGeneral confusion at the tidings of the Czar's death. The Boiars form an\nimperial council and rule in the Kremlin. Romanow (afterwards Czar, and\nfounder of the now ruling house) enters at the head of an armed force,\nswears, on the bosom of the Czar, an oath of allegiance to his son\nFeodor, and compels the Boiars to follow his example. Revenge and\nambition are far from his soul; he pursues only justice. He loves Axinia\nwithout hope, and is, without knowing it, beloved by her in return.\n\n\nROMANOW hastens to the army to secure it for the young Czar.\nInsurrection in Moscow, brought about by the adherents of Demetrius.\nThe people drag the Boiars from their houses, make themselves masters\nof Feodor and Axinia--put them in prison, and send delegates to\nDemetrius.\n\n\nDEMETRIUS in Tula, at the pinnacle of success. The army is his own; the\nkeys of numerous towns are brought to him. Moscow alone appears to offer\nresistance. He is mild and amiable, testifies a noble emotion at the\nintelligence of the death of Boris, pardons a detected conspiracy against\nhis life, despises the servile adulations of the Russians, and is for\nsending them away. The Poles, on the other hand, by whom he is\nsurrounded, are rude and violent, and treat the Russians with contempt.\nDemetrius longs for a meeting with his mother, and sends a messenger to\nMarina.\n\n\nAmong the multitude of Russians who throng around Demetrius in Tula\nappears a man whom he at once recognizes; he is greatly delighted to see\nhim. He bids all the rest withdraw, and so soon as he is alone with this\nman he thanks him, with full heart, as his preserver and benefactor.\nThis person hints that Demetrius is under especial obligations to him,\nand to a greater extent than he is himself aware. Demetrius urges him to\nexplain, and the assassin of the genuine Demetrius thereupon discloses\nthe real facts of the case. For this murder he had received no\nrecompense, but on the contrary had nothing but death to anticipate from\nBoris. Thirsting for revenge, he stumbled upon a boy, whose resemblance\nto the Czar Ivan struck him. This circumstance must be turned to\naccount. He seized the boy, fled with him from Uglitsch, brought him to\na monk, whom he succeeded in gaining over for his ends, and delivered to\nhim the trinkets which he had himself taken from the murdered Demetrius.\nBy means of this boy, whom he had never lost sight of, and whose steps he\nhad attended upon all occasions without being observed, he is now\nrevenged. His tool, the false Demetrius, rules over Russia in Boris'\nroom.\n\n\nDuring this narration a mighty change comes over Demetrius. His silence\nis awful. In the moment of the highest rage and despair, the assassin\ndrives him to the extreme of endurance, when with a defying and insolent\nair he demands his reward. Demetrius strikes him to the earth.\n\n\nSoliloquy of Demetrius. Internal conflict; but the feeling of the\nnecessity for maintaining his position as Czar is triumphant.\n\n\nThe delegates from Moscow arrive, and submit themselves to Demetrius.\nThey are received gloomily, and with a menacing demeanor. Among them is\nthe Patriarch. Demetrius deposes him from his dignity, and soon\nafterwards sentences to death a Russian of rank, who had questioned the\nauthenticity of his birth.\n\n\nMARFA and OLGA await Demetrius under a magnificent tent. Marfa speaks of\nthe approaching interview with more doubt and fear than hope, and\ntrembles as the moment draws near which should assure her highest\nhappiness. Olga speaks to her, herself without faith. During the long\njourney they have both had time to recall the whole circumstances; the\nfirst exultation had given place to reflection. The gloomy silence and\nthe repulsive glances of the guards who surround the tent serve still\nfurther to augment their despondency.\n\n\nThe trumpets sound. Marfa is irresolute whether she shall advance to\nmeet Demetrius. Now he stands before her alone. The little that was\nleft of hope in her heart altogether vanishes on seeing him. An unknown\nsomething steps between them--Nature does not speak--they are separated\nforever. The first impulse is an endeavor to approach; Marfa is the\nfirst to make a movement to recede. Demetrius observes it, and remains\nfor a moment paralyzed. Significant silence.\n\nDEMETRIUS. Does thy heart say nothing? Dost thou not recognize thy\nblood in me?\n\n   MARFA is silent.\n\nDEMETRIUS. The voice of nature is holy and free; I will neither\nconstrain nor belie it. Had thy heart spoken at the first glance then\nhad mine answered it; thou shouldst have found a pious, loving son in me.\nThe claim of duty would have concurred with inclination and heartfelt\naffection. But if thou dost not feel as a mother for me, then, think as\na princess, command thyself as a queen! Fate unexpectedly gave me to\nthee as a son; accept me as a gift of heaven. Though even I were not thy\nson, which I now appear to be, still I rob thy son of nothing. I\nstripped it from thy foe. Thee and thy blood have I avenged; I have\ndelivered thee from the grave in which thou went entombed alive, and led\nthee back into the royal seat. That thy destiny is linked with mine thou\nknowest. With me thou standest, and with me must fall. All the people's\neyes are upon us. I hate deception, and what I do not feel I may not\nshow; but I do really feel a reverence for thee, and this feeling, which\nbends my knee before thee, comes from my heart.\n\n   [Dumb show of MARFA, to indicate her internal emotion.\n\nDEMETRIUS. Make thy resolve! Let that which nature will not prompt be\nthe free act of thy will! I ask no hypocrisy--no falsehood, from thee; I\nask genuine feelings. Do not seem to be my mother, but be so. Throw the\npast from thee--grasp the present with thy whole heart! If I am not thy\nson yet I am the Czar--I have power and success upon my side. He who\nlies in his grave is dust; he has no heart to love thee, no eye to smile\nupon thee. Turn to the living.\n\n   [MARFA bursts into tears.\n\nDEMETRIUS. Oh, these golden drops are welcome to me. Let them flow!\nShow thyself thus to the people!\n\n   [At a signal from DEMETRIUS the tent is thrown open, and\n   the assembled Russians become spectators of this scene.\n\n\nEntrance of Demetrius into Moscow. Great splendor, but of a military\nkind. Poles and Cossacks compose the procession. Gloom and terror\nmingle with the demonstrations of joy. Distrust and misfortune surround\nthe whole.\n\n\nRomanow, who came to the army too late, has returned to Moscow to protect\nFeodor and Axinia. It is all in vain; he is himself thrown into prison.\nAxinia flies to Marfa, and at her feet implores protection against the\nPoles. Here Demetrius sees her, and a violent and irresistible passion\nis kindled in his breast. Axinia detests him.\n\n\nDEMETRIUS as Czar. A fearful element sustains him, but he does not\ncontrol it: he is urged on by the force of strange passions. His inward\nconsciousness betokens a general distrust; he has no friend on whom he\ncan rely. Poles and Cossacks, by their insolent licentiousness, injure\nhim in the popular opinion. Even that which is creditable to him--his\npopular manners, simplicity, and contempt of stiff ceremonial, occasions\ndissatisfaction. Occasionally he offends, through inadvertency, the\nusages of the country. He persecutes the monks because he suffered\nseverely under them. Moreover, he is not exempt from despotic caprices\nin the moments of offended pride. Odowalsky knows how to make himself at\nall times indispensable to him, removes the Russians to a distance, and\nmaintains his overruling influence.\n\n\nDEMETRIUS meditates inconstancy to Marina. He confers upon the point\nwith the Archbishop Iob, who, in order to get rid of the Poles, falls in\nwith his desire, and puts before him an exalted picture of the imperial\npower.\n\n\nMARINA appears with a vast retinue in Moscow. Meeting with Demetrius.\nHollow and cold meeting on both sides; she, however, wears her disguise\nwith greater skill. She urges an immediate marriage. Preparations are\nmade for a magnificent festival.\n\n\nBy the orders of Marina a cup of poison is brought to Axinia. Death is\nwelcome to her; she was afraid of being forced to the altar with the\nCzar.\n\n\nViolent grief of Demetrius. With a broken heart he goes to the betrothal\nwith Marina.\n\n\nAfter the marriage Marina discloses to him that she does not consider him\nto be the true Demetrius, and never did. She then coldly leaves him in a\nstate of extreme anguish and dismay.\n\nMeanwhile SCHINSKOI, one of the former generals of the Czar Boris, avails\nhimself of the growing discontent of the people, and becomes the head of\na conspiracy against Demetrius.\n\n\nROMANOW, in prison, is comforted by a supernatural apparition. Axinia's\nspirit stands before him, opens to him a prospect of happier times in\nstore, and enjoins him calmly to allow destiny to ripen, and not to stain\nhimself with blood. ROMANOW receives a hint that he may himself be\ncalled to the throne. Soon afterwards he is solicited to take part in\nthe conspiracy, but declines.\n\n\nSOLTIKOW reproaches himself bitterly for having betrayed his country to\nDemetrius. But he will not be a second time a traitor, and adheres, from\nprinciple and against his feelings, to the party which he has once\nadopted. As the misfortune has happened, he seeks at least to alleviate\nit, and to enfeeble the power of the Poles. He pays for this effort with\nhis life; but he accepts death as a merited punishment, and confesses\nthis when dying to Demetrius himself.\n\n\nCASIMIR, a brother of LODOISKA, a young Polish lady, who has been\nsecretly and hopelessly attached to Demetrius, in the house of the\nWaywode of Sendomir, has, at his sister's request, accompanied Demetrius\nin the campaign, and in every encounter defended him bravely. In the\nmoment of danger, when all the other retainers of Demetrius think only of\ntheir personal safety, Casimir alone remains faithful to him, and\nsacrifices life in his defence.\n\n\nThe conspiracy breaks out. Demetrius is with Marfa when the leading\nconspirators force their way into the room. The dignity and courage of\nDemetrius have a momentary effect upon the rebels. He nearly succeeds in\ndisarming them by a promise to place the Poles at their disposal. But at\nthis point SCHINSKOI rushes in with an infuriated band. An explicit\ndeclaration is demanded from the ex-empress; she is required to swear,\nupon the cross, that Demetrius is her son. To testify against her\nconscience in a manner so solemn is impossible. She turns from Demetrius\nin silence, and is about to withdraw. \"Is she silent?\" exclaims the\ntumultuous throng. \"Does she disown him?\" \"Then, traitor, die!\" and\nDemetrius falls, pierced by their swords, at Marfa's feet.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Demetrius, by Frederich Schiller\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DEMETRIUS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 6790.txt or 6790.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/6\/7\/9\/6790\/\n\nProduced by Tapio Riikonen and David Widger\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":710,"split":"train"}
