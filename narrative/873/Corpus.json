It is Walpurgis Night, and in spite of the hotelier's warning to not be late back, the young man later leaves his carriage and wanders toward the direction of an abandoned \"unholy\" village. As the carriage departs with the frightened and superstitious driver, a tall and thin stranger scares the horses at the crest of a hill.\nAfter a few hours, as he reaches a desolate valley, it begins to snow; as a dark storm gathers intensity, the Englishman takes shelter in a grove of cypress and yew trees. The Englishman's location is soon illuminated by moonlight to be a cemetery, and he finds himself before a marble tomb with a large iron stake driven through the roof, the inscription reads: Countess Dolingen of Gratz \/ in Styria \/ sought and found death \/ 1801. Inscribed on the back of the tomb \"graven in great Russian letters\" is: 'The dead travel fast.' which was an ode to the fable Lenore.\nThe Englishman is disturbed to be in such a place on such a night and as the storm breaks anew, he is forced by pelting hail to shelter in the doorway of the tomb. As he does so, the bronze door of the tomb opens under his weight and a flash of forked lightning shows the interior - and a \"beautiful woman with rounded cheeks and red lips, seemingly sleeping on a bier\". The force of the following thunder peal throws the Englishman from the doorway (experienced as \"being grasped as by the hand of a giant\") as another lightning bolt strikes the iron spike, destroying the tomb and the now screaming woman inside.\nThe Englishman's troubles are not quite over, as he painfully regains his senses from the ordeal, he is repulsed by a feeling of loathing which he connects to a warm feeling in his chest and a licking at this throat. The Englishman summons courage to peek through his eyelashes and discovers a gigantic wolf with flaming eyes is attending him.\nMilitary horsemen are the next to wake the semi-conscious man, chasing the wolf away with torches and guns. Some horsemen return to the main party and Harker after the chase, reporting that they had not found 'him' and that the Englishman's animal is \"a wolf - and yet not a wolf\". They also note that blood is on the ruined tomb, yet the Englishman's neck is unbloodied. \"See comrades, the wolf has been lying on him and keeping his blood warm\". Later, the Englishman finds his neck pained when a horseman comments on it.\nWhen the Englishman is taken back to his hotel by the men, he is informed that it is none other than his expectant host Dracula that has alerted his employees, the horsemen, of \"dangers from snow and wolves and night\" in a telegram received by the hotel during the time the Englishman was away.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, Dracula's Guest, by Bram Stoker\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

To his\noriginal list of stories in this book, I have added an hitherto\nunpublished episode from _Dracula_. It was originally excised owing to\nthe length of the book, and may prove of interest to the many readers\nof what is considered my husband's most remarkable work. The other\nstories have already been published in English and American\nperiodicals. Had my husband lived longer, he might have seen fit to\nrevise this work, which is mainly from the earlier years of his\nstrenuous life. But, as fate has entrusted to me the issuing of it, I\nconsider it fitting and proper to let it go forth practically as it\nwas left by him.\n\n                         FLORENCE BRAM STOKER\n\n\n\n\nDracula's Guest\n\n\nWhen we started for our drive the sun was shining brightly on Munich,\nand the air was full of the joyousness of early summer. Just as we\nwere about to depart, Herr Delbr\u00c3\u00bcck (the ma\u00c3\u00aetre d'h\u00c3\u00b4tel of the Quatre\nSaisons, where I was staying) came down, bareheaded, to the carriage\nand, after wishing me a pleasant drive, said to the coachman, still\nholding his hand on the handle of the carriage door:\n\n'Remember you are back by nightfall. The sky looks bright but there is\na shiver in the north wind that says there may be a sudden storm. But\nI am sure you will not be late.' Here he smiled, and added, 'for you\nknow what night it is.'\n\nJohann answered with an emphatic, 'Ja, mein Herr,' and, touching his\nhat, drove off quickly. When we had cleared the town, I said, after\nsignalling to him to stop:\n\n'Tell me, Johann, what is tonight?'\n\nHe crossed himself, as he answered laconically: 'Walpurgis nacht.'\nThen he took out his watch, a great, old-fashioned German silver thing\nas big as a turnip, and looked at it, with his eyebrows gathered\ntogether and a little impatient shrug of his shoulders. I realised\nthat this was his way of respectfully protesting against the\nunnecessary delay, and sank back in the carriage, merely motioning\nhim to proceed. He started off rapidly, as if to make up for lost\ntime. Every now and then the horses seemed to throw up their heads and\nsniffed the air suspiciously. On such occasions I often looked round\nin alarm. The road was pretty bleak, for we were traversing a sort of\nhigh, wind-swept plateau. As we drove, I saw a road that looked but\nlittle used, and which seemed to dip through a little, winding valley.\nIt looked so inviting that, even at the risk of offending him, I\ncalled Johann to stop--and when he had pulled up, I told him I would\nlike to drive down that road. He made all sorts of excuses, and\nfrequently crossed himself as he spoke. This somewhat piqued my\ncuriosity, so I asked him various questions. He answered fencingly,\nand repeatedly looked at his watch in protest. Finally I said:\n\n'Well, Johann, I want to go down this road. I shall not ask you to\ncome unless you like; but tell me why you do not like to go, that is\nall I ask.' For answer he seemed to throw himself off the box, so\nquickly did he reach the ground. Then he stretched out his hands\nappealingly to me, and implored me not to go. There was just enough of\nEnglish mixed with the German for me to understand the drift of his\ntalk. He seemed always just about to tell me something--the very idea\nof which evidently frightened him; but each time he pulled himself up,\nsaying, as he crossed himself: 'Walpurgis-Nacht!'\n\nI tried to argue with him, but it was difficult to argue with a man\nwhen I did not know his language. The advantage certainly rested with\nhim, for although he began to speak in English, of a very crude and\nbroken kind, he always got excited and broke into his native\ntongue--and every time he did so, he looked at his watch. Then the\nhorses became restless and sniffed the air. At this he grew very pale,\nand, looking around in a frightened way, he suddenly jumped forward,\ntook them by the bridles and led them on some twenty feet. I followed,\nand asked why he had done this. For answer he crossed himself, pointed\nto the spot we had left and drew his carriage in the direction of the\nother road, indicating a cross, and said, first in German, then in\nEnglish: 'Buried him--him what killed themselves.'\n\nI remembered the old custom of burying suicides at cross-roads: 'Ah! I\nsee, a suicide. How interesting!' But for the life of me I could not\nmake out why the horses were frightened.\n\nWhilst we were talking, we heard a sort of sound between a yelp and a\nbark. It was far away; but the horses got very restless, and it took\nJohann all his time to quiet them. He was pale, and said, 'It sounds\nlike a wolf--but yet there are no wolves here now.'\n\n'No?' I said, questioning him; 'isn't it long since the wolves were so\nnear the city?'\n\n'Long, long,' he answered, 'in the spring and summer; but with the\nsnow the wolves have been here not so long.'\n\nWhilst he was petting the horses and trying to quiet them, dark clouds\ndrifted rapidly across the sky. The sunshine passed away, and a breath\nof cold wind seemed to drift past us. It was only a breath, however,\nand more in the nature of a warning than a fact, for the sun came out\nbrightly again. Johann looked under his lifted hand at the horizon and\nsaid:\n\n'The storm of snow, he comes before long time.' Then he looked at his\nwatch again, and, straightway holding his reins firmly--for the horses\nwere still pawing the ground restlessly and shaking their heads--he\nclimbed to his box as though the time had come for proceeding on our\njourney.\n\nI felt a little obstinate and did not at once get into the carriage.\n\n'Tell me,' I said, 'about this place where the road leads,' and I\npointed down.\n\nAgain he crossed himself and mumbled a prayer, before he answered, 'It\nis unholy.'\n\n'What is unholy?' I enquired.\n\n'The village.'\n\n'Then there is a village?'\n\n'No, no. No one lives there hundreds of years.' My curiosity was\npiqued, 'But you said there was a village.'\n\n'There was.'\n\n'Where is it now?'\n\nWhereupon he burst out into a long story in German and English, so\nmixed up that I could not quite understand exactly what he said, but\nroughly I gathered that long ago, hundreds of years, men had died\nthere and been buried in their graves; and sounds were heard under the\nclay, and when the graves were opened, men and women were found rosy\nwith life, and their mouths red with blood. And so, in haste to save\ntheir lives (aye, and their souls!--and here he crossed himself) those\nwho were left fled away to other places, where the living lived, and\nthe dead were dead and not--not something. He was evidently afraid to\nspeak the last words. As he proceeded with his narration, he grew more\nand more excited. It seemed as if his imagination had got hold of him,\nand he ended in a perfect paroxysm of fear--white-faced, perspiring,\ntrembling and looking round him, as if expecting that some dreadful\npresence would manifest itself there in the bright sunshine on the\nopen plain. Finally, in an agony of desperation, he cried:\n\n'Walpurgis nacht!' and pointed to the carriage for me to get in. All\nmy English blood rose at this, and, standing back, I said:\n\n'You are afraid, Johann--you are afraid. Go home; I shall return\nalone; the walk will do me good.' The carriage door was open. I took\nfrom the seat my oak walking-stick--which I always carry on my holiday\nexcursions--and closed the door, pointing back to Munich, and said,\n'Go home, Johann--Walpurgis-nacht doesn't concern Englishmen.'\n\nThe horses were now more restive than ever, and Johann was trying to\nhold them in, while excitedly imploring me not to do anything so\nfoolish. I pitied the poor fellow, he was deeply in earnest; but all\nthe same I could not help laughing. His English was quite gone now. In\nhis anxiety he had forgotten that his only means of making me\nunderstand was to talk my language, so he jabbered away in his native\nGerman. It began to be a little tedious. After giving the direction,\n'Home!' I turned to go down the cross-road into the valley.\n\nWith a despairing gesture, Johann turned his horses towards Munich. I\nleaned on my stick and looked after him. He went slowly along the road\nfor a while: then there came over the crest of the hill a man tall and\nthin. I could see so much in the distance. When he drew near the\nhorses, they began to jump and kick about, then to scream with terror.\nJohann could not hold them in; they bolted down the road, running away\nmadly. I watched them out of sight, then looked for the stranger, but\nI found that he, too, was gone.\n\nWith a light heart I turned down the side road through the deepening\nvalley to which Johann had objected. There was not the slightest\nreason, that I could see, for his objection; and I daresay I tramped\nfor a couple of hours without thinking of time or distance, and\ncertainly without seeing a person or a house. So far as the place was\nconcerned, it was desolation itself. But I did not notice this\nparticularly till, on turning a bend in the road, I came upon a\nscattered fringe of wood; then I recognised that I had been impressed\nunconsciously by the desolation of the region through which I had\npassed.\n\nI sat down to rest myself, and began to look around. It struck me that\nit was considerably colder than it had been at the commencement of my\nwalk--a sort of sighing sound seemed to be around me, with, now and\nthen, high overhead, a sort of muffled roar. Looking upwards I noticed\nthat great thick clouds were drifting rapidly across the sky from\nNorth to South at a great height. There were signs of coming storm in\nsome lofty stratum of the air. I was a little chilly, and, thinking\nthat it was the sitting still after the exercise of walking, I resumed\nmy journey.\n\nThe ground I passed over was now much more picturesque. There were no\nstriking objects that the eye might single out; but in all there was a\ncharm of beauty. I took little heed of time and it was only when the\ndeepening twilight forced itself upon me that I began to think of how\nI should find my way home. The brightness of the day had gone. The air\nwas cold, and the drifting of clouds high overhead was more marked.\nThey were accompanied by a sort of far-away rushing sound, through\nwhich seemed to come at intervals that mysterious cry which the driver\nhad said came from a wolf. For a while I hesitated. I had said I would\nsee the deserted village, so on I went, and presently came on a wide\nstretch of open country, shut in by hills all around. Their sides were\ncovered with trees which spread down to the plain, dotting, in clumps,\nthe gentler slopes and hollows which showed here and there. I followed\nwith my eye the winding of the road, and saw that it curved close to\none of the densest of these clumps and was lost behind it.\n\nAs I looked there came a cold shiver in the air, and the snow began to\nfall. I thought of the miles and miles of bleak country I had passed,\nand then hurried on to seek the shelter of the wood in front. Darker\nand darker grew the sky, and faster and heavier fell the snow, till\nthe earth before and around me was a glistening white carpet the\nfurther edge of which was lost in misty vagueness. The road was here\nbut crude, and when on the level its boundaries were not so marked, as\nwhen it passed through the cuttings; and in a little while I found\nthat I must have strayed from it, for I missed underfoot the hard\nsurface, and my feet sank deeper in the grass and moss. Then the wind\ngrew stronger and blew with ever increasing force, till I was fain to\nrun before it. The air became icy-cold, and in spite of my exercise I\nbegan to suffer. The snow was now falling so thickly and whirling\naround me in such rapid eddies that I could hardly keep my eyes open.\nEvery now and then the heavens were torn asunder by vivid lightning,\nand in the flashes I could see ahead of me a great mass of trees,\nchiefly yew and cypress all heavily coated with snow.\n\nI was soon amongst the shelter of the trees, and there, in comparative\nsilence, I could hear the rush of the wind high overhead. Presently\nthe blackness of the storm had become merged in the darkness of the\nnight. By-and-by the storm seemed to be passing away: it now only came\nin fierce puffs or blasts. At such moments the weird sound of the\nwolf appeared to be echoed by many similar sounds around me.\n\nNow and again, through the black mass of drifting cloud, came a\nstraggling ray of moonlight, which lit up the expanse, and showed me\nthat I was at the edge of a dense mass of cypress and yew trees. As\nthe snow had ceased to fall, I walked out from the shelter and began\nto investigate more closely. It appeared to me that, amongst so many\nold foundations as I had passed, there might be still standing a house\nin which, though in ruins, I could find some sort of shelter for a\nwhile. As I skirted the edge of the copse, I found that a low wall\nencircled it, and following this I presently found an opening. Here\nthe cypresses formed an alley leading up to a square mass of some kind\nof building. Just as I caught sight of this, however, the drifting\nclouds obscured the moon, and I passed up the path in darkness. The\nwind must have grown colder, for I felt myself shiver as I walked; but\nthere was hope of shelter, and I groped my way blindly on.\n\nI stopped, for there was a sudden stillness. The storm had passed;\nand, perhaps in sympathy with nature's silence, my heart seemed to\ncease to beat. But this was only momentarily; for suddenly the\nmoonlight broke through the clouds, showing me that I was in a\ngraveyard, and that the square object before me was a great massive\ntomb of marble, as white as the snow that lay on and all around it.\nWith the moonlight there came a fierce sigh of the storm, which\nappeared to resume its course with a long, low howl, as of many dogs\nor wolves. I was awed and shocked, and felt the cold perceptibly grow\nupon me till it seemed to grip me by the heart. Then while the flood\nof moonlight still fell on the marble tomb, the storm gave further\nevidence of renewing, as though it was returning on its track.\nImpelled by some sort of fascination, I approached the sepulchre to\nsee what it was, and why such a thing stood alone in such a place. I\nwalked around it, and read, over the Doric door, in German:\n\n               COUNTESS DOLINGEN OF GRATZ\n                        IN STYRIA\n                 SOUGHT AND FOUND DEATH\n                          1801\n\nOn the top of the tomb, seemingly driven through the solid marble--for\nthe structure was composed of a few vast blocks of stone--was a great\niron spike or stake. On going to the back I saw, graven in great\nRussian letters:\n\n          'The dead travel fast.'\n\nThere was something so weird and uncanny about the whole thing that it\ngave me a turn and made me feel quite faint. I began to wish, for the\nfirst time, that I had taken Johann's advice. Here a thought struck\nme, which came under almost mysterious circumstances and with a\nterrible shock. This was Walpurgis Night!\n\nWalpurgis Night, when, according to the belief of millions of people,\nthe devil was abroad--when the graves were opened and the dead came\nforth and walked. When all evil things of earth and air and water held\nrevel. This very place the driver had specially shunned. This was the\ndepopulated village of centuries ago. This was where the suicide lay;\nand this was the place where I was alone--unmanned, shivering with\ncold in a shroud of snow with a wild storm gathering again upon me! It\ntook all my philosophy, all the religion I had been taught, all my\ncourage, not to collapse in a paroxysm of fright.\n\nAnd now a perfect tornado burst upon me. The ground shook as though\nthousands of horses thundered across it; and this time the storm bore\non its icy wings, not snow, but great hailstones which drove with such\nviolence that they might have come from the thongs of Balearic\nslingers--hailstones that beat down leaf and branch and made the\nshelter of the cypresses of no more avail than though their stems were\nstanding-corn. At the first I had rushed to the nearest tree; but I\nwas soon fain to leave it and seek the only spot that seemed to afford\nrefuge, the deep Doric doorway of the marble tomb. There, crouching\nagainst the massive bronze door, I gained a certain amount of\nprotection from the beating of the hailstones, for now they only drove\nagainst me as they ricocheted from the ground and the side of the\nmarble.\n\nAs I leaned against the door, it moved slightly and opened inwards.\nThe shelter of even a tomb was welcome in that pitiless tempest, and I\nwas about to enter it when there came a flash of forked-lightning that\nlit up the whole expanse of the heavens. In the instant, as I am a\nliving man, I saw, as my eyes were turned into the darkness of the\ntomb, a beautiful woman, with rounded cheeks and red lips, seemingly\nsleeping on a bier. As the thunder broke overhead, I was grasped as by\nthe hand of a giant and hurled out into the storm. The whole thing was\nso sudden that, before I could realise the shock, moral as well as\nphysical, I found the hailstones beating me down. At the same time I\nhad a strange, dominating feeling that I was not alone. I looked\ntowards the tomb. Just then there came another blinding flash, which\nseemed to strike the iron stake that surmounted the tomb and to pour\nthrough to the earth, blasting and crumbling the marble, as in a burst\nof flame. The dead woman rose for a moment of agony, while she was\nlapped in the flame, and her bitter scream of pain was drowned in the\nthundercrash. The last thing I heard was this mingling of dreadful\nsound, as again I was seized in the giant-grasp and dragged away,\nwhile the hailstones beat on me, and the air around seemed reverberant\nwith the howling of wolves. The last sight that I remembered was a\nvague, white, moving mass, as if all the graves around me had sent out\nthe phantoms of their sheeted-dead, and that they were closing in on\nme through the white cloudiness of the driving hail.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGradually there came a sort of vague beginning of consciousness; then\na sense of weariness that was dreadful. For a time I remembered\nnothing; but slowly my senses returned. My feet seemed positively\nracked with pain, yet I could not move them. They seemed to be numbed.\nThere was an icy feeling at the back of my neck and all down my spine,\nand my ears, like my feet, were dead, yet in torment; but there was in\nmy breast a sense of warmth which was, by comparison, delicious. It\nwas as a nightmare--a physical nightmare, if one may use such an\nexpression; for some heavy weight on my chest made it difficult for me\nto breathe.\n\nThis period of semi-lethargy seemed to remain a long time, and as it\nfaded away I must have slept or swooned. Then came a sort of loathing,\nlike the first stage of sea-sickness, and a wild desire to be free\nfrom something--I knew not what. A vast stillness enveloped me, as\nthough all the world were asleep or dead--only broken by the low\npanting as of some animal close to me. I felt a warm rasping at my\nthroat, then came a consciousness of the awful truth, which chilled me\nto the heart and sent the blood surging up through my brain. Some\ngreat animal was lying on me and now licking my throat. I feared to\nstir, for some instinct of prudence bade me lie still; but the brute\nseemed to realise that there was now some change in me, for it raised\nits head. Through my eyelashes I saw above me the two great flaming\neyes of a gigantic wolf. Its sharp white teeth gleamed in the gaping\nred mouth, and I could feel its hot breath fierce and acrid upon me.\n\nFor another spell of time I remembered no more. Then I became\nconscious of a low growl, followed by a yelp, renewed again and again.\nThen, seemingly very far away, I heard a 'Holloa! holloa!' as of many\nvoices calling in unison. Cautiously I raised my head and looked in\nthe direction whence the sound came; but the cemetery blocked my view.\nThe wolf still continued to yelp in a strange way, and a red glare\nbegan to move round the grove of cypresses, as though following the\nsound. As the voices drew closer, the wolf yelped faster and louder. I\nfeared to make either sound or motion. Nearer came the red glow, over\nthe white pall which stretched into the darkness around me. Then all\nat once from beyond the trees there came at a trot a troop of horsemen\nbearing torches. The wolf rose from my breast and made for the\ncemetery. I saw one of the horsemen (soldiers by their caps and their\nlong military cloaks) raise his carbine and take aim. A companion\nknocked up his arm, and I heard the ball whizz over my head. He had\nevidently taken my body for that of the wolf. Another sighted the\nanimal as it slunk away, and a shot followed. Then, at a gallop, the\ntroop rode forward--some towards me, others following the wolf as it\ndisappeared amongst the snow-clad cypresses.\n\nAs they drew nearer I tried to move, but was powerless, although I\ncould see and hear all that went on around me. Two or three of the\nsoldiers jumped from their horses and knelt beside me. One of them\nraised my head, and placed his hand over my heart.\n\n'Good news, comrades!' he cried. 'His heart still beats!'\n\nThen some brandy was poured down my throat; it put vigour into me, and\nI was able to open my eyes fully and look around. Lights and shadows\nwere moving among the trees, and I heard men call to one another. They\ndrew together, uttering frightened exclamations; and the lights\nflashed as the others came pouring out of the cemetery pell-mell, like\nmen possessed. When the further ones came close to us, those who were\naround me asked them eagerly:\n\n'Well, have you found him?'\n\nThe reply rang out hurriedly:\n\n'No! no! Come away quick--quick! This is no place to stay, and on this\nof all nights!'\n\n'What was it?' was the question, asked in all manner of keys. The\nanswer came variously and all indefinitely as though the men were\nmoved by some common impulse to speak, yet were restrained by some\ncommon fear from giving their thoughts.\n\n'It--it--indeed!' gibbered one, whose wits had plainly given out for\nthe moment.\n\n'A wolf--and yet not a wolf!' another put in shudderingly.\n\n'No use trying for him without the sacred bullet,' a third remarked in\na more ordinary manner.\n\n'Serve us right for coming out on this night! Truly we have earned\nour thousand marks!' were the ejaculations of a fourth.\n\n'There was blood on the broken marble,' another said after a\npause--'the lightning never brought that there. And for him--is he\nsafe? Look at his throat! See, comrades, the wolf has been lying on\nhim and keeping his blood warm.'\n\nThe officer looked at my throat and replied:\n\n'He is all right; the skin is not pierced. What does it all mean? We\nshould never have found him but for the yelping of the wolf.'\n\n'What became of it?' asked the man who was holding up my head, and who\nseemed the least panic-stricken of the party, for his hands were\nsteady and without tremor. On his sleeve was the chevron of a petty\nofficer.\n\n'It went to its home,' answered the man, whose long face was pallid,\nand who actually shook with terror as he glanced around him fearfully.\n'There are graves enough there in which it may lie. Come,\ncomrades--come quickly! Let us leave this cursed spot.'\n\nThe officer raised me to a sitting posture, as he uttered a word of\ncommand; then several men placed me upon a horse. He sprang to the\nsaddle behind me, took me in his arms, gave the word to advance; and,\nturning our faces away from the cypresses, we rode away in swift,\nmilitary order.\n\nAs yet my tongue refused its office, and I was perforce silent. I must\nhave fallen asleep; for the next thing I remembered was finding myself\nstanding up, supported by a soldier on each side of me. It was almost\nbroad daylight, and to the north a red streak of sunlight was\nreflected, like a path of blood, over the waste of snow. The officer\nwas telling the men to say nothing of what they had seen, except that\nthey found an English stranger, guarded by a large dog.\n\n'Dog! that was no dog,' cut in the man who had exhibited such fear. 'I\nthink I know a wolf when I see one.'\n\nThe young officer answered calmly: 'I said a dog.'\n\n'Dog!' reiterated the other ironically. It was evident that his\ncourage was rising with the sun; and, pointing to me, he said, 'Look\nat his throat. Is that the work of a dog, master?'\n\nInstinctively I raised my hand to my throat, and as I touched it I\ncried out in pain. The men crowded round to look, some stooping down\nfrom their saddles; and again there came the calm voice of the young\nofficer:\n\n'A dog, as I said. If aught else were said we should only be laughed\nat.'\n\nI was then mounted behind a trooper, and we rode on into the suburbs\nof Munich. Here we came across a stray carriage, into which I was\nlifted, and it was driven off to the Quatre Saisons--the young officer\naccompanying me, whilst a trooper followed with his horse, and the\nothers rode off to their barracks.\n\nWhen we arrived, Herr Delbr\u00c3\u00bcck rushed so quickly down the steps to\nmeet me, that it was apparent he had been watching within. Taking me\nby both hands he solicitously led me in. The officer saluted me and\nwas turning to withdraw, when I recognised his purpose, and insisted\nthat he should come to my rooms. Over a glass of wine I warmly thanked\nhim and his brave comrades for saving me. He replied simply that he\nwas more than glad, and that Herr Delbr\u00c3\u00bcck had at the first taken\nsteps to make all the searching party pleased; at which ambiguous\nutterance the ma\u00c3\u00aetre d'h\u00c3\u00b4tel smiled, while the officer pleaded duty\nand withdrew.\n\n'But Herr Delbr\u00c3\u00bcck,' I enquired, 'how and why was it that the soldiers\nsearched for me?'\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders, as if in depreciation of his own deed, as\nhe replied:\n\n'I was so fortunate as to obtain leave from the commander of the\nregiment in which I served, to ask for volunteers.'\n\n'But how did you know I was lost?' I asked.\n\n'The driver came hither with the remains of his carriage, which had\nbeen upset when the horses ran away.'\n\n'But surely you would not send a search-party of soldiers merely on\nthis account?'\n\n'Oh, no!' he answered; 'but even before the coachman arrived, I had\nthis telegram from the Boyar whose guest you are,' and he took from\nhis pocket a telegram which he handed to me, and I read:\n\n\n                                                 _Bistritz_.\n\n     Be careful of my guest--his safety is most precious to me.\n     Should aught happen to him, or if he be missed, spare nothing\n     to find him and ensure his safety. He is English and therefore\n     adventurous. There are often dangers from snow and wolves and\n     night. Lose not a moment if you suspect harm to him. I answer\n     your zeal with my fortune.--_Dracula_.\n\nAs I held the telegram in my hand, the room seemed to whirl around me;\nand, if the attentive ma\u00c3\u00aetre d'h\u00c3\u00b4tel had not caught me, I think I\nshould have fallen. There was something so strange in all this,\nsomething so weird and impossible to imagine, that there grew on me a\nsense of my being in some way the sport of opposite forces--the mere\nvague idea of which seemed in a way to paralyse me. I was certainly\nunder some form of mysterious protection. From a distant country had\ncome, in the very nick of time, a message that took me out of the\ndanger of the snow-sleep and the jaws of the wolf.\n\n\n\n\nThe Judge's House\n\n\nWhen the time for his examination drew near Malcolm Malcolmson made up\nhis mind to go somewhere to read by himself. He feared the attractions\nof the seaside, and also he feared completely rural isolation, for of\nold he knew it charms, and so he determined to find some unpretentious\nlittle town where there would be nothing to distract him. He refrained\nfrom asking suggestions from any of his friends, for he argued that\neach would recommend some place of which he had knowledge, and where\nhe had already acquaintances. As Malcolmson wished to avoid friends he\nhad no wish to encumber himself with the attention of friends'\nfriends, and so he determined to look out for a place for himself. He\npacked a portmanteau with some clothes and all the books he required,\nand then took ticket for the first name on the local time-table which\nhe did not know.\n\nWhen at the end of three hours' journey he alighted at Benchurch, he\nfelt satisfied that he had so far obliterated his tracks as to be sure\nof having a peaceful opportunity of pursuing his studies. He went\nstraight to the one inn which the sleepy little place contained, and\nput up for the night. Benchurch was a market town, and once in three\nweeks was crowded to excess, but for the remainder of the twenty-one\ndays it was as attractive as a desert. Malcolmson looked around the\nday after his arrival to try to find quarters more isolated than even\nso quiet an inn as 'The Good Traveller' afforded. There was only one\nplace which took his fancy, and it certainly satisfied his wildest\nideas regarding quiet; in fact, quiet was not the proper word to apply\nto it--desolation was the only term conveying any suitable idea of its\nisolation. It was an old rambling, heavy-built house of the Jacobean\nstyle, with heavy gables and windows, unusually small, and set higher\nthan was customary in such houses, and was surrounded with a high\nbrick wall massively built. Indeed, on examination, it looked more\nlike a fortified house than an ordinary dwelling. But all these things\npleased Malcolmson. 'Here,' he thought, 'is the very spot I have been\nlooking for, and if I can get opportunity of using it I shall be\nhappy.' His joy was increased when he realised beyond doubt that it\nwas not at present inhabited.\n\nFrom the post-office he got the name of the agent, who was rarely\nsurprised at the application to rent a part of the old house. Mr.\nCarnford, the local lawyer and agent, was a genial old gentleman, and\nfrankly confessed his delight at anyone being willing to live in the\nhouse.\n\n'To tell you the truth,' said he, 'I should be only too happy, on\nbehalf of the owners, to let anyone have the house rent free for a\nterm of years if only to accustom the people here to see it inhabited.\nIt has been so long empty that some kind of absurd prejudice has grown\nup about it, and this can be best put down by its occupation--if\nonly,' he added with a sly glance at Malcolmson, 'by a scholar like\nyourself, who wants its quiet for a time.'\n\nMalcolmson thought it needless to ask the agent about the 'absurd\nprejudice'; he knew he would get more information, if he should\nrequire it, on that subject from other quarters. He paid his three\nmonths' rent, got a receipt, and the name of an old woman who would\nprobably undertake to 'do' for him, and came away with the keys in his\npocket. He then went to the landlady of the inn, who was a cheerful\nand most kindly person, and asked her advice as to such stores and\nprovisions as he would be likely to require. She threw up her hands in\namazement when he told her where he was going to settle himself.\n\n'Not in the Judge's House!' she said, and grew pale as she spoke. He\nexplained the locality of the house, saying that he did not know its\nname. When he had finished she answered:\n\n'Aye, sure enough--sure enough the very place! It is the Judge's House\nsure enough.' He asked her to tell him about the place, why so called,\nand what there was against it. She told him that it was so called\nlocally because it had been many years before--how long she could not\nsay, as she was herself from another part of the country, but she\nthought it must have been a hundred years or more--the abode of a\njudge who was held in great terror on account of his harsh sentences\nand his hostility to prisoners at Assizes. As to what there was\nagainst the house itself she could not tell. She had often asked, but\nno one could inform her; but there was a general feeling that there\nwas _something_, and for her own part she would not take all the money\nin Drinkwater's Bank and stay in the house an hour by herself. Then\nshe apologised to Malcolmson for her disturbing talk.\n\n'It is too bad of me, sir, and you--and a young gentlemen, too--if you\nwill pardon me saying it, going to live there all alone. If you were\nmy boy--and you'll excuse me for saying it--you wouldn't sleep there a\nnight, not if I had to go there myself and pull the big alarm bell\nthat's on the roof!' The good creature was so manifestly in earnest,\nand was so kindly in her intentions, that Malcolmson, although amused,\nwas touched. He told her kindly how much he appreciated her interest\nin him, and added:\n\n'But, my dear Mrs. Witham, indeed you need not be concerned about me!\nA man who is reading for the Mathematical Tripos has too much to think\nof to be disturbed by any of these mysterious \"somethings\", and his\nwork is of too exact and prosaic a kind to allow of his having any\ncorner in his mind for mysteries of any kind. Harmonical Progression,\nPermutations and Combinations, and Elliptic Functions have sufficient\nmysteries for me!' Mrs. Witham kindly undertook to see after his\ncommissions, and he went himself to look for the old woman who had\nbeen recommended to him. When he returned to the Judge's House with\nher, after an interval of a couple of hours, he found Mrs. Witham\nherself waiting with several men and boys carrying parcels, and an\nupholsterer's man with a bed in a car, for she said, though tables and\nchairs might be all very well, a bed that hadn't been aired for mayhap\nfifty years was not proper for young bones to lie on. She was\nevidently curious to see the inside of the house; and though\nmanifestly so afraid of the 'somethings' that at the slightest sound\nshe clutched on to Malcolmson, whom she never left for a moment, went\nover the whole place.\n\nAfter his examination of the house, Malcolmson decided to take up his\nabode in the great dining-room, which was big enough to serve for all\nhis requirements; and Mrs. Witham, with the aid of the charwoman,\nMrs. Dempster, proceeded to arrange matters. When the hampers were\nbrought in and unpacked, Malcolmson saw that with much kind\nforethought she had sent from her own kitchen sufficient provisions to\nlast for a few days. Before going she expressed all sorts of kind\nwishes; and at the door turned and said:\n\n'And perhaps, sir, as the room is big and draughty it might be well to\nhave one of those big screens put round your bed at night--though,\ntruth to tell, I would die myself if I were to be so shut in with all\nkinds of--of \"things\", that put their heads round the sides, or over\nthe top, and look on me!' The image which she had called up was too\nmuch for her nerves, and she fled incontinently.\n\nMrs. Dempster sniffed in a superior manner as the landlady\ndisappeared, and remarked that for her own part she wasn't afraid of\nall the bogies in the kingdom.\n\n'I'll tell you what it is, sir,' she said; 'bogies is all kinds and\nsorts of things--except bogies! Rats and mice, and beetles; and creaky\ndoors, and loose slates, and broken panes, and stiff drawer handles,\nthat stay out when you pull them and then fall down in the middle of\nthe night. Look at the wainscot of the room! It is old--hundreds of\nyears old! Do you think there's no rats and beetles there! And do you\nimagine, sir, that you won't see none of them? Rats is bogies, I tell\nyou, and bogies is rats; and don't you get to think anything else!'\n\n'Mrs. Dempster,' said Malcolmson gravely, making her a polite bow,\n'you know more than a Senior Wrangler! And let me say, that, as a mark\nof esteem for your indubitable soundness of head and heart, I shall,\nwhen I go, give you possession of this house, and let you stay here by\nyourself for the last two months of my tenancy, for four weeks will\nserve my purpose.'\n\n'Thank you kindly, sir!' she answered, 'but I couldn't sleep away\nfrom home a night. I am in Greenhow's Charity, and if I slept a night\naway from my rooms I should lose all I have got to live on. The rules\nis very strict; and there's too many watching for a vacancy for me to\nrun any risks in the matter. Only for that, sir, I'd gladly come here\nand attend on you altogether during your stay.'\n\n'My good woman,' said Malcolmson hastily, 'I have come here on purpose\nto obtain solitude; and believe me that I am grateful to the late\nGreenhow for having so organised his admirable charity--whatever it\nis--that I am perforce denied the opportunity of suffering from such a\nform of temptation! Saint Anthony himself could not be more rigid on\nthe point!'\n\nThe old woman laughed harshly. 'Ah, you young gentlemen,' she said,\n'you don't fear for naught; and belike you'll get all the solitude you\nwant here.' She set to work with her cleaning; and by nightfall, when\nMalcolmson returned from his walk--he always had one of his books to\nstudy as he walked--he found the room swept and tidied, a fire burning\nin the old hearth, the lamp lit, and the table spread for supper with\nMrs. Witham's excellent fare. 'This is comfort, indeed,' he said, as\nhe rubbed his hands.\n\nWhen he had finished his supper, and lifted the tray to the other end\nof the great oak dining-table, he got out his books again, put fresh\nwood on the fire, trimmed his lamp, and set himself down to a spell of\nreal hard work. He went on without pause till about eleven o'clock,\nwhen he knocked off for a bit to fix his fire and lamp, and to make\nhimself a cup of tea. He had always been a tea-drinker, and during his\ncollege life had sat late at work and had taken tea late. The rest\nwas a great luxury to him, and he enjoyed it with a sense of\ndelicious, voluptuous ease. The renewed fire leaped and sparkled, and\nthrew quaint shadows through the great old room; and as he sipped his\nhot tea he revelled in the sense of isolation from his kind. Then it\nwas that he began to notice for the first time what a noise the rats\nwere making.\n\n'Surely,' he thought, 'they cannot have been at it all the time I was\nreading. Had they been, I must have noticed it!' Presently, when the\nnoise increased, he satisfied himself that it was really new. It was\nevident that at first the rats had been frightened at the presence of\na stranger, and the light of fire and lamp; but that as the time went\non they had grown bolder and were now disporting themselves as was\ntheir wont.\n\nHow busy they were! and hark to the strange noises! Up and down behind\nthe old wainscot, over the ceiling and under the floor they raced, and\ngnawed, and scratched! Malcolmson smiled to himself as he recalled to\nmind the saying of Mrs. Dempster, 'Bogies is rats, and rats is\nbogies!' The tea began to have its effect of intellectual and nervous\nstimulus, he saw with joy another long spell of work to be done before\nthe night was past, and in the sense of security which it gave him, he\nallowed himself the luxury of a good look round the room. He took his\nlamp in one hand, and went all around, wondering that so quaint and\nbeautiful an old house had been so long neglected. The carving of the\noak on the panels of the wainscot was fine, and on and round the doors\nand windows it was beautiful and of rare merit. There were some old\npictures on the walls, but they were coated so thick with dust and\ndirt that he could not distinguish any detail of them, though he held\nhis lamp as high as he could over his head. Here and there as he went\nround he saw some crack or hole blocked for a moment by the face of a\nrat with its bright eyes glittering in the light, but in an instant it\nwas gone, and a squeak and a scamper followed. The thing that most\nstruck him, however, was the rope of the great alarm bell on the roof,\nwhich hung down in a corner of the room on the right-hand side of the\nfireplace. He pulled up close to the hearth a great high-backed carved\noak chair, and sat down to his last cup of tea. When this was done he\nmade up the fire, and went back to his work, sitting at the corner of\nthe table, having the fire to his left. For a little while the rats\ndisturbed him somewhat with their perpetual scampering, but he got\naccustomed to the noise as one does to the ticking of a clock or to\nthe roar of moving water; and he became so immersed in his work that\neverything in the world, except the problem which he was trying to\nsolve, passed away from him.\n\nHe suddenly looked up, his problem was still unsolved, and there was\nin the air that sense of the hour before the dawn, which is so dread\nto doubtful life. The noise of the rats had ceased. Indeed it seemed\nto him that it must have ceased but lately and that it was the sudden\ncessation which had disturbed him. The fire had fallen low, but still\nit threw out a deep red glow. As he looked he started in spite of his\n_sang froid_.\n\nThere on the great high-backed carved oak chair by the right side of\nthe fireplace sat an enormous rat, steadily glaring at him with\nbaleful eyes. He made a motion to it as though to hunt it away, but it\ndid not stir. Then he made the motion of throwing something. Still it\ndid not stir, but showed its great white teeth angrily, and its cruel\neyes shone in the lamplight with an added vindictiveness.\n\nMalcolmson felt amazed, and seizing the poker from the hearth ran at\nit to kill it. Before, however, he could strike it, the rat, with a\nsqueak that sounded like the concentration of hate, jumped upon the\nfloor, and, running up the rope of the alarm bell, disappeared in the\ndarkness beyond the range of the green-shaded lamp. Instantly, strange\nto say, the noisy scampering of the rats in the wainscot began again.\n\nBy this time Malcolmson's mind was quite off the problem; and as a\nshrill cock-crow outside told him of the approach of morning, he went\nto bed and to sleep.\n\nHe slept so sound that he was not even waked by Mrs. Dempster coming\nin to make up his room. It was only when she had tidied up the place\nand got his breakfast ready and tapped on the screen which closed in\nhis bed that he woke. He was a little tired still after his night's\nhard work, but a strong cup of tea soon freshened him up and, taking\nhis book, he went out for his morning walk, bringing with him a few\nsandwiches lest he should not care to return till dinner time. He\nfound a quiet walk between high elms some way outside the town, and\nhere he spent the greater part of the day studying his Laplace. On his\nreturn he looked in to see Mrs. Witham and to thank her for her\nkindness. When she saw him coming through the diamond-paned bay window\nof her sanctum she came out to meet him and asked him in. She looked\nat him searchingly and shook her head as she said:\n\n'You must not overdo it, sir. You are paler this morning than you\nshould be. Too late hours and too hard work on the brain isn't good\nfor any man! But tell me, sir, how did you pass the night? Well, I\nhope? But my heart! sir, I was glad when Mrs. Dempster told me this\nmorning that you were all right and sleeping sound when she went in.'\n\n'Oh, I was all right,' he answered smiling, 'the \"somethings\" didn't\nworry me, as yet. Only the rats; and they had a circus, I tell you,\nall over the place. There was one wicked looking old devil that sat up\non my own chair by the fire, and wouldn't go till I took the poker to\nhim, and then he ran up the rope of the alarm bell and got to\nsomewhere up the wall or the ceiling--I couldn't see where, it was so\ndark.'\n\n'Mercy on us,' said Mrs. Witham, 'an old devil, and sitting on a chair\nby the fireside! Take care, sir! take care! There's many a true word\nspoken in jest.'\n\n'How do you mean? Pon my word I don't understand.'\n\n'An old devil! The old devil, perhaps. There! sir, you needn't laugh,'\nfor Malcolmson had broken into a hearty peal. 'You young folks thinks\nit easy to laugh at things that makes older ones shudder. Never mind,\nsir! never mind! Please God, you'll laugh all the time. It's what I\nwish you myself!' and the good lady beamed all over in sympathy with\nhis enjoyment, her fears gone for a moment.\n\n'Oh, forgive me!' said Malcolmson presently. 'Don't think me rude; but\nthe idea was too much for me--that the old devil himself was on the\nchair last night!' And at the thought he laughed again. Then he went\nhome to dinner.\n\nThis evening the scampering of the rats began earlier; indeed it had\nbeen going on before his arrival, and only ceased whilst his presence\nby its freshness disturbed them. After dinner he sat by the fire for a\nwhile and had a smoke; and then, having cleared his table, began to\nwork as before. Tonight the rats disturbed him more than they had done\non the previous night. How they scampered up and down and under and\nover! How they squeaked, and scratched, and gnawed! How they, getting\nbolder by degrees, came to the mouths of their holes and to the chinks\nand cracks and crannies in the wainscoting till their eyes shone like\ntiny lamps as the firelight rose and fell. But to him, now doubtless\naccustomed to them, their eyes were not wicked; only their playfulness\ntouched him. Sometimes the boldest of them made sallies out on the\nfloor or along the mouldings of the wainscot. Now and again as they\ndisturbed him Malcolmson made a sound to frighten them, smiting the\ntable with his hand or giving a fierce 'Hsh, hsh,' so that they fled\nstraightway to their holes.\n\nAnd so the early part of the night wore on; and despite the noise\nMalcolmson got more and more immersed in his work.\n\nAll at once he stopped, as on the previous night, being overcome by a\nsudden sense of silence. There was not the faintest sound of gnaw, or\nscratch, or squeak. The silence was as of the grave. He remembered the\nodd occurrence of the previous night, and instinctively he looked at\nthe chair standing close by the fireside. And then a very odd\nsensation thrilled through him.\n\nThere, on the great old high-backed carved oak chair beside the\nfireplace sat the same enormous rat, steadily glaring at him with\nbaleful eyes.\n\nInstinctively he took the nearest thing to his hand, a book of\nlogarithms, and flung it at it. The book was badly aimed and the rat\ndid not stir, so again the poker performance of the previous night was\nrepeated; and again the rat, being closely pursued, fled up the rope\nof the alarm bell. Strangely too, the departure of this rat was\ninstantly followed by the renewal of the noise made by the general rat\ncommunity. On this occasion, as on the previous one, Malcolmson could\nnot see at what part of the room the rat disappeared, for the green\nshade of his lamp left the upper part of the room in darkness, and the\nfire had burned low.\n\nOn looking at his watch he found it was close on midnight; and, not\nsorry for the _divertissement_, he made up his fire and made himself\nhis nightly pot of tea. He had got through a good spell of work, and\nthought himself entitled to a cigarette; and so he sat on the great\noak chair before the fire and enjoyed it. Whilst smoking he began to\nthink that he would like to know where the rat disappeared to, for he\nhad certain ideas for the morrow not entirely disconnected with a\nrat-trap. Accordingly he lit another lamp and placed it so that it\nwould shine well into the right-hand corner of the wall by the\nfireplace. Then he got all the books he had with him, and placed them\nhandy to throw at the vermin. Finally he lifted the rope of the alarm\nbell and placed the end of it on the table, fixing the extreme end\nunder the lamp. As he handled it he could not help noticing how\npliable it was, especially for so strong a rope, and one not in use.\n'You could hang a man with it,' he thought to himself. When his\npreparations were made he looked around, and said complacently:\n\n'There now, my friend, I think we shall learn something of you this\ntime!' He began his work again, and though as before somewhat\ndisturbed at first by the noise of the rats, soon lost himself in his\npropositions and problems.\n\nAgain he was called to his immediate surroundings suddenly. This time\nit might not have been the sudden silence only which took his\nattention; there was a slight movement of the rope, and the lamp\nmoved. Without stirring, he looked to see if his pile of books was\nwithin range, and then cast his eye along the rope. As he looked he\nsaw the great rat drop from the rope on the oak arm-chair and sit\nthere glaring at him. He raised a book in his right hand, and taking\ncareful aim, flung it at the rat. The latter, with a quick movement,\nsprang aside and dodged the missile. He then took another book, and a\nthird, and flung them one after another at the rat, but each time\nunsuccessfully. At last, as he stood with a book poised in his hand to\nthrow, the rat squeaked and seemed afraid. This made Malcolmson more\nthan ever eager to strike, and the book flew and struck the rat a\nresounding blow. It gave a terrified squeak, and turning on his\npursuer a look of terrible malevolence, ran up the chair-back and made\na great jump to the rope of the alarm bell and ran up it like\nlightning. The lamp rocked under the sudden strain, but it was a heavy\none and did not topple over. Malcolmson kept his eyes on the rat, and\nsaw it by the light of the second lamp leap to a moulding of the\nwainscot and disappear through a hole in one of the great pictures\nwhich hung on the wall, obscured and invisible through its coating of\ndirt and dust.\n\n'I shall look up my friend's habitation in the morning,' said the\nstudent, as he went over to collect his books. 'The third picture from\nthe fireplace; I shall not forget.' He picked up the books one by one,\ncommenting on them as he lifted them. '_Conic Sections_ he does not\nmind, nor _Cycloidal Oscillations_, nor the _Principia_, nor\n_Quaternions_, nor _Thermodynamics_. Now for the book that fetched\nhim!' Malcolmson took it up and looked at it. As he did so he started,\nand a sudden pallor overspread his face. He looked round uneasily and\nshivered slightly, as he murmured to himself:\n\n'The Bible my mother gave me! What an odd coincidence.' He sat down to\nwork again, and the rats in the wainscot renewed their gambols. They\ndid not disturb him, however; somehow their presence gave him a sense\nof companionship. But he could not attend to his work, and after\nstriving to master the subject on which he was engaged gave it up in\ndespair, and went to bed as the first streak of dawn stole in through\nthe eastern window.\n\nHe slept heavily but uneasily, and dreamed much; and when Mrs.\nDempster woke him late in the morning he seemed ill at ease, and for a\nfew minutes did not seem to realise exactly where he was. His first\nrequest rather surprised the servant.\n\n'Mrs. Dempster, when I am out to-day I wish you would get the steps\nand dust or wash those pictures--specially that one the third from the\nfireplace--I want to see what they are.'\n\nLate in the afternoon Malcolmson worked at his books in the shaded\nwalk, and the cheerfulness of the previous day came back to him as the\nday wore on, and he found that his reading was progressing well. He\nhad worked out to a satisfactory conclusion all the problems which had\nas yet baffled him, and it was in a state of jubilation that he paid a\nvisit to Mrs. Witham at 'The Good Traveller'. He found a stranger in\nthe cosy sitting-room with the landlady, who was introduced to him as\nDr. Thornhill. She was not quite at ease, and this, combined with the\ndoctor's plunging at once into a series of questions, made Malcolmson\ncome to the conclusion that his presence was not an accident, so\nwithout preliminary he said:\n\n'Dr. Thornhill, I shall with pleasure answer you any question you may\nchoose to ask me if you will answer me one question first.'\n\nThe doctor seemed surprised, but he smiled and answered at once,\n'Done! What is it?'\n\n'Did Mrs. Witham ask you to come here and see me and advise me?'\n\nDr. Thornhill for a moment was taken aback, and Mrs. Witham got fiery\nred and turned away; but the doctor was a frank and ready man, and he\nanswered at once and openly.\n\n'She did: but she didn't intend you to know it. I suppose it was my\nclumsy haste that made you suspect. She told me that she did not like\nthe idea of your being in that house all by yourself, and that she\nthought you took too much strong tea. In fact, she wants me to advise\nyou if possible to give up the tea and the very late hours. I was a\nkeen student in my time, so I suppose I may take the liberty of a\ncollege man, and without offence, advise you not quite as a stranger.'\n\nMalcolmson with a bright smile held out his hand. 'Shake! as they say\nin America,' he said. 'I must thank you for your kindness and Mrs.\nWitham too, and your kindness deserves a return on my part. I promise\nto take no more strong tea--no tea at all till you let me--and I shall\ngo to bed tonight at one o'clock at latest. Will that do?'\n\n'Capital,' said the doctor. 'Now tell us all that you noticed in the\nold house,' and so Malcolmson then and there told in minute detail all\nthat had happened in the last two nights. He was interrupted every now\nand then by some exclamation from Mrs. Witham, till finally when he\ntold of the episode of the Bible the landlady's pent-up emotions found\nvent in a shriek; and it was not till a stiff glass of brandy and\nwater had been administered that she grew composed again. Dr.\nThornhill listened with a face of growing gravity, and when the\nnarrative was complete and Mrs. Witham had been restored he asked:\n\n'The rat always went up the rope of the alarm bell?'\n\n'Always.'\n\n'I suppose you know,' said the Doctor after a pause, 'what the rope\nis?'\n\n'No!'\n\n'It is,' said the Doctor slowly, 'the very rope which the hangman used\nfor all the victims of the Judge's judicial rancour!' Here he was\ninterrupted by another scream from Mrs. Witham, and steps had to be\ntaken for her recovery. Malcolmson having looked at his watch, and\nfound that it was close to his dinner hour, had gone home before her\ncomplete recovery.\n\nWhen Mrs. Witham was herself again she almost assailed the Doctor with\nangry questions as to what he meant by putting such horrible ideas\ninto the poor young man's mind. 'He has quite enough there already to\nupset him,' she added. Dr. Thornhill replied:\n\n'My dear madam, I had a distinct purpose in it! I wanted to draw his\nattention to the bell rope, and to fix it there. It may be that he is\nin a highly overwrought state, and has been studying too much,\nalthough I am bound to say that he seems as sound and healthy a young\nman, mentally and bodily, as ever I saw--but then the rats--and that\nsuggestion of the devil.' The doctor shook his head and went on. 'I\nwould have offered to go and stay the first night with him but that I\nfelt sure it would have been a cause of offence. He may get in the\nnight some strange fright or hallucination; and if he does I want him\nto pull that rope. All alone as he is it will give us warning, and we\nmay reach him in time to be of service. I shall be sitting up pretty\nlate tonight and shall keep my ears open. Do not be alarmed if\nBenchurch gets a surprise before morning.'\n\n'Oh, Doctor, what do you mean? What do you mean?'\n\n'I mean this; that possibly--nay, more probably--we shall hear the\ngreat alarm bell from the Judge's House tonight,' and the Doctor made\nabout as effective an exit as could be thought of.\n\nWhen Malcolmson arrived home he found that it was a little after his\nusual time, and Mrs. Dempster had gone away--the rules of Greenhow's\nCharity were not to be neglected. He was glad to see that the place\nwas bright and tidy with a cheerful fire and a well-trimmed lamp. The\nevening was colder than might have been expected in April, and a heavy\nwind was blowing with such rapidly-increasing strength that there was\nevery promise of a storm during the night. For a few minutes after his\nentrance the noise of the rats ceased; but so soon as they became\naccustomed to his presence they began again. He was glad to hear them,\nfor he felt once more the feeling of companionship in their noise, and\nhis mind ran back to the strange fact that they only ceased to\nmanifest themselves when that other--the great rat with the baleful\neyes--came upon the scene. The reading-lamp only was lit and its green\nshade kept the ceiling and the upper part of the room in darkness, so\nthat the cheerful light from the hearth spreading over the floor and\nshining on the white cloth laid over the end of the table was warm and\ncheery. Malcolmson sat down to his dinner with a good appetite and a\nbuoyant spirit. After his dinner and a cigarette he sat steadily down\nto work, determined not to let anything disturb him, for he remembered\nhis promise to the doctor, and made up his mind to make the best of\nthe time at his disposal.\n\nFor an hour or so he worked all right, and then his thoughts began to\nwander from his books. The actual circumstances around him, the calls\non his physical attention, and his nervous susceptibility were not to\nbe denied. By this time the wind had become a gale, and the gale a\nstorm. The old house, solid though it was, seemed to shake to its\nfoundations, and the storm roared and raged through its many chimneys\nand its queer old gables, producing strange, unearthly sounds in the\nempty rooms and corridors. Even the great alarm bell on the roof must\nhave felt the force of the wind, for the rope rose and fell slightly,\nas though the bell were moved a little from time to time and the\nlimber rope fell on the oak floor with a hard and hollow sound.\n\nAs Malcolmson listened to it he bethought himself of the doctor's\nwords, 'It is the rope which the hangman used for the victims of the\nJudge's judicial rancour,' and he went over to the corner of the\nfireplace and took it in his hand to look at it. There seemed a sort\nof deadly interest in it, and as he stood there he lost himself for a\nmoment in speculation as to who these victims were, and the grim wish\nof the Judge to have such a ghastly relic ever under his eyes. As he\nstood there the swaying of the bell on the roof still lifted the rope\nnow and again; but presently there came a new sensation--a sort of\ntremor in the rope, as though something was moving along it.\n\nLooking up instinctively Malcolmson saw the great rat coming slowly\ndown towards him, glaring at him steadily. He dropped the rope and\nstarted back with a muttered curse, and the rat turning ran up the\nrope again and disappeared, and at the same instant Malcolmson became\nconscious that the noise of the rats, which had ceased for a while,\nbegan again.\n\nAll this set him thinking, and it occurred to him that he had not\ninvestigated the lair of the rat or looked at the pictures, as he had\nintended. He lit the other lamp without the shade, and, holding it up\nwent and stood opposite the third picture from the fireplace on the\nright-hand side where he had seen the rat disappear on the previous\nnight.\n\nAt the first glance he started back so suddenly that he almost dropped\nthe lamp, and a deadly pallor overspread his face. His knees shook,\nand heavy drops of sweat came on his forehead, and he trembled like an\naspen. But he was young and plucky, and pulled himself together, and\nafter the pause of a few seconds stepped forward again, raised the\nlamp, and examined the picture which had been dusted and washed, and\nnow stood out clearly.\n\nIt was of a judge dressed in his robes of scarlet and ermine. His face\nwas strong and merciless, evil, crafty, and vindictive, with a sensual\nmouth, hooked nose of ruddy colour, and shaped like the beak of a bird\nof prey. The rest of the face was of a cadaverous colour. The eyes\nwere of peculiar brilliance and with a terribly malignant expression.\nAs he looked at them, Malcolmson grew cold, for he saw there the very\ncounterpart of the eyes of the great rat. The lamp almost fell from\nhis hand, he saw the rat with its baleful eyes peering out through the\nhole in the corner of the picture, and noted the sudden cessation of\nthe noise of the other rats. However, he pulled himself together, and\nwent on with his examination of the picture.\n\nThe Judge was seated in a great high-backed carved oak chair, on the\nright-hand side of a great stone fireplace where, in the corner, a\nrope hung down from the ceiling, its end lying coiled on the floor.\nWith a feeling of something like horror, Malcolmson recognised the\nscene of the room as it stood, and gazed around him in an awestruck\nmanner as though he expected to find some strange presence behind him.\nThen he looked over to the corner of the fireplace--and with a loud\ncry he let the lamp fall from his hand.\n\nThere, in the Judge's arm-chair, with the rope hanging behind, sat the\nrat with the Judge's baleful eyes, now intensified and with a fiendish\nleer. Save for the howling of the storm without there was silence.\n\nThe fallen lamp recalled Malcolmson to himself. Fortunately it was of\nmetal, and so the oil was not spilt. However, the practical need of\nattending to it settled at once his nervous apprehensions. When he had\nturned it out, he wiped his brow and thought for a moment.\n\n'This will not do,' he said to himself. 'If I go on like this I shall\nbecome a crazy fool. This must stop! I promised the doctor I would not\ntake tea. Faith, he was pretty right! My nerves must have been getting\ninto a queer state. Funny I did not notice it. I never felt better in\nmy life. However, it is all right now, and I shall not be such a fool\nagain.'\n\nThen he mixed himself a good stiff glass of brandy and water and\nresolutely sat down to his work.\n\nIt was nearly an hour when he looked up from his book, disturbed by\nthe sudden stillness. Without, the wind howled and roared louder than\never, and the rain drove in sheets against the windows, beating like\nhail on the glass; but within there was no sound whatever save the\necho of the wind as it roared in the great chimney, and now and then a\nhiss as a few raindrops found their way down the chimney in a lull of\nthe storm. The fire had fallen low and had ceased to flame, though it\nthrew out a red glow. Malcolmson listened attentively, and presently\nheard a thin, squeaking noise, very faint. It came from the corner of\nthe room where the rope hung down, and he thought it was the creaking\nof the rope on the floor as the swaying of the bell raised and lowered\nit. Looking up, however, he saw in the dim light the great rat\nclinging to the rope and gnawing it. The rope was already nearly\ngnawed through--he could see the lighter colour where the strands were\nlaid bare. As he looked the job was completed, and the severed end of\nthe rope fell clattering on the oaken floor, whilst for an instant the\ngreat rat remained like a knob or tassel at the end of the rope, which\nnow began to sway to and fro. Malcolmson felt for a moment another\npang of terror as he thought that now the possibility of calling the\nouter world to his assistance was cut off, but an intense anger took\nits place, and seizing the book he was reading he hurled it at the\nrat. The blow was well aimed, but before the missile could reach him\nthe rat dropped off and struck the floor with a soft thud. Malcolmson\ninstantly rushed over towards him, but it darted away and disappeared\nin the darkness of the shadows of the room. Malcolmson felt that his\nwork was over for the night, and determined then and there to vary the\nmonotony of the proceedings by a hunt for the rat, and took off the\ngreen shade of the lamp so as to insure a wider spreading light. As he\ndid so the gloom of the upper part of the room was relieved, and in\nthe new flood of light, great by comparison with the previous\ndarkness, the pictures on the wall stood out boldly. From where he\nstood, Malcolmson saw right opposite to him the third picture on the\nwall from the right of the fireplace. He rubbed his eyes in surprise,\nand then a great fear began to come upon him.\n\nIn the centre of the picture was a great irregular patch of brown\ncanvas, as fresh as when it was stretched on the frame. The background\nwas as before, with chair and chimney-corner and rope, but the figure\nof the Judge had disappeared.\n\nMalcolmson, almost in a chill of horror, turned slowly round, and then\nhe began to shake and tremble like a man in a palsy. His strength\nseemed to have left him, and he was incapable of action or movement,\nhardly even of thought. He could only see and hear.\n\nThere, on the great high-backed carved oak chair sat the Judge in his\nrobes of scarlet and ermine, with his baleful eyes glaring\nvindictively, and a smile of triumph on the resolute, cruel mouth, as\nhe lifted with his hands a _black cap_. Malcolmson felt as if the\nblood was running from his heart, as one does in moments of prolonged\nsuspense. There was a singing in his ears. Without, he could hear the\nroar and howl of the tempest, and through it, swept on the storm, came\nthe striking of midnight by the great chimes in the market place. He\nstood for a space of time that seemed to him endless still as a\nstatue, and with wide-open, horror-struck eyes, breathless. As the\nclock struck, so the smile of triumph on the Judge's face intensified,\nand at the last stroke of midnight he placed the black cap on his\nhead.\n\nSlowly and deliberately the Judge rose from his chair and picked up\nthe piece of the rope of the alarm bell which lay on the floor, drew\nit through his hands as if he enjoyed its touch, and then deliberately\nbegan to knot one end of it, fashioning it into a noose. This he\ntightened and tested with his foot, pulling hard at it till he was\nsatisfied and then making a running noose of it, which he held in his\nhand. Then he began to move along the table on the opposite side to\nMalcolmson keeping his eyes on him until he had passed him, when with\na quick movement he stood in front of the door. Malcolmson then began\nto feel that he was trapped, and tried to think of what he should do.\nThere was some fascination in the Judge's eyes, which he never took\noff him, and he had, perforce, to look. He saw the Judge\napproach--still keeping between him and the door--and raise the noose\nand throw it towards him as if to entangle him. With a great effort he\nmade a quick movement to one side, and saw the rope fall beside him,\nand heard it strike the oaken floor. Again the Judge raised the noose\nand tried to ensnare him, ever keeping his baleful eyes fixed on him,\nand each time by a mighty effort the student just managed to evade it.\nSo this went on for many times, the Judge seeming never discouraged\nnor discomposed at failure, but playing as a cat does with a mouse. At\nlast in despair, which had reached its climax, Malcolmson cast a quick\nglance round him. The lamp seemed to have blazed up, and there was a\nfairly good light in the room. At the many rat-holes and in the chinks\nand crannies of the wainscot he saw the rats' eyes; and this aspect,\nthat was purely physical, gave him a gleam of comfort. He looked\naround and saw that the rope of the great alarm bell was laden with\nrats. Every inch of it was covered with them, and more and more were\npouring through the small circular hole in the ceiling whence it\nemerged, so that with their weight the bell was beginning to sway.\n\nHark! it had swayed till the clapper had touched the bell. The sound\nwas but a tiny one, but the bell was only beginning to sway, and it\nwould increase.\n\nAt the sound the Judge, who had been keeping his eyes fixed on\nMalcolmson, looked up, and a scowl of diabolical anger overspread his\nface. His eyes fairly glowed like hot coals, and he stamped his foot\nwith a sound that seemed to make the house shake. A dreadful peal of\nthunder broke overhead as he raised the rope again, whilst the rats\nkept running up and down the rope as though working against time. This\ntime, instead of throwing it, he drew close to his victim, and held\nopen the noose as he approached. As he came closer there seemed\nsomething paralysing in his very presence, and Malcolmson stood rigid\nas a corpse. He felt the Judge's icy fingers touch his throat as he\nadjusted the rope. The noose tightened--tightened. Then the Judge,\ntaking the rigid form of the student in his arms, carried him over and\nplaced him standing in the oak chair, and stepping up beside him, put\nhis hand up and caught the end of the swaying rope of the alarm bell.\nAs he raised his hand the rats fled squeaking, and disappeared through\nthe hole in the ceiling. Taking the end of the noose which was round\nMalcolmson's neck he tied it to the hanging-bell rope, and then\ndescending pulled away the chair.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the alarm bell of the Judge's House began to sound a crowd soon\nassembled. Lights and torches of various kinds appeared, and soon a\nsilent crowd was hurrying to the spot. They knocked loudly at the\ndoor, but there was no reply. Then they burst in the door, and poured\ninto the great dining-room, the doctor at the head.\n\nThere at the end of the rope of the great alarm bell hung the body of\nthe student, and on the face of the Judge in the picture was a\nmalignant smile.\n\n\n\n\nThe Squaw\n\n\nNurnberg at the time was not so much exploited as it has been since\nthen. Irving had not been playing _Faust_, and the very name of the\nold town was hardly known to the great bulk of the travelling public.\nMy wife and I being in the second week of our honeymoon, naturally\nwanted someone else to join our party, so that when the cheery\nstranger, Elias P. Hutcheson, hailing from Isthmian City, Bleeding\nGulch, Maple Tree County, Neb. turned up at the station at Frankfort,\nand casually remarked that he was going on to see the most all-fired\nold Methuselah of a town in Yurrup, and that he guessed that so much\ntravelling alone was enough to send an intelligent, active citizen\ninto the melancholy ward of a daft house, we took the pretty broad\nhint and suggested that we should join forces. We found, on comparing\nnotes afterwards, that we had each intended to speak with some\ndiffidence or hesitation so as not to appear too eager, such not being\na good compliment to the success of our married life; but the effect\nwas entirely marred by our both beginning to speak at the same\ninstant--stopping simultaneously and then going on together again.\nAnyhow, no matter how, it was done; and Elias P. Hutcheson became one\nof our party. Straightway Amelia and I found the pleasant benefit;\ninstead of quarrelling, as we had been doing, we found that the\nrestraining influence of a third party was such that we now took every\nopportunity of spooning in odd corners. Amelia declares that ever\nsince she has, as the result of that experience, advised all her\nfriends to take a friend on the honeymoon. Well, we 'did' Nurnberg\ntogether, and much enjoyed the racy remarks of our Transatlantic\nfriend, who, from his quaint speech and his wonderful stock of\nadventures, might have stepped out of a novel. We kept for the last\nobject of interest in the city to be visited the Burg, and on the day\nappointed for the visit strolled round the outer wall of the city by\nthe eastern side.\n\nThe Burg is seated on a rock dominating the town and an immensely deep\nfosse guards it on the northern side. Nurnberg has been happy in that\nit was never sacked; had it been it would certainly not be so spick\nand span perfect as it is at present. The ditch has not been used for\ncenturies, and now its base is spread with tea-gardens and orchards,\nof which some of the trees are of quite respectable growth. As we\nwandered round the wall, dawdling in the hot July sunshine, we often\npaused to admire the views spread before us, and in especial the great\nplain covered with towns and villages and bounded with a blue line of\nhills, like a landscape of Claude Lorraine. From this we always turned\nwith new delight to the city itself, with its myriad of quaint old\ngables and acre-wide red roofs dotted with dormer windows, tier upon\ntier. A little to our right rose the towers of the Burg, and nearer\nstill, standing grim, the Torture Tower, which was, and is, perhaps,\nthe most interesting place in the city. For centuries the tradition of\nthe Iron Virgin of Nurnberg has been handed down as an instance of\nthe horrors of cruelty of which man is capable; we had long looked\nforward to seeing it; and here at last was its home.\n\nIn one of our pauses we leaned over the wall of the moat and looked\ndown. The garden seemed quite fifty or sixty feet below us, and the\nsun pouring into it with an intense, moveless heat like that of an\noven. Beyond rose the grey, grim wall seemingly of endless height, and\nlosing itself right and left in the angles of bastion and\ncounterscarp. Trees and bushes crowned the wall, and above again\ntowered the lofty houses on whose massive beauty Time has only set the\nhand of approval. The sun was hot and we were lazy; time was our own,\nand we lingered, leaning on the wall. Just below us was a pretty\nsight--a great black cat lying stretched in the sun, whilst round her\ngambolled prettily a tiny black kitten. The mother would wave her tail\nfor the kitten to play with, or would raise her feet and push away the\nlittle one as an encouragement to further play. They were just at the\nfoot of the wall, and Elias P. Hutcheson, in order to help the play,\nstooped and took from the walk a moderate sized pebble.\n\n'See!' he said, 'I will drop it near the kitten, and they will both\nwonder where it came from.'\n\n'Oh, be careful,' said my wife; 'you might hit the dear little thing!'\n\n'Not me, ma'am,' said Elias P. 'Why, I'm as tender as a Maine\ncherry-tree. Lor, bless ye. I wouldn't hurt the poor pooty little\ncritter more'n I'd scalp a baby. An' you may bet your variegated socks\non that! See, I'll drop it fur away on the outside so's not to go near\nher!' Thus saying, he leaned over and held his arm out at full length\nand dropped the stone. It may be that there is some attractive force\nwhich draws lesser matters to greater; or more probably that the wall\nwas not plump but sloped to its base--we not noticing the inclination\nfrom above; but the stone fell with a sickening thud that came up to\nus through the hot air, right on the kitten's head, and shattered out\nits little brains then and there. The black cat cast a swift upward\nglance, and we saw her eyes like green fire fixed an instant on Elias\nP. Hutcheson; and then her attention was given to the kitten, which\nlay still with just a quiver of her tiny limbs, whilst a thin red\nstream trickled from a gaping wound. With a muffled cry, such as a\nhuman being might give, she bent over the kitten licking its wounds\nand moaning. Suddenly she seemed to realise that it was dead, and\nagain threw her eyes up at us. I shall never forget the sight, for she\nlooked the perfect incarnation of hate. Her green eyes blazed with\nlurid fire, and the white, sharp teeth seemed to almost shine through\nthe blood which dabbled her mouth and whiskers. She gnashed her teeth,\nand her claws stood out stark and at full length on every paw. Then\nshe made a wild rush up the wall as if to reach us, but when the\nmomentum ended fell back, and further added to her horrible appearance\nfor she fell on the kitten, and rose with her black fur smeared with\nits brains and blood. Amelia turned quite faint, and I had to lift her\nback from the wall. There was a seat close by in shade of a spreading\nplane-tree, and here I placed her whilst she composed herself. Then I\nwent back to Hutcheson, who stood without moving, looking down on the\nangry cat below.\n\nAs I joined him, he said:\n\n'Wall, I guess that air the savagest beast I ever see--'cept once when\nan Apache squaw had an edge on a half-breed what they nicknamed\n\"Splinters\" 'cos of the way he fixed up her papoose which he stole on\na raid just to show that he appreciated the way they had given his\nmother the fire torture. She got that kinder look so set on her face\nthat it jest seemed to grow there. She followed Splinters mor'n three\nyear till at last the braves got him and handed him over to her. They\ndid say that no man, white or Injun, had ever been so long a-dying\nunder the tortures of the Apaches. The only time I ever see her smile\nwas when I wiped her out. I kem on the camp just in time to see\nSplinters pass in his checks, and he wasn't sorry to go either. He was\na hard citizen, and though I never could shake with him after that\npapoose business--for it was bitter bad, and he should have been a\nwhite man, for he looked like one--I see he had got paid out in full.\nDurn me, but I took a piece of his hide from one of his skinnin' posts\nan' had it made into a pocket-book. It's here now!' and he slapped the\nbreast pocket of his coat.\n\nWhilst he was speaking the cat was continuing her frantic efforts to\nget up the wall. She would take a run back and then charge up,\nsometimes reaching an incredible height. She did not seem to mind the\nheavy fall which she got each time but started with renewed vigour;\nand at every tumble her appearance became more horrible. Hutcheson was\na kind-hearted man--my wife and I had both noticed little acts of\nkindness to animals as well as to persons--and he seemed concerned at\nthe state of fury to which the cat had wrought herself.\n\n'Wall, now!' he said, 'I du declare that that poor critter seems quite\ndesperate. There! there! poor thing, it was all an accident--though\nthat won't bring back your little one to you. Say! I wouldn't have had\nsuch a thing happen for a thousand! Just shows what a clumsy fool of a\nman can do when he tries to play! Seems I'm too darned slipperhanded\nto even play with a cat. Say Colonel!' it was a pleasant way he had to\nbestow titles freely--'I hope your wife don't hold no grudge against\nme on account of this unpleasantness? Why, I wouldn't have had it\noccur on no account.'\n\nHe came over to Amelia and apologised profusely, and she with her\nusual kindness of heart hastened to assure him that she quite\nunderstood that it was an accident. Then we all went again to the wall\nand looked over.\n\nThe cat missing Hutcheson's face had drawn back across the moat, and\nwas sitting on her haunches as though ready to spring. Indeed, the\nvery instant she saw him she did spring, and with a blind unreasoning\nfury, which would have been grotesque, only that it was so frightfully\nreal. She did not try to run up the wall, but simply launched herself\nat him as though hate and fury could lend her wings to pass straight\nthrough the great distance between them. Amelia, womanlike, got quite\nconcerned, and said to Elias P. in a warning voice:\n\n'Oh! you must be very careful. That animal would try to kill you if\nshe were here; her eyes look like positive murder.'\n\nHe laughed out jovially. 'Excuse me, ma'am,' he said, 'but I can't\nhelp laughin'. Fancy a man that has fought grizzlies an' Injuns bein'\ncareful of bein' murdered by a cat!'\n\nWhen the cat heard him laugh, her whole demeanour seemed to change.\nShe no longer tried to jump or run up the wall, but went quietly over,\nand sitting again beside the dead kitten began to lick and fondle it\nas though it were alive.\n\n'See!' said I, 'the effect of a really strong man. Even that animal\nin the midst of her fury recognises the voice of a master, and bows to\nhim!'\n\n'Like a squaw!' was the only comment of Elias P. Hutcheson, as we\nmoved on our way round the city fosse. Every now and then we looked\nover the wall and each time saw the cat following us. At first she had\nkept going back to the dead kitten, and then as the distance grew\ngreater took it in her mouth and so followed. After a while, however,\nshe abandoned this, for we saw her following all alone; she had\nevidently hidden the body somewhere. Amelia's alarm grew at the cat's\npersistence, and more than once she repeated her warning; but the\nAmerican always laughed with amusement, till finally, seeing that she\nwas beginning to be worried, he said:\n\n'I say, ma'am, you needn't be skeered over that cat. I go heeled, I\ndu!' Here he slapped his pistol pocket at the back of his lumbar\nregion. 'Why sooner'n have you worried, I'll shoot the critter, right\nhere, an' risk the police interferin' with a citizen of the United\nStates for carryin' arms contrairy to reg'lations!' As he spoke he\nlooked over the wall, but the cat on seeing him, retreated, with a\ngrowl, into a bed of tall flowers, and was hidden. He went on: 'Blest\nif that ar critter ain't got more sense of what's good for her than\nmost Christians. I guess we've seen the last of her! You bet, she'll\ngo back now to that busted kitten and have a private funeral of it,\nall to herself!'\n\nAmelia did not like to say more, lest he might, in mistaken kindness\nto her, fulfil his threat of shooting the cat: and so we went on and\ncrossed the little wooden bridge leading to the gateway whence ran the\nsteep paved roadway between the Burg and the pentagonal Torture Tower.\nAs we crossed the bridge we saw the cat again down below us. When she\nsaw us her fury seemed to return, and she made frantic efforts to get\nup the steep wall. Hutcheson laughed as he looked down at her, and\nsaid:\n\n'Goodbye, old girl. Sorry I injured your feelin's, but you'll get over\nit in time! So long!' And then we passed through the long, dim archway\nand came to the gate of the Burg.\n\nWhen we came out again after our survey of this most beautiful old\nplace which not even the well-intentioned efforts of the Gothic\nrestorers of forty years ago have been able to spoil--though their\nrestoration was then glaring white--we seemed to have quite forgotten\nthe unpleasant episode of the morning. The old lime tree with its\ngreat trunk gnarled with the passing of nearly nine centuries, the\ndeep well cut through the heart of the rock by those captives of old,\nand the lovely view from the city wall whence we heard, spread over\nalmost a full quarter of an hour, the multitudinous chimes of the\ncity, had all helped to wipe out from our minds the incident of the\nslain kitten.\n\nWe were the only visitors who had entered the Torture Tower that\nmorning--so at least said the old custodian--and as we had the place\nall to ourselves were able to make a minute and more satisfactory\nsurvey than would have otherwise been possible. The custodian, looking\nto us as the sole source of his gains for the day, was willing to meet\nour wishes in any way. The Torture Tower is truly a grim place, even\nnow when many thousands of visitors have sent a stream of life, and\nthe joy that follows life, into the place; but at the time I mention\nit wore its grimmest and most gruesome aspect. The dust of ages seemed\nto have settled on it, and the darkness and the horror of its memories\nseem to have become sentient in a way that would have satisfied the\nPantheistic souls of Philo or Spinoza. The lower chamber where we\nentered was seemingly, in its normal state, filled with incarnate\ndarkness; even the hot sunlight streaming in through the door seemed\nto be lost in the vast thickness of the walls, and only showed the\nmasonry rough as when the builder's scaffolding had come down, but\ncoated with dust and marked here and there with patches of dark stain\nwhich, if walls could speak, could have given their own dread memories\nof fear and pain. We were glad to pass up the dusty wooden staircase,\nthe custodian leaving the outer door open to light us somewhat on our\nway; for to our eyes the one long-wick'd, evil-smelling candle stuck\nin a sconce on the wall gave an inadequate light. When we came up\nthrough the open trap in the corner of the chamber overhead, Amelia\nheld on to me so tightly that I could actually feel her heart beat. I\nmust say for my own part that I was not surprised at her fear, for\nthis room was even more gruesome than that below. Here there was\ncertainly more light, but only just sufficient to realise the horrible\nsurroundings of the place. The builders of the tower had evidently\nintended that only they who should gain the top should have any of the\njoys of light and prospect. There, as we had noticed from below, were\nranges of windows, albeit of mediaeval smallness, but elsewhere in the\ntower were only a very few narrow slits such as were habitual in\nplaces of mediaeval defence. A few of these only lit the chamber, and\nthese so high up in the wall that from no part could the sky be seen\nthrough the thickness of the walls. In racks, and leaning in disorder\nagainst the walls, were a number of headsmen's swords, great\ndouble-handed weapons with broad blade and keen edge. Hard by were\nseveral blocks whereon the necks of the victims had lain, with here\nand there deep notches where the steel had bitten through the guard of\nflesh and shored into the wood. Round the chamber, placed in all sorts\nof irregular ways, were many implements of torture which made one's\nheart ache to see--chairs full of spikes which gave instant and\nexcruciating pain; chairs and couches with dull knobs whose torture\nwas seemingly less, but which, though slower, were equally\nefficacious; racks, belts, boots, gloves, collars, all made for\ncompressing at will; steel baskets in which the head could be slowly\ncrushed into a pulp if necessary; watchmen's hooks with long handle\nand knife that cut at resistance--this a speciality of the old\nNurnberg police system; and many, many other devices for man's injury\nto man. Amelia grew quite pale with the horror of the things, but\nfortunately did not faint, for being a little overcome she sat down on\na torture chair, but jumped up again with a shriek, all tendency to\nfaint gone. We both pretended that it was the injury done to her dress\nby the dust of the chair, and the rusty spikes which had upset her,\nand Mr. Hutcheson acquiesced in accepting the explanation with a\nkind-hearted laugh.\n\nBut the central object in the whole of this chamber of horrors was the\nengine known as the Iron Virgin, which stood near the centre of the\nroom. It was a rudely-shaped figure of a woman, something of the bell\norder, or, to make a closer comparison, of the figure of Mrs. Noah in\nthe children's Ark, but without that slimness of waist and perfect\n_rondeur_ of hip which marks the aesthetic type of the Noah family.\nOne would hardly have recognised it as intended for a human figure at\nall had not the founder shaped on the forehead a rude semblance of a\nwoman's face. This machine was coated with rust without, and covered\nwith dust; a rope was fastened to a ring in the front of the figure,\nabout where the waist should have been, and was drawn through a\npulley, fastened on the wooden pillar which sustained the flooring\nabove. The custodian pulling this rope showed that a section of the\nfront was hinged like a door at one side; we then saw that the engine\nwas of considerable thickness, leaving just room enough inside for a\nman to be placed. The door was of equal thickness and of great weight,\nfor it took the custodian all his strength, aided though he was by the\ncontrivance of the pulley, to open it. This weight was partly due to\nthe fact that the door was of manifest purpose hung so as to throw its\nweight downwards, so that it might shut of its own accord when the\nstrain was released. The inside was honeycombed with rust--nay more,\nthe rust alone that comes through time would hardly have eaten so deep\ninto the iron walls; the rust of the cruel stains was deep indeed! It\nwas only, however, when we came to look at the inside of the door that\nthe diabolical intention was manifest to the full. Here were several\nlong spikes, square and massive, broad at the base and sharp at the\npoints, placed in such a position that when the door should close the\nupper ones would pierce the eyes of the victim, and the lower ones his\nheart and vitals. The sight was too much for poor Amelia, and this\ntime she fainted dead off, and I had to carry her down the stairs, and\nplace her on a bench outside till she recovered. That she felt it to\nthe quick was afterwards shown by the fact that my eldest son bears to\nthis day a rude birthmark on his breast, which has, by family\nconsent, been accepted as representing the Nurnberg Virgin.\n\nWhen we got back to the chamber we found Hutcheson still opposite the\nIron Virgin; he had been evidently philosophising, and now gave us the\nbenefit of his thought in the shape of a sort of exordium.\n\n'Wall, I guess I've been learnin' somethin' here while madam has been\ngettin' over her faint. 'Pears to me that we're a long way behind the\ntimes on our side of the big drink. We uster think out on the plains\nthat the Injun could give us points in tryin' to make a man\nuncomfortable; but I guess your old mediaeval law-and-order party\ncould raise him every time. Splinters was pretty good in his bluff on\nthe squaw, but this here young miss held a straight flush all high on\nhim. The points of them spikes air sharp enough still, though even the\nedges air eaten out by what uster be on them. It'd be a good thing for\nour Indian section to get some specimens of this here play-toy to send\nround to the Reservations jest to knock the stuffin' out of the bucks,\nand the squaws too, by showing them as how old civilisation lays over\nthem at their best. Guess but I'll get in that box a minute jest to\nsee how it feels!'\n\n'Oh no! no!' said Amelia. 'It is too terrible!'\n\n'Guess, ma'am, nothin's too terrible to the explorin' mind. I've been\nin some queer places in my time. Spent a night inside a dead horse\nwhile a prairie fire swept over me in Montana Territory--an' another\ntime slept inside a dead buffler when the Comanches was on the war\npath an' I didn't keer to leave my kyard on them. I've been two days\nin a caved-in tunnel in the Billy Broncho gold mine in New Mexico, an'\nwas one of the four shut up for three parts of a day in the caisson\nwhat slid over on her side when we was settin' the foundations of the\nBuffalo Bridge. I've not funked an odd experience yet, an' I don't\npropose to begin now!'\n\nWe saw that he was set on the experiment, so I said: 'Well, hurry up,\nold man, and get through it quick!'\n\n'All right, General,' said he, 'but I calculate we ain't quite ready\nyet. The gentlemen, my predecessors, what stood in that thar canister,\ndidn't volunteer for the office--not much! And I guess there was some\nornamental tyin' up before the big stroke was made. I want to go into\nthis thing fair and square, so I must get fixed up proper first. I\ndare say this old galoot can rise some string and tie me up accordin'\nto sample?'\n\nThis was said interrogatively to the old custodian, but the latter,\nwho understood the drift of his speech, though perhaps not\nappreciating to the full the niceties of dialect and imagery, shook\nhis head. His protest was, however, only formal and made to be\novercome. The American thrust a gold piece into his hand, saying:\n'Take it, pard! it's your pot; and don't be skeer'd. This ain't no\nnecktie party that you're asked to assist in!' He produced some thin\nfrayed rope and proceeded to bind our companion with sufficient\nstrictness for the purpose. When the upper part of his body was bound,\nHutcheson said:\n\n'Hold on a moment, Judge. Guess I'm too heavy for you to tote into the\ncanister. You jest let me walk in, and then you can wash up regardin'\nmy legs!'\n\nWhilst speaking he had backed himself into the opening which was just\nenough to hold him. It was a close fit and no mistake. Amelia looked\non with fear in her eyes, but she evidently did not like to say\nanything. Then the custodian completed his task by tying the\nAmerican's feet together so that he was now absolutely helpless and\nfixed in his voluntary prison. He seemed to really enjoy it, and the\nincipient smile which was habitual to his face blossomed into\nactuality as he said:\n\n'Guess this here Eve was made out of the rib of a dwarf! There ain't\nmuch room for a full-grown citizen of the United States to hustle. We\nuster make our coffins more roomier in Idaho territory. Now, Judge,\nyou jest begin to let this door down, slow, on to me. I want to feel\nthe same pleasure as the other jays had when those spikes began to\nmove toward their eyes!'\n\n'Oh no! no! no!' broke in Amelia hysterically. 'It is too terrible! I\ncan't bear to see it!--I can't! I can't!' But the American was\nobdurate. 'Say, Colonel,' said he, 'why not take Madame for a little\npromenade? I wouldn't hurt her feelin's for the world; but now that I\nam here, havin' kem eight thousand miles, wouldn't it be too hard to\ngive up the very experience I've been pinin' an' pantin' fur? A man\ncan't get to feel like canned goods every time! Me and the Judge\nhere'll fix up this thing in no time, an' then you'll come back, an'\nwe'll all laugh together!'\n\nOnce more the resolution that is born of curiosity triumphed, and\nAmelia stayed holding tight to my arm and shivering whilst the\ncustodian began to slacken slowly inch by inch the rope that held back\nthe iron door. Hutcheson's face was positively radiant as his eyes\nfollowed the first movement of the spikes.\n\n'Wall!' he said, 'I guess I've not had enjoyment like this since I\nleft Noo York. Bar a scrap with a French sailor at Wapping--an' that\nwarn't much of a picnic neither--I've not had a show fur real pleasure\nin this dod-rotted Continent, where there ain't no b'ars nor no\nInjuns, an' wheer nary man goes heeled. Slow there, Judge! Don't you\nrush this business! I want a show for my money this game--I du!'\n\nThe custodian must have had in him some of the blood of his\npredecessors in that ghastly tower, for he worked the engine with a\ndeliberate and excruciating slowness which after five minutes, in\nwhich the outer edge of the door had not moved half as many inches,\nbegan to overcome Amelia. I saw her lips whiten, and felt her hold\nupon my arm relax. I looked around an instant for a place whereon to\nlay her, and when I looked at her again found that her eye had become\nfixed on the side of the Virgin. Following its direction I saw the\nblack cat crouching out of sight. Her green eyes shone like danger\nlamps in the gloom of the place, and their colour was heightened by\nthe blood which still smeared her coat and reddened her mouth. I cried\nout:\n\n'The cat! look out for the cat!' for even then she sprang out before\nthe engine. At this moment she looked like a triumphant demon. Her\neyes blazed with ferocity, her hair bristled out till she seemed twice\nher normal size, and her tail lashed about as does a tiger's when the\nquarry is before it. Elias P. Hutcheson when he saw her was amused,\nand his eyes positively sparkled with fun as he said:\n\n'Darned if the squaw hain't got on all her war paint! Jest give her a\nshove off if she comes any of her tricks on me, for I'm so fixed\neverlastingly by the boss, that durn my skin if I can keep my eyes\nfrom her if she wants them! Easy there, Judge! don't you slack that ar\nrope or I'm euchered!'\n\nAt this moment Amelia completed her faint, and I had to clutch hold of\nher round the waist or she would have fallen to the floor. Whilst\nattending to her I saw the black cat crouching for a spring, and\njumped up to turn the creature out.\n\nBut at that instant, with a sort of hellish scream, she hurled\nherself, not as we expected at Hutcheson, but straight at the face of\nthe custodian. Her claws seemed to be tearing wildly as one sees in\nthe Chinese drawings of the dragon rampant, and as I looked I saw one\nof them light on the poor man's eye, and actually tear through it and\ndown his cheek, leaving a wide band of red where the blood seemed to\nspurt from every vein.\n\nWith a yell of sheer terror which came quicker than even his sense of\npain, the man leaped back, dropping as he did so the rope which held\nback the iron door. I jumped for it, but was too late, for the cord\nran like lightning through the pulley-block, and the heavy mass fell\nforward from its own weight.\n\nAs the door closed I caught a glimpse of our poor companion's face. He\nseemed frozen with terror. His eyes stared with a horrible anguish as\nif dazed, and no sound came from his lips.\n\nAnd then the spikes did their work. Happily the end was quick, for\nwhen I wrenched open the door they had pierced so deep that they had\nlocked in the bones of the skull through which they had crushed, and\nactually tore him--it--out of his iron prison till, bound as he was,\nhe fell at full length with a sickly thud upon the floor, the face\nturning upward as he fell.\n\nI rushed to my wife, lifted her up and carried her out, for I feared\nfor her very reason if she should wake from her faint to such a scene.\nI laid her on the bench outside and ran back. Leaning against the\nwooden column was the custodian moaning in pain whilst he held his\nreddening handkerchief to his eyes. And sitting on the head of the\npoor American was the cat, purring loudly as she licked the blood\nwhich trickled through the gashed socket of his eyes.\n\nI think no one will call me cruel because I seized one of the old\nexecutioner's swords and shore her in two as she sat.\n\n\n\n\nThe Secret of the Growing Gold\n\n\nWhen Margaret Delandre went to live at Brent's Rock the whole\nneighbourhood awoke to the pleasure of an entirely new scandal.\nScandals in connection with either the Delandre family or the Brents\nof Brent's Rock, were not few; and if the secret history of the county\nhad been written in full both names would have been found well\nrepresented. It is true that the status of each was so different that\nthey might have belonged to different continents--or to different\nworlds for the matter of that--for hitherto their orbits had never\ncrossed. The Brents were accorded by the whole section of the country\na unique social dominance, and had ever held themselves as high above\nthe yeoman class to which Margaret Delandre belonged, as a\nblue-blooded Spanish hidalgo out-tops his peasant tenantry.\n\nThe Delandres had an ancient record and were proud of it in their way\nas the Brents were of theirs. But the family had never risen above\nyeomanry; and although they had been once well-to-do in the good old\ntimes of foreign wars and protection, their fortunes had withered\nunder the scorching of the free trade sun and the 'piping times of\npeace.' They had, as the elder members used to assert, 'stuck to the\nland', with the result that they had taken root in it, body and soul.\nIn fact, they, having chosen the life of vegetables, had flourished\nas vegetation does--blossomed and thrived in the good season and\nsuffered in the bad. Their holding, Dander's Croft, seemed to have\nbeen worked out, and to be typical of the family which had inhabited\nit. The latter had declined generation after generation, sending out\nnow and again some abortive shoot of unsatisfied energy in the shape\nof a soldier or sailor, who had worked his way to the minor grades of\nthe services and had there stopped, cut short either from unheeding\ngallantry in action or from that destroying cause to men without\nbreeding or youthful care--the recognition of a position above them\nwhich they feel unfitted to fill. So, little by little, the family\ndropped lower and lower, the men brooding and dissatisfied, and\ndrinking themselves into the grave, the women drudging at home, or\nmarrying beneath them--or worse. In process of time all disappeared,\nleaving only two in the Croft, Wykham Delandre and his sister\nMargaret. The man and woman seemed to have inherited in masculine and\nfeminine form respectively the evil tendency of their race, sharing in\ncommon the principles, though manifesting them in different ways, of\nsullen passion, voluptuousness and recklessness.\n\nThe history of the Brents had been something similar, but showing the\ncauses of decadence in their aristocratic and not their plebeian\nforms. They, too, had sent their shoots to the wars; but their\npositions had been different and they had often attained honour--for\nwithout flaw they were gallant, and brave deeds were done by them\nbefore the selfish dissipation which marked them had sapped their\nvigour.\n\nThe present head of the family--if family it could now be called when\none remained of the direct line--was Geoffrey Brent. He was almost a\ntype of worn out race, manifesting in some ways its most brilliant\nqualities, and in others its utter degradation. He might be fairly\ncompared with some of those antique Italian nobles whom the painters\nhave preserved to us with their courage, their unscrupulousness, their\nrefinement of lust and cruelty--the voluptuary actual with the fiend\npotential. He was certainly handsome, with that dark, aquiline,\ncommanding beauty which women so generally recognise as dominant. With\nmen he was distant and cold; but such a bearing never deters\nwomankind. The inscrutable laws of sex have so arranged that even a\ntimid woman is not afraid of a fierce and haughty man. And so it was\nthat there was hardly a woman of any kind or degree, who lived within\nview of Brent's Rock, who did not cherish some form of secret\nadmiration for the handsome wastrel. The category was a wide one, for\nBrent's Rock rose up steeply from the midst of a level region and for\na circuit of a hundred miles it lay on the horizon, with its high old\ntowers and steep roofs cutting the level edge of wood and hamlet, and\nfar-scattered mansions.\n\nSo long as Geoffrey Brent confined his dissipations to London and\nParis and Vienna--anywhere out of sight and sound of his home--opinion\nwas silent. It is easy to listen to far off echoes unmoved, and we can\ntreat them with disbelief, or scorn, or disdain, or whatever attitude\nof coldness may suit our purpose. But when the scandal came close home\nit was another matter; and the feelings of independence and integrity\nwhich is in people of every community which is not utterly spoiled,\nasserted itself and demanded that condemnation should be expressed.\nStill there was a certain reticence in all, and no more notice was\ntaken of the existing facts than was absolutely necessary. Margaret\nDelandre bore herself so fearlessly and so openly--she accepted her\nposition as the justified companion of Geoffrey Brent so naturally\nthat people came to believe that she was secretly married to him, and\ntherefore thought it wiser to hold their tongues lest time should\njustify her and also make her an active enemy.\n\nThe one person who, by his interference, could have settled all doubts\nwas debarred by circumstances from interfering in the matter. Wykham\nDelandre had quarrelled with his sister--or perhaps it was that she\nhad quarrelled with him--and they were on terms not merely of armed\nneutrality but of bitter hatred. The quarrel had been antecedent to\nMargaret going to Brent's Rock. She and Wykham had almost come to\nblows. There had certainly been threats on one side and on the other;\nand in the end Wykham, overcome with passion, had ordered his sister\nto leave his house. She had risen straightway, and, without waiting to\npack up even her own personal belongings, had walked out of the house.\nOn the threshold she had paused for a moment to hurl a bitter threat\nat Wykham that he would rue in shame and despair to the last hour of\nhis life his act of that day. Some weeks had since passed; and it was\nunderstood in the neighbourhood that Margaret had gone to London, when\nshe suddenly appeared driving out with Geoffrey Brent, and the entire\nneighbourhood knew before nightfall that she had taken up her abode at\nthe Rock. It was no subject of surprise that Brent had come back\nunexpectedly, for such was his usual custom. Even his own servants\nnever knew when to expect him, for there was a private door, of which\nhe alone had the key, by which he sometimes entered without anyone in\nthe house being aware of his coming. This was his usual method of\nappearing after a long absence.\n\nWykham Delandre was furious at the news. He vowed vengeance--and to\nkeep his mind level with his passion drank deeper than ever. He tried\nseveral times to see his sister, but she contemptuously refused to\nmeet him. He tried to have an interview with Brent and was refused by\nhim also. Then he tried to stop him in the road, but without avail,\nfor Geoffrey was not a man to be stopped against his will. Several\nactual encounters took place between the two men, and many more were\nthreatened and avoided. At last Wykham Delandre settled down to a\nmorose, vengeful acceptance of the situation.\n\nNeither Margaret nor Geoffrey was of a pacific temperament, and it was\nnot long before there began to be quarrels between them. One thing\nwould lead to another, and wine flowed freely at Brent's Rock. Now and\nagain the quarrels would assume a bitter aspect, and threats would be\nexchanged in uncompromising language that fairly awed the listening\nservants. But such quarrels generally ended where domestic\naltercations do, in reconciliation, and in a mutual respect for the\nfighting qualities proportionate to their manifestation. Fighting for\nits own sake is found by a certain class of persons, all the world\nover, to be a matter of absorbing interest, and there is no reason to\nbelieve that domestic conditions minimise its potency. Geoffrey and\nMargaret made occasional absences from Brent's Rock, and on each of\nthese occasions Wykham Delandre also absented himself; but as he\ngenerally heard of the absence too late to be of any service, he\nreturned home each time in a more bitter and discontented frame of\nmind than before.\n\nAt last there came a time when the absence from Brent's Rock became\nlonger than before. Only a few days earlier there had been a quarrel,\nexceeding in bitterness anything which had gone before; but this, too,\nhad been made up, and a trip on the Continent had been mentioned\nbefore the servants. After a few days Wykham Delandre also went away,\nand it was some weeks before he returned. It was noticed that he was\nfull of some new importance--satisfaction, exaltation--they hardly\nknew how to call it. He went straightway to Brent's Rock, and demanded\nto see Geoffrey Brent, and on being told that he had not yet returned,\nsaid, with a grim decision which the servants noted:\n\n'I shall come again. My news is solid--it can wait!' and turned away.\nWeek after week went by, and month after month; and then there came a\nrumour, certified later on, that an accident had occurred in the\nZermatt valley. Whilst crossing a dangerous pass the carriage\ncontaining an English lady and the driver had fallen over a precipice,\nthe gentleman of the party, Mr. Geoffrey Brent, having been\nfortunately saved as he had been walking up the hill to ease the\nhorses. He gave information, and search was made. The broken rail, the\nexcoriated roadway, the marks where the horses had struggled on the\ndecline before finally pitching over into the torrent--all told the\nsad tale. It was a wet season, and there had been much snow in the\nwinter, so that the river was swollen beyond its usual volume, and the\neddies of the stream were packed with ice. All search was made, and\nfinally the wreck of the carriage and the body of one horse were found\nin an eddy of the river. Later on the body of the driver was found on\nthe sandy, torrent-swept waste near T\u00c3\u00a4sch; but the body of the lady,\nlike that of the other horse, had quite disappeared, and was--what\nwas left of it by that time--whirling amongst the eddies of the Rhone\non its way down to the Lake of Geneva.\n\nWykham Delandre made all the enquiries possible, but could not find\nany trace of the missing woman. He found, however, in the books of the\nvarious hotels the name of 'Mr. and Mrs. Geoffrey Brent'. And he had a\nstone erected at Zermatt to his sister's memory, under her married\nname, and a tablet put up in the church at Bretten, the parish in\nwhich both Brent's Rock and Dander's Croft were situated.\n\nThere was a lapse of nearly a year, after the excitement of the matter\nhad worn away, and the whole neighbourhood had gone on its accustomed\nway. Brent was still absent, and Delandre more drunken, more morose,\nand more revengeful than before.\n\nThen there was a new excitement. Brent's Rock was being made ready for\na new mistress. It was officially announced by Geoffrey himself in a\nletter to the Vicar, that he had been married some months before to an\nItalian lady, and that they were then on their way home. Then a small\narmy of workmen invaded the house; and hammer and plane sounded, and a\ngeneral air of size and paint pervaded the atmosphere. One wing of the\nold house, the south, was entirely re-done; and then the great body of\nthe workmen departed, leaving only materials for the doing of the old\nhall when Geoffrey Brent should have returned, for he had directed\nthat the decoration was only to be done under his own eyes. He had\nbrought with him accurate drawings of a hall in the house of his\nbride's father, for he wished to reproduce for her the place to which\nshe had been accustomed. As the moulding had all to be re-done, some\nscaffolding poles and boards were brought in and laid on one side of\nthe great hall, and also a great wooden tank or box for mixing the\nlime, which was laid in bags beside it.\n\nWhen the new mistress of Brent's Rock arrived the bells of the church\nrang out, and there was a general jubilation. She was a beautiful\ncreature, full of the poetry and fire and passion of the South; and\nthe few English words which she had learned were spoken in such a\nsweet and pretty broken way that she won the hearts of the people\nalmost as much by the music of her voice as by the melting beauty of\nher dark eyes.\n\nGeoffrey Brent seemed more happy than he had ever before appeared; but\nthere was a dark, anxious look on his face that was new to those who\nknew him of old, and he started at times as though at some noise that\nwas unheard by others.\n\nAnd so months passed and the whisper grew that at last Brent's Rock\nwas to have an heir. Geoffrey was very tender to his wife, and the new\nbond between them seemed to soften him. He took more interest in his\ntenants and their needs than he had ever done; and works of charity on\nhis part as well as on his sweet young wife's were not lacking. He\nseemed to have set all his hopes on the child that was coming, and as\nhe looked deeper into the future the dark shadow that had come over\nhis face seemed to die gradually away.\n\nAll the time Wykham Delandre nursed his revenge. Deep in his heart had\ngrown up a purpose of vengeance which only waited an opportunity to\ncrystallise and take a definite shape. His vague idea was somehow\ncentred in the wife of Brent, for he knew that he could strike him\nbest through those he loved, and the coming time seemed to hold in its\nwomb the opportunity for which he longed. One night he sat alone in\nthe living-room of his house. It had once been a handsome room in its\nway, but time and neglect had done their work and it was now little\nbetter than a ruin, without dignity or picturesqueness of any kind. He\nhad been drinking heavily for some time and was more than half\nstupefied. He thought he heard a noise as of someone at the door and\nlooked up. Then he called half savagely to come in; but there was no\nresponse. With a muttered blasphemy he renewed his potations.\nPresently he forgot all around him, sank into a daze, but suddenly\nawoke to see standing before him someone or something like a battered,\nghostly edition of his sister. For a few moments there came upon him a\nsort of fear. The woman before him, with distorted features and\nburning eyes seemed hardly human, and the only thing that seemed a\nreality of his sister, as she had been, was her wealth of golden hair,\nand this was now streaked with grey. She eyed her brother with a long,\ncold stare; and he, too, as he looked and began to realise the\nactuality of her presence, found the hatred of her which he had had,\nonce again surging up in his heart. All the brooding passion of the\npast year seemed to find a voice at once as he asked her:\n\n'Why are you here? You're dead and buried.'\n\n'I am here, Wykham Delandre, for no love of you, but because I hate\nanother even more than I do you!' A great passion blazed in her eyes.\n\n'Him?' he asked, in so fierce a whisper that even the woman was for an\ninstant startled till she regained her calm.\n\n'Yes, him!' she answered. 'But make no mistake, my revenge is my own;\nand I merely use you to help me to it.' Wykham asked suddenly:\n\n'Did he marry you?'\n\nThe woman's distorted face broadened out in a ghastly attempt at a\nsmile. It was a hideous mockery, for the broken features and seamed\nscars took strange shapes and strange colours, and queer lines of\nwhite showed out as the straining muscles pressed on the old\ncicatrices.\n\n'So you would like to know! It would please your pride to feel that\nyour sister was truly married! Well, you shall not know. That was my\nrevenge on you, and I do not mean to change it by a hair's breadth. I\nhave come here tonight simply to let you know that I am alive, so that\nif any violence be done me where I am going there may be a witness.'\n\n'Where are you going?' demanded her brother.\n\n'That is my affair! and I have not the least intention of letting you\nknow!' Wykham stood up, but the drink was on him and he reeled and\nfell. As he lay on the floor he announced his intention of following\nhis sister; and with an outburst of splenetic humour told her that he\nwould follow her through the darkness by the light of her hair, and of\nher beauty. At this she turned on him, and said that there were others\nbeside him that would rue her hair and her beauty too. 'As he will,'\nshe hissed; 'for the hair remains though the beauty be gone. When he\nwithdrew the lynch-pin and sent us over the precipice into the\ntorrent, he had little thought of my beauty. Perhaps his beauty would\nbe scarred like mine were he whirled, as I was, among the rocks of the\nVisp, and frozen on the ice pack in the drift of the river. But let\nhim beware! His time is coming!' and with a fierce gesture she flung\nopen the door and passed out into the night.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLater on that night, Mrs. Brent, who was but half-asleep, became\nsuddenly awake and spoke to her husband:\n\n'Geoffrey, was not that the click of a lock somewhere below our\nwindow?'\n\nBut Geoffrey--though she thought that he, too, had started at the\nnoise--seemed sound asleep, and breathed heavily. Again Mrs. Brent\ndozed; but this time awoke to the fact that her husband had arisen and\nwas partially dressed. He was deadly pale, and when the light of the\nlamp which he had in his hand fell on his face, she was frightened at\nthe look in his eyes.\n\n'What is it, Geoffrey? What dost thou?' she asked.\n\n'Hush! little one,' he answered, in a strange, hoarse voice. 'Go to\nsleep. I am restless, and wish to finish some work I left undone.'\n\n'Bring it here, my husband,' she said; 'I am lonely and I fear when\nthou art away.'\n\nFor reply he merely kissed her and went out, closing the door behind\nhim. She lay awake for awhile, and then nature asserted itself, and\nshe slept.\n\nSuddenly she started broad awake with the memory in her ears of a\nsmothered cry from somewhere not far off. She jumped up and ran to the\ndoor and listened, but there was no sound. She grew alarmed for her\nhusband, and called out: 'Geoffrey! Geoffrey!'\n\nAfter a few moments the door of the great hall opened, and Geoffrey\nappeared at it, but without his lamp.\n\n'Hush!' he said, in a sort of whisper, and his voice was harsh and\nstern. 'Hush! Get to bed! I am working, and must not be disturbed. Go\nto sleep, and do not wake the house!'\n\nWith a chill in her heart--for the harshness of her husband's voice\nwas new to her--she crept back to bed and lay there trembling, too\nfrightened to cry, and listened to every sound. There was a long pause\nof silence, and then the sound of some iron implement striking muffled\nblows! Then there came a clang of a heavy stone falling, followed by a\nmuffled curse. Then a dragging sound, and then more noise of stone on\nstone. She lay all the while in an agony of fear, and her heart beat\ndreadfully. She heard a curious sort of scraping sound; and then there\nwas silence. Presently the door opened gently, and Geoffrey appeared.\nHis wife pretended to be asleep; but through her eyelashes she saw him\nwash from his hands something white that looked like lime.\n\nIn the morning he made no allusion to the previous night, and she was\nafraid to ask any question.\n\nFrom that day there seemed some shadow over Geoffrey Brent. He neither\nate nor slept as he had been accustomed, and his former habit of\nturning suddenly as though someone were speaking from behind him\nrevived. The old hall seemed to have some kind of fascination for him.\nHe used to go there many times in the day, but grew impatient if\nanyone, even his wife, entered it. When the builder's foreman came to\ninquire about continuing his work Geoffrey was out driving; the man\nwent into the hall, and when Geoffrey returned the servant told him of\nhis arrival and where he was. With a frightful oath he pushed the\nservant aside and hurried up to the old hall. The workman met him\nalmost at the door; and as Geoffrey burst into the room he ran against\nhim. The man apologised:\n\n'Beg pardon, sir, but I was just going out to make some enquiries. I\ndirected twelve sacks of lime to be sent here, but I see there are\nonly ten.'\n\n'Damn the ten sacks and the twelve too!' was the ungracious and\nincomprehensible rejoinder.\n\nThe workman looked surprised, and tried to turn the conversation.\n\n'I see, sir, there is a little matter which our people must have done;\nbut the governor will of course see it set right at his own cost.'\n\n'What do you mean?'\n\n'That 'ere 'arth-stone, sir: Some idiot must have put a scaffold pole\non it and cracked it right down the middle, and it's thick enough\nyou'd think to stand hanythink.' Geoffrey was silent for quite a\nminute, and then said in a constrained voice and with much gentler\nmanner:\n\n'Tell your people that I am not going on with the work in the hall at\npresent. I want to leave it as it is for a while longer.'\n\n'All right sir. I'll send up a few of our chaps to take away these\npoles and lime bags and tidy the place up a bit.'\n\n'No! No!' said Geoffrey, 'leave them where they are. I shall send and\ntell you when you are to get on with the work.' So the foreman went\naway, and his comment to his master was:\n\n'I'd send in the bill, sir, for the work already done. 'Pears to me\nthat money's a little shaky in that quarter.'\n\nOnce or twice Delandre tried to stop Brent on the road, and, at last,\nfinding that he could not attain his object rode after the carriage,\ncalling out:\n\n'What has become of my sister, your wife?' Geoffrey lashed his horses\ninto a gallop, and the other, seeing from his white face and from his\nwife's collapse almost into a faint that his object was attained, rode\naway with a scowl and a laugh.\n\nThat night when Geoffrey went into the hall he passed over to the\ngreat fireplace, and all at once started back with a smothered cry.\nThen with an effort he pulled himself together and went away,\nreturning with a light. He bent down over the broken hearth-stone to\nsee if the moonlight falling through the storied window had in any way\ndeceived him. Then with a groan of anguish he sank to his knees.\n\nThere, sure enough, through the crack in the broken stone were\nprotruding a multitude of threads of golden hair just tinged with\ngrey!\n\nHe was disturbed by a noise at the door, and looking round, saw his\nwife standing in the doorway. In the desperation of the moment he took\naction to prevent discovery, and lighting a match at the lamp, stooped\ndown and burned away the hair that rose through the broken stone. Then\nrising nonchalantly as he could, he pretended surprise at seeing his\nwife beside him.\n\nFor the next week he lived in an agony; for, whether by accident or\ndesign, he could not find himself alone in the hall for any length of\ntime. At each visit the hair had grown afresh through the crack, and\nhe had to watch it carefully lest his terrible secret should be\ndiscovered. He tried to find a receptacle for the body of the murdered\nwoman outside the house, but someone always interrupted him; and once,\nwhen he was coming out of the private doorway, he was met by his wife,\nwho began to question him about it, and manifested surprise that she\nshould not have before noticed the key which he now reluctantly showed\nher. Geoffrey dearly and passionately loved his wife, so that any\npossibility of her discovering his dread secrets, or even of doubting\nhim, filled him with anguish; and after a couple of days had passed,\nhe could not help coming to the conclusion that, at least, she\nsuspected something.\n\nThat very evening she came into the hall after her drive and found him\nthere sitting moodily by the deserted fireplace. She spoke to him\ndirectly.\n\n'Geoffrey, I have been spoken to by that fellow Delandre, and he says\nhorrible things. He tells to me that a week ago his sister returned to\nhis house, the wreck and ruin of her former self, with only her golden\nhair as of old, and announced some fell intention. He asked me where\nshe is--and oh, Geoffrey, she is dead, she is dead! So how can she\nhave returned? Oh! I am in dread, and I know not where to turn!'\n\nFor answer, Geoffrey burst into a torrent of blasphemy which made her\nshudder. He cursed Delandre and his sister and all their kind, and in\nespecial he hurled curse after curse on her golden hair.\n\n'Oh, hush! hush!' she said, and was then silent, for she feared her\nhusband when she saw the evil effect of his humour. Geoffrey in the\ntorrent of his anger stood up and moved away from the hearth; but\nsuddenly stopped as he saw a new look of terror in his wife's eyes. He\nfollowed their glance, and then he too, shuddered--for there on the\nbroken hearth-stone lay a golden streak as the point of the hair rose\nthough the crack.\n\n'Look, look!' she shrieked. 'Is it some ghost of the dead! Come\naway--come away!' and seizing her husband by the wrist with the frenzy\nof madness, she pulled him from the room.\n\nThat night she was in a raging fever. The doctor of the district\nattended her at once, and special aid was telegraphed for to London.\nGeoffrey was in despair, and in his anguish at the danger of his young\nwife almost forgot his own crime and its consequences. In the evening\nthe doctor had to leave to attend to others; but he left Geoffrey in\ncharge of his wife. His last words were:\n\n'Remember, you must humour her till I come in the morning, or till\nsome other doctor has her case in hand. What you have to dread is\nanother attack of emotion. See that she is kept warm. Nothing more can\nbe done.'\n\nLate in the evening, when the rest of the household had retired,\nGeoffrey's wife got up from her bed and called to her husband.\n\n'Come!' she said. 'Come to the old hall! I know where the gold comes\nfrom! I want to see it grow!'\n\nGeoffrey would fain have stopped her, but he feared for her life or\nreason on the one hand, and lest in a paroxysm she should shriek out\nher terrible suspicion, and seeing that it was useless to try to\nprevent her, wrapped a warm rug around her and went with her to the\nold hall. When they entered, she turned and shut the door and locked\nit.\n\n'We want no strangers amongst us three tonight!' she whispered with a\nwan smile.\n\n'We three! nay we are but two,' said Geoffrey with a shudder; he\nfeared to say more.\n\n'Sit here,' said his wife as she put out the light. 'Sit here by the\nhearth and watch the gold growing. The silver moonlight is jealous!\nSee, it steals along the floor towards the gold--our gold!' Geoffrey\nlooked with growing horror, and saw that during the hours that had\npassed the golden hair had protruded further through the broken\nhearth-stone. He tried to hide it by placing his feet over the broken\nplace; and his wife, drawing her chair beside him, leant over and\nlaid her head on his shoulder.\n\n'Now do not stir, dear,' she said; 'let us sit still and watch. We\nshall find the secret of the growing gold!' He passed his arm round\nher and sat silent; and as the moonlight stole along the floor she\nsank to sleep.\n\nHe feared to wake her; and so sat silent and miserable as the hours\nstole away.\n\nBefore his horror-struck eyes the golden-hair from the broken stone\ngrew and grew; and as it increased, so his heart got colder and\ncolder, till at last he had not power to stir, and sat with eyes full\nof terror watching his doom.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the morning when the London doctor came, neither Geoffrey nor his\nwife could be found. Search was made in all the rooms, but without\navail. As a last resource the great door of the old hall was broken\nopen, and those who entered saw a grim and sorry sight.\n\nThere by the deserted hearth Geoffrey Brent and his young wife sat\ncold and white and dead. Her face was peaceful, and her eyes were\nclosed in sleep; but his face was a sight that made all who saw it\nshudder, for there was on it a look of unutterable horror. The eyes\nwere open and stared glassily at his feet, which were twined with\ntresses of golden hair, streaked with grey, which came through the\nbroken hearth-stone.\n\n\n\n\nThe Gipsy Prophecy\n\n\n'I really think,' said the Doctor, 'that, at any rate, one of us\nshould go and try whether or not the thing is an imposture.'\n\n'Good!' said Considine. 'After dinner we will take our cigars and\nstroll over to the camp.'\n\nAccordingly, when the dinner was over, and the _La Tour_ finished,\nJoshua Considine and his friend, Dr Burleigh, went over to the east\nside of the moor, where the gipsy encampment lay. As they were\nleaving, Mary Considine, who had walked as far as the end of the\ngarden where it opened into the laneway, called after her husband:\n\n'Mind, Joshua, you are to give them a fair chance, but don't give them\nany clue to a fortune--and don't you get flirting with any of the\ngipsy maidens--and take care to keep Gerald out of harm.'\n\nFor answer Considine held up his hand, as if taking a stage oath, and\nwhistled the air of the old song, 'The Gipsy Countess.' Gerald joined\nin the strain, and then, breaking into merry laughter, the two men\npassed along the laneway to the common, turning now and then to wave\ntheir hands to Mary, who leaned over the gate, in the twilight,\nlooking after them.\n\nIt was a lovely evening in the summer; the very air was full of rest\nand quiet happiness, as though an outward type of the peacefulness and\njoy which made a heaven of the home of the young married folk.\nConsidine's life had not been an eventful one. The only disturbing\nelement which he had ever known was in his wooing of Mary Winston, and\nthe long-continued objection of her ambitious parents, who expected a\nbrilliant match for their only daughter. When Mr. and Mrs. Winston had\ndiscovered the attachment of the young barrister, they had tried to\nkeep the young people apart by sending their daughter away for a long\nround of visits, having made her promise not to correspond with her\nlover during her absence. Love, however, had stood the test. Neither\nabsence nor neglect seemed to cool the passion of the young man, and\njealousy seemed a thing unknown to his sanguine nature; so, after a\nlong period of waiting, the parents had given in, and the young folk\nwere married.\n\nThey had been living in the cottage a few months, and were just\nbeginning to feel at home. Gerald Burleigh, Joshua's old college chum,\nand himself a sometime victim of Mary's beauty, had arrived a week\nbefore, to stay with them for as long a time as he could tear himself\naway from his work in London.\n\nWhen her husband had quite disappeared Mary went into the house, and,\nsitting down at the piano, gave an hour to Mendelssohn.\n\nIt was but a short walk across the common, and before the cigars\nrequired renewing the two men had reached the gipsy camp. The place\nwas as picturesque as gipsy camps--when in villages and when business\nis good--usually are. There were some few persons round the fire,\ninvesting their money in prophecy, and a large number of others,\npoorer or more parsimonious, who stayed just outside the bounds but\nnear enough to see all that went on.\n\nAs the two gentlemen approached, the villagers, who knew Joshua, made\nway a little, and a pretty, keen-eyed gipsy girl tripped up and asked\nto tell their fortunes. Joshua held out his hand, but the girl,\nwithout seeming to see it, stared at his face in a very odd manner.\nGerald nudged him:\n\n'You must cross her hand with silver,' he said. 'It is one of the most\nimportant parts of the mystery.' Joshua took from his pocket a\nhalf-crown and held it out to her, but, without looking at it, she\nanswered:\n\n'You have to cross the gipsy's hand with gold.'\n\nGerald laughed. 'You are at a premium as a subject,' he said. Joshua\nwas of the kind of man--the universal kind--who can tolerate being\nstared at by a pretty girl; so, with some little deliberation, he\nanswered:\n\n'All right; here you are, my pretty girl; but you must give me a real\ngood fortune for it,' and he handed her a half sovereign, which she\ntook, saying:\n\n'It is not for me to give good fortune or bad, but only to read what\nthe Stars have said.' She took his right hand and turned it palm\nupward; but the instant her eyes met it she dropped it as though it\nhad been red hot, and, with a startled look, glided swiftly away.\nLifting the curtain of the large tent, which occupied the centre of\nthe camp, she disappeared within.\n\n'Sold again!' said the cynical Gerald. Joshua stood a little amazed,\nand not altogether satisfied. They both watched the large tent. In a\nfew moments there emerged from the opening not the young girl, but a\nstately looking woman of middle age and commanding presence.\n\nThe instant she appeared the whole camp seemed to stand still. The\nclamour of tongues, the laughter and noise of the work were, for a\nsecond or two, arrested, and every man or woman who sat, or crouched,\nor lay, stood up and faced the imperial looking gipsy.\n\n'The Queen, of course,' murmured Gerald. 'We are in luck tonight.' The\ngipsy Queen threw a searching glance around the camp, and then,\nwithout hesitating an instant, came straight over and stood before\nJoshua.\n\n'Hold out your hand,' she said in a commanding tone.\n\nAgain Gerald spoke, _sotto voce_: 'I have not been spoken to in that\nway since I was at school.'\n\n'Your hand must be crossed with gold.'\n\n'A hundred per cent. at this game,' whispered Gerald, as Joshua laid\nanother half sovereign on his upturned palm.\n\nThe gipsy looked at the hand with knitted brows; then suddenly looking\nup into his face, said:\n\n'Have you a strong will--have you a true heart that can be brave for\none you love?'\n\n'I hope so; but I am afraid I have not vanity enough to say \"yes\".'\n\n'Then I will answer for you; for I read resolution in your\nface--resolution desperate and determined if need be. You have a wife\nyou love?'\n\n'Yes,' emphatically.\n\n'Then leave her at once--never see her face again. Go from her now,\nwhile love is fresh and your heart is free from wicked intent. Go\nquick--go far, and never see her face again!'\n\nJoshua drew away his hand quickly, and said, 'Thank you!' stiffly but\nsarcastically, as he began to move away.\n\n'I say!' said Gerald, 'you're not going like that, old man; no use in\nbeing indignant with the Stars or their prophet--and, moreover, your\nsovereign--what of it? At least, hear the matter out.'\n\n'Silence, ribald!' commanded the Queen, 'you know not what you do. Let\nhim go--and go ignorant, if he will not be warned.'\n\nJoshua immediately turned back. 'At all events, we will see this thing\nout,' he said. 'Now, madam, you have given me advice, but I paid for a\nfortune.'\n\n'Be warned!' said the gipsy. 'The Stars have been silent for long; let\nthe mystery still wrap them round.'\n\n'My dear madam, I do not get within touch of a mystery every day, and\nI prefer for my money knowledge rather than ignorance. I can get the\nlatter commodity for nothing when I want any of it.'\n\nGerald echoed the sentiment. 'As for me I have a large and unsaleable\nstock on hand.'\n\nThe gipsy Queen eyed the two men sternly, and then said: 'As you wish.\nYou have chosen for yourself, and have met warning with scorn, and\nappeal with levity. On your own heads be the doom!'\n\n'Amen!' said Gerald.\n\nWith an imperious gesture the Queen took Joshua's hand again, and\nbegan to tell his fortune.\n\n'I see here the flowing of blood; it will flow before long; it is\nrunning in my sight. It flows through the broken circle of a severed\nring.'\n\n'Go on!' said Joshua, smiling. Gerald was silent.\n\n'Must I speak plainer?'\n\n'Certainly; we commonplace mortals want something definite. The Stars\nare a long way off, and their words get somewhat dulled in the\nmessage.'\n\nThe gipsy shuddered, and then spoke impressively. 'This is the hand of\na murderer--the murderer of his wife!' She dropped the hand and turned\naway.\n\nJoshua laughed. 'Do you know,' said he, 'I think if I were you I\nshould prophesy some jurisprudence into my system. For instance, you\nsay \"this hand is the hand of a murderer.\" Well, whatever it may be in\nthe future--or potentially--it is at present not one. You ought to\ngive your prophecy in such terms as \"the hand which will be a\nmurderer's\", or, rather, \"the hand of one who will be the murderer of\nhis wife\". The Stars are really not good on technical questions.'\n\nThe gipsy made no reply of any kind, but, with drooping head and\ndespondent mien, walked slowly to her tent, and, lifting the curtain,\ndisappeared.\n\nWithout speaking the two men turned homewards, and walked across the\nmoor. Presently, after some little hesitation, Gerald spoke.\n\n'Of course, old man, this is all a joke; a ghastly one, but still a\njoke. But would it not be well to keep it to ourselves?'\n\n'How do you mean?'\n\n'Well, not tell your wife. It might alarm her.'\n\n'Alarm her! My dear Gerald, what are you thinking of? Why, she would\nnot be alarmed or afraid of me if all the gipsies that ever didn't\ncome from Bohemia agreed that I was to murder her, or even to have a\nhard thought of her, whilst so long as she was saying \"Jack\nRobinson.\"'\n\nGerald remonstrated. 'Old fellow, women are superstitious--far more\nthan we men are; and, also they are blessed--or cursed--with a nervous\nsystem to which we are strangers. I see too much of it in my work not\nto realise it. Take my advice and do not let her know, or you will\nfrighten her.'\n\nJoshua's lips unconsciously hardened as he answered: 'My dear fellow,\nI would not have a secret from my wife. Why, it would be the\nbeginning of a new order of things between us. We have no secrets from\neach other. If we ever have, then you may begin to look out for\nsomething odd between us.'\n\n'Still,' said Gerald, 'at the risk of unwelcome interference, I say\nagain be warned in time.'\n\n'The gipsy's very words,' said Joshua. 'You and she seem quite of one\naccord. Tell me, old man, is this a put-up thing? You told me of the\ngipsy camp--did you arrange it all with Her Majesty?' This was said\nwith an air of bantering earnestness. Gerald assured him that he only\nheard of the camp that morning; but he made fun of every answer of his\nfriend, and, in the process of this raillery, the time passed, and\nthey entered the cottage.\n\nMary was sitting at the piano but not playing. The dim twilight had\nwaked some very tender feelings in her breast, and her eyes were full\nof gentle tears. When the men came in she stole over to her husband's\nside and kissed him. Joshua struck a tragic attitude.\n\n'Mary,' he said in a deep voice, 'before you approach me, listen to\nthe words of Fate. The Stars have spoken and the doom is sealed.'\n\n'What is it, dear? Tell me the fortune, but do not frighten me.'\n\n'Not at all, my dear; but there is a truth which it is well that you\nshould know. Nay, it is necessary so that all your arrangements can be\nmade beforehand, and everything be decently done and in order.'\n\n'Go on, dear; I am listening.'\n\n'Mary Considine, your effigy may yet be seen at Madame Tussaud's. The\njuris-imprudent Stars have announced their fell tidings that this hand\nis red with blood--your blood. Mary! Mary! my God!' He sprang\nforward, but too late to catch her as she fell fainting on the floor.\n\n'I told you,' said Gerald. 'You don't know them as well as I do.'\n\nAfter a little while Mary recovered from her swoon, but only to fall\ninto strong hysterics, in which she laughed and wept and raved and\ncried, 'Keep him from me--from me, Joshua, my husband,' and many other\nwords of entreaty and of fear.\n\nJoshua Considine was in a state of mind bordering on agony, and when\nat last Mary became calm he knelt by her and kissed her feet and hands\nand hair and called her all the sweet names and said all the tender\nthings his lips could frame. All that night he sat by her bedside and\nheld her hand. Far through the night and up to the early morning she\nkept waking from sleep and crying out as if in fear, till she was\ncomforted by the consciousness that her husband was watching beside\nher.\n\nBreakfast was late the next morning, but during it Joshua received a\ntelegram which required him to drive over to Withering, nearly twenty\nmiles. He was loth to go; but Mary would not hear of his remaining,\nand so before noon he drove off in his dog-cart alone.\n\nWhen he was gone Mary retired to her room. She did not appear at\nlunch, but when afternoon tea was served on the lawn under the great\nweeping willow, she came to join her guest. She was looking quite\nrecovered from her illness of the evening before. After some casual\nremarks, she said to Gerald: 'Of course it was very silly about last\nnight, but I could not help feeling frightened. Indeed I would feel so\nstill if I let myself think of it. But, after all these people may\nonly imagine things, and I have got a test that can hardly fail to\nshow that the prediction is false--if indeed it be false,' she added\nsadly.\n\n'What is your plan?' asked Gerald.\n\n'I shall go myself to the gipsy camp, and have my fortune told by the\nQueen.'\n\n'Capital. May I go with you?'\n\n'Oh, no! That would spoil it. She might know you and guess at me, and\nsuit her utterance accordingly. I shall go alone this afternoon.'\n\nWhen the afternoon was gone Mary Considine took her way to the gipsy\nencampment. Gerald went with her as far as the near edge of the\ncommon, and returned alone.\n\nHalf-an-hour had hardly elapsed when Mary entered the drawing-room,\nwhere he lay on a sofa reading. She was ghastly pale and was in a\nstate of extreme excitement. Hardly had she passed over the threshold\nwhen she collapsed and sank moaning on the carpet. Gerald rushed to\naid her, but by a great effort she controlled herself and motioned him\nto be silent. He waited, and his ready attention to her wish seemed to\nbe her best help, for, in a few minutes, she had somewhat recovered,\nand was able to tell him what had passed.\n\n'When I got to the camp,' she said, 'there did not seem to be a soul\nabout, I went into the centre and stood there. Suddenly a tall woman\nstood beside me. \"Something told me I was wanted!\" she said. I held\nout my hand and laid a piece of silver on it. She took from her neck a\nsmall golden trinket and laid it there also; and then, seizing the\ntwo, threw them into the stream that ran by. Then she took my hand in\nhers and spoke: \"Naught but blood in this guilty place,\" and turned\naway. I caught hold of her and asked her to tell me more. After some\nhesitation, she said: \"Alas! alas! I see you lying at your husband's\nfeet, and his hands are red with blood.\"'\n\nGerald did not feel at all at ease, and tried to laugh it off.\n'Surely,' he said, 'this woman has a craze about murder.'\n\n'Do not laugh,' said Mary, 'I cannot bear it,' and then, as if with a\nsudden impulse, she left the room.\n\nNot long after Joshua returned, bright and cheery, and as hungry as a\nhunter after his long drive. His presence cheered his wife, who seemed\nmuch brighter, but she did not mention the episode of the visit to the\ngipsy camp, so Gerald did not mention it either. As if by tacit\nconsent the subject was not alluded to during the evening. But there\nwas a strange, settled look on Mary's face, which Gerald could not but\nobserve.\n\nIn the morning Joshua came down to breakfast later than usual. Mary\nhad been up and about the house from an early hour; but as the time\ndrew on she seemed to get a little nervous and now and again threw\naround an anxious look.\n\nGerald could not help noticing that none of those at breakfast could\nget on satisfactorily with their food. It was not altogether that the\nchops were tough, but that the knives were all so blunt. Being a\nguest, he, of course, made no sign; but presently saw Joshua draw his\nthumb across the edge of his knife in an unconscious sort of way. At\nthe action Mary turned pale and almost fainted.\n\nAfter breakfast they all went out on the lawn. Mary was making up a\nbouquet, and said to her husband, 'Get me a few of the tea-roses,\ndear.'\n\nJoshua pulled down a cluster from the front of the house. The stem\nbent, but was too tough to break. He put his hand in his pocket to get\nhis knife; but in vain. 'Lend me your knife, Gerald,' he said. But\nGerald had not got one, so he went into the breakfast room and took\none from the table. He came out feeling its edge and grumbling. 'What\non earth has happened to all the knives--the edges seem all ground\noff?' Mary turned away hurriedly and entered the house.\n\nJoshua tried to sever the stalk with the blunt knife as country cooks\nsever the necks of fowl--as schoolboys cut twine. With a little effort\nhe finished the task. The cluster of roses grew thick, so he\ndetermined to gather a great bunch.\n\nHe could not find a single sharp knife in the sideboard where the\ncutlery was kept, so he called Mary, and when she came, told her the\nstate of things. She looked so agitated and so miserable that he could\nnot help knowing the truth, and, as if astounded and hurt, asked her:\n\n'Do you mean to say that _you_ have done it?'\n\nShe broke in, 'Oh, Joshua, I was so afraid.'\n\nHe paused, and a set, white look came over his face. 'Mary!' said he,\n'is this all the trust you have in me? I would not have believed it.'\n\n'Oh, Joshua! Joshua!' she cried entreatingly, 'forgive me,' and wept\nbitterly.\n\nJoshua thought a moment and then said: 'I see how it is. We shall\nbetter end this or we shall all go mad.'\n\nHe ran into the drawing-room.\n\n'Where are you going?' almost screamed Mary.\n\nGerald saw what he meant--that he would not be tied to blunt\ninstruments by the force of a superstition, and was not surprised when\nhe saw him come out through the French window, bearing in his hand a\nlarge Ghourka knife, which usually lay on the centre table, and which\nhis brother had sent him from Northern India. It was one of those\ngreat hunting-knives which worked such havoc, at close quarters with\nthe enemies of the loyal Ghourkas during the mutiny, of great weight\nbut so evenly balanced in the hand as to seem light, and with an edge\nlike a razor. With one of these knives a Ghourka can cut a sheep in\ntwo.\n\nWhen Mary saw him come out of the room with the weapon in his hand she\nscreamed in an agony of fright, and the hysterics of last night were\npromptly renewed.\n\nJoshua ran toward her, and, seeing her falling, threw down the knife\nand tried to catch her.\n\nHowever, he was just a second too late, and the two men cried out in\nhorror simultaneously as they saw her fall upon the naked blade.\n\nWhen Gerald rushed over he found that in falling her left hand had\nstruck the blade, which lay partly upwards on the grass. Some of the\nsmall veins were cut through, and the blood gushed freely from the\nwound. As he was tying it up he pointed out to Joshua that the wedding\nring was severed by the steel.\n\nThey carried her fainting to the house. When, after a while, she came\nout, with her arm in a sling, she was peaceful in her mind and happy.\nShe said to her husband:\n\n'The gipsy was wonderfully near the truth; too near for the real thing\never to occur now, dear.'\n\nJoshua bent over and kissed the wounded hand.\n\n\n\n\nThe Coming of Abel Behenna\n\n\nThe little Cornish port of Pencastle was bright in the early April,\nwhen the sun had seemingly come to stay after a long and bitter\nwinter. Boldly and blackly the rock stood out against a background of\nshaded blue, where the sky fading into mist met the far horizon. The\nsea was of true Cornish hue--sapphire, save where it became deep\nemerald green in the fathomless depths under the cliffs, where the\nseal caves opened their grim jaws. On the slopes the grass was parched\nand brown. The spikes of furze bushes were ashy grey, but the golden\nyellow of their flowers streamed along the hillside, dipping out in\nlines as the rock cropped up, and lessening into patches and dots till\nfinally it died away all together where the sea winds swept round the\njutting cliffs and cut short the vegetation as though with an\never-working aerial shears. The whole hillside, with its body of brown\nand flashes of yellow, was just like a colossal yellow-hammer.\n\nThe little harbour opened from the sea between towering cliffs, and\nbehind a lonely rock, pierced with many caves and blow-holes through\nwhich the sea in storm time sent its thunderous voice, together with a\nfountain of drifting spume. Hence, it wound westwards in a serpentine\ncourse, guarded at its entrance by two little curving piers to left\nand right. These were roughly built of dark slates placed endways and\nheld together with great beams bound with iron bands. Thence, it\nflowed up the rocky bed of the stream whose winter torrents had of old\ncut out its way amongst the hills. This stream was deep at first, with\nhere and there, where it widened, patches of broken rock exposed at\nlow water, full of holes where crabs and lobsters were to be found at\nthe ebb of the tide. From amongst the rocks rose sturdy posts, used\nfor warping in the little coasting vessels which frequented the port.\nHigher up, the stream still flowed deeply, for the tide ran far\ninland, but always calmly for all the force of the wildest storm was\nbroken below. Some quarter mile inland the stream was deep at high\nwater, but at low tide there were at each side patches of the same\nbroken rock as lower down, through the chinks of which the sweet water\nof the natural stream trickled and murmured after the tide had ebbed\naway. Here, too, rose mooring posts for the fishermen's boats. At\neither side of the river was a row of cottages down almost on the\nlevel of high tide. They were pretty cottages, strongly and snugly\nbuilt, with trim narrow gardens in front, full of old-fashioned\nplants, flowering currants, coloured primroses, wallflower, and\nstonecrop. Over the fronts of many of them climbed clematis and\nwisteria. The window sides and door posts of all were as white as\nsnow, and the little pathway to each was paved with light coloured\nstones. At some of the doors were tiny porches, whilst at others were\nrustic seats cut from tree trunks or from old barrels; in nearly every\ncase the window ledges were filled with boxes or pots of flowers or\nfoliage plants.\n\nTwo men lived in cottages exactly opposite each other across the\nstream. Two men, both young, both good-looking, both prosperous, and\nwho had been companions and rivals from their boyhood. Abel Behenna\nwas dark with the gypsy darkness which the Phoenician mining wanderers\nleft in their track; Eric Sanson--which the local antiquarian said was\na corruption of Sagamanson--was fair, with the ruddy hue which marked\nthe path of the wild Norseman. These two seemed to have singled out\neach other from the very beginning to work and strive together, to\nfight for each other and to stand back to back in all endeavours. They\nhad now put the coping-stone on their Temple of Unity by falling in\nlove with the same girl. Sarah Trefusis was certainly the prettiest\ngirl in Pencastle, and there was many a young man who would gladly\nhave tried his fortune with her, but that there were two to contend\nagainst, and each of these the strongest and most resolute man in the\nport--except the other. The average young man thought that this was\nvery hard, and on account of it bore no good will to either of the\nthree principals: whilst the average young woman who had, lest worse\nshould befall, to put up with the grumbling of her sweetheart, and the\nsense of being only second best which it implied, did not either, be\nsure, regard Sarah with friendly eye. Thus it came, in the course of a\nyear or so, for rustic courtship is a slow process, that the two men\nand woman found themselves thrown much together. They were all\nsatisfied, so it did not matter, and Sarah, who was vain and something\nfrivolous, took care to have her revenge on both men and women in a\nquiet way. When a young woman in her 'walking out' can only boast one\nnot-quite-satisfied young man, it is no particular pleasure to her to\nsee her escort cast sheep's eyes at a better-looking girl supported by\ntwo devoted swains.\n\nAt length there came a time which Sarah dreaded, and which she had\ntried to keep distant--the time when she had to make her choice\nbetween the two men. She liked them both, and, indeed, either of them\nmight have satisfied the ideas of even a more exacting girl. But her\nmind was so constituted that she thought more of what she might lose,\nthan of what she might gain; and whenever she thought she had made up\nher mind she became instantly assailed with doubts as to the wisdom of\nher choice. Always the man whom she had presumably lost became endowed\nafresh with a newer and more bountiful crop of advantages than had\never arisen from the possibility of his acceptance. She promised each\nman that on her birthday she would give him his answer, and that day,\nthe 11th of April, had now arrived. The promises had been given singly\nand confidentially, but each was given to a man who was not likely to\nforget. Early in the morning she found both men hovering round her\ndoor. Neither had taken the other into his confidence, and each was\nsimply seeking an early opportunity of getting his answer, and\nadvancing his suit if necessary. Damon, as a rule, does not take\nPythias with him when making a proposal; and in the heart of each man\nhis own affairs had a claim far above any requirements of friendship.\nSo, throughout the day, they kept seeing each other out. The position\nwas doubtless somewhat embarrassing to Sarah, and though the\nsatisfaction of her vanity that she should be thus adored was very\npleasing, yet there were moments when she was annoyed with both men\nfor being so persistent. Her only consolation at such moments was that\nshe saw, through the elaborate smiles of the other girls when in\npassing they noticed her door thus doubly guarded, the jealousy which\nfilled their hearts. Sarah's mother was a person of commonplace and\nsordid ideas, and, seeing all along the state of affairs, her one\nintention, persistently expressed to her daughter in the plainest\nwords, was to so arrange matters that Sarah should get all that was\npossible out of both men. With this purpose she had cunningly kept\nherself as far as possible in the background in the matter of her\ndaughter's wooings, and watched in silence. At first Sarah had been\nindignant with her for her sordid views; but, as usual, her weak\nnature gave way before persistence, and she had now got to the stage\nof acceptance. She was not surprised when her mother whispered to her\nin the little yard behind the house:--\n\n'Go up the hillside for a while; I want to talk to these two. They're\nboth red-hot for ye, and now's the time to get things fixed!' Sarah\nbegan a feeble remonstrance, but her mother cut her short.\n\n'I tell ye, girl, that my mind is made up! Both these men want ye, and\nonly one can have ye, but before ye choose it'll be so arranged that\nye'll have all that both have got! Don't argy, child! Go up the\nhillside, and when ye come back I'll have it fixed--I see a way quite\neasy!' So Sarah went up the hillside through the narrow paths between\nthe golden furze, and Mrs. Trefusis joined the two men in the\nliving-room of the little house.\n\nShe opened the attack with the desperate courage which is in all\nmothers when they think for their children, howsoever mean the\nthoughts may be.\n\n'Ye two men, ye're both in love with my Sarah!'\n\nTheir bashful silence gave consent to the barefaced proposition. She\nwent on.\n\n'Neither of ye has much!' Again they tacitly acquiesced in the soft\nimpeachment.\n\n'I don't know that either of ye could keep a wife!' Though neither\nsaid a word their looks and bearing expressed distinct dissent. Mrs.\nTrefusis went on:\n\n'But if ye'd put what ye both have together ye'd make a comfortable\nhome for one of ye--and Sarah!' She eyed the men keenly, with her\ncunning eyes half shut, as she spoke; then satisfied from her scrutiny\nthat the idea was accepted she went on quickly, as if to prevent\nargument:\n\n'The girl likes ye both, and mayhap it's hard for her to choose. Why\ndon't ye toss up for her? First put your money together--ye've each\ngot a bit put by, I know. Let the lucky man take the lot and trade\nwith it a bit, and then come home and marry her. Neither of ye's\nafraid, I suppose! And neither of ye'll say that he won't do that much\nfor the girl that ye both say ye love!'\n\nAbel broke the silence:\n\n'It don't seem the square thing to toss for the girl! She wouldn't\nlike it herself, and it doesn't seem--seem respectful like to her--'\nEric interrupted. He was conscious that his chance was not so good as\nAbel's in case Sarah should wish to choose between them:\n\n'Are ye afraid of the hazard?'\n\n'Not me!' said Abel, boldly. Mrs. Trefusis, seeing that her idea was\nbeginning to work, followed up the advantage.\n\n'It is settled that ye put yer money together to make a home for her,\nwhether ye toss for her or leave it for her to choose?'\n\n'Yes,' said Eric quickly, and Abel agreed with equal sturdiness. Mrs.\nTrefusis' little cunning eyes twinkled. She heard Sarah's step in the\nyard, and said:\n\n'Well! here she comes, and I leave it to her.' And she went out.\n\nDuring her brief walk on the hillside Sarah had been trying to make up\nher mind. She was feeling almost angry with both men for being the\ncause of her difficulty, and as she came into the room said shortly:\n\n'I want to have a word with you both--come to the Flagstaff Rock,\nwhere we can be alone.' She took her hat and went out of the house up\nthe winding path to the steep rock crowned with a high flagstaff,\nwhere once the wreckers' fire basket used to burn. This was the rock\nwhich formed the northern jaw of the little harbour. There was only\nroom on the path for two abreast, and it marked the state of things\npretty well when, by a sort of implied arrangement, Sarah went first,\nand the two men followed, walking abreast and keeping step. By this\ntime, each man's heart was boiling with jealousy. When they came to\nthe top of the rock, Sarah stood against the flagstaff, and the two\nyoung men stood opposite her. She had chosen her position with\nknowledge and intention, for there was no room for anyone to stand\nbeside her. They were all silent for a while; then Sarah began to\nlaugh and said:--\n\n'I promised the both of you to give you an answer to-day. I've been\nthinking and thinking and thinking, till I began to get angry with you\nboth for plaguing me so; and even now I don't seem any nearer than\never I was to making up my mind.' Eric said suddenly:\n\n'Let us toss for it, lass!' Sarah showed no indignation whatever at\nthe proposition; her mother's eternal suggestion had schooled her to\nthe acceptance of something of the kind, and her weak nature made it\neasy to her to grasp at any way out of the difficulty. She stood with\ndowncast eyes idly picking at the sleeve of her dress, seeming to\nhave tacitly acquiesced in the proposal. Both men instinctively\nrealising this pulled each a coin from his pocket, spun it in the air,\nand dropped his other hand over the palm on which it lay. For a few\nseconds they remained thus, all silent; then Abel, who was the more\nthoughtful of the men, spoke:\n\n'Sarah! is this good?' As he spoke he removed the upper hand from the\ncoin and placed the latter back in his pocket. Sarah was nettled.\n\n'Good or bad, it's good enough for me! Take it or leave it as you\nlike,' she said, to which he replied quickly:\n\n'Nay lass! Aught that concerns you is good enow for me. I did but\nthink of you lest you might have pain or disappointment hereafter. If\nyou love Eric better nor me, in God's name say so, and I think I'm man\nenow to stand aside. Likewise, if I'm the one, don't make us both\nmiserable for life!' Face to face with a difficulty, Sarah's weak\nnature proclaimed itself; she put her hands before her face and began\nto cry, saying--\n\n'It was my mother. She keeps telling me!' The silence which followed\nwas broken by Eric, who said hotly to Abel:\n\n'Let the lass alone, can't you? If she wants to choose this way, let\nher. It's good enough for me--and for you, too! She's said it now, and\nmust abide by it!' Hereupon Sarah turned upon him in sudden fury, and\ncried:\n\n'Hold your tongue! what is it to you, at any rate?' and she resumed\nher crying. Eric was so flabbergasted that he had not a word to say,\nbut stood looking particularly foolish, with his mouth open and his\nhands held out with the coin still between them. All were silent till\nSarah, taking her hands from her face laughed hysterically and said:\n\n'As you two can't make up your minds, I'm going home!' and she turned\nto go.\n\n'Stop,' said Abel, in an authoritative voice. 'Eric, you hold the\ncoin, and I'll cry. Now, before we settle it, let us clearly\nunderstand: the man who wins takes all the money that we both have\ngot, brings it to Bristol and ships on a voyage and trades with it.\nThen he comes back and marries Sarah, and they two keep all, whatever\nthere may be, as the result of the trading. Is this what we\nunderstand?'\n\n'Yes,' said Eric.\n\n'I'll marry him on my next birthday,' said Sarah. Having said it the\nintolerably mercenary spirit of her action seemed to strike her, and\nimpulsively she turned away with a bright blush. Fire seemed to\nsparkle in the eyes of both men. Said Eric: 'A year so be! The man\nthat wins is to have one year.'\n\n'Toss!' cried Abel, and the coin spun in the air. Eric caught it, and\nagain held it between his outstretched hands.\n\n'Heads!' cried Abel, a pallor sweeping over his face as he spoke. As\nhe leaned forward to look Sarah leaned forward too, and their heads\nalmost touched. He could feel her hair blowing on his cheek, and it\nthrilled through him like fire. Eric lifted his upper hand; the coin\nlay with its head up. Abel stepped forward and took Sarah in his arms.\nWith a curse Eric hurled the coin far into the sea. Then he leaned\nagainst the flagstaff and scowled at the others with his hands thrust\ndeep into his pockets. Abel whispered wild words of passion and\ndelight into Sarah's ears, and as she listened she began to believe\nthat fortune had rightly interpreted the wishes of her secret heart,\nand that she loved Abel best.\n\nPresently Abel looked up and caught sight of Eric's face as the last\nray of sunset struck it. The red light intensified the natural\nruddiness of his complexion, and he looked as though he were steeped\nin blood. Abel did not mind his scowl, for now that his own heart was\nat rest he could feel unalloyed pity for his friend. He stepped over\nmeaning to comfort him, and held out his hand, saying:\n\n'It was my chance, old lad. Don't grudge it me. I'll try to make Sarah\na happy woman, and you shall be a brother to us both!'\n\n'Brother be damned!' was all the answer Eric made, as he turned away.\nWhen he had gone a few steps down the rocky path he turned and came\nback. Standing before Abel and Sarah, who had their arms round each\nother, he said:\n\n'You have a year. Make the most of it! And be sure you're in time to\nclaim your wife! Be back to have your banns up in time to be married\non the 11th April. If you're not, I tell you I shall have my banns up,\nand you may get back too late.'\n\n'What do you mean, Eric? You are mad!'\n\n'No more mad than you are, Abel Behenna. You go, that's your chance! I\nstay, that's mine! I don't mean to let the grass grow under my feet.\nSarah cared no more for you than for me five minutes ago, and she may\ncome back to that five minutes after you're gone! You won by a point\nonly--the game may change.'\n\n'The game won't change!' said Abel shortly. 'Sarah, you'll be true to\nme? You won't marry till I return?'\n\n'For a year!' added Eric, quickly, 'that's the bargain.'\n\n'I promise for the year,' said Sarah. A dark look came over Abel's\nface, and he was about to speak, but he mastered himself and smiled.\n\n'I mustn't be too hard or get angry tonight! Come, Eric! we played and\nfought together. I won fairly. I played fairly all the game of our\nwooing! You know that as well as I do; and now when I am going away, I\nshall look to my old and true comrade to help me when I am gone!'\n\n'I'll help you none,' said Eric, 'so help me God!'\n\n'It was God helped me,' said Abel simply.\n\n'Then let Him go on helping you,' said Eric angrily. 'The Devil is\ngood enough for me!' and without another word he rushed down the steep\npath and disappeared behind the rocks.\n\nWhen he had gone Abel hoped for some tender passage with Sarah, but\nthe first remark she made chilled him.\n\n'How lonely it all seems without Eric!' and this note sounded till he\nhad left her at home--and after.\n\nEarly on the next morning Abel heard a noise at his door, and on going\nout saw Eric walking rapidly away: a small canvas bag full of gold and\nsilver lay on the threshold; on a small slip of paper pinned to it was\nwritten:\n\n'Take the money and go. I stay. God for you! The Devil for me!\nRemember the 11th of April.--ERIC SANSON.' That afternoon Abel went\noff to Bristol, and a week later sailed on the _Star of the Sea_ bound\nfor Pahang. His money--including that which had been Eric's--was on\nboard in the shape of a venture of cheap toys. He had been advised by\na shrewd old mariner of Bristol whom he knew, and who knew the ways of\nthe Chersonese, who predicted that every penny invested would be\nreturned with a shilling to boot.\n\nAs the year wore on Sarah became more and more disturbed in her mind.\nEric was always at hand to make love to her in his own persistent,\nmasterful manner, and to this she did not object. Only one letter came\nfrom Abel, to say that his venture had proved successful, and that he\nhad sent some two hundred pounds to the bank at Bristol, and was\ntrading with fifty pounds still remaining in goods for China, whither\nthe _Star of the Sea_ was bound and whence she would return to\nBristol. He suggested that Eric's share of the venture should be\nreturned to him with his share of the profits. This proposition was\ntreated with anger by Eric, and as simply childish by Sarah's mother.\n\nMore than six months had since then elapsed, but no other letter had\ncome, and Eric's hopes which had been dashed down by the letter from\nPahang, began to rise again. He perpetually assailed Sarah with an\n'if!' If Abel did not return, would she then marry him? If the 11th\nApril went by without Abel being in the port, would she give him over?\nIf Abel had taken his fortune, and married another girl on the head of\nit, would she marry him, Eric, as soon as the truth were known? And so\non in an endless variety of possibilities. The power of the strong\nwill and the determined purpose over the woman's weaker nature became\nin time manifest. Sarah began to lose her faith in Abel and to regard\nEric as a possible husband; and a possible husband is in a woman's eye\ndifferent to all other men. A new affection for him began to arise in\nher breast, and the daily familiarities of permitted courtship\nfurthered the growing affection. Sarah began to regard Abel as rather\na rock in the road of her life, and had it not been for her mother's\nconstantly reminding her of the good fortune already laid by in the\nBristol Bank she would have tried to have shut her eyes altogether to\nthe fact of Abel's existence.\n\nThe 11th April was Saturday, so that in order to have the marriage on\nthat day it would be necessary that the banns should be called on\nSunday, 22nd March. From the beginning of that month Eric kept\nperpetually on the subject of Abel's absence, and his outspoken\nopinion that the latter was either dead or married began to become a\nreality to the woman's mind. As the first half of the month wore on\nEric became more jubilant, and after church on the 15th he took Sarah\nfor a walk to the Flagstaff Rock. There he asserted himself strongly:\n\n'I told Abel, and you too, that if he was not here to put up his banns\nin time for the eleventh, I would put up mine for the twelfth. Now the\ntime has come when I mean to do it. He hasn't kept his word'--here\nSarah struck in out of her weakness and indecision:\n\n'He hasn't broken it yet!' Eric ground his teeth with anger.\n\n'If you mean to stick up for him,' he said, as he smote his hands\nsavagely on the flagstaff, which sent forth a shivering murmur, 'well\nand good. I'll keep my part of the bargain. On Sunday I shall give\nnotice of the banns, and you can deny them in the church if you will.\nIf Abel is in Pencastle on the eleventh, he can have them cancelled,\nand his own put up; but till then, I take my course, and woe to anyone\nwho stands in my way!' With that he flung himself down the rocky\npathway, and Sarah could not but admire his Viking strength and\nspirit, as, crossing the hill, he strode away along the cliffs towards\nBude.\n\nDuring the week no news was heard of Abel, and on Saturday Eric gave\nnotice of the banns of marriage between himself and Sarah Trefusis.\nThe clergyman would have remonstrated with him, for although nothing\nformal had been told to the neighbours, it had been understood since\nAbel's departure that on his return he was to marry Sarah; but Eric\nwould not discuss the question.\n\n'It is a painful subject, sir,' he said with a firmness which the\nparson, who was a very young man, could not but be swayed by. 'Surely\nthere is nothing against Sarah or me. Why should there be any bones\nmade about the matter?' The parson said no more, and on the next day\nhe read out the banns for the first time amidst an audible buzz from\nthe congregation. Sarah was present, contrary to custom, and though\nshe blushed furiously enjoyed her triumph over the other girls whose\nbanns had not yet come. Before the week was over she began to make her\nwedding dress. Eric used to come and look at her at work and the sight\nthrilled through him. He used to say all sorts of pretty things to her\nat such times, and there were to both delicious moments of\nlove-making.\n\nThe banns were read a second time on the 29th, and Eric's hope grew\nmore and more fixed though there were to him moments of acute despair\nwhen he realised that the cup of happiness might be dashed from his\nlips at any moment, right up to the last. At such times he was full of\npassion--desperate and remorseless--and he ground his teeth and\nclenched his hands in a wild way as though some taint of the old\nBerserker fury of his ancestors still lingered in his blood. On the\nThursday of that week he looked in on Sarah and found her, amid a\nflood of sunshine, putting finishing touches to her white wedding\ngown. His own heart was full of gaiety, and the sight of the woman who\nwas so soon to be his own so occupied, filled him with a joy\nunspeakable, and he felt faint with languorous ecstasy. Bending over\nhe kissed Sarah on the mouth, and then whispered in her rosy ear--\n\n'Your wedding dress, Sarah! And for me!' As he drew back to admire her\nshe looked up saucily, and said to him--\n\n'Perhaps not for you. There is more than a week yet for Abel!' and\nthen cried out in dismay, for with a wild gesture and a fierce oath\nEric dashed out of the house, banging the door behind him. The\nincident disturbed Sarah more than she could have thought possible,\nfor it awoke all her fears and doubts and indecision afresh. She cried\na little, and put by her dress, and to soothe herself went out to sit\nfor a while on the summit of the Flagstaff Rock. When she arrived she\nfound there a little group anxiously discussing the weather. The sea\nwas calm and the sun bright, but across the sea were strange lines of\ndarkness and light, and close in to shore the rocks were fringed with\nfoam, which spread out in great white curves and circles as the\ncurrents drifted. The wind had backed, and came in sharp, cold puffs.\nThe blow-hole, which ran under the Flagstaff Rock, from the rocky bay\nwithout to the harbour within, was booming at intervals, and the\nseagulls were screaming ceaselessly as they wheeled about the entrance\nof the port.\n\n'It looks bad,' she heard an old fisherman say to the coastguard. 'I\nseen it just like this once before, when the East Indiaman\n_Coromandel_ went to pieces in Dizzard Bay!' Sarah did not wait to\nhear more. She was of a timid nature where danger was concerned, and\ncould not bear to hear of wrecks and disasters. She went home and\nresumed the completion of her dress, secretly determined to appease\nEric when she should meet him with a sweet apology--and to take the\nearliest opportunity of being even with him after her marriage. The\nold fisherman's weather prophecy was justified. That night at dusk a\nwild storm came on. The sea rose and lashed the western coasts from\nSkye to Scilly and left a tale of disaster everywhere. The sailors and\nfishermen of Pencastle all turned out on the rocks and cliffs and\nwatched eagerly. Presently, by a flash of lightning, a 'ketch' was\nseen drifting under only a jib about half-a-mile outside the port. All\neyes and all glasses were concentrated on her, waiting for the next\nflash, and when it came a chorus went up that it was the _Lovely\nAlice_, trading between Bristol and Penzance, and touching at all the\nlittle ports between. 'God help them!' said the harbour-master, 'for\nnothing in this world can save them when they are between Bude and\nTintagel and the wind on shore!' The coastguards exerted themselves,\nand, aided by brave hearts and willing hands, they brought the rocket\napparatus up on the summit of the Flagstaff Rock. Then they burned\nblue lights so that those on board might see the harbour opening in\ncase they could make any effort to reach it. They worked gallantly\nenough on board; but no skill or strength of man could avail. Before\nmany minutes were over the _Lovely Alice_ rushed to her doom on the\ngreat island rock that guarded the mouth of the port. The screams of\nthose on board were faintly borne on the tempest as they flung\nthemselves into the sea in a last chance for life. The blue lights\nwere kept burning, and eager eyes peered into the depths of the waters\nin case any face could be seen; and ropes were held ready to fling out\nin aid. But never a face was seen, and the willing arms rested idle.\nEric was there amongst his fellows. His old Icelandic origin was\nnever more apparent than in that wild hour. He took a rope, and\nshouted in the ear of the harbour-master:\n\n'I shall go down on the rock over the seal cave. The tide is running\nup, and someone may drift in there!'\n\n'Keep back, man!' came the answer. 'Are you mad? One slip on that rock\nand you are lost: and no man could keep his feet in the dark on such a\nplace in such a tempest!'\n\n'Not a bit,' came the reply. 'You remember how Abel Behenna saved me\nthere on a night like this when my boat went on the Gull Rock. He\ndragged me up from the deep water in the seal cave, and now someone\nmay drift in there again as I did,' and he was gone into the darkness.\nThe projecting rock hid the light on the Flagstaff Rock, but he knew\nhis way too well to miss it. His boldness and sureness of foot\nstanding to him, he shortly stood on the great round-topped rock cut\naway beneath by the action of the waves over the entrance of the seal\ncave, where the water was fathomless. There he stood in comparative\nsafety, for the concave shape of the rock beat back the waves with\ntheir own force, and though the water below him seemed to boil like a\nseething cauldron, just beyond the spot there was a space of almost\ncalm. The rock, too, seemed here to shut off the sound of the gale,\nand he listened as well as watched. As he stood there ready, with his\ncoil of rope poised to throw, he thought he heard below him, just\nbeyond the whirl of the water, a faint, despairing cry. He echoed it\nwith a shout that rang into the night. Then he waited for the flash of\nlightning, and as it passed flung his rope out into the darkness where\nhe had seen a face rising through the swirl of the foam. The rope was\ncaught, for he felt a pull on it, and he shouted again in his mighty\nvoice:\n\n'Tie it round your waist, and I shall pull you up.' Then when he felt\nthat it was fast he moved along the rock to the far side of the sea\ncave, where the deep water was something stiller, and where he could\nget foothold secure enough to drag the rescued man on the overhanging\nrock. He began to pull, and shortly he knew from the rope taken in\nthat the man he was now rescuing must soon be close to the top of the\nrock. He steadied himself for a moment, and drew a long breath, that\nhe might at the next effort complete the rescue. He had just bent his\nback to the work when a flash of lightning revealed to each other the\ntwo men--the rescuer and the rescued.\n\nEric Sanson and Abel Behenna were face to face--and none knew of the\nmeeting save themselves; and God.\n\nOn the instant a wave of passion swept through Eric's heart. All his\nhopes were shattered, and with the hatred of Cain his eyes looked out.\nHe saw in the instant of recognition the joy in Abel's face that his\nwas the hand to succour him, and this intensified his hate. Whilst the\npassion was on him he started back, and the rope ran out between his\nhands. His moment of hate was followed by an impulse of his better\nmanhood, but it was too late.\n\nBefore he could recover himself, Abel encumbered with the rope that\nshould have aided him, was plunged with a despairing cry back into the\ndarkness of the devouring sea.\n\nThen, feeling all the madness and the doom of Cain upon him, Eric\nrushed back over the rocks, heedless of the danger and eager only for\none thing--to be amongst other people whose living noises would shut\nout that last cry which seemed to ring still in his ears. When he\nregained the Flagstaff Rock the men surrounded him, and through the\nfury of the storm he heard the harbour-master say:--\n\n'We feared you were lost when we heard a cry! How white you are! Where\nis your rope? Was there anyone drifted in?'\n\n'No one,' he shouted in answer, for he felt that he could never\nexplain that he had let his old comrade slip back into the sea, and at\nthe very place and under the very circumstances in which that comrade\nhad saved his own life. He hoped by one bold lie to set the matter at\nrest for ever. There was no one to bear witness--and if he should have\nto carry that still white face in his eyes and that despairing cry in\nhis ears for evermore--at least none should know of it. 'No one,' he\ncried, more loudly still. 'I slipped on the rock, and the rope fell\ninto the sea!' So saying he left them, and, rushing down the steep\npath, gained his own cottage and locked himself within.\n\nThe remainder of that night he passed lying on his bed--dressed and\nmotionless--staring upwards, and seeming to see through the darkness a\npale face gleaming wet in the lightning, with its glad recognition\nturning to ghastly despair, and to hear a cry which never ceased to\necho in his soul.\n\nIn the morning the storm was over and all was smiling again, except\nthat the sea was still boisterous with its unspent fury. Great pieces\nof wreck drifted into the port, and the sea around the island rock was\nstrewn with others. Two bodies also drifted into the harbour--one the\nmaster of the wrecked ketch, the other a strange seaman whom no one\nknew.\n\nSarah saw nothing of Eric till the evening, and then he only looked\nin for a minute. He did not come into the house, but simply put his\nhead in through the open window.\n\n'Well, Sarah,' he called out in a loud voice, though to her it did not\nring truly, 'is the wedding dress done? Sunday week, mind! Sunday\nweek!'\n\nSarah was glad to have the reconciliation so easy; but, womanlike,\nwhen she saw the storm was over and her own fears groundless, she at\nonce repeated the cause of offence.\n\n'Sunday so be it,' she said without looking up, 'if Abel isn't there\non Saturday!' Then she looked up saucily, though her heart was full of\nfear of another outburst on the part of her impetuous lover. But the\nwindow was empty; Eric had taken himself off, and with a pout she\nresumed her work. She saw Eric no more till Sunday afternoon, after\nthe banns had been called the third time, when he came up to her\nbefore all the people with an air of proprietorship which half-pleased\nand half-annoyed her.\n\n'Not yet, mister!' she said, pushing him away, as the other girls\ngiggled. 'Wait till Sunday next, if you please--the day after\nSaturday!' she added, looking at him saucily. The girls giggled again,\nand the young men guffawed. They thought it was the snub that touched\nhim so that he became as white as a sheet as he turned away. But\nSarah, who knew more than they did, laughed, for she saw triumph\nthrough the spasm of pain that overspread his face.\n\nThe week passed uneventfully; however, as Saturday drew nigh Sarah had\noccasional moments of anxiety, and as to Eric he went about at\nnight-time like a man possessed. He restrained himself when others\nwere by, but now and again he went down amongst the rocks and caves\nand shouted aloud. This seemed to relieve him somewhat, and he was\nbetter able to restrain himself for some time after. All Saturday he\nstayed in his own house and never left it. As he was to be married on\nthe morrow, the neighbours thought it was shyness on his part, and did\nnot trouble or notice him. Only once was he disturbed, and that was\nwhen the chief boatman came to him and sat down, and after a pause\nsaid:\n\n'Eric, I was over in Bristol yesterday. I was in the ropemaker's\ngetting a coil to replace the one you lost the night of the storm, and\nthere I saw Michael Heavens of this place, who is a salesman there. He\ntold me that Abel Behenna had come home the week ere last on the _Star\nof the Sea_ from Canton, and that he had lodged a sight of money in\nthe Bristol Bank in the name of Sarah Behenna. He told Michael so\nhimself--and that he had taken passage on the _Lovely Alice_ to\nPencastle. 'Bear up, man,' for Eric had with a groan dropped his head\non his knees, with his face between his hands. 'He was your old\ncomrade, I know, but you couldn't help him. He must have gone down\nwith the rest that awful night. I thought I'd better tell you, lest it\nmight come some other way, and you might keep Sarah Trefusis from\nbeing frightened. They were good friends once, and women take these\nthings to heart. It would not do to let her be pained with such a\nthing on her wedding day!' Then he rose and went away, leaving Eric\nstill sitting disconsolately with his head on his knees.\n\n'Poor fellow!' murmured the chief boatman to himself; 'he takes it to\nheart. Well, well! right enough! They were true comrades once, and\nAbel saved him!'\n\nThe afternoon of that day, when the children had left school, they\nstrayed as usual on half-holidays along' the quay and the paths by the\ncliffs. Presently some of them came running in a state of great\nexcitement to the harbour, where a few men were unloading a coal\nketch, and a great many were superintending the operation. One of the\nchildren called out:\n\n'There is a porpoise in the harbour mouth! We saw it come through the\nblow-hole! It had a long tail, and was deep under the water!'\n\n'It was no porpoise,' said another; 'it was a seal; but it had a long\ntail! It came out of the seal cave!' The other children bore various\ntestimony, but on two points they were unanimous--it, whatever 'it'\nwas, had come through the blow-hole deep under the water, and had a\nlong, thin tail--a tail so long that they could not see the end of it.\nThere was much unmerciful chaffing of the children by the men on this\npoint, but as it was evident that they had seen something, quite a\nnumber of persons, young and old, male and female, went along the high\npaths on either side of the harbour mouth to catch a glimpse of this\nnew addition to the fauna of the sea, a long-tailed porpoise or seal.\nThe tide was now coming in. There was a slight breeze, and the surface\nof the water was rippled so that it was only at moments that anyone\ncould see clearly into the deep water. After a spell of watching a\nwoman called out that she saw something moving up the channel, just\nbelow where she was standing. There was a stampede to the spot, but by\nthe time the crowd had gathered the breeze had freshened, and it was\nimpossible to see with any distinctness below the surface of the\nwater. On being questioned the woman described what she had seen, but\nin such an incoherent way that the whole thing was put down as an\neffect of imagination; had it not been for the children's report she\nwould not have been credited at all. Her semi-hysterical statement\nthat what she saw was 'like a pig with the entrails out' was only\nthought anything of by an old coastguard, who shook his head but did\nnot make any remark. For the remainder of the daylight this man was\nseen always on the bank, looking into the water, but always with\ndisappointment manifest on his face.\n\nEric arose early on the next morning--he had not slept all night, and\nit was a relief to him to move about in the light. He shaved himself\nwith a hand that did not tremble, and dressed himself in his wedding\nclothes. There was a haggard look on his face, and he seemed as though\nhe had grown years older in the last few days. Still there was a wild,\nuneasy light of triumph in his eyes, and he kept murmuring to himself\nover and over again:\n\n'This is my wedding-day! Abel cannot claim her now--living or\ndead!--living or dead! Living or dead!' He sat in his arm-chair,\nwaiting with an uncanny quietness for the church hour to arrive. When\nthe bell began to ring he arose and passed out of his house, closing\nthe door behind him. He looked at the river and saw the tide had just\nturned. In the church he sat with Sarah and her mother, holding\nSarah's hand tightly in his all the time, as though he feared to lose\nher. When the service was over they stood up together, and were\nmarried in the presence of the entire congregation; for no one left\nthe church. Both made the responses clearly--Eric's being even on the\ndefiant side. When the wedding was over Sarah took her husband's arm,\nand they walked away together, the boys and younger girls being cuffed\nby their elders into a decorous behaviour, for they would fain have\nfollowed close behind their heels.\n\nThe way from the church led down to the back of Eric's cottage, a\nnarrow passage being between it and that of his next neighbour. When\nthe bridal couple had passed through this the remainder of the\ncongregation, who had followed them at a little distance, were\nstartled by a long, shrill scream from the bride. They rushed through\nthe passage and found her on the bank with wild eyes, pointing to the\nriver bed opposite Eric Sanson's door.\n\nThe falling tide had deposited there the body of Abel Behenna stark\nupon the broken rocks. The rope trailing from its waist had been\ntwisted by the current round the mooring post, and had held it back\nwhilst the tide had ebbed away from it. The right elbow had fallen in\na chink in the rock, leaving the hand outstretched toward Sarah, with\nthe open palm upward as though it were extended to receive hers, the\npale drooping fingers open to the clasp.\n\nAll that happened afterwards was never quite known to Sarah Sanson.\nWhenever she would try to recollect there would become a buzzing in\nher ears and a dimness in her eyes, and all would pass away. The only\nthing that she could remember of it all--and this she never\nforgot--was Eric's breathing heavily, with his face whiter than that\nof the dead man, as he muttered under his breath:\n\n'Devil's help! Devil's faith! Devil's price!'\n\n\n\n\nThe Burial of the Rats\n\n\nLeaving Paris by the Orleans road, cross the Enceinte, and, turning to\nthe right, you find yourself in a somewhat wild and not at all savoury\ndistrict. Right and left, before and behind, on every side rise great\nheaps of dust and waste accumulated by the process of time.\n\nParis has its night as well as its day life, and the sojourner who\nenters his hotel in the Rue de Rivoli or the Rue St. Honore late at\nnight or leaves it early in the morning, can guess, in coming near\nMontrouge--if he has not done so already--the purpose of those great\nwaggons that look like boilers on wheels which he finds halting\neverywhere as he passes.\n\nEvery city has its peculiar institutions created out of its own needs;\nand one of the most notable institutions of Paris is its rag-picking\npopulation. In the early morning--and Parisian life commences at an\nearly hour--may be seen in most streets standing on the pathway\nopposite every court and alley and between every few houses, as still\nin some American cities, even in parts of New York, large wooden boxes\ninto which the domestics or tenement-holders empty the accumulated\ndust of the past day. Round these boxes gather and pass on, when the\nwork is done, to fresh fields of labour and pastures new, squalid\nhungry-looking men and women, the implements of whose craft consist\nof a coarse bag or basket slung over the shoulder and a little rake\nwith which they turn over and probe and examine in the minutest manner\nthe dustbins. They pick up and deposit in their baskets, by aid of\ntheir rakes, whatever they may find, with the same facility as a\nChinaman uses his chopsticks.\n\nParis is a city of centralisation--and centralisation and\nclassification are closely allied. In the early times, when\ncentralisation is becoming a fact, its forerunner is classification.\nAll things which are similar or analogous become grouped together, and\nfrom the grouping of groups rises one whole or central point. We see\nradiating many long arms with innumerable tentaculae, and in the\ncentre rises a gigantic head with a comprehensive brain and keen eyes\nto look on every side and ears sensitive to hear--and a voracious\nmouth to swallow.\n\nOther cities resemble all the birds and beasts and fishes whose\nappetites and digestions are normal. Paris alone is the analogical\napotheosis of the octopus. Product of centralisation carried to an _ad\nabsurdum_, it fairly represents the devil fish; and in no respects is\nthe resemblance more curious than in the similarity of the digestive\napparatus.\n\nThose intelligent tourists who, having surrendered their individuality\ninto the hands of Messrs. Cook or Gaze, 'do' Paris in three days, are\noften puzzled to know how it is that the dinner which in London would\ncost about six shillings, can be had for three francs in a caf\u00c3\u00a9 in the\nPalais Royal. They need have no more wonder if they will but consider\nthe classification which is a theoretic speciality of Parisian life,\nand adopt all round the fact from which the chiffonier has his\ngenesis.\n\nThe Paris of 1850 was not like the Paris of to-day, and those who see\nthe Paris of Napoleon and Baron Hausseman can hardly realise the\nexistence of the state of things forty-five years ago.\n\nAmongst other things, however, which have not changed are those\ndistricts where the waste is gathered. Dust is dust all the world\nover, in every age, and the family likeness of dust-heaps is perfect.\nThe traveller, therefore, who visits the environs of Montrouge can go\ngo back in fancy without difficulty to the year 1850.\n\nIn this year I was making a prolonged stay in Paris. I was very much\nin love with a young lady who, though she returned my passion, so far\nyielded to the wishes of her parents that she had promised not to see\nme or to correspond with me for a year. I, too, had been compelled to\naccede to these conditions under a vague hope of parental approval.\nDuring the term of probation I had promised to remain out of the\ncountry and not to write to my dear one until the expiration of the\nyear.\n\nNaturally the time went heavily with me. There was not one of my own\nfamily or circle who could tell me of Alice, and none of her own folk\nhad, I am sorry to say, sufficient generosity to send me even an\noccasional word of comfort regarding her health and well-being. I\nspent six months wandering about Europe, but as I could find no\nsatisfactory distraction in travel, I determined to come to Paris,\nwhere, at least, I would be within easy hail of London in case any\ngood fortune should call me thither before the appointed time. That\n'hope deferred maketh the heart sick' was never better exemplified\nthan in my case, for in addition to the perpetual longing to see the\nface I loved there was always with me a harrowing anxiety lest some\naccident should prevent me showing Alice in due time that I had,\nthroughout the long period of probation, been faithful to her trust\nand my own love. Thus, every adventure which I undertook had a fierce\npleasure of its own, for it was fraught with possible consequences\ngreater than it would have ordinarily borne.\n\nLike all travellers I exhausted the places of most interest in the\nfirst month of my stay, and was driven in the second month to look for\namusement whithersoever I might. Having made sundry journeys to the\nbetter-known suburbs, I began to see that there was a _terra\nincognita_, in so far as the guide book was concerned, in the social\nwilderness lying between these attractive points. Accordingly I began\nto systematise my researches, and each day took up the thread of my\nexploration at the place where I had on the previous day dropped it.\n\nIn the process of time my wanderings led me near Montrouge, and I saw\nthat hereabouts lay the Ultima Thule of social exploration--a country\nas little known as that round the source of the White Nile. And so I\ndetermined to investigate philosophically the chiffonier--his habitat,\nhis life, and his means of life.\n\nThe job was an unsavoury one, difficult of accomplishment, and with\nlittle hope of adequate reward. However, despite reason, obstinacy\nprevailed, and I entered into my new investigation with a keener\nenergy than I could have summoned to aid me in any investigation\nleading to any end, valuable or worthy.\n\nOne day, late in a fine afternoon, toward the end of September, I\nentered the holy of holies of the city of dust. The place was\nevidently the recognised abode of a number of chiffoniers, for some\nsort of arrangement was manifested in the formation of the dust heaps\nnear the road. I passed amongst these heaps, which stood like orderly\nsentries, determined to penetrate further and trace dust to its\nultimate location.\n\nAs I passed along I saw behind the dust heaps a few forms that flitted\nto and fro, evidently watching with interest the advent of any\nstranger to such a place. The district was like a small Switzerland,\nand as I went forward my tortuous course shut out the path behind me.\n\nPresently I got into what seemed a small city or community of\nchiffoniers. There were a number of shanties or huts, such as may be\nmet with in the remote parts of the Bog of Allan--rude places with\nwattled walls, plastered with mud and roofs of rude thatch made from\nstable refuse--such places as one would not like to enter for any\nconsideration, and which even in water-colour could only look\npicturesque if judiciously treated. In the midst of these huts was one\nof the strangest adaptations--I cannot say habitations--I had ever\nseen. An immense old wardrobe, the colossal remnant of some boudoir of\nCharles VII, or Henry II, had been converted into a dwelling-house.\nThe double doors lay open, so that the entire m\u00c3\u00a9nage was open to\npublic view. In the open half of the wardrobe was a common\nsitting-room of some four feet by six, in which sat, smoking their\npipes round a charcoal brazier, no fewer than six old soldiers of the\nFirst Republic, with their uniforms torn and worn threadbare.\nEvidently they were of the _mauvais sujet_ class; their bleary eyes\nand limp jaws told plainly of a common love of absinthe; and their\neyes had that haggard, worn look of slumbering ferocity which follows\nhard in the wake of drink. The other side stood as of old, with its\nshelves intact, save that they were cut to half their depth, and in\neach shelf of which there were six, was a bed made with rags and\nstraw. The half-dozen of worthies who inhabited this structure looked\nat me curiously as I passed; and when I looked back after going a\nlittle way I saw their heads together in a whispered conference. I did\nnot like the look of this at all, for the place was very lonely, and\nthe men looked very, very villainous. However, I did not see any cause\nfor fear, and went on my way, penetrating further and further into the\nSahara. The way was tortuous to a degree, and from going round in a\nseries of semi-circles, as one goes in skating with the Dutch roll, I\ngot rather confused with regard to the points of the compass.\n\nWhen I had penetrated a little way I saw, as I turned the corner of a\nhalf-made heap, sitting on a heap of straw an old soldier with\nthreadbare coat.\n\n'Hallo!' said I to myself; 'the First Republic is well represented\nhere in its soldiery.'\n\nAs I passed him the old man never even looked up at me, but gazed on\nthe ground with stolid persistency. Again I remarked to myself: 'See\nwhat a life of rude warfare can do! This old man's curiosity is a\nthing of the past.'\n\nWhen I had gone a few steps, however, I looked back suddenly, and saw\nthat curiosity was not dead, for the veteran had raised his head and\nwas regarding me with a very queer expression. He seemed to me to look\nvery like one of the six worthies in the press. When he saw me looking\nhe dropped his head; and without thinking further of him I went on my\nway, satisfied that there was a strange likeness between these old\nwarriors.\n\nPresently I met another old soldier in a similar manner. He, too, did\nnot notice me whilst I was passing.\n\nBy this time it was getting late in the afternoon, and I began to\nthink of retracing my steps. Accordingly I turned to go back, but\ncould see a number of tracks leading between different mounds and\ncould not ascertain which of them I should take. In my perplexity I\nwanted to see someone of whom to ask the way, but could see no one. I\ndetermined to go on a few mounds further and so try to see\nsomeone--not a veteran.\n\nI gained my object, for after going a couple of hundred yards I saw\nbefore me a single shanty such as I had seen before--with, however,\nthe difference that this was not one for living in, but merely a roof\nwith three walls open in front. From the evidences which the\nneighbourhood exhibited I took it to be a place for sorting. Within it\nwas an old woman wrinkled and bent with age; I approached her to ask\nthe way.\n\nShe rose as I came close and I asked her my way. She immediately\ncommenced a conversation; and it occurred to me that here in the very\ncentre of the Kingdom of Dust was the place to gather details of the\nhistory of Parisian rag-picking--particularly as I could do so from\nthe lips of one who looked like the oldest inhabitant.\n\nI began my inquiries, and the old woman gave me most interesting\nanswers--she had been one of the ceteuces who sat daily before the\nguillotine and had taken an active part among the women who signalised\nthemselves by their violence in the revolution. While we were talking\nshe said suddenly: 'But m'sieur must be tired standing,' and dusted a\nrickety old stool for me to sit down. I hardly liked to do so for many\nreasons; but the poor old woman was so civil that I did not like to\nrun the risk of hurting her by refusing, and moreover the conversation\nof one who had been at the taking of the Bastille was so interesting\nthat I sat down and so our conversation went on.\n\nWhile we were talking an old man--older and more bent and wrinkled\neven than the woman--appeared from behind the shanty. 'Here is\nPierre,' said she. 'M'sieur can hear stories now if he wishes, for\nPierre was in everything, from the Bastille to Waterloo.' The old man\ntook another stool at my request and we plunged into a sea of\nrevolutionary reminiscences. This old man, albeit clothed like a\nscarecrow, was like any one of the six veterans.\n\nI was now sitting in the centre of the low hut with the woman on my\nleft hand and the man on my right, each of them being somewhat in\nfront of me. The place was full of all sorts of curious objects of\nlumber, and of many things that I wished far away. In one corner was a\nheap of rags which seemed to move from the number of vermin it\ncontained, and in the other a heap of bones whose odour was something\nshocking. Every now and then, glancing at the heaps, I could see the\ngleaming eyes of some of the rats which infested the place. These\nloathsome objects were bad enough, but what looked even more dreadful\nwas an old butcher's axe with an iron handle stained with clots of\nblood leaning up against the wall on the right hand side. Still, these\nthings did not give me much concern. The talk of the two old people\nwas so fascinating that I stayed on and on, till the evening came and\nthe dust heaps threw dark shadows over the vales between them.\n\nAfter a time I began to grow uneasy. I could not tell how or why, but\nsomehow I did not feel satisfied. Uneasiness is an instinct and means\nwarning. The psychic faculties are often the sentries of the\nintellect, and when they sound alarm the reason begins to act,\nalthough perhaps not consciously.\n\nThis was so with me. I began to bethink me where I was and by what\nsurrounded, and to wonder how I should fare in case I should be\nattacked; and then the thought suddenly burst upon me, although\nwithout any overt cause, that I was in danger. Prudence whispered: 'Be\nstill and make no sign,' and so I was still and made no sign, for I\nknew that four cunning eyes were on me. 'Four eyes--if not more.' My\nGod, what a horrible thought! The whole shanty might be surrounded on\nthree sides with villains! I might be in the midst of a band of such\ndesperadoes as only half a century of periodic revolution can produce.\n\nWith a sense of danger my intellect and observation quickened, and I\ngrew more watchful than was my wont. I noticed that the old woman's\neyes were constantly wandering towards my hands. I looked at them too,\nand saw the cause--my rings. On my left little finger I had a large\nsignet and on the right a good diamond.\n\nI thought that if there was any danger my first care was to avert\nsuspicion. Accordingly I began to work the conversation round to\nrag-picking--to the drains--of the things found there; and so by easy\nstages to jewels. Then, seizing a favourable opportunity, I asked the\nold woman if she knew anything of such things. She answered that she\ndid, a little. I held out my right hand, and, showing her the diamond,\nasked her what she thought of that. She answered that her eyes were\nbad, and stooped over my hand. I said as nonchalantly as I could:\n'Pardon me! You will see better thus!' and taking it off handed it to\nher. An unholy light came into her withered old face, as she touched\nit. She stole one glance at me swift and keen as a flash of lightning.\n\nShe bent over the ring for a moment, her face quite concealed as\nthough examining it. The old man looked straight out of the front of\nthe shanty before him, at the same time fumbling in his pockets and\nproducing a screw of tobacco in a paper and a pipe, which he proceeded\nto fill. I took advantage of the pause and the momentary rest from the\nsearching eyes on my face to look carefully round the place, now dim\nand shadowy in the gloaming. There still lay all the heaps of varied\nreeking foulness; there the terrible blood-stained axe leaning against\nthe wall in the right hand corner, and everywhere, despite the gloom,\nthe baleful glitter of the eyes of the rats. I could see them even\nthrough some of the chinks of the boards at the back low down close to\nthe ground. But stay! these latter eyes seemed more than usually large\nand bright and baleful!\n\nFor an instant my heart stood still, and I felt in that whirling\ncondition of mind in which one feels a sort of spiritual drunkenness,\nand as though the body is only maintained erect in that there is no\ntime for it to fall before recovery. Then, in another second, I was\ncalm--coldly calm, with all my energies in full vigour, with a\nself-control which I felt to be perfect and with all my feeling and\ninstincts alert.\n\nNow I knew the full extent of my danger: I was watched and surrounded\nby desperate people! I could not even guess at how many of them were\nlying there on the ground behind the shanty, waiting for the moment to\nstrike. I knew that I was big and strong, and they knew it, too. They\nknew also, as I did, that I was an Englishman and would make a fight\nfor it; and so we waited. I had, I felt, gained an advantage in the\nlast few seconds, for I knew my danger and understood the situation.\nNow, I thought, is the test of my courage--the enduring test: the\nfighting test may come later!\n\nThe old woman raised her head and said to me in a satisfied kind of\nway:\n\n'A very fine ring, indeed--a beautiful ring! Oh, me! I once had such\nrings, plenty of them, and bracelets and earrings! Oh! for in those\nfine days I led the town a dance! But they've forgotten me now!\nThey've forgotten me! They? Why they never heard of me! Perhaps their\ngrandfathers remember me, some of them!' and she laughed a harsh,\ncroaking laugh. And then I am bound to say that she astonished me, for\nshe handed me back the ring with a certain suggestion of old-fashioned\ngrace which was not without its pathos.\n\nThe old man eyed her with a sort of sudden ferocity, half rising from\nhis stool, and said to me suddenly and hoarsely:\n\n'Let me see!'\n\nI was about to hand the ring when the old woman said:\n\n'No! no, do not give it to Pierre! Pierre is eccentric. He loses\nthings; and such a pretty ring!'\n\n'Cat!' said the old man, savagely. Suddenly the old woman said, rather\nmore loudly than was necessary:\n\n'Wait! I shall tell you something about a ring.' There was something\nin the sound of her voice that jarred upon me. Perhaps it was my\nhyper-sensitiveness, wrought up as I was to such a pitch of nervous\nexcitement, but I seemed to think that she was not addressing me. As I\nstole a glance round the place I saw the eyes of the rats in the bone\nheaps, but missed the eyes along the back. But even as I looked I saw\nthem again appear. The old woman's 'Wait!' had given me a respite from\nattack, and the men had sunk back to their reclining posture.\n\n'I once lost a ring--a beautiful diamond hoop that had belonged to a\nqueen, and which was given to me by a farmer of the taxes, who\nafterwards cut his throat because I sent him away. I thought it must\nhave been stolen, and taxed my people; but I could get no trace. The\npolice came and suggested that it had found its way to the drain. We\ndescended--I in my fine clothes, for I would not trust them with my\nbeautiful ring! I know more of the drains since then, and of rats,\ntoo! but I shall never forget the horror of that place--alive with\nblazing eyes, a wall of them just outside the light of our torches.\nWell, we got beneath my house. We searched the outlet of the drain,\nand there in the filth found my ring, and we came out.\n\n'But we found something else also before we came! As we were coming\ntoward the opening a lot of sewer rats--human ones this time--came\ntowards us. They told the police that one of their number had gone\ninto the drain, but had not returned. He had gone in only shortly\nbefore we had, and, if lost, could hardly be far off. They asked help\nto seek him, so we turned back. They tried to prevent me going, but I\ninsisted. It was a new excitement, and had I not recovered my ring?\nNot far did we go till we came on something. There was but little\nwater, and the bottom of the drain was raised with brick, rubbish, and\nmuch matter of the kind. He had made a fight for it, even when his\ntorch had gone out. But they were too many for him! They had not been\nlong about it! The bones were still warm; but they were picked clean.\nThey had even eaten their own dead ones and there were bones of rats\nas well as of the man. They took it cool enough those other--the human\nones--and joked of their comrade when they found him dead, though they\nwould have helped him living. Bah! what matters it--life or death?'\n\n'And had you no fear?' I asked her.\n\n'Fear!' she said with a laugh. 'Me have fear? Ask Pierre! But I was\nyounger then, and, as I came through that horrible drain with its wall\nof greedy eyes, always moving with the circle of the light from the\ntorches, I did not feel easy. I kept on before the men, though! It is\na way I have! I never let the men get it before me. All I want is a\nchance and a means! And they ate him up--took every trace away except\nthe bones; and no one knew it, nor no sound of him was ever heard!'\nHere she broke into a chuckling fit of the ghastliest merriment which\nit was ever my lot to hear and see. A great poetess describes her\nheroine singing: 'Oh! to see or hear her singing! Scarce I know which\nis the divinest.'\n\nAnd I can apply the same idea to the old crone--in all save the\ndivinity, for I scarce could tell which was the most hellish--the\nharsh, malicious, satisfied, cruel laugh, or the leering grin, and the\nhorrible square opening of the mouth like a tragic mask, and the\nyellow gleam of the few discoloured teeth in the shapeless gums. In\nthat laugh and with that grin and the chuckling satisfaction I knew as\nwell as if it had been spoken to me in words of thunder that my murder\nwas settled, and the murderers only bided the proper time for its\naccomplishment. I could read between the lines of her gruesome story\nthe commands to her accomplices. 'Wait,' she seemed to say, 'bide your\ntime. I shall strike the first blow. Find the weapon for me, and I\nshall make the opportunity! He shall not escape! Keep him quiet, and\nthen no one will be wiser. There will be no outcry, and the rats will\ndo their work!'\n\nIt was growing darker and darker; the night was coming. I stole a\nglance round the shanty, still all the same! The bloody axe in the\ncorner, the heaps of filth, and the eyes on the bone heaps and in the\ncrannies of the floor.\n\nPierre had been still ostensibly filling his pipe; he now struck a\nlight and began to puff away at it. The old woman said:\n\n'Dear heart, how dark it is! Pierre, like a good lad, light the lamp!'\n\nPierre got up and with the lighted match in his hand touched the wick\nof a lamp which hung at one side of the entrance to the shanty, and\nwhich had a reflector that threw the light all over the place. It was\nevidently that which was used for their sorting at night.\n\n'Not that, stupid! Not that! the lantern!' she called out to him.\n\nHe immediately blew it out, saying: 'All right, mother I'll find it,'\nand he hustled about the left corner of the room--the old woman saying\nthrough the darkness:\n\n'The lantern! the lantern! Oh! That is the light that is most useful to\nus poor folks. The lantern was the friend of the revolution! It is the\nfriend of the chiffonier! It helps us when all else fails.'\n\nHardly had she said the word when there was a kind of creaking of the\nwhole place, and something was steadily dragged over the roof.\n\nAgain I seemed to read between the lines of her words. I knew the\nlesson of the lantern.\n\n'One of you get on the roof with a noose and strangle him as he passes\nout if we fail within.'\n\nAs I looked out of the opening I saw the loop of a rope outlined black\nagainst the lurid sky. I was now, indeed, beset!\n\nPierre was not long in finding the lantern. I kept my eyes fixed\nthrough the darkness on the old woman. Pierre struck his light, and by\nits flash I saw the old woman raise from the ground beside her where\nit had mysteriously appeared, and then hide in the folds of her gown,\na long sharp knife or dagger. It seemed to be like a butcher's\nsharpening iron fined to a keen point.\n\nThe lantern was lit.\n\n'Bring it here, Pierre,' she said. 'Place it in the doorway where we\ncan see it. See how nice it is! It shuts out the darkness from us; it\nis just right!'\n\nJust right for her and her purposes! It threw all its light on my\nface, leaving in gloom the faces of both Pierre and the woman, who sat\noutside of me on each side.\n\nI felt that the time of action was approaching, but I knew now that\nthe first signal and movement would come from the woman, and so\nwatched her.\n\nI was all unarmed, but I had made up my mind what to do. At the first\nmovement I would seize the butcher's axe in the right-hand corner and\nfight my way out. At least, I would die hard. I stole a glance round\nto fix its exact locality so that I could not fail to seize it at the\nfirst effort, for then, if ever, time and accuracy would be precious.\n\nGood God! It was gone! All the horror of the situation burst upon me;\nbut the bitterest thought of all was that if the issue of the terrible\nposition should be against me Alice would infallibly suffer. Either\nshe would believe me false--and any lover, or any one who has ever\nbeen one, can imagine the bitterness of the thought--or else she would\ngo on loving long after I had been lost to her and to the world, so\nthat her life would be broken and embittered, shattered with\ndisappointment and despair. The very magnitude of the pain braced me\nup and nerved me to bear the dread scrutiny of the plotters.\n\nI think I did not betray myself. The old woman was watching me as a\ncat does a mouse; she had her right hand hidden in the folds of her\ngown, clutching, I knew, that long, cruel-looking dagger. Had she seen\nany disappointment in my face she would, I felt, have known that the\nmoment had come, and would have sprung on me like a tigress, certain\nof taking me unprepared.\n\nI looked out into the night, and there I saw new cause for danger.\nBefore and around the hut were at a little distance some shadowy\nforms; they were quite still, but I knew that they were all alert and\non guard. Small chance for me now in that direction.\n\nAgain I stole a glance round the place. In moments of great excitement\nand of great danger, which is excitement, the mind works very quickly,\nand the keenness of the faculties which depend on the mind grows in\nproportion. I now felt this. In an instant I took in the whole\nsituation. I saw that the axe had been taken through a small hole made\nin one of the rotten boards. How rotten they must be to allow of such\na thing being done without a particle of noise.\n\nThe hut was a regular murder-trap, and was guarded all around. A\ngarroter lay on the roof ready to entangle me with his noose if I\nshould escape the dagger of the old hag. In front the way was guarded\nby I know not how many watchers. And at the back was a row of\ndesperate men--I had seen their eyes still through the crack in the\nboards of the floor, when last I looked--as they lay prone waiting for\nthe signal to start erect. If it was to be ever, now for it!\n\nAs nonchalantly as I could I turned slightly on my stool so as to get\nmy right leg well under me. Then with a sudden jump, turning my head,\nand guarding it with my hands, and with the fighting instinct of the\nknights of old, I breathed my lady's name, and hurled myself against\nthe back wall of the hut.\n\nWatchful as they were, the suddenness of my movement surprised both\nPierre and the old woman. As I crashed through the rotten timbers I\nsaw the old woman rise with a leap like a tiger and heard her low gasp\nof baffled rage. My feet lit on something that moved, and as I jumped\naway I knew that I had stepped on the back of one of the row of men\nlying on their faces outside the hut. I was torn with nails and\nsplinters, but otherwise unhurt. Breathless I rushed up the mound in\nfront of me, hearing as I went the dull crash of the shanty as it\ncollapsed into a mass.\n\nIt was a nightmare climb. The mound, though but low, was awfully\nsteep, and with each step I took the mass of dust and cinders tore\ndown with me and gave way under my feet. The dust rose and choked me;\nit was sickening, foetid, awful; but my climb was, I felt, for life or\ndeath, and I struggled on. The seconds seemed hours; but the few\nmoments I had in starting, combined with my youth and strength, gave\nme a great advantage, and, though several forms struggled after me in\ndeadly silence which was more dreadful than any sound, I easily\nreached the top. Since then I have climbed the cone of Vesuvius, and\nas I struggled up that dreary steep amid the sulphurous fumes the\nmemory of that awful night at Montrouge came back to me so vividly\nthat I almost grew faint.\n\nThe mound was one of the tallest in the region of dust, and as I\nstruggled to the top, panting for breath and with my heart beating\nlike a sledge-hammer, I saw away to my left the dull red gleam of the\nsky, and nearer still the flashing of lights. Thank God! I knew where\nI was now and where lay the road to Paris!\n\nFor two or three seconds I paused and looked back. My pursuers were\nstill well behind me, but struggling up resolutely, and in deadly\nsilence. Beyond, the shanty was a wreck--a mass of timber and moving\nforms. I could see it well, for flames were already bursting out; the\nrags and straw had evidently caught fire from the lantern. Still\nsilence there! Not a sound! These old wretches could die game, anyhow.\n\nI had no time for more than a passing glance, for as I cast an eye\nround the mound preparatory to making my descent I saw several dark\nforms rushing round on either side to cut me off on my way. It was now\na race for life. They were trying to head me on my way to Paris, and\nwith the instinct of the moment I dashed down to the right-hand side.\nI was just in time, for, though I came as it seemed to me down the\nsteep in a few steps, the wary old men who were watching me turned\nback, and one, as I rushed by into the opening between the two mounds\nin front, almost struck me a blow with that terrible butcher's axe.\nThere could surely not be two such weapons about!\n\nThen began a really horrible chase. I easily ran ahead of the old men,\nand even when some younger ones and a few women joined in the hunt I\neasily distanced them. But I did not know the way, and I could not\neven guide myself by the light in the sky, for I was running away from\nit. I had heard that, unless of conscious purpose, hunted men turn\nalways to the left, and so I found it now; and so, I suppose, knew\nalso my pursuers, who were more animals than men, and with cunning or\ninstinct had found out such secrets for themselves: for on finishing\na quick spurt, after which I intended to take a moment's breathing\nspace, I suddenly saw ahead of me two or three forms swiftly passing\nbehind a mound to the right.\n\nI was in the spider's web now indeed! But with the thought of this new\ndanger came the resource of the hunted, and so I darted down the next\nturning to the right. I continued in this direction for some hundred\nyards, and then, making a turn to the left again, felt certain that I\nhad, at any rate, avoided the danger of being surrounded.\n\nBut not of pursuit, for on came the rabble after me, steady, dogged,\nrelentless, and still in grim silence.\n\nIn the greater darkness the mounds seemed now to be somewhat smaller\nthan before, although--for the night was closing--they looked bigger\nin proportion. I was now well ahead of my pursuers, so I made a dart\nup the mound in front.\n\nOh joy of joys! I was close to the edge of this inferno of dustheaps.\nAway behind me the red light of Paris was in the sky, and towering up\nbehind rose the heights of Montmarte--a dim light, with here and there\nbrilliant points like stars.\n\nRestored to vigour in a moment, I ran over the few remaining mounds of\ndecreasing size, and found myself on the level land beyond. Even then,\nhowever, the prospect was not inviting. All before me was dark and\ndismal, and I had evidently come on one of those dank, low-lying waste\nplaces which are found here and there in the neighbourhood of great\ncities. Places of waste and desolation, where the space is required\nfor the ultimate agglomeration of all that is noxious, and the ground\nis so poor as to create no desire of occupancy even in the lowest\nsquatter. With eyes accustomed to the gloom of the evening, and away\nnow from the shadows of those dreadful dustheaps, I could see much\nmore easily than I could a little while ago. It might have been, of\ncourse, that the glare in the sky of the lights of Paris, though the\ncity was some miles away, was reflected here. Howsoever it was, I saw\nwell enough to take bearings for certainly some little distance around\nme.\n\nIn front was a bleak, flat waste that seemed almost dead level, with\nhere and there the dark shimmering of stagnant pools. Seemingly far\noff on the right, amid a small cluster of scattered lights, rose a\ndark mass of Fort Montrouge, and away to the left in the dim distance,\npointed with stray gleams from cottage windows, the lights in the sky\nshowed the locality of Bic\u00c3\u00aatre. A moment's thought decided me to take\nto the right and try to reach Montrouge. There at least would be some\nsort of safety, and I might possibly long before come on some of the\ncross roads which I knew. Somewhere, not far off, must lie the\nstrategic road made to connect the outlying chain of forts circling\nthe city.\n\nThen I looked back. Coming over the mounds, and outlined black against\nthe glare of the Parisian horizon, I saw several moving figures, and\nstill a way to the right several more deploying out between me and my\ndestination. They evidently meant to cut me off in this direction, and\nso my choice became constricted; it lay now between going straight\nahead or turning to the left. Stooping to the ground, so as to get the\nadvantage of the horizon as a line of sight, I looked carefully in\nthis direction, but could detect no sign of my enemies. I argued that\nas they had not guarded or were not trying to guard that point, there\nwas evidently danger to me there already. So I made up my mind to go\nstraight on before me.\n\nIt was not an inviting prospect, and as I went on the reality grew\nworse. The ground became soft and oozy, and now and again gave way\nbeneath me in a sickening kind of way. I seemed somehow to be going\ndown, for I saw round me places seemingly more elevated than where I\nwas, and this in a place which from a little way back seemed dead\nlevel. I looked around, but could see none of my pursuers. This was\nstrange, for all along these birds of the night had followed me\nthrough the darkness as well as though it was broad daylight. How I\nblamed myself for coming out in my light-coloured tourist suit of\ntweed. The silence, and my not being able to see my enemies, whilst I\nfelt that they were watching me, grew appalling, and in the hope of\nsome one not of this ghastly crew hearing me I raised my voice and\nshouted several times. There was not the slightest response; not even\nan echo rewarded my efforts. For a while I stood stock still and kept\nmy eyes in one direction. On one of the rising places around me I saw\nsomething dark move along, then another, and another. This was to my\nleft, and seemingly moving to head me off.\n\nI thought that again I might with my skill as a runner elude my\nenemies at this game, and so with all my speed darted forward.\n\nSplash!\n\nMy feet had given way in a mass of slimy rubbish, and I had fallen\nheadlong into a reeking, stagnant pool. The water and the mud in which\nmy arms sank up to the elbows was filthy and nauseous beyond\ndescription, and in the suddenness of my fall I had actually swallowed\nsome of the filthy stuff, which nearly choked me, and made me gasp\nfor breath. Never shall I forget the moments during which I stood\ntrying to recover myself almost fainting from the foetid odour of the\nfilthy pool, whose white mist rose ghostlike around. Worst of all,\nwith the acute despair of the hunted animal when he sees the pursuing\npack closing on him, I saw before my eyes whilst I stood helpless the\ndark forms of my pursuers moving swiftly to surround me.\n\nIt is curious how our minds work on odd matters even when the energies\nof thought are seemingly concentrated on some terrible and pressing\nneed. I was in momentary peril of my life: my safety depended on my\naction, and my choice of alternatives coming now with almost every\nstep I took, and yet I could not but think of the strange dogged\npersistency of these old men. Their silent resolution, their\nsteadfast, grim, persistency even in such a cause commanded, as well\nas fear, even a measure of respect. What must they have been in the\nvigour of their youth. I could understand now that whirlwind rush on\nthe bridge of Arcola, that scornful exclamation of the Old Guard at\nWaterloo! Unconscious cerebration has its own pleasures, even at such\nmoments; but fortunately it does not in any way clash with the thought\nfrom which action springs.\n\nI realised at a glance that so far I was defeated in my object, my\nenemies as yet had won. They had succeeded in surrounding me on three\nsides, and were bent on driving me off to the left-hand, where there\nwas already some danger for me, for they had left no guard. I accepted\nthe alternative--it was a case of Hobson's choice and run. I had to\nkeep the lower ground, for my pursuers were on the higher places.\nHowever, though the ooze and broken ground impeded me my youth and\ntraining made me able to hold my ground, and by keeping a diagonal\nline I not only kept them from gaining on me but even began to\ndistance them. This gave me new heart and strength, and by this time\nhabitual training was beginning to tell and my second wind had come.\nBefore me the ground rose slightly. I rushed up the slope and found\nbefore me a waste of watery slime, with a low dyke or bank looking\nblack and grim beyond. I felt that if I could but reach that dyke in\nsafety I could there, with solid ground under my feet and some kind of\npath to guide me, find with comparative ease a way out of my troubles.\nAfter a glance right and left and seeing no one near, I kept my eyes\nfor a few minutes to their rightful work of aiding my feet whilst I\ncrossed the swamp. It was rough, hard work, but there was little\ndanger, merely toil; and a short time took me to the dyke. I rushed up\nthe slope exulting; but here again I met a new shock. On either side\nof me rose a number of crouching figures. From right and left they\nrushed at me. Each body held a rope.\n\nThe cordon was nearly complete. I could pass on neither side, and the\nend was near.\n\nThere was only one chance, and I took it. I hurled myself across the\ndyke, and escaping out of the very clutches of my foes threw myself\ninto the stream.\n\nAt any other time I should have thought that water foul and filthy,\nbut now it was as welcome as the most crystal stream to the parched\ntraveller. It was a highway of safety!\n\nMy pursuers rushed after me. Had only one of them held the rope it\nwould have been all up with me, for he could have entangled me before\nI had time to swim a stroke; but the many hands holding it embarrassed\nand delayed them, and when the rope struck the water I heard the\nsplash well behind me. A few minutes' hard swimming took me across\nthe stream. Refreshed with the immersion and encouraged by the escape,\nI climbed the dyke in comparative gaiety of spirits.\n\nFrom the top I looked back. Through the darkness I saw my assailants\nscattering up and down along the dyke. The pursuit was evidently not\nended, and again I had to choose my course. Beyond the dyke where I\nstood was a wild, swampy space very similar to that which I had\ncrossed. I determined to shun such a place, and thought for a moment\nwhether I would take up or down the dyke. I thought I heard a\nsound--the muffled sound of oars, so I listened, and then shouted.\n\nNo response; but the sound ceased. My enemies had evidently got a boat\nof some kind. As they were on the up side of me I took the down path\nand began to run. As I passed to the left of where I had entered the\nwater I heard several splashes, soft and stealthy, like the sound a\nrat makes as he plunges into the stream, but vastly greater; and as I\nlooked I saw the dark sheen of the water broken by the ripples of\nseveral advancing heads. Some of my enemies were swimming the stream\nalso.\n\nAnd now behind me, up the stream, the silence was broken by the quick\nrattle and creak of oars; my enemies were in hot pursuit. I put my\nbest leg foremost and ran on. After a break of a couple of minutes I\nlooked back, and by a gleam of light through the ragged clouds I saw\nseveral dark forms climbing the bank behind me. The wind had now begun\nto rise, and the water beside me was ruffled and beginning to break in\ntiny waves on the bank. I had to keep my eyes pretty well on the\nground before me, lest I should stumble, for I knew that to stumble\nwas death. After a few minutes I looked back behind me. On the dyke\nwere only a few dark figures, but crossing the waste, swampy ground\nwere many more. What new danger this portended I did not know--could\nonly guess. Then as I ran it seemed to me that my track kept ever\nsloping away to the right. I looked up ahead and saw that the river\nwas much wider than before, and that the dyke on which I stood fell\nquite away, and beyond it was another stream on whose near bank I saw\nsome of the dark forms now across the marsh. I was on an island of\nsome kind.\n\nMy situation was now indeed terrible, for my enemies had hemmed me in\non every side. Behind came the quickening roll of the oars, as though\nmy pursuers knew that the end was close. Around me on every side was\ndesolation; there was not a roof or light, as far as I could see. Far\noff to the right rose some dark mass, but what it was I knew not. For\na moment I paused to think what I should do, not for more, for my\npursuers were drawing closer. Then my mind was made up. I slipped down\nthe bank and took to the water. I struck out straight ahead so as to\ngain the current by clearing the backwater of the island, for such I\npresume it was, when I had passed into the stream. I waited till a\ncloud came driving across the moon and leaving all in darkness. Then I\ntook off my hat and laid it softly on the water floating with the\nstream, and a second after dived to the right and struck out under\nwater with all my might. I was, I suppose, half a minute under water,\nand when I rose came up as softly as I could, and turning, looked\nback. There went my light brown hat floating merrily away. Close\nbehind it came a rickety old boat, driven furiously by a pair of oars.\nThe moon was still partly obscured by the drifting clouds, but in the\npartial light I could see a man in the bows holding aloft ready to\nstrike what appeared to me to be that same dreadful pole-axe which I\nhad before escaped. As I looked the boat drew closer, closer, and the\nman struck savagely. The hat disappeared. The man fell forward, almost\nout of the boat. His comrades dragged him in but without the axe, and\nthen as I turned with all my energies bent on reaching the further\nbank, I heard the fierce whirr of the muttered 'Sacre!' which marked\nthe anger of my baffled pursuers.\n\nThat was the first sound I had heard from human lips during all this\ndreadful chase, and full as it was of menace and danger to me it was a\nwelcome sound for it broke that awful silence which shrouded and\nappalled me. It was as though an overt sign that my opponents were men\nand not ghosts, and that with them I had, at least, the chance of a\nman, though but one against many.\n\nBut now that the spell of silence was broken the sounds came thick and\nfast. From boat to shore and back from shore to boat came quick\nquestion and answer, all in the fiercest whispers. I looked back--a\nfatal thing to do--for in the instant someone caught sight of my face,\nwhich showed white on the dark water, and shouted. Hands pointed to\nme, and in a moment or two the boat was under weigh, and following\nhard after me. I had but a little way to go, but quicker and quicker\ncame the boat after me. A few more strokes and I would be on the\nshore, but I felt the oncoming of the boat, and expected each second\nto feel the crash of an oar or other weapon on my head. Had I not seen\nthat dreadful axe disappear in the water I do not think that I could\nhave won the shore. I heard the muttered curses of those not rowing\nand the laboured breath of the rowers. With one supreme effort for\nlife or liberty I touched the bank and sprang up it. There was not a\nsingle second to spare, for hard behind me the boat grounded and\nseveral dark forms sprang after me. I gained the top of the dyke, and\nkeeping to the left ran on again. The boat put off and followed down\nthe stream. Seeing this I feared danger in this direction, and quickly\nturning, ran down the dyke on the other side, and after passing a\nshort stretch of marshy ground gained a wild, open flat country and\nsped on.\n\nStill behind me came on my relentless pursuers. Far away, below me, I\nsaw the same dark mass as before, but now grown closer and greater. My\nheart gave a great thrill of delight, for I knew that it must be the\nfortress of Bic\u00c3\u00aatre, and with new courage I ran on. I had heard that\nbetween each and all of the protecting forts of Paris there are\nstrategic ways, deep sunk roads where soldiers marching should be\nsheltered from an enemy. I knew that if I could gain this road I would\nbe safe, but in the darkness I could not see any sign of it, so, in\nblind hope of striking it, I ran on.\n\nPresently I came to the edge of a deep cut, and found that down below\nme ran a road guarded on each side by a ditch of water fenced on\neither side by a straight, high wall.\n\nGetting fainter and dizzier, I ran on; the ground got more\nbroken--more and more still, till I staggered and fell, and rose\nagain, and ran on in the blind anguish of the hunted. Again the\nthought of Alice nerved me. I would not be lost and wreck her life: I\nwould fight and struggle for life to the bitter end. With a great\neffort I caught the top of the wall. As, scrambling like a catamount,\nI drew myself up, I actually felt a hand touch the sole of my foot. I\nwas now on a sort of causeway, and before me I saw a dim light. Blind\nand dizzy, I ran on, staggered, and fell, rising, covered with dust\nand blood.\n\n'Halt la!'\n\nThe words sounded like a voice from heaven. A blaze of light seemed to\nenwrap me, and I shouted with joy.\n\n'Qui va la?' The rattle of musketry, the flash of steel before my\neyes. Instinctively I stopped, though close behind me came a rush of\nmy pursuers.\n\nAnother word or two, and out from a gateway poured, as it seemed to\nme, a tide of red and blue, as the guard turned out. All around seemed\nblazing with light, and the flash of steel, the clink and rattle of\narms, and the loud, harsh voices of command. As I fell forward,\nutterly exhausted, a soldier caught me. I looked back in dreadful\nexpectation, and saw the mass of dark forms disappearing into the\nnight. Then I must have fainted. When I recovered my senses I was in\nthe guard room. They gave me brandy, and after a while I was able to\ntell them something of what had passed. Then a commissary of police\nappeared, apparently out of the empty air, as is the way of the\nParisian police officer. He listened attentively, and then had a\nmoment's consultation with the officer in command. Apparently they\nwere agreed, for they asked me if I were ready now to come with them.\n\n'Where to?' I asked, rising to go.\n\n'Back to the dust heaps. We shall, perhaps, catch them yet!'\n\n'I shall try!' said I.\n\nHe eyed me for a moment keenly, and said suddenly:\n\n'Would you like to wait a while or till tomorrow, young Englishman?'\nThis touched me to the quick, as, perhaps, he intended, and I jumped\nto my feet.\n\n'Come now!' I said; 'now! now! An Englishman is always ready for his\nduty!'\n\nThe commissary was a good fellow, as well as a shrewd one; he slapped\nmy shoulder kindly. 'Brave gar\u00c3\u00a7on!' he said. 'Forgive me, but I knew\nwhat would do you most good. The guard is ready. Come!'\n\nAnd so, passing right through the guard room, and through a long\nvaulted passage, we were out into the night. A few of the men in front\nhad powerful lanterns. Through courtyards and down a sloping way we\npassed out through a low archway to a sunken road, the same that I had\nseen in my flight. The order was given to get at the double, and with\na quick, springing stride, half run, half walk, the soldiers went\nswiftly along. I felt my strength renewed again--such is the\ndifference between hunter and hunted. A very short distance took us to\na low-lying pontoon bridge across the stream, and evidently very\nlittle higher up than I had struck it. Some effort had evidently been\nmade to damage it, for the ropes had all been cut, and one of the\nchains had been broken. I heard the officer say to the commissary:\n\n'We are just in time! A few more minutes, and they would have\ndestroyed the bridge. Forward, quicker still!' and on we went. Again\nwe reached a pontoon on the winding stream; as we came up we heard the\nhollow boom of the metal drums as the efforts to destroy the bridge\nwas again renewed. A word of command was given, and several men raised\ntheir rifles.\n\n'Fire!' A volley rang out. There was a muffled cry, and the dark forms\ndispersed. But the evil was done, and we saw the far end of the\npontoon swing into the stream. This was a serious delay, and it was\nnearly an hour before we had renewed ropes and restored the bridge\nsufficiently to allow us to cross.\n\nWe renewed the chase. Quicker, quicker we went towards the dust\nheaps.\n\nAfter a time we came to a place that I knew. There were the remains of\na fire--a few smouldering wood ashes still cast a red glow, but the\nbulk of the ashes were cold. I knew the site of the hut and the hill\nbehind it up which I had rushed, and in the flickering glow the eyes\nof the rats still shone with a sort of phosphorescence. The commissary\nspoke a word to the officer, and he cried:\n\n'Halt!'\n\nThe soldiers were ordered to spread around and watch, and then we\ncommenced to examine the ruins. The commissary himself began to lift\naway the charred boards and rubbish. These the soldiers took and piled\ntogether. Presently he started back, then bent down and rising\nbeckoned me.\n\n'See!' he said.\n\nIt was a gruesome sight. There lay a skeleton face downwards, a woman\nby the lines--an old woman by the coarse fibre of the bone. Between\nthe ribs rose a long spike-like dagger made from a butcher's\nsharpening knife, its keen point buried in the spine.\n\n'You will observe,' said the commissary to the officer and to me as he\ntook out his note book, 'that the woman must have fallen on her\ndagger. The rats are many here--see their eyes glistening among that\nheap of bones--and you will also notice'--I shuddered as he placed his\nhand on the skeleton--'that but little time was lost by them, for the\nbones are scarcely cold!'\n\nThere was no other sign of any one near, living or dead; and so\ndeploying again into line the soldiers passed on. Presently we came to\nthe hut made of the old wardrobe. We approached. In five of the six\ncompartments was an old man sleeping--sleeping so soundly that even\nthe glare of the lanterns did not wake them. Old and grim and grizzled\nthey looked, with their gaunt, wrinkled, bronzed faces and their white\nmoustaches.\n\nThe officer called out harshly and loudly a word of command, and in an\ninstant each one of them was on his feet before us and standing at\n'attention!'\n\n'What do you here?'\n\n'We sleep,' was the answer.\n\n'Where are the other chiffoniers?' asked the commissary.\n\n'Gone to work.'\n\n'And you?'\n\n'We are on guard!'\n\n'Peste!' laughed the officer grimly, as he looked at the old men one\nafter the other in the face and added with cool deliberate cruelty:\n'Asleep on duty! Is this the manner of the Old Guard? No wonder, then,\na Waterloo!'\n\nBy the gleam of the lantern I saw the grim old faces grow deadly pale,\nand almost shuddered at the look in the eyes of the old men as the\nlaugh of the soldiers echoed the grim pleasantry of the officer.\n\nI felt in that moment that I was in some measure avenged.\n\nFor a moment they looked as if they would throw themselves on the\ntaunter, but years of their life had schooled them and they remained\nstill.\n\n'You are but five,' said the commissary; 'where is the sixth?' The\nanswer came with a grim chuckle.\n\n'He is there!' and the speaker pointed to the bottom of the wardrobe.\n'He died last night. You won't find much of him. The burial of the\nrats is quick!'\n\nThe commissary stooped and looked in. Then he turned to the officer\nand said calmly:\n\n'We may as well go back. No trace here now; nothing to prove that man\nwas the one wounded by your soldiers' bullets! Probably they murdered\nhim to cover up the trace. See!' again he stooped and placed his hands\non the skeleton. 'The rats work quickly and they are many. These bones\nare warm!'\n\nI shuddered, and so did many more of those around me.\n\n'Form!' said the officer, and so in marching order, with the lanterns\nswinging in front and the manacled veterans in the midst, with steady\ntramp we took ourselves out of the dustheaps and turned backward to\nthe fortress of Bic\u00c3\u00aatre.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy year of probation has long since ended, and Alice is my wife. But\nwhen I look back upon that trying twelvemonth one of the most vivid\nincidents that memory recalls is that associated with my visit to the\nCity of Dust.\n\n\n\n\nA Dream of Red Hands\n\n\nThe first opinion given to me regarding Jacob Settle was a simple\ndescriptive statement, 'He's a down-in-the-mouth chap': but I found\nthat it embodied the thoughts and ideas of all his fellow-workmen.\nThere was in the phrase a certain easy tolerance, an absence of\npositive feeling of any kind, rather than any complete opinion, which\nmarked pretty accurately the man's place in public esteem. Still,\nthere was some dissimilarity between this and his appearance which\nunconsciously set me thinking, and by degrees, as I saw more of the\nplace and the workmen, I came to have a special interest in him. He\nwas, I found, for ever doing kindnesses, not involving money expenses\nbeyond his humble means, but in the manifold ways of forethought and\nforbearance and self-repression which are of the truer charities of\nlife. Women and children trusted him implicitly, though, strangely\nenough, he rather shunned them, except when anyone was sick, and then\nhe made his appearance to help if he could, timidly and awkwardly. He\nled a very solitary life, keeping house by himself in a tiny cottage,\nor rather hut, of one room, far on the edge of the moorland. His\nexistence seemed so sad and solitary that I wished to cheer it up, and\nfor the purpose took the occasion when we had both been sitting up\nwith a child, injured by me through accident, to offer to lend him\nbooks. He gladly accepted, and as we parted in the grey of the dawn I\nfelt that something of mutual confidence had been established between\nus.\n\nThe books were always most carefully and punctually returned, and in\ntime Jacob Settle and I became quite friends. Once or twice as I\ncrossed the moorland on Sundays I looked in on him; but on such\noccasions he was shy and ill at ease so that I felt diffident about\ncalling to see him. He would never under any circumstances come into\nmy own lodgings.\n\nOne Sunday afternoon, I was coming back from a long walk beyond the\nmoor, and as I passed Settle's cottage stopped at the door to say 'How\ndo you do?' to him. As the door was shut, I thought that he was out,\nand merely knocked for form's sake, or through habit, not expecting to\nget any answer. To my surprise, I heard a feeble voice from within,\nthough what was said I could not hear. I entered at once, and found\nJacob lying half-dressed upon his bed. He was as pale as death, and\nthe sweat was simply rolling off his face. His hands were\nunconsciously gripping the bedclothes as a drowning man holds on to\nwhatever he may grasp. As I came in he half arose, with a wild, hunted\nlook in his eyes, which were wide open and staring, as though\nsomething of horror had come before him; but when he recognised me he\nsank back on the couch with a smothered sob of relief and closed his\neyes. I stood by him for a while, quite a minute or two, while he\ngasped. Then he opened his eyes and looked at me, but with such a\ndespairing, woeful expression that, as I am a living man, I would have\nrather seen that frozen look of horror. I sat down beside him and\nasked after his health. For a while he would not answer me except to\nsay that he was not ill; but then, after scrutinising me closely, he\nhalf arose on his elbow and said:\n\n'I thank you kindly, sir, but I'm simply telling you the truth. I am\nnot ill, as men call it, though God knows whether there be not worse\nsicknesses than doctors know of. I'll tell you, as you are so kind,\nbut I trust that you won't even mention such a thing to a living soul,\nfor it might work me more and greater woe. I am suffering from a bad\ndream.'\n\n'A bad dream!' I said, hoping to cheer him; 'but dreams pass away with\nthe light--even with waking.' There I stopped, for before he spoke I\nsaw the answer in his desolate look round the little place.\n\n'No! no! that's all well for people that live in comfort and with\nthose they love around them. It is a thousand times worse for those\nwho live alone and have to do so. What cheer is there for me, waking\nhere in the silence of the night, with the wide moor around me full of\nvoices and full of faces that make my waking a worse dream than my\nsleep? Ah, young sir, you have no past that can send its legions to\npeople the darkness and the empty space, and I pray the good God that\nyou may never have!' As he spoke, there was such an almost\nirresistible gravity of conviction in his manner that I abandoned my\nremonstrance about his solitary life. I felt that I was in the\npresence of some secret influence which I could not fathom. To my\nrelief, for I knew not what to say, he went on:\n\n'Two nights past have I dreamed it. It was hard enough the first\nnight, but I came through it. Last night the expectation was in itself\nalmost worse than the dream--until the dream came, and then it swept\naway every remembrance of lesser pain. I stayed awake till just\nbefore the dawn, and then it came again, and ever since I have been in\nsuch an agony as I am sure the dying feel, and with it all the dread\nof tonight.' Before he had got to the end of the sentence my mind was\nmade up, and I felt that I could speak to him more cheerfully.\n\n'Try and get to sleep early tonight--in fact, before the evening has\npassed away. The sleep will refresh you, and I promise you there will\nnot be any bad dreams after tonight.' He shook his head hopelessly, so\nI sat a little longer and then left him.\n\nWhen I got home I made my arrangements for the night, for I had made\nup my mind to share Jacob Settle's lonely vigil in his cottage on the\nmoor. I judged that if he got to sleep before sunset he would wake\nwell before midnight, and so, just as the bells of the city were\nstriking eleven, I stood opposite his door armed with a bag, in which\nwere my supper, an extra large flask, a couple of candles, and a book.\nThe moonlight was bright, and flooded the whole moor, till it was\nalmost as light as day; but ever and anon black clouds drove across\nthe sky, and made a darkness which by comparison seemed almost\ntangible. I opened the door softly, and entered without waking Jacob,\nwho lay asleep with his white face upward. He was still, and again\nbathed in sweat. I tried to imagine what visions were passing before\nthose closed eyes which could bring with them the misery and woe which\nwere stamped on the face, but fancy failed me, and I waited for the\nawakening. It came suddenly, and in a fashion which touched me to the\nquick, for the hollow groan that broke from the man's white lips as he\nhalf arose and sank back was manifestly the realisation or completion\nof some train of thought which had gone before.\n\n'If this be dreaming,' said I to myself, 'then it must be based on\nsome very terrible reality. What can have been that unhappy fact that\nhe spoke of?'\n\nWhile I thus spoke, he realised that I was with him. It struck me as\nstrange that he had no period of that doubt as to whether dream or\nreality surrounded him which commonly marks an expected environment of\nwaking men. With a positive cry of joy, he seized my hand and held it\nin his two wet, trembling hands, as a frightened child clings on to\nsomeone whom it loves. I tried to soothe him:\n\n'There, there! it is all right. I have come to stay with you tonight,\nand together we will try to fight this evil dream.' He let go my hand\nsuddenly, and sank back on his bed and covered his eyes with his\nhands.\n\n'Fight it?--the evil dream! Ah! no, sir, no! No mortal power can fight\nthat dream, for it comes from God--and is burned in here;' and he beat\nupon his forehead. Then he went on:\n\n'It is the same dream, ever the same, and yet it grows in its power to\ntorture me every time it comes.'\n\n'What is the dream?' I asked, thinking that the speaking of it might\ngive him some relief, but he shrank away from me, and after a long\npause said:\n\n'No, I had better not tell it. It may not come again.'\n\nThere was manifestly something to conceal from me--something that lay\nbehind the dream, so I answered:\n\n'All right. I hope you have seen the last of it. But if it should come\nagain, you will tell me, will you not? I ask, not out of curiosity,\nbut because I think it may relieve you to speak.' He answered with\nwhat I thought was almost an undue amount of solemnity:\n\n'If it comes again, I shall tell you all.'\n\nThen I tried to get his mind away from the subject to more mundane\nthings, so I produced supper, and made him share it with me, including\nthe contents of the flask. After a little he braced up, and when I lit\nmy cigar, having given him another, we smoked a full hour, and talked\nof many things. Little by little the comfort of his body stole over\nhis mind, and I could see sleep laying her gentle hands on his\neyelids. He felt it, too, and told me that now he felt all right, and\nI might safely leave him; but I told him that, right or wrong, I was\ngoing to see in the daylight. So I lit my other candle, and began to\nread as he fell asleep.\n\nBy degrees I got interested in my book, so interested that presently I\nwas startled by its dropping out of my hands. I looked and saw that\nJacob was still asleep, and I was rejoiced to see that there was on\nhis face a look of unwonted happiness, while his lips seemed to move\nwith unspoken words. Then I turned to my work again, and again woke,\nbut this time to feel chilled to my very marrow by hearing the voice\nfrom the bed beside me:\n\n'Not with those red hands! Never! never!' On looking at him, I found\nthat he was still asleep. He woke, however, in an instant, and did not\nseem surprised to see me; there was again that strange apathy as to\nhis surroundings. Then I said:\n\n'Settle, tell me your dream. You may speak freely, for I shall hold\nyour confidence sacred. While we both live I shall never mention what\nyou may choose to tell me.'\n\nHe replied:\n\n'I said I would; but I had better tell you first what goes before the\ndream, that you may understand. I was a schoolmaster when I was a very\nyoung man; it was only a parish school in a little village in the\nWest Country. No need to mention any names. Better not. I was engaged\nto be married to a young girl whom I loved and almost reverenced. It\nwas the old story. While we were waiting for the time when we could\nafford to set up house together, another man came along. He was nearly\nas young as I was, and handsome, and a gentleman, with all a\ngentleman's attractive ways for a woman of our class. He would go\nfishing, and she would meet him while I was at my work in school. I\nreasoned with her and implored her to give him up. I offered to get\nmarried at once and go away and begin the world in a strange country;\nbut she would not listen to anything I could say, and I could see that\nshe was infatuated with him. Then I took it on myself to meet the man\nand ask him to deal well with the girl, for I thought he might mean\nhonestly by her, so that there might be no talk or chance of talk on\nthe part of others. I went where I should meet him with none by, and\nwe met!' Here Jacob Settle had to pause, for something seemed to rise\nin his throat, and he almost gasped for breath. Then he went on:\n\n'Sir, as God is above us, there was no selfish thought in my heart\nthat day, I loved my pretty Mabel too well to be content with a part\nof her love, and I had thought of my own unhappiness too often not to\nhave come to realise that, whatever might come to her, my hope was\ngone. He was insolent to me--you, sir, who are a gentleman, cannot\nknow, perhaps, how galling can be the insolence of one who is above\nyou in station--but I bore with that. I implored him to deal well with\nthe girl, for what might be only a pastime of an idle hour with him\nmight be the breaking of her heart. For I never had a thought of her\ntruth, or that the worst of harm could come to her--it was only the\nunhappiness to her heart I feared. But when I asked him when he\nintended to marry her his laughter galled me so that I lost my temper\nand told him that I would not stand by and see her life made unhappy.\nThen he grew angry too, and in his anger said such cruel things of her\nthat then and there I swore he should not live to do her harm. God\nknows how it came about, for in such moments of passion it is hard to\nremember the steps from a word to a blow, but I found myself standing\nover his dead body, with my hands crimson with the blood that welled\nfrom his torn throat. We were alone and he was a stranger, with none\nof his kin to seek for him and murder does not always out--not all at\nonce. His bones may be whitening still, for all I know, in the pool of\nthe river where I left him. No one suspected his absence, or why it\nwas, except my poor Mabel, and she dared not speak. But it was all in\nvain, for when I came back again after an absence of months--for I\ncould not live in the place--I learned that her shame had come and\nthat she had died in it. Hitherto I had been borne up by the thought\nthat my ill deed had saved her future, but now, when I learned that I\nhad been too late, and that my poor love was smirched with that man's\nsin, I fled away with the sense of my useless guilt upon me more\nheavily than I could bear. Ah! sir, you that have not done such a sin\ndon't know what it is to carry it with you. You may think that custom\nmakes it easy to you, but it is not so. It grows and grows with every\nhour, till it becomes intolerable, and with it growing, too, the\nfeeling that you must for ever stand outside Heaven. You don't know\nwhat that means, and I pray God that you never may. Ordinary men, to\nwhom all things are possible, don't often, if ever, think of Heaven.\nIt is a name, and nothing more, and they are content to wait and let\nthings be, but to those who are doomed to be shut out for ever you\ncannot think what it means, you cannot guess or measure the terrible\nendless longing to see the gates opened, and to be able to join the\nwhite figures within.\n\n'And this brings me to my dream. It seemed that the portal was before\nme, with great gates of massive steel with bars of the thickness of a\nmast, rising to the very clouds, and so close that between them was\njust a glimpse of a crystal grotto, on whose shining walls were\nfigured many white-clad forms with faces radiant with joy. When I\nstood before the gate my heart and my soul were so full of rapture and\nlonging that I forgot. And there stood at the gate two mighty angels\nwith sweeping wings, and, oh! so stern of countenance. They held each\nin one hand a flaming sword, and in the other the latchet, which moved\nto and fro at their lightest touch. Nearer were figures all draped in\nblack, with heads covered so that only the eyes were seen, and they\nhanded to each who came white garments such as the angels wear. A low\nmurmur came that told that all should put on their own robes, and\nwithout soil, or the angels would not pass them in, but would smite\nthem down with the flaming swords. I was eager to don my own garment,\nand hurriedly threw it over me and stepped swiftly to the gate; but it\nmoved not, and the angels, loosing the latchet, pointed to my dress, I\nlooked down, and was aghast, for the whole robe was smeared with\nblood. My hands were red; they glittered with the blood that dripped\nfrom them as on that day by the river bank. And then the angels raised\ntheir flaming swords to smite me down, and the horror was complete--I\nawoke. Again, and again, and again, that awful dream comes to me. I\nnever learn from the experience, I never remember, but at the\nbeginning the hope is ever there to make the end more appalling; and I\nknow that the dream does not come out of the common darkness where the\ndreams abide, but that it is sent from God as a punishment! Never,\nnever shall I be able to pass the gate, for the soil on the angel\ngarments must ever come from these bloody hands!'\n\nI listened as in a spell as Jacob Settle spoke. There was something so\nfar away in the tone of his voice--something so dreamy and mystic in\nthe eyes that looked as if through me at some spirit beyond--something\nso lofty in his very diction and in such marked contrast to his\nworkworn clothes and his poor surroundings that I wondered if the\nwhole thing were not a dream.\n\nWe were both silent for a long time. I kept looking at the man before\nme in growing wonderment. Now that his confession had been made, his\nsoul, which had been crushed to the very earth, seemed to leap back\nagain to uprightness with some resilient force. I suppose I ought to\nhave been horrified with his story, but, strange to say, I was not. It\ncertainly is not pleasant to be made the recipient of the confidence\nof a murderer, but this poor fellow seemed to have had, not only so\nmuch provocation, but so much self-denying purpose in his deed of\nblood that I did not feel called upon to pass judgment upon him. My\npurpose was to comfort, so I spoke out with what calmness I could, for\nmy heart was beating fast and heavily:\n\n'You need not despair, Jacob Settle. God is very good, and His mercy\nis great. Live on and work on in the hope that some day you may feel\nthat you have atoned for the past.' Here I paused, for I could see\nthat deep, natural sleep this time, was creeping upon him. 'Go to\nsleep,' I said; 'I shall watch with you here and we shall have no more\nevil dreams tonight.'\n\nHe made an effort to pull himself together, and answered:\n\n'I don't know how to thank you for your goodness to me this night, but\nI think you had best leave me now. I'll try and sleep this out; I feel\na weight off my mind since I have told you all. If there's anything of\nthe man left in me, I must try and fight out life alone.'\n\n'I'll go tonight, as you wish it,' I said; 'but take my advice, and do\nnot live in such a solitary way. Go among men and women; live among\nthem. Share their joys and sorrows, and it will help you to forget.\nThis solitude will make you melancholy mad.'\n\n'I will!' he answered, half unconsciously, for sleep was overmastering\nhim.\n\nI turned to go, and he looked after me. When I had touched the latch I\ndropped it, and, coming back to the bed, held out my hand. He grasped\nit with both his as he rose to a sitting posture, and I said my\ngoodnight, trying to cheer him:\n\n'Heart, man, heart! There is work in the world for you to do, Jacob\nSettle. You can wear those white robes yet and pass through that gate\nof steel!'\n\nThen I left him.\n\nA week after I found his cottage deserted, and on asking at the works\nwas told that he had 'gone north', no one exactly knew whither.\n\nTwo years afterwards, I was staying for a few days with my friend Dr.\nMunro in Glasgow. He was a busy man, and could not spare much time for\ngoing about with me, so I spent my days in excursions to the Trossachs\nand Loch Katrine and down the Clyde. On the second last evening of my\nstay I came back somewhat later than I had arranged, but found that\nmy host was late too. The maid told me that he had been sent for to\nthe hospital--a case of accident at the gas-works, and the dinner was\npostponed an hour; so telling her I would stroll down to find her\nmaster and walk back with him, I went out. At the hospital I found him\nwashing his hands preparatory to starting for home. Casually, I asked\nhim what his case was.\n\n'Oh, the usual thing! A rotten rope and men's lives of no account. Two\nmen were working in a gasometer, when the rope that held their\nscaffolding broke. It must have occurred just before the dinner hour,\nfor no one noticed their absence till the men had returned. There was\nabout seven feet of water in the gasometer, so they had a hard fight\nfor it, poor fellows. However, one of them was alive, just alive, but\nwe have had a hard job to pull him through. It seems that he owes his\nlife to his mate, for I have never heard of greater heroism. They swam\ntogether while their strength lasted, but at the end they were so done\nup that even the lights above, and the men slung with ropes, coming\ndown to help them, could not keep them up. But one of them stood on\nthe bottom and held up his comrade over his head, and those few\nbreaths made all the difference between life and death. They were a\nshocking sight when they were taken out, for that water is like a\npurple dye with the gas and the tar. The man upstairs looked as if he\nhad been washed in blood. Ugh!'\n\n'And the other?'\n\n'Oh, he's worse still. But he must have been a very noble fellow. That\nstruggle under the water must have been fearful; one can see that by\nthe way the blood has been drawn from the extremities. It makes the\nidea of the _Stigmata_ possible to look at him. Resolution like this\ncould, you would think, do anything in the world. Ay! it might almost\nunbar the gates of Heaven. Look here, old man, it is not a very\npleasant sight, especially just before dinner, but you are a writer,\nand this is an odd case. Here is something you would not like to miss,\nfor in all human probability you will never see anything like it\nagain.' While he was speaking he had brought me into the mortuary of\nthe hospital.\n\nOn the bier lay a body covered with a white sheet, which was wrapped\nclose round it.\n\n'Looks like a chrysalis, don't it? I say, Jack, if there be anything\nin the old myth that a soul is typified by a butterfly, well, then the\none that this chrysalis sent forth was a very noble specimen and took\nall the sunlight on its wings. See here!' He uncovered the face.\nHorrible, indeed, it looked, as though stained with blood. But I knew\nhim at once, Jacob Settle! My friend pulled the winding sheet further\ndown.\n\nThe hands were crossed on the purple breast as they had been\nreverently placed by some tender-hearted person. As I saw them my\nheart throbbed with a great exultation, for the memory of his\nharrowing dream rushed across my mind. There was no stain now on those\npoor, brave hands, for they were blanched white as snow.\n\nAnd somehow as I looked I felt that the evil dream was all over. That\nnoble soul had won a way through the gate at last. The white robe had\nnow no stain from the hands that had put it on.\n\n\n\n\nCrooken Sands\n\n\nMr Arthur Fernlee Markam, who took what was known as the Red House\nabove the Mains of Crooken, was a London merchant, and being\nessentially a cockney, thought it necessary when he went for the\nsummer holidays to Scotland to provide an entire rig-out as a Highland\nchieftain, as manifested in chromolithographs and on the music-hall\nstage. He had once seen in the Empire the Great Prince--'The Bounder\nKing'--bring down the house by appearing as 'The MacSlogan of that\nIlk,' and singing the celebrated Scotch song, 'There's naething like\nhaggis to mak a mon dry!' and he had ever since preserved in his mind\na faithful image of the picturesque and warlike appearance which he\npresented. Indeed, if the true inwardness of Mr. Markam's mind on the\nsubject of his selection of Aberdeenshire as a summer resort were\nknown, it would be found that in the foreground of the holiday\nlocality which his fancy painted stalked the many hued figure of the\nMacSlogan of that Ilk. However, be this as it may, a very kind\nfortune--certainly so far as external beauty was concerned--led him to\nthe choice of Crooken Bay. It is a lovely spot, between Aberdeen and\nPeterhead, just under the rock-bound headland whence the long,\ndangerous reefs known as The Spurs run out into the North Sea.\nBetween this and the 'Mains of Crooken'--a village sheltered by the\nnorthern cliffs--lies the deep bay, backed with a multitude of\nbent-grown dunes where the rabbits are to be found in thousands. Thus\nat either end of the bay is a rocky promontory, and when the dawn or\nthe sunset falls on the rocks of red syenite the effect is very\nlovely. The bay itself is floored with level sand and the tide runs\nfar out, leaving a smooth waste of hard sand on which are dotted here\nand there the stake nets and bag nets of the salmon fishers. At one\nend of the bay there is a little group or cluster of rocks whose heads\nare raised something above high water, except when in rough weather\nthe waves come over them green. At low tide they are exposed down to\nsand level; and here is perhaps the only little bit of dangerous sand\non this part of the eastern coast. Between the rocks, which are apart\nabout some fifty feet, is a small quicksand, which, like the Goodwins,\nis dangerous only with the incoming tide. It extends outwards till it\nis lost in the sea, and inwards till it fades away in the hard sand of\nthe upper beach. On the slope of the hill which rises beyond the\ndunes, midway between the Spurs and the Port of Crooken, is the Red\nHouse. It rises from the midst of a clump of fir-trees which protect\nit on three sides, leaving the whole sea front open. A trim\nold-fashioned garden stretches down to the roadway, on crossing which\na grassy path, which can be used for light vehicles, threads a way to\nthe shore, winding amongst the sand hills.\n\nWhen the Markam family arrived at the Red House after their thirty-six\nhours of pitching on the Aberdeen steamer _Ban Righ_ from Blackwall,\nwith the subsequent train to Yellon and drive of a dozen miles, they\nall agreed that they had never seen a more delightful spot. The\ngeneral satisfaction was more marked as at that very time none of the\nfamily were, for several reasons, inclined to find favourable anything\nor any place over the Scottish border. Though the family was a large\none, the prosperity of the business allowed them all sorts of personal\nluxuries, amongst which was a wide latitude in the way of dress. The\nfrequency of the Markam girls' new frocks was a source of envy to\ntheir bosom friends and of joy to themselves.\n\nArthur Fernlee Markam had not taken his family into his confidence\nregarding his new costume. He was not quite certain that he should be\nfree from ridicule, or at least from sarcasm, and as he was sensitive\non the subject, he thought it better to be actually in the suitable\nenvironment before he allowed the full splendour to burst upon them.\nHe had taken some pains, to insure the completeness of the Highland\ncostume. For the purpose he had paid many visits to 'The Scotch\nAll-Wool Tartan Clothing Mart' which had been lately established in\nCopthall-court by the Messrs. MacCallum More and Roderick MacDhu. He\nhad anxious consultations with the head of the firm--MacCallum as he\ncalled himself, resenting any such additions as 'Mr.' or 'Esquire.'\nThe known stock of buckles, buttons, straps, brooches and ornaments of\nall kinds were examined in critical detail; and at last an eagle's\nfeather of sufficiently magnificent proportions was discovered, and\nthe equipment was complete. It was only when he saw the finished\ncostume, with the vivid hues of the tartan seemingly modified into\ncomparative sobriety by the multitude of silver fittings, the\ncairngorm brooches, the philibeg, dirk and sporran that he was fully\nand absolutely satisfied with his choice. At first he had thought of\nthe Royal Stuart dress tartan, but abandoned it on the MacCallum\npointing out that if he should happen to be in the neighbourhood of\nBalmoral it might lead to complications. The MacCallum, who, by the\nway, spoke with a remarkable cockney accent, suggested other plaids in\nturn; but now that the other question of accuracy had been raised, Mr.\nMarkam foresaw difficulties if he should by chance find himself in the\nlocality of the clan whose colours he had usurped. The MacCallum at\nlast undertook to have, at Markam's expense, a special pattern woven\nwhich would not be exactly the same as any existing tartan, though\npartaking of the characteristics of many. It was based on the Royal\nStuart, but contained suggestions as to simplicity of pattern from the\nMacalister and Ogilvie clans, and as to neutrality of colour from the\nclans of Buchanan, Macbeth, Chief of Macintosh and Macleod. When the\nspecimen had been shown to Markam he had feared somewhat lest it\nshould strike the eye of his domestic circle as gaudy; but as Roderick\nMacDhu fell into perfect ecstasies over its beauty he did not make any\nobjection to the completion of the piece. He thought, and wisely, that\nif a genuine Scotchman like MacDhu liked it, it must be\nright--especially as the junior partner was a man very much of his own\nbuild and appearance. When the MacCallum was receiving his\ncheque--which, by the way, was a pretty stiff one--he remarked:\n\n'I've taken the liberty of having some more of the stuff woven in case\nyou or any of your friends should want it.' Markam was gratified, and\ntold him that he should be only too happy if the beautiful stuff which\nthey had originated between them should become a favourite, as he had\nno doubt it would in time. He might make and sell as much as he would.\n\nMarkam tried the dress on in his office one evening after the clerks\nhad all gone home. He was pleased, though a little frightened, at the\nresult. The MacCallum had done his work thoroughly, and there was\nnothing omitted that could add to the martial dignity of the wearer.\n\n'I shall not, of course, take the claymore and the pistols with me on\nordinary occasions,' said Markam to himself as he began to undress. He\ndetermined that he would wear the dress for the first time on landing\nin Scotland, and accordingly on the morning when the _Ban Righ_ was\nhanging off the Girdle Ness lighthouse, waiting for the tide to enter\nthe port of Aberdeen, he emerged from his cabin in all the gaudy\nsplendour of his new costume. The first comment he heard was from one\nof his own sons, who did not recognise him at first.\n\n'Here's a guy! Great Scott! It's the governor!' And the boy fled\nforthwith and tried to bury his laughter under a cushion in the\nsaloon. Markam was a good sailor and had not suffered from the\npitching of the boat, so that his naturally rubicund face was even\nmore rosy by the conscious blush which suffused his cheeks when he had\nfound himself at once the cynosure of all eyes. He could have wished\nthat he had not been so bold for he knew from the cold that there was\na big bare spot under one side of his jauntily worn Glengarry cap.\nHowever, he faced the group of strangers boldly. He was not,\noutwardly, upset even when some of the comments reached his ears.\n\n'He's off his bloomin' chump,' said a cockney in a suit of exaggerated\nplaid.\n\n'There's flies on him,' said a tall thin Yankee, pale with\nsea-sickness, who was on his way to take up his residence for a time\nas close as he could get to the gates of Balmoral.\n\n'Happy thought! Let us fill our mulls; now's the chance!' said a\nyoung Oxford man on his way home to Inverness. But presently Mr.\nMarkam heard the voice of his eldest daughter.\n\n'Where is he? Where is he?' and she came tearing along the deck with\nher hat blowing behind her. Her face showed signs of agitation, for\nher mother had just been telling her of her father's condition; but\nwhen she saw him she instantly burst into laughter so violent that it\nended in a fit of hysterics. Something of the same kind happened to\neach of the other children. When they had all had their turn Mr.\nMarkam went to his cabin and sent his wife's maid to tell each member\nof the family that he wanted to see them at once. They all made their\nappearance, suppressing their feelings as well as they could. He said\nto them very quietly:\n\n'My dears, don't I provide you all with ample allowances?'\n\n'Yes, father!' they all answered gravely, 'no one could be more\ngenerous!'\n\n'Don't I let you dress as you please?'\n\n'Yes, father!'--this a little sheepishly.\n\n'Then, my dears, don't you think it would be nicer and kinder of you\nnot to try and make me feel uncomfortable, even if I do assume a dress\nwhich is ridiculous in your eyes, though quite common enough in the\ncountry where we are about to sojourn?' There was no answer except\nthat which appeared in their hanging heads. He was a good father and\nthey all knew it. He was quite satisfied and went on:\n\n'There, now, run away and enjoy yourselves! We shan't have another\nword about it.' Then he went on deck again and stood bravely the fire\nof ridicule which he recognised around him, though nothing more was\nsaid within his hearing.\n\nThe astonishment and the amusement which his get-up occasioned on the\n_Ban Righ_ was, however, nothing to that which it created in Aberdeen.\nThe boys and loafers, and women with babies, who waited at the landing\nshed, followed _en masse_ as the Markam party took their way to the\nrailway station; even the porters with their old-fashioned knots and\ntheir new-fashioned barrows, who await the traveller at the foot of\nthe gang-plank, followed in wondering delight. Fortunately the\nPeterhead train was just about to start, so that the martyrdom was not\nunnecessarily prolonged. In the carriage the glorious Highland costume\nwas unseen, and as there were but few persons at the station at\nYellon, all went well there. When, however, the carriage drew near the\nMains of Crooken and the fisher folk had run to their doors to see who\nit was that was passing, the excitement exceeded all bounds. The\nchildren with one impulse waved their bonnets and ran shouting behind\nthe carriage; the men forsook their nets and their baiting and\nfollowed; the women clutched their babies, and followed also. The\nhorses were tired after their long journey to Yellon and back, and the\nhill was steep, so that there was ample time for the crowd to gather\nand even to pass on ahead.\n\nMrs. Markam and the elder girls would have liked to make some protest\nor to do something to relieve their feelings of chagrin at the\nridicule which they saw on all faces, but there was a look of fixed\ndetermination on the face of the seeming Highlander which awed them a\nlittle, and they were silent. It might have been that the eagle's\nfeather, even when arising above the bald head, the cairngorm brooch\neven on the fat shoulder, and the claymore, dirk and pistols, even\nwhen belted round the extensive paunch and protruding from the\nstocking on the sturdy calf, fulfilled their existence as symbols of\nmartial and terrifying import! When the party arrived at the gate of\nthe Red House there awaited them a crowd of Crooken inhabitants,\nhatless and respectfully silent; the remainder of the population was\npainfully toiling up the hill. The silence was broken by only one\nsound, that of a man with a deep voice.\n\n'Man! but he's forgotten the pipes!'\n\nThe servants had arrived some days before, and all things were in\nreadiness. In the glow consequent on a good lunch after a hard journey\nall the disagreeables of travel and all the chagrin consequent on the\nadoption of the obnoxious costume were forgotten.\n\nThat afternoon Markam, still clad in full array, walked through the\nMains of Crooken. He was all alone, for, strange to say, his wife and\nboth daughters had sick headaches, and were, as he was told, lying\ndown to rest after the fatigue of the journey. His eldest son, who\nclaimed to be a young man, had gone out by himself to explore the\nsurroundings of the place, and one of the boys could not be found. The\nother boy, on being told that his father had sent for him to come for\na walk, had managed--by accident, of course--to fall into the water\nbutt, and had to be dried and rigged out afresh. His clothes not\nhaving been as yet unpacked this was of course impossible without\ndelay.\n\nMr. Markam was not quite satisfied with his walk. He could not meet\nany of his neighbours. It was not that there were not enough people\nabout, for every house and cottage seemed to be full; but the people\nwhen in the open were either in their doorways some distance behind\nhim, or on the roadway a long distance in front. As he passed he\ncould see the tops of heads and the whites of eyes in the windows or\nround the corners of doors. The only interview which he had was\nanything but a pleasant one. This was with an odd sort of old man who\nwas hardly ever heard to speak except to join in the 'Amens' in the\nmeeting-house. His sole occupation seemed to be to wait at the window\nof the post-office from eight o'clock in the morning till the arrival\nof the mail at one, when he carried the letter-bag to a neighbouring\nbaronial castle. The remainder of his day was spent on a seat in a\ndraughty part of the port, where the offal of the fish, the refuse of\nthe bait, and the house rubbish was thrown, and where the ducks were\naccustomed to hold high revel.\n\nWhen Saft Tammie beheld him coming he raised his eyes, which were\ngenerally fixed on the nothing which lay on the roadway opposite his\nseat, and, seeming dazzled as if by a burst of sunshine, rubbed them\nand shaded them with his hand. Then he started up and raised his hand\naloft in a denunciatory manner as he spoke:--\n\n'\"Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher. All is vanity.\" Mon, be\nwarned in time! \"Behold the lilies of the field, they toil not,\nneither do they spin, yet Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed\nlike one of these.\" Mon! Mon! Thy vanity is as the quicksand which\nswallows up all which comes within its spell. Beware vanity! Beware\nthe quicksand, which yawneth for thee, and which will swallow thee up!\nSee thyself! Learn thine own vanity! Meet thyself face to face, and\nthen in that moment thou shalt learn the fatal force of thy vanity.\nLearn it, know it, and repent ere the quicksand swallow thee!' Then\nwithout another word he went back to his seat and sat there immovable\nand expressionless as before.\n\nMarkam could not but feel a little upset by this tirade. Only that it\nwas spoken by a seeming madman, he would have put it down to some\neccentric exhibition of Scottish humour or impudence; but the gravity\nof the message--for it seemed nothing else--made such a reading\nimpossible. He was, however, determined not to give in to ridicule,\nand although he had not yet seen anything in Scotland to remind him\neven of a kilt, he determined to wear his Highland dress. When he\nreturned home, in less than half-an-hour, he found that every member\nof the family was, despite the headaches, out taking a walk. He took\nthe opportunity afforded by their absence of locking himself in his\ndressing-room, took off the Highland dress, and, putting on a suit of\nflannels, lit a cigar and had a snooze. He was awakened by the noise\nof the family coming in, and at once donning his dress made his\nappearance in the drawing-room for tea.\n\nHe did not go out again that afternoon; but after dinner he put on his\ndress again--he had, of course dressed for dinner as usual--and went\nby himself for a walk on the sea-shore. He had by this time come to\nthe conclusion that he would get by degrees accustomed to the Highland\ndress before making it his ordinary wear. The moon was up and he\neasily followed the path through the sand-hills, and shortly struck\nthe shore. The tide was out and the beach firm as a rock, so he\nstrolled southwards to nearly the end of the bay. Here he was\nattracted by two isolated rocks some little way out from the edge of\nthe dunes, so he strolled towards them. When he reached the nearest\none he climbed it, and, sitting there elevated some fifteen or twenty\nfeet over the waste of sand, enjoyed the lovely, peaceful prospect.\nThe moon was rising behind the headland of Pennyfold, and its light\nwas just touching the top of the furthermost rock of the Spurs some\nthree-quarters of a mile out; the rest of the rocks were in dark\nshadow. As the moon rose over the headland, the rocks of the Spurs and\nthen the beach by degrees became flooded with light.\n\nFor a good while Mr. Markam sat and looked at the rising moon and the\ngrowing area of light which followed its rise. Then he turned and\nfaced eastwards and sat with his chin in his hand looking seawards,\nand revelling in the peace and beauty and freedom of the scene. The\nroar of London--the darkness and the strife and weariness of London\nlife--seemed to have passed quite away, and he lived at the moment a\nfreer and higher life. He looked at the glistening water as it stole\nits way over the flat waste of sand, coming closer and closer\ninsensibly--the tide had turned. Presently he heard a distant shouting\nalong the beach very far off.\n\n'The fishermen calling to each other,' he said to himself and looked\naround. As he did so he got a horrible shock, for though just then a\ncloud sailed across the moon he saw, in spite of the sudden darkness\naround him, his own image. For an instant, on the top of the opposite\nrock he could see the bald back of the head and the Glengarry cap with\nthe immense eagle's feather. As he staggered back his foot slipped,\nand he began to slide down towards the sand between the two rocks. He\ntook no concern as to falling, for the sand was really only a few feet\nbelow him, and his mind was occupied with the figure or simulacrum of\nhimself, which had already disappeared. As the easiest way of reaching\n_terra firma_ he prepared to jump the remainder of the distance. All\nthis had taken but a second, but the brain works quickly, and even as\nhe gathered himself for the spring he saw the sand below him lying so\nmarbly level shake and shiver in an odd way. A sudden fear overcame\nhim; his knees failed, and instead of jumping he slid miserably down\nthe rock, scratching his bare legs as he went. His feet touched the\nsand--went through it like water--and he was down below his knees\nbefore he realised that he was in a quicksand. Wildly he grasped at\nthe rock to keep himself from sinking further, and fortunately there\nwas a jutting spur or edge which he was able to grasp instinctively.\nTo this he clung in grim desperation. He tried to shout, but his\nbreath would not come, till after a great effort his voice rang out.\nAgain he shouted, and it seemed as if the sound of his own voice gave\nhim new courage, for he was able to hold on to the rock for a longer\ntime than he thought possible--though he held on only in blind\ndesperation. He was, however, beginning to find his grasp weakening,\nwhen, joy of joys! his shout was answered by a rough voice from just\nabove him.\n\n'God be thankit, I'm nae too late!' and a fisherman with great\nthigh-boots came hurriedly climbing over the rock. In an instant he\nrecognised the gravity of the danger, and with a cheering 'Haud fast,\nmon! I'm comin'!' scrambled down till he found a firm foothold. Then\nwith one strong hand holding the rock above, he leaned down, and\ncatching Markam's wrist, called out to him, 'Haud to me, mon! Haud to\nme wi' ither hond!'\n\nThen he lent his great strength, and with a steady, sturdy pull,\ndragged him out of the hungry quicksand and placed him safe upon the\nrock. Hardly giving him time to draw breath, he pulled and pushed\nhim--never letting him go for an instant--over the rock into the firm\nsand beyond it, and finally deposited him, still shaking from the\nmagnitude of his danger, high upon the beach. Then he began to speak:\n\n'Mon! but I was just in time. If I had no laucht at yon foolish lads\nand begun to rin at the first you'd a bin sinkin' doon to the bowels\no' the airth be the noo! Wully Beagrie thocht you was a ghaist, and\nTom MacPhail swore ye was only like a goblin on a puddick-steel! \"Na!\"\nsaid I. \"Yon's but the daft Englishman--the loony that had escapit\nfrae the waxwarks.\" I was thinkin' that bein' strange and silly--if\nnot a whole-made feel--ye'd no ken the ways o' the quicksan'! I\nshouted till warn ye, and then ran to drag ye aff, if need be. But God\nbe thankit, be ye fule or only half-daft wi' yer vanity, that I was no\nthat late!' and he reverently lifted his cap as he spoke.\n\nMr. Markam was deeply touched and thankful for his escape from a\nhorrible death; but the sting of the charge of vanity thus made once\nmore against him came through his humility. He was about to reply\nangrily, when suddenly a great awe fell upon him as he remembered the\nwarning words of the half-crazy letter-carrier: 'Meet thyself face to\nface, and repent ere the quicksand shall swallow thee!'\n\nHere, too, he remembered the image of himself that he had seen and the\nsudden danger from the deadly quicksand that had followed. He was\nsilent a full minute, and then said:\n\n'My good fellow, I owe you my life!'\n\nThe answer came with reverence from the hardy fisherman, 'Na! Na! Ye\nowe that to God; but, as for me, I'm only too glad till be the humble\ninstrument o' His mercy.'\n\n'But you will let me thank you,' said Mr. Markam, taking both the\ngreat hands of his deliverer in his and holding them tight. 'My heart\nis too full as yet, and my nerves are too much shaken to let me say\nmuch; but, believe me, I am very, very grateful!' It was quite evident\nthat the poor old fellow was deeply touched, for the tears were\nrunning down his cheeks.\n\nThe fisherman said, with a rough but true courtesy:\n\n'Ay, sir! thank me and ye will--if it'll do yer poor heart good. An'\nI'm thinking that if it were me I'd be thankful too. But, sir, as for\nme I need no thanks. I am glad, so I am!'\n\nThat Arthur Fernlee Markam was really thankful and grateful was shown\npractically later on. Within a week's time there sailed into Port\nCrooken the finest fishing smack that had ever been seen in the\nharbour of Peterhead. She was fully found with sails and gear of all\nkinds, and with nets of the best. Her master and men went away by the\ncoach, after having left with the salmon-fisher's wife the papers\nwhich made her over to him.\n\nAs Mr. Markam and the salmon-fisher walked together along the shore\nthe former asked his companion not to mention the fact that he had\nbeen in such imminent danger, for that it would only distress his dear\nwife and children. He said that he would warn them all of the\nquicksand, and for that purpose he, then and there, asked questions\nabout it till he felt that his information on the subject was\ncomplete. Before they parted he asked his companion if he had happened\nto see a second figure, dressed like himself on the other rock as he\nhad approached to succour him.\n\n'Na! Na!' came the answer, 'there is nae sic another fule in these\nparts. Nor has there been since the time o' Jamie Fleeman--him that\nwas fule to the Laird o' Udny. Why, mon! sic a heathenish dress as ye\nhave on till ye has nae been seen in these pairts within the memory o'\nmon. An' I'm thinkin' that sic a dress never was for sittin' on the\ncauld rock, as ye done beyont. Mon! but do ye no fear the rheumatism\nor the lumbagy wi' floppin' doon on to the cauld stanes wi' yer bare\nflesh? I was thinking that it was daft ye waur when I see ye the\nmornin' doon be the port, but it's fule or eediot ye maun be for the\nlike o' thot!' Mr. Markam did not care to argue the point, and as they\nwere now close to his own home he asked the salmon-fisher to have a\nglass of whisky--which he did--and they parted for the night. He took\ngood care to warn all his family of the quicksand, telling them that\nhe had himself been in some danger from it.\n\nAll that night he never slept. He heard the hours strike one after the\nother; but try how he would he could not get to sleep. Over and over\nagain he went through the horrible episode of the quicksand, from the\ntime that Saft Tammie had broken his habitual silence to preach to him\nof the sin of vanity and to warn him. The question kept ever arising\nin his mind: 'Am I then so vain as to be in the ranks of the foolish?'\nand the answer ever came in the words of the crazy prophet: '\"Vanity\nof vanities! All is vanity.\" Meet thyself face to face, and repent ere\nthe quicksand shall swallow thee!' Somehow a feeling of doom began to\nshape itself in his mind that he would yet perish in that same\nquicksand, for there he had already met himself face to face.\n\nIn the grey of the morning he dozed off, but it was evident that he\ncontinued the subject in his dreams, for he was fully awakened by his\nwife, who said:\n\n'Do sleep quietly! That blessed Highland suit has got on your brain.\nDon't talk in your sleep, if you can help it!' He was somehow\nconscious of a glad feeling, as if some terrible weight had been\nlifted from him, but he did not know any cause of it. He asked his\nwife what he had said in his sleep, and she answered:\n\n'You said it often enough, goodness knows, for one to remember\nit--\"Not face to face! I saw the eagle plume over the bald head! There\nis hope yet! Not face to face!\" Go to sleep! Do!' And then he did go\nto sleep, for he seemed to realise that the prophecy of the crazy man\nhad not yet been fulfilled. He had not met himself face to face--as\nyet at all events.\n\nHe was awakened early by a maid who came to tell him that there was a\nfisherman at the door who wanted to see him. He dressed himself as\nquickly as he could--for he was not yet expert with the Highland\ndress--and hurried down, not wishing to keep the salmon-fisher\nwaiting. He was surprised and not altogether pleased to find that his\nvisitor was none other than Saft Tammie, who at once opened fire on\nhim:\n\n'I maun gang awa' t' the post; but I thocht that I would waste an hour\non ye, and ca' roond just to see if ye waur still that fou wi' vanity\nas on the nicht gane by. An I see that ye've no learned the lesson.\nWell! the time is comin', sure eneucht! However I have all the time i'\nthe marnins to my ain sel', so I'll aye look roond jist till see how\nye gang yer ain gait to the quicksan', and then to the de'il! I'm aff\ntill ma wark the noo!' And he went straightway, leaving Mr. Markam\nconsiderably vexed, for the maids within earshot were vainly trying to\nconceal their giggles. He had fairly made up his mind to wear on that\nday ordinary clothes, but the visit of Saft Tammie reversed his\ndecision. He would show them all that he was not a coward, and he\nwould go on as he had begun--come what might. When he came to\nbreakfast in full martial panoply the children, one and all, held down\ntheir heads and the backs of their necks became very red indeed. As,\nhowever, none of them laughed--except Titus, the youngest boy, who was\nseized with a fit of hysterical choking and was promptly banished from\nthe room--he could not reprove them, but began to break his egg with a\nsternly determined air. It was unfortunate that as his wife was\nhanding him a cup of tea one of the buttons of his sleeve caught in\nthe lace of her morning wrapper, with the result that the hot tea was\nspilt over his bare knees. Not unnaturally, he made use of a swear\nword, whereupon his wife, somewhat nettled, spoke out:\n\n'Well, Arthur, if you will make such an idiot of yourself with that\nridiculous costume what else can you expect? You are not accustomed to\nit--and you never will be!' In answer he began an indignant speech\nwith: 'Madam!' but he got no further, for now that the subject was\nbroached, Mrs. Markam intended to have her say out. It was not a\npleasant say, and, truth to tell, it was not said in a pleasant\nmanner. A wife's manner seldom is pleasant when she undertakes to tell\nwhat she considers 'truths' to her husband. The result was that Arthur\nFernlee Markam undertook, then and there, that during his stay in\nScotland he would wear no other costume than the one she abused.\nWoman-like his wife had the last word--given in this case with tears:\n\n'Very well, Arthur! Of course you will do as you choose. Make me as\nridiculous as you can, and spoil the poor girls' chances in life.\nYoung men don't seem to care, as a general rule, for an idiot\nfather-in-law! But I must warn you that your vanity will some day get\na rude shock--if indeed you are not before then in an asylum or dead!'\n\nIt was manifest after a few days that Mr. Markam would have to take\nthe major part of his outdoor exercise by himself. The girls now and\nagain took a walk with him, chiefly in the early morning or late at\nnight, or on a wet day when there would be no one about; they\nprofessed to be willing to go out at all times, but somehow something\nalways seemed to occur to prevent it. The boys could never be found at\nall on such occasions, and as to Mrs. Markam she sternly refused to go\nout with him on any consideration so long as he should continue to\nmake a fool of himself. On the Sunday he dressed himself in his\nhabitual broadcloth, for he rightly felt that church was not a place\nfor angry feelings; but on Monday morning he resumed his Highland\ngarb. By this time he would have given a good deal if he had never\nthought of the dress, but his British obstinacy was strong, and he\nwould not give in. Saft Tammie called at his house every morning, and,\nnot being able to see him nor to have any message taken to him, used\nto call back in the afternoon when the letter-bag had been delivered\nand watched for his going out. On such occasions he never failed to\nwarn him against his vanity in the same words which he had used at the\nfirst. Before many days were over Mr. Markam had come to look upon him\nas little short of a scourge.\n\nBy the time the week was out the enforced partial solitude, the\nconstant chagrin, and the never-ending brooding which was thus\nengendered, began to make Mr. Markam quite ill. He was too proud to\ntake any of his family into his confidence since they had in his view\ntreated him very badly. Then he did not sleep well at night, and when\nhe did sleep he had constantly bad dreams. Merely to assure himself\nthat his pluck was not failing him he made it a practice to visit the\nquicksand at least once every day; he hardly ever failed to go there\nthe last thing at night. It was perhaps this habit that wrought the\nquicksand with its terrible experience so perpetually into his dreams.\nMore and more vivid these became, till on waking at times he could\nhardly realise that he had not been actually in the flesh to visit the\nfatal spot. He sometimes thought that he might have been walking in\nhis sleep.\n\nOne night his dream was so vivid that when he awoke he could not\nbelieve that it had only been a dream. He shut his eyes again and\nagain, but each time the vision, if it was a vision, or the reality,\nif it was a reality, would rise before him. The moon was shining full\nand yellow over the quicksand as he approached it; he could see the\nexpanse of light shaken and disturbed and full of black shadows as the\nliquid sand quivered and trembled and wrinkled and eddied as was its\nwont between its pauses of marble calm. As he drew close to it another\nfigure came towards it from the opposite side with equal footsteps. He\nsaw that it was his own figure, his very self, and in silent terror,\ncompelled by what force he knew not, he advanced--charmed as the bird\nis by the snake, mesmerised or hypnotised--to meet this other self. As\nhe felt the yielding sand closing over him he awoke in the agony of\ndeath, trembling with fear, and, strange to say, with the silly man's\nprophecy seeming to sound in his ears: '\"Vanity of vanities! All is\nvanity!\" See thyself and repent ere the quicksand swallow thee!'\n\nSo convinced was he that this was no dream that he arose, early as it\nwas, and dressing himself without disturbing his wife took his way to\nthe shore. His heart fell when he came across a series of footsteps on\nthe sands, which he at once recognised as his own. There was the same\nwide heel, the same square toe; he had no doubt now that he had\nactually been there, and half horrified, and half in a state of dreamy\nstupor, he followed the footsteps, and found them lost in the edge of\nthe yielding quicksand. This gave him a terrible shock, for there were\nno return steps marked on the sand, and he felt that there was some\ndread mystery which he could not penetrate, and the penetration of\nwhich would, he feared, undo him.\n\nIn this state of affairs he took two wrong courses. Firstly he kept\nhis trouble to himself, and, as none of his family had any clue to it,\nevery innocent word or expression which they used supplied fuel to the\nconsuming fire of his imagination. Secondly he began to read books\nprofessing to bear upon the mysteries of dreaming and of mental\nphenomena generally, with the result that every wild imagination of\nevery crank or half-crazy philosopher became a living germ of unrest\nin the fertilising soil of his disordered brain. Thus negatively and\npositively all things began to work to a common end. Not the least of\nhis disturbing causes was Saft Tammie, who had now become at certain\ntimes of the day a fixture at his gate. After a while, being\ninterested in the previous state of this individual, he made inquiries\nregarding his past with the following result.\n\nSaft Tammie was popularly believed to be the son of a laird in one of\nthe counties round the Firth of Forth. He had been partially educated\nfor the ministry, but for some cause which no one ever knew threw up\nhis prospects suddenly, and, going to Peterhead in its days of whaling\nprosperity, had there taken service on a whaler. Here off and on he\nhad remained for some years, getting gradually more and more silent in\nhis habits, till finally his shipmates protested against so taciturn a\nmate, and he had found service amongst the fishing smacks of the\nnorthern fleet. He had worked for many years at the fishing with\nalways the reputation of being 'a wee bit daft,' till at length he had\ngradually settled down at Crooken, where the laird, doubtless knowing\nsomething of his family history, had given him a job which practically\nmade him a pensioner. The minister who gave the information finished\nthus:--\n\n'It is a very strange thing, but the man seems to have some odd kind\nof gift. Whether it be that \"second sight\" which we Scotch people are\nso prone to believe in, or some other occult form of knowledge, I know\nnot, but nothing of a disastrous tendency ever occurs in this place\nbut the men with whom he lives are able to quote after the event some\nsaying of his which certainly appears to have foretold it. He gets\nuneasy or excited--wakes up, in fact--when death is in the air!'\n\nThis did not in any way tend to lessen Mr. Markam's concern, but on\nthe contrary seemed to impress the prophecy more deeply on his mind.\nOf all the books which he had read on his new subject of study none\ninterested him so much as a German one _Die D\u00c3\u00b6ppleganger_, by Dr.\nHeinrich von Aschenberg, formerly of Bonn. Here he learned for the\nfirst time of cases where men had led a double existence--each nature\nbeing quite apart from the other--the body being always a reality with\none spirit, and a simulacrum with the other. Needless to say that Mr.\nMarkam realised this theory as exactly suiting his own case. The\nglimpse which he had of his own back the night of his escape from the\nquicksand--his own footmarks disappearing into the quicksand with no\nreturn steps visible--the prophecy of Saft Tammie about his meeting\nhimself and perishing in the quicksand--all lent aid to the conviction\nthat he was in his own person an instance of the d\u00c3\u00b6ppleganger. Being\nthen conscious of a double life he took steps to prove its existence\nto his own satisfaction. To this end on one night before going to bed\nhe wrote his name in chalk on the soles of his shoes. That night he\ndreamed of the quicksand, and of his visiting it--dreamed so vividly\nthat on walking in the grey of the dawn he could not believe that he\nhad not been there. Arising, without disturbing his wife, he sought\nhis shoes.\n\nThe chalk signatures were undisturbed! He dressed himself and stole\nout softly. This time the tide was in, so he crossed the dunes and\nstruck the shore on the further side of the quicksand. There, oh,\nhorror of horrors! he saw his own footprints dying into the abyss!\n\nHe went home a desperately sad man. It seemed incredible that he, an\nelderly commercial man, who had passed a long and uneventful life in\nthe pursuit of business in the midst of roaring, practical London,\nshould thus find himself enmeshed in mystery and horror, and that he\nshould discover that he had two existences. He could not speak of his\ntrouble even to his own wife, for well he knew that she would at once\nrequire the fullest particulars of that other life--the one which she\ndid not know; and that she would at the start not only imagine but\ncharge him with all manner of infidelities on the head of it. And so\nhis brooding grew deeper and deeper still. One evening--the tide then\ngoing out and the moon being at the full--he was sitting waiting for\ndinner when the maid announced that Saft Tammie was making a\ndisturbance outside because he would not be let in to see him. He was\nvery indignant, but did not like the maid to think that he had any\nfear on the subject, and so told her to bring him in. Tammie entered,\nwalking more briskly than ever with his head up and a look of vigorous\ndecision in the eyes that were so generally cast down. As soon as he\nentered he said:\n\n'I have come to see ye once again--once again; and there ye sit, still\njust like a cockatoo on a pairch. Weel, mon, I forgie ye! Mind ye\nthat, I forgie ye!' And without a word more he turned and walked out\nof the house, leaving the master in speechless indignation.\n\nAfter dinner he determined to pay another visit to the quicksand--he\nwould not allow even to himself that he was afraid to go. And so,\nabout nine o'clock, in full array, he marched to the beach, and\npassing over the sands sat on the skirt of the nearer rock. The full\nmoon was behind him and its light lit up the bay so that its fringe of\nfoam, the dark outline of the headland, and the stakes of the\nsalmon-nets were all emphasised. In the brilliant yellow glow the\nlights in the windows of Port Crooken and in those of the distant\ncastle of the laird trembled like stars through the sky. For a long\ntime he sat and drank in the beauty of the scene, and his soul seemed\nto feel a peace that it had not known for many days. All the pettiness\nand annoyance and silly fears of the past weeks seemed blotted out,\nand a new holy calm took the vacant place. In this sweet and solemn\nmood he reviewed his late action calmly, and felt ashamed of himself\nfor his vanity and for the obstinacy which had followed it. And then\nand there he made up his mind that the present would be the last time\nhe would wear the costume which had estranged him from those whom he\nloved, and which had caused him so many hours and days of chagrin,\nvexation, and pain.\n\nBut almost as soon as he arrived at this conclusion another voice\nseemed to speak within him and mockingly to ask him if he should ever\nget the chance to wear the suit again--that it was too late--he had\nchosen his course and must now abide the issue.\n\n'It is not too late,' came the quick answer of his better self; and\nfull of the thought, he rose up to go home and divest himself of the\nnow hateful costume right away. He paused for one look at the\nbeautiful scene. The light lay pale and mellow, softening every\noutline of rock and tree and house-top, and deepening the shadows into\nvelvety-black, and lighting, as with a pale flame, the incoming tide,\nthat now crept fringe-like across the flat waste of sand. Then he left\nthe rock and stepped out for the shore.\n\nBut as he did so a frightful spasm of horror shook him, and for an\ninstant the blood rushing to his head shut out all the light of the\nfull moon. Once more he saw that fatal image of himself moving beyond\nthe quicksand from the opposite rock to the shore. The shock was all\nthe greater for the contrast with the spell of peace which he had just\nenjoyed; and, almost paralysed in every sense, he stood and watched\nthe fatal vision and the wrinkly, crawling quicksand that seemed to\nwrithe and yearn for something that lay between. There could be no\nmistake this time, for though the moon behind threw the face into\nshadow he could see there the same shaven cheeks as his own, and the\nsmall stubby moustache of a few weeks' growth. The light shone on the\nbrilliant tartan, and on the eagle's plume. Even the bald space at one\nside of the Glengarry cap glistened, as did the cairngorm brooch on\nthe shoulder and the tops of the silver buttons. As he looked he felt\nhis feet slightly sinking, for he was still near the edge of the belt\nof quicksand, and he stepped back. As he did so the other figure\nstepped forward, so that the space between them was preserved.\n\nSo the two stood facing each other, as though in some weird\nfascination; and in the rushing of the blood through his brain Markam\nseemed to hear the words of the prophecy: 'See thyself face to face,\nand repent ere the quicksand swallow thee.' He did stand face to face\nwith himself, he had repented--and now he was sinking in the\nquicksand! The warning and prophecy were coming true.\n\nAbove him the seagulls screamed, circling round the fringe of the\nincoming tide, and the sound being entirely mortal recalled him to\nhimself. On the instant he stepped back a few quick steps, for as yet\nonly his feet were merged in the soft sand. As he did so the other\nfigure stepped forward, and coming within the deadly grip of the\nquicksand began to sink. It seemed to Markam that he was looking at\nhimself going down to his doom, and on the instant the anguish of his\nsoul found vent in a terrible cry. There was at the same instant a\nterrible cry from the other figure, and as Markam threw up his hands\nthe figure did the same. With horror-struck eyes he saw him sink\ndeeper into the quicksand; and then, impelled by what power he knew\nnot, he advanced again towards the sand to meet his fate. But as his\nmore forward foot began to sink he heard again the cries of the\nseagulls which seemed to restore his benumbed faculties. With a mighty\neffort he drew his foot out of the sand which seemed to clutch it,\nleaving his shoe behind, and then in sheer terror he turned and ran\nfrom the place, never stopping till his breath and strength failed\nhim, and he sank half swooning on the grassy path through the\nsandhills.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nArthur Markam made up his mind not to tell his family of his terrible\nadventure--until at least such time as he should be complete master of\nhimself. Now that the fatal double--his other self--had been engulfed\nin the quicksand he felt something like his old peace of mind.\n\nThat night he slept soundly and did not dream at all; and in the\nmorning was quite his old self. It really seemed as though his newer\nand worser self had disappeared for ever; and strangely enough Saft\nTammie was absent from his post that morning and never appeared there\nagain, but sat in his old place watching nothing, as of old, with\nlack-lustre eye. In accordance with his resolution he did not wear his\nHighland suit again, but one evening tied it up in a bundle, claymore,\ndirk and philibeg and all, and bringing it secretly with him threw it\ninto the quicksand. With a feeling of intense pleasure he saw it\nsucked below the sand, which closed above it into marble smoothness.\nThen he went home and announced cheerily to his family assembled for\nevening prayers:\n\n'Well! my dears, you will be glad to hear that I have abandoned my\nidea of wearing the Highland dress. I see now what a vain old fool I\nwas and how ridiculous I made myself! You shall never see it again!'\n\n'Where is it, father?' asked one of the girls, wishing to say\nsomething so that such a self-sacrificing announcement as her father's\nshould not be passed in absolute silence. His answer was so sweetly\ngiven that the girl rose from her seat and came and kissed him. It\nwas:\n\n'In the quicksand, my dear! and I hope that my worser self is buried\nthere along with it--for ever.'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe remainder of the summer was passed at Crooken with delight by all\nthe family, and on his return to town Mr. Markam had almost forgotten\nthe whole of the incident of the quicksand, and all touching on it,\nwhen one day he got a letter from the MacCallum More which caused him\nmuch thought, though he said nothing of it to his family, and left it,\nfor certain reasons, unanswered. It ran as follows:--\n\n      'The MacCallum More and Roderick MacDhu.\n        'The Scotch All-Wool Tartan Clothing Mart.\n          Copthall Court, E.C.,\n            30th September, 1892.\n\n'Dear Sir,--I trust you will pardon the liberty which I take in\nwriting to you, but I am desirous of making an inquiry, and I am\ninformed that you have been sojourning during the summer in\nAberdeenshire (Scotland, N.B.). My partner, Mr. Roderick MacDhu--as he\nappears for business reasons on our bill-heads and in our\nadvertisements, his real name being Emmanuel Moses Marks of\nLondon--went early last month to Scotland (N.B.) for a tour, but as I\nhave only once heard from him, shortly after his departure, I am\nanxious lest any misfortune may have befallen him. As I have been\nunable to obtain any news of him on making all inquiries in my power,\nI venture to appeal to you. His letter was written in deep dejection\nof spirit, and mentioned that he feared a judgment had come upon him\nfor wishing to appear as a Scotchman on Scottish soil, as he had one\nmoonlight night shortly after his arrival seen his 'wraith'. He\nevidently alluded to the fact that before his departure he had\nprocured for himself a Highland costume similar to that which we had\nthe honour to supply to you, with which, as perhaps you will remember,\nhe was much struck. He may, however, never have worn it, as he was, to\nmy own knowledge, diffident about putting it on, and even went so far\nas to tell me that he would at first only venture to wear it late at\nnight or very early in the morning, and then only in remote places,\nuntil such time as he should get accustomed to it. Unfortunately he\ndid not advise me of his route so that I am in complete ignorance of\nhis whereabouts; and I venture to ask if you may have seen or heard of\na Highland costume similar to your own having been seen anywhere in\nthe neighbourhood in which I am told you have recently purchased the\nestate which you temporarily occupied. I shall not expect an answer to\nthis letter unless you can give me some information regarding my\nfriend and partner, so pray do not trouble to reply unless there be\ncause. I am encouraged to think that he may have been in your\nneighbourhood as, though his letter is not dated, the envelope is\nmarked with the postmark of \"Yellon\" which I find is in Aberdeenshire,\nand not far from the Mains of Crooken.\n\n  'I have the honour to be, dear sir,\n      'Yours very respectfully,\n          'JOSHUA SHEENY COHEN BENJAMIN\n            '(The MacCallum More.)'\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DRACULA'S GUEST***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 10150-8.txt or 10150-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/1\/0\/1\/5\/10150\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":873,"split":"train"}
