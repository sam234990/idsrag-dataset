Abandoned at birth on a barge in England, the child is raised by the knight Gandales in Scotland and investigates his origins through fantastic adventures.\nHe is persecuted by the wizard Arcala\u00fas, but protected by Urganda la Desconocida (Urganda the Unknown or Unrecognized), an ambiguous priestess with magical powers and a talent for prophecy. Knighted by his father King Peri\u00f3n, Amad\u00eds overcomes the challenges of the enchanted Insola Firme (a sort of peninsula), including passing through the Arch of Faithful Lovers.\nDespite Amad\u00eds' celebrated fidelity, his childhood sweetheart, Oriana, heiress to the throne of Great Britain, becomes jealous of a rival princess and sends a letter to chastise Amad\u00eds. The knight (later famously parodied in Don Quixote) changes his name to Beltenebros and indulges in a long period of madness on the isolated Pe\u00f1a Pobre.\nHe recovers his senses only when Oriana sends her maid to retrieve him. He then helps Oriana's father, Lisuarte, repel invaders. A short time later he and Oriana scandalously consummate their love. Their son Esplandi\u00e1n is the result of this one illicit meeting.\nRodr\u00edguez de Montalvo asserts that in the \"original\" Amad\u00eds, Esplandi\u00e1n eventually kills his father for this offense against his mother's honor; however, Montalvo amends this defect and resolves their conflict peaceably.\nOriana and Amad\u00eds defer their marriage for many years due to enmity between Amad\u00eds and Oriana's father Lisuarte. Amad\u00eds absents himself from Britain for at least ten years, masquerading as \"The Knight of the Green Sword\". He travels as far as Constantinople and secures the favor of the child-princess Leonorina, who will become Esplandi\u00e1n's wife. His most famous adventure during this time of exile is the battle with the giant Endriago, a monster born of incest who exhales a poisonous reek and whose body is covered in scales.\nAs a knight, Amad\u00eds is courteous, gentle, sensitive and a Christian who dares to defend free love. Unlike most literary heroes of his time (French and German, for example), Amad\u00eds is a handsome man who would cry if refused by his lady, but is invincible in battle and usually emerges drenched in his own and his opponent's blood.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's Amad\u00c3\u00ads of Gaul, Vol. II. of IV., by Vasco Lobeira\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Presently the Dwarf came up and related all\nhis tidings, and how Oriana was carried away. Holy Mary, help me! cried\nAmadis: which way did they take her?\u00e2\u0080\u0094By the city is the nearest road.\nAmadis immediately spurred his horse, and gallopped amain towards\nLondon, so confounded with the terror of this news that he never spoke\nword to Galaor, who followed him full speed. They passed close by the\ntown without stopping a minute, only Amadis enquired of all he saw\nwhich way the Princess had been taken; but as Gandalin passed under the\nwindows where the Queen and her Ladies were, the Queen called him,\nand threw the King's sword to him, which was the best sword that ever\nKnight girded on; take it to your Master, quoth she, and God speed him\nwith it! and tell Galaor that the King went from hence with a Damsel\nthis morning, and is not yet returned, and we know not where she has\nled him. Gandalin took the sword and rode as fast as he could after\nAmadis, who coming to a brook missed the bridge in his hurry, and\nforcing the horse to leap the tired animal fell short into the mud;\nthen Gandalin came up to him and gave him the sword, and the horse\nwhich he himself rode. Presently they turned aside from the road to\nfollow the track of horsemen, and there they saw some woodmen, who\nasked them if they came from London, for if a Knight and a Damsel be\nmissing there, said they, we have seen an adventure; and then they\ntold them what they had beheld. Who is it that has taken them? quoth\nAmadis; for he knew it was Lisuarte by the description. They answered,\nthe Damsel who led the Knight here called loudly for Arcalaus. Lord\nGod! quoth Amadis: let me but find that traitor!\u00e2\u0080\u0094The woodmen then told\nthem how the party had separated, and said that one of the five Knights\nwho went with the Damsel was the biggest Knight they had ever seen.\nAmadis knew that that was Arcalaus; and bidding Galaor follow where\nthe King went, he spurred on after Oriana. By sunset the horse could\ncarry him no farther, and he being greatly distressed, saw a little to\nthe right of the road a Knight lying dead, and a Squire by him holding\nhis horse. Who slew that Knight? cried Amadis. A traitor that passed\nby, carrying the fairest Damsel in the world by force, and he slew my\nmaster only for asking who they were, and here is no one to help me\nto remove the body.\u00e2\u0080\u0094My Squire shall help you: give me your master's\nhorse: I promise to give you two better in return. He told Gandalin to\nfollow him after the body was disposed of, and gallopped on. Towards\nday-break he came to a hermitage in a valley, and asked the Hermit\nif he had seen five Knights pass carrying with them two Damsels? Do\nyou see yonder castle? he replied: my nephew tells me that Arcalaus\nthe Enchanter is lodged there, and with him two fair Damsels whom he\nhath taken by violence. By God the very villain whom I seek!\u00e2\u0080\u0094He hath\ndone much evil in this land, replied the Hermit. God remove him, or\nmend him!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Then Amadis asked him if he had any barley for his horse;\nand, while the horse was feeding, enquired who was the Lord of the\ncastle. Grumen, said the good man, cousin to Dardan who was slain in\nLisuarte's court, and therefore the King's enemies put up there. Now\nGod be with you, father! quoth Amadis; I beseech you remember me in\nyour prayers! which way to the castle?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Amadis followed the path which\nthe good man had pointed out, and came up to it, and saw that the wall\nwas high and the towers strong. He listened and could hear no sound\nwithin, and that pleased him, for he knew that Arcalaus was not gone\nforth; and he rode round, and saw that it had only one issue. Then he\nretired among some crags, and, dismounting, stood holding the bridle,\nand with his eyes fixed upon the gate, like one who had no will to\nsleep. By this the morning broke, and he removed farther across a\nvalley to a hill that was well wooded, for he feared that if those of\nthe castle saw him they would suspect there were others at hand, and\ntherefore not come out. Presently the gate opened, and a Knight came\nout, and went to a high eminence and looked all round; then returned\ninto the castle. It was not long before he saw Arcalaus and his four\ncompanions come out, all well armed, and among them Oriana. Ah, God!\nquoth he, now and for ever help me in her defence! They drew near him,\nand he heard Oriana say, Dear friend, I shall never see thee more, for\nI go to my death. The tears came into his eyes; he descended the hill\nas fast as he could, and came after them into a great plain, and then\ncried, Arcalaus! traitor! it becomes not one like thee to carry away\nso excellent a Lady! Oriana knew the voice, and shook all over; but\nArcalaus and the others ran at him. He took his aim at Arcalaus, and\nbore him right over the crupper; then turned his horse and smote at\nGrumen, so that the point and part of the stave of the spear came out\nat his back, and he fell down dead, and the spear broke in him. Then\nhe drew the King's sword, and laid about with such rage and violence,\nand felt such strength in himself, that he thought if the whole plain\nwere full of Knights they could not stand before him. We are succoured!\nquoth the Damsel of Denmark: it is the fortunate Knight! look at the\nwonders he performeth! Ah God protect thee, dear friend! cried Oriana:\nnone other in the world can save us. The Squire who had her in his\nkeeping seeing what had passed, cried out, Certes I shall not wait\ntill those blows come upon my head which shields and helmets cannot\nresist! and he put the princess down, and rode off full speed. By this\nAmadis had cut thro' the arm of another, and sent him away howling\nwith the agony of death; and he cleft a third down to the neck. The\nfourth began to fly, and Amadis was after him, when he heard his Lady\ncry; and looking round, saw that Arcalaus had mounted again, and was\ndragging her up by the arm. Amadis soon came up to them, and lifting up\nhis sword dared not put forth his strength lest he should slay both,\nbut with a half-blow he smote him on the shoulder, and cut away part\nof the cuirass and the skin; then Arcalaus let Oriana fall, that he\nmight escape the better. Turn, Arcalaus, cried Amadis, and see if I be\ndead as thou hast reported! but he in fear of death spurred on, and\nthrew his shield from off his neck for speed. The blow made at him just\nreached his loins with the sword-end, and fell upon the horse's flank\nand wounded it, so that the beast rode away more furiously. Amadis,\nalbeit he so hated the Enchanter, did not pursue him further, lest he\nshould lose his mistress, he turned towards her, and alighted and knelt\nbefore her, and kissed her hand, saying, now let God do with me what he\nwill! I never thought to see you again. She being among the dead was\nin great terror, and could not speak, but she embraced him. The Damsel\nof Denmark going to hold his horse saw the sword of Arcalaus on the\nground, and admiring its beauty gave it to Amadis; but he seeing it\nwas right glad thereof, for it was King Perion's sword which had been\nplaced in his cradle, and which Arcalaus had taken when he enchanted\nhim. Presently Gandalin came up, who had travelled all night long: a\njoyful man was he seeing how the quest had ended.\n\nAmadis then placed Oriana upon the Damsels palfrey, while Gandalin\ncaught one of the loose horses for the Damsel, and taking her bridle\nthey left the place of battle. But Amadis as they went along reminded\nOriana how she had promised to be his; hitherto, said he, I have known\nthat it was not in your power to show me more favour than you did; but\nnow that you are at full liberty, how should I support disappointments\nwithout the worst despair that ever destroyed man! Dear friend, quoth\nshe, never for my sake shall you suffer, for I am at your will: though\nit be an error and a sin now, let it not be so before God.\u00e2\u0080\u0094When they\nhad proceeded about three leagues they entered a thick wood, and about\na league farther there was a town. Oriana, who had not slept a wink\nsince she left her father's house, complained of fatigue: let us rest\nin that valley, said Amadis. There was a brook there and soft herbage;\nthere Amadis took her from her palfrey: the noon, said he, is coming on\nvery hot, let us sleep here till it be cooler, and meantime Gandalin\nshall go bring us food from the town. He may go, replied Oriana, but\nwho will give him food?\u00e2\u0080\u0094They will give it him for his horse, which\nhe may leave in pledge, and return on foot. No: said Oriana, let him\ntake my ring, which was never before so useful: and she gave it to\nGandalin, who, as he went by Amadis, said to him, he who loses a good\nopportunity, Sir, must wait long before he find another. Oriana laid\nherself down upon the Damsel's cloak, while Amadis disarmed, of which\nhe had great need, and the Damsel retired farther among the trees to\nsleep. Then was his Lady in his power, nothing loth; and the fairest\nDamsel in the world became a Woman. Yet was their love encreased\nthereby, as pure and true love alway is.\n\nWhen Galaor returned, the Damsel prepared the food; and, though they\nhad neither many serving-men, nor vessels of gold and silver, yet was\nthat a sweet meal upon the green grass in the forest.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER 37._\n\n\nGalaor rode on after the King so fast as his horse could carry him;\nstill following the track of the horsemen. About vespers he met a\nKnight who cried out to him, whither so fast? stop and tell me! I have\nno time, quoth he.\u00e2\u0080\u0094By St. Mary, you pass not so! tell me, or fight me!\nBut Galaor still rode on.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Certes, Knight, cried the stranger, you have\ncommitted some villainy that you fly so fast: defend yourself! Galaor\nturned as if to meet him in his career, but dexterously moved aside,\nso that the Knight's horse in his speed carried him a good way on. Ah,\ncoward! cried the Knight, when at last he turned, thou shalt answer me\nor die! and he ran at him again full tilt. Again Galaor avoided the\nencounter, and rode on as fast as he could. When the Knight saw him\nfar before, he said, as God shall help me, he shall not escape so!\nand knowing the country well, he struck across by a nearer way, and\ntook possession of a pass. Faint-hearted coward! quoth he, chuse now\nof three things: fight, or turn back, or answer me! I like neither,\nreplied Galaor, and you are discourteous: if you want to know why I go\nso fast, follow me and see; I should lose time in telling you, and you\nwould not believe me, it is for so great an evil. The Knight answered,\nIn God's name then go on, and I will follow thee though for these three\ndays.\n\nIn about half a league's time they saw one Knight running after his\nhorse, and another gallopping away from him. He who was with Galaor\nknew him on foot, for he was his cousin, and he caught the horse\nfor him, and asked him, how is this? He replied, I was riding along\nthinking upon you know what, when that Knight yonder gave me such a\nthrust on my shield that the horse fell upon his knees and threw me. I\ndrew my sword, and called to him to do battle; but he only cried out,\nremember to answer another time when you are spoken to! and so he rode\naway. By my faith in God, let us follow him, and see you how I will\navenge myself. I cannot, said his cousin, now, for I must keep this\nKnight company for three days; and then he related what had befallen\nhim with Galaor. Quoth the other, certes either he is the greatest\ncoward in the world, or he goes upon some great adventure: I will\nforego my own vengeance to see the end of this. By this Galaor was far\nbefore them, for he did not tarry a whit, and they rode after him. It\nwas now drawing towards night. Galaor entered a forest, and soon lost\nthe track, for it was dark, so that he knew not which way to take. Then\nhe began to pray to God to guide him that he might be the first to\nsuccour the King; and thinking that those horsemen might have led the\nKing apart from the road to rest themselves, he went along the bottoms\nlistening every where if he might hear them. The Knights thinking he\nhad kept the road, rode straight forward about a league till they came\nthrough the forest, and not seeing him there they imagined he had\nhidden himself, and they turned aside to lodge in the house of a Dame\nhard by.\n\nWhen Galaor had searched the forest throughout, and found nothing, he\nresolved to proceed, and ascend some eminence the next day to look\nabout. So recovering the road, he went on till he came into the open\ncountry, and there he saw before him in a valley a little fire. Thither\nhe went; it was some forgemen, and they seeing him come among them in\narms, took up lances and hatchets to defend themselves; but he bidding\nthem not fear, besought them to give him some barley for his horse.\nThe which they did, and he gave the beast his supper. They would have\ngiven him also to eat, but he would not; only he lay down to sleep,\nrequesting them to wake him before day-break. The night was two parts\ngone, and Galaor lay down by the fire, completely armed. At dawn he\nrose, for he had not slept much for pure vexation, and, commending them\nto God, he took his leave. His Squire had not been able to keep pace\nwith him, and thenceforth he vowed if God prospered him, to give his\nSquire the better horse. So he rode to a high hill, and from thence\nbegan to look all round him.\n\nThe two cousins had now left the Lady's house, and it being now day\nthey saw Galaor on the eminence, and knowing him by his shield rode\ntowards him. As they drew nigh they saw him descend the hill as fast\nas horse could carry him. Certes, quoth the one, he is flying and\nconcealing himself for some mischief: if I come up with him, God never\nhelp me if I do not learn from him what he hath deserved. But Galaor,\nthinking nothing of them, had just seen ten Knights passing a strait\nat the entrance of the forest, of whom five rode first and five behind,\nand some unarmed men went in the middle. These he thought to be the\nvillains with the King, and went towards them like a man who has\ndevoted his own life to save another. Coming near, he saw Lisuarte with\nthe chain about his neck; and then, with grief and rage that defied\ndanger, he ran at the first five, exclaiming, Ah, traitors! to your own\nmisfortune have you laid hands upon the best man in the world! The five\nat once ran at him; he smote the first so sternly, that the wood of his\nlance appeared through his back, and he fell dead; the others smote\nhim with such force that his horse fell upon his knees, and one of\nthem drove his spear between Galaor's shield and breast-plate. Galaor\nforced it from him, and striking at another with it, nailed his leg\nto the horse, and left the broken lance in them; then putting hand to\nsword, the others all came at him, and he defended himself so bravely\nthat every one wondered how he could bear up against such blows. But\nbeing in this great press of danger, it pleased God to succour him\nwith the two cousins who were in his pursuit, who seeing his great\nchivalry, exclaimed, Of a truth we wrongly called him coward: let us\ngo help the best Knight in the world! With that they ran full tilt to\nhis assistance, like men who knew their business, for they had each\nbeen Errant Knights for ten years, and the one was called Ladasin, the\nsword-player, and the other Don Guilan the pensive, the good Knight.\nAt this time Galaor had great need of their aid, for his helmet was\nhacked and battered, his harness open in many places, and his horse\ntottering with loss of blood; yet he felt assured that, if his horse\ndid not fail him, he should bring it to a good end. But when the two\ncousins came to his help, then he bestirred himself more hopefully, for\nhe marvelled at their prowess. The load of blows was lightened, and he\nhad room for action. When the Cousin of Arcalaus saw how things were\ngoing, for his Knights were falling on all sides, he ran to Lisuarte to\nslay him. Those who were with the King had fled, and he got from off\nthe palfrey with the chain about his neck, and caught up a shield and\nsword from the ground, and received upon the shield the blow that was\nmeant for his death. The sword passed a palm's length through the rim\nof the shield, and with its point reaching the head made a slant wound\nto the skull; but the King smote at his enemy's horse in the face, so\nthat the traitor could not repeat the blow, and the horse reared and\nfell back upon the rider. Galaor now on foot, for his horse could not\nmove, ran to him to smite off his head; but the King called out not to\nslay him. By this the two cousins had made an end of their last enemy,\nand then turning round they knew the King, to their great wonder,\nfor they knew nothing of what had happened; and they took off their\nhelmets, and knelt before him. He raised them up, saying, By my God,\nfriends, you have succoured me in time! great wrong, Don Guilan, hath\nyour mistress done me in withdrawing you from my company, and for your\nsake I lose Ladasin also. Guilan was ashamed at these words, and his\ncheeks crimsoned, for he loved the Dutchess of Bristol and she loved\nhim, and the Duke always suspected it was he who had entered his castle\nwhen Galaor was there.\n\nGalaor had now taken the chain from Lisuarte, and fastened it round\nthe cousin of Arcalaus; they took the horses of the dead, one for the\nKing, and one for Galaor, and rode towards London. They halted at\nthe dwelling of Ladasin, and there found Galaor's Squire and Ardian\nthe Dwarf, who thought his master had taken that way. A Squire was\nsent forthwith to inform the Queen of Lisuarte's safety. They rested\nthat night; and, as they set forth on the morning, their prisoners\nconfessed how all that had passed had been concerted with Barsinan,\nthat he might make himself King of Great Britain; which, when Lisuarte\nheard, he spurred on in greater haste.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER 38._\n\n\nThe woodmen had carried the news of Lisuarte's imprisonment to London;\nimmediately there was a great stir in the city: the Knights all ran\nto horse, and gallopped to his rescue, so that the whole plain seemed\nfull of them. King Arban of North Wales was talking with the Queen,\nwhen his Squires brought him horse and arms, and a Page said to him,\narm yourself, Sir! what are you doing? there is not a Knight of all\nthe King's company, except yourself, who is not gone full speed to the\nforest. And why? quoth Arban.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Because they say ten Knights are carrying\naway the King prisoner. Holy Mary! exclaimed the Queen; I always feared\nthis! and she fell down in a swoon. Arban left her to the care of her\nLadies, all making loud lamentation, and armed himself. As he was\nmounting, he heard a great cry that the Tower was taken. Holy Mary!\nquoth he, we are all betrayed! and then he knew he must not leave the\nQueen. By this time there was such an uproar in the town, as if all the\npeople of the world were there. Arban drew up his two hundred Knights\nbefore the Queen's palace, and sent two of them to discover the cause\nof the tumult. They went to the Tower, and saw that Barsinan had got\npossession of it, and was killing some and throwing others from the\nwalls, for he had six hundred Knights with him, besides footmen, and\nthe King's Knights suspecting nothing had all gone to their master's\nrescue. The townsmen hearing this, ran all armed as they could in haste\nto the Queen's palace, and there also Barsinan went that he might take\nher, and get possession of the crown and throne. When he arrived he\nfound Arban ready for defence. Arban, quoth he, you have hitherto been\nthe wisest Knight of a young man that has been known: see now that you\nlose not your wisdom. Why do you say this? cried Arban.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Because before\nfive days end Lisuarte's head will be sent me, and there is no other\nin this land who can and ought to be King except myself, and King I\nwill be! I give you the kingdom of North Wales which you now hold,\nbecause you are a good Knight and wise: so retire now, and let me take\nthe crown and throne, for whosoever opposes me shall lose his head.\nVillain and Traitor! quoth Arban; and then began a sharp conflict,\nwherein many were slain, which lasted till night, for the streets being\nnarrow Barsinan could not avail himself of his numbers, and King Arban\nso behaved himself that he that day saved the Queen.\n\nAt night both parties retired: the Queen then sent for Arban; he went\nto her armed as he was, and wounded in many places, and, when he came\nbefore her, took off his battered helmet. There were five wounds in\nhis face and neck, and his countenance was all bloody; but it seemed a\nbeautiful face to those who, under God, thought him their protector.\nBut the Queen seeing him, wept aloud with great pity: Ah, good nephew,\nGod defend thee! what will become of the King? and what will become of\nus? Of him, quoth Arban, we shall have good news; for ourselves, fear\nnothing from these traitors: your vassals who are with me can defend\nthemselves in their great loyalty.\u00e2\u0080\u0094But, Nephew, you are not in a state\nto bear arms, and what can the others do without you?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Fear not, Lady,\nso long as life is in me I shall not forsake my arms.\n\nBarsinan, who found his people had need of rest, took twenty Knights\nwith him in the morning, and went to a post which Arban's High Steward\nkept. They at the barrier took their arms to defend themselves, but\nBarsinan cried out that he came to speak with them, and make a truce\ntill noon; to which Arban, being advised thereof, assented willingly,\nfor the most part of his company had been so hardly handled that they\ncould not bear arms. Barsinan then went to Arban, and said he would\nmake a truce for five days. Agreed, said Arban, but provided that\nyou shall not attempt to take any thing in the town; and that if the\nKing comes, we immediately act as he may order us. I grant all this,\nsaid Barsinan, that there may be no more battling, for I value my own\nKnights, and I value you who will be mine sooner than you think. I will\ntell you how: the King is dead, and I have his daughter and will make\nher my wife. God forsake me then, quoth Arban, if ever thou shalt have\ntruce with me, since thou art a partaker in the treason against my\nliege Lord! go and do thy worst! And before night Barsinan made three\nattacks upon him, and was repulsed.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER 39._\n\n\nMeantime Amadis asked Oriana what Arcalaus had said to her. He told\nme not to grieve, said she, for within fifteen days he would make me\nQueen of London, and give me Barsinan for my husband, to whom he was to\ngive me and my father's head, and be made his High Steward in return.\nHoly Mary! quoth Amadis: Barsinan, who seemed such a friend! I fear\nlest he do injury to the Queen. Dear friend, cried Oriana, hasten on!\nI must to my sorrow, replied Amadis, for else I should have delighted\nto pass four days here in the forest with you, if it had pleased you.\nOriana answered, God knows how willingly! but great evil might happen\nthereby to this land, which if God pleases will one day be yours and\nmine. As soon as it was morning Amadis armed himself, and leading his\nLady's bridle, rode on as fast as they could towards London; and every\nwhere they met the Knights, five by five, and ten by ten, as they\nwere seeking the King; more than a thousand they met, and told them\nwhich way the King was gone, and how Galaor was in quest of him. When\nthey came within five leagues of London they met Grumedan, the good\nold Knight who had fostered the Queen; twenty of his lineage were with\nhim, and they had been all night long scouring the forest. He seeing\nOriana went towards her weeping: Oh God, Lady, what a good day with\nyour coming! but what tidings of the King? They told him what they\nknew, and Amadis said to him, Take you charge of Oriana, and bid all\nthe Knights that you shall meet turn back, for if numbers can succour\nhim, there are already more than enough gone: I must go with all speed\nto protect the Queen. With that he gallopped away: at the entrance of\nthe city he found the Squire whom Lisuarte had sent with the news of\nhis deliverance, and learnt also the state of the city. So entering\nas privately as he could he went to Arban, who embraced him right\njoyfully, and asked, what news? As good as heart could wish! quoth\nAmadis: let us go to the Queen. He took with him Ladasin's messenger,\nand kneeling before Brisena, said, Lady, this Squire has left Lisuarte\nsafe and well, and I have left Oriana with your fosterer Grumedan;\nthey will soon be here, but I must go look after Barsinan. He then\nchanged his shield and helmet that he might not be known, and bade\nArban throw down the barriers, that the traitors might come freely\non, for by God's help they shall pay dearly for their treason! The\nbarriers were thrown down, and Barsinan prest on at the head of his\npeople, thinking that all would now be his, for his own men were many\nand his enemies few, and he was eager to seize the Queen. The King's\nparty gave back being overpowered, then Amadis went forth; he had on\na rusty helmet, and a plain shield hanging from his neck; but he was\nsoon judged to be a good one, and he went on making his way through the\npress; and having the good sword of Lisuarte by his side. He forced his\nway to Barsinan and encountered him; drove his lance through shield\nand corselet, and left the broken spear in him half way of its iron;\nthen drew he his sword, and smote off the crest and top of his helmet,\nand the scalp of his head, for the sword cut so finely that Amadis\ncould scarce feel the blow he gave; with another stroke he sheared\nthro' gauntlet and hand, and the sword passing through the bone of the\nwrist, fell on the leg and entered in half through. Then Barsinan fell,\nand Amadis turned upon the throng, and King Arban so prest them that\nthey who could escape slaughter ran to the Tower, and made fast the\ngates. Amadis finding he could not force entrance readily, went back\nto Barsinan, and finding him still alive, ordered that he should be\ncarried to the palace and kept till the King's return. Then the strife\nbeing over, he looked at the bloody sword which he held in his hand.\nSword! quoth he, in a happy day was the Knight born who shall wield\nyou! and certes you are well employed, for being the best in the world,\nyou belong to the noblest King! He then disarmed himself, and went to\nthe Queen; and Arban was laid in his bed, as there was great need, for\nhe was sorely wounded.\n\nAt this time King Lisuarte was hastening to London. Of the Knights whom\nhe met, some he made turn back, others he sent through the vallies and\nby all roads to recal their comrades from their search. The first whom\nhe met were Agrayes and Galvanes, and Solinan and Galdan, and Dinadaus\nand Bervas, all six together making great moan; who when they saw him\nwould have kissed his hand, but he joyfully embraced them. Sir, said\nDinadaus, the whole city are in quest of you like mad men. Nephew,\nreplied the King, take some of these Knights with you, and carry my\nshield that you may be the sooner obeyed, and turn back all whom you\nmeet. This Dinadaus was one of the best Knights of the King's lineage,\nand well esteemed among all good Knights, as well for courteous bearing\nas for his good chivalry and prowess. When they came into the high\nroad to London they fell in with Grumedan, the King's so dear friend,\nwho was conducting Oriana home; and I tell you their pleasure was\nexceeding great, and the old man told him how Amadis was gone to the\nQueen's succour. Presently they heard news what Barsinan had done, and\nhow King Arban had defended the city, and how by the coming of Amadis\nall had been ended and the traitor taken. By the time the King reached\nLondon, there were in his company more than two thousand Knights. When\nhe came to the palace, who can tell the joy that was made? Immediately\nhe had the Tower surrounded, and having made Barsinan and the Cousin\nof Arcalaus confess the whole manner of their treason, they were both\nburnt in sight of their own people, who having no provisions, neither\nany remedy, in five days came to the King's mercy, and he executed\njustice upon some and pardoned others. Thus ended this treason, but it\nwas the cause of much enmity between the countries of Great Britain\nand Sansuena, for a son of Barsinan, who was a good Knight, came\nafterwards against Lisuarte with a great power.\n\nThese dangers over the court proceeded as before, making great pastimes\nand festivals as well by night in the town, as by day in the fields.\nOn one of those days the Lady and her sons arrived, before whom Amadis\nand Galaor had made their covenant with Madasima. They seeing her went\nhonourably to bid her welcome. Friends, said she, you know wherefore I\nam come: what will you do in this case? will you not keep your promise,\nfor to-day is the time? In God's name, replied Galaor, let us go before\nthe King. Let us go, quoth she. Then coming into the presence, the Lady\nmade her obeisance and said, Sir, I come here to see these Knights\nperform a covenant which they have made; and then she repeated what\nthey had promised to Madasima, the Lady of Gantasi. Ah Galaor, cried\nthe King, you have undone me! Galaor answered, better this than to die:\nif we had been known, all the world could not have saved our lives; and\nnow the remedy is easier than you imagine. Brother, remember you have\npromised to follow my example! Then Galaor related before the King,\nand all the Knights present, by what treachery they had been taken.\nSir King, said he, I now forsake you and your company for the sake\nof Madasima, the Lady of Castle Gantasi; for it is her will to do you\nthis displeasure, and whatever others she can, for the hatred she bears\nyou. Amadis affirmed what his brother had said. Have we performed our\ncovenant? then said Galaor to the three witnesses; they answered, yes,\ntruly, you have acquitted your promise. In God's name! quoth Galaor,\nand now you may return when you please, and tell Madasima that she hath\nnot made her terms so cunningly as she thought, as you may see. Sir,\nwe have kept our covenant with Madasima, and forsaken your service;\nbut it was not stipulated how long we were to be out of your service,\ntherefore we are free to use our own will, and freely again enter your\nservice as before. At this Lisuarte was greatly pleased, and said to\nthe Lady, Certes these Knights have fairly acquitted themselves of a\npromise so treacherously obtained, and just it is that they who deceive\nshould be themselves deceived. Tell Madasima, that, if she hates me,\nshe had it in her power to do me the greatest ill that could happen;\nbut God, who has preserved them from other perils, would not suffer\nthem to perish by such hands. If it please you, Sir, said the Lady,\ntell me who these Knights are?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Amadis and Don Galaor his brother. What!\nwas Amadis in her power? cried she: now God be praised that they are\nsafe, for certes it had been great misadventure if two such good men\nhad so perished? She will be ready for pure vexation to inflict the\ndeath upon herself which she designed for them. Truly, quoth the King,\nthat would be more justly done. So the Lady went her way.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER 40._\n\n\nTwelve days together did King Lisuarte continue his court, and, when\nit broke up, though many Knights departed to their own lands, it was\na wonder how many remained, and in like manner many Dames and Damsels\ncontinued to abide with the Queen. Among those whom the King received\ninto his company were the cousins Ladasin and Guilan the pensive, both\ngood Knights, but Guilan was the better of the twain, for in the whole\nkingdom of London there was none who surpassed him in worth; but so\nabsent was he, that none could enjoy his conversation or company, and\nof this love was the cause, and that to a Lady who neither loved him\nnor any thing else to such an excess: her name was Brandalisa, sister\nto the Queen of Sobradisa, and married to the Duke of Bristol.\n\nThe day came whereon that Duke was summoned to appear and answer the\nappeal of Olivas. The Duke arrived, and was courteously by the King\nreceived. Sir, quoth he, you have summoned me to answer an accusation:\nhe who made it lies, and I am ready to acquit myself as you shall judge\nright. Then uprose Olivas, and with him all the Errant Knights present.\nLisuarte asked why they all arose. Grumedan answered, because the Duke\nthreatens all Knights Errant, and therefore we are all concerned.\nCertes, quoth the King, a mad war hath he undertaken! there is not in\nthe world a King so mighty, or so wise, that he could bring a war like\nthat to good issue! but retire you at present, and seek not now to\navenge yourselves: he shall have full justice. All then withdrew, but\nOlivas, who said, the Duke who standeth before you, Sir, hath slain my\nCousin-german, who never by word or deed gave him occasion of offence:\nI therefore accuse him as a traitor for this, and will either make him\nconfess it, or kill him, or force him out of the lists. The Duke told\nhim he lied, and that he was ready to acquit himself. The combat was\nfixed for the next day, for the Duke's two nephews who were to fight on\nhis side were not yet arrived.\n\nThey came that evening; the Duke made such account of them that he\nthought Olivas could not produce their peers. They went before the\nKing. Olivas defied the Duke, who demanded battle, three to three. Then\nDon Galvanes, who was at the feet of the King, rose, and called his\nnephew Agrayes, and said to Olivas, Friend, we promised to be on your\nside if need was: now then let the battle be. When the Duke saw them,\nhe remembered how they had rescued the Damsel whom he would have burnt,\nand he was somewhat abashed. They armed themselves, and entered the\nplace appointed for such trials; one party through the one gate, the\nother on the opposite side. From the Queen's window Olinda overlooked\nthe lists, and seeing Agrayes about to fight her heart failed her; and\nMabilia and Oriana were greatly grieved for the love they bore to him\nand Galvanes. The lists were cleared: the King withdrew from them, and\nthe champions ran their encounter. Agrayes and his Uncle dismounted\ntheir enemies, and broke both their lances. Olivas made the Duke fall\non his horse's neck, but received a deep wound himself, and the Duke\nrecovered his seat. Agrayes rode at him, and laid on him a heavy load\nof blows, heartily hating him for his great discourtesy and falsehood;\nbut one of the dismounted Knights struck at the Prince's horse, and\nburied the sword in his flank: the horse fell, and the Duke and his\nNephew both assailed Agrayes as he lay upon the ground. Don Galvanes,\nclosely busied with his antagonist, saw nothing of this. At that hour\nall who loved Agrayes were in great consternation; Amadis yearned to\nbe among them, for he greatly feared his cousin's death; the three\nDamsels above were well nigh desperate, and it was pitiful to behold\nOlinda, what she suffered. Howbeit, Agrayes got on his feet, and with\nthe good sword of Amadis, which he wielded, laid lustily about him. Ah,\nGod, cried Galaor aloud, what is Olivas about this while! better that\nhe had never borne arms, if he fails at a time like this! But Galaor\nknew not what sore agony Olivas suffered; for he had such a wound,\nand bled so fast, that it was a wonder how he kept his seat. He saw\nthe peril of Agrayes, and heaving a deep sigh, as one whose heart did\nnot fail him though his strength was failing, he cried, Oh God, let\nme help my good friend before my soul depart! and then, feebly as he\ncould, he laid hand to sword and turned upon the Duke, and his spirit\nkept him up. Agrayes was now left man to man, and he remembered that\nhis Lady saw him, and he laid on so furiously that his friends trembled\nlest his strength and breath should fail him; but this was his custom,\nand if his strength had been equal to his great courage, he would\nhave been one of the best Knights in the world; but even as it was he\nwas right good, and of great prowess. Anon he had cut through armour\nand flesh in sundry places, and left his foe quivering with death, at\nthe same moment when Olivas, fainting for loss of blood, fell from\nhis horse. The Duke not seeing how Agrayes had fared, turned upon\nGalvanes; Agrayes leaped upon Olivas's horse, and rode to his Uncle's\nassistance: he smote the Duke's Nephew upon the helmet, so that the\nsword stuck there; and plucking it away, he burst the lacings, and\nleft him bareheaded to the wrath of Galvanes, while he turned upon the\nDuke. Presently Galvanes having finished his enemy, attacked the Duke\non the other side, but his horse being wounded fell and bruised him,\nso that man to man were left. Still were all the beholders right glad;\nbut above all Don Guilan, who hoped to see the Duke slain, for the love\nhe bore to his wife. The Duke was flying, Agrayes reached the rim of\nhis shield, the sword went in, the Duke threw off the shield from his\nneck, and still fled; then turned, while Agrayes was recovering his\nsword, and struck twice at him. The Prince, as soon as his weapon was\nfree, requited him with a blow on the left shoulder that went through\nharness and flesh and bone, down to the ribs. The Duke fell, but hung\nin the stirrup, and the horse dragged him out of the lists, and when\nhe was picked up his head was found dashed to pieces by the horse's\nheels. Agrayes forthwith alighted, and ran to his uncle, and asked how\nhe fared. Bravely, quoth Galvanes, God be thanked! but I am right sorry\nfor Olivas, for methinks he is dead. They then cast the two nephews out\nof the lists; then went to Olivas, and found that he had just opened\nhis eyes, and was asking to be confessed. Galvanes looked at his wound:\ntake heart, cried he, it is not in a dangerous place! Sir, replied\nOlivas, my heart and all my limbs are dying away; I have been sore\nwounded ere now, but never was in such weakness. They disarmed him,\nand the fresh air was of service, and the blood somewhat ceased. The\nKing sent a bed whereon to remove him, and skilful surgeons dressed his\nwound, and said that though it was very deep, by God's help they could\nheal it.\n\nThe Queen then sent Grumedan to bring Brandalisa to court, and, with\nher, her niece Aldeva: Thereat was Don Guilan well pleased, and in\na month they arrived, and were honourably welcomed. So the fame of\nKing Lisuarte went abroad, and in half a year it was a marvel how\nmany Knights came from foreign parts to serve him, whom he rewarded\nbountifully, hoping by their aid not only to preserve his own kingdom,\nbut to conquer others, that in old times had been subject and tributary\nto Great Britain.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER 41._\n\n\nThis history has related to you how Amadis promised Briolania to\nrevenge her father's death, and how she gave him a sword, and that when\nin his combat with Gasinan he broke the sword, he gave the pieces to\nGandalin's care: You shall now hear how the battle was performed, and\nwhat great danger he underwent because of that broken sword, not from\nany fault of his own, but for the ignorance of his dwarf Ardian.\n\nAmadis, now recollecting that the time was come to perform his promise,\nacquainted Oriana, and requested her leave, though to him it was like\ndividing his heart from his bosom to leave her; and she granted it,\nalbeit with many tears, and a sorrow that seemed to presage what evil\nwas about to happen. Amadis took the Queen's leave for form's sake, and\ndeparted with Galaor and Agrayes. They had gone about half a league,\nwhen he asked Gandalin if he had brought the three pieces of the sword\nwhich Briolania had given him, and finding he had not, bade him return\nand fetch them. The Dwarf said he would go, for he had nothing to delay\nhim; and this was the means whereby Amadis and Oriana were both brought\ninto extreme misery, neither they nor the Dwarf himself being culpable.\n\nThe Dwarf rode back to his master's lodging, found the pieces of the\nsword, put them in his skirt, and was retiring, when, as he passed the\npalace, he heard himself called. Looking up, he saw Oriana and Mabilia,\nwho asked him why he had not gone with his master. I set out with him,\nsaid he, but returned for this; and he showed her the broken sword.\nWhat can your master want a broken sword for? quoth Oriana. Because,\nsaid the Dwarf, he values it more than the two best whole ones, for her\nsake who gave it him.\u00e2\u0080\u0094And who is she\u00e2\u0080\u0094The Lady for whom he undertakes\nthis combat, and though you are daughter to the best King in the world,\nyet, fair as you are, you would rather win what she has won, than\npossess all your father's lands.\u00e2\u0080\u0094What gain so precious hath she made?\nperchance she hath gained your master?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Yes, she has, his whole heart!\nand he remains her Knight to serve her! Then, giving his horse the\nlash, he gallopped away, little thinking the wrong he had done. Oriana\nremained pale as death; she burst into bitter reproaches against the\nfalsehood of Amadis, and wrung her hands, and her heart was so agitated\nthat not a tear did she shed. It was in vain that Mabilia and the\nDamsel of Denmark strove to allay her rage with reasonable words: as\npassionate women will do, she followed her own will, which led her to\ncommit so great an error, that God's mercy was necessary to repair it.\n\nThe Dwarf rejoined his master, and showed him the pieces of his sword,\nbut Amadis asked him no questions, and he said nothing of what had\npassed. Presently they met a Damsel, who asked whither they were\ngoing.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Along this road.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I advise you to leave it.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Why?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Because no\nKnight hath taken it for fifteen days but he hath been either slain\nor wounded. And who hath done all this mischief? quoth Amadis.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The\nbest Knight in arms that I have ever seen. Damsel, said Agrayes, you\nmust shew us this Knight.\u00e2\u0080\u0094He will shew himself so soon as you enter\nthe forest. The Damsel then followed them; they looked all round the\nforest in vain, till, as they were at the other side thereof, they saw\na Knight of good stature completely armed, on a roan horse, holding\na lance, and a Squire by him with four other lances. He speaking to\nhis Squire, the man laid the lances against a tree, and came up to\nthe Knights.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Sirs, yonder Knight sends to inform ye that he hath kept\nthis forest for fifteen days against all Knights Errant with fair\nfortune, and for the pleasure of the joust hath yet stayed a day and\na half longer than his time appointed; he says, that if it please you\nto joust with him he is ready, but there shall be no sword combat,\nfor in that he hath done much evil against his own will, and will\navoid it henceforth if he can. Agrayes had taken his helm and thrown\nthe shield round his neck, while the Squire was speaking: tell him to\ndefend himself! quoth he. They ran their race; their spears brake, and\nAgrayes was dismounted, and his horse ran loose, whereat he was greatly\nashamed. Galaor took his arms to avenge him; the lances were broken:\ntheir bodies met with such force, that Galaor's horse, being the\nweaker and more weary, fell and threw him, and then ran away. Amadis\nseeing this, blessed himself: in truth, said he, the Knight may well\nbe praised, for he hath proved himself against two of the best in the\nworld; but as he went on to take his turn he found Galaor on foot,\nwith his sword in hand defying the Knight to battle, but the Knight\nlaughed at him; and Amadis said, brother, do not chafe yourself; it was\nthe covenant that there should be no sword-battle. Then he bade the\nstranger defend himself, and they ran at each other: their spears flew\nup in splinters; they came against each other, shield and helmet; the\nhorse fell with Amadis, and the horse broke his shoulder; the Knight of\nthe forest was dismounted, but he held the reins, and lightly took the\nsaddle again. Quoth Amadis, you must joust again, for this encounter\nwas equal, we both fell. I do not chuse to joust again, said he. Amadis\nreplied, Knight, you do me wrong. Right yourself when you can! said\nthe other: I am bound no farther, as I sent to tell you! and then he\ngallopped away through the forest.\n\nAmadis leapt upon Gandalin's horse, and told his companions to follow\nhim as fast as they could to find that Knight, for they were all\ngreatly abashed. Quoth the Damsel, it will be a foolish quest: all the\nKnights of King Lisuarte's household would fail to find him without a\nguide. My friend, said Galaor, belike you know who he is, and where\nto be found? If I do, quoth she, I mean not to tell you, for I would\nbring no harm to so good a man. Ah, Damsel, said Galaor, by the faith\nyou owe to God, and by the thing in the world which you love best, tell\nme what you know of him. She answered, I care not for these conjurings,\nand will not discover him for nothing. Ask what you will, quoth\nAmadis.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Tell me your name, and promise me each a boon hereafter, when\nI shall demand it. They in their earnestness promised. When she heard\nthe name of Amadis, she exclaimed, God be praised, for I was seeking\nyou!\u00e2\u0080\u0094And wherefore?\u00e2\u0080\u0094You shall know when it is time; but tell me, have\nyou forgot your promise to the daughter of the King of Sobradisa,\nwho let loose the lions to save you? I am now going, replied Amadis,\nto perform the battle. Why then, quoth she, would you turn astray to\nfollow this Knight, who is not so easy to find as you imagine, when\nyour day is appointed for the combat? She says true, Sir brother, said\nGalaor: go you with Agrayes upon this business; I will follow the\nKnight with this Damsel, for I shall never have joy till I find him,\nand I will join you in time for the battle if it be possible. In God's\nname! cried Amadis, but tell us, Damsel, the name of the Knight.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I know\nit not, yet once I was a month with him and saw never else such deeds\nof arms; but I can show where he is to be found. Then Galaor departed\nwith her.\n\nAmadis and Agrayes proceeded till they came to the castle of Torin, the\ndwelling of that fair young Damsel, who was now grown so beautiful that\nshe appeared like a bright star. What think you of her? said Amadis.\nAgrayes answered, if her Maker designed to make her beautiful, he has\nmost perfectly accomplished his will. They were disarmed, and mantles\ngiven them, and they were conducted into the hall. But when Briolania\nsaw Amadis how young he was, for he was not twenty, and how beautiful,\nfor even the scars in his face became him, and of what fair renown he\nwas, she thought him the best Knight in the world, and greatly affected\nhim; so that when by his help she had recovered her kingdom, she would\nhave given him herself and that, but Amadis told her right loyally how\nhe was another's.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER 42._\n\n\nFour days Galaor rode with the Damsel, and so wrathful was he for\nthis fall that whatever Knight encountered him in that time felt the\neffects, and many were slain for the act of another. At length they saw\na fair fortress, built above a vale; the Damsel told him there was no\nother place near where he could lodge that night, and they made up to\nit. At the gate they found many men and Dames and Damsels, so that it\nseemed to be the house of a good man, and among them was a Knight of\nseventy years, with a cloak of scarlet skin, who courteously bade him\nwelcome. Sir, quoth Galaor, you welcome us so well, that, tho' we found\nanother host, we would not leave your hospitality. Then were they led\ninto a hall, and supper was given them right honourably; and, when the\ncloths were removed, the old Knight went to Galaor and asked him if\nthe Damsel was to be his bedfellow. He replied, no; and two Damsels\nthen conducted her to her chamber, while he was shewn a rich bed for\nhimself. Here rest yourself, said his host: God knows the pleasure I\nhave in entertaining you, and all Errant Knights, for I myself have\nbeen one, and have two sons who are the like, but both now are badly\nwounded, for there came by a Knight who dismounted them both, and they\ngreatly ashamed of their foil rode after him, and came up to him by a\nriver as he was about to cross it in a boat; and they would have made\nhim do battle with the sword, since they knew how he could joust. The\nKnight, who was in haste, would have declined the battle, but my sons\nprevented him from entering the boat. A Lady who was in the boat then\nsaid to them, that they were discourteous in detaining her Knight\nagainst her will; but they said, he must needs do battle. Let it be,\nthen, said the Lady, that he shall fight with the better of you twain,\nand if he conquer him that shall suffice. Not so, they answered; if one\nfailed, the other would prove his fortune. The Knight then grew angry,\nand cried, come both, since you will not let me proceed! and one after\nthe other he sent them from their horses, utterly confounded; then\ncrossed the river and went his way. I went afterwards to bring home\nmy sons, for they were sorely wounded: you shall see with what wounds,\nsuch as never before were given by any Knight. He then sent for the\narmour which they had worn, and it was so cut through with the sword\nthat Galaor greatly marvelled, and asked what arms the Knight bore.\u00e2\u0080\u0094A\nvermilion shield with two grey lions, and another on his helmet, and\nhe rides a roan horse. Know you who he is? cried Galaor. No, said the\nold Knight. It is the same Knight whom I am seeking, quoth Galaor, and,\nif I find him, I will revenge your two sons and myself, or die. Sir\nfriend, quoth his host, I would counsel you to forbear the attempt, for\nas for what my sons have suffered they brought it on themselves; and\nthen he bade him good night.\n\nThe next morning Galaor and his guide departed; they crossed the river\nin the boat, and proceeding about five leagues came to a fortress. Wait\nfor me a little, said the Damsel; I will be here presently: and she\nentered the castle. Presently she returned, bringing with her another\nDamsel and ten Knights on horseback; and that other Damsel, who was\npassing fair, said to Galaor, Sir, my Cousin tells me you are in quest\nof the Knight who bears two grey lions in a vermilion shield, that you\nmay know who he is; but I tell you that you cannot learn by force, for\nthere is no Knight like him in all the islands, and he will neither\ntell you nor any other for three years, unless it be forced from him.\nDamsel, said Galaor, I shall not cease my enquiry, and would rather\nlearn his name by force than by other means. Since that be so, said\nshe, within three days I will bring you to him, at my Cousin's request.\nThey set forth, and by vespers time came to an arm of the sea that\nclipped round an island, so that there was full three leagues of water\nto cross; a bark was ready at the harbour, but before they entered it\nan oath was demanded, that there was only one Knight in company. Why\nis this oath required? said Galaor. The Damsel replied, the Lady of\nthe island will have it so; when one Knight has crost over, no other\nis suffered to come till the first return, or is slain.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Who is it that\nkills or conquers them?\u00e2\u0080\u0094The Knight whom you are seeking; he has been\nhere half a year, and by this occasion: a turney was held here by the\nLady of the island, and another Dame of great beauty; this Knight came\nhither from a foreign land, and being on her side won the victory.\nWhereat she was so pleased, that she never rested till she had won him\nfor her paramour; but because he is desirous of seeking adventures,\nthe Lady, to detain him with her, invites Knights to joust against\nhim. If by chance they are slain, they are there interred; otherwise,\nthey are sent back, and he gives their arms and horses to his mistress.\nShe is a full fair Lady, and her name Corisanda; the island is called\nGravisanda. How came he, said Galaor, to keep the forest? It was a boon\nasked of him by a Damsel, said she, tho' his mistress hardly permitted\nhim to perform it.\n\nBy this they had reached the island; the night was some way advanced,\nbut it was clear moonlight, the Damsel had two tents pitched beside\na little brook, and there they supped, and rested till the morning.\nGalaor would fain have shared the Damsel's tent, but to that, albeit,\nshe thought him the fairest of all Knights and much delighted in his\nconversation, she would not consent. In the morning they set forward,\nand he asked his guide if she knew the Knight's name?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Neither man nor\nwoman in all this land know it, except his mistress. Then was Galaor\nthe more curious that one of such worth in arms should so conceal\nhimself. Presently they saw a castle on a height, surrounded for a\nleague on all sides by a rich plain. In that castle, quoth the Damsel,\nis he whom you seek. Having advanced farther, they found a stone\npillar curiously wrought, and a horn upon it. Sound that horn, said\nshe, and you shall presently see the Knight. Galaor blew the horn, and\nforthwith there came certain men from the castle, and pitched a tent\nin the meadow before the gate, and then there issued out ten Dames and\nDamsels, and in the midst of them one richly clad, who was the Lady of\nthe rest. Why does the Knight tarry? quoth Galaor, who saw all this.\nThe Damsel answered, he will not come till the Lady send for him. I\nbeseech you then, said he, go to her and request her to summon him, for\nI have much to do elsewhere and cannot tarry. When the Lady heard this\nerrand, what! cried she, holds he our Knight so cheap that he already\nthinks of doing ought elsewhere? he will depart sooner than he thinks,\nand more to his cost. Then she turned to her man: go, call the strange\nKnight. Anon he came from the castle, armed and afoot; his men led\nhis horse, and carried his shield and lance and helmet, and he went\nstraight to his mistress. You see a foolish Knight yonder, said she,\nwho thinks lightly to take his leave of you: I desire you would make\nhim know his foolishness! and then she embraced, and kissed him. All\nthis made Galaor the more angry.\n\nThe Knight mounted, and slowly rode down the height. Galaor was ready\nas soon as he saw him in the level, and bade him defend himself: they\nran at each other; both lances were broken, both shields pierced, both\nKnights deeply wounded. Don Galaor drew his sword: the stranger said\nto him, Knight, by the faith you owe to God, and to the thing you love\nbest, let us joust once more! You conjure me so, said Galaor, that I\nwill do it, but I am sorry my horse is not so good as yours, else we\nwould joust till one of us fell, or till all your lances were broken!\nThe Knight made no answer, but called to his Squire for two lances,\nand sent the one to Galaor. Again they encountered: Galaor's horse\ncame on his knees and tottered, and was almost down; the stranger lost\nboth his stirrups, and was fain to hold round the neck of his horse.\nGalaor spurred up his and had now sword in hand; thereat the stranger,\nsomewhat abashed, exclaimed, you are desirous to do combat with the\nsword; certes, I fear it rather for you than for myself: if you do not\nbelieve me, you shall see. Do your worst! quoth Galaor: I will either\ndie, or revenge those whom you left in the forest. Then the stranger\nrecollected that it was he who had defied him on foot, and he answered\nhim angrily, revenge yourself if you can, but I rather think you will\ncarry back one shame upon another.\n\nThe Ladies, seeing how gallantly they had jousted, thought they would\nthen have accorded, but when they saw the sword-battle, they were\ngreatly amazed at the fury with which it was begun. Such mortal blows\nthey gave each other, that the head was often made to bow upon the\nbreast, and the steel [50:A]arches of the helmets were cut through, and\ntheir trappings, and the sword went through the linings and was felt\nupon the head; and the field was strewn with the fragments of their\nshields and their broken mail. This continued long, till each wondered\nthat his antagonist could hold out. Galaor's horse at last began to\nfail him, and could scarcely move, whereat he waxed exceeding wroth,\nthinking that only this delayed his victory, for the stranger could\nlightly come on, and withdraw again from his blows. Galaor, when indeed\nhe did reach him, made him feel the sword, but his horse tottered as\nif he had been blind, and he began to fear his own death more than\nhe had ever done before in any battle, save in that with his brother\nAmadis, for from that he never expected to leave off alive. Next to\nAmadis, he thought this the best Knight he had ever encountered,\nalbeit he doubted not of conquering him, were it not for the fault of\nhis horse. Being in this strait, he called out. Knight! either finish\nthe battle on foot, or give me another horse, or else I will slay\nyours, and that villainy will be your fault. Do your worst! replied\nthe stranger: the battle shall not be delayed; it is a great shame\nthat it hath lasted so long. Look to your horse then! quoth Galaor.\nThe Knight rode close to him, fearing for his horse; so close, that\nGalaor caught him with both arms, and at the same instant spurred his\nown horse violently, and they both fell upon the ground, each holding\nhis sword, and there they struggled for some time before they released\neach other. But, when they rose, they attacked again so furiously as if\nthe battle were but then beginning; there was not a moment's respite,\nnow that they could freely close or strike. As the fight continued\nGalaor perceived he was gaining the better, for his enemy's strength\nevidently weakened: Good Knight! quoth he, hold a while! whereat the\nother paused, being indeed in need of rest. You see, quoth Galaor,\nthat I have the better of the battle; tell me your name, and why you\nso carefully conceal yourself, and I will acquit you from the combat\nand shall receive great pleasure; but unless you do this I will not\nleave you. Certes, quoth the Knight, I shall not leave off with these\nconditions: I never found myself so hardy in any battle as in this,\nand God forbid that any single Knight should ever know me, except to\nmy great honour. Be not rash, cried Galaor; by my faith I swear never\nto let you go till I know who you are, and why you conceal yourself.\nGod never help me, quoth the stranger, if ever you learn it from me:\nI will rather perish in battle than tell it, except to two Knights,\nto whom, tho' I know them not, I neither could nor ought to deny any\nthing. Who are they whom you value so much? quoth Galaor. Neither shall\nyou know that, replied the stranger, because it seems that it would\nplease you. Certes, rejoined Galaor; I will know what I ask, or one of\nus, or both, shall die. I am not averse to that, quoth his enemy. Then\nthey renewed the combat with full fury; but the stranger waxed weaker,\nhis armour was every where laid open and streaming with blood, till at\nlast the Lady of the Island ran like one frantic to Galaor, and cried,\nhold, Knight! would the bark had been sunk that brought thee hither!\nLady, said he, if it offends you that I am avenging myself, and one who\nis better than myself, the fault is not mine. Offer him no more harm,\nquoth she, or you shall die by the hands of one who will have no mercy.\nHe answered, I know not how that may turn out, but I will not leave him\ntill I know what I have asked.\u00e2\u0080\u0094And what is that?\u00e2\u0080\u0094His name, and why he\nconceals it? and who the two Knights are whom he esteems above the rest\nof the world. She answered, A curse upon him who taught you to strike,\nand upon you who have learnt so well! I will tell you: his name is Don\nFlorestan; he conceals himself because he hath two brothers in this\nland of such passing worth in arms, that, albeit you have proved his\nprowess, he dares not make himself known to them, till, by his fame, he\nis worthy to join them; and these two Knights are in the household of\nKing Lisuarte, the one is called Amadis, the other Don Galaor, and they\nare all three sons of King Perion. Holy Mary! cried Galaor, what have\nI done? and then he presented his sword to Florestan: good brother,\ntake my sword, and the honour of the battle!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Are you my brother?\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\nam your brother Don Galaor. Then Florestan fell on his knees before\nhim, saying, Sir, pardon me! for this offence that I have committed in\ncombatting against you, was caused by no other reason than that I durst\nnot name myself your brother, as I am, till I had somewhat resembled\nyou in prowess. Galaor raised him up, and took him in his arms, and\nwept over him for joy, and for sorrow to see him so sorely wounded.\n\n    [50:A] Cortando de los yelmos los arcos de azero con parte\n    de las faldas dellos, assi qui las espadas descendian a los\n    almofares, y las sentian en las cabe\u00c3\u00a7as.\n\nBut the Lady beholding all this was greatly rejoiced. Sir, quoth she,\nif you gave me great anguish you have repaid it with double pleasure.\nThey were then both carried into the castle and laid in bed, both in\none apartment, and Corisanda, being skilful in chirurgery, looked to\ntheir wounds herself with great care; for she knew that if the one\ndied, the other would die also for pure sorrow, and her own life would\nbe doubtful if Florestan were in great danger.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER 43._\n\n\nThis valiant and hardy Knight, Don Florestan, you should know how and\nin what land he was begotten, and by whom. Know then that when King\nPerion, being a young man and of good heart, sought adventures, he\npassed two years in Germany, doing great deeds in arms, and as he was\nreturning with great glory to his own land, he lodged one day with the\nCount of Selandia, where he was right worshipfully entertained, and\nat night he was shewn to a rich bed, and there being weary with his\njourney fell asleep. Ere long he felt a Damsel embracing him, and her\nmouth joined to his; and, waking thereat, was drawing back, but she\ncried out, how is this, Sir? would you rather be alone in the bed? The\nKing then looked at her by his chamber-light, and saw the fairest woman\nthat ever he saw: tell me, quoth he, who you are? She answered, one\nthat loves you, and gives you her love.\u00e2\u0080\u0094First tell me your name?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Why\ndo you distress me with the question?\u00e2\u0080\u0094I must know.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I am the Count's\ndaughter. Then the King said, it becomes not a woman of your rank to\ncommit this folly: I tell you I will not do this wrong to your father.\nAh, quoth she, ill betide those who praise your goodness! you are the\nworst man in the world, and the most discourteous! what goodness can\nthere be in you when you thrust away a fair Lady of such lineage? King\nPerion answered, I shall do that which is to your honour and my own,\nnot what would injure both. Then, quoth she, I will do that which shall\ngrieve my father more, than if you consent to my will! and she leapt\nup and took King Perion's sword, that same sword which was laid in the\nark with Amadis, and unsheathed it, and placed the point against her\nheart:\u00e2\u0080\u0094Will not my father grieve more for my death? When the King saw\nthat, he was greatly astonished, and he sprung from the bed, crying,\nhold! I will perform your will! and he snatched the sword from her,\nand that night she became pregnant. On the morrow Perion departed, and\nnever saw her more.\n\nShe, so long as she could, concealed her situation, and when the time\ndrew nigh contrived to go visit her Aunt, with one Damsel; but as she\nwas passing through a forest her pains came on her, and she alighted\nfrom her palfrey, and there brought forth a son. The Damsel seeing\nher in this plight, put the baby to her breast. Now, Lady, said she,\nthe same courage that you showed in sinning, show now in supporting\nyourself till I return; and then she mounted her palfrey, and rode on\nas fast as she could to the Aunt's castle, and told her all that had\nhappened. The Dame was greatly troubled, yet delayed not for that to\nsuccour her, but went forthwith with a litter, wherein she used to\nvisit her brother to shade her from the sun; and when she saw her niece\nshe alighted, and wept with her, and had her placed with the infant in\nthe litter, and taken by night into the castle, and enjoined secrecy to\nall who were with her. So the mother returned after her recovery to the\nCount's castle, and nothing was known of what had passed, and the boy\nwas educated till he was of eighteen years, a braver youth, and better\nlimbed than any other in the district; and the Dame his Aunt seeing\nthis gave him horse and arms, and took him to the Count to knight him,\nwho knew not that he whom he was knighting was his own grandson.\n\nAs they were returning, the Dame told him the secret of his birth, and\nsaid that he ought to go seek his father and make himself known to him.\nCertes, Lady, quoth he, I have often heard of King Perion, but never\nthought he was my father; but by the faith I owe to God, and to you who\nhave brought me up, neither he nor any one else shall know who I am,\ntill they can say that I am worthy to be the son of so good a man. Then\ntaking his leave, he went with two Squires to Constantinople, where he\nheard there was a cruel war; there he remained four years, and did such\ndeeds in arms as never Knight had wrought before in those parts, so\nthat at the end of that time he determined to go and discover himself\nto his father. But as he drew nearer France, he heard the fame of\nAmadis and Galaor, who were now beginning to work wonders, so that he\nchanged his first intention, and resolved to gain more honour in Great\nBritain, where there were more good Knights than in any part of the\nworld, and that he would not make himself known till his prowess had\ngiven him sufficient renown: in which mind he continued till his combat\nwith Galaor, as you have heard.\n\nAmadis and Agrayes remained five days at the castle of Torin; then all\nthings being prepared, they set forward with Briolania and her aunt,\nwho took with them two damsels and five serving-men, on horseback,\nand three palfreys laden with apparel, for Briolania went in black,\nand would wear nothing else till her father's death was avenged. As\nthey began their journey Briolania requested a boon of Amadis, and\nher Aunt another of Agrayes; the which they granted, without knowing\nwhat it might be: they then demanded, that, let what would happen, the\nKnights should not leave the road, that so their present quest might\nnot be interrupted. Much did they repent their promise, and great\nshame did they endure thereby, for in many places was their succour\nneeded, and rightly might they have bestirred themselves if they had\nbeen at liberty. Thus they travelled twelve days before they entered\nthe kingdom of Sobradisa; it was night when they reached it: they left\nthe high road, and struck by a by-way for three leagues; and then,\ngreat part of the night being past, they came to a little castle, where\na Lady dwelt named Galumba, who had served in the court of the King\nBriolania's father. She right joyfully admitted them, and set supper\nbefore them, and provided their night's entertainment; and the next\nmorning asked the Aunt whither they were going. A joyful woman was she,\nhearing that those Knights were going to revenge her Master's death;\nbut I fear, said she, lest that traitor should destroy them by some\ndeceit: for that reason, said the old Lady, am I come to consult with\nyou. Leave it to me, quoth Galumba. Then she took ink and parchment,\nand wrote a letter, and sealed it with Briolania's seal, and gave it\nto a Damsel, and directed her what she should do. The Damsel mounted\nher palfrey, and rode on till she came to the great city of Sobradisa,\nfrom whence the whole kingdom took its name. She went directly to the\npalace of Abiseos, and rode through the gate, being richly apparelled.\nThe Knights came around to assist her to dismount; but she said, no,\nshe would not alight till the King saw her, and commanded her so to\ndo. They then took her bridle, and led her into a hall where the King\nwas, with his sons and many other Knights, and he bade her alight if\nshe had any thing to say. She answered, I will, Sir, on condition that\nyou protect me, and that I shall suffer no injury for any thing that I\nmay say against you, or against any other here. The King assured her\nthat she should be under his protection and royal faith, and bade her\ndeliver what she was come to say. Upon that she alighted, and said,\nSir, I bring a message which must be delivered in the presence of all\nthe chiefs of your realm: summon them, and it shall be made known.\nQuoth Abiseos, it is as you would wish: they are already in my court,\nand have been assembled on business these six days. Call them together,\nsaid she. Forthwith they were summoned, and being all met, the Damsel\nthen said, King, Briolania, she whom you disherited, sends you this\nletter, to be read before this assembly. When Abiseos heard the name\nof his niece he was touched with shame, remembering the wrong he had\nwrought her; yet, the letter was openly read, which was to give credit\nto the Damsel's words. To this he only replied, that they were not to\nbelieve what the Damsel might say on Briolania's behalf: but the people\nof the realm who were there present were moved with great compassion\nat the name of their lawful Lady, who was so unjustly dispossessed,\nand they besought God secretly that he would no longer suffer so great\na treason to remain unpunished. Give your errand, quoth the King.\nSir King, said the Damsel, it is true that you killed the father of\nBriolania, and have disherited her of her kingdom; and you have often\ndeclared, that you and your sons would justify what you have done by\nforce of arms. Briolania now sends to say, that if you hold your word\nshe will bring here two Knights who will undertake the battle in her\ncause, and make you know your treason and great tyranny. When Darasion,\nthe eldest of the sons heard this, he arose in great anger, being of\na hot nature, and without his father's permission replied, Damsel,\nif Briolania has these Knights, I promise the combat for myself, and\nfor my father and brother; and, if I do not perform this, I promise\nbefore all these Knights to give my head to her, that she may take it\nin requital of her father's. Certes Darasion, answered the Damsel, you\nanswer like a Knight of great courage, yet may I doubt your words to\nproceed from choler, for I see you are enraged; but if you will obtain\nfrom the King an assurance of your words, I shall think they proceed\nfrom that great worth and hardihood which are in you. What would you\nhave? quoth he. Cause the King, she replied, to give our Knights\nassurance that, for any mishap which you may receive in the battle,\nthey shall sustain no injury from any in this land, nor be meddled\nwithal but by you three: give them this safe conduct, and they will\nbe here within three days. Darasion knelt down before his father;\u00e2\u0080\u0094you\nsee, Sir, what the Damsel requests, and what I have promised; and,\nbecause my honour is yours, let it be granted, else they will without\ndanger have put us to shame, for we have always avowed that if any\none attainted your deeds we would justify it in battle; and even\nwithout the promise we ought to accept the defiance, for they tell me\nthese Knights are some of King Lisuarte's rash household, whose pride\nand folly makes them magnify their own worth and despise all others.\nThe King, albeit he felt himself guilty of his brother's murder, and\ndreaded the battle, yet, because he loved his son as he did himself,\ngave the safe conduct as the Damsel had demanded, the hour appointed by\nthe Most High being come. The Damsel having accomplished this, said,\nhold yourselves ready, for to-morrow the Knights will be here. And then\nshe mounted her palfrey, and departed.\n\nMuch were the Ladies and the Knights rejoiced at the success of her\nembassy. When Amadis heard that Darasion held them as fools, because\nthey were of King Lisuarte's household, he grew angry, and exclaimed,\nthere are those in that household who could easily break his pride, and\nhis head too! but, when he had said this, he was ashamed that he had\nbeen so mastered by anger. Briolania, who could not keep her eyes off\nhim, observed this, and said, you cannot, Sir, either say or do any\nthing against those traitors which they have not deserved, and worse:\nhave pity on me, since you know my father's murder, and my wrongs: my\ntrust is in God and in you. Amadis, whose heart was submiss to virtue\nand all gentleness, moved with pity for that fair Damsel, answered, if\nGod be so pleased, Lady, I ween that ere to-morrow night your sorrow\nwill be turned into joy. Then Briolania would, for thankfulness, have\nhumbled herself to have kissed his feet, but he drew back abashed, and\nAgrayes raised her up. They determined to set forward by day-break, and\nhear mass at the chapel of the Three Fountains, which was half a league\nfrom Sobradisa.\n\nThat night they made good cheer, and Briolania, who talked much with\nAmadis, was oftentimes moved to offer marriage to him, but seeing his\nfrequent reveries, and the tears that sometimes fell down his cheeks,\nwhich she knew proceeded from no fear in his brave heart, she suspected\nthat he loved elsewhere, and so refrained. At dawn they all departed;\nand, arriving at the Three Fountains, heard mass from the good Hermit,\nwho hearing wherefore they were on their way, besought God to speed\nthem well in the battle, as he knew their cause was right. There they\narmed themselves all save the head and hands, and so proceeded to\nthe city. Without the walls they found King Abiseos and his sons,\nand a great company attending them: the people all flocked towards\nBriolania, whom in their hearts they loved, thinking her their rightful\nand natural Lady. Amadis led her bridle, and uncovered her face,[65:A]\nthat all might see her how beautiful she was: she was weeping, and the\nmultitude blessed her in their hearts, and prayed that she might now\nbe restored to her rights. Abiseos dissembled a feeling from which\nneither his ambition nor his wickedness could shield him, and seeing\nhow the people flocked round Briolania, he exclaimed, fools, I see\nhow you rejoice in her sight! but it is to your honour and safety\nthat a Knight like me should protect you, not a weak woman; who in\nso long a time has only been able to get these two Knights for her\nchampions; whom, because they are thus deceitfully brought to their\ndeath, or dishonour, I cannot forbear to pity. These words so kindled\nthe indignation of Amadis, that blood seemed starting from his eyes;\nhe rose in his stirrups that all might hear him, and answered, King\nAbiseos, I well see how the coming of Briolania troubles you, because\nyou have murdered her father, who was your King and brother: if there\nbe yet virtue enough in you to resign to her what is her own, I will\nexcuse the battle, that you may have leisure for repentance, that,\nthough you have lost your honour in this world, you may save your soul.\nBefore the King could reply, Darasion exclaimed, Thou foolish Knight\nof King Lisuarte's court! I never thought I could endure to hear a\nspeech like thine: come on! and if your heart fails, you cannot fly\nwhere I cannot reach you with such a vengeance, that none can behold it\nwithout compassion. Arm thyself, traitor, and do battle! quoth Agrayes.\nDarasion answered, say what thou wilt now! presently I will send thy\ntongue without thy body to King Lisuarte's court, as a warning to all\nsuch fools! Then they armed themselves; and Amadis and Agrayes laced on\ntheir helmets, and took their shields and spears, and entered the place\nwhich had been of yore marked out for such trials. Dramis, the second\nson, who was so good a Knight that no two Knights of that country could\nkeep the field against him, said to his father, Sir, where you and my\nbrother are present, I might well be excused from speaking; but now I\nhave to act with that strength which I have received from God and you.\nLeave that Knight who has reviled you to me: if I do not slay him with\nthe first lance-thrust, may I never again bear arms! or if it be his\ngood fortune that the spear does not strike right, the first blow with\nthe sword shall do it. There were many who heard this speech, and did\nnot think it vain boasting, he was of such exceeding strength. Darasion\nlooked round the lists: how is this? quoth he; ye are but two! hath the\nheart of the third failed him? call him to come directly, for we will\nnot tarry. Trouble not yourself about the third, said Amadis, you will\npresently wish the second away: now look to your defence!\n\n    [65:A] _Quitole los antifazes._ She was muffled in the Moorish\n    manner, not veiled.\n\nThey placed their shields before them, and gave their horses the rein.\nDramis ran right at Amadis, and pierced his shield and broke his lance\nagainst his side; but Amadis smote him so roughly, that the spear went\nthrough his shield, and, without piercing his breast-plate, burst his\nheart within him, and he fell like the fall of a tower. In God's name,\ncried Ardian the Dwarf, my Master's deed is better than his word! The\nother twain ran at Agrayes: he and Darasion broke their lances upon\neach other, and both kept their seats. Abiseos failed in his course;\nhe saw Dramis on the ground, and in great grief, albeit he did not\nsuppose him to be dead, ran full at Amadis, and pierced his shield, and\nbroke the lance in his arm, so that all thought he could not continue\nthe battle. Well may you think how Briolania felt at that; her heart\nsunk, and the sight of her eyes failed her, and without support she\nwould have fallen from her palfrey. But he, who was not to be dismayed\nby such wounds, graspt well that good sword which he had so lately\nrecovered from Arcalaus, and struck Abiseos upon the helm; through helm\nit went, and slanted down the head, and pierced into the shoulder; a\nslant wound, but so staggering that Abiseos tottered on his seat, and\nfell, half senseless. Then he of Gaul rode up to Darasion, who was\nclose engaged with Agrayes:\u00e2\u0080\u0094now Darasion, you had rather the second\nwere absent, than that the third were come! Agrayes cried out to him\nto hold:\u00e2\u0080\u0094Cousin, you have done enough, leave me this man who has\nthreatened to cut out my tongue. Amadis did not hear him; he had made a\nblow which sliced off a part of the shield, and came through the pummel\nof the saddle to the horse's neck; but Darasion, as he past, ran his\nsword into the belly of Amadis's horse; the horse instantly ran away;\nthe reins broke in the rider's hand, and Amadis seeing that he had\nno remedy, and that he should be carried out of the lists, struck the\nbeast between the ears with his sword, and split his head; the fall\nbruised him sorely, but he arose, and turned to Abiseos.\n\nAt this time Agrayes had driven his sword into Darasion's helmet, so\nthat he could not recover it. Darasion had forced it from his hand,\nand was driving at him. Agrayes grappled him; they fell together and\nstruggled on the ground. Abiseos came up, and was lifting the skirts of\nhis armour to thrust his sword into him. Amadis came up in time. The\nKing was compelled to look to his own safety; he lifted his shield,\nthe blow dashed shield against helmet, and made him reel. Agrayes and\nDarasion had loosed each other: Agrayes caught up Darasion's sword;\nDarasion plucked the other from his helm, and ran towards his father.\nAmadis saw that Agrayes was all bloody from a wound in his neck, and\nfearing it was mortal, he cried, leave them to me, good cousin, and\nrest yourself! I have no wound, quoth Agrayes, to keep me from aiding\nyou: see if it be so! Have at them, then! cried Amadis; but the fear he\nfelt for his cousin gave him such anger, that presently his enemies,\ntheir armour all hacked, and their flesh too, began to turn here and\nthere disorderly, and with the fear of death. So it continued till the\nhour of tierce, when Abiseos, seeing death before him, lifted his sword\nin both hands, and ran desperately at Amadis, and gave him a blow,\nsuch as might not be looked for from a man so wounded: it cut away the\nbrim of the helmet, and the shoulder mail and a part of the flesh with\nit. Amadis felt it sorely, and did not delay to give him his wages: he\nstruck his shoulder, and lopt off that arm with which he had murdered\nhis own king and brother; arm and shoulder he lopt off, and cried, that\narm brought thee by treason to the throne, and it now brings thee to\ndeath and the depth of hell! The King had fallen in the pangs of death.\nAmadis looked round him, and saw that Agrayes had smitten off the head\nof Darasion. Then the people of the land went joyfully to kiss the hand\nof Briolania their [70:A]Lady.\n\n    [70:A] There follows in the original a page of advice to all\n    wicked kings and rulers.\n\nThe conquerors dragged their enemies out of the lists. Amadis, though\nhe was much wounded, would not disarm himself till he knew if there\nwere any to gainsay Briolania's right. But one of the chiefs of the\nrealm, by name Goman, came before him with an hundred men of his\nlineage and household, and they declared that they had only endured the\nusurpation of Abiseos because they had no remedy: now God had delivered\nthem, they were in that loyalty and vassallage which they owed to\nBriolania. Within eight days all the kingdom came joyfully to do homage\nto her. Amadis meantime was laid in bed, and that fair Queen never left\nhim but when she went to sleep herself. Agrayes, who was dangerously\nwounded, was put under the care of a skilful man, who suffered none to\napproach him, that he might not speak, for the wound was in his throat.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER 44._\n\n\nDon Galaor and Florestan remained in the castle of Corisanda till their\nwounds were well healed, then took they their departure; but Corisanda\nmade such sorrow that it was pitiful to see her, albeit Florestan\ncomforted her, and assured her of his speedy return. They crossed to\nthe mainland, and proceeded towards Sobradisa, hoping to arrive there\nbefore the battle. Brother, quoth Florestan, as they rode along, grant\nme a boon for courtesy. Sir, and good brother, cried Galaor, is it a\nthing that I shall repent? You will not repent it, said Florestan.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Ask\nit then; for what I can grant without shame, I shall grant with good\nwill.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I ask then, that you will attempt no combat in this journey\ntill I have tried my fortune. Certes, quoth Galaor, I repent. Not so,\nreplied Florestan, for if there be any worth in me, it is to your\nhonour as well as to mine. Four days they rode without adventure:\non the fifth at evening they came to a Tower. A Knight, who stood at\nthe court-gate, courteously invited them for the night; and there\nwere they worshipfully entertained. The Knight their host, was a fair\nKnight and a wise, and of goodly stature; but oftentimes he appeared\nso lost in thought and sadness, that the brethren asked each other\nwhat it might mean, and Don Galaor at last said to him, Sir, methinks\nyou are not so chearful as you should be! if your sadness is for any\ncause which our aid can remedy, tell us, and we will do your will.\nMany thanks, replied he of the Tower: I believe you would do so like\ngood Knights; but my sadness proceeds from the force of love, and I\nwill not tell you more now, for it would be to my own great shame. The\nhour of sleeping came on; their host went to his apartment, and the\nbrethren remained in a handsome chamber where there were two beds. In\nthe morning he rode to bear them company, but unarmed; and, that he\nmight see whether they were such in arms as their appearance bespoke\nthem, he led them not along the high road, but through bye ways, till\nthey came to a place called the fountain of the Three Elms, for there\nwere three great and lofty Elm-trees above the fountain. Three fair\nDamsels and well apparelled, were by the fountain, and there was a\nDwarf aloft in the trees. Florestan went first and saluted them gently,\nas a courteous man, and one who had been gently bred. God save you, Sir\nKnight, quoth the one; if you are as brave as you are handsome, God\nhath gifted you well. Damsel, he replied, if my beauty pleaseth you,\nmy courage would please you more if it were put to proof. You answer\nwell, quoth she: see now, if your courage be enough to carry me from\nhence.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Certes, quoth Florestan, little goodness is enough for that;\nsince it is your pleasure, I will do it.\u00e2\u0080\u0094He then bade his Squires place\nher upon a palfrey which was tied to one of the Elms: when the Dwarf,\nwho was sitting up in the tree, cried out aloud, Come forth, Knights,\ncome forth! they are carrying away your mistress! At these words a\nKnight, well armed and on a great horse, came up from the valley, and\ncried out to Florestan, Knight! who bid you lay your hands upon that\nDamsel? I do not think she can be yours, replied Florestan, seeing of\nher own will she desired me to carry her hence. The Knight answered,\nthough she consent, I do not; and I have defended her against better\nthan you.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I know not how that may be, but unless you act up to your\nwords, carry her away I will!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Learn first what the Knights of the\nValley are, and how they defend their mistresses! With that they ran\nat each other, and Florestan smote his shield so strongly against\nhis helmet that the laces brake, and the helmet came off. The Knight\ncould not keep his seat; he fell upon his sword, and broke it in two.\nFlorestan turned his horse and pointed his lance at him:\u00e2\u0080\u0094you are dead,\nunless you yield the Damsel! I yield her, quoth he, and cursed be she,\nand the day wherein I first beheld her, for she made me commit so many\nfollies that at last I have destroyed myself. Florestan left him, and\nwent to the Damsel, saying, you are mine! You have well won me, quoth\nshe, and may do with me as you please. Let us go then! said he; but\none of the other Damsels then said to him, Sir Knight, you are parting\ngood company; we have been a year together, and it grieves us to be\nseparated. Said Florestan, if you chuse to go in my company I will take\nyou also, otherwise you must be separated, for I will not leave so fair\na Damsel as this. And if she be fair, quoth the Damsel, neither do I\nesteem myself so ugly, but that Knight should venture something for me\nalso; but I believe you are not of that temper. What! cried he, think\nyou that I would leave you here for fear? so help me as I would have\ndone so only to respect your free will, but you shall see. He bade the\nSquires place her also on her palfrey, and the Dwarf, who sate up\naloft, cried out again for help.\n\nPresently there came another Knight from the valley, and said to\nFlorestan, Don Cavalier, you have won one Damsel, and, not content with\nher, you would carry off another; you must, therefore, lose both, and\nyour head too; for it is not fit that a Knight of such degree as you\nshould have in your keeping a Damsel of such rank. You praise yourself\nbountifully, quoth Florestan; yet had I rather have two Knights of my\nkin for my helpers than thee! I neither regard thee nor them, said the\nKnight: you have won this Damsel from him who could not defend her; if\nI conquer thee, she shall be mine; if the victory is yours, you shall\ntake the other whom I defend. Content, quoth Florestan. Defend yourself\nnow, if you can! said he of the valley; and they ran their encounter.\nThe Knight pierced through Florestan's shield, and broke his lance\nagainst the strong mail. Florestan failed in the race; ashamed at that,\nwhen the Knight had taken from his Squire another lance, he ran again,\nand pierced the shield of his antagonist and the arm that held it, and\ndrove him back upon the crupper of his horse; the horse reared and\nthrew him, and, the ground being hard, he neither moved hand nor foot.\nDamsel, said Florestan, you are mine; for methinks your friend can\nneither help you nor himself. So it seems, quoth she.\n\nFlorestan looked at the other Damsel, who now remained alone by the\nfountain, and saw that she was very sad. Damsel, said he, if it please\nyou, I will not leave you here alone. She did not answer him, but\nsaid to his host, Go from hence, I counsel you! you know that these\nKnights are not enough to protect you from him who will presently be\nhere, and, if he take you, you are sure to die. I will see what may\nhappen, he answered, my horse is swift, and my Tower at hand. Ah, said\nshe, take care of yourself; ye are but three, and you unarmed, and you\nwell know that is nothing against him. When Florestan heard this, he\nbecame more desirous to carry away that Damsel, and see him whom she\npraised so greatly. So he had her also placed on her palfrey; and the\nDwarf, who sate up aloft, said, Don Cavalier, in an ill hour are you\nso bold: here comes one who shall take vengeance for all! and then he\nshouted out, help! help, Sir! you linger too long! Presently there came\nanother Knight from the same valley; his armour was inlaid with gold,\nand he rode upon a bay horse, big enough for a giant. Two Squires\ncame after him, armed with corselets and morions like serving men, and\neach carried a huge battle-axe in his hand, in the use of which weapon\ntheir master prided himself. He cried out to Florestan, stay, Knight,\nand seek not to fly, for it will not save you: die you must, and it is\nbetter die like a brave man, than like a coward! When Florestan heard\nhimself threatened, he waxed wonderous angry, and cried out, come on,\nwretch and rascal, and clumsy[78:A] fool! So help me God, as I fear\nthee no more than a great cowardly beast. Ah, quoth the Knight, how it\ngrieves me that I cannot wreak sufficient vengeance upon thee! would\nthat the best four of thy lineage were here, that I might cut off their\nheads with thine! Protect yourself from one, cried Florestan, you may\ndispense with the rest. Then, being both greatly incensed, they ran\nat each other, and the shields and the mails of both were pierced\nwith the violence of the encounter: the large Knight lost both his\nstirrups, and was fain to save himself by clinging round his horse's\nneck. Florestan, as he past on, caught at one of the battle-axes, and\nplucked it with such force from the Squire who held it, that both the\nman and his horse were brought to the ground. The Knight of the Valley\nhad recovered his seat, and was ready with the other battle-axe, and\nFlorestan made at him with equal arms: both struck at once, each on the\nhelmet of his enemy; the axes went in three fingers' depth. Florestan\nbowed his face upon his breast with the weight of the blow: the Knight\nfell upon the neck of his horse, and the axe, being fast in the other's\nhelmet, slipt from his hand; before he could raise himself, Florestan\nsmote him as he lay between the helm and gorget, so that his head fell\nat the horse's feet. This done, he turned to the Damsels. Certes, good\nKnight, quoth the first of them, I once thought that not ten such as\nyou could have won us.\n\n    [78:A] Ven cativa cosa, y mala, y fuera de razon, sin talle.\n    The language of vituperation is not easily translatable.\n\nThe young Knight, their host, then came up to Florestan, and said, Sir,\nI love this Damsel dearly, and she loves me. It is a year since this\nKnight whom you have slain hath forcibly detained her, so that I could\nnot see her: now, that I may receive her from your hands, I beseech\nyou refuse me not. My host, quoth Florestan, of a truth I will right\ngladly aid you, if it be as you say; but against her will I will yield\nher to none. Ah, Sir, cried the Damsel, this is with my will! I beseech\nyou give me to him: he is my true love. Florestan answered, in God's\nname, dispose of yourself as you like best! and she went joyfully to\nher true love. Galaor then gave his horse to their friend, and took\nthe bay horse of the dead Knight, which was the handsomest he had ever\nseen, and then they separated. The two Damsels whom Florestan had won,\nwere young and fair; he took the one to himself, and gave the other to\nGalaor: I give you to this Knight, said he, and command you to do as\nhe pleases. What! quoth she, do you give me to this Knight, who has\nnot the heart of a woman? who stood by and saw you in such danger,\nand did not help you? Damsel, answered Florestan, by my faith to God\nand to you, I swear that I give you to the best Knight whom I know\nin the world, except it be Amadis my Lord. The Damsel then looked at\nGalaor, and seeing him so handsome, and so young, she marvelled at his\nworth, and granted him her love. That night they had their lodging at\nthe house of a Lady, sister to their last night's host. On the morrow\nthey resumed their road, and said to their fair friends, we have a\nlong journey to perform thro' foreign lands, where you would endure\nmany hardships in following us: tell us where you would like best to\ngo, and there we will conduct you. They replied, that their Aunt had\na castle four days journey on that road whither they would go. As\nthey proceeded, Galaor asked his Damsel how she came into the power\nof those Knights. She answered, that great Knight who was slain loved\nthe Damsel who went with your host, but she hated him. He took her by\nforce, for he was the best Knight in all these parts, and none could\ngainsay him, yet would she never yield him her love; and he, for the\naffection he bore her, withheld from offering her any wrong; and he\nsaid to her, My fair friend, great reason is it that I should be loved\nby you, being the best Knight in the world. Now I will do this for your\nsake: there is a Knight who is called the best that ever was, Amadis of\nGaul by name, and he slew my cousin Dardan, in King Lisuarte's court;\nI will find him, and cut off his head, and then shall I inherit all\nhis renown. Till I do this, I will give you two of the fairest Damsels\nin all this land for your companions, and they shall have the two best\nKnights of my lineage for their friends; and you shall every day be\ntaken to the fountain of the Three Elms, where many Errant Knights\npass, that you may see brave jousting, and learn to love me as I love\nyou. He then took us by force, and gave us to his kinsmen, and thus had\nwe past a year, till Don Florestan broke the bonds. That Knight, quoth\nGalaor, had a haughty mind: what was his name? Alumas, she answered;\nand, if it had not been for his exceeding pride, he was of great\nprowess. Thus they proceeded till they reached the Lady's castle, who\nthankfully entertained them, because they had delivered her nieces from\nAlumas and his kinsmen, who had forcibly and dishonourably detained\nthem.\n\nGalaor and Florestan proceeded till they reached the kingdom of\nSobradisa, and there heard the joyful tidings of what their brother\nand Agrayes had done. They hastened to the city, and went immediately\nto the palace, where Amadis and his cousin, now whole of their wounds,\nwere conversing with the new Queen. Amadis, from the Damsel who had\nguided Galaor, knew who they were, and went to welcome Florestan with\ntears of joy, embracing and kissing him who would have knelt before\nhim. But when Briolania saw four such Knights in her palace, and\nrecollected how powerful she now was, and how lately she had lived,\nnot without fear, in a single castle, she knelt down, and thanked the\nMost High for the mercy he had vouchsafed her. Of a truth, Sirs, said\nshe, these changes are the work of him, before whom the mightiest are\nnothing; but for this dominion, and this wealth, which we suffer so\nmuch anxiety and trouble to gain, and having gained, to keep; would it\nbe better, as being neither certain nor durable in themselves, and as\nthings superfluous and destructive to the body, and moreover to the\nsoul,\u00e2\u0080\u0094would it be better to reject and abhor them? Certainly I say,\nno: and affirm, that, when they are gained with a good conscience, and\njustly administered, we may enjoy from them comfort and pleasure and\njoy in this world, and everlasting glory in the next.\n\n\n  _Here endeth the First Book of the noble and virtuous\n  Knight, Amadis of Gaul._\n\n\n\n\n_AMADIS of GAUL._\n\nBook the Second.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER 1._\n\n\nThere was a King in Greece married to the sister of the Emperor of\nConstantinople, by whom he had two fair sons, especially the elder,\nnamed Apolidon, who in his days had no equal for strength of body and\ncourage of heart. He having a subtle genius, which is so seldom found\nwith valour, gave himself to the study of the sciences and of all arts,\nso that he shone among those of his own time like the Moon among the\nstars; especially he excelled in necromancy, whereby things that appear\nimpossible are done. The King his father was very rich in treasure,\nbut poor in life, by reason of his great age; and seeing himself at\nthe point of death, he commanded that the kingdom should be given to\nApolidon, as his eldest son, and his books and treasures to the other.\nThe younger was not contented with this, and told his father so with\ntears, and complained that he was disherited; but the old man, not\nknowing what to do, wrung his hands for pure sorrow. Then that famous\nApolidon, seeing his father's grief and the littleness of his brother,\nbade him take comfort, for he would accept the books and treasure, and\nrelinquish the kingdom to his brother. Whereat the father gave him his\nblessing with many tears. So Apolidon took his inheritance, and fitted\nout certain ships, manning them with chosen Knights, and set forth into\nthe sea, trusting himself to Fortune, who seeing his great obedience to\nhis father, and how he had thrown himself upon her mercy, resolved to\nrequite him with glory and greatness. A fair wind carried him to the\nempire of Rome, where Siudan was then Emperor, at whose court he abode\nsome time, doing great feats in arms, till there grew a true affection\nbetween him and the Emperor's sister, Grimanesa, who then flourished\namong all other women for beauty. So it was that as he was loving, even\nso was he loved, and as their loves might no other ways be indulged,\nthey left Rome together, and set sail in Apolidon's fleet, and sailed\ntill they came to the Firm Island. There Apolidon landed, not knowing\nwhat country it was, and pitched a tent upon the shore, and placed a\ncouch there for his Lady, who was weary of the sea. Presently there\ncame down a fierce Giant, who was Lord of the island, with whom,\naccording to the custom of the place, Apolidon was to do battle for the\npreservation of his Lady and himself, and his company. It ended in such\nsort that the Giant lay dead on the field, and Apolidon remained master\nof the island. When he had seen its strength, he neither feared the\nEmperor of Rome, whom he had offended, nor all the world besides; and\nthere he and Grimanesa, being greatly beloved by the islanders, whom he\nhad delivered from their oppressor, dwelt in all happiness for sixteen\nyears. During that time many rich edifices were made, as well with\nhis great treasures, as with his surpassing wisdom, such as it would\nhave been difficult for any Emperor or King, how rich soever, to have\ncompleted. At the end of that time the Emperor of Greece died without\nan heir, and the Greeks, knowing the great worth of Apolidon, and that\nby his mother's side he was of the blood and lineage of the Emperors,\nelected him with one common consent to rule over them. He, albeit\nhe was enjoying all possible delights in his own island, yet, with\nGrimanesa's consent, accepted the Empire; but she, before they left\nthe island where she had enjoyed such rare happiness, requested her\nhusband that he would work such a means by his great knowledge, that\nthat island might never be possessed, except by a Knight as excellent\nin arms and loyal in love as himself, and by a Dame resembling her in\nbeauty and truth.\n\nThen Apolidon made an arch at the entrance of a garden, wherein there\nwere all kind of trees, and also four rich chambers, but it was so\nsurrounded that none could enter, except by passing under the arch,\nover which he placed the Image of a man made of copper, holding a\ntrumpet in his mouth as if he would wind it. And in one of the chambers\nwithin he placed two figures, in the likeness of himself and his Lady,\nthe countenances and the stature like unto them, so true that they\nseemed alive, and near them he placed a bright stone of jasper; and,\nabout the distance of half a cross-bow shot, he made a [87:A]perron\nof iron. Henceforward, said he, no man or woman who hath been false\nto their first love shall pass here, for yonder Image shall blow from\nthat trumpet so dreadful a blast with smoke and flames of fire, that\nthey shall be stunned and cast out as dead. But if Knight, or Dame, or\nDamsel come, worthy by virtue of true loyalty to finish this adventure,\nthey shall enter without let, and the Image shall make a sound so sweet\nthat it shall be delightful to hear, and they shall see our images,\nand behold their own name written in the jasper. Grimanesa afterwards\nordered some of her Knights and Ladies to make trial, and then the\nImage blew the dreadful blast with smoke and flames of fire; whereat\nGrimanesa laughed, knowing them to be in more dread than danger. But\nyet, my Lord, quoth she, what shall be done with that rich chamber\nwherein we have enjoyed such great contentment? He answered, you shall\nsee. Then he made two other perrons, one of stone, the other of copper:\nthe stone one was placed five paces from the chamber, the copper one\nfive paces farther off. Know now, said he, that henceforth in no\nmanner, nor at any time, shall man or woman enter this chamber, till\na Knight come who surpasses me in prowess, or a woman exceeding you\nin beauty; they shall enter. He then placed these words in the copper\nperron: Knights shall advance here, each according to his valour; and\nin the stone perron, he wrote: here none shall pass except the Knight\nwho exceeds Apolidon in prowess. And over the door of the chamber he\nwrote: He who surpasses me in prowess shall enter here, and be Lord of\nthe island. And he laid such a spell, that none could approach within\ntwelve paces of the chamber round about, nor was there any entrance but\nby the perrons.\n\n    [87:A] _Padron_ is the Spanish word: the English version\n    renders it pillar, but the word means more; there must be\n    a roof and a flooring. Our market-crosses would be called\n    _padrones_. _Perron_ is used in the English Amadis of Greece.\n\nThen he appointed a Governor to rule the island, and collect the\nrevenues, which were to be reserved for the Knight who should enter\nthe chamber; and he commanded that all who failed in attempting to\npass the Arch of Lovers, should, without ceremony, be cast out of\nthe island; but such as passed through were to be entertained and\nserved with all honour. And farther, he appointed that all Knights who\nattempted the adventure of the Forbidden Chamber, and did not pass\nthe copper perron, should leave their arms there; but from those who\nadvanced any way beyond it, only their swords should be taken. They\nwho reached to the marble perron should leave only their shields, and\nif they penetrated beyond that, but failed to enter the chamber, they\nshould lose only their spurs. From the Dames and Damsels who failed,\nnothing was to be taken, only their names should be placed upon the\ncastle-gate, and an account how far they had advanced. Apolidon then\nsaid, when this island shall have another Lord, the enchantment shall\nbe dissolved, and all Knights may freely pass the perrons and enter the\nchamber; but it shall not be free for women, till the fairest shall\nhave come, and lodged in the rich chamber with the Lord of the island.\nThese enchantments being thus made, Apolidon and his wife entered their\nships, and passed over into Greece, where they reigned during their\nlives, and left children to succeed them.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER 2._\n\n\nWhile Amadis remained with his comrades at the court of Sobradisa,\nhis thoughts were perpetually fixed upon his Lady Oriana; and, so\nthoughtful was he, and so often, both sleeping and waking, was he in\ntears, that all saw how he was troubled, yet knew they not the cause,\nfor he kept his love silent, as a man who had all virtues in his\nheart. At length, not being able to support a longer absence, he asked\npermission of the fair young Queen to depart, which she not without\nreluctance having granted, loving him better than herself, he and his\nbrethren and their cousin Agrayes took the road towards King Lisuarte.\nSome days had they travelled when they came to a little church,\nand entering there to say their prayers, they saw a fair Damsel,\naccompanied by two others, and by four Squires, who guarded her, coming\nfrom the door. She asked them whither they went. Amadis answered,\nDamsel, we go to the court of King Lisuarte, where, if it please you\nto go, we will accompany you. Thank you, quoth the Damsel, but I am\nfaring elsewhere. I waited, because I saw you were armed like Errant\nKnights, to know if any of you would go and see the wonders of the Firm\nIsland, for I am the Governor's daughter, and am returning there. Holy\nMary! cried Amadis, I have often heard of the wonders of that island,\nand should account myself happy if I might prove them, yet till now\nhave I never prepared to go! Good Sir, quoth she, do not repent of your\ndelay; many have gone there with the same wish, and returned not so\njoyfully as they went. So I have heard, said Amadis: tell me, would it\nbe far out of our road if we went there?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Two days journey.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Is the Firm\nIsland then in this part of the sea, where is the enchanted Arch of\nTrue Lovers, under which neither man nor woman can pass that hath been\nfalse to their first love? The Damsel answered, it is a certain truth,\nand many other wonders are there. Then Agrayes said to his companions,\nI know not what you will do, but I will go with this Damsel, and see\nthese wonderful things. If you are so true a lover, said she, as to\npass the enchanted Arch, you will see the likenesses of Apolidon and\nGrimanesa, and behold your own name written upon a stone, where you\nwill find only two names written besides, though the spell hath been\nmade an hundred years. In God's name let us go, quoth Agrayes, and I\nwill try whether I can be third. With that, Amadis, who in his heart\nhad no less desire and faith to prove the adventure, said to his\nbrethren, we are not enamoured, but we should keep our cousin company\nwho is, and whose heart is so bold. Thereto they all consented, and set\nforth with the Damsel. What is this island? said Florestan to Amadis,\ntell me, Sir, for you seem to know. A young Knight whom I greatly\nesteem, replied Amadis, told me all I know; King Arban of North Wales:\nhe was there four days, but could accomplish none of the adventures,\nand so departed with shame. The Damsel then related the history of the\nenchantments, which greatly incited Galaor and Florestan to the proof.\n\nSo they rode on till sunset, and then entering a valley, they saw many\ntents pitched in a meadow, and people sporting about them, and one\nKnight, richly apparelled, who seemed to be the chief. Sirs, quoth the\nDamsel, that is my father: I will go advertise him of your coming,\nthat he may do you honour. When he heard of their desire to try the\nenchantment, he went on foot with all his company to welcome them,\nand they were honourably feasted and lodged that night. At morning\nthey accompanied the Governor to his castle, which commanded the whole\nisland, for at the entrance there was a neck of land, only a bow-shot\nover, connected with the main land, all the rest was surrounded by the\nsea; seven leagues in length it was, and five broad, and because it was\nall surrounded by the sea, except where that neck of land connected\nit with the continent, it was called the Firm Island. Having entered,\nthey saw a great palace, the gates whereof were open, and many shields\nhung upon the wall; about an hundred were in one row, and above them\nwere ten, and above the ten were two, but one of them was in a higher\nniche than the other. Then Amadis asked why they were thus ranked.\nThe Governor answered, according to the prowess of those who would\nhave entered the Forbidden Chamber; the shields of those who could\nnot enter the perron of copper, are near the ground; the ten above\nthem are of those who reached it; the lowest of the two passed that\nperron, and the one above all reached to the marble perron, but could\npass no farther. Then Amadis approached the shields to see if he knew\nthem, for each had its owner's name inscribed; the one which was the\nhighest of the ten bore a sable lion, with argent teeth and nails, and\na bloody mouth, in a field sable: this he knew to be the shield of\nArcalaus. Then he beheld the two uppermost; the lower bore, in a field\nazure, a Knight cutting off the head of a Giant; this was the shield of\nKing Abies of Ireland, who had been there two years before his combat\nwith Amadis: the highest had three golden flowers in a field azure:\nthis he knew not, but he read the inscription, This is the shield of\nDon Quadragante, brother to King Abies of Ireland. He had proved the\nadventure twelve days ago, and had reached the marble perron, which was\nmore than any Knight before him had done, and he was now gone to Great\nBritain to combat Amadis, in revenge for his brother's death. When\nAmadis saw all these shields, he doubted the adventure much, seeing\nthat such Knights had failed.\n\nThey went out from the palace towards the Arch of True Lovers. When\nthey came near, Agrayes alighted and commended himself to God, and\ncried, Love, if I have been true to thee, remember me! and he past the\nspell; and, when he came under the arch, the Image blew forth sweet\nsounds, and he came to the palace, and saw the likeness of Apolidon\nand Grimanesa, and saw also the jasper-stone, wherein two names were\nwritten, and now his own the third. The first said, Madanil, son of the\nDuke of Burgundy, atchieved this adventure: and the second was, this is\nthe name of Don Bruneo of Bonamar, son to Vallados, Marquis of Troque:\nand his own said, this is Agrayes, son to King Languines of Scotland.\nThis Madanil loved Guinda, Lady of Flanders. Don Bruneo had proved the\nenchantment but eight days ago, and she whom he loved was Melicia,\ndaughter to King Perion, the sister of Amadis.\n\nWhen Agrayes had thus entered, Amadis said to his brethren, will ye\nprove the adventure? No, said they, we are not so enthralled that we\ncan deserve to accomplish it. Since you are two, then, quoth he, keep\none another company, as I, if I can, will do with my cousin Agrayes.\nThen gave he his horse and arms to Gandalin, and went on without fear,\nas one who felt that never in deed or in thought had he been faithless\nto his Lady. When he came under the arch, the Image began a sound far\ndifferent and more melodious than he had ever before done, and showered\ndown flowers of great fragrance from the mouth of the trumpet, the like\nof which had never been done before to any Knight who entered. He past\non to the Images, and here Agrayes, who apprehended something of his\npassion, met him and embraced him, and said, Sir, my Cousin, there is\nno reason that we should henceforth conceal from each other our loves.\nBut Amadis made no reply, but taking his hand, they went to survey the\nbeauties of the garden.\n\nDon Galaor and Florestan, who waited for them without, seeing that they\ntarried, besought Ysanjo, the Governor, to shew them the Forbidden\nChamber, and he led them towards the perrons. Sir brother, said\nFlorestan, what will you do? Nothing, replied Galaor: I have no mind to\nmeddle with enchantments. Then amuse yourself here, quoth Florestan, I\nwill try my fortune. He then commended himself to God, threw his shield\nbefore him, and proceeded sword in hand. When he entered the spell, he\nfelt himself attacked on all sides with lances and swords, such blows\nand so many that it might be thought never man could endure them; yet,\nfor he was strong and of good heart, he ceased not to make his way,\nstriking manfully on all sides, and it felt in his hand as though he\nwere striking armed men, and the sword did not cut. Thus struggling,\nhe passed the copper perron, and advanced as far as the marble one,\nbut there his strength failed him, and he fell like one dead, and was\ncast out beyond the line of the spell. When Galaor saw this he was\ndispleased, and said, however little I like these things, I must take\nmy share in the danger! and bidding the Squires and the Dwarf to stay\nby Florestan, and throw cold water in his face, he took his arms and\ncommended himself to God, and advanced towards the Forbidden Chamber.\nImmediately the unseen blows fell upon him, but he went on, and forced\nhis way up to the marble perron, and there he stood; but, when he\nadvanced another step beyond, the blows came on him so heavy a load,\nthat he fell senseless, and was cast out like Florestan.\n\nAmadis and Agrayes were reading the new inscription in the jasper, This\nis Amadis of Gaul, the true lover, son to King Perion,\u00e2\u0080\u0094when Ardian\nthe Dwarf came up to the line, and cried out, Help! help, Sir Amadis,\nyour brothers are slain! They hastened out to him, and asked how it\nwas.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Sir, they attempted the Forbidden Chamber, and did not atchieve\nit, and there they lie for dead! Immediately they rode towards them,\nand found them so handled as you have heard, albeit some little\nrecovering. Then Agrayes, who was stout of heart, alighted and went on\nas fast as he could to the Forbidden Chamber, striking aright and aleft\nwith his sword, but his strength did not suffice to bear the blows, he\nfell senseless between the perrons, and was cast out as his cousins\nhad been. Then Amadis began to curse their journey thither, and said\nto Galaor, who was now revived, Brother, I must not excuse my body\nfrom the danger which yours have undergone. Galaor would have withheld\nhim, but he took his arms, and went on, praying God to help him. When\nhe came to the line of the spell, there he paused for a moment, and\nsaid, O Oriana, my Lady, from you proceeds all my strength and courage!\nremember me now at this time, when your dear remembrance is so needful\nto me! Then he went on. The blows fell thick upon him and hard till he\nreached the marble perron, but then they came so fast as if all the\nKnights in the world were besetting him, and such an uproar of voices\narose as if the whole world were perishing, and he heard it said, if\nthis Knight should fail, there is not one in the world who can enter.\nBut he ceased not to proceed, winning his way hardly, sometimes beaten\ndown upon his hands, sometimes falling upon his knees; his sword fell\nfrom his hand, and, though it hung by a thong from the wrist, he\ncould not recover it, yet holding on still he reached the door of the\nchamber, and a hand came forth and took him by the hand to draw him in,\nand he heard a voice which said, Welcome is the Knight who shall be\nLord here, because he passeth in prowess him who made the enchantment,\nand who had no peer in his time. The hand that led him was large, and\nhard, like the hand of an old man, and the arm was sleeved with green\nsattin. As soon as he was within the chamber it let go his hold, and\nwas seen no more, and Amadis remained fresh, and with all his strength\nrecovered; he took the shield from his neck and the helmet from his\nhead, and sheathed his sword, and gave thanks to his Lady Oriana for\nthis honour, which for her sake he had won. At this time they of the\ncastle who had heard the voices resign the lordship, and seen Amadis\nenter, began to cry out, God be praised, we see accomplished what we\nhave so long desired. When his brethren saw that he had atchieved that\nwherein they had failed, they were exceedingly joyful, because of the\ngreat love they bore him, and desired that they might be carried to the\nchamber; and there the Governor with all his train went to Amadis, and\nkissed his hand as their Lord. Then saw they the wonders which were\nin the chamber, the works of art and the treasures, such that they\nwere amazed to see them. Yet all this was nothing to the chamber of\nApolidon and Grimanesa, for that was such, that not only could no one\nmake the like, but no one could even imagine how it could be made; it\nwas so devised, that they who were within could clearly see what was\ndoing without, but from without nothing could be seen within. There\nthey remained some time with great pleasure; the Knights, because one\nof their lineage was found to exceed in worth all living men, and all\nwho for a hundred years had lived: the islanders, because they trusted\nto be well ruled and made happy under such a Lord, and even to master\nother lands. Sir, quoth Ysanjo, it is time to take food and rest for\nto-day: to-morrow, the good men of the land will come and do homage to\nyou. So that day they feasted in the palace, and the following day all\nthe people assembled and did homage to Amadis as their Lord, with great\nsolemnities and feasting and rejoicing.[101:A]\n\n    [101:A] The Spanish Writer moralizes here a little upon the\n    mutability of fortune.\n\nYou have heard in the first part of this great history, how Oriana\nwas moved to great anger and rage by what the Dwarf had said to her\nconcerning the broken sword, so that neither the wise counsels of\nMabilia nor of the Damsel of Denmark aught availed her. From that time\nshe gave way to her wrath, so that wholly changing her accustomed\nmanner of life, which was to be altogether in their company, she now\nforsook them, and for the most part chose to be alone, devising how she\nmight revenge herself for what she suffered, upon him who had caused\nher sufferings. So recollecting that she could by writing make him\nsensible of her displeasure, even at a distance, being alone in her\nchamber, she took ink and parchment from her coffer, and wrote thus:\n\nMy frantic grief, accompanied by so great a reason, causes my weak hand\nto declare what my sad heart cannot conceal against you, the false and\ndisloyal Knight, Amadis of Gaul; for the disloyalty and faithlessness\nare known which you have committed against me, the most ill-fortuned\nand unhappy of all in the world, since you have changed your affection\nfor me, who loved you above all things, and have placed your love upon\none who by her years cannot have discretion to know and love you.\nSince then I have no other vengeance in my power, I withdraw all that\nexceeding and misplaced love which I bore towards you; for great error\nwould it be to love him who has forsaken me, when in requital for my\nsighs and passion I am deceived and deserted. Therefore, as the wrong\nis manifest, never appear before me! for be sure the great love I felt\nis turned into raging anger. Go, and deceive some other poor woman as\nyou deceived me with your treacherous words, for which no excuse will\nbe received, while I lament with tears my own wretchedness, and so put\nan end to my life and unhappiness.\n\nHaving thus written, she sealed the letter with the seal of Amadis, and\nwrote on the superscription, I am the Damsel wounded through the heart\nwith a sword, and you are he who wounded me. She then secretly called a\nSquire, who was named Durin, and was brother to the Damsel of Denmark,\nand bade him not rest till he had reached the kingdom of Sobradisa,\nwhere he would find Amadis; and she bade him mark the countenance of\nAmadis while he was reading the letter, and stay with him that day, but\nreceive no answer from him, if he wished to give one.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER 3._\n\n\nDurin, in obedience to the command of Oriana, presently departed, and\nhasted so well that on the tenth day he arrived at Sobradisa, where\nhe found the new Queen Briolania, whom he thought the fairest woman,\nexcept Oriana, that ever he had seen; and learning from her that Amadis\nhad departed two days before, he followed him, and reached the Firm\nIsland just as Amadis was passing under the Arch of True Lovers, and so\nhe beheld how the Image did more for him than ever it had done for any\nother. And though he saw Amadis after he came forth to his brethren,\nyet he did not speak with him, nor give him the letter, till after he\nhad entered the Forbidden Chamber, and been received by all as Lord of\nthe island. This he did by Gandalin's advice, who, knowing the letter\nto be from Oriana, feared that it might cause his Master either to\nforslow or fail in the atchieving of so great an enterprise, for he\nwould not only have left off the conquest of the Firm Island, but also\nof the whole world, to fulfil what she had commanded; but, when every\nthing was finished, Durin went before him, and Amadis took him apart\nfrom his brethren and from all others into a garden, and asked him if\nhe came from the court of King Lisuarte, and what tidings. Sir, said\nhe, the court is as when you left it: I come from thence by the command\nof my Lady Oriana; by this letter you will know the cause of my coming.\nAmadis took the letter, and he concealed the joy that was in his heart,\nthat Durin might know nothing of his secret; but his grief he could not\nconceal when he had read those strong and bitter words, for neither his\ncourage nor reason could support him then, for he seemed struck with\ndeath. When Durin saw him so disordered, he cursed himself and his ill\nfortune, and death, that had not overtaken him on the way. Amadis, for\nhe could not stand, sate down upon the grass, and took the letter which\nhad fallen from his hands, and, when he saw the superscription, again\nhis grief became so violent that Durin would have called his brethren,\nbut feared to do so, observing what secrecy Amadis had chosen.\nPresently Amadis exclaimed, O Lord, wherefore does it please thee that\nI should perish, not having deserved it! and then again, Ah, truth, an\nill guerdon dost thou give him who never failed thee! Then he took the\nletter again, saying, you are the cause of my unhappy end; come here,\nthat it may be sooner! and he placed it in his bosom. He asked Durin\nif he had aught else to say; and hearing that he had not, replied,\nwell then thou shalt take my answer. Sir, quoth he, I am forbidden\nto receive any.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Did neither Mabilia nor thy sister bid thee say any\nthing?\u00e2\u0080\u0094They knew not my coming: my Lady commanded me to conceal it from\nthem.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Holy Mary help me! I see now my wretchedness is without remedy.\nHe then went to a stream that proceeded from a fountain, and washed\nhis face and eyes, and bade Durin call Gandalin, and bid him bring\nYsanjo the Governor; and he said to the Governor, promise me, as you\nare a loyal Knight, to keep secret all that you shall see till after\nmy brothers have heard mass to-morrow; and the same promise he exacted\nfrom the two Squires. Then he commanded Ysanjo to open privately the\ngate of the castle, and Gandalin to take his horse and arms out,\nprivately also. This done they left him, and he remained alone,\nthinking upon a dream which he had dreamt the last night, wherein it\nseemed, that being armed and on horseback he was on a hill covered with\ntrees, and many persons round about him making great joy; when a man\nfrom amongst them presented him a box, saying, Sir, taste what I bring\nyou; which he did, and it was exceeding bitter; and therewith feeling\nhimself cast down and disconsolate, he loosed the reins of his horse,\nand let him go whither he would; and he thought that the mirth of all\naround him was changed into such sorrow as was pitiful to behold; but\nhis horse carried him far away from them, and took him through the\ntrees to a rocky place surrounded with water; and then it seemed in his\ndream that he left his horse and arms, as if by that he would have had\nrest, and there came to him an old man in a religious habit, and took\nhim by the hand as if he had compassion, and spoke to him in a language\nwhich he did not understand, whereupon he awoke. Upon this dream Amadis\nnow mused, thinking that he now found it true.\n\nThen hiding his face from his brethren, that they might not see his\ntrouble, he went to the castle-gate, which the sons of Ysanjo had\nopened. Come you with me, said Amadis to the Governor, and let your\nsons remain here, and keep this matter secret. So they went to the\nfoot of the rock, where there was a little chapel, and Gandalin and\nDurin went with them. There he armed himself, and asked the Governor\nto what saint that chapel was dedicated.\u00e2\u0080\u0094To our Lady the Virgin, who\nhath wrought many miracles here. Hearing this, Amadis went in and\nknelt down, and said, weeping, Our Lady Virgin Mary, the consoler and\nhelper of those that are afflicted, I beseech you to intercede with\nyour glorious Son, that he may have mercy on me; and, if it be your\nwill not to help me in my body, have mercy on my soul in these my\nlast days, for other thing than death I do not hope. He then called\nYsanjo, and said, promise as a loyal Knight to do what I shall direct!\nand turning to Gandalin, he took him in his arms and wept abundantly,\nand held him somewhile, for he could not speak. At length he said, my\ngood friend Gandalin, you and I were nursed by the same milk, and our\nlives have been past together, and never have I endured hardship and\ndanger in which you had not your part also. Your father took me from\nthe sea when I was so little, being only that night's child, and they\nbrought me up as a good father and mother bring up their beloved son;\nand you, my true friend, have always thought how to serve me, and I\nhave hoped in God that he would one day enable me to requite thee;\nbut now this misery, which is worse than death, is come upon me, and\nwe must part, and I have nothing to leave thee, except this island: I\ntherefore command Ysanjo and all others, by the homage which they have\ndone to me, that so soon as they shall know my death they take thee for\ntheir Lord. The Lordship shall be thine, but I enjoin that thy father\nand mother enjoy it while they live, and afterwards it shall remain\nto thee. This I do for what they did for my childhood, for my ill\nfortune will not suffer me to do what they deserve, and what I desire.\nHe then told Ysanjo to take from the rents of the island, which had\naccumulated, enough to build a monastery by that chapel, in honour of\nthe Virgin Mary, and to endow it for thirty friars. But Gandalin cried\nout, Sir, you never yet had trouble wherein I was separated from you,\nnor shall it be now; and if you die, I do not wish to live: and I want\nno honours or lordships; give it to your brethren, I will not take it,\nand I do not want it. Hold thy peace, for God's sake, quoth Amadis, and\nsay no such folly to displease me. My brethren are of such worth that\nthey can gain lands for themselves, and to bestow on others. Then he\nsaid to Ysanjo, it grieves me, my friend Ysanjo, to leave you before\nI could honour you according to your deserts; but I leave you with\nthose who will do it. Ysanjo answered, let me go with you, Sir, and\nsuffer what you suffer. Friend, answered Amadis, it must be as I say;\nGod only can comfort me! I will be guided by his mercy, and have no\nother company. He then said to Gandalin, if thou desirest knighthood,\ntake my arms; for, since thou hast kept them so well, it is right they\nshould be thine. I shall little need them: if not, my brother Galaor\nshall knight thee. Tell him this Ysanjo, and serve and love him as thou\nhast me, for I love him above all my lineage, because he is the best,\nand hath ever been humble towards me. Tell him, too, that I commit\nArdian the Dwarf to his care. They for great sorrow could make him no\nanswer. Then Amadis embraced them, and commended them to God, saying\nthat he never thought to see them more, and he forbade them to follow\nhim; and with that spurred his horse and rode away, forgetting to take\neither shield, or helmet, or spear. He struck into the mountain, going\nwhither his horse would. Thus he kept till midnight, being utterly\nlost in thought; the horse came then to a little stream of water,\nand proceeded upward to find a place so deep that he could drink\nthereat. The branches struck Amadis in the face, and so recalled him\nto himself, and he looked round, and seeing nothing but thickets,\nrejoiced, thinking that he was hidden in that solitude. So he alighted,\nand fastened his horse to a tree, and sate upon the green herb by, and\nwept till his head became giddy, and he fell asleep.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER 4._\n\n\nGandalin and his companions remained by the chapel, looking after\nAmadis as he rode so fast away: then Gandalin, who was passionately\nweeping, cried out, I will follow and carry his arms to him, although\nhe hath forbidden me! And I, quoth Durin, will bear you company for\nthis night. So they left Ysanjo, and getting to horse, rode after him,\ncoasting here and there about the wood, till fortune brought them so\nnear the place where he was lying, that his horse scented theirs, and\nbegan to neigh. Then they knew that he was near, and Gandalin alighted,\nand went quietly through the shrubs till he saw his Master sleeping by\nthe fountain. The Squire then took his horse and led it where he had\nleft Durin, and taking off the bridles from all the horses that they\nmight browze the green boughs, they remained still. It was not long\nbefore Amadis awoke, for his sleep was restless: he rose, and looked\nround: the Moon was almost down, but it was yet some time till day;\nthen he lay down again, and broke out into pitiful lamentations for his\nevil fortune.\n\nThe two Squires heard all he said and were greatly moved thereat, yet\ndurst they not appear before him. Presently there came up a Knight\nsinging along the way, and, when he was near the place where Amadis\nlay, he exclaimed, Love, love, I thank thee for exalting me above all\nother Knights! giving me good first, and better afterwards. You made\nme affect the fair Queen Sardamira, thinking to secure her heart by\nthe honour which I should bear away from this land; and now, for my\ngreater happiness, you make me love the daughter of the greatest King\nin the world, the fair Oriana, who hath no peer on earth: you make\nme love her, and you give me strength to serve her. Saying this, he\ndrew from the wayside to a great tree, whereunder he meant to wait for\nday-break. Then said Gandalin to his comrade, stay here while I go see\nwhat Amadis will do. He went towards the fountain, but Amadis had risen\nand was seeking his horse; and seeing Gandalin dimly in the night, he\ncried out, who goes there? tell me, I beseech thee?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Gandalin, Sir!\nwho is going to bring you your horse.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Who bade thee follow me against\nmy command? you have displeased me: give me my horse and go thy way,\nand tarry not here, unless thou wouldst have me slay thee and myself.\nSir, cried Gandalin, for God's sake no more of this! did you hear the\nfoolish words of a Knight hard by? And this he said to make him angry,\nthat he might forget his displeasure for a while. Amadis answered, I\nheard him, and therefore want my horse to depart.\u00e2\u0080\u0094How! is this all you\nwill do?\u00e2\u0080\u0094What wouldst thou more?\u00e2\u0080\u0094That you should fight with him, and\nmake him know his folly.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Fool that thou art! I have neither heart,\nnor strength, nor spirit! having lost all in losing her from whom all\ncame: she gave me courage, and hath taken it away: the most caitiff\nKnight in Great Britain might slay me now. Sir, said Gandalin, for\nGod's sake speak lower, that Durin may not hear this, for he has heard\nall that the Knight said.\u00e2\u0080\u0094What! is Durin here?\u00e2\u0080\u0094We came together: I\nthink he tarries to see what you will do, that he may report it to her\nwho sent him. I am vexed at what you tell me, quoth Amadis; but his\nspirit arose, knowing that Durin was there, and he said, give me my\nhorse then, and guide me to the Knight. He mounted and took his arms,\nand Gandalin led him where the Knight sate under a tree, holding his\nhorse by the bridle. You Sir Knight, quoth Amadis, who are enjoying\nyourself, rise, and let us see if you can maintain the love of which\nyou boast. The Knight arose, and cried, who are you who question me?\nyou shall see how I maintain it, if you dare do battle with me, for I\nwill strike terror into thee, and all who are scorned by Love. I am\none of those, quoth Amadis: Love hath foully requited me: I tell thee\nthis, Sir Lover, where I have found one truth in him, I have found\nseven lies. Come, and maintain his justice: let us see if he has gained\nmore in you than he has lost in me! and, as he spake these words, his\nanger kindled, feeling how unjustly his Lady had abandoned him. The\nKnight mounted and took his arms, and said, You Knight, whom Love has\njustly forsaken, because you were not worthy to serve him, get you\ngone! I am offended even at the sight of you. And he would have rode\naway, but Amadis cried out, What, Knight! do you defend your love only\nwith words, and ride off like a coward? How! quoth he: I was leaving\nthee for contempt, and thou callest it fear! thou art very desirous\nof thy own hurt: defend thyself now if thou canst! They ran against\neach other, and both shields were pierced, but the Knight was thrown\ndown: he kept the reins, and mounted again lightly. Quoth Amadis, If\nyou do not defend Love better with the sword than with the lance, you\nwill be a bad champion. The Knight made no reply, but struck at him in\ngreat fury: the sword fell on the rim of the shield, and entered in\naslant, and he could not pluck it out. Amadis stood in his stirrups,\nand gave him a blow on his head, and cut away the trappings of his\nhelmet and the skin of his head, and the sword held on and came upon\nthe neck of the horse, so that he fell dead, and the rider senseless.\nAmadis waited a minute, thinking that he had slain him; then seeing\nhim recover, he said, Knight, what Love has gained in you, and you in\nhim, you may both enjoy: I leave you. So departing from him, he called\nGandalin, and seeing Durin there, he said to him, friend Durin, my\nsorrow hath no equal, and my grief and recollections are intolerable:\nit is better that I should die: pray God it may be soon! Go, with\ngood fortune! Salute for me, Mabilia, my good cousin, and the Damsel\nof Denmark, thy sister; and tell them, if they grieve for me, that I\nperish more undeservedly than ever Knight perished; and tell them that\nI sorely regret that those who have loved me so much, and done so much\nfor me, have never had their guerdon! Durin stood weeping before him,\nand could make no reply. Amadis embraced him, and he commended him to\nGod, and kissed the skirts of his armour and departed. By this it was\nday-break: Amadis said to Gandalin, if you chuse to go with me, attempt\nnot to disturb me in whatever I say or do: if you will not obey this,\ngo back. He promised obedience. Then Amadis gave him his arms, and bade\nhim pluck the sword from the shield and give it the Knight, and so they\nrode on.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER 5._\n\n\nThis wounded Knight was Patin, brother to Don Sidon, who was then\nEmperor of Rome; he was the best Knight in all those lands; and\ntherefore greatly feared throughout the empire. The Emperor was very\nold, and had no son, therefore all thought this brother should succeed\nhim. He loved Sardamira, Queen of Sardinia, who was a fair and comely\nDamsel, and being niece to the Empress had been brought up in the\ncourt; and he had so far profited by his service, that she had promised\nhim, if ever she married, to marry him. El[119:A] Patin upon this grew\nmore presumptuous, though his natural arrogance was enough; and he\nsaid to her, I have heard that King Lisuarte hath a daughter who is\nrenowned over all the world for her beauty. I will go to his court,\nand say she is not so fair as you, and this I will maintain against\nthe two best Knights who dare undertake her cause. They say there are\nKnights there of great worth in arms, but if I do not conquer them in\none day, I will that King Lisuarte do cause my head to be cut off! The\nQueen answered him, do not do this; for, if that Princess be fair, it\nimpaireth not the beauty which God hath bestowed upon me, if beauty\nthere be; and, methinks, you might with more reason and less pride\nprove your prowess in some other cause, for this enterprize is not\nbecoming a man of so high a rank, and moreover it is unreasonable and\narrogant, and you cannot expect it to come to a good end. Come what\nwill, quoth he, I will do it, to prove that you, who are the fairest\nLady in the world, have the best Knight for your servant. So he took\nhis leave, and with rich arms and ten Squires passed over into Great\nBritain, and went directly to where King Lisuarte was, who seeing him\nso accompanied thought him to be some great personage, and courteously\nwelcomed him. When he was disarmed, all that saw his great stature\njudged him to be of great courage. Lisuarte then asked him who he was.\nHe answered, King, I will tell you, for I do not come to your house\nto conceal myself, but to make myself known. Know, then, that I am El\nPatin, brother to the Emperor of Rome, and so soon as I see the Queen,\nand your daughter Oriana, you shall know the cause of my coming. When\nthe King heard that he was a man of so high rank, he embraced him\nand said, Good friend, much are we pleased with your coming, and you\nshall see the Queen and her daughter and all others of my house, when\nit pleaseth you. Then he placed him at his own table, and they were\nfeasted in a manner befitting the table of such a personage. El Patin\nlooked round him, and when he saw so many Knights he was astonished,\nand began to hold the household of his brother, the Emperor, as\nnothing. Don Grumedan took him to his lodging, by the King's command,\nand did him much honour. The next day after mass, the King took with\nhim El Patin and Don Grumedan, and went to the Queen, who received\nhim honourably, and made him sit before her and near her daughter.\nNow Oriana's beauty was much impaired by reason of her great trouble\nof mind, yet when El Patin saw her he marvelled greatly, and thought\nthat they who praised her had not mentioned half her beauty, and his\nheart was entirely changed from the purpose with which he had come,\nand wholly bent to obtain her. Wherefore calling to mind his own high\nbirth and great qualities, and moreover that he should one day possess\nthe empire, he thought that if he demanded her in marriage she would\nnot be refused him. So taking the King and Queen apart, he said, I come\nhither to request the marriage of your daughter, for your worth and for\nher beauty: if I sought others of her rank, I could obtain them, seeing\nwhat I am, and what I expect to be. The King answered, we thank you\nmuch for what you say, but the Queen and I have promised our daughter\nnot to give her in marriage against her consent: we must talk with her,\nbefore we can answer you. This the King said that he might not offend\nhim, but in his mind he was resolved not to give her to him, or to any\nother who would carry her out of the land which she was to inherit.\nEl Patin was satisfied with this, and waited five days, expecting a\nfavourable answer; but the King and Queen, thinking it folly, had said\nnothing to Oriana. Then El Patin asked the King how the business went\non. He answered, I do what I can, but it is necessary that you should\nspeak to my daughter, and request her to obey my commands. El Patin\nwent to the Princess, and said, Lady Oriana, I wish to ask a thing of\nyou which will be much to your honour and profit. What thing is that?\nquoth she.\u00e2\u0080\u0094That you will do the will of your father. She knowing not\nfor what reason he spake, replied, that shall I right willingly, being\nsure it will be as you say. Then Patin was full joyful, thinking he\nhad won her, and said, I will go through this land seeking adventures;\nbefore long you will hear such things of me, as will make you with more\nreason grant what I require. And this also he said to the King, telling\nhim that he would see the wonders of his land. The King replied, you\nhave it in you to do this; yet would I dissuade you, for in this land\nyou will find many great and perilous adventures, and many strong and\nhardy Knights, practised in arms. I like this, quoth El Patin: if they\nare strong and hardy, I am neither weak nor faint, as my deeds shall\nshow. So he departed, right joyful at Oriana's answer, and for this joy\nhe was singing as you have heard, when his ill fortune led him where\nAmadis was making moan; and this is the reason why that Knight came\nfrom so far a land.\n\n    [119:A] The article is uniformly prefixed to his name, except\n    where he is first mentioned. In our language it is only\n    used where the name is a family or clan appellation: The\n    Plantagenet, the Douglas, the Graham.\n\nDurin departed from Amadis when it was clear day-light, and he passed\nby El Patin, who had taken off the piece of his helmet that was left,\nand had his face and neck all bloody. He seeing Durin, said to him,\nGood child, so may God make you a good man as you tell me if there\nbe any place near where I may have remedy for my wound. Yes, quoth\nhe, but all there are so afflicted that they will hardly attend to\nyou.\u00e2\u0080\u0094For what cause?\u00e2\u0080\u0094For the loss of a good Knight, who hath won that\nlordship, and seen the likenesses and secrets of Apolidon, which none\nother could ever do, and he is departed in such sorrow that nothing\nbut his death is looked for.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Methinks you speak of the Firm Island?\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\ndo.\u00e2\u0080\u0094What! hath it found a a master? certes I am heartily sorry, for I\nwas going there myself to prove the adventure and win the Island. Durin\nlaughed, and answered, Truly, Sir Knight, if there be no more prowess\nin you than you have just now manifested, you would have gained little\nhonour! El Patin raised himself as well as he could, and tried to catch\nhis bridle, but Durin turned aside. Tell me, said he, what Knight is\nhe that hath won the Firm Island?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Tell me first who you are?\u00e2\u0080\u0094I am El\nPatin, brother to the Emperor of Rome.\u00e2\u0080\u0094God-a-mercy! quoth Durin, your\nbirth is better than your prowess or your courtesy. Know that the\nKnight you ask about is the same who hath just now left you: by what\nyou have seen you may judge that he is worthy of what he hath won. So\nhe went his way, and took the straight road to London, greatly desirous\nto tell Oriana all that he had seen of Amadis.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER 6._\n\n\nYsanjo, according to his promise, revealed nothing concerning Amadis\ntill after mass the next day. Then, when his brethren and his cousin\nenquired for him, he said, arm yourselves, and I will tell you his\ncommands. And, when they were armed, Ysanjo began to weep passionately,\nand exclaimed, O Sirs, what a grief and a misery is come upon us, that\nwe should lose our Lord so soon! Then he told them all that Amadis had\nsaid, and how he besought that they would not seek him, for they could\nnot help his ill, and that they should not grieve for his death. Holy\nMary! cried they, the best Knight in the world is about to perish! but\nwe will seek him, and, if we cannot with our lives help him, we will\nbear him company with our deaths. Ysanjo then told Galaor his brother's\nrequest that he would make Gandalin a Knight, and take the Dwarf into\nhis service: this he delivered weeping, and they weeping also heard\nit. The Dwarf for pure grief was beating his head against a wall; but\nGalaor caught him up and said, Ardian come with me, since thy Master\nhas so commanded, and my lot shall be yours. The Dwarf answered, Sir,\nI will follow you, but not as my Master, till we know some certain\ntidings of Amadis. Forthwith they went to horse, and all three hastened\nalong the road which Ysanjo pointed. All day they rode on, meeting\nno one of whom they could ask tidings, till they came where El Patin\nlay wounded beside his dead horse: his Squires had found him, and\nwere cutting down boughs and poles to make him a litter, for he was\nexceeding faint with loss of blood, so that he could not answer them,\nbut made sign that they should speak to his Squires, and they replied,\nthat their Lord had sped so ill in an encounter with the Knight who had\nwon the Firm Island. Good Squires, know you which way he went?\u00e2\u0080\u0094No; but\nbefore we came up to this place we met an armed Knight in the forest,\nupon a stout horse, and he was weeping and accusing his fortune: a\nSquire behind him carried his arms; the shield had two lions azure in a\nfield or., and the Squire was lamenting also. That is he! cried they;\nand they pushed on with great speed till they came out of the forest\nupon a great plain, where there were many roads in every direction,\nso that they knew not which way to take; therefore they agreed to\nseparate, and meet at the court of Lisuarte upon St. John's day, that\nif by then they had been unsuccessful in their search, they might\nconsult anew how to find him. There then they embraced and separated,\neach earnestly bent on his quest, but in vain; for, when Amadis reached\nthe open country, he took none of those roads, but struck aside along a\nglen, and thence made into the mountain.\n\nHe rode on lost in thought, suffering his horse to chuse the\npath. About noon the horse came to some trees that grew beside a\nmountain-stream, and then stopt, being weary with the heat and with the\ntoil of last night. Here Amadis recollected himself and looked round,\nand was pleased to see no signs of a habitation: he alighted and drank\nof the brook. Gandalin came up, and turning the horses to feed came\nto his Master, whom he found more dead than alive; and, not daring to\ndisturb him, he lay down before him. Amadis continued in this mood\ntill sunset, then rising, he struck his foot against Gandalin: art\nthou sleeping? quoth he. No, replied Gandalin, but I am thinking upon\ntwo things which concern you, the which, if it please you to hear, I\nwill speak: if not, I will be silent. Amadis answered, go saddle the\nhorses, and let us begone: I do not chuse to be found by those who seek\nme. Sir, said Gandalin, you are in a solitary place, and your horse is\nso weary that, unless you allow him some rest, he cannot carry you.\nAmadis replied, weeping, do what you think best: whether I stay or go,\nthere is no rest for me! Then Gandalin looked after the horses, and\nreturned to his Master, and begged him to eat of a pasty which he had\nbrought, but he would not. Sir, said he, shall I say the two things\nwhereon I have been thinking? Say what you will, quoth Amadis; I care\nnothing now for any thing that may be said or done, and wish to live no\nlonger than till I can confess.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Then I pray you hear me, Sir: I have\nthought much upon that letter which Oriana sent you, and upon the words\nof the Knight with whom you fought; and seeing how light is the faith\nof many women, it may be that she hath changed her affections, and so\nhas feigned anger against you, before you discover it. The other thing\nis, that I believe her to be so good and loyal that she could not have\nbeen thus moved, unless some great falsehood had been spoken of you,\nwhich she believes and feels in her heart; and, since you know that you\nhave never been false, you should make the truth known, whereby she\nwill repent of what she hath done, and intreat your forgiveness for the\nwrong, and you will enjoy your former happiness. It is better to take\nfood with this hope, than, by abandoning yourself to despair, to die\nand lose her, and the glory of this world, and even the other. Hold thy\npeace, for God's sake! quoth Amadis, for such foolishness and lies as\nthou hast uttered, are enough to provoke the whole world. Oriana, my\nLady, has never done wrong; and, if I perish, it is but reasonable, not\nfor my deserving, but to accomplish her will and command: if I did not\nknow that thou hast said this to comfort me, I would cut off thy head!\nyou have greatly displeased me: never say the like to me again! He then\nturned away in anger, and walked along the side of the stream.\n\nBut Gandalin, who for two days and a night had not slept, was overcome\nwith heaviness, and at length fell asleep. When Amadis saw this, he\nsaddled his horse, and hid Gandalin's saddle and bridle among the\nbushes, that he might not be able to find them; and, taking his arms,\nhe struck into the wildest part of the mountain. All night he went; and\nthe next day till vespers, then he came to a plain at the foot of a\nmountain: there were two high trees there that grew over a fountain,\nand there he went to give his horse drink, for they had found no water\nall that day. When he came up to the fountain, he saw an old man in a\nreligious habit, who was giving his ass water; his beard and hair were\ngrey, and his habit was very poor, being made of goat's hair. Amadis\nsaluted him, and asked him if he was a Priest. The good man answered,\nhe had been one forty years. God be praised! quoth Amadis: I beseech\nyou for the love of God stay here to-night, and hear my confession, of\nwhich I am in great need. In God's name! said the old man. Then Amadis\nalighted, laid his arms upon the ground, and took the saddle from his\nhorse and let him feed; and he disarmed, and knelt before the good\nman, and began to kiss his feet. The good man took him by the hand\nand raised him, and made him sit by him, and, beholding him well, he\nthought him the goodliest Knight that ever he saw, but he was pale,\nand his face and neck were stained with tears, so that the old man\nhad great pity, and said, Sir Knight, it seems that you are in great\naffliction: if it be for any sin that you have committed, and these\ntears spring from repentance, in a happy hour came you here! but if it\nbe for any worldly concerns, from which by your youth and comeliness\nit seems you cannot be removed, remember God, and beseech him of\nhis mercy to bring you to his service. He then raised his hand and\nblessed him, and bade him relate all the sins he could call to mind.\nHereon Amadis began the whole discourse of his life, without letting\nany thing pass. The good man then said, seeing that you are of such\nunderstanding, and of so high a lineage, you ought not to despair and\ncast yourself away for any thing that may befall you, much less for\nthe action of a woman, for they are as easily won as lightly lost. I\ncounsel you to lay aside such folly, for the love of God, to whom it\nis displeasing, and even for worldly reason, for man ought not to love\nwhere he is not beloved. Good Sir, replied Amadis, I am now in such\nextremity that I cannot live any long time: I beseech you, by that God\nwhose faith you hold, take me with you for the little while I have to\nlive, that I may have comfort for my soul. My horse and arms I need no\nlonger: I will leave them here, and go with you on foot, and perform\nwhatever penitence you enjoin. If you refuse, you will sin before God,\nfor else I shall wander and perish in this mountain. When the good man\nsaw him thus resolute, he said to him, with a heart wholly bent to his\ngood, Certes, Sir, it becomes not a Knight like you to abandon himself\nas if he had lost the whole world, by reason of a woman: their love\nis no longer than while they see you with their eyes, and hear such\nwords as you say to them, and that past, presently they forget you;\nespecially in those false loves that are begun against the Lord: the\nsame sin which makes them sweet at first, gives them a bitterness in\nthe end, as you experience. But you who are of such prowess, and have\nsuch power, you who are the true and loyal protector of such as are\noppressed, great wrong would it be to the world if you thus forsake\nit. I know not what she is who hath brought you to this extremity, but\nif all the worth and beauty of the sex were brought together in one,\nI know that such a man as you ought not to be lost for her. Good Sir,\nquoth Amadis, I ask not your counsel upon this, where it is not wanted;\nbut, for my soul's sake, I pray you take me in your company, for else I\nshall have no remedy, but to die in this mountain. The old man hearing\nthis, had such compassion on him that the tears fell down his long\nwhite beard. Sir, my son, said he, I live in a dreary place, and a\nhard life; my hermitage is full seven leagues out at sea, upon a high\nrock, to which no ship can come except in summer time. I have lived\nthere these thirty years, and he who lives there must renounce all the\npleasures and delights of the world, and all my support is the alms\nwhich the people of the land here bestow upon me. I promise you, said\nAmadis, this is the life I desire for the little while I shall live,\nand I beseech you, for the love of God, let me go with you. The good\nman, albeit against his will, consented; and Amadis said, now, Father,\ncommand me what to do, and I will be obedient. The good man gave him\nhis blessing, and said vespers, and then taking bread and fish from\nhis wallet, he bade Amadis eat; but Amadis refused, though he had been\nthree days without tasting food. You are to obey me, said the good man,\nand I command you to eat, else your soul will be in great danger if you\ndie. Then he took a little food; and when it was time to sleep, the old\nman spread his cloak and laid him down thereon, and Amadis laid himself\ndown at his feet.\n\nThe most part of the night Amadis did nothing but turn from side to\nside, but at last being sore wearied he fell asleep, and in that sleep\nhe dreamt that he was fastened in a dark chamber, where there was\nno light at all, neither could he find any way to come out thereof,\nwhereat he greatly lamented; then he thought that his cousin Mabilia\nand the Damsel of Denmark came to him, and there was a sun-beam before\nthem which dispelled the darkness, and they took him by the hand,\nsaying, Come forth, Sir, to this great palace. And he thought that he\nwas right joyful; and going out he saw his Lady Oriana surrounded with\na great flame of fire, whereat he cried out, Holy Mary, help her! and\nran through the fire to save her, feeling no hurt, and took her in her\narms and carried her into a garden, the greenest and pleasantest that\never he had seen. At the loud cry which he made the good man awoke, and\ntook him by the hand, asking him what he ailed? Sir, said he, I felt\nsuch pain in my sleep that I was almost dead. So it seemed by your cry,\nsaid the old man, but it is time to set out; then he got upon his ass.\nAmadis would have walked by him, but the good man with great entreaty\nmade him mount his horse, and so they fared on together.\n\nAs they went, Amadis besought him to grant one boon, which should be\nno-ways hurtful, the which the old man granted. I pray you then, said\nAmadis, that so long as we are together you will not tell any man who\nI am, nor any thing concerning me, and that you will call me by some\nother name, not my own; and, when I am dead, you tell my brethren of\nme, that they may take my body into their country. Your life and\ndeath, said the good man, are in the hands of God, so talk no more\nof this, he will help you if you know and love and serve him as you\nought; but tell me, by what name will you be called?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Even by whatever\nit shall please you.\u00e2\u0080\u0094So the old man, seeing how fair he was, and in\nhow forlorn a condition, replied, I will give you a name conformable\nto your appearance and distress, you shall be called Beltenebros.\nNow Beltenebros being interpreted, signifyeth, the Fair Forlorn. The\nname pleased Amadis, and he admired the good sense of the old man\nin chusing it; so by this name he was long known, till it became as\nrenowned as that of Amadis. Thus communing they reached the sea-side\njust as the night closed in; there they found a bark, wherein the good\nman might cross to his hermitage. Beltenebros gave his horse to the\nmariners, and they gave him in exchange a cloak of goat skin, and a\ngarment of coarse grey woollen. They embarked, and Beltenebros asked\nthe good man what was his own name, and the name of his abode. They\ncall my dwelling-place, said he, the Poor Rock, because none can live\nthere without enduring great poverty: my own name is Andalod. I was\na clerk of some learning, and spent my youth in many vanities, till\nit pleased God to awaken me, and then I withdrew to this solitary\nabode: for thirty years I have never left it, till now that I went to\nthe burial of my sister. At length they reached the Rock and landed,\nand the mariners returned to the main land. Thus Amadis, now called\nBeltenebros, remained on the Poor Rock, partaking the austerities of\nthe hermit, not for devotion, but for despair, forgetful of his great\nrenown in arms, and hoping and expecting death,\u00e2\u0080\u0094all for the anger of a\nwoman!\n\nWhen Gandalin awoke in the mountain, he looked round him, and seeing\nonly his own horse, started up, misdoubting what had happened; he\ncalled aloud, and searched among the shrubs in vain, he could find\nneither Amadis nor his horse. Then, knowing that Amadis was departed,\nhe turned to his horse to ride after him, but the saddle and bridle\nwere gone! upon that he cursed himself and his evil fortune, and the\nday wherein he was born, going from one place to another, till at\nlength he espied the harness, and immediately set out on pursuit.\nFive days he rode on, sleeping in desert places, enquiring at every\nhabitation for his Master. On the sixth, chance led him to the fountain\nwhere Amadis had left his armour. Here he beheld a tent, in which were\ntwo Damsels: he alighted, and asked them if they had seen a Knight who\nbore two lions azure in a golden field. They answered that they had not\nseen him, but such a shield and the whole harness of a Knight, they\nhad found beside that fountain. When Gandalin heard this, he tore his\nhair, and exclaimed, Holy Mary, help me! my Master, the best Knight in\nthe world, is dead or lost! how badly have I served you, my Lord! and\nnow with reason ought I to be hated by all men, and the earth ought\nnot to suffer me upon her, since I have left you at such a time! You\nwere he who succoured all, and now all have forsaken you! the world and\nall in it have abandoned you! and I, caitiff wretch, and more wretched\nthan all that ever were born, have left you in your death! And with\nthat, for excess of passion, he fell down. The Damsels shrieked out,\nHoly Mary, help! the Squire is dead! and they ran to him, and flung\nwater in his face, but it was long before they could recal him to his\nsenses. Good Squire, they cried, be not desperate for a thing which\nis not certain: you had better seek him till you learn whether he be\nalive or dead: good men ought to bear up against sorrow, not to die in\ndespair. Gandalin took heart at their words, and resolved to seek his\nMaster as long as he lived. Ladies, said he, where did you see these\narms?\u00e2\u0080\u0094We will tell you willingly: we were in the company of Don Guilan\nthe Pensive, who delivered us and twenty other Knights and Damsels\nfrom the prison of Gandinos the ruffian, behaving himself there so\nvaliantly that he hath destroyed the wicked customs of the castle, and\nconstrained the Lord thereof to swear never more to maintain the same.\nWe came with Guilan to this fountain four days ago, and when he saw the\nshield for which you enquired, he was very sorrowful, and alighting,\nsaid, the shield of the best Knight in the world should not lie thus!\nand with that, weeping sorely, he hung the shield upon this tree, and\nbade us keep it while he rode to seek him whose it was. We set up our\ntents here, and Guilan sought for him three days without success:\nyesterday he returned, and this morning, giving his own arms to his\nSquires, he girded on the sword and took the shield, saying, By God,\nshield, thou makest a bad exchange, in losing thy master to go with me!\nHe told us, he would carry the arms to Queen Brisena. We also, and all\nwho were delivered by him, are going to that court, to beg the Queen of\nher goodness to recompense Don Guilan, as the Knights will beseech the\nKing. Then God be with you! quoth Gandalin. I shall take your advice;\nand, as the most caitiff and unhappy wretch in the world, go seek for\nhim upon whom my life or death depends.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER 7._\n\n\nOn the tenth day after he had left Amadis in the forest, Durin reached\nLondon, and, alighting at his own lodging, went straight to the Queen's\npalace. So soon as Oriana saw him, her heart throbbed violently, so\nthat she could not calm it, and she went into her chamber and lay down\nupon the bed, bidding the Damsel of Denmark go for her brother, and\nbring him to her secretly. The Damsel returned with Durin, and leaving\nhim with her mistress, went out to Mabilia. Now, friend, said Oriana,\ntell me where you have been, and where you found Amadis, and what he\ndid when he read my letter, and if you have seen Queen Briolania:\ntell me every thing. Then Durin related how he had followed Amadis\nfrom Sobradisa to the Firm Island, and arrived there just as Amadis\nwas passing under the Arch of True Lovers, under the which none might\npass that had been false to his first love. How, cried she, dared\nhe prove that adventure, knowing that he could not accomplish it? It\ndid not turn out so, replied the Squire; he accomplished it with more\nloyalty than any other had ever there displayed, and was received with\nmore honour, and such signs as had never been seen before. When Oriana\nheard this, her joy was very great, that that which had occasioned her\ngreat anger was thus disproved. He proceeded with his tale, how Amadis\nhad won the Forbidden Chamber. Hold! quoth she, and she lifted up her\nhands and began to pray God that she might one day be in that Chamber\nwith him who had worthily won it. Now, quoth she, tell me what did\nAmadis when you gave him the letter? The tears came into Durin's eyes.\nLady, I advise you not to ask, for you have done the worst cruelty\nand devilry that ever Damsel committed. Holy Mary! cried Oriana,\nwhat art thou saying? I say, repeated Durin, that you have unjustly\ndestroyed the best and truest Knight that ever woman had, or will have\nto the end of the world. Cursed be the hour in which such a thing was\ndevised, and cursed be death that did not take me before I carried\nsuch a message: if I had known what I carried, I would rather have\nslain myself than have appeared before him, for you in sending that\nletter, and I in taking it, have been the cause of his death. Then he\nrelated every thing that had passed, and all that Amadis had said, and\nhow he was gone into the mountain to die. While he was relating these\nthings, all Oriana's anger was gone, and her shame and anguish became\nso intolerable, that when he had ceased she could not utter a word,\nbut remained like one who had lost her senses. Durin, albeit that he\nthought she well deserved this suffering, was yet moved to pity, and he\nwent to Mabilia and his sister, and said to them, go and help Oriana,\nfor, if she hath done wrong, her punishment is come upon her: and he\nwent his way.\n\nThey ran to her, and seeing in what state she was, they fastened the\ndoor of her chamber, and threw water in her face, and brought her to\nherself, and she then began to lament what she had done, and cry out\nfor death. But those true friends sent again for Durin, and learnt from\nhim all that had past, and then began to comfort her, and they made her\nwrite a letter to request his forgiveness, and bid him come with all\nspeed to the castle of Miraflores, there to receive her atonement. This\nletter the Damsel of Denmark would take and search for him, for she\nrefused no trouble or difficulty for the two persons in the world whom\nshe loved best; and, because Amadis in his sorrow had talked so much\nof Gandales, they thought he might be with him; and they agreed, as a\npretext for her going there, that she should carry gifts to the Queen\nof Scotland, and tidings of her daughter Mabilia. Oriana therefore told\nher mother they were about to send the Damsel, and Brisena approving\nthereof, sent also presents from herself. This being settled, the\nDamsel, in company with her brother Durin, and Enil, a nephew of\nGandales, rode to a port called Vegil, which is in that part of Great\nBritain towards Scotland, and embarking there, in seven days they came\nto the town called Poligez, in Scotland. From thence they proceeded to\nthe castle of Gandales; him they met going to the chace, and saluted\nhim; and he, perceiving that the Damsel was of a foreign land by her\nspeech, asked her from whence she came. I am the messenger, quoth she,\nof some Damsels who love you much, and who have sent gifts to the Queen\nof Scotland.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Good Damsel, and who are they?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Oriana, daughter of King\nLisuarte, and Mabilia, whom you know. Then Gandales joyfully bade them\nwelcome, and took them to his castle. As they were conversing, the old\nKnight enquired for his foster son, Amadis. At this the Damsel was\ngrieved, perceiving that he was not there as they had hoped; but, not\nto distress Gandales by the truth, she only answered that he was not\nyet returned from Sobradisa. We thought, said she, that he would first\naccompany his cousin Agrayes here, to see you and the Queen his aunt;\nand I bring letters to him from Queen Brisena and his other friends,\nwhich he would be right glad to receive. This she said, that if Amadis\nwere there in secret, he might be induced to see her. She remained with\nGandales two days, then proceeded to the Queen.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER 8._\n\n\nDon Guilan the Pensive proceeded with the arms toward the court of\nLisuarte. He always carried the shield of Amadis round his neck,\nexcept when he was constrained to fight, and then he took his own. So\nas he rode, two nephews of Arcalaus met him and knew the shield, and\nattempted to force it from him, saying they would take that shield, or\nthe head of him who carried it, to their uncle. When Guilan knew of\nhow bad a race they were, he cared the less for them, and gave them\nboth battle. They were strong Knights, and both younger men than he;\nhe, nevertheless, was a valiant man and tried in arms, so that he slew\none, and drove the other to flight. That evening he took up his lodging\nin the house of a Knight whom he knew, who welcomed him gladly, and\ngave him another lance, for his own was broken in the encounter. He\ncontinued his way till he came to a river called Guinon, which was a\ngreat water, and over it was a wooden-bridge, just so broad that one\nhorseman might come and another go. At one end of the bridge was a\nKnight who wished to pass; he bore a shield vert, with a bend argent,\nwhereby Guilan knew him to be his cousin Ladasin. On the other side\nwas a Knight who kept the passage; he rode a large bay horse, and did\nbear in his shield argent a lion sable: this Knight called out aloud to\nLadasin, You must joust, Knight, if you would pass. Your joust shall\nnot prevent me, quoth Ladasin. They ran at each other upon the bridge,\nand Ladasin and his horse fell into the river. There would Ladasin\nhave perished, by reason of the weight of his arms, and the height\nwhence he had fallen, if by good hap he had not caught the boughs of\nsome willows, by which he got to the bank. Don Guilan ran to his help,\nand with the aid of his Squires got him out of the water. Cousin, said\nhe, you would hardly have been saved without these boughs: all Knights\nshould avoid to joust upon these bridges, for they who keep them have\ntheir horses practised to the place, and rather by that, than by their\nown prowess, win the honour. I would rather turn out of the way and go\nround, if this had not happened to you, but now I must try to revenge\nyou. By this, Ladasin's horse had got upon the opposite bank, and the\nKnight bade his servants lead him to the castle, which was a strong\nand pleasant fortress, built in the river, and the way to it was by a\nbridge of stone. The Knight was ready at the bridge-end. Don Guilan\ngave the shield of Amadis to his Squire, and took his own, and they met\ntogether upon the bridge with a most rude encounter. The Knight was\nunhorsed and fell into the water; Guilan also was dismounted, and his\nhorse went over, but he saved himself by clinging to the planks. The\nKnight got upon Guilan's horse, and so to shore, while Guilan's Squires\ntook the bay courser for their master. Don Guilan presently saw the\nKnight of the bridge shaking off the water, and holding the bridle:\ngive me my horse, said he, and let me depart. How! quoth he, think you\nto escape so lightly with this?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Quoth Guilan, have we not performed the\ncustom? The battle is not yet over, cried the Knight, because we both\nfell: we must decide it with the sword. Perforce must I fight? cried\nGuilan: is not the wrong done already enough, for bridges should be\nfree for every passenger? Will you, nill you, quoth he of the bridge,\nyou shall feel how my sword can cut. He then sprung upon Guilan's\nhorse, without setting his foot in the stirrup, and placed himself\nright in the road. Don Cavalier, tell me, said he, before we fight,\nif thou art of Lisuarte's country or court?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Why ask you?\u00e2\u0080\u0094I wish it\npleased God, that I had King Lisuarte here as I have thee, by my head\nhis reign should be finished. Certes, quoth Guilan, you have now given\nme a good will to fight with thee, which before I had not: I am of his\nhousehold, and, if it be in me, you shall never more do him disservice.\nBefore noon, quoth the Knight, you shall carry my message to him, and\nI will tell you who I am, and what present I will send him: my name\nis Gandalod, son to Barsinan, Lord of Sansuena, he whom King Lisuarte\nslew in London. The presents you shall carry him, are the heads of\nfour of his Knights, whom I hold prisoners in yonder tower: the one is\nGiontes his nephew, and thy own right hand, which I mean to cut off and\ntie round thy neck. Don Guilan laid hand to sword; you have boasting\nenough, if that were all that were needed.\n\nThen began so fierce a battle, that Ladasin and the Squires thought\neven the conqueror could not escape with life; but they were both hardy\nKnights, and their armour of excellent temper, and they knew how to\ndefend themselves. Now when their fight was at the hottest, they heard\nthe winding of a horn from the top of the tower. Gandalod knew not what\nit could mean, and Guilan thought it was a signal for succour to his\nenemy; therefore they both more eagerly bestirred themselves to end the\nbattle. Gandalod grappled with him, and they both fell; then was the\nfight closer and more dangerous, but Guilan had the advantage; it was\nevident that his antagonist waxed weary and weak, and at length, by a\nwell driven blow, Don Guilan lopt off his right arm. He shrieked out,\nand turned to fly to his tower, but Guilan reached him, plucked the\nhelmet from his head, and bade him chuse instant death, or to present\nhimself with his presents, but in another guise, to King Lisuarte.\nI will rather trust his mercy, quoth Gandalod, than be slain here\noutright.\n\nDon Guilan then took horse, and rode with Ladasin towards the tower,\nwhere there was a great uproar. The Knights had broken from their\nprison and seized arms, and one of them it was who wound the horn, and\nnow they had won the castle; the gate was opened, and the servants\nand one Knight came flying out: they called out to Ladasin and Guilan\nto kill those villains, and particularly the Knight: three of the men\nescaped them, but the Knight they took. Then said Guilan to them,\nSirs, I cannot tarry, but my cousin Ladasin shall keep you company; let\nthe castle be kept for me, and do you carry this Knight and Gandalod to\nKing Lisuarte for his judgment. Then he gave his own shield, which was\nmuch battered, to his Squire, and took that of Amadis, and as he hung\nit round his neck the tears came. They knew the shield, and hearing how\nDon Guilan had found it, were sorely troubled, thinking that some great\nmishap had befallen Amadis. So he proceeded to the court, and all that\nsaw the shield crowded round him; and the King said, for God's sake,\nDon Guilan, tell us what you know of Amadis. I know nothing of him,\nSir, quoth he, but how I found the shield I will declare before the\nQueen. So he was taken to the Queen, and he knelt before her weeping,\nand told her how he had found the arms of Amadis, and sought for him\nthree days in vain. Knowing, said he, the value of that good Knight,\nand that it was his desire to employ it till death in your service, I\nhave brought you these arms, in testimony of the duty which I do owe\nboth to you and to him. Let them be placed where all may see them;\nthere may be some among the many strangers who come here, who may know\nsome tidings of their master, and they will be memorials to all who\nfollow arms, that they may take example by his great chivalry. Greatly\nwas the Queen distressed at this, and Lisuarte also, and all the\ncourt; but Oriana could not remain there, and she went to her bed, and\nbitterly reproaching her own folly, wished for death. Albeit Mabilia\ndid somewhat cheer her with a hope that the Damsel of Denmark might\nfind him and repair all.\n\nThe Knight and Damsels whom Don Guilan had released, soon arrived,\nand the two Damsels who had seen Gandalin, and they related what\nlamentation a Squire had made over the arms. Presently after came\nLadasin, and the Knights who led Gandalod prisoner; and when Lisuarte\nheard what cruelties he had purposed, he said to him, here I slew\nthy father for the great treason which he committed against me, and\nhere thou shalt die for that which thou didst purpose to commit. So\nhe commanded him, and the Knight his follower, to be thrown from the\nTower, before which Barsinan had been burnt.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER 9._\n\n\nBeltenebros and the Hermit were one day sitting on the stone-bench\nby the door of their chapel, when the old man said, I pray you, son,\ntell me what it was that made you cry out so in your sleep, when we\nwere by the fountain of the plain? That shall I willingly, father, he\nreplied, and I beseech you tell me what you understand by it. Then he\nrelated to him the manner of his dream, only the names of the women,\nthose he did not tell. The good man mused for a while, and then said,\nwith a cheerful countenance, Beltenebros, you have given me great\npleasure by this account, and you also have great reason to rejoice.\nThe dark chamber, in the which you thought yourself to be, and from\nwhence you could not get out, signifieth this great tribulation which\nyou now endure. The Damsels who opened the door, are those friends\nwho continually solicit your cause with her whom you love so much,\nand they will succeed so well as to withdraw you from this place. The\nsun-beam which went before them, is the joyful news that they are to\nsend you here; and the fire, wherein you saw your Lady enveloped, is\nthe great pain of love which she suffers for you as well as you for\nher: from that fire you delivered her, that is, from the pain which\nyour presence will remove; and the pleasant garden is a sign of great\nhappiness, wherewith you shall pass your lives. Truly, I know a man of\nmy habit should not discourse of such things as these, yet it is more\nfor God's service to speak the truth that may comfort you, than to\nconceal it, seeing your desperate state.\n\nBeltenebros knelt down and kissed the old man's hands, thanking God\nfor having given him such a friend in his need, and praying with tears\nthat he would mercifully be pleased to accomplish the words of that\nholy man his servant. Then he besought him to tell the interpretation\nof the dream he had dreamt before Durin gave him the letter, which when\nthe Hermit had heard, he answered, This I can show you clearly, for it\nis all accomplished. The place overshadowed with trees, was the Firm\nIsland, and the people who made such great joy about you, signified\nthe great pleasure of the Islanders in gaining you for their Lord. The\nman who came to you with the box of bitter electuary, was the messenger\nof your Lady, for the bitterness of her words, you, who have proved\nthem, can best tell; and you laid aside your arms. The stony place\namidst the water, is this Poor Rock; and the religious man who spoke\nto you in an unknown tongue, am I, who tell you the holy word of God,\nwhich before you neither knew nor thought of.\n\nVerily, said Beltenebros, you tell me the truth of this dream, for\nthese things have all come to pass, and therefore great cause have I to\nhope for the future. Yet was not this hope so great or so certain as\nto remove his sorrow, for he would often sit with his eyes fixed upon\nthe ground, remembering what he had been, and his life would have been\nendangered by exceeding melancholy, had it not been for the counsel of\nthat good man. And sometimes, to take him away from that pensiveness,\nthe Hermit would make him go with two nephews that kept him company\nthere, to angle in a little stream hard by, where they caught plenty of\nfish.\n\nHere Beltenebros dwelt in penitence and great grief, and he past the\nnight most frequently under some large trees in the garden near the\nchapel, that he might there lament, without the knowledge of the Hermit\nor the boys; and calling to mind the great wrong he endured, he made\nthis song in his passion:\n\n    _Sith that the victory of right deserved\n    By wrong they do withhold for which I served;\n    Now sith my glory thus hath had a fall,\n    Glorious it is to end my life withall.\n    By this my death, likewise my woes release,\n    My hope, my joy, my inflamed love doth cease.\n    But ever will I mind my during pain,\n    For they, to end my glory and my gain,\n    Myself have murdered, and my glory slain._[156:A]\n\n    [156:A] This is the version in the English translation from the\n    French: the matter is preserved, the manner lost. The poem is\n    curious from its age; it is printed with these marks:\n\n        Pues seme niega victoria\n        dojusto mera deuida\n        alli do muere la gloria           (:\u00c2\u00b7:)\n        es gloria morir la vida.\n\n        Y con esta muerte mia\n        moriran todas mis da\u00c3\u00b1os,    (:\u00c2\u00b7:)       (:\u00c2\u00b7:)\n        mi esperanza y mi porfia\n        el amor y sus enga\u00c3\u00b1os;\n        mas quedara en mi memoria\n        lastima nunca perdida,            (:\u00c2\u00b7:)\n        que por me matar la gloria,\n        me mataron gloria y vida.\n\nHe had passed one night as usual under these trees, when towards\nmorning he heard certain instruments touched so sweetly, that he\ntook great delight in hearing them, and marvelled what it might be,\nknowing that in that place there dwelt none else than the Hermit and\nhis nephews. He rose, and went softly towards the sound, and saw that\nthere were two Damsels by a fountain, who, tuning their voices to their\nlutes, did sing a most pleasant song. He stood awhile listening, then\nadvanced, and said, God save you, gentle Damsels, but your sweet music\nhas made me lose my matins! They wondered who he should be, and said\nto him, tell us, friend, for courtesy, what place is this where we have\nlanded, and who are you who speak to us? Ladies, he replied, they call\nit the Rock of the Hermitage, because of the Hermit that dwells here.\nAs for me, I am a poor man who bear him company, doing great and hard\npenance for the sins that I have committed. Then said they, friend, is\nthere any house here where our Lady could rest for two or three days?\nfor she is very sick: she is a Lady of high rank and wealth, whom love\nhath greatly tormented. Beltenebros answered, here is a little cabin,\nit is very small, in which I lodge: if the Hermit pleases, you shall\nhave it, and I will asleep abroad in the field, as I often use to do.\nFor this courtesy the Damsels heartily thanked him. By this the day\nbegan to break, and Beltenebros saw under some trees the Lady of whom\nthey spake, lying upon a rich bed; four armed Knights and five serving\nmen, who attended her, were sleeping on the shore, and a well appointed\nship rode at anchor. The Lady was young and beautiful, so that he took\npleasure in beholding her.\n\nBeltenebros then went to the Hermit, who was robing himself to say\nmass. Father, said he, there are strangers here: it will be well\nto wait mass for them. So they both went out from the chapel. The\nKnights and serving-men were carrying the sick Lady towards them, and\nher Damsels were coming with her, and they asked the Hermit if there\nwas any house wherein they could place her. He answered, here are two\ncabins: I live in the one, and by my will never woman shall enter that.\nThis poor man, who makes his penitence here, lodges in the other, and\nI will not remove him against his will. To this Beltenebros replied,\nFather, you may well give them that, for I will rest under the trees,\nas I often do. They then entered the chapel to hear mass; but the sight\nof Knights and Damsels reminded Beltenebros of what he had been, and\nof his own Lady, and renewed in him his exceeding sorrow, so that he\nsobbed aloud, and kneeling down at the altar, besought the Virgin Mary\nto help him in his affliction. The Knights and Damsels, who saw how\nhe wept, held him for a man of good life, and marvelled how he could\nemploy his youth and beauty in that desert place, for any sin that he\ncould have committed, seeing that the mercy of God may be obtained in\nall places alike, by such as truly repent. As soon as mass was ended,\nthey carried the Lady into his cabin, and laid her in her rich bed,\nand she lay there weeping and wringing her hands. The Damsels went\nfor their lutes to solace her, and Beltenebros asked them wherefore\nshe appeared so distressed. Friend, said they, this Lady hath great\npossessions, and is of high rank and beautiful; though her sorrow\ndoth now diminish her fairness, and we will tell you the cause of her\nsorrow, tho' it should not be told to others. It is excessive love that\nafflicts her: she is going to seek him whom she loves at the court of\nKing Lisuarte, and God grant that she may find him there! When he heard\nthe house of King Lisuarte mentioned, and that the Lady was sick of\nlove, the tears came into his eyes, and he said, I pray you, Ladies,\ntell me the name of the Knight whom she loves. They answered, he is\nnot of this country, but is one of the best Knights in the world,\nexcepting only two who are of the greatest renown.\u00e2\u0080\u0094By the faith you\nowe to God, I beseech you tell his name, and the name of those other\ntwo.\u00e2\u0080\u0094We will tell you, on condition that you in return tell us if you\nbe a Knight, as you seem by every thing, and likewise what is your\nname. I am content, said he, that I may know what I ask.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Know then,\nthe Knight whom our Lady loveth, is Don Florestan, brother to the good\nKnight Amadis of Gaul, and to Don Galaor, and son of King Perion\nof Gaul and the Countess of Selandria. Now, quoth he, you tell me\ntruly of his goodness, for you cannot say so much good of him as he\ndeserveth.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Do you then know him?\u00e2\u0080\u0094It is not long since I saw him in the\nhouse of Briolania, for I saw the battle there of Amadis and his cousin\nAgrayes against Abiseos and his sons; after which Florestan arrived\nthere, and I heard Don Galaor speak great things of his prowess, for\nthey say he fought with him.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Yes, replied the Damsels, it was in that\nbattle they knew each other, and then Florestan went away.\u00e2\u0080\u0094What! is\nthis the Lady of the island where that battle was fought?\u00e2\u0080\u0094The same.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Her\nname is Corisanda. I do not now grieve for her so much, for he is so\ngentle and of such disposition, that well I know he will do whatever is\nher pleasure. Now then, said the Damsels, tell us who you are. Gentle\nDamsels, replied he, I am a Knight who have had more pleasure in the\nvanities of the world than falls to my lot now, for which I am now\nsuffering, and my name is Beltenebros. God's mercy upon you! said they:\nwe must now go play to our Lady.\n\nAfter they had sung to her awhile, they told her what Beltenebros had\nsaid of Florestan. Ah, call him here, cried she, he must be some good\nman, since he knows Don Florestan. They brought him to her. These\nDamsels, said she, tell me that you have seen and that you love Don\nFlorestan: by the faith you owe to God, tell me all you know concerning\nhim. Beltenebros then related how he had gone with his brethren and\nAgrayes to the Firm Island, and that he had not seen him since. Tell\nme, said Corisanda, are you akin to him, for you seem to love him\nmuch?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Lady, I love him for his great valour, and because his father\nknighted me, wherefore I am greatly bound to him and his sons; but I\nam very sad for the tidings which I heard of Amadis before my coming\nhere.\u00e2\u0080\u0094What are they?\u00e2\u0080\u0094I met a Damsel in a forest by the way side,\nsinging a sweet song, and I asked her who had made it. She answered, a\nKnight, to whom God give more comfort than he had when that was made,\nfor by the words it seemed he had suffered great wrong in love, and\ncomplained heavily. I stayed two days with the Damsel till I had learnt\nit. She told me that Amadis did show it her, and that he wept at the\ntime and was in great misery. I beseech you, quoth Corisanda, teach\nit to my Damsels, that they may sing and play it to me. That will I,\nsaid he, for your own sake, and for his sake whom you love; albeit that\nis no time for singing, nor for aught that is matter of joy. He then\nwent with the Damsels to the chapel, and showed them the song which he\nhad made: his voice was of rare sweetness, and now his melancholy made\nit more soft and in unison; and the Damsels learnt the song, and did\nsing it to their Lady, who took great pleasure to hear them. Corisanda\nremained there four days; on the fifth she took leave of the Hermit,\nand asked Beltenebros if he should remain there long? Lady, till I die,\nhe replied. Then she entered her ship, and made voyage to London.\n\nLisuarte and the Queen received her in a manner suitable to her high\nrank, and lodged her in the palace, and the Queen asked her if she had\nany suit to Lisuarte, that, if so, she might further it. My Lady, said\nCorisanda, I thank you for the favour; but my coming is to seek Don\nFlorestan, and because tidings from all parts reach this court, I will\nremain here some time till I hear news of him. Good friend, replied\nBrisena, that may you do so long as you think good; at present we have\nno other news of him, than that he is gone in search of his brother\nAmadis, who is lost, we know not for what cause; and she then related\nhow Guilan had found the arms. Hearing this, she began to weep, and\nsay, O Lord God, what will become of my Lord and friend Don Florestan!\nfor he so loves that brother, that, if he finds him not, he also will\nbecome desperate, and I shall never see him more! The Queen having\ngreat pity, consoled her, and Oriana, who was by, hearing the love\nshe bore to the brother of Amadis, had the greater desire to honour\nher, and accompanied her to her chamber, and learnt from her all her\nlove. Thus talking with her and Mabilia of sundry things, Corisanda\nrelated how she had been upon the Poor Rock, and found a Knight there\ndoing hard penance, who had taught her Damsels a song made by Amadis\nin his affliction, and the words, she said, were very sad. My good\nfriend and Lady, quoth Mabilia, beseech you let your Damsels sing it! I\ndesire much to hear it, seeing it was made by that Knight, my cousin.\nThe Damsels then sung the song, which it was a pleasure to hear, and\nyet so sorrowful that it made those sad who heard it. But Oriana, who\nunderstood the complaint, could no longer abide there for the shame of\nthe tears that she felt flowing, and she went to her chamber. Mabilia\ntherefore said to Corisanda, I see Oriana is unwell; she hath for\ncourtesy remained here longer than she should: I must go and assist\nher; but tell me what manner of man was he whom you saw upon the Poor\nRock of the Hermitage, and what did he know concerning Amadis? She\nthen told her how they had found him, that she had never seen a man so\ncomely in grief and being wasted, nor one of such manners in poverty,\nnor a man so young of such discourse and reason. Mabilia forthwith went\njoyfully to her friend's chamber. He who asks news, said she, sometimes\nlearns more than he expects: the melancholy man who lives upon the\nPoor Rock, and calls himself Beltenebros, by all that I can learn\nfrom Corisanda, must be Amadis. Oriana lifted up her hands, O Lord of\nthe World, grant that it be true! Dear friend, tell me what to do,\nfor I have neither sense nor judgment: unfortunate wretch, who by my\nown folly and intemperate passion have lost all my happiness! Mabilia\nturned away her face, that the tears might not be seen: we must wait\nfor the Damsel's return, said she; if she should not find him, leave it\nto me: I am sure he is this Beltenebros.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER 10._\n\n\nTen days that Damsel of Denmark remained in Scotland, not so much for\npleasure, as because she had suffered much from the sea, and for the\nill success of her search, and she feared that to return, when she had\nsped so ill, would be the death of her mistress. At length she took\nher leave, and receiving presents from the Queen of Scotland to Queen\nBrisena and Oriana and Mabilia, she embarked for Great Britain, not\nknowing what other course to pursue; but that Lord of the World, who\nto those that are utterly without hope or remedy shows something of\nhis power, that we may know it is he that helpeth us and not our own\nwisdom, he changed her voyage, to her own great fear, and the fear\nand sorrow of all in the ship; for the sea began to rage, and such\na tempest arose, that the sailors lost all power over the ship, and\nall knowledge of their course, and the ship was driven whither the\nwinds would, they that were in her having no hope of life. At last\none morning they came to the foot of the Poor Rock; some of them knew\nthe place, and said that Andalod the Hermit lived there, which, when\nthe Damsel heard, she ordered them to put to land, that being rescued\nfrom such a danger, she might hear mass from that holy man, and return\nthanks to the Virgin Mary for the mercy which her glorious Son had\nshown them.\n\nBeltenebros was sitting at this time by the fountain under the trees,\nwhere he had passed the night, and he was now so reduced that he did\nnot expect to live fifteen days. What with weeping, and with the\nwasting away of sorrow, his face was more deadly pale than sickness\ncould have made it, and so worn down and wan that no one could have\nknown him. He saw the ship, and the Damsels and two Squires landing;\nbut his thoughts being wholly bent upon death, the things that once\ngave him pleasure, as in seeing strangers that he might help them if\nthey needed succour, now had become hateful. So he rose and went into\nthe chapel, and told the Hermit that there were strangers landed and\ncoming up; and then he knelt before the altar, and prayed God to have\nmercy upon his soul, for he was soon going to his account. The Hermit\nvested himself to say mass, and the Damsel with Durin and Enil entered.\nAfter she had prayed, she uncovered her face. Beltenebros rose from his\nknees, and seeing her and Durin, the shock was so great that he fell\ndown senseless. The Hermit thought him dead, and exclaimed, Ah, Lord\nAlmighty, why has it not pleased thee to have pity upon him who might\nhave done so much in thy service! and the tears fell fast adown his\nlong white beard. Good Damsel, said he, let these men help me to carry\nhim to his chamber, I believe it is the last kindness we can do him.\nEnil and Durin assisted to lift him up, and they carried him into his\nchamber, and laid him upon a poor bed, and neither of them knew him.\n\nAfter the Damsel had heard mass, she resolved to make her meal ashore,\nfor she was weary of the sea. So by chance she asked who that poor\nman was, and what sore sickness afflicted him.\u00e2\u0080\u0094He is a Knight, who\nliveth here in penance. He is greatly to be blamed, quoth she, to\nchuse so desert a place. It is as you say, replied the Hermit, for he\nhas done so for the foolish vanities of the world, more than for the\nservice of God. I will see him, said the Damsel, since you tell me he\nis a Knight, perhaps there may be something in the ship which would\nrelieve him.\u00e2\u0080\u0094That you may do, but he is so near his end, that I believe\nDeath will ease you of that trouble. Beltenebros was lying upon his\nbed, thinking what he should do: if he made himself known, that would\nbe breaking his Lady's command, and, if he did not, he should remain\nwithout any hope or possible remedy; but he thought to disobey her will\nwould be worse than death, and so determined to be silent. The Damsel\ncame to the bedside, and said, Good man, I learn from the Hermit that\nyou are a Knight, and because Damsels are beholden to all Knights for\nthe dangers they encounter in our defence, I resolved to see you, and\nleave with you any thing which is in the ship that may contribute to\nyour health. He made her no answer, but sobbed with such exceeding\npassion, that she thought his soul was departing; and because the room\nwas dark, she opened a shutter for the light, and drew near to see\nif he were dead. They looked at each other some time, and the Damsel\nknew him not. At last, she saw a scar in his face: it was the mark of\na wound which Arcalaus had given him with his lance, when Oriana was\nrescued; then, tho' before she had no suspicion, she knew that this\nwas Amadis.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Ah, Holy Mary, help me! you are he, Sir! and she fell with\nher face upon the bed, and knelt down, and kist his hands. Now, Sir,\nsaid she, your compassion and pardon are needed for her who has wronged\nyou, for, if her unjust suspicion have reduced you to this danger,\nshe herself with more reason passes a life more bitter than death.\nBeltenebros took her in his arms, and held her awhile, having no power\nto speak. She then gave him the letter: your Lady sends you this, and\nshe bids you, if you are the same Amadis, whom she loves so well, to\nforget the past, and come to her in the castle of Miraflores, and there\nreceive her atonement for your wrongs, which excessive love occasioned.\nAmadis kissed the letter, and placed it upon his heart, saying, Heart,\ntake thy remedy, for there was none other that could save thee! This\nwas the letter:\n\nIf great faults committed by enmity, when humbly acknowledged, deserve\npardon, what shall we say to those which proceeded from excess of love?\nNot that by this do I deny, my true friend, that I deserve exceeding\npunishment, for neither having considered your truth, that had never\nbefore failed, nor my own mind in how passionate a state it was. I pray\nyou receive this Damsel as coming from one who humbly confesseth her\nfault, and who will tell you the wretchedness which she endures who\nrequests your pity, not because she deserves it, but for your comfort,\nas well as her own.\n\nSuch joy had Beltenebros at this letter, that he was lost even as in\nhis past sorrow, and tears that he did not feel ran down his cheeks. It\nwas agreed between them, that the Damsel should give out how she took\nhim aboard for his health sake, because on that Rock he could have no\nhelp, and that as soon as possible they should take land, and leave\nthe ship. Beltenebros then told the Hermit by what happy chance the\nDamsel had found him, and besought him that he would take charge of the\nMonastery that was to be built by his command at the foot of the rock\nof the Firm Island. This the old man promised, and Beltenebros then\nembarked, being known of none but the Damsel.\n\nThey soon landed with the two Squires, and left the mariners. Presently\nthey found a pleasant place upon the side of a brook, with many\ngoodly trees, and there they resolved to rest, because Beltenebros\nwas so weak; and there, if it had not been that the absence of his\nLady afflicted him, he would have passed the pleasantest life, and\nbest for his recovery that might be, for under those trees where the\nbrook-springs arose, they had their meals, and there was their tent\nfor the night. There related they to each other all that had past, and\na pleasure was it now to him to talk over his misery. Ten days they\nremained, and in that time he so regained strength, that his heart felt\nits old inclination for arms. He made himself known to Durin there,\nand took Enil for his Squire, who knew not whom it was that he served,\nbut was well content with him for his gentle speech. Hence departing,\nin four days they reached a nunnery; there they determined that he and\nEnil should abide, while the Damsel and her brother went to Miraflores.\nShe then gave Beltenebros money to buy horses and armour, and for\nhis wants; and she left behind her part of the Queen of Scotland's\npresents, that she might send Durin for them as if they had been\nforgotten, and so he might bring news.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER 11._\n\n\nAfter their year's vain search, Agrayes, Galaor, and Florestan, met\nat the place appointed, which was a chapel half a league from London.\nGandalin came with Florestan, and, when he found no tidings of his\nMaster, he said to them, that they should leave their lamentation and\nbegin their search again, remembering what Amadis would have done for\nthem if they had been in like case. So they determined to enter the\ncourt, and, if they learnt nothing there, to set out again upon their\nquest; and they wept to think how happily they had accomplished all\nadventures that had befallen them, and yet had failed to find him whom\nthey sought.\n\nThen having heard mass at the chapel, they rode towards the city. It\nwas St. John's day, and presently they met King Lisuarte riding out\nwith all his Knights in honour of that holy day, because the Saint was\nso great a Saint, and also because on that day he had been made King.\nWhen he saw three Errant Knights approaching, he drew nigh to welcome\nthem. Great joy was there when they unhelmed, and at first Lisuarte\nthought Florestan was Amadis, for he much resembled him; but Gandalin\nand the Dwarf, when they beheld this meeting, wept with great grief.\nThe news soon spread: greatly was Corisanda rejoiced thereat, and\nOlinda, the gentle friend of Agrayes, who knew how he had past under\nthe Arch of True Lovers. Mabilia, in joy for her brother's coming,\nwent for Oriana, who was sitting sorrowfully at her chamber-window,\nreading. She answered, weeping and sighing as if her heart-strings\nwould have broken, how can I go? do you not see my face and eyes, how\nthey show that I have been weeping? and how can I see those Knights, in\nwhose company I was wont to see Amadis: it is better to die! Mabilia\ncomforted her how she could:\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Damsel might yet bring tidings. Nay,\nquoth Oriana, if these Knights have failed, who have sought him so far\nand so long, how shall she succeed? a woman! and seeking him but in\none place? But she may induce him to discover himself, said Mabilia,\nfor she carries comfort to him, and knows the secret of his love,\nwhich they did not. So she cheared her, and made her wash her eyes,\nand called Olinda to go with them to the Queen. Look, quoth the King\nto Galaor, how ill your friend Oriana is! I grieve to see her thus,\nreplied he: reason is it that we should try to help her health by\nour services. My good friend, Galaor, said she, God it is who heals\nsickness and sorrow, and if it pleaseth him he will me, and recover\nyour brother Amadis, whom you have lost, and whom we all lament. Anon\nan outcry was heard without, for Gandalin and the Dwarf seeing their\nMaster's shield where it was hung, began to lament aloud, and the\nKnights were comforting them. What! cried Lisuarte, is Gandalin here?\nFlorestan answered, I met him two months ago seeking for his Master,\nand made him bear me company. I hold Gandalin, said the King, to be\none of the best Squires in the world, and we ought to comfort him. So\nhe rose, and went out to him. When Oriana heard the name of Gandalin,\nand the lamentation that he was making, she grew pale, and would have\nfallen, but Galaor and Florestan caught her. Mabilia, who knew the\ncause, ran to her, and put her arms round her neck. Good and true\nfriends, then said Oriana to the two brethren, if I do not show you\nwhat honour I ought and desire to show, I pray you impute it to its\ntrue cause, this sore illness! and then she went to her chamber. Dear\nfriend, said she to Mabilia, since we entered this city of London, I\nhave never been without some cause of sorrow: let us go to Miraflores,\nthat is a delightful place, and there I can have the comfort of\nsolitude. We will ask your parents' permission, said Mabilia, and there\nthe Damsel of Denmark will find us, and there you may the more freely\nsee him, when he shall be found. Ah, quoth Oriana, let us lose no time!\n\nThis castle of Miraflores was about two leagues from London, a little\nplace, but the pleasantest abode in all that land, for it was in a\nwood by the side of a mountain, surrounded with orchards and gardens\nthat abounded with fruits and flowers, and there were fountains in the\ncourts canopied with trees, that all the year round bore flower and\nfruit. The King one day had taken the Queen and Princess there when\nhe was hunting, and because the Princess was much pleased with the\nplace, he gave it her for her own. About a bow-shot from the gate was a\nnunnery, which she had founded, and there were nuns in it of holy life.\nSo that night she asked permission of Lisuarte and her Mother to retire\nthere, which was readily granted.\n\nThe King being at table with Agrayes and his cousins, said to them, I\ntrust we shall have good news of Amadis, for I have sent thirty Knights\nof the best of my household to seek him, and, if they fail, take you\nas many as you will and seek him; but I beseech you do not depart till\nafter a battle which has been appointed between me and King Cildadan of\nIreland, who is a King renowned in arms, and has married the daughter\nof King Abies, whom Amadis slew. The battle is to be an hundred against\nan hundred, and the quarrel this: That kingdom has been obliged to\npay tribute to the Kings of Great Britain: Cildadan demands battle on\ncondition, that, if he be conquered, the tribute shall be doubled; but,\nif he succeed, the country shall be freed therefrom. I trow he will\nneed all his Knights and friends! The three companions, albeit loth to\nhave their search delayed, yet could they not refuse to stay and share\nthe peril. After the cloths were removed, Florestan bade Gandalin go\nto Mabilia, who wished to see him. He went accordingly, and, when they\nsaw each other, they both wept. Ah, Lady, quoth he, what great wrong\nhath Oriana done to you and to your lineage, in depriving you of the\nbest Knight in the world! and what wrong hath she done to him, who\nnever erred against her in deed nor word! Ill hath God bestowed such\nbeauty and such goodness, when this could be in her! and yet none hath\nlost so much by it as herself! Say not thus, Gandalin! cried Mabilia,\nwhat she did was from exceeding love, and in the belief that he was\nloving another. And then she related all that had been said by Ardian\nconcerning the broken sword. O God! quoth Gandalin, where were all your\nunderstandings? he would have buried himself alive for her displeasure!\nand she believed this! and thus is the best Knight in the world\ndestroyed! Oriana had listened to all this: she came forward as if she\nhad heard nothing; and weeping, so that hardly could she speak, she\nsaid, O Gandalin! God preserve and bless you, as you shall do what you\nought! Lady, said he, in tears also, what do you command me? Kill me!\ncried she, for I killed your master, and you should revenge his death,\nas he would have revenged your's! And then she fell senseless.\n\nThe King bade Grumedan accompany his daughter to Miraflores, and see\nthat there were serving-men left there, and porters for the gate, and\nall things needful. Early the next morning they set out, and when\nOriana saw the place, how fresh it was with flowers and roses, and the\nwater-pipes and fountains, her mind felt greatly comforted. The keys of\nthe castle and of the garden-gates were every night to be carried by\nthe porters to the Abbess Adalasta, that she might keep them securely.\nI have desired to have the keys by day, said Oriana to Mabilia, that\nGandalin may get another set made, so that if by good fortune Amadis\nshould come, we may admit him by the postern-door thro' the garden; and\nthere Oriana determined to remain till she saw Amadis, or till she died\nin that solitude. Her apartments were full pleasant, and before the\nchamber-door there was a little court wherein three trees grew, that\nquite shadowed it; and there they took their pleasure, but with great\nanxiety expected the Damsel of Denmark and her tidings. The next day\nthe Porter came and said, a Squire asked for Mabilia. Let him in, quoth\nOriana; it is Gandalin, a right good Squire, who was brought up with\nus, and is the milk-brother of Amadis, whom God preserve from harm! God\npreserve him, indeed! cried the Porter, for great loss to the world\nwould it be if such a Knight were to perish. Lo now! said Oriana to\nher friend, as the Porter went away, how Amadis is loved by all, even\nby these simple men! and I who was so loved by him, I have been his\ndeath! Herewithal Gandalin entered, and Oriana making him sit by her\nside, related how she had sent the Damsel of Denmark to seek Amadis,\nand what she had written to him: think you, Gandalin, said she, that he\nwill forgive me? You little know his heart, Lady, quoth the Squire; by\nGod for the least word in the letter he will come: if you bade him, he\nwould bury himself alive under the earth,\u00e2\u0080\u0094how much sooner will he come\nat your command! And the Damsel of Denmark will sooner find him than\nall the persons in the world; for, if he hid himself from me, he will\nnot show himself to any other. And you, Lady, should take comfort with\nthis hope, lest he should find your beauty so altered when he comes,\nand fly from you. What, Gandalin! seem I so ugly? quoth she, being\nwell-pleased at his words. You seem so to yourself, said he, that you\nthus hide yourself where none may see you. I do it to this end, said\nOriana, that, when thy master cometh, if he would fly, he may not be\nable. She then showed him the keys, and bade him get others made like\nthem, that when his master came they might admit him at their pleasure.\n\nGandalin took the keys to London, and returned that same night with\nothers so exactly like them, that there was no difference, except\nthat these were new and the others old. Here they are! cried Mabilia,\nshowing them to Oriana: come, we have supt, and all the people are at\nrest! let us try them. They took hand, and went in the dark to the\nposterns that opened from the castle into the garden. When they were\nnear the first, Oriana cried, I cannot go on, I am dying with fear!\nFear nothing! quoth Mabilia, laughing as she spake, when I am here to\nprotect you, for I am cousin to the best Knight in the world, and am\ngoing on his service. Oriana could not but smile. I will take courage,\nand trust in your prowess in arms. Come on boldly, quoth Mabilia, and\nsee how I finish the adventure! if I fail, I swear for one whole year\nnever to hang shield from my neck, nor gird on a sword. In this merry\nmood she opened the first postern, and presently the other with as\nlittle difficulty, and then they were in the garden. How will he get\nover the wall? cried Oriana. At yonder corner, replied Mabilia, there\nmust be a piece of wood laid on the other side, and we will give him\nour hands here. You must perform this labour, for it is you who will\nbe paid for it. Oriana at this took hold of her cousin's coif and\nthrew it on the ground, and they stood laughing for some time, then\nreturned and fastened the gates, and went to rest. As Oriana lay down,\nMabilia cried, I wish that poor wretch were here who is now despairing!\neat, cousin! and sleep, that you may recover your beauty, as Gandalin\nadvised!\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER 12._\n\n\nKing Lisuarte was at table; the cloths were removed, and Galaor,\nFlorestan, and Agrayes, were about to take their leave and conduct\nCorisanda to her island, when there came a strange Knight into the\npalace, all armed except his head and hands, and with him two Squires,\nand he carried in his hand a letter sealed with five seals, which on\nhis knees he presented to the King, saying, let this be read, and then\nI will say for what I am come. Lisuarte saw that it was a letter of\ncredence, and bade him speak his errand. Then said the Knight, King, I\ndefy thee on the part of Famongomadan, the Giant of the Boiling Lake;\nCartadaque, his nephew, Giant of the Defended Mountain; and Madanfabul,\nhis marriage-brother, the Giant of the Vermillion Tower; and for\nQuadragante, brother of King Abies, and Arcalaus the Enchanter: they\ntell thee that thy death, and the death of all who call themselves\nthine is in their hands, for they are coming against thee on King\nCildadan's side. Howbeit, if thou wilt give thy daughter Oriana to\nMadasima, the fair daughter of Famongomadan, to be her damsel and\nservant, they will not injure thee, nor be thine enemies, but will\ngive her in marriage when it is time to Basagante, Madasima's brother,\nwho doth well deserve to be Lord of her and thy land. Therefore, King,\nlook to thy choice! such peace, or such war! Lisuarte smiled when he\nbegan to reply, as one who set at nought the defiance. Knight, said\nhe, better is a dangerous war, than a dishonourable peace: a bad\naccount should I render to Him, who hath placed me in this high rank,\nif for lack of heart I should so shamefully debase it! Tell them I\nwould rather chuse war with them all the days of my life, and death in\nthat war at last, than consent to the peace they offer! Tell me where\nI may send a Knight to carry them this answer? They may be found,\nreplied the Embassador, in the Boiling Lake, which is in the Isle of\nMongaza. I know not the manner of these Giants, quoth Lisuarte, whether\na Knight can go amongst them safely? That, replied he, doubt not;\nwhere Don Quadragante is present, no wrong can be committed: I will\nbe his warrant. In God's name! said Lisuarte, now tell me who you\nare?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Landin, the son of Quadragante's sister. We are come to revenge\nthe death of King Abies of Ireland, and greatly it grieves us that we\ncannot find him who slew him, neither know we whether he be alive or\ndead. Quoth Lisuarte, I would you did know him to be alive and well!\nall would then be right. I know wherefore you say thus, replied Landin;\nyou think him the best Knight living, but, be I what I may, you shall\nfind me in the battle with King Cildadan, and see what I can do against\nyou. I had rather have you in my service, answered Lisuarte; but there\nwill not be wanting those who will oppose you there.\n\nMeantime Florestan's anger was rising. Knight, said he, I am a stranger\nin this country, and not vassal to the King, so that there is no\nquarrel between us for what you have said to him, nor do I undertake\nit because there are many Knights in his household. But, you say, you\nseek for Amadis, and cannot find him; that I believe is not to your\nloss! but if it please you to do battle with me, who am Don Florestan,\nhis brother, let it be with this condition: if you are conquered, you\nshall give over the pursuit of vengeance; if I am slain, your wrath\nwill in part be satisfied, for whatever sorrow you feel for the loss\nof King Abies, that and much greater would Amadis endure for my death.\nLandin replied, Don Florestan I perceive you have a heart for battle,\nbut I cannot satisfy you now, being bound to return with this embassy\non an appointed day, and also having pledged myself to undertake no\nenterprize before the battle; but, if I come from that field alive, I\nwill meet you in the lists. Landin, quoth Florestan, you answer like a\ngood and honourable Knight, as you are bound to do; let it be as you\nhave said. And he gave his gloves in gage to the King, and Landin gave\nthe lappets of his armour; and the day for their combat was fixed for\nthe thirtieth after the battle. Lisuarte then sent a Knight called\nFilispinel with Landin to carry his reply, and they departed together.\n\nWhen they were gone, the King said to Galaor, and Florestan, and their\ncousin Agrayes, you shall see something that will please you! and\nhe sent for his daughter Leonoreta to come with her little damsels\nand dance before him, as she used to do; a thing which he had never\nordered, since the news that Amadis was lost. She came, and the King\nsaid to her, Daughter, sing now the song which Amadis, being your\nKnight, made for your love. So the child and the other young damsels\nbegan to sing.\n\n    _Leonor, sweet Rose, all other flowers excelling,\n    For thee I feel strange thoughts in me rebelling._\n\n    _I lost my liberty when I did gaze\n    Upon those lights which set me in a maze,\n    And of one free am now become a thrall,\n    Put to such pain thou serv'st thy friends withal;\n    And yet do I esteem this pain a pleasure,\n    Endured for thee whom I love out of measure.\n      Leonor, sweet Rose, all other flowers excelling,\n      For thee I feel strange thoughts in me rebelling._\n\n    _I little joy in any other's sight,\n    My heart is thine, thyself my chief delight.\n    But yet I see the more that I do love,\n    More smart I feel, more pain, more grief I prove.\n    Well! let Love rage, though he be angry ever,\n    I'll take my loss for gain, though I gain never.\n      Leonor, sweet Rose, all other flowers excelling,\n      For thee I feel strange thoughts in me rebelling._\n\n    _And though to you I manifest my woes,\n    My martyrdom, my smart, another knows;\n    One unto whom I secretly invoke,\n    Who is the cause of this my fire, my smoke.\n    She hath a salve to cure my endless grief,\n    And only she may yield me some relief.\n      Leonor, sweet Rose, all other flowers excelling,\n      For thee I feel strange thoughts in me[188:A] rebelling._\n\n    [188:A] The song of Amadis has suffered much in this second\n    translation, this \"shadow of a shade.\"\n\n\n        VILLANCICO.\n\n        Leonoreta, fin roseta,\n        blanca sobre toda flor,\n        fin roseta, no me meta\n        en tal cuyta vuestro amor.\n\n        Sin ventura yo en locura\n        me meti;\n        en vos amar es locura\n        que me dura,                         \u00e2\u0081\u0082\n        sin me poder apartar,\n        o hermosura sin par,\n        que me da pena y dulzor,\n        fin roseta, no me meta\n        en tal cuyta vuestro amor.           \u00e2\u0081\u0082\n\n        De todas las que yo veo\n        no desseo\n        servir otra sino a vos;\n        bien veo que mi desseo               \u00e2\u0081\u0082\n        es devaneo,\n        do no me puedo partir,\n        pues que no puedo huyr\n        de ser vuestro servidor,\n        no me meta, fin roseta\n        en tal cuyta vuestro amor.           \u00e2\u0081\u0082\n\n        Aunque mi quexa parece\n        referirse a vos senora,\n        otra es la vencedora,\n        otra es la matadora,                 \u00e2\u0081\u0082\n        que mi vida desfallece,\n        aquesta tiene el poder\n        de me hazer toda guerra;\n        aquesta puede hazer,\n        sin yo selo merecer,\n        Que muerto biva so tierra.           \u00e2\u0081\u0082\n\nYou should know by what occasion Amadis made this song for the Princess\nLeonoreta. One day, as he was talking with Queen Brisena, Oriana,\nMabilia, and Olinda, told Leonoreta to go and ask Amadis to be her\nKnight, and that he would then serve her and no one else. The little\ngirl went to him, and did so; and Amadis, smiling, took her in his\narms, and placed her on the estrado. Since you would have me be your\nKnight, said he, give me some jewel in token that you hold me for\nyours; and then she took from her head a gold clasp set with gems,\nand gave it him. All began to laugh at seeing how verily she believed\nthe jest, and Amadis, being thus chosen her Knight, made for her this\nsong. And when she and her damsels sung it they were dressed alike,\nhaving garlands on their heads, and garments of the same costliness and\nfashion as Leonoreta wore. She was a fair princess, albeit not so fair\nas Oriana, who had no peer, and afterwards she became Empress of Rome,\nand her twelve little damsels were all daughters of Counts and noble\nchiefs. So having sung their song, they knelt before Lisuarte, and then\nreturned to the Queen.\n\nGalaor and Florestan and Agrayes then asked the King permission to\nguard Corisanda home. He took them aside and said, Friends! there are\nno other three in the world in whom I have the same confidence as in\nyou. This battle is to be the first week in August, and you hear who\nare coming against me, and they will bring others with them, who are\nbrave and terrible in arms, and are also of the nature and blood of\nthe Giants: therefore, I request you not to undertake any adventure\nthat may delay you from being there to aid me, for with your aid, and\nthe justice of my cause, I trust in God, my enemies, powerful as they\nare, will be put to shame. Sir, said they, this command was not needed:\nas Errant Knights, our wish is to be in danger, to be where, being\nconquerors, we may win the renown which we seek; or, if conquered, come\nto the end for which we were all born: we will presently return. So\nthey took their leave, and departed with Corisanda.\n\nGandalin, who saw them depart, went to Miraflores, and related to\nOriana and Mabilia all that had past. Now, quoth Oriana, is Corisanda\nin all happiness, for she hath with her Don Florestan, whom she loves.\nGod ever continue her joy! for she is a good Lady. And then she herself\nbegan to weep, and cry, Lord God, let me see Amadis again, if it be\nbut for a day!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Gandalin greatly pitied her, but he affected anger,\nand said, Lady, you will make me stay away from Miraflores, for here\nare we looking for good tidings, and you will make us thus unhappy!\nOriana wiped away her tears: Do not reproach me, Gandalin! I would do\notherwise if I could; but, whatever semblance I should put on, my heart\nis always weeping! But tell me, what will become of the King my father,\nsince Amadis will not be in the battle? He cannot so have hidden\nhimself, replied Gandalin, that such news should not reach him; and\nthough you have forbidden him your sight, yet he may be present there,\nthinking then to merit pardon for a fault which he never committed, nor\nthought to commit. While they were thus communing, a little girl came\nrunning in, Lady, here is the Damsel of Denmark, and she brings noble\npresents for you! At this her heart trembled, and sunk within her, so\nthat she could not speak, and she was altogether so agitated as one\nwho expected life or death from the messenger who was coming. Mabilia\nanswered for her: tell the Damsel to come to us alone, that we may\nspeak with her in private. This she said that there might be none to\nwitness Oriana's agitation; but she herself and Gandalin were dismayed,\nnot knowing what was to come. The Damsel entered with a chearful\ncountenance, and kneeling before Oriana gave her a letter; here, Lady,\nare tidings of joy! I have fulfilled all your commands: read, and see\nif Amadis have not written it with his own hand. The letter fell from\nOriana's hand, she trembled so with exceeding joy: she opened it, and\nfound in it the ring which she had sent by Gandalin to Amadis, the day\nwhereon he fought with Dardan at Windsor, the which she knew well and\nkissed it many times, and said, blessed be the hour in which thou wert\nmade, that art transferred with such joy from one hand to another!\nSo when she had read the letter, and blest God with lifted hands for\nhis mercy, she made the Damsel relate how she had found him. Greatly\nwere they pleased at her wisdom in leaving a part of the presents with\nAmadis; now then, said they, produce the rest before those who are\nhere, and say how you have forgotten the others, that we may send for\nthem.\n\nThey showed Durin to what part of the garden-wall he was to bring\nAmadis, and he kissed Oriana's hands for sending him upon this errand,\nwhich might atone for what unwittingly he had carried before. It was\nagreed that Mabilia should publicly ask him to go; but he feigned\nhimself little contented at the bidding, and said, angrily, to Mabilia,\nfor you, Lady, I will go, but not for the Queen or Oriana, for I have\nhad great hardships in this journey for their pleasure. Friend Durin,\nsaid Oriana, you should not upbraid us with your services, so that we\nshall not thank you for it. Your thanks, replied he, I believe will be\nworth about as much as my service! however, said he to Mabilia, since\nyou desire it, I will set out to-morrow. He then took leave, and went\nwith Gandalin to the town to sleep; and Gandalin bade him remember\nhim to his cousin Enil, and tell him, said he, to come and see me as\nsoon as he can, for I have much to say to him, and request him while he\ncontinues with that Knight, to see if he can learn any news of Amadis.\nThis he said that Amadis might be the better disguised, and that he\nmight not want a pretext to send Enil away. So Durin mounted his\npalfrey the next morning and departed.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER 13._\n\n\nWhile Beltenebros remained in the Nunnery, his health and strength\nrecovered, and he sent Enil to the next town to get arms made for him,\na green shield with as many golden lions as it could hold, and to buy\nhim a horse, and a sword and breast-plate, the best he could find. In\ntwenty days all was ready, as he had ordered it, and at the end of that\ntime Durin arrived. Beltenebros was right glad to see him, and asked\nhim before Enil how the Damsel was, and wherefore he had returned.\nDurin answered, that the Damsel commended herself to him, and had sent\nfor two jewels which she had left in her bed; and then he delivered\nto Enil the bidding of his cousin Gandalin. Who is Gandalin? said\nBeltenebros. A Squire, my cousin, replied Enil, who long time served\na Knight called Amadis of Gaul. Then Beltenebros took Durin apart to\nwalk with him, and heard the message of Oriana, and also how his\nbrethren were to be in the battle with Cildadan, and of the defiance\nthat Famongomadan had sent, and how he had demanded Oriana to be\nserving-damsel to his daughter, till he should give her in marriage to\nhis son. When he heard this, his flesh shook with exceeding anger, and\nhe resolved in himself, so soon as he had seen his Lady, to undertake\nno adventure till he had found Famongomadan, and fought with him a\ncombat to the utterance for what he had dared propose.\n\nThat night Beltenebros took leave of the Nuns, and early the next day,\narmed in his green armour, he set forth, and Enil with him carrying his\nshield and helmet and lance. The day was clear, and he feeling himself\nin his strength and once more in arms, began to manage his horse so\nskilfully that Enil said to him, I know not, Sir, what the strength of\nyour heart may be, but I never saw a Knight appear so well in arms.\nThe worth, quoth Beltenebros, lies in a good heart, not in a good\nappearance! happy dole hath he whom God has gifted with both! You have\njudged the one, judge the other as you shall see it deserves when put\nto proof. Seven days they travelled without adventure, and Beltenebros,\nas he drew nearer, wore his helmet that he might not be known. On the\neighth, as they were passing the foot of a mountain, they met a Knight\nupon a large bay horse, so huge in stature that he appeared to be a\nGiant, and two Squires carrying his arms. He cried out with a loud\nvoice to Beltenebros, Stop, Sir Knight, till you have told me what I\nwant to know! Beltenebros looked at the stranger's shield, and seeing\nthree golden flowers in a field azure, he knew it was Don Quadragante,\nfor he had seen a like shield in the Firm Island, hanging above all the\nothers, as his who had approached nearest the Forbidden Chamber. Yet,\nremembering Famongomadan, he would willingly now have avoided battle;\nas also, because he was on his way to Oriana, and feared lest the great\nprowess of this Knight should cause him some delay. Howbeit he stopt,\nand bade Enil give him his arms if they were wanted. God protect you!\nquoth Enil, he looks to me more like a Devil than a Knight! He is no\nDevil, quoth Beltenebros, but a right good Knight, of whom I have heard\nheretofore. By this Quadragante was come up, and said to him, Knight,\nyou must tell me if you belong to the household of King Lisuarte?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Why\nask you?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Because I have defied him and all his household, and kill all\nof them whom I meet. Beltenebros felt his anger rising, and replied,\nyou are one of those who have defied him?\u00e2\u0080\u0094I am; and I am he who will\ndo to him and his all the evil in my power.\u00e2\u0080\u0094And who are you?\u00e2\u0080\u0094My name\nis Don Quadragante.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Certes, Don Quadragante, notwithstanding your high\nlineage, and your great prowess in arms, this is great folly in you to\ndefy the best King in the world! they who undertake more than they can\neffect, are rather rash than hardy. I am not this King's vassal, nor am\nI of his land, but for his goodness my heart is disposed to serve him,\nso that I may account myself among those whom you have defied: if you\nchuse battle with me, you may have it; if not, go your way! I believe\nKnight, said Quadragante, you speak thus boldly because you know me so\nlittle: pray you, tell me your name?\u00e2\u0080\u0094They call me Beltenebros: you will\nknow me by it no better than before, for it is a name of no renown;\nbut, though I am of a far land, I have heard that you are seeking\nAmadis of Gaul, and, by what I hear of him, it is no loss to you that\nyou cannot find him. What! quoth Quadragante, do you prize him, whom I\nhate so much, above me? Know, that your death-hour is arrived! take thy\narms, and defend thyself if thou canst. I might do it with some doubt\nagainst others, he replied, but can have none in opposing thee, who art\nso full of pride and threats.\n\nThen they ran their course; both felt the shock; the horse of\nBeltenebros reeled, and he himself was wounded at the nipple of his\nbreast. Quadragante was unhorsed and hurt in the ribs; he rose, and ran\nat Beltenebros, who did not see him, for he was adjusting his helmet,\nand he mortally stabbed his horse. Beltenebros alighted, and went\nagainst him sword in hand in great anger. There was no courage in this!\ncried he; your own horse was strong enough to have finished the battle\nwithout this discourtesy! The blows fell as thick and loud as though\nten Knights had been in combat, for both put forth all their strength\nand skill, and the fight lasted from the hour of tierce till vespers;\nbut then Quadragante, overcome with fatigue, and with a blow that\nBeltenebros gave him on the helmet, fell down senseless. Beltenebros\ntook off his helmet to see if he were dead; the air revived him; he\nplaced the sword-point at his face, and said, Quadragante, remember thy\nsoul, for thou art a dead man. Ah, Beltenebros, cried he, for God's\nsake let me live for my soul's sake!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Yield thyself vanquished, then,\nand promise to fulfil what I command! I will fulfil your will to save\nmy life, said Quadragante, but there is no reason wherefore I should\nconfess myself vanquished: he is not vanquished, who in his defence\nhath shown no fear, doing his utmost till strength and breath fail him\nand he falls; but he who does not do what he could have done, for lack\nof heart. You speak well, said Beltenebros, and I like much what I\nhave learnt from you: give me your hand and your promise then; and he\ncalled the Squires to witness it. You shall go forthwith to the court\nof King Lisuarte, and remain there till Amadis arrives, and then you\nshall pardon him for the death of your brother, King Abies; for they by\ntheir own will fought in lists together, and such revenge, even among\nthose of meaner degree, ought not to be pursued. Moreover, you shall\nmake null the defiance against King Lisuarte, and not take arms against\nthose who are in his service. All this did Quadragante promise against\nhis will, and in the fear of death. He then ordered his Squires to make\na litter, and remove him; and Beltenebros mounting the bay horse of his\nantagonist, gave his arms to Enil, and departed.\n\nFour Damsels, who were hawking with a merlin, had seen the battle, and\nthey now came up, and requested Beltenebros would go to their castle,\nwhere he should be honourably welcomed, for the good will which he had\nmanifested to King Lisuarte. He thankfully accepted their hospitality,\nbeing sore wearied with the struggle, and accompanied them. They\nfound no other wound than that upon the nipple of his breast, which\nbled much; howbeit, in three days he departed. On the second day at\nnoon, from a hill top, he beheld the city of London, and, to the right\nthereof, the castle of Miraflores, where his Lady Oriana then abode.\nHere he stood awhile, gazing, and devising how he might dispatch Enil.\nDo you know this country? said he. Yes, replied Enil; that is London,\nin the valley.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Are we so near? but I will not go to the court till I\nhave won some renown, and deserve to be there: go you therefore and\nvisit your cousin Gandalin, and there you will hear what may be said of\nme, and when the battle is to be with King Cildadan.\u00e2\u0080\u0094But shall I leave\nyou alone?\u00e2\u0080\u0094I sometimes go alone; but we will first appoint a place to\nmeet at. They proceeded a little way and saw three tents pitched by a\nriver side, the middle a rich one, and before it there were Knights\nand Damsels sporting; and he saw five shields at the entrance of one\ntent, and five at another, and ten armed Knights, therefore he turned\naside from the road that he might not joust with them. The Knights\ncalled out to him to joust. Not now, said he, for you are many and\nfresh, and I am alone and weary. I believe, said the one, you are\nafraid you should lose your horse.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Why should I lose him?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Because he\nwould be won by the man who dismounted you: a likelier chance than that\nyou should win his. Since that is the case, said Beltenebros, I will\nride on and secure him while I can; and he continued his course. The\nKnights cried after him, your arms, Sir Cavalier, are protected better\nby a smooth tongue than by a stout heart: they will last to be hung\nover your monument, tho' you should live these hundred years! Think of\nme as you please, quoth he, your words will not destroy my worth such\nas it is. I would to heaven you would break one lance with me! cried\nthe Knight; I would not mount horse again for a whole year, if you\nrode to your lodging this night upon that bay steed! Good Sir, said\nBeltenebros, that is the very thing I am afraid of, and have therefore\ngot out of the way. Holy Mary, they all exclaimed, what a cowardly\nKnight! He nothing heeding them, rode on to a ford, at which he meant\nto cross, when he heard a cry from behind. Stop, Knight! and looking\nround saw a Damsel following him upon a palfrey richly trappinged. Sir\nKnight, said she, Leonoreta, daughter to King Lisuarte, is in yonder\ntent, and she and all her Damsels request that for their sake you will\njoust with her Knights, a thing you will be more bound to do by this\nrequest than by their defiance.\u00e2\u0080\u0094What! quoth he, is the daughter of the\nQueen there?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Aye, truly!\u00e2\u0080\u0094I should rather do her service myself than\ncommit enmity against her Knights, but at her command I will consent,\non condition that they require from me nothing farther than the joust.\nWith this answer the Damsel returned; and Beltenebros took his arms,\nand rode to an open part of the field to wait for the encounter. The\nfirst who came was the one who had such an inclination to win his\nhorse. Beltenebros was pleased that this was the first: he unhorsed\nhim, and bade Enil take his horse, and said, Sir Knight, if you keep\nyour word, you will not have another fall for a whole year, for so\nyou promised unless you won my bay; but he lay groaning, for he had\nthree ribs and a hip broken. Three others shared the same fortune with\nless hurt; on the last, Beltenebros broke his lance. Enil took their\nhorses one by one, and tied them to the trees, and then Beltenebros\nwould have departed; but he saw another Knight making ready, and a\nSquire brought him four lances, and said, Sir, Leonoreta sends you\nthese lances, and bids you do your duty with them against the other\nKnights, since you have overthrown their companions. For her sake, said\nhe, who is daughter to so good a King, I will do what she requires;\nbut for her Knights I would do nothing, for they are discourteous to\nmake Knights who are travelling joust against their will. So he took\na lance, and one after the other dismounted all the rest; only the\nlast endured two encounters, and fell not till the third, for he was\nNicoran of the Perilous Bridge, and was one of the good jousters in\nGreat Britain. When Beltenebros had finished, he sent all the horses\nthat he had won to Leonoreta, and bade her tell her Knights to be more\ncourteous to strangers, or else to joust better, for they might find\na Knight who would make them go afoot. The Knights remained greatly\nabashed; if Amadis were alive and well, quoth Nicoran, verily I should\nsay this were he, for I know no other who would have left us thus. It\nis not he, said Galiseo, some of us should have known him, and he would\nnot have jousted with us, being his friends. Giontes, the nephew of\nKing Lisuarte, who was one of them, replied. Would it were Amadis, our\ndishonour would be well gained! but be he who he may, God prosper him\nwherever he goes! for he won our horses like a good Knight, and like a\ngood Knight restored them. Curse him, quoth Lasamor, he has broken my\nhip and my ribs, but it was my own fault.\n\nBeltenebros went on satisfied with his success, and admiring the lance\nwhich he held, for it was a good one. About a quarter of a league\non, he saw a chapel overbowered with trees, and there he determined\nto alight for the sake of prayer, and because the great heat and the\nexercise of jousting had made him athirst. At the chapel-door were\nthree palfreys equipped for women, and two for Squires. He went in,\nbut there was no one there, and commended himself from his heart to\nGod and the Virgin. As he was coming out, he saw the three Damsels and\ntheir Squires sitting under the trees beside a fountain, and made up\nto them that he might drink: but neither of them did he know. Knight,\nsaid they, are you of King Lisuarte's household? I would, quoth he, I\nwere so good a Knight as to be approved in such a company: but whither\ngo ye?\u00e2\u0080\u0094To Miraflores, to see our Aunt who is Abbess there, and to see\nOriana the Princess; but we are waiting here till the heat of the day\nbe over. In God's name, quoth he, and I will keep you company till it\nbe time to travel: how is this fountain called?\u00e2\u0080\u0094We know not but there\nis one in yonder valley, by those great trees there, which is called\nthe Fountain of the Three Channels. He knew it better than they, for\nhe had often passed it when hunting, and there he determined to fix a\nmeeting-place with Enil, whom he wished to send away while he went to\nhis Lady.\n\nPresently, while they were thus talking, there came along the road\nwhich Beltenebros had passed, a waggon drawn by twelve palfreys, and on\nit were two Dwarfs who drove. There were many Knights in chains in the\nwaggon, and their shields were hanging at the side, and many damsels\nand girls among them weeping and lamenting loudly. Before it went a\nGiant, so great that he was fearful to behold; he rode a huge black\nhorse, and he was armed with plates of steel, and his helmet shone\nbright, and in his hand he had a boar spear, whose point was a full\narm's-length long. Behind the waggon was another Giant, who appeared\nmore huge and terrible than the first. The Damsels seeing them were\ngreatly terrified, and hid themselves among the trees. Presently the\nGiant who rode foremost turned to the Dwarfs, and cried, I will cut\nyou into a thousand pieces if you suffer these girls to shed their own\nblood, for I mean to do sacrifice with it to my god, whom I adore.\nWhen Beltenebros heard this, he knew it was Famongomadan, for he had a\ncustom to sacrifice damsels to an Idol in the Boiling Lake, by whose\nadvice and words he was guided in every thing, and that sacrifice used\nto content his god, being the Wicked Enemy who is satisfied with such\nwickedness. At this time Beltenebros did not wish to encounter him,\nbecause he expected to be that night with Oriana, and also because his\njoust with the ten Knights had wearied him; but he knew the Knights\nin the waggon, and saw that Leonoreta and her Damsels were there, for\nFamongomadan, who always took this waggon with him to carry away all\nhe could find, had seized them in their tents shortly after their\nencounter. Immediately he mounted, and called to Enil for his arms; but\nEnil said, let those Devils pass by first. Give me! quoth Beltenebros,\nI shall try God's mercy before they pass, to see if I can redress this\nvillainy. O Sir, cried the Squire, why have you so little compassion\nupon your own youth! if the best twenty Knights of King Lisuarte's\ncourt were here, they would not venture to attack them. Care not\nthou for that, replied his Master, if I let them pass without doing\nmy best I should be unworthy to appear among good men: you shall see\nmy fortune. Enil gave him his arms, weeping, and Beltenebros then\ndescended the sloping ground to meet them. He looked toward Miraflores\nas he went, and said, O Oriana, my Lady, never did I attempt adventure\nconfiding in my own courage, but in you: my gentle Lady, assist me now,\nin this great need! He felt his full strength now, and all fear was\ngone, and he cried out to the Dwarfs to stop.\n\nWhen the Giant heard him, he came towards him with such rage that smoke\ncame through the vizor of his helmet, and he shook his boar-spear with\nsuch force that its ends almost met. Unhappy wretch! cried he, who\ngave thee boldness enough to dare appear before me? That Lord, quoth\nBeltenebros, whom thou hast offended, who will give me strength to-day\nto break thy pride. Come on! come on! cried the Giant, and see if his\npower can protect thee from mine! Beltenebros fitted the lance under\nhis arm, and ran against him full speed: he smote him below the waist\nwith such exceeding force that the spear burst through the plates of\nsteel and ran through him, even so as to strike the saddle behind,\nthat the girths broke, and he fell with the saddle, the broken lance\nremaining in him. His boar-spear had taken effect upon the horse of\nBeltenebros, and mortally wounded him. The Knight leapt off and drew\nhis sword. The Giant rose up so enraged that fire came from him, and\nhe plucked the lance from his wound, and threw it at Beltenebros so\nforcibly that if the shield had not protected his helmet, it would\nhave driven him to the ground; but his own bowels came out with the\nweapon, and he fell, crying, help, Basagante! I am slain. At this\nBasagante came up as fast as his horse could carry him: he had a steel\naxe in his hand, and with this he thought to have cut his enemy in\ntwo; but Beltenebros avoided the blow, and at the same time struck at\nthe Giant's horse: the stroke fell short, but the end of his sword cut\nthrough the stirrup-leather, and cut the leg also half through. The\nGiant in his fury did not feel the wound, though he missed the stirrup;\nhe turned and raised his axe again. Beltenebros had taken the shield\nfrom his neck, and was holding it by the thongs: the axe fell on it and\npierced in, and drove it from his hands to the ground. Beltenebros had\nmade another stroke, the sword wounded Basagante's arm, and, falling\nbelow upon the plates of fine steel, broke, so that only the handle\nremained in his hand. Not for this was he a whit dismayed; he saw the\nGiant could not pluck his axe from the shield, and he ran and caught\nit by the handle also; both struggled; it was on that side where the\nstirrup had been cut away, so that Basagante lost his balance, the\nhorse started and he fell, and Beltenebros got the battle-axe. The\nGiant drew his sword in great fury, and would have ran at the Knight,\nbut the nerves of his leg were cut through; he fell upon one knee,\nand Beltenebros smote him on the helmet, that the laces burst and it\nfell off. He seeing his enemy so near, thought with his sword, which\nwas very long, to smite off his head; the blow was aimed too high,\nit cut off the whole crown of the helmet, and cut away the hair with\nit. Beltenebros drew back; the helmet fell over his head upon his\nshoulders, and Leonoreta and the Damsels, who were on their knees in\nthe waggon praying to God to deliver them, tore their hair and began\nto shriek and call upon the Virgin, thinking he was surely slain.\nHe himself put up his hand to feel if he were wounded to death, but\nfeeling no harm, made again at the Giant, whose sword falling upon a\nstone in the last blow had broken. Basagante's heart failed him now, he\nmade one stroke more, and cut him slightly in the leg with the broken\nsword; but Beltenebros let drive the battle-axe at his head; it cut\naway the ear and the cheek and the jaw, and Basagante fell, writhing in\nthe agony of death.\n\nAt this time Famongomadan had taken off his helmet, and was holding his\nhands upon his wound to check the blood. When he saw his son slain,\nhe began to blaspheme God and his Mother Holy Mary, saying that he did\nnot so much grieve to die as that he could destroy their monasteries\nand churches, because they had suffered him and his son to be conquered\nby one Knight. Beltenebros was then upon his knees returning thanks\nto God, when he heard the blasphemer, he exclaimed, Accursed of God\nand of his Blessed Mother! now shalt thou suffer for thy cruelties;\npray to thine Idol, that, as thou hast shed so much blood before him,\nhe may stop this blood of thine from flowing out with thy life! The\nGiant continued to curse God and his Saints; then Beltenebros plucked\nthe boar-spear from the horse's body, and thrust it into the mouth\nof Famongomadan, and nailed him backward to the earth. He then put\non Basagante's helmet that he might not be known, and mounting the\nother's horse, rode up to the waggon and broke the chains of all who\nwere prisoners therein, and he besought them to carry the bodies of the\nGiants to King Lisuarte, and say they were sent him by a strange Knight\ncalled Beltenebros; and he begged the Princess to permit him to take\nthe black horse of Famongomadan, because it was a strong and handsome\nhorse, and he would ride him in the battle against King Cildadan. The\nbodies of the Giants were so huge, that they were obliged to bend\ntheir knees to lay them in the waggon. Leonoreta and her Damsels made\ngarlands for their heads, and being right joyful for their deliverance\nentered London singing in triumph. Much was King Lisuarte astonished\nat their adventure, and the more for Quadragante had already presented\nhimself on the part of Beltenebros, of whom nothing else was known\nexcept what Corisanda had related. I would he were among us, said the\nKing, I would not lose him for any thing that he could ask and I could\ngrant.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER 14._\n\n\nBeltenebros having taken leave of the Princess, returned joyfully to\nthe fountain where the Damsels were. He bade Enil go to London, and\nget him other arms made the same as those he wore, which were now so\nbattered as to be useless, and he was to buy him another sword, and\nbring them in eight days to the Fountain of the Three Channels. Enil\nforthwith departed, and the Damsels also taking their leave, rode on\nto Miraflores, and there told Oriana and Mabilia what great feats they\nhad seen that day atchieved by a Knight called Beltenebros. He meantime\nstruck into the forest, and rode slowly the same way, till he came to\na brook winding among the trees, and there, for it was yet early, he\nalighted and took off his helmet, and drank of the water, and cleansed\nhimself from the sweat of the battle; and there he remained, musing\nover his past and present fortunes and the strange vicissitudes of\nlife, till night approached; then he made for the castle. Durin and\nGandalin met him at the garden-wall, and took his horse. Oriana and\nMabilia and the Damsel were on the wall: they gave him their hands:\npresently he was over, and held Oriana in his arms; but who can tell\nwhat joy there then was in embracing and kisses, and the mingling of\ntears? Mabilia roused them as from a dream, and led them into the\ncastle, and there Beltenebros remained eight days with Oriana in joys\ndearer to him than even Paradise.\n\nMeantime King Lisuarte was preparing for the battle against King\nCildadan, which he much doubted, knowing what Giants and mighty\nKnights would be with his enemy. Florestan and Galaor and Agrayes\nwere returned, and Don Galvanes Lackland had arrived, and many other\ngood Knights. The whole talk was of Beltenebros, and many said his\ndeeds surpassed those of Amadis; whereat Galaor and Florestan were\nso enraged, that nothing but their promise to undertake no adventure\nbefore the battle, withheld them from seeking him and proving him in\nmortal combat, but of this they only communed with each other. One day\nthere came into the palace an old Squire with two others, all clad in\ngarments of the same cloth. The old man's beard was shorn, his ears\nwere large, and the hair of his head grey. He, kneeling before the\nKing, addressed him in the Greek language: Sir, the great fame which\nis gone abroad of the Knights and Dames and Damsels of your court hath\nbrought me hither, to see if I can find among them what for sixty years\nI have sought through all parts of the world, and reaped no fruit for\nmy labour. Noble King, if you hold it good, permit that a trial may be\nmade here, which shall not be to your injury nor to the shame of any.\nAll who were present, desirous to see what it might be, besought the\nKing's assent, which he, feeling the like curiosity, readily granted.\nThe old Squire then took in his hand a coffer of jasper, three cubits\nlong and a span wide, its sides being fastened with plates of gold;\nthis he opened, and took out a sword, so strange as the like was never\nseen; the sheath was of bone, yet green like an emerald, and so clear\nthat the blade of the sword could be seen through, and it was unlike\nother blades, for the one-half was as bright as it could be, and the\nother burning red like fire; the hilt was of the same green bone, and\nthe belt also, being made of such small pieces fastened together with\ngold screws, that it could be girt on like a common belt. This the\nSquire hung round his neck, and took from the same coffer a head-dress\nof flowers, the half whereof were as beautiful and fresh as though\nthey had just then been cut from the living stem; the other half so\nwithered and dry, that it seemed they would crumble at a touch. The\nKing asked why those flowers, that all seemed to grow from the same\nstem, were yet in such different condition, and what was the nature of\nthat strange sword? King, said the old Squire, this sword cannot be\ndrawn from the scabbard, except by the Knight who of all men in the\nworld loveth his Lady best; and as soon as he shall have it in his\nhand, the half which is now of burning red, shall become clear and\nbright like the other part, and the whole blade be of one colour; and\nwhen this garland of flowers shall be set upon the head of that Lady\nor Damsel, that with the same surpassing love doth love her husband or\nfriend, the dry flowers shall again become fresh and green. And know,\nSir, that I cannot be knighted except by the hands of that true lover,\nnor take sword except from that loyal Lady; for this, O King, having\nsearched all other courts and parts of the world, I am come hither,\nafter sixty years, hoping that as there is no court of Emperor or King\nlike this, here I may succeed at last. Tell me, said Lisuarte, how is\nit that the half which is burning red, does not burn the scabbard?\nYou shall hear, quoth the Squire: Between Tartary and India there is\na sea so hot, that it boils like water over a fire, and it is all\ngreen; and in that sea serpents breed bigger than crocodiles, having\nwings wherewith they fly, and so venomous that all people run from\nthem in fear; nevertheless, they who at any time find one dead esteem\nit much, being a thing excellent in medicine. These serpents have one\nbone reaching from the head to the tail, it is so strong that the whole\nbody is formed upon this one bone, and green as you see it here in this\nscabbard and hilt and belt, and because it grew in that boiling sea no\nfire can burn it. Now I will tell you of this garland: the flowers are\nfrom trees in Tartary, in an island fifteen miles from the shore; the\ntrees are only two, nor is it known that there are any such in any part\nelsewhere; but in that sea is a whirlpool, so terrible that men fear to\nventure to take them, howbeit they that have dared pass and succeeded,\nsell them for what they will to ask, for this freshness and life-green\nnever fails. Having told you thus much, you shall know who I myself am.\nI am nephew of the best man of his own time, who was called Apolidon,\nand who long time dwelt here in your country in the Firm Island. My\nfather was King Ganor, his brother, to whom he gave his kingdom, and\nmy mother, daughter to the King of Panonia, and, when I was of age to\nbe knighted, my father, because of the exceeding love between him and\nmy mother, made me promise to be made Knight by none but the most true\nLover in the world, and to receive sword only from the truest Lady.\nI lightly promised, thinking to accomplish this as soon as I should\nsee my Uncle Apolidon and his Grimanesa; but so it was, that, when I\narrived, Grimanesa was dead, and he knowing wherefore I came, greatly\npitied me, for it is the custom of my land that no one who is not a\nKnight can reign therein. So having no remedy to give me then, he bade\nme return to him at a year's end, and at that time he gave me this\nsword and garland, telling me by the labour of this search to remedy\nthe folly of such a promise. And now, Sir, I beseech you, as without\nwrong or shame it may be done, that you and your Knights and the Queen\nand her Ladies be pleased to make the proof; and if such can be found\nas shall accomplish it, let the sword and garland be theirs, the profit\nwill be mine, and rest from my weary toil, and the honour yours above\nall other Princes, that they who could accomplish this adventure were\nfound in your court. The King then said, that Santiago's day was but\nfive days off, and then he had summoned many Knights to be present,\nwherefore if it pleased him to wait so long, his chance of success\nwould be greater among so many more Knights. This the Squire thought\ngood.\n\nGandalin was at this time in the court, and heard all that the Squire\nhad said. Forthwith he rode to Miraflores. Beltenebros and Oriana\nwere playing chess in the little court under the trees. When he had\nrelated all that had past, and how a day was appointed for the trial,\nBeltenebros sate musing for a while, lost in thought, till Gandalin\nand his cousin had left the place, and then, as he looked up, Oriana\nasked what had made him so deep in thought. Lady mine, quoth he, if by\nGod's help and your's my thought could be accomplished, I should be a\nhappy man for ever. Dear friend, she answered, she who hath made you\nmaster of her person will do for you any thing! He took her hands and\nkissed them often, and said, this is what I have been thinking; that,\nif you and I could win this sword and garland, our hearts would be for\never at rest, and all those doubts that have tortured us be utterly\ndestroyed. But how can I do this, said Oriana, without great shame\nand greater danger to myself and to these Damsels, who are privy to\nour loves? That, replied Beltenebros, may easily be done, you shall\ngo so disguised, and I will obtain such security from the King your\nfather, that we shall be as unknown as before strangers. Then do your\npleasure, quoth she, and God prosper it to good! I doubt not to gain\nthe garland, if it is to be won by exceeding love. I will obtain your\nfather's promise, said Beltenebros, that nothing shall be demanded\nfrom me against my own consent, and will go completely armed; and you,\nLady, shall have a cloak fastened round you, and your face muffled,\nso that you shall see all, yet no one see you. Let us call Mabilia,\ncried Oriana, without her counsel I must not adventure. So they called\nher and Gandalin, and the Damsel of Denmark, and they, albeit they\nsaw great peril, did not gainsay their inclination; and Mabilia said,\nthere was a rich cloak among her mother's presents that the Damsel had\nbrought, which never had been worn or seen in that land. She brought\nit, and took Oriana apart and dressed her in it, so that when she came\nout with her gloves on, and her face-cloths,[220:A] no one knew her,\nthough they looked narrowly. Lady mine, cried Beltenebros, I never\nthought it would give me pleasure not to see and know you! He then\nbade Gandalin buy the fairest palfrey that could be found in all that\ncountry, and bring it at midnight before the day of the adventure, to\nthe garden-wall; and he told Durin to have his horse ready for him this\nevening, that he might meet Enil, and send him to obtain the security\nfrom King Lisuarte.\n\n    [220:A] Antifazes.\n\nBeltenebros rode that night through the forest, and at day-break\nreached the fountain of the Three Channels. Presently Enil came up and\nbrought with him the arms: they were good arms, and pleased him well.\nHe then asked the Squire what news of the court, and Enil told him the\ntalk there was of his prowess, and was about to relate concerning the\nsword and garland, but Beltenebros said, this I learnt three days since\nfrom a Damsel who made me promise to carry her secretly to this proof:\nthis I must do, and will prove the sword myself; but, as you know it is\nmy will not to make myself known to the King nor to any other till my\ndeeds make me worthy, you must return directly and tell the King, that\nif he will promise and secure us that nothing shall be said or done\nto us against our pleasure, we will come and try the adventure; and\nsay you, before the Queen and her Ladies, that this Damsel makes me go\ngreatly against my inclination. On the day of the proof, meet me here\nat dawn, that the Damsel may know if she has this security; meantime I\nmust return to bring her here, for she dwells far off. Beltenebros then\ntook his arms, and while Enil went to the city, lay down by the same\nbrook-side till night, then rode to Miraflores. Durin was ready to take\nhis horse, and his fair friends expected him at the garden-wall. What,\nSir Cousin! quoth Mabilia, seeing his arms, you return richer than you\nwent. Do you not understand it? cried Oriana, he went to get arms, that\nhe might free himself from this prison. Thus chearfully they entered\nthe castle, and they gave him food, for he had not eaten the whole day,\nlest he might be seen.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER 15._\n\n\nThe next day the Damsel of Denmark was sent to London to learn what\nanswer Enil obtained, and to tell the Queen and her Ladies that Oriana\nwas ill, and did not rise. It was late before she returned, because the\nKing had gone forth to meet Queen Briolania, who was come to his court,\nand brought with her three hundred Knights to go in search of Amadis,\nas his brothers might dispose of them. Twenty Damsels accompanied her,\nall dressed in mourning like herself, for in that dress had he found\nher, and that dress had she worn when he recovered for her her kingdom,\nand that she would wear till some tidings of him were known. Is she\nso handsome as they say? quoth Oriana. So save me God, Lady, replied\nthe Damsel, as excepting yourself, I think her the fairest and most\ngraceful woman that I have ever seen. And it grieved her much when she\nheard of your malady, and she bade me say, when it pleased you, she\nwould come and see you. I should be much pleased, answered Oriana,\nfor she is the person in the world whom I most wish to see. Honour\nher well, said Beltenebros, for she well deserves it, although, Lady,\nyou have suspected something.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Dear friend, no more of this, I know my\nthoughts were false. But this trial, quoth he, will make you more free\nfrom this, and me more subject.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The garland, said Oriana, will prove\nwhether my error proceeded from excess of love. The Damsel then told\nthem how the King had promised Enil the security which he required.\n\nThey rose at midnight before the day of the proof. Oriana was wrapt\nin Mabilia's mantle, and her face muffled, and Beltenebros armed\nhimself in his new arms. They crossed the wall; Gandalin was there\nwith the horse and palfrey: they mounted, and rode alone into the\nforest. Mabilia and the Damsel of Denmark remained in great fear\nlest ill should befal; but, when Oriana found herself in the midst\nof the forest at night, she was so affrighted that her whole body\ntrembled and her speech failed, and she began to apprehend that she\nmight fail to accomplish the adventure, and that if so her lover, who\nnow trusted in her so fully, would suspect her truth, and then she\nwished she had never undertaken the danger. When Beltenebros perceived\nher agitation, he said, I would rather have died, Lady, than brought\nyou here, if I had thought you would have been so terrified; we had\nbetter turn back, and he turned his horse and led her palfrey round.\nBut then Oriana's heart changed, seeing that so great an adventure\nwould be for her sake foregone, and she said, dear friend do not heed\nmy fears, for I am a woman, and this is a strange place to me; regard\nonly what you, as a good Knight, ought to atchieve. Dear Lady, mine,\nquoth he, your prudence guides my folly: I can neither do or say other\nthan you command me: so they proceeded, and about an hour before the\ndawn reached the Fountain. When it was broad day Enil came up. Lady\nDamsel, said Beltenebros, this is the Squire of whom I spake, let us\nhear if the King grant your demand. Enil then told them what Lisuarte\nhad promised, and that the proof was to begin immediately after mass.\nBeltenebros then gave him his shield and spear, the helmet he wore\nhimself; they took the road to London, and in this guise entered the\ngate. All flocked to see them crying out, this is the good Knight\nBeltenebros, who sent here Don Quadragante and the giants! This is the\nprime of all knighthood! Happy the Damsel who comes in his guard! When\nOriana heard this she felt a pride to know herself the mistress of him,\nwho, by his great valour, could command all others. Thus they reached\nthe palace, where the King and all his Knights, the Queen and her\nLadies, were assembled for the adventure. As soon as their approach was\nknown the King went to receive them at the entrance. They knelt to kiss\nhis hand, but he withdrew it, saying, Good friend, I shall willingly\nobserve your pleasure, for in a short time you have done more for me\nthan ever Knight did for King before. Beltenebros bowed thankfully,\nbut made no answer, and proceeded with his Damsel up to the Queen: But\nOriana's flesh quivered with fear, seeing she was before her parents,\nbut her true friend never let go her hand, and so they both knelt\nbefore Brisena. The Queen raised them and said, Damsel, I know not who\nyou are, never having seen you; but for the great services which this\nKnight hath performed, and for your own deserts also, you are both\nhonourably and deservedly welcome. Beltenebros thanked her, but Oriana\nheld down her head as if for humbleness, and made no answer. The King\nand his Knights then went on one side of the hall, the Queen and her\nLadies to the other; but Beltenebros said, that if it pleased the King\nhe would stand apart with his Damsel, and prove the adventure last of\nall.\n\nLisuarte then took the sword and drew it a hands breadth, no more.\nMacandon, the old Squire, said, King, if there be no better lover in\nthe Court than you, I shall depart without my wish, and he thrust\nthe sword back, for so it was to be at every trial; then Galaor\nessayed, and could only draw it three fingers breadth. Florestan and\nGalvanes, and Grumedan, and Brandoyuas, and Ladasin, all tried, none\nso successfully as Florestan, who drew it at a full palm's length.\nDon Guilan the Pensive was the next, and he drew it half out; had you\nloved just as much again, said Macandon, you would have won the sword.\nOthers there were who tried and could not move it, and these the old\nSquire called heretics in love. Then came Agrayes to the proof, he\nlooked at Olinda, and thought surely the sword would be his, for his\ntrue and loyal love; he drew it within a hand of the point, and as he\nstill attempted to pluck it forth the burning part of the blade touched\nhis cloak and burnt it; then he retired sufficiently rejoiced that he\nhad so far exceeded all others. Almost Sir Knight, quoth old Macandon,\nhad you been the winner, and I satisfied. Palomir and Dragonis, who\nhad arrived the day before, next essayed, and drew it no farther than\nGalaor. Knights, quoth the Squire, if you had only as much of the\nsword as you can draw, you would have but little for your own defence.\nTrue, said Dragonis; and if you should be knighted at the end of the\nadventure, you are not so young but that you may remember the ceremony.\nAt this all laughed, but there remained no more to make the trial;\nBeltenebros then arose and took his Lady by the hand, and went towards\nthe sword. Sir Stranger, quoth Macandon, this sword will become you\nbetter than the one you wear, yet I would not have you be so sure of\nit as to lay aside your own, for this is to be won by truth of heart,\nand not by force of arms. But he took the sword, and drew it from the\nscabbard, and immediately the whole blade became clear and shining\nwith one brightness. When Macandon saw this, he knelt down and said, O\ngood Knight, God give thee honour, for thou hast done great honour to\nthis court! Reason is it that you should be beloved well by your Lady\nunless she be the falsest and most unreasonable of women. Now then give\nme the honour of Knighthood, which I may receive from no other hand\nbut yours! and you will give me with it lands and the lordship over\nmany good men. Good friend, replied Beltenebros, let the proof of the\ngarland be made, then I will do with you what can rightly be done. And\nthen he blessed the sword, and laying his own aside, hung it round his\nneck, and led his Lady back to her station. Great were the praises then\nwhich he received for excellence in arms and in love, so that Galaor\nand Florestan were moved to great anger, for they thought it shame that\nany other than Amadis should be esteemed above them, and they resolved\nwithin themselves that their first business after the battle with King\nCildadan should be to fight him, and either die or show to the world\nthe difference there was between him and their brother.\n\nLisuarte now called upon the Queen and her Ladies to make their proof,\nwithout fear, and in the hope of honour; for she who won the garland,\nif Dame should be more loved and honoured by her husband, if Damsel\nacquire the praise of loyalty above all. Brisena first placed the\nflowers on her own head, they did not in the least alter. Queen and\nMadam, quoth old Macandon, if the King your husband gained little by\nattempting the sword, it seems you have well requited him; she answered\nnothing, but drew back greatly abashed. Next was Briolania, that fair\nQueen of Sobradisa; she, like Brisena, produced no change. Lady and\nmost fair Damsel, cried the Squire, you must be loved before you can\nlove so as to gain the garland; four other King's daughters came on,\nEluida and Estrelleta her sister, who was fair and proud, and Aldeva\nand Olinda the gentle. Upon her head the flowers began to revive so\nthat all thought she would win the praise, but they only began, and\nwhen the garland was taken off they withered again as before; more than\na hundred other Dames tried, but all with less success than Olinda,\nand all received their jest from the old Squire. Oriana had felt a\nfear when Briolania made the proof, and she rejoiced at the failure,\nlest, had she succeeded, her friend might deem it was for his love,\nfor never had she seen so fair a Damsel, and she thought surely, that\nif his heart were not won by her, there was no danger of a rival. All\nothers had now failed; she made sign to Beltenebros to lead her up,\nthe garland was placed round her head, and immediately the dry flowers\nquickened with full freshness and verdure. Excellent Damsel, quoth\nMacandon, you are she for whom I sought forty years before you were\nborn!\n\nThen the old Squire besought Beltenebros to knight him, and that\nDamsel to give him a sword. Let it be presently, said Beltenebros, for\nI cannot tarry. Macandon then put on white garments, and white armour\nover it like a new Knight, and Beltenebros knighted him according to\nthe manner, and put on his right spur, and Oriana girded on a rich\nsword which his Squires had brought. The Dames and Damsels laughed at\nseeing him, and Aldeva said so loud that all heard her. What a fair\nChild! and he will be a new Knight as long as he lives! How know you\nthat? cried the rest. She answered, because the dress he has now put\non will last as long as himself. Gentle Damsels, quoth the old man, I\nwould not exchange my pleasure for your manners; my youth may be ranked\nwith your modesty. The King was pleased at this reply, for he thought\ntheir speeches were unseemly.\n\nThis done, Beltenebros and his Lady took leave of the Queen; and\nBrisena said to her daughter, Lady, though it is your pleasure not to\nbe known here, yet I beseech you, when you are returned home, ask of me\nwhatever favour I can grant. I know her Lady, quoth Beltenebros, just\nas much as you do, though we have been seven days together; but this\nI can say, that she is fair, and she has locks that need not be thus\nconcealed. Damsel, said Briolania, I know you not: but if your friend\nlove you as you love him, and as he will do if he be wise, love never\nmade a better union. Her words gave pleasure to Oriana; then they took\ntheir leave, and mounted, the King and Don Galaor accompanying them;\nand Beltenebros said to the King, take this Damsel and honour her, Sir,\nfor she well deserves it, having honoured your court. Lisuarte took her\nbridle, and he went on talking with Galaor, who had little inclination\nfor friendly talk with him, longing to engage him in battle. When they\nhad gone a little way Beltenebros took the bridle from the King, and\nsaid, Now, Sir, God be with you, and if it please you that I should\nbe one of your hundred in the battle, I shall willingly serve you.\nThe King embraced and thanked him, and said, that great part of his\nfear was removed by having him on his part; they parted then, and\nBeltenebros and his Lady, Enil following, entered the forest, he having\nround his neck that green sword, and she that garland of flowers upon\nher head.\n\nWhen they reached the fountain of the Three Channels, they saw a Squire\non horseback coming down the mountain, who said, Knight, Arcalaus the\nEnchanter bids you send him that Damsel, if you make him fetch her,\nhe will cut off both your heads. Where is Arcalaus the Enchanter?\ncried Beltenebros; the Squire showed him where he and another Knight\nwere under a tuft of trees, both being armed, and their horses ready\nby them. At hearing this Oriana could scarce keep her seat upon the\npalfrey. Lady Damsel, fear not! quoth he, if this sword fail me not I\nwill protect you. He then took his arms\u00e2\u0080\u0094tell Arcalaus I am a stranger\nKnight, who know him not, and have no reason to obey him. When Arcalaus\nheard this he grew greatly enraged, and said to the Knight with him,\nNephew Lindoraque, take that garland which the Damsel wears for your\nMistress Madasima; if the Knight attempts to hinder you cut off his\nhead, and hang the woman by the hair to a tree. Lindoraque mounted\nand moved on to do it: he was a huge man, and well might be so, being\nson of Cartadaque the giant of the defended mountain, by a sister of\nArcalaus. But Beltenebros held him at nought, and placing himself\nright in his way, for he had heard his errand, cried, Knight, you pass\nno farther! You shall not hinder me, quoth he, from performing the\npleasure of Arcalaus. Beltenebros answered, we shall see what your\npride and his villainy can do. They couched their lances and ran, the\nlances broke, Lindoraque fell with the truncheon in his body, he\nrose, being of stout heart, and seeing Beltenebros about to strike\nhim, bent from the blow, and reeled and fell upon the truncheon, and\ndrove it clean through his back, so that he died instantly. Arcalaus\nwas riding up to help him. Beltenebros galloped up to him and made him\nlose the joust, and struck at him with his sword a blow that cut off\nthe lance, and with it half the hand, so that only his thumb was left.\nHe turned to fly, and threw away his shield, and by the fleetness of\nhis horse escaped. Beltenebros then bade Enil take the shield and hand\nof Arcalaus, and the head of Lindoraque to the King, and tell him what\nhad happened. He and his Lady went on their way, and rested beside a\nfountain till it was near night, then rode to Miraflores. The Squires\nwere ready, and Mabilia and the Damsel joyfully received them, for if\nthere had been delay they only expected death. Fair prizes have you\nwon, quoth Mabilia, but they have cost us a great alarm and many tears.\n\nAs Lisuarte and Galaor were returning to the town, a Damsel came up\nand gave them each a letter, and rode away. The King read his thus:\nTo thee Lisuarte, King of Great Britain, I Urganda, the Unknown, send\nsalutation, and I tell thee that in the perilous and cruel battle\nbetween thee and King Cildadan, Beltenebros, in whom you confide, shall\nlose his name and his renown, and for one blow that he shall give all\nhis great deeds shall be quite forgotten. In that hour thou shalt be\nin the greatest extremity, and in all danger of death, when the sharp\nsword of Beltenebros shall shed thy blood. Cruel and dolorous will the\nbattle be; there will be great rage and cruelty, and no compassion. But\nat last by three blows from the hand of Beltenebros his party shall\nremain conquerors. Look to it King, for she who sends thee this warning\nknows what is to come!\n\nBrave as the King's heart was, this letter dismayed him; he believed\nthat Beltenebros was to lose his life, and that his own would be in\nthe utmost danger; howbeit he put on a good countenance, and gave the\nletter to Galaor, and asked his counsel. Sir, quoth Galaor, I stand\nin need of your counsel myself; but if this battle can honourably be\navoided, I should advise that it be done so; if that cannot be, you\nshould not be in the field; by the sword of Beltenebros your blood is\nto be shed, and by three blows from his hand his party are to remain\nconquerors. This I do not understand, for he is to be on your side; and\nyet the letter says otherwise. Friend, quoth the King, your love for\nme makes you advise me ill. I must not, for the knowledge of any one,\nhow wise soever, distrust the power of him who ordaineth all things. My\ngood friend, I will be in the battle, and take what fortune it please\nGod to give. The King's answer roused Galaor; rightly are you esteemed\nthe best King in the world! quoth he, and he then shewed him his own\nletter.\n\nYou Don Galaor of Gaul, the strong and the brave, I Urganda, salute as\nhim whom I esteem and love; know from me what must befall you in the\ndolorous battle, if you be there. After many cruelties and deaths that\nyou will have witnessed in the last press, your strong body and stout\nlimbs will fail your brave and ardent heart, and at the end your head\nwill be in his power, who, with the three blows that he shall give, is\nto decide the day.\n\nFriend, quoth Lisuarte, if this say true, you will be slain if you\nenter the battle; I will so order that you may honourably decline it.\nSir, said Galaor, it seems the advice I gave displeased you, that you\nwould command me to my shame. God forbid that I should herein obey\nyou. Don Galaor! you are right, the King answered, we will trust in\nGod. Meantime say nothing of these letters lest our friends should be\ndiscouraged. Before they entered the town two Knights came up to be\npresent in the battle, they were Don Bruneo of Bonamar, and Branfil\nhis brother; and Bruneo grieved much that he had not arrived in time\nto prove the sword, for he had passed under the arch of Loyal Lovers,\nand by his love to Melicia doubted not that he should have won it. Him\nGalaor courteously saluted, and took to his lodging as a right worthy\nKnight. Presently Enil arrived with the head of Lindoraque hanging from\nthe horse's breast-plate, and the hand and shield of Arcalaus. Then was\nthe great prowess of Beltenebros more praised, and Galaor and Florestan\nmore desirous, to prove in battle that he was not equal to their lost\nbrother Amadis. At this time Filispinel returned who had been sent with\nthe King's defiance to the giants; he brought word that they were gone\nto Ireland, and would in four days time land in the port of the plain\nwhere the battle was to be fought, and he brought with him this letter.\nTo the great Lord Lisuarte, King of Great Britain, and to all our\nfriends in his dominions. I Arban, a wretch, once King of North Wales,\nand I Angriote of Estravaus, inform you that our unhappy fortune hath\nthrown us into the power of the fierce Gromadaza, wife of Famongomadan,\nwho, in vengeance for the death of her husband and her son, inflicts\nupon us such torments, that we wish for death to relieve us; but she\nwill not kill us that she may lengthen our sufferings, the which are\nsuch, that we should have ridden ourselves of life, if it were not\nfor losing our souls thereby; but being now near death, we write this\nletter with our blood, praying God to grant you the victory over these\ntraitors, who, in such inhuman sort torment us. Great sorrow had the\nKing hereat, and all his Knights; however he comforted them, assuring\nthem that there was no other remedy, or way of helping their friends,\nthan by conquering in this great battle: so they all prepared, and set\nforth for the place appointed.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER 16._\n\n\nThree days Beltenebros remained at Miraflores, on the fourth he\ndeparted alone at midnight. He had told Enil to meet him at the Castle\nof an old Knight, called Abradan, which was by the place of battle, and\nthere on the next day he found him. The old Knight received him well,\nfor he always, hospitably welcomed all Errant Knights. Presently two\nSquires arrived, the nephews of the host, and said, that King Cildadan\nwas landed, and had pitched his tents upon the sea-shore, and his\nKnights with him, and they were landing their horses and arms. Grumedan\nand Giontes had been to them on the part of King Lisuarte, and made\ntruce till the day of battle, and also concluded that neither party\nshould bring out more than the hundred Knights appointed. Nephews,\nsaid the host, what think you of those enemies whom God confound!\nGood Uncle, said they, we must not speak of them; they are so strong\nand terrible, that unless God miraculously assist our King, he and his\npower will be nothing against them. Herewithal, the tears fell from\nthe old man's eyes, who cried, O Lord, do not forsake the best and\njustest King in the world! Good mine host, quoth Beltenebros, be not\ndismayed for their fierceness, for worth and modesty often overcome\nproud valour. I pray you go to the King for me, and tell him that there\nis in your house a Knight called Beltenebros, who requests to know the\nday of battle that he may be there. How, Sir, cried old Abradan, are\nyou he who sent Don Quadragante to the King my Master, and who slew\nFamongomadan and his son! Now am I overpaid for all the services that\never I have rendered to Errant Knights. So taking his Nephews to guide\nhim, he went to King Lisuarte, who was arrived within half a league of\nhis enemies. Greatly was the King rejoiced with what he said, and he\ntold him the battle should be on the next day, and said, there lacked\nhim but one Knight of the hundred. Don Grumedan replied, you are rather\nabove the number, for Beltenebros should be counted for five. When the\nold man returned with these tidings, Enil took his Master aside, and\nkneeling down, said, Albeit Sir my services have not merited it, yet\nyour great goodness emboldens me to ask a boon, and I beseech you for\nGod's sake to grant it me. Beltenebros raised him and said, ask any\nthing that I can do. Enil would have kissed his hand; Sir, I ask you\nto make me a Knight, and to entreat the King that I may be one of the\nhundred since one is wanting. Friend Enil, replied Beltenebros, let it\nnot enter your heart to begin so perilously. I do not say this because\nI will not make thee a Knight, but to advise thee to undertake lighter\nadventures first. My good Master, quoth Enil, where can I adventure so\nwell? if I come from the field alive it will always be to my praise\nand honour, and if I die it will be dying well, and my memory will be\njoined with all those good Knights who must perish there. But then an\naffectionate pity was felt at the heart of Beltenebros, and he said\nwithin himself, thou dost well show thyself to be of the lineage of\nGandales, my excellent and true fosterer! Be it so! said he, and he\nasked the host to give the Squire arms; and Enil watched them that\nnight, and after dawn they heard mass, and Beltenebros knighted him,\nand they departed, their host and his Nephews carrying their arms. They\nfound Lisuarte putting his battle in order to go against the enemies,\nwho were ready in the plain. The King and his Knights rejoiced to\nsee Beltenebros. Sir, quoth he, I come to perform my promise, and I\nbring with me this Knight to supply the one lacking. The King joyfully\nwelcomed him, and placed his Knight to make up the complement. Then\nthey moved on in one battalion: the King was in the middle of the rank,\nbefore him Beltenebros and his companion were placed, and Galaor,\nFlorestan, and Agrayes; Gandalac, the Giant who had fostered Galaor,\nand his two sons Bramandil, and Gavus whom Galaor had knighted;\nNicoran, of the Perilous Bridge, Dragonis and Palomir, and Pinorante,\nGiontes, nephew to the King, the renowned Don Bruneo of Bonamar,\nand his brother Branfil, and Don Guilan the Pensive. All these were\ntogether, and before them went that honourable and good old Knight Don\nGrumedan, Brisena's fosterer, with the banner of the King.\n\nKing Cildadan on his side placed the Giants in the front of the battle,\nand twenty Knights of his lineage of great valour. He stationed\nMadanfabul, the Giant of the Isle of the Vermillion Tower, upon a\nlittle rising ground, and with him ten of the best Knights, and\ndirected them not to move till they saw that all were weary, and that\nthen they should make way fiercely towards King Lisuarte, to kill\nhim or carry him prisoner to the ships. In this array the two parties\napproached with deliberate pace till they came near, and then they met\nwith such a shock that many a man fell, and many a horse ran over the\nfield without a rider. That was a hard and dolorous day for all who\nwere there present! for striking and struggling they continued thus\nwithout rest or intermission a third part of the day, with such toil\nand effort, being in the mid heat of summer, that they and their horses\nwere so wearied, and the wounded bled so fast, that in many life could\nendure no longer, and there they fell dead, especially those whom the\nGiants had wounded with their great force. In that hour Beltenebros\ndid wonders in arms with that good sword, striking and slaying all\nbefore him, though the care with which he kept watch over the King\nmost employed him; for Lisuarte knowing that the great shame, or great\nglory of the day would be his, thrust himself into the hottest press\nof the battle. Galaor and Florestan, and Agrayes kept by him, being\nemulous to equal Beltenebros that day, and Don Bruneo watched to assist\nGalaor, who, like a lion made among the Giants, to equal him whom he\nthought the rival of Amadis, regardless of their great strength, and\nthose whom he saw fall under their blows. In this heat he came before\nCartadaque, the Giant of the Defended Mountain, who with a heavy battle\naxe, notwithstanding Florestan had given him a deep wound in the\nshoulder, had already killed six Knights at his feet. Galaor made at\nhim, and with his sword struck him upon the helmet; it cut away all it\ntouched, and lopt off his ear, and passing downward cut the battle-axe\nhelve from his hand. When the Giant saw his enemy so near, and that he\nhad no weapon to wound him, he laid hold on him with his hands, and\nplucked him so forcibly that the saddle girth broke, and he fell, but\nstill the Giant held him; and Galaor thought he never could escape\nfrom that mighty grasp, and that all his bones were broken. Yet before\nhis senses were gone he recovered his sword that hung from his wrist\nby the chain, and thrust it through the vizor of Cartadaque's helmet;\nthe Giant's gripe relaxed, and he fell dead. Galaor arose then, but so\nweak and exhausted, that he could not pluck his sword from the Giant's\nhead. The Knights on both sides pressed towards him, some to kill him\nat this disadvantage, his own friends to his help. The battle became\nfiercer there than it had yet been; King Cildadan came up, and on the\nother part Beltenebros. Beltenebros twice smote Cildadan on the head\nsuch stunning blows that the King fell from his horse at the feet of\nGalaor. Galaor caught up the sword of Cildadan, and laid about him till\nhis strength and senses were gone, and he fell upon the body of King\nCildadan.\n\nAt this time the Giants Gandalac and Albadanzor were engaged; they\nsmote each other so furiously with their clubs, that they and their\nhorses both fell. Albadanzor's arm was broken, and Gandalac's leg;\nhowbeit he and his sons slew their enemy. The day was now half over,\nand on the two sides an hundred and twenty Knights had been slain.\nMadanfabul, the Giant of the Vermillion Tower, was looking on from the\nhill; he saw how the field was thinned, that they who remained were\nweary with their toil, their armour broken, and their horses stiff\nand exhausted. He thought that he and his companions could now have\ndiscomfited all that were left on both sides, and descended into the\nfield, crying out, Leave not a man of them alive; I will kill or take\nKing Lisuarte. Beltenebros had just mounted a fresh horse, which one\nof old Abradan's nephews gave him; he saw the Giant and his troop come\non, and placed himself before the King, and called on Florestan and\nAgrayes, who were near; with these Don Bruneo of Bonamar joined, and\nBranfil, and Guilan the Pensive, and Enil, who had done much in that\nbattle, and was therefore always held in high esteem, all these albeit\nthey were grievously wounded, and their horses also, placed themselves\nbefore the King. Before Madanfabul came a Knight called Sarmadan the\nLion, the Uncle of King Cildadan, and for strength and prowess the\nbest of his lineage. Beltenebros stood foremost to meet him. Sarmadan\ndrove his lance at him, it broke, yet pierced the shield and wounded\nhim, though with no deep wound. Then Beltenebros hit him a thwart blow\nwith his sword across the bever, straight over both eyes, and through\nboth, that he fell dead. But Madanfabul and his other comrades came on\nso fiercely, that the most of those who were of King Lisuarte's part\nwere beaten down before them, and he made right for the King, with\nsuch fresh strength, that the Knights about the King, bravely as they\nadventured, could not protect him; he seized Lisuarte round the neck,\nand grasped him so strongly that he lost all power of resistance,\nplucked him from the saddle, and carried him towards the ships. When\nBeltenebros beheld that he exclaimed, O Lord God, let not Oriana have\nthis affliction! He struck the spurs into his horse and galloped after\nhim sword in hand, and reaching him smote at him with his whole force.\nThe sword fell on the right arm with which he held the King, and cut it\nclean through by the elbow; the weapon stayed not there, but passing on\ncut through the King's breast-plate, and wounded him so that the blood\nstreamed down. Lisuarte was left upon the ground, and the Giant fled\nlike a lost man, bleeding to death. When Beltenebros saw that with that\none blow he had slain that mighty Giant, and rescued King Lisuarte from\nso great a danger, he shouted out, Gaul! Gaul! for I am Amadis. This he\ncried as he laid on among his enemies, felling them or slaying them,\nand in good season did he exert this prowess, for great havock had been\nmade among the Knights of his party, so many slain, others wounded,\nand fighting on foot, and the enemies had come fresh against them with\ngreat strength, and an eager desire to kill all they could. For this\ncause Amadis put forth his strength, so that it might well be said his\ngreat prowess was the safety and support of his party that day; but\nwhat most kindled him was, that he had seen his brother Galaor afoot\nand sore wearied, and looking again saw him no longer, so that surely\nhe thought him dead, and with this grief and anger he encountered no\nKnight whom he did not slay. When they of King Cildadan's party saw the\ngreat feats that he atchieved, they took for their leader a Knight of\nthe race of the Giants, whose name was Gadancuriel, and who had made\nsuch slaughter that day that he was noted by all. They expected, being\nled by him to win the day, and at this time Amadis had thrust in so\nfar among the enemy that he was beset by them and in great peril. King\nLisuarte had mounted again, and with him were Don Bruneo of Bonamar,\nand Florestan, and Guilan the Pensive, and Ladasin, and Galvanes\nLackland, and Olivas, and old Grumedan, from whose hand the banner had\nbeen cut. The King seeing Amadis in such danger made up to succour him\nlike a worthy King, although he had many wounds, and all rejoicing that\nBeltenebros was Amadis, forced their way up to him, and released him\nfrom the press. He then turned whither he would, and chance guided him\nto where his cousin Agrayes, and Palomir and Dragonis were on foot,\nand many Knights upon them striving to slay them, but they standing\ntogether, and still defending themselves manfully. He seeing them thus,\ncalled upon his brother Florestan, and Guilan the Pensive, to their\nsuccour. There came against him a Knight of great renown, called\nVadamigar, whose helmet had been struck off; he wounded the horse of\nAmadis in the neck, but Amadis reached him, and cleft him down to the\nears, and as he fell cried out. Cousin Agrayes, take this horse! And\nFlorestan struck down a good Knight, called Daniel, and gave his horse\nto Palomir, and Palomir then won one for Dragonis; and Guilan wounded\nLandin sorely, and unhorsed him, and gave his horse to Branfil: thus\nthey were all helped, and then they followed in the path of Amadis,\nwho went on cutting his way manfully, and shouting Gaul! Gaul! Amadis!\nthat the enemy might know he was in the field. Such courage did he\nthen display, and so well did Florestan and Agrayes, and those other\nKnights second him, and King Lisuarte also played his part so well,\nthat they won the battle; the enemies who survived flying to their\nships, and Amadis still among them raging for the death of Galaor. But\nGadancuriel still made head with those whom he could turn from flight,\nand he turned upon the King. Florestan, who had seen his feats that\nday, thrust himself before Lisuarte to save him, though he had only a\nbroken sword. Gadancuriel cut through the helmet and wounded him in the\nhead, he with his broken sword smote him on the helmet so that it fell\noff, and then Lisuarte cleft his head; there was none other left to\nmaintain the field: they who fled perished before they could reach the\nwater, or in the water before they could reach their ships.\n\nThen Amadis cried to Florestan and Agrayes, weeping as he spake, Good\nkinsmen, I fear we have lost Don Galaor, let us seek for him. They went\nto the spot where Amadis had smitten down King Cildadan, and seen his\nbrother last on foot; but so many were the dead who lay there that they\nsaw him not, till as they moved away the bodies, Florestan knew him\nby the sleeve of his surcoat, which was of azure worked with silver\nflowers, and then they made great moan over him. But when Amadis saw\nhim thus with exceeding grief he threw himself from his horse, and his\nwounds over which the blood had clotted burst open with the fall, and\nbled abundantly, and he laying aside his shield and helm that were\nall hacked and bruised, went to Galaor and took off his helmet, and\ntook his head upon his knees. Galaor at the fresh air began to move a\nlittle, and they all gathered round him weeping to see him thus. While\nthey were thus standing twelve Damsels richly apparelled came up, and\nsome Squires with them, who brought a bed covered with rich drapery.\nThe Damsels knelt before Amadis and said, Sir, we are come hither for\nDon Galaor, if you would have him live give him to us: if not, all the\nMasters in Great Britain cannot help him. Amadis knew not the Damsels,\nand he saw the great danger of Galaor, and could not tell what to do;\nbut those Knights advised him to trust his brother to this fortune,\nrather than see him die without any possibility of saving him. Good\nDamsels, said Amadis, may I know whither you would carry him? They\nanswered, not as yet; but if you desire his life give him to us; else\nwe must go our way. Then Amadis besought that they would take him also;\nthis they refused, but at his request they suffered Ardian the Dwarf,\nand his Squire to follow them. Then they laid him in the bed, armed as\nhe was, all except his helmet and gauntlets, and half dead; and Amadis\nand the Knights followed them, weeping, to the shore. A ship was ready\nthere in which the Damsels placed him, and then returned and went to\nKing Lisuarte, and besought him that he would be pleased to give them\nKing Cildadan also, who lay among the dead, bidding him remember that\nhe was a good King, and had suffered this evil in doing what he was\nbound to do: and they prayed the King to have pity upon him, that he\nmight look for pity himself in his need. Lisuarte readily assented.\nThey took up Cildadan more dead than alive, and carried him in the same\nbed on board, then made sail, and were speedily out of sight.\n\nMeantime Lisuarte had secured the enemies fleet that nothing might\nescape, taking prisoners all who were not slain in battle. He now came\nup to Amadis, and the Knights that were weeping with him, and when he\nheard their lamentation was for the loss of Galaor, he was grieved at\nheart, for Galaor had faithfully and affectionately served him from the\nhour wherein he became his Knight; then he dismounted, his armour being\nall stained with blood, and embraced Amadis, and bade him take comfort,\nfor God would not suffer such a man as his brother to perish. They\nall then went to the tent of King Cildadan, and there took food, and\nhe ordered that all the Knights who had fallen on his side should be\nburied in a monastery that was at the foot of a near mountain, and he\nordered the due service for their souls, and assigned rents for masses\nfor them. Moreover he ordered a stately chapel to be built there, and\nrich monuments therein for them, and that their names should all be\nengraved upon their tombs. Messengers were sent to inform Queen Brisena\nof his good fortune, and he and his Knights then went to Ganota, a\ntown four leagues off, and there they remained till their wounds were\nhealed.\n\nWhile this battle was expected Queen Briolania went to visit Oriana\nat Miraflores. Oriana had her apartments hung with rich hangings to\nreceive a guest whom she so greatly desired to see. When they met both\nwere somewhat abashed, for neither the proof of the Enchanted Arch,\nnor of the Green Sword, could keep Oriana's heart so calm, but that it\nbeat fast with fear, thinking that no affection, how true soever, could\nresist such beauty as she saw before her. And Briolania, who had seen\nthe tears and thoughtfulness of Amadis, and knew what proof of love he\nhad given at the Firm Island, presently concluded it could be only for\nthis Princess, before whom she felt her own beauty even as nothing. So\nas they were freely communing together, Briolania related at length all\nthat Amadis had done for her, and said how in her heart she loved him.\nOriana then willing to learn farther, asked her why, as they were of\nequal rank, and she at her own disposal, she did not make him master of\nherself and her own dominions? Friend and Lady, replied Briolania, much\nas you have seen him, I think you know him not. Do you not believe I\nshould think myself the happiest woman in the world if this could be?\nBut you shall know all\u00e2\u0080\u0094and keep it I pray you secret, as one like you\nshould do. I ventured upon this proposal, and it shames me whenever I\nremember it, but he replied, that he could neither bear affection to\nme nor to any other; the which I then believed, for unlike all other\nKnights, I never heard him speak of woman. You tell me wonders, quoth\nOriana, glad at heart of what she heard; but unless Amadis loved some\none he could not have passed under the Arch of True Lovers, which yet\nshowed him more honour than ever any other had received. He may love,\nreplied Briolania, but in his love he is the most secret that ever yet\nKnight was.\n\nBriolania remained ten days with Oriana, and then they both went\nto join Queen Brisena at Fenusa, a town, where she was waiting for\nLisuarte. Greatly rejoiced was she to see her daughter so recovered.\nThere the tidings came of the victory, for joy whereat Brisena gave\ngreat alms to the churches and convents, and to those who were in\nwant. But who can tell what joy there was to hear that Beltenebros was\nAmadis! What think you now of Amadis, quoth Briolania to Oriana, who\naffected the same surprise as the rest; I was in doubt whether he or\nBeltenebros most deserved my love. Queen and Lady, replied Oriana, we\nwill ask him when he comes, wherefore he changed his name, and who the\nDamsel is that won the garland of flowers.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER 17._\n\n\nNow you shall know what became of King Cildadan and Galaor. The\nDamsels who removed them dressed their wounds, and on the third day\nthey recovered their senses. Galaor found himself in a rich room,\nwhich stood upon four marble pillars, and had an iron grating on all\nsides, through which he saw that he was in a garden, surrounded with\na high wall, in which was only one little door covered with plates\nof iron. Astonished to find himself in such a place, he thought he\nwas in prison, and felt such pain from his wounds that he expected\nnothing but death; and he remembered the battle, but knew not who had\ncarried him from it, nor how he had been removed there. King Cildadan\nalso, when he came to himself, saw that he was lying in a rich bed in\nthe vaulted chamber of a large tower. He looked round and saw no one,\nneither door nor any entrance into the chamber, but over the arch he\nheard voices. There was a window near his bed from whence he looked\nout and saw the sea, and it seemed that the tower he was in was a high\ntower upon a rock, and that the sea washed it on three sides. He too\nremembered the battle but nothing more: but he well knew that if he was\nthus a prisoner, his friends could not be in better plight, and seeing\nno remedy, lay down again in bed, groaning and in great pain with his\nwounds.\n\nDon Galaor, as he was lying in the open chamber, saw the little door\nof the garden wall open, and raised his head with great difficulty;\nthere came in a Damsel very fair and richly apparalled, and with her\na man so feeble and old that it was a wonder how he could walk, they\ncame up to the iron grating, and said to him, Don Galaor, look to your\nsoul, for we cannot warrant you. The Damsel then produced two little\nboxes, one of iron the other of silver, and showing them to Galaor,\nsaid, She who brought you here wills not that you should die till she\nknows whether you will perform her will; if so, your wounds shall be\nhealed, and you shall have food. Good Damsel, replied he, if what she\ndesire be any thing that I ought not to do, it will be worse than\ndeath. Do as you please, quoth she, we care little for your answer:\nit is at your own choice to live or die. The old man then opened the\ndoor of the grating, and they both went in, and she took the box of\niron, and told the old man to withdraw, and then she said to Galaor,\nSir, I have such compassion on you, that I will venture my own life\nto save yours. I have been ordered to fill this box with poison, and\nthe other with an ointment to make you sleep; the poison being then\nrubbed into your wounds will act more instantly and you would presently\ndie; but instead of this I have put here a remedy, the which, if you\ntake it daily for seven days, will so heal you, that by that time you\nshall be wholly recovered, and able to ride on horseback as before. She\nthen applied the ointment to his wounds, and the pain was instantly\nassuaged. Good Damsel, quoth he, you do so greatly bind me to your\nservice, that if by your help I may escape from hence, never was Damsel\nso well guerdoned by Knight as you shall be: but if you have not means\nfor this and yet wish to serve me, contrive that Urganda the Unknown\nmay know in what perilous prison I am laid, for in her I have great\nhope. The Damsel then began to laugh\u00e2\u0080\u0094what hope can you have in Urganda,\nwho cares little for your weal or woe? So much, replied Galaor, that\nas she knows the wishes of all, she knows how greatly it is my wish to\nserve her. The Damsel then answered, Look for no other Urganda than\nme, Don Galaor; and take you good hope, for it is the part of courage,\nnot only to encounter danger, but to endure its after-chances for the\ndanger in which I place myself to heal you, and deliver you from hence,\nI ask one boon, which shall be neither to your dishonour nor hurt. I\ngrant, quoth he, all that may rightly be performed. Now then, said she,\nit is time to depart, lie you down, and feign to sleep soundly. He\ndid accordingly; she called the old man and said, Look how he sleeps!\nNow the poison will work. So it ought, quoth the old man, that he who\nbrought him here may be avenged. Since you have obeyed so well you may\ncome alone for the future, and see that you keep him fifteen days, that\nhe die not, but live in great agony, and by that time they will be here\nwho shall make him atone for the wrongs he hath done them. When Galaor\nheard this he found that the old man was his mortal enemy, howbeit he\ntook hope for what she had said to him. The old man and the Damsel then\nwent out of the garden; presently she returned, and brought with her\ntwo little girls, fair girls and well apparelled, who took food for\nGalaor; and she let them into the chamber to keep him company, and gave\nthem books of history to read to him, that he might not sleep by day,\nand then she fastened the door and left them.\n\nKing Cildadan in the tower saw also a door open in the wall, a stone\ndoor so neatly fitted that it looked like the wall itself, and a Dame\nof middle age entered with two armed Knights, and approached the bed\nwithout saluting him; he on his part spake to them with courteous\nsalutation, but they answered not. The Dame took off the bed cloaths,\nand applied salves to his wounds, then gave him food, and they went\nout again and fastened the stone door, not having spoken a word. The\nKing thought that verily he was in prison, and where his life was not\nsecure; howbeit having no remedy, he took as good comfort as he could.\n\nWhen it was time the Damsel returned to Galaor, and asked him how he\nfared? So well, quoth he, that if it proceed so I shall be in good\nplight by the time you promised. Doubt not, said she, that what I have\nsaid shall be accomplished. But you must promise me the boon as a\nloyal Knight, for only by my help can you escape; the attempt would be\nto your mortal danger and hurt, and you could not effect it at last.\nThat Galaor promised, and he besought her to tell him her name. What,\nquoth she, Don Galaor, know you not my name? I am deceived in you! Time\nwas that I did you a service, which it seems you little remember. They\ncall me the Wise[261:A] among the wisest. With that she departed, and\nhe remained thinking who she might be; and remembering the good sword\nwhich Urganda had given him when he was knighted by Amadis, he thought\nit should be her, but Urganda was old, and this was a Damsel. He looked\nfor the two little girls and they were gone, but in their stead he saw\nhis Squire Gasavel, and Ardian the Dwarf of Amadis, both sleeping. He\njoyfully called them, they awoke; and when they saw who was there ran\nweeping for joy to kiss his hand, and exclaimed, O good Sir! blessed be\nGod who has brought us here to serve you! He asked them how they came\nthere: they replied, they knew not; only that Amadis and Agrayes, and\nFlorestan, had sent them with him. Amadis, quoth he, was he found at\nsuch a time? Sir, said they, know that Beltenebros is your own brother\nAmadis, and that by his prowess the battle was won. Thou tellest me\ngreat things, cried Galaor, and great pleasure have I therein, though\nhe has not given me cause for pleasure in keeping himself so long\nconcealed from me. Thus abode King Cildadan and Don Galaor: the one\nin that great Tower, the other in the Garden-chamber, where they were\nboth healed of their hurts. Then Urganda made herself known to them,\nfor they were in her power in her Undiscovered Island; and she told\nthem that the fear wherein she had put them was to effect their cure\nmore speedily, for in their perilous state it so behoved. And she sent\ntwo Damsels to attend them and compleat their recovery; they were her\nnieces and fair Damsels, being the daughters of King Falangris, who\nwas brother to Lisuarte by Grimota, Urganda's sister; by him begotten\nwhen he was a young batchelor. The one was called Julianda, the other\nSolisa: and it so chanced that the one bore a son named Talanque, to\nDon Galaor, and the other a son to King Cildadan, who was called Maneli\nthe discreet, who were both valiant and strong Knights, and in this\nstate of great pleasure these two Knights remained till it pleased\nUrganda to set them at liberty, as you shall hear hereafter.\n\n    [261:A] Sabencia sobre sabencia.\n\nWhen Lisuarte and Amadis, and the other Knights were all whole of their\nwounds, he went to Fenusa, where the Queen then sojourned, and there\nwas he received with such joy by her, and by Briolania and Oriana, and\nthe other Dames and Damsels, as never welcomed man before. But the\njoyful greeting which Queen Briolania gave to Amadis, that can in no\nway be written; she taking him by the hand made him sit between her\nand Oriana, and she said to him, my Lord, the grief and sorrow which\nI felt when they told me you were lost I cannot relate to you. I came\nhither with an hundred Knights immediately that your brothers might\norder them whither they would in your search, and because this battle\ndelayed their departure, I resolved to remain here till it was decided.\nNow then direct me what I shall do, and it shall be done. Good Lady\nmine, quoth Amadis, if you felt sorrow for my mishap, great reason had\nyou: for there is no man in the world who hath a better will to obey\nyou; but since you desire me to direct you, I would have you abide here\nten days, and dispatch your business with the King; in that time we may\nknow something of my brother Don Galaor, and there will be a battle\nwhich has been appointed between Don Florestan and Landin, after that\nI will conduct you to your kingdom, and from thence I must go to the\nFirm Island, where I have much to do. So let it be, replied Briolania,\nand I beseech you tell us the wonders which you found in that Island.\nHe would have excused himself, but Oriana took his hand and said,\nYou shall not leave us till you have told us something of them. Good\nLadies, quoth Amadis, trust me, labour however I should, I could never\nrelate all; but this I say, that that Forbidden Chamber is the most\nrich and beautifullest thing in the world, and if by one of you it is\nnot atchieved, I believe none else will ever win it. Briolania, after\na while of silence, answered, I do not esteem myself such a one as can\naccomplish that adventure, yet such as I am, if you will not impute it\nto folly, I will prove it. Lady, quoth Amadis, I hold it no folly to\nattempt that wherein all have failed for want of beauty, especially\nin you whom God hath gifted so bountifully therewith, rather I hold\nit honourable to desire to win a fame which may endure through long\nages. At this was Oriana greatly displeased, and her countenance fell,\nso that Amadis, whose eyes never left her, understood her feelings,\nand repented him of what he had said, albeit that all his design had\nbeen to her greater praise, for having seen the likeness of Grimanesa\nhe knew that Briolania, fair as she was, did not equal her beauty,\nand of his own Lady's success he nothing doubted. But Oriana feared\nthat whatever was to be won by beauty Briolania could win, and having\nrequested her if she succeeded to let her know all the wonders of\nthe Chamber, she withdrew, and went to Mabilia and told her what had\npassed. This always is the case with your Cousin, said she, my poor\nheart thinks only of pleasing him, neither regarding God nor the anger\nof my parents, and he knowing his full power holds me at little price,\nand then the tears came and coursed down her fair cheeks. Mabilia\nanswered, I marvel Lady what manner of heart is yours! you are no\nsooner out of one trouble than you seek another. What great wrong is\nthis that my Cousin hath committed? If Apolidon left this Chamber to be\nproved by all, shall he forbid the proof to Briolania? Certes I believe\nthat neither her beauty nor yours will avail to accomplish that which\nnone in a hundred years for lack of beauty could effect. But this is\nhis over-ruling destiny that hath made him forsake all his lineage for\nyour service, and thus it is you reward him; you do not desire his\nlife, and will therefore drive him to death. This will be his reward!\nand mine, for all the friendship I have borne you, will be to see the\nflower of all my family, him who so dearly loves me, perish before my\neyes. This will I never remain to see: for my brother Agrayes, and\nGalvanes my Uncle, shall take me home to my own country! and with that\nshe wept and exclaimed, God grant that this cruelty toward Amadis may\nbe well requited to you, and this wrong you do his friends! but their\nloss, great though it be, will be less than yours, destroying him who\nfor your sake has deserted them, to give himself wholly to you. When\nMabilia spake thus Oriana's heart was so overcharged that she could not\nspeak, till at last the tears came, and she cried, wretch that I am\nabove all others! I came to you for relief and you increase my sorrow,\nsuspecting that which was never in my heart! Let God never help me if\never I had such thought! but what distresses me is, lest another woman\nshould accomplish that proof which would be to me worse than death, and\nthis fear has made me think wrongly of him who perhaps had but good\nin his intention: but come\u00e2\u0080\u0094forgive me\u00e2\u0080\u0094and for the love you bear your\nCousin advise me! And then with a sweet smile she embraced Mabilia,\nTrue friend and dearest, I promise you I will never speak of this to\nyour Cousin, nor let him know that I have had such a thought, but say\nyou to him what you think best. Mabilia answered, I will forgive you on\none condition, that whatever anger you conceive against him you never\ndiscover it to him till you have first consulted me, that no evil like\nthe past may happen again. With this were they well reconciled, between\nwhom there could never be a want of love.\n\nBut Mabilia sharply reprehended Amadis, and warned him to be wary in\nhis conduct to Briolania, remembering what he had suffered on her\naccount, and how difficult it is to root out jealousy from a woman's\nheart. Amadis replied, Lady and good Cousin, my thoughts were very\ndifferent. Briolania is held by all for one of the most beautiful\nwomen in the world, so they make no doubt she can enter the Forbidden\nChamber, but I who have seen the likeness of Grimanesa know that it\nwill not be so. That honour which any one hitherto has won, that\ncertainly will Briolania win: but Oriana has only to try and to\nsucceed. But if Oriana atchieves the adventure before Briolania has\nessayed it, all will say that the other would have won had she been\nfirst; on the contrary, when she will have failed, as sure I am she\nmust fail, my Lady will have her full glory. Well was Oriana satisfied\nat hearing this, and greatly repented her of her fault, to atone for\nwhich they appointed that Amadis should come to her apartment, through\nan old water way that issued into a garden. Presently Oriana and\nBriolania called Amadis, and requested him to answer them truly what\nthey should ask, the which he promised. Tell us then, said Oriana, who\nthe Damsel was who won the garland when you gained the sword? Then was\nAmadis grieved at the question because he was bound to answer it truly.\nAs God shall help me Lady, said he, I know no more of her name than you\ndo, though I was seven days in her company; but this I can say, that\nshe had beautiful locks, and as far as I could see was right fair. Thus\nwas Oriana sporting with him, when there came a Damsel to summon him\non the King's part, saying, that Don Quadragante and his nephew Landin\nwere come to acquit themselves of their promises. Being all assembled\nQuadragante rose and said, I come to discharge a promise made to\nAmadis of Gaul; and he then related how they had done battle together,\nand added, that both by the event of that battle, and by reason\nhe was bound to forgive him the death of King Abies, who had been\nslain in fair combat, and to receive him for a friend even in what\ndegree it pleased him. Then Amadis embraced him and thanked him; and\nnotwithstanding this friendship appeared a thing constrained, yet did\nit long and faithfully continue. And because Florestan and Landin were\nto fight upon the same quarrel, it was judged, that since Quadragante,\nwho was principal in the cause had forgiven it, their dispute should\ncease; the which pleased Landin not a little, for he had witnessed the\nprowess of Florestan in the great battle.\n\nKing Lisuarte now called to mind the cruel prison of King Arban of\nNorth Wales, and Angriote of Estravaus, and determined to pass over\nto the Island of Mongaza to deliver them; this resolution he imparted\nto his Knights. Then Amadis answered, Sir, you know what loss to your\nservice is the absence of Don Galaor; if it please you I and my brother\nand my cousins will go in search of him, and if it please God return\nwith him by the time that you make this voyage. The King replied, God\nknows with what good will I myself would seek him, if so many things\ndid not prevent me, since I cannot, do what you say. Then more than\nan hundred Knights arose, all good men in arms, and said that they\nwould enter upon that quest, for in no worthier adventure could they\nbe employed. Thereat was King Lisuarte well pleased, and he besought\nAmadis not to depart, for he would speak with him.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER 18._\n\n\nAfter supper, it being almost the hour of sleep, as the King was in\nthe gallery looking toward the sea, he saw two fires coming on through\nthe water, whereat all were greatly astonished, marvelling how the\nfire and water could exist together. As they drew nearer, a galley was\nseen between the two fires, and on its mast there were great torches\nburning, so that the whole vessel seemed ablaze. The uproar was great,\nfor all the people ran to the walls to see this wonder, expecting that\nif the water could not quench this fire nothing else could, and the\ncity would surely be consumed; so they were greatly terrified. The\nQueen with all her Ladies went in their fear to the chapel, and the\nKing mounted, and with his guard of fifty Knights rode down to the\nshore, and found there the most part of his Knights, and in the front\nof all Amadis, and Guilan the Pensive, and Enil, so near the fires\nthat he wondered how they could endure them; then spurring his horse,\nwhom the tumult had frightened, he rode up to them. Presently he saw\ncome from under a cloth that covered the deck a Dame clad in white\nholding a golden casket in her hands, the which she opened and took out\na lighted candle and threw it into the sea, where it was extinguished.\nAt once the two great fires were quenched so that no trace of them\nremained, only the torches upon the mast remained burning, and cast\na light along the shore. Then was the cloth which covered the galley\nwithdrawn, and they saw how it was all hung with green boughs, and\nstrewed with roses and flowers, and they heard instruments within\nsounding very sweetly; and when the instruments ceased, ten Damsels\ncame forth, all richly garmented, with garlands on their heads and\nwands of gold in their hands, and before them was the Lady who had\nquenched the candle in the sea: and they coming to the galley's edge\nopposite to the King made obeisance to him, and he on his part returned\nthe greeting. Then said Lisuarte, Dame, you have put us in great fear\nwith your fires, if it please you tell me who you are, though I believe\nwith little difficulty we can divine. Sir, quoth she, in vain should he\nlabour who strove to strike fear into your great heart, and into these\nKnights in whom no fear is; these fires I bring to protect me and my\nDamsels: and if you think I am Urganda the Unknown, you think aright;\nI come to you as the best King in the world, and to behold the Queen,\nwho for virtue and goodness hath no peer. Then said she to Amadis, Sir,\ndraw nearer, and I will tell you of your brother Galaor to save you\nand your friends the labour of searching him; for though all in the\nworld were to seek him it would be but labour lost: he is healed of his\nwounds, and leads a life of such pleasure as he never till now enjoyed.\nLady, quoth Amadis, I always thought that next to God the safety of Don\nGalaor was in your hands, else would I rather have died than suffer him\nto be carried from me as he was. You shall soon see him, quoth she. The\nKing then said, it is time that you should leave the galley and come\nto my palace. Many thanks, she answered, but this night I will remain\nhere, to-morrow I will be at your command; then let Amadis and Agrayes,\nand Don Bruneo of Bonamar, and Don Guilan the Pensive come for me, for\nthey are all lovers and of high heart, even as I am myself. Use your\nown pleasure, replied Lisuarte, in this and every thing; then ordering\nall the people to return into the town he took his leave, and appointed\ntwenty cross-bowmen to keep guard that none should go down to the\nshore.\n\nIn the morning the Queen sent twelve palfreys richly accoutred for\nUrganda and her Damsels. Amadis and the other Knights whom she had\nnamed, being clothed in costly garments, went with them; they found\nUrganda and her company in a tent which she had pitched upon the sand,\nand they placed them on their palfreys, and went towards the town,\nthe four Knights surrounding Urganda. Now, said she, is my heart\nglad, because I see those around me who are like myself, and this she\nsaid because of the love she bore to that fair Knight who was her\nfriend. When they arrived at the palace the King welcomed her right\ncourteously, and she kissed his hand; and looking round and beholding\nthe Knights on every side how many they were, she said, Sir, you are\nwell accompanied, and this I say, not so much for the valour of these\nKnights as for the love they bear you, for when princes are loved by\ntheir people then are their kingdoms safe. Therefore preserve their\nlove, and beware of evil counsellors! Now if it please you I will see\nthe Queen. So she and the four Knights went to Brisena, by whom and\nby Oriana, and Briolania, and all the Dames and Damsels, she was\nlovingly received. Much did she admire the beauty of Briolania, and\nsaw that it fell far short of Oriana's perfection. Lady, quoth she,\nI came to this court to see the greatness of the King and you, the\nheight of prowess and the flower of beauty, and the perfection of true\nlove; for as valour was proved in the conquest of the Firm Island,\nand in the death of the giants, and in that dolorous battle with King\nCildadan, so was true love in the proofs of the burning sword and of\nthe garland. When Oriana heard her say this her colour changed, and she\ngreatly feared, as did Mabilia and the Damsel of Denmark, fearing that\nUrganda should tell all; and Oriana looked at Amadis, but he seeing her\napprehension drew near to her and said, fear nothing, she will not say\nwhat you imagine; and then he went to the Queen and said, Lady, ask\nUrganda who she was who won the garland, and the Queen replied, if it\nplease you friend, tell us what Amadis desires to know! She smiled and\nanswered, he better ought to know than I for he was in her company, and\nwith great toil delivered her from Arcalaus and Lindoraque. I? quoth\nAmadis; it cannot be that I should know either her or myself better\nthan you know us, for from you nothing is concealed. Then, said she,\nI will tell you what you know of her, and raising her voice that all\nmight hear her she pursued: Though Amadis brought her here as a Damsel\nshe is certainly no Damsel: and because she loves so truly she won\nthe garland. She is a native of this kingdom, and in this kingdom she\ndwells and hath here her heirship; but her mother is not of this land;\nand if she lacks any thing it is only because she cannot have him whom\nshe loveth. He who would discover her must seek her in this kingdom,\nand he will lose his labour. She said no more, and Oriana's heart was\nthen at rest. Then went they to their meal.\n\nUrganda besought the Queen that she might be lodged with Oriana and\nQueen Briolania. That shall you, replied Brisena, but I believe their\nfollies will disquiet you. Their beauty, quoth Urganda, will more\ndisquiet the Knights, whose valour cannot protect them against that\ndanger. They may easily, replied the Queen, be pardoned the deaths of\nall they have yet slain! So taking her leave Urganda went to Oriana's\napartment, where there were four beds, one for Briolania, and one for\nMabilia, and for Urganda and herself. When Urganda saw that they were\nall asleep except Oriana, she said to her, Lady and friend, if you do\nnot sleep reason it is that he should keep you waking who has no rest\nbut in your sight. Oriana was abashed at her words: but she added, fear\nnothing, I will not divulge your secrets. Speak low, cried Oriana, that\nthey may not hear you. I will relieve you of that fear, quoth Urganda;\ntherewithall she took forth a book which was so little that a hand\nmight have shut over it, and began to read. Now, said she, do what you\nwill they shall not awake, and if any one should enter the room she\nwould fall down asleep. Oriana rose and went to awaken Briolania but\nshe could not, and she laughed and took her by the head and hands and\npulled her out of bed, and did the same to Mabilia, but they neither of\nthem awakened; and then she called the Damsel of Denmark, who was just\nwithout the door, and she, so soon as she entered, fell upon the floor\nin a deep sleep. Then Oriana joyfully went into Urganda's bed and said,\nI beseech you, since you know what is to come, tell me what will happen\nto me! Urganda looked at her and smiled. Dear daughter, said she, do\nyou think to escape it, if it be evil, by knowing it aforehand? Believe\nnot so! for that which is permitted and ordained by the Most High none\ncan alter, whether it be good or ill, unless he remedies it; but since\nyou so greatly wish me to say something I will speak: look now, if\nwhen you have the knowledge you can profit by it! At that time, when\ngreat sorrow shall be present with you, and many shall because of you\nbe greatly afflicted, the strong Lion with his beasts shall come forth,\nand with his loud roaring shall in such sort astonish those who have\nyou in their keeping, that you shall be left in his strong talons. And\nthe famous Lion shall throw from your head the lofty crown which shall\nno longer be yours, and the hungry Lion having your body in his power\nshall bear it into his den that his extreme famine may be slacked. Now\ndaughter dear look how you act, for this must come to pass! Lady, quoth\nOriana, I should have been better content if I had not enquired, for\nyou have made me in great terror of this strange and cruel end. Lady\nand daughter fair, replied Urganda, seek not to know that which neither\nyour prudence nor strength can avert. Of these dark things men often\ndread that for which they ought to be joyful. Meantime be you happy,\nfor God has made you daughter of the best King and Queen in the world,\nand has gifted you with such beauty that it is ever spoken of as a\nwonder, and has made that Knight love you, who shines above all other\nin prowess, even as day above darkness. Now it is time to awaken these\nladies; she then opened her book again, and read, and they recovered.\n\nAfter some days Urganda besought the King to summon all his Knights,\nand the Queen to assemble her Dames and Damsels, that she might speak\nto them before her departure; accordingly they met together in a\nspacious hall that was richly furnished, and Urganda placed herself\nwhere all might hear her. Then she said to the King, Sir, since you\nhave kept the letters which I sent to you and Don Galaor just after\nBeltenebros had won the sword, I beseech you let them be produced, that\nall here may know that I knew what was to come to pass. The letters\nwere then read, and it was seen how all had been accomplished, whereat\nthe Knights marvelled, and still more admired the courage of the King\nwho, notwithstanding that fearful forewarning, had dared enter the\nbattle. In like sort was it certainly known that by three strokes from\nBeltenebros the battle was won; the first when he felled King Cildadan\nat Galaor's feet, the second when he slew Sarmadan the Lion, the third\nwhen succouring the King he lopt off the arm of Madanfabul the fierce\ngiant of the Vermilion Tower. That also was fulfilled which had been\nwritten of Don Galaor, that his head should be in the power of him who\nshould strike the three strokes, for so it was when Amadis held it\nin his lap as dead. Now, said Urganda, I will tell what shall come\nto pass in process of time. Contention shall arise between the great\nSerpent and the strong Lion, in which many fierce beasts shall take\npart; anger and fury shall come upon them, so that many shall suffer\ncruel death. The great Roman Fox shall be wounded by the claw of the\nstrong Lion, and his skin cruelly torn, whereby a part of the great\nSerpent shall be in great affliction. In that time the gentle Sheep\ncovered with black wool shall come between them, who by his humble\nand loving blandishments shall assuage the fury of their hearts. But\npresently the Wolves shall come down from the mountains against the\ngreat Serpent, who being with all his animals by them conquered, shall\nbe blocked up in one of his dens; and the tender Unicorn putting his\nmouth to the ear of the strong Lion shall rouse him from his sleep, and\nmake him hasten to the succour of the great Serpent, whom he shall find\nso wounded and bitten that the blood shall flow over his scales, and he\nshall deliver him from the mouths of the Wolves, and they shall all be\ndestroyed. Then the great Serpent having his life restored, and casting\nall his poison from his entrails shall consent that the white Doe shall\nbe placed in the cruel talons of the Lion. Now good King, let all this\nbe written, for so it must be. The King said it should be done, albeit\nhe understood it not. Time will come, she answered, when it shall be\nmanifest to all. Then looking at Amadis, who was musing, she said,\nAmadis, you muse upon that which cannot avail you: let that be, and\nthink of a bargain you have to make. At that time you shall be brought\nnear to death for another's life, and for another's blood shall expend\nyour own, and of that bargain the martyrdom will be yours, and another\nwill have the gain; and the guerdon which you shall have will be wrath\nand the long delay of your will; then shall that keen and beautiful\nsword so pierce thy flesh and bones that you shall be poor of blood,\nand in such plight that if half the world were yours you would give it\nso that that sword were broken or thrown into some lake from whence it\ncould never be recovered. Look to it! for so it must be. Amadis saw\nthat all eyes were upon him, and he answered chearfully as he felt.\nLady, by what you have said of the past we may believe this also, but\nI knowing that I am mortal, and that my life cannot be prolonged one\nminute longer than it pleaseth God, am desirous to end it justly in\nsome great and honourable enterprize. It were as easy, quoth Urganda,\nto rob your heart of its courage as to drain the sea dry. Then said she\nto the King, Sir, I must depart; remember what I have said as one who\ndesire your honour and would serve you,\u00e2\u0080\u0094shut your ears to those whose\nworks you know to be evil! With that she departed, suffering none but\nthe four Knights whom she had chosen to conduct her to the shore; then\nshe embarked, and the ship put forth to sea, and was presently covered\nwith a great darkness.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER 19._\n\n\nSome few days after, as King Lisuarte was consulting with his Knights\nabout the passage which he would make to the Isle of Mongaza, to\ndeliver King Arban of North Wales, and Angriote of Estravaus, they saw\na ship making toward the port, and went thither to see whom it brought.\nWhen they came near a Damsel and two Squires were in the boat, and when\nthey landed the Damsel asked if King Lisuarte were there? They answered\nyes, but they were all astonished at her greatness, for there was not a\nKnight in the court who equalled her by a full palm in stature, and her\nfeatures and limbs were in proportion; she was fair enough, and richly\nattired. Sir, said she to Lisuarte, I bring you a message which, if it\nplease you, I would deliver before the Queen. Be it so, said the King,\nand he returned to the palace, and the Damsel with him. Then being in\npresence of the Queen and of all the Knights and Ladies of the Court,\nshe asked if Amadis of Gaul were there, he who had called himself\nBeltenebros. He answered, good Damsel I am he. She looked at him with\nan evil eye and said, you may well be he! but now it will be seen if\nyou are as good as you are famous! Then she produced two letters with\nseals of gold; the one she gave the King, the other to the Queen; they\nwere letters of credence, and the King bade her say her bidding.\n\nSir, quoth the Damsel, Gromadaza, the Giantess of the Boiling Lake,\nand the fair Madasima, and Ardan Canileo the Dreadful, who is with\nthem for their defender, know that you design to come against their\ncountry, and as that cannot be attempted without great loss, they are\nwilling to put it upon trial of a battle in this guise, that Ardan\nCanileo shall combat Amadis of Gaul. If he conquer or slay him the\nland shall be free, and he shall be allowed to carry his head to the\nBoiling Lake; if he be conquered or slain himself, the land shall be\nyours, and King Arban of North Wales, and Angriote of Estravaus shall\nbe delivered. They shall be brought hither, and if Amadis loves them\nas they believe, and will fulfill the hope they have in him, he will\naccept the battle to deliver two such friends; if he be conquered,\nArdan Canileo will still hold them prisoners, and if he will not accept\nthe defiance he shall presently see their heads cut off before him.\nGood Damsel, quoth Amadis, if I accept the battle, how shall the King\nbe certain that the terms will be accomplished? She answered, the fair\nMadasima, with twelve Damsels of great birth, will put themselves as\nprisoners in the Queen's power, in security that the terms shall be\nobserved, otherwise they are content to lose their heads, and they\ndemand no other assurance than that she may carry away your head if\nyou be overcome; and moreover the old giant Andanguel and his two\nsons will enter the King's prisons, and nine Knights beside, who have\nthe towns and castles of the Island in their keeping. Said Amadis, if\nthis be done the security is sufficient; but from me you shall have\nno answer unless you and your Squires come and eat with me. Why do\nyou invite us? quoth she; this is no wisdom, your trouble will all be\nlost, for I hate you to death. Good Damsel, said Amadis, I am sorry\ntherefore, for I love you, and will show you all the honour that I can;\nif you desire to be answered you must grant this. I grant it, quoth\nshe, more to get my answer than for any good will. Then said Amadis,\ngood Damsel to venture myself for two such friends, and to increase\nthe dominions of the King is a just thing, and therefore I undertake\nthe battle in the name of God, let therefore those whom you have named\ncome as hostages. Truly you have answered to my will, replied the\nDamsel; but let the King promise, that if you fail to perform your word\nhe will never protect you against the kindred of Famongomadan. That\npromise, quoth Amadis, may be excused, the King would have no one in\nhis company who lacked truth: now let us go eat, for it is time.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I will\ngo, more joyfully than I expected; to-morrow Madasima and her Damsels\nwill be here, and the Knights will put themselves in the King's hands,\nfor Ardan Canileo would have the battle without delay; but you must\ngive him a safe conduct from all but Amadis, whose head he will take\nfrom hence. Don Bruneo of Bonamar answered, Lady Damsel, sometimes it\nhappens that he who thinks to take away anothers head loses his own,\nand so it may fall out to Ardan Canileo. Amadis besought him to be\nsilent, but the Damsel replied to Bruneo, who are you who speak for\nAmadis? A Knight, quoth he, who would willingly bear a part in the\nbattle if Ardan Canileo will bring a companion. She answered, you may\nbe excused from that battle, but if you are desirous of combat, after\nthat is finished I will produce a brother of mine to answer you, as\nmuch the mortal enemy of Amadis as you are his friend, and one who will\nprevent you from taking up the quarrel again. Good Damsel, quoth Don\nBruneo, your brother had need be as you boast to perform all that you\nhave promised! See, here is my gage that I defy him, and he stretched\nout the end of his cloak towards the King. The Damsel took a silver net\nfrom her head\u00e2\u0080\u0094here Sir, you see mine that I will make good my words.\nThe King took the pledges, though against his will, for he thought the\ncombat of Amadis against Ardan Canileo enough to trouble him, for that\nenemy was so dreadful that for four years he had found no Knight hardy\nenough to do battle against him.\n\nThis being settled Amadis took the Damsel to his lodgings, which he\nought not to have done for the best castle in his father's lands; and\nto do her more honour he lodged her in the Chamber where Gandalin kept\nhis arms and accoutrements. She looking round saw the sword of Amadis,\nand seeing how strange a one it was, she told her two Squires, and\nthe others who were present, to leave her alone[288:A] for a little\nwhile; when they were gone she drew the sword, and leaving the sheath\nand belt so that the theft might not be discovered, she wrapt it under\nher mantle; then opening the door she gave it secretly to one of her\nSquires under his cloak, and bade him carry it to the vessel\u00e2\u0080\u0094this she\nspake softly; then spake aloud, go bring me my cup! and all present\nthought that the Squire was sent for that. Then Amadis and Branfil\nentered, and they made the Damsel be seated on the Estrado, and\nAmadis asked at what hour of the morrow Madasima would arrive.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Before\nbreakfast: but why ask you?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Because we would go out to receive her and\nshow her every honour, that if she have received any displeasure from\nme I may make her such amends as she shall demand. If you keep your\npromise, quoth she, and Ardan Canileo be what he always hath been in\narms, you will give her your head for amends; any other amends will\nbe good for little. That, said Amadis, I shall keep if I can; but if\nit could be I should gladly obtain her pardon. With that he went out,\nleaving Enil and others to attend her, but she was so desirous to be\ngone, that the number of dishes provoked her, and as soon as the cloths\nwere removed she rose and said to Enil, Knight, tell Amadis that I am\ngone, and that all the pains he has taken to please me are lost. God\nsave me, quoth Enil, as I believe it! and whoever should strive to\nplease such a one as you would lose his pains. She answered, you please\nme little, and he still less! Enil replied, neither he nor I nor any\none else can like so insolent a Damsel. With these words they parted.\n\n    [288:A] Y pensando que alguna cosa de las naturales que no se\n    pueden escusar hazer queria, dexaron la sola.\n\nThe Damsel entered the ship glad for the sword which she had stolen,\nand she told Ardan Canileo and Madasima how she had sped. Ardan thanked\nher for what she had done, and he said to Madasima, my Lady, account\nme not for a Knight if I do not bring you back with honour; and if I\ngive you not the head of Amadis in less time than a man can go half a\nleague, how swift soever he be, never grant me your love. She answered\nhim not, for albeit she greatly desired vengeance for the death of her\nfather and her brother, yet for nothing in the world would she have\nseen herself married to Ardan Canileo, for she was fair and noble, and\nhe foul and deformed and hideous, that there was none like him, and\nthis agreement was made at her mother's will, not at her own, who had\npromised, if he would defend and revenge her, to give him Madasima and\nleave him all her lands. Now whereas this Ardan Canileo was a Knight\nfamous in the world, and of great prowess, the history shall tell you\nof what land he was native, and the fashion of his body and face,\nand what else to him appertaineth. Know then that he was born in the\nprovince called Canileo, of the blood of the Giants, who abound there\nmore than in other parts; he was not unreasonably great of body, albeit\nexceeding in stature any man who was not a giant; his limbs were large,\nand his breast broad, and his shoulders square, and his hands and legs\nproportioned; his face was large and flat and like a dog, wherefore\nhe was called Canileo, and his nose was flat and spreading, and his\ncolour purple freckled with black spots, which were all over his face\nand neck and hands; his look was fierce like a lion, and his lips were\nthick and curling out, and his hair so woolly that it could scarcely\nbe combed, and the beard like it. He was now five and thirty years\nold, and for ten years past neither Knight nor Giant had been able\nto withstand him, and so bony was he that there was scarcely a horse\ncould carry his weight. When the Insolent Damsel heard him promise the\nhead of Amadis to Madasima, she said to him, we may well hope so Sir,\nsince Fortune already shows herself adverse to your enemy. Here is his\ngood sword which I bring you, which could not have been gained for you\nwithout great mystery of his ill fate, and your good fortune; then she\ngave it him and related how she had stolen it. He took it and replied,\nI thank thee for the gift, more for the good manner in which you took\nit than for any fear I have of a battle against a single Knight. Then\nhe ordered tents to be taken from the ship, and pitched in a plain near\nthe town, and there they all went with their horses and palfreys, and\nthe arms of Ardan Canileo, expecting the next day to appear before King\nLisuarte. Right joyful was Ardan that the combat was thus appointed,\nand for two reasons: the one because he made no doubt that he should\ncarry off the head of Amadis, who being so famous all his glory would\nremain upon him, and the other because he should win the fair Madasima\nwhom he loved so well.\n\nMeantime Amadis was with his friends who greatly feared this combat,\nso dangerous did they esteem it. Presently Agrayes, and Don Florestan,\nand Galvanes Lackland, and Don Guilan the Pensive, came in, knowing\nnothing of what had past, for they had been hunting in the forest;\nbut when they heard how the combat had been appointed, they complained\nthat it had not been fixed for a greater number of Knights, that they\nmight have entered it, and he who most passionately lamented this was\nDon Guilan who had heard how Ardan Canileo was the strongest of any\nKnight in arms, and the most powerful, and it grieved him to death, for\nhe thought that Amadis would never escape with life from him, fighting\nhim man to man in lists, and he greatly wished to share his fortune if\nArdan had brought a companion. Don Florestan too exclaimed in great\nanger, as God shall save me, brother, you think me of no account as a\nKnight, or you do not love me, since you did not remember me on such\nan occasion! you make me perceive that it is bootless to accompany you\nlonger, for you always withhold me from such perils. Agrayes also and\nDon Galvanes complained in the like manner. Sirs, quoth Amadis, you\nblame me with little cause; the combat was demanded of me alone, so\nthat without showing cowardice I could not otherwise have answered;\nelse, if I might have had assistance whom else should I have looked\nto but you, whose great valour might have aided mine in danger. Thus\nhaving excused himself he said, it will be well that we ride forward\nto-morrow before the King goes forth, to meet Madasima, who is greatly\nesteemed by all who know her.\n\nIn the morning they apparalled themselves richly, and having heard\nmass mounted on palfreys and rode to receive Madasima. Don Bruneo of\nBonamar went with them and his brother Branfil, and Enil, who was a\ngoodly Knight and of great worth, and of chearful heart, so that he\nwas beloved and esteemed by all, so they were eight companions. And as\nthey drew nigh the tents they saw Madasima coming, and Ardan Canileo\nand their company. Madasima was arrayed in black, mourning for her\nfather and brother, but her beauty was so lively and excellent that\nit was a marvel, and her Damsels went near her all drest in the same\ncloth. Ardan Canileo led her bridle, and there came the old Giant and\nhis sons, and the nine Knights who were to be hostages. As they drew\nnear to each other the Knights made their obeisance, and she in like\nmanner bowed to them with good semblance; then Amadis approached her\nand said, Lady, if you are praised it is with great reason I see, and\nhappy ought he to be esteemed who is allowed to honour and serve you;\nthat would I willingly do in what it might please you to command me.\nArdan Canileo, who looked at him and saw how handsome he was, so that\nhe had seen none like him, was nothing pleased at this. Knight, quoth\nhe, give back, and dare not speak to one whom you know not. It is that\nwe may know her and serve her, replied Amadis, that we are come. And\nwho are you? cried Ardan scornfully; let me know if you are worthy to\nserve her? Such as I am, quoth Amadis, I have the will to serve her,\nand shall not cease to have that will, however unworthy I may be, and\nsince you ask who I am, tell me who are you?\u00e2\u0080\u0094I am Ardan Canileo, who\ncan better serve her in a day than you can in your whole life, though\nyou were of twice your worth.\u00e2\u0080\u0094That may well be: but your great service\nwould not proceed from so good a heart as my trifling one, this is\nplain from your pride and evil mind. Know that I am Amadis of Gaul of\nwhom you have demanded battle. If I have offended and grieved that Lady\nby doing that which without great shame I could not have left undone,\nright willingly would I atone for it by some good service. Ardan\nCanileo answered, if you dare perform your promise, certainly she shall\nreceive atonement with your head which I will give her. That amends,\nquoth Amadis, she shall not have with my good pleasure, but she shall\nreceive a greater; for I will break off your marriage. No man can so\nlack judgment as to hold it good that your beauty and hers should be\nunited! At this Madasima being nothing displeased, laughed a little,\nand her Damsels likewise, but Ardan became so wroth that his whole body\nshook, and his face became so exceeding terrible, that many thought\nAmadis was nothing in comparison with him, and that this would without\ndoubt be his last battle, and the last day of his life.\n\nThus they proceeded till they came before the King, to whom Ardan\nCanileo said, you see here the Knights ready to become your hostages,\nif Amadis dare keep his word. Then Amadis came forth and answered,\nyou see me here: let the battle be without delay, and I tell you\nthat though I had not promised it, I would undertake it now solely\nto save Madasima from so monstrous a marriage; but let King Arban of\nNorth Wales, and Angriote of Estravaus be brought here, that they\nmay be delivered if I conquer. They shall come, replied Ardan, but\nlet Madasima be where she may see the combat and the vengeance which\nI shall take for her. So the old Giant and his sons, and the nine\nKnights put themselves in the King's power, and Madasima and the\nDamsels went to the Queen, and so meekly and decorously did Madasima\ndemean herself, that albeit by her means Amadis was brought into this\ngreat danger, yet were they greatly pleased with her, and did her all\nhonour. But Oriana and Mabilia seeing the fierceness of Ardan Canileo\nwere greatly affrighted and retired in great fear and weeping to their\nchamber, for they thought the strength of Amadis was not enough to\nresist that Devil: yet did they remember his good fortune, how often it\nhad brought him off with honour, and Mabilia comforted her friend the\nbest she could. The following day was appointed for the battle; King\nLisuarte ordered his huntsmen and bowyers to surround the lists with\nchains and stakes, that neither Knight might lose honour by the fault\nof his horse. The lists were before the palace, and when Oriana saw\nthem preparing them from her window, the thought of how great a danger\nwas there designed for her Amadis so overpowered her, that she fell\nalmost senseless in Mabilia's arms.\n\nLisuarte went to the lodging of Amadis where many Knights were with\nhim, and said to him, that as the Queen and his daughter, and Queen\nBriolania and the other Dames and Damsels would pass that night in\nthe chapel, beseeching God to preserve their Knight, he would have\nhim return in his company to the palace, and with him Florestan and\nAgrayes, and Don Galvanes, and Guilan and Enil, and that there they\nshould regale themselves, and he desired Amadis to send his armour to\nthe chapel, that he might arm himself to-morrow before the Virgin Mary,\nthat so she and her glorious son might be his protectors. They went\ntherefore with the King, and Amadis ordered Gandalin to carry his arms\nthither as Lisuarte had advised. But he taking them in obedience missed\nthe sword from the scabbard, whereat so amazed was he and exceeding\nsorrowful that he wished himself dead, not only because the loss fell\nout at a time of such danger, but because he held it as a sign that\nhis Master's death was nigh at hand. He sought for it every where, and\nenquired of all who might know any thing; but when he could learn no\ntidings he was on the point of throwing himself from a window, if the\nthought had not come upon him that in that case he should destroy his\nsoul; forthwith in trouble of heart he went to the palace, and calling\nAmadis apart said to him, Cut off my head Sir, for I am a traitor to\nyou; and if you do not kill me I must slay myself. How now? quoth\nAmadis: are you mad? or what mishap is this? Better Sir, he said, that\nI were mad or dead than that such a mishap should have befallen. I\nhave lost your sword, it has been stolen from the scabbard. Is it for\nthis you are so distressed? replied Amadis, I thought something worse\nhad chanced; trouble yourself no more, there will be no want of another\nwherewith God will assist me, if it be his good pleasure. But though\nhe spake thus to comfort Gandalin, yet was he grieved at heart for the\nloss of that sword, as well for the lack of it now in such need, being\none of the best in the world, as because he had won it by the force of\nhis true love, and it was a comfort to him to look at it, and remember\nthat when he was absent from his Lady. Howbeit he bade Gandalin say\nnothing thereof to any person, but bring him the scabbard, and he bade\nhim learn of the Queen if he could have the sword which Don Guilan had\nbrought there together with his own arms; and if he could see Oriana\nhe made him request her in his name that she would be somewhere where\nhe might see her when he was in the lists, for the sight of her would\nmake him become conqueror in that or in a worse danger. Gandalin went\nto perform his bidding, and the Queen commanded the sword should be\ngiven him; but Briolania and Olinda said to him, Ah Gandalin, what\nthink you can your Master do against that Devil? he answered smiling,\nand with a chearful countenance, Ladies, this is not the first\nperilous enterprise which he hath undertaken, and as God as hitherto\npreserved him so he will now. God grant it, cried they. Then went he\nto Mabilia and told her what his Master requested of Oriana, and then\nreturned to Amadis, and said that all things were done as he desired,\nwhereat he had great pleasure and took more courage, knowing that his\nLady would be where he might see her from the lists. Amadis then took\nthe King aside, and said to him, Sir, I have lost my sword, and knew\nit not till now; they have stolen it and left the sheath. The King\nwas grieved thereat and answered him, although I had determined and\npromised never to give my sword to any Knight who was to fight man to\nman before me, yet will I now give it you, remembering how many dangers\nyou have encountered for my sake. God forbid, quoth Amadis, that I who\nought to maintain your royal word should make you break it, and that\ntoo when you have pledged it before so many good men. The tears came\ninto Lisuarte's eyes, and he said, such a man are you for maintaining\njustice and right! but what will you do?\u00e2\u0080\u0094I have here the sword which\nwas laid in the Ark with me, which Don Guilan brought hither, herewith\nand with your prayers to the Lord which will avail before him, I may\nbe assisted. Then he placed the sword in the sheath, which became it\nwell, although the sword was somewhat short, and the King was glad he\ntook the sheath because of its virtue, which would protect him from\nexceeding heat or cold, for the bones of the serpents whereof it was\nmade were of such a constellation; but of very different goodness was\nthis sword from the other.\n\nThus they passed that day till it was the hour of sleep, and then all\nthose Knights had their arms around the King's bed. But all that night\nArdan Canileo had merry-making in his tents, with music and dancing,\nand ever at the end of his songs his people all cried out, come\nMorning, come! and let the day be clear, that Ardan Canileo may perform\nwhat he has promised to the fair Madasima! but it fell out otherwise\nthan they expected. That night Amadis slept in the King's chamber, but\nthe sleep which he slept was of no avail, for presently at midnight he\nrose without speaking, and went to the chapel, and having awakened the\nchaplain confessed all his sins to him, and there they both were before\nthe altar of the Virgin Mary making prayers, and beseeching her to be\nhis patroness in this battle. When it was dawn the King and those other\nKnights arose, and heard mass, and Amadis was armed by such Knights as\nwell knew how to do it; but before his breast-plate was put on Mabilia\ncame up and hung round his neck certain reliques shrined with gold,\nsaying, that the Queen her mother had sent them to her by the Damsel of\nDenmark; but it was not so, for Elisena had given them to Amadis when\nshe knew him for her son, and he gave them to Oriana when he delivered\nher from Arcalaus. When he was armed they brought him a goodly horse,\nwhich Corisanda had sent with other presents to her friend Florestan.\nFlorestan carried his lance, and Don Guilan his shield, and Don Bruneo\nhis helmet, and the King went before on a great horse, holding a wand\nin his hand. All the people of the court and town were assembled about\nthe lists to see the battle, and the Dames and Damsels were at the\nwindows, and the fair Oriana and Mabilia were at their chamber window,\nand with the Queen were Briolania and Madasima, and other princesses.\nAs Amadis came up to the lists they loosened one of the chains and he\nentered and took his arms, and as he put on his helmet he looked at\nhis Lady, and felt therewith such strength as though no one in the\nworld could withstand him. Then the Judges entered the field, who were\nto assign to each his right; they were three in number, that good\nold man Don Grumedan, who was well skilled in such things, and Don\nQuadragante, who was now the King's vassal, and Brandoyuas; then came\nArdan Canileo well armed, and upon a great horse: his harness was of\nthick mail, and his shield and helmet were of steel, so polished that\nit was bright like looking-glass; and he had girded at his side the\ngood sword of Amadis, which the Damsel had stolen, and he bent his huge\nlance as if he would have broken it, and thus he entered the lists.\nWhen Oriana saw him, she said in great agony, ah my friend, how fierce\nand terribly my death approaches, unless God in his mercy prevent\nit. Leave this, quoth Mabilia, and make good chear, for so shall you\nencourage your friend.\n\nThen Don Grumedan led Amadis to one end of the lists, and Brandoyuas\nplaced Ardan Canileo at the other, with their horses heads fronting\neach other; and Quadragante at an equal distance between them held a\ntrumpet in his hand to sound the signal. Amadis, who was looking at\nhis Lady, exclaimed, What is Quadragante about that he does not blow\nthe trumpet? Quadragante then blew the blast, and the two Knights ran\nfull speed, and encountered lance against shield so fiercely that\nthe lances shivered, and they hurtled with such force that the horse\nof Ardan Canileo fell and broke his neck and died, and the horse of\nAmadis broke his shoulder and could not rise. Amadis presently arose,\nthough with some difficulty, for a truncheon of the lance was sticking\nin his shield, and through the lappets of his armour, though it had\nnot reached the flesh; he plucked it out, and laid hand to sword and\nmade at Ardan, who had risen hardly and was adjusting his helmet.\nBut Ardan seeing his approach drew his sword, and they joined battle\nso furiously that there was not a man who saw them but was greatly\namazed, for their strokes fell so fierce and so fast that flames of\nfire seemed to proceed from their helmets and swords as if they burnt,\nand chiefly from the shield of Ardan Canileo, for that being of steel,\nand the blows of Amadis so rapid and heavy, it appeared as if the whole\nshield and arm were in a blaze of fire, but the great hardness of the\nshield protected him and saved his body, which was to the mortal evil\nof Amadis; for as his arms were not so good, and as Ardan had one of\nthe best swords in the world, never blow reached him that did not\npierce through and reach his flesh, so that in many parts the blood\nran down, and his shield was all hacked. The sword of Amadis could\nmake no impression upon the shield and helmet of his enemy, and though\nhis own harness was of thick and strong mail, it was pierced in more\nthan ten places, and the blood streamed from them all. What then most\nprofited Amadis was his activity, for by that he made Ardan miss all\nhis heaviest blows, though Ardan was well practised and expert with\nthe sword. Thus they continued till the hour of tierce, striking and\nfoyning, and grappling and struggling so manfully that Ardan Canileo\nwas in great amazement, for he had never before found Knight nor\nGiant so strong as to resist him thus much; and what made him doubt\nthe issue was, that he always found his antagonist more active and\nstronger than at the beginning, whereas he himself waxed weary and\nfaint, being full of blood. Then Madasima knew that he had boasted\nvainly when he promised to conquer Amadis before the swiftest footman\ncould run half a league, whereat she was little grieved, nor would she\nthough Ardan were to lose his own head there, for such was her mind,\nthat she would rather lose all her lands than be joined in marriage\nwith such as he. The Knights still continued in battle, striking at\neach other in every part where they could work most harm, each striving\nfor the other's death; and if Amadis had then had arms good as his\nown activity and breath, Ardan could not have held the field against\nhim, but all his efforts were now needed, for his arms were broken,\nand his shield broken, and the blood flowing from many wounds, and he\nhad to deal with a Knight fierce and strong in battle. When Oriana\nsaw him in such plight her heart failed her for sore anguish, and she\nthrew herself upon the ground, and beat her face, thinking that Amadis\nwas come to his death. Mabilia seeing this, notwithstanding her own\nexceeding trouble, put on an appearance of much anger, and told her\nthat at such a time and in such danger she ought not to forsake her\nlover, and because she could not endure to see his danger, Mabilia\nmade her stand with her back to the window that Amadis might see her\nlong hair. At this time Brandoyuas, who was one of the Judges, said,\nI am grieved to see the arms and shield of Amadis so battered! and I,\nquoth Grumedan, I am much troubled. Sirs, said Quadragante, I have\nproved Amadis in combat, and his strength seems to double while he\nfights, and of all Knights whom I have seen he endures the best, and\nis the best breathed; he is now in his full strength, which is not the\ncase with Ardan, if any fault be in Amadis it is that he is too eager:\nhe should suffer his enemy to press on him, and then his own weight\nwould weary Ardan. But his great courage will not let him thus spare\nhimself. When Oriana and Mabilia heard these words they were greatly\ncomforted; but Amadis, who had seen his Lady retire from the window,\nknew that it was for sorrow at beholding him, and he made a blow at\nArdan with exceeding fury, and smote him so rudely upon the helmet that\nhe brought him down upon one knee, but that blow was so mighty, and\nthe helmet so hard, that the sword broke in three pieces, and a piece\nonly remained in his hand. Then was Amadis in all fear of death, and\nthey who beheld him expected his death also. When Ardan saw this he\nrose and drew back, and took his shield by the straps, and brandishing\nhis sword cried aloud to Amadis, Look! here is the good sword which\nthou hast won to thy own destruction. Look at it! this is it, and thou\nshalt die by it. Come, Lady Madasima! come to the window, and you shall\nbehold the full vengeance which I will give you! When Madasima heard\nthis she fell at the Queen's feet, and besought her to protect her from\nArdan, which, said she, you may lawfully do, for Ardan promised to win\nthe battle before a man could run half a league, and it has now lasted\nfour hours. I hear you, replied Brisena, and will do what is just. But\nwhen Amadis saw in what plight he stood, his arms in pieces and without\na sword, he remembered the words of Urganda when she told him that\nhe would give half the world if it were his, so that that sword were\nsunk in a lake; and he looked toward Oriana's window, and seeing her\nback towards him, knew why she had turned away, and his courage revived\nso that he resolved to die rather than fail to do his utmost. He made\nat Ardan Canileo as if he were about to strike him; Ardan raised his\nsword and awaited him, and struck at him as he came up, but Amadis bent\naside and closed with him so close that Ardan could not interpose his\nsword, and he seized the shield by the rim, and plucked it with such\nforce that he tore it from his arm and well nigh brought him to the\nground, then he drew back, and put that shield upon his own arm, and\ntook up the truncheon of a lance which had its point, and again turned\nto Ardan, being now defended by Ardan's shield. Ardan in great fury\nfor this loss ran at him thinking to smite him on the helmet; Amadis\ncaught the blow upon his shield, and though it was of fine steel, such\nwas the temper of that good sword that it pierced through the rim and\nentered three fingers' depth, and with the broken lance Amadis wounded\nhim in the right arm by the wrist, thrusting the iron half through\nbetween the two bones, therewith Ardan lost all power to pluck the\nsword out, and Amadis forced it from his hand; if he was then right\nglad and satisfied need neither be asked nor said; he cast away the\nbroken lance, and drew the sword from the shield, thanking God for his\nmercy. Mabilia, who beheld, caught hold of Oriana and made her turn\nand see her lover obtain this victory over so imminent a danger. Ardan\nCanileo grew faint as he beheld his death at hand, howbeit he attempted\nto recover the shield in the like manner as he had lost it, but Amadis\nsmote him upon the left shoulder, and cut through armour, and flesh and\nbone. Ardan felt the use of his arm was gone, and he fled round the\nlists, fearing that good sword. Amadis followed close and caught him\nby the helmet, and plucked it off, and brought him to the ground at\nhis feet, then knelt upon him and cut off his head, to the great joy\nof all, especially of King Arban of North Wales, and Angriote, who had\nendured great agony while they witnessed the danger of Amadis. Then\nAmadis cast the head out of the lists, and he dragged the body to a\nrock and threw it into the sea, then he wiped the blood from his sword\nand placed it in its sheath.\n\nThe King sent him a horse, on which he rode well accompanied to his\nlodging, but he was sore wounded and had lost much blood. With him he\ntook King Arban and Angriote, whom he had delivered from their cruel\nchains. Brisena sent for her nephew Arban, and Angriote remained in the\nchamber of his true friend Amadis, and there were they both healed; and\nthey were lovingly visited there by many Knights and Dames and Damsels\nof the court, and his cousin Mabilia came to Amadis, and brought with\nher that true medicine wherewith his heart could heal all lesser evils.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER 20._\n\n\nOn the day after the battle Don Bruneo of Bonamar appeared before\nthe King, and there he found the Insolent Damsel, who said that her\nbrother was ready to do combat with him, and take that poor vengeance\nfor Ardan Canileo. Forthwith they armed and went to the field, Don\nBruneo accompanied by many good Knights, and Madaman the Envious, for\nso he was called, by them who bore his arms. At the first encounter\nMadaman was thrown and Bruneo slightly hurt in the breast; he kept his\nseat, but when he turned the reins Madaman cried out to him, sword in\nhand, Don Bruneo, if you would not lose your horse, alight or let me\nmount. Take your own choice, quoth Bruneo. Alight then, said Madaman,\nfor being of huge stature he thought to have the advantage afoot; then\nbegan a brave battle, and while they were thus engaged there happened\na strange thing, whereby it was manifested that beasts know their\nmasters, for the horses being loose in the field attacked each other,\nfighting with their feet and teeth so furiously that all were amazed\nthereat, and this lasted till Madaman's horse being no longer able\nto hold out ran away, and in his fear leaped over the barriers, the\nwhich, all they who wished for the victory of Bruneo, held as a good\nsign; and turning their eyes now to the two combatants they saw how\nDon Bruneo prest upon the enemy hard, so that Madaman drew back and\nsaid, Why do you fatigue yourself? is not the day long enough? Hold\nawhile and let us rest; look at your arms and the blood which you have\nlost, and you will find it needful. Madaman, quoth he, if our combat\nwere of another nature you should find in me all courtesy, but for\nthis pride and hatred I will not suffer thee to rest, and show thy own\nfaint-heartedness, lest my own fame should be lessened; with that he\nprest upon him and foyned so fast at him, that Madaman had enough to\ndo to defend himself from the blows; and he thinking he might protect\nhimself better among the rocks drew back towards the cliff, and there\nhe stood upon the edge, being affrighted at the depth, till Bruneo came\nup, and with his shield and hand thrust him over, so that he was all\nshattered before he reached the water; then Bruneo knelt and returned\nthanks to God.\n\nBut when Matalesa the Insolent Damsel beheld the fall of her brother,\nshe ran furiously to the cliff and looked over, and seeing the bloody\nfragments floating on the waves, she caught up his sword which he had\ndropt and cried, Here, where the blood of my Uncle Ardan Canileo and\nmy brother has been shed, shall mine be shed also, that my soul may\nbe with theirs; and she ran herself through, and fell backward into\nthe sea. Don Bruneo then rode to the lodging of Amadis, and his bed\nwas placed by the beds of Amadis and Angriote, and there were they all\nhealed, and during their confinement the Knights and Ladies of the\ncourt often went there to amuse them.\n\nNow Briolania perceiving that the malady of her love increased, with\nthe advice of Amadis departed for her own kingdom; but she determined\nfirst to see the wonders of the Firm Island, and prove the Forbidden\nChamber. So she took Enil with her, and promised to tell Oriana all\nthat she should see there, as shall be related hereafter.\n\nAs this history now proceeds you will see the little power of human\nwisdom when it pleases God to leave man to himself. You have heard how\nKing Lisuarte being a prince, and possessing nothing but his arms and\nhis horse, and going about with only a few servants seeking adventures,\ncame to Denmark, where Brisena, the King's daughter, preferred him\nto all her many suitors, and chose him for her husband; this was his\nfirst good fortune. But ere long his brother died, and he became King\nof Great Britain, and subdued other Kingdoms, and the sons of Kings,\nand Princes, and Dukes, abode in his court, so that his name was famous\nabove all Emperors and Kings in the world. Now there were two Knights\nin his court who had served his brother King Falangris, and for this,\nand because of their age more than for their goodness, they were of\nLisuarte's counsel: the one was named Brocadan, the other Gandandel.\nThis Gandandel had two sons who were thought passing good Knights in\narms, before Amadis and those of his lineage arrived there, whose\nexceeding worth and courage had now made them be forgotten. On this\naccount Gandandel neither fearing God nor regarding his duty to the\nKing, nor the good deeds done by Amadis to himself, devised in his evil\nheart a foul treason. He led the King apart and said to him, Sir, I\nhave long forborne to speak to you upon this matter, hoping some other\nremedy might be devised, and therein have I greatly sinned against\nyou; but I should sin both against you and God if I were longer to\nkeep silence, and I have been always careful to preserve my soul and\nhonour, and do evil to no one, so that my judgment is free from all\npassion. You know Sir what great quarrels have subsisted between the\nkingdoms of Gaul and Great Britain, because that country ought to be\nsubject to this as all the other neighbouring countries are, and this\nis an evil which will never be thoroughly healed till it be so. But now\nAmadis, who is not only a native of Gaul, but the chief person of his\nlineage, is come hither with his kinsmen, and has acquired such power\nthat the kingdom is in his hand, as if he were right heir thereto. True\nit is that from him and his friends I have never received any wrong,\nbut great honour and pleasure; but you are my natural Lord, and I must\ndischarge my duty lest I fall into a wretched plight in this world, and\nmy soul be cast into hell in the other. The King without any seeming\nalteration answered him, These Knights have already served me well to\nmy honour and profit, so that I cannot think of them otherwise than\nwell. Sir, quoth Gandandel, that is the worst sign, for if they did\nany thing against your service you would be upon your guard against\nthem, but the treachery is concealed under their good services. Thus\nhave you heard all the talk, for the King answered nothing farther.\nBut Gandandel took counsel with his cousin Brocadan, whose evil mind\nwas like his own, and they two both working upon the King to the\nsame effect wrought in him a great change against those who had done\nhim such services, so that he seemed to have forgotten how Galaor\nrescued him from the ten Knights of Arcalaus, and Amadis from the arms\nof Madanfabul, although in both cases they saved his life and his\n[315:A]kingdoms.\n\n    [315:A] Here follows a column of caution against evil\n    Counsellors.\n\nSo much was Lisuarte moved thereby that he now began to hate Amadis and\nhis friends, and he left off visiting Amadis where he lay wounded, and\nwould pass by his lodging without asking how he fared. All who saw this\nnovelty marvelled much thereat, and they sometimes talked concerning it\nbefore Amadis, but he knowing his own true meaning would not believe\nbut that the King also was like himself, and that business occupied\nhim, and this he said to his friends, and particularly to Angriote of\nEstravaus, who was the most troubled. While things were in this state\nKing Lisuarte sent for Madasima and her Damsels, and the old Giant and\nhis sons, and the nine Knights whom he held as hostages, and he told\nthem that if they did not forthwith cause the Island of Mongaza to be\ngiven up to him, according to terms, he would have their heads cut off;\nwhich, when Madasima heard, the tears came abundantly, and not knowing\nwhat to reply her flesh all shook with exceeding fear. But Andaguel\nthe old Giant replied, that if he would send him with a certain force\nhe would cause the Island to be surrendered to him, or else return\nagain. The King therefore dismissed him with this force, and Madasima\nreturned to prison, accompanied by many Knights, among whom was Don\nGalvanes Lackland; he beholding the tears on that fair face was moved\nto exceeding pity, and yielded up that liberty which he had before\npreserved, and without delay speaking apart to her, he opened his\nheart and said, that if it pleased her to marry him he would so deal\nthat both her life and lands should be safe. Madasima, who well knew\nhis great worth, and of what lineage he was, was nothing averse; then\nGalvanes knelt down and kissed her hand, and it was not long before\nhe acquainted Amadis and Agrayes of his love, and besought them to\nenable him to perform what he had promised as they regarded his life.\nThey marvelling at this sudden change told him that, considering his\ngood services to King Lisuarte, what he required was a little thing,\nespecially as the Lordship of the Island would remain to the King, and\nAmadis promised, as soon as he could ride, to request the boon for him.\n\nMeantime Gandandel often went to visit Amadis with semblance of great\nregard, and always spoke to him of the King as being changed, and\nwarned him to beware of him lest some evil should happen, which,\nsaid the old traitor, would be a great grief to me, because of the\nmany favours I and my sons have received at your hands; but never\ncould he kindle any wrath or suspicion in the mind of Amadis, though\nhe persisted so that Amadis grew angry at him, and told him to say\nno more, for if all in the world were to tell him so he never would\nbelieve that so wise and good a King could be moved against one, who\nsleeping and waking had no thought of any thing but his service. After\nsome days, when the three Knights were healed of their wounds, they\nrode out one morning being richly apparelled, and after hearing mass\nwent to the palace, where they were right welcomed by all except by\nthe King, who neither looked at them nor received them as he was wont.\nAmadis did not conceive that this proceeded from any ill will, but that\ntraitor Gandandel came up to him, and embracing him, said with a smile,\npeople are sometimes not believed when they tell the truth. Amadis made\nhim no answer, and he seeing how Angriote and Don Bruneo were offended\nthat Lisuarte did not notice them, went up to the King and said, so\nthat no one could hear him, Do you not see Sir how those Knights look\ntowards you? Lisuarte did not reply, and Amadis then, who suspected\nno evil, came up with Galvanes and Agrayes and said courteously, Sir,\nif it please you we would speak with you, and let whom you will be\npresent; the King said, Gandandel and Brocadan; thereat was Amadis\nwell pleased, for he believed them to be his true friends. Then they\nwent together into a garden, where the King seated himself under a\ntree, and they round about him, and Amadis said, Sir, it has not been\nmy fortune to serve you according to my good will, yet though I may\nnot have deserved it, relying upon your virtue and great nobleness, I\nventure to ask a boon, which shall be to your service, and wherein you\nshall show great courtesy and do what is right. Certes, said Gandandel,\nif it be as you say you ask a fair boon, but let the King know what\nyou would have. Sir, replied Amadis, what I and Agrayes and Galvanes,\nwho have served you also, now request, is the Island of Mongaza, that\nreserving to yourself the Lordship you would give it with Madasima in\nmarriage to Don Galvanes, wherein you will show favour to him who is\nof such lineage and hath no lands, and will gain a good vassal for\nyourself, and also deal courteously with Madasima, who by us hath been\ndisherited. Gandandel and Brocadan hearing this looked at the King,\nand made signs to him that he should not grant it; but he remained\nsilent for awhile, calling to mind the great worth of Galvanes, and the\nservices which he had received from him, and how Amadis had won that\nIsland with the extreme peril of his life, and knowing also that what\nthey asked was a reasonable and becoming thing, and just. But because\nhis will was perverted he answered as one who had no inclination to\nconsent, He is not wise who asks for what he cannot have. I say this\nwith respect to you, for you ask that which five days ago I promised\nthe Queen for her daughter Leonoreta; this answer he made to excuse\nhimself, not because it was true. At this Gandandel and Brocadan were\nwell pleased, and made signs to him that he had said well, but Agrayes,\nwhose heart was warm, when he heard with how little courtesy the\nKing had refused them would not keep silence. You make us feel Sir,\nquoth he, that our services will profit us little here; if my advice\nbe taken, our lives shall be differently employed. Nephew, exclaimed\nGalvanes, services are worth little when they are done to those who\nknow not how to reward them: men should look where they bestow them.\nSirs, quoth Amadis, do not complain that the King cannot give you\nwhat he hath already promised to another. I will ask the King to give\nyou Madasima and let him keep the land, and I will give you the Firm\nIsland till the King shall have something else to bestow upon you. The\nKing answered, Madasima is in my prison in hostage for her lands, and\nif they be not surrendered I will have her head cut off. Then Amadis\nreplied, of a truth Sir you should have answered us more courteously,\nand you would not have committed this wrong if you had known us better.\nIf I do not know you, said Lisuarte, the world is wide enough; go\nthrough it, and look for those who may know you better. Certes Sir,\nquoth Amadis, till now I thought there was no King in the world who had\nwisdom such as yours; but seeing how strangely different you are from\nwhat I believed, since you are in this new mood we must seek a new way\nof life. Lisuarte answered, Do your own will as I shall mine, and he\nrose angrily and went to the Queen.\n\nGandandel and Brocadan commended him much for what he had done in thus\ndismissing such dangerous enemies, and he told Brisena all that had\npassed, and how he rejoiced thereat. But she told him that what he\nrejoiced at was to her cause for sorrow, for Amadis and his friends had\never served him faithfully and well; and that other Knights seeing how\nthey were recompensed would have great reason to seek one who would\nknow and reward them better. Say no more, cried he, I know what I am\ndoing, and remember to say what I tell you, that you asked that Island\nfor Leonoreta, and that I have given it her. I will do as you command\nme, replied Brisena, but God grant that it come to good!\n\nAmadis returned to his lodging in a more melancholy mood than he was\nwont, he would say nothing to the Knights of his company till he had\nspoken with Oriana, so calling Durin aside he bade him tell Mabilia\nthat he must see Oriana that night, and that they should expect him\nby the water course in the garden. Then he ate and regaled with the\nKnights as he used to do, and he desired them to assemble there on the\nmorrow for he had something to impart to them. When day was gone and\nnight was come, after they had retired and all were at rest, he went\nwith Gandalin to the water course, and having entered it went forthwith\nto the chamber of Oriana, where she with as true love expected him; and\nbeing in her arms she asked him why he had sent that message by Durin,\nand he told her all that had past. Now Lady mine, said he, since it\nis so that for my honour I must depart I beseech you do not command\nme otherwise, for I am more yours than my own, and if I am shamed the\nshame will be yours also. But Oriana, though she felt as though her\nheart were breaking, took courage as she could and answered, True\nfriend, with little reason can you complain of my father, for it is\nnot him but me whom you have served, for my sake you abode here, and\nfor my sake have done so many great actions, and from me you have had\nyour guerdon, and shall have while I live; yet should not my father\nhave done thus, seeing what you have been to him. Howbeit, though your\nabsence will be like as if my heart were breaking, I will regard reason\nmore than my unbounded love. Do as you think best! my father will find\nwhen you are gone that all that is left will be to him cause of sorrow\nand evil! Amadis kissed her hands; my own true Lady many and great\nkindnesses have I received from you which have saved me from death,\nbut for this I thank you above all, inasmuch as honour is above all\ndelights. Thus past they that night mingling tears with their love,\nthinking of the long solitude that was to come, and towards day-break\nAmadis rose; that dear cousin Mabilia and the Damsel of Denmark went\nout with him, and he embraced them, and commended Oriana to their\nconsolations, and so they parted weeping.\n\nAmadis went to his lodging and slept the remainder of the night and\nsome part of the morning, but when it was time he arose, and the\nKnights assembled, they heard mass and rode forth, and being assembled\nin the field he addressed them after this guise:\u00e2\u0080\u0094It is notorious to you\ngood Sirs and honourable Knights, whether the affairs of King Lisuarte\nhave prospered or declined since I and my brethren and friends for my\nsake came to Great Britain. I may therefore be excused from recalling\nwhat is past to your memory, this only I ought to say, that ye as well\nas myself might reasonably have expected great recompence; but either\nthat Fortune hath been using her accustomed inconstancy, or by the\ninfluence of evil counsellors, or perhaps because age hath altered\nthe conditions of the King, we have found him different from what we\nexpected; for when I myself and Agrayes, and Don Galvanes besought\nhim that he would give Madasima to Don Galvanes in marriage, and with\nher her lands in vassallage, he nothing regarding the worth of this\nKnight nor his high lineage, not only would not grant us the boon, but\ndenied it in terms so discourteous and dishonourable, that because\nthey proceeded from a tongue so true, and from a judgment so sound, I\nwould not willingly repeat them were not things at this extremity that\nit cannot be excused. Know then Sirs that towards the end of our talk,\nwhen we said to him that he did not know our services, he replied,\nthe world was wide enough and we might seek those who would know them\nbetter. So therefore as we have hitherto obeyed him in concord and\nfriendship, now must we in discord and enmity, fulfilling that which\nhe thinks fitting; it seemed right to me that you should know this,\nbecause it not only concerns us in particular but all in general.\n\nWhen these Knights heard what Amadis had said they were greatly\nastonished, and they talked one with another and said, that ill would\ntheir poor services be recompensed when what Amadis and his brethren\nhad done was so forgotten, so that their hearts were moved against the\nKing. And Angriote of Estravaus, as one who had resolved to take his\nshare in the good or evil which might befall Amadis, said to them,\nSirs, I have long known the King, and have always seen him temperate\nin all his actions, and never moved without great and just cause,\ntherefore I cannot believe that this should proceed from his own nature\nor inclination but from some meddling traitors who have bereft him of\nhis wisdom. Not for this do I excuse the King! for many days I have\nseen him speak more with Gandandel and Brocadan than he was accustomed\nto do, they being false and treacherous men, and I believe that they\nhave done this thing hoping to obtain thereby for themselves and their\nsons that which they have never merited, and that you may see how the\njustice of God comes to pass I will arm myself, and challenge them for\ntheir villainy which they have done to the King and to Amadis, and will\ndo combat against them both, or against their sons in their stead,\nif they dare sustain their father's treason. Forthwith he would have\ndeparted but Amadis withheld him saying, God forbid my true and loyal\nfriend that your life should be put in danger for an uncertain cause.\nI am certain, quoth Angriote, that it is as I say by what I have\nlong known of them, and if it pleases the King to speak truth he will\nconfirm it. If you love me, replied Amadis, let this rest at present,\nthat the King may not be offended; if these men who seemed so friendly\nare indeed my enemies, that will be known hereafter, and then may you\nbetter proceed against them. Then Angriote albeit unwillingly consented\nto delay vengeance. Amadis then turned to the assembled Knights and\nsaid, Sirs, I will take leave of the King and Queen if they chuse to\nsee me, and will go to the Firm Island, where they who shall please to\nlive with me shall be partakers with me in all the honour and pleasures\nthat I can command. The land is rich and aboundeth with all things,\nthere is store of forests and of fair women. I have treasure enough for\nour wants; they who know us will come thither to see us, and strangers\nto demand our help, and there we may return from our adventures to\nrecover strength. While my father King Perion lives the kingdom of\nGaul will not fail us, nor after his days. I have letters from the\nlesser Britain telling me that they give me that land, that then you\nmay esteem our own; I must remind you also of Scotland, the country of\nmy Cousin Agrayes, and of Queen Briolania's kingdom, which will not\nfail us for weal or for woe. That you may say truly Sir Amadis, quoth a\nKnight present, whose name was Tantiles, and who was governor of that\nkingdom. Sobradisa and its fair Queen, whom you have established there,\nwill be always at your service. Now then Sir, cried Don Quadragante,\ntake leave of the King and then will it be seen who they are who love\nyou, and will continue in your company. Amadis answered, greatly shall\nI esteem those who at this time will so honour me, yet do I not say,\nthat if they can profitably remain with the King they should not do so,\nfor of a truth so good a Lord cannot soon be found. As they were thus\ntalking the King and Gandandel past by with many other Knights, hawking\nwith merlins, and sported near them awhile without speaking to them or\nnoticing them, and then returned to the palace.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER 21._\n\n\nThen Amadis taking with him all those Knights went to take leave of the\nKing; they who were in the palace, when they saw with how altered a\ncountenance he entered, and at that hour when the tables were placed,\nall drew nigh to hear what he should say. He being before the King\nspake thus: Sir, whether or not you have dealt ill with me God and\nyourself can witness: of this I say no more, for though my services\nmay have been great, much greater was the will I had to requite those\nhonours which I from you received. Yesterday you told me that I might\ngo about the world and seek for one who would know me better, giving me\nto understand that what you wished was my departure from your court;\nsince this would please you it becomes me so to do. I do not come to\ndischarge myself of vassallage, for I never was subject to you, nor to\nany but God alone; but I take leave of that good will which you once\nmanifested to honour and favour me, and of that great love wherewith\nI ever strove to requite and serve you. Then Don Galvanes also took\nleave, and Agrayes and Florestan, and Dragonis and Palomir, who were\ncousins to Amadis, and Don Bruneo of Bonamar and his brother Branfil,\nand Angriote of Estravaus, and Grindonan his brother, and Pinores his\nnephew. Don Quadragante then came before the King and said, Sir, I\nabode with you only at the request of Amadis, and because I have been\nyours for his sake, for the same reason I will continue so no longer;\nsmall hope of recompence can there be for my poor services when he is\nso rewarded! for ill have you remembered how he saved you from the\nhands of Madanfabul, from whence none other could have saved you, and\nhow he won for you that battle against King Cildadan, and how his\nbrethren and kinsmen there shed their blood for you; how he delivered\nyou from my enmity, and from Famongomadan and his son Basagante, who\nwere the strongest giants in the world, and from Lindoraque, who was\nso mighty a Knight, and from Arcalaus the Enchanter\u00e2\u0080\u0094all this you have\nforgotten; but I tell you that had all we been in the field and Amadis\naway, how think you would it then have fallen out? The King answered,\nDon Quadragante I well perceive by your words that you have no love\ntowards me, neither are you so beholden to Amadis that you should\ndesire his welfare; perchance what you say of that is not so true as\nit sounds. Quadragante replied, you are of that rank that you may say\nwhat pleases you, but sure am I that you will not move Amadis with\nmischief-making words as others have been moved, who will discover\ntheir error when too late. Then Landin came up and said, Sir, of all\nyour household I could find no help or healing for my wounds save\nonly from Amadis, therefore shall I go with him and with my uncle Don\nQuadragante. Certes, quoth Lisuarte, if you staid I should not have a\nfriend the more. Landin replied, such as they are towards you will I\nbe. At this time were assembled together in another part of the palace,\nDon Brian of Monjaste, a right good Knight, who was son of King Ladasan\nof Spain and of a sister of King Perion, and Gandal, and Orlandin, son\nto the Count of Orlanda, and Grandores, and Madancil, he of the Silver\nBridge, and Listoran of the White Tower, and Ladadin of Fajarque,\nand Branfiles the haughty, and Don Gavarte of the Perilous Vale; and\nwhen they saw how all those other Knights were about to depart for\nthe love of Amadis, they also went before the King and said, Sir, we\ncame to your court to see Amadis and his brethren, and to obtain his\nfriendship, and as he was the cause of our coming so will he be of our\ndeparture. These Knights having departed, and there remaining no other,\nAmadis would have taken leave of the Queen but Lisuarte would not\npermit him, because she had always opposed this quarrel, so he sent his\nexcuses by Don Grumedan. Then went he to his lodging, and after they\nhad made their meal they all mounted being fully armed, five hundred\nKnights were they in all who followed Amadis, among whom were the sons\nof Kings and of Counts, and others, who for their prowess as well as\nbirth, were renowned throughout all the world.\n\nMabilia beheld them from a window of the Queen's palace, in what order\nthey went, their arms how rich they were, and how glittering in the\nsun, so that none who saw them depart but marvelled and thought the\nKing unhappy, that he would so lose such a Knight and so goodly a\ncompany. Then Mabilia went to Oriana and said, Cease thy sorrow and\ncome look at your vassals! and let your heart rejoice that you have\nsuch a lover; for if till now he has led the life of an Errant Knight\nserving your father, now that he has left his service, he appears like\na powerful Prince, and that Lady will redound to your honour. Oriana\nbeing comforted by her words looked at the company, subduing by her\nfortitude that grief and passion which tormented her heart. There went\nout with Amadis to honour him, King Arban of North Wales, and Grumedan\nthe Queen's fosterer, and Brandoyuas and Quinorante, and Giontes the\nKing's nephew, and Listoran the good jouster. All these rode with him\napart from his company and very sorrowful for his departure, and Amadis\nbesought them that they would still be his friends so far as they could\nwithout breach of honour, for he should still esteem and love them as\nhe had done; nor though the King had ceased to love him, having no\ncause for this change, should they do so likewise, nor for that cease\nto serve the King and honour him as for his worth he deserved. They\nanswered, that they should never cease to love him however they were\nbound by loyalty to serve the King. Then said Amadis, I beseech you\ntell the King that what Urganda said before me is now made manifest,\nhow I should gain for another, and my guerdon should be wrath, and the\nlong delay of my will! So has it come to pass! but the just Judge of\nall will allot to every one his right. Don Grumedan cursed Urganda for\nprophesying so truly, and then they returned to the town. Presently\nDon Guilan came up and he was in tears; and he said, Sir, You know how\nit is with us, that I have neither will nor heart of my own, but must\nobey her for whom I suffer so much, and she has forbidden me to follow\nyou, and thus am I put to great shame: now would I repay those honours\nwhich I have ever received from you and your brethren, but I may not!\nBut Amadis, who knew the great and excessive love of this Knight, and\nremembered how he himself loved and obeyed Oriana, embraced him and\nsaid, Don Guilan my dear friend, God forbid that a Knight like you\nshould disobey your Lady, not so would I advise you, nor so advising\nshould I be your friend; obey her and serve the King, and sure am I\nthat you will keep your loyalty and yet that I shall have in you the\nsame friend. So Guilan answered, he trusted in God to serve him yet;\nand he took his leave. They rode on about three leagues to the shore\nwhere Amadis had ordered tents to be pitched; there they regaled that\nnight, congratulating each other that they had not remained longer in\nthe service of one so thankless, but Amadis felt his heart fail him,\nfor he knew not when he should again see Oriana. In the morning they\nset forth again and took the straight road to the Firm Island.\n\nOn the day after Amadis had departed, the King when mass was over sate\nin his palace according to custom, and looked on one side and on the\nother, and beholding how desolate the place appeared without those\nKnights who were gone, he began to muse upon his own conduct, and was\nlost in thought. Gandandel and Brocadan, who knew what Angriote had\nsaid of them, when they saw him thus thoughtful began to fear that he\nwas ill satisfied with what had been done. Howbeit as they could not\nnow retreat they resolved to push farther on, for this is the ill fate\nof all great errors. So Gandandel went up to Lisuarte and said to him,\nhenceforth Sir you may rest secure since those who could have injured\nyou are dismissed from your service; the trouble of your state and\nhousehold you may lay on us and we will attend to it more carefully\nthan to our own concerns, and when you think of the treasures which you\nmust have bestowed upon those Knights but which are now your own, you\nshould greatly rejoice. Lisuarte looked sternly at them and answered,\nI marvel much at what you say, that I should commit the management of\nmy state and household to you! that I and those about me are not equal\nto the task\u00e2\u0080\u0094but you, in whom I did not perceive such great ability are\ncapable thereof! Even if you were, my vassals and household would\nbe ill contented with the authority of such as you! You tell me too\nthat I shall save the wealth which would else have been bestowed among\nthose Knights. I would know how it could be better employed than to\nmy own honour and service, my honour was defended by it, my dominion\nincreased, and so it at last returned to me again, for the wealth that\nis bestowed where it ought, lies in a good treasury whence it never can\nbe lost. No more of this! I shall not take your counsel! He then arose\nand called his huntsmen and went forth to the field, leaving them in\namazement and great dismay.\n\nAt this season arrived a Damsel from Queen Briolania with tidings to\nOriana, whereat all greatly rejoiced for that Queen was much beloved by\nall. Lady, quoth she, I come from Briolania to tell you the wonders of\nthe Firm Island, that you may know all, for I was witness. God grant\nlong life to her! said Oriana, and good fortune to you for the trouble\nwhich you have taken. So all drew round to hear her. Then said the\nDamsel, when Briolania and her company had arrived at the Firm Island\nshe was asked if she would attempt the Forbidden Chamber or the Arch of\nTrue Lovers, but she answered, that she would leave those two proofs\ntill the last. They then led us to a fair dwelling about a league from\nthe Castle, which, because of its goodly situation, was one of the\nchief habitations of Apolidon, and when it was dinner time they led us\nto a large hall, at the one end whereof was a deep cave so dark and\nfearful that none durst go nigh to it, and at the other end of the\npalace was a fair tower where they led us, and we found the tables and\nbenches placed by the windows, and from thence we could see all that\npast below in the large hall. So there were we well served by Dames and\nDamsels, and the Knights and our people feasted below in the hall. But\nwhen the second service was brought in loud hissings were heard from\nthe cave, and a hot wind came forth therefrom, and there issued out\na great serpent into the middle of the hall, so fierce and terrible\nthat none dared look on him, and he breathed smoke from his mouth and\nnostrils, and lashed the ground with his tail so that the whole palace\nshook; presently two Lions came out of the cave and attacked him, and\nbegan such a battle that there is not heart of man which would not have\nfelt fear at beholding it. The Knights and people fled with all speed\nfrom the table, and though the windows whereat we were were very high,\nyet were we greatly terrified. Half an hour that battle lasted till the\nLions were so wearied that they lay as though they were dead, and the\nserpent so exhausted that he could scarce draw breath; but after he had\nrested a little he took one Lion in his mouth and carried him into the\ncave, then returned for the other, and they were seen no more that day.\nThe men of the Island laughed at our fear, and assured us that they\nwould appear no more that day, so we then returned to the tables and\nfinished our meal.\n\nThe next day they led us to a place still fairer, where we were well\nfeasted, and at night they showed us a rich chamber, marvellously fair\nwhere there was a rich and costly bed for Briolania, and other good\nones for us. But about midnight the doors flew open with so great\nnoise that we all awoke in terror, and a hart came in, having lighted\ncandles upon his horns, so that the whole chamber was as light as day.\nOne side of that hart was white as snow, and the neck and the head\nwere black as pitch, and the one horn seemed gilt and the other was\nred; four dogs pursued him in full cry, and behind them an ivory horn\nmoved and sounded in the air as if a man were sounding it, and gave the\nproper sound of the chase, and cheared the dogs so that they pursued\nthe hart and allowed him no respite, and drove him from one part of\nthe chamber to another, and sometimes they leaped over our beds, and\nsometimes they fell on them, so that we rose up in our shifts and our\nhair hanging about and fled from them, and some hid themselves under\nthe beds, till the Hart finding no safety there leaped through a window\nand the dogs after him; then were we right glad, and taking up the\ncloaths which were thrown about covered ourselves, and gave a robe to\nBriolania wherein she drest herself, and then as the fear was past we\nlaughed at the confusion into which we had been thrown. While we were\nmaking our beds again, a Dame and two Damsels entered and a little girl\nwith candles, and she spake to Briolania and said, How is it Lady that\nyou have risen at such an hour? but when she heard they laughed and\nanswered, Now then Ladies go to sleep again, for you have nothing more\nto apprehend to-night.\n\nEarly in the morning we went to a wood where there were fine groves\nand fair gardens, and there we had tents pitched by a brook side. We\nfound there a round building with twelve marble pillars, the walls\nwere of crystal so curiously made that they who might be within could\nsee all without; the doors were made of plate of gold and of silver,\nand by every pillar there was placed the image of a Giant made in\ncopper, and these images had bows in their hands, and the arrow heads\nwere of fire. We were told that nothing could enter that chamber but\nwould be presently reduced to ashes by those arrows which never failed\nof their mark; and they put in two fallow deer and a stag, immediately\nthe images shot at them and they were reduced to ashes, and the arrows\nreturned to the bows from whence they fled. On the doors of the chamber\nthere were letters written which said, Let no man or woman dare enter\nhere except they twain who love each other truly, as truly as did\nGrimanesa and Apolidon, and they must enter here together, else will\nthey die the cruellest death that ever was seen. This enchantment will\nendure till they twain shall have entered the Forbidden Chamber, and\nthen shall all the enchantments of the Firm Island be done away. Then\nBriolania called Ysanjo and Enil, and told them she wished to see\nnothing more except the Arch of True Lovers and the Forbidden Chamber,\nand she asked Ysanjo the meaning of the Lion and Serpent, and of the\nHart and the Dogs. Lady, he replied, we know nothing more than that\nalways at that hour they appear; and the Hart and the Dogs run from the\nwindow into a lake which we believe proceeds from the sea, but were\nyou to remain here a whole year you could not see half the wonders\nthat are in this Island.\n\nOn the morrow we mounted our palfreys and returned to the Castle;\nwithout delay Briolania went to the Arch of True Lovers and past\nthrough the Forbidden Perrons like one who had never failed in her\nlove, and the image with the trumpet made so sweet a sound that we were\nall astonished, and when she entered where the images were of Apolidon\nand Grimanesa, it ceased with so sweet a finish as was marvellous to\nhear. There beheld she those images as fair and fresh as life, and\nbeing alone with them she thought herself in good company; and while\nthere she saw letters newly written in the Jasper, saying, this is the\nname of Briolania, daughter to King Tagadan of Sobradisa, the third\nDamsel that hath entered here. Then she felt a fear of being alone and\nreturned. The fifth morning she went to attempt the Forbidden Chamber;\nshe was in rich attire, and she wore nothing upon her beautiful head\nexcept a gold clasp with jewels, and all who saw her said, that if\nshe did not enter the Chamber there was none in the world who could,\nand that they should now see the end of all those enchantments. She\ncommended herself to God, and passed through the copper Perron, and\ncame up to the marble Perron and read the writing there, and proceeded\nso far beyond that all surely thought the adventure was atchieved; but\nwhen she was within three paces from the door three hands seized her\nby those beautiful locks, and pitilessly cast her out of the Forbidden\nground as they had done all others, and she lay in such plight that we\ncould not soon recover her. Till now Oriana's heart had been misgiving\nher, but now she looked at Mabilia and the Damsel of Denmark, and\nthey at her, being all well pleased; the next day pursued the Damsel,\nBriolania departed for her own kingdom. So the Damsel then received her\nbidding from Brisena and Oriana, and the other Ladies, and set out on\nher return to her Mistress.\n\nNow Amadis and his company arrived at the Firm Island, where they\nwere joyfully received by all the dwellers therein, who, as they had\nfelt great sorrow for the loss of their new Lord, so now had they\ndouble pleasure in welcoming him. But when those Knights who were\nwith him beheld the Castle how strong it was, and how there was no\nother entrance to the Island large as it was, and that the land was so\nfertile, and peopled with so many and such inhabitants, they thought\nit might maintain war against all the world; so they were lodged in\nthe largest town which stood under the Castle. You are to know that\nthis Island was nine leagues long and seven wide, all full of villages\nand rich dwelling-houses of the Knights of the land. And in the\npleasantest parts thereof Apolidon had built four palaces for himself,\nthe strangest and most delightful that ever man could behold. One was\nthat of the Serpent and the Lions. Another that of the Hart and the\nDogs. The third was called the Whirling Palace, for three times in the\nday and as often in the night it whirled round, so that they who were\nin it thought it would dash to pieces; and the fourth was that of the\nBull, because every day a wild Bull issued out of an old covered way,\nand ran among the people therein as though he would kill them, and\nwhen they fled from him he ran against the iron door of a tower and\nburst it open and went in, and presently he came out again being quite\ntame, and ridden by an old Ape, so wrinkled that his skin hung all in\nfolds, which Ape flogged him into the place from whence he came. Great\npleasure had all these Knights in beholding these enchantments, and\nenough pastime had they there, and they were all firm in their love to\nAmadis, and ready to follow him wherever he would.\n\nAt this time came Andalod the Hermit of the Poor Rock to establish the\nmonastery as had been appointed, and he seeing Amadis gave thanks to\nGod for giving life to so good a man, and looked at him and embraced\nhim as if he had never seen him before. But Amadis kist his hands, and\nwith all humility thanked him for his preservation and for his life,\nwhich he owed to God and to him. So a monastery was founded at the foot\nof the rock, where that Chapel of the Virgin stood, wherein Amadis had\nprayed in his despair before he departed into the mountain. A good man\ncalled Sisian, whom Andalod brought, remained there, and thirty Friars\nwith him, and Amadis assigned to them rents enough, and Andalod then\nreturned to the Poor Rock as before. Then Balays of Carsante arrived,\nhe whom Amadis had released from the dungeon of Arcalaus, who had gone\nto take leave of King Lisuarte, so soon as he knew that Amadis had\nleft him in discontent; with him also came Olivas whom Agrayes and\nDon Galvanes had helped in battle against the Duke of Bristol. They\nasked of Balays, what news in the court? he answered, enough to tell.\nKing Lisuarte Sir has summoned all his people; for Count Latine and\nthey whom he sent to take possession of the Island of Mongaza, have\ninformed him that the old Giant had given up to them all the Castles\nwhich he and his sons had in their keeping. But Gromadaza refused to\nyield the Castles by the Boiling Lake, which is the strongest place in\nthe Island, and also three other strong Castles, for she says she will\nnever yield the place where she was Mistress in the life of her husband\nFamongomadan, and Basagante her son, but always annoy Lisuarte to the\nutmost of her power, and for Madasima and the Damsels she cares not\nwhat may become of them so she can do any harm to the King. The King\ntherefore has summoned his forces, and hath sworn, if Gromadaza does\nnot yield up her Castles within a month, that he will behead Madasima\nand the Damsels, and that he will go against the Castle of the Boiling\nLake, and not depart from before it till he shall have won it, and if\nhe can take the old Giantess he will throw her to the Lions. At this\nnews they were all greatly troubled, and Galvanes said to them, Sirs,\nyou all know the promise which I have made to Madasima, to defend her\nwith reason, or if that failed by force of arms; and for this cause\nwas it that Amadis and all of us forsook Lisuarte; now I beseech you,\nif he will not hear reason, assist me in arms to fulfil my word. At\nthat uprose Don Florestan, and said, Don Galvanes, there are better\nadvisers here than I, but if reason fail I will undertake the battle in\nthe name of God. Good friend, replied Galvanes, I thank you with all my\nheart; but if it must be by battle I have promised and I will perform\nit. Then Don Brian of Monjaste and Quadragante said that the quarrel\nappertained to all, and all ought to bear a part, for all Knights were\nbound to succour Damsels who were opprest, and as Madasima and her\nDamsels had gone as hostages in obedience to her mother, they were\ninnocent before God. Sirs, said Amadis, you rejoice me in what you say;\nfor whatsoever is undertaken with such concord will have good issue.\nBut I will tell you what seems to me good: these Damsels are twelve in\nnumber, and therefore ought to be succoured by twelve Knights. Sure I\nam that such as ye will think such danger but pastime, if it please ye\nI will name twelve champions, and let the other Knights remain here for\ngreater perils if they should befal us. You, Sir Don Galvanes shall\nbe the first, as it is your quarrel, and Agrayes your nephew, and my\nbrother Florestan, and my cousins Palomir and Dragonis, and Don Brian\nof Monjaste, and Nicoran of the White Tower, and Urlandin and Gavarte\nof the Perilous Vale, and Ymosil brother to the Duke of Burgandy, and\nMadansil of the Silver Bridge, and Ladadin of Fajarque; let those\ntwelve go, there are among them the sons of Kings and Dukes and Counts,\nso that their peers will not be found. Hereat were all well pleased,\nand the Knights appointed made ready forthwith, and shortly after\nmidnight armed themselves and rode towards Tafilana, the town where\nLisuarte then was.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER 22._\n\n\nNow Oriana felt herself great with child, and she asked counsel of\nMabilia and the Damsel of Denmark in that danger; they albeit they were\nsore dismayed dissembled that, and Mabilia bade her take heart for all\nshould be remedied. I always expected, said she, that to such[347:A]\na saint such an offering would be brought. Oriana could not forbear a\nsmile. I will feign myself worse, she said, and withdraw as much as\nI can from all company; and if the Damsel of Denmark will hazard her\nhonour for me, my honour and life may both be saved. Lady, quoth the\nDamsel, I am at your command even were it to my death. Good friend,\nquoth Oriana, this I hoped, and if I live you shall recover your honour\nand with great praise. Then the Damsel knelt and kissed her hands, and\nOriana proceeded: continue to visit Adalasta the Abbess of my Nunnery\nas you have hitherto done, and when it is time tell her that you are\npregnant, and beseech her to help you, so that you may lay the child at\nthe church door, and that she will order it to be taken in and brought\nup for Charity's sake; thus will my secret be safe, nor will you be\nshamed, for none but this honourable Lady will know what you shall tell\nher, and she loves you much. Thus they determined that it should be.\n\n    [347:A] This is D'Herberay's phrase, it is better than the\n    original: Siempre me tuve por dicho que de tales juegos\n    auriades tal ganancia.\n\nWhen Lisuarte knew how Gromadaza persisted in her warfare, by advice\nof Gandandel and Brocadan he sent for Madasima and her Damsels, and\ntold them that they must all be put to death for an example. When she\nheard this so rigorous doom the fair and fresh colour of her cheeks\nsuddenly changed to a pale and deadly hue, and falling at the King's\nfeet she said, Sir, the fear of death doth make my heart weaker than\nit naturally is, weak Damsel as I am, so that I have neither thought\nnor words to answer you; but if in this court there be any Knight\nwilling to uphold the right let him speak for me as a Knight is bound\nto do, for I did not enter your prison willingly but in obedience to\nmy mother. If there be none such here, do you O King, whom hitherto\nnever distressed Dame or Damsel hath implored in vain, do you deal\njustly by me, and let not anger have the mastery over you. Gandandel,\nwho was present, was greatly desirous that Madasima should be slain,\nknowing that then Amadis could never be reconciled with the King; and\nhe said, Sir, do not hear her, these Damsels were given you as hostages\nto die if the conditions were not performed, and therefore justice\nought to be executed without delay. But Don Grumedan, who was a good\nKnight, and well versed in all the laws of Knighthood, as one who had\nnot only practised but read much, replied, that shall not the King\ndo if it please God! nor ever shall such cruelty and wrong be by him\ncommitted. This Damsel came hither in obedience to her mother, and as\nthat obedience will in secret be by God rewarded, so should it be in\npublic by the King as his servant, and one who obeys his will. Moreover\nI have learnt that within three days here will arrive certain Knights\nfrom the Firm Island to take up their quarrel; and if you Gandandel, or\nyour sons are willing to maintain the justice of your advice; you will\nthere find those who will answer you. Gandandel answered, Don Grumedan,\ntho' you wish me ill I have never deserved it at your hands; if you had\noffended my sons you know they are such Knights that they can maintain\nwhat I have said. We shall soon see that, quoth old Grumedan; as for\nyou I only wish you well or ill as it shall be found that you have\ncounselled the King. Albeit that Lisuarte had acted much amiss toward\nAmadis, and had it in his heart to do him all displeasure, yet could\nnot that new passion subdue his old virtue, so that he was glad at\nwhat Grumedan said, and asked who the Knights were that were coming to\ndefend the Damsels, and when Grumedan had told their names, he observed\nthat they were enough good and prudent Knights. But then was Gandandel\nsore dismayed, and he repented him of what he had said concerning his\nsons, knowing that they were nothing equal in arms to Florestan and\nAgrayes, and Don Brian of Monjaste, and Gavarte of the Perilous Vale.\nSo when Madasima was remanded to prison he went to his brother-in-law\nBrocadan in trouble of heart, receiving now the guerdon which the\nmerits of his misdeed deserved.\n\nHere came to pass what the Gospel saith, That no hidden thing but\nshall be made known; for Gandandel retiring with Brocadan to a private\nchamber to consult with him how they might prevail upon the King to\nexecute Madasima and her Damsels before the Knights of the Firm Island\narrived, Brocadan began to reproach him for the wrong he had done to\nAmadis, greatly repenting his own wickedness now that he saw his own\nhonour and his sons in danger. Now it happened that a niece of Brocadan\nwas enamoured of a young Knight called Sarquiles, who was nephew to\nAngriote of Estravaus, and she had hidden him near this chamber, so\nthat he heard the whole secret of this treachery; and when it was night\nhe went out and armed himself, and mounting his horse he rode on the\nmorrow into the town as if he came from another place, and he went\nbefore the King and said to him, Sir, I am your natural subject and was\nbrought up in your household, and therefore would save you from all\ntreachery, that you may not commit wrong in compliance with another's\nwill. It is not three days since I was in a place where I heard persons\ncounselling how to instigate you to do an evil thing against your own\nhonour and good reason. I say to you, give no heed to Gandandel and\nBrocadan in what they say to you, touching Madasima, for there are\nothers in your court who more honestly advise you; you and all here\nshall know wherefore I say this, within twelve days, if you will delay\nfollowing their will for so long. Now Sir, God be with you, for I go\nto my Uncle Angriote. God be with you, replied Lisuarte, and remained\nmusing on what he had heard.\n\nSarquiles rode on by the shortest way he knew to the Firm Island, and\nwhen he arrived there his horse was so overspent with the speed he had\nmade that he could scarcely carry him. He found Amadis, and Angriote,\nand Don Bruneo, riding on the shore to hasten the equipment of some\nvessels which they had ordered to pass over to Gaul, for Amadis was\ndesirous to see his parents. Right well was Sarquiles received, and\nAngriote said to him, Nephew, what business have you that your horse\nis in such plight? Very great, replied he, and he told him how his\nMistress Gandaza had hidden him in Brocadan's house, and what he had\nthere heard. Now Sir, quoth Angriote to Amadis, was my suspicion right?\nYou would not suffer me to bring the matter to an end, but now if it\nplease God neither you nor ought else shall let, but that this great\ntreason against the King and against you shall be made manifest. Good\nfriend, replied Amadis, you may now do it with reason and certainty,\nand God therewith will speed you. I will depart to-morrow, said\nAngriote, and Sarquiles upon another horse with me. Accordingly on the\nfollowing morning they twain set out for the dwelling of King Lisuarte.\n\nMeantime the King mused much upon that Sarquiles had told him. One day\nGandandel and Brocadan came before him and said, Sir, we are grieved\nto see how little you regard your own welfare; that, quoth Lisuarte,\nmay well be, but why say you this?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Because these Knights who are your\nenemies are coming to your Court without any fear to defend these\nDamsels for whom you ought to have the land given up. If you will take\nour advice you ought to behead them before these champions arrive, and\nsend to forbid the Knights to enter your kingdom; thus would you make\nthem fear you, and Amadis would not venture to offer you any wrong,\nfor if they do not forbear for fear, for nothing else will they; the\nsooner this is done the better will it be, and the more terror will\nit strike. The King then called to mind the words of Sarquiles, and\nsaw how he had spoken truth. You tell me two things, he replied,\nagainst all reason: the one that without any form of judgment I should\nhave these Damsels slain, what account could I give to the Lord whose\nminister I am if I should do this? He has appointed me here in his\nstead to administer right in his name, and if I did this wrong which\nyou counsel to strike fear into others, it would fall upon my own head\nat last. Those Kings who follow their own will instead of what is\nreasonable rely on themselves and not on God, which is the worst error\ninto which they can fall. Their best security is to chuse out good\ncounsellors, and honest ones, and to remember that however evil actions\nappear at first, the just Judge directs, and the end thereof cannot be\ngood. You tell me also to forbid these Knights from coming to my court;\na dishonourable thing would it be to prevent any one from claiming\njustice before me, much more they being my enemies, for it is to my\nhonour that I have the power and inclination to do what they request.\nI do not like your counsel! you have done ill to those who deserved no\nill at your hands! I have sinned and I have my punishment; and if you\nhave been false so I trust will you have yours at the end. And with\nthat he went away and left them.\n\nThe following day Lisuarte rode forth after mass with a great company,\nand seeing that the twelve Knights were approaching he rode forward to\nreceive them, for he was a courteous man to all, and they well deserved\nsuch honour being what they were. They made obeisance to him, and while\ntheir people pitched tents in the field Don Galvanes spake to the King.\nSir, confiding in your virtue and in your wonted goodness, we are\ncome hither to request that you will hear Madasima and her Damsels,\nthat they may have their right; we are come to plead their cause, and\nif by that means we cannot succeed, let it not offend you Sir if we\nsupport it by arms, for there is no cause wherefore they ought to die.\nThe King answered, go now and rest yourselves, I will do all that can\njustly be done. Don Brian of Monjaste then replied, So Sir we hoped,\nthat you would do what behoved your royal dignity and your conscience,\nand whenever you have failed so to act it has been the work of evil\nadvisers, and that, if it did not offend you, I would prove upon any\none who dared gainsay. Don Brian, quoth the King, if you would listen\nto your father I know that you would neither forsake me for another,\nnor come hither to plead against me. Sir, replied Don Brian, my\npleading is for you, it is that you should do justice, and not listen\nto those who would serve you less faithfully than I, and stain your\nworth. You say Sir, that if I had listened to my father I should not\nforsake you: I have not forsaken you Sir, for I never was yours, albeit\nI am of your lineage. I came to your court to seek my kinsman Amadis,\nand when you were pleased that he should be no longer yours, then I\ndeparted with him; in all this I have not erred a single point of duty.\nThe King then returned to the town, and they remained in their tents\nwhere they were visited by their friends. But for Oriana I tell you she\nnever left the window, looking at those who so loved her lover, and\nbeseeching God to give them the victory in this appeal.\n\nThat night did Gandandel and Brocadan pass in great perplexity, wishing\nthat they could recall what was past, but now perforce must they go on.\nOn the morrow the twelve Knights heard mass with the King, and that\ndone accompanied him to his palace. He then called for Gandandel and\nBrocadan, and said to them, You must now support the advice which you\nhave always given me in the affair of Madasima, and make these good men\nunderstand why she ought not to be heard, and he bade them stand where\nall might hear them. Ymosil of Burgandy, and Ladadin of Fajarque then\ncame forward and said, We Sir, and these Knights beseech you of your\ngoodness that Madasima and her Damsels may be heard, for so we conceive\nit is right. Then answered Gandandel, many talk about the right and\nfew know what it is; you say that of right these Damsels ought to be\nheard, which of right they ought not, for without any such condition\nthey bound themselves to death, and entered the prison of the King\nthereupon, that if Ardan Canileo were slain or vanquished, and the\nwhole Island of Mongaza were not then freely surrendered, they and the\nKnights with them should suffer death. The Knights delivered up the\nCastles in their keeping, which Gromadaza will not do, therefore there\nneither is nor can be reason for which they should be excused from\ndeath. Ymosil replied, Certes Gandandel, you might have been excused\nfrom uttering such reasons before so good a King and such Knights as\nare here! It is manifest to all who have any knowledge, that man or\nwoman are to be heard, of right in their own defence, in all cases\nexcept in treason and conspiracy; this is the custom in all lands\nwherein justice is observed, and this is what we require. Gandandel\nreplied, that nothing more was to be said: the King was to decide, so\nthe matter was at issue, and the King remained with certain Knights,\nall the others leaving the hall.\n\nThe King wished his Uncle Argamonte, an honourable Count and of great\nprudence, to deliver his opinion, but he referred it to the King,\nsaying that none so fully understood what was right as he himself; the\nother counsellors did the same. Lisuarte seeing this then said, Since\nyou leave the decision to me, I think Ymosil of Burgundy hath spoken\nto the purpose, and the Damsels should be heard. Certes Sir, quoth the\nCount, and all they who were present said the same, you have determined\njustly, for thus it ought to be. They then called in the Knights and\nsaid what had been resolved; for this Ymosil and Ladadin of Fajarque\nkissed his hands and said, be pleased therefore Sir to let Madasima\nand her Damsels be summoned, and we will save them by fair reason, or\nby arms if need shall be. Let them come, replied the King, and see if\nthey will commit their cause to you. Presently they came before the\nKing so modestly and in such fear that not a man could behold them\nwithout great pity. The twelve Knights of the Firm Island took them by\nthe hand, and Agrayes, Florestan, Ymosil and Ladadin said to Madasima,\nLady Madasima, these Knights come to save you and your Damsels from\ndeath, will you commit your cause to us? Sirs, she replied, if the\ncause of Damsels so forlorn and wretched may be undertaken, we commit\nit to you, and trust in God and you. Since it is so, quoth Ymosil, let\nwho will come forward against you! if he be one I will defend you by\nreason or by arms; if more, twelve shall be answered. The King looked\nat Gandandel and Brocadan, and saw that they looked down, and were\ndismayed, and did not answer. Return to your lodgings till the morrow,\nsaid Lisuarte, and meanwhile those who are to answer you will take\ncounsel. The Knights then conducted Madasima to her prison and went to\ntheir tents.\n\nLisuarte led Gandandel and Brocadan aside, and said to them, you have\noften urged me to put those Damsels to death, and said you would\nmaintain the justice of the deed by reason, or your sons should in\narms, if need should be, now then do as you said, for what Ymosil\nadvances seems just to me, and I will not appoint any of my Court to\ncombat against these Knights. Look ye to it! Else will the Damsels be\ndelivered, and I shall have been ill advised by ye, and wrongfully.\nThey replied, that to-morrow they would be ready with their reply, and\nreturned very sorrowfully to their homes. And they agreed to persist\nin their advice and maintain it by reason, but not put their sons in\ndanger, because the cause was not just, and they were not such in arms\nas those Knights. But that same evening tidings came to the King how\nGromadaza the Giantess was dead, and had ordered her Castles to be\ndelivered up to save her daughter and the Damsels, and that they had\naccordingly been yielded to Count Latine. Greatly pleased thereat was\nLisuarte, and when the Knights came before him on the morrow he said,\nproceed no farther in this cause, for you are quit of your defence,\nand the Damsels are free; the Castles for which I held them in pledge\nhaving been surrendered. Gandandel and Brocadan then rejoiced, for they\nsurely expected to be dishonoured. Then Lisuarte sent for Madasima and\nthe Damsels, and said to them, ye are free; do what it pleases you, the\nCastles have been given up; but he would not tell her that her mother\nwas dead. Madasima would have kissed his hand but the King permitted\nnot that, for he never suffered Dame or Damsel to kiss his hand save\nwhen he bestowed upon them some boon. Then said she, since you leave me\nat my own disposal; I give myself to my Lord Galvanes, who hath been so\nwilling to help me. Agrayes took her by the hand and said, good Lady,\nyou do that which is right; and though you are now disherited of your\nown land, you shall be honoured in another till it please God to remedy\nyour loss. But Ymosil then said to the King, Sir, if right be done to\nMadasima she will not be disherited, for children who are in the power\nof their parents must obey them, however unwillingly, but not for that\nshould they be disherited, when obedience and not free will hath made\nthem bind themselves to what their parents commanded. And because you\nSir are appointed here to make every one render to another his right,\nso ought you yourself to do as an example. Ymosil, replied the King,\nyou have the Damsels at liberty, say no more upon this other matter; I\nhave had sufficient trouble about that land, and will defend it now it\nis mine, nor can I take it from my daughter Leonoreta, to whom I have\ngranted it. Don Galvanes then said, Sir, that right which Madasima has\nto the land of her fathers is now mine. I beseech you remember some\nservices which I have done you, and do not disinherit me, for I would\nwillingly be your vassal and stand in your favour, and serve you as\nloyally as it is possible. Say no more Don Galvanes, quoth Lisuarte,\nthat is done which cannot be undone. Since it is so, quoth he, that I\nfind neither right nor courtesy here, I shall strive to win it how I\ncan. Do your utmost, replied the King, it was in the power of those\nwho were stronger than you, and easier will it be to defend it from\nyou, than it was to win it from them. You won it, answered Galvanes,\nby means of one who was badly guerdoned, he will help to recover it.\nIf he helps you, cried Lisuarte, many others will serve me who would\nnot serve me before for his sake, when I had him in my household and\nprotected him from them. Agrayes then grew angry and exclaimed, Certes\nall here, and others beside can tell whether Amadis was protected by\nyou or you by him, though you are a King and he was always as an Errant\nKnight. Don Florestan seeing how Agrayes was moved laid hand upon his\nshoulder and drew him back, and then said himself, it seems, Sir, you\nprize the services of these you speak of above those of Amadis, whether\nthey be so indeed, we shall soon see. Don Brian of Monjaste then stept\nforward, however little you esteem the services of Amadis and his\nfriends, they must be of great worth indeed who can reasonably make\nthem to be forgotten. It is plain Don Brian, replied the King, that\nyou are one of those friends!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Sure Sir I am; he is my kinsman and I\nshall do what he pleases. We have enough, quoth Lisuarte, to dispense\nwith you. All you have, replied Don Brian, will be wanted to resist\nwhat Amadis can do. The Knights on both sides drew nigh to answer, but\nLisuarte stretched out a wand which he held and commanded them to say\nno more, and they returned to their places.\n\nJust then Angriote of Estravaus, and his nephew Sarquiles entered,\ncompleatly armed, and approached to kiss the King's hand. The twelve\nKnights marvelled at their coming being ignorant of the cause thereof,\nbut Gandandel and Brocadan were put in fear, and they looked at each\nother, for they knew what Angriote had said of them before, and albeit\nthey held him for the best Knight in the King's dominions, yet they\ntook courage to answer what he might say; and they called their sons\nand bade them say nothing more than they should tell them. Angriote\nstood up before the King and said, Sir, let Gandandel and Brocadan\ncome hither, and I will say that to them which shall make you and\nall present know them better than ye have hitherto done. The King\naccordingly called on them to come forward, and all the Knights drew\nnigh to hear. Then said Angriote, know Sir that Gandandel and Brocadan\nare disloyal and false toward you, they counselled you wickedly and\nlyingly, neither regarding God, nor you, nor Amadis, who had so\nhonoured them, and had never done them wrong. They, villains as they\nare, told you that Amadis designed to seize your kingdom, a thing which\nnever was in his thoughts, for what he desired hath ever been your\nservice, and thus have they made you lose the best Knight that ever\nKing had to serve him, and many other good Knights with him, for no\nfault of their own. Therefore I say that these wicked and false men, in\nwhom you trusted, have committed a great treason against you, which if\nthey deny, I will do battle with them both; but if their age excuses\nthem, let their sons come forward, and by God's help I will make them\nconfess the disloyalty of their fathers before you, that you shall\nunderstand it. Sir, replied Gandandel, you see how Angriote comes to\ndishonour your court! and this is because you permit those to enter\nyour land who do not seek your service, if you had prevented that at\nfirst this would not have happened; and now Sir do not marvel if Amadis\nshould come hither to-morrow and defy you yourself! If Angriote had\nmet me in those days when I did good service in arms for this kingdom,\nand for your brother King Falangris, he would not then have dared to\nsay what now he says, but now he sees me old and weak, and dares insult\nme as one already overcome; this shame Sir falls more upon you than me.\nNo Sir Knave, quoth Angriote, I am not come hither to dishonour the\nCourt, but for its honour to destroy treason, and root out the tares\nwhich you have scattered among the good seed! Then said Sarquiles,\nSir, you know the words which I spake to you upon this matter; with my\nown ears I heard the villainy which these old traitors were devising;\nthey are old, but their sons are young and strong; let them answer for\nthem, they are three and we are two, then will God discover the truth,\nand it will be seen if they are such as to make amends for the loss of\nAmadis and his lineage as their fathers have boasted! When the two sons\nof Gandandel heard this, and saw that the whole Court were smiling to\nsee their fathers so prest, they thrust angrily through the throng, and\ncame before the King and said, Sir, Angriote lies in all that he hath\nsaid and we will combat with him; here are our gages, and they threw\ntheir gloves into his lap. Angriote then held out the lappet of his\narmour\u00e2\u0080\u0094here Sir is mine! let them go arm themselves, and do you Sir\nbehold the battle. The King answered, the day is far spent and there\nwill not be time, let it be after mass to-morrow. With that Adamas\ncame up, the son of Brocadan by a sister of Gandandel; he was great of\nstature and strong, but of so villainous a nature that none esteemed\nhim. He said to the King, Sir, Sarquiles lies in all he hath said,\nand if he dare enter the field with his Uncle I will combat him! at\nthis Sarquiles right joyfully gave his gage; the Court then broke up.\nAngriote and Sarquiles went with the twelve Knights and Madasima, who\nhad taken leave of the Queen and of Oriana, and Brisena sent her a rich\ntent to lodge in.\n\nThe King remained with Don Grumedan and Giontes his nephew; he sent for\nGandandel and Brocadan, and said to them, I marvel at you! you have\nso often told me that Amadis designed treason and meant to seize my\nkingdom, and now when the proof was necessary you shrunk from it! and\nhave suffered your sons to risque themselves who know not what is the\njustice of their cause. You have sinned against God and me; great evil\nhave you done me in making me lose such a man and such Knights, but you\nwill not escape without your punishment, for that just Judge will give\nto every one his due. Sir, said Gandandel, my sons came forward hastily\nthinking that the proof was delayed. Of a truth, quoth Grumedan, they\nthought right; for there neither is nor can be proof that Amadis in\nthis or in aught else hath done wrong toward the King, and if you\nsuspect it, it is against all reason; even the devils in hell cannot\nthink so! If you had a thousand heads, and the King were to cut them\nall off, he would not be enough revenged for the wrong you have done\nhim, and now you will be left for more mischief, which God forbid! and\nyour wretched sons must suffer for your fault! Don Grumedan, said they,\nwhatever you believe and wish we trust that our sons will save their\nhonour and our own. God never save me, replied he, if I wish more than\nthat you be rewarded as your counsel deserves. The King then bade them\ncease, and he went to table, and they departed to their homes.\n\nThat night the arms and horses of the champions were made ready.\nAngriote and Sarquiles past the remainder of the night from midnight\nin a chapel of Saint Mary, which was near their tents. At day-break\nthe twelve Knights armed themselves, for they doubted the King seeing\nhow wroth he was against them, and with Madasima and her Damsels, each\nupon her palfrey, they rode through the town to the field of battle,\nAngriote and Sarquiles going before them. The King and his Knights\nwere already assembled, and three Judges were appointed: King Arban of\nNorth Wales, and Giontes the King's Nephew, and Quinorante the good\nJouster; they placed Angriote and Sarquiles at one end of the lists.\nPresently the two brothers Tarin and Corian came with their cousin\nAdamas, well armed and mounted, and disposed to do their part well, if\nthe wickedness of their fathers had not been against them. They being\nopposed each to the other, Giontes blew his trumpet and they ran the\ncareer, Corian and Tarin at Angriote, and Adamas against Sarquiles.\nTarin broke his lance upon Angriote, who encountered Corian, and bore\nhim from his saddle, then turned and saw Tarin sword in hand. Tarin\nstruck at him but the blow fell upon the horses' head and wounded him,\nand cut away the headstall, so that the reins fell on his neck, and the\nhorse being thus at liberty, Angriote was carried against his enemy,\nand they dashed against each other and Tarin fell; then Angriote leaped\nlightly from his horse as one accustomed to such perils, and took his\nshield, and laid hand upon that sword with which he had heretofore\ndealt so many and mighty blows. He saw his nephew maintaining a brave\nsword-combat on horseback, and then made at the two brethren who stood\nby each other, and laid on him a heavy load like brave and strong\nKnights. But Angriote well defended himself, holding out his shield\nagainst one and laying on the other with the sword, so that he made\nthem give back, for never stroke came from him that did not shear away\nthe armour, for as I have told you this Knight was the best foyner\nwith the sword of any in the King's dominions. So that their shields\nwere soon chipt away, and their harness broken that the blood started\nthrough, nor was he so whole but that the blood ran from many wounds.\nWhen Sarquiles saw how his Uncle sped, and that he was still coping\nin equal battle with Adamas, he spurred his horse and grappled with\nhis enemy, and there they struggled each to overthrow the other.\nAngriote seeing them drew nigh to succour Sarquiles if he should fall\nundermost, and the two brethren followed him to help their cousin. At\nlength the two Knights fell from their horses, still grappling; then\nmight you have seen a great conflict, Angriote pressing to help his\nnephew and the brethren to assist Adamas. But in that hour Angriote\ndid such wonders in arms, and laid on such terrible and heavy blows\nthat the brethren, albeit they did their utmost, could not save Adamas\nfrom the hands of Sarquiles. When Gandandel and Brocadan saw this, who\ntill now had hoped that the valour of their sons might have defended\ntheir wickedness they withdrew from the window in great sorrow and pain\nof heart, and the King withdrew also, for all the good fortune which\nbefell the friends of Amadis displeased him, and he would not witness\nthe victory of Angriote. But all else who were present rejoiced to see\nthat Gandandel and Brocadan would suffer some part of the punishment on\nearth which they deserved. The four Knights meantime continued their\nfierce conflict, but it did not long endure, for now Tarin and Corian\ngave ground and fled, seeking some place of safety, but finding none\nthey turned, and struck again at their pursuers and then again fled,\ntill they were smitten down and slain to the great joy of Madasima\nand her Damsels, and the Knights of the Firm Island, but above all of\nOriana, who had never ceased praying to God to grant her friends that\nvictory. Angriote then asked the Judges if there was aught more to be\ndone? they replied, he had done enough for his honour, and led the two\nchampions from the lists; their comrades then received and took them\nwith Madasima to their tents where they were healed of their wounds.\n\n\n_Here endeth the Second Book of Amadis of Gaul._\n\n\nEND OF THE SECOND VOLUME.\n\n\n\n\nINDEX.\n\nVOL.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":378,"split":"train"}
