{"ori_id":"c4241815627ac0077304ccdea892cd469a59334a","title":"Edward III (play)","context":"Edward III (play)\n King Edward III is informed by The Count of Artois that he, Edward, was the true heir to the previous king of France. A French ambassador arrives to insist that Edward do homage to the new French king for his lands in Guyenne. Edward defies him, insisting he will invade to enforce his rights. A messenger arrives to say that the Scots are besieging a castle in the north of England. Edward decides to deal with this problem first. The castle is being held by the beautiful Countess of Salisbury, the wife of the Earl of Salisbury. As Edward's army arrives, the rampaging Scots flee. Edward immediately falls for the Countess, and proceeds to woo her for himself. She rebuffs him, but he persists. In an attempted bluff, the Countess vows to take the life of her husband if Edward will take the life of his wife. However, when she sees that Edward finds the plan morally acceptable, she ultimately threatens to take her own life if he does not stop his pursuit. Finally, Edward expresses great shame, admits his fault and acquiesces. He dedicates himself to use his energies to pursue his rights and duties as king.\nIn the second part of the play, in several scenes reminiscent of Henry V, Edward joins his army in France, fighting a war to claim the French throne. He and the French king exchange arguments for their claims before the Battle of Crecy. King Edward's son, Edward, the Black Prince, is knighted and sent into battle. The king refuses to send help to his son when it appears that the young man's life is in danger. Prince Edward proves himself in battle after defeating the king of Bohemia. The English win the battle and the French flee to Poitiers. Edward sends the prince to pursue them, while he besieges Calais.\nIn Poitiers the prince finds himself outnumbered and apparently surrounded. The play switches between the French and English camps, where the apparent hopelessness of the English campaign is contrasted with the arrogance of the French. Prince Edward broods on the morality of war before achieving victory in the Battle of Poitiers against seemingly insurmountable odds. He captures the French king.\nIn Calais the citizens realise they will have to surrender to King Edward. Edward demands that six of the leading citizens be sent out to face punishment. Edward's wife, Queen Philippa, arrives and persuades him to pardon them. Sir John Copland brings Edward the king of the Scots, captured in battle, and a messenger informs Edward that the English have secured Brittany. However, the successes are undercut when news arrives that Prince Edward was facing certain defeat at Poitiers. King Edward declares he will take revenge. Prince Edward arrives with news of his victory, bringing with him the captured French king. The English enter Calais in triumph.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bf\nProject Gutenberg Etext of The Reign of King Edward the Third,\nattributed in part to William Shakespeare.\n\nPG has multiple editions of William Shakespeare's Complete Works\n\n\nCopyright laws are changing all over the world, be sure to check\nthe copyright laws for your country before posting these files!!\n\nPlease take a look at the important information in this header.\nWe encourage you to keep this file on your own disk, keeping an\nelectronic path open for the next readers.

Therefore, we usually do NOT! keep\nthese books in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nWe are now trying to release all our books one month in advance\nof the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.\n\nPlease note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till\nmidnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.\nThe official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at\nMidnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A\npreliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment\nand editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an\nup to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes\nin the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has\na bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a\nlook at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a\nnew copy has at least one byte more or less.\n\n\nInformation about Project Gutenberg (one page)\n\nWe produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The\ntime it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours\nto get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\nmillion dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text\nfiles per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the\ntotal should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.\n\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\nFiles by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\nwhich is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.\n\nAt our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third\nof that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we\nmanage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly\nfrom Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an\nassortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few\nmore years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we\ndon't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.\n\nWe need your donations more than ever!\n\n\nAll donations should be made to \"Project Gutenberg\/CMU\": and are\ntax deductible to the extent allowable by law.

for, writing of her eyes,\nI'll say that like a glass they catch the sun,\nAnd thence the hot reflection doth rebound\nAgainst the breast, and burns my heart within.\nAh, what a world of descant makes my soul\nUpon this voluntary ground of love!--\nCome, Lodowick, hast thou turned thy ink to gold?\nIf not, write but in letters Capital\nMy mistress' name, and it will gild thy paper:\nRead, Lord, read;\nFill thou the empty hollows of mine ears\nWith the sweet hearing of thy poetry.\n\nLODOWICK.\nI have not to a period brought her praise.\n\nKING EDWARD.\nHer praise is as my love, both infinite,\nWhich apprehend such violent extremes,\nThat they disdain an ending period.\nHer beauty hath no match but my affection;\nHers more than most, mine most and more than more:\nHers more to praise than tell the sea by drops,\nNay, more than drop the massy earth by sands,\nAnd sand by sand print them in memory:\nThen wherefore talkest thou of a period\nTo that which craves unended admiration?\nRead, let us hear.\n\nLODOWICK.\n'More fair and chaste than is the queen of shades,'--\n\nKING EDWARD.\nThat line hath two faults, gross and palpable:\nComparest thou her to the pale queen of night,\nWho, being set in dark, seems therefore light?\nWhat is she, when the sun lifts up his head,\nBut like a fading taper, dim and dead?\nMy love shall brave the eye of heaven at noon,\nAnd, being unmasked, outshine the golden sun.\n\nLODOWICK.\nWhat is the other fault, my sovereign Lord?\n\nKING EDWARD.\nRead o'er the line again.\n\nLODOWICK.\n'More fair and chaste'--\n\nKING EDWARD.\nI did not bid thee talk of chastity,\nTo ransack so the treasure of her mind;\nFor I had rather have her chased than chaste.\nOut with the moon line, I will none of it;\nAnd let me have her likened to the sun:\nSay she hath thrice more splendour than the sun,\nThat her perfections emulate the sun,\nThat she breeds sweets as plenteous as the sun,\nThat she doth thaw cold winter like the sun,\nThat she doth cheer fresh summer like the sun,\nThe she doth dazzle gazers like the sun;\nAnd, in this application to the sun,\nBid her be free and general as the sun,\nWho smiles upon the basest weed that grows\nAs lovingly as on the fragrant rose.\nLet's see what follows that same moonlight line.\n\nLODOWICK.\n'More fair and chaste than is the queen of shades,\nMore bold in constance'--\n\nKING EDWARD.\nIn constance! than who?\n\nLODOWICK.\n'Than Judith was.'\n\nKING EDWARD.\nO monstrous line!

Thrice gentle King,\nAcquaint me with your cause of discontent.\n\nKING EDWARD.\nHow near then shall I be to remedy?\n\n\nCOUNTESS.\nAs near, my Liege, as all my woman's power\nCan pawn it self to buy thy remedy.\n\nKING EDWARD.\nIf thou speakst true, then have I my redress:\nEngage thy power to redeem my Joys,\nAnd I am joyful, Countess; else I die.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nI will, my Liege.\n\nKING EDWARD.\nSwear, Countess, that thou wilt.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nBy heaven, I will.\n\nKING EDWARD.\nThen take thy self a little way a side,\nAnd tell thy self, a King doth dote on thee;\nSay that within thy power it doth lie\nTo make him happy, and that thou hast sworn\nTo give him all the Joy within thy power:\nDo this, and tell me when I shall be happy.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nAll this is done, my thrice dread sovereign:\nThat power of love, that I have power to give,\nThou hast with all devout obedience;\nEmploy me how thou wilt in proof thereof.\n\nKING EDWARD.\nThou hearst me say that I do dote on thee.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nIf on my beauty, take it if thou canst;\nThough little, I do prize it ten times less;\nIf on my virtue, take it if thou canst,\nFor virtue's store by giving doth augment;\nBe it on what it will, that I can give\nAnd thou canst take away, inherit it.\n\nKING EDWARD.\nIt is thy beauty that I would enjoy.\n\n\nCOUNTESS.\nO, were it painted, I would wipe it off\nAnd dispossess my self, to give it thee.\nBut, sovereign, it is soldered to my life:\nTake one and both; for, like an humble shadow,\nIt haunts the sunshine of my summer's life.\n\nKING EDWARD.\nBut thou maist lend it me to sport with all.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nAs easy may my intellectual soul\nBe lent away, and yet my body live,\nAs lend my body, palace to my soul,\nAway from her, and yet retain my soul.\nMy body is her bower, her Court, her abbey,\nAnd she an Angel, pure, divine, unspotted:\nIf I should leave her house, my Lord, to thee,\nI kill my poor soul and my poor soul me.\n\nKING EDWARD.\nDidst thou not swear to give me what I would?\n\nCOUNTESS.\nI did, my liege, so what you would I could.\n\nKING EDWARD.\nI wish no more of thee than thou maist give:--\nNor beg I do not, but I rather buy--\nThat is, thy love; and for that love of thine\nIn rich exchange I tender to thee mine.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nBut that your lips were sacred, my Lord,\nYou would profane the holy name of love.\nThat love you offer me you cannot give,\nFor Caesar owes that tribute to his Queen;\nThat love you beg of me I cannot give,\nFor Sara owes that duty to her Lord.\nHe that doth clip or counterfeit your stamp\nShall die, my Lord; and will your sacred self\nCommit high treason against the King of heaven,\nTo stamp his Image in forbidden metal,\nForgetting your allegiance and your oath?\nIn violating marriage sacred law,\nYou break a greater honor than your self:\nTo be a King is of a younger house\nThan to be married; your progenitour,\nSole reigning Adam on the universe,\nBy God was honored for a married man,\nBut not by him anointed for a king.\nIt is a penalty to break your statutes,\nThough not enacted with your highness' hand:\nHow much more, to infringe the holy act,\nMade by the mouth of God, sealed with his hand?\nI know, my sovereign, in my husband's love,\nWho now doth loyal service in his wars,\nDoth but so try the wife of Salisbury,\nWhither she will hear a wanton's tale or no,\nLest being therein guilty by my stay,\n>From that, not from my liege, I turn away.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nKING EDWARD.\nWhether is her beauty by her words dying,\nOr are her words sweet chaplains to her beauty?\nLike as the wind doth beautify a sail,\nAnd as a sail becomes the unseen wind,\nSo do her words her beauties, beauties words.\nO, that I were a honey gathering bee,\nTo bear the comb of virtue from this flower,\nAnd not a poison sucking envious spider,\nTo turn the juice I take to deadly venom!\nReligion is austere and beauty gentle;\nToo strict a guardian for so fair a ward!\nO, that she were, as is the air, to me!\nWhy, so she is, for when I would embrace her,\nThis do I, and catch nothing but my self.\nI must enjoy her;

nor I would not, if I could.\n\n\nKING EDWARD.\nBut, if thou dost, what shall I say to thee?\n\nWARWICK.\nWhat may be said to any perjured villain,\nThat breaks the sacred warrant of an oath.\n\nKING EDWARD.\nWhat wilt thou say to one that breaks an oath?\n\nWARWICK.\nThat he hath broke his faith with God and man,\nAnd from them both stands excommunicate.\n\nKING EDWARD.\nWhat office were it, to suggest a man\nTo break a lawful and religious vow?\n\nWARWICK.\nAn office for the devil, not for man.\n\nKING EDWARD.\nThat devil's office must thou do for me,\nOr break thy oath, or cancel all the bonds\nOf love and duty twixt thy self and me;\nAnd therefore, Warwick, if thou art thy self,\nThe Lord and master of thy word and oath,\nGo to thy daughter; and in my behalf\nCommand her, woo her, win her any ways,\nTo be my mistress and my secret love.\nI will not stand to hear thee make reply:\nThy oath break hers, or let thy sovereign die.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nWARWICK.\nO doting King!

and in this manner following\nObraids thee with thine arrogant intrusion:\nFirst, I condemn thee for a fugitive,\nA thievish pirate, and a needy mate,\nOne that hath either no abiding place,\nOr else, inhabiting some barren soil,\nWhere neither herb or fruitful grain is had,\nDoest altogether live by pilfering:\nNext, insomuch thou hast infringed thy faith,\nBroke leage and solemn covenant made with me,\nI hold thee for a false pernicious wretch:\nAnd, last of all, although I scorn to cope\nWith one so much inferior to my self,\nYet, in respect thy thirst is all for gold,\nThy labour rather to be feared than loved,\nTo satisfy thy lust in either part,\nHere am I come, and with me have I brought\nExceeding store of treasure, pearl, and coin.\nLeave, therefore, now to persecute the weak,\nAnd armed entering conflict with the armed,\nLet it be seen, mongest other petty thefts,\nHow thou canst win this pillage manfully.\n\nKING EDWARD.\nIf gall or wormwood have a pleasant taste,\nThen is thy salutation honey sweet;\nBut as the one hath no such property,\nSo is the other most satirical.\nYet wot how I regard thy worthless taunts:\nIf thou have uttered them to foil my fame\nOr dim the reputation of my birth,\nKnow that thy wolvish barking cannot hurt;\nIf slyly to insinuate with the world,\nAnd with a strumpet's artificial line\nTo paint thy vicious and deformed cause,\nBe well assured, the counterfeit will fade,\nAnd in the end thy foul defects be seen;\nBut if thou didst it to provoke me on,\nAs who should say I were but timorous.\nOr, coldly negligent, did need a spur,\nBethink thy self how slack I was at sea,\nHow since my landing I have won no towns,\nEntered no further but upon the coast,\nAnd there have ever since securely slept.\nBut if I have been other wise employed,\nImagine, Valois, whether I intend\nTo skirmish, not for pillage, but for the Crown\nWhich thou dost wear; and that I vow to have,\nOr one of us shall fall into his grave.\n\nPRINCE EDWARD.\nLook not for cross invectives at our hands,\nOr railing execrations of despite:\nLet creeping serpents, hid in hollow banks,\nSting with their tongues; we have remorseless swords,\nAnd they shall plead for us and our affairs.\nYet thus much, briefly, by my father's leave:\nAs all the immodest poison of thy throat\nIs scandalous and most notorious lies,\nAnd our pretended quarrel is truly just,\nSo end the battle when we meet to day:\nMay either of us prosper and prevail,\nOr, luckless, curst, receive eternal shame!\n\nKING EDWARD.\nThat needs no further question;

When we name a man,\nHis hand, his foot, his head hath several strengths;\nAnd being all but one self instant strength,\nWhy, all this many, Audley, is but one,\nAnd we can call it all but one man's strength.\nHe that hath far to go, tells it by miles;\nIf he should tell the steps, it kills his heart:\nThe drops are infinite, that make a flood,\nAnd yet, thou knowest, we call it but a Rain.\nThere is but one France, one king of France,\nThat France hath no more kings; and that same king\nHath but the puissant legion of one king,\nAnd we have one:  then apprehend no odds,\nFor one to one is fair equality.\n\n[Enter an Herald from King John.]\n\nPRINCE EDWARD.\nWhat tidings, messenger? be plain and brief.\n\nHERALD.\nThe king of France, my sovereign Lord and master,\nGreets by me his foe, the Prince of Wales:\nIf thou call forth a hundred men of name,\nOf Lords, Knights, Squires, and English gentlemen,\nAnd with thy self and those kneel at his feet,\nHe straight will fold his bloody colours up,\nAnd ransom shall redeem lives forfeited;\nIf not, this day shall drink more English blood,\nThan ere was buried in our British earth.\nWhat is the answer to his proffered mercy?\n\nPRINCE EDWARD.\nThis heaven, that covers France, contains the mercy\nThat draws from me submissive orizons;\nThat such base breath should vanish from my lips,\nTo urge the plea of mercy to a man,\nThe Lord forbid!  Return, and tell the king,\nMy tongue is made of steel, and it shall beg\nMy mercy on his coward burgonet;\nTell him, my colours are as red as his,\nMy men as bold, our English arms as strong:\nReturn him my defiance in his face.\n\nHERALD.\nI go.\n\n[Exit.]\n\n[Enter another Herald.]\n\nPRINCE EDWARD.\nWhat news with thee?\n\nHERALD.\nThe Duke of Normandy, my Lord & master,\nPitying thy youth is so ingirt with peril,\nBy me hath sent a nimble jointed jennet,\nAs swift as ever yet thou didst bestride,\nAnd therewithall he counsels thee to fly;\nElse death himself hath sworn that thou shalt die.\n\nPRINCE EDWARD.\nBack with the beast unto the beast that sent him!\nTell him I cannot sit a coward's horse;\nBid him to day bestride the jade himself,\nFor I will stain my horse quite o'er with blood,\nAnd double gild my spurs, but I will catch him;\nSo tell the carping boy, and get thee gone.\n\n[Exit Herald.]\n\n[Enter another Herald.]\n\nHERALD.\nEdward of Wales, Phillip, the second son\nTo the most mighty christian king of France,\nSeeing thy body's living date expired,\nAll full of charity and christian love,\nCommends this book, full fraught with prayers,\nTo thy fair hand and for thy hour of life\nIntreats thee that thou meditate therein,\nAnd arm thy soul for her long journey towards--\nThus have I done his bidding, and return.\n\nPRINCE EDWARD.\nHerald of Phillip, greet thy Lord from me:\nAll good that he can send, I can receive;\nBut thinkst thou not, the unadvised boy\nHath wronged himself in thus far tendering me?\nHappily he cannot pray without the book--\nI think him no divine extemporall--,\nThen render back this common place of prayer,\nTo do himself good in adversity;\nBeside he knows not my sins' quality,\nAnd therefore knows no prayers for my avail;\nEre night his prayer may be to pray to God,\nTo put it in my heart to hear his prayer.\nSo tell the courtly wanton, and be gone.\n\nHERALD.\nI go.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nPRINCE EDWARD.\nHow confident their strength and number makes them!--\nNow, Audley, sound those silver wings of thine,\nAnd let those milk white messengers of time\nShew thy times learning in this dangerous time.\nThy self art bruis'd and bit with many broils,\nAnd stratagems forepast with iron pens\nAre texted in thine honorable face;\nThou art a married man in this distress,\nBut danger woos me as a blushing maid:\nTeach me an answer to this perilous time.\n\nAUDLEY.\nTo die is all as common as to live:\nThe one ince-wise, the other holds in chase;\nFor, from the instant we begin to live,\nWe do pursue and hunt the time to die:\nFirst bud we, then we blow, and after seed,\nThen, presently, we fall; and, as a shade\nFollows the body, so we follow death.\nIf, then, we hunt for death, why do we fear it?\nIf we fear it, why do we follow it?\nIf we do fear, how can we shun it?\nIf we do fear, with fear we do but aide\nThe thing we fear to seize on us the sooner:\nIf we fear not, then no resolved proffer\nCan overthrow the limit of our fate;\nFor, whether ripe or rotten, drop we shall,\nAs we do draw the lottery of our doom.\n\nPRINCE EDWARD.\nAh, good old man, a thousand thousand armors\nThese words of thine have buckled on my back:\nAh, what an idiot hast thou made of life,\nTo seek the thing it fears! and how disgraced\nThe imperial victory of murdering death,\nSince all the lives his conquering arrows strike\nSeek him, and he not them, to shame his glory!\nI will not give a penny for a life,\nNor half a halfpenny to shun grim death,\nSince for to live is but to seek to die,\nAnd dying but beginning of new life.\nLet come the hour when he that rules it will!\nTo live or die I hold indifferent.\n\n[Exeunt.]\n\n\nACT IV.

after feel the stroke of quartering steel:\nThis is your doom;--go, soldiers, see it done.\n\nQUEEN PHILLIP.\nAh, be more mild unto these yielding men!\nIt is a glorious thing to stablish peace,\nAnd kings approach the nearest unto God\nBy giving life and safety unto men:\nAs thou intendest to be king of France,\nSo let her people live to call thee king;\nFor what the sword cuts down or fire hath spoiled,\nIs held in reputation none of ours.\n\nKING EDWARD.\nAlthough experience teach us this is true,\nThat peaceful quietness brings most delight,\nWhen most of all abuses are controlled;\nYet, insomuch it shall be known that we\nAs well can master our affections\nAs conquer other by the dint of sword,\nPhillip, prevail; we yield to thy request:\nThese men shall live to boast of clemency,\nAnd, tyranny, strike terror to thy self.\n\nSECOND CITIZEN.\nLong live your highness! happy be your reign!\n\nKING EDWARD.\nGo, get you hence, return unto the town,\nAnd if this kindness

so obstinate\nTo contradict our royal Queen's desire?\n\nCOPLAND.\nNo wilful disobedience, mighty Lord,\nBut my desert and public law at arms:\nI took the king my self in single fight,\nAnd, like a soldiers, would be loath to lose\nThe least pre-eminence that I had won.\nAnd Copland straight upon your highness' charge\nIs come to France, and with a lowly mind\nDoth vale the bonnet of his victory:\nReceive, dread Lord, the custom of my fraught,\nThe wealthy tribute of my laboring hands,\nWhich should long since have been surrendered up,\nHad but your gracious self been there in place.\n\nQUEEN PHILLIP.\nBut, Copland, thou didst scorn the king's command,\nNeglecting our commission in his name.\n\nCOPLAND.\nHis name I reverence, but his person more;\nHis name shall keep me in allegiance still,\nBut to his person I will bend my knee.\n\nKING EDWARD.\nI pray thee, Phillip, let displeasure pass;\nThis man doth please me, and I like his words:\nFor what is he that will attempt great deeds,\nAnd lose the glory that ensues the same?\nAll rivers have recourse unto the Sea,\nAnd Copland's faith relation to his king.\nKneel, therefore, down:  now rise, king Edward's knight;\nAnd, to maintain thy state, I freely give\nFive hundred marks a year to thee and thine.\n\n[Enter Salisbury.]\n\n\nWelcome, Lord Salisbury:  what news from Brittain?\n\nSALISBURY.\nThis, mighty king:  the Country we have won,\nAnd John de Mountford, regent of that place,\nPresents your highness with this Coronet,\nProtesting true allegiance to your Grace.\n\nKING EDWARD.\nWe thank thee for thy service, valiant Earl;\nChallenge our favour, for we owe it thee.\n\nSALISBURY.\nBut now, my Lord, as this is joyful news,\nSo must my voice be tragical again,\nAnd I must sing of doleful accidents.\n\nKING EDWARD.\nWhat, have our men the overthrow at Poitiers?\nOr is our son beset with too much odds?\n\nSALISBURY.\nHe was, my Lord:  and as my worthless self\nWith forty other serviceable knights,\nUnder safe conduct of the Dauphin's seal,\nDid travail that way, finding him distressed,\nA troop of Lances met us on the way,\nSurprised, and brought us prisoners to the king,\nWho, proud of this, and eager of revenge,\nCommanded straight to cut off all our heads:\nAnd surely we had died, but that the Duke,\nMore full of honor than his angry sire,\nProcured our quick deliverance from thence;\nBut, ere we went, 'Salute your king', quoth he,\n'Bid him provide a funeral for his son:\nTo day our sword shall cut his thread of life;\nAnd, sooner than he thinks, we'll be with him,\nTo quittance those displeasures he hath done.'\nThis said, we past, not daring to reply;\nOur hearts were dead, our looks diffused and wan.\nWandering, at last we climed unto a hill,\n>From whence, although our grief were much before,\nYet now to see the occasion with our eyes\nDid thrice so much increase our heaviness:\nFor there, my Lord, oh, there we did descry\nDown in a valley how both armies lay.\nThe French had cast their trenches like a ring,\nAnd every Barricado's open front\nWas thick embossed with brazen ordinance;\nHere stood a battaile of ten thousand horse,\nThere twice as many pikes in quadrant wise,\nHere Crossbows, and deadly wounding darts:\nAnd in the midst, like to a slender point\nWithin the compass of the horizon,\nAs twere a rising bubble in the sea,\nA Hasle wand amidst a wood of Pines,\nOr as a bear fast chained unto a stake,\nStood famous Edward, still expecting when\nThose dogs of France would fasten on his flesh.\nAnon the death procuring knell begins:\nOff go the Cannons, that with trembling noise\nDid shake the very Mountain where they stood;\nThen sound the Trumpets' clangor in the air,\nThe battles join:  and, when we could no more\nDiscern the difference twixt the friend and foe,\nSo intricate the dark confusion was,\nAway we turned our watery eyes with sighs,\nAs black as powder fuming into smoke.\nAnd thus, I fear, unhappy have I told\nThe most untimely tale of Edward's fall.\n\nQUEEN PHILLIP.\nAh me, is this my welcome into France?\nIs this the comfort that I looked to have,\nWhen I should meet with my beloved son?\nSweet Ned, I would thy mother in the sea\nHad been prevented of this mortal grief!\n\nKING EDWARD.\nContent thee, Phillip; tis not tears will serve\nTo call him back, if he be taken hence:\nComfort thy self, as I do, gentle Queen,\nWith hope of sharp, unheard of, dire revenge.--\nHe bids me to provide his funeral,\nAnd so I will; but all the Peers in France\nShall mourners be, and weep out bloody tears,\nUntil their empty veins be dry and sere:\nThe pillars of his hearse shall be his bones;\nThe mould that covers him, their City ashes;\nHis knell, the groaning cries of dying men;\nAnd, in the stead of tapers on his tomb,\nAn hundred fifty towers shall burning blaze,\nWhile we bewail our valiant son's decease.\n\n[After a flourish, sounded within, enter an herald.]\n\nHERALD.\nRejoice, my Lord; ascend the imperial throne!\nThe mighty and redoubted prince of Wales,\nGreat servitor to bloody Mars in arms,\nThe French man's terror, and his country's fame,\nTriumphant rideth like a Roman peer,\nAnd, lowly at his stirrup, comes afoot\nKing John of France, together with his son,\nIn captive bonds; whose diadem he brings\nTo crown thee with, and to proclaim thee king.\n\nKING EDWARD.\nAway with mourning, Phillip, wipe thine eyes;--\nSound, Trumpets, welcome in Plantagenet!\n\n[Enter Prince Edward, king John, Phillip, Audley, Artois.]\n\nAs things long lost, when they are found again,\nSo doth my son rejoice his father's heart,\nFor whom even now my soul was much perplexed.\n\nQUEEN PHILLIP.\nBe this a token to express my joy,\n\n[Kisses him.]\n\nFor inward passion will not let me speak.\n\nPRINCE EDWARD.\nMy gracious father, here receive the gift.\n\n[Presenting him with King John's crown.]\n\nThis wreath of conquest and reward of war,\nGot with as mickle peril of our lives,\nAs ere was thing of price before this day;\nInstall your highness in your proper right:\nAnd, herewithall, I render to your hands\nThese prisoners, chief occasion of our strife.\n\nKING EDWARD.\nSo, John of France, I see you keep your word:\nYou promised to be sooner with our self\nThan we did think for, and tis so in deed:\nBut, had you done at first as now you do,\nHow many civil towns had stood untouched,\nThat now are turned to ragged heaps of stones!\nHow many people's lives mightst thou have saved,\nThat are untimely sunk into their graves!\n\nKING JOHN.\nEdward, recount not things irrevocable;\nTell me what ransom thou requirest to have.\n\nKING EDWARD.\nThy ransom, John, hereafter shall be known:\nBut first to England thou must cross the seas,\nTo see what entertainment it affords;\nHow ere it falls, it cannot be so bad,\nAs ours hath been since we arrived in France.\n\nKING JOHN.\nAccursed man! of this I was foretold,\nBut did misconster what the prophet told.\n\nPRINCE EDWARD.\nNow, father, this petition Edward makes\nTo thee, whose grace hath been his strongest shield,\nThat, as thy pleasure chose me for the man\nTo be the instrument to shew thy power,\nSo thou wilt grant that many princes more,\nBred and brought up within that little Isle,\nMay still be famous for like victories!\nAnd, for my part, the bloody scars I bear,\nAnd weary nights that I have watched in field,\nThe dangerous conflicts I have often had,\nThe fearful menaces were proffered me,\nThe heat and cold and what else might displease:\nI wish were now redoubled twenty fold,\nSo that hereafter ages, when they read\nThe painful traffic of my tender youth,\nMight thereby be inflamed with such resolve,\nAs not the territories of France alone,\nBut likewise Spain, Turkey, and what countries else\nThat justly would provoke fair England's ire,\nMight, at their presence, tremble and retire.\n\nKING EDWARD.\nHere, English Lords, we do proclaim a rest,\nAn intercession of our painful arms:\nSheath up your swords, refresh your weary limbs,\nPeruse your spoils; and, after we have breathed\nA day or two within this haven town,\nGod willing, then for England we'll be shipped;\nWhere, in a happy hour, I trust, we shall\nArrive, three kings, two princes, and a queen.\n\nFINIS.\n\n\n\n\n\nEND OF PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF
