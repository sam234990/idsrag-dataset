{"ori_id":"7aa7b07e8f87871690bf6f194d17adb9c6384ad4","title":"The Prince of Parthia","context":"The Prince of Parthia\n The Prince of Parthia is written to be a Neo-Classical tragedy. It mostly follows the unities of time (happens in a short amount of time, usually 24 hours), place (happens in one place) and plot (one or few plot lines). It also has a five-act structure, and most of the characters follow decorum. However, with verisimilitude (or, the appearance of truth), the play is lacking. The idea that the entire plot line could happen within 24 to 48 hours is astonishing.\nIn the first act, Phraates, an officer at court, and Gotarzes, a prince, discuss Prince Arsaces\u2019 triumphal return from foreign wars. But, there is trouble at home. Vardanes, Arsaces\u2019 brother, is jealous of his marital successes, and Thermusa, Arsaces\u2019 stepmother and the Queen of Parthia wants to avenge her son Vonones who was killed by Arsaces for treason. Vardanes and his officer, Lysias, decide to use Thermusa\u2019s vengeance to destroy Arsaces. Meanwhile, Evanthe, whose dad, King Bethas, has been imprisoned, is in love with Arsaces. But Artabanus, the King of Parthia, has illicit feelings for Evanthe. The plot then moves into Act Two; when Vardanes and Lysias hear Arsaces tell Bethas that he loves Evanthe, they decide to tell King Artabanus that Arsaces is a traitor for sympathizing with Parthian enemies. And that is all; like most plays with a five-act structure, there are usually one or two acts that are just one scene. This keeps the five-act structure, but does not mess with the believability of the plot.\nBy the time the plot reaches Act Three, Thermusa is very angry because she knows King Artabanus is lusting after someone else. She tells this to Vardanes, who decides to use this to destroy Arsaces and take the throne of Parthia for himself. Arsaces asks for Evanthe\u2019s hand in marriage in front of King Artabanus. Artabanus decides to let Arsaces have Evanthe because he promised Arsaces anything he wanted for being such an awesome child. Evanthe tells Arsaces that King Artabanus loves her, to which he replies that he loves her more. Vardanes then tells King Artabanus that Arsaces is a traitor.\nAct Four takes a sharp plot turn, which causes some incongruities. Phraates tells Gotarzes that he overheard Vardanes and Lysias talking about how they killed King Artabanus in his sleep. Vardanes and Lysias plan on blaming Arsaces, while Phraates and Gotarzes plan on telling the general Barzaphernes about who actually killed the king. Arsaces has been accused of the regicide and thrown in prison along with Bethas. They bond over their fear for Evanthe\u2019s safety. Thermusa enters the prison to kill Arsaces, but she sees a bloody ghost of King Artabanus, which causes her to \u201cbrain\u201d herself against the wall, committing suicide. Barzaphernes appears and releases Arsaces. Together, they plan to get Vardanes and make Parthia right once more.\nIn the exciting conclusion of Act Five, Vardanes comes on to Evanthe, but she does not like it. Before Vardanes can hurt Evanthe, Lysias runs in and tells Vardanes that Arsaces has escaped and knows of Vardanes\u2019 plot. Then, a huge battle occurs, pitting Vardanes, Lysias and all of their followers against Arsaces, Barzaphernes, Phraates, Gotarzes and their men. Cleone, Evanthe\u2019s maid, watches the battle from a window. Cleone believes Arsaces was killed in the battle by Vardanes, but it was really Phraates. Cleone tells this to Evanthe, who drinks a vial of poison. When Arsaces, who has taken down Vardanes, hears of Evanthe\u2019s death, he impales himself on Barzaphernes\u2019 sword. In the end, only Barzaphernes and Gotarzes live.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Prince of Parthia, by Thomas Godfrey\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

(1736-1763)\n\n\nThomas Godfrey, Jr., was born in Philadelphia, on December 4, 1736,\nthe son of a man who himself won fame as an inventor of the Quadrant.\nGodfrey, Senior, was a friend of Benjamin Franklin, the two probably\nhaving been drawn together by their common interest in science. When\nGodfrey, Senior, died, December, 1749, it was Franklin who wrote his\nobituary notice.[1]\n\nYoung Godfrey was a student at the College or Academy of Philadelphia,\nand when his education was completed, he became apprenticed to a\nwatch-maker, remaining in that profession until 1758. As a student at\nthe Academy, he came under the special influence of Dr. William Smith,\nthe first Principal or Provost of that institution,[2] and it was Dr.\nSmith who not only obtained for Godfrey a lieutenancy with the\nPennsylvania troops in 1758, which sent him in the expedition against\nFort Duquesne, but who, likewise, as the Editor of _The American\nMagazine_, was only too glad to accept and publish some of Godfrey's\npoetical effusions.\n\nThat the young man was popular, and that he associated with some of\nthe most promising figures of the time, will be seen from the fact\nthat, although he was only twenty-seven when he died, he was counted\namong the friends of Benjamin West and John Green, both portrait\npainters, of Francis Hopkinson, who was a student at the College of\nPhiladelphia, and of Nathaniel Evans, a young minister whose loyalty\nfound outlet after Godfrey's death in the Memorial Edition of\nGodfrey's works. Evans himself wrote poems and dialogues. In his\nconfirmation of the fact that, as a poet, Godfrey was regarded\nfavourably by the Philadelphians of the time, he quotes from the diary\nof one Miss Sarah Eve, who referred to him as \"our poet.\"\n\nGodfrey's reputation, as a young man with musical talents and a\ndecided taste for painting, has come down to us. Certain it is that,\nduring all of this time of varied occupation as a watch-maker and a\nsoldier, he must have been courting the poetic Muse. There are some\nwho speculate, without authority, on his having been a theatre-goer,\nand having become inspired as a playwright by the work of the American\nCompany, in Philadelphia; especially by the good work of Douglass.\nBecause of insufficient evidence, that is a question which remains\nunproven. Nevertheless, it is certain, from an extant letter written\nby Godfrey on November 17, 1759, and quoted by Seilhamer, that he must\nhave had his attention turned to playwriting as a special art. He says\nto his correspondent, writing from North Carolina:\n\n    By the last vessel from this place, I sent you the copy of a\n    tragedy I finished here, and desired your interest in bringing\n    it on the stage; I have not yet heard of the vessel's safe\n    arrival, and believe if she is safe it will be too late for the\n    company now in Philadelphia. [Meaning, of course, Douglass's\n    company.]\n\nThere are two facts to be noted in this communication: first, that it\nwas written from North Carolina, where, in 1759, Godfrey had gone on\nsome plantation business--probably as factor; and second, that it must\nhave been penned with the idea of immediate production by the actors\nin Philadelphia. According to Seilhamer, Godfrey remained in North\nCarolina for three years. He did not write the entire manuscript of\n\"The Prince of Parthia\" while living in the South but, as he\ndefinitely states in his letter, finished it soon after his arrival.\n\nThere is no evidence as to why Godfrey sailed to the Island of New\nProvidence in the last year of his life, and then returned to\nWilmington, N.C. There is no definite statement as to whether he\ncontracted fever and had a sunstroke on that expedition, or after his\nreturn home. But, nevertheless, he did contract the fever and have a\nsunstroke; with the result that he succumbed to his illness, and died\nnear Wilmington, North Carolina, on August 3, 1763.[3]\n\nAfter his death, Godfrey's friends decided among themselves that the\nyoung man was too much of a genius for them to allow his productions\nto remain scattered and unrecognized. Evidently, correspondence\nregarding this must have taken place between Dr. Smith, Nathaniel\nEvans, the young minister, and John Green, the portrait painter. For,\nin 1765, a book was published, entitled \"Juvenile Poems on Various\nSubjects, with the Prince of Parthia,\" printed in Philadelphia by one\nHenry Miller.[4] The volume contained a life written by Evans, a\ncritical estimate written by Dr. Smith, of the College of\nPhiladelphia, and an Elegy from the pen of John Green, who had been\npreviously complimented by Godfrey in a poem entitled \"A Night Piece.\"\nThe whole spirit of the publication was one of friendly devotion and\nof firm belief in the permanency of Godfrey's position in the literary\nworld. As was the custom of the time, the Edition was issued under the\npatronage of subscribers, a list being included. We know, for example,\nthat Benjamin Franklin subscribed for twelve copies, his own private,\nautographed copy having been put on sale a few years ago.\n\nAs yet, no concerted effort had been made for the production of\nGodfrey's \"The Prince of Parthia.\" We do not know if, during this\ntime, the American Company had any claim on the manuscript, or\nwhether, after Godfrey's death, it was again submitted to the\ntheatrical people. But this much we do know, that, very hastily, the\nAmerican Company, headed by David Douglass, who was playing at the\nSouthwark Theatre in Philadelphia, decided that they would put on \"The\nPrince of Parthia\" in place of \"The Disappointment; or, the Force of\nCredulity,\" a comic opera which will be noted in my introduction to\nJohn Leacock's \"The Fall of British Tyranny.\" This musical piece had\nactually been put into rehearsal in 1767, when it was withdrawn.\nImmediately, the _Pennsylvania Journal and Weekly Advertiser_ for\nApril 23, 1767, contained an advertisement of the forthcoming\nproduction; it ran as follows:\n\n    By Authority.\/Never Performed before.\/By the American\n    Company,\/at the New Theatre, in Southwark,\/On Friday, the\n    Twenty-fourth of April, will be\/presented, A Tragedy written by\n    the late ingenious\/Mr. _Thomas Godfrey_, of this city, called\n    the\/Prince of Parthia.\/The Principal Characters by Mr.\n    Hallam,\/Mr. Douglass, Mr. Wall, Mr. Morris,\/Mr. Allyn, Mr.\n    Tomlinson, Mr. Broad\/belt, Mr. Greville, Mrs. Douglass,\/Mrs.\n    Morris, Miss Wainwight, and\/Miss Cheer.\/To which will be added,\n    A Ballad Opera called\/The Contrivances.\/To begin exactly at\n    _Seven o'clock_.--_Vivant Rex & Regina._\/\n\nIn the _Pennsylvania Gazette_, for the same date, appears an\nadvertisement, without the cast of characters.\n\nThe production occurred on April 24, 1767.\n\nSeilhamer gives a probable cast of characters, although only the list\nof actors is given in the advertisement. Apart from this, little is\nknown of the production: whether or not it pleased the theatre-goers\nof the time. We can judge, however, from the reading of the play\nitself, that there was little of extreme dramatic excellence in the\nsituations, the chief claim, from the actor's point of view, being the\nopportunity to deliver certain very highly coloured, poetical lines\nmodelled after the manner of the Elizabethan drama.\n\nIn the publication of \"The Prince of Parthia,\" we have the first\nprinted American tragedy in existence, and in its production we have\none of only two plays, written by Americans, and presented on the\nstage before the Revolution. The other play is George Cockings's \"The\nConquest of Canada; or, The Siege of Quebec,\" printed for the author\nin 1766, and presented in Philadelphia in 1773. We note, in Dr. F. W.\nAtkinson's estimable Bibliography of American Plays in his possession,\nthat Cockings later described himself as \"Camillo Querno, Poet\nLaureate to Congress.\"\n\nThe interest in the early history of the American drama, which has\nbecome evident within recent years, and nowhere more evident than\namong the student body in our American colleges, induced the\nZelosophic Literary Society, encouraged by the University of\nPennsylvania, to revive \"The Prince of Parthia,\" which was written by\none of their alumni. The production was consummated on March 26, 1915.\nEven though we have no statement as to the actual manner in which the\nDouglass Company presented the play originally, we are given every\nevidence, by those who witnessed the revival, that the play, while\ncontaining many excellences, was not of a dramatic character according\nto modern ideas of stage effectiveness.\n\nThe only portrait of Godfrey known to have been in existence was that\npainted by Benjamin West, in his earlier years. It is interesting to\nnote that in commemoration of the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary\nof the original production of this play, Dr. Archibald Henderson, of\nthe University of North Carolina, issued an _\u00c3\u00a9dition de luxe_ of \"The\nPrince of Parthia,\" with an extended introduction, historical,\nbiographical and critical (Boston: Little, Brown & Co., 1917).\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[1] A notice appeared in the Pennsylvania _Gazette_, December 19,\n1749. See Scharf and Westcott's \"History of Philadelphia\" for\nreferences to Godfrey, Sr. Therein is given a picture of his house in\nGermantown, Pa. Barlow mentions him in his \"Columbiad.\" A monument to\nhis memory was erected in Laurel Hill Cemetery, Philadelphia, 1843.\nNote that David Rittenhouse, an American dramatist who translated,\nfrom the German, \"Lucy Sampson; or, The Unhappy Heiress\" (1789), was\nlikewise a mathematical genius.\n\n[2] Accounts of Dr. Smith are to be found in Henry Simpson's \"Eminent\nPhiladelphians\"; Scharf & Westcott's \"History of Philadelphia,\" ii,\n1126.

'tis a glorious day:--let none presume\nT'indulge the tear, or wear the gloom of sorrow;\nThis day shall shine in Ages yet to come,\nAnd grace the Parthian story.\n\nPHRAATES.\n\n                              Glad Ctes'phon\nPours forth her numbers, like a rolling deluge,\nTo meet the blooming Hero; all the ways,\nOn either side, as far as sight can stretch,\nAre lin'd with crouds, and on the lofty walls\nInnumerable multitudes are rang'd.\nOn ev'ry countenance impatience sate\nWith roving eye, before the train appear'd.\nBut when they saw the Darling of the Fates,\nThey rent the air with loud repeated shouts;\nThe Mother shew'd him to her infant Son,\nAnd taught his lisping tongue to name Arsaces:\nE'en aged Sires, whose sounds are scarcely heard,\nBy feeble strength supported, tost their caps,\nAnd gave their murmur to the gen'ral voice.\n\nGOTARZES.\n\nThe spacious streets, which lead up to the Temple,\nAre strew'd with flow'rs; each, with frantic joy,\nHis garland forms, and throws it in the way.\nWhat pleasure, Phraates, must swell his bosom,\nTo see the prostrate nation all around him,\nAnd know he's made them happy! to hear them\nTease the Gods, to show'r their blessings on him!\nHappy Arsaces! fain I'd imitate\nThy matchless worth, and be a shining joy!\n\nPHRAATES.\n\nHark! what a shout was that which pierc'd the skies!\nIt seem'd as tho' all Nature's beings join'd,\nTo hail thy glorious Brother.\n\nGOTARZES.\n\n                              Happy Parthia!\nNow proud Arabia dreads her destin'd chains,\nWhile shame and rout disperses all her sons.\nBarzaphernes pursues the fugitives,\nThe few whom fav'ring Night redeem'd from slaughter;\nSwiftly they fled, for fear had wing'd their speed,\nAnd made them bless the shade which saf'ty gave.\n\nPHRAATES.\n\nWhat a bright hope is ours, when those dread pow'rs\nWho rule yon heav'n, and guide the mov'ments here,\nShall call your royal Father to their joys:\nIn blest Arsaces ev'ry virtue meets;\nHe's gen'rous, brave, and wise, and good,\nHas skill to act, and noble fortitude\nTo face bold danger, in the battle firm,\nAnd dauntless as a Lion fronts his foe.\nYet is he sway'd by ev'ry tender passion,\nForgiving mercy, gentleness and love;\nWhich speak the Hero friend of humankind.\n\nGOTARZES.\n\nAnd let me speak, for 'tis to him I owe\nThat here I stand, and breath the common air,\nAnd 'tis my pride to tell it to the world.\nOne luckless day as in the eager chace\nMy Courser wildly bore me from the rest,\nA monst'rous Leopard from a bosky fen\nRush'd forth, and foaming lash'd the ground,\nAnd fiercely ey'd me as his destin'd quarry.\nMy jav'lin swift I threw, but o'er his head\nIt erring pass'd, and harmless in the air\nSpent all its force; my falchin then I seiz'd,\nAdvancing to attack my ireful foe,\nWhen furiously the savage sprung upon me,\nAnd tore me to the ground; my treach'rous blade\nAbove my hand snap'd short, and left me quite\nDefenceless to his rage; Arsaces then,\nHearing the din, flew like some pitying pow'r,\nAnd quickly freed me from the Monster's paws,\nDrenching his bright lance in his spotted breast.\n\nPHRAATES.\n\nHow diff'rent he from arrogant Vardanes?\nThat haughty Prince eyes with a stern contempt\nAll other Mortals, and with lofty mien\nHe treads the earth as tho' he were a God.\nNay, I believe that his ambitious soul,\nHad it but pow'r to its licentious wishes,\nWould dare dispute with Jove the rule of heav'n;\nLike a Titanian son with giant insolence,\nMatch with the Gods, and wage immortal war,\n'Til their red wrath should hurl him headlong down,\nE'en to destruction's lowest pit of horror.\n\nGOTARZES.\n\nMethinks he wears not that becoming joy\nWhich on this bright occasion gilds the court;\nHis brow's contracted with a gloomy frown,\nPensive he stalks along, and seems a prey\nTo pining discontent.\n\nPHRAATES.\n\n                           Arsaces he dislikes,\nFor standing 'twixt him, and the hope of Empire;\nWhile Envy, like a rav'nous Vulture, tears\nHis canker'd heart, to see your Brother's triumph.\n\nGOTARZES.\n\nAnd yet Vardanes owes that hated Brother\nAs much as I; 'twas summer last, as we\nWere bathing in Euphrates' flood, Vardanes\nProud of strength would seek the further shore;\nBut ere he the mid-stream gain'd, a poignant pain\nShot thro' his well-strung nerves, contracting all,\nAnd the stiff joints refus'd their wonted aid.\nLoudly he cry'd for help, Arsaces heard,\nAnd thro' the swelling waves he rush'd to save\nHis drowning Brother, and gave him life,\nAnd for the boon the Ingrate pays him hate.\n\nPHRAATES.\n\nThere's something in the wind, for I've observ'd\nOf late he much frequents the Queen's apartment,\nAnd fain would court her favour, wild is she\nTo gain revenge for fell Vonones' death,\nAnd firm resolves the ruin of Arsaces.\nBecause that fill'd with filial piety,\nTo save his Royal Sire, he struck the bold\nPresumptuous Traitor dead; nor heeds she\nThe hand which gave her Liberty, nay rais'd her\nAgain to Royalty.\n\nGOTARZES.\n\n                              Ingratitude,\nThou hell-born fiend, how horrid is thy form!\nThe Gods sure let thee loose to scourge mankind,\nAnd save them from an endless waste of thunder.\n\nPHRAATES.\n\nYet I've beheld this now so haughty Queen,\nBent with distress, and e'en by pride forsook,\nWhen following thy Sire's triumphant car,\nHer tears and ravings mov'd the senseless herd,\nAnd pity blest their more than savage breasts,\nWith the short pleasure of a moment's softness.\nThy Father, conquer'd by her charms (for what\nCan charm like mourning beauty), soon struck off\nHer chains, and rais'd her to his bed and throne.\nAdorn'd the brows of her aspiring Son,\nThe fierce Vonones, with the regal crown\nOf rich Armenia, once the happy rule\nOf Tisaphernes, her deceased Lord.\n\nGOTARZES.\n\nAnd he in wasteful war return'd his thanks,\nRefus'd the homage he had sworn to pay,\nAnd spread Destruction ev'ry where around,\n'Til from Arsaces' hand he met the fate\nHis crimes deserv'd.\n\nPHRAATES.\n\n                      As yet your princely Brother\nHas scap'd Thermusa's rage, for still residing\nIn peaceful times, within his Province, ne'er\nHas fortune blest her with a sight of him,\nOn whom she'd wreck her vengeance.\n\nGOTARZES.\n\n                              She has won\nBy spells, I think, so much on my fond father,\nThat he is guided by her will alone.\nShe rules the realm, her pleasure is a law,\nAll offices and favours are bestow'd,\nAs she directs.\n\nPHRAATES.\n\n                  But see, the Prince, Vardanes,\nProud Lysias with him, he whose soul is harsh\nWith jarring discord. Nought but madding rage,\nAnd ruffian-like revenge his breast can know,\nIndeed to gain a point he'll condescend\nTo mask the native rancour of his heart,\nAnd smooth his venom'd tongue with flattery.\nAssiduous now he courts Vardanes' friendship,\nSee, how he seems to answer all his gloom,\nAnd give him frown for frown.\n\nGOTARZES.\n\n                          Let us retire,\nAnd shun them now; I know not what it means,\nBut chilling horror shivers o'er my limbs,\nWhen Lysias I behold.--\n\n\nSCENE II. _VARDANES and LYSIAS._\n\nLYSIAS.\n\n                            That shout proclaims              [_Shout._\nArsaces' near approach.\n\nVARDANES.\n\n                            Peace, prithee, peace,\nWilt thou still shock me with that hated sound,\nAnd grate harsh discord in my offended ear?\nIf thou art fond of echoing the name,\nJoin with the servile croud, and hail his triumph.\n\nLYSIAS.\n\nI hail him? By our glorious shining God,\nI'd sooner lose my speech, and all my days\nIn silence rest, conversing with my thoughts,\nThan hail Arsaces.\n\nVARDANES.\n\n                    Yet, again his name,\nSure there is magic in it, Parthia's drunk\nAnd giddy with the joy; the houses' tops\nWith gaping spectators are throng'd, nay wild\nThey climb such precipices that the eye\nIs dazzl'd with their daring; ev'ry wretch\nWho long has been immur'd, nor dar'd enjoy\nThe common benefits of sun and air,\nCreeps from his lurking place; e'en feeble age,\nLong to the sickly couch confin'd, stalks forth,\nAnd with infectious breath assails the Gods.\nO! curse the name, the idol of their joy.\n\nLYSIAS.\n\nAnd what's that name, that thus they should disturb\nThe ambient air, and weary gracious heav'n\nWith ceaseless bellowings? Vardanes sounds\nWith equal harmony, and suits as well\nThe loud repeated shouts of noisy joy.\nCan he bid Chaos Nature's rule dissolve,\nCan he deprive mankind of light and day,\nAnd turn the Seasons from their destin'd course?\nSay, can he do all this, and be a God?\nIf not, what is his matchless merit? What dares he,\nVardanes dares not? blush not, noble Prince,\nFor praise is merit's due, and I will give it;\nE'en 'mid the croud which waits thy Brother's smile,\nI'd loud proclaim the merit of Vardanes.\n\nVARDANES.\n\nForbear this warmth, your friendship urges far.\nYet know your love shall e'er retain a place\nIn my remembrance. There is something here--\n\n                                             [_Pointing to his breast._\n\nAnother time and I will give thee all;\nBut now, no more.--\n\nLYSIAS.\n\n                            You may command my services,\nI'm happy to obey. Of late your Brother\nDelights in hind'ring my advancement,\nAnd ev'ry boaster's rais'd above my merit,\nBarzaphernes alone commands his ear,\nHis oracle in all.\n\nVARDANES.\n\n                            I hate Arsaces,\nTho' he's my Mother's son, and churchmen say\nThere's something sacred in the name of Brother.\nMy soul endures him not, and he's the bane\nOf all my hopes of greatness. Like the sun\nHe rules the day, and like the night's pale Queen,\nMy fainter beams are lost when he appears.\nAnd this because he came into the world,\nA moon or two before me: What's the diff'rence,\nThat he alone should shine in Empire's seat?\nI am not apt to trumpet forth my praise,\nOr highly name myself, but this I'll speak,\nTo him in ought, I'm not the least inferior.\nAmbition, glorious fever! mark of Kings,\nGave me immortal thirst and rule of Empire.\nWhy lag'd my tardy soul, why droop'd the wing,\nNor forward springing, shot before his speed\nTo seize the prize?--'Twas Empire--Oh! 'twas Empire--\n\nLYSIAS.\n\nYet, I must think that of superior mould\nYour soul was form'd, fit for a heav'nly state,\nAnd left reluctant its sublime abode,\nAnd painfully obey'd the dread command,\nWhen Jove's controuling fate forc'd it below.\nHis soul was earthly, and it downward mov'd,\nSwift as to the center of attraction.\n\nVARDANES.\n\nIt might be so--But I've another cause\nTo hate this Brother, ev'ry way my rival;\nIn love as well as glory he's above me;\nI dote on fair Evanthe, but the charmer\nDisdains my ardent suit, like a miser\nHe treasures up her beauties to himself:\nThus is he form'd to give me torture ever.--\nBut hark, they've reach'd the Temple,\nDidst thou observe the croud, their eagerness,\nEach put the next aside to catch a look,\nHimself was elbow'd out?--Curse, curse their zeal--\n\nLYSIAS.\n\nStupid folly!\n\nVARDANES.\n\n                     I'll tell thee, Lysias,\nThis many-headed monster multitude,\nUnsteady is as giddy fortune's wheel,\nAs woman fickle, varying as the wind;\nTo-day they this way course, the next they veer,\nAnd shift another point, the next another.\n\nLYSIAS.\n\nCuriosity's another name for man,\nThe blazing meteor streaming thro' the air\nCommands our wonder, and admiring eyes,\nWith eager gaze we trace the lucent path,\n'Til spent at length it shrinks to native nothing.\nWhile the bright stars which ever steady glow,\nUnheeded shine, and bless the world below.\n\n\nSCENE III. _QUEEN and EDESSA._\n\nQUEEN.\n\nOh! give me way, the haughty victor comes,\nSurrounded by adoring multitudes;\nOn swelling tides of praise to heav'n they raise him;\nTo deck their idol, they rob the glorious beings\nOf their splendour.\n\nEDESSA.\n\n                    My royal Lady,\nChace hence these passions.\n\nQUEEN.\n\n                                Peace, forever peace,\nHave I not cause to hate this homicide?\n'Twas by his cursed hand Vonones fell,\nYet fell not as became his gallant spirit,\nNot by the warlike arm of chief renown'd,\nBut by a youth, ye Gods, a beardless stripling,\nStab'd by his dastard falchin from behind;\nFor well I know he fear'd to meet Vonones,\nAs princely warriors meet with open daring,\nBut shrunk amidst his guards, and gave him death,\nWhen faint with wounds, and weary with the fight.\n\nEDESSA.\n\nWith anguish I have heard his hapless fate,\nAnd mourn'd in silence for the gallant Prince.\n\nQUEEN.\n\nSoft is thy nature, but, alas!

Say, Cleone,\nFor you beheld the triumph, 'midst his pomp,\nDid he not seem to curse the empty show,\nThe pageant greatness, enemy to love,\nWhich held him from Evanthe? haste, to tell me,\nAnd feed my gready ear with the fond tale--\nYet, hold--for I shall weary you with questions,\nAnd ne'er be satisfied--Beware, Cleone,\nAnd guard your heart from Love's delusive sweets.\n\nCLEONE.\n\nIs Love an ill, that thus you caution me\nTo shun his pow'r?\n\nEVANTHE.\n\n                    The Tyrant, my Cleone,\nDespotic rules, and fetters all our thoughts.\nOh! wouldst thou love, then bid adieu to peace,\nThen fears will come, and jealousies intrude,\nRavage your bosom, and disturb your quiet,\nE'en pleasure to excess will be a pain.\nOnce I was free, then my exulting heart\nWas like a bird that hops from spray to spray,\nAnd all was innocence and mirth; but, lo!\nThe Fowler came, and by his arts decoy'd,\nAnd soon the Wanton cag'd. Twice fifteen times\nHas Cynthia dipt her horns in beams of light,\nTwice fifteen times has wasted all her brightness,\nSince first I knew to love; 'twas on that day\nWhen curs'd Vonones fell upon the plain,\nThe lovely Victor doubly conquer'd me.\n\nCLEONE.\n\nForgive my boldness, Madam, if I ask\nWhat chance first gave you to Vonones' pow'r?\nCuriosity thou know'st is of our sex.\n\nEVANTHE.\n\nThat is a task will wake me to new sorrows,\nYet thou attend, and I will tell thee all.\nArabia gave me birth, my father held\nGreat Offices at Court, and was reputed\nBrave, wise and loyal, by his Prince belov'd.\nOft has he led his conqu'ring troops, and forc'd\nFrom frowning victory her awful honours.\nIn infancy I was his only treasure,\nOn me he wasted all his store of fondness.\nOh! I could tell thee of his wond'rous goodness,\nHis more than father's love and tenderness.\nBut thou wouldst jeer, and say the tale was trifling;\nSo did he dote upon me, for in childhood\nMy infant charms, and artless innocence\nBlest his fond age, and won on ev'ry heart.\nBut, oh! from this sprung ev'ry future ill,\nThis fatal beauty was the source of all.\n\nCLEONE.\n\n'Tis often so, for beauty is a flow'r\nThat tempts the hand to pluck it.\n\nEVANTHE.\n\n                                 Full three times\nHas scorching summer fled from cold winter's\nRuthless blasts, as oft again has spring\nIn sprightly youth drest nature in her beauties,\nSince bathing in Niphates'[5] silver stream,\nAttended only by one fav'rite maid;\nAs we were sporting on the wanton waves,\nSwift from the wood a troop of horsemen rush'd,\nRudely they seiz'd, and bore me trembling off,\nIn vain Edessa with her shrieks assail'd\nThe heav'ns, for heav'n was deaf to both our pray'rs.\nThe wretch whose insolent embrace confin'd me\n(Like thunder bursting on the guilty soul),\nWith curs'd Vonones' voice pour'd in my ears\nA hateful tale of love; for he it seems\nHad seen me at Arabia's royal court,\nAnd took those means to force me to his arms.\n\nCLEONE.\n\nPerhaps you may gain something from the Captives\nOf your lost Parents.\n\nEVANTHE.\n\n                     This I meant to try,\nSoon as the night hides Nature in her darkness,\nVeil'd in the gloom we'll steal into their prison.\nBut, oh! perhaps e'en now my aged Sire\nMay 'mongst the slain lie welt'ring on the field,\nPierc'd like a riddle through with num'rous wounds,\nWhile parting life is quiv'ring on his lips,\nHe may perhaps be calling on his Evanthe.\nYes, ye great Pow'rs who boast the name of mercy,\nYe have deny'd me to his latest moments,\nTo all the offices of filial duty,\nTo bind his wounds, and wash them with my tears,\nIs this, is this your mercy?\n\nCLEONE.\n\n                            Blame not heav'n,\nFor heav'n is just and kind; dear Lady, drive\nThese black ideas from your gentle breast;\nFancy delights to torture the distress'd,\nAnd fill the gloomy scene with shadowy ills,\nSummon your reason, and you'll soon have comfort.\n\nEVANTHE.\n\nDost thou name comfort to me, my Cleone,\nThou who know'st all my sorrows? plead no more,\n'Tis reason tells me I am doubly wretched.\n\nCLEONE.\n\nBut hark, the music strikes, the rites begin,\nAnd, see, the doors are op'ning.\n\nEVANTHE.\n\n                                Let's retire;\nMy heart is now too full to meet him here,\nFly swift ye hours, till in his arms I'm prest,\nAnd each intruding care is hush'd to rest.\n\n\nSCENE V.\n\n_The Scene draws and discovers, in the inner part of the Temple, a\n  large image of the Sun, with an altar before it.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":521,"split":"train"}
