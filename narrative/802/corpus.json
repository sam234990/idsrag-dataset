{"ori_id":"ba75a22b975fe4a286bf129a1a3c354b42a60012","title":"Picture and Text","context":"Picture and Text\n Although originally conceived as an extended puff for Harper artists, who were also personal friends, the book presents some general ideas about the relation between author and illustration, picture and text, as well as the advancing technology of illustration. Both in print and in the theater, James welcomes advances in the technology of realism, but complains if the visual dominates author and actor. He praises the black-and-white engravings of the illustrators for their tact and their illumination of settings, but criticizes elaborate modern stage scenery that overwhelms the actor's art. These essays, although slight, are illustrated with drawings of each other by the artist subjects, and is itself an example of what James extols, as well as being a rare extended essay by James on the unity of the arts.\nThe illustrators of whom he wrote were an Anglo-American group, all personal friends, at a time when Harper was his principal publisher. They were known in the day for their summer gatherings at the village of Broadway in the Cotswolds, where for several years James joined them, and where Sargent gained his first footing among British artists. Among the artists in the group, Charles Reinhart illustrated some of James' own fiction, Alfred Parsons designed James's gardens at Lamb House, and the sets for James' play Guy Domville whose first, raucous performance he attended. Edwin Abbey and Sargent later collaborated on the enormous wall paintings for the Boston Public Library, and were among the leading artists of their day.\nJames' treatment of his friend Honore de Daumier was a welcome effort on behalf of an artist many considered little more than a political cartoonist. James found an \"impressive depth\" in Daumier's portrayal of the peculiar and the (sometimes) ugly. Many of Daumier's subjects are now remembered only in his often slashing work, but that's appropriate because all art \"prolongs...preserves...consecrates...raises from the dead.\"\nIn his essay on his prot\u0102\u0160g\u0102\u0160 John Singer Sargent, James marvels at the painter's complete knowledge of his art and his unfailing technical proficiency. James particularly admires Sargent's portraits of women, such as Miss Burckhardt (not identified by name but illustrated in the magazine text of the article) and Madame X (called Madame G in the essay). \"There is no greater work of art than a great portrait,\" James concludes, and Sargent's portraits combine \"quick perception\" and \"lingering reflection.\"\nThe essays on Daumier and Sargent have frequently been reprinted, but the book as a whole has been out of print since its first edition, in part because the black-and-white engravings that are its principal subject were so soon to be displaced by photographs and colored illustrations.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Picture and Text, by Henry James\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

The notice of Mr. Abbey and that of Mr.\nReinhart appeared in Harper's Weekly. That of Mr. Alfred Parsons figured\nas an introduction to the catalogue of an exhibition of his pictures.\nThe sketch of Daumier was first contributed to _The Century_, and \"After\nthe Play\" to _The New Review_.\n\n\n\n\nBLACK AND WHITE\n\n[Illustration: Black and White Page Image]\n\nIf there be nothing new under the sun there are some things a good\ndeal less old than others. The illustration of books, and even more of\nmagazines, may be said to have been born in our time, so far as\nvariety and abundance are the signs of it; or born, at any rate, the\ncomprehensive, ingenious, sympathetic spirit in which we conceive and\npractise it.\n\nIf the centuries are ever arraigned at some bar of justice to answer\nin regard to what they have given, of good or of bad, to humanity, our\ninteresting age (which certainly is not open to the charge of having\nstood with its hands in its pockets) might perhaps do worse than put\nforth the plea of having contributed a fresh interest in \"black and\nwhite.\" The claim may now be made with the more confidence from the very\nevident circumstance that this interest is far from exhausted. These\npages are an excellent place for such an assumption. In Harper they have\nagain and again, as it were, illustrated the illustration, and they\nconstitute for the artist a series of invitations, provocations and\nopportunities. They may be referred to without arrogance in support of\nthe contention that the limits of this large movement, with all its new\nand rare refinement, are not yet in sight.\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nIt is on the contrary the constant extension that is visible, with\nthe attendant circumstances of multiplied experiment and intensified\nresearch--circumstances that lately pressed once more on the attention\nof the writer of these remarks on his finding himself in the particular\nspot which history will perhaps associate most with the charming\nrevival. A very old English village, lying among its meadows and hedges,\nin the very heart of the country, in a hollow of the green hills of\nWorcestershire, is responsible directly and indirectly for some of the\nmost beautiful work in black and white with which I am at liberty to\nconcern myself here; in other words, for much of the work of Mr. Abbey\nand Mr. Alfred Parsons. I do not mean that Broadway has told these\ngentlemen all they know (the name, from which the American reader has to\nbrush away an incongruous association, may as well be written first as\nlast); for Mr. Parsons, in particular, who knows everything that can be\nknown about English fields and flowers, would have good reason to insist\nthat the measure of his large landscape art is a large experience. I\nonly suggest that if one loves Broadway and is familiar with it, and\nif a part of that predilection is that one has seen Mr. Abbey and Mr.\nParsons at work there, the pleasant confusion takes place of itself;\none's affection for the wide, long, grass-bordered vista of brownish\ngray cottages, thatched, latticed, mottled, mended, ivied, immemorial,\ngrows with the sense of its having ministered to other minds and\ntransferred itself to other recipients; just as the beauty of many a\nbit in many a drawing of the artists I have mentioned is enhanced by the\nsense, or at any rate by the desire, of recognition. Broadway and much\nof the land about it are in short the perfection of the old English\nrural tradition, and if they do not underlie all the combinations by\nwhich (in their pictorial accompaniments to rediscovered ballads, their\nvignettes to story or sonnet) these particular talents touch us almost\nto tears, we feel at least that they _would_ have sufficed: they cover\nthe scale.\n\n[Illustration: Priory]\n\nIn regard, however, to the implications and explications of this\nperfection of a village, primarily and to be just, Broadway is, more\nthan any one else. Mr. Frank Millet. Mr. Laurence Hutton discovered but\nMr. Millet appropriated it: its sweetness was wasted until he began to\ndistil and bottle it. He disinterred the treasure, and with impetuous\nliberality made us sharers in his fortune. His own work, moreover,\nbetrays him, as well as the gratitude of participants, as I could easily\nprove if it did not perversely happen that he has commemorated most of\nhis impressions in color. That excludes them from the small space here\nat my command; otherwise I could testify to the identity of old nooks\nand old objects, those that constitute both out-of-door and in-door\nfurniture.\n\n[Illustration: The village-green, Broadway]\n\nIn such places as Broadway, and it is part of the charm of them to\nAmerican eyes, the sky looks down on almost as many \"things\" as\nthe ceiling, and \"things\" are the joy of the illustrator. Furnished\napartments are useful to the artist, but a furnished country is still\nmore to his purpose. A ripe midland English region is a museum of\naccessories and specimens, and is sure, under any circumstances,\nto contain the article wanted. This is the great recommendation of\nBroadway; everything in it is convertible. Even the passing visitor\nfinds himself becoming so; the place has so much character that it rubs\noff on him, and if in an old garden--an old garden with old gates and\nold walls and old summer-houses--he lies down on the old grass (on\nan immemorial rug, no doubt), it is ten to one but that he will be\nconverted. The little oblong sheaves of blank paper with elastic straps\nare fluttering all over the place. There is portraiture in the air and\ncomposition in the very accidents. Everything is a subject or an effect,\na \"bit\" or a good thing. It is always some kind of day; if it be not one\nkind it is another. The garden walls, the mossy roofs, the open doorways\nand brown interiors, the old-fashioned flowers, the bushes in figures,\nthe geese on the green, the patches, the jumbles, the glimpses, the\ncolor, the surface, the general complexion of things, have all a value,\na reference and an application. If they are a matter of appreciation,\nthat is why the gray-brown houses are perhaps more brown than gray, and\nmore yellow than either. They are various things in turn, according to\nlights and days and needs. It is a question of color (all consciousness\nat Broadway is that), but the irresponsible profane are not called upon\nto settle the tint.\n\nIt is delicious to be at Broadway and to _be_ one of the irresponsible\nprofane--not to have to draw. The single street is in the grand style,\nsloping slowly upward to the base of the hills for a mile, but you may\nenjoy it without a carking care as to how to \"render\" the perspective.\nEverything is stone except the general greenness--a charming smooth\nlocal stone, which looks as if it had been meant for great constructions\nand appears even in dry weather to have been washed and varnished by the\nrain. Half-way up the road, in the widest place, where the coaches used\nto turn (there were many of old, but the traffic of Broadway was blown\nto pieces by steam, though the destroyer has not come nearer than half a\ndozen miles), a great gabled mansion, which was once a manor or a\nhouse of state, and is now a rambling inn, stands looking at a detached\nswinging sign which is almost as big as itself--a very grand sign, the\n\"arms\" of an old family, on the top of a very tall post. You will find\nsomething very like the place among Mr. Abbey's delightful illustrations\nto, \"She Stoops to Conquer.\" When the September day grows dim and some\nof the windows glow, you may look out, if you like, for Tony Lumpkin's\nred coat in the doorway or imagine Miss Hardcastle's quilted petticoat\non the stair.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n[Illustration: Millet]\n\nIt is characteristic of Mr. Frank Millet's checkered career, with\nopposites so much mingled in it, that such work as he has done for\nHarper should have had as little in common as possible with midland\nEnglish scenery. He has been less a producer in black and white than a\npromoter and, as I may say, a protector of such production in others;\nbut none the less the back volumes of Harper testify to the activity of\nhis pencil as well as to the variety of his interests. There was a time\nwhen he drew little else but Cossacks and Orientals, and drew them as\none who had good cause to be vivid. Of the young generation he was the\nfirst to know the Russian plastically, especially the Russian soldier,\nand he had paid heavily for his acquaintance. During the Russo-Turkish\nwar he was correspondent in the field (with the victors) of the New York\n_Herald_ and the London _Daily News_--a capacity in which he made many\nout-of-the-way, many precious, observations. He has seen strange\ncountries--the East and the South and the West and the North--and\npractised many arts. To the London _Graphic_, in 1877 he sent striking\nsketches from the East, as well as capital prose to the journals I have\nmentioned. He has always been as capable of writing a text for his own\nsketches as of making sketches for the text of others. He has made\npictures without words and words without pictures. He has written some\nvery clever ghost-stories, and drawn and painted some very immediate\nrealities. He has lately given himself up to these latter objects, and\ndiscovered that they have mysteries more absorbing than any others. I\nfind in Harper, in 1885. \"A Wild-goose Chase\" through North Germany and\nDenmark, in which both pencil and pen are Mr. Millet's, and both show\nthe natural and the trained observer.\n\nHe knows the art-schools of the Continent, the studios of Paris, the\n\"dodges\" of Antwerp, the subjects, the models of Venice, and has had\nmuch \u00c3\u00a6sthetic as well as much personal experience. He has draped and\ndistributed Greek plays at Harvard, as well as ridden over Balkans to\npost pressing letters, and given publicity to English villages in which\nsusceptible Americans may get the strongest sensations with the least\ntrouble to themselves. If the trouble in each case will have been\nlargely his, this is but congruous with the fact that he has not only\nfound time to have a great deal of history himself, but has suffered\nhimself to be converted by others into an element--beneficent I should\ncall it if discretion did not forbid me--of _their_ history. Springing\nfrom a very old New England stock, he has found the practice of art a\nwonderful antidote, in his own language, \"for belated Puritanism.\" He is\nvery modern, in the sense of having tried many things and availed\nhimself of all of the facilities of his time; but especially on this\nground of having fought out for himself the battle of the Puritan habit\nand the \u00c3\u00a6sthetic experiment. His experiment was admirably successful\nfrom the moment that the Puritan levity was forced to consent to its\nbecoming a serious one. In other words, if Mr. Millet is artistically\ninteresting to-day (and to the author of these remarks he is highly so),\nit is because he is a striking example of what the typical American\nquality can achieve.\n\nHe began by having an excellent pencil, because as a thoroughly\npractical man he could not possibly have had a weak one. But nothing\nis more remunerative to follow than the stages by which \"faculty\" in\ngeneral (which is what I mean by the characteristic American quality)\nhas become the particular faculty; so that if in the artist's present\nwork one recognizes--recognizes even fondly--the national handiness, it\nis as handiness regenerate and transfigured. The American adaptiveness\nhas become a Dutch finish. The only criticism I have to make is of the\npreordained paucity of Mr. Millet's drawings; for my mission is not to\nspeak of his work in oils, every year more important (as was indicated\nby the brilliant interior with figures that greeted the spectator in so\nfriendly a fashion on the threshold of the Royal Academy exhibition\nof 1888), nor to say that it is illustration too--illustration of\nany old-fashioned song or story that hums in the brain or haunts the\nmemory--nor even to hint that the admirable rendering of the charming\nold objects with which it deals (among which I include the human face\nand figure in dresses unfolded from the lavender of the past), the old\nsurfaces and tones, the stuffs and textures, the old mahogany and silver\nand brass--the old sentiment too, and the old picture-making vision--are\nin the direct tradition of Terburg and De Hoogh and Metzu.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nThere is no paucity about Mr. Abbey as a virtuoso in black and white,\nand if one thing more than another sets the seal upon the quality of\nhis work, it is the rare abundance in which it is produced. It is not a\nfrequent thing to find combinations infinite as well as exquisite. Mr.\nAbbey has so many ideas, and the gates of composition have been\nopened so wide to him, that we cultivate his company with a mixture of\nconfidence and excitement. The readers of Harper have had for years a\ngreat deal of it, and they will easily recognize the feeling I allude\nto--the expectation of familiarity in variety. The beautiful art and\ntaste, the admirable execution, strike the hour with the same note; but\nthe figure, the scene, is ever a fresh conception. Never was ripe skill\nless mechanical, and never was the faculty of perpetual evocation less\naddicted to prudent economies. Mr. Abbey never saves for the next\npicture, yet the next picture will be as expensive as the last. His\nwhole career has been open to the readers of Harper, so that what they\nmay enjoy on any particular occasion is not only the talent, but a kind\nof affectionate sense of the history of the talent, That history is,\nfrom the beginning, in these pages, and it is one of the most\ninteresting and instructive, just as the talent is one of the richest\nand the most sympathetic in the art-annals of our generation. I may as\nwell frankly declare that I have such a taste for Mr. Abbey's work that\nI cannot affect a judicial tone about it. Criticism is appreciation or\nit is nothing, and an intelligence of the matter in hand is recorded\nmore substantially in a single positive sign of such appreciation than\nin a volume of sapient objections for objection's sake--the cheapest of\nall literary commodities. Silence is the perfection of disapproval, and\nit has the great merit of leaving the value of speech, when the moment\ncomes for it, unimpaired.\n\nAccordingly it is important to translate as adequately as possible the\npositive side of Mr. Abbey's activity. None to-day is more charming, and\nnone helps us more to take the large, joyous, observant, various view\nof the business of art. He has enlarged the idea of illustration, and\nhe plays with it in a hundred spontaneous, ingenious ways. \"Truth and\npoetry\" is the motto legibly stamped upon his pencil-case, for if he has\non the one side a singular sense of the familiar, salient, importunate\nfacts of life, on the other they reproduce themselves in his mind in a\ndelightfully qualifying medium. It is this medium that the fond observer\nmust especially envy Mr. Abbey, and that a literary observer will envy\nhim most of all.\n\nSuch a hapless personage, who may have spent hours in trying to produce\nsomething of the same result by sadly different means, will measure\nthe difference between the roundabout, faint descriptive tokens of\nrespectable prose and the immediate projection of the figure by the\npencil. A charming story-teller indeed he would be who should write as\nMr. Abbey draws. However, what is style for one art is style for other,\nso blessed is the fraternity that binds them together, and the worker\nin words may take a lesson from the picture-maker of \"She Stoops to\nConquer.\" It is true that what the verbal artist would like to do\nwould be to find out the secret of the pictorial, to drink at the same\nfountain. Mr. Abbey is essentially one of those who would tell us if he\ncould, and conduct us to the magic spring; but here he is in the nature\nof the case helpless, for the happy _ambiente_ as the Italians call it,\nin which his creations move is exactly the thing, as I take it, that\nhe can least give an account of. It is a matter of genius and\nimagination--one of those things that a man determines for himself as\nlittle as he determines the color of his eyes. How, for instance, can\nMr. Abbey explain the manner in which he directly _observes_ figures,\nscenes, places, that exist only in the fairy-land of his fancy? For the\npeculiar sign of his talent is surely this observation in the remote. It\nbrings the remote near to us, but such a complicated journey as it must\nfirst have had to make! Remote in time (in differing degrees), remote\nin place, remote in feeling, in habit, and in their ambient air, are the\nimages that spring from his pencil, and yet all so vividly, so minutely,\nso consistently seen! Where does he see them, where does he find them,\nhow does he catch them, and in what language does he delightfully\nconverse with them? In what mystic recesses of space does the revelation\ndescend upon him?\n\nThe questions flow from the beguiled but puzzled admirer, and their\ntenor sufficiently expresses the claim I make for the admirable artist\nwhen I say that his truth is interfused with poetry. He spurns the\nliteral and yet superabounds in the characteristic, and if he makes\nthe strange familiar he makes the familiar just strange enough to be\ndistinguished. Everything is so human, so humorous and so caught in the\nact, so buttoned and petticoated and gartered, that it might be round\nthe corner; and so it is--but the corner is the corner of another world.\nIn that other world Mr. Abbey went forth to dwell in extreme youth, as I\nneed scarcely be at pains to remind those who have followed him in\nHarper. It is not important here to give a catalogue of his\ncontributions to that journal: turn to the back volumes and you will\nmeet him at every step. Every one remembers his young, tentative,\nprelusive illustrations to Herrick, in which there are the prettiest\nglimpses, guesses and foreknowledge of the effects he was to make\ncompletely his own. The Herrick was done mainly, if I mistake not,\nbefore he had been to England, and it remains, in the light of this\nfact, a singularly touching as well as a singularly promising\nperformance. The eye of sense in such a case had to be to a rare extent\nthe mind's eye, and this convertibility of the two organs has persisted.\n\nFrom the first and always that other world and that qualifying medium\nin which I have said that the human spectacle goes on for Mr. Abbey have\nbeen a county of old England which is not to be found in any geography,\nthough it borders, as I have hinted, on the Worcestershire Broadway. Few\nartistic phenomena are more curious than the congenital acquaintance of\nthis perverse young Philadelphian with that mysterious locality. It is\nthere that he finds them all--the nooks, the corners, the people, the\nclothes, the arbors and gardens and teahouses, the queer courts of old\ninns, the sun-warmed angles of old parapets. I ought to have mentioned\nfor completeness, in addition to his pictures to Goldsmith and to the\nscraps of homely British song (this latter class has contained some of\nhis most exquisite work), his delicate drawing's for Mr. William Black's\n_Judith Shakespeare_. And in relation to that distinguished name--I\ndon't mean Mr. Black's--it is a comfort, if I may be allowed the\nexpression, to know that (as, to the best of my belief, I violate\nno confidence in saying) he is even now engaged in the great work of\nillustrating the comedies. He is busy with \"The Merchant of Venice;\"\nhe is up to his neck in studies, in rehearsals. Here again, while in\nprevision I admire the result, what I can least refrain from expressing\nis a sort of envy of the process, knowing what it is with Mr. Abbey and\nwhat explorations of the delightful it entails--arduous, indefatigable,\ntill the end seems almost smothered in the means (such material\ncomplications they engender), but making one's daily task a thing of\nbeauty and honor and beneficence.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n[Illustration: Alfred Parsons]\n\nEven if Mr. Alfred Parsons were not a masterly contributor to the pages\nof Harper, it would still be almost inevitable to speak of him after\nspeaking of Mr. Abbey, for the definite reason (I hope that in giving it\nI may not appear to invade too grossly the domain of private life)\nthat these gentlemen are united in domestic circumstance as well as\nassociated in the nature of their work. In London, in the relatively\nlucid air of Campden Hill, they dwell together, and their beautiful\nstudios are side by side. However, there is a reason for commemorating\nMr. Parsons' work which has nothing to do with the accidental--the\nsimple fact that that work forms the richest illustration of the English\nlandscape that is offered us to-day. Harper has for a long time past\nbeen full of Mr. Alfred Parsons, who has made the dense, fine detail\nof his native land familiar in far countries, amid scenery of a very\ndifferent type. This is what the modern illustration can do when the\nripeness of the modern sense is brought to it and the wood-cutter plays\nwith difficulties as the brilliant Americans do to-day, following his\noriginal at a breakneck pace. An illusion is produced which, in its very\ncompleteness, makes one cast an uneasy eye over the dwindling fields\nthat are still left to conquer. Such art as Alfred Parsons'--such an\naccomplished translation of local aspects, translated in its turn by\ncunning hands and diffused by a wonderful system of periodicity through\nvast and remote communities, has, I confess, in a peculiar degree, the\neffect that so many things have in this age of multiplication--that\nof suppressing intervals and differences and making the globe seem\nalarmingly small. Vivid and repeated evocations of English rural\nthings--the meadows and lanes, the sedgy streams, the old orchards and\ntimbered houses, the stout, individual, insular trees, the flowers under\nthe hedge and in it and over it, the sweet rich country seen from the\nslope, the bend of the unformidable river, the actual romance of the\ncastle against the sky, the place on the hill-side where the gray church\nbegins to peep (a peaceful little grassy path leads up to it over\na stile)--all this brings about a terrible displacement of the very\nobjects that make pilgrimage a passion, and hurries forward that\nambiguous advantage which I don't envy our grandchildren, that of\nknowing all about everything in advance, having trotted round the globe\nannually in the magazines and lost the bloom of personal experience. It\nis a part of the general abolition of mystery with which we are all so\ncomplacently busy today. One would like to retire to another planet with\na box of Mr. Parsons' drawings, and be homesick there for the pleasant\nplaces they commemorate.\n\nThere are many things to be said about his talent, some of which are\nnot the easiest in the world to express. I shall not, however, make them\nmore difficult by attempting to catalogue his contributions in these\npages. A turning of the leaves of Harper brings one constantly face to\nface with him, and a systematic search speedily makes one intimate.\nThe reader will remember the beautiful Illustrations to Mr. Blackmore's\nnovel of _Springhaven_, which were interspersed with striking\nfigure-pieces from the pencil of that very peculiar pictorial humorist\nMr. Frederick Barnard, who, allowing for the fact that he always seems\na little too much to be drawing for Dickens and that the footlights\nare the illumination of his scenic world, has so remarkable a sense of\nEnglish types and attitudes, costumes and accessories, in what may be\ncalled the great-coat-and-gaiters period--the period when people\nwere stiff with riding and wicked conspiracies went forward in sanded\nprovincial inn-parlors. Mr. Alfred Parsons, who is still conveniently\nyoung, waked to his first vision of pleasant material in the\ncomprehensive county of Somerset--a capital centre of impression for a\npainter of the bucolic. He has been to America; he has even reproduced\nwith remarkable discrimination and truth some of the way-side objects\nof that country, not making them look in the least like their English\nequivalents, if equivalents they may be said to have. Was it there that\nMr. Parsons learned so well how Americans would like England to appear?\nI ask this idle question simply because the England of his pencil, and\nnot less of his brush (of his eminent brush there would be much to say),\nis exactly the England that the American imagination, restricted\nto itself, constructs from the poets, the novelists, from all the\ndelightful testimony it inherits. It was scarcely to have been supposed\npossible that the native point of view would embrace and observe so\nmany of the things that the more or less famished outsider is, in vulgar\nparlance, \"after.\" In other words (though I appear to utter a foolish\nparadox), the danger might have been that Mr. Parsons knew his subject\ntoo well to feel it--to feel it, I mean, _\u00c3\u00a0 l'Am\u00c3\u00a9ricaine_. He is as\ntender of it as if he were vague about it, and as certain of it as if he\nwere _blas\u00c3\u00a9_.\n\nBut after having wished that his country should be just so, we proceed\nto discover that it is in fact not a bit different. Between these phases\nof our consciousness he is an unfailing messenger. The reader will\nremember how often he has accompanied with pictures the text of some\namiable paper describing a pastoral region--Warwickshire or Surrey.\nDevonshire or the Thames. He will remember his exquisite designs for\ncertain of Wordsworth's sonnets. A sonnet of Wordsworth is a difficult\nthing to illustrate, but Mr. Parsons' ripe taste has shown him the way.\nThen there are lovely morsels from his hand associated with the drawings\nof his friend Mr. Abbey--head-pieces, tailpieces, vignettes, charming\ncombinations of flower and foliage, decorative clusters of all sorts\nof pleasant rural emblems. If he has an inexhaustible feeling for the\ncountry in general, his love of the myriad English flowers is perhaps\nthe fondest part of it. He draws them with a rare perfection, and\nalways--little definite, delicate, tremulous things as they are--with\na certain nobleness. This latter quality, indeed. I am prone to find in\nall his work, and I should insist on it still more if I might refer\nto his important paintings. So composite are the parts of which any\ndistinguished talent is made up that we have to feel our way as we\nenumerate them; and yet that very ambiguity is a challenge to analysis\nand to characterization. This \"nobleness\" on Mr. Parsons' part is the\nelement of style--something large and manly, expressive of the total\ncharacter of his facts. His landscape is the landscape of the male\nvision, and yet his touch is full of sentiment, of curiosity and\nendearment. These things, and others besides, make him the most\ninteresting, the most living, of the new workers in his line. And what\nshall I say of the other things besides? How can I take precautions\nenough to say that among the new workers, deeply English as he is, there\nis comparatively something French in his manner? Many people will like\nhim because they see in him--or they think they do--a certain happy\nmean. Will they not fancy they catch him taking the middle way between\nthe unsociable French _\u00c3\u00a9tude_ and the old-fashioned English \"picture\"?\nIf one of these extremes is a desert, the other, no doubt, is an oasis\nstill more vain. I have a recollection of productions of Mr. Alfred\nParsons' which might have come from a Frenchman who was in love with\nEnglish river-sides. I call to mind no studies--if he has made any--of\nFrench scenery; but if I did they would doubtless appear English enough.\nIt is the fashion among sundry to maintain that the English landscape\nis of no use for _la peinture s\u00c3\u00a9rieuse_, that it is wanting in technical\naccent and is in general too storytelling, too self-conscious\nand dramatic also too lumpish and stodgy, of a green--_d'un vert\nb\u00c3\u00aate_--which, when reproduced, looks like that of the chromo. Certain\nit is that there are many hands which are not to be trusted with it,\nand taste and integrity have been known to go down before it. But Alfred\nParsons may be pointed to as one who has made the luxuriant and\nlovable things of his own country almost as \"serious\" as those familiar\nobjects--the pasture and the poplar--which, even when infinitely\nrepeated by the great school across the Channel, strike us as but meagre\nmorsels of France.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n[Illustration: Mr. George H. Boughton]\n\nIn speaking of Mr. George H. Boughton, A.R.A., I encounter the same\ndifficulty as with Mr. Millet: I find the window closed through which\nalone almost it is just to take a view of his talent. Mr. Boughton is\na painter about whom there is little that is new to tell to-day, so\nconspicuous and incontestable is his achievement, the fruit of a career\nof which the beginning was not yesterday. He is a draughtsman and an\nillustrator only on occasion and by accident. These accidents have\nmostly occurred, however, in the pages of Harper, and the happiest of\nthem will still be fresh in the memory of its readers. In the _Sketching\nRambles in Holland_ Mr. Abbey was a participant (as witness, among many\nthings, the admirable drawing of the old Frisian woman bent over her\nBible in church, with the heads of the burghers just visible above the\nrough archaic pew-tops--a drawing opposite to page 112 in the handsome\nvolume into which these contributions were eventually gathered\ntogether); but most of the sketches were Mr. Boughton's, and the\ncharming, amusing text is altogether his, save in the sense that\nit commemorates his companion's impressions as well as his own--the\ndelightful, irresponsible, visual, sensual, pictorial, capricious\nimpressions of a painter in a strange land, the person surely whom\nat particular moments one would give most to be. If there be anything\nhappier than the impressions of a painter, it is the impressions of two,\nand the combination is set forth with uncommon spirit and humor in this\nfrank record of the innocent lust of the eyes. Mr. Boughton scruples\nlittle, in general, to write as well as to draw, when the fancy takes\nhim; to write in the manner of painters, with the bold, irreverent,\nunconventional, successful brush. If I were not afraid of the\npatronizing tone I would say that there is little doubt that if as a\npainter he had not had to try to write in character, he would certainly\nhave made a characteristic writer. He has the most enviable \"finds,\" not\ndreamed of in timid literature, yet making capital descriptive prose.\nOther specimens of them may be encountered in two or three Christmas\ntales, signed with the name whose usual place is the corner of a\nvaluable canvas.\n\nIf Mr. Boughton is in this manner not a simple talent, further\ncomplications and reversions may be observed in him, as, for instance,\nthat having reverted from America, where he spent his early years, back\nto England, the land of his origin, he has now in a sense oscillated\nagain from the latter to the former country. He came to London one day\nyears ago (from Paris, where he had been eating nutritively of the tree\nof artistic knowledge), in order to re-embark on the morrow for the\nUnited States; but that morrow never came--it has never come yet.\nCertainly now it never _can_ come, for the country that Mr. Boughton\nleft behind him in his youth is no longer there; the \"old New York\" is\nno longer a port to sail to, unless for phantom ships. In imagination,\nhowever, the author of \"The Return of the _Mayflower_\" has several times\ntaken his way back; he has painted with conspicuous charm and success\nvarious episodes of the early Puritan story. He was able on occasion\nto remember vividly enough the low New England coast and the thin New\nEngland air. He has been perceptibly an inventor, calling into being\ncertain types of face and dress, certain tones and associations of color\n(all in the line of what I should call subdued harmonies if I were not\nafraid of appearing to talk a jargon), which people are hungry for when\nthey acquire \"a Boughton,\" and which they can obtain on no other terms.\nThis pictorial element in which he moves is made up of divers delicate\nthings, and there would be a roughness in attempting to unravel the\ntapestry. There is old English, and old American, and old Dutch in\nit, and a friendly, unexpected new Dutch too--an ingredient of New\nAmsterdam--a strain of Knickerbocker and of Washington Irving. There is\nan admirable infusion of landscape in it, from which some people regret\nthat Mr. Boughton should ever have allowed himself to be distracted by\nhis importunate love of sad-faced, pretty women in close-fitting coifs\nand old silver-clasped cloaks. And indeed, though his figures are very\n\"tender,\" his landscape is to my sense tenderer still. Moreover, Mr.\nBoughton bristles, not aggressively, but in the degree of a certain\nconciliatory pertinacity, with contradictious properties. He lives in\none of the prettiest and most hospitable houses in London, but the note\nof his work is the melancholy of rural things, of lonely people and of\nquaint, far-off legend and refrain. There is a delightful ambiguity of\nperiod and even of clime in him, and he rejoices in that inability to\ndepict the modern which is the most convincing sign of the contemporary.\nHe has a genius for landscape, yet he abounds in knowledge of every sort\nof ancient fashion of garment; the buckles and button-holes, the very\nshoe-ties, of the past are dear to him. It is almost always autumn or\nwinter in his pictures. His horizons are cold, his trees are bare (he\ndoes the bare tree beautifully), and his draperies lined with fur; but\nwhen he exhibits himself directly, as in the fantastic \"Rambles\" before\nmentioned, contagious high spirits are the clearest of his showing.\nHere he appears as an irrepressible felicitous sketcher, and I know no\npleasanter record of the joys of sketching, or even of those of simply\nlooking. Th\u00c3\u00a9ophile Gautier himself was not more inveterately addicted to\nthis latter wanton exercise. There ought to be a pocket edition of Mr.\nBoughton's book, which would serve for travellers in other countries\ntoo, give them the point of view and put them in the mood. Such\na blessing, and such a distinction too, is it to have an eye. Mr.\nBoughton's, in his good-humored Dutch wanderings, holds from morning\ntill night a sociable, graceful revel. From the moment it opens till the\nmoment it closes, its day is a round of adventures. His jolly pictorial\nnarrative, reflecting every glint of October sunshine and patch of\nrusset shade, tends to confirm us afresh in the faith that the painter's\nlife is the best life, the life that misses fewest impressions.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n[Illustration: Du Maurier]\n\nMr. Du Maurier has a brilliant history, but it must be candidly\nrecognized that it is written or drawn mainly in an English periodical.\nIt is only during the last two or three years that the most ironical of\nthe artists of _Punch_ has exerted himself for the entertainment of the\nreaders of Harper; but I seem to come too late with any commentary on\nthe nature of his satire or the charm of his execution. When he began to\nappear in Harper he was already an old friend, and for myself I confess\nI have to go through rather a complicated mental operation to put into\nwords what I think of him. What does a man think of the language he\nhas learned to speak? He judges it only while he is learning. Mr. Du\nMaurier's work, in regard to the life it embodies, is not so much a\nthing we see as one of the conditions of seeing. He has interpreted for\nus for so many years the social life of England that the interpretation\nhas become the text itself. We have accepted his types, his categories,\nhis conclusions, his sympathies and his ironies, It is not given to all\nthe world to thread the mazes of London society, and for the great body\nof the disinherited, the vast majority of the Anglo-Saxon public. Mr. Du\nMaurier's representation is the thing represented. Is the effect of it\nto nip in the bud any remote yearning for personal participation? I feel\ntempted to say yes, when I think of the follies, the flatnesses, the\naffectations and stupidities that his teeming pencil has made vivid. But\nthat vision immediately merges itself in another--a panorama of tall,\npleasant, beautiful people, placed in becoming attitudes, in charming\ngardens, in luxurious rooms, so that I can scarcely tell which is the\nmore definite, the impression satiric or the impression plastic.\n\nThis I take to be a sign that Mr. Du Maurier knows how to be general\nand has a conception of completeness. The world amuses him, such queer\nthings go on in it; but the part that amuses him most is certain lines\nof our personal structure. That amusement is the brightest; the other\nis often sad enough. A sharp critic might accuse Mr. Du Maurier of\nlingering too complacently on the lines in question; of having a\ncertain ideal of \"lissome\" elongation to which the promiscuous truth is\nsometimes sacrificed. But in fact this artist's P truth never pretends\nto be promiscuous; it is avowedly select and specific. What he depicts\nis so preponderantly the \"tapering\" people that the remainder of the\npicture, in a notice as brief as the present, may be neglected. If his\n_dramatis person\u00c3\u00a6_ are not all the tenants of drawing-rooms, they are\nrepresented at least in some relation to these. 'Arry and his friends\nat the fancy fair are in society for the time; the point of introducing\nthem is to show how the contrast intensifies them. Of late years Mr. Du\nMaurier has perhaps been a little too docile to the muse of elegance;\nthe idiosyncrasies of the \"masher\" and the high girl with elbows have\nbeguiled him into occasional inattention to the doings of the short and\nshabby. But his career has been long and rich, and I allude, in such\nwords, but to a moment of it.\n\nThe moral of it--I refer to the artistic one--seen altogether, is\nstriking and edifying enough. What Mr. Du Maurier has attempted to do is\nto give, in a thousand interrelated drawings, a general satiric picture\nof the social life of his time and country. It is easy to see that\nthrough them \"an increasing purpose runs;\" they all hang together and\nrefer to each other--complete, confirm, correct, illuminate each other.\nSometimes they are not satiric: satire is not pure charm, and the artist\nhas allowed himself to \"go in\" for pure charm. Sometimes he has allowed\nhimself to go in for pure fantasy, so that satire (which should hold on\nto the mane of the real) slides off the other side of the runaway horse.\nBut he remains, on the whole, pencil in hand, a wonderfully copious and\nveracious historian of his age and his civilization.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nI have left Mr. Reinhart to the last because of his importance, and now\nthis very importance operates as a restriction and even as a sort of\nreproach to me. To go well round him at a deliberate pace would take\na whole book. With Mr. Abbey, Mr. Reinhart is the artist who has\ncontributed most abundantly to Harper; his work, indeed, in quantity,\nconsiderably exceeds Mr. Abbey's. He is the observer of the immediate,\nas Mr. Abbey is that of the considerably removed, and the conditions he\nasks us to accept are less expensive to the imagination than those of\nhis colleague. He is, in short, the vigorous, racy _prosateur_ of that\nhuman comedy of which Mr. Abbey is the poet. He illustrates the\nmodern sketch of travel, the modern tale--the poor little \"quiet,\"\npsychological, conversational modern tale, which I often think the\nartist invited to represent it to the eye must hate, unless he be a very\nintelligent master, little, on a superficial view, would there appear to\nbe in it to represent. The superficial view is, after all, the natural\none for the picture-maker. A talent of the first order, however, only\nwants to be set thinking, as a single word will often make it. Mr.\nReinhart at any rate, triumphs; whether there be life or not in the\nlittle tale itself, there is unmistakable life in his version of it.\nMr. Reinhart deals in that element purely with admirable frankness\nand vigor. He is not so much suggestive as positively and sharply\nrepresentative. His facility, his agility, his universality are a truly\nstimulating sight. He asks not too many questions of his subject, but to\nthose he does ask he insists upon a thoroughly intelligible answer. By\nhis universality I mean perhaps as much as anything else his admirable\ndrawing; not precious, as the \u00c3\u00a6sthetic say, nor pottering, as the\nvulgar, but free, strong and secure, which enables him to do with the\nhuman figure at a moment's notice anything that any occasion may demand.\nIt gives him an immense range, and I know not how to express (it is\nnot easy) my sense of a certain capable indifference that is in him\notherwise than by saying that he would quite as soon do one thing as\nanother.\n\nFor it is true that the admirer of his work rather misses in him that\nintimation of a secret preference which many strong draughtsmen show,\nand which is not absent, for instance (I don't mean the secret, but the\nintimation), from the beautiful doings of Mr. Abbey. It is extremely\npresent in Mr. Du Maurier's work, just as it was visible, less\nelusively, in that of John Leech, his predecessor in _Punch_. Mr. Abbey\nhas a haunting type; Du Maurier has a haunting type. There was little\nperhaps of the haunted about Leech, but we know very well how he wanted\nhis pretty girls, his British swell, and his \"hunting men\" to look. He\nbetrayed a predilection; he had his little ideal. That an artist may be\na great force and not have a little ideal, the scarcely too much to be\npraised Charles Keene is there (I mean he is in _Punch_) to show us.\nHe has not a haunting type--not he--and I think that no one has yet\ndiscovered how he would have liked his pretty girls to look. He has kept\nthe soft conception too much to himself--he has not trifled with the\ncommon truth by letting it appear. This common truth, in its innumerable\ncombinations, is what Mr. Rein-hart also shows us (with of course\ninfinitely less of a _parti pris_ of laughing at it), though, as I must\nhasten to add, the female face and form in his hands always happen to\ntake on a much lovelier cast than in Mr. Keene's. These things with him,\nhowever, are not a private predilection, an artist's dream. Mr. Reinhart\nis solidly an artist, but I doubt whether as yet he dreams, and the\nabsence of private predilections makes him seem a little hard. He is\nsometimes rough with our average humanity, and especially rough with the\nfeminine portion of it. He usually represents American life, in which\nthat portion is often spoken of as showing to peculiar advantage. But\nMr. Reinhart sees it generally, as very _bourgeois_. His good ladies are\napt to be rather thick and short, rather huddled and plain. I\nshouldn't mind it so much if they didn't look so much alive. They are\nincontestably possible. The long, brilliant series of drawings he\nmade to accompany Mr. Charles Dudley Warner's papers on the American\nwatering-places form a rich _bourgeois_ epic, which imaginations haunted\nby a type must accept with philosophy, for the sketches in question will\nhave carried the tale, and all sorts of irresistible illusion with it,\nto the four corners of the earth. Full of observation and reality,\nof happy impressionism, taking all things as they come, with many a\ncharming picture of youthful juxtaposition, they give us a sense, to\nwhich nothing need be added, of the energy of Mr. Reinhart's pencil.\nThey are a final collection of pictorial notes on the manners and\ncustoms, the aspects and habitats, in July and August, of the great\nAmerican democracy; of which, certainly, taking one thing with another,\nthey give a very comfortable, cheerful account. But they confirm that\nanalytic view of which I have ventured to give a hint--the view of Mr.\nReinhart as an artist of immense capacity who yet somehow doesn't care.\nI must add that this aspect of him is modified, in the one case very\ngracefully, in the other by the operation of a sort of constructive\nhumor, remarkably strong, in his illustrations of Spanish life and his\nsketches of the Berlin political world.\n\nHis fashion of remaining outside, as it were, makes him (to the analyst)\nonly the more interesting, for the analyst, if he have any critical\nlife in him, will be prone to wonder _why_ he doesn't care, and whether\nmatters may not be turned about in such a way as that he should, with\nthe consequence that his large capacity would become more fruitful\nstill. Mr. Reinhart is open to the large appeal of Paris, where he\nlives--as is evident from much of his work--where he paints, and where,\nin crowded exhibitions, reputation and honors have descended upon him.\nAnd yet Paris, for all she may have taught him, has not given him the\nmystic sentiment--about which I am perhaps writing nonsense. Is it\nnonsense to say that, being very much an incarnation of the modern\ninternational spirit (he might be a Frenchman in New York were he not\nan American in Paris), the moral of his work is possibly the inevitable\nwant of finality, of intrinsic character, in that sweet freedom?\nDoes the cosmopolite necessarily pay for his freedom by a want of\nfunction--the impersonality of not being representative? Must one be a\nlittle narrow to have a sentiment, and very local to have a quality, or\nat least a style; and would the missing type, if I may mention it\nyet again, haunt our artist--who is somehow, in his rare instrumental\nfacility, outside of quality and style--a good deal more if he were not,\namid the mixture of associations and the confusion of races, liable to\nfall into vagueness as to what types are? He can do anything he likes;\nby which I mean he can do wonderfully even the things he doesn't like.\nBut he strikes me as a force not yet fully used.\n\n\n\n\nEDWIN A. ABBE\n\nNothing is more interesting in the history of an artistic talent than\nthe moment at which its \"elective affinity\" declares itself, and the\ninterest is great in proportion as the declaration is unmistakable.\nI mean by the elective affinity of a talent its climate and period of\npreference, the spot on the globe or in the annals of mankind to which\nit most fondly attaches itself, to which it reverts incorrigibly, round\nwhich it revolves with a curiosity that is insatiable, from which in\nshort it draws its strongest inspiration. A man may personally inhabit\na certain place at a certain time, but in imagination he may be a\nperpetual absentee, and to a degree worse than the worst Irish landlord,\nseparating himself from his legal inheritance not only by mountains\nand seas, but by centuries as well. When he is a man of genius these\nperverse predilections become fruitful and constitute a new and\nindependent life, and they are indeed to a certain extent the sign and\nconcomitant of genius. I do not mean by this that high ability would\nalways rather have been born in another country and another age, but\ncertainly it likes to choose, it seldom fails to react against imposed\nconditions. If it accepts them it does so because it likes them for\nthemselves; and if they fail to commend themselves it rarely scruples\nto fly away in search of others. We have witnessed this flight in many\na case; I admit that if we have sometimes applauded it we have felt at\nother moments that the discontented, undomiciled spirit had better have\nstayed at home.\n\nMr. Abbey has gone afield, and there could be no better instance of a\nsuccessful fugitive and a genuine affinity, no more interesting example\nof selection--selection of field and subject--operating by that insight\nwhich has the precocity and certainty of an instinct. The domicile of\nMr. Abbey's genius is the England of the eighteenth century; I should\nadd that the palace of art which he has erected there commands--from the\nrear, as it were--various charming glimpses of the preceding age.\nThe finest work he has yet done is in his admirable illustrations, in\nHarper's Magazine, to \"She Stoops to Conquer,\" but the promise that he\nwould one day do it was given some years ago in his delightful volume\nof designs to accompany Herrick's poems; to which we may add, as\nsupplementary evidence, his drawings for Mr. William Black's novel of\n_Judith Shakespeare_.\n\nMr. Abbey was born in Philadelphia in 1852, and manifesting his\nbrilliant but un-encouraged aptitudes at a very early age, came in 1872\nto New York to draw for Harper's WEEKLY. Other views than this, if I\nhave been correctly Informed, had been entertained for his future--a\nfact that provokes a smile now that his manifest destiny has been, or\nis in course of being, so very neatly accomplished. The spirit of modern\naesthetics did not, at any rate, as I understand the matter, smile upon\nhis cradle, and the circumstance only increases the interest of his\nhaving had from the earliest moment the clearest artistic vision.\n\nIt has sometimes happened that the distinguished draughtsman or painter\nhas been born in the studio and fed, as it were, from the palette, but\nin the great majority of cases he has been nursed by the profane, and\ncertainly, on the doctrine of mathematical chances, a Philadelphia\ngenius would scarcely be an exception. Mr. Abbey was fortunate, however,\nin not being obliged to lose time; he learned how to swim by jumping\ninto deep water. Even if he had not known by instinct how to draw, he\nwould have had to perform the feat from the moment that he found himself\nattached to the \"art department\" of a remarkably punctual periodical.\nIn such a periodical the events of the day are promptly reproduced; and\nwith the morrow so near the day is necessarily a short one--too short\nfor gradual education. Such a school is not, no doubt, the ideal one,\nbut in fact it may have a very happy influence. If a youth is to give an\naccount of a scene with his pencil at a certain hour--to give it, as it\nwere, or perish--he will have become conscious, in the first place, of\na remarkable incentive to observe it. so that the roughness of the\nfoster-mother who imparts the precious faculty of quick, complete\nobservation is really a blessing in disguise. To say that it was simply\nunder this kind of pressure that Mr. Abbey acquired the extraordinary\nrefinement which distinguishes his work in black and white is doubtless\nto say too much; but his admirers may be excused, in view of the\nbeautiful result, for almost wishing, on grounds of patriotism, to make\nthe training, or the absence of training, responsible for as much as\npossible. For as no artistic genius that our country has produced is\nmore delightful than Mr. Abbey's, so, surely, nothing could be more\ncharacteristically American than that it should have formed itself in\nthe conditions that happened to be nearest at hand, with the crowds,\nstreets and squares, the railway stations and telegraph poles, the\nwondrous sign-boards and triumphant bunting, of New York for the source\nof its inspiration, and with a big hurrying printing-house for its\nstudio. If to begin the practice of art in these conditions was to incur\nthe danger of being crude, Mr. Abbey braved it with remarkable success.\nAt all events, if he went neither I through the mill of Paris nor\nthrough that of Munich, the writer of these lines more than consoles\nhimself for the accident. His talent is unsurpassably fine, and yet we\nreflect with complacency that he picked it up altogether at home.\nIf he is highly distinguished he is irremediably native, and (premising\nalways that I speak mainly of his work in black and white) it is\ndifficult to see, as we look, for instance, at the admirable series of\nhis drawings for \"She Stoops to Conquer,\" what more Paris or Munich\ncould have done for him. There is a certain refreshment in meeting an\nAmerican artist of the first order who is not a pupil of G\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00b4me or of\nCabanel.\n\nOf course, I hasten to add, we must make our account with the fact that,\nas I began with remarking, the great development of Mr. Abbey's powers\nhas taken place amid the brown old accessories of a country where\nthat eighteenth century which he presently marked for his own are more\nprofusely represented than they have the good-fortune to be in America,\nand consequently limit our contention to the point that his talent\nitself was already formed when this happy initiation was opened to it.\nHe went to England for the first time in 1878. but it was not all at\nonce that he fell into the trick, so irresistible for an artist doing\nhis special work, of living there, I must forbid myself every\nimpertinent conjecture, but it may be respectfully assumed that Mr.\nAbbey rather drifted into exile than committed himself to it with malice\nprepense. The habit, at any rate, to-day appears to be confirmed, and,\nto express it roughly, he is surrounded by the utensils and conveniences\nthat he requires. During these years, until the recent period when he\nbegan to exhibit at the water-color exhibitions, his work has been done\nprincipally for Harper's Magazine, and the record of it is to be found\nin the recent back volumes. I shall not take space to tell it over piece\nby piece, for the reader who turns to the Magazine will have no\ndifficulty in recognizing it. It has a distinction altogether its own;\nthere is always poetry, humor, charm, in the idea, and always infinite\ngrace and security in the execution.\n\nAs I have intimated, Mr. Abbey never deals with the things and figures\nof to-day; his imagination must perform a wide backward journey before\nit can take the air. But beyond this modern radius it breathes with\nsingular freedom and naturalness. At a distance of fifty years it begins\nto be at home; it expands and takes possession; it recognizes its own.\nWith all his ability, with all his tact, it would be impossible to him,\nwe conceive, to illustrate a novel of contemporary manners; he would\ninevitably throw it back to the age of hair-powder and post-chaises.\nThe coats and trousers, the feminine gear, the chairs and tables of the\ncurrent year, the general aspect of things immediate and familiar, say\nnothing to his mind, and there are other interpreters to whom he is\nquite content to leave them. He shows no great interest even in the\nmodern face, if there be a modern face apart from a modern setting; I\nam not sure what he thinks of its complications and refinements of\nexpression, but he has certainly little relish for its _banal_, vulgar\nmustache, its prosaic, mercantile whisker, surmounting the last new\nthing in shirt-collars. Dear to him is the physiognomy of clean-shaven\nperiods, when cheek and lip and chin, abounding in line and surface,\nhad the air of soliciting the pencil. Impeccable as he is in drawing,\nhe likes a whole face, with reason, and likes a whole figure; the\nlatter not to the exclusion of clothes, in which he delights, but as the\nclothes of our great-grandfathers helped it to be seen. No one has ever\nunderstood breeches and stockings better than he, or the human leg, that\ndelight of the draughtsman, as the costume of the last century permitted\nit to be known. The petticoat and bodice of the same period have as\nlittle mystery for him, and his women and girls have altogether the\npoetry of a by-gone manner and fashion. They are not modern heroines,\nwith modern nerves and accomplishments, but figures of remembered song\nand story, calling up visions of spinet and harpsichord that have\nlost their music today, high-walled gardens that have ceased to\nbloom, flowered stuffs that are faded, locks of hair that are lost,\nlove-letters that are pale. By which I don't mean that they are vague\nand spectral, for Mr. Abbey has in the highest degree the art of\nimparting life, and he gives it in particular to his well-made, blooming\nmaidens. They live in a world in which there is no question of their\npassing Harvard or other examinations, but they stand very firmly on\ntheir quaintly-shod feet. They are exhaustively \"felt,\" and eminently\nqualified to attract the opposite sex, which is not the case with\nghosts, who, moreover, do not wear the most palpable petticoats of\nquilted satin, nor sport the most delicate fans, nor take generally the\nmost ingratiating attitudes.\n\n[Illustration: The old house]\n\nThe best work that Mr. Abbey has done is to be found in the succession\nof illustrations to \"She Stoops to Conquer;\" here we see his happiest\ncharacteristics and--till he does something still more brilliant--may\ntake his full measure. No work in black and white in our time has been\nmore truly artistic, and certainly no success more unqualified. The\nartist has given us an evocation of a social state to its smallest\ndetails, and done it with an unsurpassable lightness of touch. The\nproblem was in itself delightful--the accidents and incidents (granted a\nsituation _de com\u00c3\u00a9die_) of an old, rambling, wainscoted, out-of-the-way\nEnglish country-house, in the age of Goldsmith. Here Mr. Abbey is in\nhis element--given up equally to unerring observation and still more\ninfallible divination. The whole place, and the figures that come and\ngo in it, live again, with their individual look, their peculiarities,\ntheir special signs and oddities. The spirit of the dramatist has passed\ncompletely into the artist's sense, but the spirit of the historian has\ndone so almost as much. Tony Lumpkin is, as we say nowadays, a document,\nand Miss Hardcastle embodies the results of research. Delightful are the\nhumor and quaintness and grace of all this, delightful the variety and\nthe richness of personal characterization, and delightful, above all,\nthe drawing. It is impossible to represent with such vividness unless,\nto begin with, one sees; and it is impossible to see unless one wants\nto very much, or unless, in other words, one has a great love. Mr. Abbey\nhas evidently the tenderest affection for just the old houses and the\nold things, the old faces and voices, the whole irrevocable human scene\nwhich the genial hand of Goldsmith has passed over to him, and there\nis no inquiry about them that he is not in a position to answer. He is\nintimate with the buttons of coats and the buckles of shoes: he knows\nnot only exactly what his people wore, but exactly how they wore it,\nand how they felt when they had it on. He has sat on the old chairs and\nsofas, and rubbed against the old wainscots, and leaned over the old\nbalusters. He knows every mended place in Tony Lumpkin's stockings, and\nexactly how that ingenuous youth leaned back on the spinet, with his\nthick, familiar thumb out, when he presented his inimitable countenance,\nwith a grin, to Mr. Hastings, after he had set his fond mother\na-whimpering. (There is nothing in the whole series, by-the-way,\nbetter indicated than the exquisitely simple, half-bumpkin, half-vulgar\nexpression of Tony's countenance and smile in this scene, unless it be\nthe charming arch yet modest face of Miss Hardcastle, lighted by the\ncandle she carries, as, still holding the door by which she comes in,\nshe is challenged by young Mar-low to relieve his bewilderment as to\nwhere he really is and what _she_ really is.) In short, if we have all\nseen \"She Stoops to Conquer\" acted, Mr. Abbey has had the better fortune\nof seeing it off the stage; and it is noticeable how happily he has\nsteered clear of the danger of making his people theatrical types--mere\nmasqueraders and wearers of properties. This is especially the case with\nhis women, who have not a hint of the conventional paint and patches,\nsimpering with their hands in the pockets of aprons, but are taken from\nthe same originals from which Goldsmith took them.\n\nIf it be asked on the occasion of this limited sketch of Mr. Abbey's\npowers where, after all, he did learn to draw so perfectly, I know no\nanswer but to say that he learned it in the school in which he learned\nalso to paint (as he has been doing in these latest years, rather\ntentatively at first, but with greater and greater success)--the school\nof his own personal observation. His drawing is the drawing of direct,\nimmediate, solicitous study of the particular case, without tricks or\naffectations or any sort of cheap subterfuge, and nothing can exceed the\ncharm of its delicacy, accuracy and elegance, its variety and freedom,\nits clear, frank solution of difficulties. If for the artist it be the\nfoundation of every joy to know exactly what he wants (as I hold it\nis indeed), Mr. Abbey is, to all appearance, to be constantly\ncongratulated. And I apprehend that he would not deny that it is a\ngood-fortune for him to have been able to arrange his life so that his\neye encounters in abundance the particular cases of which I speak. Two\nor three years ago, at the Institute of Painters in Water-colors, in\nLondon, he exhibited an exquisite picture of a peaceful old couple\nsitting in the corner of a low, quiet, ancient room, in the waning\nafternoon, and listening to their daughter as she stands up in the\nmiddle and plays the harp to them. They are Darby and Joan, with all the\npoetry preserved; they sit hand in hand, with bent, approving heads, and\nthe deep recess of the window looking into the garden (where we may be\nsure there are yew-trees clipped into the shape of birds and beasts),\nthe panelled room, the quaintness of the fireside, the old-time\nprovincial expression of the scene, all belong to the class of effects\nwhich Mr. Abbey understands supremely well. So does the great russet\nwall and high-pitched mottled roof of the rural almshouse which figures\nin the admirable water-color picture that he exhibited last spring. A\ngroup of remarkably pretty countrywomen have been arrested in front of\nit by the passage of a young soldier--a raw recruit in scarlet tunic and\nwhite ducks, somewhat prematurely conscious of military glory. He gives\nthem the benefit of the goose-step as he goes; he throws back his head\nand distends his fingers, presenting to the ladies a back expressive of\nmore consciousness of his fine figure than of the lovely mirth that the\nartist has depicted in their faces. Lovely is their mirth indeed, and\nlovely are they altogether. Mr. Abbey has produced nothing more charming\nthan this bright knot of handsome, tittering daughters of burghers,\nin their primeval pelisses and sprigged frocks. I have, however, left\nmyself no space to go into the question of his prospective honors as a\npainter, to which everything now appears to point, and I have mentioned\nthe two pictures last exhibited mainly because they illustrate the happy\nopportunities with which he has been able to surround himself. The sweet\nold corners he appreciates, the russet walls of moss-grown charities,\nthe lowbrowed nooks of manor, cottage and parsonage, the fresh\ncomplexions that flourish in green, pastoral countries where it rains\nnot a little--every item in this line that seems conscious of its\npictorial use appeals to Mr. Abbey not in vain. He might have been a\ngrandson of Washington Irving, which is a proof of what I have already\nsaid, that none of the young American workers in the same field have so\nlittle as he of that imperfectly assimilated foreignness of suggestion\nwhich is sometimes regarded as the strength, but which is also in some\ndegree the weakness, of the pictorial effort of the United States. His\nexecution is as sure of itself as if it rested upon infinite Parisian\ninitiation, but his feeling can best be described by saying that it is\nthat of our own dear mother-tongue. If the writer speaks when he writes,\nand the draughtsman speaks when he draws. Mr. Abbey, in expressing\nhimself with his pencil, certainly speaks pure English, He reminds us\nto a certain extent of Meissonier, especially the Meissonier of the\nillustrations to that charming little volume of the _Conies R\u00c3\u00a9mois_,\nand the comparison is highly to his advantage in the matter of freedom,\nvariety, ability to represent movement (Meissonier's figures are\nstock-still), and facial expression--above all, in the handling of\nthe female personage, so rarely attempted by the French artist. But he\ndiffers from the latter signally in the fact that though he shares his\nsympathy as to period and costume, his people are of another race and\ntradition, and move in a world locally altogether different. Mr. Abbey\nis still young, he is full of ideas and intentions, and the work he\nhas done may, in view of his time of life, of his opportunities and the\nsingular completeness of his talent, be regarded really as a kind of\nforetaste and prelude. It can hardly fail that he will do better things\nstill, when everything is so favorable. Life itself is his subject, and\nthat is always at his door. The only obstacle, therefore, that can be\nimagined in Mr. Abbey's future career is a possible embarrassment as\nto what to choose. He has hitherto chosen so well, however, that this\nobstacle will probably not be insuperable.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHARLES S. REINHART\n\nWe Americans are accused of making too much ado about our celebrities,\nof being demonstratively conscious of each step that we take in the path\nof progress; and the accusation has its ground doubtless in this\nsense, that it is possible among us to-day to become a celebrity on\nunprecedentedly easy terms. This, however, at the present hour is the\ncase all the world over, and it is difficult to see where the standard\nof just renown remains so high that the first stone may be cast. It is\nmore and more striking that the machinery of publicity is so enormous,\nso constantly growing and so obviously destined to make the globe small,\nin relation of the objects, famous or obscure, which cover it, that\nit procures for the smallest facts and the most casual figures a\nreverberation to be expected only in the case of a world-conqueror. The\nnewspaper and the telegram constitute a huge sounding-board, which has,\nevery day and every hour, to be made to vibrate, to be fed with items,\nand the diffusion of the items takes place on a scale out of any sort of\nproportion to their intrinsic importance. The crackle of common things\nis transmuted into thunder--a thunder perhaps more resounding in America\nthan elsewhere for the reason that the sheet of tin shaken by the\nJupiter of the Press has been cut larger. But the difference is only of\ndegree, not of kind; and if the system we in particular have brought\nto perfection would seem to be properly applied only to Alexanders\nand Napoleons, it is not striking that these adequate subjects present\nthemselves even in other countries. The end of it all surely no man can\nsee, unless it be that collective humanity is destined to perish from a\nrupture of its tympanum. That is a theme for a later hour, and meanwhile\nperhaps it is well not to be too frightened. Some of the items I just\nspoke of are, after all, larger than others; and if, as a general thing,\nit is a mistake to pull up our reputations to see how they are growing,\nthere are some so well grown that they will bear it, and others of\na hardy stock even while they are tender. We may feel, for instance,\ncomparatively little hesitation in extending an importunate hand towards\nthe fine young sapling of which Mr. Reinhart is one of the branches.\nIt is a plant of promise, which has already flowered profusely and the\nfragrance of which it would be affectation not to to notice. Let us\nnotice it, then, with candor, for it has all the air of being destined\nto make the future sweeter. The plant in question is of course simply\nthe art of illustration in black and white, to which American periodical\nliterature has, lately given such an impetus and which has returned\nthe good office by conferring a great distinction on our magazines. In\nits new phase the undertaking has succeeded; and it is not always that\nfortune descends upon so deserving a head. Two or three fine talents in\nparticular have helped it to succeed, and Mr. Reinhart is not the least\nconspicuous of these. It would be idle for a writer in Harper to\npretend to any diffidence of appreciation of his work: for the pages\nare studded, from many years back, with the record of his ability. Mr.\nRein-hart took his first steps and made his first hits in Harper, which\nowes him properly a portrait in return for so much portraiture. I may\nexaggerate the charm and the importance of the modern illustrative form,\nmay see in it a capacity of which it is not yet itself wholly conscious,\nbut if I do so Mr. Reinhart is partly responsible for the aberration.\nAbundant, intelligent, interpretative work in black and white is, to the\nsense of the writer of these lines, one of the pleasantest things of the\ntime, having only to rise to the occasion to enjoy a great future.\nThis idea, I confess, is such as to lead one to write not only\nsympathetically but pleadingly about the artists to whom one looks for\nconfirmation of it. If at the same time as we commemorate what they have\ndone we succeed in enlarging a little the conception of what they\nmay yet do, we shall be repaid even for having exposed ourselves as\nfanatics--fanatics of the general manner, I mean, not of particular\nrepresentatives of it.\n\nMay not this fanaticism, in a particular case, rest upon a sense of\nthe resemblance between the general chance, as it may be called, of the\ndraughtsman in black and white, with contemporary life for his theme,\nand the opportunity upon which the literary artist brings another form\nto bear? The forms are different, though with analogies; but the field\nis the same--the immense field of contemporary life observed for an\nartistic purpose. There is nothing so interesting as that, because it is\nourselves; and no artistic problem is so charming as to arrive, either\nin a literary or a plastic form, at a close and direct notation of what\nwe observe. If one has attempted some such exploit in a literary form,\none cannot help having a sense of union and comradeship with those who\nhave approached the question with the other instrument. This will be\nespecially the case if we happen to have appreciated that instrument\neven to envy. We may as well say it outright, we envy it quite\nunspeakably in the hands of Mr. Reinhart and in those of Mr. Abbey.\nThere is almost no limit to the service to which we can imagine it to be\napplied, and we find ourselves wishing that these gentlemen may be made\nadequately conscious of all the advantages it represents. We wonder\nwhether they really _are_ so; we are disposed even to assume that they\nare not, in order to join the moral, to insist on the lesson. The master\nwhom we have mentally in view Mr. Reinhart is a near approach to him\nmay be, if he will only completely know it, so prompt, so copious,\nso universal--so \"all there,\" as we say nowadays, and indeed so all\neverywhere. There is only too much to see, too much to do, and his\nprocess is the one that comes nearest to minimizing the quantity. He can\ntouch so many things, he can go from one scene to another, he can sound\na whole concert of notes while the painter is setting up his easel. The\npainter is majestic, dignified, academic, important, superior, anything\nyou will; but he is, in the very nature of the case, only occasional.\nHe is \"serious,\" but he is comparatively clumsy: he is a terrible time\ngetting under way, and he has to sacrifice so many subjects while he is\ndoing one. The illustrator makes one immense sacrifice, of course--that\nof color; but with it he purchases a freedom which enables him to attack\never so many ideas. It is by variety and numerosity that he commends\nhimself to his age, and it is for these qualities that his age commends\nhim to the next. The twentieth century, the latter half of it, will, no\ndoubt, have its troubles, but it will have a great compensatory luxury,\nthat of seeing the life of a hundred years before much more vividly than\nwe--even happy we--see the life of a hundred years ago. But for this\nour illustrators must do their best, appreciate the endless capacity\nof their form. It is to the big picture what the short story is to the\nnovel.\n\nIt is doubtless too much, I hasten to add, to ask Mr. Reinhart, for\ninstance, to work to please the twentieth century. The end will not\nmatter if he pursues his present very prosperous course of activity,\nfor it is assuredly the fruitful vein, the one I express the hope to\nsee predominant, the portrayal of the manners, types and aspects that\nsurround us. Mr. Reinhart has reached that happy period of life when\na worker is in full possession of his means, when he has done for his\nchosen instrument everything he can do in the way of forming it and\nrendering it complete and flexible, and has the fore only to apply\nit with freedom, confidence and success. These, to our sense, are the\ngolden hours of an artist's life; happier even than the younger time\nwhen the future seemed infinite in the light of the first rays of\nglory, the first palpable hits. The very sense that the future is\n_not_ unlimited and that opportunity is at its high-water-mark gives\nan intensity to the enjoyment of maturity. Then the acquired habit\nof \"knowing how\" must simplify the problem of execution and leave the\nartist free to think only of his purpose, as befits a real creator. Mr.\nReinhart is at the enviable stage of knowing in perfection how; he has\narrived at absolute facility and felicity. The machine goes of itself;\nit is no longer necessary to keep lifting the cover and pouring in the\noil of fond encouragement: all the attention may go to the idea and the\nsubject. It may, however, remain very interesting to others to know how\nthe faculty was trained, the pipe was tuned. The early phases of such\na process have a relative importance even when, at the lime (so gradual\nare many beginnings and so obscure man a morrow) they may have appeared\nneither delightful nor profitable. They are almost always to be summed\nup in the single precious word practice. This word represents, at any\nrate, Mr. Reinhart's youthful history, and the profusion in which,\nthough no doubt occasionally disguised, the boon was supplied to him in\nthe offices of Harper's Magazine. There is nothing so innate that it\nhas not also to be learned, for the best part of any aptitude is the\ncapacity to increase it.\n\nMr. Reinhart's experience began to accumulate very early, for at\nPittsburgh, where he was born, he was free to draw to his heart's\ncontent. There was no romantic attempt, as I gather, to nip him in the\nbud. On the contrary, he was despatched with almost prosaic punctuality\nto Europe, and was even encouraged to make himself at home in Munich.\nMunich, in his case, was a _pis-aller_ for Paris, where it would have\nbeen his preference to study when he definitely surrendered, as it\nwere, to his symptoms. He went to Paris, but Paris seemed blocked and\ncomplicated, and Munich presented advantages which, if not greater, were\nat least easier to approach. Mr. Reinhart passe through the mill of the\nBavarian school, and when it had turned him out with its characteristic\npolish he came back to America with a very substantial stock to dispose\nof. It would take a chapter by itself if we were writing a biography,\nthis now very usual episode of the return of the young American from the\nforeign conditions in which he has learned his professional language,\nand his position in face of the community that he addresses in a strange\nidiom. There has to be a prompt adjustment between ear and voice, if the\ninterlocutor is not to seem to himself to be intoning in the void. There\nis always an inner history in all this, as well as an outer one--such,\nhowever, as it would take much space to relate. Mr. Reinhart's more\nor less alienated accent fell, by good-fortune, on a comprehending\nlistener. He had made a satirical drawing, in the nature of the\n\"cartoon\" of a comic journal, on a subject of the hour, and addressed it\nto the editor of _Harper's Weekly_. The drawing was not published--the\nsatire was perhaps not exactly on the right note--but the draughtsman\nwas introduced. Thus began, by return of post, as it were, and with\npreliminaries so few that they could not well have been less, a\nconnection of many years. If I were writing a biography another chapter\nwould come in here--a curious, almost a pathetic one; for the course\nof things is so rapid in this country that the years of Mr. Reinhart's\napprenticeship to pictorial journalism, positively recent as they are,\nalready are almost prehistoric. To-morrow, at least, the complexion of\nthat time, its processes, ideas and standards, together with some of\nthe unsophisticated who carried them out, will belong to old New York.\nA certain mollifying dimness rests upon them now, and their superseded\nbrilliancy gleams through it but faintly. It is a lively span for Mr.\nReinhart to have been at once one of the unsophisticated and one of the\nactually modern.\n\nThat portion of his very copious work to which, more particularly. I\napply the latter term, has been done for Harper's Magazine. During these\nlatter years it has come, like so much of American work to-day, from\nbeyond the seas. Whether or not that foreign language of which I just\nspoke never became, in New York, for this especial possessor of it, a\ncompletely convenient medium of conversation, is more than I can say;\nat any rate Mr. Reinhart eventually reverted to Europe and settled in\nParis. Paris had seemed rather inhospitable to him in his youth, but he\nhas now fitted his key to the lock. It would be satisfactory to be\nable to express scientifically the reasons why, as a general thing, the\nAmerican artist, as well as his congener of many another land, carries\non his function with less sense of resistance in that city than\nelsewhere. He likes Paris best, but that is not scientific. The\ndifference is that though theoretically the production of pictures is\nrecognized in America and in England, in Paris it is recognized both\ntheoretically and practically. And I do not mean by this simply that\npictures are bought--for they are not, predominantly, as it happens--but\nthat they are more presupposed. The plastic is implied in the French\nconception of things, and the studio is as natural a consequence of it\nas the post-office is of letter-writing. Vivid representation is the\ngenius of the French language and the need of the French mind. The\npeople have invented more aids to it than any other, and as these aids\nmake up a large part of the artist's life, he feels his best home to be\nin the place where he finds them most. He may begin to quarrel with that\nhome on the day a complication is introduced by the question of _what_\nhe shall represent--a totally different consideration from that of\nthe method; but for Mr. Reinhart this question has not yet offered\ninsoluble difficulties. He represents everything--he has accepted so\ngeneral an order. So long as his countrymen flock to Paris and pass in\na homogeneous procession before his eyes, there is not the smallest\ndifficulty in representing _them_. When the case requires that they\nshall be taken in connection with their native circumstances and seen in\ntheir ambient air, he is prepared to come home and give several months\nto the task, as on the occasion of Mr. Dudley Warner's history of a tour\namong the watering-places, to which he furnished so rich and so curious\na pictorial accompaniment. Sketch-book in hand, he betakes himself,\naccording to need, to Germany, to England, to Italy, to Spain. The\nreaders of Harper will have forgotten his admirable pictorial notes on\nthe political world at Berlin, so rich and close in characterization.\nTo the _Spanish Vistas_ of Mr. G. P. Lathrop he contributed innumerable\ndesigns, delightful notes of an artist's quest of the sketchable, many\nof which are singularly full pictures. The \"Soldiers Playing Dominoes\"\nat a caf\u00c3\u00a9 is a powerful page of life. Mr. Reinhart has, of course,\ninterpreted many a fictive scene--he has been repeatedly called upon\nto make the novel and the story visible. This he energetically and\npatiently does; though of course we are unable to say whether the men\nand women he makes us see are the very people whom the authors have\nseen. That is a thing that, in any case, one will never know; besides,\nthe authors who don't see vaguely are apt to see perversely. The\nstory-teller has, at any rate, the comfort with Mr. Reinhart that his\ndrawings are constructive and have the air of the actual. He likes to\nrepresent character--he rejoices in the specifying touch.\n\nThe evidence of this is to be found also in his pictures, for I ought\nalready to have mentioned that, for these many years (they are beginning\nto be many), he has indulged in the luxury of color. It is not probable\nthat he regards himself in the first place as an illustrator, in the\nsense to which the term is usually restricted. He is a very vigorous and\nvarious painter, and at the Salon a constant and conspicuous exhibitor.\nHe is fond of experiments, difficulties and dangers, and I divine that\nit would be his preference to be known best by his painting, in which he\nhandles landscape with equal veracity. It is a pity that the critic\nis unable to contend with him on such a point without appearing to\nunderestimate that work. Mr. Reinhart has so much to show for his\npreference that I am conscious of its taking some assurance to say that\nI am not sure he is right. This would be the case even if he had nothing\nelse to show than the admirable picture entitled \"Washed Ashore\"\n(\"Un Epave \") which made such an impression in the Salon of 1887. It\nrepresents the dead body of an unknown man whom the tide has cast up,\nlying on his back, feet forward, disfigured, dishonored by the sea. A\nsmall group of villagers are collected near it, divided by the desire\nto look and the fear to see. A gendarme, official and responsible, his\nuniform contrasting with the mortal disrepair of the victim, takes down\nin his note-book the _proc\u00c3\u00a8s-verbal_ of the incident, and an old sailor,\npointing away with a stiffened arm, gives him the benefit of what _he_\nknows about the matter. Plain, pitying, fish-wives, hushed, with\ntheir shawls in their mouths, hang back, as if from a combination too\nsolemn--the mixture of death and the law. Three or four men seem to be\nglad it isn't they. The thing is a masterpiece of direct representation,\nand has wonderfully the air of something seen, found without being\nlooked for. Excellently composed but not artificial, deeply touching but\nnot sentimental, large, close and sober, this important work gives the\nfull measure of Mr. Reinhart's great talent and constitutes a kind of\npledge. It may be perverse on my part to see in it the big banknote,\nas it were, which may be changed into a multitude of gold and silver\npieces. I cannot, however, help doing so. \"Washed Ashore\" is painted\nas only a painter paints, but I irreverently translate it into its\nequivalent in \"illustrations\"--half a hundred little examples, in\nblack and white, of the same sort of observation. For this observation,\nimmediate, familiar, sympathetic, human, and not involving a quest of\nstyle for which color is really indispensable, is a mistress at whose\nservice there is no derogation in placing one's self. To do little\nthings instead of big _may_ be a derogation; a great deal will depend\nupon the way the little things are done. Besides, no work of art is\nabsolutely little. I grow bold and even impertinent as I think of the\nway Mr. Rein-hart might scatter the smaller coin. At any rate, whatever\nproportion his work in this line may bear to the rest, it is to be hoped\nthat nothing will prevent him from turning out more and more to play\nthe rare faculty that produces it. His studies of American _moeurs_ in\nassociation with Mr. Warner went so far on the right road that we\nwould fain see him make all the rest of the journey. They made us ask\nstraightway for more, and were full of intimations of what was behind.\nThey showed what there is to see--what there is to guess. Let him carry\nthe same inquiry further, let him carry it all the way. It would be\nserious work and would abound in reality; it would help us, as it were,\nto know what we are talking about. In saying this I feel how much I\nconfirm the great claims I just made for the revival of illustration.\n\n\n\n\nALFRED PARSONS\n\nIt would perhaps be extravagant to pretend, in this embarrassed age,\nthat Merry England is still intact; but it would be strange if the\nwords \"happy England\" should not rise to the lips of the observer of Mr.\nAlfred Parsons' numerous and delightful studies of the gardens, great\nand small, of his country. They surely have a representative value in\nmore than the literal sense, and might easily minister to the quietest\ncomplacency of patriotism. People whose criticism is imaginative will\nsee in them a kind of compendium of what, in home things, is at once\nmost typical and most enviable; and, going further, they will almost\nwish that such a collection might be carried by slow stages round the\nglobe, to kindle pangs in the absent and passions in the alien. As\nit happens to be a globe the English race has largely peopled, we can\nmeasure the amount of homesickness that would be engendered on the\nway. In fact, one doubts whether the sufferer would even need to be of\nEnglish strain to attach the vision of home to the essentially lovable\nplaces that Mr. Parsons depicts. They seem to generalize and typify\nthe idea, so that every one may feel, in every case, that he has a\nsentimental property in the scene. The very sweetness of its reality\nonly helps to give it that story-book quality which persuades us we have\nknown it in youth.\n\nAnd yet such scenes may well have been constructed for the despair of\nthe Colonial; for they remind us, at every glance, of that perfection to\nwhich there is no short cut--not even \"unexampled prosperity \"--and\nto which time is the only guide. Mr. Parsons' pictures speak of many\ncomplicated things, but (in what they tell us of his subjects) they\nspeak most of duration. Such happy nooks have grown slowly, such\nfortunate corners have had a history; and their fortune has been\nprecisely that they have had time to have it comfortably, have not been\nobliged to try for character without it.\n\nCharacter is their strong point and the most expensive of all\ningredients. Mr. Parsons' portraiture seizes every shade of it, seizes\nit with unfailing sympathy. He is doubtless clever enough to paint\nrawness when he must, but he has an irrepressible sense of ripeness.\nHalf the ripeness of England--half the religion, one might almost\nsay--is in its gardens; they are truly pious foundations. It is\ndoubtless because there are so many of them that the country seems so\nfinished, and the sort of care they demand is an intenser deliberation,\nwhich passes into the national temper. One must have lived in other\nlands to observe fully how large a proportion of this one is walled in\nfor growing flowers. The English love of flowers is inveterate; it\nis the most, unanimous protest against the grayness of some of the\nconditions, and it should receive justice from those who accuse the race\nof taking its pleasure too sadly. A good garden is an organized revel,\nand there is no country in which there are so many.\n\nMr. Parsons had therefore only to choose, at his leisure, and one might\nheartily have envied him the process, scarcely knowing which to prefer\nof all the pleasant pilgrimages that would make up such a quest. He had.\nfortunately, the knowledge which could easily lead to more, and a career\nof discovery behind him. He knew the right times for the right things,\nand the right things for the right places. He had innumerable memories\nand associations; he had painted up and down the land and looked over\nmany walls. He had followed the bounty of the year from month to month\nand from one profusion to another. To follow it with him, in this\nadmirable series, is to see that he is master of the subject. There\nwill be no lack of confidence on the part of those who have already\nperceived, in much of Mr. Parsons' work, a supreme illustration of all\nthat is widely nature-loving in the English interest in the flower.\nNo sweeter submission to mastery can be imagined than the way the\ndaffodils, under his brush (to begin at the beginning), break out\ninto early April in the lovely drawings of Stourhead. One of the most\ncharming of these--a corner of an old tumbled-up place in Wiltshire,\nwhere many things have come and gone--represents that moment of\ntransition in which contrast is so vivid as to make it more dramatic\nthan many plays--the very youngest throb of spring, with the brown slope\nof the foreground coming back to consciousness in pale lemon-colored\npatches and, on the top of the hill, against the still cold sky, the\nequally delicate forms of the wintry trees. By the time these forms\nhave thickened, the expanses of daffodil will have become a mass\nof bluebells. All the daffodil pictures have a rare loveliness, but\nespecially those that deal also with the earlier fruit-blossom, the\nyoung plum-trees in Berkshire orchards. Here the air is faintly pink,\nand the painter makes us feel the little _blow_ in the thin blue sky.\nThe spring, fortunately, is everybody's property and, in the language of\nall the arts, the easiest word to conjure with. It is therefore partly\nMr. Parsons' good-luck that we enjoy so his rendering of these phases;\nbut on the other hand we look twice when it's a case of meddling with\nthe exquisite, and if he inspires us with respect it is because we feel\nthat he has been deeply initiated. No one knows better the friendly\nreasons for our stopping, when chatting natives pronounce the weather\n\"foine,\" at charming casual corners of old villages, where grassy ways\ncross each other and timbered houses bulge irregularly and there are\nfresh things behind crooked palings; witness the little vision of\nBlewbury, in Berkshire, reputedly of ancient British origin, with a\nroad all round it and only footways within. No one, in the Herefordshire\norchards, masses the white cow-parsley in such profusion under the\napple blossoms; or makes the whitewashed little damson-trees look so\ninnocently responsible and charming on the edge of the brook over which\nthe planks are laid for the hens. Delightful, in this picture, is the\nsense of the clean spring day, after rain, with the blue of the sky\nwashed faint. Delightful is the biggish view (one of the less numerous\noil-pictures) of the Somersetshire garden, where that peculiarly English\nlook of the open-air room is produced by the stretched carpet of the\nturf and the firm cushions of the hedges, and a pair of proprietors,\nperhaps happier than they know, are putting in an afternoon among their\ntulips, under the flushed apple-trees whose stems are so thin and whose\nbrims so heavy. Are the absorbed couple, at any rate, aware of the\nsurprising degree to which the clustered ruddy roofs of the next small\ntown, over the hedge, off at the left, may remind the fanciful\nspectator of the way he has seen little dim Italian cities look on their\nhill-tops? The whole thing, in this subject, has the particular English\nnote to which Mr. Parsons repeatedly testifies, the nook quality, the\nair of a land and a life so infinitely subdivided that they produce\na thousand pleasant privacies. The painter moves with the months and\nfinds, after the earliest things, the great bed of pansies in the angle\nof the old garden at Sutton, in which, for felicity of position and\nperfect pictorial service rendered--to say nothing of its polygonal,\npyramidal roof--the ancient tool-house, or tea-house, is especially to\nbe commended. Very far descended is such a corner as this, very full of\nreference to vanished combinations and uses; and the artist communicates\nto us a feeling for it that makes us wish disinterstedly it may be still\nas long preserved.\n\nHe finds in June, at Blackdown, the blaze of the yellow azalea-bush, or\nin another spot the strong pink of the rhododendron, beneath the silver\nfirs that deepen the blue of the sky. He finds the Vicarage Walk, at\nKing's Langley, a smother of old-fashioned flowers--a midsummer vista\nfor the figures of a happy lady and a lucky dog. He finds the delicious\nhuddle of the gabled, pigeon-haunted roof of a certain brown old\nbuilding at Frame, with poppies and gladiolus and hollyhock crowding the\nbeautiful foreground. He finds--apparently in the same place--the tangle\nof the hardy flowers that come while the roses are still in bloom, with\nthe tall blue larkspurs standing high among them. He finds the lilies,\nwhite and red, at Broadway, and the poppies, which have dropped most of\ntheir petals--apparently to let the roses, which are just coming out,\ngive _their_ grand party. Their humility is rewarded by the artist's\nadmirable touch in the little bare poppy-heads that nod on their\nflexible pins.\n\nBut I cannot go on to say everything that such a seeker, such a\ndiscoverer, as Mr. Parsons finds--the less that the purpose of these\nlimited remarks is to hint at our own _trouvailles_. A view of the\nfield, at any rate, would be incomplete without such specimens as the\nthree charming oil-pictures which commemorate Holme Lacey. There are\ngardens and gardens, and these represent the sort that are always spoken\nof in the plural and most arrogate the title. They form, in England, a\nmagnificent collection, and if they abound in a quiet assumption of the\ngrand style it must be owned that they frequently achieve it. There are\npeople to be found who enjoy them, and it is not, at any rate, when Mr.\nParsons deals with them that we have an opening for strictures. As\nwe look at the blaze of full summer in the brilliantly conventional\nparterres we easily credit the tale of the 40,000 plants it takes to\nfill the beds. More than this, we like the long paths of turf that\nstretch between splendid borders, recalling the frescoed galleries of a\npalace; we like the immense hedges, whose tops are high against the sky.\nWhile we are liking, we like perhaps still better, since they deal with\na very different order, the two water-colors from the dear little garden\nat Winchelsea--especially the one in which the lady takes he ease in her\nhammock (on a sociable, shady terrace, from which the ground drops),\nand looks at red Rye, across the marshes. Another garden where a\ncontemplative hammock would be in order is the lovely canonical plot\nat Salisbury, with the everlasting spire above it tinted in the summer\nsky--unless, in the same place, you should choose to hook yourself up by\nthe grassy bank of the Avon, at the end of the lawn, with the meadows,\nthe cattle, the distant willows across the river, to look at.\n\nThree admirable water-colors are devoted by Mr. Parsons to the\nperceptible dignity of Gravetye, in Sussex, the dignity of very serious\ngardens, entitled to ceremonious consideration, Few things in England\ncan show a greater wealth of bloom than the wide flowery terrace\nimmediately beneath the gray, gabled house, where tens of thousands of\ntea-roses, in predominant possession, have, in one direction, a mass\nof high yews for a background. They divide their province with the\ncarnations and pansies: a wilder ness of tender petals ignorant of\nanything rougher than the neighborhood of the big unchanged medley of\ntall yuccas and saxifrage, with miscellaneous filling-in, in the picture\nwhich presents the charming house in profile. The artist shows us later,\nin September, at Gravetye, the pale violet multitude of the Michaelmas\ndaisies; another I great bunch, or bank, of which half masks and greatly\nbeautifies the rather bare yellow cottage at Broadway. This brings us on\nto the autumn, if I count as autumnal the admirable large water-color of\na part of a garden at Shiplake, with the second bloom of the roses and\na glimpse of a turn of the Thames. This exquisite picture expresses to\nperfection the beginning of the languor of the completed season--with\nits look of warm rest, of doing nothing, in the cloudless sky. To the\nsame or a later moment belongs the straight walk at Fladbury--the old\nrectory garden by the Avon, with its Irish yews and the red lady in her\nchair; also the charming water-color of young, slim apple-trees, full of\nfruit (this must be October), beneath an admirable blue and white sky.\nStill later comes the big pear-tree that has turned, among barer boughs,\nto flame-color, and, in another picture, the very pale russet of\nthe thinned cherry-trees, standing, beneath a grayish sky, above a\nforeshortened slope. Last of all we have, in oils, December and a hard\nfrost in a bare apple-orchard, indented with a deep gully which makes\nthe place somehow a subject and which, in fact, three or four years\nago, made it one for a larger picture by Mr. Parsons, full of truth and\nstyle.\n\nThis completes his charming story of the life of the English year, told\nin a way that convinces us of his intimate acquaintance with it. Half\nthe interest of Mr. Parsons' work is in the fact that he paints from a\nfull mind and from a store of assimilated knowledge. In every touch of\nnature that he communicates to us we feel something of the thrill of the\nwhole--we feel the innumerable relations, the possible variations of the\nparticular objects. This makes his manner serious and masculine--rescues\nit from the thinness of tricks and the coquetries of _chic_. We walk\nwith him on a firm earth, we taste the tone of the air and seem to take\nnature and the climate and all the complicated conditions by their big\ngeneral hand. The painter's manner, in short, is one with the study of\nthings--his talent is a part of their truth. In this happy series\nwe seem to see still more how that talent was formed, how his rich\nmotherland has been, from the earliest observation, its nurse and\ninspirer. He gives back to her all the good she has done him.\n\n\n\n\nJOHN S. SARGENT\n\nI was on the point of beginning this sketch of the work of an artist to\nwhom distinction has come very early in life by saying, in regard to the\ndegree to which the subject of it enjoys the attention of the public,\nthat no American painter has hitherto won himself such recognition from\nthe expert; but I find myself pausing at the start as on the edge of a\npossible solecism. Is Mr. Sargent in very fact an American painter?\nThe proper answer to such a question is doubtless that we shall be well\nadvised to pretend it, and the reason of this is simply that we have\nan excellent opportunity. Born in Europe, he has also spent his life in\nEurope, but none the less the burden of proof would rest with those who\nshould undertake to show that he is a European. Moreover he has even\non the face of it this great symptom of an American origin, that in the\nline of his art he might easily be mistaken for a Frenchman. It sounds\nlike a paradox, but it is a very simple truth, that when to-day we look\nfor \"American art\" we find it mainly in Paris. When we find it out of\nParis, we at least find a great deal of Paris in it. Mr. Sargent came up\nto the irresistible city in his twentieth year, from Florence, where in\n1856 he had been born of American parents and where his fortunate youth\nhad been spent. He entered immediately the studio of Caro-lus Duran, and\nrevealed himself in 1877, at the age of twenty-two, in the portrait of\nthat master---a fine model in more than one sense of the word. He was\nalready in possession of a style; and if this style has gained both\nin finish and in assurance, it has not otherwise varied. As he saw and\n\"rendered\" ten years ago, so he sees and renders to-day; and I may add\nthat there is no present symptom of his passing into another manner.\n\nThose who have appreciated his work most up to the present time\narticulate no wish for a change, so completely does that work seem to\nthem, in its kind, the exact translation of his thought, the exact \"fit\"\nof his artistic temperament. It is difficult to imagine a young painter\nless in the dark about his own ideal, more lucid and more responsible\nfrom the first about what he desires. In an altogether exceptional\ndegree does he give us the sense that the intention and the art of\ncarrying it out are for him one and the same thing. In the brilliant\nportrait of Carolus Duran, which he was speedily and strikingly to\nsurpass, he gave almost the full measure of this admirable peculiarity,\nthat perception with him is already by itself a kind of execution. It\nis likewise so, of course, with many another genuine painter; but in\nSargent's case the process by which the object seen resolves itself into\nthe object pictured is extraordinarily immediate. It is as if painting\nwere pure tact of vision, a simple manner of feeling.\n\nFrom the time of his first successes at the Salon he was hailed, I\nbelieve, as a recruit of high value to the camp of the Impressionists,\nand to-day he is for many people most conveniently pigeon-holed under\nthat head. It is not necessary to protest against the classification\nif this addition always be made to it, that Mr. Sargent's impressions\nhappen to be worthy of record. This is by no means inveterately the case\nwith those of the ingenuous artists who most rejoice in the title in\nquestion. To render the impression of an object may be a very fruitful\neffort, but it is not necessarily so; that will depend upon what, I\nwon't say the object, but the impression, may have been. The talents\nengaged in this school lie, not unjustly, as it seems to me under\nthe suspicion of seeking the solution of their problem exclusively in\nsimplification. If a painter works for other eyes as well as his own he\ncourts a certain danger in this direction--that of being arrested by the\ncry of the spectator: \"Ah! but excuse me; I myself take more impressions\nthan that\" We feel a synthesis not to be an injustice only when it is\nrich. Mr. Sargent simplifies, I think, but he simplifies with style, and\nhis impression is the finest form of his energy.\n\nHis work has been almost exclusively in portraiture, and it has been his\nfortune to paint more women than men; therefore he has had but a limited\nopportunity to reproduce that generalized grand air with which his view\nof certain figures of gentlemen invests the model, which is conspicuous\nin the portrait of Carolus Duran and of which his splendid \"Docteur\nPozzi,\" the distinguished Paris surgeon (a work not sent to the Salon),\nis an admirable example. In each of these cases the model has been of\na gallant pictorial type, one of the types which strike us as made\nfor portraiture (which is by no means the way of all), as especially\nappears, for instance, in the handsome hands and frilled wrists of M.\nCarolus, whose cane rests in his fine fingers as if it were the hilt\nof a rapier. The most brilliant of all Mr. Sargent's productions is the\nportrait of a young lady, the magnificent picture which he exhibited\nin 1881; and if it has mainly been his fortune since to commemorate the\nfair faces of women, there is no ground for surprise at this sort of\nsuccess on the part of one who had given so signal a proof of possessing\nthe secret of the particular aspect that the contemporary lady (of any\nperiod) likes to wear in the eyes of posterity. Painted when he was\nbut four-and-twenty years of age, the picture by which Mr. Sargent was\nrepresented at the Salon of 1881 is a performance which may well have\nmade any critic of imagination rather anxious about his future. In\ncommon with the superb group of the children of Mr. Edward Boit,\nexhibited two years later, it offers the slightly \"uncanny\" spectacle of\na talent which on the very threshold of its career has nothing more to\nlearn. It is not simply precocity in the guise of maturity--a phenomenon\nwe very often meet, which deceives us only for an hour; it is the\nfreshness of youth combined with the artistic experience, really\nfelt and assimilated, of generations. My admiration for this deeply\ndistinguished work is such that I am perhaps in danger of overstating\nits merits; but it is worth taking into account that to-day, after\nseveral years' acquaintance with them, these merits seem to me more and\nmore to justify enthusiasm. The picture has this sign of productions of\nthe first order, that its style clearly would save it if everything else\nshould change--our measure of its value of resemblance, its expression\nof character, the fashion of dress, the particular associations it\nevokes. It is not only a portrait, but a picture, and it arouses even\nin the profane spectator something of the painter's sense, the joy of\nengaging also, by sympathy, in the solution of the artistic problem.\nThere are works of which it is sometimes said that they are painters'\npictures (this description is apt to be intended invidiously), and the\nproduction of which I speak has the good-fortune at once to belong to\nthis class and to give the \"plain man\" the kind of pleasure that the\nplain man looks for.\n\nThe young lady, dressed in black satin, stands upright, with her right\nhand bent back, resting on her waist, while the other, with the arm\nsomewhat extended, offers to view a single white flower. The dress.\nstretched at the hips over a sort of hoop, and ornamented in front,\nwhere it opens on a velvet petticoat with large satin bows, has an\nold-fashioned air, as if it had been worn by some demure princess who\nmight have sat for Velasquez. The hair, of which the arrangement is odd\nand charming, is disposed in two or three large curls fastened at one\nside over the temple with a comb. Behind the figure is the vague faded\nsheen, exquisite in tone, of a silk curtain, light, undefined, and\nlosing itself at the bottom. The face is young, candid and peculiar. Out\nof these few elements the artist has constructed a picture which it is\nimpossible to forget, of which the most striking characteristic is\nits simplicity, and yet which overflows with perfection. Painted with\nextraordinary breadth and freedom, so that surface and texture are\ninterpreted by the lightest hand, it glows with life, character and\ndistinction, and strikes us as the most complete--with one exception\nperhaps--of the author's productions. I know not why this representation\nof a young girl in black, engaged in the casual gesture of holding up\na flower, should make so ineffaceable an impression and tempt one to\nbecome almost lyrical in its praise; but I remember that, encountering\nthe picture unexpectedly in New York a year or two after it had been\nexhibited in Paris, it seemed to me to have acquired an extraordinary\ngeneral value, to stand for more artistic truth than it would be easy to\nformulate. The language of painting, the tongue in which, exclusively,\nMr. Sargent expresses himself, is a medium into which a considerable\npart of the public, for the simple an excellent reason that they don't\nunderstand it, will doubtless always be reluctant and unable to follow\nhim.\n\nTwo years before he exhibited the young lady in black, in 1879, Mr.\nSargent had spent several months in Spain, and here, even more than he\nhad already been, the great Velasquez became the god of his idolatry.\nNo scenes are more delightful to the imagination than those in which\nwe figure youth and genius confronted with great examples, and if such\nmatters did not belong to the domain of private life we might entertain\nourselves with reconstructing the episode of the first visit to the\nmuseum of Madrid, the shrine of the painter of Philip IV., of a\nyoung Franco-American worshipper of the highest artistic sensibility,\nexpecting a supreme revelation and prepared to fall on his knees. It is\nevident that Mr. Sargent fell on his knees and that in this attitude he\npassed a considerable part of his sojourn in Spain. He is various and\nexperimental; if I am not mistaken, he sees each work that he produces\nin a light of its own, not turning off successive portraits according\nto some well-tried receipt which has proved useful in the case of their\npredecessors; nevertheless there is one idea that pervades them all, in\na different degree, and gives them a family resemblance--the idea that\nit would be inspiring to know just how Velasquez would have treated\nthe theme. We can fancy that on each occasion Mr. Sargent, as a\nsolemn preliminary, invokes him as a patron saint. This is not, in my\nintention, tantamount to saying that the large canvas representing the\ncontortions of a dancer in the lamp-lit room of a _posada_, which he\nexhibited on his return from Spain, strikes me as having come into the\nworld under the same star as those compositions of the great Spaniard\nwhich at Madrid alternate with his royal portraits. This singular work,\nwhich has found an appreciative home in Boston, has the stamp of\nan extraordinary energy and facility--of an actual scene, with its\naccidents and peculiarities caught, as distinguished from a composition\nwhere arrangement and invention have played their part. It looks like\nlife, but it looks also, to my view, rather like a perversion of life,\nand has the quality of an enormous \"note\" or memorandum, rather than of\na representation. A woman in a voluminous white silk dress and a black\nmantilla pirouettes in the middle of a dusky room, to the accompaniment\nof her own castanets and that of a row of men and women who sit in straw\nchairs against the whitewashed wall and thrum upon guitar and tambourine\nor lift other castanets into the air. She appears almost colossal, and\nthe twisted and inflated folds of her long dress increase her volume.\nShe simpers, in profile, with a long chin, while she slants back at a\ndangerous angle, and the lamplight (it proceeds from below, as if she\nwere on a big platform) makes a strange play in her large face. In the\nbackground the straight line of black-clad, black-hatted, white-shirted\nmusicians projects shadows against the wall, on which placards, guitars,\nand dirty finger-marks display themselves. The merit of this production\nis that the air of reality is given in it with remarkable breadth and\nboldness; its defect it is difficult to express save by saying that it\nmakes the spectator vaguely uneasy and even unhappy--an accident the\nmore to be regretted as a lithe, inspired female figure, given up to\nthe emotion of the dance, is not intrinsically a displeasing object.\n\"El Jaleo\" sins, in my opinion, in the direction of ugliness, and,\nindependently of the fact that the heroine is circling round incommoded\nby her petticoats, has a want of serenity.\n\nThis is not the defect of the charming, dusky, white-robed person who,\nin the Tangerine subject exhibited at the Salon of 1880 (the fruit of\nan excursion to the African coast at the time of the artist's visit to\nSpain), stands on a rug, under a great white Moorish arch, and from out\nof the shadows of the large drapery, raised pentwise by her hands, which\ncovers her head, looks down, with painted eyes and brows showing above\na bandaged mouth, at the fumes of a beautiful censer or chafing-dish\nplaced on the carpet. I know not who this stately Mahometan may be, nor\nin what mysterious domestic or religious rite she may be engaged; but\nin her muffled contemplation and her pearl-colored robes, under her\nplastered arcade which shines in the Eastern light, she transports and\ntorments us. The picture is exquisite, a radiant effect of white upon\nwhite, of similar but discriminated tones. In dividing the honor that\nMr. Sargent has won by his finest work between the portrait of the young\nlady of 1881 and the group of four little girls which was painted in\n1882 and exhibited with the success it deserved the following year, I\nmust be careful to give the latter picture not too small a share. The\nartist has done nothing more felicitous and interesting than this view\nof a rich dim, rather generalized French interior (the perspective of a\nhall with a shining floor, where screens and tall Japanese vases\nshimmer and loom), which encloses the life and seems to form the happy\nplay-world of a family of charming children. The treatment is eminently\nunconventional, and there is none of the usual symmetrical balancing of\nthe figures in the foreground. The place is regarded as a whole; it is\na scene, a comprehensive impression; yet none the less do the little\nfigures in their white pinafores (when was the pinafore ever painted\nwith that power and made so poetic?) detach themselves and live with a\npersonal life. Two of the sisters stand hand in hand at the back, in\nthe delightful, the almost equal, company of a pair of immensely tall\nemblazoned jars, which overtop them and seem also to partake of the life\nof the picture; the splendid porcelain and the aprons of the children\nshine together, while a mirror in the brown depth behind them catches\nthe light. Another little girl presents herself, with abundant tresses\nand slim legs, her hands behind her, quite to the left; and the\nyoungest, nearest to the spectator, sits on the floor and plays with her\ndoll. The naturalness of the composition, the loveliness of the complete\neffect, the light, free' security of the execution, the sense it gives\nus as of assimilated secrets and of instinct and knowledge playing\ntogether--all this makes the picture as astonishing a work on the part\nof a young man of twenty-six as the portrait of 1881 was astonishing on\nthe part of a young man of twenty-four.\n\nIt is these remarkable encounters that justify us in writing almost\nprematurely of a career which is not yet half unfolded. Mr. Sargent is\nsometimes accused of a want of \"finish,\" but if finish means the last\nword of expressiveness of touch, \"The Hall with the Four Children,\" as\nwe may call it, may-stand as a permanent reference on this point. If the\npicture of the Spanish dancer illustrates, as it seems to me to do, the\nlatent dangers of the Impressionist practice, so this finer performance\nshows what victories it may achieve. And in relation to the latter I\nmust repeat what I said about the young lady with the flower, that this\nis the sort of work which, when produced in youth, leads the attentive\nspectator to ask unanswerable questions. He finds himself murmuring,\n\"Yes, but what is left?\" and even wondering whether it be an advantage\nto an artist to obtain early in life such possession of his means that\nthe struggle with them, discipline, _t\u00c3\u00a2tonnement_, cease to exist for\nhim. May not this breed an irresponsibility of cleverness, a wantonness,\nan irreverence--what is vulgarly termed a \"larkiness\"--on the part of\nthe youthful genius who has, as it were, all his fortune in his pocket?\nSuch are the possibly superfluous broodings of those who are critical\neven in their warmest admirations and who sometimes suspect that it may\nbe better for an artist to have a certain part of his property invested\nin unsolved difficulties. When this is not the case, the question with\nregard to his future simplifies itself somewhat portentously. \"What will\nhe do with it?\" we ask, meaning by the pronoun the sharp, completely\nforged weapon. It becomes more purely a question of responsibility, and\nwe hold him altogether to a higher account. This is the case with Mr.\nSargent; he knows so much about the art of painting that he perhaps does\nnot fear emergencies quite enough, and that having knowledge to spare\nhe may be tempted to play with it and waste it. Various, curious, as we\nhave called him, he occasionally tries experiments which seem to arise\nfrom the mere high spirits of his brush, and runs risks little courted\nby the votaries of the literal, who never expose their necks to escape\nfrom the common. For the literal and the common he has the smallest\ntaste; when he renders an object into the language of painting his\ntranslation is a generous paraphrase.\n\nAs I have intimated, he has painted little but portraits; but he has\npainted very many of these, and I shall not attempt in so few pages to\ngive a catalogue of his works. Every canvas that has come from his hands\nhas not figured at the Salon; some of them have seen the light at other\nexhibitions in Paris; some of them in London (of which city Mr. Sargent\nis now an inhabitant), at the Royal Academy and the Grosvenor Gallery.\nIf he has been mainly represented by portraits there are two or three\nlittle subject-pictures of which I retain a grateful memory. There\nstands out in particular, as a pure gem, a small picture exhibited at\nthe Grosvenor, representing a small group of Venetian girls of the lower\nclass, sitting in gossip together one summer's day in the big, dim\nhall of a shabby old palazzo. The shutters let in a clink of light; the\nscagliola pavement gleams faintly in it; the whole place is bathed in\na kind of transparent shade. The girls are vaguely engaged in some very\nhumble household work; they are counting turnips or stringing onions,\nand these small vegetables, enchantingly painted, look as valuable as\nmagnified pearls. The figures are extraordinarily natural and vivid;\nwonderfully light and fine is the touch by which the painter evokes\nthe small familiar Venetian realities (he has handled them with a vigor\naltogether peculiar in various other studies which I have not space to\nenumerate), and keeps the whole thing free from that element of humbug\nwhich has ever attended most attempts to reproduce the idiosyncrasies\nof Italy. I am, however, drawing to the end of my remarks without\nhaving mentioned a dozen of those brilliant triumphs in the field of\nportraiture with which Mr. Sargent's name is preponderantly associated.\nI jumped from his \"Carolus Duran\" to the masterpiece of 1881 without\nspeaking of the charming \"Madame Pailleron\" of 1879, or the picture of\nthis lady's children the following year. Many, or rather most, of Mr.\nSargent's sitters have been French, and he has studied the physiognomy\nof this nation so attentively that a little of it perhaps remains in\nthe brush with which to-day, more than in his first years, he represents\nother types. I have alluded to his superb \"Docteur Pozzi,\" to whose very\nhandsome, still youthful head and slightly artificial posture he has\ngiven so fine a French cast that he might be excused if he should, even\non remoter pretexts, find himself reverting to it. This gentleman stands\nup in his brilliant red dressing-gown with the _prestance_ of a princely\nVandyck. I should like to commemorate the portrait of a lady of a\ncertain age and of an equally certain interest of appearance--a lady\nin black, with black hair, a black hat and a vast feather, which\nwas displayed at that entertaining little annual exhibition of the\n\"Mirlitons,\" in the Place Vend\u00c3\u00b4me. With the exquisite modelling of its\nface (no one better than Mr. Sargent understands the beauty that resides\nin exceeding fineness), this head remains in my mind as a masterly\nrendering of the look of experience--such experience as may be\nattributed to a woman slightly faded and eminently distinguished.\nSubject and treatment in this valuable piece are of an equal interest,\nand in the latter there is an element of positive sympathy which is not\nalways in a high degree the sign of Mr. Sargent's work. What shall I say\nof the remarkable canvas which, on the occasion of the Salon of 1884,\nbrought the critics about our artist's ears, the already celebrated\nportrait of \"Madame G.?\" It is an experiment of a highly original kind,\nand the painter has had in the case, in regard to what Mr. Ruskin would\ncall the \"rightness\" of his attempt, the courage of his opinion. A\ncontestable beauty, according to Parisian fame, the lady stands upright\nbeside a table on which her right arm rests, with her body almost\nfronting the spectator and her face in complete profile. She wears an\nentirely sleeveless dress of black satin, against which her admirable\nleft arm detaches itself; the line of her harmonious profile has a\nsharpness which Mr. Sargent does not always seek, and the crescent of\nDiana, an ornament in diamonds, rests on her singular head. This work\nhad not the good-fortune to please the public at large, and I believe it\neven excited a kind of unreasoned scandal--an idea sufficiently amusing\nin the light of some of the manifestations of the plastic effort to\nwhich, each year, the Salon stands sponsor. This superb picture, noble\nin conception and masterly in line, gives to the figure represented\nsomething of the high relief of the profiled images on great friezes.\nIt is a work to take or to leave, as the phrase is, and one in regard to\nwhich the question of liking or disliking comes promptly to be settled.\nThe author has never gone further in being boldly and consistently\nhimself.\n\nTwo of Mr. Sargent's recent productions have been portraits of American\nladies whom it must have been a delight to paint; I allude to those of\nLady Playfair and Mrs. Henry White, both of which were seen in the Royal\nAcademy of 1885, and the former subsequently in Boston, where it abides.\nThese things possess, largely, the quality which makes Mr. Sargent so\nhappy as a painter of women--a quality which can best be expressed by a\nreference to what it is not, to the curiously literal, prosaic, sexless\ntreatment to which, in the commonplace work that looks down at us from\nthe walls of almost all exhibitions, delicate feminine elements have\nevidently so often been sacrificed. Mr. Sargent handles these elements\nwith a special feeling for them, and they borrow a kind of noble\nintensity from his brush. This intensity is not absent from the two\nportraits I just mentioned, that of Lady Playfair and that of Mrs. Henry\nWhite; it looks out at us from the erect head and frank animation of\nthe one, and the silvery sheen and shimmer of white satin and white lace\nwhich form the setting of the slim tall-ness of the other. In the Royal\nAcademy of 1886 Mr. Sargent was represented by three important canvases,\nall of which reminded the spectator of how much the brilliant effect he\nproduces in an English exhibition arises from a certain appearance that\nhe has of looking down from a height, a height of cleverness, a sensible\ngiddiness of facility, at the artistic problems of the given case.\nSometimes there is even a slight impertinence in it; that, doubtless,\nwas the impression of many of the people who passed, staring, with an\nejaculation, before the triumphant group of the three Misses V. These\nyoung ladies, seated in a row, with a room much foreshortened for a\nbackground, and treated with a certain familiarity of frankness, excited\nin London a chorus of murmurs not dissimilar to that which it had been\nthe fortune of the portrait exhibited in 1884 to elicit in Paris, and\nhad the further privilege of drawing forth some prodigies of purblind\ncriticism. Works of this character are a genuine service; after the\nshort-lived gibes of the profane have subsided, they are found to have\ncleared the air. They remind people that the faculty of taking a direct,\nindependent, unborrowed impression is not altogether lost.\n\nIn this very rapid review I have accompanied Mr. Sargent to a very\nrecent date. If I have said that observers encumbered with a nervous\ntemperament may at any moment have been anxious about his future, I have\nit on my conscience to add that the day has not yet come for a complete\nextinction of this anxiety. Mr. Sargent is so young, in spite of the\nplace allotted to him in these pages, so often a record of long careers\nand uncontested triumphs that, in spite also of the admirable works he\nhas already produced, his future is the most valuable thing he has\nto show. We may still ask ourselves what he will do with it, while we\nindulge the hope that he will see fit to give successors to the two\npictures which I have spoken of emphatically as his finest. There is\nno greater work of art than a great portrait--a truth to be constantly\ntaken to heart by a painter holding in his hands the weapon that Mr.\nSargent wields. The gift that he possesses he possesses completely--the\nimmediate perception of the end and of the means. Putting aside the\nquestion of the subject (and to a great portrait a common sitter will\ndoubtless not always contribute), the highest result is achieved when\nto this element of quick perception a certain faculty of brooding\nreflection is added. I use this name for want of a better, and I mean\nthe quality in the light of which the artist sees deep into his subject,\nundergoes it, absorbs it, discovers in it new things that were not\non the surface, becomes patient with it, and almost reverent, and, in\nshort, enlarges and humanizes the technical problem.\n\n\n\n\nHONOR\u00c3\u0089 DAUMIER\n\nAS we attempt, at the present day, to write the history of everything,\nit would be strange if we had happened to neglect the annals of\ncaricature; for the very essence of the art of Cruikshank and Gavarni,\nof Daumier and Leech, is to be historical; and every one knows how\naddicted is this great science to discoursing about itself. Many\nindustrious seekers, in England and France, have ascended the stream\nof time to the source of the modern movement of pictorial satire. The\nstream of time is in this case mainly the stream of journalism; for\nsocial and political caricature, as the present century has practised\nit, is only journalism made doubly vivid.\n\nThe subject indeed is a large one, if we reflect upon it, for many\npeople would tell us that journalism is the greatest invention of our\nage. If this rich affluent has shared the great fortune of the general\ntorrent, so, on other sides, it touches the fine arts, touches manners,\ntouches morals. All this helps to account for its inexhaustible\nlife; journalism is the criticism of the moment _at_ the moment, and\ncaricature is that criticism at once simplified and intensified by a\nplastic form. We know the satiric image as periodical, and above all as\npunctual--the characteristics of the printed sheet with which custom has\nat last inveterately associated it.\n\nThis, by-the-way, makes us wonder considerably at the failure of\ncaricature to achieve, as yet, a high destiny in America--a failure\nwhich might supply an occasion for much explanatory discourse, much\nsearching of the relations of things. The newspaper has been taught\nto flourish among us as it flourishes nowhere else, and to flourish\nmoreover on a humorous and irreverent basis; yet it has never taken to\nitself this helpful concomitant of an unscrupulous spirit and a quick\nperiodicity. The explanation is probably that it needs an old society to\nproduce ripe caricature. The newspaper thrives in the United States, but\njournalism languishes; for the lively propagation of news is one thing\nand the large interpretation of it is another. A society has to be old\nbefore it becomes critical, and it has to become critical before it can\ntake pleasure in the reproduction of its incongruities by an instrument\nas impertinent as the indefatigable crayon. Irony, scepticism, pessimism\nare, in any particular soil, plants of gradual growth, and it is in the\nart of caricature that they flower most aggressively. Furthermore they\nmust be watered by education--I mean by the education of the eye and\nhand--all of which things take time. The soil must be rich too, the\nincongruities must swarm. It is open to doubt whether a pure democracy\nis very liable to make this particular satiric return upon itself; for\nwhich it would seem tha' certain social complications are indispensable.\nThese complications are supplied from the moment a democracy becomes,\nas we may say, impure from its own point of view; from the moment\nvariations and heresies, deviations or perhaps simple affirmations\nof taste and temper begin to multiply within it. Such things afford a\n_point d'appui_; for it is evidently of the essence of caricature to be\nreactionary. We hasten to add that its satiric force varies immensely in\nkind and in degree according to the race, or to the individual talent,\nthat takes advantage of it.\n\nI used just now the term pessimism; but that was doubtless in a\ngreat measure because I have been turning over a collection of the\nextraordinarily vivid drawings of Honor\u00c3\u00a9 Daumier. The same impression\nwould remain with me, no doubt, if I had been consulting an equal\nquantity of the work of Gavarni the wittiest, the most literary and most\nacutely profane of all chartered mockers with the pencil. The feeling of\ndisrespect abides in all these things, the expression of the spirit for\nwhich humanity is definable primarily by its weaknesses. For Daumier\nthese weaknesses are altogether ugly and grotesque, while for Gavarni\nthey are either basely graceful or touchingly miserable; but the vision\nof them in both cases is close and direct. If, on the other hand, we\nlook through a dozen volumes of the collection of _Punch_ we get an\nequal impression of hilarity, but we by no means get an equal impression\nof irony. Certainly the pages of _Punch_ do not reek with pessimism;\ntheir \"criticism of life\" is gentle and forbearing. Leech is positively\noptimistic; there is at any rate nothing infinite in his irreverence;\nit touches bottom as soon as it approaches the pretty woman or the nice\ngirl. It is such an apparition as this that really, in Gavarni, awakes\nthe scoffer. Du Maurier is as graceful as Gavarni, but his sense of\nbeauty conjures away almost everything save our minor vices. It is\nin the exploration of our major ones that Gavarni makes his principal\ndiscoveries of charm or of absurdity of attitude. None the less, of\ncourse, the general inspiration of both artists is the same: the desire\nto try the innumerable different ways in which the human subject may\n_not_ be taken seriously.\n\nIf this view of that subject, in its plastic manifestations, makes\nhistory of a sort, it will not in general be of a kind to convert those\npersons who find history sad reading. The writer of the present lines\nremained unconverted, lately, on an occasion on which many cheerful\ninfluences were mingled with his impression. They were of a nature to\nwhich he usually does full justice, even overestimating perhaps their\ncharm of suggestion; but, at the hour I speak of, the old Parisian quay,\nthe belittered print-shop, the pleasant afternoon, the glimpse of the\ngreat Louvre on the other side of the Seine, in the interstices of the\nsallow _estampes_ suspended in window and doorway--all these elements\nof a rich actuality availed only to mitigate, without transmuting, that\ngeneral vision of a high, cruel pillory which pieced itself together as\nI drew specimen after specimen from musty portfolios. I had been passing\nthe shop when I noticed in a small _vitrine_, let into the embrasure of\nthe doorway, half a dozen soiled, striking lithographs, which it took no\nmore than a first glance to recognize as the work of Daumier. They were\nonly old pages of the _Charivari_, torn away from the text and rescued\nfrom the injury of time; and they were accompanied with an inscription\nto the effect that many similar examples of the artist were to be seen\nwithin. To become aware of this circumstance was to enter the shop and\nto find myself promptly surrounded with bulging; _cartons_ and tattered\nrelics. These relics--crumpled leaves of the old comic journals of the\nperiod from 1830 to 1855--are neither rare nor expensive; but I happened\nto have lighted on a particularly copious collection, and I made the\nmost of my small good-fortune, in order to transmute it, if possible,\ninto a sort of compensation for my having missed unavoidably, a few\nmonths before, the curious exhibition \"de la Caricature Moderne\" held\nfor several weeks just at hand, in the \u00c3\u0089cole des Beaux-Arts.\n\nDaumier was said to have appeared there in considerable force; and it\nwas a loss not to have had that particular opportunity of filling one's\nmind with him.\n\nThere was perhaps a perversity in having wished to do so, strange,\nindigestible stuff of contemplation as he might appear to be; but the\nperversity had had an honorable growth. Daumier's great days were in the\nreign of Louis-Philippe; but in the early years of the Second Empire\nhe still plied his coarse and formidable pencil. I recalled, from a\njuvenile consciousness, the last failing strokes of it. They used to\nimpress me in Paris, as a child, with their abnormal blackness as well\nas with their grotesque, magnifying movement, and there was something in\nthem that rather scared a very immature admirer. This small personage,\nhowever, was able to perceive later, when he was unfortunately deprived\nof the chance of studying them, that there were various things in them\nbesides the power to excite a vague alarm. Daumier was perhaps a great\nartist; at all events unsatisfied curiosity increased in proportion to\nthat possibility.\n\nThe first complete satisfaction of it was really in the long hours that\nI spent in the little shop on the quay. There I filled my mind with\nhim, and there too, at no great cost, I could make a big parcel of these\ncheap reproductions of his work. This work had been shown in the Ecole\ndes Beaux-Arts as it came from his hand; M. Champfleury, his biographer,\nhis cataloguer and devotee, having poured forth the treasures of a\nprecious collection, as I suppose they would be called in the case of an\nartist of higher flights. It was only as he was seen by the readers of\nthe comic journals of his day that I could now see him; but I tried to\nmake up for my want of privilege by prolonged immersion. I was not able\nto take home all the portfolios from the shop on the quay, but I took\nhome what I could, and I went again to turn over the superannuated\npiles. I liked looking at them on the spot; I seemed still surrounded by\nthe artist's vanished Paris and his extinct Parisians. Indeed no quarter\nof the delightful city probably shows, on the whole, fewer changes from\nthe aspect it wore during the period of Louis-Philippe, the time when\nit will ever appear to many of its friends to have been most delightful.\nThe long line of the quay is unaltered, and the rare charm of the river.\nPeople came and went in the shop: it is a wonder how many, in the course\nof an hour, may lift the latch even of an establishment that pretends to\nno great business. What was all this small, sociable, contentious\nlife but the great Daumier's subject-matter? He was the painter of the\nParisian bourgeois, and the voice of the bourgeois was in the air.\n\nM. Champfleury has given a summary of Daumier's career in his smart\nlittle _Histoire e la Caricature Moderne_, a record not at all abundant\nin personal detail. The biographer has told his story better perhaps in\nhis careful catalogue of the artist's productions, the first sketch of\nwhich is to be found in _L'Art_ for 1878. This copious list is Daumier's\nreal history; his life cannot have been a very different business from\nhis work. I read in the interesting publication of M. Grand-Carteret\n(_Les Moeurs et la Caricature en France_ 1888) that our artist produced\nnearly 4000 lithographs and a thousand drawings on wood, up to the time\nwhen failure of eyesight compelled him to rest. This is not the sort\nof activity that leaves a man much time for independent adventures, and\nDaumier was essentially of the type, common in France, of the specialist\nso immersed in his specialty that he can be painted in only one\nattitude--a general circumstance which perhaps helps to account for\nthe paucity, in that country, of biography, in our English sense of the\nword, in proportion to the superabundance of criticism.\n\nHonor\u00c3\u00a9 Daumier was born at Marseilles February 26th, 1808; he died\non the 11th of the same month, 1879. His main activity, however,\nwas confined to the earlier portion of a career of almost exactly\nseventy-one years, and I find it affirmed in Vapereau's _Dictionnaire\ndes Contemporains_ that he became completely blind between 1850 and\n1860. He enjoyed a pension from the State of 2400 francs; but what\nrelief from misery could mitigate a quarter of a century of darkness\nfor a man who had looked out at the world with such vivifying eyes? His\nfather had followed the trade of a glazier, but was otherwise vocal\nthan in the emission of the rich street-cry with which we used all to be\nfamiliar, and which has vanished with so many other friendly pedestrian\nnotes. The elder Daumier wrought verses as well as window-panes, and M.\nChampfleury has disinterred a small volume published by him in 1823.\nThe merit of his poetry is not striking; but he was able to transmit the\nartistic nature to his son, who, becoming promptly conscious of it, made\nthe inevitable journey to Paris in search of fortune.\n\nThe young draughtsman appeared to have missed at first the way to this\nboon; inasmuch as in the year 1832 he found himself condemned to six\nmonths' imprisonment for a lithograph disrespectful to Louis-Philippe.\nThis drawing had appeared in the _Caricature_, an organ of pictorial\nsatire founded in those days by one Philipon, with the aid of a band of\nyoung mockers to whom he gave ideas and a direction, and several others,\nof whom Gavarni, Henry Monnier, Decamps, Grandville, were destined to\nmake themselves a place. M. Eug\u00c3\u00a8ne Montrosier, in a highly appreciative\narticle on Daumier in _L'Art_ for 1878, says that this same Philipon\nwas _le journalisme fait homme_; which did not prevent him--rather\nin fact fostered such a result--from being perpetually in delicate\nrelations with the government. He had had many horses killed under\nhim, and had led a life of attacks, penalties, suppressions and\nresurrections. He subsequently established the _Charivari_ and launched\na publication entitled _L'Association Lithographique Mensuelle_, which\nbrought to light much of Daumier's early work. The artist passed\nrapidly from seeking his way to finding it, and from an ineffectual to a\nvigorous form.\n\nIn this limited compass and in the case of such a quantity of production\nit is almost impossible to specify--difficult to pick dozens of examples\nout of thousands. Daumier became more and more the political spirit of\nthe _Charivari_, or at least the political pencil, for M. Philipon, the\nbreath of whose nostrils was opposition--one perceives from here the\nlittle bilious, bristling, ingenious, insistent man--is to be credited\nwith a suggestive share in any enterprise in which he had a hand. This\npencil played over public life, over the sovereign, the ministers,\nthe deputies, the peers, the judiciary, the men and the measures,\nthe reputations and scandals of the moment, with a strange, ugly,\nextravagant, but none the less sane and manly vigor. Daumier's sign is\nstrength above all, and in turning over his pages to-day there is no\nintensity of force that the careful observer will not concede to him. It\nis perhaps another matter to assent to the proposition, put forth by\nhis greatest admirers among his countrymen, that he is the first of\nall caricaturists. To the writer of this imperfect sketch he remains\nconsiderably less interesting than Gavarni; and\/or a particular reason,\nwhich it is difficult to express otherwise than by saying that he is too\nsimple. Simplicity was not Gavarni's fault, and indeed to a large\ndegree it was Daumier's merit. The single grossly ridiculous or almost\nhauntingly characteristic thing which his figures represent is largely\nthe reason why they still represent life and an unlucky reality years\nafter the names attached to them have parted with a vivifying power.\nSuch vagueness has overtaken them, for the most part, and to such a thin\nreverberation have they shrunk, the persons and the affairs which\nwere then so intensely sketchable. Daumier handled them with a want of\nceremony which would have been brutal were it not for the element of\nscience in his work, making them immense and unmistakable in their\ndrollery, or at least in their grotesqueness; for the term drollery\nsuggests gayety, and Daumier is anything but gay. _Un rude peintre de\nmoeurs_, M. Champfleury calls him; and the phrase expresses his extreme\nbreadth of treatment.\n\nOf the victims of his \"rudeness\" M. Thiers is almost the only one whom\nthe present generation may recognize without a good deal of reminding,\nand indeed his hand is relatively light in delineating this personage\nof few inches and many episodes. M. Thiers must have been dear to the\ncaricaturist, for he belonged to the type that was easy to \"do;\" it\nbeing well known that these gentlemen appreciate public characters in\ndirect proportion to their saliency of feature. When faces are reducible\nto a few telling strokes their wearers are overwhelmed with the honors\nof publicity; with which, on the other hand, nothing is more likely to\ninterfere than the possession of a countenance neatly classical. Daumier\nhad only to give M. Thiers the face of a clever owl, and the trick was\nplayed. Of course skill was needed to individualize the symbol, but that\nis what caricaturists propose to themselves. Of how well he\nsucceeded the admirable plate of the lively little minister in a\n\"new dress\"--tricked out in the uniform of a general of the First\nRepublic--is a sufficient illustration. The bird of night is not an\nacute bird, but how the artist has presented the image of a selected\nspecimen! And with what a life-giving pencil the whole figure is put\non its feet, what intelligent drawing, what a rich, free stroke! The\nallusions conveyed in it are to such forgotten things that it is strange\nto think the personage was, only the other year, still contemporaneous;\nthat he might have been met, on a fine day, taking a few firm steps in\na quiet part of the Champs \u00c3\u0089lys\u00c3\u00a9es, with his footman carrying a second\novercoat and looking doubly tall behind him. In whatever attitude\nDaumier depicts him, planted as a tiny boxing-master at the feet of the\nvirtuous colossus in a blouse (whose legs are apart, like those-of the\nRhodian), in whom the artist represents the People, to watch the match\nthat is about to come off between Ratapoil and M. Berryer, or even in\nthe act of lifting the \"parricidal\" club of a new repressive law to\ndeal a blow at the Press, an effulgent, diligent, sedentary muse (this\npicture, by the way, is a perfect specimen of the simple and telling in\npolitical caricature)--however, as I say, he takes M. Thiers, there is\nalways a rough indulgence in his crayon, as if he were grateful to him\nfor lending himself so well. He invented Ratapoil as he appropriated\nRobert Macaire, and as a caricaturist he never fails to put into\ncirculation, when he can, a character to whom he may attribute as many\nas possible of the affectations or the vices of the day. Robert Macaire,\nan imaginative, a romantic rascal, was the hero of a highly successful\nmelodrama written for Frederick Lemaitre; but Daumier made him the\ntype of the swindler at large in an age of feverish speculation--the\nprojector of showy companies, the advertiser of worthless shares. There\nis a whole series of drawings descriptive of his exploits, a hundred\nmasterly plates which, according to M. Champfleury, consecrated\nDaumier's reputation. The subject, the legend, was in most cases, still\naccording to M. Champfleury, suggested by Philipon. Sometimes it was\nvery witty; as for instance when Bertrand, the muddled acolyte or\nscraping second fiddle of the hero, objects, in relation to a brilliant\nscheme which he has just developed, with the part Bertrand is to play,\nthat there are constables in the country, and he promptly replies,\n\"Constables? So much the better--they'll take the shares!\" Ratapoil was\nan evocation of the same general character, but with a difference of\n_nuance_--the ragged political bully, or hand-to-mouth demagogue, with\nthe smashed tall hat, cocked to one side, the absence of linen, the club\nhalf-way up his sleeve, the swagger and pose of being gallant for the\npeople. Ratapoil abounds in the promiscuous drawings that I have looked\nover, and is always very strong and living, with a considerable element\nof the sinister, so often in Daumier an accompaniment of the comic.\nThere is an admirable page--it brings the idea down to 1851--in which\na sordid but astute peasant, twirling his thumbs on his stomach and\nlooking askance, allows this political adviser to urge upon him in\na whisper that there is not a minute to lose--to lose for action, of\ncourse--if he wishes to keep his wife, his house, his field, his heifer\nand his calf. The canny scepticism in the ugly, half-averted face of the\ntypical rustic who considerably suspects his counsellor is indicated by\na few masterly strokes.\n\nThis is what the student of Daumier recognizes as his science, or, if\nthe word has a better grace, his art. It is what has kept life in his\nwork so long after so many of the occasions of it have been swept into\ndarkness. Indeed, there is no such commentary on renown as the \"back\nnumbers\" of a comic journal. They show us that at certain moments\ncertain people were eminent, only to make us unsuccessfully try to\nremember what they were eminent _for_. And the comparative obscurity\n(comparative, I mean, to the talent of the caricaturist) overtakes even\nthe most justly honored names. M. Berryer was a splendid speaker and a\npublic servant of real distinction and the highest utility; yet the fact\nthat to-day his name is on few men's lips seems to be emphasized by this\nother fact that we continue to pore over Daumier, in whose plates we\nhappen to come across him. It reminds one afresh how Art is an embalmer,\na magician, whom we can never speak too fair. People duly impressed with\nthis truth are sometimes laughed at for their superstitious tone, which\nis pronounced, according to the fancy of the critic, mawkish, maudlin or\nhysterical. But it is really difficult to see how any reiteration of\nthe importance of art can overstate the plain facts. It prolongs, it\npreserves, it consecrates, it raises from the dead. It conciliates,\ncharms, bribes posterity; and it murmurs to mortals, as the old French\npoet sang to his mistress, \"You will be fair only so far as I have said\nso.\" When it whispers even to the great, \"You depend upon me, and I can\ndo more for you, in the long-run, than any one else,\" it is scarcely too\nproud. It puts method and power and the strange, real, mingled air\nof things into Daumier's black sketchiness, so full of the technical\n_gras_, the \"fat\" which French critics commend and which we have no\nword to express. It puts power above all, and the effect which he\nbest achieves, that of a certain simplification of the attitude or the\ngesture to an almost symbolic generality. His persons represent only one\nthing, but they insist tremendously on that, and their expression of it\nabides with us, unaccompanied with timid detail. It may really be said\nthat they represent only one class--the old and ugly; so that there is\nproof enough of a special faculty in his having played such a concert,\nlugubrious though it be, on a single chord. It has been made a reproach\nto him, says M. Grand-Carteret, that \"his work is lacking in two capital\nelements--_la jeunesse et la femme_;\" and the commentator resents his\nbeing made to suffer for the deficiency--\"as if an artist could be at\nthe same time deep, comic, graceful and pretty; as if all those who have\na real value had not created for themselves a form to which they remain\nconfined and a type which they reproduce in all its variations, as soon\nas they have touched the \u00c3\u00a6sthetic ideal that has been their dream.\nAssuredly humanity, as this great painter saw it, could not be\nbeautiful; one asks one's self what maiden in her teens, a pretty face,\nwould have done in the midst of these good, plain folk, stunted and\nelderly, with faces like wrinkled apples. A simple accessory most of\nthe time, woman is for him merely a termagant or a blue-stocking who has\nturned the corner.\"\n\nWhen the eternal feminine, for Daumier appears in neither of these\nforms he sees it in Madame Chaboulard or Madame Fribochon, the old\nsnuff-taking, gossiping portress, in a nightcap and shuffling _savates_,\nrelating or drinking in the wonderful and the intimate. One of his\nmasterpieces represents three of these dames, lighted by a guttering\ncandle, holding their heads together to discuss the fearful earthquake\nat Bordeaux, the consequence of the government's allowing the surface\nof the globe to be unduly dug out in California. The representation of\nconfidential imbecility could not go further. When a man leaves out so\nmuch of life as Daumier--youth and beauty and the charm of woman and the\nloveliness of childhood and the manners of those social groups of\nwhom it may most be said that they _have_ manners--when he exhibits a\ndeficiency on this scale it might seem that the question was not to be\nso easily disposed of as in the very non-apologetic words I have just\nquoted. All the same (and I confess it is singular), we may feel what\nDaumier omitted and yet not be in the least shocked by the claim of\npredominance made for him. It is impossible to spend a couple of hours\nover him without assenting to this claim, even though there may be a\nweariness in such a panorama of ugliness and an inevitable reaction\nfrom it. This anomaly, and the challenge to explain it which appears to\nproceed from him, render him, to my sense, remarkably interesting. The\nartist whose idiosyncrasies, whose limitations, if you will, make\nus question and wonder, in the light of his fame, has an element\nof fascination not attaching to conciliatory talents. If M. Eugene\nMontrosier may say of him without scandalizing us that such and such\nof his drawings belong to the very highest art, it is interesting (and\nDaumier profits by the interest) to put one's finger on the reason we\nare not scandalized.\n\nI think this reason is that, on the whole he is so peculiarly serious.\nThis may seem an odd ground of praise for a jocose draughtsman, and of\ncourse what I mean is that his comic force is serious--a very different\nthin from the absence of comedy. This essential sign of the caricaturist\nmay surely be anything it will so long as it is there. Daumier's figures\nare almost always either foolish, fatuous politicians or frightened,\nmystified bourgeois; yet they help him to give us a strong sense of\nthe nature of man. They are some times so serious that they are almost\ntragic the look of the particular pretension, combined with inanity, is\ncarried almost to madness. There is a magnificent drawing of the series\nof \"Le Public du Salon,\" old classicists looking up, horrified and\nscandalized, at the new romantic work of 1830, in which the faces have\nan appalling gloom of mystification and platitude. We feel that Daumier\nreproduces admirably the particular life that he sees, because it is\nthe very medium in which he moves. He has no wide horizon; the absolute\nbourgeois hems him in, and he is a bourgeois himself, without poetic\nironies, to whom a big cracked mirror has been given. His thick, strong,\nmanly touch stands, in every way, for so much knowledge. He used to make\nlittle images, in clay and in wax (many of them still exist), of\nthe persons he was in the habit of representing, so that they might\nconstantly seem to be \"sitting\" for him. The caricaturist of that day\nhad not the help of the ubiquitous photograph. Daumier painted actively,\nas well, in his habitation, all dedicated to work, on the narrow island\nof St. Louis, where the Seine divides and where the monuments of old\nParis stand thick, and the types that were to his purpose pressed close\nupon him. He had not far to go to encounter the worthy man, in the\nseries of \"Les Papas,\" who is reading the evening paper at the caf\u00c3\u00a9\nwith so amiable and placid a credulity, while his unnatural little boy,\nopposite to him, finds sufficient entertainment in the much-satirized\n_Constitutionnel_. The bland absorption of the papa, the face of the man\nwho believes everything he sees in the newspaper, is as near as Daumier\noften comes to positive gentleness of humor. Of the same family is the\npoor gentleman, in \"Actualit\u00c3\u00a9s,\" seen, in profile, under a doorway where\nhe has taken refuge from a torrent of rain, who looks down at his neat\nlegs with a sort of speculative contrition and says. \"To think of\nmy having just ordered two pairs of white trousers.\" The _tout petit\nbourgeois_ palpitates in both these sketches.\n\nI must repeat that it is absurd to pick half a dozen at hazard, out of\nfive thousand; yet a few selections are the only way to call attention\nto his strong drawing. This has a virtuosity of its own, for all\nits hit-or-miss appearance. Whatever he touches--the nude, in the\nswimming-baths on the Seine, the intimations of landscape, when his\n_petits rentiers_ go into the suburbs for a Sunday--acquires relief and\ncharacter, Docteur V\u00c3\u00a9ron, a celebrity of the reign of Louis-Philippe,\na M\u00c3\u00a6cenas of the hour, a director of the opera, author of the _M\u00c3\u00a9moires\nd'un Bourgeois de Paris_--this temporary \"illustration,\" who appears to\nhave been almost indecently ugly, would not be vivid to us to-day had\nnot Daumier, who was often effective at his expense, happened to have\nrepresented him, in some crisis of his career, as a sort of naked\ninconsolable Vitellius. He renders the human body with a cynical\nsense of its possible flabbiness and an intimate acquaintance with its\nstructure. \"Une Promenade Conjugale,\" in the series of \"Tout ce qu'on\nvoudra,\" portrays a hillside, on a summer afternoon, on which a man has\nthrown himself on his back to rest, with his arms locked under his head.\nHis fat, full-bosomed, middle-aged wife, under her parasol, with a bunch\nof field-flowers in her hand, looks down at him patiently and seems to\nsay, \"Come, my dear, get up.\" There is surely no great point in this;\nthe only point is life, the glimpse of the little snatch of poetry in\nprose. It is a matter of a few broad strokes of the crayon; yet the\npleasant laziness of the man, the idleness of the day, the fragment of\nhomely, familiar dialogue, the stretch of the field with a couple of\ntrees merely suggested, have a communicative truth.\n\nI perhaps exaggerate all this, and in insisting upon the merit of\nDaumier may appear to make light of the finer accomplishment of several\nmore modern talents, in England and France, who have greater ingenuity\nand subtlety and have carried qualities of execution so, much further.\nIn looking at this complicated younger work, which has profited so by\nexperience and comparison, it is inevitable that we should perceive it\nto be infinitely more cunning. On the other hand Daumier, moving in his\ncontracted circle, has an impressive depth. It comes back to his strange\nseriousness. He is a draughtsman by race, and if he has not extracted\nthe same brilliancy from training, or perhaps even from effort and\nexperiment, as some of his successors, does not his richer satiric and\nsympathetic feeling more than make up the difference?\n\nHowever this question may be answered, some of his drawings belong to\nthe class of the unforgetable. It may be a perversity of prejudice,\nbut even the little cut of the \"Connoisseurs,\" the group of gentlemen\ncollected round a picture and criticising it in various attitudes\nof sapience and sufficiency, appears to me to have the strength that\nabides. The criminal in the dock, the flat-headed murderer, bending over\nto speak to his advocate, who turns a whiskered, professional, anxious\nhead to caution and remind him. tells a large, terrible story and awakes\na recurrent shudder. We see the gray court-room, we feel the personal\nsuspense and the immensity of justice. The \"Saltimbanques,\" reproduced\nin _L'Art_ for 1878, is a page of tragedy, the finest of a cruel\nseries. M. Eug\u00c3\u00a8ne Montrosier says of it that \"The drawing is masterly,\nincomparably firm, the composition superb, the general impression quite\nof the first order.\" It exhibits a pair of lean, hungry mountebanks, a\nclown and a harlequin beating the drum and trying a comic attitude\nto attract the crowd, at a fair, to a poor booth in front of which a\npainted canvas, offering to view a simpering fat woman, is suspended.\nBut the crowd doesn't come, and the battered tumblers, with their\nfurrowed cheeks, go through their pranks in the void. The whole thing\nis symbolic and full of grim-ness, imagination and pity. It is the sense\nthat we shall find in him, mixed with his homelier extravagances, an\nelement prolific in indications of this order that draws us back to\nDaumier.\n\n\n\n\nAFTER THE PLAY\n\nThe play was not over when the curtain fell, four months ago; it\nwas continued in a supplementary act or epilogue which took place\nimmediately afterwards. \"Come home to tea,\" Florentia said to certain\nfriends who had stopped to speak to her in the lobby of the little\ntheatre in Soho--they had been present at a day performance by the\ncompany of the Theatre Libre, transferred for a week from Paris; and\nthree of these--Auberon and Dorriforth, accompanying Amicia--turned up\nso expeditiously that the change of scene had the effect of being neatly\nexecuted. The short afterpiece--it was in truth very slight--began with\nAmicia's entrance and her declaration that she would never again go to\nan afternoon performance: it was such a horrid relapse into the real to\nfind it staring at you through the ugly daylight on coming out of the\nblessed fictive world.\n\nDorriforth. Ah, you touch there on one of the minor sorrows of life.\nThat's an illustration of the general change that comes to pass in us\nas we grow older, if we have ever loved the stage: the fading of the\nglamour and the mystery that surround it.\n\nAuberon. Do you call it a minor sorrow? It's one of the greatest. And\nnothing can mitigate it.\n\nAmicia. Wouldn't it be mitigated a little if the stage were a trifle\nbetter? You must remember how that has changed.\n\nAuberon. Never, never: it's the same old stage. The change is in\nourselves.\n\nFlorentia. Well, I never would have given an evening to what we have\njust seen. If one could have put it in between luncheon and tea, well\nenough. But one's evenings are too precious.\n\nDorriforth. Note that--it's very important.\n\nFlorentia. I mean too precious for that sort of thing.\n\nAuberon. Then you didn't sit spellbound by the little history of the Due\nd'Enghien?\n\nFlorentia. I sat yawning. Heavens, what a piece!\n\nAmicia. Upon my word I liked it. The last act made me cry.\n\nDorriforth. Wasn't it a curious, interesting specimen of some of the\nthings that are worth trying: an attempt to sail closer to the real?\n\nAuberon. How much closer? The fiftieth part of a point--it isn't\ncalculable.\n\nFlorentia. It was just like any other play--I saw no difference. It\nhad neither a plot, nor a subject, nor dialogue, nor situations, nor\nscenery, nor costumes, nor acting.\n\nAmicia. Then it was hardly, as you say, just like any other play.\n\nAuberon. Florentia should have said like any other _bad_'one. The only\nway it differed seemed to be that it was bad in theory as well as in\nfact.\n\nAmicia. It's a _morceau de vie_, as the French say.\n\nAuberon. Oh, don't begin on the French!\n\nAmicia. It's a French experiment--_que voulez-vous?_\n\nAuberon. English experiments will do.\n\nDorriforth. No doubt they would--if there _were_ any. But I don't see\nthem.\n\nAmicia. Fortunately: think what some of them might be! Though\nFlorentia saw nothing I saw many things in this poor little shabby \"Due\nd'Enghien,\" coming over to our roaring London, where the dots have to\nbe so big on the i's, with its barely audible note of originality. It\nappealed to me, touched me, offered me a poignant suggestion of the way\nthings happen in life.\n\nAuberon. In life they happen clumsily, stupidly, meanly. One goes to\nthe theatre just for the refreshment of seeing them happen in another\nway--in symmetrical, satisfactory form, with unmistakable effect and\njust at the right moment.\n\nDorriforth. It shows how the same cause may produce the most diverse\nconsequences. In this truth lies the only hope of art.\n\nAuberon. Oh, art, art--don't talk about art!\n\nAmicia. Mercy, we must talk about something!\n\nDorriforth. Auberon hates generalizations. Nevertheless I make bold\nto say that we go to the theatre in the same spirit in which we read\na novel, some of us to find one thing and some to find another; and\naccording as we look for the particular thing we find it.\n\nAuberon. That's a profound remark.\n\nFlorentia. We go to find amusement: that, surely, is what we all go for.\n\nAmicia. There's such a diversity in our idea of amusement.\n\nAuberon. Don't you impute to people more ideas than they have?\n\nDorriforth. Ah, one must do that or one couldn't talk about them. We\ngo to be interested; to be absorbed, beguiled and to lose ourselves, to\ngive ourselves up, in short, to a charm.\n\nFlorentia. And the charm is the strange, the extraordinary.\n\nAmicia. Ah, speak for yourself! The charm is the recognition of what we\nknow, what we feel.\n\nDorriforth. See already how you differ.\n\n\"SO!\"\n\nWhat we surrender ourselves to is the touch of nature, the sense of\nlife.\n\nAmicia. The first thing is to believe.\n\nFlorentia. The first thing, on the contrary, is to _dis_believe.\n\nAuberon. Lord, listen to them!\n\nDorriforth. The first thing is to folio--to care.\n\nFlorentia. I read a novel, I go to the theatre, to forget.\n\nAmicia. To forget what?\n\nFlorentia. To forget life; to thro myself into something more beautiful\nmore exciting: into fable and romance.\n\nDorriforth. The attraction of fable and romance is that it's about _us_,\nabout you and me--or people whose power to suffer and to enjoy is the\nsame as ours. In other words, we _live_ their experience, for the time,\nand that's hardly escaping from life.\n\nFlorentia. I'm not at all particular as to what you call it. Call it an\nescape from the common, the prosaic, the immediate.\n\nDorriforth. You couldn't put it better. That's the life that art, with\nAuberon's permission, gives us; that's the distinction it confers. This\nis why the greatest commonness is when our guide turns out a vulgar\nfellow--the angel, as we had supposed him, who has taken us by the hand.\nThen what becomes of our escape?\n\nFlorentia. It's precisely then that I complain of him. He leads us into\nfoul and dreary places--into flat and foolish deserts.\n\nDorriforth. He leads us into his own mind, his own vision of things:\nthat's the only place into which the poet _can_ lead us. It's there that\nhe finds \"As You Like It,\" it is there that he finds \"Comus,\" or \"The\nWay of the World,\" or the Christmas pantomime. It is when he betrays us,\nafter he has got us in and locked the door, when he can't keep from us\nthat we are in a bare little hole and that there are no pictures on the\nwalls, it is then that the immediate and the foolish overwhelm us.\n\nAmicia. That's what I liked in the piece we have been looking at. There\nwas an artistic intention, and the little room wasn't bare: there was\nsociable company in it. The actors were very humble aspirants, they were\ncommon--\n\nAuberon. Ah, when the French give their mind to that--!\n\nAmicia. Nevertheless they struck me as recruits to an interesting cause,\nwhich as yet (the house was so empty) could confer neither money nor\nglory. They had the air, poor things, of working for love.\n\nAuberon. For love of what?\n\nAmicia. Of the whole little enterprise--the idea of the Th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre Libre.\n\nFlorentia. Gracious, what you see in things! Don't you suppose they were\npaid?\n\nAmicia. I know nothing about it. I liked their shabbiness--they had\nonly what was indispensable in the way of dress and scenery. That often\npleases me: the imagination, in certain cases, is more finely persuaded\nby the little than by the much.\n\nDorriforth. I see what Amicia means.\n\nFlorentia. I'll warrant you do, and a great deal more besides.\n\nDorriforth. When the appointments are meagre and sketchy the\nresponsibility that rests upon the actors becomes a still more serious\nthing, and the spectator's observation of the way they rise to it a\npleasure more intense. The face and the voice are more to the purpose\nthan acres of painted canvas, and a touching intonation, a vivid gesture\nor two, than an army of supernumeraries.\n\nAuberon. Why not have everything--the face, the voice, the touching\nintonations, the vivid gestures, the acres of painted canvas, _and_ the\narmy of supernumeraries? Why not use bravely and intelligently every\nresource of which the stage disposes? What else was Richard Wagner's\ngreat theory, in producing his operas at Bayreuth?\n\nDorriforth. Why not, indeed? That would be the ideal. To have the\npicture complete at the same time the figures do their part in producing\nthe particular illusion required--what a perfection and what a joy! I\nknow no answer to that save the aggressive, objectionable fact. Simply\nlook at the stage of to-day and observe that these two branches of the\nmatter never do happen to go together. There is evidently a corrosive\nprinciple in the large command of machinery and decorations--a germ\nof perversion and corruption. It gets the upperhand--it becomes the\nmaster. It is so much less easy to get good actors than good scenery\nand to represent a situation by the delicacy of personal art than by\n\"building it in\" and having everything real. Surely there is no reality\nworth a farthing, on the stage, but what the actor gives, and only when\nhe has learned his business up to the hilt need he concern himself with\nhis material accessories. He hasn't a decent respect for his art unless\nhe be ready to render his part as if the whole illusion depended on that\nalone and the accessories didn't exist. The acting is everything or it's\nnothing. It ceases to be everything as soon as something else becomes\nvery important. This is the case, to-day, on the London stage: something\nelse is very important. The public have been taught to consider it so:\nthe clever machinery has ended by operating as a bribe and a blind.\nTheir sense of the rest of the matter has gone to the dogs, as you may\nperceive when you hear a couple of occupants of the stalls talking, in a\ntone that excites your curiosity, about a performance that's \"splendid.\"\n\nAmicia. Do you ever hear the occupants of the stalls talking? Never,\nin the _entr'actes_, have I detected, on their lips, a criticism or a\ncomment.\n\nDorriforth. Oh, they say \"splendid\"--distinctly! But a question or\ntwo reveals that their reference is vague: they don't themselves know\nwhether they mean the art of the actor or that of the stage-carpenter.\n\nAuberon. Isn't that confusion a high result of taste? Isn't it what's\ncalled a feeling for the _ensemble?_ The artistic effect, as a whole, is\nso welded together that you can't pick out the parts.\n\nDorriforth. Precisely; that's what it is in the best cases, and some\nexamples are wonderfully clever.\n\nFlorentia. Then what fault do you find? Dorriforth. Simply this--that\nthe whole is a pictorial whole, not a dramatic one. There is something\nindeed that you can't pick out, for the very good reason that--in any\nserious sense of the word--it isn't there.\n\nFlorentia. The public has taste, then, if it recognizes and delights in\na fine picture.\n\nDorriforth. I never said it hadn't, so far as that goes. The public\nlikes to be amused, and small blame to it. It isn't very particular\nabout the means, but it has rather a preference for amusements that I\nbelieves to be \"improving,\" other things being equal. I don't think it's\neither very intelligent or at all opinionated, the dear old public it\ntakes humbly enough what is given it and it doesn't cry for the moon. It\nhas an idea that fine scenery is an appeal to its nobler part, and that\nit shows a nice critical sense in preferring it to poor. That's a real\nintellectual flight, for the public.\n\nAuberon. Very well, its preference is right, and why isn't that a\nperfectly legitimate state of things?\n\nDorriforth. Why isn't it? It distinctly _is!_ Good scenery and poor\nacting are better than poor scenery with the same sauce. Only it becomes\nthen another matter: we are no longer talking about the drama.\n\nAuberon. Very likely that's the future of the drama, in London--an\nimmense elaboration of the picture.\n\nDorriforth. My dear fellow, you take the words out of my mouth.\nAn immense elaboration of the picture and an immense sacrifice of\neverything else: it would take very little more to persuade me that that\nwill be the only formula for our children. It's all right, when once we\nhave buried our dead. I have no doubt that the scenic part of the art,\nremarkable as some of its achievements already appear to us, is only in\nits infancy, and that we are destined to see wonders done that we now\nbut faintly conceive. The probable extension of the mechanical arts\nis infinite. \"Built in,\" forsooth! We shall see castles and cities and\nmountains and rivers built in. Everything points that way; especially\nthe constitution of the contemporary multitude. It is huge and\ngood-natured and common. It likes big, unmistakable, knock-down effects;\nit likes to get its money back in palpable, computable change. It's in\na tremendous hurry, squeezed together, with a sort of generalized gape,\nand the last thing it expects of you is that you will spin things fine.\nYou can't portray a character, alas, or even, vividly, any sort of human\nfigure, unless, in some degree, you do that. Therefore the theatre,\ninevitably accommodating itself, will be at last a landscape without\nfigures. I mean, of course, without figures that count. There will\nbe little illustrations of costume stuck about--dressed manikins; but\nthey'll have nothing to say: they won't even go through the form of\nspeech.\n\nAmicia. What a hideous prospect!\n\nDorriforth. Not necessarily, for we shall have grown used to it: we\nshall, as I say, have buried our dead. To-day it's cruel, because our\nold ideals are only dying, they are _in extremis_, they are virtually\ndefunct, but they are above-ground--we trip and stumble on them. We\nshall eventually lay them tidily away. This is a bad moment, because\nit's a moment of transition, and we still _miss_ the old superstition,\nthe bravery of execution, the eloquence of the lips, the interpretation\nof character. We miss these things, of course, in proportion as the\nostensible occasion for them is great; we miss them particularly, for\ninstance, when the curtain rises on Shakespeare. Then we are conscious\nof a certain divine dissatisfaction, of a yearning for that which isn't.\nBut we shall have got over this discomfort on the day when we have\naccepted the ostensible occasion as merely and frankly ostensible, and\nthe real one as having nothing to do with it.\n\nFlorentia. I don't follow you. As I'm one of the squeezed, gaping\npublic, I must be dense and vulgar. You do, by-the-way, immense\ninjustice to that body. They do care for character--care much for it.\nAren't they perpetually talking about the actor's conception of it?\n\nDorriforth. Dear lady, what better proof can there be of their\nineptitude, and that painted canvas and real water are the only things\nthey understand? The vanity of wasting time over that! Auberon. Over\nwhat? Dorriforth. The actor's conception of a part. It's the refuge of\nobservers who are no observers and critics who are no critics. With what\non earth have we to do save his execution?\n\nFlorentia. I don't in the least agree with you.\n\nAmicia. Are you very sure, my poor Dorriforth?\n\nAuberon. Give him rope and he'll hang himself.\n\nDorriforth. It doesn't need any great license to ask who in the world\nholds in his bosom the sacred secret of the right conception. All the\nactor can do is to give us his. We must take that one for granted, we\nmake him a present of it. He must impose his conception upon us--\n\nAuberon (interrupting). I thought you said we accepted it.\n\nDorriforth. Impose it upon our _attention_. clever Auberon. It is\nbecause we accept his idea that he must repay us by making it vivid, by\nshowing us how valuable it is. We give him a watch: he must show us what\ntime it keeps. He winds it up, that is he executes the conception, and\nhis execution is what we criticise, if we be so moved. Can anything be\nmore absurd than to hear people discussing the conception of a part of\nwhich the execution doesn't exist--the idea of a character which never\narrives at form? Think what it is, that form, as an accomplished actor\nmay give it to us, and admit that we have enough to do to hold him to\nthis particular honor.\n\nAuberon. Do you mean to say you don't think some conceptions are better\nthan some others?\n\nDorriforth. Most assuredly, some are better: the proof of the pudding\nis in the eating. The best are those which yield the most points,\nwhich have the largest face; those, in other words, that are the most\ndemonstrable, or, in other words still, the most actable. The most\nintelligent performer is he who recognizes most surely this \"actable\"\nand distinguishes in it the more from the less. But we are so far from\nbeing in possession of a subjective pattern to which we have a right to\nhold him that he is entitled directly to contradict any such absolute by\npresenting us with different versions of the same text, each completely\ncolored, completely consistent with itself. Every actor in whom the\nartistic life is strong must often feel the challenge to do that. I\nshould never think, for instance, of contesting an actress's right to\nrepresent Lady Macbeth as a charming, insinuating woman, if she really\nsees the figure that way. I may be surprised at such a vision; but so\nfar from being scandalized, I am positively thankful for the extension\nof knowledge, of pleasure, that she is able to open to me.\n\nAuberon. A reading, as they say, either commends itself to one's sense\nof truth or it doesn't. In the one case--\n\nDorriforth. In the one case I recognize--even--or especially--when the\npresumption may have been against the particular attempt, a consummate\nillustration of what art can do. In the other I moralize indulgently\nupon human rashness.\n\nFlorentia. You have an assurance _\u00c3\u00a0 taute \u00c3\u00a9preuve_; but you are\ndeplorably superficial. There is a whole group of plays and a whole\ncategory of acting to which your generalizations quite fail to apply.\nHelp me, Auberon.\n\nAuberon. You're easily exhausted. I suppose she means that it's far from\ntrue everywhere that the scenery is everything. It may be true--I don't\nsay it is!--of two or three good-natured playhouses in London. It isn't\ntrue--how can it be?--of the provincial theatres or of the others in the\ncapital. Put it even that they would be all scenery if they could; they\ncan't, poor things--so they have to provide acting.\n\nDorriforth. They have to, fortunately; but what do we hear of it?\n\nFlorentia. How do you mean, what do we hear of it?\n\nDorriforth. In what trumpet of fame does it reach us? They do what they\ncan, the performers Auberon alludes to, and they are brave souls. But I\nam speaking of the conspicuous cases, of the exhibitions that draw.\n\nFlorentia. There is good acting that draws; one could give you names and\nplaces.\n\nDorriforth. I have already guessed those you mean. But when it isn't\ntoo much a matter of the paraphernalia it is too little a matter of\nthe play. A play nowadays is a rare bird. I should like to see \u00c2\u00a6 one.\nFlorentia. There are lots of them, all the while--the newspapers talk\nabout them. People talk about them at dinners.\n\nDorriforth. What do they say about them?\n\nFlorentia. The newspapers?\n\nDorriforth. No, I don't care for _them_. The people at dinners.\n\nFlorentia. Oh. they don't say anything in particular.\n\nDorriforth. Doesn't that seem to show the effort isn't very suggestive?\n\nAmicia. The conversation at dinners certainly isn't.\n\nDorriforth. I mean our contemporary drama. To begin with, you can't find\nit there's no text.\n\nFlorentia. No text?\n\nAuberon. So much the better!\n\nDorriforth. So much the better if there is to be no criticism. There\nis only a dirt prompter's book. One can't put one's hand upon it; one\ndoesn't know what one is discussing. There is no \"authority\"--nothing is\never published.\n\nAmicia. The pieces wouldn't bear that.\n\nDorriforth. It would be a small ordeal to resist--if there were anything\nin them. Look at the novels!\n\nAmicia. The text is the French _brochure_. The \"adaptation\" is\nunprintable.\n\nDorriforth. That's where it's so wrong, It ought at least to be as good\nas the original.\n\nAuberon. Aren't there some \"rights\" to protect--some risk of the play\nbeing stolen if it's published?\n\nDorriforth. There may be--I don't know. Doesn't that only prove how\nlittle important we regard the drama as being, and how little seriously\nwe take it, if we won't even trouble ourselves to bring about decent\ncivil conditions for its existence? What have we to do with the French\n_brochure?_ how does that help us to represent our own life, our\nmanners, our customs, our ideas, our English types, our English world?\nSuch a field for comedy, for tragedy, for portraiture, for satire,\nas they all make-such subjects as they would yield! Think of London\nalone--what a matchless hunting-ground for the satirist--the most\nmagnificent that ever was. If the occasion always produced the man\nLondon would have produced an Aristophanes. But somehow it doesn't.\n\nFlorentia. Oh, types and ideas, Aristophanes and satire--!\n\nDorriforth. I'm too ambitious, you mean? I shall presently show you\nthat I'm not ambitious at all. Everything makes against that--I am only\nreading the signs.\n\nAuberon. The plays are arranged to be as English as possible: they are\naltered, they are fitted.\n\nDorriforth. Fitted? Indeed they are, and to the capacity of infants.\nThey are in too many cases made vulgar, puerile, barbarous. They are\nneither fish nor flesh, and with all the point that's left out and all\nthe na\u00c3\u00afvet\u00c3\u00a9 that's put in, they cease to place before us any coherent\nappeal or any recognizable society.\n\nAuberon. They often make good plays to act, all the same.\n\nDorriforth. They may; but they don't make good plays to see or to hear.\nThe theatre consists of two things, _que diable_--of the stage and the\ndrama, and I don't see how you can have it unless you have both, or how\nyou can have either unless you have the other. They are the two blades\nof a pair of scissors.\n\nAuberon. You are very unfair to native talent. There are lots of\n_strictly original_ plays--\n\nAmicia. Yes, they put that expression on the posters.\n\nAuberon. I don't know what they put on the posters; but the plays are\nwritten and acted--produced with great success.\n\nDorriforth. Produced--partly. A play isn't fully produced until it is in\na form in which you can refer to it. We have to talk in the air. I can\nrefer to my Congreve, but I can't to my Pinero. {*}\n\n     * Since the above was written several of Mr. Pinero's plays\n       have been published.\n\nFlorentia. The authors are not bound to publish them if they don't wish.\n\nDorriforth. Certainly not, nor are they in that case bound to insist on\none's not being a little vague about them. They are perfectly free to\nwithhold them; they may have very good reasons for it, and I can imagine\nsome that would be excellent and worthy of all respect. But their\nwithholding them is one of the signs.\n\nAuberon. What signs?\n\nDorriforth. Those I just spoke of--those we are trying to read together.\nThe signs that ambition and desire are folly, that the sun of the drama\nhas set, that the matter isn't worth talking about, that it has ceased\nto be an interest for serious folk, and that everything--everything, I\nmean, that's anything--is over. The sooner we recognize it the sooner to\nsleep, the sooner we get clear of misleading illusions and are purged\nof the bad blood that disappointment makes. It's a pity, because the\ntheatre--after every allowance is made--_might_ have been a fine thing.\nAt all events it was a pleasant--it was really almost a noble--dream.\n_Requiescat!_\n\nFlorentia. I see nothing to confirm your absurd theory. I delight in the\nplay; more people than ever delight in it with me; more people than ever\ngo to it, and there are ten theatres in London where there were two of\nold.\n\nDorriforth. Which is what was to demonstrated. Whence do they derive\ntheir nutriment?\n\nAuberon. Why, from the enormous public.\n\nDorriforth. My dear fellow, I'm not talking of the box-office. What\nwealth of dramatic, of histrionic production have we to meet that\nenormous demand? There will be twenty theatres ten years hence where\nthere are ten to-day, and there will be, no doubt, ten times as many\npeople \"delighting in them,\" like Florentla. But it won't alter the fact\nthat our dream will have been dreamed. Florentia said a word when we\ncame in which alone speaks volumes.\n\nFlorentia. What was my word?\n\nAuberon. You are sovereignly unjust to native talent among the actors--I\nleave the dramatists alone. There are many who do excellent, independent\nwork; strive for perfection, completeness--in short, the things we want.\n\nDorriforth. I am not in the least unjust to them--I only pity them: they\nhave so little to put _sous la dent_. It must seem to them at times\nthat no one will work for them, that they are likely to starve for\nparts--forsaken of gods and men.\n\nFlorentia. If they work, then, in solitude and sadness, they have the\nmore honor, and one should recognize more explicitly their great merit.\n\nDorriforth. Admirably said. Their laudable effort is precisely the one\nlittle loop-hole that I see of escape from the general doom. Certainly\nwe must try to enlarge it--that small aperture into the blue. We must\nfix our eyes on it and make much of it, exaggerate it, do anything with\nit tha may contribute to restore a working faith. Precious that must be\nto the sincere spirits on the stage who are conscious of all the other\nthings--formidable things--that rise against them.\n\nAmicia. What other things do you mean?\n\nDorriforth. Why, for one thing, the grossness and brutality of\nLondon, with its scramble, its pressure, its hustle of engagements, of\npreoccupations, its long distances, its late hours, its nightly dinners,\nits innumerable demands on the attention, its general congregation of\ninfluences fatal to the isolation, to the punctuality, to the security,\nof the dear old playhouse spell. When Florentia said in her charming\nway--\n\nFlorentia. Here's my dreadful speech at last.\n\nDorriforth. When you said that you went to the Th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre Libre in the\nafternoon because you couldn't spare an evening, I recognized the\ndeath-knell of the drama. _Time_, the very breath of its nostrils,\nis lacking. Wagner was clever to go to leisurely Bayreuth among the\nhills--the Bayreuth of spacious days, a paradise of \"development.\"\n\nTalk to a London audience of \"development!\" The long runs would, if\nnecessary, put the whole question into a nutshell. Figure to yourself,\nfor then the question is answered, how an intelligent actor must loathe\nthem, and what a cruel negation he must find in them of the artistic\nlife, the life of which the very essence is variety of practice,\nfreshness of experiment, and to feel that one must do many things in\nturn to do any one of them completely.\n\nAuberon. I don't in the least understand your _acharnement_, in view of\nthe vagueness of your contention.\n\nDorriforth. My _acharnement_ is your little joke, and my contention is a\nlittle lesson in philosophy.\n\nFlorentia. I prefer a lesson in taste. I had one the other night at the\n\"Merry Wives.\"\n\nDorriforth. If you come to that, so did I!\n\nAmicia. So she does spare an evening sometimes.\n\nFlorentia. It was all extremely quiet and comfortable, and I don't\nin the least recognize Dorriforth's lurid picture of the dreadful\nconditions. There was no scenery--at least not too much; there was just\nenough, and it was very pretty, and it was in its place.\n\nDorriforth. And what else was there?\n\nFlorentia. There was very good acting.\n\nAmicia. I also went, and I thought it all, for a sportive, wanton thing,\nquite painfully ugly.\n\nAuberon. Uglier than that ridiculous black room, with the invisible\npeople groping about in it, of your precious \"Duc d'Enghien?\"\n\nDorriforth. The black room is doubtless not the last word of art, but it\nstruck me as a successful application of a happy idea. The contrivance\nwas perfectly simple--a closer night effect than is usually attempted,\nwith a few guttering candles, which threw high shadows over the bare\nwalls, on the table of the court-martial. Out of the gloom came the\nvoices and tones of the distinguishable figures, and it is perhaps a\nfancy of mine that it made them--given the situation, of course--more\nimpressive and dramatic.\n\nAuberon. You rail against scenery, but what could belong more to the\norder of things extraneous to what you perhaps a little priggishly call\nthe delicacy of personal art than the arrangement you are speaking of?\n\nDorriforth. I was talking of the abuse of scenery. I never said anything\nso idiotic as that the effect isn't helped by an appeal to the eye and\nan adumbration of the whereabouts.\n\nAuberon. But where do you draw the line and fix the limit? What is the\nexact dose?\n\nDorriforth. It's a question of taste and tact.\n\nFlorentia. And did you find taste and tact in that coal-hole of the\nTh\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre Libre?\n\nDorriforth. Coal-hole is again your joke. I found a strong impression\nin it--an impression of the hurried, extemporized cross-examination, by\nnight, of an impatient and mystified prisoner, whose dreadful fate had\nbeen determined in advance, who was to be shot, high-handedly, in\nthe dismal dawn. The arrangement didn't worry and distract me: it was\nsimplifying, intensifying. It gave, what a judicious _mise-en-sc\u00c3\u00a8ne_\nshould always do, the essence of the matter, and left the embroidery to\nthe actors.\n\nFlorentia. At the \"Merry Wives,\" where you could see your hand before\nyour face, I could make out the embroidery.\n\nDorriforth. Could you, under Falstaff's pasteboard cheeks and the sad\ndisfigurement of his mates? There was no excess of scenery, Auberon\nsays. Why, Falstaff's very person was nothing _but_ scenery. A false\nface, a false figure, false hands, false legs--scarcely a square inch on\nwhich the irrepressible humor of the rogue could break into illustrative\ntouches. And he is so human, so expressive, of so rich a physiognomy.\nOne would rather Mr. Beerbohm Tree should have played the part in his\nown clever, elegant slimness---that would at least have represented\nlife. A Falstaff all \"make-up\" is an opaque substance. This seems to me\nan example of what the rest still more suggested, that in dealing with a\nproduction like the \"Merry Wives\" really the main quality to put\nforward is discretion. You must resolve such a production, as a thing\nrepresented, into a tone that the imagination can take an aesthetic\npleasure in. Its grossness must be transposed, as it were, to a fictive\nscale, a scale of fainter tints and generalized signs. A filthy,\neruptive, realistic Bardolph and Pistol overlay the romantic with the\nliteral. Relegate them and blur them, to the eye; let their blotches be\nconstructive and their raggedness relative.\n\nAmicia. Ah, it was _so_ ugly!\n\nDorriforth. What a pity then, after all, there wasn't more painted\ncanvas to divert you! Ah, decidedly, the theatre of the future must be\nthat.\n\nFlorentia. Please remember your theory that our life's a scramble, and\nsuffer me to go and dress for dinner.\n\n1889.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Picture and Text, by Henry James\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PICTURE AND TEXT ***\n\n***** This file should be named 25767-8.txt or 25767-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/2\/5\/7\/6\/25767\/\n\nProduced by David Widger\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":802,"split":"train"}
