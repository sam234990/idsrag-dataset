{"ori_id":"b71990cf4e30e2025d852c794b9f259e84d472cb","title":"Cripps the Carrier","context":"Cripps the Carrier\n The story is set in the 1830s in rural Oxfordshire. The main thread of the narrative follows the fortunes or misfortunes of Grace Oglander, the daughter of an Oxfordshire Squire. She is borne off from the residence of her aunt by the machinations of a villainous attorney, who entraps her into his power by the expedient of a forged letter from her father. The latter, anxiously expecting his daughter's return, receives by the carrier a sack of potatoes, and in it a long coil of bright golden hair, accompanied by the brutal superscription\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"All you will ever see of her.\" Scarcely a doubt remains in his mind as to the fate of poor Grace, and his fears are confirmed by the testimony of Esther Cripps, the carrier's sister, who, in a belated walk, is the witness of a ghastly deed\u00e2\u0080\u0094the burial of the uncoffined body of a young girl in a ravine called the \"Gipsy's Grave.\" Grace herself is in the meantime safely ensconced in the depths of the Oxford forest under the care of Miss Patch, the governess, and makes such good use of her natural gifts that she enthrals the heart of Kit Sharp, the attorney's son. For him, both she and her large fortune were designed by his unscrupulous father; but an unforeseen difficulty is interposed by the traitorous conduct of Kit himself. When he discovers that the girl is not an American, as he was led to suppose, but the daughter of Squire Oglander, he resolves to restore her to her father's roof; and this he succeeds in doing with the timely assistance of \"Cripps the Carrier.\"\nThe story describes the flight of Grace Oglander and her new protector, the conflict between father and son, and the eventual rescue of the maiden by the carrier. The attorney strikes his son dead, as he thinks, and then appropriately closes his career by blowing his own brains out in the forest.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, Cripps, the Carrier, by R.

This wood or forest (now broken up into many\nstraggling copses) spread in the olden time across the main breadth of\nthe highland to the north of Headington, between the valley of the\nCherwell and the bogs of Otmoor. Beckley itself, though once\napproached by the Roman road from Alchester, must for many a century\nhave nursed its rural quietude, withdrawn as it was from the\nstage-waggon track from High Wycombe to Chipping Norton, through\nWheatley, Islip, and Bletchingdon, and lying in a tangle of narrow\nlanes leading only to one another. So Beckley took that cheerful view\nof life which enabled the fox to disdain the blandishments of the\nvintage, and prided itself on its happy seclusion and untutored\nhonesty.\n\nBut as all sons of Adam must have something or other to say to the\nrest, and especially to his daughters, this little village carried on\nsome commerce with the outer world; and did it through a carrier.\n\nThe name of this excellent man was Cripps; and the Carrier's mantle,\nor woolsey coat, had descended on this particular Cripps from many\ngenerations. All the Cripps family had a habit of adding largely to\ntheir number in every generation. In this they resembled most other\nfamilies which have to fight the world, and therefore recruit their\nforces zealously; but in one great point they were very distinct--they\nagreed among one another. And ever since roads were made, or rather\nlanes began trying to make themselves, one great tradition had\nconfirmed the dynasty of Crippses.\n\nThis was that the eldest son should take the carrying business; the\nsecond son (upon first avoidance) should have the baker's shop in\nOxford over against old Balliol College; the third should have the\nqueer old swine-farm in the heart of Stow Forest; the fourth should be\nthe butcher of Beckley, and the fifth its shoemaker. If ever it\npleased the Lord to proceed with the masculine fork of the family (as\nhad happened several times), the sixth boy and the rest were expected\nto start on their travels, when big enough. As for the girls, the\nCarrier, being the head of the family, and holding the house and the\nstable and cart, was bound to take the maids, one by one, to and fro\nunder his tilt twice a week, till the public fell in love with them.\n\nNow, so many things come cross and across in the countless ins and\nouts of life, that even the laws of the Crippses failed sometimes, in\nsome jot or tittle. Still there they stuck, and strong cause was\nneeded ere they could be departed from. Of course the side-shoots of\nthe family (shoemakers' sons, and so on) were not to be bound by this\ngreat code, however ambitious to be so. To deal with such rovers is\nnot our duty. Our privilege is to trace the strict succession of the\nCrippses, the deeds of the Carrier now on the throne and his second\nbest brother, the baker, with a little side-peep at the man on the\nfarm, and a shy desire to be very delicate to the last unmarried\n\"female.\"\n\nThe present head of the family, Zacchary Cripps, the Beckley carrier,\nunder the laws of time (which are even stricter than the Cripps'\ncode), was crossing the ridge of manhood towards the western side of\nforty, without providing the due successor to the ancestral\ndriving-board. Public opinion was already beginning to exclaim at him;\nand the man who kept the chandler's shop, with a large small family to\nmaintain, was threatening to make the most of this, and set up his own\neldest son on the road; though \"dot and carry one\" was all he knew\nabout the business. Zacchary was not a likely man to be at all upset\nby this; but rather one of a tarrying order, as his name might\nindicate.\n\nTruly intelligent families living round about the city of Oxford had,\nand even to this day have, a habit of naming their male babies after\nthe books of the Bible, in their just canonical sequence; while\ninfants of the better sex are baptized into the Apocrypha, or even the\nEpistles. So that Zacchary should have been \"Genesis,\" only his father\nhad suffered such pangs of mind at being cut down, by the\never-strengthening curtness of British diction, into \"Jenny Cripps,\"\nthat he laid his thumb to the New Testament when his first man-child\nwas born to him, and finding a father in like case, quite relieved of\nresponsibility, took it for a good sign, and applied his name\ntriumphantly.\n\nBut though the eldest born was thus transferred into the New\nTestament, the second son reverted to the proper dispensation; and the\none who went into the baker's shop was Exodus, as he ought to be. The\nchildren of the former Exodus were turned out testamentarily, save\nthose who were needed to carry the bread out till their cousin's boys\nshould be big enough.\n\nAll of these doings were right enough, and everybody approved of them.\nLeviticus Cripps was the lord of the swine, and Numbers bore the\ncleaver, while Deuteronomy stuck to his last, when the public-house\ncould spare him. There was only one more brother of the dominant\ngeneration, whose name was \"Pentachook,\" for thus they pronounced the\ncollective eponym, and he had been compendiously kicked abroad, to\nseek his own fortune, right early.\n\nBut as for the daughters (who took their names from the best women of\nthe Apocrypha, and sat up successively under the tilt until they were\ndisposed of), for the moment it is enough to say that all except one\nwere now forth and settled. Some married farmers, some married\ntradesmen, one took a miller's eldest son, one had a gentleman more or\nless, but all with expectations. Only the youngest was still in the\ntilt, a very pretty girl called Esther.\n\nAll Beckley declared that Esther's heart had been touched by a College\nlad, who came some five years since to lodge with Zacchary for the\nlong vacation, and was waited on by this young girl, supposed to be\nthen unripe for dreaming of the tender sentiment. That a girl of only\nfifteen summers should allow her thoughts to stray, contrary to all\ncommon sense and her duty to her betters, for no other reason (to\nanybody's knowledge) than that a young man ate and drank with less\nnoise than the Crippses, and went on about the moonlight and the\nstars, and the rubbishy things in the hedges--that a child like that\nshould know no better than to mix what a gentleman said with his inner\nmeaning--put it right or left, it showed that something was amiss with\nher. However, the women would say no more until it was pulled out of\nthem. To mix or meddle with the Crippses was like putting one's\nfingers into a steel trap.\n\nWith female opinion in this condition, and eager to catch at anything,\nMrs. Exodus Cripps, in Oxford, was confined rather suddenly. She had\nkneaded a batch of two sacks of flour, to put it to rise for the\nmorning, and her husband (who should not have let her do it) was\nsmoking a pipe, and exciting her. Nevertheless, it would not have\nharmed her (as both the doctor and the midwife said) if only she had\nkept herself from arguing while about it. But, somehow or other, her\nhusband said a thing she could not agree with, and the strength of her\nreason went the other way, and it served him right that he had to rush\noff in his slippers to the night-bell.\n\nOn the next day, although things were quite brought round, and the\nworld was the richer by the addition of another rational animal, Mr.\nExodus sent up the crumpet-boy all the way from Broad Street in Oxford\nto Beckley, to beg and implore Miss Esther Cripps to come down and\nattend to the caudle. And the crumpet-boy, being short of breath,\nbecame so full of power that the Carrier scarcely knew what to do in\nthe teeth of so urgent a message. For he had made quite a pet of his\nyoungest sister, and the twenty years of age betwixt them stopped the\ngap of rivalry. It was getting quite late in the afternoon when the\ncrumpet-boy knocked at the Carrier's door, because he had met upon\nMagdalen Bridge a boy who owed him twopence; and eager as he was to\nfulfil his duty, a sense of justice to himself compelled him to do his\nbest to get it. His knowledge of the world was increased by the\nfailure of this Utopian vision, for the other boy offered to toss him\n\"double or quits,\" and having no specie, borrowed poor Crumpy's last\npenny to do it; then, being defeated in the issue, he cast the young\nbaker's cap over the bridge, and made off at fine speed with his coin\nof the realm. What other thing could Crumpy do than attempt to outvie\nhis activity? In a word, he chased him as far as Carfax, with\nwell-winged feet and sad labour of lungs, but Mercury laughed at\nAstr\u00c3\u00a6a, and Crumpy had a very distant view of fivepence. Recording a\nhighly vindictive vow, he scratched his bare head, and set forth\nagain, being further from Beckley than at his first start.\n\nIt certainly was an unlucky thing that the day of the week should be\nTuesday--Tuesday, the 19th of December, 1837. For Zacchary always had\nto make his rounds on a Wednesday and a Saturday, and if he were to\ndrive his poor old Dobbin into Oxford on a Tuesday evening, how could\nhe get through his business to-morrow? For Dobbin insisted on a day in\nstable whenever he had been in Oxford. He was full of the air of the\nlaziest place, and perhaps the most delightful, in the world. He\ndespised all the horses of low agriculture after that inspiration, and\nhe sighed out sweet grunts at the colour of his straw, instead of\ngetting up the next morning.\n\nZacchary Cripps was a thoughtful man, as well as a very kind-hearted\none. In the crown of his hat he always carried a monthly calendar\ngummed on cardboard, and opposite almost every day he had dots, or\nround O's, or crosses. Each of these to his very steady mind meant\nsomething not to be neglected; and being (as time went) a pretty fair\nscholar--ere School Boards destroyed true scholarship--with the help\nof his horse he could make out nearly every place he had to call at.\nSo now he looked at the crumpet-boy, to receive and absorb his\nexcitement, and then he turned to young Esther, and let her speak\nfirst, as she always liked to do.\n\n\"Oh, please to go back quite as fast as you can,\" said Esther to the\nCrumpy, \"and say that I shall be there before you; or, at any rate, as\nsoon as you are. And, Crumpy, there ought to be something for you.\nDear Zak, have you got twopence?\"\n\n\"Not I,\" said the Carrier, \"and if I had, it would do him a deal more\nharm than good. Run away down the hill, my lad, and you come to me at\nthe Golden Cross, perhaps as soon as Saturday, and I'll look in my bag\nfor a halfpenny. Run away, boy; run away, or the bogies will be after\nyou.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nTHE SWING OF THE PICKAXE.\n\n\nThe baker's boy felt that his luck was askew upon this day of his\nexistence, for Carrier Cripps was vexed so much at this sudden demand\nfor his sister that he never even thought of asking the boy to have a\nglass of home-brewed ale.\n\n\"Zak, what made you send the boy away?\" Esther asked, when she came\ndownstairs, with her bonnet and short cloak on. \"Of course, I am very\nfoolish; but he would have been some little company.\"\n\n\"There, now, I never thought of it! I am doiled, a do believe,\nsometimes. Tramp with you to the Bar mysell, I wull. Sarve me right\nfor a-doin' of it.\"\n\n\"Indeed, then, you won't,\" she answered firmly. \"There's a hard day's\nwork for you, Zak, to-morrow, with all the Christmas parcels, and your\ntouch of rheumatics so bad last week.\"\n\n\"Why, bless the cheeld, I be as hearty as ever!\"\n\n\"Of course you are, Zak; of course you are, and think nought of a sack\nof potatoes. But if you declare to come with me one step, backward is\nthe only step I take.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" said the Carrier, glad on the whole to escape a long\nwalk and keep conscience clear; \"when you say a thing, Etty, what good\nis it? Round these here parts none would harm 'ee. And none of they\nfurriners be about just now.\"\n\n\"Good-night, Zak, good-night, dear,\" cried Esther, to shorten\ndeparture, for Cripps was a man of a slow turn of mind, and might go\non for an hour or two; \"I shall sleep there to-night, of course, and\nmeet you at the Golden Cross to-morrow. When had I best be there?\"\n\n\"Well, you know better than I do. It might be one o'clock, or it might\nbe two, or it might be half-past three a'most. All you have to do is\nthis--to leave word at the bar with Sally Brown.\"\n\n\"I shall do nothing of the sort,\" she answered; \"I don't like bars,\nand I don't like Miss Brown. I shall look in the yard for the cart,\nbrother.\"\n\n\"You'll do pretty much as you like. That much a may be cock-sure of.\"\nBut before he could finish his exposition of his sister's character,\nshe was out of sight; and he dropped his grumble, and doubted his mind\nabout letting her go. Nor that any one at all of the neighbourhood\nwould hurt her; but that there had been much talk about a camp of\ndark-skinned people in Cowley Marsh, not long ago. Therefore he laid\nhis palm flat from his eyebrows, to follow the distance further; and\nseeing no more than the hedges of the lane (now growing in the cold\nwind naked) and the track of the lane (from wet mud slaking into\nlight-coloured crustiness), without any figures, or sound, or shadow,\nor sense of life moving anywhere--he made for the best side of his\ncottage-door, and brightened up the firelight.\n\nThe weather had been for some few weeks in a good constitutional\nEnglish state; that is to say, it had no settled tendency towards\nanything. Or at any rate, so it seemed to people who took little heed\nof it. There had been a little rain, and then a little snow, and a\ntouch of frost, and then a sample of fog, and so on: trying all\nvarieties, to suit the British public. True Britons, however, had\ngrumbled duly at each successive overture; so that the winter was now\nresolving henceforth only to please itself. And this determined will\nwas in the wind, the air, and the earth itself, just when night began\nto fall on this dark day of December.\n\nAs Esther turned the corner from the Beckley lane into the road, the\nbroad coach road to Oxford, she met a wind that knew its mind coming\nover the crest of Shotover, a stern east wind that whistled sadly over\nthe brown and barren fields, and bitterly piped in the roadway. To the\nchill of this blast the sere oak-leaves shivered in the dusk and\nrattled; the grey ash saplings bent their naked length to get away\nfrom it; and the surly stubs of the hedge went to and fro to one\nanother. The slimy dips of the path began to rib themselves, like the\nfronds of fern, and to shrink into wrinkles and sinewy knobs; while\nthe broader puddles, though skirred by the breeze, found the network\nof ice veiling over them. This, as it crusted, began to be capable of\na consistent quivering, with a frail infinitude of spikelets, crossing\nand yet carrying into one another. And the cold work (marred every now\nand then by the hurry of the wind that urged it) in the main was going\non so fast, that the face of the water ceased to glisten, and instead\nof ruffling lifted, and instead of waving wavered. So that, as the\nsurface trembled, any level eye might see little splinters (held as\nare the ribs and harl of feathers) spreading, and rising like stems of\nlace, and then with a smooth, crisp jostle sinking, as the wind flew\nover them, into the quavering consistence of a coverlet of ice.\n\nEsther Cripps took little heed of these things, or of any other in the\nmatter of weather, except to say to herself now and then how bitter\ncold the wind was, and that she feared it would turn to snow, and how\nshe longed to be sitting with a cup of \"Aunt Exie's\" caudle in the\nsnug room next to the bakehouse, or how glad she would be to get only\nas far as the first house of St. Clement's, to see the lamps and the\nlights in the shops, and be quit of this dreary loneliness. For now it\nmust be three market days since fearful rumours began to stir in\nseveral neighbouring villages, which made even strong men discontent\nwith solitude towards nightfall; and as for the women--just now poor\nEsther would rather not think of what they declared. It was all very\nwell to pretend to doubt it while hanging the clothes out, or turning\nthe mangle; but as for laughing out here in the dark, and a mile away\nfrom the nearest house--Good Lord! How that white owl frightened her!\n\nBeing a sensible and brave girl, she forced her mind as well as she\ncould into another channel, and lifted the cover of the basket in\nwhich she had some nice things for \"Aunt Exie,\" and then she set off\nfor a bold little run, until she was out of breath, and trembling at\nthe sound of her own light feet. For though all the Crippses were\nknown to be of a firm and resolute fibre, who could expect a young\nmaid like this to tramp on like a Roman sentinel?\n\nAnd a lucky thing for her it was that she tried nothing of the sort,\nbut glided along with her heart in her mouth, and her short skirt\ntucked up round her. Lucky also for her that the ground (which she so\nlittle heeded, and so wanted to get over) was in that early stage of\nfreezing, or of drying to forestall frost, in which it deadens sound\nas much as the later stage enlivens it, otherwise it is doubtful\nwhether she would have seen the Christmas-dressing of the shops in\nOxford.\n\nFor, a little further on, she came, without so much as a cow in the\nroad or a sheep in a field for company, to a dark narrow place, where\nthe way hung over the verge of a stony hollow, an ancient pit which\nhad once been worked as part of the quarries of Headington. This had\nlong been of bad repute as a haunted and ill-omened place; and even\nthe Carrier himself, strong and resolute as he was, felt no shame in\nwhispering when he passed by in the moonlight. And the name of the\nplace was the \"Gipsy's Grave.\" Therefore, as Esther Cripps approached\nit, she was half inclined to wait and hide herself in a bush or gap\nuntil a cart or waggon should come down the hill behind her, or an\nhonest dairyman whistling softly to reassure his shadow, or even a\nwoman no braver than herself.\n\nBut neither any cart came near, nor any other kind of company, only\nthe violence of the wind, and the keen increase of the frost-bite. So\nthat the girl made up her mind to put the best foot foremost, and run\nthrough her terrors at such a pace that none of them could lay hold of\nher.\n\nThrough yards of darkness she skimmed the ground, in haste only to be\nrid of it, without looking forward, or over her shoulders, or\nanywhere, when she could help it. And now she was ready to laugh at\nherself and her stupid fears, as she caught through the trees a\nglimpse of the lights of Oxford, down in the low land, scarcely more\nthan a mile and a half away from her. In the joy of relief she was\nready to jump and pant without fear of the echoes, when suddenly\nsomething caught her ears.\n\nThis was not a thing at first to be at all afraid of, but only just\nenough to rouse a little curiosity. It seemed to be nothing more nor\nless than the steady stroke of a pickaxe. The sound came from the\nfurther corner of the deserted quarry, where a crest of soft and\nshingly rock overhung a briary thicket. Any person working there would\nbe quite out of sight from the road, by reason of the bend of the\nhollow.\n\nThe blow of the tool came dull and heavy on the dark and frosty wind;\nand Esther almost made up her mind to run on, and take no heed of it.\nAnd so she would have done, no doubt, if she had not been a Cripps\ngirl. But in this family firm and settled opinions had been handed\ndown concerning the rights of property--the rights that overcome all\nwrongs, and outlive death. The brother Leviticus of Stow Wood had sown\na piece of waste at the corner of the clevice with winter carrots for\nhis herd of swine. The land being none of his thus far, his right so\nto treat it was not established, and therefore likely to be attacked\nby any rapacious encroacher. Esther felt all such things keenly, and\nresolved to find out what was going on.\n\nTo this intent she gathered in the skirt of her frock and the fulling\nof her cloak, and fending the twigs from her eyes and bonnet, quietly\nslipped through a gap in the hedge. For she knew that a steep track,\ntrodden by children in the blackberry season, led from this gap to the\ndeep and tangled bottom of the quarry. With care and fear she went\nsoftly down, and followed the curve of the hollow.\n\nThe heavy sound of the pickaxe ceased, as she came near and nearer,\nand the muttering of rough voices made her shrink into a nook and\nlisten.\n\n\"Tell 'ee, I did see zummat moving,\" said a man, whom she could dimly\nmake out on the beetling ridge above her, by the light of the clearing\neastern sky; \"a zummat moving down yonner, I tell 'ee.\"\n\n\"No patience, I han't no patience with 'ee,\" answered a taller man\ncoming forward, and speaking with a guttural twang, as if the roof of\nhis mouth were imperfect. \"Skeary Jem is your name and nature. Give me\nthe pick if thee beest aveared. Is this job to be finished to-night,\nor not?\"\n\nThe answer was only a growl or an oath, and the swing of the tool\nbegan again, while Esther's fright grew hot, and thumped in her heart,\nand made her throat swell. It was all she could do to keep quiet\nbreath, and prevent herself from screaming; for something told her\nthat she was watching a darker crime than theft of roots or robbery of\na sheepfold.\n\nIn a short or a long time--she knew not which--as she still lay hid\nand dared not show her face above the gorse-tuft, a sound of sliding\nand falling shale heavily shook her refuge. She drew herself closer,\nand prayed to the Lord, and clasped her hands before her eyes, and\ncowered, expecting to be killed at least. And then she peeped forth,\nto know what it was about. She never had harmed any mortal body; why\nshould she be frightened so?\n\nIn the catch of the breath which comes when sudden courage makes gulp\nat uncertainty, she lifted herself by a stiff old root, to know the\nvery worst of it. Better almost to be killed and be done with, than\nbear the heart-pang of this terrible fear. And there she saw a thing\nthat struck her so aback with amazement, that every timid sense was\nmute.\n\nWhether the sky began to shed a hovering light, or the girl's own eyes\nspread and bred a power of vision from their nervous dilation--at any\nrate, she saw in the darkness what she had not seen till now. It was\nthe body of a young woman (such a body as herself might be), lying,\nonly with white things round it, in the black corner, with gravel and\nearth and pieces of rock rolling down on it. There was nothing to\nfrighten a sensible person now that the worst was known perhaps.\nEverybody must be buried at some time. Why should she be frightened\nso?\n\nHowever, Esther Cripps fell faint, and lay in that state long enough\nfor tons of burying rock to fall, and secret buryers to depart.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nOAKLEAF POTATOES.\n\n\n\"Of all slow people in this slow place, I am quite certain that there\nis none so slow as Cripps, the Carrier.\"\n\nThis \"hot spache,\" as the patient Zacchary would perhaps have called\nit, passed the lips of no less a person than old Squire Oglander. He,\non the 20th day of December (the day after that we began with), was\nhurrying up and down the long straight walk of his kitchen garden, and\nrunning every now and then to a post of vantage, from which he could\nlook over the top of his beloved holly hedge, and make out some of the\nzigzags of the narrow lane from Beckley. A bitter black frost had now\nset in, and the Squire knew that if he wanted anything more fetched\nout of his ground, or anything new put into it, it might be weeks\nbefore he got another chance of doing it. So he made a good bustle,\nand stamped, and ran, and did all he could to arouse his men, who knew\nhim too well to concern themselves about any of his menaces.\n\n\"I tell you we are all caught napping, Thomas. I tell you we ought to\nbe ashamed of ourselves. The frost is an inch in the ground already.\nArtichokes, carrots, parsnips, beetroot, even horse-radish for our\nChristmas beef--and upon my soul, a row of potatoes never even dug\nyet! Unless I am after you at every corner--well, I am blessed if I\ndon't see our keeping onions!\"\n\n\"Now, measter, 'ee no call to be so grum! None of they things'll be a\nhaporth the worse. The frost'll ony swaten 'em.\"\n\n\"You zany, I know all your talk. Hold your tongue. Not a glass of beer\nwill I send out, if this is all I get for it. Sweeten them, indeed!\nAnd when we want them, are we to dig them with mattocks, pray? Or do\nyou thick-heads expect it to thaw to order, when the pot is bubbling?\nStir your lazy legs, or I'll throw every one of you on the work-house\nthe moment the first snow falls.\"\n\nThe three men grinned at one another, and proceeded leisurely. They\nknew much better than the Squire himself what his gentle nature was,\nand that he always expiated a scolding with a jug of beer.\n\n\"Man and boy,\" said the eldest of them, speaking below his breath, as\nif this tyranny had extinguished him; \"in this here gearden have I\nworked, man and boy, for threescore year, and always gi'en\nsatisfaction. Workuss! What would his father a' said, to hear tell in\nthis gearden of workuss? Workuss! Well, let un coom, if a will! Can't\nbe harder work, God knoweth.\"\n\n\"Tummuss, Tummuss, you may say that,\" said another lazy rascal,\nshaking his head, with his heel on his spade, and then wiping his\nforehead laboriously. \"'Tis the sweat of our brow, Tummuss, none of\n'em thinks on--but there, they was born to be driving of us!\"\n\nSquire Oglander made as if he heard them not; and then he hurried to\nthe hedge again, and stood on the wall of the leaf-mould pit, and\npeered over the beard of hollies. And this time he spied in the\ndistance Cripps, or at any rate the tilt of the Crippsian cart,\njogging sedately to the rhythm of the feet of Dobbin.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" cried the Squire, who was still as young in mind as if he\nhad no body. \"By George, we shall be just in time. Never mind what I\nsaid, my lads. I was a little bit cross, I know. Take out the crumbs\nfrom the bottom of your trenches, and go two inches deeper. Our new\npotatoes are come at last! Mary, come out with a gallon of ale.\"\n\nSquire Oglander, having retired now from the army and all warfare, was\nwarmly devoted to the arts of peace. Farming, planting, gardening,\nbreeding, training of dogs, and so on--all of these quiet delights\nfell softly on a very active mind, when the vigour of the body began\nto fail. He loved his farm, and he loved his garden, and all his\nattempts at improvement, and nothing better than to point out his own\nmistakes to rash admirers. But where is the pleasure of showing things\nto strangers who know nothing? The old man's grand delight of all was\nto astonish his own daughter, his only child, Grace Oglander.\n\nThis it was that made him work so hard at the present moment. He was\ndetermined to have his kitchen garden in first-rate winter order by\nthe time his daughter should come home from a visit to her aunt at\nCowley. Now this sister, Mrs. Fermitage, had promised to bring home\ntheir joint pet Gracie in time for the dinner at five o'clock that\nvery day, and to dine there with them; so that it was needful to look\nalive, and to make quick step of everything. Moreover, this good\nSquire had some little insight (as behoves a farmer and a sportsman)\ninto the ways and meaning of the weather of the neighbourhood. He knew\nas well as a short-tailed field-mouse that a long frost was coming.\nThe sharp dry rustle of the upturned leaves of holly and of ivy, the\nheavy stoop of the sullen sky, the patches of spaded mould already\nbrowning with powdery crispness, the upward shivering look of the\ngrass, and the loss of all gloss upon everything, and the shuddering\nrattle in the teeth of a man who opened his mouth to the wind at\nall--many other things than these, as well as all of them, were here;\nthat any man (not blind, or deaf, or choked in citied ignorance) might\nfall to at once, and dig every root of his potatoes.\n\nBut the strange thing, in this present matter, was that Squire\nOglander was bent not only on digging potatoes, but also on planting\nthem, this very day. Forsooth it was one of his fixed dates in the\nchronicles of the garden, that happen what might, or be the season\nwhatsoever it chose to be, new potatoes and peas he would have by the\nlast day of May, at the latest. And this without any ignoble resort to\nforcing-pit, hot-bed, or even cold frame; under the pure gaze of the\nsky, by that time they must be ready. Now, this may be easy at\nVentnor, or Penzance, or even Bournemouth; but in the highlands of\nOxfordshire it requires some skill and management. In the first place,\nboth pea and potato must be of a kind that is ready to awake right\nearly; and then they must be humoured with a very choice place; and\nafter that they must be shielded from the winter's rages. If all these\n\"musts\" can be complied with, and several \"ifs\" are solved aright, the\ngardener (eager as well as patient) may hope to get pleasure from his\nearly work.\n\nOf all men there was none perhaps more capable of hoping than this\ngood Squire Oglander. In his garden and his household, or among his\nfriends and neighbours, or the world at large, he not only tried to\nsee, but saw, the very best side of everything. When things fell out\namiss, he always looked very wise, and shook his head, and declared\nthat he had predicted them; and before very long he began to find out\nthat they were not so bad as they might have been. His ruddy face, and\nblue eyes, and sometimes decidedly waggish nose, as well as his crisp\nwhite hair, and way of standing to be looked at, let everybody know\nthat here was a man of no great pretension, yet true, and of kind and\nhappy heart, and fit to be relied upon. Ten thousand such may be found\nin England; and they cannot be too many.\n\n\"Inside and outside, all look alive!\" cried this gentleman, running to\nand fro: \"Gracie will be home; Miss Grace, I mean; and not a bit of\nfire in the drawing-room grate! No Christmas-boxes for any of you\nsluts! Now, I did not mean that, Mary, as you might know. Inside the\nwomen, and outside the men--now, what is this paper for, my dear?\"\n\n\"That there Cripps, sir, have a sent 'un in. He be gettin' so\npertikular!\"\n\n\"Quite right. Quite right. Business is business. No man can be too\nparticular. Let him sit down and have a pint of ale. He wants me to\nsign this paper, does he? Very well; tell him to come next week. My\nfingers are cramped with the wind. Tell Cripps--now, don't you be in\nsuch a hurry, Mary; Cripps is not a marrying man.\"\n\n\"As if I would touch him with a pair of tongs, sir! A Hookham to have\na Cripps, sir!--a man who always smells as if he had been a-combing of\na horse!\"\n\n\"Ah, poor Mary, the grapes are sour. Tell bachelor Cripps to send in\nthe bag. And bring me the little truck-basket, Mary; I dare say that\nwill hold them. Just in time, they are only just in time. To-morrow\nwould have been a day too late.\"\n\nThe Squire was to pay a guinea for this bushel of early oakleaf\npotatoes, a sort that was warranted to beat the ashleaf by a\nfortnight, and to crop tenfold as much. The bag had been sent by the\nHenley coach from a nursery near Maidenhead, and left at the Black\nHorse in St. Clement's, to be called for by the Beckley carrier.\n\n\"Stay now,\" cried the Squire; \"now I think of it we will unpack the\nbag in the brewery, Mary. They have had a fire there all the morning.\nAnd it will save making any mess in here. Miss Grace is coming, bless\nher heart! And she'll give it to me, if she finds any dirt.\"\n\n\"But, sir, if you please, Master Cripps now just is beginning of his\npint of ale. And he never hurrieth over that----\"\n\n\"Well, we don't want Cripps. We only want the bag. Jem will bring it\ninto the brewery, if you want to sit with Cripps. Cripps is tired, I\ndare say. These young men's legs are not fit for much. Stop--call old\nThomas; he's the best, after all. If I want a thing done, I come back\nto the old folk, after all.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, I don't think you have any reason to say that. Howsomever,\nhere cometh Mr. Kale. Mr. Kale, if you please, you be wanted.\"\n\nPresently Thomas Kale, the man who had worked so long in the garden\nthere, followed his master across the court, with the bag of potatoes\non his back. The weight was a trifle, of course, being scarcely over\nhalf a hundredweight; but Thomas was too old a hand to make too light\nof anything.\n\n\"I've knowed the time,\" he said, setting down the sack on the head of\nan empty barrel, \"when that there weight would have failed, you might\nsay, to crook my little finger. Now, make so bold--do you know the\nraison?\"\n\n\"Why, Thomas, we cannot expect to be always so young as we were once,\nyou know.\"\n\n\"Nout to do wi' it--less nor nout. The raison lie all in the vittels,\nmaister; the vittels is fallen from what they was.\"\n\n\"Thomas, you give me no peace with your victuals. You must groan to\nthe cook, not to me, about them. Now, cut the cord. Why, what has\nCripps been about?\"\n\nThe bag was made of a stout grey canvas, not so thick as sacking, and\nas the creases of the neck began to open, under the slackening cord,\nthree or four red stripes were shown, such as are sometimes to be\nfound in the neck of a leather mail-bag, when the postmaster has been\nin a hurry, and dropped his wax too plenteously. But the stripes in\nthese creases were not dry and brittle, as of run sealing-wax, but\nclammy and damp, as if some thick fluid had oozed from dripping\nfingers.\n\n\"I don't like the look of it,\" cried the old Squire. \"Cripps should be\nmore careful. He has left the bag down at his brother the butcher's. I\nam sure they never sent it out like this. Not that I am of a squeamish\norder, but still--good God! What is this that I see?\"\n\nWith scarcely time for his cheeks to blanch, or his firm old hands to\ntremble, Squire Oglander took from the mouth of the sack a coil of\nlong bright golden hair. The brown shade of the potatoes beneath it\nset off its glistening beauty. He knew it at a glance; there was no\nsuch hair in all Oxfordshire but his Gracie's. A piece of paper was\nroughly twisted in and out the shining wreath. This he spread in the\nhollow of his palm, and then put on his spectacles, and read by the\nwaning light these words, \"All you will ever see of her.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nCRIPPS IN A QUANDARY.\n\n\nWorth Oglander, now in his seventieth year, although he might be a\ntrifle fat, was a truly hale and active man. His limbs were as sound\nas his conscience; and he was well content with his life and age. He\nhad seen a good deal of the world and of enemies, in the stirring\ntimes of war. But no wrong lay in the bottom of his heart, no harm\never done to any one, except that he had killed a few Frenchmen,\nperhaps, as all Englishmen used to be forced to do.\n\nMoreover, he had what most folk now, of the very best kind, have\nalmost outlived, a staunch and steadfast faith in the management of\nthe world by its Maker. We are too clever now for all this, of course.\nBut it must be allowed that this fine old faith bred courage, truth,\nand comfort.\n\n\"Whoever has played this trick with me,\" said the Squire, as soon as\nhe recovered himself, \"is, to say the least of it, a blackguard. Even\nfor a Christmas joke, it is carrying things a great deal too far. I\nhave played, and been played, many practical jokes, when there was\nnothing else to do; in winter-quarters, and such like. But this is\nbeyond---- Thomas, run and fetch Cripps. I will get to the bottom of\nthis, I am resolved.\"\n\nIn a minute or two Master Cripps came in. His face was a little\nflushed, from the power of the compliments paid to Mary, but his eyes\nwere quite firm, and his breeches and gaiters strictly under\ndiscipline of the legs inside them.\n\n\"Servant, sir,\" he said, touching his forelock, nearly of the colour\nof clover hay; \"all correct, I hope, Squire, safe and sound and in\ngood condition. That's how I deliver all goods, barring the will of\nthe A'mighty.\"\n\n\"Tell me the meaning of this.\" As he spoke Mr. Oglander held up the\nbright wreath of hair, and pointed to the red stains on the sack.\nCripps, as behoved a slow-minded man, stared at the hair, and the bag,\nand the Squire, the roof of the brewery, and all the tubs; and then\nbegan feeling in his hat for orders.\n\n\"Cripps, are you dumb; are you tipsy; or what? Or are you too much\nashamed of yourself?\"\n\n\"I ain't done nort for to be ashamed of--me, nor my father avoore me.\"\n\n\"Then will you tell me what this means? Are you going to keep me all\nnight, for God's sake?\"\n\n\"Squire, I never, I never see'd 'un. I know no more than a sto-un. I\nknow no more than the dead, I do.\"\n\n\"Where did you get the bag? Was it like this? Who gave it to you? Have\nyou let it out of sight? Did you see anybody come near it?\"\n\n\"Squire, I can't tell 'ee such a many things. They heft up the barg to\nme at the Black Horse, where the bargs is alwas left for you. I took\nno heed of 'un, out of common. And no one have a titched him since,\nbut me.\"\n\nThere was nothing more to be learned from Cripps, except that he\npassed the Black Horse that day a little earlier than usual, and had\nnot brought his sister Esther, who was to have met him at the Golden\nCross. He had come home by way of Elsfield, having something to\ndeliver there, and had given a lift to old Shepherd Wakeling; but that\ncould have naught to do with it.\n\nIt was now getting dark, and the Squire every moment grew more and\nmore uneasy. \"Keep all this nonsense to yourself now, Cripps,\" he\nsaid, as he stowed the bag under a tub, and carefully covered his\ndaughter's hair, and the piece of paper, with a straining sieve; \"it\nmight annoy me very much if this joke went any further, you know. I\ncan trust Thomas to hold his tongue, and I hope I can trust you,\nneighbour Cripps.\"\n\n\"Your honour knoweth what I be,\" answered the loyal Carrier. \"Ever\nsince I were a boy--but there, they all knows what I be.\"\n\nMaster Cripps, with his brain \"a good piece doiled,\" as he afterwards\nsaid of it, made his way back to the cart, and mounted in his special\nmanner. Although he was only two-score years of age, he had so much\nrheumatism in his right knee--whether it sprang from the mud, or the\nruts, or (as he believed) from the turnpike gates--that he was bound\nto get up in this way. First he looked well up and down the lane, to\nbe sure there was no other cart in sight, then he said \"whoa-hoa\" to\nDobbin (who was always quite ready to receive that advice), and then\nhe put his left foot on the little step, and made sure that it was\nquite steady. Throwing his weight on that foot, he laid hold of the\ncrupper with his right hand, and placed his stiff knee on the flat of\nthe shaft, never without a groan or two. At this stage he rested, to\ncollect his powers; and then with decisive action flung his left foot\nupon the footboard, and casting the weight of his body thither, came\ndown on the seat, with a thump and rattle. He was now all right, and\nDobbin felt it, and acknowledged the fact with a grateful grunt. Then\nCarrier Cripps took up the reins, and made a little flourish with his\nbrass-bound whip, and Dobbin put up his head, and started with his\nmost convenient foot.\n\n\"I dunno what to make of this here start,\" said Cripps to himself, and\nhis horse and cart, as soon as he had smitten his broad chest long\nenough to arouse circulation. \"Seemeth to me a queer thing truly. But\nI never were a hand at a riddle. Wugg then, Dobbin! Wun'not go home\nto-night?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nA RIDE THROUGH THE SNOW.\n\n\nMeanwhile the old Squire, with a troubled mind, kept talking and\nwalking about, and listening for the rumble of his sister's carriage,\nthe clank of horses' hoofs, and the ring of wheels upon the frozen\nroad. He could not believe that any one in the world would hurt his\ndarling Gracie. Everybody loved her so, and the whole parish was so\nfond of her, and she had such a way of easing every one's\nperplexities, that if any villain durst even think of touching a hair\nof her blessed head--yet whose hair was it?--whose hair was it? And\nsuch a quantity as never could have been cut with her consent!\n\n\"This is too much! I cannot bear it!\" he said to himself, after many a\nturn, and anxious search of the distance; \"Joan's carriage should have\nbeen here long ago. My darling would have made them keep their time. I\ncannot stop here: I must go to meet them. But I need not startle any\none.\"\n\nTo provide for this, he just looked in at the kitchen door, and told\nthe old cook to keep the dinner back awhile; for the roads were so bad\nthat the ladies were almost sure to be behind their time; and then he\nwent quietly to the stable, where the horses were bedded down, and by\nthe light of an old horn lantern saddled and bridled his favourite\nhack.\n\nHeavy snow-clouds had been gathering all the afternoon; and now as he\npassed through a side-gate into the lane, and turned his mare's head\neastward, the forward flakes were borne by the sharp wind into his\nwhite whiskers. \"We shall have a coarse night of it, I doubt,\" he said\nto himself, as he buttoned his coat. At every turn of the lane he\nhoped to meet his sister's chariot labouring up the slippery track\nwith the coal-black horses gray with snow, and somebody well wrapped\nup inside, to make him laugh at his childish fears. But corner after\ncorner he turned, and met no carriage, no cart, no horse, nor even so\nmuch as a man afoot; only the snow getting thicker and sharper, and\nthe wind beginning to wail to it. The ruts of the lane grew more\ndistinct, as their combs of frozen mud attracted and held the driving\nwhiteness; and the frogs of heavy cart-horses might be traced by the\nhoary increment. Then in three or four minutes, a silvery greyness\n(cast by the brown face of the roadway underlying the skin of snow)\nglistened between steep hedgerows wherein the depth of darkness\nrested. Soon even these showed traitor members, and began to hang the\nwhite feather forth, where drooping spray or jutting thicket stopped\nthe course of the laden air. Every hoof of the horse fell softer than\nit had fallen the step before, and the old man stooped to heed his\nreins, as his hoary eyebrows crusted.\n\nFear struck colder to his heart than frost, as he turned the last\ncorner of his way, without meeting presence or token of his sister or\ndarling daughter. In the deepening snow he drew his horse up under the\ntwo great yew-trees that overhung his sister's gate, and fumbled in\nthe dark for the handle. The close heavy gates were locked and barred;\nand nothing had lately passed through them. Then he hoped that the\nweather might have stopped the carriage, and he tugged out the heavy\nbronze lion's-head in the pillar, which was the bell-pull. The bell in\nthe porch of the house clanged deeply, and the mastiff heavily bayed\nat him; but he had to make the bell clang thrice before any servant\nanswered it.\n\n\"Who be you there?\" at last a gruff voice asked, without stretch of\ncourtesy. \"This sort of weather, come ringing like that! If 'ee say\nmuch more, I'll let the big dog loose.\"\n\n\"Open the gate, you young oaf,\" cried the Squire. \"I suppose you are\none of the new lot, eh? Not to know me, Worth Oglander!\"\n\n\"Why couldn't you have said so then?\" the surly fellow answered, as he\nslowly opened one leaf of the gate, sweeping a fringe of snow back.\n\n\"Such a fellow wouldn't be with me half a day. Are you too big for\nyour work, sir? Run on before me, you piecrust in pumps, or you shall\ntaste my whip, sir.\"\n\nThe footman, for once in his life, took his feet up, and ran in a\nbluster of rage and terror to the front door, which he had left wide\nopen to secure a retreat from violence. Mr. Oglander struck his mare,\nand she started so that he scarcely pulled her head up under the\ncoigne of his sister's porch.\n\n\"What is all this, I would beg to know? If you think to frighten me,\nyou are mistaken. Oh, Worth is it? Worth, whatever do you mean by\nmaking such a commotion?\"\n\nThree or four frightened maids were peeping, safe in the gloom of the\nentrance-hall; while the lady of the house came forward bravely in the\nlamp-light.\n\n\"I will speak to you presently, Joan,\" said the Squire, as he vainly\nsearched, with a falling heart, for some dear face behind her. \"Here,\nBob, I know you at any rate; take the old mare to the stable.\"\n\nThen, with a sign to his sister, he followed her softly into the\ndining-room. At a glance he saw that she had dined alone, and he fell\ninto a chair, and could not speak.\n\n\"Have you brought back the stockings? Why, how ill you look? The cold\nhas been too much for you, brother. You should not have come out. What\nwas Grace doing to let----\"\n\n\"Where is my daughter Grace?\"\n\n\"Your daughter Grace! My niece Grace! Why, at home in her father's\nhouse, to be sure! Worth, are your wits wandering?\"\n\n\"When did Grace leave you?\"\n\n\"At three o'clock, yesterday. How can you ask, when you sent in such\nhot haste for her? You might be quite sure that she would not linger.\nI thought it rather--let me tell you----\"\n\n\"I never sent for Grace. I have not seen her!\"\n\nMrs. Fermitage looked at her brother steadily, with one hand fencing\nher forehead. She knew that he was of no drunken kind--yet once in a\nway a man might take too much--especially in such weather. But he\nanswered her gaze with such eyes that she came up to him, and began to\ntremble.\n\n\"I tell you, Joan, I never sent for Grace. If you don't know where she\nis--none but God knows!\"\n\n\"I have told you all,\" his sister answered, catching her breath at\nevery word almost--\"a letter came from you, overruling the whole of\nour arrangement--you were not ill; but you wanted her for some\nparticular purpose. She was to walk, and you would meet her; and walk\nshe did, poor darling! And I was so hurt that I would not send----\"\n\n\"You let her go, Joan! You let her go! It was a piece of your proud\ntemper. Her death lies at your door. And so will mine!\"\n\nMr. Oglander was very sorry, as soon as he had spoken thus unjustly;\nbut the deep pang of the heart devoured any qualms of conscience.\n\n\"Are you sure that you let her go? Are you sure that she is not in\nthis house now?\" he cried, coming up to his sister, and taking both\nhands to be sure of her. \"She must be here; and you are joking with\nme.\"\n\n\"Worth, she left this house at two o'clock by that timepiece\nyesterday, instead of to-day, as we meant to do. She would not let any\none go with her, because you were coming down the hill to meet her.\nNot expecting to go home that day, she had a pair of my silk stockings\non, because--well, I need not go into that--and knowing what a darling\nlittle fidget she is, I thought she had sent you back with them, and\nto make your peace for so flurrying me.\"\n\n\"Have you nothing more to tell me, Joan? I shall go mad while you\ndwell on your stockings. Who brought that letter? What is become of\nit? Did you see it? Can you think of anything? Oh, Joan, you women are\nso quick-witted! Surely you can think of something!\"\n\nMrs. Fermitage knew what her brother meant; but no sign would she show\nof it. The Squire was thinking of a little touch of something that\nmight have grown up into love, if Grace had not been so shy about it,\nand so full of doubts as to what she ought to do. Her aunt had been\nanxious to help this forward; but not for the world to speak of it.\n\n\"Concerning the letter, I only just saw it. I was up--well, well, I\nmean I happened to have something to do in my own room then. The dear\ncreature knocked at my door, and I could not let her in at the\nmoment----\"\n\n\"You were doing your wig--well, well, go on.\"\n\n\"I was doing nothing of the kind--your anxiety need not make you rude,\nWorth. However, she put the letter under the door, and I saw that it\nwas your handwriting, and so urgent that I was quite flurried, and she\nwas off in two minutes, without my even kissing her. Oh, poor dear! My\nlittle dear! She said good-bye through the key-hole, and could not\nwait for me even to kiss her!\"\n\nAt this thought the elderly lady broke down, and could for the moment\ndo nothing but sob.\n\n\"Dear heart, dear heart!\" cried the Squire, who was deeply attached to\nhis sister; \"don't take on so, my dear good Joan! We know of no harm\nas yet--that is\"--for he thought of the coil of hair, but with strong\neffort forbore to speak of it--\"nothing I mean in any way positive, or\ndisastrous. She may have, you know--she may have taken it into her\nhead to--to leave us for awhile, Joan.\"\n\n\"To run away! To elope! Not she! She is the last girl in the world to\ndo it. Whatever may have happened, she has not done that. You ought to\nknow better than that, Worth.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I do; I have no more time to talk of that, or any other\nthing. I shall hurry into Oxford, and see John Smith, and let\neverybody know of it. What do I care what people think? Send a man on\nhorseback to Beckley at once. Have you any man worth a pinch of salt?\nYou are always changing so.\"\n\n\"I cannot keep cripples, or sots, dear brother. Take any one you\nplease of them.\"\n\n\"Any one who will deign to come, you should say. Deep snow tries the\nmettle of new-comers.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nTHE PUBLIC OF THE \"PUBLIC.\"\n\n\nMeanwhile, Esther Cripps, who perhaps could have thrown some light on\nthis strange affair, was very uneasy in her mind. She had not heard,\nof course, as yet, that Grace Oglander was missing. But she could not\nget rid of the fright she had felt, and the dread of some dark secret.\nHer sister-in-law was in such a condition that she must not be told of\nit; and as for her brother Exodus, it would be worse than useless to\nspeak to him. He had taken it into his head, ever since that business\nwith the \"College gent,\" that his sister was not \"right-minded\"--that\nshe dreamed things, and imagined things; and that anything she liked\nto say should be listened to, and thought no more of. And Baker Cripps\nwas one of those men from whose minds no hydraulic power can lift an\nidea--laid once, laid for ever.\n\nEsther had no one to tell her tale to. She longed to be home at\nBeckley; but there had been such symptoms with the baker's wife, that\na woman, of the largest experience to be found in Oxford, declared\nthat there was another coming. This was not so. But still (as all the\nwomen said) it might have been; and where was the man to lay down the\nlaw to them that had been through it?\n\nThe whole of this was made quite right in the end and everybody\nsatisfied; but it prevented poor Esther from going to the Golden\nCross, as she should have done; and the Carrier (having a little tiff\nwith his brother about a sack of meal, as long ago as Michaelmas) left\nhim to bake his own bread, and would rather drive over his dinner than\ndine with him.\n\nThe days of the week are hard to follow, as everybody must have long\nfound out; but still, from Tuesday to Saturday is a considerable time\nto think of. Master Cripps had two carrying days, two great days of\nlong voyaging. Not that he refrained from coasting here and there\nabout the parish, or up and down a lane or two, on days of briefer\nenterprise; or refused to take some washings round; for he was not the\nman to be ashamed of earning sixpence honourably.\n\nBut now such weather had set in, that even Cripps, with his active\nturn and pride in his honest calling, was forced to stay at home and\nboil the bones the butcher sent him, and nurse his stiff knee, and\nsmoke his pipe, and go no further than his bed of hardy kail, or\nDobbin's stable. Except that when the sun went down--if it ever got\nup, for aught he knew--his social instincts so awoke, that he managed\nto go to the corner of the lane, where the blacksmith kept the\n\"public-house.\" This was a most respectable house, frequented very\nquietly. Master Cripps, from his intercourse with the world, and\nleading position in Beckley, as well as his pleasant way of letting\nother people talk, and nodding when their words were wisdom--Cripps\nhad long been accepted as the oracle; and he liked it.\n\nEven there--in his brightest moments, when he smoked his pipe and\nthought, leaving emptier folk to waste the income of their brain in\nwords, and even when he had been roused up to settle some vast\nquestion by a brief emphatic utterance--his satisfaction was now\nalloyed. Not from any threat of rival wisdom--that was hopeless--but\nfrom the universal call for a guiding judgment from him. The whole of\nBeckley village now was more upset than had been known for thirty\nyears and upward. Ever since Napoleon had been expected to encamp at\nCarfax, and all the University went into white gaiters against him,\nthere had been no such stir of parochial mind as now was heaving.\nCripps could remember the former movement, and how his father had lost\nwisdom by saying that nothing would come of it--whereas the greatest\nthings came of it; the tailor was bankrupt by making breeches which\nthe Government would not pay for, the publican bought a horse and\ndefied his brewer on the strength of it, and the parish-clerk limped\nfor the rest of his life through the loss of two toes when\ntipsy--therefore Zacchary Cripps was now determined to hide his\nopinion.\n\nWhen the mind is in this uncertain state, it fails of receiving that\nconsideration which it is slowly exerting. If Cripps had stood up, and\nrashly spoken, he must have carried all before him: whereas now he\nfelt, and was grieved to feel, that shallow fellows were taking his\nplace, by dint of decisive ignorance. This Friday evening, everybody,\nwho had teeth to face the arrowy wind, came into the Dusty Anvil, well\nladen with enormous rumours.\n\nPhil Hiss, the blacksmith, had a daughter, who served him as a\nbarmaid, Amelia, or Mealy Hiss; a year or two older than Miss\nOglander, and in the simple country fashion (setting birth and rank\naside) a true ally and favourite. Now, some old woman in Beckley had\nsaid, as long ago as yesterday, that she could not believe but what\nMealy Hiss, who dressed herself so outrageous, knew a deal more than\nshe dared speak out concerning that wonderful unkid thing about the\nSquire's daughter. For her part, this old woman was sure that a young\nman lay at the bottom of it. Them good young ladies that went to the\nschool, and made up soup and such-like, was not a bit better than the\nrest of us; and if butter wouldn't melt in their mouths, pitchforks\nwouldn't choke them. She would say no more, it was no concern of hers;\nand everybody knew what she was. But as sure as her copper burst that\nmorning, something would come out ere long; and Mealy would be at the\nbottom of it!\n\nMiss Amelia Hiss, before she lit her two tallow-candles--which never\nwas allowed to be done till a quart of beer had been called for--knew\nright well that all her wits must be brought into use that evening. A\nyoung man, who had a liking for her, which she was beginning to think\nabout, came in before his time to tell her all that Gammer Gurdon\nsaid. Wherefore she put on her new neck-ribbon (believed to have come\nexpress from London) and her agate brooch, and other most imposing\nproperties. With the confidence of all these, she drew the ale, and\nkept her distance.\n\nFor an hour or so these tactics answered. Young men, old men, and good\nwomen (who came of course for their husbands' sakes), soberly took\ntheir little drop of beer, nodded to one another, and said little.\nPressure lay on heart and mind; and nature's safety-valve, the tongue,\nwas sat upon by prudence. But this, of course, could not last long.\nLittle jerkings of short questions broke the crust of silence; lips\nfrom blowing froth of beer began to relax their grimness; eyelids that\nhad drooped went up, and winks grew into friendly gaze; and everybody\nbegan to beg everybody's pardon less. The genial power of good ale,\nand the presence of old friends, were working on the solid English\nhearts; and every man was ready for his neighbour to say something.\n\nHiss, the blacksmith and the landlord, felt that on his heavy\nshoulders lay the duty of promoting warmth and cordiality. He sat\nwithout a coat, as usual, and his woolsey sleeves rolled back\ndisplayed the proper might of arm. In one grimy hand he held a pipe,\nat which he had given the final puff, and in the other a broad-rimmed\npenny, ready to drop it into the balance of the brass tobacco-box, and\nopen it for a fresh supply. First he glanced at the door, to be sure\nthat his daughter Mealy could not hear; for ever since her mother's\ndeath he had stood in some awe of Mealy; and then receiving from\nZacchary Cripps a nod of grave encouragement, he fixed his eyes on him\nthrough the smoke, and uttered what all were inditing of.\n\n\"I call this a very rum start, I do, about poor Squire's daughter.\"\n\nThe public of the public gazed with admiring approval at him. The\nsentiment was their own, and he had put it well and briefly. In\ndifferent ways, according to the state and manner of each of them,\nthey let him know that he was right, and might hold on by what he\nsaid. Then Master Hiss grew proud of this, and left it for some other\nbody to bear the weight of thinking out. But even before his broad\nforefinger had quite finished with his pipe, and pressed the crown of\nfuel flat, a man of no particular wisdom, and without much money,\ncould not check a weak desire to say something striking. His name was\nBatts, and he kept a shop, and many things in it which he could not\nsell. Before he spoke, he took precautions to secure an audience, by\nstanding up, and rapping the table with the heel of his half-pint mug.\n\"Hear, hear!\" cried some young fellow; and Batts was afraid that he\nhad gone too far.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Grocer Batts, the very same man who had threatened\nto put his son into the carrying line, \"I bows, in course, to superior\nwisdom, and them as is always to and fro. But every man must think his\nthoughts, right or wrong, and speak them out, and not be afeared of no\none. And my mind is that in this here business, we be all of us going\nto work the wrong way altogether.\"\n\nAs no one had any sense as yet of having gone to work at all, in this\nor any other matter, and several men had made up their minds to be\nthrown out of work on the Saturday night if the bitter weather lasted,\nthis great speech of Grocer Batts created some confusion.\n\n\"Let 'un go to work, hisself!\" \"What do he know about work?\"\n\"Altogether wrong! Give me the saw-dust for to clear my throat!\" These\nand stronger exclamations showed poor Batts that it would have been\nbetter for trade if he had held his tongue. He hid his discomfiture in\nhis mug, and made believe to drink, although it had ever so long been\nempty.\n\nBut Carrier Cripps had a generous soul. He did not owe so much as a\nhalfpenny piece to Master Batts, neither did he expect to make a\nsingle halfpenny out of him--quite the contrary, in fact; and yet he\ncame to his rescue.\n\n\"Touching what neighbour Batts have said,\" he began in his slow and\nsteadfast voice, \"it may be neither here nor there; and all of us be\nliable, in our best of times, to error. But I do believe as he means\nwell, and hath a good deal inside him, and a large family to put up\nwith. He may be right, and all us in the wrong. Time will show, with\npatience. I have knowed so many things as looked at first unlikely,\ncome true as Gospel in the end, and so many things I were sure of turn\nout quite contrairy, that whenever a man hath aught to say, I likes to\nhearken to him. There now, I han't no more to say; and I leave you to\nmake the best of it.\"\n\nZacchary rose, for his time was up; he saw that hot words might ensue,\nand he detested brawling. Moreover, although he did not always keep\nstrict time with his horse and cart, no man among the living could be\nmore punctual to his pillow. With kind \"good-nights\" from all, he\npassed, and left the smoky scene behind. As he stopped at the bar to\nsay good-bye, and to pay his score to Amelia, for whom he had a\nliking, a short, quick, rosy man came in, shaking snow from his boots,\nand seeming to have lost his way that night. By the light from the\nbar, the Carrier knew him, and was about to speak to him, but received\na sign to hold his tongue, and pass on without notice. Clumsily enough\nhe did as he was bidden, and went forth, puzzled in his homely pate by\nthis new piece of mystery.\n\nFor the man who passed him was John Smith, not as yet well-known, but\nheld by all who had experience of him to be the shrewdest man in\nOxford. This man quietly went into the sanded parlour, and took his\nglass, and showed good manners to the company. They set him down as a\nwayfarer, but a pleasant one, and well to do; and as words began to\nkindle with the friction of opinions, he listened to all that was\nsaid, but did not presume to side with any one.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nTHE BEST FOOT FOREMOST.\n\n\nThe arrows of the snowy wind came shooting over Shotover. It was\nSaturday now of that same week with which we began on Tuesday. The\nmercury during those four days had not risen once above 28\u00c2\u00b0 of\nFahrenheit, and now it stood about 22\u00c2\u00b0, and lower than that in the\nriver meadows. Trusty and resolute Dobbin never had a harder job than\nnow. Some parts of Headington Hill give pretty smart collar-work in\nthe best of times; and now with deep snow scarred by hoofs, and ridged\nby wheels, but not worn down, hard it seemed for a horse, however\nsagacious, to judge what to do. Dobbin had seen snow ere now, and gone\nthrough a good deal of it. But that was before the snow had fallen so\nthickly on his own mane and tail, and even his wise eyebrows. That was\nin the golden days, when youth and quick impatience moved him, and the\nbiggest flint before his wheel was crushed, with a snort at the\nroad-surveyor.\n\nBut now he was come to a different state of body, and therefore of\nspirit too. At his time of life it would not do to be extravagant of\nstrength; it was not comely to kick up the heels; neither was it wise\nto cherish indignation at the whip. So now on the homeward road, with\na heavy Christmas-laden cart to drag, this fine old horse took good\ncare of himself, and having only a choice of evils, chose the least\nthat he could find.\n\nAlas, the smallest that he could find were great and very heavy ills.\nScarcely any man stops to think of the many weary cares that weigh\nupon the back of an honest horse. Men are eloquent on the trouble that\nsits behind the horseman; but the silent horse may bear all that, and\nthe troublesome man in the saddle to boot, without any poet to pity\nhim. Dobbin knew all this, but was too much of a horse to dwell on it.\nHe kept his tongue well under bit, and his eyes in sagacious blinkers,\nand sturdily up the hill he stepped, while Cripps, his master, trudged\nbeside him.\n\nEvery \"talented\" man must think, whenever he walks beside a horse, of\nthe superior talents of the horse--the bounty of nature in four curved\nlegs, the pleasure there must be in timing them, the pride of the hard\nand goutless feet, the glory of the mane (to which the human beard is\nno more than seaweed in a billow), the power of blowing (which no man\nhas in a comely and decorous form); and last, not least, the final\nblessing of terminating usefully in a tail. Zacchary Cripps was a man\nof five talents, and traded with them wisely; but often as he walked\nbeside his horse, and smelled his superiority, he became quite humble,\nand wiped his head, and put his whip back in the cart again. The\nhorse, on the other hand, looked up to Zacchary with soft faith and\nlove. He knew that his master could not be expected quite to\nunderstand the ways a horse is bound to have of getting on in\nharness--the hundreds of things that must needs be done--and done in\nproper order, too--the duty of going always like a piece of the finest\nmusic, with chains, and shafts, and buckles, and hard leather to be\nharmonized, and the load which men are not born to drag, until they\nmake it for themselves. Dobbin felt the difference, but he never\ngrumbled as men do.\n\nHe made the best of the situation; and it was a hard one. The hill was\nstrong against the collar; and, by reason of the snow, zigzag and the\ncorkscrew tactics could not be resorted to. At all of these he was a\ndab, by dint of steep experience; but now the long hill must be\nbreasted, and both shoulders set to it. The ruts were as slippery as\nglass, and did not altogether fit the wheels he had behind him; and in\nspite of the spikes which the blacksmith gave him, the snow balled on\nhis hairy feet. So he stopped, and shook himself, and panted with\nlarge resolutions; and Cripps from his capacious pockets fetched the\ntwo oak wedges, and pushed one under either wheel; while Esther, who\nwas coming home at last, jumped from her seat, to help the load, and\npatted Dobbin's kind nose, and said a word or two to cheer him.\n\n\"The best harse as ever looked through a bridle,\" Zacchary declared\nacross his mane; \"but he must be hoomered with his own way now, same\nas the rest on us, when us grows old. Etty, my dear, no call for you\nto come down and catch chilblains.\"\n\n\"Zak, I am going to push behind. I am not big enough to do much good.\nBut I would rather be alongside of you, through this here bend of the\nroad, I would.\"\n\nFor now the dusk was gathering in, as they toiled up the lonesome and\nsnowy road where it overhung the \"Gipsy's Grave.\"\n\n\"This here bend be as good as any other,\" said Cripps, though himself\nafraid of it. \"What ails you, girl? What hath ailed you, ever since\nout of Oxford town you come? Is it a jail thou be coming home to?\nOxford turns the head of thee!\"\n\n\"Now, Zak, you know better than that. I would liefer be at Beckley any\nday. But I have been that frightened since I passed this road on\nTuesday night that scarce a morsel could I eat or drink, and never\nsleep for dreaming.\"\n\n\"Frightened, child? Lord, bless my heart! you make me creep by talking\nso. There, wait till we be in our own lane--can't spare the time now\nto speak of it.\"\n\n\"Oh, but, Zak, if you please, you must. I have had it on my mind so\nlong. And I kept it for you, till we got to the place, that you might\ngo and see to it.\"\n\n\"Etty, now, this is childish stuff; no time to hearken to any such\ntell-up. Enough to do, the Lord knows there be, without no foolish\nstories.\"\n\n\"It is not a foolish story, Zak. It is what I saw with my own eyes. We\nare close to the place; it was in a dark hollow, just below the road\non here. I will show you; and then I will stand by the cart, while you\ngo and seek into it.\"\n\n\"I wun't leave the haigh road for any one, I tell 'ee. All these goods\nis committed to my charge, and my dooty is to stick to them. A likely\nthing as I'd leave the cart to be robbed in that there sort of way.\nAh, ha! they'd soon find out, I reckon, what Zacchary Cripps is made\nof.\"\n\n\"Ah, we all know how brave you are, dear Zak. And perhaps you wouldn't\nlike to leave me, brother?\"\n\n\"No, no; of course not. How could I do it? All by yourself, and the\nweather getting dark. Hup! Hup! Dobbin, there. Best foot foremost\nkills the hill.\"\n\nBut Esther was even more strongly set to tell the story and relieve\nher mind, than Zacchary was to relieve his mind by turning a deaf ear\nto all of it. Nevertheless, she might have failed, if it had not been\nfor a lucky chance. Dobbin, after a very fine rush, and spirited\nbodily tug at the shafts, was suddenly forced to pull up and pant, and\nspread his legs, to keep where he was, until his wind should come back\nagain. And he stopped with the off-wheel of the cart within a few\nyards of the gap in the hedge, where Esther began her search that\nnight. She knew the place at a glance, although in the snow it looked\nso different; and she ran to the gap, and peeped as if she expected to\nsee it all again.\n\nIn all the beauty of fair earth, few things are more beautiful than\nsnow on clustering ivy-leaves. Wednesday's fall had been shaken off;\nfor even in the coldest weather, jealous winds and evaporation soon\nclear foliage of snow. But a little powdery shed of flakes had come at\nnoon that very day, like the flitting of a fairy; and every delicate\nstar shone crisply in its cupped or pillowed rest. The girl was afraid\nto shake a leaf, because she had her best bonnet on; therefore she\ndrew back, and called the reluctant Zacchary to gaze.\n\n\"Nort but a sight of snow,\" said he; \"it hath almost filled old quarry\nup. Harse have rested, and so have we. Shan't be home by candlelight.\nWugg then! Dobbin--wugg then! wilt 'a?\"\n\n\"Stop, brother, stop! Don't be in such a hurry. Something I must tell\nyou now, that I have been feared to tell anybody else. It was so\ndreadfully terrible! Do you see anything in the snow down there?\"\n\n\"As I am a sinner, there be something moving. Jump up into the cart,\ngirl. I shall never get round with my things to-night.\"\n\n\"There is something there, Zak, that will never move again. There is\nthe dead body of a woman there!\"\n\n\"No romantics! No romantics!\" the Carrier answered as he turned away;\nbut his cheeks beneath a week's growth of beard turned as white as the\nsnow in the buckthorn. No living man might scare him--but a woman, and\na dead one----\n\n\"Come, Zak,\" cried Esther, having seen much worse than she was likely\nnow to see, \"you cannot be afraid of 'romantics,' Zak. Come here, and\nI will show thee.\"\n\nDriven by shame and curiosity, the valiant Cripps came back to her,\nand even allowed himself to be led a little way through the gap into\nthe deep untrodden and drifted snow. She took him as far as a corner,\nwhence the nook of the quarry was visible; and there with trembling\nfingers pointed to a vast billow of pure white, piled by the driving\neast wind over the grave, as she thought, of the murdered one.\n\n\"Enough,\" he said, having heard her tale, and becoming at once a man\nagain in the face of something real; \"my dear, what a fright thou must\nhave had! How couldst thou have kept it all this time? I would not\ntell thee our news at home, for fear of tarrifying thee in the cold.\nHath no one to Oxford told thee?\"\n\n\"Told me what? Oh, Zak, dear Zak, I am so frightened, I can hardly\nstand.\"\n\n\"Then run, girl, run! We must go home, fast as ever we can, for\nconstable.\"\n\nHe took her to the cart, and reckless of Dobbin's indignation, lashed\nhim up the hill, and made him trot the whole length of Beckley lane,\nthen threw a sack over his loins and left his Christmas parcels in the\nfrost and snow, while he hurried to Squire Oglander.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nBALDERDASH.\n\n\nWorth Oglander sat in his old oak chair, weary, and very low of heart,\nbut not altogether broken down. He had not been in bed since last\nMonday night, and had slept, if at all, in the saddle, or on the roof\nof the Henley and Maidenhead coach. For miles he had scoured the\ncountry round, until his three horses quite broke down, with the\nweather so much against them; and all the bran to be got in the\nvillages was made away with in mashes. One of these horses \"got the\npipes;\" and had to be tickled before he could eat.\n\nThe Squire cared not a button for this. The most particular of mankind\nconcerning what is grossly and contemptuously (if not carnivorously)\nspoken of as \"horseflesh,\" forgets his tender feelings towards the\nnoblest of all animals when his own flesh and blood come into\ncompetition with them. But ride, and lash, and spur as he might, the\nold Squire made no discovery.\n\nHis daughter, his only child, in whom all the rest of his old life\nlived and loved, was gone and lost; not even leaving knowledge of\nwhere she lay, or surety of a better meeting. His faith in God was\ntrue and firm; for on the whole he was a pious man, although no great\nprofessor: and if it had pleased the Lord to take his only joy from\nhis old age, he could have tried to bear it.\n\nBut thus to lose her, without good-bye, without even knowing how the\nloss befell, and with the deep misery of doubting what she might\nherself have done--only a chilly stoic, or a remarkably warm\nChristian, could have borne it with resignation. The Squire was\nneither of these; but only a simple, kind, and loving-hearted\ngentleman; with many faults, and among them, a habit of expecting the\nLord to favour him perpetually. And of this he could not quit himself,\nin the deepest tribulation; but still expected all things to be\ntempered to his happiness, according to his own ideas of what\nhappiness should be. The clergyman of the parish, a good and zealous\nman, had called upon him, and with many words had proved how thankful\nhe was bound to be for this kindly-ordered chastisement. The Squire,\nhowever, could not see it. He listened with his old politeness, but a\nsad and weary face, and quietly said that the words were good, but he\ncould not yet enter into them. Hereat the parson withdrew, to wait for\na softer and wiser season.\n\nAnd now, in the dusk of this cold dark day, Squire Oglander sat gazing\nfrom the window of his dining-room; with his head fallen back, and his\nwhite chin up, and hard-worn hands clasped languidly. His heavy eyes\ndwelled on the dreary snow that buried his daughter's handiwork--the\ndwarf plants not to be traced, and the tall ones only as soft\nhillocks, like the tufts in a great white counterpane. And more and\nmore, as the twilight deepened, and the curves of white grew dim, he\nkept repeating below his voice, \"Her winding-sheet, her winding-sheet;\nand her pretty eyes wide open perhaps!\"\n\n\"Now, sir, if you please, you must--you must,\" cried Mary Hookham, his\nbest maid, trotting in with her thumbs turned back from a right hot\ndish, and her lips up as if she were longing to kiss him, to let out\nher feelings. \"Here be a duster, by way of a cloth, not to scorch the\ntable against Miss Grace comes home again. Sir, if you please, you\nmust ate a bit. Not a bit have you aten sin' Toosday, and it is enough\nto kill a carrier's horse. 'Take on,' as my mother have often said;\n'take on, as you must, if your heart is right, when the hand of the\nLord is upon you; but never take off with your victuals.' And a hearty\ngood woman my mother is, and have seen much tribulation. You never\nwould repent, sir, of hearkening to me, and of trying of her, till\nsuch time as poor Miss Grace comes back. And not a penny would she\ncharge you.\"\n\n\"Let her come, if she will,\" he answered, without thinking twice about\nit; for he paid no heed to household matters in his present trouble.\n\"Let her come, if you wish it, Mary. At any rate, she can do no harm.\"\n\n\"She will do a mort of good, sir. But now do try to ate a bit. My\nmother will make you, if you have her, sir.\"\n\nThe old man did his best to eat; for he knew that he must keep his\nstrength up, to abide the end of it. And Mary, without asking leave,\nlit four good candles, and drew the curtains, and made the fire\ncheerful. \"All of us has our troubles,\" said Mary; \"but these here\npickles is wonderful.\"\n\n\"You are a good girl,\" answered the Squire; \"and you deserve a good\nhusband. Now, if either the man from Oxford or young Mr. Overshute\nshould come, show them in directly; but I can see no other person. No\nmore, thank you. Take all away, Mary.\"\n\n\"Oh my! what a precious little bit you've had! But as sure as my name\nis Mary Hookham, you shall have three glasses of port, sir. You don't\nkeep no butler, because you knows better; and no housekeeper, because\nyou don't know mother. Likewise, Miss Grace is so clever--but there,\nnow, if she stay long for her honeymoon, a housekeeper you must have,\nsir.\"\n\nThe master was tempted to ask what she meant, but he scarcely thought\nit worth while, perhaps. By pressure of advice from all the womankind\nwithin his doors (whenever they could get hold of him) he had been\nsped on many bootless errands, as was natural. For without any ground,\nexcept that of their hearts, all the gentler bosoms of the place were\nfilled with large belief that this was only a lovely love affair.\n\nRussel Overshute, the heir of the Overshutes of Shotover, was a young\nman who could speak for himself, and did it sometimes too strongly. He\nhad long been taken prisoner by the sweet spell of Grace Oglander; and\nbeing of a bold and fearless order, he had so avowed himself. But her\nfather had always been against him; not from personal dislike, but\nsimply because he could not bear his \"wild political sentiments.\"\nWorth Oglander was as staunch an old Tory as ever stood in buckram,\nalthough in social and domestic matters perhaps almost too gentle.\nRadical and rascal were upon his tongue the self-same word; and he\npassed the salt with the back of his hand to even a mild Reformer.\n\nAnd now, as he drank his glass of port, by dint of Mary's management,\nand did his best to think about it, as he always used to do, the door\nof the room was thrown open strongly, and in strode Russel Overshute.\n\n\"Will you kindly leave the room,\" he said to the sedulous Mary. \"I\nwish to say a few words to the Squire of a private nature.\"\n\nThis young gentleman was a favourite with maid-servants everywhere,\nbecause he always spoke to them \"just the same as if they was ladies.\"\nEvery housemaid now demands this, in our advanced intelligence; and\ndoubtless she is right; but forty years ago it was otherwise, and\n\"Polly, my dear,\" and a chuck of the chin, were not as yet vile\nantiquity. Mary made a bob of the order still taught at the\nvillage-school, and set a glass for the gentleman, and simpered, and\ndeparted.\n\n\"Shake hands with me, Squire,\" said Overshute, as Mr. Oglander arose,\nwith cold dignity, and bowed to him. \"You have sent for me; I rode\nover at once, the moment that I heard of it. I returned from London\nthis afternoon, having been there for a fortnight. When I heard the\nnews, I was thunderstruck. What can I do to help you?\"\n\n\"I will not shake hands with you,\" answered the Squire, \"until you\nhave solemnly pledged your honour, that you know nothing of this--of\nthis--there, I have no word for it!\" Mr. Oglander trembled, though his\neyes were stern. His last hope of his daughter's life lay in the young\nman before him; and bitterly as he would have felt the treachery of\nhis only child, and deeply as he despised himself for harbouring such\na suspicion--yet even that disgrace and blow would be better than the\nalternative, the only alternative--her death.\n\n\"I should have thought it quite needless,\" young Overshute answered,\nwith some disdain, until he observed the father's face, so broken down\nwith misery; \"from any one but you, sir, it would have been an insult.\nIf you do not know the Overshutes, you ought to know your own\ndaughter.\"\n\n\"But against her will--against her will. Say that you took her against\nher will. You have been from home. For what else was it? Tell me the\ntruth, Russel Overshute--only the truth, and I will forgive you.\"\n\n\"You have nothing to forgive, sir. Upon the word of an Englishman, I\nhadn't even heard of it.\"\n\nThe old man watched his clear keen eyes, with deep tears gathering in\nhis own. Then Russel took his hand, and led him tenderly to his hard\noak chair.\n\nFor a minute or two not a word was said: the young man doubting what\nto say, and the old one really not caring whether he ever spoke again.\nAt last he looked up and spread both hands, as if he groped forth from\na heavy dream; and the rheumatism from so much night-work caught him\nin both shoulder-blades.\n\n\"What is it?--what is it?\" he cried. \"I have lived a long time in this\nwicked world, and I have not found it painful.\"\n\n\"My dear sir,\" his visitor answered, pitying him sincerely, and hiding\n(like a man) his own deep heart-burn of anxiety, \"may I say, without\nyour being in the least degree offended, what I fancy--or at least, I\nmean a thing that has occurred to me? You will take it for its worth.\nMost likely you will laugh at it; but taking my chance of that, may I\nsay it? Will you promise not to be angry?\"\n\n\"I wish I could be angry, Russel. What have I to be angry for?\"\n\n\"A terrible wrong, if I am right, but not a purely hopeless one. I\nhave not had time to think it out, because I have been hurried so.\nBut, right or wrong, what I think is this--the whole is a foul scheme\nof Luke Sharp's.\"\n\n\"Luke Sharp! My own solicitor! The most respectable man in Oxford!\nOvershute, you have made me hope, and then you dash me with\nbalderdash!\"\n\n\"Well, sir, I have no evidence at all; but I go by something I heard\nin London, which supplies the strongest motive; and I know, from my\nown family affairs, what Luke Sharp will do when he has strong motive.\nI beg you to keep my guess quite secret. Not that I fear a score of\nsuch fellows, but that he would be ten times craftier if he thought we\nsuspected him; and he is crafty enough without that, as his principal\nclient, the Devil, knows!\"\n\n\"I will not speak of it,\" the Squire answered; \"such a crotchet is not\nworth speaking of, and it might get you into great trouble. With one\nthing and another now, I am so knocked about, that I cannot put two\nand two together. But one thing really comforts me.\"\n\n\"My dear sir, I am so glad! What is it?\"\n\n\"That a man of your old family, Russel, and at the same time of such\nnew ways, is still enabled by the grace of God to retain his faith in\nthe Devil.\"\n\n\"While Luke Sharp lives I cannot lose it,\" he answered, with a bitter\nsmile. \"That man is too deep and consummate a villain to be\nuninspired. But now, sir, we have no time to lose. You tell me what\nyou have done, and then I will tell you what I have been thinking of,\nunless you are too exhausted.\"\n\nFor the old man, in spite of fierce anxiety, long suspense, and keen\nexcitement, began to be so overpowered with downright bodily weariness\nthat now he could scarcely keep his head from nodding, and his eyes\nfrom closing. The hope which had roused him, when Overshute entered,\nwas gone, and despair took the place of it; tired body and sad mind\nhad but a very low heart to work them. Russel, with a strong man's\npity, and the love which must arise between one man and another\nwhenever small vanity vanishes, watched the creeping shades of slumber\nsoften the lines of the harrowed face. As evening steals along a\nhill-side where the sun has tyrannised, and spreads the withering and\nthe wearying of the day with gentleness, and brings relief to rugged\npoints, and breadth of calm to everything; so the Squire's fine old\nface relaxed in slumber's halo, and tranquil ease began to settle on\neach yielding lineament; when open flew the door of the room, and\nMary, at the top of her voice, exclaimed--\n\n\"Plaize, sir, Maister Cripps be here.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nCRIPPS IN AFFLICTION.\n\n\n\"Confound that Cripps!\" young Overshute cried, with irritation getting\nthe better of his larger elements; while the Squire slowly awoke and\nstared, and rubbed his gray eyelashes, and said that he really was\nalmost falling off, and he ought to be quite ashamed of himself. Then\nhe begged his visitor's pardon for bad manners, and asked what the\nmatter was. \"Sir, it is only that fool Cripps,\" said the young man,\nstill in vexation, and signing to Mary to go, and to shut the door.\n\"Some trumpery parcel, of course. They might have let you rest for a\nminute or two.\"\n\n\"No, sir, no; if you plaize, sir, no!\" cried Mary, advancing with her\nhands up. \"Maister Cripps have seen something terrible, and he hath\ncome straight to his Worship. He be that out of breath that he was\naforced to lay hold of me, before he could stand a'most! He must have\nmet them sheep-stealers!\"\n\n\"Sheep-stealing again!\" said Mr. Oglander, who was an active\nmagistrate. \"Well, let him come in. I have troubles of my own; but I\nmust attend to my duty.\"\n\n\"Let me attend to it,\" interposed the other, being also one of the\n\"great unpaid.\" \"You must not be pestered with such things now. Try to\nget some little rest while I attend to this Cripps affair.\"\n\n\"I am much obliged to you,\" answered the Squire, rising, and looking\nwide-awake; \"but I will hear what he has to say myself. Of course, I\nshall be too glad of your aid if you are not in a hurry.\"\n\nMr. Overshute knew that this fine old Justice, although so good in the\nmain, was not entirely free from foibles, of which there was none more\nconspicuous than a keen and resolute jealousy if any brother\nmagistrate dared to meddle with Beckley matters. Therefore Russel for\nthe time withdrew, but promised to return in half an hour, not only\nfor the sake of consulting with the Squire, but also because he\nsuspected that Cripps might be come on an errand different from what\nMary had imagined.\n\nMeanwhile, the Carrier could hardly be kept from bursting in\nhead-foremost. Betty, the cook, laid hold of him in the passage, while\nhe was short of breath; but he pushed at even her, although he ought\nto have known better manners. Betty was also in a state of mind at\nhaving cooked no dinner worth speaking of since Tuesday; and Cripps,\nif his wits had been about him, must have yielded space and bowed.\nBetty, however, was nearly as wide, and a great deal thicker than he\nwas; and she spread forth two great arms that might have stopped even\nDobbin with a load downhill.\n\nAt last the signal was passed that Cripps might now come on, and tell\nhis tale; and he felt as if he should have served them right by\nrefusing to say anything. But when he saw the Squire's jovial face\ndrawn thin with misery, and his sturdy form unlike itself, and the\nsoft puzzled manner in lieu of the old distinct demand to know\neverything, Zacchary Cripps came forward gently, and thought of what\nhe had to tell, with fear.\n\n\"What is it, my good fellow?\" asked the Squire, perceiving his\nhesitation. \"Nothing amiss with your household, I sincerely hope, my\nfriend? You are a fortunate man in one thing--you have had no children\nyet.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay; your Worship is right enough there. The Lord lends they, and\nHe takes them away. And the taking be worse than the giving was good.\"\n\n\"Now, Master Cripps, we must not talk so. All is meant for the best, I\ndoubt.\"\n\n\"Her may be. Her may be,\" Cripps replied. \"The Lord is the one to\npronounce upon that, knowing His own maning best. But He do give very\nhard measure some time to them as have never desarved it. Now, there\nbe your poor Miss Grace, for instance. As nice a young lady as ever\nlived; the purtiest ever come out of a bed; that humble, too, and\ngracious always, that 'Cripps,' she would say--nay 'Master\nCripps'--she always give me my proper title, even on a dirty linen\nday--'Master Cripps,' her always said, 'let me mark it off, in your\nhat, for you'--no matter whether it was my best hat, or the one with\nthe grease come through--'Master Cripps,' she always say, 'let me mark\nit out for you.'\"\n\n\"Very well, Cripps. I know all that. It is nothing to what my Grace\nwas. And I hope, with God's blessing, she will do it again. But what\nis it you are so full of, Cripps?\"\n\nThe Carrier felt in the crown of his hat, and then inside the lining;\nas if he had something entered there, to help him in this predicament.\nAnd then he turned away, to wipe--as if the weather was very wet--the\ndrops of the hedge from the daze of his eyes; and after that he could\nnot help himself, but out with everything.\n\n\"I knows where Miss Gracie be,\" he began with a little defiance, as\nif, after all, it was nothing to him, but a thing that he might have a\nbet about. \"I knows where our Miss Gracie lies--dead and cold--dead\nand cold--without no coffin, nor a winding-sheet--the purty crature,\nthe purty crature--there, what a fool I be, good Lord!\"\n\nMaster Cripps, at the picture himself had drawn, was taken with a\nshort fit of sobs, and turned away, partly to hunt for his \"kercher,\"\nand partly to shun the poor Squire's eyes. Mr. Oglander slowly laid\ndown the pen, which he had taken for notes of a case, and standing as\nfirm as his own great oak-tree (famous in that neighbourhood), gave no\nsign of the shock, except in the colour of his face, and the\nbrightness of his gaze.\n\n\"Go on, Cripps, as soon as you can,\" he said in a calm and gentle\nvoice. \"Try not to keep me waiting, Cripps.\"\n\n\"I be trying; I be trying all I knows. The blessed angel be dead and\nburied, close to Tickuss's tatie crop, in the corner of bramble\nquarry. At least, I mean Tickuss's taties was there; but he dug them a\nfortnight, come Monday, he did.\"\n\n\"The corner of the 'Gipsy's Grave,' as they call it. Who found it? How\ndo you know it?\"\n\n\"Esther was there. She seed the whole of it. Before the snow\ncome--last Tuesday night.\"\n\n\"Tuesday night! Ah, Tuesday night!\"--for the moment, the old man had\nlost his clearness. \"It can't have been Tuesday night--it was\nWednesday when I rode down to my sister's. Cripps, your sister must\nhave dreamed it. My darling was then at her aunt's, quite safe. You\nhave frightened me for nothing, Cripps.\"\n\n\"I am glad with all my heart,\" cried Zacchary; \"I am quite sure it\nwere Tuesday night, because of Mrs. Exie. And your Worship knows best\nof the days, no doubt. Thank the Lord for all His mercies! Well,\nseeing now it were somebody else, in no ways particular, and perhaps\none of them gipsy girls as took the fever to Cowley, if your Worship\nwill take your pen again, I will tell you all as Esther seed:--Two men\nwith a pickaxe working, where the stone overhangeth so, and the corpse\nof a nice young woman laid for the stone to bury it natural. No harm\nat all in the world, when you come to think, being nought of a\nChristian body. And they let go the rock, and it come down over, to\nsave all infection. Lord, what a turn that Etty gived me, all about a\ntrifle!\" The Carrier wiped his forehead, and smiled. \"And won't I give\nit well to her?\"\n\n\"Poor girl! It is no trifle, Cripps, whoever it may have been. But\nstop--I am all abroad. It was Tuesday afternoon when my poor darling\nleft Mrs. Fermitage. And to the quarry, across the fields, from the\nway she would come, is not half a mile--half a mile of fields and\nhedgerows---- Oh, Cripps, it was my daughter!\"\n\n\"Her maight a' been, sure enough,\" said Cripps, in whom the reflective\nvein, for the moment, had crossed the sentimental--\"sure enough, her\nmaight a' been. A pasture meadow, and a field of rape, and Gibbs's\nturnips, and then a fallow, and then into Tickuss's taties--half an\nhour maight a' done the carrying--and consarning of the rest--your\nWorship, now when did she leave the lady? Can you count the time of\nit?\"\n\n\"Zacchary now, the will of the Lord be done, without calculation! My\ngrave is all I care to count on, if my Grace lies buried so. But\nbefore I go to it, please God, I will find out who has done it!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nALL DEAD AGAINST HIM.\n\n\n\"Now, do 'ee put on a muffler, sir,\" cried Mary, running out with her\narms full, as Mr. Oglander set forth in the bitter air, without\novercoat, but ready to meet everything. At the door was his old\nWhitechapel cart, with a fresh young colt between the shafts, pawing\nthe snow, and snorting; the only one of his little stud not lamed by\nrugged travelling. The floor of the cart was jingling with iron tools,\nas the young horse shook himself; and the Squire's groom, and two\ngardeners, were ready to jump in, when called for. They stamped a\nlittle, and flapped their bodies, as if they would like a cordial; but\ntheir master was too busy with his own heart to remember it.\n\n\"If we be goin' to dig some hours in such weather as this be,\" Mr.\nKale managed to whisper--\"best way put in a good brandy flask, Mary,\nmy dear, with Master's leave. Poor soul, a' can't heed everything.\"\n\n\"Go along,\" answered Mary; \"you have had enough. Shamed I be of you,\nto think of such things, and to look at that poor Hangel!\"\n\n\"So plaize your Worship, let me drive,\" said Cripps, who was going to\nsit in front. \"A young horse, and you at your time of life, and all\nthis trouble over you!\"\n\n\"Give me the reins, my friend,\" cried his Worship; and Cripps, in some\ndread for his neck, obeyed. The men jumped in, and the young horse\nstarted at a rather dangerous pace. Many a time had Miss Grace fed\nhim, and he used to follow her, like a lamb.\n\n\"He will take us safe enough,\" said the Squire; \"he seems to know what\nhe is going for.\"\n\nNot another word was spoken, until they came to the gap at the verge\nof the quarry, where the frosty moon shone through it. \"Tie him here,\"\nsaid the master shortly, as the groom produced his ring-rope; \"and\nthrow the big cloth over him. Now, all of you come; and Cripps go\nfirst.\"\n\nScared as they were, they could not in shame decline the old man's\norders; and the sturdy Cripps, with a spade on his shoulders, led\nthrough the drifted thicket. Behind him plodded the Squire, with an\nunlit lantern in one hand, and a stout oak staff in the other; the\nmoonlight glistening in his long white hair, and sparkling frost in\nhis hoary beard. The snow before them showed no print larger than the\npad of an old dog-fox pursuing the spluttering track of a pheasant's\nspurs; and it crunched beneath their boots with the crusty impact of\ncrisp severance. All around was white and waste with depth of unknown\nloneliness; and Master Cripps said for the rest of his life, that he\ncould not tell what he was about, to do it!\n\nAfter many flounderings in and out of hollow places, they came to the\ncorner of the quarry-dingle, and found it entirely choked with snow.\nThe driving of the north-east wind had gathered as into a funnel\nthere, and had stacked the snow of many acres in a hollow of less than\nhalf a rood. The men stopped short, where the gaunt brown fern, and\nthen the furze, and then the hazels, in rising tier waded out of\nsight; and behind them even some ash-saplings scarcely had a knuckled\njoint to lift from out their burial. Over the whole the cold moon\nshone, and made the depth look deeper. The men stopped short, and\nlooked at their shovels, and looked at one another. They may not have\nbeen very bright of mind, or accustomed to hurried conclusions; and\ndoubtless they were, as true Englishmen are, of a tough unelastic\nfibre. All powers of evil were banded against them, and they saw no\nturn to take; still it was not their own wish to go back, without\nhaving struck a blow for it.\n\n\"You can do nothing,\" said the Squire, with perhaps the first bitter\nfeeling he had yet displayed. \"All things are dead against me; I must\ngrin, as you say, and bear it. It would take a whole corps of sappers\nand miners a week to clear this place out. We cannot even be sure of\nthe spot; we cannot tell where the corner is; all is smothered up so.\nIll luck always rides ill luck. This proves beyond doubt that my child\nlies here!\"\n\nThe men were good men, as men go, and they all felt love and pity for\nthe lost young lady and the poor old master. Still their fingers were\nso blue, and their frozen feet so hard to feel, and the deep white\ngulf before them surged so palpably invincible, that they could not\nrepine at a dispensation which sent them home to their suppers.\n\n\"Nort to be done till change of weather,\" said Cripps, as they sat in\nthe cart again; \"I reckon they villains knew what was coming, better\nnor I, who have kept the road, man and boy, for thirty year. The Lord\nknoweth best, as He always do! But to my mind He maneth to kape on\nsnowing and freezing for a month at laste. Moon have changed last\nnight, I b'lieve; and a bitter moon we shall have of it.\"\n\nAnd so they did; the bitterest moon, save one, of the present century.\nAnd old men said that there had not been such a winter, and such a\nsight of snow, since the one which the Lord had sent on purpose to\ndiscomfit Bony.\n\nMr. Oglander, in his lonely home, strove bravely to make the best of\nit. He had none of that grand religious consolation which some people\nhave (especially for others), and he grounded his happiness perhaps\ntoo much upon his own hearthstone. His mind was not an extraordinary\none, and his soul was too old-fashioned to demand periods of purging.\n\nMoreover, his sister Joan came up--a truly pious and devoted woman,\nthe widow of an Oxford wine-merchant. Mrs. Fermitage loved her niece\nso deeply that she had no patience with any selfish pinings after her.\n\"She is gone to the better land,\" she said; \"the shores of bliss\nunspeakable!--unless Russel Overshute knows about her a great deal\nmore than he will tell. I have far less confidence in that young man\nsince he took to wear india-rubber. But to wish her back is a very\nsinful and unchristian act, I fear.\"\n\n\"Now, Joan, you know that you wish her back every time that you sit\ndown, or get up, or go to tea without her.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know, I know, I do. And most of all when I pour it out--she\nused to do it for me. But, Worth, you can wrestle more than I can. The\nLord expects so much more of a man!\"\n\nBeing exhorted thus, the Squire did his best to wrestle. Not that any\nwords of hers could carry now their former weight; for if he had no\ndaughter left, what good was money left to her? The Squire did not\nwant his sister's money for himself at all. Indeed, he would rather be\nwithout it. Dirty money, won by trade!--but still it had been his duty\nalways to try to get it for his daughter. And this is worth a word or\ntwo.\n\nAt the Oxford bank, and among the lawyers and the leading tradesmen,\nit had been a well-known thing that old Fermitage had not died with\nless than \u00c2\u00a3150,000 behind him. Even in Oxford there never had been a\nman so illustrious for port wine. \"Fortiter occupa portum\" was the\nmotto over the door to his vaults, and he fortified port impregnably.\nTherefore he supplied all the common-room cellars, which cannot have\ntoo much geropiga; and among the undergraduates his name was surety\nfor another glass. And there really was a port wine basis; so that\nnobody died of him.\n\nAll these things are beside the mark. Mr. Fermitage, however, went on,\nand hit his mark continually; and his mark was that bull's eye of this\ngolden age, a yellow imprint of a dragon. So many of these came\npouring in that he kept them in bottles without any \"kicks,\" sealed,\nand left to mature, and acquire \"the genuine bottle flavour.\" When he\nhad bottled half a pipe of these, and was thinking of beginning now to\nstore them in the wood, a man coming down with a tap found him dead;\nand was too much scared to steal anything.\n\nThis man reproached himself, ever afterwards, for his irresolute\nconscience; and the two executors gave him nothing but blame for his\nbehaviour. People in Holiwell said that these two took a dozen bottles\nof guineas between them, to toast their testator's memory; but\nHoliwell never has been famous for the holy thing lying at the bottom\nof the well. Enough that he was dead; and every man, seeing his\nfuneral, praised him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nKNOCKER VERSUS BELL-PULL.\n\n\nThere is, or was, a street in Oxford, near the ruins of the ancient\ncastle, and behind the new county jail, where one of the many offsets\nof the Isis filters its artificial way beneath low arches and betwixt\ndead walls; and this street (partly destroyed since then) was known to\nthe elder generation by the name of \"Cross Duck Lane.\" Of course what\nremains of it now exults in an infinitely grander title, though\nsmelling thereby no sweeter. With that we have nothing to do; the\nstreet was \"Cross Duck Lane\" in our time.\n\nHere, in a highly respectable house, a truly respectable man was\nliving, with his business and his family. \"Luke Sharp, gentleman,\" was\nhis name, description, style, and title; and he was not by any means a\nbad man, so as to be an Attorney.\n\nThis man possessed a great deal of influence, having much\nhouse-property; and he never in the least disguised his sentiments, or\nplayed fast and loose with them. Being of a commanding figure, and\nfine straightforward aspect, he left an impression, wherever he went,\nof honesty, vigour, and manliness. And he went into very good society,\nas often as he cared to do so; for although not a native of Oxford,\nbut of unknown (though clearly large) origin, he now was the head, and\nindeed the entirety, of a long-established legal firm. He had married\nthe daughter of the senior partner, and bought or ousted away the\nrest; and although the legend on his plate was still \"Piper, Pepper,\nSharp, and Co.,\" every one knew that the learning, wealth, and honour\nof the whole concern were now embodied in Mr. Luke Sharp. Such a man\nwas under no necessity ever to blow his own trumpet.\n\nHis wife, a fat and goodly person, Miranda Piper of former days,\nhappened to be the first cousin and nearest relative of a famous\nman--\"Port-wine Fermitage\" himself; and his death had affected her\nvery sadly. For she found that he had provided for himself a most\nprecarious future, by unjust disposal of his worldly goods, which he\ncould not come back to rectify. To his godson, her only child and her\nidol, Christopher Fermitage Sharp, he had left a copy of Dr.\nDoddridge's \"Expositor,\" and nothing else! A golden work, no\ndoubt--but still golden precepts fill no purse, but rather tend to\nempty it. Mrs. Luke Sharp, though a very good Christian, repacked and\nsent back the \"Expositor.\"\n\nIf Mr. Sharp had been at home, he would not have let her do so. He was\nfull at all times of large generous impulse, but never yet guilty of\nimpulsive acts. It had always been said that his son was to have the\nbottled half-pipe of gold, or the chief body of it, after the widow's\nlife-interest. Whereas now, Mrs. Fermitage, if she liked, might roll\nall the bottles down the High Street. She, however, was a careful\nwoman; and it was manifest where the whole of this C\u00c3\u00b4te d'Or vintage\nwould be binned away--to wit, in the cellars of Beckley Barton, with\nthe key at Grace Oglander's very pretty waist. Mr. Sharp at the moment\ncould descry no cure; but still to show temper was a vulgar thing.\n\nNow, upon the New Year's Day of 1838, the bitter weather continuing\nstill, and doing its best to grow more bitter, Mr. Sharp, being of a\nfestive turn, had closed his office early. The demand for universal\nclosing and perpetual holiday had not yet risen to its present height,\nand the clerks, though familiar with the kindness of their principal,\nscarcely expected such a premature relief. But this only added to the\nsatisfaction with which they went home to their New Year dinners.\n\nBut Mr. Sharp, though of early habits, and hungry at proper seasons,\nwas not preparing for his dinner now. He had ordered his turkey to be\nkept back, and begged his wife to see to it until he could make out\nand settle the import of a letter which reached him about one o'clock.\nIt had been delivered by a groom on horseback, who had suffered some\ninward struggle before he had stooped to ring the Attorney's bell. For\n\"Cross Duck House,\" though a comfortable place, was not of an\naristocratic cast. The letter was short, and expounded little.\n\n    \"SIR,--I shall do myself the honour of calling upon you at four\n    o'clock this afternoon, upon some important business.\n\n    \"Obediently yours,\n\n    \"RUSSEL OVERSHUTE.\"\n\nIt is not altogether an agreeable thing, even for a man with the\nfinest conscience, such as Mr. Sharp was blest with, to receive a\nchallenge upon an unknown point, curtly worded in this wise. And the\npleasure does not increase, when the strong correspondent is partly\nsuspected of holding unfavourable views towards one, and the gaze of\nself-inspection needs a little more time to compose itself. Luke Sharp\nhad led an unblemished life, since the follies of his youth subsided;\nhe subscribed to inevitable charities; and he waited for his rents,\nwhen sure of them. Still he did not like that letter.\n\nNow he took off the coat which he wore at his desk, and his waistcoat\nof the morning, and washed his nice white hands, and clothed himself\nin expensive dignity. Then he opened his book of daily entries, and\nfolded blotting-paper, and prepared to receive instructions, or give\nadvice, or be wise abstractedly. But he thought it a sound precaution\nto have his son Christopher within earshot; for young Overshute was\nreputed to be of a rather excitable nature; therefore Kit Sharp was\ncommanded to finish the cleaning of his gun--which was his chief\ndelight--in his father's closet adjoining the office, and to keep the\ndoor shut, unless called for.\n\nThe lawyer was not kept waiting long. As the clock of St. Thomas\nstruck four, the shoes of a horse rang sharply on the icy road, and\nthe office-bell kicked up its tongue, with a jerk showing great\nextra-mural energy. \"Let him ring again,\" said Mr. Sharp; \"I defy him\nto ring much harder.\"\n\nThe defiance was soon proved to be unsound; for in less than ten\nseconds, the bell, which had stood many years of strong emotion, was\nvisited with such a violent spasm that nothing short of the\nmelting-pot restored its constitution. A piece clinked on the passage\nfloor, and the lawyer was filled with unfeigned wrath. That bell had\nbeen ringing for three generations, and was the Palladium of the firm.\n\n\"What clumsy clod-hopper,\" cried Mr. Sharp, rushing out, as if he saw\nnobody--\"what beggarly bumpkin has broken my bell? Mr. Overshute!--oh!\nI beg pardon, I am sure!\"\n\n\"We must make allowance,\" said Russel calmly, \"for fidgety animals,\nMr. Sharp; and for thick gloves in this frosty weather. John, take my\nhorse on the Seven-bridges road, and be back in exactly fifteen\nminutes. How kind of you to be at home, Mr. Sharp!\"\n\nWith the words, the young man bestowed on the lawyer a short sharp\nglance, which entirely failed to penetrate the latter.\n\n\"Shut out this cold wind, for Heaven's sake!\" he exclaimed, as he shut\nin his visitor. \"You young folk never seem to feel the cold. But you\ncarry it a little too far sometimes. Ah, I must have been about your\nage when we had such another hard winter as this, four and twenty\nyears ago. Scarcely so bitter, but a deal more snow; snow, snow, six\nfeet everywhere. I was six and twenty then--about your age, I take it,\nsir?\"\n\n\"My age to a tittle,\" said Overshute; \"but I am generally taken for\nthirty-two. How can you have guessed it so?\"\n\n\"Early thought, sir, juvenile thought, and advanced intelligence make\nyoung people look far in front of their age. When you come to my time\nof life, young sir, your thoughts and your looks will be younger. Now\ntake this chair. Never mind your boots; let them hiss as they will on\nthe fender. I like to hear it--a genial sound--a touch of emery paper\nin the morning, and there we are, ready for other boots. I have had\nmen here come fifty miles across country, as the crow flies, to see\nme, when the floods were out; and go away with minds comforted.\"\n\n\"I have heard of your skill in all legal points. But I am not come on\nthat account. Quibbles and shuffles I detest.\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Overshute, I have met with a good deal of rudeness in my\nearly days; before I was known, as I am now. It was worth my while to\ndisarm it then. It is not so now, in your case. You belong to a very\ngood county family; and although you are committed to inferior hands,\nif you had come in a friendly spirit, I would have been glad to serve\nyou. As it is, I can only request you to say what your purpose is, and\nto settle it.\"\n\nRussel Overshute, with his large and powerful eyes, gazed straight at\nSharp; and Mr. Sharp (who had steely eyes--the best of all for getting\non with--not very large, but as keen as need be) therewith answered\ncomplacently, and as if he saw hope of amusement.\n\n\"You puzzle me, Sharp,\" said Overshute--about the worst thing he could\nhave said; and he knew it before the words had passed.\n\n\"I am called, for the most part, 'Mister Sharp,' except by gentlemen\nof my own age, or friends who entirely trust me. Mr. Russel Overshute,\nexplain how I have puzzled you.\"\n\n\"Never mind that. You would never understand. Have you any idea what\nhas brought me here?\"\n\n\"Yes, to be plain with you, I have. One of your least, but very oldest\ntenants, has been caught out in poaching. You hate the game-laws; you\nare a Radical, ranter, and reformer. You know that your lawyer is good\nand active, but too well known as a Liberal. It requires a man of\nsettled principles to contest with the game-laws.\"\n\n\"You could not be more wide astray!\" cried young Overshute\ntriumphantly, taking in every word the other had said, as a piece of\nhis victory. \"No, no, thank goodness, we are not come so low that we\ncannot get off our tenants, in spite of any evidence; you must indeed\nthink that our family is quite reduced to the dirt, if we can no\nlonger do even that much.\"\n\n\"Not at all, sir. You are much too hot. I only supposed for the moment\nthat your principles might have stopped you.\"\n\n\"Oh dear, no! My mother could not take it at all, in that way. Now,\nwhere have you put Grace Oglander?\"\n\nImpetuous Russel, with his nostrils quivering, and his eyes fixed on\nthe lawyer's, and his right hand clenching his heavy whip, purposely\nfired his question thus, like a thunderbolt out of pure heaven. He\nfelt sure of producing a grand effect; and so he did, but not the\nright one.\n\n\"You threaten me, do you?\" said Mr. Sharp. \"I think that you make a\nmistake, young man. Violence is objectionable in every way, though\nnatural with fools, who believe they are the stronger. I am sorry to\nhave spoiled your whip; but you will acknowledge that the fault was\nyours. Now, I am ready for reason--if you are.\"\n\nWith a grave bow, Luke Sharp offered Russel the fragments of his pet\nhunting-crop, which he had caught from his hand, and snapped like a\nstick of peppermint, as he spoke. Overshute thought himself a fine,\nstrong fellow, and with very good reason; but the quickness of his\nantagonist left him gasping.\n\n\"I want no apologies,\" Mr. Sharp continued, going to his desk; while\nthe young man looked sadly at his brazen-knockered butt, for he had\nbeen at that admirable college, and cherished his chief reminiscence\nof it thus. \"Apologies are always waste of time. You have threatened\nme, and you have found your mistake. Such a formidable antagonist\nmakes one's hand shake. Still, I think that I can hit my key-hole.\"\n\n\"You can always make your keys fit, I dare say. But you never could do\nthat to me again.\"\n\n\"Very likely not. I shall never care to try it. Physical force is\nalways low. But, as a gentleman, you must own that you first offered\nviolence.\"\n\n\"Mr. Sharp, I confess that I did. Not in word, or deed; but still my\nmanner fairly imported it. And the first respect I ever felt for you,\nI feel now, for your quickness and pluck.\"\n\n\"I am pleased with any respect from you; because you have little for\nanything. Now, repeat your question, moderately.\"\n\n\"Where have you put Grace Oglander?\"\n\n\"Let me offer you a chair again. Striding about with frozen feet is\nalmost the worst thing a man can do. However, you seem to be a little\nexcited. Have you brought me a letter from my client, to authorize\nthis inquiry?\"\n\n\"From Mr. Oglander? Oh no! He has no idea of my being here.\"\n\n\"We will get over that. You are a friend of his, and a neighbour. He\nhas asked you, in a general way, to help him in this sad great\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"Not at all. He would rather not have my interference. He does not\nlike its motive.\"\n\n\"And the motive is, that like many other people, you were attached to\nthis young lady?\"\n\n\"Certainly, I am. I would give my life at any moment for her.\"\n\n\"Well, well; I will not speak quite so strongly as you do. Life grows\ndearer as it gets more short. But still, I would give my best year\nremaining to get to the bottom of this problem.\"\n\n\"You would?\" cried young Overshute, looking at him, with admiration of\nhis strength and truth. \"Give me your hand, sir? I have wronged you! I\nsee that I am but a hasty fool!\"\n\n\"You should never own that,\" said the lawyer.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nMR. JOHN SMITH.\n\n\nMeanwhile all Beckley and villages around were seething with a ferment\nof excitement and contradiction. Esther Cripps had been strictly\nordered by the authorities to hold her tongue; and so far as in her\nlay she did so. But there were others--the Squire's three men, and\neven the Carrier himself, who had so many things to think, that they\nwere pretty sure to say some of them. One or two of them had wives;\nand though these women could not be called by their very worst friends\n\"inquisitive,\" it was not right and lawful that they should be\ndebarred of everything. They did all they could not to know any more\nthan they were really bound to know; and whatever was forced upon them\nhad no chance of going any further.\n\nThis made several women look at one another slyly, each knowing more\nthan the other, and nodding while sounding the other's ignorance.\nUntil, with one accord they grew provoked at being treated so; and\ntruth being multiplied to its cube became, of course, infinite error.\n\nNow, Mrs. Fermitage having been obliged to return to Cowley, Mary\nHookham's mother had established her power by this time; and being, as\nher daughter had pronounced, a conspicuous member of the females, she\nexerted herself about all that was said, and saw the other side of\neverything. She never went to no public-house--nobody could say that\nof her; but perhaps she could put two and two together every bit as\nwell as them that did. It had been her fortune to acquire exceptional\nexperience--or, as she put it more plainly, \"she had a seed a many\nthings;\" and the impressions left thereby upon her idiosyncrasy (or,\nin her own words, \"what she come to think\") was and were that nothing\ncould be true that she had not known the like of. This was the secret\nof her success in life--which, however, as yet bore no proportion to\nher merits. She frankly scouted as \"a pack of stuff\" everything to\nwhich her history afforded no vivid parallel. In a word, she believed\nonly what she had seen.\n\nNow, incredulity is a grand power. To be able to say, \"Oh, don't tell\nme,\" or \"None of your stuff!\" when the rest of the audience, stricken\nwith awe, is gaping, confers at once the esteem of superior intellect\nand vigour. And when there are good high people, who derive comfort\nfrom the denial, the chances are that the active sceptic does not get\nthe worst of it.\n\nMrs. Hookham plainly declared that Esther's tale was neither more nor\nless than a trumpery cock-and-bull story. She would not call it a\nparcel of lies, because the poor girl might have dreamed it. Walking\nin the snow was no more than walking in one's sleep; she knew that,\nfrom her own experience; and if there had been no snow as yet, that\nmade her all the more sure to be right; the air was full of it, and of\ncourse it would have more power overhead. Depend upon it, she had seen\na bush, if indeed she did see anything, and being so dazed by the\nweather, she had gone and dreamed the rest of it.\n\nBeckley, on the other hand, having known Esther ever since she toddled\nout of her cradle, and knowing her brothers, the carrier, the baker,\nand the butcher, and having no experience yet of Mother Hookham's\nwisdom, as good as told the latter lady not to be \"so bounceable.\" She\nmust not come into this parish, and pretend to know more about things\nthat belonged to it than those who were bred and born there.\n\nBut Mrs. Hookham's opinion was, in one way, very important, however\nlittle weight it carried at the Dusty Anvil. Mr. Oglander himself had\nto depend for his food entirely on Mrs. Hookham's efforts; for Betty,\nthe cook, went purely off her head, after all she had gone through;\nand they put her in bed with a little barley-water, and much malt\nliquor in a nobler form. And though Mrs. Hookham at her time of life\nwas reluctant so to demean herself, she found all the rest such a\n\"Noah's compass,\" that she roused up the fires of departed youth, and\nflourished with the basting-ladle. A clever well-conditioned dame,\nwith a will of her own, is somebody.\n\n\"Now, sir,\" she cried, rushing in to the Squire, with a basin of\nfirst-rate ox-tail soup, upon that melancholy New Year's Day, \"you\nhave been out in the snow again! No use denying of it, sir; I can see\nit by the chattering of your teeth. I call it a bad, wicked thing to\ngo on so. Flying in the face of the Lord like that!\"\n\n\"You are a most kind and good soul, Mrs. Hookham. But surely you would\nnot have me sit with my hands crossed, doing nothing.\"\n\n\"No, no; surely not. Take the spoon in one hand, and the basin in the\nother. You owe it to yourself to keep up your strength, and to some\none else as well, good sir.\"\n\n\"I have no one else now to owe it to,\" the old man answered, sadly\ntucking his napkin into his waistcoat pockets.\n\n\"Yes, you have. You have your Miss Gracie, alive and kicking, as sure\nas I be; and with a deal more of life in front of her; though scarce a\nweek passes but what I takes my regular dose of calumny. Ah, if it had\nnot been for that, I never could have been twenty year a widow.\"\n\n\"Don't cry, Mrs. Hookham. I beg you not to cry. You have many good\nchildren to look after; and there still is abundance of calomel. But\nwhy do you talk so about my darling?\"\n\n\"Because, sir, please God, I means to see you spend many a happy year\ntogether. Lord have mercy, if I had took for granted every trouble as\ncome upon me, who could a' tried for to cheat me this day? My\ngoodness, don't go for to swallow the bones, sir!\"\n\n\"To be sure not. No, I was not thinking. Of course there are bones in\nevery tail.\"\n\n\"And a heap of bones in them Crippses' tale, sir, as won't go down\nwith me nohow. Have faith in the mercy of the Lord, sir; and in your\nown experience.\"\n\n\"That is exactly what I try to do. There cannot be any one in the\nworld so bad as to hurt my Gracie. Mrs. Hookham, you never can have\nseen anybody like her. She was so full of life and kindness that\neverybody who knew her seemed to have her in their own family. She\nnever made pretence to be above herself, or any one; and she entered\ninto everybody's trouble quite as if she had brought it on. She never\nasked them any questions, whether it might have been their own fault;\nand she gave away all her own money first before she came to me for\nmore. She was so simple, and so pleasant, and so full of playful\nways--but there, when I think of that, it makes me almost as bad as\nyou women are. Take out the dish. I am very much obliged to you.\"\n\n\"Not a bit, sir, not a bit as yet,\" the brisk dame answered, with\ntears on her cheeks. \"But before very long, you will own that you was;\nwhen you find every word I say come true. Oh my! How that startled me!\nSomebody coming the short way from the fields! That wonderful man, as\nis always prowling about, unbeknown to any one. They don't like me in\nthe village much, civil as I am to all of them. But as sure as six is\nhalf a dozen, that Smith is the one they ought to hate.\"\n\n\"If he is there, show him in at once,\" said the Squire, without\nfurther argument; \"and let no one come interrupting us.\"\n\nThis was very hard upon Mrs. Hookham; and she could not help showing\nit in her answer.\n\n\"Oh, to be sure, sir! Oh, to be sure not! What is my poor opinion\ncompared to his? Ah well, it is a fine thing to be a man!\"\n\nThe man, for whose sake she was thus cast out, seemed to be of the\nsame opinion. He walked, and looked, and spoke as if it was indeed a\nfine thing to be a man; but the finest of all things to be the man\ninside his own cloth and leather. Short and thick of form he was, and\nlikely to be at close quarters a dangerous antagonist. And the set of\nhis jaws, and the glance of his eyes, showed that no want of manhood\nwould at the critical moment disable him. His face was of a strong red\ncolour, equally spread all over it, as if he lived much in the open\nair, and fed well, and enjoyed his food.\n\n\"John Smith, your Worship--John Smith,\" he said, without troubling\nMrs. Hookham. \"I hope I see your Worship better. Don't rise, I beg of\nyou. May I shut the door? Oh, Mary, your tea is waiting.\"\n\n\"Mary, indeed!\" cried widow Hookham, ungraciously departing; \"young\nman, address my darter thus!\"\n\n\"Now, what have you done, Smith, what have you done?\" the old\ngentleman asked, stooping over him. \"Or have you done nothing at all\nas usual? You tell me to have patience every day, and every day I have\nless and less.\"\n\n\"The elements are against us, sir. If the weather had been anything\nbut what it is, I must have known everything long ago. Stop, sir,\nstop; it is no idle excuse, as you seem to fancy. It is not the snow\nthat I speak of; it is the intense and deadly cold, that keeps all but\nthe very strong people indoors. How can any man talk when his beard is\nfrozen? Look, sir!\"\n\nFrom his short brown beard he took lumps of ice, beginning to thaw in\nthe warmth of the room, and cast them into the fire to hiss. Mr.\nOglander gazed as if he thought that his visitor took a liberty, but\none that could not matter much. \"Go on, sir, with your report,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Well, sir, in this chain of crime,\" Mr. Smith replied in a sprightly\nmanner, \"we have found one very important link.\"\n\n\"What is it, Smith? Don't keep me waiting. Don't fear me. I am now\nprepared to stand anything whatever.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, we have discovered, at last, the body of your Worship's\ndaughter.\"\n\nThe Squire bowed, and hid his face. By the aid of faith, he had been\nhoping against hope, till it came to this. Then he looked up, with his\nbright old eyes for the moment very steady, and said with a firm\nthough hollow voice--\n\n\"The will of the Lord be done! The will of the Lord be done, Smith.\"\n\n\"The will of the Lord shall not be done,\" cried Mr. Smith\nemphatically, and striking his thick knees with his fist, \"until the\nman who has done it shall be swung, Squire, swung! Make up your mind\nto that, your Worship. You may safely make up your mind to that.\"\n\n\"What good will it do me?\" the father asked, talking with himself\nalone. \"Will it ever bring back my girl--my child? Bereaved I am, but\nit cannot be long! I shall meet her in a better world, Smith.\"\n\n\"To be sure your Worship will, with the angels and archangels. But to\nmy mind that will be no satisfaction, till the man has swung for it.\"\n\n\"Excuse me for a moment, will you, Mr. Smith, excuse me? I have no\nright to be overcome, and I thought I had got beyond all that. Ring\nthe bell, and they will bring you cold sirloin and a jug of ale. Help\nyourself, and don't mind me. I will come back directly. No, thank you;\nI can walk alone. How many have had much worse to bear! You will find\nthe under-cut the best.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nMR. SMITH IS ACTIVE.\n\n\nMr. John Smith was a little upset at seeing the Squire so put out. But\nhe said to himself: \"It is natural--after all, it is natural. Poor old\nchap! he has taken it as well as could be expected. However, we must\nall live; and I feel uncommonly peckish just now. I declare I would\nrather have had something hot, this weather. But in such a case, one\nmust put up with things. I wonder if they have got any horseradish.\nAll frozen hard in the ground, I fear--no harm, at any rate, in\nasking.\"\n\nWith this self-commune he rang the bell; and Mary, by her mother's\norder, answered. \"I'll not go nigh the baste!\" cried widow Hookham,\nstill indignant. Mary, like a good maid, laid the cloth without a\nsyllable, and, like a good young woman, took the keenest heed of Mr.\nSmith, without letting him dream that she peeped at him.\n\n\"Thank you, Mary,\" said Mr. Smith, to open conversation.\n\n\"My mother's name is Mary,\" she answered, \"and perhaps you would like\nsome pickles.\"\n\n\"By all means, as there is no horseradish. Bring onions, gherkins, and\nwalnuts, Mary. But above all things, walnuts.\"\n\n\"You must have what you can get,\" said Mary. \"I will go and tell\nmaster what you require.\"\n\n\"On no account, Mary; on no account! He is gone away to pray, I\nbelieve. On no account disturb him.\"\n\n\"Poor dear, I should hope not. Perhaps you can manage with what I have\nset before you.\"\n\n\"I will do my best,\" he answered.\n\n\"The scum of the earth!\" said Mary to herself; good servants being the\nmost intensely aristocratic of all the world.\n\n\"He never dined at a gentleman's table before, and his head is turned\nwith it. Our kitchen is too good for him. But poor master never heeds\nnothing now.\"\n\nAs soon, however, as Mr. Smith had appeased the rage of hunger, and\nhaving called for a glass of hot brandy and water, was clinking the\nspoon in it, the Squire showed that he did heed something, by coming\nback calmly to talk with him. Mr. Oglander had passed the bitterest\nhour of his long life yet; filled at every turn of thought with\nyearning to break down and weep. Sometimes his mind was so confused\nthat he did not know how old he was, but seemed to be in the long past\ndays, with his loving wife upon his arm, and their Gracie toddling in\nfront of them. He spoke to them both as he used to do, and speaking\ncleared his thoughts again; and he shook away the dreamy joy in the\nblank forlorn of facts. At last he washed his face, and brushed his\nsilver hair and untended beard, and half in the looking-glass expected\nto see his daughter scolding him, because he knew that he had\nneglected many things she insisted on; and his conscience caught him\nwhen he seemed to be taking a low advantage.\n\n\"I hope you have been treated well,\" he said, with his fine\nold-fashioned bow, to Smith, as he came back again. \"I do not often\nleave my guests to attend to themselves in this way.\"\n\n\"Don't apologize, Squire, I beg you. I have done first chop, I assure\nyou, sir. I have not tasted real mustard, ground at home as yours is,\nsince I was up in Durham county, where they never grow it.\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Smith,\" said the Squire, trying to smile at his\nfacetiousness, \"I am very glad that you have done well. In weather\nlike this, a young man like you must want a good deal of nourishment.\nBut now, will you--will you tell me----\"\n\n\"Yes, your Worship, everything! Of course you are anxious; and I\nthoroughly enter into your feelings. There are none of the women at\nthe door, I hope?\"\n\n\"Such things do not happen in my house. I will not interrupt you.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir; then sit down here. You must be aware in the first\nplace, then, that I was not likely to be content with your way of\nregarding things. The Lord is the Lord of the weather, of course, and\ndoes it without consulting us. Nevertheless, He allows us also to do\nour best against it. So I took the bull by the horns, as John Bull, by\nhis name, has a right to do. I just resolved to beat the weather, and\nhave it out with everything. So I communicated with the authorities in\nLondon. You know we are in a transition state--a transition state at\npresent, sir--between the old system and the new.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, of course I know all that.\"\n\n\"Very well, your Worship, we are obliged, of course, to be doubly\ncareful. In London, we are quite established; but down here, we must\nfeel our way. The magistrates, saving your Worship's presence, look\nupon us with dislike, as if we were superseding them. That will wear\noff, your Worship, and the new system will work wonders.\"\n\n\"Yes, so you all say. But now, be quick. What wonders have you\nwrought, John Smith?\"\n\n\"Well, I was going to tell your Worship when you interrupted me. You\nknow that story of Cripps, the Carrier, and his sister--what's her\nname? Well, some folk believed it, and some bereaved it. I did neither\nof the two, but resolved to get to the bottom of it. Your Worship was\nafraid, you remember--well, then, let us say daunted, sir--or, if you\nwill not have that, we may say, that you trusted in Providence.\"\n\n\"It was not quite that; but still, Mr. Smith----\"\n\n\"Your Worship will excuse me. Things of that sort happen always, and\nthe people are always wrong that do it. I trusted in Providence once\nmyself, but now I trust twice in my own self first and leave\nProvidence to come after me. Ha, ha! I speak my mind. No offence, your\nWorship. Well then, this was what I did. A brave regiment of soldiers\nhaving newly returned from India, was ordered to march from London to\nthe Land's End for change of temperature. They had not been supplied,\nof course, with any change of clothes for climate, and they felt it a\nlittle, but were exhorted not to be too particular. Two companies were\nto be billeted at Abingdon last evening; and having, of course,\nreceived notice of that, I procured authority to use them. They\nshivered so that they wanted work; and there is nothing, your Worship,\nlike discipline.\"\n\n\"Of course, I know that from my early days. Will you tell your story\nspeedily?\"\n\n\"Sir, that is just what I am doing. I brought them without many words\nto the quarry, where ten times the number of our clodhoppers would\nonly have shovelled at one another. Bless my heart! they did work, and\nwith order and arrangement. Being clothed all in cotton, they had no\ntime to lose, unless they meant to get frozen; and it was a fine\nsight, I assure your Worship, to see how they showed their\nshoulder-blades, being skinny from that hot climate, and their\nbrown-freckled arms in the white of the drift, and the Indian steam\ncoming out of them! In about two hours all the ground was clear, and\nthe trees put away, like basket-work; and then we could see what had\nhappened exactly, and even the mark of the pickaxes. Every word of\nthat girl was proved true to a tittle! I never heard finer evidence.\nWe can even see that two men had been at work, and the stroke of their\ntools was different. You may trust me for getting up a case; but I see\nthat you have no patience, Squire. We shovelled away all the fallen\nrock, and mould, and stumps, and furze-roots; and, at last, we came to\nthe poor, poor innocent body, as fresh as the daylight!\"\n\n\"I can hear no more! You have lost no child--if you have, perhaps you\ncould spare it. Tell me nothing--nothing more! But prove that it was\nmy child!\"\n\n\"Lord a' mercy, your Worship! Why, you are only fit to go to bed!\nHere, Mary! Mary! Mother Hookham! Curse the bell--I have broken it!\nYour master is taken very queer! Look alive, woman! Stir your stumps!\nA pot of hot water and a foot-tub! Don't get scared--he will be all\nright. I always carry a fleam with me. I can bleed him as well as any\ndoctor. Hold his head up. Let me feel. Oh, he is not going to die just\nyet! Stop your caterwauling! There, I have relieved his veins. He will\nknow us all in a minute again. He ought to have had a deal more\nspirit. I never could have expected this. I smoothed off everything so\nnicely--just as if it was a lady----\"\n\n\"Did you, indeed! I have heard every word,\" said widow Hookham\nsternly. \"You locked the door, or I would have had my ten nails in you\nlong ago! Poor dear! What is a scum like you? And after all, what have\nyou done, John Smith?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nSO IS MR. SHARP.\n\n\nOn the very next day it was known throughout the parish and the\nneighbourhood that the ancient Squire had broken down at last, under\nthe weight of anxieties. Nobody blamed him much for this, except his\nown sister and Mr. Smith. Mrs. Fermitage said that he ought to have\nshown more faith and resignation; and John Smith declared that all his\nplans were thrown out by this stupidity. What proper inquiry could be\nheld, when the universal desire was to spare the feelings and respect\nthe affliction of a poor old man?\n\nMr. Smith was right. An inquest truly must be held upon the body which\nhad been found by the soldiers. But the Coroner, being a good old\nfriend and admirer of the Oglanders, contrived that the matter should\nbe a mere form, and the verdict an open nullity. Mr. Luke Sharp\nappeared, and in a dignified reserve was ready to represent the\nfamily. He said a few words, in the very best taste, and scarcely\ndared to hint at things which must be painful to everybody left alive\nto think of them. How the crush of tons of rock upon an unprotected\nfemale form had made it impossible to say--and how all the hair (which\nmore than any other human gift survived the sad, sad change), having\nbeen cut off, was there no longer--and how there was really nothing\nexcept a pair of not over new silk stockings, belonging to a lady of\nlofty position in the county, and the widow of an eminent gentleman,\nbut not required, he might hope, to present herself so painfully. Mr.\nSharp could say no more; and the jury felt that he now must come, or,\nfailing him, his son, Kit Sharp, into the \u00c2\u00a3150,000 of \"Port-wine\nFermitage.\"\n\nTherefore they returned the verdict carried in his pocket by them,\n\"Death by misadventure of a young lady, name unknown.\" Their object\nwas to satisfy the Squire and their consciences; and they found it\nwise, as it generally is, not to be too particular. And the Coroner\nwas the last man to make any fuss about anything.\n\n\"Are you satisfied now, Mr. Overshute?\" asked Lawyer Sharp, as Russel\nmet him in the passage of the Quarry Arms, where the inquest had been\ntaken. \"The jury have done their best, at once to meet the facts of\nthe case, and respect the feelings of the family.\"\n\n\"Satisfied! How can I be? Such a hocus-pocus I never knew. It is not\nfor me to interfere, while things are in this wretched state.\nEverybody knows what an inquest is. No doubt you have done your duty,\nand acted according to your instructions. Come in here, where we can\nspeak privately.\"\n\nMr. Sharp did not look quite as if he desired a private interview.\nHowever, he followed the young man with the best grace he could\nmuster.\n\n\"I am going to speak quite calmly, and have no whip now for you to\nsnap,\" said Russel, sitting down, as soon as he had set a chair for\nMr. Sharp; \"but may I ask you why you have done your utmost to prevent\nwhat seemed, to an ordinary mind, the first and most essential thing?\"\n\n\"The identification? Yes, of course. Will you come and satisfy\nyourself? The key of the room is in my pocket.\"\n\n\"I cannot do it. I cannot do it,\" answered the young man, shuddering.\n\"My last recollection must not be----\"\n\n\"Young sir, I respect your feelings. And need I ask you, after that,\nwhether I have done amiss in sparing the feelings of the family? And\nthere is something more important than even that at stake just now.\nYou know the poor Squire's sad condition. The poor old gentleman is\npretty well broken down at last, I fear. What else could we expect of\nhim? And the doctor his sister had brought from London says that his\nlife hangs positively upon a thread of hope. Therefore we are telling\nhim sad stories, or rather, I ought to say, happy stories; and though\nhe is too sharp to swallow them all, they do him good, sir--they do\nhim good.\"\n\n\"I can quite understand it. But how does that bear--I mean you could\nhave misled him surely about the result of this inquest?\"\n\n\"By no means. He would have insisted on seeing a copy of _The Herald_.\nIn fact, if the jury could not have been managed, I had arranged with\nthe editor to print a special copy giving the verdict as we wanted it.\nA pious fraud, of course; and so it is better to dispense with it.\nThis verdict will set him up again upon his poor old legs, I hope. He\nseemed to dread the final blow so, and the bandying to and fro of his\nunfortunate daughter's name. I scarcely see why it should be so; but\nso it is, Mr. Overshute.\"\n\n\"Of course it is. How can you doubt it? How can it be otherwise? You\ncan have no good blood in you--I beg your pardon, I speak rashly; but\nI did not mean to speak rudely. All I mean to say is that you need no\nmore explain yourself. I seem to be always doubting you; and it always\nshows what a fool I am.\"\n\n\"Now, don't say that,\" Mr. Luke Sharp answered, with a fine and genial\nsmile. \"You are acknowledged to be the most rising member of the\nCounty Bench. But still, sir, still there is such a thing as going too\nfar with acuteness, sir. You may not perceive it yet; but when you\ncome to my age, you will own it.\"\n\n\"Truly. But who can be too suspicious, when such things are done as\nthese? I tell you, Sharp, that I would give my head off my shoulders,\nthis very instant, to know who has done this damned villainy!--this\ninfernal--unnatural wrong, to my darling--to my darling!\"\n\n\"Mr. Overshute, how can we tell that any wrong has been done to her?\"\n\n\"No wrong to take her life! No wrong to cut off all her lovely hair,\nand to send it to her father! No wrong to leave us as we are, with\nnothing now to care for! You spoke like a sensible man just now--oh,\ndon't think that I am excitable.\"\n\n\"Well, how can I think otherwise? But do me the justice to remember\nthat I do not for one moment assert what everybody takes for granted.\nIt seems too probable, and it cannot for the present at least be\ndisproved, that here we have the sad finale of the poor young lady.\nBut it must be borne in mind that, on the other hand, the body----\"\n\n\"The thing could be settled in two minutes--Sharp, I have no patience\nwith you!\"\n\n\"So it appears; and, making due allowance, I am not vexed with you.\nYou mean, of course, the interior garments, the nether clothing, and\nso on. There is not a clue afforded there. We have found no name on\nanything. The features and form, as I need not tell you----\"\n\n\"I cannot bear to hear of that. Has any old servant of the family; has\nthe family doctor----\"\n\n\"All those measures were taken, of course. We had the two oldest\nservants. But the one was flurried out of her wits, and the other\nthree-quarters frozen. And you know what a fellow old Splinters is,\nthe crustiest of the crusty. He took it in bitter dudgeon that Sir\nAnthony had been sent for to see the poor old Squire. And all he would\nsay was, 'Yes, yes, yes; you had better send for Sir Anthony. Perhaps\nhe could bring--oh, of course he could bring--my poor little pet to\nlife again!' Then we tried her aunt, Mrs. Fermitage, one of the last\nwho had seen her living. But bless you, my dear sir, a team of horses\nwould not have lugged her into the room. She cried, and shrieked, and\nfainted away.\"\n\n\"'Barbarous creatures!' she said, 'you will have to hold another\ninquest, if you are so unmanly. I could not even see my dear husband,'\nand then she fell into hysterics, and we had to send two miles for\nbrandy. Now, sir, have we anything more to do? Shall we send a litter\nor a coffin for the Squire himself?\"\n\n\"You are inclined to be sarcastic. But you have taken a great deal\nupon yourself. You seem to have ordered everything. Mr. Luke Sharp\neverywhere!\"\n\n\"Will you tell me who else there was to do it? It has not been a very\npleasant task, and certainly not a profitable one. I shall reap the\nusual reward--to be called a busybody by every one. But that is a\ntrifle. Now, if there is anything you can suggest, Mr. Overshute, it\nshall be done at once. Take time to think. I feel a little tired and\nin need of rest. There has been so much to think of. You should have\ncome to help us sooner. But, no doubt, you felt a sort of delicacy\nabout it. The worthy jurymen's feet at last have ceased to rattle in\nthe passage. My horse will not be here just yet. You will not think me\nrude, if I snatch a little rest, while you consider. For three nights\nI have had no sleep. Have I your good permission, sir? Here is the key\nof that room, meanwhile.\"\n\nRussel Overshute was surprised to see Mr. Sharp draw forth a large\nsilk handkerchief, with spots of white upon a yellow ground, and\nspread it carefully over the crown of his long, deep head, and around\nhis temples down to the fine grey eyebrows. Then lifting gaitered\nheels upon the flat wide bar of the iron fender--the weather being as\ncold as ever--in less than a minute Mr. Luke Sharp was asleep beyond\nall contradiction. He slept the sleep of the just, with that gentle\nwhisper of a snore which Aristotle hints at to prove that virtue\nbeing, as she must be, in the mean, doth in the neutral third of life\nmaintain a middle course between loud snore and silent slumber.\n\nIf Mr. Sharp had striven hard to produce a powerful effect, young\nOvershute might have suspected him; but this calm, good sleep and pure\nsense of rest laid him open for all the world to take a larger view of\nhim. No bad man could sleep like that. No narrow-minded man could be\nso wide to nature's noblest power. Only a fine and genial soul could\nsweetly thus resign itself. The soft content of well-earned repose\nspoke volumes in calm silence. Here was a good man (if ever there was\none), at peace with his conscience, the world, and heaven!\n\nOvershute was enabled thus to look at things more loftily;--to judge a\nman as he should be judged, when he challenges no verdict;--to see\nthat there are large points of view, which we lose by worldly wisdom,\nand by little peeps through selfish holes, too one-eyed and\nungenerous. Overshute could not bear the idea of any illiberality. He\nhated suspicion in anybody, unless it were just; as his own should be.\nIn this condition of mind he pondered, while the honest lawyer slept.\nAnd he could not think of anything neglected, or mismanaged much, in\nthe present helpless state of things.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nA SPOTTED DOG.\n\n\nWhen at last the frost broke up, and streams began to run again, and\neverywhere the earth was glad that men should see her face once more;\nand forest-trees, and roadside pollards, and bushes of the common\nhedgerow, straightened their unburdened backs, and stood for spring to\nlook at them; a beautiful young maiden came as far as she could come,\nand sighed; as if the beauty of the land awaking was a grief to her.\n\nThis pretty lady, in the young moss-bud, and slender-necked chalice of\ninnocence, was laden with dews of sorrow, such as nature, in her outer\ndealings with the more material world, defers until autumnal night and\nrusset hours are waiting. Scarcely in full bloom of youth, but ripe\nfor blush or dreaminess, she felt the power of early spring, and the\nbudding hope around her.\n\n\"Am I to be a prisoner always, ever more a prisoner?\" she said, as she\ntouched a willow catkin, the earliest of all, the silver one. She\nstroked the delicate silken tassel, doubtful of its prudence yet; and\nshe looked for leaves, but none there were, and nothing to hold\ncommune.\n\nThe feeble sun seemed well content to have a mere glimpse of the earth\nagain, and spread his glances diffidently, as if he expected shadow.\nNevertheless, there he was at last; and the world received him\ntenderly.\n\n\"It has been such a long, long time. It seems to grow longer, as the\ndays draw out, and nobody comes to talk to me. My place it is to obey,\nof course--but still, but still--there he is again!\"\n\nThe girl drew back; for a fine young man, in a grand new velvet\nshooting-coat, wearing also a long shawl waistcoat and good buck-skin\nbreeches, which (combined with calf-skin gaiters) set off his legs to\nthe uttermost,--in all this picturesque apparel, and swinging a gun\nright gallantly, there he was, and no mistake! He was quietly trying\nthrough the covert, without any beaters, but with a brace of clever\nspaniels, for woodcock, snipe, or rabbit perhaps; the season for game\nbeing over. A tall, well-made, and rather nice young man (so far as a\nbashful girl might guess) he seemed at this third view of him; and of\ncourse it would be an exceedingly rude and pointed thing to run away.\nNeedless, also, and indeed absurd; because she was sure that when last\nthey met, he was frightened much more than she was. It was nothing\nless than a duty now, to find out whether he had recovered himself. If\nhe had done so, it would be as well to frighten him even more this\ntime. And if he had not, it would only be fair to see what could be\ndone for him.\n\nOne of his dogs--a \"cocking spannel,\" as the great Mr. Looker\nwarranted--a good young bitch, with liver-coloured spots, and drop\nears torn by brambles, and eyes full of brownish yellow light, ran up\nto the girl confidentially, and wagged a brief tail, and sniffed a\nlittle, and with sound discretion gazed. Each black nostril was like a\nmark of panting interrogation, and one ear was tucked up like a small\ntunnel, and the eye that belonged to it blinked with acumen.\n\n\"You pretty dear, come and let me pat you,\" the young lady cried,\nlooking down at the dog, as if there were nobody else in the world.\n\"Oh, I am so fond of dogs--what is your name? Come and tell me,\ndarling.\"\n\n\"Her name is 'Grace,'\" said the master, advancing in a bashful but not\nclumsy way. \"The most beautiful name in the world, I think.\"\n\n\"Oh, do you think so, Mr.---- but I beg your pardon, you have not told\nme what your own name is, I think.\"\n\n\"I hope you are quite well,\" he answered, turning his gun away\ncarefully; \"quite well this fine afternoon. How beautiful it is to see\nthe sun, and all the things coming back again so!\"\n\n\"Oh yes! and the lovely willow-trees! I never noticed them so before.\nI had no idea that they did all this.\" She was stroking the flossiness\nas she spoke.\n\n\"Neither had I,\" said the young man, trying to be most agreeable, and\nglancing shyly at the haze of silver in lily fingers glistening; \"but\ndo not you think that they do it because--because they can scarcely\nhelp themselves?\"\n\n\"No! how can you be so stupid? Excuse me--I did not mean that, I am\nsure. But they do it because it is their nature; and they like to do\nit.\"\n\n\"You know them, no doubt; and you understand them, because you are\nlike them.\"\n\nHe was frightened as soon as he had said this; which he thought (while\nhe uttered it) rather good.\n\n\"I am really astonished,\" the fair maid said, with the gleam of a\nsmile in her lively eyes, but her bright lips very steadfast, \"to be\ncompared to a willow-tree. I thought that a willow meant--but never\nmind, I am glad to be like a willow.\"\n\n\"Oh no! oh no! You are not one bit--I am sure you will never be like a\nwillow. What could I have been thinking of?\"\n\n\"No harm whatever, I am sure of that,\" she answered, with so sweet a\nlook, that he stopped from scraping the toe of his boot on a clump of\nmoss; and in his heart was wholly taken up with her--\"I am sure that\nyou meant to be very polite.\"\n\n\"More than that--a great deal more than that--oh, ever so much more\nthan that!\"\n\nShe let him look at her for a moment, because he had something that he\nwanted to express. And she, from pure natural curiosity, would have\nbeen glad to know what it was. And so their eyes dwelt upon one\nanother just long enough for each to be almost ashamed of leaving off;\nand in that short time they seemed to be pleased with one another's\nnature. The youth was the first to look away; because he feared that\nhe might be rude; whereas a maiden cannot be rude. With the speed of a\nglance she knew all that, and she blushed at the colour these things\nwere taking. \"I am sure that I ought to go,\" she said.\n\n\"And so ought I, long and long ago. I am sure I cannot tell why I\nstop. If you were to get into any trouble----\"\n\n\"You are very kind. You need not be anxious. If you do not know why\nyou stop--the sooner you run away at full speed the better.\"\n\n\"Oh, I hope you won't say that,\" he replied, being gifted by nature\nwith powers of courting, which only wanted practice. \"I really think\nthat you scarcely ought to say so unkind a thing as that.\"\n\n\"Very well, then. May I say this, that you have important things to\nattend to, and that it looks--indeed it does--as if it was coming on\nto rain?\"\n\n\"I assure you there is no fear of that--although, if it did, there is\nplenty of shelter. But look at the sun--how it shines in your hair!\nOh, why do you keep your hair so short? It looks as if it ought to be\nten feet long.\"\n\n\"Well, suppose that it was--not quite ten feet, for that would be\nrather hard to manage--but say only half that length, and then for a\nvery good reason was all cut off--but that is altogether another\nthing, and in no way can concern you. I give you a very good day,\nsir.\"\n\n\"No, no! you will give me a very bad day, if you hurry away so\nsuddenly. I am anxious to know a great deal more about you. Why do you\nlive in this lonely place, quite as if you were imprisoned here? And\nwhat makes you look so unhappy sometimes, although your nature is so\nbright? There! what a brute I am! I have made you cry. I ought to\nshoot myself.\"\n\n\"You must not talk of such wicked things. I am not crying; I am very\nhappy--at least, I mean quite happy enough. Good-bye! or I never shall\nbear you again.\"\n\nAs she turned away, without looking at him, he saw that her pure young\nbreast was filled with a grief he must not intrude upon. And at the\nsame moment he caught a glimpse through the trees of some one coming.\nSo he lifted his smart Glengarry cap, and in sad perplexity strode\naway. But over his shoulder he softly said--\"I shall come again--you\nmust let me do that--I am sure that I can help you.\"\n\nThe young lady made no answer; but turned as soon as she thought he\nwas out of sight, and wistfully looked after him.\n\n\"Here comes that Miss Patch, of course,\" she said. \"I wonder whether\nshe has spied him out. Her eyes are always everywhere.\"\n\n\"Oh, my darling child,\" cried Miss Patch, an elderly lady of great\ndignity; \"I had no idea you were gone so far. Come in, I beg of you,\ncome this moment; what has excited you like this?\"\n\n\"Nothing at all. At least, I mean, I am not in the least excited. Oh!\nlook at the beautiful sunset!\"\n\nMiss Patch, with deep gravity, took out her spectacles, placed them on\nher fine Roman nose, and gazed eastward to watch the sunset.\n\n\"Oh dear no! not there,\" cried her charge in a hurry; \"here, it is all\nin this direction.\"\n\n\"I thought that I saw a spotted dog,\" the lady answered, still gazing\nsteadily down the side of the forest by which the youth had made his\nexit; \"a spotted dog, Grace, I am almost sure.\"\n\n\"Yes, I dare say. I believe that there is a dog with some spots in the\nneighbourhood.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nA GRAND SMOCK-FROCK.\n\n\nUpon the Saturday after this, being market-day at Oxford, Zacchary\nCripps was in and out with the places and the people, as busy as the\nbest of them. The number of things that he had to do used to set his\npoor brain buzzing; until he went into the Bar--not the grand one, but\nthe Hostler's Bar, at the Golden Cross--and left dry froth at the\nbottom of a pewter quart measure of find old ale. At this flitting\ntrace of exhaustion he always gazed for a moment as if he longed to\nbehold just such another, and then, with a sigh of self-dedication to\nall the great duties before him, out he pulled his leather bag, and\ncounted fourpence four times over (without any multiplication thereof,\nbut a desire to have less subtraction), and then he generally shook\nhis head, in penitence at his own love of good ale, and the fugitive\nfate of the passion. The last step was to deposit his fourpence firmly\nupon the metal counter, challenging all the bad pence and half-pence\npilloried there as a warning; and then with a glance at the barmaid\nSally, to encourage her still to hope for him, away went Cripps to the\nduties of the day.\n\nThese always took him to the market first, a crowded and very narrow\nquarter then, where he always had a great host of commissions, at very\nsmall figures, to execute. His honesty was so broadly known that it\nwas become quite an onerous gift, as happens in much higher grades of\nlife. Folk, all along both his roads of travel, naturally took great\nadvantage of it; being certain that he would spend their money quite\nas gingerly as his own, and charge them no more than he was compelled\nby honesty towards himself to charge.\n\nFarmers, butchers, poulterers, hucksters, chandlers, and\ngrocers--black, yellow, and green--all knew Zacchary Cripps, and paid\nhim the compliment of asking fifty per cent. above what they meant, or\neven hoped to take. Of this the Carrier was well aware, and upon the\nwhole it pleased him. The triumph each time of rubbing down, by\nfriction of tongue and chafe of spirit, eighteen-pence into a\nshilling, although it might be but a matter of course, never lost any\nof its charms for him. His brisk eyes sparkled as he pulled off his\nhat, and made the most learned annotations there--if learning is (as\ngenerally happens) the knowledge of what nobody else can read.\n\nBut now, before he had filled the great leathern apron of his\ncapacities--which being full, his hat had no room for any further\nentries--a thing came to pass which startled him; so far at least as\nthe road and the world had left him the power of starting. He saw his\nown brother, Leviticus, standing in friendly talk with a rabbit-man; a\nman whose reputation was not at a hopeless distance beyond reproach; a\nman who had been three times in prison--whether he ought or ought not\nto have been, this is a difficult point to debate. His friends\ncontended that he ought not--if so, he of course was wrong to go\nthere. His enemies vowed that he ought to be there--if so, he could\nrightly be nowhere else. The man got the benefit of both opinions, in\na powerfully negative condition of confidence on the part of the human\nbrotherhood. But for all that, there were bigger rogues to be found in\nOxford.\n\nCripps, however, as the head of the family, having seigneurial rights\nby birth--as well as, in his own opinion, force of superior\nintellect--saw, and at once discharged, his duty. No taint of poached\nrabbits must lie, for a moment, on the straightforward path of the\nCrippses. Zacchary, therefore, held up one hand, as a warning to\nTickuss to say no more, until he could get at him--for just at this\nmoment a dead lock arose, through a fight of four women about a rotten\negg--but when that had lapsed into hysterics, the Carrier struggled to\nhis brother's elbow.\n\nLeviticus Cripps was a large, ruddy man, half a head taller than the\nheir of the house, but not so well built for carrying boxes. His frame\nwas at the broadest and thickest of itself at that very important part\nof the human system which has to do with aliment. But inasmuch as all\nparts do that, more or less directly, accuracy would specify (if\nallowable) his stomach. Here he was well developed; but narrowed or\nsloped towards less essential points; whereas the Carrier was at his\ngreatest across and around the shoulders. A keen physiologist would\nrefer this palpable distinction to their respective occupations. The\none fed pigs and fed upon them, and therefore required this local\nenlargement for sympathy, and for assimilation. The other bore the\nburden of good things for the benefit of others; which is anything but\nfattening.\n\nBe that as it will, they differed thus; and they differed still more\nin countenance. Zacchary had a bright open face, with a short nose of\nbrave and comely cock, a mouth large, pleasant, and mild as a cow's, a\nstrong square forehead, and blue eyes of great vivacity, and some\nhumour. He had true Cripps' hair, like a horn-beam hedge in the month\nof January; and a thick curly beard of good hay colour, shaven into\nthree scollops like a clover leaf. His manner of standing, and\nspeaking, and looking was sturdy, and plain, and resolute; and he\nstuck out his elbows, and set his knuckles on his hips, whenever both\nhands were empty.\n\nOn the contrary, Tickuss, his brother, looked at every one, and at all\ntimes, rather as if he were being suspected. Wrongly suspected, of\ncourse, and puzzled to tell at all why it should be so; and as a\ngeneral rule, a little surly at such injustice. The expression of his\nface was heavy, slow-witted, and shyly inquisitive; his hair was\nblack, and his eyes of a muddy brown with small slippery pupils; and\nhe kept his legs in a fidgety state, as if prone to be wanted for\nrunning away. In stature, however, and weight this man was certainly\nabove the average; and he would rather do a good than a bad thing,\nwhenever the motives were equivalent.\n\nBut if his soul could not always walk in spotless raiment, his body at\nleast was clad in the garb of innocence. No man in Oxford market wore\na smock that could be compared with his. For on such great occasions\nLeviticus came in a noble shepherd's smock, long and flowing around\nhim well, a triumph of mind in design and construction, and a marvel\nof hand in fine stitching and plaiting, goffering, crimping, and\nironing. The broad turned-over collar was like a snow-drift tattooed\nby fairies, the sleeves were gathered in as religiously as a bishop's\ngossamer; and the front was four-square with cunning work; a span was\nthe length, and a span the breadth, like the breastplate over the\nephod. As for Tickuss himself, he cared no more than the wool of a pig\nfor such trifles; beyond this, that he liked to have his neighbours\nlooking up to, and the women looking after, him. Even in the new\nunsullied sanctity of this chasuble, he would grasp by the tail an\nIrish pig, if sore occasion befell them both. It was Mrs. Leviticus\nwho adorned him (after a sea of soap-suds and many irons tested\nejectively) with this magnificent vesture, suggested to feminine\ncapacity, perhaps, in the days of the Tabernacle.\n\n\"Leviticus,\" said Zacchary sternly, leading him down a wet red alley,\npeopled only with cooped chicks, and paved with unsaleable giblets;\n\"Leviticus, what be thou doing, this day? Many queer things have I\nseed of thee--but to beat this here--never nothing!\"\n\n\"I dunno what dost mean,\" Tickuss answered unsteadily.\n\n\"Now, I call that a lie,\" said the Carrier firmly but mildly, as if\nwell used thereto; as a dog is to fleas in the summer time.\n\n\"A might be; and yet again a might not,\" Tickuss replied, with keen\nsense of logic, but none of impeached ethics.\n\n\"Do 'ee know, or do 'ee not?\"--the ruthless Carrier pressed him--\"that\nthere hosebird have a been in jail?\"\n\n\"Now, I do believe; let me call to mind\"--said Tickuss, with his\nduller eyes at bay--\"that I did hear summat as come nigh that. But,\nLord bless you, the best of men goes to jail sometimes! Do you call to\nmind old Squire Dempster----\"\n\n\"Naught to do wi' it! naught to do wi' it?\" Zacchary cried, with a\ncrack of his thumb. \"That were an old gentleman's misfortune; the same\nas Saint Paul and Saint Peter did once. But that hosebird I see you\ntalking along of, have been in jail three times--three times I tell\n'ee--and no miracle. And if ever I sees you dealing with him----\" he\nclosed his sentence emphatically, by shaking his fist in the immediate\nneighbourhood of his brother's retiring nose.\n\n\"Well, well! no need to take on so, Zak,\" cried the bigger man at safe\ndistance; \"you might bear in mind that I has my troubles, and no\ncovered cart at the tail of me. And a family, Zak, as wears out more\nboots than a tanyard a week could make good to 'em. But there, I never\nfinds anybody gifted with no consideration. Why, if I was to talk till\nto-morrow night----\"\n\n\"If you was to talk to next Leap-year's day, you could not fetch right\nout of wrong, Tickuss. And you know pretty well what I be. Now, what\nwas you doing of with that black George? Mind, no lies won't go down\nwith me.\"\n\n\"Best way go and get him to tell 'ee,\" the younger brother answered\nsulkily. \"It will do 'ee good like, to get it out of he.\"\n\n\"No harm to try,\" answered Cripps with alacrity; \"no fear for me to be\nseen along of un; only for the likes of you, Tickuss.\"\n\nThe Carrier set off, to stake his higher repute against lowest\ncommunications; but his brother, with no \"heed of smock or of crock,\"\ntook three long strides and stopped him.\n\n\"Hearken me, hearken me, Zak!\" he cried, with a start at a cock that\ncrowed at him, and his face like the wattles of chanticleer--\"Zak, for\nthe sake of the Lord in heaven, and of my seven little ones,--stop a\nbit!\"\n\n\"I bain't in no hurry that I know on,\" replied the Cripps of pure\nconscience; \"you told me to ask of him, and I were a-goin' on the wag\nto do so.\"\n\n\"Come out into the Turl, Zak; come out into the Turl a minute; there\nis nobody there now. They young College-boys be all at their lessons,\nor hunting. There is no place to come near the Turl for a talk, when\nthey noisy College chaps are gone.\"\n\nBy a narrow back lane they got into the Turl, at that time of day\nlittle harassed by any, unless it were the children of the porter of\nLincoln or Exeter. \"Now, what is it thou hast got to say?\" asked\nZacchary. But this was the very thing the younger brother was vainly\nseeking for.\n\n\"Nort, nort, Zak; nort of any 'count,\" he stammered, after casting in\nhis slow imagination for a good, fat, well-seasoned lie.\n\n\"Now spake out the truth, man, whatever it be,\" said the Carrier,\ntrying to encourage him; \"Tickuss, thou art always getting into\nscrapes by manes of crooked dealing. But I'll not turn my back on\nthee, if for once canst spake the truth like a man, brother.\"\n\nLeviticus struggled with his nature, while his little eyes rolled\nslowly, and his plaited breastplate rose and fell. He stole some\nirresolute glances at his brother's clear, straight-forward face; and\nhe might have saved himself by doing what he was half-inclined to do.\nBut circumstances aided nature to defeat his better star. The wife of\nthe porter of Lincoln College had sent forth one of her little girls\nto buy a bunch of turnips. She knew that turnips would be very scarce\nafter so much hard weather; but her stew would be no good without\nthem; and among many other fine emotions, anxiety was now foremost. So\nshe thrust forth her head from the venerable porch, and at the top of\nher voice exclaimed--\"Turmots, turmots, turmots!\"\n\nAt that loud cry, Leviticus Cripps turned pale--for his conscience\nsmote him. \"She meaneth me, she meaneth me, she meaneth my\nturmot-field;\" he whispered, with his long legs bent for departure;\n\"'tis a thousand pound they have offered, Zak. Come away, come away,\ndown Ship Street; there is a pump, and I want some water.\"\n\n\"But tell me what thou wast agoing to say,\" cried his brother, laying\nhold of him.\n\n\"Dash it! I will tell thee the truth, then, Zak. I just went and cut\nup a maisly sow--as fine a bit of pork as you ever clapped eyes on,\nbut for they little beauty spots. And the clerk of the market bought\nsome for his dinner; and he have got a bad cook, a cantankerous woman,\nand now I be in a pretty mess!\"\n\n\"Not a word of all that do I believe,\" said Cripps.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nINSTALLED AT BRASENOSE.\n\n\nMaster Cripps was accustomed mainly to daylight roads and open ways.\nIt was true that he had a good many corners to turn between Beckley\nand Oxford, whether his course were through Elsfield and Marston, or\nthe broader track from Headington. But for all sharp turns he had two\ngreat maxims--keep on the proper side, and go slowly. By virtue of\nthese, he had never been damaged himself, or forced to pay damages;\nand when he was in a pleasant vein, at the Dusty Anvil, or anywhere\nelse, it was useless to tell him that any mischance need happen to a\nman who heeded this--that is to say, if he drove a good horse, and saw\nto the shoeing of the nag himself. Of course there was also the will\nof the Lord. But that was quite sure to go right, if you watched it.\n\nIf he has any good substance in him, a man who spends most of his\ndaylight time in the company of an honest horse, is sure to improve so\nmuch that none of his bad companions know him--supposing that he ever\nhad any. The simplicity and the good will of the horse, his faith in\nmankind, and his earnest desire to earn his oats, and have plenty of\nthem; also the knowledge that his time is short, and his longest worn\nshoes will outlast him; and that when he is dead, quite another must\nbe bought, who will cost twice as much as he did--these things (if any\nsense can be made of them) operate on the human mind, in a measure,\nfor the most part, favourable.\n\nAllowance, therefore, must be made for Master Leviticus Cripps and his\ncharacter, as often as it is borne in mind that he, from society of\ngood horses, was (by mere mischance of birth) fetched down to\ncommunion with low hogs. Not that hogs are in any way low, from a\nproperly elevated gazing-point; and taking, perhaps, the loftiest of\nhuman considerations, they are, as yet, fondly believed to be much\nbetter on a dish than horses.\n\nBut that--as Cripps would plainly put it--is neither here nor there\njust now; and it is ever so much better to let a man make his own\nexcuses, which he can generally do pretty well.\n\n\"Cripps, well met!\" cried Russel Overshute, seizing him by the apron,\nas Zacchary stood at the corner of Ship Street, to shake his head\nafter his brother, who had made off down the Corn Market; \"you are the\nvery man I want to see!\"\n\n\"Lor' a mercy now, be I, your Worship? Well, there are not many\ngentlemen as it does me more good to look at.\"\n\nWithout any flattery he might say that. It was good, after dealing\nwith a crooked man, to set eyes upon young Overshute. In his face\nthere was no possibility of lie, hidden thought, or subterfuge.\nWhatever he meant was there expressed, in quick bold features, and\nfrank bright eyes. His tall straight figure, firm neck, and broad\nshoulders helped to make people respect what he meant; moreover, he\nwalked as if he had always something in view before him. He never\nturned round to look after a pretty girl, as weak young fellows do. He\nadmired a pretty girl very much; but had too much respect for her to\nshow it. He had made his choice, once for all in life; and his choice\nwas sweet Grace Oglander.\n\n\"I made sure of meeting you, Master Cripps; if not in the market, at\nany rate where you put up your fine old horse. I like a man who likes\nhis horse. I want to speak to you quietly, Cripps.\"\n\n\"I am your man, sir. Goo where you plaiseth. Without no beckoning, I\nbe after you.\"\n\n\"There is nothing to make any fuss about, Cripps. And the whole world\nis welcome to what I say, whenever there is no one else concerned. At\npresent, there are other people concerned;--and get out of the way,\nyou jackanapes!\"\n\nIn symmetry with his advanced ideas, he should not have spoken\nthus--but he spake it; and the eavesdropper touched his hat, and made\noff very hastily.\n\nRussel was not at all certain of having quite acted up to his better\nlights, and longed to square up all the wrong with a shilling; but,\nwith higher philosophy, suppressed that foolish yearning. \"Now,\nCripps, just follow me,\" he said.\n\nThe Carrier grumbled to himself a little, because of all his parcels,\nand the change he was to call for somewhere, and a woman who could not\nmake up her mind about a bullock's liver--not to think of more\nimportant things in every other direction. No one thought nothing of\nthe value of his time; every bit the same as if he was a lean old\nhorse turned out to grass! In spite of all that, Master Cripps did his\nbest to keep time with the long legs before him. Thus was he led\nthrough well-known ways to the modest gate of Brasenose, which being\npassed, he went up a staircase near the unpretentious hall of that\nvery good society. \"Why am I here?\" thought Cripps, but, with his\nusual resignation, added, \"I have aseed finer places nor this.\" This,\nin the range of his great experience, doubtless was an established\ntruth. But even his view of the breadth of the world received a little\ntwist of wonder, when over a narrow dark doorway, which Mr. Overshute\npassed in silence, he read--for read he could--these words, \"Rev.\nThomas Hardenow.\" \"May I be danged,\" said Cripps, \"if I ever come\nacross such a queer thing as this here be!\"\n\nHowever, he quelled his emotions and followed the lengthy-striding\nOvershute into a long low room containing uncommonly little furniture.\nThere was no one there, except Overshute, and a scout, who flitted\naway in ripe haste, with an order upon the buttery.\n\n\"Now, Cripps, didst thou ever taste college ale?\" Mr. Overshute asked,\nas he took a chair like the dead bones of Ezekiel. \"Master Carrier,\nhere thou hast the tokens of a new and important movement. In my time,\nchairs were comfortable. But they make them now, only to mortify the\nflesh.\"\n\n\"Did your Worship mean me to sit down?\" asked Cripps, touching the\nforelock which he kept combed for that purpose.\n\n\"Certainly, Cripps. Be not critical; but sit.\"\n\n\"I thank your Worship kindly,\" he answered with little cause for\ngratitude. \"I have a-druv many thousand mile on a seat no worse nor\nthis, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Your reservation is wise, my friend. Your driving-board must have\nbeen velvet to this. But the new lights are not in our Brewery yet. If\nthey get there, they will have the worst of it. Here comes the\ntankard! Well done, old Hooper. Score a gallon to me for my family.\"\n\n\"With pleasure, sir,\" answered Hooper, truly, while he set on the\ntable a tray filled with solid luncheon. \"Ah, I see you remember the\ngood old times, when there was those in this college, sir, that never\nthought twice about keeping down the flesh; and better flesh, sir,\nthey had ever so much than these as are always a-doctoring of it. Ah,\nwhen I comes to recall to my mind what my father said to me, when fust\nhe led me in under King Solomon's nose--'Bob, my boy,' he says to\nme----\"\n\n\"Now, Hooper, I know that his advice was good. The fruit thereof is in\nyourself. You shall tell me all about it the very next time I come to\nsee you.\"\n\n\"Ah, they never cares now to hearken,\" said Hooper to himself, as,\nwith the resignation of an ancient scout, he coughed, and bowed, and\nstroked the cloth, and contemplated Cripps with mild surprise, and\nthen made a quiet exit. As for listening at the door, a good scout\nscorns such benefit. He likes to help himself to something more solid\nthan the words behind him.\n\n\"If I may make so bold,\" said the Carrier, after waiting as long as he\ncould, with Overshute clearly forgetting him; \"what was it your\nWorship was going to tell me? Time is going by, sir, and our horse\nwill miss his feeding.\"\n\n\"Attend to your own, Cripps, attend to your own. I beg your pardon for\nnot helping you. But that you can do for yourself, I dare say. I am\ntrying to think out something. I used to be quick; I am very slow\nnow.\"\n\nCripps made a little face at this, to show that the ways of his\nbetters had good right to be beyond him; and then he stood upon his\nsturdy bowed legs, and turned a quick corner of eye at the door, in\nfear of any fasting influence, and seeing nothing of the kind, with\npleasure laid hold of a large knife and fork.\n\n\"Lay about you, Cripps, my friend; lay about you to your utmost.\" So\nsaid Mr. Overshute, himself refusing everything.\n\n\"Railly now, I dunno, your Worship, how to get on, all a-ating by\nmyself. Some folk can, and some breaks down at it. I must have\nsomebody to ate with me--so be it was only now a babby, or a dog.\"\n\n\"I thank you for the frank comparison, Cripps. Well, help me, if you\nmust--ah, I see you can carve.\"\n\n\"I am better at the raw mate, sir; but I can make shift when roasted.\nButcher Numbers my brother, your Worship--but perhaps you never heered\non him?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I know, Cripps. A highly respectable thriving man he is too.\nAll your family thrive, and everybody speaks so well of them. Why,\nlook at Leviticus! They tell me he has three hundred pigs!\"\n\nLike most men who have the great gift of gaining good will and\npopularity, Russel Overshute loved a bit of gossip about his\nneighbours.\n\n\"Your Worship,\" said Cripps, disappointing him of any new information,\n\"pigs is out of my way altogether. When I was a young man of tender\nyears, counteracted I was for to carry a pig. Three pounds twelve\nshillings and four pence he cost me, in less than three-quarters of a\nmile of road; and squeak, squeak, all the way, as if I was a-killing\nof him, and not he me. Seemeth he smelled some apples somewhere, and\nhe went through a chaney clock, and a violin, and a set of first-born\nbabby-linen for Squire Corser's daughter; grown up now she is, your\nWorship must a met her riding. And that was not the worst of it\nnother----\"\n\n\"Well, Cripps, you must tell me another time. It was terribly hard\nupon you. But, my friend, the gentleman who lives here will be back\nfor his hat, when the clock strikes two. Cap and gown off, when the\nclock strikes two. From two until five he walks fifteen miles,\nwhatever the state of the weather is.\"\n\n\"Lord bless me, your Worship, I could not travel that, with an empty\ncart, and all downhill!\"\n\n\"Never mind, Cripps. Will you try to listen, and offer no\nobservation?\"\n\n\"To say nort,--does your Worship mean? Well, all our family be\nesteemed for that.\"\n\n\"Then prove the justice of that esteem; for I have a long story to\ntell you, Cripps, and no long time to do it in.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nA FLASH OF LIGHT.\n\n\nThe Carrier, with a decisive gesture, ceased from both solid and\nliquid food, and settled his face, and whole body, and members into a\ngrim and yet flexible aspect, as if he were driving a half-broken\nhorse, and must be prepared for any sort of start. And yet with all\nthis he reconciled a duly receptive deference, and a pleasant\nreadiness, as if he were his own Dobbin, just fresh from stable.\n\n\"I need not tell you, Master Cripps,\" said Russel, \"how I have picked\nup the many little things, which have been coming to my knowledge\nlately. And I will not be too positive about any of them; because I\nmade such a mistake in the beginning of this inquiry. All my\nsuspicions at first were set on a man who was purely innocent--a legal\ngentleman of fair repute, to whom I have now made all honourable\namends. In the most candid manner he has forgiven me, and desires no\nbetter than to act in the best faith with us.\"\n\n\"Asking your pardon for interrupting--did the gentleman happen to have\na sharp name?\"\n\n\"Yes, Cripps, he did. But no more of that. I was over sharp myself, no\ndoubt; he is thoroughly blameless, and more than that, his behaviour\nhas been most generous, most unwearying, most---- I never can do\njustice to him.\"\n\n\"Well, your Worship, no--perhaps not. A would take a rare sharp un to\ndo so.\"\n\n\"You hold by the vulgar prejudice--well, I should be the last to blame\nyou. That, however, has nothing to do with what I want to ask you. But\nfirst, I must tell you my reason, Cripps. You know I have no faith\nwhatever in that man John Smith. At first I thought him a tool of\nMr.--never mind who--since I was so wrong. I am now convinced that\nJohn Smith is 'art and part' in the whole affair himself. He has\nthrown dust in our eyes throughout. He has stopped us from taking the\nproper track. Do you remember what discredit he threw on your sister's\nstory?\"\n\n\"He didn't believe a word of un. Had a good mind, I had, to a' knocked\nun down.\"\n\n\"To be sure, Cripps, I wonder that you forbore. Though violent\nmeasures must not be encouraged. And I myself thought that your sister\nmight have made some mistakes through her scare in the dark. Poor\nthing! Her hair can have wanted no bandoline ever since, I should\nfancy. What a brave girl too not to shriek or faint!\"\n\n\"Well, her did goo zummut queer, sir, and lie down in the quarry-pit.\nPerhaps 'twas the wisest thing the poor young wench could do.\"\n\n\"No doubt it was--the very wisest. However, before she lost her wits\nshe noticed, as I understand her to say--or rather she was\nparticularly struck with the harsh cackling voice of the taller man,\nwho also had a pointed hat, she thinks. It was not exactly a cackling\nvoice, nor a clacking voice, nor a guttural voice, but something\ncompounded of all three. Your sister, of course, could not quite so\ndescribe it; but she imitated it; which was better.\"\n\n\"Her hath had great advantages. Her can imitate a'most anything. Her\nwaited for months on a College-chap, the very same in whose house we\nbe sitting now.\"\n\n\"Cripps, that is strange. But to come back again. Your sister, who is\na very nice girl, indeed, and a good member of a good family----\"\n\n\"Ay, your Worship, that her be. Wish a could come across the man as\nwould dare to say the contrairy!\"\n\n\"Now, Cripps, we never shall get on, while you are so horribly\nwarlike. Are you ready to listen to me, or not?\"\n\n\"Every blessed word, your Worship, every blessed word goeth down; unto\nsuch time as you begins to spake of things at home to me.\"\n\n\"Such dangerous topics I will avoid. And now for the man with this\nvillainous voice. You knew, or at any rate now you know, that I never\nwas satisfied with that wretched affair that was called an 'Inquest.'\nInquest a non inquirendo--but I beg your pardon, my good Cripps.\nEnough that the whole was pompous child's play, guided by crafty hands\nbeneath; as happens with most inquests. I only doubted the more,\nfriend Cripps; I only doubted the more, from having a wrong way taken\nto extinguish doubts.\"\n\n\"To be sure, your Worship; a lie on the back of another lie makes un\ngo heavier.\"\n\n\"Well, never mind; only this I did. For a few days perhaps I was\novercome; and the illness of my dear old friend, the Squire, and the\ntrouble of managing so that he should not hear anything to kill him;\nand my own slowness at the back of it all; for I never, as you know,\nam hasty--these things, one and another, kept me from going on\nhorseback anywhere.\"\n\n\"To be sure, your Worship, to be sure. You ought to be always\na-horseback. I've a-seed you many times on the Bench; but you looks a\nvery poor stick there compared to what 'ee be a-horseback.\"\n\n\"Now, Cripps, where is your reverence? You call me 'your Worship,' and\nin the same breath contemn my judicial functions. I must commit you\nfor a week's hard labour at getting in and out of your own cart, if\nyou will not allow me to speak, Cripps. At last I have frightened you,\nhave I? Then let me secure the result in silence. Well, after the\nweather began to change from that tremendous frost and snow, and the\npoor Squire fell into the quiet state that he has been in ever since,\nI found that nothing would do for me, my health not being quite as\nusual----\"\n\n\"Oh, your Worship was wonderfully kind; they told me you was as good\nas any old woman in the room almost!\"\n\n\"Except to take long rides, Cripps, nothing at all would do for me.\nAnd, not to speak of myself too much, I believe that saved me from\nfalling into a weak, and spooney, and godless state. I assure you\nthere were times--however, never mind that, I am all right now,\nand----\"\n\n\"Thank the Lord! you ought to say, sir; but you great Squires upon the\nbench----\"\n\n\"Thank the Lord! I do say, Cripps; I thank Him every day for it. But\nif I may edge in a word, in your unusually eloquent state, I will tell\nyou just what happened to me. I never believed, and never will, that\npoor Miss Oglander is dead. The coroner and the jury believed that\nthey had her remains before them, although for the Squire's sake they\nforbore to identify her in the verdict. Your sister, no doubt,\nbelieved the same; and so did almost every one. I could not go, I\ncould not go--no doubt I was a fool; but I could not face the chance\nof what I might see, after what I had heard of it. Well, I began to\nride about, saying nothing of course to any one. And the more I rode,\nthe more my spirit and faith in good things came back to me. And I\nthink I have been rewarded, Cripps; at last I have been rewarded. It\nis not very much; but still it is like a flash of light to me. I have\nfound out the man with the horrible voice.\"\n\n\"Lord have mercy upon me! your Worship--the man as laid hold of the\npick-axe!\"\n\n\"I have found him, Cripps, I do believe. But rather by pure luck than\nskill.\"\n\n\"There be no such thing as luck, your Worship; if you will excoose me.\nThe Lord in heaven is the master of us!\"\n\n\"Upon my word, it looks almost like it, though I never took that view\nof things. However, this was the way of it. To-day is Saturday. Well,\nit was last Wednesday night, I was coming home from a long, and wet,\nand muddy ride to Maidenhead. That little town always pleases me; and\nI like the landlord and the hostler, and I am sure that my horse is\nfed----\"\n\n\"Your Worship must never think such a thing, without you see it mixed,\nand feel it, and watch him a-munching, until he hath done.\"\n\n\"More than that, I have always fancied, ever since that story was\nabout the bag of potatoes you brought, without knowing any more of\nit--ever since I heard of that, it has seemed to me that more\ninquiries ought to be made at Maidenhead. I need not say why; but I\nknow that the Squire's opinion had been the same, as long as--I mean\nwhile--his health permitted. On Wednesday I went to the foreman of the\nnursery whence the potatoes came. It was raining hard, and he was in a\nshed, with a green baize apron on, seeing to some potting work. I got\nhim away from the other men, and I found him a very sharp fellow\nindeed. He remembered all about those potatoes, especially as Squire\nOglander had ridden from Oxford, in the snowy weather, to ask many\nquestions about them. But the Squire could not put the questions I\ndid. The poor old gentleman could not bear, of course, to expose his\ntrouble. But I threw away all little scruples (as truly I should have\ndone long ago), and I told the good foreman every word, so far as we\nknow it yet, at least. He was shocked beyond expression--people take\nthings in such different ways--not at the poor Squire's loss and\nanguish, but that anybody should have dared to meddle with his own pet\n'oakleafs,' and, above all, his new pet seal.\n\n\"'I sealed them myself,' he said, 'sealed them myself, sir, with the\nnew coat of arms that we paid for that month, because of the tricks of\nthe trade, sir! Has anybody dared to imitate----' 'No, Mr. Foreman,' I\nsaid, 'they simply cut away your seal altogether, and tied it again,\nwithout any seal.' 'Oh, then,' he replied, 'that quite alters the\ncase. If they had only meddled with our new arms, while the money was\nhot that we paid for them, what a case we might have had! But to knock\nthem off--no action lies.'\n\n\"Cripps, it took me a very long time to warm him up to the matter\nagain, after that great disappointment. He was burning for some great\nsuit at law against some rival nursery, which always pays the upstart\none; but I led him round, and by patient words and simple truth\nbrought him back to reason. The packing of the bag he remembered well,\nand the pouring of a lot of buck-wheat husks around and among the\npotato sets, to keep them from bruising, and to keep out frost, which\nseemed even then to be in the air. And he sent his best man to the\nOxford coach, the first down coach from London, which passed by their\ngate about ten o'clock, and would be in Oxford about two, with the\nweather and the roads as usual. In that case, the bag could scarcely\nhave been at the Black Horse more than half an hour before you came\nand laid hold of it; and being put into the bar, as the Squire's\nparcels always are, it was very unlikely to be tampered with.\"\n\n\"Lord a' mercy! your Worship, it was witchcraft then! The same as I\nsaid all along; it were witches' craft, and nothing else.\"\n\n\"Stop, Cripps, don't you be in such a hurry. But wait till you hear\nwhat I have next to tell. But oh, here comes my friend Hardenow, as\npunctual as the clock strikes two! Well, old fellow, how are you\ngetting on?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nA STORMY NIGHT.\n\n\nThe Rev. Thomas Hardenow, fellow and tutor of Brasenose, strode into\nhis own room at full speed, and stopped abruptly at sight of the\nCarrier. \"Of all men, most I have avoided thee,\" was in his mind; but\nhe spoke it not, though being a strongly outspoken man. Not that he\never had done any wrong to make him be shy of the Cripps race; but\nthat he felt in his heart a desire for commune, which must be\ndangerous. He knew that in him lurked a foolish tendency towards\nEsther; and (which was worse) he knew that she had done her best to\novercome a still more foolish turn towards him.\n\nCripps, however (who would have fed the doves of Venus on black peas),\nlooked upon any little bygone \"coorting\" as a social and congenial\ntopic, enabling a quiet man to get on (if he only had a good memory)\nwith almost any woman. Like a sensible man, he had always acquitted\nHardenow of any blame in the matter, knowing that young girls' fancies\nmay be caught without any angling. \"If her chose to be a fool, how\nwere he to blame for it?\" And the Carrier never forgot the stages of\nsocial distinction. \"Servant, sir,\" he therefore said, with his usual\nsalaam; \"hope I see you well, sir.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Zacchary,\" said Mr. Hardenow, taking the Carrier's horny\npalm (which always smelled of straps and buckles), and trying to\nsqueeze it, with a passive result, \"I am pretty well, Zacchary, thank\nyou.\"\n\n\"Then you don't look it, sir, that you doesn't. We heerd you was\ngetting on wonderful well. But the proof of the puddin' ain't in you,\nsir.\"\n\n\"That's right, Cripps,\" cried Overshute; \"give it to him, Cripps! Why,\nhe starves himself! Ever since he took his first and second, and got\nhis fellowship and took orders, he hasn't known what a good dinner is.\nHe keeps all the fasts in the calendar, and the vigils of the\nfestivals, and he ought to have an appetite for the feasts; but he\noverstays his time, and can't keep anything on his stomach!\"\n\n\"Now, Russel, as usual!\" Hardenow answered, with a true and pleasant\nsmile; \"what a fine fellow you would be, if you only had moderation!\nBut I see that you want to talk to Cripps; and I have several men\nwaiting in the quad. Where is my beaver? Oh! here, to be sure! Will\nyou come with us? No, of course you can't. Will you dine in hall with\nme?\"\n\n\"Of course, I won't. But come you and dine with me on Sunday--the only\nday you dare eat a bit--and my mother will do her best to strengthen\nyou, build you up, establish you, for a fortnight of macaroni. Will\nyou come?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, to-morrow--to be sure--I have many things I want to say to\nyou. Good-bye for the present; good-bye, Master Cripps.\"\n\n\"There goes one of the finest fellows, of all the fine fellows yet\nruined by rubbish!\" With these words Russel Overshute ran to the\nwindow and looked out. A dozen or more of young men were waiting, the\nbest undergraduates of the college, for Mr. Hardenow to lead them for\nfifteen miles, without a word.\n\n\"Well, every man to his liking,\" said Russel; \"but that would be about\nthe last of mine. Now, Cripps, most patient of carriers, are you ready\nfor me to go on or not?\"\n\n\"I hath a been thinking about my horse. How greedy o' me to be ating\nlike this\"--for the thought of so much fasting had made him set to\nagain, while he got the chance--\"drinking likewise of college\nale--better I have tasted, but not often--and all this time, as you\nmight say, old Dobbin easing of his dainty foot, with no more nor a\nwisp of hay to drag through his water--if he hath any.\"\n\n\"An excruciating picture, Cripps, drawn by too vivid a conscience.\nDobbin is as happy as he can be, with twenty-five horses to talk to\nhim. At this very moment I behold him munching choicest of white oats\nand chaff.\"\n\n\"Your Worship can see through a stone-wall, they say; but they only\nkeeps black oats at the Cross just now, along of a contract the\nlandlord have made--and a blind sort of bargain, to my thinking----\"\n\n\"Never mind that--let him have black oats then, or Irish oats, or no\noats at all. But do you wish to hear my story out, or will you leave\nit till next Saturday?\"\n\n\"Sir, you might a' seen as I was waiting, until such time as you plaze\nto go on wi' un.\"\n\n\"Very well, Cripps, that satisfies the most exacting historian. I will\ngo on where I left off, if that point can be established. Well, I left\nthe foreman of the nursery telling me about the man he sent with the\nbag of potatoes to the Oxford coach. He told me he was one of his\nsharpest hands, who had been off work for a week or two then, and had\nonly returned that morning. 'Joe Smith' was his name; and when they\ncould get him to work, he would do as much work as any two other men\non the place. He might be trusted with anything, if he only undertook\nit; but the worst of him was that he never could be got to stick long\nto anything. Here to-day and gone to-morrow had always been his\ncharacter; and they thought that he must be of gipsy race, and perhaps\nhad a wandering family.\n\n\"This made me a little curious about the man; and I asked to see him.\nBut the foreman said that for some days now he had not been near the\nnursery, and they thought that he was on the Oxford road, in the\nneighbourhood of Nettlebed; and another thing--if I did see him, I\ncould not make out more than half he said, for the man had such a\ndefect in his voice, that only those who were used to him could be\ncertain of his meaning. Suddenly I thought of your sister's tale, and\nI said to the foreman, 'Does he speak like this?' imitating as well as\nI could your sister's imitation of him. 'You know the man, sir,' the\nforeman answered; 'you have got him so exactly, that you must have\nheard him many times.' I told him no more, but asked him to describe\nJoe Smith's appearance. He answered that he was a tall, dark man,\nloosely built, but powerful, with a stoop in his neck, and a long\nsharp nose; and he generally wore a brown pointed hat.\n\n\"Cripps, you may well suppose that my suspicions were strong by this\ntime. Here was your sister's description--so far as the poor girl\ncould see in the dusk and the fright--confirmed to the very letter;\nand here was the clear opportunity offered for slipping the wreath of\nhair into the bag.\"\n\n\"Your Worship, now, your Worship! you be a bit too sharp! If that\nthere man were at Headington quarry at nightfall of the Tuesday, how\ncould he possible a' been to Maidenhead next morning? No, no, your\nWorship are too sharp.\"\n\n\"Too thick, you mean, Cripps; and not sharp enough. But listen to me\nfor a moment. Those long-legged gipsies think very little of going\nthirty miles in a night; though they never travel by day so. And then\nthere is the up mail-coach. Of course he would not pay his fare, but\nhe might hang on beneath the guard's bugle, with or without his\nknowledge, and slip away at the changing-houses. Of that objection I\nthink nothing. It serves to my mind as a confirmation.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" said Cripps discreetly; \"who be I for to argify?\"\n\n\"No, Cripps, of course not. But still I wish to allow you to think of\neverything. You may not be right; but still I like you to speak when\nyou think of anything. That is what I have always said, and contended\nfor continually--let every man speak--when sensible.\"\n\n\"Your Worship hath hit the mark again. The old Squire saith, 'let no\nman speak,' as St. Paul sayeth of the women. But your Worship saith\n'let all men speak, all women likewise, as hath a tongue'--and then\nyou stoppeth us both the more, by restirrecting all on us, women or\nmen, whichever a may happen, till such time as all turns up sensible.\nNow, there never could ever be such a time!\"\n\n\"Carrier, you are satirical. Keep from the Dusty Anvil, Cripps. Marry\na wife, and you will have a surfeit of argument at home. But still you\nhave been very good on the whole, and you never will get home\nto-night. At any rate, I was so convinced, in spite of all smaller\ndifficulties, that I bound the foreman to let me know, by a man on\nhorseback, at any expense, the moment he saw Joe Smith again. And his\nparting words to me were these--'Well, sir, don't you think harm of\nJoe without sure proof against him. He is a random chap, I know; but I\nnever saw a better man to earn his wages.'\n\n\"Well, I went back to the inn at once, and rode leisurely to Henley.\nIt was raining hard, and the river in flood with all the melted snow\nand so on, when I crossed that pretty bridge. I had been trying in\nvain to think what was the best thing I could do; not liking to go\nhome, and leave my new discovery so vague. But being soaked and chilly\nnow, I resolved to have a glass of something hot, for fear of taking a\nviolent cold, and losing perhaps a week by it. So I went into the\nentrance of that good inn by the waterside, and called for some brandy\nand water hot. The landlord was good enough to come out; and knowing\nme from old boating days, he got into a talk with me. I had helped him\nat the sessions about a house of his at Dorchester; and nothing could\nexceed his good will. Remembering how the gipsies hang about the boats\nand the waterside, I asked him (quite as a random shot) whether any of\nthem happened to be in the neighbourhood just now. He thought perhaps\nthat I was timid about my dark ride homeward, and he told me all he\nknew of them. There was one lot, as usual, in the open ground about\nNuneham, and another large camp near Chalgrove, and another, quite a\nsmall pitch that, on the edge of the firs above Nettlebed.\n\n\"This last was the lot for me; and I pressed him so about them, that\nhe looked at me with a peculiar grin. 'What do you mean by that?' I\nasked. 'Now, Squire Overshute, as if you did not know!' he answered.\n'Doth your Worship happen to remember Cinnaminta's name?'\n\n\"Cripps, I assure you I was astonished. Of course you knew\nCinnaminta--well, I don't want to be interrupted. No one could say any\nharm of her; and a lovelier girl was never seen. The landlord had\nheard some bygone gossip about Cinnaminta and myself. I did admire\nher. I am not ashamed to say that I greatly admired her. And so did\nevery young fellow here, who had got a bit of pluck in him. I will not\ngo into that question; but you know what Cinnaminta was.\"\n\nCripps nodded, with a thick mixture of feelings. His poetical self had\nbeen smitten more with Cinnaminta than he cared to tell; and his\npractical self was getting into a terrible hubbub about his horse. \"To\nbe sure, your Worship,\" was all he said.\n\n\"Very well, now you understand me. To hear of Cinnaminta being in that\ncamp at Nettlebed made me so determined that I laid hold of the\nlandlord by the collar without thinking. He begged me not to ride off\nwith him, or his business would be ruined; and feeling that he weighed\nabout eighteen stone, I left him on his threshold.\n\n\"I could not bear to ask him now another word of anything. Knowing\nlooks, and winks, and reeking jokes so irritate me, when I know that a\nwoman is pure and good. You remember how we all lost Cinnaminta. Three\nor four score of undergraduates, reckless of parental will, had\noffered her matrimony; and three or four newly-elected fellows were\nasking whether they would vacate, if they happened to jump the\nbroomstick.\"\n\n\"All that were too fine to last,\" muttered Cripps, most sensibly. \"But\nher ought to a' had a sound man on the road--a man with a horse well\nseasoned, and a substantial cart--her ought.\"\n\n\"Oh, then, Cripps, you were smitten too! A nice connection for light\nparcels! Well, never mind. The whole thing is over. We all are sadder\nand wiser men; but we like to know who the chief sufferer is--what man\nhas won the beauty. And with this in my mind, I rode up the hill, and\nresolved to go through with my seeking.\n\n\"When I got to the end of 'the fair-mile,' the night came down in\nearnest. You know my young horse 'Cantelupe,' freckled like a melon.\nHe knows me as well as my old dog; and a child can ride him. But in\nthe dark he gets often nervous, and jumps across the road, if he sees\nwhat he does not consider sociable. So that one must watch his ears,\nwhatever the weather may be. And now the weather was as bad as man or\nhorse could be out in.\n\n\"All day, there had been spits of rain, with sudden puffs of wind, and\nstreaks of green upon the sky, and racing clouds with ragged edges.\nYou remember the weather of course; Wednesday is one of your Oxford\ndays. Well, I hope you were home before it began to pelt as it did\nthat evening. For myself I did not care one fig. I would rather be\ndrenched than slowly sodden. But I did care for my horse; because he\nhad whistled a little in the afternoon, and his throat is slightly\ndelicate. And the whirr of the wind in the hedge, and the way it\nstruck the naked branches back, like the clashing of clubs against the\nsky, were enough to make even a steady old horse uneasy at the things\nbefore him. Moreover, the road began to flash with that peculiar light\nwhich comes upward or downward--who can tell?--in reckless tumults of\nthe air and earth. The road was running like a river; come here and go\nthere, like glass it shone with the furious blows of the wind striking\na pale gleam out of it. I stooped upon Cantelupe's neck, or the wind\nwould have dashed me back over his crupper.\n\n\"Suddenly in this swirl and roar, my horse stood steadfast. He spread\nhis fore legs and stooped his head to throw his balance forward; and\nhis mane (which had been lashing my beard) swished down in a waterfall\nof hair. I was startled as much as he was, and in the strange light\nstared about. 'You have better eyes than I have,' I said, 'or else you\nare a fool, Canty.'\n\n\"I thought that he was a fool, until I followed the turn of his head,\nand there I saw a white thing in the ditch. Something white or rather\nof a whity-brown colour was in the trough, with something dark leaning\nover it. 'Who are you there?' I shouted, and the wind blew my voice\nback between my teeth.\n\n\"'Nort to you, master. Nort to you. Go on, and look to your own\nconsarns.'\n\n\"This rough reply was in a harsh high cackle, rather than a human\nvoice; but it came through the roar of the tempest clearly, as no\ncommon voice could come. For a moment, I had a great mind to do\nexactly as I was ordered. But curiosity, and perhaps some pity for the\nfellow, stopped me. 'I will not leave you, my friend,' I said, 'until\nI am sure that I can do no good.' The man was in such trouble, that he\nmade no answer which I could hear, so I jumped from my horse, who\nwould come no nearer; and holding the bridle, I went up to see.\n\n\"In as sheltered a spot as could be found, but still in a dripping and\nweltering place, lay, or rather rolled and kicked, a poor child in a\nmost violent fit. 'Don't 'ee now, my little Tom; don't 'ee, that's a\ndeary, don't!' The man kept coaxing, and moaning, and trying to smooth\ndown little legs and arms. 'Let it have its way,' I said; 'only keep\nthe head well up; and try to put something between the teeth.' Without\nany answer, he did as I bade; and what he put betwixt the teeth must\nhave been his own great thumb. Of course he mistook me for a doctor.\nNone but a doctor was likely to be out riding on so rough a night.\"\n\n\"Ah, how I do pity they poor chaps!\" cried Carrier Cripps, who really\ncould not wait one minute longer. \"Many a naight I mates 'em a\nstarting for ten or twenty maile of it, just when I be in the smell o'\nmy supper, and nort but nightcap arterward. Leastways, I mean, arter\npipe and hot summat. Your Worship'll 'scoose me a-breakin' in. But\nthere's half my arrands to do yet, and the sun gone flat on the\nRadcliffe! The Lord knows if I shall get home to-night. But if I\ndoos--might I make so bold--your Worship be coming to see poor Squire?\nYour Worship is not like some worships be--and I has got a rare drop\nof fine old stuff! Your Worship is not the man to take me crooked. I\nmeans no liberty, mind you.\"\n\n\"Of that I am certain,\" Mr. Overshute answered. \"Cripps, your\nsuggestion just hits the mark. I particularly want to see your sister.\nThat was my object in seeking you. And I did not like to see her,\nuntil you should have had time to prepare her. I have several things\nto see to here, and then I will ride to Beckley. Mrs. Hookham will\ngive me a bit of dinner, when I have seen my dear friend the Squire.\nAt night, I will come down, and smoke a pipe, and finish my story with\nyou, as soon as I am sure you have had your supper.\"\n\n\"Never you pay no heed at all,\" said Master Cripps, with solemnity,\n\"to no thought of my zupper, sir. That be entire what you worships\ncall a zecondary consideration. However, I will have un, if so be I\ncan. And you mustn't goo for to think, sir, that goo I would now, if\nstay I could. I goes with that there story, the same as the jog of a\ncart to the trot of the nag. My wits kapes on agoin' up and down. But\nbusiness is a piece of the body, sir. But no slape for me; nor no\nchurch to-morrow; wi'out I hears the last of that there tale!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nCRIPPS DRAWS THE CORK.\n\n\nAny kind good-natured person, loving bright simplicity, would have\nthought it a little treat to look round the Carrier's dwelling-room,\nupon that Saturday evening, when he expected Mr. Overshute. Not that\nCripps himself was over-tidy, or too particular. He was so kindly\nfamiliar now with hay, and straw, and bits of string, and chaff, and\nchips, and promiscuous parcels, that on the whole he preferred a\nlitter to any exertions of broom or brush. But Esther, who ruled the\nhouse at home, was the essence of quick neatness, and scorned all\ncomfort, unless it looked--as well as was--right comfortable. And now,\nexpecting so grand a guest, she had tucked up her sleeves, and stirred\nher pretty arms to no small purpose.\n\nThe room was still a kitchen, and she had made no attempt to disguise\nthat much. But what can look better than a kitchen, clean, and bright,\nand well supplied with the cheery tools of appetite. It was a\ngood-sized room, and very picturesque with snugness. Little corners,\nin and out, gave play for light and shadow; the fireplace retired far\nenough to well express itself; and the dresser had brass-handled\ndrawers, that seemed quietly nursing table-cloths. Well, above these,\nupon lofty hooks, the chronicles of the present generation might be\nread on cups. Zacchary headed the line, of course; and then--as\nGenesis is ignored by grander generations--Exodus, and Leviticus (the\nfount of much fine movement), and Numbers, and a great many more,\nshowed that the Carrier's father and mother had gladly baptized every\none.\n\nIn front of the fire sat the Carrier, with nearly all of his best\nclothes on, and gazing at a warming-pan. He had been forbidden to eat\nhis supper, for fear of making a smell of it; and he had a great mind\nto go to bed, and have some hot coals under him. For nearly five miles\nof uphill work and laying his shoulder against the spokes, he had been\npromising himself a rare good supper, and a pipe to follow; and now\nwhere were they? In the far background. He had no idea of rebellion;\nstill that saucepan on the simmer made the most provoking movements.\nTherefore he put up his feet upon a stump of oak (which had for\ngenerations cooled down pots), and he turned with a shake of his head\ntoward the fire, and sniffed the sniff of Tantalus, and muttered--\"Ah,\nwell! the Lord knoweth best!\" and thought to himself that if ever\nagain he invited the quality to his house, he would wait till he had\nhis own quantity first.\n\nEsther was quite in a flutter; although she was ready to deny it\nstoutly, and to blush a bright red in doing so. To her, of course,\nJustice Overshute was simply a great man, who must have the chair of\nstate, and the talk of restraint, and a clean dry hearth, and the\ncurtsy, and the best white apron of deference. To her it could make\nnot one jot of difference, that Mr. Overshute happened to be the most\nintimate friend of some other gentleman, who never came near her,\nexcept in dreams. Tush, she had the very greatest mind, when the house\nwas clean and tidy, to go and spend the evening with her dear friend\nMealy at the Anvil. But Zacchary would not hear of this; and how could\nshe go against Zacchary?\n\nSo she brought the grand chair, the arm-chair of yew-tree--the tree\nthat used to shade the graves of unrecorded Crippses--a chair of\ndeepest red complexion, countenanced with a cushion. The cushion was\nbut a little pad in the dark capacious hollow; suggesting to an\ninnocent mind, that a lean man had left his hat there, and a fat man\nhad sat down on it. But the mind of every Cripps yet known was\nstrictly reverential; and this was the curule chair, and even the\nOlympian throne of Crippses.\n\nRussel Overshute knocked at the door, in his usual quick and impetuous\nway. In the main he was a gentleman; and he would have knocked at a\nnobleman's door exactly as he did at the Carrier's. But all radical\ntheories, fine as they are, detract from gentle practice; and the\ntoo-large-minded man, while young, takes a flying leap over small\nniceties. He does not remember that poor men need more deference than\nrich men, because they are not used to it. To put it more\nplainly--Overshute knocked hard, and meant no harm by it.\n\n\"Come in, sir, and kindly welcome!\" Cripps began, as he showed him in;\n\"plaize to take this chair, your Worship. Never mind your boots; Lor'\nbless us! the mud of three counties cometh here.\"\n\n\"Then it goes away again very quickly! Miss Cripps, how are you? May I\nshake hands?\"\n\nEsther, who had been shrinking into the shade of the clock and the\ndresser, came forward with a brave bright blush, and offered her hand,\nas a lady might. Russel Overshute took it kindly, and bowed to her\ncurtsy, and smiled at her. In an honest manly way, he admired pretty\nEsther.\n\n\"Master Cripps, you are too bad; and your sister in the conspiracy\ntoo! I do believe that your mind is set to make me as tipsy as a king\nto-night!\"\n\n\"They little things!\" said the Carrier, pointing to the old oak table,\nwhere a bottle of grand old whiskey shone with the reflected gleam of\nlemons, and glasses danced in the firelight--\"they little things, sir,\nwas never set for so good a gentleman afore, nor a one to do such\nhonour to un. But they might be worse, sir, they might be worse, to\nspake their simple due of un. And how is poor Squire to-night, your\nWorship?\"\n\n\"Well, he is about as usual. Nothing seems to move him much. He sits\nin his old chair, and listens for a step that never comes. But his\npatience is wonderful. It ought to be a lesson to us; and I hope it\nhas been one to me. He trusts in the Lord, Cripps, as strongly as\never. I fear I should have given up that long ago, if I were laid on\nmy back as he is.\"\n\n\"Young folk,\" answered Cripps, as he drew the cork--\"meaning no\ndisrespect to you, sir--when they encounters trouble, is like a young\nhorse a-coming to the foot of a hill for the fust time wi' a heavy\nload. He feeleth the collar beginning to press, and he tosseth his\nhead, and that maketh un worse. He beginneth to get into fret and\nfume, and he shaketh his legs with anger, and he turneth his head and\nfoameth a bit, and champeth, to ax the maning o' it. And then you can\njudge what the stuff of him is. If he be bad stuff, he throweth them\nback, and tilteth up his loins, and spraddleth. But if he hath good\nstuff, he throweth out his chest, and putteth the fire into his eyes,\nand closeth his nostrils, and gathereth his legs, and straineth his\nmuscles like a bowstring. But be he as good as a wool, he longeth to\nsee over the top of that there hill, afore he be half-way up it.\"\n\n\"Well, Cripps, I have done that, I confess. I have longed to see over\nthe top of the hill; and Heaven only knows where that top is! But as\nsure as we sit here and drink this glass of punch to your sister's\nhealth, and to yours, good Carrier, so surely shall our dear old\nfriend receive the reward of his faith and courage; whether in this\nworld or the next!\"\n\n\"Thank 'ee kindly, sir. Etty, is that the best sort of curtsy they\nteaches now? Now, don't blush, child, but make a betterer. But as to\nwhat your Worship was a-saying of, I virtually hopes a may come to\npass in this world we be living in. Otherwise, maybe, us never may\nknow on it, the kingdom of Heaven being such a size.\"\n\n\"Cripps, I believe it will be in this world. And I hope that I am on\nthe straight road now towards making out some part of it. You have\ntold your sister all I told you at Brasenose this morning according to\nmy directions? Very well, then; I may begin again at the point where I\nleft off with you. Where did I break it? I almost forget.\"\n\n\"With the man's big thumb in the mouth of the cheeld, while you was\na-looking at him, sir; and the wind and the rain blowing furious.\"\n\n\"Ah yes, I remember; and so they were. I thought that the crest of the\nhedge would fall over, and bury the whole of us out of the way. And\nwhen the poor boy had kicked out his convulsions, and fallen into a\nsenseless sleep, the rough man turned on me savagely, as if I could\nhave prevented it. 'A pretty doctor you be!' he exclaimed. But I took\nthe upper hand of him. 'Stand back there!' I said; and I lifted the\nchild (expecting him to strike me all the while), and placed the poor\nlittle fellow on my horse, and managed to get up into my saddle before\nthe wind blew him off again. 'Now lead the way to your home,' I said.\nAnd muttering something, he set off.\n\n\"He strode along at such a pace that, having to manage both child and\nhorse, it was all I could do to keep up with him. But I kept him in\nsight till he came to a common, and there he struck sharply away to\nthe right. By the light of the wind and the rain, and a star that\ntwinkled where the storm was lifting, I followed him, perhaps for half\na mile, through a narrow track, in and out furze and bramble. At last\nhe turned suddenly round a corner, and a shadow fell behind him--his\nown shadow thrown by a gusty gleam of fire. Cantelupe--that is my\nhorse, Miss Esther--has not learned to stand fire yet, and he shied at\nthe light, and set off through the furze, as if with the hounds in\nfull cry before him. We were very lucky not to break our necks, going\nheadlong in the dark among rabbit-holes. I thought that I must have\ndropped the child, as the best thing to be done for him; but the\nshaking revived him, and he clung to me.\n\n\"I got my horse under command at last; but we must have gone half a\nmile anywhere, and to find the way back seemed a hopeless task. But\nthe quick-witted people (who knew what had happened, and what was\nlikely to come of it) saved me miles of roundabout by a very simple\nexpedient. They hoisted from time to time a torch of dry furze blazing\nupon a pole; and though the light flared and went out on the wind, by\nthe quick repetition they guided me. In the cold and the wet, it\nrejoiced my heart to think of a good fire somewhere.\"\n\n\"Etty, stir the fire up,\" the hospitable Cripps interrupted. \"His\nWorship hath shivers, to think of it. When a man, or, beg pardon, a\ngentleman, feeleth the small of his back go creeping, he needeth good\nfire to come up his legs, and a hot summat to go down him. Etty, be\nquick with the water now.\"\n\n\"Cripps, Cripps, Carrier Cripps! do you want to have me spilled on the\nroad to-night? I am trying to tell things in proper order. But how can\nI do it, if you go on so? However, as I was beginning to say,\nCantelupe, and the child, and I, fetched back to the place at last,\nwhere the flash of light had started us. And we saw, not a flash, but\na glow this time, a steadfast body of cheerful fire, with pots and\ncauldrons over it. So well had the spot been chosen, in the lee of\nground and growth, that the ash of the fire lay round the embers, as\nstill as the beard of an oyster; while thicket and tree but a few\nyards off were threshing in the wind and wailing. Behind this fire,\nand under a rick-cloth sloping from a sandstone crest, women and\nchildren, and one or two men, sat as happy and snug as could be: dry,\nand warm, and ready for supper, and pleased with the wind and the rain\noutside, which improved their comfort and appetite. And now and then\nthe children seemed to be pulling at an important woman, to hurry her,\nperhaps, in her cookery.\n\n\"But while I was watching them, keeping my horse on the verge of light\nand shadow, a woman, quite different from the rest, came out of the\ndarkness after me. Heedless of weather, and reckless of self, she had\nbeen seeking for me, or rather for my little burden. Her hair was\nsteeped with the drenching rain, for she wore no hat or bonnet; and\nher dark clothes hung on the lines of her figure, as women hate to let\nthem do. Her eyes and face I could not see because of the way the\nlight fell; but I seemed to know her none the less.\n\n\"While I gazed in doubt, my little fellow slipped like an eel from my\nclasp and the saddle; and almost before I could tell where he\nwas--there he was in the arms of his mother! Wonders of love now began\nto go on; and it struck me that I was one too many in a scene of that\nsort; and I turned my good horse, to be off and away. But the woman\ncalled out, and a man laid hold of my bridle, and took his hat off,\nwhen, with the usual impulse of a stopped Briton, I was going to\nstrike at him. I saw that it was my good friend of the ditch, and I\ncame to parley with him.\n\n\"What with his scarcity of manners, and of polished language, and\nworst of all his want of palate, I found it hard, with so much wind\nblowing out here all around us, to understand his meaning. This was\nrude of me to the last degree, for the queerly-voiced man was doing no\nless than inviting me, with all his heart, to an uncommonly good\ndinner!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nCINNAMINTA.\n\n\n\"Now that,\" said Cripps, \"is what I call the proper way of doing\nthings. Arter all, they hathens knows a dale more than we credit 'em.\"\n\n\"Well, Miss Esther,\" asked Russel, turning to his other listener,\n\"what do you think about it now?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" she replied, with her round cheeks coloured by the excitement\nof his tale, and shining in the firelight, \"I do not know what the\nmanners may be among the gentry in such things. But if it had been one\nof us, we never could have supped with him.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" answered Overshute; \"so I felt. Starving as I was, I\ncould not break bread with a man like that, until he should have\ncleared himself. He did not seem to be conscious of any dark mistrust\non my part; and that was natural enough, as he did not even know me.\nBut when I said that I must ride home as fast as I could, he asked me\nfirst to come and have a look at the poor little child. This I could\nnot well refuse; so I gave my horse to a boy to hold, and followed him\ninto the warm dry place, and into his own corner. As I passed, and the\npeople made way for me, I saw that they were genuine gipsies, not mere\nEnglish vagabonds. There was no mistaking the clearly-cut features,\nand the olive complexions, and the dark eyes, lashed both above and\nbelow. My gruff companion raised a screen, and showed me into his\nsnuggery.\n\n\"It was dimly lit by a queer old lamp of red earthenware, and of Roman\nshape. Couches of heather, and a few low stools, and some vessels were\nthe only furniture; but the place was beautifully clean, and fragrant\nwith dry fern and herbs. In the furthest corner lay little Tom, with a\nwoman bending over him. At the sound of our entry she turned to meet\nus, and I saw Cinnaminta. Her hair, and eyes, and graceful carriage\nwere as grand as ever, and her forehead as clear and noble; but her\nface had lost the bright puzzle of youth, and the flush of damask\nbeauty. In a word, that rich mysterious look, which used to thrill so\nmany hearts, was changed into the glance of fear, and the restless\ngaze of anxiety.\n\n\"She knew me at once, and asked, with a very poor attempt at\ngaiety--'Are you come to have your fortune told, sir?'\n\n\"Before I could answer, her husband spoke some words in her own\nlanguage, and the 'Princess,' as we used to call her, took my hand in\nboth of hers, and kissed it, and poured forth her thanks. She had been\nso engrossed with her poor sick child that she had not known me on\nhorseback. Having done so little to deserve her thanks, I was quite\nsurprised at such gratitude; and it made me fear that she must be now\nunaccustomed to kind treatment. I asked how her grandmother was, who\nused to sit up so proudly at Cowley, as well as her sister, the little\nthing that used to run in and out so. As I spoke of them, she shook\nher head and gazed at some long distance, to tell me that they were no\nmore. I could not remember the rest of her people, except her Uncle\nKershoe, as fine a fellow as ever stole a horse. When I spoke of him,\nshe laughed as if he were going on as well as ever; and I hoped that\nit might be no son of his to whom I had trusted Cantelupe. But of\ncourse I knew that gipsy honour would hold him sacred for the time,\neven if he were Bay Middleton. Then I asked her about her own\nchildren, and again she shook her head and said--'Three, all three in\none are now; and that is the one you saved.' With that, while her\nhusband left the tent, Cinnaminta led me to look at the poor little\nfellow in his deep warm sleep. A beautiful little boy it was; a real\nPrincess might yearn in vain for such a lovely offspring, if only the\nstamp of health had been on him. But the glow of airy health and\nbreezy vigour was not on him; neither will it ever be, so far as one\nmay judge by skin. Clear, transparent, pearly skin, all whose colour\nseems to come from under, instead of over it; the more the wind or the\nsun strikes on it, the more its colour evaporates. I fear that poor\nCinnaminta's child will go the way of the younger ones.\"\n\n\"Poor dear! poor dear!\" exclaimed the Carrier, rubbing his nose in a\nsad slow way. \"I can guess what her would be to them. If her loseth\nthat little un, mind--well then, you will see if her dothn't go arter\nun.\"\n\n\"I believe that she will,\" replied Overshute; \"I never saw any one so\nwrapped up in another being as she is. As for Joe Smith, her husband,\nand the way she treats him, I couldn't--no, I never could put up with\nit, even if it were---- But, Miss Esther, why do you look with such a\ncurious smile at me? Of such matters what can you know? However, there\ngoes your clock again! Cripps, I shall never get home to-night; and my\nmother will think I was poaching. Because I will not send the poachers\nto prison, she believes that I must be a poacher myself!\"\n\n\"Now, verily, your Worship, that bates all I have ever heerd of! How\ncould a Justice go a-poaching, howsomever he tried his best?\"\n\n\"Cripps, he might. I believe he might, if he really did his best for\nit. However, let that question pass; although it is highly\ninteresting. I will try, at my leisure, to solve it. But how can I\nthink of such little things in the middle of great sad ones? It really\nmade me feel as if I never should laugh again almost, when I saw this\nfine unselfish woman controlling herself, and commanding herself, in\nthe depth of her misery about her child. And when I thought how she\nmight have got on, if she only had liked education, and that; and to\nmarry a fellow of Oriel; I assure you, Miss Esther, I began to feel\nhow women throw away their chances. Of course, I could not hint at\nthings disloyal--or what shall I call them? Unconjugal, perhaps, is\nwhat I mean; unuxorial, or what it may be. But although I am slow at\nseeing things; because I used to think myself too quick, and have made\nfalse charges through it; I really could not help feeling sure that\npoor Cinnaminta had made an awkward tally with her husband. However,\nthat was no concern of mine. She had made her own choice, and must\nstick to it. But to think of it made me uncomfortable, and I could not\nspeak then of what I wished to speak of, but took short leave and rode\naway. First, however, I got permission to come over again on the\nFriday--yesterday, I mean; and now I will tell you exactly what\nhappened then.\"\n\n\"Your Worship do tell a tale,\" said Cripps; \"that wonderful, that us\nbe almost there! They women takes a man, whether or no he wool; and\nwhen they gets tired of un, they puts all the fault on he, they do!\nThere was a woman as did the washing, over to Squire Pemberton's;\nnothing to look at--unless you hadn't seen done-up hair for a\ntwelve-month, the same as happens to the sailors; and in her\ngo-roundings of no account, for to catch the notice of a man much. But\nthat very woman, I'm danged if her didn't----\"\n\n\"Zacchary, hush!\" said Esther; and the Carrier muttered, \"Of course,\nof course! No chance of fair play wi' un! Well, go on, your Worship.\"\n\n\"I have very little more to tell you, as yet,\" Overshute answered,\nwith a smile at both. \"You have listened with wonderful patience to\nme; and I am surprised at remembering half of what happened to me in a\nhurry so. I shall make more allowance for witnesses now, when they get\nconfused and hesitate. But, as I was going to say, I rode over to\nNettlebed Common, or whatever it is called, in good time yesterday, so\nas to have a long quiet talk with Cinnaminta; knowing that if she\nwould not tell me the truth, she would tell no falsehood. As I rode\nalong in that fine spring sun, my mind was unusually clear and bright.\nI saw to a nicety what questions I ought to put, and how to put them;\nand nothing of all the ins and outs of this matter could escape me.\nWhen the sun threw my shadow, as sharp as a die, I could not help\nlaughing to the open road and the clear long breadth of prospect, at\nthe narrow stupid thoughts we had been thinking throughout the winter.\nIn a word, I was sure, as I am of my life, of finding sweet Grace\nOglander, and restoring her father to his fine old health, and\nspreading great happiness everywhere; and thus I rode up to the\ngipsy-camp--and there was not a shadow or a trace of it!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nA DELICATE SUBJECT.\n\n\nThe log had burned down, and the fire was low, when Russel thus ended\nhis story. Cripps was indignant, because he had made up his mind for\n\"summat of a zettlement;\" and Esther was full of young womanly\nthoughts about Cinnaminta and her poor child. But even before they\ncould consult one another, or cross-examine, a loud, sharp knock at\nthe door was heard, and in ran Mary Hookham.\n\n\"Oh, if you please, sir--oh, if you please, sir!\" she exclaimed with\nboth hands up, and making the most of her shawl fringe, \"such a thing\nhave turned up!--I never! Them stockings! Oh, them silk stockings,\nsir! Your Worship--oh, them silk stockings, sir!\"\n\n\"My dear,\" said Cripps in a fatherly tone, and with less contemporary\nfeeling than Mary might wish to inspire him with--\"my dear good maid,\nyou be that upset, that to spake, without sloping the spout of the\nkettle, might lade to a'most anything. Etty, you ain't had a drap of\nnort--and all the better for 'ee. Give over your glass, girl. Now,\nMiss Mary, the laste little drap, and then you spakes; and then you\nhas another drap. 'Scoose me, your Worship, to make so bold; but a\nyoung man can't see them things in the right light.\"\n\n\"Oh, Master Cripps, now!\" cried Mary Hookham, \"what but a young man be\nyou yourself? And none of they young men can point their tongues, to\ncompare with you, to my mind. But I beg your pardon, sir, Mr.\nRussel--your name come so familiar to me, through our dear young lady.\nI forgot what I was a-doing, your Worship, to be sitting down in your\npresence so!\"\n\n\"Mary, if you get up I shall get up also, and go away. We are both\nenjoying the hospitality of our good friend, Master Cripps. Now, Mary,\nby no means hurry yourself; but tell me at your leisure why you came,\nand what your news is.\"\n\n\"Silk stockings, forsooth!\" cried Master Cripps, being vexed at this\nbreak of the evening. \"Why, my grandmother had a whole pair of they! I\nbelave I could find 'em now, I do! Silk stockings, to break up one's\ncomfort for! Not but what I be glad to see you. Mary, my dear, I drink\nyour good health, touching spoons in lack of lips.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Cripps, you are so funny! And you do make me fell things in\nsuch a way! Bless me, if I haven't dropped my comb! Oh, I am so\nshocked to trouble you! Natteral hair are so provoking, compared to\nwhat most people wears now-a-days. But about what I come for--oh, your\nWorship, stockings is not what I ought to speak of, except in the ear\nof females.\"\n\n\"Stockings are a very good subject, Mary; particularly if they are\nsilk ones.\"\n\n\"Lor, sir! Now, I never thought of that! To be sure, that makes all\nthe difference! Well then, your Worship must know all, and Master\nCripps, and Miss Esther, too. It seemeth that Mrs. Fermitage, master's\nown sister, you know, sir, have never been comfortable in her mind\nabout her behaviour when the 'quest was held. Things lay on her nerves\nat that time so, that off and on she hardly seemed to know where she\nwas, or how dooty lay to her. Not that she is at all selfish, if you\nplease to understand me--no more selfish than I myself be, or any one\nof us here present. But ladies requires allowance; and it makes me\nhave a pain to think of it. You could not expect her--could you\nnow?--to go through it, as if she was a man; or rather, I should say,\na gentleman.\"\n\n\"Of course we could not,\" answered Overshute; and the Carrier began to\nthink, why not.\n\n\"However, she did go through it,\" said Mary, \"as well as the very best\nman could have done. She covered her feelings, as you might say, with\na pint pot, or with less than that.\"\n\n\"With a wine-glass of brandy, I did hear tell,\" said Master Cripps\ninquiringly.\n\n\"No, no; that was a shocking story. It makes me ashamed of the place\nas we live in whenever I heer such scandalies!\"\n\n\"Miss Mary, my dear, I beg your pardon. Lord knows I only say what I\nheers! Take a little drop, Miss, and go on.\"\n\n\"It makes one afeared to touch a drop of most hinnocent mixture as\never was,\" continued poor Mary, after one good gulp; \"and at the same\ntime most respectable waters--when people as never had opportunity of\nforming no judgment about them--people as only can spit out their\ntongues at them as have some good taste in theirn, when such folk--for\npeople they are not--dareth to go forth to say---- But I see you are\nlaughing at me, your Worship; and perhaps I well deserve it, sir. It\nis no place of mine to convarse of such subjects--me who never deals\nwith 'em! But, one way or other, that good lady (as, barring her way\nwith her servants, she is, which our good master have many a time, up\nand given it to her about), well, this very day, sir, in she come when\nI was a-doing of my morning doos--every bit as partiklar, sir, as if I\nhad a mistress over me; and she say to me, 'Mary Hookham!' and I says,\n'Yes, ma'am; at your service.' And she ask me without any more to\ndo--the just words I cannot now call to mind--for to send at once,\nwithout troubling poor master, to fetch they stockings as was put by,\nto the period of the coroner's 'quest. Poor master have never been\nallowed to see them, no more has none of us, sir; for fear of setting\non foot some allowance of vulgar curiosity. And all of us is not above\nit, I know; but that is a natteral error in places where few has had\nmuch eddication.\"\n\n\"I don't hold much with that there eddication,\" cried the Carrier\nrather gloomily. \"A may suit some people, but not many. They puts it\non 'em all alike wi'out trial of constitootion. Some goes better for\nit; but most volk worse.\"\n\n\"Well, you know best, Mr. Cripps, of course. Up and down the road as\nyou be, every door give you a hinstance. His Worship is all for\neddication; and no one need swaller it, unless they likes. But pretty\nwell schooled as I have been, sir, I looks down on no one. And now,\nwhen master's sister made that sudden call upon me, I assure you, sir,\nand Master Cripps, and Miss Esther in the corner there, the very first\nthing as I longed for was more knowledge of the ways of the kingdom.\nMore sense, I mean, of where the powers puts the things that have been\ncalled up and laid at the feet of the law-courts. They stockings was\nmore lost to me, than gone to be washed by the gipsies.\n\n\"It never would have done for me to say that much to Mrs. Fermitage.\nShe would have been out in a wrath at once, for she is not sweet like\nmaster; so I gave her all 'yes' instead of 'why' or 'how,' as we do to\nquick-tempered gentlefolk. And then I ran away to ask my mother, and\nshe no more than laughed at me. 'You silly child,' says mother, quite\nas if there had never been a fool till now; 'when the law getteth hold\nof a thing, there be only two places for to find it in.' 'Two places,\nmother! What two places?' said I, without construction. 'Why, the\nright-hand or the left-hand pocket of a lawyer's breeches,' mother\nanswered, just as if she had served all her time with a tailor. Now,\ndon't laugh, Mr. Overshute; it is true, every word as I tell you.\"\n\n\"Ay, that her be,\" cried Cripps, with a smack of one hand on the\nother. \"Your mother is a wonderful woman for truth and sense, my\ndeary.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" replied Mary, with a broad knowing smile, as much as to\nsay, \"You had better try her\" \"at her time of life her ought to be, if\never they seek to attain it. So I acted according to mother's\ndirections, letting her always speak foremost. And between us we got\nMaster Kale to go, on his legs, all the way to Oxford with the hope of\na lift back with you, Master Cripps; but, late as you was, he were\nlater. He carried a letter from Mrs. Fermitage, couched in the\nthirtieth person, to Mrs. Luke Sharp of Cross-Duck House, the very one\nas sent that good book back. Master's sister have felt below contempt\ntowards her since that time, and in dignity could do no otherwise. And\nnow she put it short and sharp, as no less could be expected--and word\nfor word can I say of it--\n\n\"'Mrs. Fermitage has the honour of presenting her compliments to Mrs.\nSharp, and begs to express her surprise at the strange retention by\nMrs. S. of a pair of valuable silk stockings, which are the property\nof Mrs. F. If they are not in use, it is begged that they may be\nreturned by the bearer.--Postscript: Mrs. F. takes this opportunity of\nacknowledging the return of a book, which, being filled only with the\nword of God, was perhaps of less practical value to Mrs. S. than silk\nstockings appear to be.'\n\n\"'That will fetch them,' said my mother; 'if they be in the house,\nthat will fetch them, ma'am. No lady could stand against them\ninawindows.' And, sure enough, back they come by Mr. Kale, about an\nhour after you left our house, sir. It seems that Mr. Luke Sharp was\ngone to dine with the Corporation, or likely they never would have\ncome at all. And they never would have come at all, because Mrs. Sharp\ncould not have found them, if it hadn't been that Master Sharp, the\nboy they think such wonders of, just happened to come in from\nshooting, where the whole of his time he spends. He found his mother\nin the hystrikes of a heart too full for tears, as she expressed it\nbootifully to both cook and housemaid; and they pointed to the letter,\nand he read it; and he were that put out, that Master Kale, seeing the\ntwo big barrels of his gun, were touched in his conscience, and ran\naway and got under the mangle. What happened then, he were afeard to\nbe sure of; but the cook and the housemaid brought him out, and they\nlocked him in, to eat a bit, which he did with trembles of\nthankfulness. And, almost afore he had licked his knife as clean as he\nlike to leave it, that wicked young man he kicked open the door, and\nflung a parcel at him.\n\n\"'Tell your d----d missus,' he says--your Worship, I hopes no offence to\nthe statues--'tell her,' he says, 'that her rubbish is there! And add,\nwithout no compliments, that a lady of her birth should a' known\nbetter than to insult another lady so!'\"\n\n\"Well done, Kit Sharp!\" exclaimed Overshute. \"I rather admire him for\nthat. Not that he ought to have sworn so, of course. But I like a\nyoung fellow to get in a rage when he thinks that his mother is\ntrampled on.\"\n\n\"Then you might a' been satisfied with him, sir. In a rage he were,\nand no mistake! So much so that our Mr. Kale made off by the quickest\ndoor out of the premises. But the cook, she ran after him out to the\nsteps, when there was the corners between them, and she begged him not\nto give a bad account, but to put a Christian turn to it. And she told\npoor Tummuss that she had a manner of doing veal fit to surprise him;\nand if he could drop in on Sunday week, he might go home the wiser.\nThe Lord knows how she hit so quick upon his bad propensities; for he\ndo pay attention to his victuals, whatever his other feelings be.\nHowever, away he come at last; and I doubt if he goeth in a hurry\nagain.\n\n\"Of course he knowed better than give the broken handles of his\nmessage. It is only the boys and the girls does that, for the pleasure\nof vexing their betters. Master Kale sent his parcel in by me,\ntogether with Mrs. Sharp's compliments; leaving the truth in the\nkitchen to strengthen, and follow to the parlour, as the cat comes in.\nAnd so master's sister, she put out her hand all covered with rings,\nand no shaking; and I makes my best entry just like this, excusing\nyour presence, Mr. Russel, sir; and she nod to me pleasantly, and take\nit. 'Mary, you may go,' she said; and for sure, I am not one of those\nwho linger.\n\n\"There happened, however, to be a new candle full of thieves and\nguttering; and being opposite a looking-glass made it more\nreproachful. So back I turned by the corner of a screen, for to right\nit without disturbance. I had no more idea, bless you, Master Cripps,\nof cooriosity, than might have happened to yourself, sir! But I pulled\na pair of scissors out of my pocket, no snuffers being handy; and then\nI heer'd a most sad groan.\n\n\"To my heart it went, like a clap of thunder, having almost expected\nit, which made it worse; and back I ran to do my dooty, if afforded\nrightly. And sure enough there was poor Mrs. Fermitage afell back well\ninto the long-backed chair, with her legs out straight, and her hands\nto her forehead, and a pair of grey stockings laid naked on her lap!\n'Is it they things, ma'am? Is it they?' I asked, and she put up her\nchin to acknowledge it. By the way they were lying upon her lap, I was\nsure that she was vexed with them. 'Oh, Mary,' she cried out; 'oh,\nMary Hookham, I am both as foolish and a wicked woman, if ever in the\nworld there was one!'\n\n\"So deeply was I shocked by this, master's own sister, and a mint of\nmoney, going the wrong way to kingdom come--that I give her both ends\nof the smelling-bottle, open, and running on her velvet gown, as\ninnocent as possible. 'Oh, you wicked, wicked girl!' she says, coming\nround, before I could stop; 'do you know what it cost a yard, you\nminx?'\n\n\"This gave me good hopes of her, being so natteral. Twice the price\ncomes always into ladies' minds, when damage is; if anybody can be\nmade to pay. But it did not become me to speak one word, as you see,\nMr. Russel, and Master Cripps. And there was my reward at once.\n\n\"'I must have a magistrate,' she cries; 'a independent justice of the\npeace. Not my poor brother--too much of him already. Where is that boy\nOvershute?' she says, saving, of course, your Worship's presence. 'I\nheered he were gone to that low carrier's. Mary, run and fetch him!'\"\n\n\"My brother to be called a low carrier!\" young Esther exclaimed, with\nher hand on her heart. \"What carrier is to Compare with him?\"\n\n\"Never you mind, cheel,\" answered Cripps, with a smile that shone like\na warming-pan; \"the womens may say what they pleases on me, so long as\nI does my dooty by 'em. Squaze the lemon for his Worship, afore un\ngoeth.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nQUITE ANOTHER PAIR OF SOCKS!\n\n\nMr. Overshute had always been on good terms with Mrs. Fermitage, his\n\"advanced ideas\" marching well with her political sentiments, so far\nas she had any. And upon a still more tender subject, peace and\ngood-will throve between them. The lady desired no better suitor for\nher niece than Russel Overshute, and had laboured both by word and\ndeed to afford him fair opportunity. Moreover, it was one of her great\ndelights, when time went heavily with her, to foster a quiet little\nfight between young Russel and his mother. Those two, though filled\nwith the deepest affection and admiration for each other, could\nscarcely sit half an hour together without a warm argument rising. The\nlate Mr. Overshute had been for years a knight of the shire, and for\nsome few months a member of the Tory Government; and this conferred on\nhis widow, of course, authority paramount throughout the county upon\nevery political question. How great, then, was her indignation, to\nfind subversive and radically erroneous principles coming up, where\nnone but the best seed had been sown. Three generations ago, there had\nbeen a very hasty Overshute; but he had been meted with his own\nmeasure, and his balance struck upon the block. This had a wholesome\ninfluence on the family, while they remembered it; and child after\nchild had been brought up with the most correct opinions. But here was\nthe young head of the house, with a stiff neck, such as used to be\nadjusted in a nick upon Tower-hill. Mrs. Overshute therefore spent\nmuch of her time in lamenting, and the rest in arguing.\n\nFor none of these things Mrs. Fermitage cared. With her, the idea of\nchange was free. She had long rebelled against her brother's dictation\nof the Constitution, and believed they were rogues, all the lot of\nthem, as her dear good husband used to say. \"Port-wine Fermitage\" went\ntoo far when he laid down this law for the females. Without a particle\nof ill-meaning, he did a great deal of mischief.\n\nNow Mrs. Fermitage sat well up, in a chair that had been newly\nstuffed. She was very uncomfortable; and it made her cross, because\nshe was a good-sized woman. She kept on turning, but all for the\nworse; and her mind was uneasy at her brother's house. The room was\ngone dark, and the lights going down, while Miss Mary Hookham was\nrevelling in the mansion of the Carrier. Nobody cared to hurry for the\nsake of anybody else, of course; and Mrs. Fermitage could not see what\nthe good of all her money was.\n\nThe lady was all the more vexed with others, because her own\nconscience was vexed with her; and as Overshute came with his quick,\nfirm step, she spoke to him rather sharply.\n\n\"Well, Russel Overshute, there was a time when you would not have left\nme to sit in this sad way by myself all the evening. But that was when\nI had pretty faces near me. I must not expect such attentions now!\"\n\n\"My dear Mrs. Fermitage, I had no idea that you were even in the\nhouse. The good Squire sent me a very nice dinner; but you did not\ngrace it with your presence.\"\n\n\"And for a very good reason, Russel. I have on my mind an anxiety\nwhich precludes all idea of eating.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mrs. Fermitage, never say that! You have been brought up too\ndelicately.\"\n\n\"Russel, I believe that is too true. The world has conspired to spoil\nme. I seem to be quite in a sad position, entirely for the sake of\nothers. Now, look at me, Russel; and just tell me what you think.\"\n\nOvershute always obeyed a lady in little things of this kind. He\nlooked at Mrs. Fermitage, which really was a pleasant thing to do; and\nhe thought to himself that he never had seen a lady of her time of\nlife more comfortable, nicely fat, and thoroughly well dressed and\nfed.\n\n\"My opinion is,\" he proceeded with a very pretty salaam and smile,\n\"that you never looked better in your life, ma'am! And that is a very\ngreat deal to say!\"\n\n\"Well, Russel, well,\" she answered, rising in good old fashion, and\ncurtsying; \"your opinions have not spoiled your manners, whatever your\ndear mother may say. You always were a very upright boy; and you\nalways say exactly what you think. This makes your opinion so\nvaluable. I shall shake off ten years of my life. But I really was\nquite low-spirited, and down at heart, when you came in. I fear that I\nhave not quite acted for the best, entirely as I meant to do so. You\nremember that horrible state of things, nearly two months ago, and my\ngreat distress?\"\n\n\"At the time of that wretched inquest? Yes; you were timid, as well\nyou might be.\"\n\n\"It was not only that. But the weather was so cold that I scarcely\nknew what I was doing at all. Hard weather is to me as it is to a\nplant, a delicate fern, or something. My circulation no longer is\ncorrect; even if it goes on at all. I scarcely can answer for what I\nam doing when they put me into cold rooms and bitter draughts. I feel\nthat the organs of my face are red, and that every one is looking at\nme. And then such a tingle begins to dawn through the whole of my\nconstitution, that to judge me by ordinary rules is barbarous and\niniquitous.\"\n\n\"To be sure, to be sure!\" answered Overshute, laying one finger on his\nexpressive nose, and wondering what was next to come.\n\n\"Yes, and that is the manner in which justice is now administered. The\ncanal was frozen, and the people of the inn grudged a quarter of a\nhundredweight of coal. The people at the yards had put it up so, that\nit would have been wrong to encourage them. I had ordered my own\nstumps to be burned up, and the flower-baskets, and so on. Anything\nrather than order coals, till the swindling dealers came down again.\nAnd the Coroner sided with the price of coals, because he had three\ntop-coats on. The jury, however, with their teeth all chattering,\nwanted only to be done and go. They were only too glad, when any\nwitness failed to answer when called upon; and having all made up\ntheir minds outside, they were shivering to declare them. I speak now,\nfrom what I heard afterwards.\"\n\n\"You speak the bare truth, Mrs. Fermitage. You have the best\nauthority. The foreman is your chimney-sweep.\"\n\n\"Yes; and that made him feel the cold the more. But you should see him\non a Sunday, Russel. He is so respectable, and his nails so white. I\nwill not listen to a word against him; and he valued my custom, on his\noath he did. 'What verdict does Missus desire?' he asked. And he made\nall the rest go accordingly. Nobody knows what they might have sworn,\nwithout a clever man to guide them.\"\n\n\"Of course. What can you expect? But still, you have something new to\ntell me?\"\n\n\"Well, Russel, new or old, here it is. And you must bear in mind how I\nfelt, and what everybody was saying. In the first place, then, you\nmust remember that there was a great deal said about a pair of my silk\nstockings. Now, I shrank particularly from having an intimate matter\nof that sort made the subject of public gossip. It was neither\nbecoming, nor ladylike, to drag little questions of my wardrobe into\nthe eye of the nation so. Already it was too much to know that a pair\nof such articles had been found bearing my initials. Most decidedly I\nrefused, and I am sure any lady would do the same, to go into a hard\ncold witness-box, and under the eyes of some scores of males proclaim\nmy complicity with such things. If I had seen it my duty, I would have\nendeavoured to conquer my feelings; but of course I took it all for\ngranted that everything was too clear already. And my dear brother! I\nthought of him; and thought of every one, except myself. Could I do\nmore, Russel Overshute?\"\n\n\"Indeed, my dear madam, I do not see how. You would have come forward,\nif necessary. But you did not see any necessity.\"\n\n\"Much more than that. There was much more than that. There was my duty\nto my brother, stronger than even to my niece. He is getting elderly;\nand for me to be printed as proving anything against his daughter,\nwould surely have been too much for him. He looked to me so for\nconsolation, and some one to say kind words to him, that to find me in\nevidence against him might have been his death-blow. No consideration\nfor myself or my own feelings had the weight of a rose-leaf with me.\nIn the breach I would have stood, if I had followed my own wishes. But\nmy duty was to curb myself. You are following me, Russel, carefully?\"\n\n\"Word for word, as you say it, madam; so far as my poor wits allow.\"\n\n\"Very well, then. I have made it quite clear. That is the beauty of\nhaving to explain to clever people.\"\n\n\"I thank you for the compliment,\" replied Overshute, with a puzzled\nlook; \"but I have not earned it; for I cannot see that you have told\nme anything that I did not know some weeks ago. It may be my\nstupidity, of course; but I thought that something had occurred quite\nlately.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, to be sure! It was only to-day! I meant to have told you that\nfirst of all. I was grossly insulted. But I am so forgiving that I had\nforgotten it--quite forgotten it, until you happened to speak of it. A\npeculiarly insolent proceeding on the part of poor Mrs. Sharp, it\nappears--or, perhaps, some one for her; for everybody says that she\nreally now has no mind of her own. She did not write me one single\nline, although I had written politely to her; and she sent me a\nmessage--I am sure of it--too bad to be repeated. No one would tell me\nwhat it was; which aggravates it to the last degree. I assure you I\nhave not been so upset for years; or, at any rate, not since poor\nGrace was lost. And about that, unless I am much mistaken, that very\nlow, selfish, and plotting person, knows a great deal more than we\nhave ever dreamed. It would not surprise me in the least, especially\nafter what happened today, to find Mrs. Sharp at the bottom of all of\nit. At any rate, she has aroused my suspicion by her contemptible\ninsolence. And I am not a person to drop a thing.\"\n\n\"Why, what has she done?\" asked Overshute once more; while in spite of\nimpatience he could scarcely help smiling at poor Mrs. Fermitage's\npetty wrath and frequent self-contradiction.\n\n\"What she did was this. She sent me back, not even packed in nice\nwhite paper, not even sprinkled with eau de Cologne, not even\nwashed--what do you think of that?--but rolled up anyhow in brown\npaper, the same as a drayman would use for his taps--oh, Russel, would\nyou ever believe it!\"\n\n\"Certainly it seems very unpolite. But what was it she sent back to\nyou?\"\n\n\"Not even the article I expected! Not even that ingredient of costume\nwhich I had lent poor Gracie, very nice and pretty ones--but an old\ngrey pair of silken-hose, disgraceful even to look at! It is true that\nthey bear my initials; but I had discarded them long ago.\"\n\n\"What a strange thing!\" cried Overshute, flushed with quick\nexcitement. \"How reckless we were at the inquest! We had made up our\nminds without evidence, on the mere faith of coincidence. And you--you\nhave never taken the trouble to look into this point until now--and\nnow perhaps quite by accident! We were told that you had recognised\nthe stockings; and it turns out that you never even saw them. It is\nstrange and almost wicked negligence.\"\n\n\"I have told you my motives. I can say no more,\" exclaimed Mrs.\nFermitage, with her fine fresh colour heightened by shame or anger.\n\"Of course, I felt sure--who could fail to do so?--that the stockings\nfound with my name on them must be the pair I had lent my niece. It\nseemed most absurd that I should have to see them. It was more than my\nnerves could bear; and the Coroner was not so unmanly as to force me.\nPray, did you go and see everything, sir?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Fermitage, I am the very last person who has any right to\nreproach you. I failed in my duty, far more than you in yours. In a\nman, of course, it was a thousand times worse. There is no excuse for\nme. I yielded to a poor unmanly weakness. I wished to keep my memory\nof the poor dear, as I had seen her last. I should have considered\nthat the poor frail body is not our true identity----\"\n\n\"Quite so, of course. And therefore, what was the use of your going to\nsee it? No, no, you behaved very well, Russel Overshute; and so did I,\nif it comes to that. Nobody can be quite blameless, of course; and we\nare told in the Bible not to hope for it. If we all do our duty\naccording to our inner lights, and so on, the Apostle can say no great\nharm of us, in his rudest moment to the ladies.\"\n\n\"Let us settle that we both have done our best,\" said Russel very\nsadly; knowing how far from the truth it was, but seeing the folly of\narguing.\n\n\"And now will you tell me, what made you send for those silk\ningredients of costume so suddenly; and then show them to me?\"\n\n\"With pleasure, dear Russel. You understand me, when no one else has\nany sympathy. I sent for them, or at least for what I fully expected\nto be the ones, because an impertinent young woman, foolishly trusted\nwith very good keys, gave me notice to go, last evening. Of course she\nwill fly before I have a chance of finding how much she has\nstolen--they all take very good care to do that; and knowing what the\nspirit of the age is--dress, dress, fal-lals, ribbons, heels in the\nair, and so on--I made up my mind to have a turn out to-day, and see\nhow much they had left me. No man can imagine, and scarcely any woman,\nall the vexations I had to go through. Five pair and a half of\nsilk-hose were missing, as well as a thousand more important things;\nand they all backed up one another. They stood me out to my face that\nI never had more than eight pair of the Christchurch-Tom\nstockings--excuse me for being so coarse, my dear; whereas I had got\nthe receipt for twelve pair from the man that sold them with the big\nTom bells on immediately above the instep. I happened to remember that\nI had lent my darling Gracie pair No. 12, numbered, as all of them\nwere, downright. And so to confound those false-tongued hussies, I\ncame over here in search of them. Finding that they were not here--for\nthe lawyers, of course, steal everything--I was not going to be beaten\nso. I sent as polite a letter as, after her shameful rudeness, any\nlady could write, to Mrs. Luke Sharp--a poor woman who expected every\nhalfpenny of my dear husband's savings. How far she deserves them, you\nhave seen to-day. And sooner would I burn myself, like a sooty widow,\nwith all my goods evaporating, than ever leave sixpence for her to\nclutch, after such behaviour. Russel, you will remember this. You are\nmy executor.\"\n\n\"My dear Mrs. Fermitage, I pray you in no way to be excited. We have\nnot heard all of the story, and we know that servants who are of a\nfaithful kind exaggerate slights to their masters. It was one of the\nSquire's old servants who went. Your own would, perhaps, have known\nbetter. But now, may I see the things Mrs. Sharp sent you?\"\n\n\"You may. And you may take them, if you like. Or rather, I should say\nthat I beg you to take them. They ought to be in your custody. Will\nyou oblige me by taking them, Russel, and carefully inspecting them?\nFor that, of course, you must have daylight. Take them in the paper,\njust as they came, and keep them until I ask for them. They can be of\nno importance, because they are not what I lent to Gracie. Except for\nmy name on them, I am sure that I never could have remembered them.\nThey were darned in the days when I was poor. How often I wish that I\nstill were poor! Then nobody wanted to plot against me, and even to\nsteal my stockings! Oh, Russel, do you think they have murdered my\ndarling because she was to have my money?\"\n\n\"No, I think nothing of the kind! I believe that our darling Grace is\nalive; and I believe it tenfold since I saw these things! I am not\nvery old in the ways of the world; and my judgment has always been\nwrong throughout. But my faith is the same as the grand old Squire's,\nthough forty years of life behind him. I firmly believe that, blindly\nas we ourselves have managed everything, all will be guided aright for\nus; and happiness, even in this world, come. Because, though we have\ndone no great good, we have done harm to no one; and the Lord in\nheaven knows it! Also, He knows that we trust in Him, so far as the\ntrouble allows us. Very well; I will take these stockings home. You\nshall hear from me on Monday. I believe that our Grace is alive; and\nGod will enable me to deliver her! Please Him, I will never leave off\ntill then!\"\n\nThe young man looked so grand and strong in his faith, and truth, and\nrighteousness, that the elderly lady said no word, but let her eyes\nflow, and kissed him. He placed the stockings in an inner pocket,\ncarelessly wrapped in their paper; and he rode home apace to please\nhis mother; and having a cold on him from all his wettings, he\nperspired freely; and at every stretch of his galloping horse he was\nabsorbing typhus fever.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nSUO SIBI BACULO.\n\n\nIn April, when the sunny buds were showing forth their little frills;\nand birds, that love to hop sideways and try the toleration of the\nsprays that they are picking at, were almost too busy to chirp, and\nhung as happily as possible upside down, shaking the flutter of young\ngreen lace; while at the same time (for it is a season of great\ncoincidence) pigs reared aloft little corkscrew tails, and scorning\ntheir nose-rings, employed them as thimbles for making a punch in the\nbroidery of turf; also when--if the above is not enough--ducks and\ngeese, and cocks and hens, and even the dogs (who regard green grass\nas an emetic mainly) were all, without knowing it, beginning to wag\nthemselves as they walked or waddled, and to shine in the sun, and to\nlook very large in their own eyes and those of their consorts; neither\nwas there any man who could ride a horse, without knowing how--unless\nhe first had starved him;--at this young jump of the year and of life,\nGrace Oglander wanted to go for a walk.\n\nShe had not by any means been buried in the haunted quarry; neither\nhad she as yet required burial in any place. On the contrary, here she\nwalked more blooming and lovely than even her custom was; and the\nspring sun glistening upon the gold letters of her tombstone at\nBeckley, ordered by her good Aunt Fermitage--the same sun (without any\nstrain of his eyes at all likely to turn him to a Strabo) was\npleasantly making and taking light in the fluctuations of her growing\nhair.\n\nHer bright hair (which had been so cruelly cropped) instead of being\nthe worse for the process, was waving and glowing again in vast\nmultiplicity of vigour; like a specimen golden geranium shorn to\ndouble the number of its facets; and the blue in the spring of her\neyes was enough to dissatisfy the sun with his own sky. However, he\nshowed no discontent, but filled the young wood with cheerful rays,\nand the open glades with merriment, and even the sombre heart of\nlabouring man with streaks of liveliness. For here were comforts that\ncome in, without the eye considering them; and pleasures, which when\nthought of fly; and delicate delights, that have no idea of being\ndelightful.\n\nHereupon the proper thing is for something very harsh to break in, and\ndiscomfit all the wandering vision of earthly happiness. But the\nproper thing, in the present instance, showed its propriety by\nabsence. Nothing broke the flow of sunshine and the eddy of soft\nshade! unless it were a little ruffle of the south wind seeking leaves\nbefore they were quite ready; or the rustle of a rabbit, anxious about\nhis family; or the flutter of a bird, uncertain where to stand and\nsing his best.\n\nGrace (without a thought of what her own thoughts were or whether she\nhad any mind for thinking) rambled on, as a school-girl does when the\nhours of school are over. Every single fall or rise of nature's work\nwas kind to her, and led her into various veins of inductive\nunphilosophy. The packing and storing of last year's leaves, as if\nexceeding precious, gathered together by the wind and land in some\nrich rustling corner; the fitting of these into one another (for fear\nof losing one of them) wonderfully compact, as if with the hammer of a\ngold-beater, or the unknown implement wherewith a hen packs up her\nhatched egg-shells; the stiff upstanding of fine young stuff, hazel,\nash, and so on, tapering straight as a fishing-rod, and knobbing out\non either side with scarcely controllable bulges; over, and above, and\nthroughout all, and sensible of their largeness, the spreading\nquietude of great trees, just breathing their buds on the air again,\nbut not in a hurry (as in young days) to rush into perils of\nleafiness--pleased with all these proofs of soft revival and tender\nmovement, the fair maid almost forgot her own depression and\nperplexities.\n\nWhen howling winter was put to the rout and banished underground; and\nthe weather, perhaps, might be hoped to behave as decently as an\nEnglish spring, most skittish of seasons, should order it; and the\nblue ray of growth (which predominates then, according to the\nspectroscopists) was pouring encouragement on things green; how was a\ngirl in her own spring yet, to strive against all such influence?\n\nAt any rate Grace made no attempt to do anything of the kind; but\nwandered at her own sweet will, within the limits of her own parole.\nShe knew that she was in seclusion here, by her father's command, for\nher own good; and much as she yearned, from time to time, to be at\nhome, with all the many things she was so fond of, she was such a\ndutiful child, and so loving, that she put her own wishes by, and\nsmiled and sighed, instead of pouting. It could not be very long now,\nshe was sure, until her father should come home, and call for her, as\nhe had promised, and take her once more to beloved Beckley, after this\nmournful exile.\n\nFull as she was of all these thoughts, and heeding her own ways but\nlittle, so long as she kept within the outer ring of fence allowed to\nher, she fell into a little stupid fright, as she called it\nafterwards; for which there was no one but herself to blame. Only\nyesterday that good Miss Patch (her governess and sweet guardian) had\nparticularly begged her to be careful; because the times were now so\nbad that lawless people went everywhere. Miss Patch herself had heard\nseveral noises she could not at all account for; and while she\nconsidered it quite a duty to trace up everything to its proper\nsource, and absolutely confide in Providence, whose instrumentality is\nto be traced by all the poor instruments seeking it, still there are\ntimes when it cannot be done; and then the right thing is to keep\nwithin sight or call of a highly respectable man.\n\nThis was exactly what Grace might have done, and would have done, but\nfor the tempting day; for a truly respectable man had been near her,\nwhen first she began her little walk; a man whom she had beheld more\nthan once, but always at a little distance; a tall stout man,\naccording to her distant ideas of him, always busy in a quiet way, and\nalmost grudging the time to touch his broad-flapped hat without\nlifting his head, when he saw her in the woodland. Grace had never\nasked him who he was, nor been within talking distance of him; at\nwhich she was almost surprised, when she thought how glad, as a rule,\nare all Oxfordshire workmen to have a good excuse for leaving off.\nHowever, she was far beyond him now, when she met another man who\nfrightened her.\n\nThis was a fellow of dark complexion, dressed in a dirty fustian suit,\nand bearing on his shoulder a thick hedge-stake, from which hung a\nnumber of rabbit-skins. His character might be excellent; but his\nappearance did not recommend him to the confidence of the public.\nGrace shrank aside, but his quick eyes had spied her; and, indeed, she\nalmost feared from his manner, that he had been on the watch for her.\nSo she put the best face on it, and tried to pass him, without showing\nany misgivings.\n\nBut the rabbit-man was not to be thus defrauded of his right to good\nsociety. With a quick sharp turn he cast off the skins from his staff,\nand stretched that slimy implement across the way with one hand; while\nhe held forth the other caressingly, and performed a pretty little\ncaper.\n\n\"Allow me to pass, if you please,\" said Grace, attempting to look very\nresolute; \"these are our grounds. You are trespassing.\"\n\n\"Now, my purty young lady,\" said the rabbit-man, coming so close that\nshe could not fly, \"you wouldn't be too hard, would you now? I sees a\ngreat many young maids about--but Lor' there, what be they to compare\nwith you!\"\n\n\"I am sure that you do not mean any harm,\" replied Grace, though with\nmuch inward doubt: \"nobody ever does any harm to me; but every one is\nso kind to me. My father is so good to all who get into any trouble. I\nam not worth robbing, Mr. Rabbit-man; honest as you are, no doubt. But\nI think that I can find a shilling, for you to take home to your\nfamily.\"\n\n\"Now, Missy, sweet Missy, when once I seen you, how could I think of a\nshilling--or two? You was coming out herefor to kiss me, I know; the\nsame as I dreamed about last night. Lor' bless them bootiful eyes and\nlips, the most massionary man as ever was a'most, would sooner have a\nkiss, than a crown, of 'em!\"\n\n\"You insolent fellow! how dare you speak to me in this manner? Do you\nknow who I am? Do you know who my father is?\"\n\n\"No, Missy; but I dessay a thunderin' beak, as have sent me to prison;\nand now I have got you in prison too. No comin' out, wi'out paying of\nyour fine, my dear.\" The dirty scamp, with an appreciative grin, laid\nhold of poor Grace's trembling hand, and drew her towards him; while\nshe tried vainly to shriek, for her voice had forsaken her--when\nbodily down went the rabbit-man, felled by a most inconsiderate blow.\nHe dropped so suddenly, that he fetched poor Grace to her knees, by\nhis violent grasp of her; and when he let go, she could not get up for\na moment, because her head went round. Then two strong hands were put\ninto hers; and she rose, and faced a young gentleman.\n\nIn her confusion, and sense of vile indignity, she did the natural\nthing. She staggered away to a tree, and spread both hands before her\neyes, and burst forth sobbing, as if her heart would break. Instead of\napproaching to comfort her, the young man applied himself first to\nrevenge. He espied on the path the stick of the prostrate rabbit-man,\nand laid hold of it. Then, striving to keep his conscience clear, and\nby no means hit a man on the ground, he seized the poor dealer in fur\nby the neck, and propped him well up in a sapling fork. Having him\nthus well situated for penal operations, without any question of\njurisdiction, or even of the merits of the case, he proceeded to\nexhaust the utility of the stick, by breaking it over its owner's\nback. The calm wood echoed with the sound of wooden thumps, and the\nyoung buds trembled at the activity of a stick.\n\n\"Lor' a' mussy, a' mussy!\" cried the rabbit-man. \"You be gooin'\noutside of the bargain, sir!\"\n\n\"Oh, don't!--oh, please don't!\" Grace exclaimed, running forth from\nher retirement. \"I dare say he did not know any better. He may have\nhad a little too much beer. Poor fellow, he has had quite enough! Oh,\nstop, do stop, for my sake!\"\n\n\"For nothing else--in the world--would I stop,\" said the youth, who\nwas breathless with hitting so hard, and still looking yearningly at\nthe stick, now splintered by so much exercise; \"but if you beg him\noff, he gets off, of course--though he has not had half enough of it.\nYou vile black rascal, will you ever look at a young lady in your life\nagain?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, so--oh, no, sir--so help me--\" cried the rabbit-man, rubbing\nhimself all over. \"Do 'ee let me whisper a word to you.\"\n\n\"If I see your filthy sneaking face two seconds more, I'll take a new\nstick to you, and a much tougher one. Out of my sight with your\ncarrion!\"\n\nBlack George, with amazement and fury, gazed at the stern and\nthreatening countenance. Then seeing the elbow beginning to lift, he\nhobbled, as fast as his bruises allowed, to his bundle of skins in the\nbrushwood. Then with a whimper and snivel he passed the broken staff,\nnow thrown at him, through his savoury burden, and with exaggerated\nlimps departed.\n\n\"See if I don't show this to your governor,\" he muttered, as he turned\nback and scowled, when out of sight and hearing; \"I never were took in\nso over a job, in all my life afore, were I! One bull for a hiding\nlike that!\" he grumbled, as he pulled out a sovereign, and looked at\nit. \"Five bull would hardly cover it. Why, the young cove can't a'\nbeen told nort about it. A scurvy joke--a very scurvy joke. I ain't\ngot a bone in me as don't ache!\"\n\nLeaving him thus to pursue his departure, young Christopher Sharp,\nwith great self-content at the good luck of this exploit, turned\ntowards Grace, who was trembling and blushing; and he trembled and\nblushed in his turn at her.\n\n\"I am so sorry I have frightened you,\" he said in the most submissive\nway; \"I have done you more harm than good, I fear. I should have known\nbetter. But for the moment, I really could not command myself. I hope\nyou will not despise me for it.\"\n\n\"Despise you! Can I ever thank you? But I am not fit to do anything\nnow. I think I had better go home if you please. I am not likely to be\nannoyed again. And there is a good man in a field half-way.\"\n\n\"To be sure, you know best,\" the young man answered, cooling into\ndisappointment. \"Still, I may follow at a distance, mayn't I? The\nweather looks quite as if it would be dark. And at this time of year,\nscarcely anybody knows. There seem to be tramps almost everywhere. But\nI am sure I do not wish to press myself. I can go on with the business\nthat brought me here. I am searching for the true old wind-flower.\"\n\n\"Oh, are you?\" said Grace; \"how exceedingly lucky! I can show you\nexactly where to find it; if only you could manage to come to-morrow.\"\n\n\"To-morrow? Let me see--to-morrow! Yes, I believe I have no\nengagements. But will you not be afraid--I mean--after that\nblackguard's behaviour to-day? Not, of course, that he should be\nthought of twice--but still--oh, I never can express myself.\"\n\n\"I understand every word you would say,\" the young lady answered\ndecisively; \"and I never mean to wander so far again. Still, when I\nknow that you are botanising; or rather, I mean when a gentleman is\nnear--but I also can never express myself. You never must come--oh, I\nmean--good-bye! But I feel that you ought to be careful, because that\nbad man may lie in wait for you.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\nMISS PATCH.\n\n\nThat evening Grace made one more trial to procure a little comfort in\nher own affairs. In the dark low parlour of the cottage, where she had\nlived for the last three months, with only Miss Patch and a deaf old\nwoman for company and comfort, she sat by the fire and stitched hard,\nto abide her opportunity. At the corner of the table sat the good Miss\nPatch, with her spectacles on, and occasionally nodding over her\nfavourite author, Ezekiel.\n\nIt was impossible for anybody to look at Miss Patch, and believe in\nanything against her high integrity. That lofty nose, and hard-set\nmouth, and the fine abstracted yet benevolent gaze of those hollow\ngrey eyes, were enough to show that here was a lady of strict moral\nprinciple and high sense of duty. Incorruptible and grandly honest,\nbut prickly as a hedgehog with prejudice, she could not be driven into\nany evil course, and required no leading into what she thought the\nright one. And the right course to her was always the simplest of all\nthings to discover. Because it was that which led most directly to the\nglory of God at the expense of man. Anything that would smite down\npride, and overthrow earthly schemes, and abase the creature before\nthe Creator--that to her mind was the thing commanded; and if it\ncombined therewith a cut at \"papal arrogance,\" and priestly influence,\nthen the command was as delightful as it was imperative.\n\nThis tall and very clear-minded lady was, by an in and out sort of\nway, related to Squire Oglander. She called him her \"brother;\" and the\nSquire once (to comfort her in a vile toothache) had gone so far as to\ncall her his \"sister.\" Still that, to his mind, was a piece of\nflattery, not to be remembered when the tooth was stopped;--from no\npride on his part; but because of his ever-abiding execration of her\nfather--the well-known Captain Patch.\n\nCaptain Patch was the man who married the last Squire Oglander's\nsecond wife, that is to say, our good Squire's stepmother, after the\nlady had despatched her first husband, by uneasy stages, to a better\nworld. Captain Patch took her for her life-interest under the Oglander\nsettlement; and sterling friends of his declared him much too cheap at\nthe money. But the Oglanders took quite the contrary view, and hated\nhis name while he drew their cash. Yet the Captain proceeded to have a\nlarge family, of whom this Hannah Patch was the eldest.\n\nA godly father (as a general rule) has godless children; and happily\nthe converse of that rule holds true. The children of a godless father\n(scared by the misery they have seen), being acquitted of the fifth\ncommandment, frequently go back to the first. And so it befell with\nalmost all of that impious fellow's family. Nevertheless the Squire,\nbelieving in the \"commandment with promise,\" as well as the\ndenunciation at the end of the second, kept himself clear of the\nPatches, so far as good manners and kindness permitted him, Miss\nPatch, knowing how good she was, had keenly resented this prejudice\nafter vainly endeavouring to beat it down. Also she felt--not\nill-will--but still a melancholy forgiveness, and uneasiness about the\npresent position of Grace's poor mother, who had died in her sins,\nwithout any apology to Miss Patch.\n\nHowever, put all these things as one may (according to constitution),\nthis lady was very good in her way, and desired to make all others\ngood. There was not one faulty point about her, so far as she could\ndiscover it; and her rule of conduct was to judge her own doings by a\nhigher standard than was to be hoped for of any other person.\nTherefore of course, for other persons she could judge what was right\nand godly infinitely better than they could.\n\n\"Oh, Aunty,\" said Grace, by way of coaxing, having found this of good\nservice ere now; \"Aunty, don't you wish it was tea-time now?\"\n\n\"All meals come in their proper season. We should be grateful for\nthem; but not greedy.\"\n\n\"Oh, but, Aunty, you would not call it greedy to be hungry, I should\nhope. And you would be so hungry, if you only knew. Ah, but you won't\nget me to tell you though. I have always been celebrated for making\nthem. And this time I have quite surpassed myself. Now, how much will\nyou offer me to tell you what it is?\"\n\n\"Grace, you are frivolous!\" Miss Patch answered, yet with a slight\ninclination of her nose towards the brown kitchen where the wood-fire\nburned. \"If our food is wholesome, and vouchsafed in proportion to our\ndaily wants, we should lift up our hearts and be thankful. To let our\nminds dwell upon that which is a bodily question only, tends to\ndegrade them, and leads us to confound the true end--the glory of our\nMaker--with the means to that end, which are vulgarly called\nvictuals.\"\n\n\"Very well, Aunty, we will do with bread and butter. I only made my\nSally Lunns for you; and if they degrade your mind, I will give them\nto Margery Daw, or the cottage with ten children, down at the bottom\nof the wood. What a treat they will have, to be sure, with them!\"\n\n\"Not so, my dear! If you made them for me, I should fail in my duty if\nI refused them. We are ordered to be kind and courteous and\nlong-suffering towards one another. And I know that you make them\nparticularly well. They are quite unfit for people in that lower\nsphere of life. It would be quite sinful to tempt them so! They would\npuff them up with vanity, and worldliness, and pride. But if you\ninsist upon my tasting them, my dear, in justice to your work I think\nthat you should see to the toasting. Poor Mrs. Daw smokes everything.\"\n\n\"Of course she does. But I never meant to let her do them, Aunty. Only\nI wanted to be quite sure first that you would oblige me by tasting\nthem.\"\n\n\"My dear, I will do so, as soon as you please.\" The good lady shut up\nEzekiel, and waited. In a few minutes back came Grace, with all things\ndone to a nicety, each against each contending hotly whether the first\nhuman duty were to drink choice tea or to eat Sally Lunns. Miss Patch\nalways saw her course marked out by special guidance, and devoutly\nthus was enabled to act simultaneously.\n\nGrace took a little bit now and again to criticise her own handiwork,\nwhile with her bright eyes she watched the relaxing of the rigid\ncountenance. \"My dear,\" said Miss Patch, \"they are excellent! and they\ndo the greatest credit to your gifts! To let any talent lie idle is\nsinful. You might make a few every day, my dear.\"\n\n\"To be sure I will, Aunty, with the greatest pleasure. I do love to do\nanything that reminds me of my dear father! Oh, Aunty, will you tell\nme something?\"\n\n\"Yes, Grace, anything you ask aright. Young girls, of course, must\nsubmit to those whose duty it is to guide them. Undue curiosity must\nbe checked, as leading to perverse naughtiness. The principle, or want\nof principle, inculcated now by bad education, can lead to nothing\nelse but ruin and disgrace. How different all was when I was young! My\ngallant and spirited father, well known as a brave defender of his\ncountry, would never have dreamed of allowing us to be inquisitive as\nto his whereabouts. But all things are subverted now; filial duty is a\nthing unknown.\"\n\n\"Oh, but, Aunty, of course we never pretend to be half as good as you\nwere. Still I don't think that you can conclude that I do not love my\ndear father, because I am not one bit afraid of him.\"\n\n\"Don't cry, child. It is foolish and weak, and rebellious against\nDivine wisdom. All things are ordered for our good.\"\n\n\"Then crying must be ordered for our good, or we should be able to\nhelp it, ma'am. But you can't call it 'crying,' when I do just what I\ndo. It is such a long and lonely time; and I never have been away more\nthan a week at a time from my darling father, until now; and now it is\nfifteen weeks and five days since I saw him! Oh, it is dreadful to\nthink of!\"\n\n\"Very well, my dear, it may be fifty weeks, or fifty years, if the\nLord so wills. Self-command is one of the very first lessons that all\nhuman beings must learn.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know all that. And I do command myself to the very utmost. You\nknow that you praised me--quite praised me--yesterday; which is a rare\nthing for you to do. What did you say then? Please not to retract, and\nspoil the whole beauty of your good word.\"\n\n\"No, my dear child, you need not be afraid. Whenever you deserve\npraise, you shall have it. You saw an old sack with the name of\n'Beckley' on it, and although you were silly enough to set to and kiss\nit, as if it were your father, you positively did not shed one tear!\"\n\n\"For which I deserve a gold medal at least. I should like to have it\nfor my counterpane; but you sent it away most ruthlessly. Now, I want\nto know, Aunty, how it came to be here--miles, leagues, longitudes,\naway from darling Beckley?\"\n\nMiss Patch looked a little stern again at this. She perceived that her\nduty was to tell some stories, in a case of this kind, wherein the end\njustified the means so paramountly. Still every new story which she\nhad to tell seemed to make her more cross than the one before; whether\nfrom accumulated adverse score, or from the increased chances of\ndetection.\n\n\"Sacks arrive and sacks depart,\" she answered, as if laying down a\ndogma, \"according to the decrees of Providence. Ever since the time of\nJoseph, sacks have had their special mission. Our limited intelligence\ncannot follow the mundane pilgrimage of sacks.\"\n\n\"No, Aunty, of course, they get stolen so! But this particular sack I\nsaw had on it the name of a good honest man, one of the very best men\nin Beckley, Zacchary Cripps, the Carrier. His name did bring things to\nmy mind so--all the parcels and good nice things that he carries as if\nthey were made of glass; and the way my father looks over the hedge to\nwatch for his cart at the turn of the lane; and his pretty sister Etty\nsitting up as if she didn't want to be looked at; and old Dobbin\nsplashing along, plod, plod; and our Mary setting her cap at him\nvainly; and the way he goes rubbing his boots, as if he would have\nevery one of the nails out; and then dearest father calling out, 'Have\nyou brought us Her Majesty's new crown, Cripps?' and Cripps, putting\nup his hand like that, and grinning as if it was a grand idea, and\nthen slyly peeping round where the beer-jug hangs--oh, Aunty, shall I\never see it all again?\"\n\n\"Well, Grace, you will lose very little if you don't. It is one of my\nbrother's worst failings that he gives away fermented liquor to the\nlower orders inconsiderately. It encourages them in the bad habits to\nwhich they are only too prone, even when discouraged.\"\n\n\"Oh no, Aunty! Cripps is the soberest of men. And he does take his\nbeer with such a relish, it is quite a treat to see him. Oh, if I\ncould only see his old cart now, jogging along, like a man with one\nprong!\"\n\n\"Grace! Miss Oglander! Your metaphor is of an excessively vulgar\ndescription!\"\n\n\"Is it, Aunty? Then I am very sorry. I am sure I didn't mean any harm\nat all. Only I was thinking of the way a certain one-legged fiddler\nwalks--but, Aunty, all this is so frivolous! With all the solemn\nduties around us, Aunty----\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear, I do wish you would think a little more of them. Every\nday I do my best. Your nature is not more corrupt than must be, with\nall who have the sad _phronema sarkos_; but unhappily you always\nexhibit, both in word and action, something so--I will not use at all\na harsh word for it--something so sadly unsolemn.\"\n\n\"What can I do, Aunt? It really is not my fault. I try for five\nminutes together to be solemn. And then there comes something or\nother--how can I tell how?--that proves too much for me. My father\nused to love to see me laugh. He said it was quite the proper thing to\ndo. And he was so funny (when he had no trouble) that without putting\nanything into anybody's head, he set them all off laughing. Aunty, you\nwould have been amused to hear him. Quite in the quiet time, almost in\nthe evening, I have known my father make such beautiful jokes, without\nthinking of them, that I often longed for the old horn lanthorn, to\nsee all the people laughing. Even you would laugh, dear Aunty, if you\nonly heard him.\"\n\n\"The laughter of fools is the crackling of thorns. Grace, you are\nnothing but a very green goose. Even a stray lamb would afford me\nbetter hopes. But knock at the wall with the poker, my dear, that\nMargery Daw may come in to prayers.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nRUTS.\n\n\nThere are few things more interesting than ruts; regarded at the\nproper time, and in the proper manner. The artists, who show us so\nmany things unheeded by our duller selves, have dwelled on this\nsubject minutely, and shown their appreciation of a few good ruts. But\nthey are a little inclined sometimes to mark them too distinctly,\nscarcely making due allowance for the vast diversity of wheels, as\nwell as their many caprices of wagging, according to the state of\ntheir washers, the tug of the horse, and their own wearing, and a host\nof other things. Each rut moreover has a voice of its own; not only in\nits first formation, but at every period of depression in the muggy\nweather, or rough rebellion in a fine black frost, and above all other\ntimes in the loose insurrection of a thaw. There always is a bit of\nsomething hard and something soft in it; jags that contradict all\nthings with a jerk; and deep subsidence, soft as flattery.\n\nThere scarcely could be a finer sample of ruts than was afforded by a\nnarrow lane, or timber-track, at the extreme north-western outskirt of\nStow Forest. Everything here was favourable to the very finest growth\nof ruts. The road had once been made, which is a necessary foundation\nfor any masterpiece of rut-work; it then had been left to maintain\nitself, which encourages wholesome development. Another great\nadvantage was that the hard uniformity of straight lines had no chance\nhere of prevailing. For though the course was not so crooked, as in\nsome lanes it may have been, neither was there hedge, or rail, or\nother mean constriction; yet some fine old trees insisted now and\nthen, from either side, upon their own grand right of way, and\nstretched great arms that would sweep any driver, or horseman,\nbackward from his seat, unless he steered so as to double them.\n\nNow therefore to one of these corners came, from out the thicket of\nunderwood, a stout man with a crafty slouch, and a wary and suspicious\nglance. He had thrown a sack over his long white smock, whether to\nsave it from brambles, or to cover its glare in the shady wood; for\nhis general aspect was that of a man who likes to see all things, but\nnot to be seen. And now as he stooped to examine the ruts at a point\nwhere they clearly defined themselves, either from habit, or for\nspecial reason, he kept as far back by the briary ditch as he could\nwithout loss of near insight.\n\nThis man, being a member of the great Cripps race--whether worthy, or\nnot, of that staunch lineal excellence--had an hereditary perception\nof the right way to examine a rut. It would have been easy enough,\nperhaps, in a lane of little traffic, to judge whether anything lately\nhad passed, with the weather and ground as usual. But to-day--the day\nafter what has been told of--both weather and ground had just taken a\nturn, as abrupt as if both were feminine. The smile of soft spring was\nchanged into a frown, and the glad young buoyancy of the earth into a\nstiff sort of feeling, not frozen or crisp, but as happens to a man\nwhen a shiver of ague vibrates through a genial perspiration. To put\nit more clearly, the wind had chopped round to the east, and was\nblowing keenly--a masterful, strongly pronounced, and busily energetic\neast wind, as superior to hypocrisy as it was to all claims of mercy.\nAt the sound and the feel of its vehement sweep, surprise and alarm\nran through the wood; and the nestling-places of the sun ruffled up\nlike a hen that calls her chicks to her. The foremost of the buds of\nthe tall trees shook; not as they shake to a west wind, but with a\nsense of standing naked; the twigs that carried them flattened\nupwards, having lost all pleasure; the branches, instead of bowing\nkindly (as they do to any other wind), also went upward, with a stiff\ncold back, and a hatred at being treated so. Many and many a little\nleaf, still snug in its own overcoat, shrunk back, and preferred to\ndefer all the joys of the sky, if this were a sample of them. And many\nand many a big leaf (thrust, without any voice of its own, on the\nworld) had no chance of sighing yet, but whistled on the wind, and\nfelt it piping through its fluted heart; and knowing what a\nliver-coloured selvage must come round its green, bewailed the hour\nthat coaxed it forth from the notched, and tattered, and cast-off\nfrizzle, dancing by this time the wind knows where.\n\nBecause the east wind does what no other wind of the welkin ever does.\nIt does not come from the good sky downward, bringing higher breath to\nus; nor even on the level of the ancient things, spreading average\nmovement. This alone of all winds strikes from the face of the good\nearth upward, sweeping the blush from the skin of the land, and\nwrinkling all who live thereon. That is the time when the very best\nman finds little to rejoice in; unless it be a fire of seasoned logs,\nor his own contrariety; the fur of all animals (being their temper)\nmoves away and crawls on them; and even bland dogs and sweet horses\nfeel each several hair at issue with their well-brushed conscience.\n\nAll of that may be true; and yet there may be so many exceptions. At\nany rate, Master Leviticus Cripps looked none the worse for the whole\nof it. His cheeks were of richly varied fibre, like a new-shelled\nkidney-bean; his mouth (of a very considerable size) looked\ncomfortable and not hungry; and all around him there was an influence\ntending to intimate that he had dined.\n\nFor that he did not care as he should. He was not a man who allowed\nhis dinner to modify his character. The best streaky bacon and three\nnew-laid eggs had nurtured and manured his outer man, but failed to\nimprove him inwardly. Even the expression of his face was very\nslightly mollified by a first-rate meal; though some of the corners\nlooked lubricated.\n\n\"Hath a been by again, or hath a not?\" whispered Tickuss to himself,\nas he stared at a tangled web of ruts, and blessed the east wind for\nconfounding of them, so that a wheel could not swear to its own. The\neast wind answered with a scolding dash, that cast his sack over his\nhead, and shook out his white smock, scattering over the view, like a\njack-towel on the washing-line. Acknowledging this salutation with a\ncurse, Leviticus gathered his sack more tightly, and bending one long\nleg before him, stealthily peered awry at the wheel-tracks. This was\nthe way to discover whatever had happened last among them, instead of\nlooking across or along them, where the nicer shades would fail.\n\nAt first he could make but little of it. The east wind, whirling last\nyear's leaves from the couches where the west had piled them, and\nparching the flakes of the mud (as if exposed upon a scraper), had\nmade it a hard thing to settle the date of the transit even of a\ntimber dray. One of these had passed not long ago, with a great trunk\nswinging and swagging on the road, and slurring the scollops of the\nhorse-track.\n\nTherefore Tickuss, for some time, looked less wise than usual, and\nscratched his head. The brain replied, as it generally does, to this\nsoft local stimulant, so briskly in fact that the master soon was able\nto clap both his hands into their natural home--the pockets of his\nbreeches--and thus to survey the scene, and grin.\n\n\"Did 'ee think to do me, then, old brother Zak? Now did 'ee, did 'ee,\ndid 'ee? Ah, I were aborn afore you, Zak; or if I were not, it were\nmother's mistake. Go along wi 'ee, Zak, go along wi' 'ee! Go home to\nthy cat, and thy little kitten, Etty.\"\n\nHe knew, by the track, that his brother had passed a good while ago,\nor he would not have dared to speak in this rebellious vein. And what\nhe said next was even more disloyal.\n\n\"Danged if I ain't a gude mind to hornstring that old hosebird of a\nDobbin; ay, and I wull too, if Zak cometh prowling round my place,\nlike this. If a didn't mane no trachery, why dothn't a come in, and\ncall for a horn of ale and a bite of cold bakkon. Ho, ho, we've a\npretty well stopped him of that, though. No Master Zak now; go thine\nown ways. Keep thyzell to thyzell's the law of the land, to my\nthinking.\"\n\nNow a year, or even six months ago, Leviticus Cripps would sooner have\nlost a score of pigs than make such a speech, inhospitable, unnatural,\nunbrotherly, and violently un-Crippsian. Nothing but his own bad\nconscience (as he fell more and more away from honour and due esteem\nfor Beckley) could have suggested to him such a low and crooked view\nof Zacchary. The Carrier was not, in any measure, spying or prowling,\nor even watching. Such courses were out of his track altogether.\nRather would he have come with a fist, if the family honour demanded\nit; and therewith have converted his brother's olfactory organ into\nsomething loftier, as the medium of a sense of honesty.\n\nIn bare point of fact the family honour demanded this vindication. But\nthe need had not as yet been conveyed to the knowledge of the\nexecutive power. Zacchary had no suspicion at present of his brother's\nfearful lapse. And the only thing that brought him down that lane, was\nanother stroke of business in the washing line. Squire Corser had\nmarried a new sort of wife with a tendency towards the nobility;\nwherefore a monthly wash was out of keeping with her loftier views,\nthough she had a fine kitchen-garden; and she cried, till the Squire\nput the whole of it out, and sent it every week to Beckley. Hence a\nnew duty for Dobbin arose, which he faced with his usual patience,\nsimply reserving his right to travel at the pace he considered\nexpedient, and to have a stronger and deeper bottom stitched to his\nold nose-bag.\n\nThe first time the Carrier traversed that road, fraternal duty\nimpelled him to make all proper inquiries concerning the health of his\nbrother, and the character of his tap. But though the reply upon both\nthese points was favourable and pleasing, Zacchary met with so queer a\nreception, that dignity and self-respect compelled him to vow that for\nmany a journey he would pass with a dry mouth, rather than turn in. Of\nall the nephews and nieces, who loved to make him their own carrier,\nby sitting astride perhaps two on each leg, and one on each o\u00c3\u00b6litic\nvamp, and shouting \"Gee, gee,\" till he panted worse than Dobbin obese\nwith young saintfoin--likewise who always jumped up in his cart, and\nlaid hold of the reins and the whip even, and wore out the patience of\nany other horse except the horse before them--of all these delightful\nyoung pests, not one was now permitted to come near him. And not only\nthat, which alone was very strange, but even Susannah, the wife of\nLeviticus, and sister-in-law of Zacchary, evidently had upon her\ntongue laid a dumb weight of responsibility. Quite as if Zak were an\ninterloper, or an inquisitive stranger, thrusting a keen but\nunjustified nose into things that were better without it. Susannah was\nalways a very good woman, and used to look up to Zacchary, because her\nfather was a basket-maker; and even now she said no harm; but still\nthere was something about her, when she muttered that she must go and\nwash the potatoes, timid, and cold, and unhearty-like.\n\nThe Carrier made up his mind that they all were in trouble about their\nmortgage again; just as they were about six months back, when the land\nwas likely to be lost to them. And finding it not a desirable thing to\nbe called upon to contribute, he jogged well away from all such\ntactics, with his pockets buttoned. Not that he would have grudged any\ngood turn to any one of his family; but that his strong common sense\nallowed him no faith in a liar. And for many years he had known that\nTickuss was the liar of the family.\n\nLeviticus took quite a different view of the whole of this proceeding.\nHe was under no terror about his mortgage, for reasons as yet quite\nprivate; and his thick shallow cunning, like an underground gutter,\nwas full of its own rats only. He was certain that Zak had suspected\nhim, in spite of the care he had taken to keep his wife and children\naway from him; and believing this, he was certain also that Zak was\nplaying the spy on him.\n\nWhile he was meditating thus in his slow and turbid mind, and turning\naway from the corner of the road towards his beloved pig-lairs, the\nrattle of the sharp east wind was laden with a softer and heavier\nsound--the hoofs of a horse upon sod and mud. Tickuss, with two or\nthree long strides, got behind a crooked tree, so as to hide or\nexhibit himself, according to what should come to pass.\n\nWhat came to pass was a horse in the first place, of good family and\ngood feed; and on his back a man who shared in at least the latter\nexcellence. These two were not coming by the forest lane, but along a\nquiet narrow track, which cut off many of its corners. To judge of the\ntwo which looked the more honest, would have required another horse in\ncouncil with another man. At sight of this arrival Tickuss came forth,\nand scraped humbly.\n\n\"Don't stand there, like a monkey at a fair!\" cried Mr. Sharp--for he\nit was, and no mistake about him. \"Am I to come through the brambles\nto you? Can't you come up, like a man with his wits, where this\nbeastly wind doesn't blow so hard? Who can hear chaw-bacon talk off\nthere?\"\n\nLeviticus Cripps made a vast lot of gestures, commending the value of\ncaution, and pointing to the lane half a hundred yards off, as if it\ncontained a whole band of brigands. Mr. Sharp was not a patient man,\nand he knew that there was no danger. Therefore he swore pretty\nfreely, until the abject lord of swine restored him to a pleasant\nhumour by a pitiful tale of Black George's trouble on the previous\nafternoon.\n\n\"Catching it? Ay, and no mistake!\" Tickuss Cripps repeated; \"the dust\nfrom his jacket--oh Lor', oh Lor! I had followed on softly to see the\nfun, without Missy knowing I were near, of course; and may I never--if\nI didn't think a would a'most have killed un! Ho, ho! it'll be a good\nround week, I reckon, afore Jarge stitcheth up a ferret's mouth again.\nHe took me in terrible, that very morning; he were worse took in\nhiszell afore the arternoon was out. Praise the Lard for all his\ngoodness, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, well. It shall be made up to him. But of course you did not let\nhim, or any one else, get any idea who the lady is.\"\n\n\"Governor, no man hath any sense of that,\" Leviticus answered, with\none finger on his nose; \"save and excep' the old lady to the cottage,\nand you and I, and you knows whether there be any other.\"\n\n\"Leviticus Cripps, no lies to me! Of course your own wife has got the\nwhole thing out of you.\"\n\n\"Her!\" replied Tickuss, with a high contempt, for which he should have\nhad his ears boxed. \"No, no, master, a would have been all over\nHoxford months ago, if her had knowed ort of it. Her knoweth of course\nthere be zumbody up to cottage with old lady; but her hath zucked in\nthe American story, the same as everybody else have. Who would ever\ndrame of our old Squire's daughter, when the whole world hath killed\nand buried her? But none the less for that I kep her, and the\nchildren, out of the way of our Zak, I did. Um might go talking on the\nvolk up to cottage; and Zak would be for goin' up with one of his\ncards parraventur. Lor', how old Zak's eyes would come out of his\nhead! The old bat-fowl!--a would crack my zides to see un!\"\n\n\"You had better keep your fat sides sound and quiet,\" Mr. Sharp\nanswered sternly; for the slow wits of Tickuss, being tickled by that\nrare thing, an imagination, the result was of course a guffaw whose\nbreadth was exceeded only by its length.\n\n\"Oh Lor', oh Lor'--to see the old bat-fowl with the eyes comin' out of\nthe head of un! I'll be danged if I shouldn't choke!--oh Lor'!\"\n\nMr. Sharp saw that Tickuss, being once set off, might be trusted to go\non for at least half an hour, with minute-guns of cackling, loutish,\nself-glorifying cachinnation, as amenable to reason as a hiccough is.\nThe lawyer's time was too precious to waste thus, so having learned\nall that he cared to learn, and hearing wheels in the forest lane, he\nturned back along the narrow covert-ride; and he thought within\nhimself, for he never mused aloud--\"My bold stroke bids fair to be a\ngreat success. Nobody dreams that the girl is here. She herself\nbelieves every word that she is told. Kit is over head and ears; and\nshe will be the same with him, after that fine rescue. Our only\nmarplot has been laid by the heels at the very nick of time. We have\nonly to manage Kit himself--who is a most confounded sort. The luck is\nwith me, the luck is with me; and none shall be the wiser, Only give\nme one month more.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nRATS.\n\n\nMeanwhile at Shotover Grange, as well as at poor old Beckley Barton,\ntrouble was prevailing and the usual style of things upset. Russel\nOvershute, though not beloved by everybody (because of his strong will\nand words), was at any rate thought much of, and would be sadly missed\nby all. All the women of the household made an idol of him. He spoke\nso kindly, and said \"thank you,\" when many men would have grunted; and\nhe did not seem to be aware of any padlocked bar of humanity betwixt\nhim and his \"inferiors.\" At the same time he took no liberty any more\nthan he invited it; and his fine appearance and strength of readiness\nmade him look the master.\n\nThe men, on the other hand, were not sure of their sorrow to see less\nof him. He had always kept a keen eye upon them, as the master of a\nlarge house ought to do; and he always bore in mind the great truth\nthat men on the whole are much lazier than women. Still even the worst\nman about the place, while he freely took advantage of the present\nsweet immunity, would have been sorry to hear of a thing which might\ndrive him to seek for another place.\n\nBut what were all these, even all put together, in the weight of their\nfeelings, to compare with the mother of young Overshute? Many might\ncry, but none would mourn; nobody could have any right to mourn,\nexcept herself, his mother. This was her son, and her only hope. If it\npleased the Lord to rob her of him, He might as well take her soon\nafterwards, without any more to do.\n\nThis middle-aged lady was not pious, and made no pretence to be so.\nHer opinion was that the Lord awarded things according to what people\ndo, and left them at liberty to carry on, without any great\ninterference. She knew that she always had been superfluously able to\nmanage her own affairs; and to hear weak ladies going on and on about\nthe will of the Lord, and so forth, sometimes was a trial to her\nmanners and hospitality. In this terrible illness of her son, she had\nplenty of self-command, but very little resignation. With stern\nactivity and self-devotion, she watched him by day and by night so\njealously, that the nurses took offence and, fearing contagion, kept\ntheir distance, though they drew their wages.\n\nThis was the time to show what stuff both men and women were made of.\nFair-weather visitors, and delightful gossips, and the most devoted\nfriends, stood far aloof from the tainted gale, and fumigated their\nletters. The best of them sent their grooms to the lodge, with orders\nto be very careful, and to be sure to use tobacco during the moment of\ncolloquy. Others had so much faith that everything would be ordered\nfor the best, that they went to the seaside at once, to be delivered\nfrom presumption. Many saw a visitation for some secret sin, that\notherwise might have festered inwardly and destroyed the immortal\npart. Of course they would not even hint that he could have murdered\nGrace Oglander; nothing was further from their thoughts; the idea was\nmuch too terrible. Still there were many things that long had called\nfor explanation--and none had been afforded.\n\nLeaving these to go their way, a few kind souls came fluttering to the\nhouse of pestilence and death. Two housemaids, and the boy who cleaned\nthe servant's shoes, had been struck down, and never rose again,\nexcept with very cautious liftings into their last narrow cells. The\ndisease had spread from their master; and their constitutions were not\nlike his. Also the senior footman and the under-cook, were in their\nbeds; but the people who had their work to do believed them to be only\nshamming.\n\nThe master, however, still fought on, without any knowledge of the\nconflict. His mind was beyond all the guidance of will, and afar from\nits wonted subjects. It roved among clouds that had long blown away;\nnebules of logic, dialectic fogs, and thunderstorms of enthymeme, the\npelting of soritic hail, and all the other perturbed condition of\nundergraduate weather. In these things, unlike his friend Hardenow, he\nhad never taken delight, and now they rose up to avenge themselves. At\nother times the poor fellow lay in depths of deepest lethargy,\nvoiceless, motionless, and almost breathless. None but his mother\nwould believe sometimes that he was not downright dead and gone.\n\nOf course Mrs. Overshute had called in the best advice to be had from\nthe whole of the great profession of medicine. The roughness of the\nAbernethy school was still in vogue with country doctors; as even now\nsome of it may be found in a craft which ought to be gentle in\nproportion to its helplessness. With timid people this roughness goes\na long way towards creating faith, and makes them try to get better\nfor fear of being insulted about it. In London however this Centauric\nschool of medicine had not thriven, when the rude Nessus could not\nheal himself. A soft and soothing and genial race of \u00c3\u0086sculapians\narose; the \"vis medicatrix natur\u00c3\u00a6\" was exalted and fed with calves'\nfeet; and the hand of velvet and the tongue of silver commended and\nsweetened the pill of bread.\n\nAt the head of this pleasing and amiable band (who seldom either\nkilled or cured) was the famous Sir Anthony Thistledown. This was the\ngreat physician who had been invoked from London--to the strong\ndisgust of Splinters, then the foremost light at Oxford--when Squire\nOglander was seized with his very serious illness. And now Sir Anthony\ndid his best, with the aid of the reconciled Splinters, to soothe away\ndeath from the weary couch of the last of the race of Overshute.\n\n\"A pretty story I've aheerd in Oxford to-day; make me shamed, it\ndoth,\" said Zacchary Cripps to his sister Etty, while he smoked his\ncontemplative pipe by the fire of Stow logs, one cold and windy April\nevening. \"What do you think they've abeen and doed?\"\n\n\"Who, and where, Zak? How can I tell?\" Esther was busy, trimming three\nrashers, before she put them into the frying-pan. \"I really do believe\nyou expect me to know everybody that comes to your thoughts, quite as\nif it was my own mind.\"\n\n\"Well, so you ought,\" said the Carrier. \"The women nowadays are so\nsharp, no man can have his own mind to his self. But anyhow you ought\nto know that I mean up to poor Worship Overshute's. Ah, a fine young\ngentleman as ever lived. Seemeth to be no more than last night as he\nsat in that there chair and said the queerest thing as ever were said\nby a Justice of the county bench.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Zak? I never heard him say anything but was kind\nand proper, and a credit to him.\"\n\n\"Might be proper, or might not. But anyhow 'twere impossible. Did a\ntell me, or did a not, he would try to go a-poaching? When folk begins\nto talk like that, 'tis a sign of the ill come over them. Ah's me,\n'tis little he'll ever do of poaching, or shutting, or riding to\nhounds, or tasting again of my best bottle! Bad enough job it be about\nold Squire, but he be an old man in a way of speaking. Well, the Lord\nHe knoweth best, and us be all in the hollow of His hand. But he were\na fine young fellow, as fine a young fellow as ever I see; and not a\nbit of pride about un!\"\n\nSadly reflecting, the Carrier stopped his pipe with a twig from the\nfireplace, and gazed at the soot, because his eyes were bright.\n\n\"But what were you going to tell me?\" asked Etty, bringing her brother\nback to his subject, as she often was obliged to do.\n\n\"Railly, I be almost ashamed to tell 'ee. For such a thing to come to\npass in our own county, and a'most the same parish, and only two\nturnpike gates atween. What do 'ee think of every soul in that there\nhouse running right away, wi'out no notice, nor so much as 'good-bye!'\nOne and all on 'em, one and all; so I were told by a truthful man. And\nthe poor old leddy with her dying son, and not a single blessed woman\nfor to make the pap!\"\n\n\"I never can believe that they would be such cowards,\" Esther answered\nas she left her work and came to look at Zacchary. \"Men might, but\nwomen never, I should hope. And such a kind good house it is! Oh, Zak,\nit must be a wicked story!\"\n\n\"It is true enough, Etty, and too true. As I was a-coming home I seed\nfive on 'em standing all together under the elms by Magdalen College.\nTheir friends would not take them in, I was told, and nobody wouldn't\ngo nigh 'em. Perhaps they were sorry they had doed it then.\"\n\n\"The wretches! They ought to sleep out in the rain, without even a\npigsty for shelter! Now, Zak, I never do anything without you; but to\nShotover Grange I go to-night, unless you bar the door on me; and if\nyou do I will get out of window!\"\n\n\"Esther, I never heerd tell of such a thing. If you was under a duty,\nwell and good; but to fly into the face of the Lord like that, without\nno call upon you----\"\n\n\"There is a call upon me!\" she answered, flushing with calm\nresolution; \"it is the Lord that calls me, Zak, and He will send me\nback again. Now you shall have your supper, while you think it over\nquietly. I will not go without your leave, brother; but I am sure you\nwill give it when you come to think.\"\n\nThe Carrier, while he munched his bacon, and drank his quart of\nhome-brewed ale, was, in his quiet mind, more troubled than he had\never been before, or, at any rate, since he used to pass the tent of\nyoung Cinnaminta. That was the one great romance of his life, and\nsince he had quelled it with his sturdy strength, and looked round the\nworld as usual, scarcely any trouble worse than pence and halfpence\nhad been on him. From week to week, and year to year, he had worked a\ncheerful road of life, breathing the fine air, looking at the sights,\nfeeling as little as need be felt the influence of nature, making new\nfriends all along his beat, even quicker than the old ones went their\nway, carrying on a very decent trade, highly respecting the powers\nthat be, and highly respected by them. But now he found suddenly\nbrought before him a matter for consideration, which, in his ordinary\nstate of mind, would have circulated for a fortnight. Precipitance of\nmind to him was worse than driving down a quarry; his practice had\nalways been, and now it was become his habit, to turn every question\ninside out and upside down, and across and across, and finger every\nseam of it (as if he were buying a secondhand sack) ere ever he began\nto trust his weight to any side of it. To do all this required some\nhours with a mind so unelectric, and even after that he liked to have\na good night's sleep, and find the core of his resolve set hard in the\nmorning.\n\nFor this due process there was now no time. He dared not even to begin\nit, knowing that it could not be wrought out; therefore he betook\nhimself to a plan which once before had served him well. After groping\nin the bottom of a sacred pocket (where sample-beans and scarlet\nrunners got into the loops of keys, and bits of whipcord were wound\ntightly round old turnpike tickets, and a little shoemaker's awl in a\ncork kept company with a shoe-pick), Master Cripps with his\nblunt-headed fingers got hold of a crooked sixpence. The bend alone\nwould have only conferred a simple charm upon it, but when to the bend\nthere was added a hole, that sixpence became Delphic. Cripps had\nconsulted it once before when a quick-tempered farmer hurried him\nconcerning the purchase of a rick of hay. The Carrier had no\nsuperstition, but he greatly abounded with gratitude; and, having made\na great hit about that rick, the least he could do to the sixpence was\nto consult it again under similar hurry.\n\nHe said to himself, \"Now the Lord send me right. If you comes out\nheads, little Etty shall go; if you comes out tails, I shall take it\nfor a sign that we ought to turn tails in this here job.\"\n\nHe said no more, but with great extrication worked his oracular\nsixpence up through a rattle of obstructions. Like the lots cast in a\nsteep-headed man's helmet, up came the sixpence reluctantly.\n\n\"I have a got 'ee. Now, what dost thou say?\" cried Cripps, with the\ntriumph of an obstinate man. \"Never a lie hast thou told me yet. Spake\nup, little fellow.\" Being thus adjured, the crooked sixpence, in\ngratitude for much friction, gleamed softly in the firelight; but even\nthe Carrier, keen as his eyes were, could not make out head or tail.\n\"Vetch me a can'le and the looking-glass,\" he called out to Esther;\nthe looking-glass being a large old lens, which had been left behind\nby Hardenow. Esther brought both in about half a minute; and Cripps,\nwith the little coin sternly sitting as flatly in his palm as its form\nallowed, began to examine it carefully. With one eye shut, as if\nfiring a gun, he tried the lens at every distance from a foot to half\nan inch, shifting the candle about until some of his frizzly hair took\nfire, and with this assistance he exclaimed at last, \"Heads,\nchild!--heads it is! Thou shalt go; the will of the Lord ordaineth it!\nPlaize the Lord to send thee back safe and sound as now thou goest!\nNone on us, to my knowledge, has done aught to deserve to be punished\nfor.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\nBOOTS ON.\n\n\nWhen a very active man is suddenly \"laid by the heels;\" sad as the\ndispensation is, there are sure to be some who rejoice in it. Even if\nit be only a zealous clerk, sausage-maker, or grave-digger, thus upset\nin his activities; there are one or two compeers who rejoice in the\nheart, while they deeply lament with the lip. Not that they have the\nvery smallest atom of ill-will about them. They are thoroughly\ngood-hearted fellows, as are nine men out of every ten; and within, as\nwell as without, they would grieve to hear that their valued friend\nwas dead.\n\nStill, for the moment, and while we believe, as everybody does about\neverybody else, that he is sure as a top to come round again, it is a\nrelief to have this busy fellow just out of the way a bit; and there\nis an inward hugging of the lazier spirit at the thought that the\nrestless one will have received a lesson, and be pulled back to a\nmilder state. Be this view of the matter either true or false, in a\ngeneral way, at least in this particular instance (the illness of\nRussel Overshute), some of it seemed to apply right well.\n\nThere was no one who wished him positive death, not even of those whom\nhe had most justly visited with the treadmill; but there were several\nwho were not sorry to hear of this check to his energies; and foremost\namong them might be counted Mr. Luke Sharp and the great John Smith.\n\nMr. John Smith had surprised his friends, and disappointed the entire\npublic, by finding out nothing at all about anything after his one\ngreat discovery, made with the help of the British army. For some\ncause or other, best known to himself, he had dropped his\nindefatigability and taken to very grave shakes of his head instead of\nnimble footings. He feigned to be very busy still with this leading\ncase of the neighbourhood; but though his superiors might believe it,\nhis underlings were not to be misled. All of these knew whether Mr.\nJohn was launching thunderbolts or throwing dust, and were well aware\nthat he had quite taken up with the latter process in the Beckley\ncase.\n\nWhy, or even exactly when, this change had occurred, they did not\nknow, only they were sure that the reason lay deep in the pocket of\nMr. Smith; which conclusion, as we shall see, did no more honour to\ntheir heads than to their hearts.\n\nBut still, whatever his feelings were, or his desires in the matter,\nthe resolute face and active step of this intelligent officer were\noften to be seen and heard at Beckley; and to several persons in the\nvillage they were becoming welcome. Numbers Cripps, the butcher, was\nmoved with gentle goodwill towards him, having heard what a fine knife\nand fork he played, and finding it true in the Squire's bill. Also\nPhil Hiss of the Dusty Anvil found the fame of this gentleman telling\non his average receipts; and several old women, who had some time back\nmade up their accounts for a better world, and were taking the\ninterest in scandal, hailed with delight this unexpected bonus and\ntrue premium. To mention young spinsters would be immoral, for none of\nthem had any certainty whether there was, or was not, any Mrs. John\nSmith. Rustic modesty forbade that the Carrier should be asked to\nsettle this great point directly. Still there were methods of letting\nhim know how desirable any information was.\n\nAt all these symptoms of renown, when brought to his knowledge, Mr.\nSmith only smiled and shook his head. He had several good reasons of\nhis own for haunting the village as he did; one of them being that he\nthus obeyed the general orders he had received. Also he really liked\nthe Squire, his victuals, and his domestics. Among these latter he had\nquite outlived any little prejudice created by his early manner; and\neven Mary Hookham was now inclined to use him as an irritant, or\nstimulant, for the lukewarm Cripps. But being a sharp and quick young\nwoman, Mary took care not to go too far.\n\n\"How is the fine old gentleman now? Mary, my love, how is he?\" Mr.\nSmith asked, as he pulled off his cloak in the lobby, just after\nchurch-time, and just before early dinner-time, on the morrow of that\nSaturday night when Esther set off for Shotover. Although it was\nspring, she had not gone alone, but had taken a son of the butcher\nwith her; the effect of that quarry-scene on her nerves would last as\nlong as she did.\n\nMary was bound not to answer Mr. Smith whenever he spoke in that\nfestive way. That much had been settled betwixt her and her mother,\nremembering what a place Beckley was. But she did all her duty, as a\ngood maid should, in the way of receiving a visitor. She took his\ncloak from him, and she hung it on a hook--most men wore a cloak just\nthen for walking, whether it were wet or dry, and part of the coming\n\"Tractarian movement\" was to cast away that cloak--and then Mary saw\non the feathery collar a leaf-bud that threatened to become a moth,\naccording to her entomology. This she picked out, with a \"shoo\" and a\n\"shish\" as she trod it underfoot; and Mr. John Smith, having terror of\ninsects, and being a very clean man, recoiled, just when he was\nthinking of stealing a kiss. This little piece of business placed them\non their proper terms again.\n\n\"How is your master, Miss Hookham? I hope you find him getting better.\nEverything now is looking up again!\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Smith; he is very sadly. Thanking you, sir, for inquiring of\nhim. He do seem a little better one day, and we all begins to hope and\nhope, and then there come something all over him again, the same as\nmight be this here cloak, sir, thrown on the head of that there stick.\nBut come in and see him, Mr. Smith, if you please. I thought it was\nthe rector when you rang. But master will be glad to see you every bit\nthe same as if you was, no doubt.\"\n\nJohn Smith, who was never to be put down by any small comparisons,\nfollowed quick Mary with a stedfast march over the quiet matting.\nPotters, with their broken shards, had not yet made it a trial to\nwalk, and a still greater trial to look downward, on the road to\ndinner. In the long, old-fashioned dining-room sat the Squire at the\nhead of his table. For many years it had been his wont to have an\nearly dinner on Sunday, with a knife and fork always ready for the\nclergyman, who was a bachelor of middle age. The clergyman came, or\ndid not come, according to his own convenience, without ceremony or\napology.\n\n\"I beg you to excuse,\" said the Squire rising, as Smith was shown into\nthe room, \"my absence from church this morning, Mr. Warbelow. I had\nquite made up my mind to go, and everything was quite ready, when I\ndid not feel quite so well as usual, and was ordered to stay at home.\"\n\nSquire Oglander made his fine old-fashioned bow when he had spoken,\nand held out his hand for the parson to take it, as the parson always\ndid, with eyes that gave a look of grief and then fell, and kind lips\nthat murmured that all things were ordered for the best. But instead\nof the parson's gentle clasp, the Squire, whose sight was beginning to\nfail together with his other faculties, was saluted with a strong\nrough grasp, and a gaze from entirely unclerical eyes.\n\n\"How is your Worship? Well, nicely, I hope. Charming you look, sir, as\never I see.\"\n\n\"Sir, I thank you. I am in good health. But I have not the honour of\nremembering your name.\"\n\n\"Smith, your Worship--John Smith, at your service; as he was the day\nbefore yesterday. 'Out of sight out of mind,' the old saying is. I\nsuppose you find it so, sir!\"\n\nWith this home-thrust, delivered quite unwittingly, Mr. Smith sat\ndown; his opinion was that Her Majesty's service levelled all\ndistinctions. Mr. Oglander gave him one glance, like the keen look of\nhis better days, and then turned away and gazed round the room for\nsomething out of sight, but never likely to be out of mind. The old\nman was weak, and knew his weakness. In the presence of a gentleman he\nmight have broken down and wept, and been much better for it; but\nbefore a man of this sort, not a sign would he let out of the sorrow\nthat was killing him.\n\nIt had been settled by all doctors, when the Squire was in his first\nillness, that nothing should be said by Smith, or any one else\n(without great cause), about the trouble which was ever in the heart\nof all the house. Nothing, at least to the Squire himself, for fear of\nexciting him fatally. Little rumours might be filtered through the\nservants towards him; especially through Mother Hookham, who put\nhopeful grains of Paradise into the heavy beer of fact. Such things\ndid the old man good. His faith in the Lord, when beginning to flag,\nwas renewed by fibs of this good old woman; and each confirmed the\nother.\n\nIn former days he would have resented and nipped in the\nbud--kind-hearted as he was--John Smith's familiarity. But now he had\nno heart to care about any of such trifles. He begged Mr. Smith to\ntake a chair, quite as if he were waiting to be invited; then, weak as\nhe was, he tottered to the bell-pull, rather than ask his guest to\nring. John Smith jumped up to help, but felt uncertain what good\nmanners were.\n\n\"Mary,\" said the Squire, when Mary came; \"you always look out of the\nwindow, I think, to see the people come out of church.\"\n\n\"Never, sir, never! Except whenever I feels wicked not to a' been\nthere myself. Such time it seemeth to do me good; like smelling of the\ngood words over there.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is very right. All I want to know is whether Mr. Warbelow\nis coming up here.\"\n\n\"No, sir; not this time, I believe. He seemed to have got a young\nlady with un, as wore a blue cloak with three slashes to the sleeve,\nand a bonnet with yellow French roses in it, and a striped skirt,\nmade of the very same stuff as I seed in to Cavell's--no, not\nCavell's--t'other shop over the way, round the corner; likewise her\nhad----\"\n\n\"Then, Mary, bring in the dinner, if you please. This gentleman will\ndine with me, instead of Mr. Warbelow.\"\n\n\"Well now, if I ever did!\" Miss Hookham exclaimed to herself in the\npassage. \"Why, a must be a sort of a gentleman! Master wouldn't dine\nalong of Master Cripps; but to my mind Zak be the gentleman afore he!\"\n\nThe Squire's oblique little sarcasm--if sarcasm at all it were--failed\nto hit Mr. Smith altogether; he cordially accepted plate and spoon,\nand fell to at the soup, which was excellent. The soup was followed by\na fine sirloin; whereupon Mr. Oglander, through some association of\nideas, could not suppress a little sigh.\n\n\"Never sigh at your meat, sir,\" cried Mr. Smith; \"give me the\ncarving-knife, sir, if you are unequal to the situation. To sigh at\nsuch a sirloin--oh fie, oh fie!\"\n\n\"I was thinking of some one who always used to like the brown,\" the\nold man said, in the simplest manner, as if an apology were needed.\n\n\"Well, sir, I like the brown very much! I will put it by for myself,\nsir, and help you to an inner slice. Here, Mary, a plate for your\nmaster! Quick! Everything will be cold, my goodness! And who sliced\nthis horse-radish, pray? for slicing it is, not scraping.\"\n\nMary was obliged to bite her tongue to keep it in any way mannersome;\nwhen the door was thrown open, and in came her mother, with her face\nquite white, and both hands stretched on high.\n\n\"Oh my! oh my! a sin I call it--a wicked, cruel, sinful sin!\" Widow\nHookham exclaimed as soon as she could speak. \"All over the village,\nall over the parish, in two days' time at the latest it will be. Oh,\nhow could your Worship allow of it?\"\n\n\"Give your mamma a glass of wine, my dear,\" said Mr. John Smith, as\nthe widow fell back, with violent menace of fainting, or worse; while\nthe poor Squire, expecting some new blow, folded his tremulous hands\nto receive it. \"Take a good drink, ma'am, and then relieve your\nsystem.\"\n\n\"That Cripps! oh, that Cripps!\" exclaimed Mrs. Hookham, as soon as the\nwine, which first \"went the wrong way,\" had taken the right direction;\n\"if ever a darter of mine hath Cripps, in spite of two stockings of\nmoney, they say----\"\n\n\"What is it about Cripps?\" asked the Squire, in a voice that required\nan immediate answer. The first news of his trouble had come through\nCripps; and now, in his helpless condition, he always connected the\nname of the Carrier with the solution, if one there should be.\n\n\"He hath done a thing he ought to be ashamed on!\" screamed Mrs.\nHookham, with such excitement, that they were forced to give her\nanother glass of wine; \"he hath brought into this parish, and the\nbuzzum of his family, pestilence and death, he hath! And who be he to\ndo such a thing, a road-faring, twopenny carrier?\"\n\n\"Cripps charges a good deal more than twopence,\" said Mr. Oglander\nquietly; for his hopes and fears were once more postponed.\n\n\"He hath brought the worst load ever were brought!\" cried the widow,\ngrowing eloquent. \"Black death, and the plague, and the murrain of\nEgypt hath come in through Cripps the Carrier! How much will he charge\nBeckley, your Worship? How much shall Beckley pay him, when she\nmourneth for her children? when she spreadeth forth her hands and\nseeketh north and south, and cannot find them, because they are not?\"\n\n\"What is it, good woman?\" cried Smith, impatiently, \"what is all this\nuproar? do tell us, and have done with it?\"\n\n\"Good man,\" replied Widow Hookham tartly, \"my words are addressed to\nyour betters, sir. Your Worship knoweth well that Master Kale hath\nleave and license for his Sunday dinner; ever since his poor wife\ndied, he sitteth with a knife and fork to the right side of our\ncook-maid. He were that genteel, I do assure you, although his\nappearance bespeaketh it not, and city gents may look down on him; he\nhad such a sense of propriety, not a word did he say all the time of\ndinner to raise an objection to the weakest stomach. But as soon as he\nsee that all were done, and the parlour dinner forward, he layeth his\nfinger on his lips, and looketh to me as the prime authority; and when\nI ask him to speak out, no secrets being among good friends, what he\nsaid were a deal too much for me, or any other Christian person.\"\n\n\"Well, well, ma'am, if your own dinner was respected, you might have\nshowed some respect for ours,\" Mr. Smith exclaimed very sadly,\nbeholding the gravy in the channelled dish margined with grease, and\nthe noble sirloin weeping with lost opportunity. But Mr. Oglander took\nno notice. To such things he was indifferent now.\n\n\"To keep the mind dwelling upon earthly victuals,\" the widow replied\nseverely, \"on the Lord's Day, and with the Day of the Lord a-hanging\nspecial over us--such things is beyond me to deal with, and calls for\nMr. Warbelow. Carrier Cripps hath sent his sister over to nurse Squire\nOvershute!\"\n\nJohn Smith pretended to be busy with his beef, but Mary, who made a\npoint of watching whatever he did (without well knowing why), startled\nas she was by her mother's words, this girl had her quick eyes upon\nhis face, and was sure that it lost colour, as the carved sirloin of\nbeef had done from the trickling of the gravy.\n\n\"Overshute! nurse Mr. Overshute?\" cried the Squire with great\nastonishment. \"Why, what ails Mr. Overshute? It is a long time since I\nhave seen him, and I thought that he had perhaps forgotten me. He used\nto come very often, when--but who am I to tempt him? When my darling\nwas here, in the time of my darling, everybody came to visit me; now\nnobody comes, and of course it is right. There is nobody for them to\nlook at now, and no one to make them laugh a little. Ah, she used to\nmake them laugh, till I was quite jealous, I do believe; not of\nmyself, bless your heart! but of her, because I never liked her to\nhave too much to say to anybody, unless it was one who could\nunderstand her. And nobody ever turned up that was able, in any way,\nto understand her, except her poor old father, sir.\"\n\nThe Squire, at the end of this long speech (which had been a great\ndeal too much for him) stood up, and flourished his fork, which should\nhave been better employed in feeding him, and looked from face to\nface, in fear that he had made himself ridiculous. Nobody laughed at\nhim, or even smiled; and he was pleased with this, and resolved never\nto give such occasion again; because it would have shamed him so. And\nafter all it was his own business. None of these people could have any\nidea, and he hoped they never might have. By this time his mind was\ndropping softly into some confusion, and feeling it so, he sat down\nagain, and drank the glass of wine which Mary Hookham kindly held for\nhim.\n\nFor a few minutes Mr. John Smith had his flourish (to let both the\nwomen be sure who he was) all about the Queen, and the law of the\nland, and the jurisdiction of the Bench, and he threatened the absent\nCripps with three months' imprisonment, and perhaps the treadmill. He\nknew that he was talking unswept rubbish, but his audience was female.\nThey listened to him without leaving off their work; and their courage\nincreased as his did.\n\nBut presently Mr. Oglander, who had seemed to be taking a nap, arose,\nand said, as clearly as ever he had said anything in his clearest\ndays--\n\n\"Mary, go and tell Charles to put the saddle on the mare at once.\"\n\n\"Oh Lor', sir! whatever are you thinking of? Lor' a massy, sir, I\ncouldn't do it, I couldn't! You ain't abeen a-horseback for nigh four\nmonths, and your orders is to keep quiet in your chair, and not even\nlook out o' winder, sir. Do 'ee plaize to go into your slippers, sir?\"\n\n\"I will not go into my slippers, Mary. I will go into my boots. I hear\nthat Mr. Overshute is ill, and I gather from what you have all been\nsaying that his illness is of such a kind that nobody will go near\nhim. I have wronged the young gentleman bitterly, and I will do my\nbest to right myself. If I never do another thing, I will ride to\nShotover this day. Order the mare, as I tell you, and the air will do\nme good, please God!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\nA SPIDER'S DINNER-PARTY.\n\n\nNow was the happy time when Oxford, ever old, yet ever fresh with the\ngay triennial crown of youth, was preparing itself for that sweet\nleisure for which it is seldom ill prepared. Being the paramount\ncastle and strongest feudal hold of stout \"idlesse,\" this fair city\nhas not much to do to get itself into prime condition for the noblest\nefforts and most arduous feats of invincible laziness. The first and\nmost essential step is to summon all her students, and send them to\nchapel to pay their vows. After this there need be no misgiving or\nfear of industry. With one accord they issue forth, all pledged to do\nnothing for the day, week, or month; each intellectual brow is stamped\nwith the strongest resolve not to open a book; and\n\n    \"Games are the spur which the clear spirit doth raise,\n    To scorn the Dons, and live luxurious days.\"\n\nThis being so, whether winter shatters the Isid wave against Folly\nbridge, or spring's arrival rustles in the wavering leaves of\nMagdalen, or autumn strews the chastened fragrance of many brewers on\nripe air--how much more when beauteous summer fosters the coy down on\nthe lip of the junior sophist like thistle-seed, and casts the\nfreshman's shadow hotly on the flags of High Street--now or never is\nthe proper period not to overwork one's self, and the hour for taking\nit easy.\n\nBut against each sacred rite and hallowed custom of the place, against\neach good old-fashioned smoothness, and fine-fed sequacity, a rapid\nstir was now arising, and a strong desire to give a shove. There were\nsome few people who really thought that the little world in which they\nlay was one they ought to move in; that perfect life was not to be had\nwithout some attempt at breathing; and that a fire (though beautifully\nlaid) gives little warmth till kindled.\n\nHowever, these were young fellows mostly, clever in their way, but not\nquite sound; and the heads of houses, generally speaking, abode on the\nhouse-top, and did not come down. Still they kept their sagacious eyes\non the movement gathering down below, and made up their minds to crush\nit as soon as they could be quite certain of being too late. But these\nthings ride not upon the cart of Cripps--though Cripps is a\ntheologian, when you beat his charges down.\n\nAfter the Easter vacation was over, with too few fattening festivals,\nthe most popular tutor in Brasenose (being the only one who ever tried\nto teach) came back to his rooms and his college work with a very fine\nappetite for doing good;--according, at least, to his own ideas of\ngood, and duty, and usefulness; all of which were fundamentally wrong\nin the opinion of the other tutors. But Hardenow, while he avoided\ncarefully all disputes with his colleagues, strictly kept to his own\ncourse, and doing more work than the other five (all put together)\nattempted, was permitted to have his own way, because of the trouble\nthere might be in stopping him.\n\nThe college met for the idle term, on Saturday morning, as usual. On\nSaturday afternoon Hardenow led off his old \"squad\" with two new\nrecruits, for their fifteen miles of hard walking. Athletics and\ntraining were as yet unknown (except with the \"eight\" for Henley), and\nthis Tractarian movement may have earned its name, ere the birth of\nNo. 90, from the tract of road traversed, in a toe-and-heel track, by\nthe fine young fellows who were up to it. At any rate that was what\nthe country people said, and these are more often right than wrong,\nand the same opinion still abides with them.\n\nHardenow only took this long tramp for the sake of collecting his\nforces. Saturday was not their proper day for this very admirable\ncoat-tail chase. Neither did they swallow hill and plain in this\nmanner on a Sunday. Lectures were needful to fetch them up to the\nproper pitch for striding so. Wherefore on the morrow Mr. Hardenow was\nfree for a cruise on his own account, after morning sermon at St.\nMary's; and not having heard of his old friend Russel for several\nweeks, he resolved to go and hunt him up in his own home.\n\nIt was not a possible thing for this very active and spare-bodied man\nto lounge upon his road. Whatever it was that he undertook, he carried\non the action with such a swing and emphasis, that he seemed to be\ndoing nothing else. He wore a short spencer, and a long-tailed coat,\n\"typical\"--to use the pet word of that age--both of his curt brevity\nand his ankle-reaching gravity. His jacket stuck into him, and his\ncoat struck away with the power of an adverse wind, while the boys\nturned back and stared at him; but he was so accustomed to that sort\nof thing that he never thought of looking round. He might have been\ntail-piped for seven leagues without troubling his head about it.\n\nThis was a man of great power of mind, and led up to a lofty standard;\npure, unselfish, good, and grand (so far as any grandeur can be in the\nhuman compound), watchful over himself at almost every corner of his\nways, kind of heart, and fond of children; loving all simplicity,\nquick to catch and glance the meaning of minds very different from his\nown; subtle also, and deep to reason, but never much inclined to\nargue. He had a shy and very peculiar manner of turning his eyes away\nfrom even an undergraduate, when his words did not command assent; as\nsometimes happened with freshmen full of conceit from some great\npublic school.\n\nThe manner of his mind was never to assert itself, or enter into\ncontroversy. He felt that no arguments would stir himself when he had\nsolidly cast his thoughts; and he had of all courtesies the rarest (at\nany rate with Englishmen), the courtesy of hoping that another could\nreason as well as himself.\n\nIn this honest and strenuous nature there was one deficiency. The Rev.\nThomas Hardenow, copious of mind and active, clear of memory, and keen\nat every knot of scholarship, patient and candid too, and not at all\nintolerant, yet never could reach the highest rank, through want of\nnative humour. His view of things was nearly always anxious and\nearnest. His standing-point was so fixed and stable, that every\nsubject might be said to revolve on its own axis during its revolution\nround him; and the side that never presented itself was the ludicrous\nor lightsome one.\n\nAs he strode up the hill, with the back of his leg-line concave at the\ncalf, instead of convex (whenever his fluttering skirt allowed a\nglimpse of what he never thought about), it was brought home suddenly\nto his ranging mind that he might be within view of Beckley. At a bend\nof the rising road he turned, and endwise down a plait of hills, and\nbetween soft pillowy folds of trees, the simple old church of Beckley\nstood, for his thoughts to make the most of it. And, to guide them,\nthe chime of the gentle bells, foretelling of the service at three\no'clock, came on the tremulous conveyance of the wind, murmuring the\nburden he knew so well--\"old men and ancient dames, married folk and\nchildren, bachelors and maidens, all come to church!\"\n\nHardenow thought of the months he had spent, some few years back, in\nthat quiet place; of the long, laborious, lonesome days, the solid\nhours divided well, the space allotted for each hard drill; then (when\nthe pages grew dim and dark, and the bat flitted over the lattice, or\nthe white owl sailed to the rickyard), the glory of sallying into the\nair, inhaling grander volumes than ever from mortal breath proceeded,\nand plunging into leaves that speak of one great Author only. And well\nhe remembered in all that toil the pure delight of the Sunday; the\nprecious balm of kicking out both legs, and turning on the pillow\nuntil eight o'clock; the leisurely breakfast with the Saturday papers,\ninstead of Aristotle; the instructive and amusing walk to church,\nwhere everybody admired him, and he set the fashion for at least ten\nyears; the dread of the parson that a man who was known as the best of\nhis year at Oxford should pick out the fallacies of his old logic; and\nthen the culminating triumph of Sabbatic jubilee--the dinner, the\ndinner, wherewith the whole week had been privily gestating; up to\nthat crowning moment when Cripps, in a coat of no mean broadcloth,\nentered with a dish of Crippsic size, with the \"trimmings\" coming\nafter him in a tray, and lifting the cover with a pant and flourish,\nsaid, \"Well, sir, now, what do 'ee plaize to think of that?\"\n\nNor in this pleasant retrospect of kindness and simplicity was the\nelement of rustic grace and beauty wholly absent--the slight young\nfigure that flitted in and out, with quick desire to please him; the\nsoft pretty smile with which his improvements of Beckley dialect were\nreceived; and the sweet gray eyes that filled with tears so, the day\nbefore his college met. Hardenow had feared, humble-minded as he was,\nthat the young girl might be falling into liking him too well; and he\nknew that there might be on his own part too much reciprocity.\nTherefore (much as he loved Cripps, and fully as he allowed for all\nthat was to be said upon every side), he had felt himself bound to\ntake no more than a distant view of Beckley.\n\nEven now, after three years and a half, there was some resolve in him\nto that effect, or the residue of a resolution. He turned from the\ngentle invitation of the distant bells, and went on with his face set\ntowards the house of his old friend, Overshute. When he came to the\nlodge (which was like a great beehive stuck at the end of a row of\ntrees), it caused him a little surprise to find the gate wide open,\nand nobody there. But he thought that, as it was Sunday, perhaps the\nlodge-people were gone for a holiday; and so he trudged onward, and\nmet no one to throw any light upon anything.\n\nIn this way he came to the door at last, with the fine old porch of\nPurbeck stone heavily overhanging it, and the long wings of the house\nstretched out, with empty windows either way. Hardenow rang and\nknocked, and then set to and knocked and rang again; and then sat down\non a stone balustrade; and then jumped up with just vigour renewed,\nand pushed and pulled, and in every way worked to the utmost degree of\ncapacity everything that had ever been gifted with any power of\nconducting sound.\n\nNobody answered. The sound of his energy went into places far away,\nand echoed there, and then from stony corners came back to him. He\ntraced the whole range of the windows and caught no sign of any life\ninside them. At last, he pushed the great door, and lo! there was\nnothing to resist his thrust, except its sullen weight.\n\nWhen Hardenow stood in the old-fashioned hall, which was not at all\n\"baronial,\" he found himself getting into such a fright that he had a\ngreat mind to go away again. If there had only been anybody with\nhim--however inferior in \"mental power\"--he might have been able to\nrefresh himself by demonstrating something, and then have marched on\nto the practical proof. But now he was all by himself, in strange and\nunaccountable loneliness. The sense of his condition perhaps induced\nhim to set to and shout. The silence was so oppressive, that the sound\nof his own voice almost alarmed him by its audacity. So, after\nshouting \"Russel!\" thrice, he stopped, and listened, and heard nothing\nexcept that cold and shuddering ring, as of hardware in frosty\nweather, which stone and plaster and timber give when deserted by\ntheir lords--mankind.\n\nKnowing pretty well all the chief rooms of the house, Hardenow\nresolved to go and see if they were locked; and grasping his black\nholly-stick for self-defence, he made for the dining-room. The door\nwas wide open; the cloth on the table, with knives and forks and\nglasses placed, as if for a small dinner-party; but the only guest\nvisible was a long-legged spider, with a sound and healthy appetite,\nwho had come down to dine from the oak beams overhead, and was sitting\nin his web between a claret bottle and a cruet-stand, ready to receive\nwith a cordial clasp any eligible visitor.\n\nHardenow tasted the water in a jug, and found it quite stale and\nnasty; then he opened a napkin, and the bread inside it was dry and\nhard as biscuit. Then he saw with still further surprise that the\nwindows were open to their utmost extent, and the basket of plate was\non the sideboard.\n\n\"My old friend Russel, my dear old fellow!\" he cried with his hand on\nhis heart where lurked disease as yet unsuspected, \"what strange\nmisfortune has befallen you? No wonder my letter was left unanswered.\nPerhaps the dear fellow is now being buried, and every one gone to his\nfuneral. But no; if it were so, these things would not be thus. The\nfuneral feast is a grand institution. Everything would be fresh and\nlively, and five leaves put into the dinner-table.\" With this true\nreflection, he left the room to seek the solution elsewhere.\n\nHe failed, however, to find it in any of the downstair sitting-rooms.\nThen he went even into the kitchen, thinking the liberty allowable\nunder such conditions. The grate was cold and the table bare; on the\none lay a drift of soot, on the other a level deposit of dust, with a\nfew grimy implements to distribute it.\n\nHardenow made up his mind for the worst. He was not addicted to\nfiction (as haply was indicated by his good degree), but he could not\nhelp recalling certain eastern and even classic tales; and if he had\ncome upon all the household sitting in native marble, or from the\nwaistband downward turned into fish, or logs, or dragons, he might\nhave been partly surprised, but must have been wholly thankful for the\nexplanation. Failing however to discover this, and being resolved to\ngo through with the matter, the tutor of Brasenose mounted the black\noak staircase of this enchanted house. At the head of the stairs was a\nwide, low passage, leading right and left from a balustraded gallery.\nThe young man chose first the passage to the right, and tightening his\ngrip of the stick, strode on.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\nTHE FIRE-BELL.\n\n\nThe doors of the rooms on either side were not only open but fastened\nback; the sashes of the windows were all thrown up; and the rain,\nwhich had followed when the east wind fell, had entered and made\npuddles on the sills inside. Such a draught of air rushed down the\npassage that Hardenow's lengthy skirts flickered out, in the orthodox\nfashion, behind him.\n\nAt the end of this passage he came to a small alcove, fenced off with\na loose white curtain, shaking and jerking itself in the wind. He put\nthis aside with his stick; and two doorways, leading into separate\nrooms, but with no doors in them, faced him. Something told him that\nboth these rooms held human life, or human death.\n\nFirst he looked in at the one on the left. He expected to see lonely\ndeath; perhaps corruption; or he knew not what. His nerves were strung\nor unstrung (whichever is the medical way of putting it) to such a\ndegree that he wholly forgot, or entirely put by, everything, except\nhis own absorbing sense of his duty, as a man in holy orders. This\nduty had never been practised yet in any serious way, because he had\nnever been able to afford it. It costs so much more money than it\nbrings in. However, in the midst of more lucrative work, he had felt\nthat he was sacred to it--rich or poor--and he often had a special\nhankering after it. This leaning towards the cure of souls had a good\nchance now of being gratified.\n\nIn the room on the left hand he saw a little bed, laid at the foot of\na fat four-poster, which with carved mouths grinned at it; and on this\nlittle bed of white (without curtain, or trimming, or tester), lay a\nlady, or a lady's body, cast down recklessly, in sleep or death, with\nthe face entirely covered by a silvery cloud of hair. From the manner\nin which one arm was bent, Hardenow thought that the lady lived. There\nwas nothing else to show it. Being a young man, a gentleman also, he\nhung back and trembled back from entering that room.\n\nWithout any power to \"revolve things well,\" as he always directed his\npupils to do, Hardenow stepped to the other doorway, and silently\nsettled his gaze inside. His eyes were so worried that he could not\ntrust them, until he had time to consider what they told.\n\nThey told him a tale even stranger than that which had grown upon him\nfor an hour now, and passed from a void alarm into a terror; they\nshowed him the loveliest girl--according to their rendering--that ever\nthey had rested on till now; a maiden sitting in a low chair reading,\nsilently sometimes, and sometimes in a whisper, according to some\nsignal, perhaps, of which he saw no sign. There was no other person in\nthe room, so far as he could see; and he strained his eyes with\nextreme anxiety to make out that.\n\nThe Rev. Thomas Hardenow knew (as clearly as his keen perception ever\nhad brought any knowledge home) that he was not discharging the\nfunctions now--unless they were too catholic--of the sacerdotal\noffice, in watching a young woman through a doorway, without either\nleave or notice. But though he must have been aware of this, it\nscarcely seemed now to occur to him; or whether it did, or did not, he\nwent on in the same manner gazing.\n\nThe girl could not see him; it was not fair play. The width of great\nwindows, for instance, kept up such a rattling of blinds, and such\nflapping of cords, and even the floor was so strewn with herbs (for\nthe sake of their aroma), that anybody might quite come close to\nanybody who had cast away fear (in the vast despair of prostration),\nwithout any sense of approach until perhaps hand was laid upon\nshoulder. Hardenow took no more advantage of these things than about\nhalf a minute. In that half-minute, however, his outward faculties\n(being all alive with fear) rendered to his inward and endiathetic\norgans a picture, a schema, or a plasm--the proper word may be left to\nhim--such as would remain inside, at least while the mind abode there.\n\nThe sound of low, laborious breath pervaded the sick room now and\nthen, between the creaking noises and the sighing of the wind. In\nspite of all draughts, the air was heavy with the scent of herbs\nstrewn broadcast, to prevent infection--tansy, wormwood, rue, and\nsage, burnt lavender and rosemary. The use of acids in malignant\nfevers was at that time much in vogue, and saucers of vinegar and\nverjuice, steeped lemon-peel, and such like, as well as dozens of\nmedicine bottles, stood upon little tables. Still Hardenow could not\nsee the patient; only by following the glance of the reader could he\ndiscover the direction. It was the girl herself, however, on whom his\nwondering eyes were bent. At first he seemed to know her face, and\nthen he was sure that he must have been wrong. The sense of doing\ngood, and the wonderful influence of pity, had changed the face of a\npretty girl into that of a beautiful woman. Hardenow banished his\nfirst idea, and wondered what strange young lady this could be.\n\nAlthough she was reading aloud, and doing it not so very badly, it was\nplain enough that she expected no one to listen to her. The sound of\nher voice, perhaps, was soothing to some one who understood no words;\nas people (in some of the many unknown conditions of brain) have been\nsoothed and recovered by a thread of waterfall broken with a\nwalking-stick. At any rate, she read on, and her reading fell like\ndecent poetry.\n\nHardenow scarcely knew what he ought to do. He did not like to go\nforward; and it was a mean thing to go backward, rendering no help,\nwhen help seemed wanted so extremely. He peeped back into the other\nroom; and there was the lady with the fine white hair, sleeping as\nsoundly as a weary top driven into dreaming by extreme activity of\nblows.\n\nNothing less than a fine idea could have delivered Hardenow from this\nbad situation. It was suddenly borne in upon his mind that the house\nhad a rare old fire-bell, a relic of nobler ages, hanging from a bar\nin a little open cot, scarcely big enough for a hen-roost; and Russel\nhad shown him one day, with a laugh, the corner in which the rope\nhung. There certainly could be but very little chance of doing harm by\nringing it; what could be worse than the present state of things? Some\ngood Samaritan might come. No Levite was left to be driven away.\n\nFor Hardenow understood the situation now. The meaning of a very short\nparagraph in the Oxford paper of Saturday, which he had glanced at and\ncast by, came distinctly home to him. The careful editor had omitted\nname of person and of place, but had made his report quite clear to\nthose who held a key to the reference. \"How very dull-witted now I\nmust be!\" cried the poor young fellow in his lonely trouble. \"I ought\nto have known it. But we never know the clearest things until too\nlate.\" It was not only for the sake of acquitting himself of an\nawkward matter, but also in the hope of doing good to the few left\ndesolate, that Hardenow moved forth his legs, from the windy white\ncurtain away again.\n\nHe went down the passage at a very great pace, as nearly akin to a run\nas the practice of long steady walks permitted; and then at the head\nof the staircase he turned, and remembered a quiet little corner.\nHere, in an out-of-the-way recess, the rope of the alarm-bell hung;\nand he saw it, even in that niche, moving to and fro with the\nuniversal draught. Hardenow seized it, and rang such a peal as the old\nbell had never given tongue to before. The bell was a large one, sound\nand clear; and the call must have startled the neighbourhood for a\nmile, if it could be startled.\n\n\"Really, I do believe I have roused somebody at last!\" exclaimed the\nringer, as he looked through a window commanding the road to the\nhouse, and saw a man on horse-back coming. \"But, surely, unless he\nsprang out of the ground, he must have been coming before I began.\"\n\nIn this strange loneliness, almost any visitor would be welcome; and\nHardenow ran towards the top of the stairs to see who it was, and to\nmeet him. But here, as he turned the corner of the balustraded\ngallery, a scared and hurrying young woman, almost ran into his arms.\n\n\"Oh, what is it?\" she cried, drawing back, and blushing to a deeper\ncolour than well-extracted blood can show; \"there is no funeral yet!\nHe is not dead! Who is ringing the bell so? It has startled even him,\nand will either kill or save him! Kill him, it will kill him, I am\nalmost sure!\"\n\n\"Esther--Miss Cripps--what a fool I am! I never thought of that--I did\nnot know--how could I tell? I am all in the dark! Is it Russel\nOvershute?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Hardenow. Everybody knows it. Every one has taken good care\nto run away. Even the doctors will come no more! They say it is\nhopeless; and they might only infect their other patients. I fear that\nhis mother must die too! She has taken the fever in a milder form; but\nwalk she will, while walk she can. And at her time of life it is such\na chance. But I cannot stop one moment!\"\n\n\"And at your time of life is it nothing, Esther? You seem to think of\neverybody but yourself. Is this fair to your own hearth and home?\"\n\nWhile he was speaking he looked at her eyes; and her eyes were filling\nwith deep tears--a dangerous process to contemplate.\n\n\"Oh, no, there is no fear of that,\" she answered misunderstanding him;\n\"I shall take good care not to go home until I am quite sure that\nthere is no risk.\"\n\n\"That is not what I mean. I mean supposing you yourself should catch\nit.\"\n\n\"If I do, they will let me stay here, I am sure. But I have no fear of\nit. The hand that led me here will lead me back again. But you ought\nnot to be here. I am quite forgetting you.\"\n\nHardenow looked at her with admiration warmer than he could put into\nwords. She had been thinking of him throughout. She thought of every\none except herself. Even in the moment of first surprise she had drawn\naway so that she stood to leeward; and while they were speaking she\ntook good care that the current of wind passed from him to her. Also\nin one hand she carried a little chafing-dish producing lively\nfumigation.\n\n\"Now, if you please, I must go back to him. Nothing would move him; he\nlay for hours, as a log lies on a stone. I could not have knowledge\nwhether he was living, only for his breathing sometimes like a moan.\nThe sound of the bell seemed to call him to life, for he thought it\nwas his own funeral. His mother is with him; worn out as she is, the\nlady awoke at his rambling. She sent me to find out the meaning. Now,\nsir, please to go back round the corner; the shivering wind comes down\nthe passage.\"\n\nHardenow was not such a coward as to obey her orders. He even wanted\nto shake hands with her, as in her girlhood he used to do, when he had\nfrightened this little pupil with too much emendation. But Esther\ncurtsied at a distance, and started away--until her retreat was cut\noff very suddenly.\n\n\"Why, ho girl! Ho girl; and young man in the corner! What is the\nmeaning of all this? I have come to see things righted; my name is\nWorth Oglander. I find this here old house silent as a grave, and you\ntwo looking like a brace of robbers! Young woman!--young woman!--why,\nbless me now, if it isn't our own Etty Cripps! I did believe, and I\nwould believe, but for knowing of your family, Etty, and your brother\nCripps the Carrier, that here you are for the purpose of setting this\nold mansion afire!\"\n\nEsther, having been hard set to sustain what had happened already (as\nwell as unblest with a wink of sleep since Friday night), was now\nunable to assert her dignity. She simply leaned against the wall, and\ngently blew into the embers of her disinfecting stuff. She knew that\nthe Squire might kill himself, after all his weeks of confinement, by\ncoming over here, in this rash manner, and working himself up so. But\nit was not her place to say a word; even if she could say it.\n\n\"Mr. Oglander,\" said Hardenow, coming forward and offering his hand,\nwhile Esther looked at them from beneath a cloud of smoke, \"I know\nyour name better than you know mine. You happened to be on the\ncontinent when I was staying in your village. My name is Thomas\nHardenow. I am a priest of the Anglican Church, and have no intention\nof setting anything on fire.\"\n\n\"Lor' bless me! Lord bless me! Are you the young fellow that turned\nhalf the heads of Beckley, and made the Oxford examiners all tumble\nback, like dead herrings with their jaws down? Cripps was in the\nschools, and he told me all about it. And you were a friend of poor\nOvershute. I am proud to make your acquaintance, sir.\"\n\n\"Master Cripps has inverted the story, I fear,\" Hardenow answered,\nwith a glance at Esther; while he could not, without rudeness, get his\nhand out of the ancient Squire's (which clung to another, in this weak\ntime, as heartily as it used to do); \"the examiners made a dry herring\nof me. But I am very glad to see you, sir; I have heard of--at least,\nI mean, I feared--that you were in weak health almost.\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it! I was fool enough--or rather I should say, my\nsister--to have a lot of doctors down; fellows worth their weight in\ngold, or at any rate in brass, every day of their own blessed lives;\nand yet with that temptation even, they cannot lengthen their own\ndays. Of that I will tell you some other time. They kept me indoors,\nand they drenched me with physic--this, that, and the other. God bless\nyou, sir, this hour of the air, with my own old good mare under me,\nhas done me more good--but my head goes round; just a little; not\nanything to notice. Etty, my dear, don't you be afraid.\"\n\nWith these words the Squire sank down on the floor, not through any\nkind of fit, or even loss of consciousness; but merely because his\nfine old legs (being quite out of practice for so many weeks) had\nfound it a little more than they could do to keep themselves firm in\nthe stirrups, and then carry their master up slippery stairs, and\nafter that have to support a good deal of excitement among the trunk\nparts.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\nTHROW PHYSIC TO THE DOGS.\n\n\n\"In all my life I never knew such a very extraordinary thing,\" said\nSquire Oglander on the following Tuesday, to his old friend Dr.\nSplinters. \"Why, look you here, he was wholly given up by the very\nfirst man in London--that the poor young fellow was--can you deny\nthat, Splinters?\"\n\n\"Well, between you and me and the door-post, Squire,\" answered his\nlearned visitor, \"I am not quite so sure that Sir Anthony is quite the\nrose and crown of the profession. He may be a great Court card and all\nthat, and the rage with all the nobility; but for all that, Squire,\nthere are good men in comparatively obscure positions; men who have\ndevoted their lives to science from the purest motives; modest men,\nsir, who are thankful to pocket their poor guinea; men who would scorn\nany handle to their name or any shabby interloping; sir, I say there\nare d----d good men----\"\n\n\"But even you, Splinters, come now--even you gave him up--unless we\nare wholly misinformed.\"\n\n\"Not at all. That was quite a mistake. The fact was simply this. When\nSir Anthony pronounced his opinion at our last consultation, it was\nnot my place to contradict him--we never do that with a London\nman--but I ventured in my own mind to differ even from our brilliant\nlight, sir. For I said to myself, 'first see the effect of the\nremedial agent which I myself, in the absence of this Londoner, have\nexhibited.' I was suddenly called away to retrieve a case of shocking\nblundering by a quack at Iffley. That was why you did not see me,\nSquire.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, to be sure! I quite see now,\" answered Mr. Oglander, with a\nquiet internal wink. \"And when you came you found the most wonderful\neffect from your remedial agent.\"\n\n\"That I did. Something I could scarcely have believed. Soft sweet\nsleep, a genial perspiration, an equable pulse, nice gentle\nbreathing--the very conditions of hygiene which Sir Anthony's efforts\ncould never produce. Why, my good sir, in all the records of the\ntherapeutic art, there is no example of such rapid efficacy. I think\nit will henceforth be acknowledged that Dr. Splinters knows what he is\nabout. My dear friend, you know that there is nothing I dislike so\nmuch as the appearance of vaunting. If I had only condescended to\nthat, nobody could have stopped me, sir. But no, Squire, no; I have\nalways been the same; and I have not an enemy, except myself.\"\n\n\"You may say more than that, sir--a great deal more than that. You may\nsay that you have many friends, doctor, who admire your great\nabilities. But as to Russel Overshute, if the poor fellow does come\nround the general belief will be that he must thank the fire-bell.\"\n\n\"The fire-bell! My dear sir, in this age of advanced\ntherapeutics--Oglander, you must know better than to listen to that\nlow story!\"\n\n\"Splinters, I know that foolish tales are told about almost\neverything. But being there myself, I thought there might be something\nin it.\"\n\n\"Nothing whatever! I never heard such nonsense! I was quite angry with\nEsther Cripps. What can chits of girls know? They must have their\nchatter.\"\n\n\"I suppose they must,\" said the Squire sadly, thinking of his own dear\nGrace; \"still they may be right sometimes. At any rate, doctor, the\nfire-bell did as much good as your medicine did. Take another glass of\nwine. I would not hurt your feelings for the world, my dear old\nfriend.\"\n\n\"Oglander,\" answered Dr. Splinters, putting up his great gold\nspectacles, so that beneath them he might see--for he never could see\nthrough them--how to pour out his fine glass of port, \"Oglander, you\nhave something or other that you are keeping in the background.\nSquire, whatever it is, out with it. Between you and me, sir, there\nshould be nothing but downright yes or no, Mr. Oglander. Downright yes\nor no, sir.\"\n\n\"Of course, of course,\" said the Squire, relapsing into some quiet\nmood again; \"that was how I always liked it. Splinters, you must know\nI did. And I never meant anything against it, by bringing this here\nlittle bottle back. It may have saved the poor boy's life; and of\ncourse it did, if you say so. But the seal is still on the cork, and\nthe stuff all there; so it may do good again. I dare say the good came\nthrough the glass; you doctors have such devices!\" Mr. Oglander took a\nsmall square bottle from his inner peculiar pocket, and gave it to the\ndoctor, so as not to disturb his wine-glass.\n\n\"How the deuce did you get hold of this?\" cried Splinters, being an\nangry man when taken without notice; \"this is some of that girl's\ninsolent tricks!--I call her an insolent and wicked girl!\"\n\n\"I call her a good and a brave girl!--the very best girl in Beckley,\nsince--but, my dear Splinters, you must not be vexed. She told me that\nyou had the greatest faith in this last idea of yours; and it struck\nme at once that you might wish to try it in some other case; and so I\nbrought it. You see it has not been opened.\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter whether it was used or not,\" cried Dr. Splinters\nvehemently; \"there is the stuff, sir; and here is the result! Am I to\nunderstand, sir, that you deny the existence of Providence?\"\n\n\"Far be such a thing from me!\" the Squire replied, with a little\nindignation at such an idea; and then, remembering that Splinters was\nhis guest, he changed the subject. \"How could I help having faith in\nthe Lord, when I see His care made manifest? Why, look at me,\nSplinters; I am twice the man I was last Sunday morning! Why is it so?\nWhy, because it pleased a gracious Providence to make it my duty, as a\nman, to ride!--to ride, sir, a very considerable distance, on a mare\nwho had been eating her head off. Every one vowed that I never could\ndo it; and my good housekeeper locked me in; and when I unscrewed the\nlock, she sent two men after me, to pick me up. Very good, sir; here I\nam, enjoying my glass of port, with the full intention of having\nanother. Yesterday I sent to our road-contractor for a three-headed\nand double-handed hammer; and Kale smashed up, in about two minutes,\nthree hundred and twenty medicine bottles! They will come in for the\ntop of the orchard wall.\"\n\n\"Squire,\" answered Splinters, with a twinkling eye, \"it is not at all\nimprobable that you may be right. There are some constitutions so\nperverse that to exhibit the best remedial agent is just the same\nthing as to reason with a pig. But it is high time for me to be\njogging on my road. If Beckley and Shotover discard my extremely\nhumble services, there are other places in the world, sir, besides\nBeckley and Shotover.\"\n\n\"There is no other place in the world for you, except Beckley, for\nsome hours, my friend. We have known one another long enough, to allow\nfor one another now. I would have arranged a rubber for you--but,\nbut--well, you know what I mean--sadly selfish; but I cannot help it.\"\n\nThe doctor, though vain and irritable, was easily touched with\nsoftness. He thought of all his many children, and of the long pain he\nhad felt at losing one out of a dozen; then without process of thought\nhe felt for the loss of one; where one was all.\n\n\"Oglander, you need not say another word,\" he answered, putting forth\nhis hand, to squeeze any trifle away between them. \"A rubber in winter\nis all very well; and so it is in summer, at the proper time, but on a\nmagnificent spring evening, to watch the sunset between one's cards is\nnot--I mean that it is very nice indeed, but still it ought scarcely\nto be done, when you can help it. Now, I will just take the leastest\nlittle drop of your grand Cura\u00c3\u00a7oa before I smoke; and then if you have\none of those old Manillas, I am your man for a stroll in the garden.\"\n\nTo go into a garden in good weather soothes the temper. The freedom of\ngetting out of doors is a gracious joy to begin with; and when the\nfirst blush of that is past, without any trouble there come forward so\nmany things to be looked at. Even since yesterday--if we had the good\nhap to see them yesterday--many thousand of little things have spent\nthe time in changing. Even with the weather scarcely different from\nyesterday's--though differ it must in some small points, when in its\nmost consistent mood--even with no man to come and dig, and fork, and\nroll, and by all human devices harass; and even without any children\ndancing, plucking, pulling, trampling, and enjoying their blessed\nlittle hearts, as freely as any flower does; yet in the absence of all\nthose local contributions towards variety, variety there will be for\nall who have the time to look for it.\n\nThe most observant and delightful poets of the present age, instead of\nbeing masters of nature, prefer to be nature's masters. Having\nobtained this power they use it with such diligence and spirit, that\nthey make the peach and the apple bloom together, and the plum keep\nthe kalendar of the lilac. Once in a way, such a thing does almost\nhappen (without the poet's aid)--that is to say, when a long cold\nwinter is broken by a genial outburst waking every dormant life; and\nafter that, a repressive chill returns, and lasts to the May month. At\nsuch a time, when hope deferred springs anew as hope assured, and fear\nbreaks into fluttering joy, and faith moves steadily into growth, then\na truly poetic confusion arises in the works of earth.\n\nIn such a state of things the squire and the doctor walked to and fro\nin the garden; the Squire still looking very pale and feeble, but with\nthe help of his favourite spud, managing to get along, and to enjoy\nthe evening. The blush of the peach wall was not over, and yet the\ntrellised apple-tree was softly unsheathing puckered buds, all in\nlittle clusters pointed like rosettes of coral. The petals of the\nplum-bloom still were hovering with their edges brown, although in a\ncorner near a chimney, positively a lilac-bush was thrusting forth\nthose livid jags which lift and curve themselves so swiftly into\nplumes of beauty. The two good gentlemen were surprised; each wanted\nparticularly to hear what the other thought of it; but neither would\ndeign to ask; and either feared to speak his thoughts, for fear of\ngiving the other an advantage. Because they were rival gardeners; and\nso they avoided the subject.\n\n\"This is the very first cigar,\" said the Squire, as they turned at the\nend of the peach wall, over against a young Grosse Mignonne,\nbeautifully trained on the Seymour system, and bright with the central\nglow of pistil, although the petals were dropping--\"my very first\ncigar, since that--you know what I mean, of course--since I have cared\nwhether I were in my garden, or in my grave. But the Lord supports me.\nProvidence is good; or how could I be smoking this cigar?\"\n\n\"You must not learn to look at things in that way,\" Dr. Splinters\nanswered; \"Oglander, you must learn to know better. You are in an\nuncomfortable frame of mind, or you would not have flouted me with\nthat bottle, after all our friendship. Why, bless me! Only look around\nyou. Badly pruned as your trees are, what a picture there is of\nlargeness!\"\n\n\"Yes, Splinters, more than you could find in yours; which you amputate\ninto a doctor's bamboo. But now, perhaps, you may doubt it, Splinters,\nbecause your trees are so very poor--but I have not felt any pride at\nall, any pride at all, in one of them. What is the good of lovely\ntrees, with only one's self to enjoy them?\"\n\n\"Now, Oglander, there you are again! How often must I tell you? Your\npoor little Gracie is gone, of course; and a nice little thing she\nwas, to be sure. But here you are again as well as ever, or at any\nrate as positive. I judge a man's state of health very much by his\npowers of contradiction. And yours are first-rate. Go to, go to! You\nare equal to another wife. Take a young one, and have more Gracies.\"\n\n\"Splinters, do you know what I should do,\" Mr. Oglander answered, with\nhis spud uplifted, \"if my powers were such as you suppose--because I\nsmashed your bottles?\"\n\n\"Yes, I dare say you would knock me down, and never beg my pardon till\nthe wedding breakfast.\"\n\n\"You are right in the first part; but wrong in the second. Oh, doctor,\nis there no one able to share the simplest thoughts we have?\"\n\n\"To minister to a mind diseased? First, he must have his own mind\ndiseased; as all the blessed poets have. But look! The green fly--who\nwould ever believe it, after our Siberian winter? The aphis is hatched\nin your young peach-shoots before they have made even half a joint.\nThat comes of your Seymour system.\"\n\n\"Ridiculous!\" answered the Squire; \"but never mind! What matter now?\nThen you really do think, Splinters--now, as an old friend, try to\ntell me--in pure sincerity, do you think that I have altogether lost\nmy Gracie?\"\n\n\"Oglander, no! I can truly say no. We are all good Christians, I\nshould hope. She is not lost, but gone before.\"\n\n\"But, my dear fellow, will you never understand that she ought to\nhave gone, long after? It is all very well for you, who have got\nsome baker's dozen of little ones, and lost only one in the\nmeasles--forgive me, I know it was hard upon you--I say things that I\nshould not say--but if you could only bring your mind--however, I\ndaresay you have tried to do it; and what right have I to ask you?\nSplinters, I know I am puzzle-headed; and many people think me worse\nthan that. But you have the sense to understand me, because for many\nyears you have been acquainted with my constitution. Now, Splinters,\ntell me, in three words--shall I live to see my Gracie?\"\n\n\"That you will, Squire; and to see her married; and to dance on your\nlap her children!\" So said Dr. Splinters, fearing what might happen,\nif he did not say it.\n\n\"Only to see her. That is all I want. And to have her in my arms once\nmore. And to hear her tell me, with her own true tongue, that she\nnever ran away from me. After that I shall be ready for my coffin, and\nknow that the Lord has ordered it. Here comes more of your dust into\nmy eyes! Splinters, will you never learn how to knock your ash off?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\nCRIPPS ON CELIBACY.\n\n\nWhatever might or may be said by any number of most able and homicidal\nphysicians, Russel Overshute will believe, as long as he draws breath\nof life, that by the grace of the Lord he owes that privilege to the\nfire-bell. In this belief he has always been most strongly supported\nby Esther Cripps, who perhaps was the first to suggest the idea; for\nhe at that time must have failed to know a fire-bell from a\nwater-bucket. The doctors had left him, through no fear for their own\nlives, but in despair of his. There was far less risk of infection now\nthan in the earlier stages. No sooner, however, did the household find\nout that the medical men had abandoned the case, than panic seized\ntheir gallant hearts, and with one accord they ran away. From Saturday\nmorning till Saturday night, when Esther came from Beckley, there was\nnobody left to watch and soothe the poor despairing misery, except the\nhelpless and worn-out mother.\n\nOne thing is certain (and even the doctors, with their usual\nsharpness, found it wise to acknowledge this)--both Mr. Overshute and\nhis mother must have been dead bodies with little hope of Christian\nburial, if that brave girl had not set forth (without any one even\nasking her) on the Saturday night to help them. Mrs. Overshute had\nquite thrown up all hope of everything--save the mercy of God in a\nbetter world, and His justice upon her enemies--when quite in the dark\nthis young girl came, while she was lying down on her back, and\ncurtsied, and asked her pleasure.\n\nIf Esther had not curtsied, perhaps Mrs. Overshute in that state of\nmind would have taken her for an angel; though Etty's bonnet, made by\nherself, was not at all angelical. But she knew her for one of the\nlower orders (who bend knee instead of neck), and belonging herself to\na fine old race, she rallied her last energies with a power of\ncondescension.\n\nHowever, these are medical, physical, social, economical, and perhaps\neven psychological questions--wherein what remains except perpetual\ninquiry? Enough is to say that Russell Overshute, having long had a\nringing in his ears, was rung out of that, and rung back to life, by\nthe lively peal of the fire-bell. And ever since that, whenever he is\nill--though it be only a little touch of gout--he immediately sends a\ngood corpulent man to lay hold of the rope and swing to it. These\nthings are of later date. For the present, this young man (although he\ncertainly had turned the corner) lay still in a very precarious state,\nwith a feeble mother to pray for him. Mrs. Overshute held that same\nvile fever, but in a very different form, as at her time of life was\nnatural. With her it was intermittent, low, stealthy, and undermining.\nIt never affected her brain, or drove her into furious calenture, but\nrooted slowly inward, preying on her life quite leisurely. Their cases\ndiffered, as a knock-down blow differs from a quiet grasp.\n\nBut though the house lay still in sadness, loneliness, and dull\nsuspense, and though the doctors, having abandoned the case, had the\nmanners not to come again, still from day to day there was some little\ngrowth of liveliness. Hardenow came almost daily, having put his class\nof striders under a deputy six-leaguer; the Squire also might be\nexpected, whenever Mother Hookham let him out; and even Zacchary\nCripps renewed an old washing in that direction. He came, with the\nhoops of his cart taken out, because of the beautiful weather, and\nfour good baskets of clothes for to wash (whose wearers were happy\nenough to have no idea where their \"things\" were), and quite at the\ncentre of his gravity--as felt by himself, and endorsed by\nDobbin--anybody getting up with a curious eye might well have beheld a\nphenomenon. For here stood a very large pickling tub, with the cover\ntaken off for the sake of air; around the sides was salted pork--hands\nand springs, and belly pieces--and in the middle was a good-sized\nbarrel of the then existent native.\n\n\"Veed 'un,\" cried Cripps, with his coat-tails up, while tugging at his\nheavy tub; \"veed 'un, Etty, whatsomever 'ee do. Salt is the main thing\nfor 'un now. I have heerd tell that they burns away every bit of the\nsalt inside 'em, in these here bouts of fever. If 'ee can replace 'un,\nlaife comes round; or else they goes off, like the snuff of a candle.\nBless me, I must be getting fevery myzell, or never should have a job\nto lift this here. Now the quality of this pickle you know well, for\nthe most part fell on your shoulders. Home-bred, home-born, home-fed,\nhome-slaughtered, and home-salted--that's what I calls pork!\"\n\n\"Yes, to be sure, Zak,\" Etty answered, laying her hand to the tub upon\nthe shaft-stock, while Dobbin wagged his tail at her; \"but what have\nyou got in this very small cask, sitting in the middle of all the\nbrine?\"\n\n\"Why, you know, Etty, you must have seed me bring 'em for all the\ngreat folk about Christmas-tide. Oysters, as lives in the sea, and\nmust be salt inside of their barryels. So I clapped them in here for a\nfresh smack of it, and uncommonly strengthening things they be if you\ntake them with enow of treble X. Likely his worship will be too weak\nto keep them down with the covers on yet, as is the proper way, they\ntell me; so you best way take out the hearts and give him.\"\n\n\"Oh, brother,\" cried Esther, remembering suddenly, \"I ought not to be\ntalking to you like this. Whatever could I be thinking of? What would\nthe people at Beckley say? They would fear to come nigh you for a\nmonth, Zak, and your business would be ruined. Now, do jog on, you and\ndear old Dobbin. How well I knew the sound of his old feet. I can't\ngive you the fever, Dobbin, can I?\"\n\nWith this perhaps incorrect or, at any rate, unestablished hypothesis,\nshe gave the old horse a lingering kiss just below his blinkers, in\nreturn for which he jerked off some froth on the sleeve of her dress,\nand shook himself; while the Carrier, having discharged his cargo,\nsmote himself with both arms, from habit rather than necessity, and\napproached his young sister for his usual hearty smack.\n\n\"No, Zak, no,\" she cried, running up the steps, \"I have no fear of\ntaking it myself whatever; but if I should happen to give it to you, I\nnever should get over it.\"\n\n\"Well, well, little un, the Lord knows best,\" Master Cripps answered,\nwithout repining too bitterly at this arrangement; \"but ating of my\nvictuals lonesome is worse than having no salt to them; you better\ncome home pretty soon, my dear, or somehow or other there might happen\nto be some one over in the corner, 'longside of our best frying-pan.\"\n\nEtty had heard this threat so often, that now she only laughed at it.\nBut instead of laughing, she blushed most sadly at her brother's\nparting words:\n\n\"God bless you, Etty, for a brave good girl; and speed you home to\nBeckley. You want more sleep of nights, my dear; your cheeks are\ngetting like a pillow-case. But excoose my mentioning of one thing,\nEtty; I be like a father to 'ee; don't 'ee have more than you can help\nto say to the great scholard, Master Hardenow.\"\n\nCripps was a gentleman, in an inner kind of way, and he took good care\nto be getting up his shaft (with his stiff knee stiffer than ever,\nfrom the long frost of last winter) while he discharged his duty, as\nhe thought it, at, as well as to, his sister. Then he deposited the\npolished part of his breeches on the driving-board, and brought his\n\"game-leg\" into the right stick-out, and with his usual deliberation\nstarted--nay, that is too strong a word--persuaded into progress his\ncongenial and deliberate horse. Neither of them hurried on a\nwashing-day, any more than they hurried upon any other day.\n\nZacchary knew that his sister was--as Master Phil Hiss had said of\nher--\"a most terrible hand at blushing;\" and she could not bear to be\nlooked at in this electric aurora of maidenhood; and therefore he\nmanaged to be a long way off, ere even he turned both head and hand,\nto deliver last issue of \"God bless you!\"\n\nFull of confusion about herself, and clearness of duty for other\npeople, Esther Cripps ran in, to see to the many things now depending\nupon her. There were now three servants in the house, gathered from\ngood stuff around, but wholly void of any wit, to make up for want of\nexperience. Esther had no experience either, but she possessed good\nstore of sense, and quickness, and kind energy. Whatever she thought\nof her brother's warning, she would think of afterwards. For the\npresent she must do her best concerning other people; and Mrs.\nOvershute needed now more nursing than her son did.\n\nZacchary Cripps, at the very first distance at which he was sure of\nnot being seen, began to shake his head, and shook it, in a resolutely\nreflective way, for nearly three quarters of a mile. The trees above\nhim were alive with beauty, alike of sight, and sound, and scent; and\nthe Carrier made up his mind for a pipe, to enable him to consider\nthings. His custom was not to smoke, except when good occasion\noffered; and he tried to have no contempt for carriers (of inferior\nfamily) who could not deliver a side of bacon without smoking it over\nagain almost. Zacchary Cripps, like all good men, stood up for the\ndignity of his work. Strictly meditating thus, he saw a slight figure\napproaching with a rapid swing, and presently met Mr. Hardenow.\n\nThe fellow and tutor of Brazenose, at the sight of Cripps and the\nwell-known cart, stopped short to ask how things were going on at the\nhouse on the hill above them. The Carrier answered that it would be\nmany a long day, he was afraid, ere his worship could get about again,\nand that he ought to be kept very quiet, and those would be his best\nfriends now who had the least to say to him. Also he was told that the\npoor old lady would find it as much as her life was worth, if she was\ninterrupted or terrified now.\n\n\"But, my good Cripps,\" answered Hardenow, \"I am not going either to\ninterrupt or terrify them. All I desire is to have a little talk with\nyour good and intelligent sister.\"\n\nPoor Zacchary felt that his own tactics thus were turned against him;\nand, after a little stammering and heightened glow of countenance, he\nbetook himself to his more usual course--that of plain out-speaking.\nBut first he got down from his driving-board that he might not fail in\ndue respect to a gentleman and clergyman. Master Cripps had no liking\nat all for the duty which he felt bound to take in hand. He would\nrather have a row with three turnpike-men than presume to speak to a\ngentleman; therefore his bow-leg seemed to twitch him at the knee, as\nhe led Hardenow aside into a quiet gateway; but his eyes were firm and\nhis manner grave and steadfast as he began to speak.\n\n\"Mr. Hardenow, now I must ask your pardon, for a few words as I want\nto say. You are a gentleman, of course, and a very learned scholar;\nand I be nothing but a common carrier--a 'carrier for hire,' they\ncalls me in the law, when they comes upon me for damages. Howsoever, I\nhas to do my part off the road as well as on it, sir; and my dooty to\nthem of my own household comes next to my dooty to God and myzell. You\nare a good man, I know, and a kind one, and would not, beknown to\nyourself, harm any one. It would go to your heart, I believe, Mr.\nHardenow, from what I seed of you, when you was quite a lad, if anyhow\nyou was to be art or part in bringing unhappiness of mind to any that\nhad trusted you.\"\n\n\"I should hope so, Cripps. I have some idea of what you mean, but can\nhardly think--at any rate, speak more plainly.\"\n\n\"Well then, sir, I means all about your goings on with our little\nEtty, or, at any rate, her goings on with you, which cometh to the\nsame thing in the end, so far as I be acquaint of it. You might think,\nif you was not told distinkly to the contrairy, that having no\nbusiness to lift up her eyes, she never would do so according. But I\ndo assure you, sir, when it cometh to such like manner of taking on,\nthe last thing as ever gets called into the account is sensible\nreason. They feels this, and they feels that; and then they falls to\na-dreaming; and the world goes into their tub, same as butter, and\nthey scoops it out, and pats, and stamps it to their own size and\nliking, and then the whole melteth, and a sour fool is left.\"\n\n\"Master Cripps, what you say is wise; and the like has often happened.\nBut your sister is a most noble girl. You do her gross injustice by\ntalking as if she were nothing but a common village maid. She is\nbrave, she is pure, she is grandly unselfish. Her mind is well above\nfeminine average; anything more so goes always amiss. You should not\nhave such a low opinion as you seem to have of your sister, Cripps.\"\n\n\"Sir, my opinion is high enough. Now, to bring your own fine words to\nthe test, would you ever dream of marrying the maid, if I and she both\nwas agreeable?\"\n\n\"It would be an honour to me to do so. For the prejudices of the world\nI care not one fig. But surely you know that we contend for the\ncelibacy of the clergy.\"\n\n\"Maning as a parson maun't marry a wife?\" asked Cripps, by the light\nof nature.\n\n\"Yes, my friend, that is what we now maintain in the Anglican\ncommunion, as the tradition of the Church.\"\n\n\"Well, may I be danged!\" cried Cripps, who was an ardent theologian.\n\"Then, if I may make so bold to ask, sir, how could there a' been a\ntribe of Levi? They must all a' died out in the first generation; if\n'em ever come to any generation at all.\"\n\n\"Your objection is ingenious, Cripps; but the analogy fails entirely.\nWe are guided in such matters by unbroken and unquestionable tradition\nof the early Church.\"\n\n\"Then, sir, if you goes outside of the Bible, you stand on your own\nlegs, and leave us no kind of leg to stand upon. However, I believe\nthat you mean well, sir, and I am sure that you never do no great\nharm. And, as to our Etty, if you feel like that in an honest,\nhelpless sort of way, I beg the honour of shaking hands, sir, for the\nspirit that is inside of you.\"\n\n\"Certainly, certainly, Cripps, with great pleasure!\"\n\n\"And then of asking you to tramp another road, for your own sake, as\nwell as hers, sir. And may the Lord teach you to know your own mind.\"\n\n\"Cripps, I will follow your advice for the present; though you have\nsaid some things that you scarcely ought to say.\"\n\n\"Then I humbly beg your pardon, sir. Every one of us doeth that same\nsometimes. The bridle of the tongue falleth into the teeth, when the\nlash is laid on us.\"\n\n\"Your metaphors are quite classical. However, I respect you greatly,\nCripps, for your straightforward conduct. I am not a weak man, any\nmore than you are; although you seem to think me one. I like and\nadmire your sister Esther, for courage combined with gentleness. I\nalways liked her, when she was a child; and I understood her nature.\nBut as to her--liking me more than she ought; Cripps, you are\nimaginative.\"\n\n\"Never heerd before,\" cried Cripps, \"any accoosation of that there\nkind.\"\n\n\"My friend, it is the rarest compliment. However, your horse is quite\nready to walk off; and so am I, towards Cowley. I will not go to\nShotover Grange to-day; and I will avoid your sister; though I rarely\ndo like talking to her.\"\n\n\"You are a man sir,\" cried Zacchary Cripps, as Hardenow set off across\nthe fields. \"God bless your reverence, though you never get a waife! A\ntrue man he is, and a maight a' been a faine one, if he hadn't taken\nto them stiff coat tails.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\n\nKIT.\n\n\nIn the meanwhile, Mrs. Luke Sharp was growing very anxious about her\nson, and only child and idol, Christopher. Not that there was anything\nat all amiss with his bodily health, so far at least as she could see;\nbut that he seemed so unsettled in his mind, so absent and\npreoccupied, and careless even of his out-door sports, which at one\ntime were his only care. Of course, at this time of year, there was\nvery little employment for the gun, but there was plenty of fishing to\nbe got, such as it was, round Oxford, and it must be a very bad time\nof year when there are no rats for little terriers, and badgers for\nthe larger tribe. Yet none of these things now possessed the proper\ncharm for Christopher. Wherever he was, he always seemed to be wanting\nto be somewhere else; and, like a hydrophobic dog, he hated to be\nlooked at; while (after the manner of a cat assisted lately by Lucina)\nhe ran up into his own loft, when he thought there was nobody\nwatching.\n\nWell arranged as all this might be, and keen, and self-satisfactory,\nthere was something keener, and not very easy to satisfy, looking\nafter it. The love of a mother may fairly be trusted to outwit any\nsuch calf-love as was making a fool of this unfledged fellow, fresh\nfrom the feather-bed of a private school.\n\nConsidering whence he came, and how he had been brought up and\npampered, Kit Sharp was a very fine young fellow, and--thanks to his\nliking for gun and rod--he could scarcely be called a milksop. Still\nhe was only a boy in mind, and in manner quite unformed and shy; his\nfather (for reasons of his own) having always refused to enter him at\nany of the colleges. He might perhaps have shaped his raw material by\nthe noblest models, if he had been admitted into the society of\nundergraduates. But the members of the University entertained in those\ndays, and probably still entertain, a just and inevitable contempt for\nall the non-togati. Kit Sharp had made some fluttering overtures of\nthe flag of friendship towards one or two random undergraduates who\nhad a nice taste for ratting; he had even dined and wined, once or\ntwice, in a not ignoble college; and had been acknowledged to know a\nmeerschaum as well as if he owned a statute-book. But the boy always\nfancied, perhaps through foolish and shy pride on his part, that these\nmost hospitable and kind young men had their jokes to themselves about\nhim. Perhaps it was so; but in pure goodwill. Take him for all in all,\nand allow for the needs of his situation--which towards the third year\ngrow imperative--and the Oxford undergraduate is as good as any other\nyoung gentleman.\n\nBut Kit Sharp being exceedingly proud, and most secretive of his\npride, would not long receive, without return, good hospitality. And\nthis alone, without other suspicions, would have set bounds to his\ndealing with a race profusely hospitable. His dear and good mother\nwould gladly have invited a Cross Duck Houseful of undergraduates, and\nleft them to get on as they might, if only thereby her pet son might\nhave sense of salt for salt with them; but Mr. Luke Sharp took a\ndifferent view. To his mind, the junior members of the glorious\nUniversity were a most disagreeable and unprofitable lot to deal with.\nHe never, of course, condescended to the Vice-Chancellor's court, and\nhe despised all little actions, in that large word's legal sense. He\nliked a fine old Don, or Head of a House, who had saved a sack of\nmoney, or well earned it by vitality. But for any such young fellows,\nwith no expectations, or paulo-post-futura such, Mr. Sharp was now too\nlong established to put a leaf into his dinner-table. This being so,\nand Christopher also of restricted pocket-money (so that no dinners at\nthe Star or Mitre could be contemplated), Master Kit Sharp, in a \"town\nand gown row,\" must have lent the weight of his quiet, but very\nconsiderable, fist to the oppidan faction.\n\n\"Kit, now, my darling Kit, do tell me,\" said Mrs. Sharp for about the\nfiftieth time, as she sat with her son in the sweet spring twilight,\nat the large western window of Cross Duck House; \"what is it that\nmakes you sigh so? You almost break your poor mother's heart. I never\ndid know you sigh, my own one. Now, is it for want of a rat, my\ndarling? If rats are a sovereign apiece, you shall have one.\"\n\n\"Rats, mother! Why, I can catch my own, without any appeal to 'the\nFilthy!' Rats are never far away from legal premises, like these.\"\n\n\"You should not speak so of your father's house, Kit. And I am sure\nthat no rats ever come upstairs, or out of the window I must jump. But\nnow you are only avoiding the subject. What is it that disturbs your\nmind, Kit?\"\n\n\"Once more, mother, I have the greatest objection to being called\n'Kit.' It sounds so small, and--and so horribly prosaic. All the\ndictionaries say that it means, either the outfit of a common soldier,\nor else a diminutive kind of fiddle.\"\n\n\"Christopher, I really beg your pardon. I know how much loftier you\nare, of course; but I cannot get over the habit, Kit. Well, well,\nthen--My darling, I hope you are not at all above being 'my darling,'\nKit.\"\n\n\"Mother, you may call me what you like. It can make no difference in\nmy destinies.\"\n\n\"Christopher, you make my blood run cold. My darling, I implore you\nnot to sigh so. Your dear father pays my allowance on Monday. I know\nwhat has long been the aspiration of your heart. Kit, you shall have a\nlive badger of your own.\"\n\n\"I hate the very name of rats and badgers. Everything is so low and\nnasty. How can you look at that noble sunset, and be full of badgers?\nMother, it grieves me to leave you alone; but how can I help it, when\nyou go on so? I shall go for a walk on the Botley Road.\"\n\n\"Take your pipe, Kit, take your pipe; whatever you do, Kit, take your\npipe,\" screamed poor Mrs. Sharp, as he stuck his hat on, as if it were\nnever to come off again. \"Oh, Kit, there are such deep black holes; I\nwill fill your pipe for you, if you will only smoke.\"\n\n\"Mother, you never know how to do it. And once more, my name is\n'Christopher.'\"\n\nThe young man threw a light cloak on his shoulder, and set his\neyebrows sternly; and his countenance looked very picturesque in the\nglow of his death's-head meerschaum. It occurred to his mother that\nshe had never seen anything more noble. As soon as she had heard him\nbang the door, Mrs. Sharp ran back to the window, whence she could\nwatch all Cross Duck Lane, and she saw him striding along towards the\nquickest outlet to the country.\n\n\"How wonderful it is!\" she said to herself, with tears all ready;\n\"only the other day he was quite a little boy, and whipped a top, and\ncried if a pin ran into him. And now he is, far beyond all dispute,\nthe finest young man in Oxford; he has the highest contempt for all\nvulgar sports, and he bolts the door of his bedroom. His father calls\nhim thick and soft! Ah, he cannot understand his qualities! There is\nthe deepest and purest well-spring of unintelligible poetry in Kit.\nHis great mind is perturbed, and has hurried him into commune with the\nevening star. Thank goodness that he has got his pipe!\"\n\nBefore Mrs. Sharp had turned one page of her truly voluminous thoughts\nabout her son, a sharp click awoke the front-door lock, and a steady\nand well-jointed step made creaks on the old oak staircase. Mrs. Sharp\ndrew back from her meditative vigil, and trimmed her little curls\naright.\n\n\"Miranda, I have some work to do to-night,\" said Mr. Sharp, in his\nquiet even voice; \"and I thought it better to come up and tell you, so\nthat you need not expect me again. Just have the fire in the office\nlighted. I can work better there than I can upstairs; and I find the\nevenings damp, although the long cold winter is gone at last. If I\nshould ring about ten o'clock it will be for a cup of coffee. If I do\nnot ring then, send everybody to bed. And do not expect me until you\nsee me.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Luke, I quite understand,\" answered Mrs. Sharp, having\nbeen for years accustomed to such arrangements; \"but, my dear, before\nyou begin, can you spare me five minutes, for a little conversation?\"\n\n\"Of course I can, Miranda! I am always at your service.\"\n\nMrs. Sharp thought to herself that this was a slight exaggeration.\nStill on the whole she had little to complain of. Mr. Sharp always\nremembered the time when he cast sad distant eyes at her, Miranda\nPiper,--more enchanting than a will-case, more highly cherished than\nthe deed-box of an Earl. Nothing but impudence had enabled him to\nmarry her; thereby his impudence was exhausted in that one direction,\nand he ever remained polite to her.\n\n\"Then, Luke, will you just take your favourite chair, and answer me\nonly one question?\" As she said these words, Mrs. Sharp took care to\nset the chair so that she could get the last gleam of sunset on her\ndear lord's face. Her husband thoroughly understood all this, and\naccepted the situation.\n\n\"Now, do tell me, Luke--you notice everything, though you do not\nalways speak of it--have you observed how very strangely Kit has been\ngoing on for some time now? And have you any idea of the reason? And\ndo you think that we ought to allow it, my dear?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mrs. Sharp, I have observed it. You need not be at all uneasy\nabout it. I am observing him very closely. When I disapprove, I shall\nstop it at once.\"\n\n\"But surely, my dear, surely I, his mother, am not to be kept in the\ndark about it? I know that you always take your own course, and your\ncourse is quite sure to be the right one; but surely, my dear, when\nsomething important is evidently going on about my own child, you\nwould never have the heart to keep it from me. I could not endure it;\nindeed, I could not. I should fret myself away to skin and bone.\"\n\n\"It would take a long time to do that, my dear,\" replied Mr. Sharp, as\nhe looked with satisfaction at her fine plump figure. It pleased him\nto hear, as he often did, that there was not in Oxford a finer couple\nof middle-aged people than Mr. and Mrs. Sharp. \"However, I should be\nexceedingly grieved ever to initiate such a process. But first, before\nI tell you anything at all, I will ask you to promise two things most\nclearly.\"\n\n\"My dear, I would promise fifty things rather than put up with this\ncruel anxiety.\"\n\n\"Yes, I dare say. But I do not want rash promises, Miranda. You must\npledge yourself to two things, and keep your pledges.\"\n\n\"I will do so in a moment, with the greatest pleasure. You would never\nask anything wrong, I am sure. Only do not keep me waiting so.\"\n\n\"In the first place, then, you must promise me, whether my plan turns\nout well or ill, on no account to blame me for it, but to give me the\ncredit of having acted for the best throughout.\"\n\n\"Nothing can be easier than to promise that. My dear, you always do\nact for the best; and what is more, the best always comes of it.\"\n\n\"Very well, you promise that; also, you must pledge yourself to\nconceal from every one, and most of all from Christopher, everything I\nam about to tell you, and to act under my directions.\"\n\n\"To be sure, my dear; to be sure, I will. Nothing is more reasonable\nthan that I should keep your secrets.\"\n\n\"I know that you will try, Miranda; and I know that you have much\nself-command. Also, you will see the importance of acting as I direct\nyou. All I fear is that when you see poor Kit moping, or sighing, and\ngroaning, it may be almost beyond your power to refrain your motherly\nheart.\"\n\n\"Have no fear, Luke; have no fear whatever. When I know that it is for\nhis true interest, as of course it will be, I shall be exceedingly\nsorry for him; but still he may go on as much as he pleases; and of\ncourse, he has not behaved well at all, in being so mysterious to his\nown mother.\"\n\nLuke Sharp looked at his wife, to ask whether any offshoot of this\nreproach was intended at all to come home to him. If he had discovered\nany sign of that, the wife of his bosom would have waited long without\ngetting another word from him. For seldom as Mr. Sharp showed temper,\nhe held back, with the chain-curb of expedience, as quick a temper as\never threatened to bolt with any man's fair repute. But now he\nreceived no irritation. His wife looked back at him kindly and\nsweetly, with moist expressive eyes; and he saw that she still was in\nher duty.\n\n\"Miranda,\" he said, being touched by this, for he had a great deal of\nconscience, \"my darling, I will tell you something such as you never\nheard before. I have made a bold stroke, a very bold one; but I think\nit must succeed. And justice is with me, as you will own, after all\nthe attempts to rob us. Perhaps you never heard a stranger story; but\nstill I am sure you will agree with me, that in every step I have\ntaken I am most completely and perfectly justified.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\n\nA WOOLHOPIAN.\n\n\nIt is only fair towards Mr. Sharp to acquit him of all intention to\ntrust his wife with a very important secret, as long as he could help\nit. He was well aware of the risk he ran in taking such a desperate\nstep; but the risk was forced upon him now by several circumstances.\nAlso, he wanted her aid just now, in a matter in which he could not\npossibly have it without trusting her. Hence he resolved to make a\nvirtue of necessity, as the saying is, and at the same time get the\ngreat relief which even a strong mind, in long scheming, obtains, by\nhaving its burden shared.\n\nThis resolve of his was no sudden one. For several days he had made up\nhis mind, that when he should be questioned upon the subject--which he\nforesaw must happen--he would earn the credit of candour, and the\ngrace of womanly gratitude, by making a clean breast of it. There\ncould be no better season than this. The house was quiet; his son was\naway; the shadows of the coming evening softly fell before her step;\nCross Duck Lane looked very touching in the calm of twilight; and Mrs.\nSharp was in the melting mood. Therefore the learned and conscientious\nlawyer perceived that the client's affairs, about which he was going\nto busy himself, might safely wait for another day, while he was\nsweeping his own hearth clean. So he locked the door, and looked out\nof the window, where sparrows were swarming to their ivy roost; and\nthen he drew in the old lattice, and turned the iron tongue that\nfastened it. Mrs. Sharp looked on, while some little suggestion of\nfear came to qualify eagerness.\n\n\"Luke, I declare you quite make me nervous. I shall be afraid to go to\nbed to-night. Really, a stranger, or a timid person, would think you\nwere going to confess a murder!\"\n\n\"My dear, if you feel at all inclined to give way,\" Mr. Sharp\nanswered, as if glad to escape, \"we will have out our talk\nto-morrow--or, no--to-morrow I have an appointment at Woodstock. The\nday after that we will recur to it. I see that it will be better so.\"\n\n\"Luke, is your mind astray? I quite fear so. Can you imagine that I\ncould wait for two days, after what you have told me?\"\n\n\"My dear, I was only considering yourself. If you wish it, I will\nbegin at once. Only for your own sake, I must insist on your sitting\ncalmly down. There, my dear! Now, do not agitate yourself. There is\nnothing to frighten anybody. It is the most simple thing; and you will\nlaugh, when you have heard it.\"\n\n\"Then I wish I had heard it, Luke. For I feel more inclined to cry\nthan laugh.\"\n\n\"Miranda, you must not be foolish. Such a thing is not at all like\nyou. Very well, now you are quite sedate. Now please not to interrupt\nme once; but ask your questions afterwards. If you ask me a question I\nshall stop, and go to the office with my papers.\" Mr. Sharp looked at\nhis wife; and she bowed her head in obedience. \"To begin at the very\nbeginning,\" he said, with a smile to re-assure her, \"you will do me\nthe justice to remember that I have worked very hard for my living.\nAnd I have prospered well, Miranda, having you as both the foundation\nand the crown of my prosperity. I was perfectly satisfied, as you\nknow, living quite up to my wishes, and putting a little cash by every\nyear of our lives, and paying on a heavy life-insurance, in case of my\nown life dropping--for the sake of you and Christopher. You know all\nthat?\"\n\n\"Darling Luke, I do. But you make me cry, when you talk like that.\"\n\n\"Very well. That is as it should be. We were as happy as need be\nexpected, until the great wrong befell us--the fierce injustice of\nlosing every farthing to which we were clearly entitled. You were the\nproper successor to all the property of old Fermitage. That old\ncurmudgeon, and wholesale poisoner of the University, made a fool of\nhimself, towards his latter end, by marrying Miss Oglander. Old\nBlack-Strap, as of course we know, had no other motive for doing such\na thing, except his low ambition to be connected with a good old\nfamily. Ever since he began life as a bottleboy, in the cellars of old\nJerry Pigaud----\"\n\n\"He never did that, Luke. How can you speak so of my father's own\nfirst cousin? He was an extremely respectable young man; my father\nalways said so.\"\n\n\"While he was making his money, Miranda, of course he was respectable.\nAnd everybody respected him, as soon as he had made it. However, I\nhave not the smallest intention of reproaching the poor old villain.\nHe acted according to his lights, and they led him very badly. A\nfoolish ambition induced him to marry that pompous old maid, Joan\nOglander, who had been jilted by Commodore Patch, the son of the\nfamous captain. We all know what followed; the old man was but a doll\nin the hands of his lady-wife. He left all the scrapings and screwings\nof his life, for her to do what she pleased with--at least, everybody\nsupposes so.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Luke?\" asked Mrs. Sharp, having inkling of legal\nsurprises. \"Do you mean that there is a later will? Has he done\njustice to me, after all?\"\n\n\"No, my dear. He never saved his soul by attending to his own kindred.\nBut he just had the sense to make a little change at last, when his\nwife would not come near him. You know what he died of. It was coming\non for weeks; though at last it struck him suddenly. The port-wine\nfungus of his old vaults grew into his lungs, and stopped them. It had\nshown for some time in his face and throat; and his wife was afraid of\ncatching it. She took it to be some infectious fever, of which she is\nalways so terribly afraid. The old man knew that his time was short;\nbut take to his bed he would not. Of all born men the most stubborn he\nwas; as any man must be, to get on well. 'If I am to die of the\nfungus,' he said, 'I will have a little more of it.' And he went, and\nwith his own hands hunted up a magnum of port, which had been laid by,\nfrom the vintage of 1745, in the first days of Jerry Pigaud. But\nbefore that, he had sent for me; and I was there when he opened it.\"\n\n\"Luke, you take my breath away. Such wonderful things I have never\nheard. At least, not in our own family.\"\n\n\"Of course, my dear. We all accept wonders with quietude, till they\ncome home to us. Well, when he fetched out this old bottle, it was\nfungus inside from heel to neck. He held it up against the light, and\nthe glass being whiter than now they make, and the wine gone almost\nwhite with age, there you could see this extraordinary growth, like\ncords in the bottle, and valves across it, and a long yellow sheath\nlike a crocus-flower. I had never seen anything like it before; but he\nknew all about it. 'Ah, I know a genleman,' he grunted in his\nthroat--he never could say 'gentleman,' as you remember--'a genleman\nas would give a hundred guineas for this here bottle! Quibbles, he\nshouldn't have it for a thousand! My boy, you and I will drink it. Say\nno, and I'll cut off your wife with a half-penny!' Miranda, what could\nI do but try to humour him to the utmost? If I had had the smallest\ninkling of the iniquitous will he had made, of course, I never would\nhave sat on the head of the cask, down in his dingy and reeking\nvaults, by the hour together, to please him. But never mind that--in a\nmoment he took a long-handled knife, or chopper, and holding the\nbottle upright, struck off the neck and a part of the shoulder, as\nstraight as a line, at the level of the wine. 'Not many men could do\nthat,' he said; 'none of your clumsy cork-screwers for me! Now,\nQuibbles, here's a real treat for you! Talk of beeswing, my boy,\nhere's a beehive!' And really it was more like eating than drinking\nwine; for all the body was gone into the fungus. Nastier stuff I never\ntasted; but, luckily, he took the lion's share. 'Now, Quibbles, I'll\ntell you a secret,' he said, after swallowing at least a quart; 'a\nvery pretty girl came and kissed me t'other day, in among these very\nbottles. Such a little duck--not a bit ashamed or afeared of my\nfungus, as my missus is. And her breath was as sweet as the violets of\n'20! \"Well now, my little dear,\" thinks I, as I stood back and looked\nat her, \"that was kind of you to kiss an old man a-dying of port wine\nfungus! And if he only lives another day, you shall have the right to\nkiss the Royal family, if you cares to do it.\" Quibbles, I wouldn't\ncall in you, nor any other thief of a lawyer. Lawyers are very well\nover a glass; but keep 'em outside of the cellar, say I. Very good\ncompany, in their way; but the only company I put trust in is the one\nI have dealt with all my life,--and many a thousand pounds I have paid\nthem--The Royal Wine Company of Oporto. So now, if anything happens to\nme--though I am not in such a hurry to be binned away, and walled up\nfor the resurrection--Quibbles, wait six months; and then you go to\nthe Royal Oporto Company, and ask for a genleman of the name of Jolly\nFellows.'\"\n\n\"Now, Luke, I am all anxiety to hear,\" exclaimed Mrs. Sharp, with a\nsudden interruption, \"what was the end of this very strange affair. I\nperceive now that I have foreseen the whole of it. But it is not right\nthat you should speak so long, without one morsel of refreshment. It\nis many hours since you dined, my dear, and a very poor dinner you had\nof it. You shall have a glass of white wine, and a slice of tongue,\nbetween a little cold roll and butter. It will not in any way\ninterrupt you. I can get it all for you, without ringing the bell.\nOnly let me ask you one thing first--why have you never told me this\ntill now?\"\n\n\"Because, Miranda, it would disturb your mind. And I know that you\ncannot endure suspense. Moreover, I scarcely knew what to think of it.\nPoor old Fermitage (what with the fungus already in his tubes, and\nwhat he was taking down) might be talking sheer nonsense for all that\nI knew. And indeed, for a long time I treated it so; and I had no\nstomach for a voyage to Oporto, upon mere speculation, and for the\nbenefit only of some pretty girl. Then I found out, by the purest\nchance, that no voyage to Oporto was needful, that old 'Port-wine'\n(who departed on his cask to a better world, the day after his magnum)\nmeant nothing more than the London stores and agency of the Oporto\nCompany. And even after that I made one expedition to the Minories,\nall for nothing. Two or three very polite young dons stared at me, and\nthought I was come to chaff them, or perhaps had turned up from their\nvaults top-heavy, when I asked for 'Senhor Jolly Fellows.' And so I\ncame away, and lost some months, and might never have thought it worth\nwhile to go again, except for another mere accident.\"\n\n\"My dear, what a chapter of accidents!\" cried Mrs. Sharp, while\nfeeding him. \"I thought that you were a great deal too clever to allow\nany room for accidents.\"\n\n\"Women think so. Men know better,\" the lawyer replied sententiously;\nhis ability was too well-known to need his vindication. \"And, Miranda,\nyou forget that I had as yet no personal interest in the question. But\nwhen I happened to have a Portuguese gentleman as a client--a man who\nhad spent many years in England--and happened to be talking of our\nlanguage to him, I told him one part of the story, and asked if he\ncould throw any light on it. He told me at once that the name which\nhad so puzzled me must be Gelofilos--a Portuguese surname, by no means\ncommon. And the next time I was in town, I had occasion to call in St.\nJohn's Street, and found myself, almost by accident again, not far\nfrom the Company's offices.\"\n\n\"Mr. Sharp, you left such a thing to chance, when you knew that it\nmight pull down that dreadful woman's insolence!\"\n\n\"My dear, it is not the duty of my life to mitigate feminine\narrogance. And to undertake such a crusade, gratis! I am equal to a\nbold stroke, as you will see, if your patience lasts--but never to\nsuch a vast undertaking. When it comes before me, in the way of\nbusiness, naturally I take it up. But this was no business of my own;\nand the will was proved, and assets called in; for the old rogue did\nnot owe one penny. Well, I went again, and this time I got hold of the\nright man---- Miranda, I hear the bell!\"\n\nThe new office-bell, the successor to the one that succumbed to Russel\nOvershute, rang as hard as ring it could. A special messenger was come\nfrom London, and in half an hour Mr. Luke Sharp was sitting on the box\nof the night up mail.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\n\nNIGHTINGALES.\n\n\nThis sudden departure of Mr. Luke Sharp, in the very marrow of his\nstory, left his good wife in a trying and altogether discontented\nstate of mind. She knew that she could have no more particulars until\nhe came back again; for Sharp had even less faith in the post than the\npost of that period deserved. She might have to wait for days and\ndays, with a double anxiety urging her.\n\nIn the first place, although she felt nothing but pity for poor old\nMrs. Fermitage, and would have been really sorry to hear of anything\nlikely to vex her, she could not help being desirous to know if there\nwere any danger of a thing so sad. But her second anxiety was a great\ndeal keener, being sharpened by the ever moving grit of love; in the\ndreadful state of mind her son was in, how would all this act upon\nhim? His father had been forced, by some urgency of things, to put on\nhis box-coat, and make off, without even time for a hurried whisper as\nto the residue of his tale. Mrs. Sharp felt that there might be\nsomething which her husband feared to spread before her, without\nplenty of time to lead up to it; and having for many years been\nvisited (whenever she was not quite herself) with poignant doubts\nwhether Mr. Sharp was anchored upon Scriptural principles, she almost\npersuaded herself for the moment that he meant to put up with the loss\nof the money.\n\nHowever, a little reflection sufficed to clear away this sadly awful\ncloud of scepticism, and to assure her that Mr. Sharp, however he\nmight swerve in theory, would be orthodox enough in practice to follow\nthe straight path towards the money. And then she began to think of\nnothing except her own beloved Kit.\n\nThe last hurried words of her husband had been--\"Not one word to Kit,\nor you ruin all; let him groan as he likes; only watch him closely. I\nshall be back by Saturday night. God bless you, my dear! Keep up your\nspirits. I have the whip-hand of the lot of them.\"\n\nHerein lay her faith and hope. She never had known her husband fail,\nwhen he really made up his mind to succeed; and therefore in the\nbottom of her heart she doubted the genuine loss of Grace Oglander.\nSharp had discovered, and traced to their end, clues of the finest\ngossamer, when his interest led him to do so. That he should be\nbaffled, and own himself to be so, was beyond her experience.\nTherefore, although as yet she had no more than a guess at her\nhusband's schemes, she could not help fancying, after his words, that\nthey might have to do with Grace Oglander.\n\nBefore she had time to think out her thoughts, Christopher, their main\nsubject, returned from Wytham Wood, after holding long rivalry of woe\nwith nightingales. He still carried on, and well-carried off, the\nstyle of the love-lorn Romeo. He swung his cloak quite as well as\ncould be expected of an Englishman--who is born to hate fly-away\napparel, all of which is womanish; but the necessities of his position\nhad driven him now to a very short pipe. His favourite meerschaum had\nfallen into sorrow as terrible as his own. In a highly poetical moment\nhe had sucked it so hard that the oil arose, and took him with a hot\nspot upon a white tongue, impregnated then with a sonnet. All sonnets\nare of the tongue and ear; but Kit misliked having his split up, just\nwhen it was coming to the final kick. Therefore he gave his pipe a\nthump, beyond such a pipe's endurance; and being as sensitive as\nhimself, and of equally fine material, it simply refused to draw any\nmore, as long as he breathed poetry. Still breathing poetry, he\nmarched home, with the stump of a farthing clay, newly baked in the\nSummertown Road, to console him.\n\nNow, if this young man had failed of one of the triple human\ncombination--weed, and clay, and fire--where and how might he have\nended not only that one evening, but all the rest of the evenings of\nhis young life? His appearance and manner had at first imported to any\none whom he came across--and he truly did come across them in his wide\nand loose march out of Oxford city--that he might be sought for in a\nfew hours' time, and only the inferior portion found. His mother\nworried him, so did his father, so did all humanity, save one--who\nworried him more than any, or all of it put together. The trees and\nthe road, and the singing of the birds, and the gladness of the green\nworld worried him. Luckily for himself he had bought a good box of\nGerman tinder, and from ash to ash his spirit glowed slowly into a\nmore philosophic state. Gradually the beauty of the trees and hedges\nand the sloping fields began to steal around him; the warbled pleasure\nof the little birds made overture to his sympathy, and the lustrous\ncalm of shadowed waters spread its picture through his mind.\n\nHis body also responded to the influences of the time of day, and the\nlove of nature freshened into the natural love of cupboard. Hunger\nawoke in his system somewhere, and spread sweet pictures in a tasteful\npart. For a \"moment of supreme agony\" he wrestled with the coarse\nmaterial instinct, then turned on his heel, as our novelists say, and\nmade off for his father's kitchen.\n\nHis poor mother caught him the moment he came in, and pulled off his\nhat and his opera-cloak, and frizzled up his curls for him. She seemed\nto think that he must have been for a journey of at least a hundred\nleagues; that the fault of his going was hers, and the virtue of his\never coming back was all his own. Then she looked at him slyly, and\nwith some sadness, and yet a considerable touch of pride, by the light\nof a three-wicked cocoa-candle; and feeling quite sure that she had\nhim to herself, trembled at the boldness of the shot she made:\n\n\"Oh, Kit, why have you never told me? I have found it all out. You\nhave fallen in love!\"\n\nChristopher Fermitage Sharp, Esquire--as he always entitled himself,\nupon the collar of spaniel or terrier--had nothing to say for a\nmoment, but softly withdrew, to have his blush in shadow. Of all the\nworld, best he loved his mother--before, or after, somebody else--and\nhis simple, unpractised, and uncored heart, was shy of the job it was\ncarrying on. Therefore he turned from his mother's face, and her eager\neyes, and expectant arms.\n\n\"Come and tell me, my darling,\" she whispered, trying to get a good\nlook at his reluctant eyes, and wholly oblivious of her promise to his\nfather. \"I will not be angry at all, Kit, although you never should\nhave left me to find it out in this way.\"\n\n\"There is nothing to find out,\" he answered, making a turn towards the\nkitchen stairs. \"I just want my supper, if there is anything to eat.\"\n\n\"To eat, Kit! And I thought so much better of you. After all, I must\nhave been quite wrong. What a shame to invent such stories!\"\n\n\"You must have invented them, yourself, dear mother,\" said Kit with\nrecovered bravery. \"Let me hear it all out when I have had my supper.\"\n\n\"I will go down this moment, and see what there is,\" replied his good\nmother eagerly. \"Is there anything, now, that can coax your appetite?\"\n\n\"Yes, mother, oysters will be over to-morrow. I should like two dozen\nfried with butter, and a pound and a quarter of rump-steak, cut thick,\nand not overdone.\"\n\n\"You shall have them, my darling, in twenty minutes. Now, be sure that\nyou put your fur slippers on; I saw quite a fog coming over Port\nMeadow, as much as half an hour ago. This is the worst time of year to\ntake cold. 'A May cold is a thirty-day cold.' What a stupe I must be,\"\nshe continued to herself, \"to imagine that the boy could be in love! I\nwill take care to say not another word, or I might break my promise to\nhis father. What a pity! He has a noble moustache coming, and only his\nmother to admire it!\"\n\nIn spite of all disappointment, this good mother paid the warmest heed\nto the ordering, ay, and the cooking, of the supper of her only child.\nA juicier steak never sat on a gridiron; fatter oysters never frizzled\nwith the pure bubble of goodness. Kit sat up, and made short work of\nall that came before him.\n\n\"Now, mother, what is it you want to say?\" His tone was not defiant,\nbut nicely self-possessed, and softly rich with triumph of digestion.\nAnd a silver tankard of Morel's ale helped him to express himself.\n\n\"My dear boy, I have nothing to say, except that you have lifted a\ngreat weight off my mind, a very great weight beyond description, by\nleaving behind you not even a trace of the existence of that fine\nrump-steak.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\n\nMAY MORN.\n\n\nIt was the morn when the tall and shapely tower of Magdalen is crowned\nwith a fillet of shining white, awaiting the first step of sunrise.\nOnce a year, for generations, this has been the sign of it--eager\neyes, and gaping mouths, little knuckles blue with cold, and clumsy\nlittle feet inclined to slide upon the slippery lead. All are bound to\nkeep together for the radiant moment; all are a little elated at their\nheight above all other boys; all have a strong idea that the sun, when\nhe comes, will be full of them; and every one of them longs to be back\nbeneath his mother's blankets.\n\nIt is a tradition with this choir (handed, or chanted, down from very\nancient choral ancestry) that the sun never rises on May-day without\niced dew to glance upon. Scientific record here comes in to prop\ntradition. The icy saints may be going by, but they leave their breath\nbehind them. And the poets, who have sent forth their maids to \"gather\nthe dews of May,\" knew, and meant, that dew must freeze to stand that\noperation.\n\nBut though the sky was bright, and the dew lay sparkling for the\nmaidens, the frost on this particular morning was not so keen as\nusual. The trees that took the early light (more chaste without the\nyellow ray) glistened rather with soft moisture than with stiff\nencrustment; and sprays, that kept their sally into fickle air half\nlatent, showing only little scolloped crinkles with a knob in them,\nheld in every downy quillet liquid, rather than solid, gem.\n\nChristopher Sharp, looking none the worse for his excellent supper of\nlast night, laid his fattish elbow on the parapet of the bridge, and\nmused. Poetical feeling had fetched him out, thus early in the\nmorning, to hear the choir salute the sun, and to be moved with\nsympathy. The moon is the proper deity of all true lovers, and has\nthem under good command when she pleases. But for half the weeks of a\nmonth, she declines to sit in the court of lunacy; at least, as\nregards this earth, having her own men and women to attend to. This\nyoung man knew that she could not be found, with a view to meditation,\nnow; and his mind relapsed to the sun--a coarse power, poetical only\nwhen he sets and rises.\n\nWith strength and command of the work of men, and leaving their dreams\nto his sister, the sun leaped up, with a shake of his brow and a\nscattering of the dew-clouds. The gates of the east swung right and\nleft; so that tall trees on a hill seemed less than reeds in the rush\nof glory; and lines (like the spread of a crystal fan) trembled along\nthe lowland. Inlets now, and lanes of vision (scarcely opened\nyesterday, and closed perhaps to-morrow) guided shafts of light along\nthe level widening ways they love. Tree and tower, hill and wall, and\nwater and broad meadow, stood, or lay, or leaned (according to the\nstamp set on them), one and all receiving, sharing, and rejoicing in\nthe day.\n\nBetween the battlements, and above them, burst and rose the choral\nhymn; and as the laws of sound compelled it to go upward mainly, the\npart that came down was pleasing. Christopher, seeing but little of\nthe boys, and not hearing very much, was almost enabled to regard the\nwhole as a vocal effort of the angels: and thus in solemn thought he\nwandered as far as the high-tolled turnpike gate.\n\n\"I will hie me to Cowley,\" said he to himself, instead of turning back\nagain; \"there will I probe the hidden import of impending destiny.\nThis long and dark suspense is more than can be brooked by human\npower. I know a jolly gipsy-woman; and if I went home I should have to\nwait three hours for my breakfast.\"\n\nWith these words he felt in the pockets of his coat, to be sure that\noracular cash was there, and found a silk purse with more money than\nusual, stored for the purchase of a dog called \"Pablo,\" a hero among\nbadgers.\n\n\"What is Pablo to me, or I to Pablo?\" he muttered with a smothered\nsigh. \"She told me she thought it a cruel and cowardly thing to kill\nfifty rats in five minutes. Never more--alas, never more!\" With a\nresolute step, but a clouded brow, he buttoned his coat, and strode\nonward.\n\nNow, if he had been in a fit state of mind for looking about him, he\nmight have found a thousand things worth looking at. But none of them,\nin his present hurry, won from him either glimpse or thought. He\ntrudged along the broad London road at a good brisk rate, while the\nsun glanced over the highlands, and the dewy ridges, away on the left\ntowards Shotover. The noble city behind him, stretched its rising\nsweep of tower, and spire, and dome, and serried battlement, stately\namong ancient trees, and rich with more than mere external glory to an\nEnglishman. And away to the right hand sloped broad meadows, green\nwith spring, and fluttered with the pearly hyaline of dew, lifting\npillars of dark willow in the distance, where the Isis ran.\n\nBut what are these things to a lover, unless they hit the moment's\nmood? The fair, unfenced, free-landscaped road for him might just as\nwell have been wattled, like a skittle-alley, and roofed with\nCroggon's patent felt. At certain--or rather uncertain--moments, he\nmight have rejoiced in the wide glad heart of nature spread to welcome\nhim; and must have felt, as lovers feel, the ravishment of beauty. It\nhappened, however, that his eyes were open to nothing above, or\naround, or before him, unless it should present itself in the image of\na gipsy's tent.\n\nHe turned to the left, before the road entered the new enclosures\ntowards Iffley, and trod his own track towards Cowley Marsh. The crisp\ndew, brushed by his hasty feet, ran into large globes behind him; and\njerks of dust, brought up by pressure, fell and curdled on them. In\nthe haze of the morning, he looked much larger than he had any right\nto seem, and the shadow of his arms and hat stretched into hollow\nplaces. There was no other moving figure to be seen, except from time\nto time, of a creature, the colonist of commons, whose mental frame\nwas not so unlike his own just now, as bodily form and style of\nwalking might in misty grandeur seem. Though Kit was not such a stupid\nfellow, when free from his present bewitchment.\n\nScant of patience he came to a place where the elbow of a hedge jutted\nforth upon the common. A mighty hedge of beetling brows, and\nover-hanging shagginess, and shelfy curves, and brambly depths, and\ntrue Devonian amplitude. High farming would have swept it down, and\nout of its long course ploughed an acre. Young Sharp had not traced\nits windings far, before he came upon a tidy-looking tent, pitched,\nwith the judgment of experience, in a snug and sheltered spot. The\nrest of the camp might be seen in the distance, glistening in the\nsunrise. This tent seemed to have crept away, for the sake of peace\nand privacy.\n\nChristopher quickened his steps, expecting to be met by a host of\nchildren, rushing forth with outstretched hands, and shaggy hair, and\nwild black eyes. But there was not so much as a child to be seen, nor\nthe curling smoke of a hedge-trough fire, nor even the scattered ash\nbetokening cookery of the night before. The canvas of the tent was\ndown; no head peeped forth, no naked leg or grimy foot protruded, to\nshow that the inner world was sleeping; even the dog, so rarely\nabsent, seemed to be really absent now.\n\nThe young man knew that the tent was not very likely to be unoccupied;\nbut naturally he did not like to peep into it uninvited; and he turned\naway to visit the chief community of rovers, when the sound of a low\nsoft moan recalled him. Still for a moment he hesitated, until he\nheard the like sound again, low, and clear, and musical from the\ndeepest chords of sorrow. Kit felt sure that it must be a woman, in\nstorms of trouble helpless; and full as he was of his own affairs he\nwas impelled to interfere. So he lifted back the canvas drawn across\nthe opening, and looked in.\n\nThere lay a woman on the sandy ground, with her back turned towards\nthe light, her neck and shoulders a little raised by the short support\nof one elbow, and her head, and all that therein was, fixed in a\nrigour of gazing. Although her face was not to be seen, and the\nhopeless moan of her wail had ceased, Kit Sharp knew that he was in\nthe presence of a grand and long-abiding woe.\n\nHe drew back, and he tried to make out what it was, and he sighed for\nconcert--even as a young dog whimpers to a mother who has lost her\npups--and, little as he knew of women, from his own mother, or whether\nor no, he judged that this woman had lost a child. That it was her\nonly one, was more than he could tell or guess. The woman, disturbed\nby the change of light, turned round and steadily gazed at him, or\nrather at the opening which he filled; for her eyes had no perception\nof him. Kit was so scared that he jerked his head back, and nearly\nknocked his hat off. He never had seen such a thing before; and, if he\nhad his choice he never would see such a thing again. The great dark,\nhollow eyes had lost similitude of human eyes: hope and fear and\nthought were gone; nothing remained but desolation and bare, reckless\nmisery.\n\nChristopher's gaze fell under hers. It would be a sheer impertinence\nto lay his small troubles before such woe.\n\n\"What is it? Oh! what is it?\" asked the woman, at last having some\nidea that somebody was near her.\n\n\"I am very sorry; I assure you, ma'am, that I never felt more sorry in\nall my life,\" said Kit, who was a very kind-hearted fellow, and had\nnow espied a small boy lying dead. \"I give you my word of honour,\nma'am, that if I could have guessed it, I would never have looked in.\"\n\nWithout any answer, the gipsy-woman turned again to her dead child,\nand took two little hands in hers, and rubbed them, and sat up,\nimagining that she felt some sign of life. She drew the little body to\nher breast, and laid the face to hers, and breathed into pale open\nlips (scarcely fallen into death), and lifted little eyelids with her\ntongue, and would not be convinced that no light came from under them;\nand then she rubbed again at every place where any warmth or polish of\nthe skin yet lingered. She fancied that she felt the little fellow\ncoming back to her, and she kept the whole of her own body moving to\nencourage him.\n\nThere was nothing to encourage. He had breathed his latest breath. His\nmother might go on with kisses, friction, and caresses, with every\npower she possessed of muscle, and lungs, and brain, and heart. There\nhe lay, as dead as a stone--one stone more on the earth; and the whole\nearth could not bring him back again.\n\nCinnaminta bowed her head. She laid the little bit of all she ever\nloved upon her lap, and fetched the small arms so that she could hold\nthem both together, and spread the careless face upon the breast where\nonce it had felt its way; and then she looked up in search of Kit, or\nany one to say something to.\n\n\"It is a just thing. I have earned it. I have robbed an old man of his\nonly child; and I am robbed of mine.\"\n\nThese words she spoke not in her own language, but in plain good\nEnglish; and then she lay down in her quiet scoop of sand, and folded\nher little boy in with her. Christopher saw that there was nothing to\nbe done. He cared to go no further in search of fortune-tellers; and,\nbeing too young to dare to offer worthless consolation, he wisely\nresolved to go home and have fried bacon; wherein he succeeded.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\nMAY-DAY.\n\n\nEre yet it was noon of that same day, to the great delight of Mrs.\nSharp, a strong desire to fish arose in the candid bosom of\nChristopher.\n\n\"Mother,\" he said, \"I shall have a bit of early grub, and take my rod,\nand try whether I can't manage to bring you a few perch home for\nsupper. Or, if the perch are not taking yet, I may have a chance of a\ntrout or two.\"\n\n\"Oh, that will be delightful, Kit! We can dine whenever we please, you\nknow, as your dear father is from home. We will have the cold lamb at\none o'clock. I can easily make my dinner then; and then, Kit, if you\nare very good, what do you think I will try to do? Such a treat as you\nhardly ever had!\"\n\n\"What, mother?--what? I must be off to get my tackle ready.\"\n\n\"My dear, I will send to Mr. Squeaker Smith, and order a nice light\nvehicle, with a very steady pony. And, Kit, I will put on my very\nworst cloak, and a bonnet not worth six-pence, and stout india-rubber\novershoes. And so you shall drive me wherever you please; and I will\nsee you catch all the fish. And you will enjoy every fish twice as\nmuch, because your dear mother is looking at you. I will bring some\nsandwiches, my pet, and your father's flask of sherry; and we can stay\nout till it is quite dark. Why, Kit, you don't look pleased about it!\"\n\n\"Mother, how can I be pleased to hear you speak of such things, at\nthis time of year? The spring is scarcely beginning yet, and the edges\nof the water are all swampy. You would be up to your knees, in no\ntime, in the most horrible yellow slime. I should be most delighted to\nhave your company, my dearest mother; but it will not do.\"\n\n\"Very well, Kit; you know best. But, at least, I can have the ride\nwith you, and wait somewhere while you go fishing?\"\n\n\"If I were going anywhere else, perhaps we might have contrived it so.\nBut while the wind stays in its present quarter, it is worse than\nuseless to think of fishing, except in the most outlandish places.\nThere would not be even a public-house, if you could stop at such a\nplace, within miles of the water I am going to. And the roads are\nbeyond conception. No wheels can get along them, except in the very\nheight of summer, or a dry black-frost. My dear mother, I am truly\ngrieved to lose your company; but I must ride the old cob Sam, and tie\nhim to a tree or gate; and over and over again you have told me how\nlong you have been waiting for the chance of a good long afternoon to\ndo a little shopping. And the London fashions, for the summer season,\narrived by the coach only yesterday.\"\n\n\"Did they, indeed? Are you sure of that? Well, Kit, I would rather\nhave come with you than seen the whole world of fashions, although you\ncan judge, and a lady cannot. But I do not care about that, my dear,\nif only you enjoy yourself. Ring the bell, my darling, and I will see\nabout your dinner.\"\n\nKit's heart burned within him sadly, and his cheeks kept it well in\ncountenance, as the shocking fraud thus practised by him upon his\ngood, unselfish mother. However, there was no help for it; and, after\nall, mothers must be made to be cheated; or why do they love it so?\n\nThus well-balanced with his conscience, Kit put all his smartest\nclothes on, as soon as the early dinner was done, and he felt quite\nsure in his own mind that his mother was safely embarked upon her\ngrand expedition of shopping. He saw her as clean as possible off the\npremises and round the utmost corner of the lane; and then he waited\nfor a minute and a half, to be sure that she had not forgotten her\npurse, or something else most essential. At last, he became sure as\nsure could be, that his admirable mother must now be sitting on a high\nchair in a fashionable shop; and with that he ran up to his own room,\nand kicked off his every-day breeches, and with great caution and vast\nstudy drew a brand-new pair of noble pantaloons, with a military\nstripe, up his well-nourished and established legs. He gazed at the\nresult, and found that on the whole it was not bad; and then he put on\nhis best velvet waistcoat, of a chaste sprig-pattern, not too gaudy. A\nwaterfall tie with a turquoise pin, and a cutaway coat of a soft\nbottle-green, completed him for the eyes of the public, and--for which\nhe cared far more--certain especially private eyes.\n\nChristopher, feeling himself thus attired, and receiving the silent\napproval of his glass, stole downstairs in a very clever way, and took\nfrom his own private cupboard a whip of white pellucid whalebone,\nsilver-mounted, and set with a large and radiant Cairngorm pebble. His\nmother had given him this on his very last birth-day, and he had never\nused it, wisely fearing to be laughed at. But now he tucked it under\nhis arm, and swaggering as he had seen hussars do, turned into a\npassage leading to his private outlet.\n\nHugging himself upon all his skill, and feeling assured of grand\nsuccess, Kit allowed his heels to clank, and carried his head with an\narrogant twist. And so, near a window, where good light came in large\nquantity from the garden, he marched into his mother's arms.\n\n\"Kit!\" cried his mother; and he said, \"Yes,\" being unable to deny that\ntruth. His mother looked at him, and his jaunty whip, and particularly\nlively suit of clothes; and she knew that he had been telling lies to\nher by the hundred or the bushel; and she would have been very glad to\nscorn him, if she could have helped being proud of him. Kit was unable\nto carry on any more in the way of falsehood. He tried to look fierce,\nbut his mother laughed; and he saw that he must knock under.\n\n\"My dear boy,\" she said, for the moment daring to follow up her\ntriumph, \"is this the costume in which you go forth to fish in the\nmost outlandish places, with the yellow ooze above your knees? And is\nthat your fishing-rod? Oh, Kit!--come, Kit, now you are caught at\nlast!\"\n\n\"My dear mother, I have told you stories; but I will leave off at\nlast. Now there is not one instant to explain. I have not so much as a\nmoment to spare. If you only could guess how important it is, you\nwould draw in your cloak in a moment. You never shall know another\nsingle word, unless you have the manners, mother, to pull in your\ncloak and let me go by.\"\n\n\"Kit, you may go. When you look at me like that, you may as well do\nanything. You have gone by your mother for ever so long; or at any\nrate gone away from her.\"\n\nWith these words, Mrs. Sharp made way for her son to pass her; and\nKit, in a reckless manner, was going to take advantage of it; then he\nturned back his face, to say goodbye, and his mother's eyes were away\nfrom him. She could not look at him, because she knew that her look\nwould pain him; but she held out her hand; and he took it and kissed\nit; and then he made off as hard as he could go.\n\nMrs. Sharp turned back, and showed some hankering to run after him;\nand then she remembered what a laugh would arise in Cross Duck Lane to\nsee such sport; and so she sighed a heavy sigh--knowing how long she\nmust have to wait--and retired to her own thoughtful corner, with no\nheart left for shopping.\n\nBut Kit saw that now it was \"neck or nothing;\" with best foot foremost\nhe made his way through back lanes leading towards the conscientious\nobscurity of Worcester College--for Beaumont Street still abode in the\nfuture--and skirting the coasts of Jericho, dangerously hospitable, he\nemerged at last in broad St. Giles', without a stone to prate of his\nwhereabouts. Here he went into livery stables, where he was well\nknown, and found the cob Sam at his service; for no university man\nwould ride him (even upon Hobson's choice) because of his ignominious\naspect. But Kit knew his value, and his lasting powers, and sagacious\ngratitude; and whenever he wanted a horse trustworthy in patience,\nobedience, and wit, he always took brown Sam. To Sam it was a treat to\ncarry Kit, because of the victuals ordered at almost every lenient\nstage; and the grand largesse of oats and beans was more than he could\nget for a week in stable. And so he set forth, with a spirited neigh,\non the Kidlington road, to cross the Cherwell, and make his way\ntowards Weston. The heart of Christopher burned within him whenever he\nthought of his mother; but a man is a man for all that, and cannot be\ntied to apron-strings. So Kit shook his whip, and the Cairngorm\nflashed in the sun, and the spirit of youth did the same. He was\ncertain to see the sweet maid to-day, knowing her manners and customs,\nand when she was ordered forth for her mossy walk upon the margin of\nthe wood.\n\nThe soft sun hung in the light of the wood, as if he were guided by\nthe breeze and air; and gentle warmth flowed through the alleys, where\nthe nesting pheasant ran. Little fluttering, timid things, that meant\nto be leaves, please God, some day, but had been baffled and beaten\nabout so, that their faith was shrunk to hope; little rifts of cover\nalso keeping beauty coiled inside, and ready to open, like a bivalve\nshell, to the pulse of the summer-tide, and then to be sweet blossom;\nand the ground below them pressing upward with ambition of young\ngreen; and the sky above them spread with liquid blue behind white\npillows.\n\nBut these things are not well to be seen without just entering into\nthe wood; and in doing so there can be no harm, with the light so\ninviting, and the way so clear. Grace had a little idea that perhaps\nshe had better stop outside the wood, but still that walk was within\nher bounds, and her orders were to take exercise; and she saw some\nvery pretty flowers there; and if they would not come to her, she had\nnothing to do but to go to them. Still she ought to have known that\nnow things had changed from what they were as little as a week ago;\nthat a dotted veil of innumerable buds would hang between her and the\ngood Miss Patch, while many forward trees were casting quite a shade\nof mystery. Nevertheless, she had no fear. If anybody did come near\nher, it would only be somebody thoroughly afraid of her. For now she\nknew, and was proud to know, that Kit was the prey of her bow and\nspear.\n\nWhether she cared for him, or not, was a wholly different question.\nBut in her dismal dullness and long, wearisome seclusion, the finest\npossible chance was offered for any young gentleman to meet her, and\nmake acquaintance of nature's doing. At first she had kept this to\nherself, in dread of conceit and vanity; but when it outgrew accident,\nshe told \"Aunt Patch\" the whole affair, and asked what she was to do\nabout it. Thereupon she was told to avoid the snares of childish\nvanity, to look at the back of her looking-glass, and never dare to\ndream again that any one could be drawn by her.\n\nHer young mind had been eased by this, although with a good deal of\npain about it; and it made her more venturesome to discover whether\nthe whole of that superior estimate of herself was true. Whether she\nwas so entirely vain or stupid, whenever she looked at herself; and\nwhether it was so utterly and bitterly impossible that anybody should\ncome--as he said--miles and miles for the simple pleasure of looking,\nfor one or two minutes, at herself.\n\nGrace was quite certain that she had no desire to meet anybody, when\nshe went into the wood. She hoped to be spared any trial of that sort.\nShe had been told on the highest authority, that nobody could come\nlooking after her--the assertion was less flattering perhaps than\nreassuring; and, to test its truth, she went a little further than she\nmeant to go.\n\nSuddenly at a corner, where the whole of the ground fell downward, and\ngrass was overhanging grass so early in the season, and sapling shoots\nfrom the self-same stool stood a yard above each other, and down in\nthe hollow a little brook sang of its stony troubles to the whispering\nreeds--here Grace Oglander happened to meet a very fine young man\nindeed. The astonishment of these two might be seen, at a moment's\nglance, to be mutual. The maiden, by gift of nature, was the first to\nexpress it, with dress, and hand, and eye. She showed a warm eagerness\nto retire; yet waited half a moment for the sake of proper dignity.\n\nKit looked at her with a clear intuition that now was his chance of\nchances to make certain-sure of her. If he could only now be strong,\nand take her consent for granted, and so induce her to set seal to it,\nshe never would withdraw; and the two might settle the rest at their\nleisure.\n\nHe loved the young lady with all his heart; and beyond that he knew\nnothing of her, except that she was worthy. But she had not given her\nheart as yet; and, with natural female common sense, she would like to\nknow a great deal more about him before she said too much to him. Also\nin her mind--if not in her heart--there was a clearer likeness of a\nvery different man--a man who was a man in earnest, and walked with a\nstronger and firmer step, and lurked behind no corners.\n\n\"This path is so extremely narrow,\" Miss Oglander said, with a very\npretty blush, \"and the ground is so steep, that I fear I must put you\nto some little inconvenience. But if I hold carefully by this branch,\nperhaps there will be room for you to pass.\"\n\n\"You are most kind and considerate,\" he answered, as if he were in\nperil of a precipice; \"but I would not for the world give you such\ntrouble. And I don't want to go any further now. It cannot matter in\nthe least, I do assure you.\"\n\n\"But surely you must have been going somewhere. You are most polite.\nBut I cannot think for one moment of turning you back like this.\"\n\n\"Then, may I sit down? I feel a little tired; and the weather has\nsuddenly become so warm. Don't you think it is very trying?\"\n\n\"To people who are not very strong perhaps it is. But surely it ought\nnot to be so to you.\"\n\n\"Well, I must not put all the blame upon the weather. There are so\nmany other things much worse. If I could only tell you.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am so very sorry, Mr. Sharp. I had no idea you had such\ntroubles. It must be so sad for you, while you are so young.\"\n\n\"Yes, I suppose many people call me young. And perhaps to the outward\neye I am so. But no one except myself can dream of the anxieties that\nprey upon me.\"\n\nChristopher, by this time, was growing very crafty, as the above\nspeech of his will show. The paternal gift was awaking within him, but\nsoftened by maternal goodness; so that it was not likely to be used\nwith much severity. And now, at the end of his speech, he sighed, and\nwithout any thought laid his right hand on the rich heart of his\nvelvet waistcoat, where beautiful forget-me-nots were blooming out of\nwillow leaves. Then Grace could not help thinking how that\ntrouble-worn right hand had been uplifted in her cause, and had\ndescended on the rabbit-man. And although she was most anxious to\ndiscourage the present vein of thought, she could not suppress one\nlittle sigh--sweeter music to the ear of Kit than ever had been played\nor dreamed.\n\n\"Now, would you really like to know?--you are so wonderfully good,\" he\ncontinued, with his eyes cast down, and every possible appearance of\nexcessive misery; \"would you, I mean, do your best, not only not to be\noffended, but to pity and forgive me, if, or rather supposing that, I\nwere to endeavour to explain, what--what it is, who--who she is--no,\nno, I do not quite mean that. I scarcely know how to express myself.\nThings are too many for me.\"\n\n\"Oh, but you must not allow them to be so, Mr. Sharp; indeed, you\nmustn't. I am sure that you must have a very good mother, from what\nyou told me the other day; and if you have done any harm, though I\nscarcely can think such a thing of you, the best and most\nstraightforward course is to go and tell your mother everything; and\nthen it is so nice afterwards.\"\n\n\"Yes, to be sure. How wise you are! You seem to know almost\neverything. I never saw any one like you at all. But the fact is that\nI am a little too old; I am obliged now to steer my own course in\nlife. My mother is as good as gold, and much better; but she never\ncould understand my feelings.\"\n\n\"Then come in, and tell my dear old Aunt Patch. She is so virtuous,\nand she always never doubts about anything; she sees the right thing\nto be done in a moment, and she never listens to arguments. If you\nwill only come in and see her, it might be such a relief to you.\"\n\n\"You seem to mistake me altogether,\" cried the young man, with his\npatience gone. \"What good could any old aunts do to me? Surely you\nknow who it is that I want!\"\n\n\"How can I imagine that?\"\n\n\"Why, you, only you, only you, sweet Grace! I should like to see the\nwhole earth swallowed up, if only you and I were left together!\"\n\nGrace Oglander blushed at the power of his words, and the pressure of\nhis hand on hers. Then, having plenty of her father's spirit, she\nfixed her bright sensible eyes on his face, so that he saw that he had\nbetter stop. \"I am afraid that it is no good,\" he said.\n\n\"I am very much obliged to you,\" answered Grace, with her fair cheeks\nfull of colour, and her hands drawn carefully back to her sides; \"but\nwill you be kind enough to stand up, and let me speak for a moment. I\nbelieve that you are very good, and I may say very harmless, and you\nhave helped me in the very kindest way, and I never shall forget your\ngoodness. Ever since you came, I am sure, I have been glad to think of\nyou; and your dogs, and your gun, and your fishing-rod reminded me of\nmy father; and I am very, very sorry, that what you have just said\nwill prevent me from thinking any more about you, or coming anywhere,\ninto any kind of places, where there are trees like this, again. I\nought to have done it--at least, I mean, I never ought to have done it\nat all; but I did think that you were so nice; and now you have\nundeceived me. I know who your father is very well, although I have\nseldom seen him; and though I dislike the law, I declare that would\nnot have mattered very much to me. But you do not even know my name,\nas several times you have proved to me; and how you can ride thirty\nmiles from Oxford, in all sorts of weather, without being tired, and\nyour dogs so fresh, has always been a puzzle to me.\"\n\n\"Thirty miles from Oxford!\" Christopher Sharp cried, in great\namazement; for in the very lowest condition of the heart figures will\nmaintain themselves.\n\n\"Yes; thirty miles, or thirty leagues. Sometimes I hear one thing, and\nsometimes the other.\"\n\n\"Where you are standing now is about seven miles and three-quarters\nfrom Summer-town gate!\"\n\n\"Surely, Mr. Sharp, you are laughing at me! How far am I from Beckley,\nthen, according to your calculation?\"\n\n\"How did you ever hear of Beckley? It is quite a little village. A\nmiserable little place!\"\n\n\"Indeed, then, it is not. It is the very finest place in all the\nworld; or at any rate the nicest, and the dearest, and the prettiest!\"\n\n\"But how can you, just come from America, have such an opinion of such\na little hole?\"\n\n\"A little hole! Why, it stands on a hill! You never can have been near\nit, if you think of calling it a 'hole!' And as for my coming from\nAmerica, you seem to have no geography. I have never been further away\nfrom darling Beckley, to my knowledge, than I am now.\"\n\nKit Sharp looked at her with greater amazement than that with which\nshe looked at him. And then with one accord they spied a fat man\ncoming along the hollow, and trying not to glance at them. With keen\nyoung instinct they knew that this villain was purely intent upon\nwatching them.\n\n\"Come again, if you please, to-morrow,\" said Grace, while pretending\nto gaze at the clouds; \"you have told me such things that I never\nshall sleep. Come earlier, and wait for me. Not that you must think\nanything; only that now you are bound, as a gentleman, to go on with\nwhat you were telling me.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\n\nTHE DIGNITY OF THE FAMILY.\n\n\nIf Grace had only stayed five minutes longer in the place where she\nwas when the fat man came in sight, her eyes and heart would have been\ndelighted by the appearance of a true old friend. But she felt so much\nterror of that stout person, who always seemed to be watching her\nafar, that in spite of the extraordinary interest aroused by some of\nher companion's words, as well as by his manner, she could not help\nrunning away abruptly, and taking shelter in the little bowered\ncottage.\n\nMeanwhile, the stout man in the white frock coat slouched along the\nfurzy valley, with a clownish step. He carried a long pig-whip, and\nnow and then indulged in a crack or flick at some imaginary pig, while\na crafty grin, or a wink of one little eye, enlivened his heavy\ncountenance. He was clearly aware of all that had been happening in\nthe wood above him, for the buds as yet rather served to guide the\nlines of sight than to baffle them; but he showed no desire to\ninterfere, for instead of taking the cross-path, which would have\nbrought him face to face with Kit, he kept down the glade towards the\ntimber-track, which led in another direction. By the side of the\nlittle brook he turned the corner of a thick holly-bush, and suddenly\nmet his brother, Master Zacchary Cripps, the Carrier.\n\nThe Carrier was in no pleasant mood; his eyes were stern and\nsteadfast, and the colour of his healthy cheeks was deepened into\ncrimson. He bore with a bent arm and set muscle the sceptral whip of\nthe family, bound with spiral brass, and newly fitted with a heavy\nlash. Moreover, he had come with his Sunday hat on, and his air and\nwalk were menacing. Leviticus started and turned pale, and his cunning\neyes glanced for a chance of escape.\n\n\"Thou goest not hence, Brother Tickuss,\" said Cripps, \"until thou hast\nanswered what I shall ax, and answered with thine eyes on mine.\"\n\n\"Ax away,\" said the pigman, sprawling out his fat legs, as if he did\nnot care; \"ax away, so long as it be of thy own consarns.\"\n\n\"It is of my own consarns to keep my father's sons from being rogues\nand liars, and getting into Oxford jail, and into the hands of the\nhangman.\"\n\nLeviticus trembled, with fear more than anger. \"Thou always was\nfoul-mouthed,\" he muttered.\n\n\"It is a lie!\" shouted Zacchary; \"as big a lie as ever thou spak'st! I\nalways were that clean of tongue--no odds for that now. Wilt answer\nme, or will not? Thou liedst to me in Oxford streets the last time as\nI spake to thee.\"\n\n\"Well, well, maybe a small piece I did; but nothing to lay hold on\nmuch. Brother Zak, thou must not be so hard. What man can be always\narkerate?\"\n\n\"A man can spake the truth if he goeth to try, or else a must be a\nfule. And, Tickuss, thou wast always more rogue than fule. And now\nhere am I, to ax thee spashal what roguery thou beest up to now? Whom\nhast thou got at the cottage in the wood?\"\n\n\"Thou'd best way go up there, and see for thyzell. A old lady from\nAmerikay as wanteth to retaire frout the world. Won't her zend thee\na-running down the hill? Ah, and I'd like to see thee, Zak. Her'd lay\nthy own whip about thee; and her tongue be worse nor a dozen whips!\"\n\nReally, while Tickuss was telling this lie, he managed to look at his\nbrother so firmly, in the rally of impudence brought to bay, that Zak\nfor the moment (in spite of all experience) believed him. And the\nCarrier dreaded--as the lord of swine knew well--nothing so much as a\nfierce woman's tongue.\n\n\"What be the reason, then,\" he went on, still keeping his eyes on the\nface of Tickuss, \"that thou hast been keeping thyself and thy pigs out\no' market, and even thy waife and children to home, same as if 'em had\ngotten the plague? And what be the reason, Leviticus Cripps, that thou\nfearest to go to a wholesome public-house, and have thy pint of ale,\nand see thy neighbours, as behooveth a God-fearing man? To my mind,\neither thou art gone daft, and the woman should take the lead o' thee,\nor else thou art screwed out of honest ways.\"\n\nThe Carrier now looked at his brother, with more of pity than\nsuspicion. Tickuss had always been regarded as the weak member of the\nfamily, because he laid on more fat than muscle, even in the time of\nmost active growth. And to keep him regularly straight was more than\nall the set efforts of the brotherhood could, even when he was young,\neffect. Therefore Zak stood back some little, and the butt of his whip\nfell down to earth. Leviticus saw his chance, and seized it.\n\n\"Consarning of goin' to public-house, I would never be too particular.\nA man may do it, or a man may not, according to manner of his things\nat home, or his own little brew, or the temper of his wife. I would\nnot blame him, nor yet praise him, for things as he knoweth best\nabout. To make light of a man for not going to public, is the same as\nto blame him for stopping from church. A man as careth for good\nopinion goeth to both, but a cannot always do it. And I ain't a been\nin church now for more nor a week of Sundays.\"\n\nThe force of this reasoning came home to Cripps. If a man was unable\nto go to church, there was good room for arguing that his duty towards\nthe public-house must not be too rigidly exacted. Zacchary therefore\nfetched a sigh. None of the race had broken up at so early an age as\nthat of Tickuss. But still, from his own sad experience, the Carrier\nknew what pigs were; and he thought that his brother, though younger\nthan himself, might be called away before him.\n\n\"Tickuss,\" he said, \"I may a' been too hard. Nobody knows but them\nthat has to do it what the worrit of the roads is. I may a' said a\nword here and there too much, and a bit outside the Gospel. According\nto they a man must believe a liar, and forgive un, and forgive un over\nand over again, the same as I tries to forgive you, Tickuss.\"\n\nZacchary offered his hand to his brother, but Leviticus was ashamed to\ntake it. With the load now weighing upon his mind, and the sense in\nhis heart of what Zacchary was, Tickuss--whatever his roguery\nwas--could not make believe to have none of it. So he turned away,\nwith his feelings hurt too much for the clasp fraternal.\n\n\"When a man hath no more respect for hiszell,\" he muttered over his\npuckered shoulder, \"and no more respect for his father and mother\navore un, than to call his very next brother but one a rogue and a\nliar, and a schemer against publics, to my mind he have gone too far,\nand not shown the manners relied upon.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" replied Cripps; \"just as you like, Tickuss; though I\nnever did hear as I were short of manners; and there's twelve mailes\nof road as knows better than that. Now, since you go on like that, and\nthere seemeth no chance of supper 'long of 'ee, I shall just walk up\nto cottage, and ax any orders for the Carrier. Good evening, brother\nTickuss.\"\n\nWith these words Zak set off, and Tickuss repented sadly of the evil\ntemper which had forbidden him to shake hands. But now to oppose the\nCarrier's purpose would be a little too suspicious. He must go his way\nand take his chance; he was worse than a pig when his mind was made\nup.\n\n\"Go thy way, and be danged to thee!\" thought Leviticus, looking after\nhim. \"Little thou wilt take, however, but to knock thy thick head\nagain' a wall. Old lady looketh out too sharp for any of they danged\nold Beckley carcases. Come thee down to our ouze,\" he shouted in irony\nafter his brother, \"and tell us the noos thou hast picked up, and what\n'em be doing in Amerikay! A vine time o' life for thee to turn spy!\"\n\nIt was lucky for him that he made off briskly among thick brushwood\nand tangled swamps, for Zacchary Cripps at the last word turned round,\nwith his face of a fine plum-colour, and a stamp of rage which made\nhis stiff knees tingle worse than a dozen turnpikes.\n\n\"Spy, didst thou say?\" he shouted, staring, with his honest, wrathful\neyes, through every glimpse of thicket near the spot where his brother\nhad disappeared--\"Spy! if thou beest a man come out, and say it again\nto the face of me! I'll show thee how to spell 'spy' pretty quick.\nLeviticus Cripps, thou art a coward, to the back of a thief and a\nsneaking skulk, unless thou comest out of they thick places, to stand\nto the word thou hast spoken.\"\n\nZacchary stood in a wide bay of copse, and he knew that his voice went\nthrough the wood; for he spoke with the whole power of his lungs; and\nthe tender leaves above him quivered like a little breath of fringe,\nand the birds flew out of their ivy castles, and a piece of bare-faced\nrock in the distance answered him--but nothing else.\n\n\"Thou art a bigger man than I be,\" shouted the Carrier, being carried\nbeyond himself by the state of things; \"come out if thou art a man,\nand hast any blood of Cripps in thee!\" But this appeal received no\nanswer, except from the quiet rock again, and a peaceful thrush\nsitting over his nest, and well accustomed to the woodman's call.\n\nZacchary had always felt scorn of Tickuss, but now he almost disdained\nhimself for springing of one wedlock with him. He stood in the place\nwhere he must be seen if Tickuss wished to see him, until he was quite\nsure that no such longing existed on his brother's part. Then the\nfamily seemed to be lowered so by this behaviour of a leading member,\nthat when the Carrier moved his legs, he had not the spirit to crack\nhis whip.\n\n\"What shall us do? Whatever shall us do?\" he said to himself more\nreasonably, with the anger dying out of his kind blue eyes. \"A hath\ninsulted of me, but a hath a big family of little uns to kape up. I\nharn't had no knowledge how that zort o' thing may drive a man out of\nhis proper ways. Like enough it maketh them careful to tell lies, and\nshun the thrashing.\"\n\nTaking this view of the case, Master Cripps turned away from the path\ntowards his brother's house, to which, in the flush of first anger, he\nmeant to go, and there to wait for him; and being rather slow of\nresolution, he naturally set forth again on the track of the one last\ninterrupted. He would go to this cottage in the wood of which he had\nheard through one of his washerwomen--though none of them had any\nwashing thence--and then he would satisfy his own mind concerning an\nugly rumour, which had unsettled that mind since Tuesday. For in his\nown hearing it had been said--by a woman, it is true, but still a\nwoman who came of a truthful family, and was married now into the\nlike--that Master Leviticus Cripps was harbouring pirates and\nconspirators, believed to have come from America, in a little place\nout of the way of all honest people, where the deaf old woman was.\nNobody ever had leave to the house; never a butcher, nor baker, nor\ntea-grocer, nor a milkman, nor even a respectable washerwoman--there\nwas nothing except a great dog to rush out and bite without even\nbarking.\n\nZacchary had no easy task to find the little cottage of which he had\nheard, for it lay well back from all thoroughfares, and so embedded\namong ivied trees, that he passed and re-passed several times before\nhe descried it; and even then he would not have done so if it had not\nchanced that Miss Patch, who loved good things when she could get\nthem, was about to dine on a juicy roaster, supplied by the wary\nLeviticus. Grace herself had prepared the currant sauce, before she\nwent forth for her daily walk, and deaf old Margery Daw was stooping\nover the fierce wood fire on the ground, and basting with a short iron\nspoon. The double result was a wreath of blue smoke rising from the\ncrooked chimney, and a very rich odour streaming forth from door and\nwindow on the vernal air. The eyes and the nose of the Carrier at once\npresented him with clear impressions.\n\n\"Amerikayans understands good living.\" Giving utterance to this\nprofound and incontrovertible reflection, Cripps came to a halt and\nsagely considered the situation. The first thing he asked, as usual,\nwas--\"How would the law of the land lie?\" Here was a lonely,\nunprotected cottage, inhabited by an elderly foreign lady, who\nespecially sought retirement. Had he any legal right to insist on\nknowing who she was, and all about her? Would he not rather be a\ntrespasser, and liable to a fine, and perhaps the jail, if he forced\nhimself in, without invitation and wilfully, against the inhabitants'\nwish? And even if that came to nothing--as it might--could he say that\nit was a manly and straightforward action on his part? He had no enemy\nthat he knew of, unless it was Black George, the poacher; but there\nwere always plenty of people ready to say ill-natured things about a\nprosperous neighbour; and like enough they would set it afoot that he\nhad gone spying on a helpless lady, because she had never employed\nhim. And then his brother's reproach, which had so fiercely aroused\nhim, came back to his mind.\n\nNeither was it wholly absent from his thoughts, that a great dog was\nsaid to reside on these premises, whose manner was the peculiarly\nunattractive one of rushing out to bite without a bark. The Carrier\nhad suffered in his time from dogs, as was natural to his calling; and\nalthough his flesh was so wholesome that the result had never been\nserious, he was conscious of a definite desire to defer all increase\nof experience in that line.\n\n\"Spy!\" he exclaimed, as he sat down rather to rest his stiff knee than\nto watch the hut. \"That never hath been said of me, and never shall\nwithout a lie. But one on 'em might come out, mayhap, and give me some\nzatisfaction.\"\n\nBefore his words were cool, Miss Patch herself appeared in the\ndoorway. She saw not Cripps, who had happened to put himself in a\nknowing corner; and being in a quietly savage mood (from desire of\npig, and dread that stupid old Margery was murdering pig, by revolving\nhim too near the fire), she cast such a glance at the young leaves\naround her, as seemed enough to nip them in the bud. Then she threw\naway something with a scornful sweep, and Cripps believed almost every\nword his brother had been saying.\n\n\"I'll be blessed if I don't scuttle off,\" he said to himself and the\nmoss he was sitting on. \"In my time I have a seen all zorts of womans,\nbut none to come nigh this sample as be come over from Amerikay!\nSarveth me right for cooriosity. Amend me if ever I come anigh of any\nAmerikayans again!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\n\nA TOMBSTONE.\n\n\nAre there any who do not quicken to the impulse of young life, lifted\nfree of long repression and the dread of dull relapse? Can we find a\nman or woman (holding almost any age) able to come out and meet the\nchallenge of the sun, conveyed in cartel of white clouds of May, and\nyet to stick to private sense of sulky wrongs and brooding hate?\n\nIf we could find such a man or woman (by great waste of labour, in a\nsearch ungracious), and if it should seem worth while to attempt to\ncure the case, scarcely anything could be thought of, leading more\ndirectly towards the end in view, than to fetch that person, and plant\nhim or her, without a word of explanation, among the flower-beds on\nthe little lawn of Beckley Barton.\n\nThe flowers themselves, and their open eyes, and the sparkling smile\nof the grass, and the untold commerce of the freighted bees, and rich\nvoluntaries of thrush and blackbird (ruffled to the throat with song);\nand over the whole the soft flow of sunshine, like a vast pervasive\nriver of gold, with silver wave of clouds--who could dwell on petty\naches and pains among such grandeur?\n\nThe old Squire sat in his bower-chair with a warm cloak over his\nshoulders. His age was threescore and ten this day; and he looked back\nthrough the length of years, and marvelled at their fleeting. The\nstirring times of his youth, and the daily perils of his prime of\nlife, the long hard battle, and the slow promotion--because he had\ngiven offence by some projection of honest opinion--the heavy\ndisappointment, and the forced retirement from the army when the wars\nwere over, with only the rank of Major, which he preferred to sink in\nSquire--because he ought to have been, according to his own view of\nthe matter, a good Lieutenant-general--and then a very short golden\nage of five years and a quarter, from his wedding-day to the death of\nhis wife, a single and sweet-hearted wife--and after that (as sorrow\nsank into the soothing breast of time) the soft, and gentle, and\nundreamed-of step of comfort, coming almost faster than was welcome,\nwhile his little daughter grew.\n\nAfter that the old man tried to think no more, but be content. To let\nthe little scenes of dancing, and of asking, and of listening, and of\nlooking puzzled, and of waiting to know truly whether all was\nearnest--because already childhood had suspicion that there might be\nthings intended to delude it--and of raising from the level of papa's\nwell-buttoned pocket, clear bright eyes that did not know a guinea\nfrom a halfpenny; and then, with the very extraordinary spring from\nthe elasticity of red calves (which happily departs right early), the\njumping into opened arms, and the laying on of little lips, and the\nmurmurs of delighted love--to let his recollections of all these die\nout, and to do without them, was this old man's business now.\n\nFor he had been convinced at last--strange as it may seem, until we\ncall to mind how the strongest convictions are produced by the weakest\nlogic--at last he could no longer hope to see his Grace again; because\nhe had beheld her tombstone. Having made up his mind to go to church\nthat very Sunday morning, in spite of all Widow Hookham could do to\nstop him, he had spied a new stone in the graveyard corner sacred to\nthe family of Oglander. The old man went up to see what it was, and\nnobody liked to follow him. And nobody was surprised that he did not\nshow his white head at the chancel-door; though the parson waited five\nminutes for him, being exceeding loth to waste ten lines, which he had\ninterlarded into a sermon of thirty years back, for the present sad\noccasion.\n\nFor the old Squire sat on his grandfather's tombstone (a tabular piece\nof memorial, suited to an hospitable man; where all his descendants\nmight sit around, and have their dinners served to them), and he\nleaned his shaven chin on the head of his stout oak staff, and he took\noff his hat, and let his white hair fall about. He fixed his still\nbright eyes on the tombstone of his daughter, and tried to fasten his\nmind there also, and to make out how old she was. He was angry with\nhimself for not being able to tell to a day without thinking; but\ndays, and years, and thoughts, and doings of quiet love quite slipping\nby, and spreading without ruffle, had left him little to lay hold of\nas a knotted record. Therefore he sat with his chin on his stick, and\nhad no sense of church-time, until the choir (which comprised seven\nCrippses) bellowed out an anthem, which must have shaken their\ngrandfathers in their graves; unless in their time they had done the\nsame.\n\nIn this great uproar and applause, which always travelled for half a\nmile, the Squire had made his escape from the graveyard; and then he\nhad gone home without a word and eaten his dinner, because he must\nwhen the due time came for it. And now, being filled with substantial\nfaith that his household was nicely enjoying itself, he was come to\nhis bower to think and wonder, and perhaps by-and-by to fall fast\nasleep, but never awake to bright hope again.\n\nTo this relief and mild incline of gentle age, his head was bowing and\nhis white hair settling down, according as the sun, or wind, or\nclouds, or time of day desired, when some one darkened half his light,\nand there stood Mary Hookham.\n\nMary had the newest of all new spring fashions on her head, and\nbreast, and waist, and everywhere. A truly spirited girl was she, as\nwell as a very handy one; and she never thought twice of a sixpence or\nshilling, if a soiled paper-pattern could be had for it. And now she\nwas busy with half a guinea, kindly beginning to form its impress on\nher moist hard-working palm.\n\n\"He have had a time of it!\" she exclaimed, as her master began to gaze\naround. \"Oh my, what a time of it he have had!\"\n\n\"Mary, I suppose you are talking of me. Yes, I have had a bad time on\nthe whole. But many people have had far worse.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. And will you see one who hath? As fine a young gentleman as\never lived; so ready to speak up for everybody, and walking like a\nstatute. It give me such a turn! I do believe you never would know\nhim, sir; without his name come in with him. Squire Overshute, sir, if\nyou please, requesteth the honour of seeing of you.\"\n\n\"Mary, I am hardly fit for it. I was doing my best to sit quite quiet,\nand to try to think of things. I am not as I was yesterday, or even as\nI was this morning. But if I ought to see him--why, I will. And\nperhaps I ought, no doubt, when I come to think of things. The poor\nyoung man has been very ill. To be sure, I remember all about it. Show\nhim where I am at once. What a sad thing for his mother! His mother is\na wonderful clever woman, of the soundest views in politics.\"\n\n\"His mother be dead, sir; I had better tell you for fear of begetting\nany trifles with him; although we was told to keep such things from\nyou. Howsomever, I do think he be coming to himself, or he would not\nhave fallen out of patience as a hath done; and now here he be, sir!\"\n\nRussel Overshute, narrowed and flattened into half of his proper size,\nand heightened thereby to unnatural stature--for stoop he would not,\nalthough so weak--here he was walking along the damp walk, when a bed,\nor a sofa, or a drawn-out chair at Shotover Grange, was his proper\nplace. He walked with the help of a crutch-handled stick, and his deep\nmourning dress made him look almost ghastly. His eyes, however, were\nbright and steady, and he made an attempt at a cheerful smile, as he\ncongratulated the Squire on the great improvement of his health.\n\n\"For that I have to thank you, my dear friend,\" answered Mr. Oglander;\n\"for weeks I had been helpless, till I helped myself; I mean, of\ncourse, by the great blessing of the Lord. But of your sad troubles,\nwhatever shall I say----\"\n\n\"My dear sir, say nothing, if you please--I cannot bear as yet to\nspeak of them. I ought to be thankful that life is spared to\nme--doubtless for some good purpose. And I think I know what that\npurpose is; though now I am confident of nothing.\"\n\n\"Neither am I, Russel, neither am I,\" said the old man, observing how\nlow his voice was, and speaking in a low sad voice himself. \"I used to\nhave confidence in the good will and watchful care of the Almighty\nover all who trust in Him. But now there is something over there\"--he\npointed towards the churchyard--\"which shows that we may carry such\nideas to a foolish point. But I cannot speak of it; say no more.\"\n\n\"I will own,\" replied Overshute, studying the Squire's downcast face,\nto see how far he might venture, \"at one time I thought that you\nyourself carried such notions to a foolish length. That was before my\nillness. Now, I most fully believe that you were quite right.\"\n\n\"Yes, I suppose that I was--so far as duty goes, and the parson's\nadvice. But as for the result--where is it?\"\n\n\"As yet we see none. But we very soon shall. Can you bear to hear\nsomething I want to say, and to listen to it attentively?\"\n\n\"I believe that I can, Russel. There is nothing now that can disturb\nme very much.\"\n\n\"This will disturb you, my dear sir, but in a very pleasant way, I\nhope. As sure as I stand and look at you here, and as sure as the\nAlmighty looks down at us both, that grave in Beckley churchyard holds\na gipsy-woman, and no child of yours! Ah! I put it too abruptly, as I\nalways do. But give me your arm, sir, and walk a few steps. I am not\nvery strong, any more than you are. But, please God, we will both get\nstronger, as soon as our troubles begin to lift.\"\n\nEach of them took the right course to get stronger, by putting forth\nhis little strength, to help and guide the other's steps.\n\n\"Russel, what did you say just now?\" Mr. Oglander asked, when the pair\nhad managed to get as far as another little bower, Grace's own, and\nthere sat down. \"I must have taken your meaning wrong. I am not so\nclear as I was, and often there is a noise inside my head.\"\n\n\"I told you, sir, that I had proved for certain that your dear\ndaughter has not been buried here--nor anywhere else, to my firm\nbelief. Also I have found out and established (to my own most bitter\ncost) who it was that lies buried here, and of what terrible disease\nshe died. As regards my own illness, I would go through it again--come\nwhat might come of it--for the sake of your darling Grace; but, alas!\nI have lost my own dear mother through this utterly fiendish plot--for\nsuch it is, I do believe! This poor girl buried here was the younger\nsister of Cinnaminta!\"\n\n\"Cinnaminta!\" said the Squire, trying to arouse old memory. \"Surely I\nhave heard that name. But tell me all, Russel; for God's sake, tell me\nall, and how you came to find it out, and what it has to do with my\nlost pet.\"\n\n\"My dear sir, if you tremble so I shall fear to tell you another word.\nRemember, it is all good, so far as it goes; instead of trembling you\nshould smile and rejoice.\"\n\n\"So I will--so I will; or at least I will try. There, now, look--I\nhave taken a pinch of snuff, you need have no fear for me after that.\"\n\n\"All I know beyond what I have told you is that your Gracie--and my\nGrace too--was driven off in a chaise and pair, through the narrow\nlanes towards Wheatley. I have not been able to follow the track in my\npresent helpless condition; and, indeed, what I know I only learned\nthis morning; and I thought it my duty to come and tell you at once. I\nhad it from poor Cinnaminta's own lips, who for a week or more had\nbeen lurking near the house to see me. This morning I could not resist\na little walk--lonely and miserable as it was--and the poor thing told\nme all she knew. She was in the deepest affliction herself at the loss\nof her only surviving child, and she fancied that I had saved his life\nbefore, and she had deep pangs of ingratitude, and of Nemesis, etc.;\nand hence she was driven to confess all her share; which was but a\nlittle one. She was tempted by the chance of getting money enough to\nplace her child in the care of a first-rate doctor.\"\n\n\"But Grace--my poor Grace!--how was she tempted--or was she forced\naway from me?\"\n\n\"That I cannot say as yet; Cinnaminta had no idea. She did not even\nsee the carriage; for she herself was borne off by her tribe, who were\nquite in a panic at the fever. But she heard that no violence was\nused, and there was a lady in the chaise; and poor Grace went quite\nreadily, though she certainly did seem to sob a little. It was no\nelopement, Mr. Oglander, nor anything at all of that kind. The poor\ngirl believed that she was acting under your orders in all she did;\njust as she had believed that same when she left her aunt's house to\nmeet you on the homeward road, through that forged letter, which, most\nunluckily, she put into her pocket. There, I believe I have told you\nall I can think of for the moment. Of course, you will keep the whole\nto yourself, for we have to deal with subtle brutes. Is there anything\nyou would like to ask?\"\n\n\"Russel Overshute,\" said the Squire, \"I am not fit to go into things\nnow; I mean all the little ins and outs. And you look so very ill, my\ndear fellow, I am quite ashamed of allowing you to talk. Come into the\nhouse and have some nourishment. If any man ever wanted it, you do\nnow. How did you come over?\"\n\n\"Well, I broke a very ancient vow. If there is anything I detest it is\nto see a young man sitting alone inside of a close carriage. But we\nnever know what we may come to. I tried to get upon my horse, but\ncould not. By the bye, do you know Hardenow?\"\n\n\"Not much,\" said the Squire; \"I have seen him once or twice, and I\nknow that he is a great friend of yours. He is one of the new lights,\nis not he?\"\n\n\"I am sure I don't know, or care. He is a wonderfully clever fellow,\nand as true as steel, and a gentleman. He has heard of course of your\nsad trouble, but only the popular account of it. He does not even know\nof my feelings--but I will not speak now of them----\"\n\n\"You may, my dear fellow, with all my heart. You have behaved like a\ntrue son to me; and if ever a gracious Providence----\"\n\nOvershute took Mr. Oglander's hand, and held it in silence for a\nmoment; he could not bear the idea of even the faintest appearance of\na bargain now. The Squire understood, and liked him all the better,\nand waved his left hand towards the dining-room.\n\n\"One thing more, while we are alone,\" resumed the young man, much as\nhe longed for, and absolutely needed, good warm victuals; \"Hardenow is\na tremendous walker; six miles an hour are nothing to him; the 'Flying\nDutchman' he is called, although he hasn't got a bit of calf. Of\ncourse, I would not introduce him into this matter without your leave.\nBut may I tell him all, and send him scouting, while you and I are so\nlaid upon the shelf? He can go where you and I could not, and nobody\nwill suspect him. And, of course, as regards intelligence alone, he is\nworth a dozen of that ass John Smith; at any rate, he would find no\nmare's nests. May I try it? If so, I will take on the carriage to\nOxford, as soon as I have had a bit to eat.\"\n\n\"With all my heart,\" cried the Squire, whose eyes were full again of\nlife and hope. \"Hardenow owes a debt to Beckley. It was Cripps who got\nhim his honours and fellowship--or at least the Carrier says so; and\nwe all believe our Carrier. And after all, whatever there is to do,\nnobody does it like a gentleman, and especially a good scholar. I\nremember a striking passage in the syntax of the Eton Latin grammar. I\nmake no pretension to learning when I quote it, for it hath been\nquoted in the House of Lords. Perhaps you remember it, my dear\nRussel.\"\n\n\"My Latin has turned quite rusty, Squire,\" answered Overshute,\nknowing, as well as Proteus, what was coming.\n\n\"The passage is this,\"--Mr. Oglander always smote his frilled shirt,\nin this erudition, and delivered, _ore rotundo_--\n\n    \"Scilicet ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes,\n      Emollit mores, nec sinit esse feros.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL.\n\nLET ME OUT.\n\n\nAt about the same hour of that Sunday afternoon, Miss Patch sat alone\nin her little cottage, stubbornly reasoning with herself. She was\ngrowing rather weary of her task, which had been a long and heavy one;\na great deal longer, and a great deal heavier, than she ever could\nhave dreamed at the outset. It was for the sake of the kingdom of\nheaven that she had laid her hand to this plough; and now it seemed\nlikely to be a \"plough,\" in the sense in which that word is lightly\nused by undergraduates.\n\nFor public opinion Miss Patch cared nothing. Her view of the world was\npurely and precisely \"Scriptural,\" according to her own\ninterpretation. Any line of action was especially recommended to her\nby the certainty that \"the world\" would condemn it. She had led a life\nof misery with her father, the gambling captain, the man of fashion,\nwho made slaves of his children; and being already of a narrow gauge\nof mind, she laid herself out for theology; not true religion, but\nenough to please her, and make her sure that she was always right.\n\nGrace, being truly of a docile nature, and most unsuspicious (as her\nfather was before her), had implicit faith in the truth and honour of\nher good Aunt Patch. She looked upon her as so devoutly pious and\ngrandly upright, that any idea of fraud on her part seemed almost\nprofanity. She believed the good lady to be acting wholly under the\nguidance of her own father, and as his representative; in which there\nseemed nothing either strained or strange, especially as the Squire\nhad once placed his daughter in the charge of Miss Patch, for a course\nof Scriptural and historical reading. And the first misgiving in the\npoor girl's mind arose from what Christopher Sharp had told her. Of\npining and lonely weariness, weeks and weeks she had endured, under\nthe firm belief that her father was compelled to have it so, and in\nthe hope of the glorious time when he should come to take her home.\nFor all that she could see good reason--according to what she had been\ntold--but she could see no reason whatever why Miss Patch should have\ntold her falsehoods as to the place in which they lived. Having been\nchallenged upon this subject by her indignant niece, the elderly lady\nnow sat thinking. She was as firmly convinced as ever, that in all she\nhad done, she had acted strictly and purely for the glory of the Lord.\nGrace, a great heiress, and a silly girl, was at the point of being\nsnapped up by the papists, and made one of them; whereupon both an\nimmortal soul and \u00c2\u00a3150,000 would be devoted to perdition. Of this Miss\nPatch had been thoroughly assured before she would give her help at\nall. It was well known that Russel Overshute loved and would win Grace\nOglander, and that Russel's dearest friend was Hardenow of Brasenose,\nand that Hardenow was the deepest Jesuit ever admitted to holy orders\nin the Church of England; therefore, at heart, Russel Overshute must\nbe a papist of the deepest dye; and anybody with half an eye could see\nthrough that conspiracy. To defeat such a scheme, Miss Patch would\nhave promised to spend six months in a hollow tree; but promise and\nperformance are a \"very different pair of shoes;\" and the lady (though\nfed, like a woodpecker, on the choicest of all sylvan food) even now,\nin four months' time, was tiring of her martyrdom.\n\nHer cottage in a wood had long been growing loathsome to her. The\ndeeds of the Lord she admired greatly, when they were homicidal; but\nof His large and kindly works she had no congenial liking. The\nfluttering spread of leaves, that hang like tips of empty gloves one\nday, and after one kind night lift forth (like the hand of a baby with\nhis mind made up), and the change of colour all under the trees,\nwhether the ground be grassed or naked; also the delicate sliding of\nthe light in and out the peeling wands of brush-wood, and flat upon\nthe lichened stones, and even in the coarsest hour of the day--which\ngenerally is from 1 to 2 p.m., when all mankind are dining--the quiet\nspread and receptive width of growth that has to catch its light--for\nnone of these pretty little scenes did Miss Patch care so much as half\na patch. And she was sure that they gave her the rheumatism.\n\nShe was longing to be in London now, to sit beneath the noble\neloquence of preachers and orators most divine, who spend the prime of\nthe year in reviling their friends and extolling the negro. Whereas\nfor weeks and weeks, in this ungodly forest, she had no chance of\nreceiving any spiritual ministration; save once, when Tickuss, on a\nSunday morning, had driven her in his pig-cart to a little Wesleyan\nchapel some three miles off at the end of a hamlet. Here people stared\nat her so, and asked such questions, that she durst not go again; and,\nindeed, the pleasure was not worth the risk, for the shoemaker who\npreached was a thoroughly quiet, ungifted man, without an evil word\nfor anybody.\n\nNot only these large regrets and yearnings were thronging upon this\nlady now, but also a small although feminine feeling of desire for\nsupport and guidance. Strong-minded as she was, and conscious of her\nlofty mission, from time to time she grew faint-hearted in that dreary\nsolitude, without the encouragement of the cool male will. This for\nsome days she had not received, and she knew not why it had failed\nher.\n\nThough the afternoon was so bright with temptation, the wood so rich\nwith wonders, Miss Patch preferred to nurse her knee by the little\nfire in her parlour. She had always hated to be out of doors, and to\nsee too much of things which did not bear out her opinions, and to\nlose that clear knowledge of the will of the Lord which is lost by\nthose who study Him. She loved to discern in everything that happened\nto her liking \"the grand and infinite potentiality of an all-wise\nProvidence;\" and, if a little thing went amiss, she laid all the blame\nto the badly principled interference of the devil.\n\nWhile she was deeply pondering thus, and warming her little teapot, in\nran the beautiful and lively girl, who had long been growing too much\nfor her. It was not only the brighter spring of young life in this\nGracie, and her pretty ways, and nice surprises, and pleasure in\npleasing others, and graceful turns of cookery, but also her pure\nfount of loving-kindness which (having no other way out) was obliged\nto steal around Miss Patch herself. Although she had been ill-content\nwith the only explanation she could get about her dwelling-place--to\nwit, that in these roadless parts distance was very much a matter of\nconjecture--Grace had no suspicion yet of any plot or conspiracy. All\nthings had been planned so deeply, and carried out so cleverly, that\nany such suspicion would have been contrary to her nature. She had\nlost, by some unaccountable carelessness, both the note from her\nfather, which she had received at her Aunt Joan's, and also his more\nimportant letter delivered to her, when she met the chaise, by her\nkind and pious \"Aunty Patch.\" In the first note (delivered by a little\nboy) she had simply been called forth to meet her father in the lane,\nand to walk home with him, as he wished to speak with her by herself.\nShe was not to wait to pack any of her clothes, as they would be sent\nfor afterwards; and he hoped her Aunt Joan would excuse his deferring\ntheir little dinner for the present.\n\nBut when, instead of meeting him, she found the chaise with Miss Patch\ninside it, and was invited to step in, a real letter was handed to\nher, the whole of which in the waning light--the day being very brown\nand gloomy--she could not easily make out. But she learned enough to\nsee that she was to place herself under the care of Miss Patch, and\nnot expect to see her dear father for at least some weeks to come. Her\nhair, for the reason therein given, was to be cut off at once, and not\neven kept in the carriage; and the poor girl submitted, with a few low\nsobs, to the loss of her beautiful bright tresses. But what were they?\nHow small and selfish of her to think twice of them in the presence of\nthe heavy trouble threatening her dear father, and the anguish of\nlosing him for so long, without even so much as a kiss of farewell!\nFor, after his first brief scrawl, he had found that, by starting at\nonce, he could catch at Falmouth the packet for Demerara, and thus\nsave a fortnight in getting to his estates, which were threatened with\nruin. If these should be lost to him, Gracie knew (as he had no\nsecrets from her) that half his income would go at one sweep--which,\nfor his own sake, would matter little; but, for the sake of his\ndarling, must, if possible, be prevented.\n\nHe had no time now for another word, except that he had left his house\nat Beckley, just as it stood, to be let by his agent, to cover the\nexpenses of this long voyage, and to get him out of two difficulties.\nHe could not have left his dear child there alone; and, if he could,\nhe would not have done so, for a most virulent fever had long been\nhanging about, and had now broken out hard by; and Dr. Splinters had\nstrictly ordered, the moment he heard of it, that the dear child's\nhair should be cropped to her head, and burned or cast away, for\nnothing harboured infection as hair did. With a few words of blessing,\nand comfort, and love, and a promise to write from Demerara, and a\nfatherly hope that for his sake she would submit to Miss Patch in all\nthings, and make the most of this opportunity for completing her\ncourse of Scriptural and historical reading, the dear old father had\nsigned himself her \"loving papa, W. O.\"\n\nGrace would have been a very different girl from her own frank self,\nif she had even dreamed of suspecting the genuineness of this letter.\nIt was in her father's crabbed, and upright, and queerly-jointed hand,\nfrom the first line to the last. For a moment, indeed, she had been\nsurprised that he called himself her \"papa,\" because he did not like\nthe word, and thought it a piece of the foreign stuff which had better\ncontinue to be foreign. But there stood the word; and in his hurry how\ncould he stop to such trifles? This letter had been lost; poor Grace\ncould not imagine how, because she had taken such great care of it,\nand had slept with it under her pillow always. Nevertheless, it had\ndisappeared, leaving tears of self-reproach in her downcast eyes, as\nshe searched the wood for it. And this made her careful tenfold of the\ntwo letters she had received from George-town.\n\nBut now, as she came with her Sunday hat on, and her pretty Woodstock\ngloves, and her neat brown skirt looped up (for challenge of briers,\nand furze, and dog-rose), and, best of all, with the bloom on her\ncheeks, and the sparkle in her clear soft eyes, and the May sun making\nglory in her rolling clouds of new-grown hair--and, better than best,\nthat smile of the heart filling the whole young face with light--she\nreally looked as if it would be impossible to say \"no\" to her.\n\n\"Aunty,\" she began, \"it is quite an age since you have let me have a\nwalk at all. One would think that I wanted to run away with that very\nsmart young gentleman, who possesses and exhibits that extremely\nlustrous riding-whip. If he has only got a horse to match it--what is\nthe name, dear Aunty, of that inestimable historical jewel that\nsomebody stole out of somebody's eye?\"\n\n\"Grace, will you never remember anything? It is now called the Orloff,\nor Schaffras gem, and is set in the Russian sceptre.\"\n\n\"Then that must be the name of this gentleman's horse, to enable it to\ngo with such a whip. Dear Aunty now, even that whip will not tempt me\nor move me to run away from you. Only do please to allow me forth.\nThis horrid little garden is so shaded and sour, that even a daisy\ncannot live. But in the wood I find all things lovely. May I have a\nrun for only half an hour?\"\n\n\"Upon one condition,\" replied Miss Patch; \"that if you see any one,\nyou shall come back at once, and let me know.\"\n\n\"What, even the fat man with the flapped hat and the smock on? I never\ngo out without seeing him, though he never seems to see me at all. He\nmust be very short-sighted.\"\n\n\"Oh no, my dear; never mind that poor man; he looks after the cattle\nor something. What I mean is, any young gentleman, who ought to be at\nhome on the Sabbath day. And wrestle with your natural frivolity, my\ndear, that no worldly thoughts may assault and hurt the soul upon this\nholy day.\"\n\n\"I will do my best, Aunty. But how can I help thinking of the things I\nsee?\"\n\nMiss Patch having less than any faith in unregenerate human nature,\nfeared that she might have been wrong in allowing even this limited\nfreedom to Grace. The truth of it was that, without fresh guidance\nfrom a mind far deeper than her own, she could not see the right thing\nto do in the new complication arising. The interviews between Kit\nSharp and Grace were the very thing desired, and surely must have led\nto something good, which ought to be carefully followed up. And yet,\nif she met him again, she would be quite sure to go on with her\nquestions; and Kit, being purely outside of the plot, would reply with\nthe most inconvenient truth. Miss Patch had written, as promptly as\ncould be, to ask what she ought to do in this crisis. But no answer\nhad come through the trusty Tickuss, nor any well-provided visit. The\nChristian-minded lady could not tell at all what to make of it. Then,\ncalling to mind the sacredness of the day, she dismissed the subject;\nand sternly rebuked deaf Margery Daw for not keeping the kettle\nboiling.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI.\n\nREASON AND UNREASON.\n\n\nWhen things were in this very ticklish condition almost everywhere,\nand even Cripps himself could scarcely sleep because of rumours, and\nDobbin in his own clean stable found the flies too many for him, an\nexceedingly active man set out to scour the whole of the\nneighbourhood. To the large and vigorous mind of the Rev. Thomas\nHardenow, the worst of all sins (because the most tempting and\nuniversal) was indolence.\n\nHardenow never condemned a poor man for having his pint or his quart\nof ale (with his better half to help him), when he had earned it by a\nhard day's work, and had fed his children likewise. Hardenow thought\nit not easy to find any hypocrisy more bald or any morality more cheap\nthan that or those which strut about, reviling the poor man for\ntaking, in the cheaper liquid form, the nourishment which \"his\nbetters\" can afford to have in the shape of meat; and then are not\ncontent with it, unless it is curdled with some duly sour vintage. And\npassing such crucial points of debate, Hardenow always could make\nallowance for any sins rather than those which spring from a\ntreacherous, sneaking, and lying essence.\n\nNow, a council was held at the Grange of Shotover on the Monday. A sad\nand melancholy house it was, with its fine old mistress lately buried,\nand its poor young master only half recovered. The young tutor had\nbeen especially invited, and having heard everything from the Squire\n(who was proud of having ridden so far, yet broke down ridiculously\namong his boasts), and from Russel Overshute (who had thrown himself\nback for at least three days by excitement and exertion yesterday),\nand also from Mrs. Fermitage (who had lately been feeling herself\noverlooked), Hardenow thought for some little time before he would\ngive his opinion. Not that he was, by any manner of means, possessed\nwith the greatness of his own ideas; but that Mrs. Fermitage, from a\nlow velvet chair, looked up at him with such emphatic inquiry and\nimplicit faith, that he was quite in a difficulty how to speak, or\nwhat to say.\n\nAnd so he said a very few short words of sympathy and of kindness, and\ngladly offered to do his best, and obey the orders given him; so far,\nat least, as his duty to his college and pupils permitted. He\nconfessed that he had thought of this matter many times before he was\ninvited to do so, and without the knowledge which he now possessed, or\nthe special interest in the subject which he now must feel for the\nsake of Russel. But Mrs. Fermitage, filled with respect for the wisdom\nof a fellow and tutor of a college, would not let Hardenow thus\nescape; and being compelled to give his opinion, he did so with his\nusual clearness.\n\n\"I am not at all a man of the world,\" he said; \"and of the law I know\nnothing. My friend Russel is a man of the world, and knows a good deal\nof the law as well. A word from him is worth many of mine. But if Mrs.\nFermitage insists upon having my crude ideas, they are these. First of\nthe first, and by far the most important--I believe that Miss Oglander\nis alive, and that her father will receive her safe and sound, though\nnot perhaps still Miss Oglander.\"\n\n\"God bless you, my dear sir!\" the Squire broke in, getting up to lay\nhold of the young man's hand. \"I don't care a straw what her name may\nbe--Snooks, or Snobbs, or Higginbotham--if I only get sight of my\ndarling child again!\"\n\nRussel Overshute looked rather queer at this, and so did Mrs.\nFermitage; but the Squire continued in the same sort of way--\"What\nodds about her name, if it only is my Grace?\"\n\n\"Exactly so,\" replied Hardenow; \"that natural feeling of yours perhaps\nhas been foreseen and counted on; and that may be why such trouble was\ntaken to terrify you with the idea of her death. Also, of course, that\nwould paralyze your search, while the villains are at leisure to\ncomplete their work.\"\n\n\"I declare, I never thought of that,\" cried Russel. \"How extremely\nthick-headed of me! That theory accounts for a number of things that\ncannot be otherwise explained. What a head you have got, my dear Tom,\nto be sure!\"\n\n\"I wish I could believe it!\" Mr. Oglander exclaimed, whilst his sister\nclasped her fair fat hands, and looked with amazement at every one.\n\"But I see no motive, no motive whatever. My Grace was a dear good\ngirl, as everybody knows, and a fortune in herself; but of worldly\ngoods she had very little, any more than I have; and her prospects\nwere naturally contingent--contingent upon many things, which may not\ncome to pass, I hope, for many years--if they ever do.\" Here he looked\nat his sister, and she said, \"I hope so.\" \"Therefore,\" continued Mr.\nOglander, \"while there are so many fine girls in the county, very much\nbetter worth carrying off--so far as mere worthless pelf is\nconcerned--why should anybody steal my Grace unless they stole her for\nher own sake?\"\n\nHere the Squire sat down, and took to drumming with his stick. His\nfeelings were hurt at the idea--though it was so entirely of his own\norigination--that his daughter had been carried off for the sake of\nher money, not of her own dear self. Hardenow looked at him and made\nno answer. He felt that it did not behove a mere stranger to ask about\nthe young lady's expectations; while Overshute was more imperatively\nsilenced by his relations towards the family. But Mrs. Fermitage came\nto the rescue. Great was her faith in the value of money, and she\nliked to have it known that she had plenty.\n\n\"Tut, tut,\" she cried, shaking out her new brocaded silk--a mourning\ndress certainly, but softly trimmed with purple--\"why should we make\nany mystery of things, when the truth is most important? And the truth\nis, Mr. Hardenow, that my dear niece had very good expectations. My\ndeeply lamented husband, respected, and I may say reverenced, for\nupwards of half a century, in every college of Oxford, and even more\nso by the corporation, for the pure integrity of his character, the\nloftiness of his principles, and--and the substance of his--what they\nmake the wine of--he was not the man, Mr. Hardenow, to leave a devoted\nwife behind him, who had stepped perhaps out of her rank a little, not\nbeing of commercial birth, you know, but never found cause to regret\nit, without some provision for the earthly time which she, being many\nyears his junior----\"\n\n\"Come, come, Joan, not so very many,\" exclaimed the truthful Squire;\n\"about five, or say six, at the utmost. You were born on the 25th of\nJune, A.D.----\"\n\n\"Worth, I was not asking you for statistics. Mr. Hardenow, you will\nexcuse my brother. He has always had a rude style of interruption; he\nlearned it, I believe, in the army, and we always make allowance for\nit. But to go back to what I was saying--my good and ever to be\nlamented husband, being, let us say, ten years my senior--Worth, will\nthat content you?--left every farthing of his property to me; and a\ngood husband always does the same thing, I am told, and I believe they\nare ordered in the Bible; and, of course, I have no one to leave it to\nbut Grace; and being so extraordinarily advanced in years, as my dear\nbrother has impressed upon you, they could not have any very long time\nto wait; and my desire is to do my duty; and perhaps that lies at the\nbottom of it all.\"\n\nAfter relieving her mind in this succinct yet copious manner, the good\nlady went into her chair again, carefully directing, in whatever state\nof mind, the gathering and the falling of her dress aright. And though\nit might be fancied that her colour had been high, anybody now could\nsee that her dignity had conquered it.\n\n\"Now, the whole of this goes for next to nothing,\" said the Squire,\nwhile the young men looked at one another, and longed to be out of the\nway of it. \"As we have got into the subject, let us go right down to\nthe bottom of it. What are filthy pence and halfpence, or a cellar,\nlike Balak's, of silver and gold, when compared with the life of one\npure dear soul? I may not express myself theologically, but you can\nsee what I mean exactly. I mean that I would kick old Port-wine's\ndross to the bottom of the Red Sea, where Pharaoh lies, if it turns\nout that that has killed my child, or made her this long time dead to\nme.\"\n\nHaving justified his feelings thus, the old man stood up, and went to\nthe window, to look for his horse. The very last thing he desired\nalways was to let out what he felt too much. But to hear that old\nthief of a \"Port-wine Fermitage\" praised, and his lucre put forward,\nquite as if it were an equivalent for Grace, and to think that he owed\nto that filthy cause the loss of the liveliest, loveliest darling,\nwithout whom he had neither life nor love--such things were enough to\nbreak the balance of his patience; and the rest might think them out\namongst them.\n\nNow, this might have made a very serious to-do between Mr. Oglander\nand his sister Joan, both of them being of the stiff-necked order, if\nhe had been allowed to ride away like this. Mrs. Fermitage had her\ngreat carriage in the yard, and two black horses with wide valleys\ndown their backs, rattling rings of the brightest brass, while they\nstood in the stable with a bail between them, and gently deigned to\nblow the chaff off from the oats of Shotover. This goodly pair made a\ngreat rush now into the mind of their mistress--the only sort of rush\nthey ever made--and seeing her brother in that state of mind to get\naway from her, she became inspired with an equal desire to get away\nfrom him.\n\n\"Will you kindly ring the bell,\" she said, \"and order my horses to be\nput to? I think I have quite said every word I had to say. And being\nthe only lady present, of course I labour under some--well, some\nlittle disadvantages. Not, of course, that I mean for a moment----\"\n\n\"To be sure not, Joan! You never do know what you mean. You would be a\nvery nasty woman if you did. Now, do let us turn our minds the\npleasant way to everything. If any word has come from me to lead to\nstrong kind of argument, I beg pardon of everybody; and then there\nought to be an end of it.\"\n\nMrs. Fermitage scarcely knew what to say, but in a relenting way\nlooked round for some one to take it up for her. And she was not long\nwithout somebody.\n\n\"Mr. Oglander,\" said Russel Overshute, \"you really ought to give us\ntime to think. You are growing so hasty, sir, since you came back to\nyour seat in the saddle, and your cross-country ways, that you want to\nride over every one of us--ladies and gentlemen, all alike.\"\n\nThe old Squire laughed, he could not help it, at the thought of his\nown effrontery. He felt that there might be some truth about it, ever\nsince it had come into his mind that he might not after all be\nchildless. He would not have any one know, for a thousands pounds, why\nhe was laughing; or that half another word might turn it into weeping.\nHe had seen it proved in learned books that no man knew the way to\nweep at his time of life; and if his own case went against it, he had\nthe manners to be ashamed of it. So he waited till he felt that his\nface was right, and then he went up to his sister Joan, who was\ngrowing uneasy about her own words; and he took her two plump hands in\nhis, and gave a glance, for all there present to be welcome witnesses.\nAnd then, having knowledge for the last ten years how much too fat she\nwas to lift, he managed to kiss her in the two right places,\ndisarranging nothing.\n\nHis sister looked up at him, as soon as he had done it, with a sense\nof his propriety and study of her harmonies; and she whispered to him\nquietly, \"I beg you pardon, brother.\" And he spoke up for all to hear\nhim, \"Joan, my dear, I beg your pardon.\"\n\n\"Now, the first thing to be done,\" said Hardenow, \"is to find\nCinnaminta and her husband Smith. But allow me to make one important\nrequest, that even your adviser, Mr. Luke Sharp, shall not be informed\nof what has passed to-day, or what Overshute found out yesterday.\"\n\nWith some little surprise they agreed to this.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII.\n\nMEETING THE COACH.\n\n\nThere happened, however, to be some one else, whose opinion differed\nvery widely from that of Mr. Hardenow, as to the necessity for any\nprompt appearance of either Mr. or Mrs. Joseph Smith.\n\nThe old red house in Cross Duck Lane was ready to jump out of its\nwindows--if such a feat be possible--with eagerness and anxiety at the\nlong absence of its master. Mr. Luke Sharp had not crossed his own\nthreshold for ten whole days, including two Sundays, when even an\nattorney may give leg-bail to the Power under whose \"Ca. ad sa.\" he\nlives. The business of the noble firm of Piper, Pepper, Sharp, & Co.\nwas falling sadly into arrears, at the very busiest time of year; for\nMr. Sharp had always kept his very best clerks in leading strings; and\nKit thus far, with his mother's aid, had battled against all articles.\nChristopher Fermitage Sharp, Esq., was resolved to be a country\ngentleman and a sportsman, and no quill-driver; he felt that his arms,\nand legs as well, were a great deal too good for going on and under\ndesk.\n\nWith fine resignation Kit accepted the absence of his father. With his\nfather away, he was a very great man; with his father at home, he was\nquite a small boy. He liked to play master of a house, and frighten\nhis mother and the maids; and vow to dine at the Mitre all the rest of\nthe week--if that was their style of cookery!\n\nBut poor Mrs. Sharp could not treat the matter thus. Truly delighted\nas she was to see her dear boy take his father's place, and conduct\nhimself with dignity as the head of the household, and find fault with\nthings of which he knew nothing, and order this, that, and the other\naway--still she could not help remembering that all this was not as it\nought to be. Christopher ought to have been in tortures of intense\nanxiety; and, so far as that went, so ought she; and she really tried\nvery hard not to sleep, and to sit up listening for the night-bell.\nBut a man who thinks everything of his own will, and nothing of any\nother person's wish, may be pretty sure that none will miss his\npresence so much as himself does.\n\nIn spite of all that, Mrs. Sharp was anxious, and so were the rest of\nthe household--though rather perhaps with care than love--at the long,\nunaccountable absence of the head and the brain of everything. Even\nthe boys in Cross Duck Lane, who had a strong idea that Lawyer Sharp\nwould defend them against the magistrates, were beginning to feel that\nthey must look out before throwing stones at any other boys.\n\n\"You are not at all the thing, my darling boy,\" said Mrs. Sharp to\nChristopher, on the evening of that same Monday on which the Council\nhad been held at Shotover; \"your want of appetite makes me wretched.\nNow, put on your cloak, my pet, and go as far as Carfax, or Magdalen\nBridge. The two evening coaches will soon be in--the 'Defiance' and\nthe 'Regulator.' I have a strong idea that your father will come by\none or other of them.\"\n\n\"I may just as well go there as anywhere else,\" the young man answered\ngloomily. For some days now he had striven in vain for an interview\nwith his charmer; and, most unkindest cut of all, he had spied her\nonce, and she had run away. \"It does not matter where I go.\"\n\n\"When you talk like that, dear child, you have no idea what you do.\nYou simply break the heart of your poor mother--and much you care for\nthat! Now, if you should see any very fresh calves' sweet-breads, or\neven a pig's fry, or anything you fancy, order it in, dear, at once;\nand be sure that you are at home by nine o'clock; and bring your dear\npapa with you, if you can.\"\n\nKit, with a sigh and a roll of his eyes, flung his cloak around him;\nand with long, slow, melancholy strides clomb the arduous steep of\nCarfax. Here at that time--if any faith there be to bruit of\nveterans--eighty well-equipped quadrig\u00c3\u00a6 daily passed with prance of\nsteeds and sound of classic trump, and often youthful charioteer, more\napt to handle than win ribbons. Forty chariots came from smoke, and\nwealth, and din of blessed Rome; and other forty sped them back, with\nthe glory and mud of the country divine.\n\nThe moody Kit ensconced himself, away from the tramp of the vulgar crowd,\nin the beetling doorway of a tailor who had put his shutters up; and\nthrice being challenged by proctors velvet-sleeved, and velvet-selvaged\nPro--\"Sir, are you a member of this university?\"--thrice had the pleasure\nof answering \"No!\" Once and again he wiped his hectic cheek and\nfevered brow with a yellow bandana, from which the winner of last\nyear's Derby was washing out; and he saw the \"Defiance\" and the\n\"Regulator\" pass, newly horsed from rival inns, exalting their horns\nagainst one another, with splinter-bars swinging behind cocked tails,\nall eager for their race upon the Cheltenham road. But he saw not the\nauthor of his existence; yet no tear bedewed his unfilial eye, though\nthese were the likeliest coaches.\n\n\"All right,\" he said, putting his pipe in its case; \"governor won't\ncome home to-night. I'm in no hurry, if he isn't. I think I'll have\nsheep's trotters. It's a beastly time of the year for anything.\"\nTwitching his cloak, which had two long tassels, he strode, from his\npost of observation and morbid meditation, towards a tidy and clean\nlittle tripe-shop. He knew the old woman who kept it, in George\nStreet; and she always put him into good condition by generous\nadmiration.\n\nAlas! he had stridden but a very few strides, when he met the up-coach\nfrom Woodstock, wearily with spent horses making rally for the Star.\nThe driver (a man of fine family at Christchurch, now in his seventh\nterm, and fighting off his \"smalls\"), with a turn of his strong arm,\npulled the team together, while with the other hand he launched a\nscouring flourish of the shrill scourge over every blessed horse's\nears.\n\n\"Well done, my lord!\" said the gentleman on the box, as the four\nhorses pulled up foot for foot, and stood with their ears and their\nnoses one for one; \"you have brought them up in noble style, my lord.\nI never saw it done more perfectly.\"\n\nMy lord touched his white hat, and said nothing. He had crowned his\nday, as he always loved to crown it; and now, if he could get into a\nback room of the Star, pull off his top-boots and cape, and don cap\nand gown, and fetch back to college clear of \u00c2\u00a35 fine--as happy as any\nlord would he be, till nature sent him forth to drive again tomorrow.\n\nBut Kit, having very keen ears, had recognised, even from the other\nside of the street, the sound of his dear father's voice. Mr. Luke\nSharp never missed a chance of commending a nobleman's exploits; but\nhe would not have spoken in so loud a tone, perhaps, if he had known\nthat his son was near at hand. For he hated with a consistent\nhatred--whether he were doing well or ill--all observation of his\nmovements by any member of his household. Christopher, being well\naware of this, pursued his own course in the shadow, but resolved,\nwith filial piety, to keep his good father in sight for fear of his\nfalling into any mischief.\n\nFirst of all, Mr. Sharp--as observed at a respectful distance by his\nson--went into the coach office, and there left his hand-bag and his\ntravelling coat; then, carrying something rolled under his arm, he\nbetook himself to a little quiet tap-room, and called for something\nthat loomed and steamed afar, very much after the manner of hot brown\ngrog.\n\n\"Ho, ho!\" muttered Kit; \"then he isn't going home. My duty to the\nhousehold commands me to learn why.\"\n\nWith a smack of his lips, Mr. Sharp the elder came out into\nCorn-Market Street again, and turning his back on his home, set forth\nat a rapid pace for the broad desert of St. Giles. Here he passed into\nan unlit alley, in the lonely parts beyond St. John's; and Kit, full\nof wonder, was about to follow, but hung back as the receding figure\nsuddenly stopped and began to shift about. In a nice dark place, the\nlearned gentleman unrolled the travelling rug he had been carrying,\nundoubled it, after that, from some selvage--and, lo, there was a city\nwatchman's large loose overall! Then he pressed down the crown of his\nblack spring-hat, till it lay on his head like a pancake, pulled the\npouch of his long cloak over that, and emerged from his alley with a\nvigilant slouch, whistling \"Moll Maloney.\" Considerable surprise found\nits way into the candid mind of Christopher.\n\n\"Well now!\" thought the ungrateful youth, as he shrank behind a tree\nto peep; \"I always knew that the governor was a notch or two too deep\nfor us; but what he is up to now surpasses all experience of him. What\nshall I do? It seems so nasty to go spying after him. And yet things\nare taking such a very strange turn, that, for the sake of my mother,\nwho is worth a thousand of him, I do believe I am bound to see what\nthis strange go may lead to.\"\n\nYoung curiosity sprang forth, and strongly backed up his sense of\nduty; insomuch that Kit, after hesitating and listening for any other\nstep, stealthily followed the \"author of his existence\" across the\ndark and dusty road. \"He is going to Squeaker Smith's,\" thought the\nlad; \"he will get a horse, and ride away, no end; and of course I can\nnever go after him. I am sure it has something to do with me. Such\ntroubles are enough to drive one mad.\"\n\nBut Mr. Sharp did not turn in at the lamp-lit entrance to those mews.\nHe shunned the beaming oil, which threw barred shadows upon sawdust of\na fine device, and, keeping all his merits in the dark, strode on,\nlike a watchman newly ordered to his post. Then suddenly he turned\ndown a narrow unmade lane, hillocked with clay, and leading (as\nChristopher knew quite well) to the wildest part of \"Jericho.\"\n\n\"I will follow him no further,\" said Kit Sharp, with a pang of\nastonishment and doubt; \"he is my father; what right have I to pry\ninto his secrets? How I wish that I had not followed him at all! It\nserves me right for meanness. I will go home now; what care I for\nanything--trotters, cow-heel, or sweet-bread?\"\n\nAs he turned, to carry out this good resolve, with a heart that would\nhave ailed him more for leaving fears unfinished, the sound of a\nclouting, loutish footstep came along the broken mud-banks of the\nnarrow lane. The place was lonely, dark, and villainous: foot-pads\nstill abounded. Kit knew that his father often carried large sums of\nmoney, and always the great gold watch; he might have been decoyed\nhere for robbery and murder, upon pretence of secret business; clearly\nit was the young man's duty not to be too far away. Therefore he drew\nback, and stood in the jaws of the dark entrance.\n\nBut while he was ready to leap forth if wanted, the sound of quiet\nvoices told him that there was no danger. Kit could not hear the first\nfew words; but his father came back towards the mouth of the lane, as\nif he would much rather not go into the dark too deeply. Christopher\ntherefore was obliged either to draw back into the hedge, and there\nlie hid without moving, or else to come forward and declare himself.\nHe knew that the latter was his proper course, or he might have known\nit, if he had taken time to think; but the dread of his father and the\nhurry of the moment drove him, without thought, into the\nlurking-place. It was quite dark now, and there was not a lamp within\na furlong of them.\n\n\"You quite understand me, then;\" Mr. Sharp was speaking in a low clear\nvoice; \"you are not to say a word to Cripps about it. He is true\nenough to me, because he dare not be otherwise; but he is an arrant\ncoward. I want a man who has the spirit to defy the law, when he knows\nthat he is well backed up.\"\n\n\"Governor, I am your man for that. I have defied the law, since I were\nthat high, with only my mother, in the wukuss, to back me.\"\n\n\"What I mean is, to defy the wrong fashions of the law; the petty\nrules that go against all common sense and equity.\"\n\n\"All the fashions of the law be wrong. I might a' got on in the world\nlike a house afire, if it hadn't been for the devil's own law. To tell\nme a thing is agin the law is as good as an eyster to my teeth. Go on,\ngovernor, no fear of that, I say.\"\n\n\"And you know where to find, at any moment, a man as resolute as\nyourself--Joe Smith. Well, you know what you have to do, in case of\nany sudden stir arising. At present all goes well; but all, at any\nmoment, may go wrong. Squire Overshute is about again at last----\"\n\n\"Ah, if I could only come across of he of a dark night, such as this\nbe----\"\n\n\"And that fool Cinnaminta has told him all she knows--which, luckily,\nis not very much. I took good care to keep women out of it. And the\nCarrier too has been smelling about--but he hasn't the sense of his\nown horse. Night and day, George, night and day, keep a look-out, and\nhave the horses ready. You know what I have done for you, my man.\"\n\n\"Governor, if it hadn't been for you, I might a' seed the clouds\nthrough a halter loop.\"\n\n\"You speak the truth, and express it well. And you may still enjoy\nthat fair opportunity, unless you attend to every word I say.\"\n\n\"No fear, governor; I know you too well. A good friend and a bad enemy\nyou be. Thick and thin, sir--thick and thin. Agin all the world, sir,\nI sticks by you.\"\n\n\"Enough for to-night, my man. Get ready and be off. I shall know where\nto find you, as before. I shall ride over to-morrow, if I find it\nneedful.\"\n\nWith these words, Mr. Luke Sharp set off at a good round pace for\nOxford, while the other man shambled and whistled his way homewards up\nthe black-mouthed lane. Perceiving these things, Christopher Sharp,\nwith young bones, leaped from his hiding-place. Astonishment might\nhave been read upon his ingenuous and fat countenance, if the lighting\ncommittee of the corporation had carried out their duty. But (having\nno house of their own out here) they had, far back, put colophon upon\nthe nascent gas-pipe. The ambition of the city, at that time, was to\nfill all the houses of the citizens, and extend in no direction. But\nthough his countenance, for want of light, only wasted its amazement,\nKit--like Hector with his windpipe damaged, but not by any means\nperforated--gave issue to his sentiments. Unlike Hector--so far as we\nknow--Kit had been forming a habit of using language too strong for\nladies.\n\n\"Blow me!\" was his unheroic exclamation--\"blow me, if ever yet I knew\nso queer a start as this! Sure as eggs is eggs, that is the very\nblackguard I drubbed for his insolence! His voice is enough, and his\nsnuffle; and I believe he was rubbing his nose in the dark. I am sure\nhe's the man; I could swear it's the man, though I could not see his\nfilthy face at all. My father to be in a conspiracy with him! And poor\nCinnaminta, and Mr. Overshute! What the dickens is the meaning of it\nall? The governor has a thousand times my brains, as everybody says,\nand I am the last to grudge it to him; and he thinks he can do what he\nlikes with me. I am not quite sure of that, if he puts my pecker up\ntoo heavily.\"\n\nTo throw his favourite light on his own reflections, Kit Sharp lit his\npipe, and followed slowly in his father's wake. Wiser, and wider, and\nbrighter men might be found betwixt every two lamp-posts, but few more\nsimple, soft, and gentle than this honest lawyer's son.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.\n\nTHE MOTIVE.\n\n\nPerfectly free from all suspicions, and as happy as he deserved to be,\nMr. Sharp leaned back in his easy chair, after making an excellent\nsupper, and gazed with complacency at his good wife. He was really\nglad to be at home again, and to find his admiring household safe, and\nto rest for a while with a quiet brain, as the lord and master of\neverything. Christopher had been sent to bed, as if he were only ten\nyears old; for instead of exhibiting the proper joy, he had behaved in\na very strange and absent manner; and his father, who delighted much\nin snubbing him sometimes, had requested him to seek his pillow. Kit\nhad accepted this proposal very gladly, longing as he did to think\nover by himself that strange adventure of the evening.\n\n\"Now, darling Luke,\" began Mrs. Sharp, as soon as she had made her\nhusband quite snug, and provided him with a glass of negus, \"you\nreally must be amazed at my unparalleled patience and self-control.\nYou ran away suddenly at the very crisis of a most interesting and\nmomentous tale. And from that day to this I have not had one word; and\nhow to behave to Kit has been a riddle beyond riddles. How I have seen\nto the dinner--I am sure--and of sleep I have scarcely had fifty\nwinks, between my anxiety about you, and misery at not knowing how the\nstory ended.\"\n\n\"Very well, Miranda, I will tell you all the rest; together with the\npostscript added since I went to London. Only you must stay up very\nlate, I fear, to get to the proper end of it.\"\n\n\"I will stay till the cocks crow. At least, I mean, dear, if, after\nyour long journey, you are really fit for it. If not, I will wait till\nto-morrow, dear.\"\n\nMr. Sharp was touched by his wife's consideration for him. He loved\nher more than he loved any one else in the world, except himself; and\nthough (like many other clear-headed men) he had small faith in brains\nfeminine, he was not quite certain that he might not get some useful\nidea out of them when the matter at issue was feminine.\n\n\"I am ready, if you are, my dear,\" he said, for he hated to beat about\nthe bush. \"Only I must know where I left off. With all I have done\nsince, I quite forget.\"\n\n\"You left off just when you had discovered the real man who was called\n'Jolly Fellows;' the man Cousin Fermitage left his will with.\"\n\n\"To be sure! Or at least, it was a codicil. Very well, I found him in\nthe wine-vaults of the company, where they have been for generations.\nHe was going round with some large and good customer, such as old\nFermitage himself had been. Senhor Gelofilos had a link in one hand,\nand in the other a deep dock-glass, while a man in his shadow bore a\nflashing gimlet and a long-armed siphon-tap. From cell to cell, and\npipe to pipe, they were going in regular order, showing brands,\n_ex_ this, and _ex_ that, and making little taps and trying them.\n\n\"I was admitted, without a word, as one of this solemn procession,\nbeing taken for a member of the sacred trade; and the number of sips\nof wine I got, and the importance attached to my opinion, would have\nmade you laugh, Miranda. At length I got a chance of speaking alone to\nSenhor Gelofilos, a tall, dark, gentlemanly man, of grave and\ndignified manner. He at once remembered that he had received a paper\nfrom Mr. Fermitage; of its nature however he knew nothing, not being\nacquainted with our legal forms. He had kept it ever since in a box at\nhis house, and if I could call upon him after office hours, he would\nshow it to me with pleasure. Accordingly, I took a hackney-coach to\nhis house near Hampstead in the evening, and found that old\n'Port-wine' had not deceived me during our last interview.\n\n\"I held in my hand a most important codicil to the old man's will,\nduly executed and attested, so far at least as could be decided\nwithout inquiry. By this codicil he revoked his will thus far, that,\ninstead of leaving the residue, after payment of legacies, to his\nwidow absolutely, he left her a life-interest in that residue, after\nbequeathing the sum of \u00c2\u00a320,000, duty free, to his niece, Grace\nOglander.\"\n\n\"Out of my money, Luke!\" cried Mrs. Sharp indignantly. \"Twenty\nthousand pounds out of my money! And what niece of his was she, I\nshould like to know? Was there nothing whatever for his own flesh and\nblood?\"\n\n\"Nothing whatever,\" answered Mr. Sharp calmly. \"But wait a bit,\nMiranda, wait. Well, all the residue of his estate, after the decease\nof his said wife, Joan, was by this codicil absolutely given to his\nsaid niece Grace. He said that they both would know why he had made\nthe change. And then the rest of his will was confirmed, as usual.\"\n\n\"I never heard such a thing! I never heard such robbery!\" exclaimed\nMrs. Sharp, with a panting breast. \"I hope you will contest it all, my\ndear. If there is law in the land, you cannot fail to upset such a\nvile, vile will! You can show that the fungus got into his brain.\"\n\n\"My dear, it is my object to establish that will, or the codicil\nrather, which I thus discovered. I am obliged to proceed very\ncarefully, of course; a rash step would ruin everything. Unluckily the\nexecutors remain as before, though he would not trust them with the\ncodicil. Well, one of them, as you know, bought such a lot of port,\nhalf-price, at his testator's sale, that in three months he required\nan executor for himself. The other took warning by his fate, and is\ngoing in for claret and the sour Rhenish wines. This has made him as\nsurly as a bear, and he is a most difficult man to manage. But if any\none can handle him, I can; and he has a deadly quarrel with that\nhaughty Joan. I had first ascertained, without any stir, that the\nattestation is quite correct--two stupid bottle-men, who gave no\nthought to what they were doing, but can swear to the signing; and the\ncodicil itself, though 'Port-wine' drew it without any lawyer, is\nquite clear and good. At the proper moment I produce the codicil,\naccount for my possession of it, go to Mr. Wigginton, and make him\nprove it; and then, I think, we turn the tables on the proud old\nwidow.\"\n\n\"Oh, Luke, what a blessed day that would be for me! The things I have\nendured from that odious woman! Of course, it will mortify her not to\nhave disposal, and to have to give up \u00c2\u00a320,000--the miser, the screw,\nthe Expositor hypocrite! The filthy silk stockings I should be ashamed\nto own! But, darling Luke, I do not see how we ourselves are a bit the\nbetter off for it. Poor Grace being dead, of course her father takes\nthe money.\"\n\n\"Suppose, for a moment that, instead of being dead, Grace Oglander is\nthe wedded wife, by that time, of a certain Christopher Fermitage\nSharp, and without any settlement!\"\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed Mrs. Sharp, jumping with astonishment. \"Is it\npossible? Is it possible?\"\n\n\"It is more than possible, it is probable; and without some very bad\nluck, it is certain!\"\n\n\"Oh, you darling love!\" she very nearly shouted, giving him a hug with\nher plump white arms. \"Oh, Luke, Luke, it is the noblest thing I ever\nheard! And she is such a nice girl, too, so sweet, and clever, and\nsuperior! The very daughter I would have chosen out of fifty thousand!\nAnd with all that money at her back! Why, we can retire, and set up a\ngreen barouche! I shall have it lined with the new agate colour,\ntrimmed with deep puce, like the Marchioness of Marston's--that is, if\nyou approve, of course, my dear. And a pair of iron-greys always go\nthe best with that. But, Luke, you will laugh at me for being in a\nhurry. There is plenty of time, dear, is there not?--though they do\nsay that carriage-builders are so slow. But they think so much of\ntheir old family, my dear. I know how very wonderfully managing you\nare, and as clever as can be consistent with the highest principle.\nBut do tell me, how you have contrived all this so well, and never\neven let me guess a single whisper of it.\"\n\n\"It has required some tact and skill,\" Mr. Sharp replied, with a\ntwinkle in his eyes, and taking a good pull at his port-wine negus;\n\"and even more than that, Miranda, without a bold stroke it could\nnever have been done. I staked almost everything upon the die; not\nquite everything, for I made all arrangements if we should have to\nfly.\"\n\n\"Fly, my dear!\" cried Mrs. Sharp, looking up with a very different\nface. \"What do you mean, Luke? To have to run away!\"\n\n\"Quite so. There is no great stroke without great miss. And if I had\nmissed, we must all have bolted suddenly.\"\n\n\"The Lord forbid! Run away in disgrace from my father's own house, and\nthe whole world that knows us! I never could have tried to go through\nsuch a trial.\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear Miranda, it might have come to that. And you would have\ngone through the whole of it, without a single murmur.\"\n\n\"Luke, I positively tremble at you!\" the good woman answered, as her\neyes fell under his. \"How stern you can look when you want to scare\nme!\"\n\n\"Miranda, I tell you the simple truth. We must all have been in France\nwithin twelve hours if, if--well, never mind. Nothing venture nothing\nwin. But happily we have won, I believe; though we must not be too\nsure as yet. We have justice on our side; but justice does not always\nprevail against petty facts. And public opinion would set against us\nwith great ferocity, if we failed. If we succeed, all men will praise\nus as soon as we begin to spend our money, and exert it near home at\nthe outset. Everything depends upon success; of course, it always does\nin everything.\"\n\n\"My dear, it is not fair of you to talk like that,\" Mrs. Sharp\nanswered, with tears in her eyes; for, in all her kind and ungirt\nnature, there was no entry for cynicism; \"you must feel that I would\nhold by you always, whatever all the world might have the impudence to\nsay, dear.\"\n\n\"Beyond a doubt you would. You could do no otherwise. But that might\nbe of very little use. I mean, that it would be the very greatest\nprop, and comfort, and blessing, and support in every way, and would\nkeep up one's faith, to some extent, in human nature, and divine\nassistance--but still, if we had to live on three pound ten a week!\nHowever, we will not anticipate the worst. You would like to know how\nthe whole thing stands now?\"\n\nMrs. Luke Sharp, although not very clever, and wholly incapable of any\nplot herself (beyond such little stratagems as ladies do concoct, for\nfetching down the price of rep, or getting gloves at a quarter of\ntheir cost), nevertheless had her share of common sense, and that\nwhich generally goes therewith--respect for the opinion of good\npeople. She knew that her husband was a very bold man, as well as a\nvery strong-willed one; he had often done things which she had thought\ntoo daring; and yet they had always turned out well. But what he had\nnow in hand was, even according to his own account, the most risky and\nperilous venture yet; and though (like the partner of a gambler) she\nwarmed up to back his hand, and cheer him, and let her heart go with\nhim, in her wiser mind she had shivers, and shudders, and a chill\nshadow of the end of it.\n\nMr. Sharp saw that his wife was timid; which of all things would be\nfatal now; for her aid was indispensable. Otherwise, perhaps, he would\nnot have been quite so ready to tell her everything. He had put things\nso that her dislikes and envies, as well as her likings, and loves,\nand ambitions would compel her to work with him. If she were lukewarm\nhis whole scheme must fail. At the mere idea his temper stirred. \"Will\nyou hear the rest? Or is your mind upset?\" he asked a little roughly.\nHis wife looked up brightly from some little blink of thought. \"Every\nword of it now, I must hear every word, if you will be so kind, my\ndear. I will go and see that all the doors are shut.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV.\n\nTHE MANNER.\n\n\n\"You see now, Miranda,\" continued Mr. Sharp, as his wife came and sat\nquite close to him, \"that it was my duty to make the most of the\nknowledge thus providentially obtained. We had met with a bitter\ndisappointment through the most gross injustice, brought about, no\ndoubt, by craft, and wheedling, and black falsehood. When old\nFermitage stood godfather to our only child, and showed a sense of\nduty towards him by bottling and walling up a pipe of wine, everybody\nlooked upon Kit as certain to stand in his shoes in the course of\ntime. You know how we always looked forward to it, not covetously or\nimproperly, but simply as a matter of justice. And you remember what\nhe said to me, before he went to church with Joan Oglander: 'Quibbles,\nmy boy, this shall make no difference between you and me, mind!'\n\n\"I am sure that he meant it when he said it; but that artful woman so\nled him astray, and laid down the law about wives and husbands, and\n'county families,' and all that, and pouring contempt upon our\nprofession, that all his better feelings left him, and he made the\nwill he did. And but for her low, unwomanly cowardice during his last\nillness, so it would have stood--as she believes it even now to\nstand.\"\n\n\"Oh, what a pure delight it will be,\" cried the lady, unable to help\nherself, \"such a triumph of right over might and falsehood! Do let me\nbe there to see it.\"\n\n\"There is time enough to think of that, Miranda. Well, as soon as ever\nI felt quite sure of my ground about the codicil (which Senhor\nGelofilos placed in my hands after making inquiry about me here, and\nbeing satisfied of my relationship and respectability), I began to\ncast about for the most effectual mode of working it. It was clear in\na moment that the right course was to make a match between Grace, now\nthe legal heiress, and Kit, the legitimate heir. But here I was met by\ndifficulties which appeared at first sight insuperable. The pride of\nthe old Squire, and his family nonsense, the suit of Russel Overshute,\nand the girl's own liking for that young fellow (which I had some\nreason to suspect), the impossibility of getting at the girl, and last\nnot least the stupid shyness of our Christopher himself; these and\nother obstacles compelled me to knock them all out of the way, by some\ndecisive action. The girl must be taken out of stupid people's power,\nand brought to know what was good for her.\n\n\"Of course, I might have cut the matter short by walking the girl off,\nand allowing her no food until she consented to marry Kit; and\nprobably if I could only have foreseen my sad anxieties and heavy\noutlay, I should have acted in that way. But I have a natural dislike\nto measures that wear an appearance of harshness; and I could not tell\nhow Kit might take it, or even you, Miranda dear. In this sad puzzle,\nsome good inspiration brought to my mind Hannah Patch, then living by\nherself in London. In a sort of a manner she is my sister (as I have\ntold you long ago), although she is so many years my elder.\"\n\nMrs. Sharp nodded; she knew all about it and admired her husband none\nthe less for being the illegitimate son of the fashionable Captain\nPatch.\n\n\"Very well,\" this admirable man resumed, \"you are aware that Hannah\nlooked very coldly upon me, and spoke of me always as 'that child of\nsin,' until I was enabled to marry you, my dear, through your\ndisinterested affection, which is my choicest treasure. Having won\nthat, and another more lucrative (but less delightful) partnership, I\nbecame to sweet Hannah the child of love, and was immediately allowed\nthe privilege of doing all her legal business gratis. You have often\ngrumbled at that, but I had some knowledge of what I was about, my\ndear, and I soon obtained that due influence over her which all women\nought to have some man to wield. Setting aside her present use, Hannah\nPatch has \u00c2\u00a3200 a year of her own, which might be much better invested,\nand shall be, as soon as it comes to us; but it would not do to have\nher too set up herself.\"\n\n\"Oh Luke, what a large-minded dear you are!\" whispered Mrs. Sharp,\nwith much enthusiasm; \"I do believe nothing escapes you, and nothing\nthat gets into your hand ever does get out again!\"\n\n\"Well, I am pretty well for that,\" he answered, looking at his large,\nstrong palm; \"I began with my hands pretty empty, God knows, and only\nmy own brain to fill them. But perseverance, integrity, and readiness\nto oblige, have brought me on; and above all things, Miranda, the\ngrace that I found in your kind eyes.\"\n\nThe kind and still pretty eyes looked prettier, and almost young, with\nthe gleam of tears; while the owner of all this integrity proved that\nit had stood him in good stead, by drawing from his pocket, and\nspreading on his head, a handkerchief which had cost him yesterday\nfourteen and sixpence, in Holborn, ready hemmed.\n\n\"Yes,\" he continued with a very honest smile; \"you see me as I am, my\ndear; and there are many poor people in the world worse off. Still it\nwould never do for me to stop. One must be either backward or forward,\nalways; and I prefer to be forward. And I hope to make a great step\nnow. But there must be no hesitation. Well, to go on with my story, I\nsaw how useful Miss Patch might be to us. She has strong religious\nviews, which always make it so easy to guide any one aright, by giving\nthe proper turn to things. Pugnacious dread of Popery, and valiant\nterror of the Jesuits, are the leading-strings of her poor old mind. I\ngot firm hold of both of these, and being trustee of her money also, I\nfound her quite ready to do good deeds.\n\n\"I allowed her to perceive that if things went on, without our\ninterference, Grace Oglander would be married, and her enormous\nfortune sacrificed, to a man whose bosom friend is a Jesuit, a fierce\nwolf in sheep's clothing--an uncommonly clever fellow by the bye--a\nvery young tutor of Brasenose. She had heard of him; for his name is\nwell known among the leaders of this new sect, who call themselves\nAnglo-Catholics, and will end by being Roman Catholics. Of these good\nmen (according to their lights) Hannah Patch has even deeper terror\nthan of downright Jesuits. Naturally such stuff matters not to me;\nexcept when I can work it.\"\n\n\"Hannah Patch also had a special grudge against old Squire Oglander, a\nman very well in his way, and very honest, who thinks a great deal of\nhis own opinions, and is fit to be his own grandfather. He had no love\nat all for the Patch connection--the patch on the family, as he called\nit--and the marriage of his stepmother with Captain Patch, and the\nCaptain's patronising air towards him--in a word, Miranda, he hated\nthem all.\n\n\"However, when Hannah was in trouble once or twice, and without a roof\nto shelter her--before she got her present bit of cash--old Oglander\nhad her down, and was very good, and tried to like her. He put his\nchild under her care to learn 'theology,' as she called it, and he\npaid her well for teaching her the Psalms, and the other\ndenunciations. They went away together to some very lonely place;\nwhile the Squire was a week or two away from home. And now it occurred\nto me that this experience might be repeated, and prolonged if\nneedful. Oglander had been nervous, as I knew, and as his daughter\nalso knew, about some form of black fever or something, which had been\nkilling some gipsy people, and was likely to come into the villages. I\nmade use of this fact, with Hannah Patch to help me, and quietly took\nmy young heiress off to a snug little home in the thick of the woods,\nwhere I should be sorry to reside myself. She was under the holy wing\nof Miss Patch; and there she abides to this present day; and I feed\nthem very well, I assure you. They cost me four pound ten a week; for\nthe evangelical Hannah believes it to be the clearest 'mark of the\nbeast' to eat meat less than twice a day; and Leviticus Cripps, who\nsupplies all the victuals, is making a fortune out of me. No bigger\nrogue ever lived than that fellow. He is under my thumb so entirely\nthat if I told him to roll in the mud he would roll. And yet with all\nhis awe of me, he cannot forbear from cheating me. He has found out a\nmanner of dipping his pork so that he turns it into beef or mutton,\naccording to the orders from the cottage; and he charges me butcher's\nprice for it, and cartage for six miles and a half, and a penny a\npound for trimming off the flanks!\"\n\n\"My dear!\" said Mrs. Sharp, \"it is impossible! He never could deceive a\nwoman so, however devoted her mind might be. The grain of the meat is\nquite different, and the formation of the bones not at all alike; and\ndirectly it began to roast----\"\n\n\"Well, never mind, Miranda, there they are quite reconciled to the\nsituation; except that Hannah Patch is always hankering after 'the\nmeans of grace,' and the young girl mooning about her sweet old parent\nand beloved Beckley. Sometimes there are very fine scenes between\nthem; but upon the whole they get on well together, and appreciate one\nanother's virtues. And I heartily trust that the merits of our Kit\nhave made their impression on a sensitive young heart. They took to\none another quite kindly in the romance of the situation, when I\nbrought their sweet innocence into contact by a very simple stratagem.\nThe dear young creatures have believed themselves to be outwitting\neverybody; the very thing I laboured for them both to do. All's well\nthat ends well--don't you think, Miranda?\"\n\n\"I am so entirely lost--I mean I am so unable to think it all out,\nwithout more time being given me,\" Mrs. Sharp answered, while she\npassed her hand across her unwrinkled forehead, and into her generally\nconsulted curl, \"that really, Luke, for the moment I can only admire\nyour audacity. But I think, dear, that in a matter of this kind--an\nespecially feminine province, I may say--you might have done me the\nhonour of consulting me.\"\n\n\"Miranda, it was not to be thought of. Your health and well-being are\nthe dearest objects of my life. I will only ask, could you have borne\nthe suspense, and the worry, and anxiety of the last four months;\nabove all, the necessity for silence?\"\n\n\"Yes, Luke, I could have been very silent; but I cannot abide anxiety.\nYou call me a dear fat soul sometimes, and your judgment is always\ncorrect, my dear. At the same time, I have little views of my own, and\nsensible ways of regarding things. You would like to hear my opinion,\nLuke, and to answer me one or two questions?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Miranda; beyond all doubt. For what other purpose do I\ntell you all? Now, let me have a nap for five minutes, my dear, while\nyou ponder this subject and arrange your questions.\"\n\nHe threw his smart handkerchief over his head, stretched out his feet,\nand took a nice little doze.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV.\n\nTHE POSITION.\n\n\n\"Among my relations,\" said Mrs. Sharp, reclining, for fear of\nasserting herself, as soon as her lord looked up again. \"I have always\nbeen thought to possess a certain amount of stupid common sense.\nNothing of depth, or grand stratagems, I mean, but a way of being\nright nearly nine times out of ten. And I think that this feeling is\ncoming over me, just now.\"\n\n\"My dear, if it is so, do relieve yourself. Do not consider my ideas\nfor a moment, but let me know what your own are.\"\n\n\"Luke, how you love to ridicule me! Well, if my opinion is of no\naccount, I can only ask questions, as you tell me. In the first place,\nhow did you get the girl away?\"\n\n\"Most easily; under her father's orders. Hannah can write the old\ngentleman's hand to any extent, and his style as well. For the glory\nof the Lord she did so.\"\n\n\"And how did you bring her to do such shocking things? She must have\nhad a strong idea that they were not honest.\"\n\n\"Far otherwise. She took an enthusiastic view of the matter from the\nvery first. I made it quite clear to her how much there was at stake;\nand the hardest job for a long time was to prevent her from being too\nzealous. She scorns to take anything for herself, unless it can be put\nreligiously. And for a long time I was quite afraid that I could not\nget a metal band on her. But she found out, before it was quite too\nlate, that the mission of the \"Brotherly-love-abounders,\" upon the\nwest coast of Africa, had had all their missionaries eaten up, and\nrequired a round sum to replace them. I promised her \u00c2\u00a35000 for that,\nwhen her own mission ends in glory.\"\n\n\"Then you are quite certain to have her tight. I might trust you for\nevery precaution, Luke. But how have you managed to keep them so\nquiet, while the neighbourhood was alive with it? And in what corner\nof the world have you got them? And who was the poor girl that really\ndid die?\"\n\n\"One question at a time, if you please, Miranda, though they all hang\npretty much upon one hook. I have kept them so quiet, because they are\nin a corner of a world where no one goes; in a lonely cottage at the\nfurthest extremity of the old Stow Wood, where their nearest road is a\ntimber-track three-quarters of a mile away. They are waited on by a\ndeaf old woman, who believes them to be Americans, which accounts to\nher mind for any oddness. Their washing is done at home, and all their\nfood is procured through Cripps the swine-herd, whose forest farm lies\nwell away, so that none of his children go to them. Cripps is indebted\nto me, and I hold a mortgage of every rod of his land, and a bill of\nsale of his furniture and stock. He dare not play traitor and claim\nthe reward, or I should throw him into prison for forgery, upon a\nlittle transaction of some time back. Moreover, he has no motive; for\nI have promised him the same sum, and his bill of sale cancelled, when\nthe wedding is happily celebrated. Meanwhile he is making fine\npickings out of me, and he caters at a profit of cent. per cent. There\nis nobody else who knows anything about it, except a pair of gipsy\nfellows, too wide awake to come near the law for any amount of\nguineas. One of them is old Kershoe, the celebrated horse-stealer,\nwhom I employed to drive and horse the needful vehicle from London. He\nknew where to get his horses without any postmaster being the wiser,\nand his vehicle was a very tidy carriage, bought by the gipsies for a\ndwelling-place, and furbished up so that the chaises of the age are\nnot to be compared with it. The inquiries made at all livery-stables,\nand posting-houses, and so on, by order of Overshute and the good\nSquire, and some of them through my own agency, have afforded me\ngenial pleasure and some little share of profit.\"\n\n\"Really, my dear,\" said Mrs. Sharp; \"you were scarcely right in\ncharging for them. You should have remembered that you knew all about\nit.\"\n\n\"That was exactly what I did, my dear; and I felt how expensive that\nknowledge was. As a little set-off against the pig-master's bills, I\nmade heavy entries against the good Squire. The fault is his own. He\nshould not have driven me into costly proceedings by that lowest of\nall things the arrogance of birth. Well, the other gipsy man is no\nother than Joe Smith, who jumped the broomstick with the lovely\nPrincess Cinnaminta. You must have heard of her, Miranda. Half the\nladies in Oxford were most bitterly jealous of her, some years back.\"\n\n\"I am sure then that I never was, Mr. Sharp!--a poor creature sitting\nunder sacks, and doing juggling!\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind. You never saw her. She is a woman of superior\nmind and most refined appearance. Indeed, her eyes are such as\nnever----\"\n\n\"Oh, that is where you have been, Luke, is it, while we have been here\nfor a fortnight, trembling----\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Miranda; don't be so absurd. The poor thing has just lost\nher only child, and I believe she will go mad with it. It was her\npretty sister, young Khebyra, who died of collapse, and was buried the\nsame night. This case was most extraordinary. The fever struck her,\nwithout any illness, just as the plague and the cholera have done,\nwith a headlong, concentrated leap; as a thunderstorm gathers itself\nsometimes into one blue ball of lightning. She was laughing at ten\no'clock, and her poor young jaw tied up at noon; and a great panic\nburst among them.\"\n\n\"Luke!\" exclaimed Mrs. Sharp, strongly shuddering; \"you never mean to\nsay that you came home to me, from being among such people, without a\nchange of clothes, or anything!\"\n\n\"How could I come home without anything, my dear? But I was not\n'among' them at all that day, nor at any other period. I never go to\nwork in that coarse sort of way. Familiarity begets contempt. However,\nI was soon informed of this most sad occurrence; and for a while it\nquite upset me, coming as it did at such a very busy time. However,\nwhen I had time to dwell more calmly on the subject, I began to see a\nchance of turning this keen blow to my benefit.\n\n\"The gipsy camp was broken up with fatalistic terror--the most abject\nof all terrors; as the courage of the fatalist is the fiercest of all\ncourage. They carried off their Royal stock, the heiress of the gipsy\nthrone--as soon as some fine thief is hanged--quite as the bees are\nsaid to carry off their queen, when a hornet comes. Poor Cinnaminta\nwas caught away just when I might have made her useful; and only two\nmen were left to attend to the burial of her sister. Of these, my\nfriend Joseph Smith was one, as he ought to be, being Cinnaminta's\nspouse.\n\n\"It was a very active time for me, I assure you, Miranda dear. The\ncomplication was almost too much to be settled in so short a time. And\nsome of my hair, which had been quite strong, was lying quite flat in\nthe morning. Perhaps you remember telling me.\"\n\n\"Yes, that I do, Luke! I could not make it out. Your hair had always\nstood so well; and a far better colour than the young men have got!\nAnd you told me that it was gone like that from taking Cockle's\nantibilious pills!\"\n\n\"Miranda, I have never deceived you. I did take a couple, and they\nhelped me on. But, without attributing too much to them, I did make a\nlucky turn of it. Their manner of sepulture is brief and wise; or, at\nany rate, that of this tribe is; though they differ, I believe, very\nwidely. These wait till they are sure that the sun has set, and then\nthey begin to excavate. I was able to suggest that, in this great\nhurry and scattering of the tribes of Israel, the wisest plan would be\nto adopt and adapt a very quiet corner already hollowed, and indicated\nby name (which is so much more abiding than substance) as a legendary\ngipsy Aceldama. The idea was caught at, as it well deserved to be, in\nthe panic, and lack of time, and terror of the poor dead body. The\npoor thing was buried there with very hasty movements, her sister and\nthe rest being hurried away; and it is quite remarkable how this (the\nmerest episode) has, by the turn of events, assumed a primary\nimportance.\n\n\"Foresight, and insight, and second-sight almost, would be attributed\nto me by any one who did not know the facts. Scarcely anybody would\nbelieve, as this thing worked in my favour so much, that I can\nscarcely claim the invention, any more than I can take any credit for\nthe weather. Indeed, I may say, without the smallest presumption or\nprofanity, that something higher than mere fortune has favoured my\nplans from the very first. I had provided for at least one whole day's\nstart, before any alarm should be given; but the weather secured me, I\nmay say, six weeks, before anything could be done in earnest, And then\nthe discovery of that body, by a girl who was frightened into fits\nalmost, and its tardy disinterment, and the universal conclusion about\nit, which I perhaps helped in some measure to shape, also the illness\nwith which it pleased Providence to visit Messrs. Oglander and\nOvershute--I really feel that I have the deepest cause to be grateful,\nand I trust that I am so.\"\n\n\"Certainly, my dear, your cause is just,\" said Mrs. Sharp, as her\nhusband showed some symptoms of dropping off to sleep again; \"but in\ncarrying it out you have inflicted pain and sad, sad anxiety on a poor\nold man. Can he ever forgive you, or make it up?\"\n\n\"I should hope for his own sake,\" replied the lawyer, \"that he will\ncast away narrow-mindedness; otherwise we shall not permit him to rush\ninto the embraces of his daughter. But if he proves relentless, it\nmatters little, except for the opinion of the world. He cannot touch\n'Portwine's' property at all; and he may do what he likes with his own\nlittle wealth. His outside value is some \u00c2\u00a340,000. However, if I\nunderstand him aright, we shall manage to secure his money too, tied\nup, I dare say--but what matters that? He is a most fond papa, and his\njoy will soon wash away all evil thoughts.\"\n\n\"How delightful it will be!\" cried the lady, with a sigh, \"to restore\nhis long-lost child to him. Still it will be a most delicate task. You\nmust leave all that to me, Luke.\"\n\n\"With pleasure, my dear Miranda; your kind heart quite adapts you for\nsuch a melting scene. And, indeed, I would rather be out of the way.\nBut I want your help for more than that.\"\n\n\"You shall have it, Luke, with all my heart and soul! It is too late\nnow to draw back; though, if you had asked my advice, I would have\ntried to stop you. But just one question more--how did you get rid of\nJohn Smith and his inquiries? They say that he is such a very shrewd\nman.\"\n\n\"Do you not know, will nobody ever know, the difference between small,\nuneducated cunning and the clear intelligence of a practised mind? To\nsuppose that John Smith would ever give me any trouble! He has been\nmost useful. I directed his inquiries; and exhausted the inquisitive\nspirit through him.\"\n\n\"But you did not let him know----\"\n\n\"Miranda, now, I shall go to bed, if I am so very fast asleep. Can no\nwoman ever dream of large utility? I have had no better friend,\nthroughout this long anxiety, than John Smith. And without the\nexpenditure of one farthing, I have guided him into the course that he\nshould take. When he hears of anything, the first thing he asks\nis--'Now, what would Lawyer Sharp be inclined to think of this?'\nPerhaps I have taken more trouble than was needful. But, at any rate,\nit would be disgraceful indeed if John Smith could cause me\nuneasiness. The only man I have ever had the smallest fear of has been\nRussel Overshute. Not that the young fellow is at all acute; but that\nhe cannot be by any means imbued with the proper respect for my\ncharacter.\"\n\n\"How very shocking of him, my dear Luke, when your character has been\nso many years established!\"\n\n\"Miranda, it is indeed shocking!--but what can be expected of a\nRadical? Ever since that villainous Reform Bill passed, the spirit of\ntrue reverence is destroyed. But he must have some respect for me, as\nsoon as he knows all. Although, to confess the pure truth, my dear,\nthings have worked in my favour so, that I scarcely deserve any credit\nat all, except for the original conception. That, however, was a brave\none.\"\n\n\"It was, indeed; and I am scarcely brave enough to be comfortable.\nThere is never any knowing how the world may take things. It is true\nthat old Fermitage was not your client, and you had been very badly\ntreated, and had a right to make the most of any knowledge obtained by\naccident. But old Mr. Oglander is your client, and has trusted you\neven in the present matter. I do not think that my father would have\nconsidered it quite professional to behave so.\"\n\nMrs. Luke Sharp was alarmed at her own boldness in making such a\nspeech as this. She dropped her eyes under her husband's gaze; but he\ntook her remarks quite calmly.\n\n\"My dear, we will talk of that another time. The fact that I do a\nthing--after all my experience--should prove it to be not\nunprofessional. At the present moment, I want to go to bed; and if you\nare anxious to begin hair-splitting, bed is my immediate refuge. But\nif you wish to know about the future of your son, you must listen, and\nnot try to reason.\"\n\n\"I did not mean to vex you, Luke. I might have been certain that you\nknew best. And you always have so many things behind, that Solomon\nhimself could never judge you. Tell me all about my darling Kit, and I\nwill not even dare to cough or breathe.\"\n\n\"My dear, it would grieve me to hear you cough, and break my heart if\nyou did not breathe. But I fear that your Kit is unworthy of your\nsighs. He has lost his young heart beyond redemption, without having\nthe manners to tell his mother!\"\n\n\"They all do it, Luke; of course they do. It is no good to find fault\nwith them. I have been expecting that sort of thing so long. And when\nhe went to Spiers for the melanochaitotrophe, with the yellow stopper\nto it, I knew as well as possible what he was about. I knew that his\nprecious young heart must be gone; for it cost him seven and\nsixpence!\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear; and it went the right way, in the very line I had laid\nfor it. I will tell you another time how I managed that, with Hannah\nPatch, of course, to help me. The poor boy was conquered at first\nsight; for the weather was cold, with snow still in the ditches, and I\ngave him sixpenny-worth of brandy-balls. So Kit went shooting, and got\nshot, according to my arrangement. Ever since that, the great job has\nbeen to temper and guide his rampant energies.\"\n\n\"And of course he knows nothing--oh no, he would be so very unworthy,\nif he did! Oh, do say that he knows nothing, Luke!\"\n\n\"My dear, I can give you that pleasing assurance; although it is a\npuzzling one to me. Christopher Fermitage Sharp knows not Grace\nOglander from the young woman in the moon. He believes her to have\nsailed from a new and better world. Undoubtedly he is my son, Miranda;\nyet where did he get his thick-headedness?\"\n\n\"Mr. Sharp!\"\n\n\"Miranda, make allowance for me. Such things are truly puzzling.\nHowever, you perceive the situation. Here is a very fine young\nfellow--in his mother's opinion and his own--desperately smitten with\na girl unknown, and romantically situated in a wood. There is reason\nto believe that this young lady is not insensible to his merits; he\nlooks very nice in his sporting costume, he has no one to compete with\nhim, he is her only bit of life for the day, he leaves her now and\nthen a romantic rabbit, and he rescues her from a ruffian. But here\nthe true difficulty begins. We cannot well unite them in the holy\nbonds, without a clear knowledge on the part of either of the true\npatronymic of the other. The heroine knows that the hero rejoices in\nthe good and useful name of 'Sharp'; but he knows not that his\nlady-love is one Grace Oglander of Beckley Barton.\n\n\"Here, again, you perceive a fine stroke of justice. If Squire\nOglander had only extended his hospitalities to us, Christopher must\nhave known Grace quite well, and I could not have brought them\ntogether so. At present he believes her to be a Miss Holland, from the\nUnited States of America; and as she has promised Miss Patch not to\nspeak of her own affairs to anybody (according to her father's wish,\nin one of the Demerara letters), that idea of his might still\ncontinue; although she has begun to ask him questions, which are not\nat all convenient. But things must be brought to a point as soon as\npossible. Having the advantage of directing the inquiries, or at any\nrate being consulted about them, I see no great element of danger yet;\nand of course I launched all the first expeditions in every direction\nbut the right one. That setting up of the tombstone by poor old Joan\nwas a very heavy blow to the inquisitive.\"\n\n\"But, my dear, that did not make the poor girl dead a bit more than\nshe was dead before.\"\n\n\"Miranda, you do not understand the world. The evidence of a tombstone\nis the strongest there can be, and beats that of fifty living\nwitnesses. I won a most difficult case for our firm when I was an\nardent youth, and the victory enabled me to aspire to your hand, by\ntaking a mallet and a chisel, and a little nitric acid, and converting\na 'Francis,' by moonlight, into a 'Frances.' I kept the matter to\nmyself, of course; for your good father was a squeamish hand. But you\nhave heard me speak of it.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I thought it so wrong, my dear, even though, as you said,\ntruth required it.\"\n\n\"Truth did require it. The old stonemason had not known how to spell\nthe word. I corrected his heterography; and we confounded the tricks\nof the evil ones. All is fair in love and law, so long as violence is\ndone to neither. And now I wish Kit's unsophisticated mind to be led\nto the perception of that great truth. It is needful for him to be\ndelicately admitted to a knowledge of my intentions. There is nobody\nwho can do this as you can. He takes rather clumsy and obstinate views\nof things he is too young to understand. The main point of all, with a\nmind like his, is to dwell upon the justice of our case and the depth\nof our affection, which has led to such a sacrifice of the common\nconventional view of things.\"\n\n\"My dear, but I have had nothing to do with it. Conception, plan, and\nexecution are all your own, and no other person's. Why, I had not even\ndreamed----\"\n\n\"Still, you must put it to him, Miranda, as if it was your doing more\nthan mine. He has more faith in your--well, what shall I call it? I\nwould not for a moment wrong him by supposing that he doubts his own\nfather's integrity--in your practical judgment, let us say, and\nperception of the nicest principles. It is absolutely necessary that\nyou should appear to have acted throughout in close unison with me. In\nfact, it would be better to let the boy perceive that the whole idea\nfrom the very first was yours; as in simple fact it must have been, if\ncircumstances had permitted me to tell you all that I desired. To any\nidea of yours he takes more kindly perhaps than to those which are\nmine. This is not quite correct, some would say; but I am above\njealousy. I always desire that he should love his mother, and make a\npattern of her. His poor father gets knocked about here and there, and\ncannot halt to keep himself rigidly upright, though it always is his\nambition. But women are so different, and so much better. Even Kit\nperceives that truth. Let him know, my darling, that your peace of\nmind is entirely staked upon his following out the plan which you mean\nto propose to him.\"\n\n\"But, my dear Luke, I have not the least notion of any plan of any\nsort.\"\n\n\"Never mind, Miranda; make him promise. I will tell you all about it\nafterwards. It is better not to let him know too much. Knowledge\nshould come in small doses always, otherwise it puffs up young people.\nAlas! now I feel that I am not as I was! Twenty years ago I could have\nsat up all night talking, and not shown a sign of it next day. I have\nnot had any sleep for the last twelve nights. Do you see any rays in\nmy eyes, dear wife? They are sure indications of heart disease. When I\nam tired they always come.\"\n\n\"Oh, Luke, Luke, you will break my heart! You shall not say another\nword. Have some more negus--I insist upon it! It is no good to put\nyour hand over the glass--and then come to bed immediately. You are\nworking too hard for your family, my pet.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI.\n\nIN THE MESHES.\n\n\nNow being newly inspired by that warm theologian--as Miss Patch really\nbelieved him to be--Luke Sharp, the lady felt capable of a bold\nstroke, which her conscience had seemed to cry out against, till\nloftier thoughts enlarged it. She delivered to her dear niece a\nletter, written in pale ink and upon strange paper, which she drew\nfrom a thicker one addressed to herself, and received \"through their\nbutcher\" from a post-office. Wondering who their butcher was, but\ndelighted to get her dear father's letter, Grace ran away to devour\nit.\n\nIt was dated from George-town, English Guayana, and though full of\naffection, showed touching traces of delicate health and despondency.\nThe poor girl wiped her eyes at her father's tender longing to see her\nonce more, and his earnest prayers for every blessing upon their\ninvaluable friend, Miss Patch. Then he spoke of himself in a manner\nwhich made it impossible for her to keep her eyes wiped, so deep was\nhis sadness, and yet so heroically did he attempt to conceal it from\nher; and then came a few lines, which surprised her greatly. He said\nthat a little bird had told him that during her strict retirement from\nthe world in accordance with his wishes, she had learned to esteem a\nmost worthy young man, for whom he had always felt warm regard, and,\nhe might even say, affection. He doubted whether, at his own time of\nlife, and with this strange languor creeping over him, he could ever\nbear the voyage to England, unless his little darling would come over\nto fetch him, or at least to behold him once more alive; and if she\nwould do so, she must indeed be quick. He need not say that to dream\nof her travelling so far all alone was impossible; but if, for the\nsake of her father, she could dispense with some old formalities, and\nspeedily carry out their mutual choice, he might with his whole heart\nappeal to her husband to bring her out by the next packet.\n\nHe said little more, except that he had learned by the bitter teaching\nof adversity who were his true friends, and who were false. No one had\nshown any truth and reality except Mr. Sharp of Oxford; but he never\ncould have dreamed, till it came to the test, that even the lowest of\nthe low would treat him as young Mr. Overshute had done. That subject\nwas too painful, so he ended with another adjuration to his daughter.\n\n\"Aunty, I have had the most extraordinary letter,\" cried Grace, coming\nin with her eyes quite dreadful; \"it astonishes me beyond everything.\nMay I see the postmark of yours which it came in? I shall think I am\ndreaming till I see the postmark.\"\n\n\"The stamp of the office, do you mean, my dear? Oh yes, you are\nwelcome to see, Grace. Here it is, 'George-town, Demerara.' The date\nis not quite clear without my spectacles. Those foreign dies are\nalways cut so badly.\"\n\n\"Never mind the date, aunt. I have the date inside, in my dear\nfather's writing. But I am quite astonished how my father can have\nheard----\"\n\n\"Something about you, sly little puss! You need not blush so, for I\nlong have guessed it.\"\n\n\"But indeed it is not true--indeed it is not. I may have been amused,\nbut I never, never--and oh, what he says then of somebody else--such a\nthing I should have thought impossible! How can one have any faith in\nany one?\"\n\n\"My dear child, what you mean is this: How can one have any faith in\nworldly and ungodly people? With their mouths they speak deceit; the\npoison of asps is under their lips----\"\n\n\"Oh no, he never was ungodly; to see him walk would show you that; and\nif being good to the poor sick people, and dashing into the middle of\nthe whooping-cough----\"\n\n\"How am I to know of whom you speak? You appear to have acted in a\nvery forward way with some one your father disapproves of.\"\n\n\"I assure you, I never did anything of the kind. It is not at all my\nmanner. I thought you considered it wrong to make unfounded\naccusations.\"\n\n\"Grace, what a most un-Christian temper you still continue to display\nat times! Your cheeks are quite red, and your eyes excited, in a way\nvery sad to witness. The trouble I have taken is beyond all knowledge.\nIf you do not value it, your father does.\"\n\n\"Aunty Patch, may I see exactly what my daddy says to you? I will show\nyou mine if you will show me yours.\"\n\n\"My dear, you seem to forget continually. You treat me as if I were of\nyour own age, and had never been through the very first alarm which\ncomes for our salvation. It has not come to you, or you could not be\nso frivolous and worldly as you are. When first it rang, even for\nmyself----\"\n\n\"How many times does it ring, Aunt? I mean for every individual\nsinner, as you always call us.\"\n\n\"My dear, it rings three times, as has been proved by the most\ninspired of all modern preachers, the Rev. Wm. Romaine, while\namplifying the blessed words of the pious Joseph Alleine. He begins\nhis discourse upon it thus----\"\n\n\"Aunty, you have told me that so many times that I could go up into\nhis desk and do it. It is all so very good and superior; but there are\ntimes when it will not come. You, or at any rate I, for certain, may\ngo down on our knees and pray, and nothing ever comes of it. I have\nbeen at it every night and morning, really quite letting go whatever I\nwas thinking of--and what is there to come of it, except this letter?\nAnd it doesn't sound as if my father ever wrote a word of it.\"\n\n\"Grace, what do you mean, if you please?\"\n\n\"I mean what I do not please. I mean that I have been here at least\nfive months, as long as any fifty, and have put up with the\nmiserablest things--now, never mind about my English, if you please,\nit is quite good enough for such a place as this--and have done my\nvery best to put up with you, who are enough to take fifty people's\nlives away, with perpetual propriety--and have hoped and hoped, and\nprayed and prayed, till my knees are not fit to be looked at--and now,\nafter all, what has come of it? That I am to marry a boy with a red\ncord down his legs, and a crystal in his whip, and a pretty face that\nseems to come from his mamma's watch-pocket, and a very nice and\ngentle way of looking at a lady, as if he were quite capable, if he\nhad the opportunity, of saying 'bo' to any goose on the other side of\nthe river!\"\n\n\"My dear, do you prefer bold ruffians, then, like the vagabond you\nwere rescued from?\"\n\n\"I don't know at all what I do prefer, Aunt Patch, unless it is just\nto be left to myself, and have nothing to say to any one.\"\n\n\"Why, Grace, that is the very thing you complained of in your sinful\nand ungrateful speech, just now! But do not disturb me with any more\ntemper. I must take the opportunity, before the mail goes out, to tell\nyour poor sick father how you have received his letter.\"\n\n\"Oh no, if you please not. You are quite mistaken, if you think that I\nthought of myself first. My dear father knows that I never would do\nthat; and it would be quite vain to tell him so. Oh, my darling,\ndarling father!--where are you now, and whatever are you doing?\"\n\n\"Grace, you are becoming outrageous quite. You know quite well where\nyour father is; and as to what he is doing, you know from his own\nletter that he is lying ill, and longing for you to attend upon him.\nAnd this is the way that you qualify yourself!\"\n\n\"Somehow or other now--I do not mean to be wicked, aunt--but I don't\nthink my father ever wrote that letter--I mean, at any rate, of his\nown free will. Somebody must have stood over him--I feel as if I\nreally saw them--and made him say this, and that, and things that he\nnever used to think of saying. Why, he never would have dreamed, when\nhe was well, of telling me I was to marry anybody. He was so jealous\nof me, he could hardly bear any gentleman to dare to smile; and he\nused to make me promise to begin to let him know, five years before I\nthought of any one. And now for him to tell me to marry in a\nweek--just as if he was putting down a silver-side to salt--and to\nmarry a boy that he scarcely ever heard of, and never even introduced\nto me--he must have been, he cannot but have been, either wonderfully\naffected by the climate, or shackled down in a slave-driver's dungeon,\nuntil he had no idea what he was about.\"\n\n\"Have you finished, Grace, now? Is your violence over?\"\n\n\"No; I have no violence; and it is not half over. But still, if you\nwish to say anything, I will do all I can to listen to it.\"\n\n\"You are most obliging. One would really think that I were seventeen,\nand you nearly seventy.\"\n\n\"Aunt Patch, you know that I am as good as nineteen; and instead of\nbeing seventy you are scarcely fifty-five.\"\n\n\"Grace, your memory is better about ages than about what you do not\nwish to hear of. And you do not wish to hear, with the common\nselfishness of the period, of the duty which is the most sacred of\nall, and at the same time the noblest privilege--the duty of\nself-sacrifice. What are your own little inclinations, petty conceits,\nand miserable jokes--jokes that are ever at deadly enmity with all\ndeep religion--ah, what are they--you selfish and frivolous\ngirl!--when set in the balance with a parent's life--and a parent\nwhose life would have been in no danger but for his perfect devotion\nto you?\"\n\n\"Aunt Patch, I never heard you speak of my father at all in that sort\nof way before. You generally talk of him as if he were careless, and\nworldly, and heterodox, most frivolous, and quite unregenerate. And\nnow quite suddenly you find out all his value. What do you want me to\ndo so much, Aunt Patch?\"\n\n\"Don't look at me like that, child; you quite insult me. As if it\ncould matter to me what you do--except for your own eternal welfare.\nIf you think it the right thing to let your father die in a savage\nland, calling vainly for you, and buried among land-crabs without a\ndrop of water--that is a matter for you hereafter to render your own\naccount of. You have tired me, Grace. I am not so young as you are;\nand I have more feeling. I must lie down a little; you have so upset\nme. When you have recovered your proper frame of mind, perhaps you\nwill kindly see that Margery has washed out the little brown teapot.\"\n\n\"To be sure, aunty, I am up to all her tricks. And I will just toast\nyou a water-biscuit, and put a morsel of salt butter on it, scarcely\nso large as a little French bean. Go to sleep, aunty, for about an\nhour. I am getting into a very proper frame of mind; I can never stay\nvery long out of it. May I go into the wood, just to think a little of\nmy darling father's letter?\"\n\n\"Yes, Grace; but not for more than half an hour, on condition that you\nspeak to no one. You have made my head ache sadly. Leave your father's\nletter here.\"\n\n\"Oh no, if you please, let me take it with me. How can I think without\nit?\"\n\nMiss Patch was so sleepy that she said, \"Very well; let me see it\nagain when you have made the tea.\" Whereupon Grace, having beaten up\nthe cushion of the good lady's only luxury, and laid her down softly,\nand kissed her forehead (for fear of having made it ache), stole her\nown chance for a little quiet thought, in a shelter of the woods more\nsoft than thought. For the summer was coming with a stride of light;\nand bashful corners, full of lateness, tried to ease it off with moss.\n\nIn a nook of this kind, far from any path, and tenderly withdrawn into\nits own green rest, the lonely and bewildered girl stopped suddenly,\nand began to think. She drew forth the letter which had grieved her\nso; and she wondered that it had not grieved her more. It was not yet\nclear to her young frank mind that suspicion, like a mole, was at work\nin it. To get her thoughts better, and to feel some goodness, she sat\nupon a peaceful turret of new spear-grass, and spread her letter open,\nand began to cry. She knew that this was not at all the proper way to\ntake things; and yet if any one had come, and preached to her, and\nproved it all, she could have made no other answer than to cry the\nmore for it.\n\nThe beautiful light of the glancing day turned corners, and came round\nto her; the lovable joy of the many, many things which there is no\ntime to notice, spread itself silently upon the air, or told itself\nonly in fragrance; and the glossy young blades of grass stood up, and\ncomplacently measured their shadows.\n\nHere lay Grace for a long sad hour, taking no heed of the things\naround her, however much they heeded her. The white windflower with\nits drooping bells, and the bluebell, and the harebell, and the\npasque-flower--softest of all soft tints--likewise the delicate\nstitchwort, and the breath of the lingering primrose, and the white\nviolet that outvies its sister (that sweet usurper of the coloured\nname) in fragrance and in purity; and hiding for its life, without any\none to seek, the sensitive wood-sorrel; and, in and out, and behind\nthem all, the cups, and the sceptres, and the balls of moss, and the\nshells and the combs of lichen--in the middle of the whole, this\nfoolish maid had not one thought to throw to them. She ought to have\nsighed at their power of coming one after another for ever, whereas\nher own life was but a morning dew; but she failed to make any such\nreflection.\n\nWhat she was thinking of she never could have told; except that she\nhad a long letter on her lap, and could not bring her mind to it. And\nhere in the hollow, when the warmth came round, of the evening fringed\nwith cloudlets, she was fairer than any of the buds or flowers, and\never so much larger. But she could not be allowed to bloom like them.\n\n\"Oh, I beg pardon,\" cried an unseen stranger in a very clear, keen\nvoice; \"I fear I am intruding in some private grounds. I was making a\nshort cut, which generally is a long one. If you will just show me how\nto get out again, I will get out with all speed, and thank you.\"\n\nGrace looked around with surprise but no fear. She knew that the voice\nwas a gentleman's; but until she got up, and looked up the little\nhollow, she could not see any one. \"Please not to be frightened,\" said\nthe gentleman again; \"I deserve to be punished, perhaps, but not to\nthat extent. I fancied that I knew every copse in the county. I have\nproved, and must suffer for, my ignorance.\"\n\nAs he spoke he came forward on a little turfy ledge, about thirty feet\nabove her; and she saw that he looked at her with great surprise. She\nfelt that she had been crying very sadly, and this might have made her\neyes look strange. Quite as if by accident, she let her hair drop\nforward, for she could not bear to be so observed; and at that very\nmoment there flowed a gleam of sunshine through it. She was the very\npainting of the picture in her father's room.\n\n\"Saints in heaven!\" cried Hardenow, who never went further than this\nin amazement, \"I have found Grace Oglander! Stop, if you please--I\nbeseech you, stop!\"\n\nBut Grace was so frightened, and so pledge-bound, that no adjuration\nstopped her. If Hardenow had only been less eager, there and then he\nmight have made his bow, and introduced himself. But Gracie thought of\nthe rabbit-man, and her promise, and her loneliness, and without\nlooking back, she was round the corner, and not a ribbon left to trace\nher by. And now again if Hardenow had only been less eager, he might\nhave caught the fair fugitive by following in her footsteps. But for\nsuch a simple course as that he was much too clever. Instead of\nrunning down at once to the spot where she had vanished, and thence\ngiving chase, he must needs try a cross cut to intercept her. There\nwere trees and bushes in the way, it was true, but he would very soon\nget through them; and to meet her face to face would be more dignified\nthan to run after her.\n\nSo he made a beautifully correct cast as to the line she must have\ntaken, and aiming well ahead of her, leaped the crest of the hollow\nand set off down the hill apace. But here he was suddenly checked by\nmeeting a dense row of hollies, which he had not seen by reason of the\nbrushwood. In a dauntless manner he dashed in among them, scratching\nhis face and hands, and losing a fine large piece of black kerseymere\nfrom the skirt of his coat, and suffering many other lesser damages.\nBut what was far worse, he lost Grace also; for out of that holly\ngrove he could not get for a long, long time; and even then he found\nhimself on the wrong side--the one where he had entered.\n\nIf good Anglo-Catholics ever did swear, the Rev. Thomas Hardenow must\nnow have sworn, for his plight was of that kind which engenders wrath\nin the patient, and pleasantry on the part of the spectator. His face\nsuggested recent duello with a cat, his white tie was tattered and\nhanging down his back, his typical coat was a mere postilion's jacket,\nand the condition of his gaiters afforded to the sceptic the clearest\nproof of the sad effects of perpetual self-denial. His hat, with the\ninstinct of self-preservation, had rolled out from the thicket when he\nfirst rushed in; and now he picked up this wiser portion of his head,\nand was thankful to have something left.\n\nChances were against him; but what is chance? He had an exceedingly\nstrong will of his own, and having had the worst of this matter so\nfar, he was doubly resolved to go through with it. Without a second\nthought about his present guise or aspect, he ran back to the spot\nwhich he had left so unadvisedly. There he did what he ought to have\ndone ten minutes or a quarter of an hour ago, he ran down the slope to\nthe nest in the nook which had been occupied by Grace. Then he took to\nthe track which she had taken; but she had been much too quick for\nhim; she had even snatched up her letter, so that he was none the\nwiser. He came to a spot where the narrow and thickly woven trackway\nbroke into two; and whether of the two to choose was more than a\nmoment's doubt to him. Then he seemed to see some glint of footsteps,\nand sweep of soft sprays by a dress towards the right; and making a\ndash through a dark hole towards it, was straightway enveloped in a\ndoubled rabbit-net, cast over his surviving hat.\n\n\"Hold un tight, Jarge, now thou'st got un!\" cried out somebody whom he\ncould not see, \"poachin' son of a gun, us'll poach un!\"\n\n\"Poaching--my good friends,\" cried Hardenow, trying to lift his arms\nand turn his head round, all vainly; \"you can scarcely know the\nmeaning of that word, or you never would think of applying it to me.\nLet me see you, that I may explain. I have been trespassing, I am\nafraid; but by the purest accident--allow me to turn round, and reason\nquietly; I have the greatest objection to violence; I never use, nor\nallow it to be used. If you are honest gamekeepers, exceeding your\nduty through earnest zeal, I would be the last to find fault with you;\nwant of earnestness is the great fault of this age. But you must not\nallow yourselves to be misled by some little recent mischances to my\nclothes. Such things befall almost everybody exploring unknown places.\nYou are pulling me! you are exceeding your duty! Is the bucolic mind\nso dense? Here I am at your mercy--just show yourselves. You may choke\nme if you like, but the result will be--oh!--that you will also be\nchoked yourselves!\"\n\n\"A rare fine-plucked one as ever I see,\" said rabbiting George to\nLeviticus Cripps, when Hardenow lay between them, senseless from the\npressure upon his throat; \"ease him off a bit, my lad, he never done\nno harm to me. They long-coated parsons is good old women, and he be\ncut up into a young gal now. Lay hold on the poor devil, right end\nforemost, zoon as I have stopped uns praching. Did ever you see such a\nguy out of a barrow?\"\n\nHeavy-witted Tickuss made no answer, but laid hold of the captive by\nhis shoulders, so that himself might be still unseen, if consciousness\nshould return too soon. Black George tucked the feet under his arm,\nafter winding the tail of the net round the shanks, and expressing\nsurprise at their slimness; and in no better way than this these two\nignorant bumpkins swung the body of one of the leading spirits of the\nrising age to the hog-pound.\n\nThomas Hardenow was not the man to be long insensible. Every fibre of\nhis frame was a wire of electric life. He was \"all there\"--to use a\nslang expression, which, by some wondrous accident, has a little pith\nin it--in about two minutes; not a bit of him was absent; and he\nshowed it by hanging like a lump upon his bearers as they fetched him\nto an empty hog-house, dropped him anyhow, and locked him in; then one\nof them jumped on a little horse and galloped off to Oxford.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII.\n\nCOMBINED WISDOM.\n\n\n\"I really cannot go on like this,\" said Mr. Sharp to Mrs. Sharp, quite\nearly on the following morning. \"Thank God, I am not of a nervous\nnature, and patience is one of my largest virtues. But acting, as I\nhave done, for the best, I cannot be expected to put up with perpetual\nsuspense. This very day I will settle this matter, one way or the\nother.\" The lawyer for the first time now was flurried; he had heard\nof the capture of a spy last night--for so poor Hardenow had been\ndescribed--and though he had kept that new matter to himself, he was\npuzzled to see his way through with it.\n\n\"Luke, my dear,\" replied Mrs. Sharp, with some of her tightenings not\ndone up, \"surely there need not be such hurry. You make me quite\nshiver, when you speak like that. I shall come down to breakfast\nwithout any power; and the Port-meadow eel will go out for the maids.\nShould we ever behold it again, Luke?\"\n\n\"Of course not; how could you expect it? Slippery, slippery--hard it\nis to lay fast hold of anything; and the worst of all to bind is\nwoman. I do not mean you, my dear; you need not look like that; you\nare as firm as this tag of your stays--corset, corset--I beg pardon;\nhow can a man tell the fashionable words?\"\n\n\"But, Luke, you surely would not think of proceeding to extremities?\"\n\n\"Any extremity; if it only were the last. For the good of my family, I\nhave worked hard; and there never should have been all this worry with\nit. Miranda, I may have strayed outside the truth, and outside the\nlaw--which is so much larger--but one thing I beg you to bear in mind.\nNot a thing have I done, except for you and Kit. Money to me is the\nlast thing I think of; pure affection is the very first. And no one\ncan meddle with your settlement.\"\n\n\"Oh, my darling,\" Mrs. Sharp exclaimed, as she fell back from looking\nat the looking-glass, \"you are almost too good for this world, Luke!\nYou think of everybody in the world except yourself. It is not the\nright way to get on, dear. We must try to be a little harder.\"\n\n\"I have thought so, Miranda; I must try to do it. Petty little\nsentiments must be dropped. We must rise and face the state of things\nwhich it has pleased Providence to bring about. I am responsible for a\ngreat deal of it; and with your assistance, I will see it through. We\nmust take Kit in hand at once. My dear wife, can I rely upon you?\"\n\n\"Luke, you may rely upon me for anything short of perjury; and if it\ncomes to that, I must think first.\"\n\n\"No man ever had a better any more than he could have a truer wife, or\none so perpetually young.\" With these words Mr. Sharp performed some\nlittle operations, which, even in the \"highest circles,\" are sometimes\nallowed to be brought about by masculine hands, when clever enough;\nand before very long this affectionate pair went down to breakfast and\nenjoyed fried eel.\n\nKit, who had caught this fine eel, was not there; perhaps he was gone\nforth to catch another; so they left him the tail to be warmed up. In\nthe present condition of his active mind, and the mournful absence of\nhis beloved, Christopher found a dark and moody pleasure in laying\nnight-lines. If his snare were successful, he hauled out his victim,\nand, with a scornful smile, despatched him; if the line held nothing,\nhe cast it in again, with a sigh of habitual frustration. This\nmorning, however, he was not gone forth on his usual round of\ninspection, but had only walked up to the livery-stables, to make sure\nof his favourite hack for the day. He had made up his mind that he\nmust see Grace that very same day, come what would of it; he would go\nmuch earlier, and watch the door; and if this bad fortune still\ncontinued, he would rush up at last and declare himself.\n\nBut this bold resolve had a different issue; for no sooner had the\nyoung man, with some reluctance and self-reproach, dealt bravely with\na solid breakfast, than he was requested by his dear mother to come\ninto his father's little study.\n\nNow, this invitation was not in accordance with the present mood of\nChristopher. He had made up his mind to be off right soon for the\nbowers of his beloved, with a roll and some tongue in his little\nfishing-creel, and a bottle of beer in each holster. In the depth of\nthe wood he might thus get on, and enjoy to the utmost fruition of his\nheart all the beauty of nature around him. It was a cruel blow to\nmarch just then to a lecture from the governor, whose little private\nstudy he particularly loathed, and regarded as the den of the evil\none. However, he set up his pluck and went.\n\nMr. Sharp, looking (if possible) more upright and bright than usual,\nsat in front of the large and strong-legged desk, where he kept his\nmore private records, such as never went into the office. Mrs. Sharp\nalso took a legal chair, and contemplated Kit with a softer gaze. He\nwith a beating heart stood up, like a youth under orders to construe.\n\n\"My son,\" began the father and the master, in a manner large and\naffable, \"prepare yourself for a little surprise on the part of those\nwhose principal object is your truest welfare. For some weeks now you\nhave made your dear mother anxious and unhappy, by certain proceedings\nwhich you thought it wise and manly to conceal from her.\"\n\n\"Yes, you know you did, Kit!\" Mrs. Sharp interposed, shaking her short\ncurls, and trying to look fierce. The boy, with a deep blush, looked\nat her, as if everybody now was against him.\n\n\"Christopher, we will not blame you,\" resumed Mr. Sharp, rather\nhastily, for fear that his wife should jump up and spoil all. \"Our\nobject in calling you is not that. You have acted according to our\nwishes mainly, though you need not have done it so furtively. You have\nformed an attachment to a certain young lady, who leads for the\npresent a retired life, in a quiet part of the old Stow Wood. And she\nreturns your affection. Is it so, or is it not?\"\n\n\"I--I--I,\" stammered Kit, seeking for his mother's eyes, which had\nburied themselves in her handkerchief. \"I can't say a word about what\nshe thinks. She--she--she has got such a fashion of running away so.\nBut I--I--I--well, then, it's no good telling a lie about it; I am\ndeucedly fond of her!\"\n\n\"That is exactly what I wished to know; though not expressed very\ntastefully. Well, and do you know who she is, my son?\"\n\n\"Yes, I know all that quite well; as much as any fellow wants to know.\nShe is a young lady, and she knows all the flowers, and the birds, and\nthe names of the trees almost. She can put me right about the kings of\nEngland; and she knows my dogs as well as I do.\"\n\n\"A highly accomplished young lady, in short?\"\n\n\"Yes, I should say a great deal more than that. I care very little for\naccomplishments. But--but if I must come to the point--I do like her,\nand no mistake!\"\n\n\"Then you would not like some other man to come, and run away with\nher, quite against her will?\"\n\n\"That man must run over my body first,\" cried Kit, with so much spirit\nthat his father looked proud, and his poor mother trembled.\n\n\"Well, well, my boy,\" continued the good lawyer, \"it will be your own\nfault if the villain gets the chance. I am doing all I can to provide\nagainst it; and am even obliged to employ some means of a nature not\nat all congenial to me, for--for that very reason. You are sure that\nyou love this young lady, Kit?\"\n\n\"Father, I would not say anything strong; but I would go on my knees,\nall the way from here to there, for the smallest chance of getting\nher!\"\n\n\"Very good. That is as it should be. I would have done the very same\nfor your dear mother. Mamma, you have often reminded me of it, when\nanything--well, those are reminiscences; but they lie at the bottom of\neverything. A mercenary marriage is an outrage to all good feeling.\"\n\n\"She has not got a sixpence, father; she told me so. She makes all the\nbread, and she puts by all the dripping.\"\n\n\"My dear boy, you know then what a good wife is. Mamma, we shall have\nto clear out the room where the rocking-horse is, and the old\nmagic-lantern, and let this young couple go into it.\"\n\n\"My dear, it would be a long job; and there are a great many cracks in\nthe paper; but still we could have in old Josephine.\"\n\n\"Those are mere details, Momma. But this is a serious question; and\nthe boy must not be hurried. He may not have made up his mind; or he\nmay desire to change it to-morrow. He is too young to have any settled\nwill; and there is no reason why he should not wait----\"\n\n\"Not a day will I wait--not an hour would I wait; in ten minutes I\ncould pack everything!\"\n\n\"He might wait for a twelvemonth, my dear Miranda, and sound his own\nfeelings, and the young girl's too, if we could only be certain that\nthe young man of rank, with the four bay horses, was not in earnest\nwhen he swore to carry her off to-morrow.\"\n\n\"My dear husband,\" Mrs. Sharp said, softly; \"let us hope that he meant\nnothing by it. Such things are frequently said, and come to nothing.\"\n\n\"I tell you what it is,\" Kit almost shouted, with his fist upon the\nsacred desk; \"you cannot in any way enter into my feelings upon such\nmatters! I beg your pardon, that is not what I mean, and I ought never\nto have said it. But still, comparatively speaking, you can take these\nthings easily, and go on, and think people foolish--but I cannot. I\nknow when my mind is made up, and I do it. And to stop me with all\nsorts of nonsense--at least, to find fifty reasons why I should do\nnothing--is the surest of all ways to make me do it. I have many\npeople who will follow me through thick and thin; though you may not\nbelieve it, because you cannot understand me, and your views are\nconfined to propriety. Mine are not. And you may find that out in a\nvery short time. At any rate, if I do a thing that brings you, father\nand mother, into any evil words, all I can say is, you never should\nhave stopped me.\"\n\nWith this very lucid expression of ideas, Christopher strode away, and\nleft his parents petrified--as he thought. Mrs. Sharp was inclined to\nbe a dripping well; but Mr. Sharp was dry enough. \"Exactly, exactly,\"\nhe said, as he always said when a thing had come up to his reckoning;\n\"nothing could have been done much better. Put the money in his best\nbreeches' pocket, my dear, without my knowledge; and at the back-door\nkiss him. Adjure him to do nothing rash; and lend him your own\nwedding-ring, and weep. For a runaway match the most lucky of all\nthings is the boy's mother's wedding-ring. And above all things, not a\nword about his rival, until he asks--and then all mystery; only you\nknow a great deal more than you dare tell.\"\n\n\"Oh, Luke, are you sure that it will all go aright?\"\n\n\"Miranda, tell me anything we can be sure of, and you will have given\nme a new idea. And I want ideas; I want them sadly. My power of\ninvention is failing me, or at any rate that of combining my\ninventions. You did not observe that I was nervous, did you?\"\n\n\"Nervous! Luke--you nervous! I should think that the end of the world\nwas coming if I saw any nervousness in you! And in the presence of a\nboy, indeed----\"\n\n\"My dear wife, I will give you my word that I felt--well, I will not\nsay 'nervous,' if you dislike it--but a little uncomfortable, and not\nquite clear, when I saw how Kit was taking things. Real affection is a\ndreadful thing. I did not want so much of it. I meant to have told him\nwho she is, till the turn of things made me doubt about it. But he is\nquite up for anything now, I believe, though he must be told before he\ngoes. He is such a calf that he must not imagine that she has a\nsixpence to bless herself. He would fly off in a moment if he guessed\nthe truth. He must know her name; and that you must tell him; and you\nknow how to explain it all a thousand-fold better than I do.\"\n\n\"Possibly I do,\" replied Mrs. Sharp; \"I may have some very few ideas\nof my own; although according to you, Mr. Sharp, I am only the mother\nof a calf!\"\n\n\"Very well said, my dear. And I have the honour of being his father.\"\nThey smiled at one another, for they both knew how to give and take.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\n\nMASCULINE ERROR.\n\n\nChristopher Fermitage Sharp, Esquire, strode forth, to have room as\nwell as time for thought. His comely young face was unusually red, and\nhe stroked his almost visible moustache, as a stimulant to manhood. So\ndeep and stern were his meditations, that he never even thought of his\npipe until he came to a bridge on the Botley road, whereon he was\naccustomed to lean, and smoke, and gaze at the little fish quietly.\nFrom the force of habit he pulled out his meerschaum, flint and steel,\nand German tinder, and through blue rings of his own creation, watched\nand envied the little fish. For though it was not yet the manner of\nhis mind to examine itself very deeply, he had a strong conviction\nthat the fish were happy, and that he was miserable. Upon the former\npoint there could not be two opinions--unless the fish themselves held\none--when any man observed how the little fellows jumped at the\nspicy-flavoured flies (that fluttered on fluid gold to them), or\nflashed in and out among one another, with a frolicsome spread of\nsilver, or, best of all, in calm contemplation, softly moved pellucid\nfins, and gently opened fans of gills, with magnifying eyes intent\nupon the glory of the lustrous world. Kit considered them with an\nenvious gaze. Were they harassed, were they tortured, were they racked\nwith agonised despair, by the proceedings of the female fish?\n\nCompelled to turn his grim thoughts inward, he knew not that he was\njealous. He only knew that if he were to meet the young nobleman with\nthe four bay horses, it would be an evil day for one of them. Tush,\nwhy should he not go and forestall that bloated, unprincipled\naristocrat--whose intentions might even be dishonourable--by having\nfour horses himself, and persuading that queen of beauty to elope with\nhim? He had given his parents due notice; and if he had done what they\nwished by thus falling in love, it could not be very much against\ntheir wishes if he made a hasty match of it. But could this lovely\nyoung American be persuaded to come with him. He had far too much\nrespect for her to dream of using violence. But surely if he could\nconvince her of the peril she was in, and could promise her safe\nrefuge with a grave old lady, a valued relative of his own, while she\nshould have time to consider his suit, his devotion, his eternal\nconstancy, his everlasting absorption into her higher and purer\nidentity--\n\nHe pulled out his purse; it contained four and sixpence--a shilling\nand three halfpence for each horse, and nothing for the postilions.\n\"We must do it less grandly,\" he said to himself; \"and after all it\nwill be better so. How could four horses ever get through that wood? I\nmust have been a fool to think of it. A very light chaise and pair\nwill do ten times better, at a quarter of the money. I can get tick\nfor that from old Squeaker himself; and the governor will have to pay;\nit need not cost me more than half a crown, and about three bob for\nturnpikes. Fifteen miles to old Aunt Peggy's on the Wycombe road. Once\nthere, I defy them to do what they like. I am always the master of\nthat house, and I know where they keep the blunderbuss. I have the\ngreatest mind not to go home at all, but complete my arrangements\nimmediately. Squeaker would lend me a guinea with pleasure; he is a\nlarge-minded man, I am sure. What a fool I was to give poor Cinnaminta\nsuch a quantity of tin that day!--and yet how could I help it? I might\nhave gone on like a lord but for that.\"\n\nKit turned round and shook his head in several directions, trying to\nbring to his mind the places where money might be hoped for. Than this\nthere is no mental effort more difficult and absorbing. No wonder\ntherefore that, in this contemplation, he did not hear the up-mail\nfull-gallop, springing the arch from the Cheltenham side, to make a\nfine run into Oxford. \"Hoi there, stoopid!\" the coachman shouted, for\nthe bridge was narrow, and the coach danced across it, with the vigour\nof the well-corded team. \"Oh, Kit, is it? Climb for your hat, Kit.\"\n\nKit's best friend--so far as he had any friends in the University--by\na stroke of fine art, sent the lash of his whip round the hat of the\nhero, and deposited it, ere one might cry, \"Where art thou gone?\" on\nthe oil-cloth, which sat on the top of the luggage, which sat on the\ntop of the coach which he drove, like the heir of all the race of\nNimshi. The hireling Jehu sat beside him, and having been at it since\nnine o'clock last night, snored with a flourish not inferior to that\nwhich the mail-guard began upon his horn.\n\nKit was familiar with a coach at speed, as every young Englishman at\nthat time was. In a twinkle he dashed at the hind-boot, laid hold of\nthe handle, and was up at once; the guard, with an eye to an honest\nhalf-crown, moving sideways, but offering no help, because it would\nhave been an insult. Then over the hump of the luggage crawled Kit,\nand clapped his own hat on his head, and between the shoulders of two\nfat passengers, threw forth his strong arm, and \"bonneted\" the\nspanking son of Nimshi. The leaders ran askew, till they were caught\nup; and the smart young driver would have thrown down the reins, and\ncommitted a personal assault on Kit, who was perfectly ready to reply\nto it--being skilled in the art of self-defence--if the two fat\npassengers, having seen the whole, had not joined hands, and stopped\nit.\n\n\"Tit for tat; tit for tat!\" they cried; \"Squire, you began it, and you\nhave your due.\" And so, with a hearty laugh, on they galloped.\n\n\"If you should have anything to say to me,\" cried Kit, as he swung\nhimself off the early mail, at the corner of his native Cross Duck\nLane, \"you will know where to find me. But you must wait a day or two,\nfor I have a particular engagement.\"\n\n\"All rubbish, Kit! Come and wine with me at seven. I shall have tooled\nhome the 'Nonpareil' by then.\"\n\nChristopher, though stern, was placable. He kissed his hand to his\nreconciled friend, while he shook his head, to decline the invitation,\nand strode off vigorously to consult his mother. To consult his dear\nmother meant to get money out of her, which was a very easy thing to\ndo; and having a good deal of conscience, Kit seldom abused that\nopportunity, unless he was really driven to it. Metallic necessity was\non him now; his courage had been rising for the last half-hour. \"Faint\nheart never won fair lady,\" rang to the tune of many horses' feet. His\ndash through the air had set his spirits flying; his exploit, and the\napplause thereof, had taught him his own value. From this day forth he\nwas a man of the world; and a man of the world was entitled to a wife.\n\nIt is the last infirmity of noble and too active minds, to feel that\nnothing is done well unless their presence guides it; to doubt the\npossibility of sage prevision and nice conduct, through the ins and\nouts of things, if ever the master-spirit trusts the master-body to be\naway, and the countless eyes of the brain to give twinkle, instead of\nthe two solid lights of the head. Hence it was that Mr. Sharp, at\nsight of Kit, came forth to meet him, although he had arranged to send\nthe mother. And this--as Mrs. Sharp declared to her dying day--was the\ngreatest mistake ever made by a man of most wonderful mind; while she\nwas putting away the linen.\n\n\"Come in here, my boy,\" he said to his son, who was strictly vexed to\nsee him, and yearning to be round the corner; \"there are one or two\nthings that have never been made quite clear to your understanding. We\ndo not expect you to be too clear-sighted at your time of life, and so\non. Come in that I may have a word with you.\"\n\nChristopher, with a little thrill of fear, once more entered the\nsacred den, and there stood as usual; while his father sat and\nregarded him with a lightsome smile. One of the many causes which had\nlong been at work to impair the young man's filial affection was, that\nhis father behaved as if it were not worth while to be in earnest with\nhim; as if Kit Sharp had a mind no riper than just to afford amusement\nto mature and busy intellects. Christopher knew his own depth, and was\ntrying to be strong too, whenever he could think of it. And if he did\nspend most of his time in sport and congenial pastime, of one thing he\nwas certain--that he never did harm to any one. Could his father say\nthat much for himself?\n\n\"Aha, my boy, aha,\" said the elder Sharp in that very same vein which\nalways so annoyed and vexed his son; \"what will you give me for a\nlittle secret, a sweet little secret about a young lady in whom you\ntake the deepest interest?\"\n\nThe ingenuous youth, in spite of all efforts, could not help blushing\ndeeply; for he had a purely candid skin, reproduced from Piper\nancestry. And the sense of hot cheeks made him glow to the vital\ncentres of the nobler stuff. Therefore he scraped with his toes--which\nwas a trick of his--and kept silence.\n\n\"Pocket money gone again?\" continued his father pleasantly; \"nothing\nto offer his kind papa for most valuable information? Courting is an\nexpensive business--I ought to have remembered that. And the younger\nthe parties the more it costs; hot-house flowers, and a\nsmelling-bottle, a trifle of a ring, just to learn the size; that\nbeing accepted, the bolder brooch, charmed bracelet, and locket for\nthe virgin heart--no wonder you are short of cash, my Kit.\"\n\n\"You don't know one atom about it,\" cried Christopher, boiling with\nmeritorious wrath. \"I never gave her nothing--and she wouldn't have\nit!\"\n\n\"The double negative, to be sure. How forcible and how natural it is!\nWell, well, my boy, let us try to believe you. Scatter all doubts by\nexhibiting your wealth. You had five pounds and ten shillings lately;\nand you pay nothing for anything that can be placed to your father's\ncredit. Let me see your cash-box, Kit.\"\n\n\"This is all that I have at present,\" said Christopher, pulling out\nhis three-and-sixpence--for he had given the guard a shilling; \"but\nyou must not suppose that this is all to which I am entitled. I have\nI.O.U's from junior members of the University for really more than I\ncan reckon up; and every one of them will get the money from his\nsisters, in the long vacation.\"\n\n\"Oh, Kit, Kit! The firm ends with me. I must sell the good-will for\nthe very worst old song, if it once leaks out what a fool you are. By\nwhat strange cross of reckless blood can such a boy be the future head\nof Piper, Pepper, Sharp, & Co.?\" Mr. Sharp covered up his long clear\nhead, and hid--for this once--true emotion. Kit looked at the kerchief\nwith a very queer glance. He was not at all affected by this\nlamentation, however just, because he had heard it so often before;\nand he never could make out exactly how much of him his father could\nmanage to descry through that veil Palladian.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" he said, \"you have always told me, as long as I can\nremember, that I was to be a gentleman; and gentlemen trust one\nanother.\"\n\n\"Very well said!\" Mr. Sharp replied, with a deeply irritating smile;\n\"and now I will trust you, young sir, in a matter of importance.\nRemember that I trust you as a gentleman--for I need not tell you one\nword, unless I choose--and if I depart from my usual practice, it is\npartly because you are beginning to claim a sort of maturity. Very\nwell, let us see if it can be relied upon. You pledge your word to\nkeep silence, and I tell you what you never could find out.\"\n\nKit was divided with his mind in twain; whether he should draw the\nsharp falchion of his wit, or whether he should rather speak honeysome\nwords; and, as nearly always happens when Minerva is admitted, he\nbetook himself to the gentler process.\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" he said, pulling up his collar, as if he had\nwhiskers to push it down, \"whatever I am told in confidence is allowed\nto go no further. It is scarcely necessary for me to say that I\nreserve, of course, the final right of reference to my honour.\"\n\n\"To be sure, and to your ripe judgment and almost patriarchal\nexperience, Kit. Then be it known to you, aged youth, that you have\nnot shown hoar sagacity. You do not even know who the lady is whom you\nhave honoured with your wise addresses.\"\n\n\"And I don't care a d----n who she is,\" cried Kit, \"so long as I love\nher, and she loves me!\"\n\n\"My son, you are turbulent and hasty. Your wisdom has left you\nsuddenly. Your manners also; or you would not swear in the presence of\nyour father.\"\n\n\"Sir, I was wrong; and I beg your pardon. But I think that I learned\nthe first way of it from you.\"\n\n\"Kit, Kit, recall that speech! You must have gone altogether dreaming\nlately. My discourse is always moderate, and to the last degree\nprofessional. However, in spite of the generous impulse, which\nscarcely seems natural at your threescore years and ten, it does seem\na needful precaution to learn the name, style, and title of the lady\nwhom you will vow to love, honour, and--obey.\"\n\n\"Her name,\" cried Kit, without any sense of legal phrase and jingle,\n\"is Grace Holland. Her style is a great deal better than anybody\nelse's. And as for title, such rubbish is unknown in the gigantic\nyoung nation to which she belongs.\"\n\n\"Her name,\" said Mr. Sharp, setting his face for the conquest of this\nboy, and fixing keen hard eyes upon him, \"is Grace Oglander, the\ndaughter of the old Squire of Beckley. Her style--in your sense of the\nword--is that of a rustic young lady; and her title, by courtesy, is\nMiss--a barbarous modern abbreviation.\"\n\nThe youth was at first too much amazed to say a word; for he was not\nquick-witted, as his father was. He gave a little gasp, and his fine\nbrown eyes, which he could not remove from his father's, changed their\nexpression from defiance to doubt, and from doubt to fear, and from\nfear to sorrow, with a little dawning of contempt. \"Why, my man, is\nthis beyond your experience of life?\" asked Luke Sharp, trying to look\nhis son down, but failing, and beginning to grow uneasy. Kit's face\nwas aflame with excitement, and his lips were trembling; but his eyes\ngrew stern.\n\n\"Father, I hope you do not mean what you have said--that you are only\njoking with me--at any rate, that you have not known it--that you have\nnot done it--that you have not even left poor old Mr. Oglander one\nhour----\"\n\n\"Wait, boy, wait! You know nothing about it. Who are you to judge of\nsuch matters, indeed? Remember to whom you are speaking, if you\nplease. I have done what was right; and for your sake I have done it.\"\n\n\"For my sake! Why, I never had seen the young lady before I was told\nthat she was dead and buried--murdered, as everybody said--and the\ntracing of the criminals was mainly left to you! I longed to help, but\nI knew that you despised me; and now do you mean to say that you did\nit?\"\n\nLuke Sharp was a quick-tempered man. He had borne a great deal more\nthan usual. And now he spoke with vast disdain.\n\n\"To be sure, Kit, I murdered her; as is proved to such a mind as yours\nby the fact of her being now alive! What can I have done to have a\nfool for my son?\"\n\n\"And what have I done to have a rogue for a father? You may knock me\ndown, sir, if you please!\"--for Mr. Sharp arose, as if that would be\nhis next proceeding;--\"you have always used your authority very much\nin that manner with me. I don't want to be knocked down; but if it\nwill do you any good, pray proceed to it; and down I go.\"\n\n\"I declare, after all, you have got some little wit,\" cried the\nlawyer, with a smile withdrawing, and recovering self-command. \"I\ncannot be angry with a boy like you, because you know no better. Oh,\nhere comes your mother! Your excitement has aroused her. Mamma, you\nhave not the least idea what a lion you have to answer for. I leave\nhim to you, my dear. Soothe him, feed him, and try to find his\nhumming-top.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX.\n\nPROMETHEUS VINCTUS.\n\n\n\"I will not die like this! It is unseemly to die like this!\" the Rev.\nThomas Hardenow was exclaiming at this very time, but a few miles off.\n\"I hope I am not a coward altogether; but the ignominy is unbearable.\nIn this den of Eum\u00c3\u00a6us, this sty of Sycorax, entangled in the meshes of\na foul hog-net, and with hogs' grunt, grunt, for the chorus of my\nwoes! My Prometheus class is just waiting for me at the present\nmoment, so far as I can reckon here the climbing of the day; and I had\nrendered into English verses that delicious bit of chorus--'With thy\nwoes of mighty groaning, mortals feel a fellow-moaning, And of Colchic\nland indwellers, maids who never quail in fight;' and so on--how\nsmall-minded of me to forget it now!--down to, 'And springs of\nholy-watered rivers wail thy pitiable woe.' But instead of nymphs of\nocean, here comes that old pig again! If he could only grout up that\nboard--which he must do sooner or later--what part of me will he begin\nupon? Probably this little finger--it is so white and helpless! If I\ncould only, only move!--to be eaten alive by pigs! Well, well--there\nis not so very much left for them. Infinitely better men have had a\nlower end than that. Only I would bend my knees--if bend them I\ncould--to the Giver of all good, that I may be insensible before the\npigs begin.\"\n\nHis plight was a very unfortunate one; but still in the blackest veil\nof woe there is sure to be some little threadbare place--from so many\npeople having worn that veil--and even poor Hardenow had one good\n\"look-out.\" To wit, although he had been without food for\nsix-and-twenty hours now (having been caught in the treacherous toils\nsoon after he set his toes towards his dinner), he was not by any\nmeans in the same state in which a Low-Church clergyman must have\nbeen. His system was so attuned to fasting, and all his parts so\ndisciplined, that \"cupboard\" was only whispered among them in a\nsubmissive manner; and even his stomach concluded sorrowfully that it\nmust be Friday.\n\nBeyond this considerable advantage--which could not last much\nlonger--there was really little to console him. His cowardly captors,\nnot content with the rabbit-net twined round him, had swathed him also\nin the stronger meshes of a corded gig-net. And even after that, Black\nGeorge, having had the handling of his legs, and discovered the vigour\nof their boniness, was so impressed that he called out--\"I never did\nheckle such a wiry chap. Fetch a pair of they tough thongs, Tickuss,\nsame as thou makest use of for ringing of the pigs, my lad.\"\n\n\"Whish!--can't 'ee whish, with my name so pat?\" Leviticus whispered\nsulkily; but he brought the unyielding thongs, wherewith the fellow\nand tutor of Brasenose very soon had his wrists and ankles strapped.\nAnd in spite of all struggles through the livelong night, as firmly as\na trussed hare was he fixed.\n\nNevertheless, he could roll a little, though not very fast, because\nhis elbows stopped him; for being of the sharpest they stuck into the\nground, which was of a loamy nature. He fought with this difficulty,\nas with every other; for a braver heart never dwelled in any body,\nwhether fat or lean; and he plucked up his angles from their bed of\nearth, whenever the limits of cord would yield. He knew all about the\nmanufacture of twine--so far as one not in the trade could know\nit--because he had got up the subject for the sake of a whipcord of a\npuzzle in Theocritus; but this only served to make his case the worse;\nfor at that time honest string was made. The dressing, and the facing,\nand the thousand other rogueries, make it quite impossible to tie a\ngood knot now; and even if a strap has any leather in it, its first\noperation is a compromise.\n\nBut at that stouter period, bind made bound. Mr. Hardenow could roll a\nlittle; but that was as much as he could do. And rolling did him very\nlittle good, except by way of exercise; because he was pulled up short\nso suddenly by feather-edged boarding, with a coat of tar. The place\nin which he was penned was most unworthy of such an occupant. It was\nnot even the principal meal-house, or the best treasury of \"wash.\" It\nwas not the kitchen of the tasteful pigs, or even their back-kitchen,\nbut something combining the qualities of their scullery and dust-bin.\nBut the floor was clean, and a man lying lowly, so far as smell was\nconcerned, had certainly the best of the situation; inasmuch as all\nodours must ascend to the pure ether of the exalted. Hardenow knew\nthat it was vain to roll, because the door was padlocked, and the\nlower end, to which he chiefly tended, had a loose board, lifted every\nnow and then by the unringed snout of a very good old sow. Pure\ncuriosity was her motive, and no evil appetite, as her eyes might\ntell. She had never seen a fellow and a tutor of a college rolling, as\nshe herself loved to do; and yet in a comparatively clumsy way. She\ngrunted deep disapproval of his movements, and was vexed that her\ninstructions were entirely thrown away.\n\n\"Ah, Linus, Linus be the cry; and let the good be conqueror!\" Mr.\nHardenow quoted, as his legs began to ache; \"henceforth, if I have any\nhenceforth, how palpably shall I realise the difference between the\nalindethra and the circular conistra! In this limited place I combine\nthe two; but without the advantages of either. I take it that, whether\nof horse, or hen, or human being, the essential condition of\nrevolutionary enjoyment is--that the limbs be free. In my case, they\nare not free. The exhilaration which would ensue, and of which, if I\nremember rightly, Pliny speaks--or is it \u00c3\u0086lian?--my memory seems to be\nrolling too; but be the authority what it will, in my case that\nexhilaration is (at least for the moment) not forthcoming. But I ought\nto condemn myself far rather than writers who treat of a subject with\nthe gravity of authority; that is to say, if they ever tried it.\n'Experimentum in corpore vili,' is what all writers have preferred. If\ntheir own bodies were not too noble, what powerful impress they might\nhave left!\"\n\nAfter such a cynical delivery as this, it served him particularly\nright to hit, in the course of revolution, upon a bit of bone even\nharder than his own; a staunch piece of noble old ossification\n(whether of herbivorous, carnivorous, or omnivorous dragon), such as\nwould have brought Professor Buckland from Christ Church headlong, or\neven Professor Owen, from the British Museum, the Melampus of all good\ndragons. Hardenow knew nothing about it; except that it ran into him,\nand jerked him in such a way over the ground, that he got into the\nhighest corner, and gladly would have rubbed himself, if good hemp had\nyielded room for it.\n\nBut this sad blow, which seemed at first the buffet of the third and\ncrowning billow of his woe, proved to be a blessing in disguise;\ninasmuch as the reaction impelled him to a spot where he descried some\nencouragement to work. And a little encouragement was enough for him.\nBy virtue of inborn calmness, long classical training and memories,\nand pure Anglo-Catholic discipline, the young man was still \"as fresh\nas paint,\" in a trouble which would have exhausted the vigour of a far\nmore powerful and fiery man. Russel Overshute, for instance, even in\nhis best health would have worn his wits out long ago, by futile\nwrath, and raving hunger.\n\nMr. Hardenow could not even guess how there came to be quite a thick\ncluster of pretty little holes, of about the size of a swan's quill,\ndrilled completely through the board against which his mishap had\ndriven him. The board was a stoutish slab of larch, cut\n\"feather-edged;\" and the saw having struck upon most of these holes\nobliquely, their form was elliptic instead of round, and their axes\nnot being at right angles to the board, they attracted no attention by\nadmitting light, since the light of course entered obliquely. In some\nparts as close as the holes of a colander, in other places scattered\nmore widely, they jotted the plank for nearly a yard of its length,\nand afforded a fine specimen of the penetrative powers of a colony of\n_Sirex gigas_, so often mistaken for the hornet.\n\nBut though as to their efficient cause he could form no opinion,\nHardenow hoped that their final cause might be to save his life; which\nhe quietly believed to be in great peril. For he knew that he lay in\nthe remote obscurity of a sad and savage wood, unvisited by justice,\ntrade, or benefit of clergy. Here, if no good spirit came, or unseen\ngenius, to release him, die he must at his own leisure, which would be\na long one. And he could discover no moral to be read from his\npre-historic skeleton; unless it were that very low one--\"stick to thy\nown business.\"\n\nA man of ordinary mind would not have troubled his head about this.\n\"_Post me, diluvium_,\" is the strengthening sentiment of this age; no\nfulcrum whatever for any good work; and the death of all immortality.\nHardenow would have none of that; he had no idea of leaving ashes fit\nto nourish nothing. Collecting his energies for a noble protest\nagainst having lived altogether in vain, he brought his fettered\nheels, like a double-headed hammer, as hard as his probolistic swing\ncould whirl, against the very thickest-crowded cells of bygone\ndomicile. The wooden shed rang, and the uprights shook, and the nose\nof the sow at the lower end was jarred, and her feelings hurt; for,\ntruly speaking, her motives had been misunderstood. And if Hardenow\nhad but kept pigs of his own, he would have gone to work down there,\nto help her, and so perhaps have got her to release him from his\ntoils. Everybody, however, must be allowed to go to work in his own\nway: and to find fault with him, when he tries to do his best, is (as\nall kind critics own) alike ungraceful and ungracious. Mr. Hardenow\nworked right hard, as he always did at everything, and his heels had\ntheir sparables as good as new, and capable of calcitration, though he\nwore nothing stronger than Oxford shoes with a bow of silk ribbon on\nthe instep. The ribbon held fast, and he kicked or rather swung his\nfeet by a process of revolution, as bravely as if he had Hessian boots\non. At the very first stroke he had fetched out a splinter as big as\nthe scoop of a marrow-spoon; and delivering his coupled heels\nprecisely where little tunnels afforded target, in a quarter of an\nhour he had worked a good hole, and was able to refresh himself with\nthe largeness of the outer world.\n\nNot that he could, however skilled now in rolling, roll himself out of\nhis black jail yet--for the piece punched out was only four inches\nwide--but that he got a very decent width (in proportion at least to\nman's average view) for clear consideration of the world outside. And\nwhat he saw now was a pretty little sight, or peep at country scenery.\nFor the wood, just here, was not so thick that a man could not see it\nby reason of the trees--as the Irishman forcibly observed--but a\ndotted slope of bush and timber widening and opening sunny reaches out\nof the narrow forest track. There was no house to be seen, nor\ncottage, nor even barn or stable, nor any moving creature, except a\npig or two grouting in the tufted grass, and gray-headed daws at\nleisure perking and prying, for the good of their home-circle.\n\nBut presently the prisoner espied a wicket-gate, nearly at the bottom\nof the sylvan slope, with a little space roughly stoned before\nit--almost a sure sign, in a neighbourhood like that, of a human\ndwelling-place inside. And when Hardenow's eyes, recovering tone,\nassured him of the existence of some moss-grown steps, for the\nclimbing of a horse upon either side, he felt a sudden (though it may\nnot have been a strictly logical) happiness, from the warm idea that\nthere must be some of the human race not far from him. He placed his\nlips close to the hole which he had made, and shouted his very\nloudest, and then stopped a little while, to watch what might come of\nit, and then sent forth another shout. But nothing came of it, except\nthat the pigs pricked up their ears and looked around and grunted; and\nthe jackdaws gave a little jerk or two, and flapped their wings, but\ndid not fly; and a soft woody echo, of a fibrous texture, answered as\nweakly as a boy who does not know.\n\nThis was pretty much what Hardenow expected. He saw that the\nwicket-gate was a long way off, three or four hundred yards perhaps;\nbut he did not know that his jailer, Tickuss Cripps, was the man who\nlived inside of it. Otherwise his sagacious mind would have yielded\nquiet mercy to his lungs. For Leviticus was such a cruel and cowardly\nblunderer, that, in mere terror, he probably would have dashed grand\nbrains out. But luckily he was far away now, and so were all other\nspies and villains; and only a little child--boy or girl, at that\ndistance nobody could say which--toddled out to the wicket-gate, and\nlaid fat arms against it, and laboured, with impatient grunts, to push\nit open. Having seen no one for a long time now, Hardenow took an\nextraordinary interest in the efforts of this child. The success or\nthe failure of this little atom could not in any way matter to him;\nyet he threw his whole power of sight into the strain of the distant\nconflict. He made up his mind that if the child got out, he should be\nable to do the like.\n\nThen having most accurate \"introspection\" (so far as humanity has such\ngift) he feared that his mind must be a little on the wane, ere ever\nsuch weakness entered it. To any other mind the wonder would have been\nthat his should continue to be so tough; but he hated shortcomings,\nand began to feel them. Laying this nice question by, until there\nshould be no child left to look at, he gazed with his whole might at\nthis little peg of a body, in the distance, toppling forward, and\nthrowing out behind the weight of its great efforts. He wondered at\nhis own interest--as we all ought to wonder, if we took the trouble.\nThis little peg, now in battle with the gate, was a solid Peg in\nearnest; a fine little Cripps, about five years old, as firm as if\njust turned out of a churn. She was backward in speech, as all the\nCrippses are; and she rather stared forth her ideas than spoke them.\nBut still, let her once get a settlement concerning a thing that must\nbe done to carry out her own ideas; and in her face might be seen,\nonce for all, that stop she never would till her own self had done it.\nHardenow could not see any face, but he felt quite a surety of\nsturdiness, from the solid mould of attitude.\n\nThat heavy gate, standing stiffly on its heels, groaned\nobstreperously, and gibed at the unripe passion of this little maid.\nIt banged her chubby knees, and it bruised her warted hand, and it\neven bestowed a low cowardly buffet upon her expressive and determined\ncheek. And while she lamented this wrong, and allowed want of judgment\nto kick out at it, unjust it may have been, but true it is, that she\nreceived a still worse visitation. The forefoot of the gate, which was\nquite shaky and rattlesome in its joints, came down like a skittle-pin\nupon her little toes, which were only protected on a Sunday. \"Ototoi,\nOtotoi!\" cried Mr. Hardenow, with a thrilling gush of woe, as if his\nown toes were undergoing it. Bitter, yet truly just, lamentation awoke\nall the echoes of the woods and hills, and Hardenow thought that it\nwas all up now--that this small atom of the wooded world would accept\nher sad fate, and run in to tell her mother.\n\nBut no; this child was the Carrier's niece; and a man's niece--under\nsome law of the Lord, untraced by acephalous progeny--takes after him\noftentimes a great deal closer than his own beloved daughter does.\nWhether or no, here was this little animal, as obstinate as the very\nCarrier. Taught by adversity she did thus:--Against the gate-post she\nsettled her most substantial availability, and exerted it, and spared\nit not. Therewith she raised one solid leg, and spread the naked foot\nthereof, while her lips were as firm as any toe of all the lot,\nagainst the vile thing that had knocked her about, and the power that\nwas contradicting her. Nothing could withstand this fixed resolution\nof one of the far more resolute moiety of humanity. With a creak of\nsurrender, the gate gave back; and out came little Peggy Cripps, with\na broad face glowing with triumph, which suddenly fell into a length\nof terror, as the vindictive gate closed behind her. To get out had\nbeen a great labour, but to get back was an impossibility; and\nHardenow, even so far away, could interpret the gesture of despair and\nhorror. \"Poor little thing! How I wish that I could help her!\" he said\nto himself, and very soon began to think that mutual aid might with\nproper skill be compassed.\n\nWith this good idea, he renewed his shouts, but offered them in a more\ninsinuating form; and being now assured that the child was female, his\ncapacious mind framed a brief appeal to the very first instinct of all\nfemale life. Possibly therefore the fairer half of pig and daw\ncreation appropriated with pleasure his address. At any rate, although\nthe child began to look around, she had no idea whence came the words,\n\"Pretty little dear! little beauty!\" etc., with which the learned\nprisoner was endeavouring to allure her.\n\nBut at last, by a very great effort and with pain, Hardenow managed to\nextract from the nets his white cravat, or rather his cravat which had\nbeen white, when it first hung down his back from the taloned clasp of\nthe hollies. By much contrivance and ingenious rollings, he brought\nout a pretty good wisp of white, and hoisted it bravely betwixt gyved\nfeet, and at the little breach displayed it. And the soft breath of\nMay, which was wandering about, came and uncrinkled, and in little\ntatters waved the universal symbol of Succession Apostolical, as well\nas dinner-parties.\n\nLittle Peggy happened at this moment to be staring, with a loose\nuncertain glimpse of thought that somebody somewhere was calling her.\nBy the flutter of the white cravat, her wandering eyes were caught at\nlast, and fixed for a minute of deliberate growth of wonder. Not a\nstep towards that dreadful white ghost would she budge; but a\nsteadfast idea was implanted in her mind, and was likely to come up\nvery slowly.\n\n\"It is waste of time; I have lost half an hour. The poor little\nthing--I have only scared her. Now let me think what I ought to do\nnext.\"\n\nBut even while he addressed himself to that very difficult problem,\nHardenow began to feel that he could not grapple with it. His mind was\nas clear as ever, but his bodily strength was failing. He had often\nfasted for a longer time, but never with his body invested thus, and\nall his members straitened. The little girl sank from his weary eyes,\nthough he longed to know what would become of her; and he scarcely had\nany perception at all of pigs that were going on after their manner,\nand rabbits quite ready for their early dinner, the moment the sun\nbegan to slope, and a fine cock partridge, who in his way was proud\nbecause his wife had now laid a baker's dozen of eggs, and but for his\ndissuasion would begin to sit to-morrow; and after that a round-nosed\nhare, with a philoprogenitive forehead, but no clear idea yet of\nleverets; and after that, as the shadows grew long, a cart, drawn by a\nhorse, as carts seem always to demand that they shall be--the horse of\na strong and incisive stamp (to use the two pet words of the day), the\ncart not so very far behind him there, as they gave word to stop at\nthe gate to one another--and in the cart, and above the cart, and\ndriving both it and the horse thereof, as Abraham drove on the plain\nof Mamre, Zacchary Cripps; and sitting at his side, the far-travelled\nand accomplished Esther.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\nFEMININE ERROR.\n\n\nMeanwhile, at Cross Duck House, ever since that interview of the\nmorning, things were becoming, from hour to hour, more critical and\nthreatening. If Mr. Sharp could only have believed that his son was\nnow a man, or at least should be treated as though he were; and if\nafter that the too active lawyer could only have conceived it possible\nthat some things might go on all the better without him; it is likely\nenough that his righteous and gallant devices would have sped more\neasily.\n\nBut Luke Sharp had governed his own little world so long that he\nscarcely could imagine serious rebellion. And he cared not to hide his\nlarge contempt for the intellect of Christopher, or the grievance\nwhich he had always felt--at being the father of a donkey. And so,\nwithout further probation or pledge, he went forth to make his own\narrangements, leaving young Kit to his mother's charge, like a dummy,\nto be stroked down and dressed.\n\nIf he had left Kit but an hour before for his mother to tell him\neverything, and round the corners, and smooth the levels, and wrap it\nall up in delicious romance, as women do so easily, with their power\nof believing whatever they wish, the boy might have jumped at the soft\nsweet bait; for he verily loved his sylvan maid. But now all his\nvirtue and courage, and even temper, were on the outlook; and only one\nthing more was needed to drive him to a desperate resolve.\n\nAnd that one thing was supplied, in the purest innocence, by Mrs.\nSharp; though the question would never have arisen if her son had been\nleft to her sole handling.\n\n\"Then, mother, I suppose,\" said Kit as simply as if he smelled no rat\nwhatever, thoroughly as he understood that race, \"if I should be\nfortunate enough to marry beautiful Miss Oglander, we shall have to\nlive on bread and cheese, until it shall please the senior people to\nbe reconciled, and help us?\"\n\n\"No, Kit! What are you talking of, child? The lady has \u00c2\u00a320,000 of her\nown! And \u00c2\u00a3150,000 to follow, which nobody can take from her!\"\n\nWith a very heavy heart he turned away. Nothing more was required to\nsettle him. He saw the whole business of the plotting now; and the\nyoung romance was out of it. He went to the bow-window looking on the\nlane, and felt himself akin to a little ragamuffin, who was cheating\nall the other boys at marbles. Hard bitterness and keen misery were\nbattling in his mind which should be the first to have its way and\nspeak.\n\n\"This comes of being a lawyer's son!\" he cried, turning round for one\nbad glance at his mother. \"She said that she disliked the law. I don't\ndislike, I abhor it.\"\n\n\"So you may, my dear boy, and welcome now. This will lift you\naltogether beyond it. Your dear father may consider it his duty to\ncontinue the office, and so on; but you will be a country gentleman,\nKit, with horses, and dogs, and Manton guns, and a pack of hounds, and\na long barouche, and hot-house grapes. And I will come and live with\nyou, my darling; or at least make our country house of it, and show\nyou how to manage things. For the whole world will be trying to cheat\nyou, Kit; you are too good-natured, and grand in your ways! You must\ntry to be a little sharper, darling, with that mint of money.\"\n\n\"Must I? But suppose that I won't have it.\"\n\n\"Sometimes I believe that you think it manly to provoke your mother.\nThe money ought to have been ours, Kit; mine by heritage and justice;\nat least a year and a half ago. A moderate provision should have been\nmade for a woman, who may have her good points--though everybody has\nfailed to discover them--and who married with a view to jointure. Ten\nthousand pounds would have been very handsome--far handsomer than she\never was, poor thing!--and then by every law, human and divine, all\nthe rest must have come to you and me, my dear. Now, I hope that you\nsee things in their proper light.\"\n\n\"Well, I dare say I do,\" he answered, with a little turn of sulkiness,\nsuch as he often got when people could not understand him. \"Mother,\nyou will allow me to have my own opinion; as you have yours.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Kit! Of course, my dear. You know that you always have\nbeen allowed extraordinary liberty in that way. No boy in any school\ncould have more; even where all the noblemen's sons are allowed to\nmake apple-pie beds for the masters. Every night, my dear boy, when\nyour father was away, it has rested with you, and you cannot deny it,\nto settle to a nicety what there must be for supper.\"\n\n\"Such trumpery stuff is not worth a thought. I am now like a fellow\ndivided in two. You might guess what I am about, a little. It is high\ntime for me to come forward. You cannot see things, perhaps, as I do.\nHow often must I tell you? I give you my word as a gentleman--all this\nis exceedingly trying.\"\n\n\"Of course it is, Kit; of course it is. What else could be expected of\nit? But still, we must all of us go through trials; and then we come\nout purified.\"\n\n\"Not if we made them for ourselves, mother; and made them particularly\ndirty ones. But I cannot talk of it; what do I know? A lot of things\ncome tempting me. Everybody laughs at me for wondering what my mind\nis. And everybody cheats me, as you said. Let the governor carry on\nhis own devices. I have made up my mind to consider a good deal, and\nbehave then according to circumstances.\"\n\n\"You will behave, I trust, exactly as your parents wish. They have\nseen so much more of the world than you have; they are far better\njudges of right and wrong; and their only desire is your highest\ninterest. You will break your poor mother's heart, dear Kit, if you do\nanything foolish now.\"\n\nThe latter argument had much more weight with young Sharp than the\nformer; but pledging himself as yet to nothing, he ran away to his own\nroom to think; while his mother, with serious misgivings, went down to\nsee about the soup, and hurry on the dinner. She knew that in vaunting\nMiss Oglander's wealth she had done the very thing she was ordered not\nto do, and she was frightened at the way in which her son had taken\nit.\n\nMr. Sharp did not come home to their early dinner at half-past one\no'clock; indeed, his wife did not expect him much; and his son was\ndelighted not to see him. Kit sat heavily, but took his food as usual.\nThe condition of his mind might be very sad indeed, but his body was\nnot to be driven thereby to neglect the duties of its own department.\nHe helped his dear mother to some loin of mutton; and when she only\nplayed with it, and her knife and fork were trembling, he was angered,\nand his eyes sought hers; and she tried to look at him and smile, but\nmade a wretched job of it. Christopher reserved his opinion about\nthis; but it did not help in any way to impair his resolution.\n\nFor dessert they had a little dish of strawberries from pot-plants in\nthe greenhouse; and as they were the first of the season, the young\nfellow took to them rather greedily. His mother was charmed with this\ncondescension, and urged him so well that in about three minutes the\nshining red globes ticked with gold were represented by a small,\nignoble pile of frilled stalks blurred with pink. At this moment in\nwalked the master of the house.\n\nHe had been as fully occupied as a certain unobtrusive, but never\ninactive, gentleman, proverbially must be in a gale of wind. The day\nwas unusually warm for the May month, and the streets of Oxford dusty.\nMr. Sharp had been working a roundabout course, and working it very\nrapidly; he had managed to snatch at a sandwich or two--for he could\nnot go long without nourishment--but throughout all his haste he had\ngiven himself, with the brightest vision of refreshing joy, just time\nto catch these strawberries. At least he was sure of it. But now,\nwhere were they?\n\n\"Ah, I see you know how to snap up a good thing!\" cried the lawyer,\nwith a glance of contempt and wrath; \"show the same promptitude in\nwhat has been arranged for your benefit this afternoon, my boy; and\nthen you will be, in earnest, what you put on your dogs' collars.\"\n\nThis was not the way to treat Kit Sharp; but the lawyer never could\nresist a sneer, even when his temper was at its best, which it\ncertainly was not just now.\n\nKit looked a little ashamed for a moment, but made no excuse for his\ngreediness; he was sure that his mother would do that best. By this\ntime he had resolved to avoid, for the present, all further dispute\nwith his father. Whatever was arranged for him he would do his best to\naccept, with one condition--that he should be allowed to see the young\nlady first, and test her good-will towards him, before her \"removal\"\n(as Mr. Sharp mildly called it) was attempted. His sanguine young\nheart had long been doing its utmost to convince him that this\nsweet-tempered and simple maid could never bring herself to the\nterrible cruelty of rejecting him. He felt how unworthy he was; but\nstill so was everybody else--especially the villain with the four bay\nhorses: from that scoundrel he would save her, even if he had to\ndissemble more than he ever had done before.\n\nLuke Sharp, with his eyes fixed on his son in lofty contemplation,\nbeheld (as through a grand microscope) these despicable little\nreasonings. To argue with Kit was more foolish than filing a\ndeclaration against a man of straw. To suppose that Kit would ever\nreally rebel was more absurd than to imagine that a case would be\ndecided upon its merits. \"So be it,\" he said; \"but of course, even you\nwould never be quite such a fool as to tell her what your father and\nmother have done for her good.\"\n\nThere still was a little to be done, and some nicety of combination to\nsee to; and after a short consultation with his wife, and particular\ninstructions as to management of Kit, Mr. Sharp rode off on his own\nstout horse, with a heavily loaded whip and a brace of pistols,\nbecause there were some rogues about.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\nUNFILIAL.\n\n\n\"At seven o'clock all must be ready,\" said Mr. Sharp, towards the\nclose of a hurried conversation with Miss Patch, Grace Oglander being\nsent out of the way, according to established signal; \"there is no\ntime to lose, and no ladies' tricks of unpunctuality, if you please.\nWe must have day-light for these horrid forest-roads, and time it so\nas to get into the London road about half-past eight. We must be in\nLondon by two in the morning; the horses, and all that will be\nforthcoming. Kit rides outside, and I follow on horse-back. Hannah,\nwhy do you hesitate?\"\n\n\"Because I cannot--I cannot go away, without having seen that Jesuit\npriest in the pig-net wallowing. It is such a grand providential\nwork--the arm of the Lord has descended from heaven, and bound him in\nhis own meshes. Luke, I beg you, I implore you--I can pack up\neverything in an hour--do not rob me of a sight like that.\"\n\n\"Hannah, are you mad? You have never been allowed to go near that\nplace, and you never shall!\"\n\n\"Well, you know best; but it does seem very cruel, after all the lack\nof grace I have borne with here, to miss the great Protestant work\nthus accomplished. But suppose that the child should refuse to come\nwith us--we have no letters now, nor any other ministration.\"\n\n\"We have no time now for such trumpery; we must carry things now with\na much higher hand. Everything hangs upon the next few hours; and by\nthis time to-morrow night all shall be safe: Kit and the girl gone for\ntheir honeymoon, and you sitting under the most furious dustman that\never thumped a cushion.\"\n\n\"Oh, Luke, how can you speak as if you really had no reverence?\"\n\n\"Because there is no time for such stuff now. We have the strength,\nand we must use it. Just go and get ready. I must ride to meet my\npeople. The girl, I suppose, is with Kit by this time. What a pair of\nnincompoops they will be!\"\n\n\"I am sure they will be a very pretty pair--so far as poor sinful\nexterior goes--and, what is of a thousand-fold more importance, their\nworldly means will be the means of grace to hundreds of our poor\nfellow-creatures, who, because their skin is of a different tint, and\nin their own opinion a finer one, are debarred----\"\n\n\"Now, Hannah, no time for that. Get ready. And mind that there must be\nno feminine weakness if circumstances should compel us to employ a\nlittle compulsion. Call to your mind that the Lord is with us; the\nsword of the Lord and of Gideon.\"\n\nPleased with his knowledge of Holy Writ, he went to the place where\nhis horse was tied, and there he found a man with a message for him,\nwhich he just stopped to hearken.\n\n\"As loovin' as a pair o' toortle doves; he hath a-got her by the\nmiddle; as sweet as my missus were to me, afore us went to church\ntogither!\" Black George had been set to watch Kit and Gracie, during\ntheir private interview, lest any precaution should be overlooked.\n\n\"Right! Here's a guinea for you, my man. Now, you know what to do till\nI come back--to stay where you are, and keep a sharp look-out. Can the\nfool in the net do without any water? Very well, after dark, give him\nsome food, bandage his eyes, and walk him to and fro, and let him go\nin Banbury.\n\n\"All right, governor. A rare bait he shall have of it, with a little\nswim in the canal, to clane un.\"\n\n\"No hardship, no cruelty!\" cried Mr. Sharp, with his finger to his\nforehead, as he rode away; \"only a little wise discipline to lead him\ninto closer attention to his own affairs.\"\n\nBlack George looked after his master with a grin of admiration. \"He\nsticketh at nort,\" said George to himself, as he began to fill a grimy\npipe; \"he sticketh at nort no more than I would. And with all that\nhouse and lands to back un! Most folk with money got no pluck left,\nfor thinking of others as owneth the same. I'll be danged if he\ndothn't carry on as bold as if he slep' in a rabbit-hole.\" With these\nwords he sat down to watch the house, according to his orders.\n\nBut this man's description of what he had seen in the wood was not a\ncorrect one--much as he meant to speak the truth--for many reasons,\nand most of all this: that he ran away before the end of it. It was a\npretty and a moving scene; but the rabbit-man cared a great deal more\nfor the pipe, which he could not smoke in this duty, and the guinea\nwhich he hoped to get out of it. And it happened, as near as one can\ntell, on this wise:\n\nGrace Oglander, came down the winding wooded path, with her heart\npit-a-patting at every step, because she was ordered to meet somebody.\nAn idea of that kind did not please her. A prude, or a prim, she would\nnever wish to be; and a little bit of flirting had been a great\nrelief, and a pleasant change in her loneliness. But to bring matters\nto so stern a point, and have to say what she meant to say, in as few\nwords as possible, and then walk off--these strong measures were not\nto her liking, because she was a most kind-hearted girl, and had much\ngood-will towards Christopher.\n\nKit on the other hand, came along fast, with a resolute brow and firm\nheavy stride. He had made up his mind to be wretched for life, if the\nheart upon which he had set his own should refuse to throb\nresponsively. But whatever his fate might be, he would tread the\nhighest path of generosity, chivalry, and honour; and this resolution\nwas well set forth in the following nervous and pathetic lines, found\nin his blotting-paper after his untimely--but stay, let us not\nanticipate. These words had been watered with a flood of tears.\n\n    \"C. F. S. TO MISS G. O.\n\n    Say that happier mortal woos thee,\n    Say that nobler knight pursues thee,\n      While this blighted being teareth\n      All the festive robes it weareth,\n    While this dead heart splits to lose thee--\n    Ah, could I so misuse thee?\n      Though this bosom, rent by thunder,\n    Crash its last hope anchor'd in thee;\n      Liefer would I groan thereunder,\n    Than by falsehood win thee!\"\n\nAnd now they met in a gentle place, roofed with leaves, and floored\nwith moss, and decorated with bluebells. The chill of the earth was\ngone by and forgotten, and the power of the sky come back again;\nstately tree, and graceful bush, and brown depths of tangled\nprickliness--everything having green life in it--was spreading its\ngreen, and proud of it. Under this roof, and in these halls of bright\nyoung verdure, the youth and the maid came face to face befittingly.\nGrace, as bright as a rose, and flushing with true tint of wild rose,\ndrew back and bowed, and then, perceiving serious hurt of Christopher,\nkindly offered a warm white hand--a delicious touch for any one. Kit\nlaid hold of this and kept it, though with constant fear of doing more\nthan was established, and, trying to look firm and overpowering, led\nthe fair young woman to a trunk of fallen oak.\n\nHere they both sat down; and Grace was not so far as she could wish\nfrom yielding to a little kind of trembling which arose in her. She\nglanced at Kit sideways whenever she felt that he could not be looking\nat her; and she kept her wise eyes mainly downward whenever they\nseemed to be wanted--not that she could not look up and speak, only\nthat she would rather wait until there was no other help for it; and\nas for that, she felt no fear, being sure that he was afraid of her.\nKit, on the other hand, was full of fear, and did all he could in the\ncraftiest manner to make his love look up at him. He could not tell\nhow she might take his tale; but he knew by instinct that his eyes\nwould help him where his tongue might fail. At last he said--\n\n\"Now, will you promise faithfully not to be angry with me?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, oh yes--to be sure,\" said Grace; \"why should I be angry?\"\n\n\"Because I can't help it--I give you my honour. I have tried very\nhard, but I cannot help it.\"\n\n\"Then who could be angry with you, unless it was something very\nwicked?\"\n\n\"It is not very wicked, it is very good--too good for me, a great\ndeal, I am afraid.\"\n\n\"There cannot be many things too good for you; you are simple, and\nbrave, and gentle.\"\n\n\"But this is too good for me, ever so much, because it is your own\ndear self.\"\n\nGrace was afraid that this was coming; and now she lifted her soft\nblue eyes and looked at him quite tenderly, and yet so directly and\nclearly that he knew in a moment what she had for him--pity, and\ntrust, and liking; but of heart's love not one atom.\n\n\"I know what you mean,\" he whispered sadly, with his bright young face\ncast down. \"I cannot think what can have made me such a fool. Only\nplease to tell me one thing. Has there been any chap in front of me?\"\n\n\"How can I tell what you mean?\" asked Grace; but her colour showed\nthat she could guess.\n\n\"I must not ask who it is, of course. Only say it's not the swell that\ndrives the four bay horses.\"\n\n\"I do not know any one that drives four bay horses. And now I think\nthat I had better go. Only, as I cannot ever meet you any more, I must\ntry to tell you that I like you very much, and never shall forget what\nI owe to you; and I hope you will very soon recover from this--this\nlittle disappointment; and my dear father, as soon as we return to\nEngland--for I must go to fetch him----\"\n\n\"Grace--oh, let me call you 'Grace' once or twice, it can't matter\nhere in the middle of the wood--Grace, I was so taken up with myself,\nand full of my miserable folly, which of course I ought to have known\nbetter----\"\n\n\"I must not stop to hear any more. There is my hand--yes, of course\nyou may kiss it, after all that you have done for me.\"\n\n\"I am going to do a great deal more for you,\" cried Kit, quite carried\naway with the yielding kindness of lovely fingers. \"For your sake I am\ngoing to injure and disgrace my own father--though the Lord knows the\nshame is of his own making. It is my father who has kept you here; and\nto-night he is going to carry you off. Miss Patch is only a tool of\nhis. Your own father knows not a word about it. He believes you to be\ndead and buried. Your tombstone is set up at Beckley, and your father\ngoes and cries over it.\"\n\n\"But his letters--his letters from Demerara? Oh! my head swims round!\nLet me hold by this tree for a moment!\"\n\nKit threw his arm round her delicate waist to save her from falling;\nand away crept George, who had lurked behind a young birch-tree too\nfar off to hear their words.\n\n\"You must rouse up your courage,\" said Kit, with a yearning gaze at\nhis sweet burden, yet taking no advantage of her. \"Rouse up your\ncourage, and I will do my best to save you from myself. It is very\nhard--it is cruelly cruel, and nobody will thank me!\"\n\n\"His letters from Demerara!\" cried Grace, having scarcely heard a word\nhe said. \"How could he have written them? You must be wrong.\"\n\n\"Of such letters I have never heard. I suppose they must have been\nforgeries. I give you my word that your father has been the whole of\nthe time at Beckley, and a great deal too ill to go from home.\"\n\n\"Too ill!--my father? Yes, of course--of course! How could he help\nbeing ill without me? And he thinks I am dead? Oh! he thinks that I am\ndead! I wonder that he could dare to be alive. But let me try to think\na little.\"\n\nShe tottered back to the old stump of the tree, and sat down there,\nand burst forth into an extraordinary gush of weeping: more sad and\npitiful tears had never watered an innocent face before. \"Let me\ncry!--let me cry!\" was her only answer when the young man clumsily\ntried to comfort.\n\nKit got up and strode about; his indignation at her deep low sobs, and\nher brilliant cheeks like a river's bed, and her rich hair dabbled\nlike drifted corn, and above all the violent pain which made her lay\nboth hands to her heart and squeeze--his wrath made him long to knock\ndown people entitled to his love and reverence. He knew that her heart\nwas quite full of her father in all his long desolation, and was\nmaking a row of pictures of him in deepening tribulation; but a girl\nmight go on like that for ever; a man must take the lead of her.\n\n\"If you please, Miss Oglander,\" he said, going up and lifting both her\nhands, and making her look up at him, \"you have scarcely five minutes\nto make up your mind whether you wish to save your father, or to be\ncarried away from him.\"\n\nGrace in confusion and fear looked up. All about herself she had\nforgotten; she had even forgotten that Kit was near; she was only\npondering slowly now--as the mind at most critical moments does--some\nstraw of a trifle that blew across.\n\n\"Do you care to save your father's life?\" asked Kit, rather sternly,\nnot seeing in the least the condition of her mind, but wondering at\nit. \"If you do, you must come with me, this moment, down the hill,\ndown the hill, as fast as ever you can. I know a place where they can\nnever find us. We must hide there till dark, and then I will take you\nto Beckley.\"\n\nBut the young lady's nerves would not act at command. The shock and\nsurprise had been too severe. All she could do was to gaze at Kit,\nwith soft imploring eyes, that tried to beg pardon for her\nhelplessness.\n\n\"If we stay here another minute, you are lost!\" cried Kit, as he heard\nthe sound of the carriage-wheels near the cottage, on the rise above\nthem. \"One question only--will you trust me?\"\n\nShe moved her pale lips to say \"yes,\" and faintly lifted one hand to\nhim. Kit waited for no other sign, but caught her in his sturdy arms,\nand bore her down the hill as fast as he could go, without scratching\nher snow-white face, or tearing the arm which hung on his shoulder.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LII.\n\nUNPATERNAL.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Sharp had his forces ready, and was waiting for Grace\nand Christopher. Cinnaminta's good Uncle Kershoe (who spent half of\nhis useful time in stealing horses, and the other half in disguising\nand disposing of them), although he might not have desired to show\nhimself so long before the moonlight, yet, true to honour, here he\nwas, blinking beneath a three-cornered hat, like a grandly respectable\ncoachman. The carriage was drawn up in a shady place, quite out of\nsight from the windows; and the horses, having very rare experience of\noats, were embracing a fine opportunity. In picturesque attitudes of\ntobacconizing--if the depth of the wood covers barbarism--three fine\nfellows might now be seen; to wit, Black George, Joe Smith, and that\nsubstantial householder, Tickuss Cripps. In the chaise sat a lady of\ncomfortable aspect, though fidgeting now with fat, well-gloved hands.\nMrs. Sharp had begged not to have to stop at home and wonder what\nmight be doing with her own Kit: and the case being now one of \"neck\nor nothing,\" her husband had let her come, foreseeing that she might\nbe of use with Grace Oglander. For the moment, however, she looked\nmore likely to need attendance for herself; for she kept glancing\nround towards the cottage-door, while her plump and still comely\ncheeks were twitching, and tears of deep thought about the merits of\nher son held her heart in quick readiness to be up and help them. Once\nMr. Sharp, whose main good point, among several others, was affection\nfor his wife, rode up, and in a playful manner tickled her nose with\nthe buckskin loop of his loaded whip, and laughed at her. She felt how\nkind it was of him, but her smile was only feeble.\n\n\"Now mind, dear,\" said Mr. Sharp, reining his horse (as strong as an\noak and as bright as a daisy), \"feel no anxiety about me. You have\nplenty of nourishment in your three bags; keep them all alive with it.\nEverything is mapped out perfectly. Near Wycombe, without rousing any\nlandlord, you have a fresh pair of horses. In a desert place called\nthe 'New Road,' in London, I meet you and take charge of you.\"\n\n\"May Kit have his pipe on the box? I am sure it will make him go so\nmuch sweeter.\"\n\n\"Fifty, if he likes. You put his sealskin pouch in. You think of every\none before yourself.\"\n\n\"But can I get on with that dreadful woman? Don't you think she will\npreach me to death, Luke?\"\n\n\"Miranda, my dear, you are talking loosely. You forget the great gift\nthat you possess--the noblest endowment of the nobler sex. You can\nsleep whenever you like, and do it without even a suspicion of a\nsnore. It is the very finest form of listening. Good-bye! You will be\na most happy party. When once I see you packed, I shall spur on in\nfront.\"\n\nMr. Sharp kissed his hand, and rode back to the cottage. Right well he\nknew what a time ladies take to put their clothes upon them; and the\nmore grow the years of their practice in the art, the longer grow the\nhours needful. Still he thought Miss Patch had been quite long enough.\nBut what could he say, when he saw her at her window, with the\nlooking-glass sternly set back upon the drawers, lifting her hands in\nshort prayer to the Lord: as genuine a prayer as was ever tried. She\nwas praying for a blessing on this new adventure, and that all might\nlead up to the glory of the Kingdom; she besought to be relieved at\nlast from her wearying instrumentality. Mr. Sharp still had some\nlittle faith left--for he was a man of much good feeling--and he did\nnot scoff at his sister's prayer, as a man of low nature might have\ndone.\n\nNevertheless he struck up with his whip at the ivy round her bedroom\nwindow, to impress the need of brevity; and the lady, though shocked\nat the suggestion of curtailment, did curtail immediately. In less\nthan five minutes, she was busy at the doorway, seeing to the exit of\neverything; and presently, with very pious precision, she gave Mrs.\nMargery Daw half a crown, and a tract which some friend should read to\nher, after rubbing her glands with a rind of bacon, and a worn-out\npocket-handkerchief, which had belonged to the mighty Rowland Hill,\nwhose voice went three miles and a half.\n\nThen Miss Patch (with her dress tucked up, and her spectacles at their\nbrightest) marched, with a copy of the Scriptures borne prominently\nforward, and the tags of her cloak doubled up on her arm, towards the\ncarriage, where Grace must be waiting for her. The sloping of the\nsunset threw her shadow, and the ring-doves in the wood were cooing.\nThe peace and the beauty touched even her heart; and the hushing of\nthe winds of evening in the nestling of the wood appeased the ruffled\nmind to that simplicity of childhood, where God and good are one.\n\nBut just as she was shaking hands benevolently with Mrs. Sharp, before\ngetting into the carriage, back rode Mr. Sharp at full gallop, and\nwithout any ceremony shouted, \"Where's the girl?\"\n\n\"Miss Oglander! Why, I thought she was here!\" Hannah Patch answered,\nwith a little gasp.\n\n\"And I thought she was coming with you,\" cried Mrs. Sharp; \"as well as\nmy dear boy, Christopher.\"\n\n\"I let her go to meet him as you arranged,\" Miss Patch exclaimed\ndecisively; \"I had nothing to do with her after that.\"\n\n\"Is it possible that the boy has rogued me?\" As Mr. Sharp said these\nfew words, his face took a colour never seen before, even by his\nloving wife: The colour was, a livid purple, and it made his sparkling\neyes look pale.\n\n\"They must be at the cottage,\" Mrs. Sharp suggested; \"let me go to\nlook for the naughty young couple.\"\n\nThe lawyer had his reasons for preventing this, as well as for keeping\nhimself where he was; and therefore at a sign from him, Miss Patch\nturned back, and set off with all haste for the cottage. No sooner had\nshe turned the corner, than Joe Smith, the tall gipsy, emerged from\nthe wood with long strides into the road, and beckoned to Mr. Sharp\nurgently. The lawyer was with him in a moment, and almost struck him\nin his fury at what he heard.\n\n\"How could you allow it? You great tinkering fool! Run to the corner\nwhere the two lanes meet. Take George with you. I will ride straight\ndown the road. No, stop, cut the traces of those two horses! You jump\non one, and Black George on the other, and off for the Corner full\ngallop! You ought to be there before the cart. I will ride straight\nfor that rotten old jolter! Zounds, is one man to beat five of us?\"\nWaiting for no answer, he struck spurs into his horse, and, stooping\nover the withers, dashed into a tangled alley, which seemed to lead\ntowards the timber-track.\n\nNo wonder Mr. Sharp was in such a rage, for what had happened was\nexactly this--only much of it happened with more speed than words:--\n\nCripps, the Carrier, had been put up by several friends and relations\n(especially Numbers, the butcher, who missed the pork trade of\nLeviticus) to bring things directly to a point, instead of letting\nthem go on, in a way which was neither one thing nor the other.\nConfessing all the claims of duty, poor Zacchary only asked how he\ncould discharge them. He had done his very best, and he had found out\nnothing. If any one could tell him what more to do, he would wear out\nhis Sunday shoes to thank them.\n\n\"Brother Zak,\" said Mrs. Numbers, with a feeling which in a less loyal\nfamily would have been contempt, \"have you set a woman to work; now,\nhave you?\"\n\nEvery Cripps present was struck with this, and most of all the\nCarrier. Mrs. Numbers herself was quite ready to go, but a feud had\narisen betwixt her and Susannah, as to whether three-holed or\nfour-holed buttons cut the cotton faster; and therefore the Carrier\nresolved to take his own sister Etty, who never quarrelled. It was\nfound out that she required change of air, and, indeed, she had been\nrather delicate ever since her long sad task at Shotover. Now,\nLeviticus durst not refuse to receive her, much as he disliked the\nplan. The girl went without any idea of playing spy; all she knew was\nthat her brother was suspected of falling into low company, and she\nwas to put him on his mettle, if she could.\n\nHence it was that Hardenow, gazing betwixt the two feather-edged\nboards, beheld--just before he lost his wits--the honoured vehicle of\nCripps, with empty washing baskets standing, on its welcome homeward\nroad, to discharge the fair Etty at her brother's gate. Tickuss was\naway upon Mr. Sharp's business, and Zacchary, through a grand sense of\nhonour, would not take advantage of the chance by going in. Craft and\nwickedness might be in full play with them, but a wife should on no\naccount be taken unawares, and tempted to speak outside her duty.\n\nTherefore the Carrier kissed his sister in the soft gleam of the\nsunset-clouds, and refusing so much as a glass of ale, touched up\nDobbin with a tickle of the whip; and that excellent nag (after\nlooking round for oats in a dream, which his common sense premised to\nbe too sanguine) brushed all his latter elegances with his tail, and\nfetching round his blinkers a most sad adieu to Esther, gave a little\ngrunt at fortune and resignedly set off. Alas, when he grunted at a\nlight day's work, how little did he guess what unparalleled exertions\nparted him yet from his stable for the night!\n\nFor while Master Cripps, with an equable mind, was jogging it gently\non the silent way, and (thinking how lonely his cottage would be\nwithout Esther) was balancing in his mind the respective charms of his\nthree admirers, Mary Hookham, Mealy Hiss, and Sally Brown of the\nGolden Cross, and sadly concluding that he must make up his mind to\none of the three ere long--suddenly he beheld a thing which frightened\nhim more than a dozen wives.\n\nCripps was come to a turn of the track--for it scarcely could be\ncalled a road--and was sadly singing to Dobbin and himself that\nexquisite elegiac--\n\n    \"Needles and pins, needles and pins,\n    When a man marries, his trouble begins!\"\n\nDobbin also, though he never had been married, was trying to keep time\nto this tune, as he always did to sound sentiments; when the two of\nthem saw a sight that came, like a stroke for profanity, over them.\n\nDirectly in front of them, from a thick bush, sprang a beautiful girl\ninto the middle of the lane, and spread out her hand to stop them. If\nthe evening light had been a little paler, or even the moon had been\nbehind her, a ghost she must have been then, and for ever. Cripps\nstared as if he would have no eyes any more; but Dobbin had received a\ngreat many comforts from the little hands spread out to him; and he\nstopped and sniffed, and lifted up his nose (now growing more\ndecidedly aquiline) that it might be stroked, and even possibly\nregaled with a bunch of white-blossomed clover.\n\n\"Oh, Cripps, good Cripps, you dear old Cripps!\" Grace Oglander cried\nwith great tears in her eyes, \"you never have forgotten me, Zacchary\nCripps? They say that I am dead and buried. It isn't true, not a word\nof it! Dear Cripps, I am as sound alive as you are. Only I have been\nshamefully treated! Do let me get up in your cart, good Cripps, and my\nfather will thank you for ever!\"\n\n\"But, Missy, poor Missy,\" Cripps stammered out, drawing on his heart\nfor every word, \"you was buried on the seventh day of January, in the\nyear of our Lord, 1838; three pickaxes was broken over digging of your\ngrave, by reason of the frosty weather; and all of us come to your\nfuneral! Do 'ee go back, miss, that's a dear! The churchyard to\nBeckley is a comfortable place, and this here wood no place for a\nChristian.\"\n\n\"But, Cripps, dear Cripps, do try to let me speak! They might have\nbroken thirty pickaxes, but I had nothing at all to do with it. May I\nget up? Oh, may I get up? It is the only chance of saving me. I hear a\nhorse tearing through the wood! Oh, dear, clever Cripps, you will\nrepent it for the rest of all your life. Even Dobbin is sharper than\nyou are.\"\n\n\"You blessed old ass!\" cried a stern young voice, as Kit Sharp (who\nhad meant not to show) rushed forward, \"there is no time for your\nheavy brain to work. You shall have the young lady, dead or alive!\nPardon me, Grace--no help for it. Now, thick-headed bumpkin, put one\narm round her, and off at full gallop with your old screw! If you give\nher up I will hang you by the neck to the tail of your broken\nrattletrap!\"\n\n\"Oh, Cripps, dear Cripps, I assure you on my honour,\" said Grace, as\ntossed up by her lover, she sat in the seat of Esther, \"I have never\nbeen dead any more than you have. I can't tell you now; oh, drive on,\ndrive, if you have a spark of manhood in you!\"\n\nA horse and horseman came out of the wood, about fifty yards behind\nthem, and Grace would have fallen headlong, but for the half-reluctant\narm of Cripps, as Dobbin with a jump (quite unknown in his very first\nassay of harness) set off full gallop over rut and rock, with a blow\non his back, from the fist of Kit, like the tumble of a chimney-pot.\n\nThen Christopher Sharp, after one sad look at Grace Oglander's flying\nfigure, turned round to confront his father.\n\n\"What means all this?\" cried the lawyer fiercely, being obliged to\nrein up his horse, unless he would trample Kit underfoot.\n\n\"It means this,\" answered his son, with firm gaze, and strong grasp of\nhis bridle, \"that you have made a great mistake, sir--that you must\ngive up your plan altogether--that the poor young lady who has been so\ndeceived----\"\n\n\"Let go my bridle, will you? Am I to stop here--to be baffled by you?\nIdiot, let go my bridle!\"\n\n\"Father, you shall not--for your own sake, you shall not! I may be an\nidiot, but I will not be a blackguard----\"\n\n\"If by the time I have counted three, your hand is on my bridle, I\nwill knock you down, and ride over you!\"\n\nTheir eyes met in furious conflict of will, the elder man's glaring\nwith the blaze of an opal, the younger one's steady with a deep brown\nglow.\n\n\"Strike me dead, if you choose!\" said Kit, as his father raised his\narm, with the loaded whip swinging, and counted, \"One, two,\nthree!\"--then the crashing blow fell on the naked temple; and it was\nnot needed twice.\n\nDashing the rowels into his horse (whose knees struck the boy in the\nchest as he fell, and hurled him among the bushes), the lawyer,\nwithout even looking round, rode madly after Zacchary. Dobbin had won\na good start by this time, and was round the corner, doing great\nwonders for his time of life--tossing the tubs, and the baskets, and\nGrace, and even the sturdy Carrier, like fritters in a pan, while the\ncart leaped and plunged, and the spokes of the wheels went round too\nfast to be counted. Cripps tugged at Dobbin with all his might; but\nfor the first time in his life, the old horse rebelled, and flung on\nat full speed.\n\n\"He knoweth best, miss; he knoweth best,\" cried Zacchary, while Grace\nclung to him; \"he hath a divination of his own, if he dothn't kick the\ncart to tatters. But never would I turn tail on a single man--who is\nyon chap riding after us?\"\n\n\"Oh, Cripps, it is that dreadful man,\" whispered Grace, with her teeth\njerking into her tongue; \"who has kept me in prison, and perhaps\nkilled my father! Oh, Dobbin, sweet Dobbin, try one more gallop, and\nyou shall have clover for ever!\"\n\nPoor Dobbin responded with his best endeavour; but, alas! his old\nfeet, and his legs, and his breath were not as in the palmy days; and\na long shambling trot, with a canter for a change, were the utmost he\ncould compass. He wagged his grey tail, in brief expostulation,\nconveying that he could go no faster.\n\n\"Now for it,\" said Cripps, as the foe overhauled them. \"I never was\nafeard of one man yet! and I don't mane to begin at this time of life.\nMissy, go down into the body of the cart. Her rideth aisily enough by\nnow; and cover thee up with the bucking-baskets. Cripps will take thee\nto thy father, little un. Never fear, my deary!\"\n\nShe obeyed him by jumping back into the cart--but as for hiding in a\nbasket, Grace had a little too much of her father's spirit. The\nweather was so fine that no tilt was on; she sat on the rail there,\nand faced her bitter foe.\n\n\"That child is my ward!\" shouted Mr. Sharp, riding up to the side of\nCripps; while his eyes passed on from Grace's; \"give her up to me this\nmoment, fellow! I can take her by law of the land; and I will!\"\n\n\"Liar Sharp,\" answered Master Cripps, desiring to address him\nprofessionally, \"this here young lady belongeth to her father; and no\nman else shall have her. Any reasoning thou hast to come down with, us\nwill hearken, as we goes along; if so be that thou keepest to a civil\ntongue. But high words never bate me down one penny; and never shall\ndo so, while the Lord is with me.\"\n\n\"Hark you, Cripps,\" replied Mr. Sharp, putting his lips to the\nCarrier's ear; and whispering so that Grace could only guess at\nenormous sums of money (which sums began doubling at every\nbreath)--\"down on the nail, and no man the wiser!\"\n\n\"But the devil a great deal the wiser,\" said the Carrier, grinning\ngently, as if he saw the power of evil fleeing away in discomfiture.\n\"Now Liar Sharp hath outwitted hisself. What Liar would offer such a\nsight of money for what were his own by the lai of the land?\"\n\n\"You cursed fool, will you die?\" cried Sharp, drawing and cocking a\ngreat horse-pistol; \"your blood be on your head--then yield!\"\n\nCripps, with great presence of mind, made believe for a moment to\nsurrender, till Mr. Sharp lowered his weapon, and came up to stop the\ncart, and to take out Grace. In a moment, the Carrier, with a\nwonderful stroke, learned from long whip-wielding, fetched down his\nnew lash on the eyeball of the young and ticklish horse of the lawyer.\nMad with pain and rage, the horse stood up as straight as a soldier\ndrilling, and balanced on the turn to fall back, break his spine, and\ncrush his rider. Luke Sharp in his peril slipped off, and the\ncart-wheel comfortably crunched over his left foot. His pistol-bullet\nwhizzed through a tall old tree. He stood on one foot, and swore\nhorribly.\n\n\"Gee wugg, Dobbin,\" said Cripps, in a cheerful, but not by any means\nexcited, vein; \"us needn't gallop any more now, I reckon. The Liar\nhath put his foot in it. Plaize now, Miss Grace, come and sit to front\nagain.\"\n\n\"We shall have you yet, you d----d old clod!\" Mr. Sharp in his rage\nyelled after him; \"oh, I'll pay you out for this devil's own trick!\nYou aren't come to the Corner yet.\"\n\n\"Ho, ho!\" shouted Cripps; \"Liar Sharp, my duty to you! You don't catch\nme goin' to the Corner, sir, if some of the firm be awaitin' for me\nthere.\"\n\nWith these words he gaily struck off to the right, through a by-lane,\nunknown, but just passable, where the sound of his wheels was no\nlonger heard, and the mossy boughs closed over him. Grace clung to his\narm; and glory and gladness filled the simple heart of Cripps.\n\nMeanwhile Mr. Sharp, who had stuck to his bridle, limped to his horse,\nbut could not mount. Then he drew forth the other pistol from the near\nholster, and cocked it and levelled it at Cripps; but thanks to brave\nDobbin, now the distance was too great; and he kept the charge for\nnobler use.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIII.\n\n\"THIS WILL DO.\"\n\n\nMr. Sharp's young horse, being highly fed and victualled for the long\nride to London, and having been struck in the eye unjustly, and jarred\nin the brain by the roar of a pistol and whizz of a bullet between his\npricked ears, was now in a state of mind which offered no fair field\nfor pure reasoning process. A better-disposed horse was never foaled;\nand possibly none--setting Dobbin aside, as the premier and quite\nunapproachable type--who took a clearer view of his duties to the\nprovider of corn, hay, and straw, and was more ready to face and\nundergo all proper responsibilities.\n\nTherefore he cannot be fairly blamed, and not a pound should be\ndeducted from his warrantable value, simply because he now did what\nany other young horse in the world would have felt to be right. He\nstared all around to ask what was coming next, and he tugged on the\nbridle, with his fore-feet out, as a leverage against injustice, and\nhis hind-legs spread wide apart, like a merry-thought, ready to hop\nanywhere. At the same time he stared with great terrified eyes, now at\nthe man who had involved him in these perils, and now at the darkening\nforest which might hold even worse in the background.\n\nMr. Sharp was not in the mood for coaxing, or any conciliation. His\nleft foot was crushed so that he could only hop, and to put it to the\nground was agony; his own son had turned against him; and a\ncontemptible clod had outwitted him; disgrace, and ruin, and death\nstared at him; and here was his favourite horse a rebel! He fixed his\nfierce eyes on the eyes of the horse, and fairly quelled him with\nfury. The eyes of the horse shrank back, and turned, and trembled, and\nblinked, and pleaded softly, and then absolutely fawned. Being a very\nintelligent nag, he was as sure as any sound Christian of the\npersonality of the devil--and, far worse than that, of his presence\nnow before him.\n\nHe came round whinnying to his master's side, as gentle as a lamb, and\nas abject as a hang-dog; he allowed the lame lawyer to pick up his\nwhip, and to lash him on his poor back, without a wince, and to lead\nhim (when weary of that) to a stump, from which he was able to mount\nagain.\n\n\"Thank you, you devil,\" cried Mr. Sharp, giving his good horse another\nswinging lash; \"it is hopeless altogether to ride after the cart. That\npart of the play is played out and done with. The pious papa and the\nmilk-and-water missy rush into each other's arms. And as for me--well,\nwell, I have learned to make a horse obey me. Now, sir, if you please,\nwe will join the ladies--gently, because of your master's foot.\"\n\nHe rode back quietly along the track over which he had chased the\nCarrier's cart; and his foot was now in such anguish that the whole of\nhis wonderful self-command was needed to keep him silent. He set his\nhard lips, and his rigid nose was drawn as pale as parchment, and the\nfire of his eyes died into the dulness of universal rancour. No\nhard-hearted man can find his joy in the sweet soft works of nature,\nany more than the naked flint nurses flowers. The beauty of the young\nMay twilight flowing through the woven wood, and harbouring, like a\nblue bloom, here and there, in bays of verdure; while upward all the\ngreat trees reared their domes once more in summer roofage, and\nstopped out the heavens; while in among them, finding refuge, birds\n(before the dark fell on them) filled the world with melody; and all\nthe hushing rustle of the well-earned night was settling down--through\nall of these rode Mr. Sharp, and hated every one of them.\n\nPresently his horse gave a little turn of head, but was too cowed down\nto shy again; and a tall woman, darkly clad, was standing by the\ntimber track, with one hand up to catch his eyes.\n\n\"You here, Cinnaminta!\" cried the lawyer with surprise. \"I have no\ntime now. What do you want with me?\"\n\n\"I want you to see the work of your hand--your only child, dead by\nyour own blow!\"\n\nStruck with cold horror, he could not speak. But he reeled in the\nsaddle, with his hand on his heart, and stared at Cinnaminta.\n\n\"It is true,\" she said softly; \"come here and see it. Even for you,\nLuke Sharp, I never could have wished a sight like this. You have\nruined my life; you have made my people thieves; the loss of my\nchildren lies on you. But to see your only son murdered by yourself is\ntoo bad even for such as you.\"\n\n\"I never meant it--I never dreamed it--God is my witness that I never\ndid. I thought his head was a great deal thicker.\"\n\nSneerer as he was, he meant no jest now. He simply spoke the earnest\ntruth. In his passion he had struck men before, and knocked them down,\nwith no great harm; he forgot his own fury in this one blow, and the\nweight of his heavily-loaded whip.\n\n\"If you cannot believe,\" she answered sternly, supposing him to be\njeering still, \"you had better come here. He was a kind, good lad,\ngood to me, and to my last child. I have made him look very nice. Will\nyou come? Or will you go and tell his mother?\"\n\nLuke Sharp looked at her in the same sort of way in which many of his\nvictims had looked at him. Then he touched his horse gently, having\nhad too much of rage, and allowed him to take his own choice of way.\n\nThe poor horse, having had a very bad time of it, made the most of\nthis privilege. Setting an example to mankind (whose first thought is\nnot sure to be of home) the poor fellow pointed the white star on his\nforehead towards his distant stable. Oxford was many a bad mile away,\nbut his heart was set upon being there. Sleepily therefore he jogged\nalong, having never known such a day of it.\n\nWhile he thought of his oat-sieve sweetly, and nice little nibbles at\nhis clover hay, and the comfortable soothing of his creased places by\na man who would sing a tune to him, his rider was in a very different\ncase, without one hope to turn to.\n\nThe rising of the moon to assuage the earth of all the long sun fever,\nthe spread of dewy light, and quivering of the nerves of shadow, and\nthen the soft, unfeatured beauty of the dim tranquillity, coming over\nLuke Sharp's road, or flitting on his face, what difference could they\nmake to its white despair? He hated light, he loathed the shade, he\nscorned the meekness of the dapple, and he cursed the darkness.\n\nOut of sight of the road, and yet within a level course of it, there\nlay, to his knowledge, a deep, and quiet, and seldom-troubled\nforest-pool. This had long been in his mind, and coming to the\nfootpath now, he drew his bridle towards it.\n\nThe moon was here fenced out by trees, and thickets of blackthorn, and\nivy hanging like a funeral pall. Except that here at the lip of\ndarkness, one broad beam of light stole in, and shivered on gray boles\nof willow, and quivered on black lustrous smoothness of contemptuous\nwater.\n\nTo the verge of this water Luke Sharp rode, with his horse prepared\nfor anything. He swept with his keen eyes all the length of liquid\ndarkness, ebbing into blackness in the distance. And he spoke his last\nwords--\"This will do.\"\n\nThen he drove his horse into the margin of the pool, till the water\nwas up to the girths, and the broad beams of the moon shone over them.\nHere he drew both feet from the stirrup-irons, and sat on his saddle\nsideways, sluicing his crushed and burning foot, and watching the\nwater drip from it. And then he carefully pulled from the holster the\npistol that still was loaded, took care that the flint and the priming\nwere right, and turning his horse that he might escape, while the man\nfell into deep water, steadfastly gazed at the moon, and laid the\nmuzzle to his temple, justly careful that it should be the temple, and\nthe vein which tallied with that upon which he had struck his son.\n\nA blaze lit up the forest-pool, and a roar shook the pall of ivy; a\nheavy plash added to the treasures of the deep, and a little flotilla\nof white stuff began to sail about on the black water, in the\ncommotion made by man and horse. When Mr. Sharp was an office-boy, his\nname had been \"Little Big-brains.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIV.\n\nCRIPPS BRINGS HOME THE CROWN.\n\n\nAlthough the solid Cripps might now be supposed by other people to\nhave baffled all his enemies, in his own mind there was no sense of\ntriumph, but much of wonder. The first thing he did when all danger\nwas past, and Dobbin was pedalling his old tune--\"three-happence and\ntuppence; three-happence and tuppence; a good horse knows what his\nshoes are worth\"--was to tie up Gracie in a pair of sacks. He thumped\nthem well on the foot-board first, to shake all the mealiness out of\nthem; and then, with permission, he spread one over the delicate\nshoulders, and the other in front, across the trembling heart and\nthroat. Then, by some hereditary art, he fastened them together, so\nthat the night air could not creep between.\n\n\"Cripps, you are too good,\" said Grace; \"if I could only tell you half\nthe times that I have thought of you; and once when I saw a sack of\nyours----\"\n\n\"Lor', miss, the very one as I have missed! Had un got a red cross,\nthick to one side--the Lord only knows what a fool I be, to carry on\nwith such rum-tums now; however I'll have hold of he--and zummat more,\nere I be done with it.\" Here the Carrier rubbed his mouth on his\nsleeve, as he always did to stop himself. He was not going to publish\nthe family disgrace till he had avenged it. \"But now, miss, not\nanother word you say. Inside of them sacks you go to sleep; the Lord\nknows you want it dearly; and fall away you can't nohow. Scratched you\nbe to that extreme in getting out of Satan's den, that tallow candles\ndropped in water is what I must see to. None on 'em knows it, no, not\none on 'em. Man or horse, it cometh all the same. It taketh a man to\ndo it, though.\"\n\n\"I should like to see a horse do it,\" said Grace; and her sleepy smile\npassed into sleep. Eager as she was to be in her father's arms, the\nexcitement, and the exertion, and the unwonted shaking, and passage\nthrough the air, began to tell their usual tale.\n\nThis was the very thing the crafty Carrier longed to bring about. It\nleft him time to consider how to meet two difficulties. The first was\nto get her through Beckley without any uproar of the natives; the\nsecond, to place her in her father's arms without dangerous emotion.\nThe former point he compassed well, by taking advantage of the many\nins and outs of the leisurely lanes of Beckley, so that he drew up at\nthe back door of the Barton, without a single sapient villager being\none bit the wiser.\n\nNow, if he only had his sister with him, the second point might have\nbeen better managed; because he would have sent her on in front, to\ntreat with Mrs. Hookham, and employ all the feminine skill supplied by\nquickness, sympathy, and invention. As it was, he must do the best he\ncould; and his greatest difficulty was with Grace herself.\n\nThe young lady by this time was wide awake, and stirred with such\nviolent throbbings of heart, at the view of divine and desirable\nBeckley sleeping in the moonlight, and at the breath of her own\nhome-door, and haunt of her darling father's steps, that Cripps had to\nhold her down by her sacks, and wished that he could strap her so. \"Do\n'ee zit still, miss; do 'ee zit still,\" he kept on saying, till he was\nafraid of being rude.\n\n\"You are a tyrant, Cripps; a perfect tyrant! Because you have picked\nme up, and been so good, have you any right to keep me from my\nfather?\"\n\n\"Them rasonings,\" said Cripps in a decided tone, \"is good; but comes\nto nothing. Either you do as I begs of you, missy, or I turns Dobbin's\nhead, and back you go. It is for the Squire's sake I spake so harsh to\n'ee. Supposin' you was to kill him, missy, what would you say\narterwards?\"\n\n\"Oh, is he so dreadfully ill as that? I will do everything exactly as\nyou tell me.\"\n\n\"Then get down very softly, miss, and run and hide in that old\ndoorway, quite out of the moonshine, and stay there till I come to\nfetch 'ee.\"\n\nStill covered with the sacks, the maiden did as she was told; while\nthe Carrier, with ungainly skill, and needless cautions to his horse\n(who stood like a rock), descended. Then he walked into the Squire's\nkitchen, with whip in hand, as usual, as if he were come to deliver\ngoods.\n\nThe fat cook now was sitting calmly by the fire meditating. To her the\ntime of year made no difference, except for the time that meat must\nhang, and the recollection of what was in its prime, and the\nconsideration of the draught required, and the shutting of the sun out\nwhen he spoiled the fire. In the fire of young days, when herself\nquite raw, this admirable cook had been \"done brown\" by a handsome\nyoung Methodist preacher. Before she understood what a basting-ladle\nis, her head was set spinning by his tongue and eyes; he had three\nwives already, but he put her on the list, took all her money out of\nher, and went another circuit. The poor girl spent about a year in\ncrying, and then she returned to the Church of England, buried her\nbaby, and became a cook. Without being soured by any evil, she now had\nlong experience, and a ripe style of twirling her thumbs upon her\napron.\n\n\"Plaize, Mrs. Cook,\" began Zacchary, entering under official\nprivilege, and trying to look full of business, \"do 'ee know where to\nlay hand on Mother Hookham? A vallyble piece of goods I has to\ndeliver, and must have good recate for un.\"\n\n\"But lor', Master Cripps, now, whatever be about? It ain't one of your\nHoxford days; and us never sends out no washing!\"\n\n\"You've a-knowed me a long time now, ain't you, Mrs. Cook? Did you\never know me for to play trickum-trully?\"\n\n\"Never have you done that to my knowledge,\" the good woman answered\nsteadfastly, though pained in her heart by the thought of one who had;\n\"Master Cripps is known to be the breadth of his own word.\"\n\n\"Then, my good soul, will 'ee fetch down Mother Hookham? It bain't for\nthe flourishes, the Lord A'mighty knows. I haven't got the governing\nof them little scrawls myself nor the seasoning amongst them as\nappertains to you. Bootifully you could a' done it, Mrs. Cook; but the\ndirections here is so particular! For a job of this sort, you are\ntwenty years too young.\"\n\n\"Oh, Master Cripps,\" cried the cook, who made a star, like that upon a\npie, for her manual sign; \"well you know that the ruin of my days has\nbeen trust in eddication. Standing outside of it, I was a-took in, and\nafore there come any pen or pencil, \u00c2\u00a3320 was gone. Not for a moment do\nI blame the Word of God, only them as blasphemeth it. But the whole of\nmy innard parts is turned against a papper, even on a pie-crust.\"\n\n\"Don't 'ee give way now, dear heart alive! Many a time have you told\nme, and every time I feels the more for 'ee. Quite a young 'ooman you\nbe still in a way, and a treasure for a young man with a whame in his\nthroat, and half-a-guinea every week you might aim for roasting\ndinner-parties. But do 'ee now go, and fetch Mother Hookham down.\"\n\n\"The old 'ooman isn't in the house, Master Cripps. She hath so many\nthings to mind that the wonder is how she can ever go through of them.\nA heavy weight she hath taken off my shoulders, ever since here she\ncome, in virtue of her tongue. But her darter can be had to put a\nflour to a'most anything if my signs isn't grand enough to go into\nyour hat, Master Cripps.\"\n\n\"Now, my dear good soul,\" replied the Carrier, standing back and\nlooking at her, \"you be taking of everything in a crooked way, you be.\nI have a little thing to see to--nort to say of kitchen in it, and\nsome sort of style pecooliar. Requaireth pecooliar management, I do\nassure you, and no harm. Will 'ee plaize to hearken to me now? Such as\nI have to say--not much.\"\n\nThe brave cook answered this appeal by running to fetch Mary Hookham;\nin everything that now she did, even with such a man as Cripps, the\nremembrance of vile deceit made her look out for a witness. Mary came\ndown with a bounce as if she had never been near her looking-glass,\nbut was born with her ribbons and colour to match. And her eyes shone\nfresh at the sight of Master Cripps.\n\n\"How well you be looking, my dear, for sure!\" said the Carrier, having\n(as a soldier has) his admiration of a pretty girl quickened by the\nsound of firearms. \"And I be come to make 'ee look still better.\"\n\nMary cast a glance at the cook, as if she thought her one too many.\nCripps must be going to declare his mind at last; and Mary had such\nfaith in him, that she required no witness.\n\n\"Who do 'ee think I have brought 'ee back?\" asked Zacchary, meaning to\nbe very quiet, but speaking so loud in his pride, that Mary, with a\npale face, ran and shut the door upon the steps leading to her\nmaster's quarters. Then she came back more at leisure, and put her\nelbows to her sides, and looked at Master Cripps, as if she had never\nmeant to think of him for herself. And this made Cripps, who had been\nexulting at her first proceedings, put down his whip and wonder.\n\n\"Not Miss Grace!\" cried Mary; \"surely never our Miss Grace!\"\n\n\"What a intellect that young woman hath!\" said Cripps aloud,\nreflecting; \"a'most too much, I be verily afeared.\"\n\n\"Oh no, Master Cripps, not at all too much for any one as entereth\ninto it, with a household feeling. But were I right? Oh, Master\nCripps, were I right?\"\n\n\"Mary Hookham,\" said Cripps, coming over, and laying his hand on her\nshoulder (as he used to do when she was a little wench, and made him a\ncurtsy with a glass of ale, even then admiring him), \"Mary, you were\nright, as I never could believe any would have the quickness. Cripps\nhath a-brought home to this old ancient mansion the very most vallyble\ncase of goods as ever were inside it. Better than the crown as the\nyoung Queen hath, for ten months now, preparing.\"\n\n\"Alive?\" asked Mary, shrinking back towards the fire, for his metaphor\nmight mean coffins.\n\n\"Now, there you go down again--there you go down,\" answered Cripps,\nwho enjoyed the situation, and desired to make the most of it. \"I\nthought you was all intellect--but better perhaps without too much.\nPut it to yourself now, Mary, whether I should look like this, if I\nhad only brought the remainses.\"\n\n\"Oh, where is her? Where is her? Wherever can her be?\" cried Mary,\nforgetting all her fine education, in strong vernacular excitement.\n\n\"Her be where I knows to find her again,\" answered Zacchary, with a\nsteadfast face. It was not for any one to run in and strike a light\nbetwixt him and his own work. \"Her might be to Abingdon, or to\nBanbury. Proper time come, I can vetch her forrard.\"\n\n\"Oh, I thought you had got her in the house, Master Cripps. How\ndisappointing you do grow, to be sure! I suppose it is the way of all\nmen.\"\n\nMary shed a tear, and Master Cripps (having been tried by sundry\nwomen) went closer, to be sure of it. He was pleased at the sign, but\nhe went on with his business.\n\n\"You desarve to know everything. Now, can 'ee shut the doors, without\na chance of anybody breaking in?\"\n\nMary and the cook, with a glance at one another, fastened all the\ndoors of the large low kitchen, except the one leading to the lane\nitself.\n\n\"You bide just as you be,\" said Cripps, \"and I'll show 'ee something\nworth looking at.\"\n\nHe ran to the place where Grace was hiding, in the chill and the heat\nof impatience, and he took the coarse sacks from her shoulders, as if\nher sackcloth time was done at last. Then he led her to the warmth and\nlight, and she hung behind afraid of them. That strange, but not\nuncommon shyness of one's own familiar home--when long unseen--came\nover her; and she felt, for the moment, almost afraid of her own\nbeloved father. But Cripps made her come, and both Mary Hookham and\nthe fat cook cried, \"Oh my! My good!\" and ran up and kissed her, and\nheld her hands; while she stood pale and mute, with large blue eyes\nbrimful of tears, and lips that wavered between smile and sob.\n\n\"Does he--does he know about me?\" she managed to say to Cripps, while\nshe glanced at the door leading up to her father's room.\n\n\"Not he! Lord bless you, my dear,\" said Cripps, \"it taketh 'em all\nhalf an hour apiece to believe as you ever be alive, miss.\"\n\n\"It would never take my father two minutes,\" answered Grace; \"he will\nbe a great deal too glad of it to doubt.\"\n\n\"You promised to bide by my diraxions,\" the Carrier cried\nreproachfully; \"if 'ee don't, I 'on't answer for nort of it. Now sit\nyou down, miss, by back-kitchen door, to come or go either way,\naccording as is ordered. Now, Mary, plaize to go, and say, that Cripps\nhath come to see his Worship about a little mistake he hath made.\"\n\nMr. Oglander never refused to see any who came to visit him. His\nsimple, straightforward mind compelled him to go through with\neverything as it turned up, whether it were of his own business, or\nany other person's. Therefore he said, \"Show Cripps in here.\"\n\nCripps was in no hurry to be shown in. He felt that he had a ticklish\njob to carry through, and he might drop the handles if himself were\ntouched amiss. And he thought that he could get on much better with a\nclever woman there to help him.\n\n\"Plaize, your Worship,\" he began, coming in, with his finger to his\nforelock, and his stiff knee sticking out. \"Don't 'ee run away now,\nMary, that's a dear; you knows all the way-bills; and his Worship will\nallow of you.\"\n\n\"Why, Cripps,\" Mr. Oglander exclaimed, \"you are making a very great\nfuss to-night; and you look as if you had been run over. Even if it is\nhalf-a-crown, Cripps, you are come to prove against me--put it down. I\nwill not dispute it. I know that you would rather wrong yourself than\nme.\" The old gentleman was tired, and he did not want to talk.\n\n\"In coorse, in coorse,\" said Zacchary (as if every man preferred to\nwrong himself), \"but the point is a different thing; and, Mary, speak\nup, and say you know it is.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, I do assure you now,\" said Mary, \"the point is altogether\nquite a different sort of thing.\"\n\n\"Then why can't you come to it?\" cried the Squire; \"is it that you\nwant to marry one another?\"\n\nMary's face blushed to a fine young colour; and Cripps made a nod at\nher, as if he meant to think of it, but must leave that for another\nevening.\n\n\"I never could abide such stuff,\" muttered Mary, \"as if all the world\nwas a-made of wives and husbands!\"\n\nThe Squire sat calmly with his head upon his hand, and his white hair\nglistening in the lamplight, as he gazed from one to the other, with a\nsmile of melancholy amusement. It would be a great discomfort to him\nto lose Mary Hookham's services; and he thought it a little unkind of\nher to leave him in this sad loneliness; but he had not lived\nthreescore years and ten without knowing what the way of the world is.\nTherefore, if Cripps had made up his mind--as the women had long been\ndeclaring that he as a man was bound to do--Mr. Oglander would be the\nlast to complain, or say a word to damp them. The Carrier himself had\nsome idea that such was the working of the Squire's mind.\n\n\"Now, your Worship,\" he said, putting Mary away to a place where she\ncould use her handkerchief, \"will 'ee plaize to hearken, without your\nown opinion before hast heard what there be to say? Nayther of us\ndrameth of doing you the wrong to take away Mary, while you be wanting\nof her. You ought to have knowed us better, Squire. And as for poor\nMary, I ain't said a word to back up her hopes of a-having me yet.\nNow, Miss Mary, have I?\"\n\n\"No, that you never haven't, Master Cripps! And it may come too late;\nif it ever do come.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" continued Mr. Cripps, without much terror at the way she\nturned her back; \"railly, your Worship, it was you who throwed us out.\nReckoning of my times is a hard thing for me; and a hundred and four\ntimes a year is too much for the discretion of a horse a'most.\"\n\n\"Very well, Cripps,\" said the Squire in despair; \"every one knows that\nyou must have your time. Not a word will I speak again, until I have\nyour leave.\"\n\n\"I calls it onhandsome of your Worship to say that; being so contrary\nof my best karaksteristicks. Your Worship maneth all things for the\nbest, I am persuaded; but speaking thus you drives me into such a\nprespiration, the same as used to be a sweat when I was young and\nforced to it. Now, doth your Worship know that all things cometh in a\nround, like a sound cart-wheel, to all such folks as trusts the Lord?\"\n\n\"I know that you have such a theory, Cripps. You beat the whole\nvillage in theology.\"\n\n\"And the learned scholar in Oxford, your Worship; he were quite\ndoubled up about the tribe of Levi. But for all of their stuff, the\nLord still goeth on, making His rounds to His own right time; and now\nHis time hath come for you, Squire.\"\n\n\"Do try to speak out, Cripps; and tell me what excites you so.\"\n\n\"Mary, his Worship is beginning to look white. Fetch in the\npepper-castor, and the gallon of vinegar as I delivered last\nWednesday.\"\n\n\"No, Mary, no. I want nothing of the kind. Tell him--beg him--just to\nspeak out what he means.\"\n\n\"Cripps--Master Cripps, now,\" cried Mary in a tremble; \"you be going\ntoo far, and then stopping of a heap like. His Worship ought to be let\ninto the whole of it gradooal--gradooal--gradooal.\"\n\n\"Can 'ee trust in the word of the Lord, your Worship?\" asked Cripps,\nadvancing bravely. \"Can 'ee do that now, without no disrespect to\n'ee?\"\n\n\"In two minutes more you'll drive me mad, between you!\" the old Squire\nshouted, as he rose and spread his arms. \"In the name of God, what is\nit? Is it of my daughter?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, father dearest! who else could it be in the whole of the\nworld?\" a clear voice cried, as a timid form grew clear. \"They would\ngo on all the night; but I could not wait a moment. Daddy, I am sure\nthat you won't be frightened. You can't have too much of your own\nGrace, can you? Don't let it go to your heart, my darling. Grace will\nrub it for you. There, let me put my head just as I used, and then you\nwill be certain, won't you?\"\n\nShe laid her head upon her father's breast, while Mary caught hold of\nthe Carrier's sleeve, and led him away to the passage. Then the old\nman's weak and trembling fingers strayed among his daughter's hair,\nand he could not speak, or smile, or weep.\n\n\"There, you will be better directly, darling,\" she whispered, looking\nup with streaming eyes, as she felt him tremble exceedingly, and her\nquick hands eased him of the little brooch (containing her mother's\nhair and her own), which fastened his quivering shirt-frill; \"you\nwanted me to come back, didn't you? But not in such a hurry,\ndarling--not in such a hurry. Father dear, why ever don't you kiss\nme?\"\n\n\"If you did not run away, dear--say you did not run away.\"\n\n\"Daddy, you cannot be so ill-minded; so very wicked to your only\nchild.\"\n\nThe old man took his child's hand in his own, and soothed her down,\nand drew her down, until they were kneeling at the table side by side;\nthen they put up their hands to thank God for one another, and did it\nnot with lips, but with heart and soul.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LV.\n\nSMITH TO THE RESCUE.\n\n\nNow, in the whole of Beckley village, scarcely a soul under eighty\nyears of age (unless it were of some child under eight, tucked up in\nrosy slumber) failed to discuss within half an hour the \"miracle\"\nabout Grace Oglander. That word was first set afoot in the parish by a\nman of settled habits, and therefore of sure authority. For Thomas\nKale had been put upon a horse, when the Carrier's leg would not go\nup, and ordered to ride for his life to tell Squire Overshute all that\nwas come to pass.\n\nThis Kale was a man of large wondering power, gifted moreover with a\nfaith in ghosts, which often detracted from his comfort. He had seen\nhis young mistress in a half-light only, when the household was called\nto look at her; and now he was ordered to a house where a lady had\ndied not more than a few weeks back. Between Beckley Barton and\nShotover Grange, there are two places known to be haunted. The\nnecessity for priming Thomas, before he started, had occurred\nunluckily to himself alone. Already, as he rode out of the yard, a\ngatepost and a tree shone spectrally. He felt the necessity for\npriming himself; and, prudent man as he was, he saw no mischief in\naffording it. Squire Overshute could not give him less than a guinea\nfor his tidings. Therefore (though pledged to the utmost not to speak)\nhe took the very turn which the prudent Cripps had shunned; and\npulling up at the window of the Dusty Anvil, gave a shout for hot\ngin-and-water.\n\nThe Anvil was ringing with hilarity that night, and its dust, if heavy\nsprinkling could ally it, was subsiding. For Beckley having played a\ncricket-match with Islip, and beaten the dalesmen by ten wickets--as\nneeds must be with five Crippses holding willow--an equally invincible\nresolve arose to out-eat the losers at the supper. Islip, defeated but\nnot disgraced, was well represented both in flesh and cash; and as Mr.\nKale called for his modest glass, a generous feeling awoke in the\nbreasts of several young men to pay for it. For the wickets had been\npitched in a meadow of the Squire's, where Kale had plied scythe and\nroller.\n\nThomas Kale saw that it would be a most uncandid and illiberal act to\nopen his mouth for a negative only. He firmly restricted good feeling,\nhowever, to three good bumpers, and a bottomer; pledging himself, on\ncompulsion, to call on his way back and manage the duplicate. But his\nheart was so good, that before he rode off, with a flout at all ghosts\nand goblins, he took an old crony by the name upon his smock, and told\nhim where to go for a \"miracle.\"\n\nNow, who should this be but old Daddy Wakeling, that ancient and\nvalued friend of Cripps, and one of the best men in Elsfield parish?\nDaddy was forced to spend much of his time outside his own parish, for\nthe best of reasons--and a melancholy one--there was no public-house\ninside of it. Here he was now, with his fine white locks and\npatriarchal countenance, propounding a test to our finest qualities, a\ntouchstone of one's lofty confidence or low cynicism--whether the\nsubject should now be pronounced more venerable, or more tipsy.\n\nBut old Daddy Wakeling would be the very last (when getting near the\nmiddle of his third gallon) to conceal from his friends any gratifying\nnews; and ere ever Kale's horse's heels turned the corner, Daddy's\nwise old lips were wagging into the ear of a crony. In less than two\nminutes, Phil Hiss had got the news; a council was held in the\nlong-room of the inn; and a march upon the Squire's house, and a\nserenade by every one who could scrape, blow, twang, or halloa, was\nthe resolution of a moment.\n\nIn the thick of the rout, as with good intent they approached the\nold-fashioned coach-doors (which led to the front where they meant to\nbe musical), a short square fellow slipped out of the crowd, and\nwithout observation went his way. His way was to a little hut of a\nstable, fastened only with a prong outside, but holding a nice young\nhorse, who had finished his supper, but was not sleepy. He neighed as\nJohn Smith came in, for he felt quite inclined for a little exercise,\nand he knew the value of the saying he had heard--\"After supper, trot\na mile.\" Numbers Cripps was his owner, in that shameful age of\nownership--which soon will be abolished, now that its prime key is\ngone, the key of holy wedlock--and the butcher had offered Mr. Smith a\nride, whenever he should happen to want one.\n\nThe night was well up in the sky, and the track of summer daylight\nstar-swept; the dim remembrance of a brighter hour (that hangs round a\ntree, like a halo) was gone; and only little twinkles shone through\nbays of leafage against the tidal power of the moon; and the long\nimmeasurable stretch of silence spread faint avenues of fear.\n\nMr. John Smith was a very brave man. Imagination never stirred the\ncorpulence of his comfort. What he either saw or sifted out by his own\nprocess, that he believed; and very little else. And so he rode,\nthrough light and shade, and the grain of the air which is neither;\nwhile the forest grew deeper with phantasm, and the depth of night\nmade way for him.\n\nSuddenly even he was startled. In a dark narrow place, where he kept\nthe track, and stuck his heels under his horse's belly (for fear of\nbeing taken sideways), something dashed by him, with a pant and roar,\nand fire flying out of it. Mr. Smith blessed his stars that he was not\nrolled over, as he very well might have been; for that which flew by\nhim, like a streak of meteor, was a strong horse frantic.\n\nSmith turned round in his saddle, and stared; but the runaway sped the\nfaster, as if he were rushing away from the forest, with a pack of\nwolves behind him. The stirrups of his empty saddle struck fire,\nclashing under him, and his swift flight scarcely left a sound of\nbreath or hoof to follow him.\n\n\"The devil is after him!\" said John Smith; \"I never saw a horse in\nsuch a state of mind. I may as well mark the spot where he came out.\nHe has left, as sure as I sit here, a tale to be told, in the\nbackground.\"\n\nWithout dismounting, he broke off a branch of young white poplar, and\ncast it so that by daylight he could find it; and then, with a very\nuneasy mind, he rode on, to trace the rest of it. He was not by any\nmeans in Luke Sharp's pay (as one or two persons had suspected),\nneither was he even of his privy council; and yet he was bound hand\nand foot to him; partly by fealty of a conquered mind, and partly by\nsense of his brother Joe's complicity and subservience. John Smith, in\nhis own way, was an honourable man; and money was no bribe to him.\n\nWith quickened alarm, he rode on at all speed towards the cottage of\nthe swineherd. Never in any way had he dealt with the sylvan schemes\nof Mr. Sharp, or even from a distance watched them. It was long ere he\nhad any clear suspicions--for his tall brother kept miles away from\nhim--and in seeking the remains of Grace under the snowdrift, he\nwrought out his duty with blind honesty.\n\nJohn Smith's nerves were of iron, and even the riderless horse had not\nscattered them; but though he rode on bravely still, a cloud of gloom\nfell over him. It would make a sad difference to his life if anything\nhad happened to Mr. Sharp (for Smith had invested a little money under\nthe lawyer's guidance), and knowing Luke Sharp as he did, he feared\nthat evil had befallen him.\n\nHence, with dark misgiving, and the set resolve to face it, he lashed\nhis horse on at a perilous rate, through the wattled ways of\nmoonlight. The glance and the glimpse of light and shade flew past\nhim, like a cataract, till suddenly even he was scared by the sound of\nhis name in a sad clear voice. He pulled up his horse, and laid his\nhand on the butt of a pistol beneath his cape, till a woman came forth\ninto the light, and said--\n\n\"I was sure you would come; but too late--it is too late!\"\n\n\"Cinnaminta, show me,\" he answered very softly, knowing by her gesture\nthat the mischief was at hand. As soon as he was off his horse, and\nhad made him fast by the bridle, she led him round some shadowy\ncorners into a little dingle. This had no great trees to crowd it; and\nthough it lay below the level of the wood around, the moon was high\nenough now to throw a broad gangway of light along it. The sides were\nfringed or jagged with darkness, cumbrous tree or mantled ivy jutting\nforth black elbows; but in the middle lay and spread fair sward of\ndewy emblements, swept with brightness, and garnished for a Whitsun\ndance of fairies.\n\nBut now, instead of skip and music, sigh and sob and wailing noises of\nthe human heart were heard. A fine young form, of the Oxford build,\nlay heavily girt with molehills, enfolded vainly in a velvet cloak,\nand vainly on every side adjured to open its eyes and come back again.\nKit was not at all the fellow thus to be addressed in vain--if he only\ncould have heard the living voices challenge him. His love of sport\nhad been love of pluck, as it generally is with Englishmen; and all\nhis dogs, of different sizes, must have taught him something. His\nmother now was pulling at him, in a storm of fear and hope. She felt\nthat he could not be dead, because it would be so outrageous; and yet\nher feeble heart was fearful that such things had been before. Happily\nfor herself, she knew not what had happened to him; but took it for an\naccident of the woods; for the gipsy-woman, who alone had seen it, had\nbeen too kind to tell the truth.\n\n\"Oh, Kit, Kit! now only look!\" the poor fond mother was going on;\n\"only lift one eyelid, darling; only move one little hand\"--his hands\nwere of very considerable size--\"or do anything, anything you like,\ndear, just to show that you are coming back, back to your own mother!\nKit--oh, my Kit, my own and ever only Kit--or Christopher, if you like\nit better, darling--here have I been for whole hours and hours, and\nnot one word will you say to me! If ever I laughed at you, Kit, in my\nlife, you must have felt how proud I was. There is not anything in all\nthe world, or anybody to come near you, Kit. Only come--only be near\nme, instead of breaking all my heart like this!\"\n\nWorn out with misery, she fell back; and Cinnaminta, with a short\nquick sigh, knelt down on the turf, and supported her.\n\n\"Four times have I had to bear it, and every time worse than the time\nbefore,\" she said in her soft clear tone to herself; but only to\nremind herself of the tenderness she was sure to show. \"And this was\nher only one, and grown up!\"\n\nHer face (still beautiful and lovely with the sad love in her eyes,\nthe memory of the time when still there was somebody to live for)\nshone in the gentle light, now poured abundantly on all of them. Of\nall who had lived, and loved, and suffered, and now made shadows in\nthe moonshine, not one had been down to the holy depths of sorrow as\nthis woman had.\n\n\"Catch un up now,\" cried John Smith, who never knew how his ideas were\ntimed; \"catch un up by the heels, one of 'ee, while I take un by the\nhead. This here baistly hole be enow to fetch the ghost of his life\nout. He hath got life in him. Don't tell me! His ears be like a shell;\nand no dead man's is. Rap on the nob! Lor' bless my heart, I'd sooner\nhave fifty, than one on the basket. What, all on you afeard to heckle\nhim?\"\n\n\"Oh no, sir, oh no, sir,\" cried poor Mrs. Sharp, as Tickuss, and\nanother man, fell away; \"I am not very strong, but I can help my\nchild.\"\n\n\"Ma'am, you are a lady!\" said John Smith, that being his very highest\ncrown of praise; \"but as for you--a d----d set of cowards--go to the\ndevil, all of you! Now, ma'am, I will not trouble you, except to\nfollow after us. Cinny will clear the way in front; it cometh more\nnatural to her. And you, ma'am, shall follow me as you please; and\nsorry I am not to help you. A little shaking will do him a world of\ngood.\"\n\nHe was taking up Kit, with a well-adjusted balance, while he spoke to\nher; and he wasted his breath in nothing, except in telling her to\nfollow him. As the hind comes after the poor slain fawn, or the cow\nruns after the netted cart, where the white face of her calf weeps\nout, even so Mrs. Sharp of her dress thought nothing--though cut up,\nlike a carrot, in the latest London style, and trimmed with almost\nevery flower nature never saw--anyhow, after Kit she went, and knew\nnot light from darkness.\n\nMr. Smith sturdily managed to get on; he was thickly built, and had\nwell-set reins; and though poor Kit was no feather-weight, his bearer\ndid not flag with him. Then setting the body of the lad on a mound,\nwhere the moon shone clearly upon his face, and the night air fanned\nhim quietly, John Smith very calmly pulled out a bright weapon, and\nflourished it, and felt the edge.\n\n\"Oh no, sir! Oh pray, sir!\" cried Mrs. Sharp, falling on her knees,\nand enclasping her poor boy.\n\n\"Cinny, just lead her behind that bush. 'Tis either death, or blood,\nwith him.\"\n\n\"Oh no, I never could bear to be out of sight. If it really must be\ndone, I will not shriek. I will not even sigh. Only let me stay by his\nside!\"\n\nJohn Smith signed to his sister-in-law, who took the mother's\ntrembling hands, and turned her away for a moment.\n\n\"Now fetch cold water. That vein must not be allowed to bleed too\nlong, ma'am. 'Tis a ticklish one to manage for a surgeon even; and at\npresent it is sulky. But it only wants a little air, and just the\nleast little touch again. If you could just manage to go and say your\nprayers, ma'am, we could get on a long sight better.\"\n\n\"Oh, I never thought of that. How sinful of me! Oh, kind good man, I\nimplore of you--\"\n\n\"Not of me, ma'am. Pray to God in heaven, unless you wish to see me\nrun away. And if I do, he slips right off the hooks.\"\n\nShe turned away, with her weak hands clasped; but whether she prayed\nor not, never could she tell. But one thing she bore in mind, as long\nas soul abode with it, and that was the leap of her heart when Smith\nshouted in a good loud voice, \"All right!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI.\n\nFATAL ACCIDENT TO THE CARRIER.\n\n\nNow, that little maid who with such strength, alike of mind and body,\nhad opened the paternal gate, and then bewailed her prowess, happened\nto be the especial favourite of her good Aunt Esther. Therefore no\nsooner had the Carrier begun his eventful homeward course, as\nheretofore related, than Etty, who loved a forest walk and felt rather\ndull without Zacchary, took Peggy's fat red hand, and, after a good\ntea with Susannah, set forth for an evening stroll, to gather flowers\nand hear the birds sing.\n\nAlmost before they had got well into the wooded places, Peggy shrank\naway from a black timber shed, partly overhung by trees.\n\n\"Peggy not go there, Aunt Etty,\" she said; \"goose in there, a great\nwhite goose!\"\n\n\"A ghost, you little goose?\" answered Esther, laughing, for still\nthere was good sunset. \"Come and show me; I want to see a ghost.\"\n\n\"No, no, no!\" cried the child, pulling backward, and struggling as\nhard as she had struggled with the gate; \"Peggy see a white goose in a\nblack hole there, all day.\"\n\n\"Then, Peggy, stop here while I go and look. You won't be afraid to do\nthat, will you?\"\n\nRunning bravely up to the hole in the boards, Esther saw, to her great\namazement, the form, perhaps the corpse, of a man, stretched at length\non the ground inside. It lay too much in the dark for the face to be\nseen, and the dress was so swaddled with netting, and earthy, that\nlittle could be made of it. A torn strip of cambric, that once had\nbeen white, lay partly on the body and partly on the board. Esther\ncaught it up; she remembered having ironed something of this shape for\nsomebody once, who was going to be examined. She knew where to look\nfor the mark, and there she saw in small letters--\"T. Hardenow.\"\n\nSurprised as she was, she did not lose her wits or courage, as she\nused to do. She ran to the door of the shed, tried the padlock, and\nfinding it fastened (as she had feared), made haste to the\ngrain-house, and seized a bunch of keys. Not one of them truly was\nborn with the lock, but one was soon found to serve the turn; then\nEsther pushed back the creaking door, and timidly gazed round the\nshadowy shed. She was quite alone now, for her little niece, with\nshort sobs of terror, had set off for home.\n\nIn the light admitted by the open door, young Esther descried a poor\nmiserable thing, helpless, still as a log, and senseless, yet to her\nfaithful heart the idol of all adoration. Gently, step by step, she\nstole to the prostrate form, and knelt down softly, and reverently\ntouched it. She feared to seem to take advantage of a helpless moment;\nand yet a keen joy, mixed with terror, shone in the eagerness of her\neyes. \"He is alive, I am sure of that,\" she said to herself, as she\npulled forth a pair of strong scissors which she always carried; \"he\nis alive, but very, very nearly dead. What wretches can have treated\nhim like this?\"\n\nIn two minutes, Hardenow was free from every cord and throng of\nbondage; his lax arms fell at his sides; his legs (that had saved his\nlife by kicking) slowly sank back to their native angles, like a\nlobster's claw untied, and his small and dismally empty stomach\nquivered almost invisibly.\n\n\"Oh, he is starving, or downright starved!\" cried Esther, watching his\nwhite lips, which trembled with some glad memory of suction, and then\nstiffened again to some Anglican dream. \"After all, I have blamed\nother folk quite amiss. He hath corded himself away from his victuals\nto give way to his noble principles. But how could he lock himself in?\nThe Lord must have sent a bad angel to tempt him, and then to turn the\nkey on him.\"\n\nBefore she had finished this reasoning process, the girl was half-way\ntowards the cot of Tickuss, her heart outweighing her mind, according\nto all true feminine proportions. She ran in swiftly upon Susannah,\nsitting in the dusky kitchen and pondering over a very slow fire the\ncookery of the children's supper. These good young children never\nfailed to go to see the pigs fed, and down at the styes they all were\nat this moment, with no victuals come, and the pigs all squeaking,\nbecause the pig-master was not at home.\n\nThis was most sad, and the children felt it; nevertheless they bore\nit, knowing that their own pot was warming. But they too might have\nsqueaked, if they had known that out of their own pot Aunt Etty was\nstealing half the meat and all the little cobs of jelly. It was as\nfine a pot of stuff as ever Susannah Cripps had made, for she did not\nhold at all with fattening the pigs, and starving her own children;\nand she argued most justly, while Esther all the while was ladling all\nthe virtue out.\n\nEtty had never been known to do anything violent or high-handed; yet\nnow, without entering into even the very shortest train of reasoning,\naway she went swifter than any train, bearing in her right hand the\nbest dresser-jug (filled with the children's tidbits of nurture), and\nin her left hand flourishing Susannah's own darling silver\nwedding-spoon. Mrs. Leviticus longed to rush in chase of her; but ere\nher slowly startled nerves could send the necessary tingle to her\nruminating knees, the girl was out of sight, and for her vestige\nlingered naught but a very provoking smell of soup.\n\nNow, in so advanced a stage of the world's existence (and of this\nnarrative) is it needful, judicious, or even becoming to describe,\nspoonful by spoonful, however grateful, delicious, and absorbing, the\nprocess of administering and receiving soup? To \"give and take\" is\nsaid, by people of large experience in life, to be about the latest\nand most consummate lesson of humanity; coming even after that extreme\nof wisdom which teaches us to \"grin and bear it.\" But in the present\ntrifling instance, two young people very soon began to be\ncomparatively at home with the subject. The opening of the eyes, in\nall countries and creatures, is done a good deal later than the\nopening of the mouth; the latter being the essential, the former quite\na fortuitous proceeding.\n\nAfter six spoonfuls, as counted by Esther, Hardenow opened both his\neyes; after two or three more, he knew where he was; and when he had\nswallowed a dozen and a bonus, scarcely any of his wits were wanting.\nStill Esther, for fear of a relapse, went on; though her hand trembled\ndreadfully when he sat up, with his poor bones creaking sadly, and\ntried to be steady upon her arm, but was overbalanced by his weight of\nbrain. Instead of shrieking, or screaming, she took advantage of this\nopportunity, and his bony chin dropping afforded the finest opening\ntowards his interior.\n\nTo put it briefly, he quite came round, and after twenty spoonfuls\nvowed--with the conscience rushing for the moment into the arms of\ncommon sense--that never would he fast again. And after thirty were\nabsorbed and beginning to assimilate, he gazed at Esther's smiling\neyes, and saw the clearest and truest solution of his \"postulates on\ncelibacy.\" Esther dropped her eyes in terror, and made him drink the\ndregs and bottom, with a convert's zealous gulp. And as it happened,\nthis was wise.\n\nIf any malignant persons charge him with having sold, for a mess of\npottage, man's noblest birthright, celibacy, let every such person be\ncorded up, at the longest possible date after breakfast, and the\nshortest before dinner--or rather, alas! before dinner-time--let him\nstay corded, and rolling about in a hog-house (as long as roll he can,\nwhich never would approach Mr. Hardenow's cycle); let him, throughout\nthis whole period, instead of eating, expect to be eaten; then with a\nwolf in his stomach (if he has one) let him lose his wits (if he has\nany), and then let a lovely girl come and free him, and feed him, and\ncry over him, and regard him--with his clothes at their very worst,\nand cakes of dirt in his eyes and mouth--as the imperial Jove in some\nDict\u00c3\u00a6an cavern dormant; and then, as the light and the life flow back,\nand the power of his heart awakes, let there manifestly accrue thereto\na better, gentler, and sweeter heart, timid even of its own pulse, and\nashamed of its own veracity--and then if he takes all this unmoved,\nwhy, let him be corded up again, and nobody come to deliver him.\n\nEsther only smiled and wept at her patient's ardent words and\nimpassioned gratitude. She knew that between them was a great gulf\nfixed, and that the leap across it seldom has a happy landing; and\nwhen poor Hardenow fell back, in the weak reaction of a heart more fit\nfor pain than passion, she knelt at his side, and nursed and cheered\nhim, less with the air of a courted maiden than of a careful handmaid.\nIn the end, however, this feeling (like most of those which are\nadverse to our wishes) was prevailed upon to subside, and Esther,\nalthough of the least revolutionary and longest-established stock in\nEngland--that of the genuine Crippses, whose name, originally no doubt\n\"Chrysippus,\" indicates the possession of a golden horse--Etty Cripps,\nfinding that the heart of her adored one had, in Splinters' opinion, a\nperilous fissure, requiring change of climate, consented at last\n(having no house of her own) to come down from the tilt, and go to\nAfrica.\n\nFor Hardenow, as he grew older and able to regard mankind more\nlargely, came out from many of the narrow ways, which (like the lanes\nof Beckley) satisfy their final cause by leading into one another.\nWith the growth of his learning, his candour grew; and he strove to\nbind others by his own strap and buckle, as little as he offered to be\nbound by theirs. Therefore when two of his very best friends made a\n_bon\u00c3\u00a2 fide_ job of it, and being unable to think their thoughts out\ngot it done by deputy, and sank to infallible happiness, Thomas\nHardenow pulled up, and set his heels into the ground of common sense,\nlike a horse at the brink of a quarry-pit; and the field of reason,\nrich and gracious, opened its gates again to him.\n\nHerein he cut no capers, as so many of the wilder spirits did, but\nmade himself ready for some true work and solid advantage to his race.\nAnd so, before any University Mission, or plough-and-Bible enterprise,\nHardenow set forth to open a track for commerce and civilization, and\nto fight the devil and slavery in the rich rude heart of Africa.\nBesides his extraordinary gift of tongues, he had many other\nqualifications--the wiriness of his legs and stomach, his quiet style\nof listening (so that even a \"nigger\" need not be snubbed), his\nmagnificent freedom from humour (an element fatal to stern\nconvictions), and last not least, as he said to Etty, for a clinching\nargument, his wife's acquaintance with the carrying trade.\n\nHappy exile, how much better than home misery it is! But the House of\nCripps sent forth another member into banishment, with little choice\nor chance of much felicity on his part. As there are woes more strong\nthan tears, so are there crimes beyond the lash. When the doings of\nLeviticus were brought to light, and shown to be unsuccessful, a\ncouncil of Crippses was held in his hog-house, and a stern decree\npassed to expatriate him. Tickuss was offered his fair say, and did\nhis very best to defend himself; but the case from the first was\nhopeless. If he had wronged any other parish than Beckley, or even any\nother as well, there might have been some escape for him. Cruelty,\ncowardice, treason high and low, perjury to his own elder brother, and\neternal disgrace to his birthplace--there was not a word in the mouth\nof any one half bad enough to use to him. The Carrier rose, and said\nall he could say, for the sake of the many children; but weighty with\npiety as he was, he could not stem the many-fountained torrent of the\nCrippsic wrath. The pigs of Leviticus were divided among all the\nnephews and nieces, and cousins (ere ever a creditor got a hock-rope\nor a flick-whip ready), and Tickuss himself, unhoused, unstyed,\nunlarded, and unsmocked, wandered forth with his business gone, like a\nGadarene swine-herd void of swine.\n\nFor years and years that fine old hog-farm was the haunt of rats and\nrabbits; never a grunt or squeak of porker (ringing or rung\neloquently) shook the fringe of ivied shade, or jarred the acorn in\nits cup, until a third son arose and grew up to Zacchary Cripps\nhereafter. All the neighbourhood lay under a cloud of fear and\nsadness, because of what Luke Sharp had done, not to others, but\nhimself. Luke Sharp, the greatest of all lawyers--so the affrighted\nwoodman says--may and must, alas, be seen (at certain moments of the\nforest moon) rising on horseback from the black pool where his black\nlife ended, gaining the shore with a silent bound, and galloping, with\nhis arm held forth as straight as any sign-post, to the nook of dark\nlane where he smote his son; and then to the ruined hut, wherein he\nimprisoned the fair lady; and then to the rotting shed, in which he\ncorded and starved the great Oxford scholar.\n\nWhether, for the assertion of the law, Luke Sharp is allowed by some\nevil power thus to revisit the glimpses of the moon, or whether he\nlies in silent blackness, ignorant of evil--sure it is that no one\ncares to stay beyond the fall of dusk in that part of the forest.\n\nBut as soon as the lawyer's wife and son, by virtue of the poplar\nmark, had found and quietly buried his disappointed corpse, they made\nthe very best of a broken business, as cheerfully as could be hoped\nfor. Each of them sighed very heavily at times, especially when they\nwere almost certain of hearing again, round the corner or downstairs,\na masterful and very memorable tread. Therefore, with what speed they\nmight, they let their fine old Cross Duck House, and fleeing all low\ncuriosity, unpleasant remark, and significant glance, took refuge\nunder the quiet roof of Kit's aunt Peggy, near High Wycombe, where he\nhad hoped to lodge, and woo his timid forest angel. Here Kit found\ntardy comfort, and recovered health quite rapidly, by writing his own\ndirge in many admirable metres, till, being at length made laureate of\na strictly local paper--at a salary of nil per annum, and some quarts\nof ale to stand--he swung his cloak and lit his pipe in the style of\nbetter days.\n\nFrom those whom his father had wronged so deeply he would accept no\nhelp whatever, much as they desired to show their sense of his good\nbehaviour. And when the second-best ambition of his life arrived by\ncoach--that notable dog, \"Pablo\"--if Christopher could have sniffed\nlightest scent of Beckley, or Shotover, in the black dog-winkles of\nhis nostrils, the odds are ten to one that Oxford never would have\nsighed (as all through the October term she did) at the loss of her\nfinest badgerer.\n\nIn spite of all this obstinacy, three people were resolved to make him\ncome round and be comfortable, settled, and respectable. To this they\nbrought him in the end, and made him give up fugitive pieces, sonnets,\nstanzas to a left-hand glove, and epitaphs on a cenotaph. The Squire,\nand Russel, and Grace could not compose their own snug happiness\nwithout providing that Kit should be less miserable than his poetry.\nSo they married him to a banker's daughter, and--better still--put him\nin the bank itself.\n\nThe loyalty of Mrs. Fermitage to her distinguished husband's memory\nwas never disturbed by any knowledge of that fatal codicil. Poor Mrs.\nSharp, as she slowly recovered from the sad grief wrought by greed,\nmore and more reverently cherished her great husband's high repute.\nShe rejoined him in a better world--or at least she set forth to do\nso--without any knowledge of the blow he had given to her son's head,\nand her own heart. Kit, like a man, concealed that outrage, and, like\na good son, listened to his departed father's praises. But in her\nheart the widow felt that some of these might be imperilled, if that\ncodicil turned up. Long time she kept it in reserve, as a thunderbolt\nfor Joan Fermitage; but Pablo's arrival improved her feelings, and so\ndid the banker's daughter; and finally, on Kit's wedding-day, with a\nsigh and a prayer, she took advantage of a clear fire and a rapid\ndraught--and the codicil flew through the chimney-pot.\n\nAs a lawyer's daughter, she revered such things. In the same capacity,\nshe knew that now it could make no great practical difference; for\nGrace was quite sure of her good aunt's money. And again, as a widow\nand mother, she felt what a stain must be cast on the name she loved\nbest, if this little document ever came to light--other than good\nfirelight.\n\nBut why should Esther have had no house of her own, as darkly hinted\nabove, so as to almost compel her to descend from tilt to tent? The\nreason is not far to seek, and he who runs may read it, without\nrunning out of Beckley.\n\nCripps, the Carrier, now being past the middle milestone of man's\nlife, and seeing every day, more and more, the grey hairs in his\nhorse's tail, lowered his whip in a shady place, and let his reins go\nslackly, and pulled his crooked sixpence out, and could not see to\nread it. And yet the summer sun was bright in the top of the bushes\nover him!\n\n\"I vear a must; I zee no way out of un,\" Zacchary said to his lonely\nself. \"Etty is as good as gone a'ready; her cannot stan' out agin that\nthere celibacy; and none else understandeth the frying-pan. The Lord\nknows how I have fought agin the womminses, seeing all as I has seen.\nAnd better I might a' done, if I must come to it, many a time in the\nlast ten year. Better at laste for the brown, white, and yellow;\nthough the woman as brought might a' shattered 'em again. After all,\nMary might be a deal worse; though I have a-felt some doubt consarning\nof her tongue; but her hath a proper respect for me, and forty puns to\nOxford bank--if her moother spaiketh raight of her; and the Squaire\nhath given me a new horse, to come on whenso Dobbin beginneth to wear\nout. Therefore his domestics hath first claim; though I'd soonder\ndraive Dobbin than ten of un. What shall us do now? Whatever shall us\ndo?\"\n\nZacchary Cripps pulled off his hat in a slow perspiration of suspense;\nfor if he once made up his mind, there would be no way out of it. He\nlooked at his horse with a sad misgiving, both on his own account and\nDobbin's. The marriage of the master might wrong the horse, and the\nhorse might no more be the master's. Suddenly a bright idea struck\nhim--a bar of sunshine through the shade.\n\n\"Thou shalt zettle it, Dobbin,\" he cried, leaning over and stroking\nhis gingery loins. \"It consarneth thee most, or, leastways, quite as\nmuch. Never hath any man had a better horse. The will of the Lord\ntakes the strength out of all of us; but He leaveth, and addeth to the\nwisdom therein. Dobbin, thou seest things as never men can tell of.\nNow, if thou waggest thy tail to the right--I will; and so be to the\nleft--I wun't. Mind what thou doest now. Call upon thy wisdom, nag,\nand give thy master honestly the sense of thy discretion.\"\n\nWith a settled mind, and no disturbance, he awaited the delivery of\nDobbin's tail. A fly settled on the white foam of the harness on the\noff side of this ancient horse. Away went his tail with a sprightly\nflick at it; and Cripps accepted the result. The result was the\nsatisfaction of Mary's long and faithful love for him, and the happy\ncontinuance, in woodland roads, of the loyal race and unpretentious\ncourse of Cripps, the Carrier.\n\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\nNEW ISSUE OF LOW'S STANDARD NOVELS.\n\n_Cloth elegant 2s. 6d.; picture boards, 2s._\n\n\nThe following are being published at short intervals:--\n\n    Lorna Doone                        By R.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.  Email\ncontact links and up to date contact information can be found at the\nFoundation's web site and official page at www.gutenberg.org\/contact\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":787,"split":"train"}
