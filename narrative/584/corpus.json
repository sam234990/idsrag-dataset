{"ori_id":"8b0d665484069bc3a2fee227f7c1899c4b90dcde","title":"The Little White Bird","context":"The Little White Bird\n The Little White Bird is a series of short episodes, including both accounts of the narrator's day-to-day activities in contemporary London and fanciful tales set in Kensington Gardens and elsewhere.The story is set in several locations; the earlier chapters are set in the town of London, contemporaneous to the time of Barrie's writing, and involving some time travel of a few years, and other fantasy elements, while remaining within the London setting. The middle chapters that later became Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens are set in London's famous Kensington Gardens, introduced by the statement that \"All perambulators lead to Kensington Gardens\". The Kensington Gardens chapters include detailed descriptions of the features of the Gardens, along with fantasy names given to the locations by the story's characters, especially after \"Lock-Out Time\", described by Barrie as the time at the end of the day when the park gates are closed to the public, and the fairies and other magical inhabitants of the park can move about more freely than during the daylight, when they must hide from ordinary people. The third section of the book, following the Kensington Gardens chapters, are again set generally in London, though there are some short returns to the Gardens that are not part of the Peter Pan stories. In a two-page diversion in chapter 24, Barrie brings the story to Patagonia, and a journey by ship returning to England at the \"white cliffs of Albion\".\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Little White Bird, by J.

David and I Set Forth Upon a Journey\n\nSometimes the little boy who calls me father brings me an invitation\nfrom his mother: \"I shall be so pleased if you will come and see me,\"\nand I always reply in some such words as these: \"Dear madam, I decline.\"\nAnd if David asks why I decline, I explain that it is because I have no\ndesire to meet the woman.\n\n\"Come this time, father,\" he urged lately, \"for it is her birthday, and\nshe is twenty-six,\" which is so great an age to David, that I think he\nfears she cannot last much longer.\n\n\"Twenty-six, is she, David?\" I replied. \"Tell her I said she looks\nmore.\"\n\nI had my delicious dream that night. I dreamt that I too was twenty-six,\nwhich was a long time ago, and that I took train to a place called\nmy home, whose whereabouts I see not in my waking hours, and when I\nalighted at the station a dear lost love was waiting for me, and we went\naway together. She met me in no ecstasy of emotion, nor was I surprised\nto find her there; it was as if we had been married for years and parted\nfor a day. I like to think that I gave her some of the things to carry.\n\nWere I to tell my delightful dream to David's mother, to whom I have\nnever in my life addressed one word, she would droop her head and raise\nit bravely, to imply that I make her very sad but very proud, and she\nwould be wishful to lend me her absurd little pocket handkerchief. And\nthen, had I the heart, I might make a disclosure that would startle her,\nfor it is not the face of David's mother that I see in my dreams.\n\nHas it ever been your lot, reader, to be persecuted by a pretty woman\nwho thinks, without a tittle of reason, that you are bowed down under\na hopeless partiality for her? It is thus that I have been pursued for\nseveral years now by the unwelcome sympathy of the tender-hearted and\nvirtuous Mary A----. When we pass in the street the poor deluded soul\nsubdues her buoyancy, as if it were shame to walk happy before one she\nhas lamed, and at such times the rustle of her gown is whispered words\nof comfort to me, and her arms are kindly wings that wish I was a little\nboy like David. I also detect in her a fearful elation, which I am\nunaware of until she has passed, when it comes back to me like a faint\nnote of challenge. Eyes that say you never must, nose that says why\ndon't you? and a mouth that says I rather wish you could: such is the\nportrait of Mary A---- as she and I pass by.\n\nOnce she dared to address me, so that she could boast to David that I\nhad spoken to her. I was in the Kensington Gardens, and she asked would\nI tell her the time please, just as children ask, and forget as they\nrun back with it to their nurse. But I was prepared even for this, and\nraising my hat I pointed with my staff to a clock in the distance. She\nshould have been overwhelmed, but as I walked on listening intently, I\nthought with displeasure that I heard her laughing.\n\nHer laugh is very like David's, whom I could punch all day in order to\nhear him laugh. I dare say she put this laugh into him. She has been\nputting qualities into David, altering him, turning him forever on a\nlathe since the day she first knew him, and indeed long before, and all\nso deftly that he is still called a child of nature. When you release\nDavid's hand he is immediately lost like an arrow from the bow. No\nsooner do you cast eyes on him than you are thinking of birds. It is\ndifficult to believe that he walks to the Kensington Gardens; he always\nseems to have alighted there: and were I to scatter crumbs I opine he\nwould come and peck. This is not what he set out to be; it is all the\ndoing of that timid-looking lady who affects to be greatly surprised by\nit. He strikes a hundred gallant poses in a day; when he tumbles, which\nis often, he comes to the ground like a Greek god; so Mary A---- has\nwilled it. But how she suffers that he may achieve! I have seen him\nclimbing a tree while she stood beneath in unutterable anguish; she had\nto let him climb, for boys must be brave, but I am sure that, as she\nwatched him, she fell from every branch.\n\nDavid admires her prodigiously; he thinks her so good that she will be\nable to get him into heaven, however naughty he is. Otherwise he would\ntrespass less light-heartedly. Perhaps she has discovered this; for, as\nI learn from him, she warned him lately that she is not such a dear as\nhe thinks her.\n\n\"I am very sure of it,\" I replied.\n\n\"Is she such a dear as you think her?\" he asked me.\n\n\"Heaven help her,\" I said, \"if she be not dearer than that.\"\n\nHeaven help all mothers if they be not really dears, for their boy\nwill certainly know it in that strange short hour of the day when every\nmother stands revealed before her little son. That dread hour ticks\nbetween six and seven; when children go to bed later the revelation has\nceased to come. He is lapt in for the night now and lies quietly there,\nmadam, with great, mysterious eyes fixed upon his mother. He is summing\nup your day. Nothing in the revelations that kept you together and\nyet apart in play time can save you now; you two are of no age, no\nexperience of life separates you; it is the boy's hour, and you have\ncome up for judgment. \"Have I done well to-day, my son?\" You have got to\nsay it, and nothing may you hide from him; he knows all. How like your\nvoice has grown to his, but more tremulous, and both so solemn, so\nunlike the voice of either of you by day.\n\n\"You were a little unjust to me to-day about the apple; were you not,\nmother?\"\n\nStand there, woman, by the foot of the bed and cross your hands and\nanswer him.\n\n\"Yes, my son, I was. I thought--\"\n\nBut what you thought will not affect the verdict.\n\n\"Was it fair, mother, to say that I could stay out till six, and then\npretend it was six before it was quite six?\"\n\n\"No, it was very unfair. I thought--\"\n\n\"Would it have been a lie if I had said it was quite six?\"\n\n\"Oh, my son, my son! I shall never tell you a lie again.\"\n\n\"No, mother, please don't.\"\n\n\"My boy, have I done well to-day on the whole?\"\n\nSuppose he were unable to say yes.\n\nThese are the merest peccadilloes, you may say. Is it then a little\nthing to be false to the agreement you signed when you got the boy?\nThere are mothers who avoid their children in that hour, but this will\nnot save them. Why is it that so many women are afraid to be left alone\nwith their thoughts between six and seven? I am not asking this of\nyou, Mary. I believe that when you close David's door softly there is a\ngladness in your eyes, and the awe of one who knows that the God to whom\nlittle boys say their prayers has a face very like their mother's.\n\nI may mention here that David is a stout believer in prayer, and has had\nhis first fight with another young Christian who challenged him to the\njump and prayed for victory, which David thought was taking an unfair\nadvantage.\n\n\"So Mary is twenty-six! I say, David, she is getting on. Tell her that I\nam coming in to kiss her when she is fifty-two.\"\n\nHe told her, and I understand that she pretended to be indignant. When I\npass her in the street now she pouts. Clearly preparing for our meeting.\nShe has also said, I learn, that I shall not think so much of her when\nshe is fifty-two, meaning that she will not be so pretty then. So little\ndoes the sex know of beauty. Surely a spirited old lady may be the\nprettiest sight in the world. For my part, I confess that it is they,\nand not the young ones, who have ever been my undoing. Just as I was\nabout to fall in love I suddenly found that I preferred the mother.\nIndeed, I cannot see a likely young creature without impatiently\nconsidering her chances for, say, fifty-two. Oh, you mysterious girls,\nwhen you are fifty-two we shall find you out; you must come into the\nopen then. If the mouth has fallen sourly yours the blame: all the\nmeannesses your youth concealed have been gathering in your face. But\nthe pretty thoughts and sweet ways and dear, forgotten kindnesses linger\nthere also, to bloom in your twilight like evening primroses.\n\nIs it not strange that, though I talk thus plainly to David about his\nmother, he still seems to think me fond of her? How now, I reflect, what\nsort of bumpkin is this, and perhaps I say to him cruelly: \"Boy, you are\nuncommonly like your mother.\"\n\nTo which David: \"Is that why you are so kind to me?\"\n\nI suppose I am kind to him, but if so it is not for love of his mother,\nbut because he sometimes calls me father. On my honour as a soldier,\nthere is nothing more in it than that. I must not let him know this, for\nit would make him conscious, and so break the spell that binds him and\nme together. Oftenest I am but Captain W---- to him, and for the best of\nreasons. He addresses me as father when he is in a hurry only, and never\nhave I dared ask him to use the name. He says, \"Come, father,\" with an\naccursed beautiful carelessness. So let it be, David, for a little while\nlonger.\n\nI like to hear him say it before others, as in shops. When in shops he\nasks the salesman how much money he makes in a day, and which drawer he\nkeeps it in, and why his hair is red, and does he like Achilles, of whom\nDavid has lately heard, and is so enamoured that he wants to die to meet\nhim. At such times the shopkeepers accept me as his father, and I cannot\nexplain the peculiar pleasure this gives me. I am always in two minds\nthen, to linger that we may have more of it, and to snatch him away\nbefore he volunteers the information, \"He is not really my father.\"\n\nWhen David meets Achilles I know what will happen. The little boy will\ntake the hero by the hand, call him father, and drag him away to some\nRound Pond.\n\nOne day, when David was about five, I sent him the following letter:\n\"Dear David: If you really want to know how it began, will you come and\nhave a chop with me to-day at the club?\"\n\nMary, who, I have found out, opens all his letters, gave her consent,\nand, I doubt not, instructed him to pay heed to what happened so that he\nmight repeat it to her, for despite her curiosity she knows not how\nit began herself. I chuckled, guessing that she expected something\nromantic.\n\nHe came to me arrayed as for a mighty journey, and looking unusually\nsolemn, as little boys always do look when they are wearing a great\ncoat. There was a shawl round his neck. \"You can take some of them off,\"\nI said, \"when we come to summer.\"\n\n\"Shall we come to summer?\" he asked, properly awed.\n\n\"To many summers,\" I replied, \"for we are going away back, David, to see\nyour mother as she was in the days before there was you.\"\n\nWe hailed a hansom. \"Drive back six years,\" I said to the cabby, \"and\nstop at the Junior Old Fogies' Club.\"\n\nHe was a stupid fellow, and I had to guide him with my umbrella.\n\nThe streets were not quite as they had been in the morning. For\ninstance, the bookshop at the corner was now selling fish. I dropped\nDavid a hint of what was going on.\n\n\"It doesn't make me littler, does it?\" he asked anxiously; and then,\nwith a terrible misgiving: \"It won't make me too little, will it,\nfather?\" by which he meant that he hoped it would not do for him\naltogether. He slipped his hand nervously into mine, and I put it in my\npocket.\n\nYou can't think how little David looked as we entered the portals of the\nclub.\n\n\n\n\nII. The Little Nursery Governess\n\nAs I enter the club smoking-room you are to conceive David vanishing\ninto nothingness, and that it is any day six years ago at two in the\nafternoon. I ring for coffee, cigarette, and cherry brandy, and take my\nchair by the window, just as the absurd little nursery governess comes\ntripping into the street. I always feel that I have rung for her.\n\nWhile I am lifting the coffee-pot cautiously lest the lid fall into the\ncup, she is crossing to the post-office; as I select the one suitable\nlump of sugar she is taking six last looks at the letter; with the aid\nof William I light my cigarette, and now she is re-reading the delicious\naddress. I lie back in my chair, and by this time she has dropped the\nletter down the slit. I toy with my liqueur, and she is listening to\nhear whether the postal authorities have come for her letter. I scowl at\na fellow-member who has had the impudence to enter the smoking-room, and\nher two little charges are pulling her away from the post-office. When\nI look out at the window again she is gone, but I shall ring for her\nto-morrow at two sharp.\n\nShe must have passed the window many times before I noticed her. I know\nnot where she lives, though I suppose it to be hard by. She is taking\nthe little boy and girl, who bully her, to the St. James's Park, as\ntheir hoops tell me, and she ought to look crushed and faded. No doubt\nher mistress overworks her. It must enrage the other servants to see her\ndeporting herself as if she were quite the lady.\n\nI noticed that she had sometimes other letters to post, but that\nthe posting of the one only was a process. They shot down the slit,\nplebeians all, but it followed pompously like royalty. I have even seen\nher blow a kiss after it.\n\nThen there was her ring, of which she was as conscious as if it rather\nthan she was what came gaily down the street. She felt it through her\nglove to make sure that it was still there. She took off the glove and\nraised the ring to her lips, though I doubt not it was the cheapest\ntrinket. She viewed it from afar by stretching out her hand; she stooped\nto see how it looked near the ground; she considered its effect on the\nright of her and on the left of her and through one eye at a time. Even\nwhen you saw that she had made up her mind to think hard of something\nelse, the little silly would take another look.\n\nI give anyone three chances to guess why Mary was so happy.\n\nNo and no and no. The reason was simply this, that a lout of a young man\nloved her. And so, instead of crying because she was the merest nobody,\nshe must, forsooth, sail jauntily down Pall Mall, very trim as to her\ntackle and ticketed with the insufferable air of an engaged woman. At\nfirst her complacency disturbed me, but gradually it became part of my\nlife at two o'clock with the coffee, the cigarette, and the liqueur. Now\ncomes the tragedy.\n\nThursday is her great day. She has from two to three every Thursday for\nher very own; just think of it: this girl, who is probably paid several\npounds a year, gets a whole hour to herself once a week. And what does\nshe with it? Attend classes for making her a more accomplished person?\nNot she. This is what she does: sets sail for Pall Mall, wearing all her\npretty things, including the blue feathers, and with such a sparkle\nof expectation on her face that I stir my coffee quite fiercely. On\nordinary days she at least tries to look demure, but on a Thursday she\nhas had the assurance to use the glass door of the club as a mirror in\nwhich to see how she likes her engaging trifle of a figure to-day.\n\nIn the meantime a long-legged oaf is waiting for her outside the\npost-office, where they meet every Thursday, a fellow who always wears\nthe same suit of clothes, but has a face that must ever make him free of\nthe company of gentlemen. He is one of your lean, clean Englishmen,\nwho strip so well, and I fear me he is handsome; I say fear, for your\nhandsome men have always annoyed me, and had I lived in the duelling\ndays I swear I would have called every one of them out. He seems to be\nquite unaware that he is a pretty fellow, but Lord, how obviously Mary\nknows it. I conclude that he belongs to the artistic classes, he is\nso easily elated and depressed; and because he carries his left thumb\ncuriously, as if it were feeling for the hole of a palette, I have\nentered his name among the painters. I find pleasure in deciding that\nthey are shocking bad pictures, for obviously no one buys them. I feel\nsure Mary says they are splendid, she is that sort of woman. Hence the\nrapture with which he greets her. Her first effect upon him is to make\nhim shout with laughter. He laughs suddenly haw from an eager exulting\nface, then haw again, and then, when you are thanking heaven that it is\nat last over, comes a final haw, louder than the others. I take them to\nbe roars of joy because Mary is his, and they have a ring of youth\nabout them that is hard to bear. I could forgive him everything save his\nyouth, but it is so aggressive that I have sometimes to order William\ntestily to close the window.\n\nHow much more deceitful than her lover is the little nursery governess.\nThe moment she comes into sight she looks at the post-office and sees\nhim. Then she looks straight before her, and now she is observed, and he\nrushes across to her in a glory, and she starts--positively starts--as\nif he had taken her by surprise. Observe her hand rising suddenly to her\nwicked little heart. This is the moment when I stir my coffee violently.\nHe gazes down at her in such rapture that he is in everybody's way, and\nas she takes his arm she gives it a little squeeze, and then away they\nstrut, Mary doing nine-tenths of the talking. I fall to wondering what\nthey will look like when they grow up.\n\nWhat a ludicrous difference do these two nobodies make to each other.\nYou can see that they are to be married when he has twopence.\n\nThus I have not an atom of sympathy with this girl, to whom London is\nfamous only as the residence of a young man who mistakes her for someone\nelse, but her happiness had become part of my repast at two P.M., and\nwhen one day she walked down Pall Mall without gradually posting a\nletter I was most indignant. It was as if William had disobeyed orders.\nHer two charges were as surprised as I, and pointed questioningly to\nthe slit, at which she shook her head. She put her finger to her eyes,\nexactly like a sad baby, and so passed from the street.\n\nNext day the same thing happened, and I was so furious that I bit\nthrough my cigarette. Thursday came, when I prayed that there might\nbe an end of this annoyance, but no, neither of them appeared on that\nacquainted ground. Had they changed their post-office? No, for her eyes\nwere red every day, and heavy was her foolish little heart. Love had put\nout his lights, and the little nursery governess walked in darkness.\n\nI felt I could complain to the committee.\n\nOh, you selfish young zany of a man, after all you have said to her,\nwon't you make it up and let me return to my coffee? Not he.\n\nLittle nursery governess, I appeal to you. Annoying girl, be joyous as\nof old during the five minutes of the day when you are anything to me,\nand for the rest of the time, so far as I am concerned, you may be as\nwretched as you list. Show some courage. I assure you he must be a very\nbad painter; only the other day I saw him looking longingly into the\nwindow of a cheap Italian restaurant, and in the end he had to crush\ndown his aspirations with two penny scones.\n\nYou can do better than that. Come, Mary.\n\nAll in vain. She wants to be loved; can't do without love from morning\ntill night; never knew how little a woman needs till she lost that\nlittle. They are all like this.\n\nZounds, madam, if you are resolved to be a drooping little figure till\nyou die, you might at least do it in another street.\n\nNot only does she maliciously depress me by walking past on ordinary\ndays, but I have discovered that every Thursday from two to three she\nstands afar off, gazing hopelessly at the romantic post-office where she\nand he shall meet no more. In these windy days she is like a homeless\nleaf blown about by passers-by.\n\nThere is nothing I can do except thunder at William.\n\nAt last she accomplished her unworthy ambition. It was a wet Thursday,\nand from the window where I was writing letters I saw the forlorn soul\ntaking up her position at the top of the street: in a blast of fury I\nrose with the one letter I had completed, meaning to write the others in\nmy chambers. She had driven me from the club.\n\nI had turned out of Pall Mall into a side street, when whom should I\nstrike against but her false swain! It was my fault, but I hit out at\nhim savagely, as I always do when I run into anyone in the street. Then\nI looked at him. He was hollow-eyed; he was muddy; there was not a haw\nleft in him. I never saw a more abject young man; he had not even the\nspirit to resent the testy stab I had given him with my umbrella. But\nthis is the important thing: he was glaring wistfully at the post-office\nand thus in a twink I saw that he still adored my little governess.\nWhatever had been their quarrel he was as anxious to make it up as she,\nand perhaps he had been here every Thursday while she was round the\ncorner in Pall Mall, each watching the post-office for an apparition.\nBut from where they hovered neither could see the other.\n\nI think what I did was quite clever. I dropped my letter unseen at his\nfeet, and sauntered back to the club. Of course, a gentleman who finds\na letter on the pavement feels bound to post it, and I presumed that he\nwould naturally go to the nearest office.\n\nWith my hat on I strolled to the smoking-room window, and was just in\ntime to see him posting my letter across the way. Then I looked for\nthe little nursery governess. I saw her as woe-begone as ever; then,\nsuddenly--oh, you poor little soul, and has it really been as bad as\nthat!\n\nShe was crying outright, and he was holding both her hands. It was a\ndisgraceful exhibition. The young painter would evidently explode if he\ncould not make use of his arms. She must die if she could not lay her\nhead upon his breast. I must admit that he rose to the occasion; he\nhailed a hansom.\n\n\"William,\" said I gaily, \"coffee, cigarette, and cherry brandy.\"\n\n\nAs I sat there watching that old play David plucked my sleeve to ask\nwhat I was looking at so deedily; and when I told him he ran eagerly to\nthe window, but he reached it just too late to see the lady who was to\nbecome his mother. What I told him of her doings, however, interested\nhim greatly; and he intimated rather shyly that he was acquainted with\nthe man who said, \"Haw-haw-haw.\" On the other hand, he irritated me by\nbetraying an idiotic interest in the two children, whom he seemed to\nregard as the hero and heroine of the story. What were their names? How\nold were they? Had they both hoops? Were they iron hoops, or just wooden\nhoops? Who gave them their hoops?\n\n\"You don't seem to understand, my boy,\" I said tartly, \"that had I not\ndropped that letter, there would never have been a little boy called\nDavid A----.\" But instead of being appalled by this he asked, sparkling,\nwhether I meant that he would still be a bird flying about in the\nKensington Gardens.\n\nDavid knows that all children in our part of London were once birds in\nthe Kensington Gardens; and that the reason there are bars on nursery\nwindows and a tall fender by the fire is because very little people\nsometimes forget that they have no longer wings, and try to fly away\nthrough the window or up the chimney.\n\nChildren in the bird stage are difficult to catch. David knows that many\npeople have none, and his delight on a summer afternoon is to go with me\nto some spot in the Gardens where these unfortunates may be seen trying\nto catch one with small pieces of cake.\n\nThat the birds know what would happen if they were caught, and are even\na little undecided about which is the better life, is obvious to every\nstudent of them. Thus, if you leave your empty perambulator under the\ntrees and watch from a distance, you will see the birds boarding it and\nhopping about from pillow to blanket in a twitter of excitement; they\nare trying to find out how babyhood would suit them.\n\nQuite the prettiest sight in the Gardens is when the babies stray from\nthe tree where the nurse is sitting and are seen feeding the birds, not\na grownup near them. It is first a bit to me and then a bit to you,\nand all the time such a jabbering and laughing from both sides of the\nrailing. They are comparing notes and inquiring for old friends, and so\non; but what they say I cannot determine, for when I approach they all\nfly away.\n\nThe first time I ever saw David was on the sward behind the Baby's Walk.\nHe was a missel-thrush, attracted thither that hot day by a hose which\nlay on the ground sending forth a gay trickle of water, and David was on\nhis back in the water, kicking up his legs. He used to enjoy being told\nof this, having forgotten all about it, and gradually it all came back\nto him, with a number of other incidents that had escaped my memory,\nthough I remember that he was eventually caught by the leg with a long\nstring and a cunning arrangement of twigs near the Round Pond. He never\ntires of this story, but I notice that it is now he who tells it to me\nrather than I to him, and when we come to the string he rubs his little\nleg as if it still smarted.\n\nSo when David saw his chance of being a missel-thrush again he called\nout to me quickly: \"Don't drop the letter!\" and there were tree-tops in\nhis eyes.\n\n\"Think of your mother,\" I said severely.\n\nHe said he would often fly in to see her. The first thing he would do\nwould be to hug her. No, he would alight on the water-jug first, and\nhave a drink.\n\n\"Tell her, father,\" he said with horrid heartlessness, \"always to have\nplenty of water in it, 'cos if I had to lean down too far I might fall\nin and be drownded.\"\n\n\"Am I not to drop the letter, David? Think of your poor mother without\nher boy!\"\n\nIt affected him, but he bore up. When she was asleep, he said, he would\nhop on to the frilly things of her night-gown and peck at her mouth.\n\n\"And then she would wake up, David, and find that she had only a bird\ninstead of a boy.\"\n\nThis shock to Mary was more than he could endure. \"You can drop it,\"\nhe said with a sigh. So I dropped the letter, as I think I have already\nmentioned; and that is how it all began.\n\n\n\n\nIII. Her Marriage, Her Clothes, Her Appetite, and an Inventory of Her\nFurniture\n\nA week or two after I dropped the letter I was in a hansom on my way to\ncertain barracks when loud above the city's roar I heard that accursed\nhaw-haw-haw, and there they were, the two of them, just coming out of\na shop where you may obtain pianos on the hire system. I had the merest\nglimpse of them, but there was an extraordinary rapture on her face, and\nhis head was thrown proudly back, and all because they had been ordering\na piano on the hire system.\n\nSo they were to be married directly. It was all rather contemptible,\nbut I passed on tolerantly, for it is only when she is unhappy that\nthis woman disturbs me, owing to a clever way she has at such times of\nlooking more fragile than she really is.\n\nWhen next I saw them, they were gazing greedily into the window of the\nsixpenny-halfpenny shop, which is one of the most deliciously dramatic\nspots in London. Mary was taking notes feverishly on a slip of paper\nwhile he did the adding up, and in the end they went away gloomily\nwithout buying anything. I was in high feather. \"Match abandoned,\nma'am,\" I said to myself; \"outlook hopeless; another visit to the\nGovernesses' Agency inevitable; can't marry for want of a kitchen\nshovel.\" But I was imperfectly acquainted with the lady.\n\nA few days afterward I found myself walking behind her. There is\nsomething artful about her skirts by which I always know her, though\nI can't say what it is. She was carrying an enormous parcel that might\nhave been a bird-cage wrapped in brown paper, and she took it into\na bric-a-brac shop and came out without it. She then ran rather than\nwalked in the direction of the sixpenny-halfpenny shop. Now mystery\nof any kind is detestable to me, and I went into the bric-a-brac\nshop, ostensibly to look at the cracked china; and there, still on the\ncounter, with the wrapping torn off it, was the article Mary had sold\nin order to furnish on the proceeds. What do you think it was? It was a\nwonderful doll's house, with dolls at tea downstairs and dolls going to\nbed upstairs, and a doll showing a doll out at the front door. Loving\nlips had long ago licked most of the paint off, but otherwise the thing\nwas in admirable preservation; obviously the joy of Mary's childhood, it\nhad now been sold by her that she might get married.\n\n\"Lately purchased by us,\" said the shopwoman, seeing me look at the toy,\n\"from a lady who has no further use for it.\"\n\nI think I have seldom been more indignant with Mary. I bought the doll's\nhouse, and as they knew the lady's address (it was at this shop that I\nfirst learned her name) I instructed them to send it back to her with\nthe following letter, which I wrote in the shop: \"Dear madam, don't be\nridiculous. You will certainly have further use for this. I am, etc.,\nthe Man Who Dropped the Letter.\"\n\nIt pained me afterward, but too late to rescind the order, to reflect\nthat I had sent her a wedding present; and when next I saw her she had\nbeen married for some months. The time was nine o'clock of a November\nevening, and we were in a street of shops that has not in twenty years\ndecided whether to be genteel or frankly vulgar; here it minces in the\nfashion, but take a step onward and its tongue is in the cup of the\nice-cream man. I usually rush this street, which is not far from my\nrooms, with the glass down, but to-night I was walking. Mary was in\nfront of me, leaning in a somewhat foolish way on the haw-er, and they\nwere chatting excitedly. She seemed to be remonstrating with him for\ngoing forward, yet more than half admiring him for not turning back, and\nI wondered why.\n\nAnd after all what was it that Mary and her painter had come out to do?\nTo buy two pork chops. On my honour. She had been trying to persuade\nhim, I decided, that they were living too lavishly. That was why she\nsought to draw him back. But in her heart she loves audacity, and that\nis why she admired him for pressing forward.\n\nNo sooner had they bought the chops than they scurried away like two\ngleeful children to cook them. I followed, hoping to trace them to their\nhome, but they soon out-distanced me, and that night I composed the\nfollowing aphorism: It is idle to attempt to overtake a pretty young\nwoman carrying pork chops. I was now determined to be done with her.\nFirst, however, to find out their abode, which was probably within easy\ndistance of the shop. I even conceived them lured into taking their\nhouse by the advertisement, \"Conveniently situated for the Pork\nEmporium.\"\n\nWell, one day--now this really is romantic and I am rather proud of\nit. My chambers are on the second floor, and are backed by an anxiously\npolite street between which and mine are little yards called, I think,\ngardens. They are so small that if you have the tree your neighbour has\nthe shade from it. I was looking out at my back window on the day\nwe have come to when whom did I see but the whilom nursery governess\nsitting on a chair in one of these gardens. I put up my eye-glass to\nmake sure, and undoubtedly it was she. But she sat there doing nothing,\nwhich was by no means my conception of the jade, so I brought a\nfieldglass to bear and discovered that the object was merely a lady's\njacket. It hung on the back of a kitchen chair, seemed to be a furry\nthing, and, I must suppose, was suspended there for an airing.\n\nI was chagrined, and then I insisted stoutly with myself that, as it\nwas not Mary, it must be Mary's jacket. I had never seen her wear such\na jacket, mind you, yet I was confident, I can't tell why. Do clothes\nabsorb a little of the character of their wearer, so that I recognised\nthis jacket by a certain coquetry? If she has a way with her skirts that\nalways advertises me of her presence, quite possibly she is as cunning\nwith jackets. Or perhaps she is her own seamstress, and puts in little\ntucks of herself.\n\nFigure it what you please; but I beg to inform you that I put on my\nhat and five minutes afterward saw Mary and her husband emerge from the\nhouse to which I had calculated that garden belonged. Now am I clever,\nor am I not?\n\nWhen they had left the street I examined the house leisurely, and a\ndroll house it is. Seen from the front it appears to consist of a door\nand a window, though above them the trained eye may detect another\nwindow, the air-hole of some apartment which it would be just like\nMary's grandiloquence to call her bedroom. The houses on each side of\nthis bandbox are tall, and I discovered later that it had once been\nan open passage to the back gardens. The story and a half of which it\nconsists had been knocked up cheaply, by carpenters I should say rather\nthan masons, and the general effect is of a brightly coloured van that\nhas stuck for ever on its way through the passage.\n\nThe low houses of London look so much more homely than the tall ones\nthat I never pass them without dropping a blessing on their builders,\nbut this house was ridiculous; indeed it did not call itself a house,\nfor over the door was a board with the inscription \"This space to be\nsold,\" and I remembered, as I rang the bell, that this notice had been\nup for years. On avowing that I wanted a space, I was admitted by an\nelderly, somewhat dejected looking female, whose fine figure was not\non scale with her surroundings. Perhaps my face said so, for her first\nremark was explanatory.\n\n\"They get me cheap,\" she said, \"because I drink.\"\n\nI bowed, and we passed on to the drawing-room. I forget whether I have\ndescribed Mary's personal appearance, but if so you have a picture of\nthat sunny drawing-room. My first reflection was, How can she have found\nthe money to pay for it all! which is always your first reflection when\nyou see Mary herself a-tripping down the street.\n\nI have no space (in that little room) to catalogue all the whim-whams\nwith which she had made it beautiful, from the hand-sewn bell-rope which\npulled no bell to the hand-painted cigar-box that contained no cigars.\nThe floor was of a delicious green with exquisite oriental rugs; green\nand white, I think, was the lady's scheme of colour, something cool, you\nobserve, to keep the sun under. The window-curtains were of some rare\nmaterial and the colour of the purple clematis; they swept the floor\ngrandly and suggested a picture of Mary receiving visitors. The piano\nwe may ignore, for I knew it to be hired, but there were many dainty\npieces, mostly in green wood, a sofa, a corner cupboard, and a most\ncaptivating desk, which was so like its owner that it could have sat\ndown at her and dashed off a note. The writing paper on this desk had\nthe word Mary printed on it, implying that if there were other Marys\nthey didn't count. There were many oil-paintings on the walls, mostly\nwithout frames, and I must mention the chandelier, which was obviously\nof fabulous worth, for she had encased it in a holland bag.\n\n\"I perceive, ma'am,\" said I to the stout maid, \"that your master is in\naffluent circumstances.\"\n\nShe shook her head emphatically, and said something that I failed to\ncatch.\n\n\"You wish to indicate,\" I hazarded, \"that he married a fortune.\"\n\nThis time I caught the words. They were \"Tinned meats,\" and having\nuttered them she lapsed into gloomy silence.\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" I said, \"this room must have cost a pretty penny.\"\n\n\"She done it all herself,\" replied my new friend, with concentrated\nscorn.\n\n\"But this green floor, so beautifully stained--\"\n\n\"Boiling oil,\" said she, with a flush of honest shame, \"and a\nshillingsworth o' paint.\"\n\n\"Those rugs--\"\n\n\"Remnants,\" she sighed, and showed me how artfully they had been pieced\ntogether.\n\n\"The curtains--\"\n\n\"Remnants.\"\n\n\"At all events the sofa--\"\n\nShe raised its drapery, and I saw that the sofa was built of packing\ncases.\n\n\"The desk--\"\n\nI really thought that I was safe this time, for could I not see the\ndrawers with their brass handles, the charming shelf for books, the\npigeon-holes with their coverings of silk?\n\n\"She made it out of three orange boxes,\" said the lady, at last a little\nawed herself.\n\nI looked around me despairingly, and my eye alighted on the holland\ncovering. \"There is a fine chandelier in that holland bag,\" I said\ncoaxingly.\n\nShe sniffed and was raising an untender hand, when I checked her.\n\"Forbear, ma'am,\" I cried with authority, \"I prefer to believe in that\nbag. How much to be pitied, ma'am, are those who have lost faith in\neverything.\" I think all the pretty things that the little nursery\ngoverness had made out of nothing squeezed my hand for letting the\nchandelier off.\n\n\"But, good God, ma'am,\" said I to madam, \"what an exposure.\"\n\nShe intimated that there were other exposures upstairs.\n\n\"So there is a stair,\" said I, and then, suspiciously, \"did she make\nit?\"\n\nNo, but how she had altered it.\n\nThe stair led to Mary's bedroom, and I said I would not look at that,\nnor at the studio, which was a shed in the garden.\n\n\"Did she build the studio with her own hands?\"\n\nNo, but how she had altered it.\n\n\"How she alters everything,\" I said. \"Do you think you are safe, ma'am?\"\n\nShe thawed a little under my obvious sympathy and honoured me with some\nof her views and confidences. The rental paid by Mary and her husband\nwas not, it appeared, one on which any self-respecting domestic could\nreflect with pride. They got the house very cheap on the understanding\nthat they were to vacate it promptly if anyone bought it for building\npurposes, and because they paid so little they had to submit to the\nindignity of the notice-board. Mary A---- detested the words \"This space\nto be sold,\" and had been known to shake her fist at them. She was as\nelated about her house as if it were a real house, and always trembled\nwhen any possible purchaser of spaces called.\n\nAs I have told you my own aphorism I feel I ought in fairness to record\nthat of this aggrieved servant. It was on the subject of art. \"The\ndifficulty,\" she said, \"is not to paint pictures, but to get frames for\nthem.\" A home thrust this.\n\nShe could not honestly say that she thought much of her master's work.\nNor, apparently, did any other person. Result, tinned meats.\n\nYes, one person thought a deal of it, or pretended to do so; was\nconstantly flinging up her hands in delight over it; had even been\ncaught whispering fiercely to a friend, \"Praise it, praise it, praise\nit!\" This was when the painter was sunk in gloom. Never, as I could well\nbelieve, was such a one as Mary for luring a man back to cheerfulness.\n\n\"A dangerous woman,\" I said, with a shudder, and fell to examining a\npainting over the mantel-shelf. It was a portrait of a man, and had\nimpressed me favourably because it was framed.\n\n\"A friend of hers,\" my guide informed me, \"but I never seed him.\"\n\nI would have turned away from it, had not an inscription on the picture\ndrawn me nearer. It was in a lady's handwriting, and these were the\nwords: \"Fancy portrait of our dear unknown.\" Could it be meant for me? I\ncannot tell you how interested I suddenly became.\n\nIt represented a very fine looking fellow, indeed, and not a day more\nthan thirty.\n\n\"A friend of hers, ma'am, did you say?\" I asked quite shakily. \"How do\nyou know that, if you have never seen him?\"\n\n\"When master was painting of it,\" she said, \"in the studio, he used to\ncome running in here to say to her such like as, 'What colour would you\nmake his eyes?'\"\n\n\"And her reply, ma'am?\" I asked eagerly.\n\n\"She said, 'Beautiful blue eyes.' And he said, 'You wouldn't make it\na handsome face, would you?' and she says, 'A very handsome face.' And\nsays he, 'Middle-aged?' and says she, 'Twenty-nine.' And I mind him\nsaying, 'A little bald on the top?' and she says, says she, 'Not at\nall.'\"\n\nThe dear, grateful girl, not to make me bald on the top.\n\n\"I have seed her kiss her hand to that picture,\" said the maid.\n\nFancy Mary kissing her hand to me! Oh, the pretty love!\n\nPooh!\n\nI was staring at the picture, cogitating what insulting message I could\nwrite on it, when I heard the woman's voice again. \"I think she has\nknown him since she were a babby,\" she was saying, \"for this here was a\npresent he give her.\"\n\nShe was on her knees drawing the doll's house from beneath the sofa,\nwhere it had been hidden away; and immediately I thought, \"I shall slip\nthe insulting message into this.\" But I did not, and I shall tell you\nwhy. It was because the engaging toy had been redecorated by loving\nhands; there were fresh gowns for all the inhabitants, and the paint on\nthe furniture was scarcely dry. The little doll's house was almost ready\nfor further use.\n\nI looked at the maid, but her face was expressionless. \"Put it back,\"\nI said, ashamed to have surprised Mary's pretty secret, and I left the\nhouse dejectedly, with a profound conviction that the little nursery\ngoverness had hooked on to me again.\n\n\n\n\nIV. A Night-Piece\n\nThere came a night when the husband was alone in that street waiting. He\ncan do nothing for you now, little nursery governess, you must fight it\nout by yourself; when there are great things to do in the house the man\nmust leave. Oh, man, selfish, indelicate, coarse-grained at the best,\nthy woman's hour has come; get thee gone.\n\nHe slouches from the house, always her true lover I do believe,\nchivalrous, brave, a boy until to-night; but was he ever unkind to her?\nIt is the unpardonable sin now; is there the memory of an unkindness\nto stalk the street with him to-night? And if not an unkindness, still\nmight he not sometimes have been a little kinder?\n\nShall we make a new rule of life from tonight: always to try to be a\nlittle kinder than is necessary?\n\nPoor youth, she would come to the window if she were able, I am sure,\nto sign that the one little unkindness is long forgotten, to send you\na reassuring smile till you and she meet again; and, if you are not to\nmeet again, still to send you a reassuring, trembling smile.\n\nAh, no, that was for yesterday; it is too late now. He wanders the\nstreets thinking of her tonight, but she has forgotten him. In her great\nhour the man is nothing to the woman; their love is trivial now.\n\nHe and I were on opposite sides of the street, now become familiar\nground to both of us, and divers pictures rose before me in which Mary\nA---- walked. Here was the morning after my only entry into her house.\nThe agent had promised me to have the obnoxious notice-board removed,\nbut I apprehended that as soon as the letter announcing his intention\nreached her she would remove it herself, and when I passed by in the\nmorning there she was on a chair and a foot-stool pounding lustily at it\nwith a hammer. When it fell she gave it such a vicious little kick.\n\nThere were the nights when her husband came out to watch for the\npostman. I suppose he was awaiting some letter big with the fate of a\npicture. He dogged the postman from door to door like an assassin or a\nguardian angel; never had he the courage to ask if there was a letter\nfor him, but almost as it fell into the box he had it out and tore it\nopen, and then if the door closed despairingly the woman who had been at\nthe window all this time pressed her hand to her heart. But if the news\nwas good they might emerge presently and strut off arm in arm in the\ndirection of the pork emporium.\n\nOne last picture. On summer evenings I had caught glimpses of them\nthrough the open window, when she sat at the piano singing and playing\nto him. Or while she played with one hand, she flung out the other for\nhim to grasp. She was so joyously happy, and she had such a romantic\nmind. I conceived her so sympathetic that she always laughed before he\ncame to the joke, and I am sure she had filmy eyes from the very start\nof a pathetic story.\n\nAnd so, laughing and crying, and haunted by whispers, the little nursery\ngoverness had gradually become another woman, glorified, mysterious. I\nsuppose a man soon becomes used to the great change, and cannot recall a\ntime when there were no babes sprawling in his Mary's face.\n\nI am trying to conceive what were the thoughts of the young husband on\nthe other side of the street. \"If the barrier is to be crossed to-night\nmay I not go with her? She is not so brave as you think her. When she\ntalked so gaily a few hours ago, O my God, did she deceive even you?\"\n\nPlain questions to-night. \"Why should it all fall on her? What is the\nman that he should be flung out into the street in this terrible hour?\nYou have not been fair to the man.\"\n\nPoor boy, his wife has quite forgotten him and his trumpery love. If she\nlives she will come back to him, but if she dies she will die triumphant\nand serene. Life and death, the child and the mother, are ever meeting\nas the one draws into harbour and the other sets sail. They exchange a\nbright \"All's well\" and pass on.\n\nBut afterward?\n\nThe only ghosts, I believe, who creep into this world, are dead young\nmothers, returned to see how their children fare. There is no other\ninducement great enough to bring the departed back. They glide into the\nacquainted room when day and night, their jailers, are in the grip, and\nwhisper, \"How is it with you, my child?\" but always, lest a strange face\nshould frighten him, they whisper it so low that he may not hear. They\nbend over him to see that he sleeps peacefully, and replace his sweet\narm beneath the coverlet, and they open the drawers to count how many\nlittle vests he has. They love to do these things.\n\nWhat is saddest about ghosts is that they may not know their child. They\nexpect him to be just as he was when they left him, and they are easily\nbewildered, and search for him from room to room, and hate the unknown\nboy he has become. Poor, passionate souls, they may even do him an\ninjury. These are the ghosts that go wailing about old houses, and\nfoolish wild stories are invented to explain what is all so pathetic and\nsimple. I know of a man who, after wandering far, returned to his early\nhome to pass the evening of his days in it, and sometimes from his chair\nby the fire he saw the door open softly and a woman's face appear.\nShe always looked at him very vindictively, and then vanished. Strange\nthings happened in this house. Windows were opened in the night. The\ncurtains of his bed were set fire to. A step on the stair was loosened.\nThe covering of an old well in a corridor where he walked was cunningly\nremoved. And when he fell ill the wrong potion was put in the glass by\nhis bedside, and he died. How could the pretty young mother know that\nthis grizzled interloper was the child of whom she was in search?\n\nAll our notions about ghosts are wrong. It is nothing so petty as lost\nwills or deeds of violence that brings them back, and we are not nearly\nso afraid of them as they are of us.\n\nOne by one the lights of the street went out, but still a lamp burned\nsteadily in the little window across the way. I know not how it\nhappened, whether I had crossed first to him or he to me, but, after\nbeing for a long time as the echo of each other's steps, we were\ntogether now. I can have had no desire to deceive him, but some reason\nwas needed to account for my vigil, and I may have said something that\nhe misconstrued, for above my words he was always listening for other\nsounds. But however it came about he had conceived the idea that I was\nan outcast for a reason similar to his own, and I let his mistake pass,\nit seemed to matter so little and to draw us together so naturally.\nWe talked together of many things, such as worldly ambition. For long\nambition has been like an ancient memory to me, some glorious day\nrecalled from my springtime, so much a thing of the past that I must\nmake a railway journey to revisit it as to look upon the pleasant fields\nin which that scene was laid. But he had been ambitious yesterday.\n\nI mentioned worldly ambition. \"Good God!\" he said with a shudder.\n\nThere was a clock hard by that struck the quarters, and one o'clock\npassed and two. What time is it now? Twenty past two. And now? It is\nstill twenty past two.\n\nI asked him about his relatives, and neither he nor she had any. \"We\nhave a friend--\" he began and paused, and then rambled into a not very\nunderstandable story about a letter and a doll's house and some unknown\nman who had bought one of his pictures, or was supposed to have done so,\nin a curiously clandestine manner. I could not quite follow the story.\n\n\"It is she who insists that it is always the same person,\" he said. \"She\nthinks he will make himself known to me if anything happens to her.\" His\nvoice suddenly went husky. \"She told me,\" he said, \"if she died and I\ndiscovered him, to give him her love.\"\n\nAt this we parted abruptly, as we did at intervals throughout the night,\nto drift together again presently. He tried to tell me of some things\nshe had asked him to do should she not get over this, but what they were\nI know not, for they engulfed him at the first step. He would draw back\nfrom them as ill-omened things, and next moment he was going over them\nto himself like a child at lessons. A child! In that short year she had\nmade him entirely dependent on her. It is ever thus with women: their\nfirst deliberate act is to make their husband helpless. There are few\nmen happily married who can knock in a nail.\n\nBut it was not of this that I was thinking. I was wishing I had not\ndegenerated so much.\n\nWell, as you know, the little nursery governess did not die. At eighteen\nminutes to four we heard the rustle of David's wings. He boasts about\nit to this day, and has the hour to a syllable as if the first thing he\never did was to look at the clock.\n\nAn oldish gentleman had opened the door and waved congratulations to\nmy companion, who immediately butted at me, drove me against a wall,\nhesitated for a second with his head down as if in doubt whether to toss\nme, and then rushed away. I followed slowly. I shook him by the hand,\nbut by this time he was haw-haw-hawing so abominably that a disgust of\nhim swelled up within me, and with it a passionate desire to jeer once\nmore at Mary A--\n\n\"It is little she will care for you now,\" I said to the fellow; \"I\nknow the sort of woman; her intellectuals (which are all she has to\ndistinguish her from the brutes) are so imperfectly developed that she\nwill be a crazy thing about that boy for the next three years. She has\nno longer occasion for you, my dear sir; you are like a picture painted\nout.\"\n\nBut I question whether he heard me. I returned to my home. Home! As if\none alone can build a nest. How often as I have ascended the stairs\nthat lead to my lonely, sumptuous rooms, have I paused to listen to\nthe hilarity of the servants below. That morning I could not rest: I\nwandered from chamber to chamber, followed by my great dog, and all were\nalike empty and desolate. I had nearly finished a cigar when I thought\nI heard a pebble strike the window, and looking out I saw David's father\nstanding beneath. I had told him that I lived in this street, and I\nsuppose my lights had guided him to my window.\n\n\"I could not lie down,\" he called up hoarsely, \"until I heard your news.\nIs it all right?\"\n\nFor a moment I failed to understand him. Then I said sourly: \"Yes, all\nis right.\"\n\n\"Both doing well?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Both,\" I answered, and all the time I was trying to shut the window.\nIt was undoubtedly a kindly impulse that had brought him out, but I was\nnevertheless in a passion with him.\n\n\"Boy or girl?\" persisted the dodderer with ungentlemanlike curiosity.\n\n\"Boy,\" I said, very furiously.\n\n\"Splendid,\" he called out, and I think he added something else, but by\nthat time I had closed the window with a slam.\n\n\n\n\nV. The Fight For Timothy\n\nMary's poor pretentious babe screamed continually, with a note of\nexultation in his din, as if he thought he was devoting himself to a\nlife of pleasure, and often the last sound I heard as I got me out of\nthe street was his haw-haw-haw, delivered triumphantly as if it were\nsome entirely new thing, though he must have learned it like a parrot. I\nhad not one tear for the woman, but Poor father, thought I; to know that\nevery time your son is happy you are betrayed. Phew, a nauseous draught.\n\nI have the acquaintance of a deliciously pretty girl, who is always\nsulky, and the thoughtless beseech her to be bright, not witting wherein\nlies her heroism. She was born the merriest of maids, but, being a\nstudent of her face, learned anon that sulkiness best becomes it, and so\nshe has struggled and prevailed. A woman's history. Brave Margaret, when\nnight falls and thy hair is down, dost thou return, I wonder, to thy\nnatural state, or, dreading the shadow of indulgence, sleepest thou even\nsulkily?\n\nBut will a male child do as much for his father? This remains to be\nseen, and so, after waiting several months, I decided to buy David a\nrocking-horse. My St. Bernard dog accompanied me, though I have always\nbeen diffident of taking him to toy-shops, which over-excite him.\nHitherto the toys I had bought had always been for him, and as we durst\nnot admit this to the saleswoman we were both horribly self-conscious\nwhen in the shop. A score of times I have told him that he had much\nbetter not come, I have announced fiercely that he is not to come. He\nthen lets go of his legs, which is how a St. Bernard sits down, making\nthe noise of a sack of coals suddenly deposited, and, laying his head\nbetween his front paws, stares at me through the red haws that make his\neyes so mournful. He will do this for an hour without blinking, for he\nknows that in time it will unman me. My dog knows very little, but what\nlittle he does know he knows extraordinarily well. One can get out of my\nchambers by a back way, and I sometimes steal softly--but I can't\nhelp looking back, and there he is, and there are those haws asking\nsorrowfully, \"Is this worthy of you?\"\n\n\"Curse you,\" I say, \"get your hat,\" or words to that effect.\n\nHe has even been to the club, where he waddles up the stairs so exactly\nlike some respected member that he makes everybody most uncomfortable.\nI forget how I became possessor of him. I think I cut him out of an old\nnumber of Punch. He costs me as much as an eight-roomed cottage in the\ncountry.\n\nHe was a full-grown dog when I first, most foolishly, introduced him\nto toys. I had bought a toy in the street for my own amusement. It\nrepresented a woman, a young mother, flinging her little son over her\nhead with one hand and catching him in the other, and I was entertaining\nmyself on the hearth-rug with this pretty domestic scene when I heard\nan unwonted sound from Porthos, and, looking up, I saw that noble and\nmelancholic countenance on the broad grin. I shuddered and was for\nputting the toy away at once, but he sternly struck down my arm with\nhis, and signed that I was to continue. The unmanly chuckle always\ncame, I found, when the poor lady dropped her babe, but the whole thing\nentranced him; he tried to keep his excitement down by taking huge\ndraughts of water; he forgot all his niceties of conduct; he sat in holy\nrapture with the toy between his paws, took it to bed with him, ate it\nin the night, and searched for it so longingly next day that I had to go\nout and buy him the man with the scythe. After that we had everything of\nnote, the bootblack boy, the toper with bottle, the woolly rabbit\nthat squeaks when you hold it in your mouth; they all vanished as\ninexplicably as the lady, but I dared not tell him my suspicions, for he\nsuspected also and his gentle heart would have mourned had I confirmed\nhis fears.\n\nThe dame in the temple of toys which we frequent thinks I want them\nfor a little boy and calls him \"the precious\" and \"the lamb,\" the while\nPorthos is standing gravely by my side. She is a motherly soul, but\nover-talkative.\n\n\"And how is the dear lamb to-day?\" she begins, beaming.\n\n\"Well, ma'am, well,\" I say, keeping tight grip of his collar.\n\n\"This blighty weather is not affecting his darling appetite?\"\n\n\"No, ma'am, not at all.\" (She would be considerably surprised if\ninformed that he dined to-day on a sheepshead, a loaf, and three\ncabbages, and is suspected of a leg of mutton.)\n\n\"I hope he loves his toys?\"\n\n\"He carries them about with him everywhere, ma'am.\" (Has the one we\nbought yesterday with him now, though you might not think it to look at\nhim.)\n\n\"What do you say to a box of tools this time?\"\n\n\"I think not, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Is the deary fond of digging?\"\n\n\"Very partial to digging.\" (We shall find the leg of mutton some day.)\n\n\"Then perhaps a weeny spade and a pail?\"\n\nShe got me to buy a model of Canterbury Cathedral once, she was so\ninsistent, and Porthos gave me his mind about it when we got home. He\ndetests the kindergarten system, and as she is absurdly prejudiced in\nits favour we have had to try other shops. We went to the Lowther Arcade\nfor the rocking-horse. Dear Lowther Arcade! Ofttimes have we wandered\nagape among thy enchanted palaces, Porthos and I, David and I, David and\nPorthos and I. I have heard that thou art vulgar, but I cannot see how,\nunless it be that tattered children haunt thy portals, those awful yet\nsmiling entrances to so much joy. To the Arcade there are two entrances,\nand with much to be sung in laudation of that which opens from the\nStrand I yet on the whole prefer the other as the more truly romantic,\nbecause it is there the tattered ones congregate, waiting to see the\nDavids emerge with the magic lamp. We have always a penny for them,\nand I have known them, before entering the Arcade with it, retire (but\nwhither?) to wash; surely the prettiest of all the compliments that are\npaid to the home of toys.\n\nAnd now, O Arcade, so much fairer than thy West End brother, we are told\nthat thou art doomed, anon to be turned into an eating-house or a hive\nfor usurers, something rankly useful. All thy delights are under notice\nto quit. The Noah's arks are packed one within another, with clockwork\nhorses harnessed to them; the soldiers, knapsack on back, are kissing\ntheir hands to the dear foolish girls, who, however, will not be left\nbehind them; all the four-footed things gather around the elephant, who\nis overful of drawing-room furniture; the birds flutter their wings; the\nman with the scythe mows his way through the crowd; the balloons tug\nat their strings; the ships rock under a swell of sail, everything is\ngetting ready for the mighty exodus into the Strand. Tears will be shed.\n\nSo we bought the horse in the Lowther Arcade, Porthos, who thought it\nwas for him, looking proud but uneasy, and it was sent to the bandbox\nhouse anonymously. About a week afterward I had the ill-luck to meet\nMary's husband in Kensington, so I asked him what he had called his\nlittle girl.\n\n\"It is a boy,\" he replied, with intolerable good-humour, \"we call him\nDavid.\"\n\nAnd then with a singular lack of taste he wanted the name of my boy.\n\nI flicked my glove. \"Timothy,\" said I.\n\nI saw a suppressed smile on his face, and said hotly that Timothy was as\ngood a name as David. \"I like it,\" he assured me, and expressed a hope\nthat they would become friends. I boiled to say that I really could not\nallow Timothy to mix with boys of the David class, but I refrained, and\nlistened coldly while he told me what David did when you said his toes\nwere pigs going to market or returning from it, I forget which. He\nalso boasted of David's weight (a subject about which we are uncommonly\ntouchy at the club), as if children were for throwing forth for a wager.\n\nBut no more about Timothy. Gradually this vexed me. I felt what a\nforlorn little chap Timothy was, with no one to say a word for him, and\nI became his champion and hinted something about teething, but withdrew\nit when it seemed too surprising, and tried to get on to safer ground,\nsuch as bibs and general intelligence, but the painter fellow was so\nwilling to let me have my say, and knew so much more about babies than\nis fitting for men to know, that I paled before him and wondered why the\ndeuce he was listening to me so attentively.\n\nYou may remember a story he had told me about some anonymous friend.\n\"His latest,\" said he now, \"is to send David a rocking-horse!\"\n\nI must say I could see no reason for his mirth. \"Picture it,\" said he,\n\"a rocking-horse for a child not three months old!\"\n\nI was about to say fiercely: \"The stirrups are adjustable,\" but thought\nit best to laugh with him. But I was pained to hear that Mary had\nlaughed, though heaven knows I have often laughed at her.\n\n\"But women are odd,\" he said unexpectedly, and explained. It appears\nthat in the middle of her merriment Mary had become grave and said to\nhim quite haughtily, \"I see nothing to laugh at.\" Then she had kissed\nthe horse solemnly on the nose and said, \"I wish he was here to see\nme do it.\" There are moments when one cannot help feeling a drawing to\nMary.\n\nBut moments only, for the next thing he said put her in a particularly\nodious light. He informed me that she had sworn to hunt Mr. Anon down.\n\n\"She won't succeed,\" I said, sneering but nervous.\n\n\"Then it will be her first failure,\" said he.\n\n\"But she knows nothing about the man.\"\n\n\"You would not say that if you heard her talking of him. She says he is\na gentle, whimsical, lonely old bachelor.\"\n\n\"Old?\" I cried.\n\n\"Well, what she says is that he will soon be old if he doesn't take\ncare. He is a bachelor at all events, and is very fond of children, but\nhas never had one to play with.\"\n\n\"Could not play with a child though there was one,\" I said brusquely;\n\"has forgotten the way; could stand and stare only.\"\n\n\"Yes, if the parents were present. But he thinks that if he were alone\nwith the child he could come out strong.\"\n\n\"How the deuce--\" I began\n\n\"That is what she says,\" he explained, apologetically. \"I think she will\nprove to be too clever for him.\"\n\n\"Pooh,\" I said, but undoubtedly I felt a dizziness, and the next time\nI met him he quite frightened me. \"Do you happen to know any one,\" he\nsaid, \"who has a St. Bernard dog?\"\n\n\"No,\" said I, picking up my stick.\n\n\"He has a St. Bernard dog.\"\n\n\"How have you found that out?\"\n\n\"She has found it out.\"\n\n\"But how?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\nI left him at once, for Porthos was but a little way behind me. The\nmystery of it scared me, but I armed promptly for battle. I engaged\na boy to walk Porthos in Kensington Gardens, and gave him these\ninstructions: \"Should you find yourself followed by a young woman\nwheeling a second-hand perambulator, instantly hand her over to the\npolice on the charge of attempting to steal the dog.\"\n\nNow then, Mary.\n\n\"By the way,\" her husband said at our next meeting, \"that rocking-horse\nI told you of cost three guineas.\"\n\n\"She has gone to the shop to ask?\"\n\n\"No, not to ask that, but for a description of the purchaser's\nappearance.\"\n\nOh, Mary, Mary.\n\nHere is the appearance of purchaser as supplied at the Arcade:--looked\nlike a military gentleman; tall, dark, and rather dressy; fine Roman\nnose (quite so), carefully trimmed moustache going grey (not at all);\nhair thin and thoughtfully distributed over the head like fiddlestrings,\nas if to make the most of it (pah!); dusted chair with handkerchief\nbefore sitting down on it, and had other oldmaidish ways (I should like\nto know what they are); tediously polite, but no talker; bored face; age\nforty-five if a day (a lie); was accompanied by an enormous yellow dog\nwith sore eyes. (They always think the haws are sore eyes.)\n\n\"Do you know anyone who is like that?\" Mary's husband asked me\ninnocently.\n\n\"My dear man,\" I said, \"I know almost no one who is not like that,\" and\nit was true, so like each other do we grow at the club. I was pleased,\non the whole, with this talk, for it at least showed me how she had\ncome to know of the St. Bernard, but anxiety returned when one day from\nbehind my curtains I saw Mary in my street with an inquiring eye on\nthe windows. She stopped a nurse who was carrying a baby and went into\npretended ecstasies over it. I was sure she also asked whether by any\nchance it was called Timothy. And if not, whether that nurse knew any\nother nurse who had charge of a Timothy.\n\nObviously Mary suspicioned me, but nevertheless, I clung to Timothy,\nthough I wished fervently that I knew more about him; for I still met\nthat other father occasionally, and he always stopped to compare notes\nabout the boys. And the questions he asked were so intimate, how Timothy\nslept, how he woke up, how he fell off again, what we put in his bath.\nIt is well that dogs and little boys have so much in common, for it was\nreally of Porthos I told him; how he slept (peacefully), how he woke\nup (supposed to be subject to dreams), how he fell off again (with one\nlittle hand on his nose), but I glided past what we put in his bath\n(carbolic and a mop).\n\nThe man had not the least suspicion of me, and I thought it reasonable\nto hope that Mary would prove as generous. Yet was I straitened in\nmy mind. For it might be that she was only biding her time to strike\nsuddenly, and this attached me the more to Timothy, as if I feared she\nmight soon snatch him from me. As was indeed to be the case.\n\n\n\n\nVI. A Shock\n\nIt was on a May day, and I saw Mary accompany her husband as far as the\nfirst crossing, whence she waved him out of sight as if he had boarded\nan Atlantic-liner. All this time she wore the face of a woman happily\nmarried who meant to go straight home, there to await her lord's\nglorious return; and the military-looking gentleman watching her with a\nbored smile saw nothing better before him than a chapter on the Domestic\nFelicities. Oh, Mary, can you not provide me with the tiniest little\nplot?\n\nHallo!\n\nNo sooner was she hid from him than she changed into another woman; she\nwas now become a calculating purposeful madam, who looked around her\ncovertly and, having shrunk in size in order to appear less noticeable,\nset off nervously on some mysterious adventure.\n\n\"The deuce!\" thought I, and followed her.\n\nLike one anxious to keep an appointment, she frequently consulted her\nwatch, looking long at it, as if it were one of those watches that do\nnot give up their secret until you have made a mental calculation. Once\nshe kissed it. I had always known that she was fond of her cheap little\nwatch, which he gave her, I think, on the day I dropped the letter, but\nwhy kiss it in the street? Ah, and why then replace it so hurriedly in\nyour leather-belt, Mary, as if it were guilt to you to kiss to-day, or\nany day, the watch your husband gave you?\n\nIt will be seen that I had made a very rapid journey from light thoughts\nto uneasiness. I wanted no plot by the time she reached her destination,\na street of tawdry shops. She entered none of them, but paced slowly\nand shrinking from observation up and down the street, a very figure of\nshame; and never had I thought to read shame in the sweet face of Mary\nA----. Had I crossed to her and pronounced her name I think it would\nhave felled her, and yet she remained there, waiting. I, too, was\nwaiting for him, wondering if this was the man, or this, or this, and I\nbelieve I clutched my stick.\n\nDid I suspect Mary? Oh, surely not for a moment of time. But there\nwas some foolishness here; she was come without the knowledge of her\nhusband, as her furtive manner indicated, to a meeting she dreaded and\nwas ashamed to tell him of; she was come into danger; then it must be\nto save, not herself but him; the folly to be concealed could never have\nbeen Mary's. Yet what could have happened in the past of that honest boy\nfrom the consequences of which she might shield him by skulking here?\nCould that laugh of his have survived a dishonour? The open forehead,\nthe curly locks, the pleasant smile, the hundred ingratiating ways\nwhich we carry with us out of childhood, they may all remain when the\ninnocence has fled, but surely the laugh of the morning of life must go.\nI have never known the devil retain his grip on that.\n\nBut Mary was still waiting. She was no longer beautiful; shame had\npossession of her face, she was an ugly woman. Then the entanglement\nwas her husband's, and I cursed him for it. But without conviction, for,\nafter all, what did I know of women? I have some distant memories of\nthem, some vain inventions. But of men--I have known one man indifferent\nwell for over forty years, have exulted in him (odd to think of it),\nshuddered at him, wearied of him, been willing (God forgive me) to\njog along with him tolerantly long after I have found him out; I know\nsomething of men, and, on my soul, boy, I believe I am wronging you.\n\nThen Mary is here for some innocent purpose, to do a good deed that were\nbetter undone, as it so scares her. Turn back, you foolish, soft heart,\nand I shall say no more about it. Obstinate one, you saw the look on\nyour husband's face as he left you. It is the studio light by which he\npaints and still sees to hope, despite all the disappointments of his\nnot ignoble ambitions. That light is the dower you brought him, and he\nis a wealthy man if it does not flicker.\n\nSo anxious to be gone, and yet she would not go. Several times she made\nlittle darts, as if at last resolved to escape from that detestable\nstreet, and faltered and returned like a bird to the weasel. Again she\nlooked at her watch and kissed it.\n\nOh, Mary, take flight. What madness is this? Woman, be gone.\n\nSuddenly she was gone. With one mighty effort and a last terrified look\nround, she popped into a pawnshop.\n\nLong before she emerged I understood it all, I think even as the door\nrang and closed on her; why the timid soul had sought a street where she\nwas unknown, why she crept so many times past that abhorred shop before\ndesperately venturing in, why she looked so often at the watch she might\nnever see again. So desperately cumbered was Mary to keep her little\nhouse over her head, and yet the brave heart was retaining a smiling\nface for her husband, who must not even know where her little treasures\nwere going.\n\nIt must seem monstrously cruel of me, but I was now quite light-hearted\nagain. Even when Mary fled from the shop where she had left her watch,\nand I had peace of mind to note how thin and worn she had become, as\nif her baby was grown too big for her slight arms, even then I was\nlight-hearted. Without attempting to follow her, I sauntered homeward\nhumming a snatch of song with a great deal of fal-de-lal-de-riddle-o in\nit, for I can never remember words. I saw her enter another shop, baby\nlinen shop or some nonsense of that sort, so it was plain for what\nshe had popped her watch; but what cared I? I continued to sing most\nbeautifully. I lunged gayly with my stick at a lamp-post and missed\nit, whereat a street-urchin grinned, and I winked at him and slipped\ntwopence down his back.\n\n\nI presume I would have chosen the easy way had time been given me, but\nfate willed that I should meet the husband on his homeward journey, and\nhis first remark inspired me to a folly.\n\n\"How is Timothy?\" he asked; and the question opened a way so attractive\nthat I think no one whose dull life craves for colour could have\nresisted it.\n\n\"He is no more,\" I replied impulsively.\n\nThe painter was so startled that he gave utterance to a very oath of\npity, and I felt a sinking myself, for in these hasty words my little\nboy was gone, indeed; all my bright dreams of Timothy, all my efforts to\nshelter him from Mary's scorn, went whistling down the wind.\n\n\n\n\nVII. The Last of Timothy\n\nSo accomplished a person as the reader must have seen at once that I\nmade away with Timothy in order to give his little vests and pinafores\nand shoes to David, and, therefore, dear sir or madam, rail not overmuch\nat me for causing our painter pain. Know, too, that though his sympathy\nran free I soon discovered many of his inquiries to be prompted by a\nmere selfish desire to save his boy from the fate of mine. Such are\nparents.\n\nHe asked compassionately if there was anything he could do for me, and,\nof course, there was something he could do, but were I to propose it I\ndoubted not he would be on his stilts at once, for already I had reason\nto know him for a haughty, sensitive dog, who ever became high at the\nfirst hint of help. So the proposal must come from him. I spoke of the\nmany little things in the house that were now hurtful to me to look\nupon, and he clutched my hand, deeply moved, though it was another house\nwith its little things he saw. I was ashamed to harass him thus, but he\nhad not a sufficiency of the little things, and besides my impulsiveness\nhad plunged me into a deuce of a mess, so I went on distastefully. Was\nthere no profession in this age of specialism for taking away children's\ngarments from houses where they were suddenly become a pain? Could I\nsell them? Could I give them to the needy, who would probably dispose of\nthem for gin? I told him of a friend with a young child who had already\nrefused them because it would be unpleasant to him to be reminded of\nTimothy, and I think this was what touched him to the quick, so that he\nmade the offer I was waiting for.\n\nI had done it with a heavy foot, and by this time was in a rage with\nboth him and myself, but I always was a bungler, and, having adopted\nthis means in a hurry, I could at the time see no other easy way out.\nTimothy's hold on life, as you may have apprehended, was ever of the\nslightest, and I suppose I always knew that he must soon revert to the\nobscure. He could never have penetrated into the open. It was no life\nfor a boy.\n\nYet now, that his time had come, I was loath to see him go. I seem\nto remember carrying him that evening to the window with uncommon\ntenderness (following the setting sun that was to take him away), and\ntelling him with not unnatural bitterness that he had got to leave me\nbecause another child was in need of all his pretty things; and as the\nsun, his true father, lapt him in its dancing arms, he sent his love to\na lady of long ago whom he called by the sweetest of names, not knowing\nin his innocence that the little white birds are the birds that never\nhave a mother. I wished (so had the phantasy of Timothy taken possession\nof me) that before he went he could have played once in the Kensington\nGardens, and have ridden on the fallen trees, calling gloriously to me\nto look; that he could have sailed one paper-galleon on the Round Pond;\nfain would I have had him chase one hoop a little way down the laughing\navenues of childhood, where memory tells us we run but once, on a long\nsummer-day, emerging at the other end as men and women with all the fun\nto pay for; and I think (thus fancy wantons with me in these desolate\nchambers) he knew my longings, and said with a boy-like flush that the\nreason he never did these things was not that he was afraid, for he\nwould have loved to do them all, but because he was not quite like other\nboys; and, so saying, he let go my finger and faded from before my eyes\ninto another and golden ether; but I shall ever hold that had he been\nquite like other boys there would have been none braver than my Timothy.\n\nI fear I am not truly brave myself, for though when under fire, so far\nas I can recollect, I behaved as others, morally I seem to be deficient.\nSo I discovered next day when I attempted to buy David's outfit,\nand found myself as shy of entering the shop as any Mary at the\npawnbroker's. The shop for little garments seems very alarming when you\nreach the door; a man abruptly become a parent, and thus lost to a\nfiner sense of the proprieties, may be able to stalk in unprotected, but\napparently I could not. Indeed, I have allowed a repugnance to entering\nshops of any kind, save my tailor's, to grow on me, and to my tailor's I\nfear I go too frequently.\n\nSo I skulked near the shop of the little garments, jeering at myself,\nand it was strange to me to reflect at, say, three o'clock that if I had\nbeen brazen at half-past two all would now be over.\n\nTo show what was my state, take the case of the very gentleman-like man\nwhom I detected gazing fixedly at me, or so I thought, just as I had\ndrawn valiantly near the door. I sauntered away, but when I returned\nhe was still there, which seemed conclusive proof that he had smoked\nmy purpose. Sternly controlling my temper I bowed, and said with icy\npoliteness, \"You have the advantage of me, sir.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said he, and I am now persuaded that my words\nturned his attention to me for the first time, but at the moment I was\nsure some impertinent meaning lurked behind his answer.\n\n\"I have not the pleasure of your acquaintance,\" I barked.\n\n\"No one regrets it more than I do,\" he replied, laughing.\n\n\"I mean, sir,\" said I, \"that I shall wait here until you retire,\" and\nwith that I put my back to a shop-window.\n\nBy this time he was grown angry, and said he, \"I have no engagement,\"\nand he put his back to the shop-window. Each of us was doggedly\ndetermined to tire the other out, and we must have looked ridiculous. We\nalso felt it, for ten minutes afterward, our passions having died away,\nwe shook hands cordially and agreed to call hansoms.\n\nMust I abandon the enterprise? Certainly I knew divers ladies who would\nmake the purchases for me, but first I must explain, and, rather\nthan explain it has ever been my custom to do without. I was in this\ndespondency when a sudden recollection of Irene and Mrs. Hicking\nheartened me like a cordial, for I saw in them at once the engine and\ndecoy by which David should procure his outfit.\n\nYou must be told who they were.\n\n\n\n\nVIII. The Inconsiderate Waiter\n\nThey were the family of William, one of our club waiters who had been\ndisappointing me grievously of late. Many a time have I deferred dining\nseveral minutes that I might have the attendance of this ingrate. His\nefforts to reserve the window-table for me were satisfactory, and I\nused to allow him privileges, as to suggest dishes; I have given him\ninformation, as that someone had startled me in the reading-room by\nslamming a door; I have shown him how I cut my finger with a piece\nof string. William was none of your assertive waiters. We could have\nplotted a murder safely before him. It was one member who said to him\nthat Saucy Sarah would win the Derby and another who said that Saucy\nSarah had no chance, but it was William who agreed with both. The\nexcellent fellow (as I thought him) was like a cheroot which may be\nsmoked from either end.\n\nI date his lapse from one evening when I was dining by the window. I had\nto repeat my order \"Devilled kidney,\" and instead of answering brightly,\n\"Yes, sir,\" as if my selection of devilled kidney was a personal\ngratification to him, which is the manner one expects of a waiter, he\ngazed eagerly out at the window, and then, starting, asked, \"Did you\nsay devilled kidney, sir?\" A few minutes afterward I became aware that\nsomeone was leaning over the back of my chair, and you may conceive my\nindignation on discovering that this rude person was William. Let me\ntell, in the measured words of one describing a past incident, what next\ntook place. To get nearer the window he pressed heavily on my shoulder.\n\"William,\" I said, \"you are not attending to me!\"\n\nTo be fair to him, he shook, but never shall I forget his audacious\napology, \"Beg pardon, sir, but I was thinking of something else.\"\n\nAnd immediately his eyes resought the window, and this burst from him\npassionately, \"For God's sake, sir, as we are man and man, tell me if\nyou have seen a little girl looking up at the club-windows.\"\n\nMan and man! But he had been a good waiter once, so I pointed out the\ngirl to him. As soon as she saw William she ran into the middle of Pall\nMall, regardless of hansoms (many of which seemed to pass over her),\nnodded her head significantly three times and then disappeared (probably\non a stretcher). She was the tawdriest little Arab of about ten years,\nbut seemed to have brought relief to William. \"Thank God!\" said he\nfervently, and in the worst taste.\n\nI was as much horrified as if he had dropped a plate on my toes. \"Bread,\nWilliam,\" I said sharply.\n\n\"You are not vexed with me, sir?\" he had the hardihood to whisper.\n\n\"It was a liberty,\" I said.\n\n\"I know, sir, but I was beside myself.\"\n\n\"That was a liberty again.\"\n\n\"It is my wife, sir, she--\"\n\nSo William, whom I had favoured in so many ways, was a married man. I\nfelt that this was the greatest liberty of all.\n\nI gathered that the troublesome woman was ailing, and as one who likes\nafter dinner to believe that there is no distress in the world, I\ndesired to be told by William that the signals meant her return to\nhealth. He answered inconsiderately, however, that the doctor feared the\nworst.\n\n\"Bah, the doctor,\" I said in a rage.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said William.\n\n\"What is her confounded ailment?\"\n\n\"She was allus one of the delicate kind, but full of spirit, and you\nsee, sir, she has had a baby-girl lately--\"\n\n\"William, how dare you,\" I said, but in the same moment I saw that this\nfather might be useful to me. \"How does your baby sleep, William?\" I\nasked in a low voice, \"how does she wake up? what do you put in her\nbath?\"\n\nI saw surprise in his face, so I hurried on without waiting for an\nanswer. \"That little girl comes here with a message from your wife?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, every evening; she's my eldest, and three nods from her means\nthat the missus is a little better.\"\n\n\"There were three nods to-day?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\n\n\"I suppose you live in some low part, William?\"\n\nThe impudent fellow looked as if he could have struck me. \"Off Drury\nLane,\" he said, flushing, \"but it isn't low. And now,\" he groaned,\n\"she's afeared she will die without my being there to hold her hand.\"\n\n\"She should not say such things.\"\n\n\"She never says them, sir. She allus pretends to be feeling stronger.\nBut I knows what is in her mind when I am leaving the house in the\nmorning, for then she looks at me from her bed, and I looks at her from\nthe door--oh, my God, sir!\"\n\n\"William!\"\n\nAt last he saw that I was angry, and it was characteristic of him to beg\nmy pardon and withdraw his wife as if she were some unsuccessful dish.\nI tried to forget his vulgar story in billiards, but he had spoiled\nmy game, and next day to punish him I gave my orders through another\nwaiter. As I had the window-seat, however, I could not but see that the\nlittle girl was late, and though this mattered nothing to me and I had\nfinished my dinner, I lingered till she came. She not only nodded three\ntimes but waved her hat, and I arose, having now finished my dinner.\n\nWilliam came stealthily toward me. \"Her temperature has gone down, sir,\"\nhe said, rubbing his hands together.\n\n\"To whom are you referring?\" I asked coldly, and retired to the\nbilliard-room, where I played a capital game.\n\nI took pains to show William that I had forgotten his maunderings, but\nI observed the girl nightly, and once, instead of nodding, she shook her\nhead, and that evening I could not get into a pocket. Next evening\nthere was no William in the dining-room, and I thought I knew what had\nhappened. But, chancing to enter the library rather miserably, I\nwas surprised to see him on a ladder dusting books. We had the room\npractically to ourselves, for though several members sat on chairs\nholding books in their hands they were all asleep, and William descended\nthe ladder to tell me his blasting tale. He had sworn at a member!\n\n\"I hardly knew what I was doing all day, sir, for I had left her so\nweakly that--\"\n\nI stamped my foot.\n\n\"I beg your pardon for speaking of her,\" he had the grace to say. \"But\nIrene had promised to come every two hours; and when she came about\nfour o'clock and I saw she was crying, it sort of blinded me, sir, and\nI stumbled against a member, Mr. B----, and he said, 'Damn you!' Well,\nsir, I had but touched him after all, and I was so broken it sort of\nstung me to be treated so and I lost my senses, and I said, 'Damn you!'\"\n\nHis shamed head sank on his chest, and I think some of the readers\nshuddered in their sleep.\n\n\"I was turned out of the dining-room at once, and sent here until the\ncommittee have decided what to do with me. Oh, sir, I am willing to go\non my knees to Mr. B----\"\n\nHow could I but despise a fellow who would be thus abject for a pound a\nweek?\n\n\"For if I have to tell her I have lost my place she will just fall back\nand die.\"\n\n\"I forbid your speaking to me of that woman,\" I cried wryly, \"unless you\ncan speak pleasantly,\" and I left him to his fate and went off to\nlook for B----. \"What is this story about your swearing at one of the\nwaiters?\" I asked him.\n\n\"You mean about his swearing at me,\" said B----, reddening.\n\n\"I am glad that was it,\" I said, \"for I could not believe you guilty of\nsuch bad form. The version which reached me was that you swore at each\nother, and that he was to be dismissed and you reprimanded.\"\n\n\"Who told you that?\" asked B----, who is a timid man.\n\n\"I am on the committee,\" I replied lightly, and proceeded to talk of\nother matters, but presently B----, who had been reflecting, said: \"Do\nyou know I fancy I was wrong in thinking that the waiter swore at me,\nand I shall withdraw the charge to-morrow.\"\n\nI was pleased to find that William's troubles were near an end without\nmy having to interfere in his behalf, and I then remembered that he\nwould not be able to see the girl Irene from the library windows,\nwhich are at the back of the club. I was looking down at her, but\nshe refrained from signalling because she could not see William, and\nirritated by her stupidity I went out and asked her how her mother was.\n\n\"My,\" she ejaculated after a long scrutiny of me, \"I b'lieve you are\none of them!\" and she gazed at me with delighted awe. I suppose William\ntells them of our splendid doings.\n\nThe invalid, it appeared, was a bit better, and this annoying child\nwanted to inform William that she had took all the tapiocar. She was to\nindicate this by licking an imaginary plate in the middle of Pall\nMall. I gave the little vulgarian a shilling, and returned to the club\ndisgusted.\n\n\"By the way, William,\" I said, \"Mr. B---- is to inform the committee\nthat he was mistaken in thinking you used improper language to him, so\nyou will doubtless be restored to the dining-room to-morrow.\"\n\nI had to add immediately, \"Remember your place, William.\"\n\n\"But Mr. B---- knows I swore,\" he insisted.\n\n\"A gentleman,\" I replied stiffly, \"cannot remember for many hours what a\nwaiter has said to him.\"\n\n\"No, sir, but--\"\n\nTo stop him I had to say, \"And--ah--William, your wife is decidedly\nbetter. She has eaten the tapioca--all of it.\"\n\n\"How can you know, sir?\"\n\n\"By an accident.\"\n\n\"Irene signed to the window?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then you saw her and went out and--\"\n\n\"How dare you, William?\"\n\n\"Oh, sir, to do that for me! May God bl--\"\n\n\"William.\"\n\nHe was reinstated in the dining-room, but often when I looked at him I\nseemed to see a dying wife in his face, and so the relations between us\nwere still strained. But I watched the girl, and her pantomime was so\nilluminating that I knew the sufferer had again cleaned the platter on\nTuesday, had attempted a boiled egg on Wednesday (you should have seen\nIrene chipping it in Pall Mall, and putting in the salt), but was in a\nwoful state of relapse on Thursday.\n\n\"Is your mother very ill to-day, Miss Irene?\" I asked, as soon as I had\ndrawn her out of range of the club-windows.\n\n\"My!\" she exclaimed again, and I saw an ecstatic look pass between her\nand a still smaller girl with her, whom she referred to as a neighbour.\n\nI waited coldly. William's wife, I was informed, had looked like nothing\nbut a dead one till she got the brandy.\n\n\"Hush, child,\" I said, shocked. \"You don't know how the dead look.\"\n\n\"Bless yer!\" she replied.\n\nAssisted by her friend, who was evidently enormously impressed by\nIrene's intimacy with me, she gave me a good deal of miscellaneous\ninformation, as that William's real name was Mr. Hicking, but that he\nwas known in their street, because of the number of his shirts, as Toff\nHicking. That the street held he should get away from the club before\ntwo in the morning, for his missus needed him more than the club needed\nhim. That William replied (very sensibly) that if the club was short of\nwaiters at supper-time some of the gentlemen might be kept waiting for\ntheir marrow-bone. That he sat up with his missus most of the night, and\npretended to her that he got some nice long naps at the club. That what\nshe talked to him about mostly was the kid. That the kid was in another\npart of London (in charge of a person called the old woman), because\nthere was an epidemic in Irene's street.\n\n\"And what does the doctor say about your mother?\"\n\n\"He sometimes says she would have a chance if she could get her kid\nback.\"\n\n\"Nonsense.\"\n\n\"And if she was took to the country.\"\n\n\"Then why does not William take her?\"\n\n\"My! And if she drank porty wine.\"\n\n\"Doesn't she?\"\n\n\"No. But father, he tells her 'bout how the gentlemen drinks it.\"\n\nI turned from her with relief, but she came after me.\n\n\"Ain't yer going to do it this time?\" she demanded with a falling face.\n\"You done it last time. I tell her you done it\"--she pointed to her\nfriend who was looking wistfully at me--\"ain't you to let her see you\ndoing of it?\"\n\nFor a moment I thought that her desire was another shilling, but by a\npiece of pantomime she showed that she wanted me to lift my hat to her.\nSo I lifted it, and when I looked behind she had her head in the air and\nher neighbour was gazing at her awestruck. These little creatures are\nreally not without merit.\n\nAbout a week afterward I was in a hired landau, holding a newspaper\nbefore my face lest anyone should see me in company of a waiter and his\nwife. William was taking her into Surrey to stay with an old nurse of\nmine, and Irene was with us, wearing the most outrageous bonnet.\n\nI formed a mean opinion of Mrs. Hicking's intelligence from her pride in\nthe baby, which was a very ordinary one. She created a regrettable scene\nwhen it was brought to her, because \"she had been feared it would not\nknow her again.\" I could have told her that they know no one for years\nhad I not been in terror of Irene, who dandled the child on her knees\nand talked to it all the way. I have never known a bolder little hussy\nthan this Irene. She asked the infant improper questions, such as \"Oo\nknow who gave me this bonnet?\" and answered them herself. \"It was\nthe pretty gentleman there,\" and several times I had to affect sleep,\nbecause she announced, \"Kiddy wants to kiss the pretty gentleman.\"\n\nIrksome as all this necessarily was to a man of taste, I suffered\nstill more acutely when we reached our destination, where disagreeable\ncircumstances compelled me to drink tea with a waiter's family. William\nknew that I regarded thanks from persons of his class as an outrage, yet\nhe looked them though he dared not speak them. Hardly had he sat down\nat the table by my orders than he remembered that I was a member of the\nclub and jumped up. Nothing is in worse form than whispering, yet again\nand again he whispered to his poor, foolish wife, \"How are you now?\nYou don't feel faint?\" and when she said she felt like another woman\nalready, his face charged me with the change. I could not but conclude\nfrom the way she let the baby pound her that she was stronger than she\npretended.\n\nI remained longer than was necessary because I had something to say to\nWilliam which I feared he would misunderstand, but when he announced\nthat it was time for him to catch a train back to London, at which his\nwife paled, I delivered the message.\n\n\"William,\" I said, backing away from him, \"the head-waiter asked me to\nsay that you could take a fortnight's holiday. Your wages will be paid\nas usual.\"\n\nConfound him.\n\n\"William,\" I cried furiously, \"go away.\"\n\nThen I saw his wife signing to him, and I knew she wanted to be left\nalone with me.\n\n\"William,\" I cried in a panic, \"stay where you are.\"\n\nBut he was gone, and I was alone with a woman whose eyes were filmy. Her\nclass are fond of scenes. \"If you please, ma'am!\" I said imploringly.\n\nBut she kissed my hand; she was like a little dog.\n\n\"It can be only the memory of some woman,\" said she, \"that makes you so\nkind to me and mine.\"\n\nMemory was the word she used, as if all my youth were fled. I suppose I\nreally am quite elderly.\n\n\"I should like to know her name, sir,\" she said, \"that I may mention her\nwith loving respect in my prayers.\"\n\nI raised the woman and told her the name. It was not Mary. \"But she has\na home,\" I said, \"as you have, and I have none. Perhaps, ma'am, it would\nbe better worth your while to mention me.\"\n\n\nIt was this woman, now in health, whom I intrusted with the purchase of\nthe outfits, \"one for a boy of six months,\" I explained to her, \"and one\nfor a boy of a year,\" for the painter had boasted to me of David's rapid\ngrowth. I think she was a little surprised to find that both outfits\nwere for the same house; and she certainly betrayed an ignoble curiosity\nabout the mother's Christian name, but she was much easier to brow-beat\nthan a fine lady would have been, and I am sure she and her daughter\nenjoyed themselves hugely in the shops, from one of which I shall never\nforget Irene emerging proudly with a commissionaire, who conducted her\nunder an umbrella to the cab where I was lying in wait. I think that was\nthe most celestial walk of Irene's life.\n\nI told Mrs. Hicking to give the articles a little active ill-treatment\nthat they might not look quite new, at which she exclaimed, not being in\nmy secret, and then to forward them to me. I then sent them to Mary and\nrejoiced in my devilish cunning all the evening, but chagrin came in the\nmorning with a letter from her which showed she knew all, that I was her\nMr. Anon, and that there never had been a Timothy. I think I was never\nso gravelled. Even now I don't know how she had contrived it.\n\nHer cleverness raised such a demon in me that I locked away her letter\nat once and have seldom read it since. No married lady should have\nindited such an epistle to a single man. It said, with other things\nwhich I decline to repeat, that I was her good fairy. As a sample of the\ndeliberate falsehoods in it, I may mention that she said David loved me\nalready. She hoped that I would come in often to see her husband, who\nwas very proud of my friendship, and suggested that I should pay him my\nfirst visit to-day at three o'clock, an hour at which, as I happened to\nknow, he is always away giving a painting-lesson. In short, she wanted\nfirst to meet me alone, so that she might draw the delicious, respectful\nromance out of me, and afterward repeat it to him, with sighs and little\npeeps at him over her pocket-handkerchief.\n\nShe had dropped what were meant to look like two tears for me upon the\npaper, but I should not wonder though they were only artful drops of\nwater.\n\nI sent her a stiff and tart reply, declining to hold any communication\nwith her.\n\n\n\n\nIX. A Confirmed Spinster\n\nI am in danger, I see, of being included among the whimsical fellows,\nwhich I so little desire that I have got me into my writing-chair to\ncombat the charge, but, having sat for an unconscionable time with pen\npoised, I am come agitatedly to the fear that there may be something in\nit.\n\nSo long a time has elapsed, you must know, since I abated of the ardours\nof self-inquiry that I revert in vain (through many rusty doors) for the\nbeginning of this change in me, if changed I am; I seem ever to see this\nsame man until I am back in those wonderful months which were half of\nmy life, when, indeed, I know that I was otherwise than I am now; no\nwhimsical fellow then, for that was one of the possibilities I put to\nmyself while seeking for the explanation of things, and found to be\ninadmissible. Having failed in those days to discover why I was driven\nfrom the garden, I suppose I ceased to be enamoured of myself, as of\nsome dull puzzle, and then perhaps the whimsicalities began to collect\nunnoticed.\n\nIt is a painful thought to me to-night, that he could wake up glorious\nonce, this man in the elbow-chair by the fire, who is humorously known\nat the club as a \"confirmed spinster.\" I remember him well when his\nyears told four and twenty; on my soul the proudest subaltern of my\nacquaintance, and with the most reason to be proud. There was nothing he\nmight not do in the future, having already done the biggest thing, this\ntoddler up club-steps to-day.\n\nNot, indeed, that I am a knave; I am tolerably kind, I believe, and most\ninoffensive, a gentleman, I trust, even in the eyes of the ladies who\nsmile at me as we converse; they are an ever-increasing number, or so it\nseems to me to-night. Ah, ladies, I forget when I first began to notice\nthat smile and to be made uneasy by it. I think I understand it now, and\nin some vague way it hurts me. I find that I watch for it nowadays, but\nI hope I am still your loyal, obedient servant.\n\nYou will scarcely credit it, but I have just remembered that I once had\na fascinating smile of my own. What has become of my smile? I swear I\nhave not noticed that it was gone till now; I am like one who revisiting\nhis school feels suddenly for his old knife. I first heard of my smile\nfrom another boy, whose sisters had considered all the smiles they knew\nand placed mine on top. My friend was scornful, and I bribed him to\nmention the plebiscite to no one, but secretly I was elated and amazed.\nI feel lost to-night without my smiles. I rose a moment ago to look for\nit in my mirror.\n\nI like to believe that she has it now. I think she may have some other\nforgotten trifles of mine with it that make the difference between that\nman and this. I remember her speaking of my smile, telling me it was my\none adornment, and taking it from me, so to speak, for a moment to let\nme see how she looked in it; she delighted to make sport of me when she\nwas in a wayward mood, and to show me all my ungainly tricks of voice\nand gesture, exaggerated and glorified in her entrancing self, like a\nstar calling to the earth: \"See, I will show you how you hobble round,\"\nand always there was a challenge to me in her eyes to stop her if I\ndared, and upon them, when she was most audacious, lay a sweet mist.\n\nThey all came to her court, as is the business of young fellows, to\ntell her what love is, and she listened with a noble frankness, having,\nindeed, the friendliest face for all engaged in this pursuit that can\never have sat on woman. I have heard ladies call her coquette, not\nunderstanding that she shone softly upon all who entered the lists\nbecause, with the rarest intuition, she foresaw that they must go away\nbroken men and already sympathised with their dear wounds. All wounds\nincurred for love were dear to her; at every true utterance about love\nshe exulted with grave approval, or it might be a with a little \"ah!\" or\n\"oh!\" like one drinking deliciously. Nothing could have been more fair,\nfor she was for the first comer who could hit the target, which was her\nheart.\n\nShe adored all beautiful things in their every curve and fragrance, so\nthat they became part of her. Day by day, she gathered beauty; had she\nhad no heart (she who was the bosom of womanhood) her thoughts would\nstill have been as lilies, because the good is the beautiful.\n\nAnd they all forgave her; I never knew of one who did not forgive her;\nI think had there been one it would have proved that there was a flaw in\nher. Perhaps, when good-bye came she was weeping because all the pretty\nthings were said and done with, or she was making doleful confessions\nabout herself, so impulsive and generous and confidential, and so devoid\nof humour, that they compelled even a tragic swain to laugh. She made a\nlooking-glass of his face to seek wofully in it whether she was at all\nto blame, and when his arms went out for her, and she stepped back so\nthat they fell empty, she mourned, with dear sympathy, his lack of\nskill to seize her. For what her soft eyes said was that she was always\nwaiting tremulously to be won. They all forgave her, because there was\nnothing to forgive, or very little, just the little that makes a dear\ngirl dearer, and often afterward, I believe, they have laughed fondly\nwhen thinking of her, like boys brought back. You ladies who are\neverything to your husbands save a girl from the dream of youth, have\nyou never known that double-chinned industrious man laugh suddenly in\na reverie and start up, as if he fancied he were being hailed from\nfar-away?\n\nI hear her hailing me now. She was so light-hearted that her laugh is\nwhat comes first across the years; so high-spirited that she would have\nwept like Mary of Scots because she could not lie on the bare plains\nlike the men. I hear her, but it is only as an echo; I see her, but it\nis as a light among distant trees, and the middle-aged man can draw no\nnearer; she was only for the boys. There was a month when I could have\nshown her to you in all her bravery, but then the veil fell, and from\nthat moment I understood her not. For long I watched her, but she was\nnever clear to me again, and for long she hovered round me, like a dear\nheart willing to give me a thousand chances to regain her love. She was\nso picturesque that she was the last word of art, but she was as young\nas if she were the first woman. The world must have rung with gallant\ndeeds and grown lovely thoughts for numberless centuries before she\ncould be; she was the child of all the brave and wistful imaginings of\nmen. She was as mysterious as night when it fell for the first time upon\nthe earth. She was the thing we call romance, which lives in the little\nhut beyond the blue haze of the pine-woods.\n\nNo one could have looked less elfish. She was all on a noble scale,\nher attributes were so generous, her manner unconquerably gracious, her\nmovements indolently active, her face so candid that you must swear her\nevery thought lived always in the open. Yet, with it all, she was a wild\nthing, alert, suspicious of the lasso, nosing it in every man's hand,\nmore curious about it than about aught else in the world; her quivering\ndelight was to see it cast for her, her game to elude it; so mettlesome\nwas she that she loved it to be cast fair that she might escape as it\nwas closing round her; she scorned, however her heart might be beating,\nto run from her pursuers; she took only the one step backward, which\nstill left her near them but always out of reach; her head on high now,\nbut her face as friendly, her manner as gracious as before, she is yours\nfor the catching. That was ever the unspoken compact between her and the\nhuntsmen.\n\nIt may be but an old trick come back to me with these memories, but\nagain I clasp my hands to my brows in amaze at the thought that all this\nwas for me could I retain her love. For I won it, wonder of the gods,\nbut I won it. I found myself with one foot across the magic circle\nwherein she moved, and which none but I had entered; and so, I think, I\nsaw her in revelation, not as the wild thing they had all conceived\nher, but as she really was. I saw no tameless creature, nothing wild\nor strange. I saw my sweet love placid as a young cow browsing. As I\nbrushed aside the haze and she was truly seen for the first time, she\nraised her head, like one caught, and gazed at me with meek affrighted\neyes. I told her what had been revealed to me as I looked upon her, and\nshe trembled, knowing she was at last found, and fain would she have\nfled away, but that her fear was less than her gladness. She came to me\nslowly; no incomprehensible thing to me now, but transparent as a pool,\nand so restful to look upon that she was a bath to the eyes, like banks\nof moss.\n\nBecause I knew the maid, she was mine. Every maid, I say, is for him\nwho can know her. The others had but followed the glamour in which she\nwalked, but I had pierced it and found the woman. I could anticipate her\nevery thought and gesture, I could have flashed and rippled and mocked\nfor her, and melted for her and been dear disdain for her. She would\nforget this and be suddenly conscious of it as she began to speak, when\nshe gave me a look with a shy smile in it which meant that she knew I\nwas already waiting at the end of what she had to say. I call this the\nblush of the eye. She had a look and a voice that were for me alone; her\nvery finger-tips were charged with caresses for me. And I loved even her\nnaughtinesses, as when she stamped her foot at me, which she could\nnot do without also gnashing her teeth, like a child trying to look\nfearsome. How pretty was that gnashing of her teeth! All her tormentings\nof me turned suddenly into sweetnesses, and who could torment like this\nexquisite fury, wondering in sudden flame why she could give herself to\nanyone, while I wondered only why she could give herself to me. It may\nbe that I wondered over-much. Perhaps that was why I lost her.\n\nIt was in the full of the moon that she was most restive, but I brought\nher back, and at first she could have bit my hand, but then she came\nwillingly. Never, I thought, shall she be wholly tamed, but he who knows\nher will always be able to bring her back.\n\nI am not that man, for mystery of mysteries, I lost her. I know not how\nit was, though in the twilight of my life that then began I groped for\nreasons until I wearied of myself; all I know is that she had ceased to\nlove me; I had won her love, but I could not keep it. The discovery came\nto me slowly, as if I were a most dull-witted man; at first I knew only\nthat I no longer understood her as of old. I found myself wondering what\nshe had meant by this and that; I did not see that when she began to\npuzzle me she was already lost to me. It was as if, unknowing, I had\nstrayed outside the magic circle.\n\nWhen I did understand I tried to cheat myself into the belief that there\nwas no change, and the dear heart bleeding for me assisted in that poor\npretence. She sought to glide to me with swimming eyes as before, but it\nshowed only that this caressing movement was still within her compass,\nbut never again for me. With the hands she had pressed to her breast she\ntouched mine, but no longer could they convey the message. The current\nwas broken, and soon we had to desist miserably from our pretences.\nShe could tell no more than I why she had ceased to love me; she was\nscarcely less anxious than I that I should make her love me again, and,\nas I have said, she waited with a wonderful tolerance while I strove\nfutilely to discover in what I was lacking and to remedy it. And when,\nat last, she had to leave me, it was with compassionate cries and little\nbackward flights.\n\nThe failure was mine alone, but I think I should not have been so\naltered by it had I known what was the defect in me through which I let\nher love escape. This puzzle has done me more harm than the loss of her.\nNevertheless, you must know (if I am to speak honestly to you) that I do\nnot repent me those dallyings in enchanted fields. It may not have been\nso always, for I remember a black night when a poor lieutenant lay down\nin an oarless boat and let it drift toward the weir. But his distant\nmoans do not greatly pain me now; rather am I elated to find (as the\nwaters bring him nearer) that this boy is I, for it is something to\nknow that, once upon a time, a woman could draw blood from me as from\nanother.\n\nI saw her again, years afterward, when she was a married woman playing\nwith her children. She stamped her foot at a naughty one, and I saw the\ngleam of her teeth as she gnashed them in the dear pretty way I can't\nforget; and then a boy and girl, fighting for her shoulders, brought\nthe whole group joyously to the ground. She picked herself up in the old\nleisurely manner, lazily active, and looked around her benignantly,\nlike a cow: our dear wild one safely tethered at last with a rope of\nchildren. I meant to make her my devoirs, but, as I stepped forward, the\nold wound broke out afresh, and I had to turn away. They were but a\nfew poor drops, which fell because I found that she was even a little\nsweeter than I had thought.\n\n\n\n\nX. Sporting Reflections\n\nI have now told you (I presume) how I became whimsical, and I fear it\nwould please Mary not at all. But speaking of her, and, as the cat's\nlight keeps me in a ruminating mood, suppose, instead of returning Mary\nto her lover by means of the letter, I had presented a certain clubman\nto her consideration? Certainly no such whimsical idea crossed my mind\nwhen I dropped the letter, but between you and me and my night-socks,\nwhich have all this time been airing by the fire because I am subject to\ncold feet, I have sometimes toyed with it since.\n\nWhy did I not think of this in time? Was it because I must ever remain\ntrue to the unattainable she?\n\nI am reminded of a passage in the life of a sweet lady, a friend of\nmine, whose daughter was on the eve of marriage, when suddenly her lover\ndied. It then became pitiful to watch that trembling old face trying to\npoint the way of courage to the young one. In time, however, there came\nanother youth, as true, I dare say, as the first, but not so well known\nto me, and I shrugged my shoulders cynically to see my old friend once\nmore a matchmaker. She took him to her heart and boasted of him; like\none made young herself by the great event, she joyously dressed her pale\ndaughter in her bridal gown, and, with smiles upon her face, she cast\nrice after the departing carriage. But soon after it had gone, I chanced\nupon her in her room, and she was on her knees in tears before the\nspirit of the dead lover. \"Forgive me,\" she besought him, \"for I am old,\nand life is gray to friendless girls.\" The pardon she wanted was for\npretending to her daughter that women should act thus.\n\nI am sure she felt herself soiled.\n\nBut men are of a coarser clay. At least I am, and nearly twenty years\nhad elapsed, and here was I burdened under a load of affection, like a\nsack of returned love-letters, with no lap into which to dump them.\n\n\"They were all written to another woman, ma'am, and yet I am in hopes\nthat you will find something in them about yourself.\" It would have\nsounded oddly to Mary, but life is gray to friendless girls, and\nsomething might have come of it.\n\nOn the other hand, it would have brought her for ever out of the wood of\nthe little hut, and I had but to drop the letter to send them both back\nthere. The easiness of it tempted me.\n\nBesides, she would tire of me when I was really known to her. They all\ndo, you see.\n\nAnd, after all, why should he lose his laugh because I had lost my\nsmile?\n\nAnd then, again, the whole thing was merely a whimsical idea.\n\nI dropped the letter, and shouldered my burden.\n\n\n\n\nXI. The Runaway Perambulator\n\nI sometimes met David in public places such as the Kensington Gardens,\nwhere he lorded it surrounded by his suite and wearing the blank face\nand glass eyes of all carriage-people. On these occasions I always\nstalked by, meditating on higher things, though Mary seemed to think me\nvery hardhearted, and Irene, who had become his nurse (I forget how,\nbut fear I had something to do with it), ran after me with messages,\nas, would I not call and see him in his home at twelve o'clock, at which\nmoment, it seemed, he was at his best.\n\nNo, I would not.\n\n\"He says tick-tack to the clock,\" Irene said, trying to snare me.\n\n\"Pooh!\" said I.\n\n\"Other little 'uns jest says 'tick-tick,'\" she told me, with a flush of\npride.\n\n\"I prefer 'tick-tick,'\" I said, whereat she departed in dudgeon.\n\nHad they had the sense to wheel him behind a tree and leave him, I would\nhave looked, but as they lacked it, I decided to wait until he could\nwalk, when it would be more easy to waylay him. However, he was a\ncautious little gorbal who, after many threats to rise, always seemed to\ncome to the conclusion that he might do worse than remain where he was,\nand when he had completed his first year I lost patience with him.\n\n\"When I was his age,\" I said to Irene, \"I was running about.\" I\nconsulted them casually about this matter at the club, and they had all\nbeen running about at a year old.\n\nI made this nurse the following offer: If she would bring the dilatory\nboy to my rooms and leave him there for half an hour I would look at\nhim. At first Mary, to whom the offer was passed on, rejected it with\nhauteur, but presently she wavered, and the upshot was that Irene,\nlooking scornful and anxious, arrived one day with the perambulator.\nWithout casting eyes on its occupant, I pointed Irene to the door: \"In\nhalf-an-hour,\" I said.\n\nShe begged permission to remain, and promised to turn her back, and so\non, but I was obdurate, and she then delivered herself of a passionately\naffectionate farewell to her charge, which was really all directed\nagainst me, and ended with these powerful words: \"And if he takes off\nyour socks, my pretty, may he be blasted for evermore.\"\n\n\"I shall probably take off her socks,\" I said carelessly to this.\n\nHer socks. Do you see what made Irene scream?\n\n\"It is a girl, is it not?\" I asked, thus neatly depriving her of\ncoherent speech as I pushed her to the door. I then turned round to--to\nbegin, and, after reflecting, I began by sitting down behind the hood of\nhis carriage. My plan was to accustom him to his new surroundings before\nbursting on the scene myself.\n\nI had various thoughts. Was he awake? If not, better let him\nwake naturally. Half-an-hour was a long time. Why had I not said\nquarter-of-an-hour? Anon, I saw that if I was to sit there much longer I\nshould have said an hour, so I whistled softly; but he took no notice.\nI remember trying to persuade myself that if I never budged till Irene's\nreturn, it would be an amusing triumph over Mary. I coughed, but still\nthere was no response. Abruptly, the fear smote me. Perhaps he is not\nthere.\n\nI rose hastily, and was striding forward, when I distinctly noticed a\ncovert movement somewhere near the middle of the carriage, and heard a\nlow gurgle, which was instantly suppressed. I stopped dead at this sharp\nreminder that I was probably not the only curious person in the room,\nand for a long moment we both lay low, after which, I am glad to\nremember, I made the first advance. Earlier in the day I had arranged\nsome likely articles on a side-table: my watch and chain, my bunch of\nkeys, and two war-medals for plodding merit, and with a glance at these\n(as something to fall back upon), I stepped forward doggedly, looking\n(I fear now) a little like a professor of legerdemain. David was sitting\nup, and he immediately fixed his eyes on me.\n\nIt would ill become me to attempt to describe this dear boy to you,\nfor of course I know really nothing about children, so I shall say only\nthis, that I thought him very like what Timothy would have been had he\never had a chance.\n\nI to whom David had been brought for judgment, now found myself being\njudged by him, and this rearrangement of the pieces seemed so natural\nthat I felt no surprise; I felt only a humble craving to hear him\nsignify that I would do. I have stood up before other keen judges and\ndeceived them all, but I made no effort to deceive David; I wanted to,\nbut dared not. Those unblinking eyes were too new to the world to be\nhooded by any of its tricks. In them I saw my true self. They opened for\nme that pedler's pack of which I have made so much ado, and I found\nthat it was weighted less with pretty little sad love-tokens than with\nignoble thoughts and deeds and an unguided life. I looked dejectedly at\nDavid, not so much, I think, because I had such a sorry display for him,\nas because I feared he would not have me in his service. I seemed to\nknow that he was making up his mind once and for all.\n\nAnd in the end he smiled, perhaps only because I looked so frightened,\nbut the reason scarcely mattered to me, I felt myself a fine fellow at\nonce. It was a long smile, too, opening slowly to its fullest extent (as\nif to let me in), and then as slowly shutting.\n\nThen, to divert me from sad thoughts, or to rivet our friendship, or\nbecause the time had come for each of us to show the other what he could\ndo, he immediately held one foot high in the air. This made him slide\ndown the perambulator, and I saw at once that it was very necessary to\nreplace him. But never before had I come into such close contact with\na child; the most I had ever done was, when they were held up to me, to\nshut my eyes and kiss a vacuum. David, of course, though no doubt he\nwas eternally being replaced, could tell as little as myself how it\nwas contrived, and yet we managed it between us quite easily. His\nbody instinctively assumed a certain position as I touched him, which\ncompelled my arms to fall into place, and the thing was done. I felt\nabsurdly pleased, but he was already considering what he should do next.\n\nHe again held up his foot, which had a gouty appearance owing to\nits being contained in a dumpy little worsted sock, and I thought he\nproposed to repeat his first performance, but in this I did him an\ninjustice, for, unlike Porthos, he was one who scorned to do the same\nfeat twice; perhaps, like the conjurors, he knew that the audience were\nmore on the alert the second time.\n\nI discovered that he wanted me to take off his sock!\n\nRemembering Irene's dread warnings on this subject I must say that I\nfelt uneasy. Had he heard her, and was he daring me? And what dire thing\ncould happen if the sock was removed? I sought to reason with him, but\nhe signed to me to look sharp, and I removed the sock. The part of him\nthus revealed gave David considerable pleasure, but I noticed, as a\ncurious thing, that he seemed to have no interest in the other foot.\n\nHowever, it was not there merely to be looked at, for after giving me\na glance which said \"Now observe!\" he raised his bare foot and ran his\nmouth along the toes, like one playing on a barbaric instrument. He then\ntossed his foot aside, smiled his long triumphant smile and intimated\nthat it was now my turn to do something. I thought the best thing I\ncould do would be to put his sock on him again, but as soon as I tried\nto do so I discovered why Irene had warned me so portentously against\ntaking it off. I should say that she had trouble in socking him every\nmorning.\n\nNevertheless I managed to slip it on while he was debating what to do\nwith my watch. I bitterly regretted that I could do nothing with it\nmyself, put it under a wine-glass, for instance, and make it turn into\na rabbit, which so many people can do. In the meantime David, occupied\nwith similar thoughts, very nearly made it disappear altogether, and I\nwas thankful to be able to pull it back by the chain.\n\n\"Haw-haw-haw!\"\n\nThus he commented on his new feat, but it was also a reminder to me, a\ntrifle cruel, that he was not my boy. After all, you see, Mary had not\ngiven him the whole of his laugh. The watch said that five and twenty\nminutes had passed, and looking out I saw Irene at one end of the street\nstaring up at my window, and at the other end Mary's husband staring up\nat my window, and beneath me Mary staring up at my window. They had all\nbroken their promise.\n\nI returned to David, and asked him in a low voice whether he would give\nme a kiss. He shook his head about six times, and I was in despair. Then\nthe smile came, and I knew that he was teasing me only. He now nodded\nhis head about six times.\n\nThis was the prettiest of all his exploits. It was so pretty that,\ncontrary to his rule, he repeated it. I had held out my arms to him, and\nfirst he shook his head, and then after a long pause (to frighten me),\nhe nodded it.\n\nBut no sooner was he in my arms than I seemed to see Mary and her\nhusband and Irene bearing down upon my chambers to take him from me, and\nacting under an impulse I whipped him into the perambulator and was off\nwith it without a license down the back staircase. To the Kensington\nGardens we went; it may have been Manitoba we started for, but we\narrived at the Kensington Gardens, and it had all been so unpremeditated\nand smartly carried out that I remember clapping my hand to my head in\nthe street, to make sure that I was wearing a hat.\n\nI watched David to see what he thought of it, and he had not yet made\nup his mind. Strange to say, I no longer felt shy. I was grown\nsuddenly indifferent to public comment, and my elation increased when\nI discovered that I was being pursued. They drew a cordon round me near\nMargot Meredith's tree, but I broke through it by a strategic movement\nto the south, and was next heard of in the Baby's Walk. They held both\nends of this passage, and then thought to close on me, but I slipped\nthrough their fingers by doubling up Bunting's Thumb into Picnic Street.\nCowering at St. Govor's Well, we saw them rush distractedly up the Hump,\nand when they had crossed to the Round Pond we paraded gaily in the\nBroad Walk, not feeling the tiniest bit sorry for anybody.\n\nHere, however, it gradually came into David's eyes that, after all, I\nwas a strange man, and they opened wider and wider, until they were the\nsize of my medals, and then, with the deliberation that distinguishes\nhis smile, he slowly prepared to howl. I saw all his forces gathering\nin his face, and I had nothing to oppose to them; it was an unarmed man\nagainst a regiment.\n\nEven then I did not chide him. He could not know that it was I who had\ndropped the letter.\n\nI think I must have stepped over a grateful fairy at that moment, for\nwho else could have reminded me so opportunely of my famous manipulation\nof the eyebrows, forgotten since I was in the fifth form? I alone of\nboys had been able to elevate and lower my eyebrows separately; when\nthe one was climbing my forehead the other descended it, like the two\nbuckets in the well.\n\nMost diffidently did I call this accomplishment to my aid now, and\nimmediately David checked his forces and considered my unexpected\nmovement without prejudice. His face remained as it was, his mouth open\nto emit the howl if I did not surpass expectation. I saw that, like the\nfair-minded boy he has always been, he was giving me my chance, and\nI worked feverishly, my chief fear being that, owing to his youth,\nhe might not know how marvellous was this thing I was doing. It is an\nappeal to the intellect, as well as to the senses, and no one on earth\ncan do it except myself.\n\nWhen I paused for a moment exhausted he signed gravely, with unchanged\nface, that though it was undeniably funny, he had not yet decided\nwhether it was funny enough, and, taking this for encouragement, at it\nI went once more, till I saw his forces wavering, when I sent my left\neyebrow up almost farther than I could bring it back, and with that I\nhad him, the smile broke through the clouds.\n\nIn the midst of my hard-won triumph I heard cheering.\n\nI had been vaguely conscious that we were not quite alone, but had not\ndared to look away from David; I looked now, and found to my annoyance\nthat I was the centre of a deeply interested gathering of children.\nThere was, in particular, one vulgar little street-boy--\n\nHowever, if that damped me in the moment of victory, I was soon to\ntriumph gloriously in what began like defeat. I had sat me down on one\nof the garden-seats in the Figs, with one hand resting carelessly on the\nperambulator, in imitation of the nurses, it was so pleasant to assume\nthe air of one who walked with David daily, when to my chagrin I saw\nMary approaching with quick stealthy steps, and already so near me that\nflight would have been ignominy. Porthos, of whom she had hold, bounded\ntoward me, waving his traitorous tail, but she slowed on seeing that I\nhad observed her. She had run me down with my own dog.\n\nI have not mentioned that Porthos had for some time now been a visitor\nat her house, though never can I forget the shock I got the first time\nI saw him strolling out of it like an afternoon caller. Of late he has\navoided it, crossing to the other side when I go that way, and rejoining\nme farther on, so I conclude that Mary's husband is painting him.\n\nI waited her coming stiffly, in great depression of spirits, and noted\nthat her first attentions were for David, who, somewhat shabbily, gave\nher the end of a smile which had been begun for me. It seemed to relieve\nher, for what one may call the wild maternal look left her face, and\ntrying to check little gasps of breath, the result of unseemly running,\nshe signed to her confederates to remain in the background, and turned\ncurious eyes on me. Had she spoken as she approached, I am sure her\nwords would have been as flushed as her face, but now her mouth puckered\nas David's does before he sets forth upon his smile, and I saw that she\nthought she had me in a parley at last.\n\n\"I could not help being a little anxious,\" she said craftily, but I must\nown, with some sweetness.\n\nI merely raised my hat, and at that she turned quickly to David--I\ncannot understand why the movement was so hasty--and lowered her face\nto his. Oh, little trump of a boy! Instead of kissing her, he seized her\nface with one hand and tried to work her eyebrows up and down with the\nother. He failed, and his obvious disappointment in his mother was as\nnectar to me.\n\n\"I don't understand what you want, darling,\" said she in distress, and\nlooked at me inquiringly, and I understood what he wanted, and let\nher see that I understood. Had I been prepared to converse with her, I\nshould have said elatedly that, had she known what he wanted, still she\ncould not have done it, though she had practised for twenty years.\n\nI tried to express all this by another movement of my hat.\n\nIt caught David's eye and at once he appealed to me with the most\nperfect confidence. She failed to see what I did, for I shyly gave her\nmy back, but the effect on David was miraculous; he signed to her to go,\nfor he was engaged for the afternoon.\n\nWhat would you have done then, reader? I didn't. In my great moment I\nhad strength of character to raise my hat for the third time and walk\naway, leaving the child to judge between us. I walked slowly, for I knew\nI must give him time to get it out, and I listened eagerly, but that\nwas unnecessary, for when it did come it was a very roar of anguish. I\nturned my head, and saw David fiercely pushing the woman aside, that he\nmight have one last long look at me. He held out his wistful arms and\nnodded repeatedly, and I faltered, but my glorious scheme saved me,\nand I walked on. It was a scheme conceived in a flash, and ever since\nrelentlessly pursued, to burrow under Mary's influence with the boy,\nexpose her to him in all her vagaries, take him utterly from her and\nmake him mine.\n\n\n\n\nXII. The Pleasantest Club in London\n\nAll perambulators lead to the Kensington Gardens.\n\nNot, however, that you will see David in his perambulator much longer,\nfor soon after I first shook his faith in his mother, it came to him to\nbe up and doing, and he up and did in the Broad Walk itself, where he\nwould stand alone most elaborately poised, signing imperiously to the\nBritish public to time him, and looking his most heavenly just before he\nfell. He fell with a dump, and as they always laughed then, he pretended\nthat this was his funny way of finishing.\n\nThat was on a Monday. On Tuesday he climbed the stone stair of the\nGold King, looking over his shoulder gloriously at each step, and\non Wednesday he struck three and went into knickerbockers. For the\nKensington Gardens, you must know, are full of short cuts, familiar to\nall who play there; and the shortest leads from the baby in long\nclothes to the little boy of three riding on the fence. It is called the\nMother's Tragedy.\n\nIf you are a burgess of the gardens (which have a vocabulary of their\nown), the faces of these quaint mothers are a clock to you, in which you\nmay read the ages of their young. When he is three they are said to wear\nthe knickerbocker face, and you may take it from me that Mary assumed\nthat face with a sigh; fain would she have kept her boy a baby longer,\nbut he insisted on his rights, and I encouraged him that I might notch\nanother point against her. I was now seeing David once at least every\nweek, his mother, who remained culpably obtuse to my sinister design,\nhaving instructed Irene that I was to be allowed to share him with her,\nand we had become close friends, though the little nurse was ever a\nthreatening shadow in the background. Irene, in short, did not improve\nwith acquaintance. I found her to be high and mighty, chiefly, I think,\nbecause she now wore a nurse's cap with streamers, of which the little\ncreature was ludicrously proud. She assumed the airs of an official\nperson, and always talked as if generations of babies had passed through\nher hands. She was also extremely jealous, and had a way of signifying\ndisapproval of my methods that led to many coldnesses and even\nbickerings between us, which I now see to have been undignified. I\nbrought the following accusations against her:\n\nThat she prated too much about right and wrong.\n\nThat she was a martinet.\n\nThat she pretended it was a real cap, with real streamers, when she knew\nMary had made the whole thing out of a muslin blind. I regret having\nused this argument, but it was the only one that really damped her.\n\nOn the other hand, she accused me of spoiling him.\n\nOf not thinking of his future.\n\nOf never asking him where he expected to go to if he did such things.\n\nOf telling him tales that had no moral application.\n\nOf saying that the handkerchief disappeared into nothingness, when it\nreally disappeared into a small tin cup, attached to my person by a\npiece of elastic.\n\nTo this last charge I plead guilty, for in those days I had a pathetic\nfaith in legerdemain, and the eyebrow feat (which, however, is entirely\nan affair of skill) having yielded such good results, I naturally cast\nabout for similar diversions when it ceased to attract. It lost its hold\non David suddenly, as I was to discover was the fate of all of them;\ntwenty times would he call for my latest, and exult in it, and the\ntwenty-first time (and ever afterward) he would stare blankly, as if\nwondering what the man meant. He was like the child queen who, when the\ngreat joke was explained to her, said coldly, \"We are not amused,\" and,\nI assure you, it is a humiliating thing to perform before an infant who\nintimates, after giving you ample time to make your points, that he is\nnot amused. I hoped that when David was able to talk--and not merely\nto stare at me for five minutes and then say \"hat\"--his spoken verdict,\nhowever damning, would be less expressive than his verdict without\nwords, but I was disillusioned. I remember once in those later years,\nwhen he could keep up such spirited conversations with himself that he\nhad little need for any of us, promising him to do something exceedingly\nfunny with a box and two marbles, and after he had watched for a long\ntime he said gravely, \"Tell me when it begins to be funny.\"\n\nI confess to having received a few simple lessons in conjuring, in a\ndimly lighted chamber beneath a shop, from a gifted young man with a\nlong neck and a pimply face, who as I entered took a barber's pole from\nmy pocket, saying at the same time, \"Come, come, sir, this will never\ndo.\" Whether because he knew too much, or because he wore a trick shirt,\nhe was the most depressing person I ever encountered; he felt none of\nthe artist's joy, and it was sad to see one so well calculated to give\npleasure to thousands not caring a dump about it.\n\nThe barber's pole I successfully extracted from David's mouth, but the\ndifficulty (not foreseen) of knowing how to dispose of a barber's pole\nin the Kensington Gardens is considerable, there always being polite\nchildren hovering near who run after you and restore it to you. The\nyoung man, again, had said that anyone would lend me a bottle or a\nlemon, but though these were articles on which he seemed ever able to\nlay his hand, I found (what I had never noticed before) that there is\na curious dearth of them in the Gardens. The magic egg-cup I usually\ncarried about with me, and with its connivance I did some astonishing\nthings with pennies, but even the penny that costs sixpence is\nuncertain, and just when you are saying triumphantly that it will\nbe found in the egg-cup, it may clatter to the ground, whereon some\nungenerous spectator, such as Irene, accuses you of fibbing and\ncorrupting youthful minds. It was useless to tell her, through clenched\nteeth, that the whole thing was a joke, for she understood no jokes\nexcept her own, of which she had the most immoderately high opinion,\nand that would have mattered little to me had not David liked them also.\nThere were times when I could not but think less of the boy, seeing\nhim rock convulsed over antics of Irene that have been known to every\nnursemaid since the year One. While I stood by, sneering, he would give\nme the ecstatic look that meant, \"Irene is really very entertaining,\nisn't she?\"\n\nWe were rivals, but I desire to treat her with scrupulous fairness, and\nI admit that she had one good thing, to wit, her gutta-percha tooth. In\nearlier days one of her front teeth, as she told me, had fallen out, but\ninstead of then parting with it, the resourceful child had hammered it\nin again with a hair-brush, which she offered to show me, with the dents\non it. This tooth, having in time passed away, its place was supplied by\none of gutta-percha, made by herself, which seldom came out except when\nshe sneezed, and if it merely fell at her feet this was a sign that the\ncold was to be a slight one, but if it shot across the room she knew she\nwas in for something notable. Irene's tooth was very favourably known\nin the Gardens, where the perambulators used to gather round her to hear\nwhether it had been doing anything to-day, and I would not have grudged\nDavid his proprietary pride in it, had he seemed to understand that\nIrene's one poor little accomplishment, though undeniably showy, was\nwithout intellectual merit. I have sometimes stalked away from him,\nintimating that if his regard was to be got so cheaply I begged to\nretire from the competition, but the Gardens are the pleasantest club in\nLondon, and I soon returned. How I scoured the Gardens looking for him,\nand how skilful I became at picking him out far away among the trees,\nthough other mothers imitated the picturesque attire of him, to Mary's\nindignation. I also cut Irene's wings (so to speak) by taking her to a\ndentist.\n\nAnd David did some adorable things. For instance, he used my pockets as\nreceptacles into which he put any article he might not happen to want\nat the moment. He shoved it in, quite as if they were his own pockets,\nwithout saying, By your leave, and perhaps I discovered it on reaching\nhome--a tin-soldier, or a pistol--when I put it on my mantle-shelf\nand sighed. And here is another pleasant memory. One day I had been\nover-friendly to another boy, and, after enduring it for some time David\nup and struck him. It was exactly as Porthos does, when I favour other\ndogs (he knocks them down with his foot and stands over them, looking\nvery noble and stern), so I knew its meaning at once; it was David's\nfirst public intimation that he knew I belonged to him.\n\nIrene scolded him for striking that boy, and made him stand in disgrace\nat the corner of a seat in the Broad Walk. The seat at the corner of\nwhich David stood suffering for love of me, is the one nearest to the\nRound Pond to persons coming from the north.\n\nYou may be sure that she and I had words over this fiendish cruelty.\nWhen next we met I treated her as one who no longer existed, and at\nfirst she bridled and then was depressed, and as I was going away she\nburst into tears. She cried because neither at meeting nor parting had\nI lifted my hat to her, a foolish custom of mine, of which, as I now\nlearned to my surprise, she was very proud. She and I still have our\ntiffs, but I have never since then forgotten to lift my hat to Irene.\nI also made her promise to bow to me, at which she affected to scoff,\nsaying I was taking my fun of her, but she was really pleased, and I\ntell you, Irene has one of the prettiest and most touching little bows\nimaginable; it is half to the side (if I may so express myself), which\nhas always been my favourite bow, and, I doubt not, she acquired it by\nwatching Mary.\n\nI should be sorry to have it thought, as you may now be thinking, that I\nlook on children as on puppy-dogs, who care only for play. Perhaps that\nwas my idea when first I tried to lure David to my unaccustomed arms,\nand even for some time after, for if I am to be candid, I must own that\nuntil he was three years old I sought merely to amuse him. God forgive\nme, but I had only one day a week in which to capture him, and I was\nvery raw at the business.\n\nI was about to say that David opened my eyes to the folly of it, but\nreally I think this was Irene's doing. Watching her with children I\nlearned that partial as they are to fun they are moved almost more\nprofoundly by moral excellence. So fond of babes was this little mother\nthat she had always room near her for one more, and often have I seen\nher in the Gardens, the centre of a dozen mites who gazed awestruck at\nher while she told them severely how little ladies and gentlemen behave.\nThey were children of the well-to-pass, and she was from Drury Lane, but\nthey believed in her as the greatest of all authorities on little ladies\nand gentlemen, and the more they heard of how these romantic creatures\nkeep themselves tidy and avoid pools and wait till they come to a gate,\nthe more they admired them, though their faces showed how profoundly\nthey felt that to be little ladies and gentlemen was not for them. You\ncan't think what hopeless little faces they were.\n\nChildren are not at all like puppies, I have said. But do puppies care\nonly for play? That wistful look, which the merriest of them sometimes\nwear, I wonder whether it means that they would like to hear about the\ngood puppies?\n\nAs you shall see, I invented many stories for David, practising the\ntelling of them by my fireside as if they were conjuring feats, while\nIrene knew only one, but she told it as never has any other fairy-tale\nbeen told in my hearing. It was the prettiest of them all, and was\nrecited by the heroine.\n\n\"Why were the king and queen not at home?\" David would ask her\nbreathlessly.\n\n\"I suppose,\" said Irene, thinking it out, \"they was away buying the\nvictuals.\"\n\nShe always told the story gazing into vacancy, so that David thought it\nwas really happening somewhere up the Broad Walk, and when she came\nto its great moments her little bosom heaved. Never shall I forget the\nconcentrated scorn with which the prince said to the sisters, \"Neither\nof you ain't the one what wore the glass slipper.\"\n\n\"And then--and then--and then--,\" said Irene, not artistically to\nincrease the suspense, but because it was all so glorious to her.\n\n\"Tell me--tell me quick,\" cried David, though he knew the tale by heart.\n\n\"She sits down like,\" said Irene, trembling in second-sight, \"and she\ntries on the glass slipper, and it fits her to a T, and then the prince,\nhe cries in a ringing voice, 'This here is my true love, Cinderella,\nwhat now I makes my lawful wedded wife.'\"\n\nThen she would come out of her dream, and look round at the grandees of\nthe Gardens with an extraordinary elation. \"Her, as was only a kitchen\ndrudge,\" she would say in a strange soft voice and with shining eyes,\n\"but was true and faithful in word and deed, such was her reward.\"\n\nI am sure that had the fairy godmother appeared just then and touched\nIrene with her wand, David would have been interested rather than\nastonished. As for myself, I believe I have surprised this little girl's\nsecret. She knows there are no fairy godmothers nowadays, but she hopes\nthat if she is always true and faithful she may some day turn into a\nlady in word and deed, like the mistress whom she adores.\n\nIt is a dead secret, a Drury Lane child's romance; but what an amount of\nheavy artillery will be brought to bear against it in this sad London of\nours. Not much chance for her, I suppose.\n\nGood luck to you, Irene.\n\n\n\n\nXIII. The Grand Tour of the Gardens\n\nYou must see for yourselves that it will be difficult to follow our\nadventures unless you are familiar with the Kensington Gardens, as they\nnow became known to David. They are in London, where the King lives, and\nyou go to them every day unless you are looking decidedly flushed, but\nno one has ever been in the whole of the Gardens, because it is so soon\ntime to turn back. The reason it is soon time to turn back is that you\nsleep from twelve to one. If your mother was not so sure that you sleep\nfrom twelve to one, you could most likely see the whole of them.\n\nThe Gardens are bounded on one side by a never-ending line of omnibuses,\nover which Irene has such authority that if she holds up her finger\nto any one of them it stops immediately. She then crosses with you in\nsafety to the other side. There are more gates to the Gardens than one\ngate, but that is the one you go in at, and before you go in you speak\nto the lady with the balloons, who sits just outside. This is as near to\nbeing inside as she may venture, because, if she were to let go her hold\nof the railings for one moment, the balloons would lift her up, and she\nwould be flown away. She sits very squat, for the balloons are always\ntugging at her, and the strain has given her quite a red face. Once she\nwas a new one, because the old one had let go, and David was very sorry\nfor the old one, but as she did let go, he wished he had been there to\nsee.\n\nThe Gardens are a tremendous big place, with millions and hundreds of\ntrees, and first you come to the Figs, but you scorn to loiter there,\nfor the Figs is the resort of superior little persons, who are forbidden\nto mix with the commonalty, and is so named, according to legend,\nbecause they dress in full fig. These dainty ones are themselves\ncontemptuously called Figs by David and other heroes, and you have a key\nto the manners and customs of this dandiacal section of the Gardens when\nI tell you that cricket is called crickets here. Occasionally a rebel\nFig climbs over the fence into the world, and such a one was Miss Mabel\nGrey, of whom I shall tell you when we come to Miss Mabel Grey's gate.\nShe was the only really celebrated Fig.\n\nWe are now in the Broad Walk, and it is as much bigger than the other\nwalks as your father is bigger than you. David wondered if it began\nlittle, and grew and grew, till it was quite grown up, and whether the\nother walks are its babies, and he drew a picture, which diverted\nhim very much, of the Broad Walk giving a tiny walk an airing in a\nperambulator. In the Broad Walk you meet all the people who are worth\nknowing, and there is usually a grown-up with them to prevent their\ngoing on the damp grass, and to make them stand disgraced at the corner\nof a seat if they have been mad-dog or Mary-Annish. To be Mary-Annish\nis to behave like a girl, whimpering because nurse won't carry you, or\nsimpering with your thumb in your mouth, and it is a hateful quality,\nbut to be mad-dog is to kick out at everything, and there is some\nsatisfaction in that.\n\nIf I were to point out all the notable places as we pass up the Broad\nWalk, it would be time to turn back before we reach them, and I simply\nwave my stick at Cecco's Tree, that memorable spot where a boy called\nCecco lost his penny, and, looking for it, found twopence. There has\nbeen a good deal of excavation going on there ever since. Farther up the\nwalk is the little wooden house in which Marmaduke Perry hid. There is\nno more awful story of the Gardens by day than this of Marmaduke Perry,\nwho had been Mary-Annish three days in succession, and was sentenced to\nappear in the Broad Walk dressed in his sister's clothes. He hid in\nthe little wooden house, and refused to emerge until they brought him\nknickerbockers with pockets.\n\nYou now try to go to the Round Pond, but nurses hate it, because they\nare not really manly, and they make you look the other way, at the Big\nPenny and the Baby's Palace. She was the most celebrated baby of the\nGardens, and lived in the palace all alone, with ever so many dolls, so\npeople rang the bell, and up she got out of her bed, though it was past\nsix o'clock, and she lighted a candle and opened the door in her nighty,\nand then they all cried with great rejoicings, \"Hail, Queen of England!\"\nWhat puzzled David most was how she knew where the matches were kept.\nThe Big Penny is a statue about her.\n\nNext we come to the Hump, which is the part of the Broad Walk where all\nthe big races are run, and even though you had no intention of running\nyou do run when you come to the Hump, it is such a fascinating,\nslide-down kind of place. Often you stop when you have run about\nhalf-way down it, and then you are lost, but there is another little\nwooden house near here, called the Lost House, and so you tell the man\nthat you are lost and then he finds you. It is glorious fun racing down\nthe Hump, but you can't do it on windy days because then you are not\nthere, but the fallen leaves do it instead of you. There is almost\nnothing that has such a keen sense of fun as a fallen leaf.\n\nFrom the Hump we can see the gate that is called after Miss Mabel Grey,\nthe Fig I promised to tell you about. There were always two nurses with\nher, or else one mother and one nurse, and for a long time she was a\npattern-child who always coughed off the table and said, \"How do you\ndo?\" to the other Figs, and the only game she played at was flinging a\nball gracefully and letting the nurse bring it back to her. Then one\nday she tired of it all and went mad-dog, and, first, to show that she\nreally was mad-dog, she unloosened both her boot-laces and put out her\ntongue east, west, north, and south. She then flung her sash into a\npuddle and danced on it till dirty water was squirted over her frock,\nafter which she climbed the fence and had a series of incredible\nadventures, one of the least of which was that she kicked off both her\nboots. At last she came to the gate that is now called after her, out of\nwhich she ran into streets David and I have never been in though we have\nheard them roaring, and still she ran on and would never again have been\nheard of had not her mother jumped into a bus and thus overtaken her.\nIt all happened, I should say, long ago, and this is not the Mabel Grey\nwhom David knows.\n\nReturning up the Broad Walk we have on our right the Baby Walk, which is\nso full of perambulators that you could cross from side to side stepping\non babies, but the nurses won't let you do it. From this walk a passage\ncalled Bunting's Thumb, because it is that length, leads into Picnic\nStreet, where there are real kettles, and chestnut-blossom falls into\nyour mug as you are drinking. Quite common children picnic here also,\nand the blossom falls into their mugs just the same.\n\nNext comes St. Govor's Well, which was full of water when Malcolm the\nBold fell into it. He was his mother's favourite, and he let her put her\narm round his neck in public because she was a widow, but he was also\npartial to adventures and liked to play with a chimney-sweep who had\nkilled a good many bears. The sweep's name was Sooty, and one day when\nthey were playing near the well, Malcolm fell in and would have been\ndrowned had not Sooty dived in and rescued him, and the water had washed\nSooty clean and he now stood revealed as Malcolm's long-lost father. So\nMalcolm would not let his mother put her arm round his neck any more.\n\nBetween the well and the Round Pond are the cricket-pitches, and\nfrequently the choosing of sides exhausts so much time that there is\nscarcely any cricket. Everybody wants to bat first, and as soon as he\nis out he bowls unless you are the better wrestler, and while you are\nwrestling with him the fielders have scattered to play at something\nelse. The Gardens are noted for two kinds of cricket: boy cricket, which\nis real cricket with a bat, and girl cricket, which is with a racquet\nand the governess. Girls can't really play cricket, and when you\nare watching their futile efforts you make funny sounds at them.\nNevertheless, there was a very disagreeable incident one day when some\nforward girls challenged David's team, and a disturbing creature called\nAngela Clare sent down so many yorkers that--However, instead of telling\nyou the result of that regrettable match I shall pass on hurriedly to\nthe Round Pond, which is the wheel that keeps all the Gardens going.\n\nIt is round because it is in the very middle of the Gardens, and when\nyou are come to it you never want to go any farther. You can't be good\nall the time at the Round Pond, however much you try. You can be good in\nthe Broad Walk all the time, but not at the Round Pond, and the reason\nis that you forget, and, when you remember, you are so wet that you may\nas well be wetter. There are men who sail boats on the Round Pond,\nsuch big boats that they bring them in barrows and sometimes in\nperambulators, and then the baby has to walk. The bow-legged children\nin the Gardens are these who had to walk too soon because their father\nneeded the perambulator.\n\nYou always want to have a yacht to sail on the Round Pond, and in the\nend your uncle gives you one; and to carry it to the Pond the first\nday is splendid, also to talk about it to boys who have no uncle is\nsplendid, but soon you like to leave it at home. For the sweetest\ncraft that slips her moorings in the Round Pond is what is called a\nstick-boat, because she is rather like a stick until she is in the water\nand you are holding the string. Then as you walk round, pulling her,\nyou see little men running about her deck, and sails rise magically and\ncatch the breeze, and you put in on dirty nights at snug harbours which\nare unknown to the lordly yachts. Night passes in a twink, and again\nyour rakish craft noses for the wind, whales spout, you glide over\nburied cities, and have brushes with pirates and cast anchor on coral\nisles. You are a solitary boy while all this is taking place, for two\nboys together cannot adventure far upon the Round Pond, and though you\nmay talk to yourself throughout the voyage, giving orders and executing\nthem with dispatch, you know not, when it is time to go home, where you\nhave been or what swelled your sails; your treasure-trove is all locked\naway in your hold, so to speak, which will be opened, perhaps, by\nanother little boy many years afterward.\n\nBut those yachts have nothing in their hold. Does anyone return to this\nhaunt of his youth because of the yachts that used to sail it? Oh, no.\nIt is the stick-boat that is freighted with memories. The yachts are\ntoys, their owner a fresh-water mariner, they can cross and recross\na pond only while the stick-boat goes to sea. You yachtsmen with your\nwands, who think we are all there to gaze on you, your ships are only\naccidents of this place, and were they all to be boarded and sunk by the\nducks the real business of the Round Pond would be carried on as usual.\n\nPaths from everywhere crowd like children to the pond. Some of them are\nordinary paths, which have a rail on each side, and are made by men\nwith their coats off, but others are vagrants, wide at one spot and at\nanother so narrow that you can stand astride them. They are called Paths\nthat have Made Themselves, and David did wish he could see them doing\nit. But, like all the most wonderful things that happen in the Gardens,\nit is done, we concluded, at night after the gates are closed. We have\nalso decided that the paths make themselves because it is their only\nchance of getting to the Round Pond.\n\nOne of these gypsy paths comes from the place where the sheep get their\nhair cut. When David shed his curls at the hair-dresser's, I am told, he\nsaid good-bye to them without a tremor, though Mary has never been quite\nthe same bright creature since, so he despises the sheep as they run\nfrom their shearer and calls out tauntingly, \"Cowardy, cowardy custard!\"\nBut when the man grips them between his legs David shakes a fist at him\nfor using such big scissors. Another startling moment is when the man\nturns back the grimy wool from the sheeps' shoulders and they look\nsuddenly like ladies in the stalls of a theatre. The sheep are so\nfrightened by the shearing that it makes them quite white and thin, and\nas soon as they are set free they begin to nibble the grass at once,\nquite anxiously, as if they feared that they would never be worth\neating. David wonders whether they know each other, now that they are\nso different, and if it makes them fight with the wrong ones. They are\ngreat fighters, and thus so unlike country sheep that every year they\ngive Porthos a shock. He can make a field of country sheep fly by merely\nannouncing his approach, but these town sheep come toward him with no\npromise of gentle entertainment, and then a light from last year breaks\nupon Porthos. He cannot with dignity retreat, but he stops and looks\nabout him as if lost in admiration of the scenery, and presently he\nstrolls away with a fine indifference and a glint at me from the corner\nof his eye.\n\nThe Serpentine begins near here. It is a lovely lake, and there is a\ndrowned forest at the bottom of it. If you peer over the edge you can\nsee the trees all growing upside down, and they say that at night there\nare also drowned stars in it. If so, Peter Pan sees them when he is\nsailing across the lake in the Thrush's Nest. A small part only of the\nSerpentine is in the Gardens, for soon it passes beneath a bridge to\nfar away where the island is on which all the birds are born that become\nbaby boys and girls. No one who is human, except Peter Pan (and he is\nonly half human), can land on the island, but you may write what you\nwant (boy or girl, dark or fair) on a piece of paper, and then twist\nit into the shape of a boat and slip it into the water, and it reaches\nPeter Pan's island after dark.\n\nWe are on the way home now, though, of course, it is all pretence that\nwe can go to so many of the places in one day. I should have had to be\ncarrying David long ago and resting on every seat like old Mr. Salford.\nThat was what we called him, because he always talked to us of a lovely\nplace called Salford where he had been born. He was a crab-apple of\nan old gentleman who wandered all day in the Gardens from seat to seat\ntrying to fall in with somebody who was acquainted with the town of\nSalford, and when we had known him for a year or more we actually did\nmeet another aged solitary who had once spent Saturday to Monday in\nSalford. He was meek and timid and carried his address inside his hat,\nand whatever part of London he was in search of he always went to the\nGeneral Post-office first as a starting-point. Him we carried in triumph\nto our other friend, with the story of that Saturday to Monday, and\nnever shall I forget the gloating joy with which Mr. Salford leapt at\nhim. They have been cronies ever since, and I notice that Mr. Salford,\nwho naturally does most of the talking, keeps tight grip of the other\nold man's coat.\n\nThe two last places before you come to our gate are the Dog's Cemetery\nand the chaffinch's nest, but we pretend not to know what the Dog's\nCemetery is, as Porthos is always with us. The nest is very sad. It\nis quite white, and the way we found it was wonderful. We were having\nanother look among the bushes for David's lost worsted ball, and instead\nof the ball we found a lovely nest made of the worsted, and containing\nfour eggs, with scratches on them very like David's handwriting, so we\nthink they must have been the mother's love-letters to the little ones\ninside. Every day we were in the Gardens we paid a call at the nest,\ntaking care that no cruel boy should see us, and we dropped crumbs,\nand soon the bird knew us as friends, and sat in the nest looking at us\nkindly with her shoulders hunched up. But one day when we went, there\nwere only two eggs in the nest, and the next time there were none. The\nsaddest part of it was that the poor little chaffinch fluttered about\nthe bushes, looking so reproachfully at us that we knew she thought we\nhad done it, and though David tried to explain to her, it was so\nlong since he had spoken the bird language that I fear she did not\nunderstand. He and I left the Gardens that day with our knuckles in our\neyes.\n\n\n\n\nXIV. Peter Pan\n\nIf you ask your mother whether she knew about Peter Pan when she was a\nlittle girl she will say, \"Why, of course, I did, child,\" and if you\nask her whether he rode on a goat in those days she will say, \"What\na foolish question to ask; certainly he did.\" Then if you ask your\ngrandmother whether she knew about Peter Pan when she was a girl, she\nalso says, \"Why, of course, I did, child,\" but if you ask her whether he\nrode on a goat in those days, she says she never heard of his having a\ngoat. Perhaps she has forgotten, just as she sometimes forgets your name\nand calls you Mildred, which is your mother's name. Still, she could\nhardly forget such an important thing as the goat. Therefore there was\nno goat when your grandmother was a little girl. This shows that, in\ntelling the story of Peter Pan, to begin with the goat (as most people\ndo) is as silly as to put on your jacket before your vest.\n\nOf course, it also shows that Peter is ever so old, but he is really\nalways the same age, so that does not matter in the least. His age\nis one week, and though he was born so long ago he has never had a\nbirthday, nor is there the slightest chance of his ever having one. The\nreason is that he escaped from being a human when he was seven days'\nold; he escaped by the window and flew back to the Kensington Gardens.\n\nIf you think he was the only baby who ever wanted to escape, it shows\nhow completely you have forgotten your own young days. When David heard\nthis story first he was quite certain that he had never tried to escape,\nbut I told him to think back hard, pressing his hands to his temples,\nand when he had done this hard, and even harder, he distinctly\nremembered a youthful desire to return to the tree-tops, and with that\nmemory came others, as that he had lain in bed planning to escape as\nsoon as his mother was asleep, and how she had once caught him half-way\nup the chimney. All children could have such recollections if they would\npress their hands hard to their temples, for, having been birds before\nthey were human, they are naturally a little wild during the first few\nweeks, and very itchy at the shoulders, where their wings used to be. So\nDavid tells me.\n\nI ought to mention here that the following is our way with a story:\nFirst, I tell it to him, and then he tells it to me, the understanding\nbeing that it is quite a different story; and then I retell it with his\nadditions, and so we go on until no one could say whether it is more\nhis story or mine. In this story of Peter Pan, for instance, the bald\nnarrative and most of the moral reflections are mine, though not all,\nfor this boy can be a stern moralist, but the interesting bits about the\nways and customs of babies in the bird-stage are mostly reminiscences\nof David's, recalled by pressing his hands to his temples and thinking\nhard.\n\nWell, Peter Pan got out by the window, which had no bars. Standing\non the ledge he could see trees far away, which were doubtless the\nKensington Gardens, and the moment he saw them he entirely forgot that\nhe was now a little boy in a nightgown, and away he flew, right over the\nhouses to the Gardens. It is wonderful that he could fly without wings,\nbut the place itched tremendously, and, perhaps we could all fly if we\nwere as dead-confident-sure of our capacity to do it as was bold Peter\nPan that evening.\n\nHe alighted gaily on the open sward, between the Baby's Palace and the\nSerpentine, and the first thing he did was to lie on his back and kick.\nHe was quite unaware already that he had ever been human, and thought he\nwas a bird, even in appearance, just the same as in his early days, and\nwhen he tried to catch a fly he did not understand that the reason he\nmissed it was because he had attempted to seize it with his hand, which,\nof course, a bird never does. He saw, however, that it must be past\nLock-out Time, for there were a good many fairies about, all too busy\nto notice him; they were getting breakfast ready, milking their cows,\ndrawing water, and so on, and the sight of the water-pails made him\nthirsty, so he flew over to the Round Pond to have a drink. He stooped,\nand dipped his beak in the pond; he thought it was his beak, but, of\ncourse, it was only his nose, and, therefore, very little water came up,\nand that not so refreshing as usual, so next he tried a puddle, and he\nfell flop into it. When a real bird falls in flop, he spreads out his\nfeathers and pecks them dry, but Peter could not remember what was\nthe thing to do, and he decided, rather sulkily, to go to sleep on the\nweeping beech in the Baby Walk.\n\nAt first he found some difficulty in balancing himself on a branch, but\npresently he remembered the way, and fell asleep. He awoke long before\nmorning, shivering, and saying to himself, \"I never was out in such a\ncold night;\" he had really been out in colder nights when he was a bird,\nbut, of course, as everybody knows, what seems a warm night to a bird\nis a cold night to a boy in a nightgown. Peter also felt strangely\nuncomfortable, as if his head was stuffy, he heard loud noises that made\nhim look round sharply, though they were really himself sneezing. There\nwas something he wanted very much, but, though he knew he wanted it, he\ncould not think what it was. What he wanted so much was his mother to\nblow his nose, but that never struck him, so he decided to appeal to the\nfairies for enlightenment. They are reputed to know a good deal.\n\nThere were two of them strolling along the Baby Walk, with their arms\nround each other's waists, and he hopped down to address them. The\nfairies have their tiffs with the birds, but they usually give a civil\nanswer to a civil question, and he was quite angry when these two ran\naway the moment they saw him. Another was lolling on a garden-chair,\nreading a postage-stamp which some human had let fall, and when he heard\nPeter's voice he popped in alarm behind a tulip.\n\nTo Peter's bewilderment he discovered that every fairy he met fled from\nhim. A band of workmen, who were sawing down a toadstool, rushed away,\nleaving their tools behind them. A milkmaid turned her pail upside down\nand hid in it. Soon the Gardens were in an uproar. Crowds of fairies\nwere running this away and that, asking each other stoutly, who was\nafraid, lights were extinguished, doors barricaded, and from the grounds\nof Queen Mab's palace came the rubadub of drums, showing that the royal\nguard had been called out. A regiment of Lancers came charging down\nthe Broad Walk, armed with holly-leaves, with which they jog the enemy\nhorribly in passing. Peter heard the little people crying everywhere\nthat there was a human in the Gardens after Lock-out Time, but he never\nthought for a moment that he was the human. He was feeling stuffier and\nstuffier, and more and more wistful to learn what he wanted done to his\nnose, but he pursued them with the vital question in vain; the timid\ncreatures ran from him, and even the Lancers, when he approached them up\nthe Hump, turned swiftly into a side-walk, on the pretence that they saw\nhim there.\n\nDespairing of the fairies, he resolved to consult the birds, but now he\nremembered, as an odd thing, that all the birds on the weeping beech had\nflown away when he alighted on it, and though that had not troubled him\nat the time, he saw its meaning now. Every living thing was shunning\nhim. Poor little Peter Pan, he sat down and cried, and even then he did\nnot know that, for a bird, he was sitting on his wrong part. It is a\nblessing that he did not know, for otherwise he would have lost faith\nin his power to fly, and the moment you doubt whether you can fly, you\ncease forever to be able to do it. The reason birds can fly and we can't\nis simply that they have perfect faith, for to have faith is to have\nwings.\n\nNow, except by flying, no one can reach the island in the Serpentine,\nfor the boats of humans are forbidden to land there, and there\nare stakes round it, standing up in the water, on each of which a\nbird-sentinel sits by day and night. It was to the island that Peter now\nflew to put his strange case before old Solomon Caw, and he alighted on\nit with relief, much heartened to find himself at last at home, as the\nbirds call the island. All of them were asleep, including the sentinels,\nexcept Solomon, who was wide awake on one side, and he listened quietly\nto Peter's adventures, and then told him their true meaning.\n\n\"Look at your night-gown, if you don't believe me,\" Solomon said,\nand with staring eyes Peter looked at his night-gown, and then at the\nsleeping birds. Not one of them wore anything.\n\n\"How many of your toes are thumbs?\" said Solomon a little cruelly, and\nPeter saw to his consternation, that all his toes were fingers. The\nshock was so great that it drove away his cold.\n\n\"Ruffle your feathers,\" said that grim old Solomon, and Peter tried most\ndesperately hard to ruffle his feathers, but he had none. Then he rose\nup, quaking, and for the first time since he stood on the window-ledge,\nhe remembered a lady who had been very fond of him.\n\n\"I think I shall go back to mother,\" he said timidly.\n\n\"Good-bye,\" replied Solomon Caw with a queer look.\n\nBut Peter hesitated. \"Why don't you go?\" the old one asked politely.\n\n\"I suppose,\" said Peter huskily, \"I suppose I can still fly?\"\n\nYou see, he had lost faith.\n\n\"Poor little half-and-half,\" said Solomon, who was not really\nhard-hearted, \"you will never be able to fly again, not even on windy\ndays. You must live here on the island always.\"\n\n\"And never even go to the Kensington Gardens?\" Peter asked tragically.\n\n\"How could you get across?\" said Solomon. He promised very kindly,\nhowever, to teach Peter as many of the bird ways as could be learned by\none of such an awkward shape.\n\n\"Then I sha'n't be exactly a human?\" Peter asked.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Nor exactly a bird?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What shall I be?\"\n\n\"You will be a Betwixt-and-Between,\" Solomon said, and certainly he was\na wise old fellow, for that is exactly how it turned out.\n\nThe birds on the island never got used to him. His oddities tickled them\nevery day, as if they were quite new, though it was really the birds\nthat were new. They came out of the eggs daily, and laughed at him at\nonce, then off they soon flew to be humans, and other birds came out\nof other eggs, and so it went on forever. The crafty mother-birds, when\nthey tired of sitting on their eggs, used to get the young one to break\ntheir shells a day before the right time by whispering to them that now\nwas their chance to see Peter washing or drinking or eating. Thousands\ngathered round him daily to watch him do these things, just as you watch\nthe peacocks, and they screamed with delight when he lifted the crusts\nthey flung him with his hands instead of in the usual way with the\nmouth. All his food was brought to him from the Gardens at Solomon's\norders by the birds. He would not eat worms or insects (which they\nthought very silly of him), so they brought him bread in their beaks.\nThus, when you cry out, \"Greedy! Greedy!\" to the bird that flies away\nwith the big crust, you know now that you ought not to do this, for he\nis very likely taking it to Peter Pan.\n\nPeter wore no night-gown now. You see, the birds were always begging him\nfor bits of it to line their nests with, and, being very good-natured,\nhe could not refuse, so by Solomon's advice he had hidden what was left\nof it. But, though he was now quite naked, you must not think that he\nwas cold or unhappy. He was usually very happy and gay, and the reason\nwas that Solomon had kept his promise and taught him many of the bird\nways. To be easily pleased, for instance, and always to be really doing\nsomething, and to think that whatever he was doing was a thing of vast\nimportance. Peter became very clever at helping the birds to build their\nnests; soon he could build better than a wood-pigeon, and nearly as well\nas a blackbird, though never did he satisfy the finches, and he made\nnice little water-troughs near the nests and dug up worms for the young\nones with his fingers. He also became very learned in bird-lore, and\nknew an east-wind from a west-wind by its smell, and he could see the\ngrass growing and hear the insects walking about inside the tree-trunks.\nBut the best thing Solomon had done was to teach him to have a glad\nheart. All birds have glad hearts unless you rob their nests, and so as\nthey were the only kind of heart Solomon knew about, it was easy to him\nto teach Peter how to have one.\n\nPeter's heart was so glad that he felt he must sing all day long,\njust as the birds sing for joy, but, being partly human, he needed an\ninstrument, so he made a pipe of reeds, and he used to sit by the shore\nof the island of an evening, practising the sough of the wind and the\nripple of the water, and catching handfuls of the shine of the moon, and\nhe put them all in his pipe and played them so beautifully that even the\nbirds were deceived, and they would say to each other, \"Was that a fish\nleaping in the water or was it Peter playing leaping fish on his pipe?\"\nand sometimes he played the birth of birds, and then the mothers would\nturn round in their nests to see whether they had laid an egg. If you\nare a child of the Gardens you must know the chestnut-tree near the\nbridge, which comes out in flower first of all the chestnuts, but\nperhaps you have not heard why this tree leads the way. It is because\nPeter wearies for summer and plays that it has come, and the chestnut\nbeing so near, hears him and is cheated.\n\nBut as Peter sat by the shore tootling divinely on his pipe he sometimes\nfell into sad thoughts and then the music became sad also, and the\nreason of all this sadness was that he could not reach the Gardens,\nthough he could see them through the arch of the bridge. He knew he\ncould never be a real human again, and scarcely wanted to be one, but\noh, how he longed to play as other children play, and of course there\nis no such lovely place to play in as the Gardens. The birds brought him\nnews of how boys and girls play, and wistful tears started in Peter's\neyes.\n\nPerhaps you wonder why he did not swim across. The reason was that he\ncould not swim. He wanted to know how to swim, but no one on the island\nknew the way except the ducks, and they are so stupid. They were quite\nwilling to teach him, but all they could say about it was, \"You sit down\non the top of the water in this way, and then you kick out like that.\"\nPeter tried it often, but always before he could kick out he sank. What\nhe really needed to know was how you sit on the water without sinking,\nand they said it was quite impossible to explain such an easy thing as\nthat. Occasionally swans touched on the island, and he would give them\nall his day's food and then ask them how they sat on the water, but as\nsoon as he had no more to give them the hateful things hissed at him and\nsailed away.\n\nOnce he really thought he had discovered a way of reaching the Gardens.\nA wonderful white thing, like a runaway newspaper, floated high over\nthe island and then tumbled, rolling over and over after the manner of a\nbird that has broken its wing. Peter was so frightened that he hid, but\nthe birds told him it was only a kite, and what a kite is, and that it\nmust have tugged its string out of a boy's hand, and soared away. After\nthat they laughed at Peter for being so fond of the kite, he loved it\nso much that he even slept with one hand on it, and I think this was\npathetic and pretty, for the reason he loved it was because it had\nbelonged to a real boy.\n\nTo the birds this was a very poor reason, but the older ones felt\ngrateful to him at this time because he had nursed a number of\nfledglings through the German measles, and they offered to show him how\nbirds fly a kite. So six of them took the end of the string in their\nbeaks and flew away with it; and to his amazement it flew after them and\nwent even higher than they.\n\nPeter screamed out, \"Do it again!\" and with great good-nature they did\nit several times, and always instead of thanking them he cried, \"Do it\nagain!\" which shows that even now he had not quite forgotten what it was\nto be a boy.\n\nAt last, with a grand design burning within his brave heart, he begged\nthem to do it once more with him clinging to the tail, and now a hundred\nflew off with the string, and Peter clung to the tail, meaning to drop\noff when he was over the Gardens. But the kite broke to pieces in the\nair, and he would have drowned in the Serpentine had he not caught hold\nof two indignant swans and made them carry him to the island. After this\nthe birds said that they would help him no more in his mad enterprise.\n\nNevertheless, Peter did reach the Gardens at last by the help of\nShelley's boat, as I am now to tell you.\n\n\n\n\nXV. The Thrush's Nest\n\nShelley was a young gentleman and as grown-up as he need ever expect to\nbe. He was a poet; and they are never exactly grown-up. They are people\nwho despise money except what you need for to-day, and he had all that\nand five pounds over. So, when he was walking in the Kensington Gardens,\nhe made a paper boat of his bank-note, and sent it sailing on the\nSerpentine.\n\nIt reached the island at night: and the look-out brought it to Solomon\nCaw, who thought at first that it was the usual thing, a message from a\nlady, saying she would be obliged if he could let her have a good one.\nThey always ask for the best one he has, and if he likes the letter he\nsends one from Class A; but if it ruffles him he sends very funny ones\nindeed. Sometimes he sends none at all, and at another time he sends a\nnestful; it all depends on the mood you catch him in. He likes you to\nleave it all to him, and if you mention particularly that you hope he\nwill see his way to making it a boy this time, he is almost sure to send\nanother girl. And whether you are a lady or only a little boy who wants\na baby-sister, always take pains to write your address clearly. You\ncan't think what a lot of babies Solomon has sent to the wrong house.\n\nShelley's boat, when opened, completely puzzled Solomon, and he took\ncounsel of his assistants, who having walked over it twice, first with\ntheir toes pointed out, and then with their toes pointed in, decided\nthat it came from some greedy person who wanted five. They thought this\nbecause there was a large five printed on it. \"Preposterous!\" cried\nSolomon in a rage, and he presented it to Peter; anything useless which\ndrifted upon the island was usually given to Peter as a play-thing.\n\nBut he did not play with his precious bank-note, for he knew what it\nwas at once, having been very observant during the week when he was an\nordinary boy. With so much money, he reflected, he could surely at last\ncontrive to reach the Gardens, and he considered all the possible ways,\nand decided (wisely, I think) to choose the best way. But, first, he had\nto tell the birds of the value of Shelley's boat; and though they were\ntoo honest to demand it back, he saw that they were galled, and they\ncast such black looks at Solomon, who was rather vain of his cleverness,\nthat he flew away to the end of the island, and sat there very depressed\nwith his head buried in his wings. Now Peter knew that unless Solomon\nwas on your side, you never got anything done for you in the island, so\nhe followed him and tried to hearten him.\n\nNor was this all that Peter did to gain the powerful old fellow's good\nwill. You must know that Solomon had no intention of remaining in office\nall his life. He looked forward to retiring by-and-by, and devoting his\ngreen old age to a life of pleasure on a certain yew-stump in the Figs\nwhich had taken his fancy, and for years he had been quietly filling his\nstocking. It was a stocking belonging to some bathing person which had\nbeen cast upon the island, and at the time I speak of it contained a\nhundred and eighty crumbs, thirty-four nuts, sixteen crusts, a pen-wiper\nand a boot-lace. When his stocking was full, Solomon calculated that he\nwould be able to retire on a competency. Peter now gave him a pound. He\ncut it off his bank-note with a sharp stick.\n\nThis made Solomon his friend for ever, and after the two had consulted\ntogether they called a meeting of the thrushes. You will see presently\nwhy thrushes only were invited.\n\nThe scheme to be put before them was really Peter's, but Solomon did\nmost of the talking, because he soon became irritable if other people\ntalked. He began by saying that he had been much impressed by the\nsuperior ingenuity shown by the thrushes in nest-building, and this\nput them into good-humour at once, as it was meant to do; for all the\nquarrels between birds are about the best way of building nests. Other\nbirds, said Solomon, omitted to line their nests with mud, and as a\nresult they did not hold water. Here he cocked his head as if he had\nused an unanswerable argument; but, unfortunately, a Mrs. Finch had come\nto the meeting uninvited, and she squeaked out, \"We don't build nests to\nhold water, but to hold eggs,\" and then the thrushes stopped cheering,\nand Solomon was so perplexed that he took several sips of water.\n\n\"Consider,\" he said at last, \"how warm the mud makes the nest.\"\n\n\"Consider,\" cried Mrs. Finch, \"that when water gets into the nest it\nremains there and your little ones are drowned.\"\n\nThe thrushes begged Solomon with a look to say something crushing in\nreply to this, but again he was perplexed.\n\n\"Try another drink,\" suggested Mrs. Finch pertly. Kate was her name, and\nall Kates are saucy.\n\nSolomon did try another drink, and it inspired him. \"If,\" said he, \"a\nfinch's nest is placed on the Serpentine it fills and breaks to pieces,\nbut a thrush's nest is still as dry as the cup of a swan's back.\"\n\nHow the thrushes applauded! Now they knew why they lined their nests\nwith mud, and when Mrs. Finch called out, \"We don't place our nests on\nthe Serpentine,\" they did what they should have done at first: chased\nher from the meeting. After this it was most orderly. What they had been\nbrought together to hear, said Solomon, was this: their young friend,\nPeter Pan, as they well knew, wanted very much to be able to cross to\nthe Gardens, and he now proposed, with their help, to build a boat.\n\nAt this the thrushes began to fidget, which made Peter tremble for his\nscheme.\n\nSolomon explained hastily that what he meant was not one of the cumbrous\nboats that humans use; the proposed boat was to be simply a thrush's\nnest large enough to hold Peter.\n\nBut still, to Peter's agony, the thrushes were sulky. \"We are very busy\npeople,\" they grumbled, \"and this would be a big job.\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" said Solomon, \"and, of course, Peter would not allow you\nto work for nothing. You must remember that he is now in comfortable\ncircumstances, and he will pay you such wages as you have never been\npaid before. Peter Pan authorises me to say that you shall all be paid\nsixpence a day.\"\n\nThen all the thrushes hopped for joy, and that very day was begun the\ncelebrated Building of the Boat. All their ordinary business fell into\narrears. It was the time of year when they should have been pairing, but\nnot a thrush's nest was built except this big one, and so Solomon soon\nran short of thrushes with which to supply the demand from the mainland.\nThe stout, rather greedy children, who look so well in perambulators\nbut get puffed easily when they walk, were all young thrushes once, and\nladies often ask specially for them. What do you think Solomon did? He\nsent over to the house-tops for a lot of sparrows and ordered them to\nlay their eggs in old thrushes' nests and sent their young to the ladies\nand swore they were all thrushes! It was known afterward on the island\nas the Sparrows' Year, and so, when you meet, as you doubtless sometimes\ndo, grown-up people who puff and blow as if they thought themselves\nbigger than they are, very likely they belong to that year. You ask\nthem.\n\nPeter was a just master, and paid his workpeople every evening. They\nstood in rows on the branches, waiting politely while he cut the paper\nsixpences out of his bank-note, and presently he called the roll, and\nthen each bird, as the names were mentioned, flew down and got sixpence.\nIt must have been a fine sight.\n\nAnd at last, after months of labor, the boat was finished. Oh, the\ndeportment of Peter as he saw it growing more and more like a great\nthrush's nest! From the very beginning of the building of it he slept by\nits side, and often woke up to say sweet things to it, and after it was\nlined with mud and the mud had dried he always slept in it. He sleeps in\nhis nest still, and has a fascinating way of curling round in it, for it\nis just large enough to hold him comfortably when he curls round like a\nkitten. It is brown inside, of course, but outside it is mostly green,\nbeing woven of grass and twigs, and when these wither or snap the walls\nare thatched afresh. There are also a few feathers here and there, which\ncame off the thrushes while they were building.\n\nThe other birds were extremely jealous and said that the boat would not\nbalance on the water, but it lay most beautifully steady; they said the\nwater would come into it, but no water came into it. Next they said that\nPeter had no oars, and this caused the thrushes to look at each other\nin dismay, but Peter replied that he had no need of oars, for he had a\nsail, and with such a proud, happy face he produced a sail which he had\nfashioned out of his night-gown, and though it was still rather like a\nnight-gown it made a lovely sail. And that night, the moon being full,\nand all the birds asleep, he did enter his coracle (as Master Francis\nPretty would have said) and depart out of the island. And first, he knew\nnot why, he looked upward, with his hands clasped, and from that moment\nhis eyes were pinned to the west.\n\nHe had promised the thrushes to begin by making short voyages, with them\nto his guides, but far away he saw the Kensington Gardens beckoning to\nhim beneath the bridge, and he could not wait. His face was flushed, but\nhe never looked back; there was an exultation in his little breast that\ndrove out fear. Was Peter the least gallant of the English mariners who\nhave sailed westward to meet the Unknown?\n\nAt first, his boat turned round and round, and he was driven back to the\nplace of his starting, whereupon he shortened sail, by removing one of\nthe sleeves, and was forthwith carried backward by a contrary breeze, to\nhis no small peril. He now let go the sail, with the result that he was\ndrifted toward the far shore, where are black shadows he knew not the\ndangers of, but suspected them, and so once more hoisted his night-gown\nand went roomer of the shadows until he caught a favouring wind, which\nbore him westward, but at so great a speed that he was like to be broke\nagainst the bridge. Which, having avoided, he passed under the bridge\nand came, to his great rejoicing, within full sight of the delectable\nGardens. But having tried to cast anchor, which was a stone at the end\nof a piece of the kite-string, he found no bottom, and was fain to hold\noff, seeking for moorage, and, feeling his way, he buffeted against a\nsunken reef that cast him overboard by the greatness of the shock, and\nhe was near to being drowned, but clambered back into the vessel. There\nnow arose a mighty storm, accompanied by roaring of waters, such as he\nhad never heard the like, and he was tossed this way and that, and\nhis hands so numbed with the cold that he could not close them. Having\nescaped the danger of which, he was mercifully carried into a small bay,\nwhere his boat rode at peace.\n\nNevertheless, he was not yet in safety; for, on pretending to disembark,\nhe found a multitude of small people drawn up on the shore to contest\nhis landing, and shouting shrilly to him to be off, for it was long past\nLock-out Time. This, with much brandishing of their holly-leaves, and\nalso a company of them carried an arrow which some boy had left in the\nGardens, and this they were prepared to use as a battering-ram.\n\nThen Peter, who knew them for the fairies, called out that he was not an\nordinary human and had no desire to do them displeasure, but to be their\nfriend; nevertheless, having found a jolly harbour, he was in no temper\nto draw off therefrom, and he warned them if they sought to mischief him\nto stand to their harms.\n\nSo saying, he boldly leapt ashore, and they gathered around him with\nintent to slay him, but there then arose a great cry among the women,\nand it was because they had now observed that his sail was a baby's\nnight-gown. Whereupon, they straightway loved him, and grieved that\ntheir laps were too small, the which I cannot explain, except by saying\nthat such is the way of women. The men-fairies now sheathed their\nweapons on observing the behaviour of their women, on whose intelligence\nthey set great store, and they led him civilly to their queen, who\nconferred upon him the courtesy of the Gardens after Lock-out Time, and\nhenceforth Peter could go whither he chose, and the fairies had orders\nto put him in comfort.\n\nSuch was his first voyage to the Gardens, and you may gather from the\nantiquity of the language that it took place a long time ago. But Peter\nnever grows any older, and if we could be watching for him under the\nbridge to-night (but, of course, we can't), I daresay we should see\nhim hoisting his night-gown and sailing or paddling toward us in the\nThrush's Nest. When he sails, he sits down, but he stands up to paddle.\nI shall tell you presently how he got his paddle.\n\nLong before the time for the opening of the gates comes he steals back\nto the island, for people must not see him (he is not so human as all\nthat), but this gives him hours for play, and he plays exactly as real\nchildren play. At least he thinks so, and it is one of the pathetic\nthings about him that he often plays quite wrongly.\n\nYou see, he had no one to tell him how children really play, for the\nfairies were all more or less in hiding until dusk, and so know nothing,\nand though the birds pretended that they could tell him a great deal,\nwhen the time for telling came, it was wonderful how little they really\nknew. They told him the truth about hide-and-seek, and he often plays\nit by himself, but even the ducks on the Round Pond could not explain to\nhim what it is that makes the pond so fascinating to boys. Every night\nthe ducks have forgotten all the events of the day, except the number of\npieces of cake thrown to them. They are gloomy creatures, and say that\ncake is not what it was in their young days.\n\nSo Peter had to find out many things for himself. He often played ships\nat the Round Pond, but his ship was only a hoop which he had found on\nthe grass. Of course, he had never seen a hoop, and he wondered what\nyou play at with them, and decided that you play at pretending they\nare boats. This hoop always sank at once, but he waded in for it, and\nsometimes he dragged it gleefully round the rim of the pond, and he was\nquite proud to think that he had discovered what boys do with hoops.\n\nAnother time, when he found a child's pail, he thought it was for\nsitting in, and he sat so hard in it that he could scarcely get out of\nit. Also he found a balloon. It was bobbing about on the Hump, quite as\nif it was having a game by itself, and he caught it after an exciting\nchase. But he thought it was a ball, and Jenny Wren had told him that\nboys kick balls, so he kicked it; and after that he could not find it\nanywhere.\n\nPerhaps the most surprising thing he found was a perambulator. It was\nunder a lime-tree, near the entrance to the Fairy Queen's Winter Palace\n(which is within the circle of the seven Spanish chestnuts), and Peter\napproached it warily, for the birds had never mentioned such things to\nhim. Lest it was alive, he addressed it politely, and then, as it gave\nno answer, he went nearer and felt it cautiously. He gave it a little\npush, and it ran from him, which made him think it must be alive after\nall; but, as it had run from him, he was not afraid. So he stretched out\nhis hand to pull it to him, but this time it ran at him, and he was so\nalarmed that he leapt the railing and scudded away to his boat. You must\nnot think, however, that he was a coward, for he came back next night\nwith a crust in one hand and a stick in the other, but the perambulator\nhad gone, and he never saw another one. I have promised to tell you also\nabout his paddle. It was a child's spade which he had found near St.\nGovor's Well, and he thought it was a paddle.\n\nDo you pity Peter Pan for making these mistakes? If so, I think it\nrather silly of you. What I mean is that, of course, one must pity him\nnow and then, but to pity him all the time would be impertinence. He\nthought he had the most splendid time in the Gardens, and to think you\nhave it is almost quite as good as really to have it. He played without\nceasing, while you often waste time by being mad-dog or Mary-Annish. He\ncould be neither of these things, for he had never heard of them, but do\nyou think he is to be pitied for that?\n\nOh, he was merry. He was as much merrier than you, for instance, as you\nare merrier than your father. Sometimes he fell, like a spinning-top,\nfrom sheer merriment. Have you seen a greyhound leaping the fences of\nthe Gardens? That is how Peter leaps them.\n\nAnd think of the music of his pipe. Gentlemen who walk home at night\nwrite to the papers to say they heard a nightingale in the Gardens, but\nit is really Peter's pipe they hear. Of course, he had no mother--at\nleast, what use was she to him? You can be sorry for him for that, but\ndon't be too sorry, for the next thing I mean to tell you is how he\nrevisited her. It was the fairies who gave him the chance.\n\n\n\n\nXVI. Lock-Out Time\n\nIt is frightfully difficult to know much about the fairies, and almost\nthe only thing known for certain is that there are fairies wherever\nthere are children. Long ago children were forbidden the Gardens, and\nat that time there was not a fairy in the place; then the children were\nadmitted, and the fairies came trooping in that very evening. They can't\nresist following the children, but you seldom see them, partly because\nthey live in the daytime behind the railings, where you are not allowed\nto go, and also partly because they are so cunning. They are not a bit\ncunning after Lock-out, but until Lock-out, my word!\n\nWhen you were a bird you knew the fairies pretty well, and you remember\na good deal about them in your babyhood, which it is a great pity you\ncan't write down, for gradually you forget, and I have heard of children\nwho declared that they had never once seen a fairy. Very likely if they\nsaid this in the Kensington Gardens, they were standing looking at a\nfairy all the time. The reason they were cheated was that she pretended\nto be something else. This is one of their best tricks. They usually\npretend to be flowers, because the court sits in the Fairies' Basin,\nand there are so many flowers there, and all along the Baby Walk, that\na flower is the thing least likely to attract attention. They dress\nexactly like flowers, and change with the seasons, putting on white when\nlilies are in and blue for blue-bells, and so on. They like crocus and\nhyacinth time best of all, as they are partial to a bit of colour, but\ntulips (except white ones, which are the fairy-cradles) they consider\ngarish, and they sometimes put off dressing like tulips for days, so\nthat the beginning of the tulip weeks is almost the best time to catch\nthem.\n\nWhen they think you are not looking they skip along pretty lively, but\nif you look and they fear there is no time to hide, they stand quite\nstill, pretending to be flowers. Then, after you have passed without\nknowing that they were fairies, they rush home and tell their mothers\nthey have had such an adventure. The Fairy Basin, you remember, is all\ncovered with ground-ivy (from which they make their castor-oil), with\nflowers growing in it here and there. Most of them really are flowers,\nbut some of them are fairies. You never can be sure of them, but a good\nplan is to walk by looking the other way, and then turn round sharply.\nAnother good plan, which David and I sometimes follow, is to stare them\ndown. After a long time they can't help winking, and then you know for\ncertain that they are fairies.\n\nThere are also numbers of them along the Baby Walk, which is a\nfamous gentle place, as spots frequented by fairies are called. Once\ntwenty-four of them had an extraordinary adventure. They were a girls'\nschool out for a walk with the governess, and all wearing hyacinth\ngowns, when she suddenly put her finger to her mouth, and then they\nall stood still on an empty bed and pretended to be hyacinths.\nUnfortunately, what the governess had heard was two gardeners coming to\nplant new flowers in that very bed. They were wheeling a handcart with\nthe flowers in it, and were quite surprised to find the bed occupied.\n\"Pity to lift them hyacinths,\" said the one man. \"Duke's orders,\"\nreplied the other, and, having emptied the cart, they dug up the\nboarding-school and put the poor, terrified things in it in five rows.\nOf course, neither the governess nor the girls dare let on that they\nwere fairies, so they were carted far away to a potting-shed, out of\nwhich they escaped in the night without their shoes, but there was a\ngreat row about it among the parents, and the school was ruined.\n\nAs for their houses, it is no use looking for them, because they are\nthe exact opposite of our houses. You can see our houses by day but you\ncan't see them by dark. Well, you can see their houses by dark, but you\ncan't see them by day, for they are the colour of night, and I never\nheard of anyone yet who could see night in the daytime. This does not\nmean that they are black, for night has its colours just as day has,\nbut ever so much brighter. Their blues and reds and greens are like ours\nwith a light behind them. The palace is entirely built of many-coloured\nglasses, and is quite the loveliest of all royal residences, but the\nqueen sometimes complains because the common people will peep in to see\nwhat she is doing. They are very inquisitive folk, and press quite hard\nagainst the glass, and that is why their noses are mostly snubby. The\nstreets are miles long and very twisty, and have paths on each side made\nof bright worsted. The birds used to steal the worsted for their nests,\nbut a policeman has been appointed to hold on at the other end.\n\nOne of the great differences between the fairies and us is that they\nnever do anything useful. When the first baby laughed for the first\ntime, his laugh broke into a million pieces, and they all went skipping\nabout. That was the beginning of fairies. They look tremendously busy,\nyou know, as if they had not a moment to spare, but if you were to ask\nthem what they are doing, they could not tell you in the least. They are\nfrightfully ignorant, and everything they do is make-believe. They have\na postman, but he never calls except at Christmas with his little box,\nand though they have beautiful schools, nothing is taught in them; the\nyoungest child being chief person is always elected mistress, and when\nshe has called the roll, they all go out for a walk and never come back.\nIt is a very noticeable thing that, in fairy families, the youngest\nis always chief person, and usually becomes a prince or princess; and\nchildren remember this, and think it must be so among humans also, and\nthat is why they are often made uneasy when they come upon their mother\nfurtively putting new frills on the basinette.\n\nYou have probably observed that your baby-sister wants to do all sorts\nof things that your mother and her nurse want her not to do: to stand up\nat sitting-down time, and to sit down at standing-up time, for instance,\nor to wake up when she should fall asleep, or to crawl on the floor when\nshe is wearing her best frock, and so on, and perhaps you put this down\nto naughtiness. But it is not; it simply means that she is doing as\nshe has seen the fairies do; she begins by following their ways, and\nit takes about two years to get her into the human ways. Her fits of\npassion, which are awful to behold, and are usually called teething,\nare no such thing; they are her natural exasperation, because we don't\nunderstand her, though she is talking an intelligible language. She is\ntalking fairy. The reason mothers and nurses know what her remarks mean,\nbefore other people know, as that \"Guch\" means \"Give it to me at once,\"\nwhile \"Wa\" is \"Why do you wear such a funny hat?\" is because, mixing so\nmuch with babies, they have picked up a little of the fairy language.\n\nOf late David has been thinking back hard about the fairy tongue, with\nhis hands clutching his temples, and he has remembered a number of their\nphrases which I shall tell you some day if I don't forget. He had heard\nthem in the days when he was a thrush, and though I suggested to him\nthat perhaps it is really bird language he is remembering, he says not,\nfor these phrases are about fun and adventures, and the birds talked of\nnothing but nest-building. He distinctly remembers that the birds used\nto go from spot to spot like ladies at shop-windows, looking at the\ndifferent nests and saying, \"Not my colour, my dear,\" and \"How would\nthat do with a soft lining?\" and \"But will it wear?\" and \"What hideous\ntrimming!\" and so on.\n\nThe fairies are exquisite dancers, and that is why one of the first\nthings the baby does is to sign to you to dance to him and then to cry\nwhen you do it. They hold their great balls in the open air, in what\nis called a fairy-ring. For weeks afterward you can see the ring on the\ngrass. It is not there when they begin, but they make it by waltzing\nround and round. Sometimes you will find mushrooms inside the ring, and\nthese are fairy chairs that the servants have forgotten to clear away.\nThe chairs and the rings are the only tell-tale marks these little\npeople leave behind them, and they would remove even these were they not\nso fond of dancing that they toe it till the very moment of the opening\nof the gates. David and I once found a fairy-ring quite warm.\n\nBut there is also a way of finding out about the ball before it takes\nplace. You know the boards which tell at what time the Gardens are to\nclose to-day. Well, these tricky fairies sometimes slyly change the\nboard on a ball night, so that it says the Gardens are to close at\nsix-thirty for instance, instead of at seven. This enables them to get\nbegun half an hour earlier.\n\nIf on such a night we could remain behind in the Gardens, as the famous\nMaimie Mannering did, we might see delicious sights, hundreds of\nlovely fairies hastening to the ball, the married ones wearing their\nwedding-rings round their waists, the gentlemen, all in uniform, holding\nup the ladies' trains, and linkmen running in front carrying winter\ncherries, which are the fairy-lanterns, the cloakroom where they put\non their silver slippers and get a ticket for their wraps, the flowers\nstreaming up from the Baby Walk to look on, and always welcome because\nthey can lend a pin, the supper-table, with Queen Mab at the head of it,\nand behind her chair the Lord Chamberlain, who carries a dandelion on\nwhich he blows when Her Majesty wants to know the time.\n\nThe table-cloth varies according to the seasons, and in May it is made\nof chestnut-blossom. The ways the fairy-servants do is this: The men,\nscores of them, climb up the trees and shake the branches, and the\nblossom falls like snow. Then the lady servants sweep it together by\nwhisking their skirts until it is exactly like a table-cloth, and that\nis how they get their table-cloth.\n\nThey have real glasses and real wine of three kinds, namely, blackthorn\nwine, berberris wine, and cowslip wine, and the Queen pours out, but the\nbottles are so heavy that she just pretends to pour out. There is bread\nand butter to begin with, of the size of a threepenny bit; and cakes to\nend with, and they are so small that they have no crumbs. The fairies\nsit round on mushrooms, and at first they are very well-behaved and\nalways cough off the table, and so on, but after a bit they are not so\nwell-behaved and stick their fingers into the butter, which is got\nfrom the roots of old trees, and the really horrid ones crawl over the\ntable-cloth chasing sugar or other delicacies with their tongues. When\nthe Queen sees them doing this she signs to the servants to wash up and\nput away, and then everybody adjourns to the dance, the Queen walking in\nfront while the Lord Chamberlain walks behind her, carrying two little\npots, one of which contains the juice of wall-flower and the other the\njuice of Solomon's Seals. Wall-flower juice is good for reviving dancers\nwho fall to the ground in a fit, and Solomon's Seals juice is for\nbruises. They bruise very easily and when Peter plays faster and faster\nthey foot it till they fall down in fits. For, as you know without my\ntelling you, Peter Pan is the fairies' orchestra. He sits in the middle\nof the ring, and they would never dream of having a smart dance nowadays\nwithout him. \"P. P.\" is written on the corner of the invitation-cards\nsent out by all really good families. They are grateful little people,\ntoo, and at the princess's coming-of-age ball (they come of age on their\nsecond birthday and have a birthday every month) they gave him the wish\nof his heart.\n\nThe way it was done was this. The Queen ordered him to kneel, and then\nsaid that for playing so beautifully she would give him the wish of his\nheart. Then they all gathered round Peter to hear what was the wish of\nhis heart, but for a long time he hesitated, not being certain what it\nwas himself.\n\n\"If I chose to go back to mother,\" he asked at last, \"could you give me\nthat wish?\"\n\nNow this question vexed them, for were he to return to his mother they\nshould lose his music, so the Queen tilted her nose contemptuously and\nsaid, \"Pooh, ask for a much bigger wish than that.\"\n\n\"Is that quite a little wish?\" he inquired.\n\n\"As little as this,\" the Queen answered, putting her hands near each\nother.\n\n\"What size is a big wish?\" he asked.\n\nShe measured it off on her skirt and it was a very handsome length.\n\nThen Peter reflected and said, \"Well, then, I think I shall have two\nlittle wishes instead of one big one.\"\n\nOf course, the fairies had to agree, though his cleverness rather\nshocked them, and he said that his first wish was to go to his\nmother, but with the right to return to the Gardens if he found her\ndisappointing. His second wish he would hold in reserve.\n\nThey tried to dissuade him, and even put obstacles in the way.\n\n\"I can give you the power to fly to her house,\" the Queen said, \"but I\ncan't open the door for you.\n\n\"The window I flew out at will be open,\" Peter said confidently. \"Mother\nalways keeps it open in the hope that I may fly back.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\" they asked, quite surprised, and, really, Peter could\nnot explain how he knew.\n\n\"I just do know,\" he said.\n\nSo as he persisted in his wish, they had to grant it. The way they gave\nhim power to fly was this: They all tickled him on the shoulder, and\nsoon he felt a funny itching in that part and then up he rose higher and\nhigher and flew away out of the Gardens and over the house-tops.\n\nIt was so delicious that instead of flying straight to his old home he\nskimmed away over St. Paul's to the Crystal Palace and back by the river\nand Regent's Park, and by the time he reached his mother's window he had\nquite made up his mind that his second wish should be to become a bird.\n\nThe window was wide open, just as he knew it would be, and in he\nfluttered, and there was his mother lying asleep. Peter alighted softly\non the wooden rail at the foot of the bed and had a good look at her.\nShe lay with her head on her hand, and the hollow in the pillow was like\na nest lined with her brown wavy hair. He remembered, though he had\nlong forgotten it, that she always gave her hair a holiday at night. How\nsweet the frills of her night-gown were. He was very glad she was such a\npretty mother.\n\nBut she looked sad, and he knew why she looked sad. One of her arms\nmoved as if it wanted to go round something, and he knew what it wanted\nto go round.\n\n\"Oh, mother,\" said Peter to himself, \"if you just knew who is sitting on\nthe rail at the foot of the bed.\"\n\nVery gently he patted the little mound that her feet made, and he could\nsee by her face that she liked it. He knew he had but to say \"Mother\"\never so softly, and she would wake up. They always wake up at once if it\nis you that says their name. Then she would give such a joyous cry\nand squeeze him tight. How nice that would be to him, but oh, how\nexquisitely delicious it would be to her. That I am afraid is how Peter\nregarded it. In returning to his mother he never doubted that he was\ngiving her the greatest treat a woman can have. Nothing can be more\nsplendid, he thought, than to have a little boy of your own. How proud\nof him they are; and very right and proper, too.\n\nBut why does Peter sit so long on the rail, why does he not tell his\nmother that he has come back?\n\nI quite shrink from the truth, which is that he sat there in two minds.\nSometimes he looked longingly at his mother, and sometimes he looked\nlongingly at the window. Certainly it would be pleasant to be her boy\nagain, but, on the other hand, what times those had been in the Gardens!\nWas he so sure that he would enjoy wearing clothes again? He popped off\nthe bed and opened some drawers to have a look at his old garments. They\nwere still there, but he could not remember how you put them on. The\nsocks, for instance, were they worn on the hands or on the feet? He was\nabout to try one of them on his hand, when he had a great adventure.\nPerhaps the drawer had creaked; at any rate, his mother woke up, for\nhe heard her say \"Peter,\" as if it was the most lovely word in the\nlanguage. He remained sitting on the floor and held his breath,\nwondering how she knew that he had come back. If she said \"Peter\" again,\nhe meant to cry \"Mother\" and run to her. But she spoke no more, she\nmade little moans only, and when next he peeped at her she was once more\nasleep, with tears on her face.\n\nIt made Peter very miserable, and what do you think was the first\nthing he did? Sitting on the rail at the foot of the bed, he played a\nbeautiful lullaby to his mother on his pipe. He had made it up himself\nout of the way she said \"Peter,\" and he never stopped playing until she\nlooked happy.\n\nHe thought this so clever of him that he could scarcely resist wakening\nher to hear her say, \"Oh, Peter, how exquisitely you play.\" However, as\nshe now seemed comfortable, he again cast looks at the window. You must\nnot think that he meditated flying away and never coming back. He had\nquite decided to be his mother's boy, but hesitated about beginning\nto-night. It was the second wish which troubled him. He no longer meant\nto make it a wish to be a bird, but not to ask for a second wish seemed\nwasteful, and, of course, he could not ask for it without returning to\nthe fairies. Also, if he put off asking for his wish too long it might\ngo bad. He asked himself if he had not been hardhearted to fly away\nwithout saying good-bye to Solomon. \"I should like awfully to sail in my\nboat just once more,\" he said wistfully to his sleeping mother. He quite\nargued with her as if she could hear him. \"It would be so splendid to\ntell the birds of this adventure,\" he said coaxingly. \"I promise to come\nback,\" he said solemnly and meant it, too.\n\nAnd in the end, you know, he flew away. Twice he came back from the\nwindow, wanting to kiss his mother, but he feared the delight of it\nmight waken her, so at last he played her a lovely kiss on his pipe, and\nthen he flew back to the Gardens.\n\nMany nights and even months passed before he asked the fairies for his\nsecond wish; and I am not sure that I quite know why he delayed so long.\nOne reason was that he had so many good-byes to say, not only to his\nparticular friends, but to a hundred favourite spots. Then he had his\nlast sail, and his very last sail, and his last sail of all, and so on.\nAgain, a number of farewell feasts were given in his honour; and another\ncomfortable reason was that, after all, there was no hurry, for his\nmother would never weary of waiting for him. This last reason displeased\nold Solomon, for it was an encouragement to the birds to procrastinate.\nSolomon had several excellent mottoes for keeping them at their work,\nsuch as \"Never put off laying to-day, because you can lay to-morrow,\"\nand \"In this world there are no second chances,\" and yet here was Peter\ngaily putting off and none the worse for it. The birds pointed this out\nto each other, and fell into lazy habits.\n\nBut, mind you, though Peter was so slow in going back to his mother,\nhe was quite decided to go back. The best proof of this was his caution\nwith the fairies. They were most anxious that he should remain in the\nGardens to play to them, and to bring this to pass they tried to trick\nhim into making such a remark as \"I wish the grass was not so wet,\" and\nsome of them danced out of time in the hope that he might cry, \"I do\nwish you would keep time!\" Then they would have said that this was his\nsecond wish. But he smoked their design, and though on occasions he\nbegan, \"I wish--\" he always stopped in time. So when at last he said\nto them bravely, \"I wish now to go back to mother for ever and always,\"\nthey had to tickle his shoulders and let him go.\n\nHe went in a hurry in the end because he had dreamt that his mother was\ncrying, and he knew what was the great thing she cried for, and that a\nhug from her splendid Peter would quickly make her to smile. Oh, he felt\nsure of it, and so eager was he to be nestling in her arms that this\ntime he flew straight to the window, which was always to be open for\nhim.\n\nBut the window was closed, and there were iron bars on it, and peering\ninside he saw his mother sleeping peacefully with her arm round another\nlittle boy.\n\nPeter called, \"Mother! mother!\" but she heard him not; in vain he beat\nhis little limbs against the iron bars. He had to fly back, sobbing, to\nthe Gardens, and he never saw his dear again. What a glorious boy he had\nmeant to be to her. Ah, Peter, we who have made the great mistake, how\ndifferently we should all act at the second chance. But Solomon was\nright; there is no second chance, not for most of us. When we reach the\nwindow it is Lock-out Time. The iron bars are up for life.\n\n\n\n\nXVII. The Little House\n\nEverybody has heard of the Little House in the Kensington Gardens, which\nis the only house in the whole world that the fairies have built for\nhumans. But no one has really seen it, except just three or four, and\nthey have not only seen it but slept in it, and unless you sleep in it\nyou never see it. This is because it is not there when you lie down, but\nit is there when you wake up and step outside.\n\nIn a kind of way everyone may see it, but what you see is not really\nit, but only the light in the windows. You see the light after Lock-out\nTime. David, for instance, saw it quite distinctly far away among the\ntrees as we were going home from the pantomime, and Oliver Bailey saw\nit the night he stayed so late at the Temple, which is the name of\nhis father's office. Angela Clare, who loves to have a tooth extracted\nbecause then she is treated to tea in a shop, saw more than one light,\nshe saw hundreds of them all together, and this must have been the\nfairies building the house, for they build it every night and always\nin a different part of the Gardens. She thought one of the lights was\nbigger than the others, though she was not quite sure, for they jumped\nabout so, and it might have been another one that was bigger. But if it\nwas the same one, it was Peter Pan's light. Heaps of children have seen\nthe light, so that is nothing. But Maimie Mannering was the famous one\nfor whom the house was first built.\n\nMaimie was always rather a strange girl, and it was at night that she\nwas strange. She was four years of age, and in the daytime she was\nthe ordinary kind. She was pleased when her brother Tony, who was a\nmagnificent fellow of six, took notice of her, and she looked up to him\nin the right way, and tried in vain to imitate him and was flattered\nrather than annoyed when he shoved her about. Also, when she was batting\nshe would pause though the ball was in the air to point out to you\nthat she was wearing new shoes. She was quite the ordinary kind in the\ndaytime.\n\nBut as the shades of night fell, Tony, the swaggerer, lost his contempt\nfor Maimie and eyed her fearfully, and no wonder, for with dark there\ncame into her face a look that I can describe only as a leary look.\nIt was also a serene look that contrasted grandly with Tony's uneasy\nglances. Then he would make her presents of his favourite toys (which\nhe always took away from her next morning) and she accepted them with a\ndisturbing smile. The reason he was now become so wheedling and she so\nmysterious was (in brief) that they knew they were about to be sent to\nbed. It was then that Maimie was terrible. Tony entreated her not to do\nit to-night, and the mother and their coloured nurse threatened her, but\nMaimie merely smiled her agitating smile. And by-and-by when they were\nalone with their night-light she would start up in bed crying \"Hsh! what\nwas that?\" Tony beseeches her! \"It was nothing--don't, Maimie, don't!\"\nand pulls the sheet over his head. \"It is coming nearer!\" she cries;\n\"Oh, look at it, Tony! It is feeling your bed with its horns--it is\nboring for you, oh, Tony, oh!\" and she desists not until he rushes\ndownstairs in his combinations, screeching. When they came up to whip\nMaimie they usually found her sleeping tranquilly, not shamming, you\nknow, but really sleeping, and looking like the sweetest little angel,\nwhich seems to me to make it almost worse.\n\nBut of course it was daytime when they were in the Gardens, and then\nTony did most of the talking. You could gather from his talk that he\nwas a very brave boy, and no one was so proud of it as Maimie. She would\nhave loved to have a ticket on her saying that she was his sister. And\nat no time did she admire him more than when he told her, as he often\ndid with splendid firmness, that one day he meant to remain behind in\nthe Gardens after the gates were closed.\n\n\"Oh, Tony,\" she would say, with awful respect, \"but the fairies will be\nso angry!\"\n\n\"I daresay,\" replied Tony, carelessly.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" she said, thrilling, \"Peter Pan will give you a sail in his\nboat!\"\n\n\"I shall make him,\" replied Tony; no wonder she was proud of him.\n\nBut they should not have talked so loudly, for one day they were\noverheard by a fairy who had been gathering skeleton leaves, from which\nthe little people weave their summer curtains, and after that Tony was a\nmarked boy. They loosened the rails before he sat on them, so that down\nhe came on the back of his head; they tripped him up by catching his\nboot-lace and bribed the ducks to sink his boat. Nearly all the nasty\naccidents you meet with in the Gardens occur because the fairies have\ntaken an ill-will to you, and so it behoves you to be careful what you\nsay about them.\n\nMaimie was one of the kind who like to fix a day for doing things,\nbut Tony was not that kind, and when she asked him which day he was to\nremain behind in the Gardens after Lock-out he merely replied, \"Just\nsome day;\" he was quite vague about which day except when she asked\n\"Will it be to-day?\" and then he could always say for certain that it\nwould not be to-day. So she saw that he was waiting for a real good\nchance.\n\nThis brings us to an afternoon when the Gardens were white with snow,\nand there was ice on the Round Pond, not thick enough to skate on but\nat least you could spoil it for to-morrow by flinging stones, and many\nbright little boys and girls were doing that.\n\nWhen Tony and his sister arrived they wanted to go straight to the pond,\nbut their ayah said they must take a sharp walk first, and as she said\nthis she glanced at the time-board to see when the Gardens closed that\nnight. It read half-past five. Poor ayah! she is the one who laughs\ncontinuously because there are so many white children in the world, but\nshe was not to laugh much more that day.\n\nWell, they went up the Baby Walk and back, and when they returned to the\ntime-board she was surprised to see that it now read five o'clock for\nclosing time. But she was unacquainted with the tricky ways of the\nfairies, and so did not see (as Maimie and Tony saw at once) that they\nhad changed the hour because there was to be a ball to-night. She said\nthere was only time now to walk to the top of the Hump and back, and as\nthey trotted along with her she little guessed what was thrilling their\nlittle breasts. You see the chance had come of seeing a fairy ball.\nNever, Tony felt, could he hope for a better chance.\n\nHe had to feel this, for Maimie so plainly felt it for him. Her eager\neyes asked the question, \"Is it to-day?\" and he gasped and then nodded.\nMaimie slipped her hand into Tony's, and hers was hot, but his was cold.\nShe did a very kind thing; she took off her scarf and gave it to him!\n\"In case you should feel cold,\" she whispered. Her face was aglow, but\nTony's was very gloomy.\n\nAs they turned on the top of the Hump he whispered to her, \"I'm afraid\nNurse would see me, so I sha'n't be able to do it.\"\n\nMaimie admired him more than ever for being afraid of nothing but their\nayah, when there were so many unknown terrors to fear, and she said\naloud, \"Tony, I shall race you to the gate,\" and in a whisper, \"Then you\ncan hide,\" and off they ran.\n\nTony could always outdistance her easily, but never had she known him\nspeed away so quickly as now, and she was sure he hurried that he might\nhave more time to hide. \"Brave, brave!\" her doting eyes were crying when\nshe got a dreadful shock; instead of hiding, her hero had run out at the\ngate! At this bitter sight Maimie stopped blankly, as if all her lapful\nof darling treasures were suddenly spilled, and then for very disdain\nshe could not sob; in a swell of protest against all puling cowards she\nran to St. Govor's Well and hid in Tony's stead.\n\nWhen the ayah reached the gate and saw Tony far in front she thought her\nother charge was with him and passed out. Twilight came on, and scores\nand hundreds of people passed out, including the last one, who always\nhas to run for it, but Maimie saw them not. She had shut her eyes tight\nand glued them with passionate tears. When she opened them something\nvery cold ran up her legs and up her arms and dropped into her heart.\nIt was the stillness of the Gardens. Then she heard clang, then from\nanother part clang, then clang, clang far away. It was the Closing of\nthe Gates.\n\nImmediately the last clang had died away Maimie distinctly heard a voice\nsay, \"So that's all right.\" It had a wooden sound and seemed to come\nfrom above, and she looked up in time to see an elm tree stretching out\nits arms and yawning.\n\nShe was about to say, \"I never knew you could speak!\" when a metallic\nvoice that seemed to come from the ladle at the well remarked to the\nelm, \"I suppose it is a bit coldish up there?\" and the elm replied, \"Not\nparticularly, but you do get numb standing so long on one leg,\" and he\nflapped his arms vigorously just as the cabmen do before they drive off.\nMaimie was quite surprised to see that a number of other tall trees were\ndoing the same sort of thing, and she stole away to the Baby Walk and\ncrouched observantly under a Minorca Holly which shrugged its shoulders\nbut did not seem to mind her.\n\nShe was not in the least cold. She was wearing a russet-coloured pelisse\nand had the hood over her head, so that nothing of her showed except her\ndear little face and her curls. The rest of her real self was hidden far\naway inside so many warm garments that in shape she seemed rather like a\nball. She was about forty round the waist.\n\nThere was a good deal going on in the Baby Walk, when Maimie arrived in\ntime to see a magnolia and a Persian lilac step over the railing and set\noff for a smart walk. They moved in a jerky sort of way certainly, but\nthat was because they used crutches. An elderberry hobbled across the\nwalk, and stood chatting with some young quinces, and they all had\ncrutches. The crutches were the sticks that are tied to young trees and\nshrubs. They were quite familiar objects to Maimie, but she had never\nknown what they were for until to-night.\n\nShe peeped up the walk and saw her first fairy. He was a street boy\nfairy who was running up the walk closing the weeping trees. The way\nhe did it was this, he pressed a spring in the trunk and they shut\nlike umbrellas, deluging the little plants beneath with snow. \"Oh, you\nnaughty, naughty child!\" Maimie cried indignantly, for she knew what it\nwas to have a dripping umbrella about your ears.\n\nFortunately the mischievous fellow was out of earshot, but the\nchrysanthemums heard her, and they all said so pointedly \"Hoity-toity,\nwhat is this?\" that she had to come out and show herself. Then the whole\nvegetable kingdom was rather puzzled what to do.\n\n\"Of course it is no affair of ours,\" a spindle tree said after they had\nwhispered together, \"but you know quite well you ought not to be here,\nand perhaps our duty is to report you to the fairies; what do you think\nyourself?\"\n\n\"I think you should not,\" Maimie replied, which so perplexed them that\nthey said petulantly there was no arguing with her. \"I wouldn't ask it\nof you,\" she assured them, \"if I thought it was wrong,\" and of\ncourse after this they could not well carry tales. They then said,\n\"Well-a-day,\" and \"Such is life!\" for they can be frightfully sarcastic,\nbut she felt sorry for those of them who had no crutches, and she said\ngood-naturedly, \"Before I go to the fairies' ball, I should like to take\nyou for a walk one at a time; you can lean on me, you know.\"\n\nAt this they clapped their hands, and she escorted them up to the Baby\nWalk and back again, one at a time, putting an arm or a finger round\nthe very frail, setting their leg right when it got too ridiculous, and\ntreating the foreign ones quite as courteously as the English, though\nshe could not understand a word they said.\n\nThey behaved well on the whole, though some whimpered that she had not\ntaken them as far as she took Nancy or Grace or Dorothy, and others\njagged her, but it was quite unintentional, and she was too much of a\nlady to cry out. So much walking tired her and she was anxious to be off\nto the ball, but she no longer felt afraid. The reason she felt no more\nfear was that it was now night-time, and in the dark, you remember,\nMaimie was always rather strange.\n\nThey were now loath to let her go, for, \"If the fairies see you,\" they\nwarned her, \"they will mischief you, stab you to death or compel you\nto nurse their children or turn you into something tedious, like an\nevergreen oak.\" As they said this they looked with affected pity at an\nevergreen oak, for in winter they are very envious of the evergreens.\n\n\"Oh, la!\" replied the oak bitingly, \"how deliciously cosy it is to stand\nhere buttoned to the neck and watch you poor naked creatures shivering!\"\n\nThis made them sulky though they had really brought it on themselves,\nand they drew for Maimie a very gloomy picture of the perils that faced\nher if she insisted on going to the ball.\n\nShe learned from a purple filbert that the court was not in its usual\ngood temper at present, the cause being the tantalising heart of the\nDuke of Christmas Daisies. He was an Oriental fairy, very poorly of a\ndreadful complaint, namely, inability to love, and though he had tried\nmany ladies in many lands he could not fall in love with one of them.\nQueen Mab, who rules in the Gardens, had been confident that her girls\nwould bewitch him, but alas, his heart, the doctor said, remained cold.\nThis rather irritating doctor, who was his private physician, felt the\nDuke's heart immediately after any lady was presented, and then always\nshook his bald head and murmured, \"Cold, quite cold!\" Naturally Queen\nMab felt disgraced, and first she tried the effect of ordering the court\ninto tears for nine minutes, and then she blamed the Cupids and decreed\nthat they should wear fools' caps until they thawed the Duke's frozen\nheart.\n\n\"How I should love to see the Cupids in their dear little fools' caps!\"\nMaimie cried, and away she ran to look for them very recklessly, for the\nCupids hate to be laughed at.\n\nIt is always easy to discover where a fairies' ball is being held,\nas ribbons are stretched between it and all the populous parts of the\nGardens, on which those invited may walk to the dance without wetting\ntheir pumps. This night the ribbons were red and looked very pretty on\nthe snow.\n\nMaimie walked alongside one of them for some distance without meeting\nanybody, but at last she saw a fairy cavalcade approaching. To her\nsurprise they seemed to be returning from the ball, and she had just\ntime to hide from them by bending her knees and holding out her arms and\npretending to be a garden chair. There were six horsemen in front and\nsix behind, in the middle walked a prim lady wearing a long train held\nup by two pages, and on the train, as if it were a couch, reclined a\nlovely girl, for in this way do aristocratic fairies travel about. She\nwas dressed in golden rain, but the most enviable part of her was her\nneck, which was blue in colour and of a velvet texture, and of course\nshowed off her diamond necklace as no white throat could have glorified\nit. The high-born fairies obtain this admired effect by pricking their\nskin, which lets the blue blood come through and dye them, and you\ncannot imagine anything so dazzling unless you have seen the ladies'\nbusts in the jewellers' windows.\n\nMaimie also noticed that the whole cavalcade seemed to be in a passion,\ntilting their noses higher than it can be safe for even fairies to tilt\nthem, and she concluded that this must be another case in which the\ndoctor had said \"Cold, quite cold!\"\n\nWell, she followed the ribbon to a place where it became a bridge over a\ndry puddle into which another fairy had fallen and been unable to climb\nout. At first this little damsel was afraid of Maimie, who most kindly\nwent to her aid, but soon she sat in her hand chatting gaily and\nexplaining that her name was Brownie, and that though only a poor street\nsinger she was on her way to the ball to see if the Duke would have her.\n\n\"Of course,\" she said, \"I am rather plain,\" and this made Maimie\nuncomfortable, for indeed the simple little creature was almost quite\nplain for a fairy.\n\nIt was difficult to know what to reply.\n\n\"I see you think I have no chance,\" Brownie said falteringly.\n\n\"I don't say that,\" Maimie answered politely, \"of course your face is\njust a tiny bit homely, but--\" Really it was quite awkward for her.\n\nFortunately she remembered about her father and the bazaar. He had gone\nto a fashionable bazaar where all the most beautiful ladies in London\nwere on view for half-a-crown the second day, but on his return home\ninstead of being dissatisfied with Maimie's mother he had said, \"You\ncan't think, my dear, what a relief it is to see a homely face again.\"\n\nMaimie repeated this story, and it fortified Brownie tremendously,\nindeed she had no longer the slightest doubt that the Duke would choose\nher. So she scudded away up the ribbon, calling out to Maimie not to\nfollow lest the Queen should mischief her.\n\nBut Maimie's curiosity tugged her forward, and presently at the seven\nSpanish chestnuts, she saw a wonderful light. She crept forward until\nshe was quite near it, and then she peeped from behind a tree.\n\nThe light, which was as high as your head above the ground, was composed\nof myriads of glow-worms all holding on to each other, and so forming\na dazzling canopy over the fairy ring. There were thousands of little\npeople looking on, but they were in shadow and drab in colour compared\nto the glorious creatures within that luminous circle who were so\nbewilderingly bright that Maimie had to wink hard all the time she\nlooked at them.\n\nIt was amazing and even irritating to her that the Duke of Christmas\nDaisies should be able to keep out of love for a moment: yet out of love\nhis dusky grace still was: you could see it by the shamed looks of the\nQueen and court (though they pretended not to care), by the way darling\nladies brought forward for his approval burst into tears as they were\ntold to pass on, and by his own most dreary face.\n\nMaimie could also see the pompous doctor feeling the Duke's heart and\nhear him give utterance to his parrot cry, and she was particularly\nsorry for the Cupids, who stood in their fools' caps in obscure\nplaces and, every time they heard that \"Cold, quite cold,\" bowed their\ndisgraced little heads.\n\nShe was disappointed not to see Peter Pan, and I may as well tell you\nnow why he was so late that night. It was because his boat had got\nwedged on the Serpentine between fields of floating ice, through which\nhe had to break a perilous passage with his trusty paddle.\n\nThe fairies had as yet scarcely missed him, for they could not dance, so\nheavy were their hearts. They forget all the steps when they are sad\nand remember them again when they are merry. David tells me that fairies\nnever say \"We feel happy\": what they say is, \"We feel dancey.\"\n\nWell, they were looking very undancey indeed, when sudden laughter broke\nout among the onlookers, caused by Brownie, who had just arrived and was\ninsisting on her right to be presented to the Duke.\n\nMaimie craned forward eagerly to see how her friend fared, though she\nhad really no hope; no one seemed to have the least hope except Brownie\nherself, who, however, was absolutely confident. She was led before his\ngrace, and the doctor putting a finger carelessly on the ducal heart,\nwhich for convenience sake was reached by a little trapdoor in his\ndiamond shirt, had begun to say mechanically, \"Cold, qui--,\" when he\nstopped abruptly.\n\n\"What's this?\" he cried, and first he shook the heart like a watch, and\nthen put his ear to it.\n\n\"Bless my soul!\" cried the doctor, and by this time of course the\nexcitement among the spectators was tremendous, fairies fainting right\nand left.\n\nEverybody stared breathlessly at the Duke, who was very much startled\nand looked as if he would like to run away. \"Good gracious me!\" the\ndoctor was heard muttering, and now the heart was evidently on fire, for\nhe had to jerk his fingers away from it and put them in his mouth.\n\nThe suspense was awful!\n\nThen in a loud voice, and bowing low, \"My Lord Duke,\" said the physician\nelatedly, \"I have the honour to inform your excellency that your grace\nis in love.\"\n\nYou can't conceive the effect of it. Brownie held out her arms to the\nDuke and he flung himself into them, the Queen leapt into the arms of\nthe Lord Chamberlain, and the ladies of the court leapt into the arms of\nher gentlemen, for it is etiquette to follow her example in everything.\nThus in a single moment about fifty marriages took place, for if you\nleap into each other's arms it is a fairy wedding. Of course a clergyman\nhas to be present.\n\nHow the crowd cheered and leapt! Trumpets brayed, the moon came out, and\nimmediately a thousand couples seized hold of its rays as if they were\nribbons in a May dance and waltzed in wild abandon round the fairy ring.\nMost gladsome sight of all, the Cupids plucked the hated fools' caps\nfrom their heads and cast them high in the air. And then Maimie went\nand spoiled everything. She couldn't help it. She was crazy with delight\nover her little friend's good fortune, so she took several steps forward\nand cried in an ecstasy, \"Oh, Brownie, how splendid!\"\n\nEverybody stood still, the music ceased, the lights went out, and all in\nthe time you may take to say \"Oh dear!\" An awful sense of her peril\ncame upon Maimie, too late she remembered that she was a lost child in a\nplace where no human must be between the locking and the opening of the\ngates, she heard the murmur of an angry multitude, she saw a thousand\nswords flashing for her blood, and she uttered a cry of terror and fled.\n\nHow she ran! and all the time her eyes were starting out of her head.\nMany times she lay down, and then quickly jumped up and ran on again.\nHer little mind was so entangled in terrors that she no longer knew\nshe was in the Gardens. The one thing she was sure of was that she must\nnever cease to run, and she thought she was still running long after she\nhad dropped in the Figs and gone to sleep. She thought the snowflakes\nfalling on her face were her mother kissing her good-night. She thought\nher coverlet of snow was a warm blanket, and tried to pull it over her\nhead. And when she heard talking through her dreams she thought it was\nmother bringing father to the nursery door to look at her as she slept.\nBut it was the fairies.\n\nI am very glad to be able to say that they no longer desired to mischief\nher. When she rushed away they had rent the air with such cries as \"Slay\nher!\" \"Turn her into something extremely unpleasant!\" and so on, but the\npursuit was delayed while they discussed who should march in front,\nand this gave Duchess Brownie time to cast herself before the Queen and\ndemand a boon.\n\nEvery bride has a right to a boon, and what she asked for was Maimie's\nlife. \"Anything except that,\" replied Queen Mab sternly, and all the\nfairies chanted \"Anything except that.\" But when they learned how Maimie\nhad befriended Brownie and so enabled her to attend the ball to their\ngreat glory and renown, they gave three huzzas for the little human, and\nset off, like an army, to thank her, the court advancing in front\nand the canopy keeping step with it. They traced Maimie easily by her\nfootprints in the snow.\n\nBut though they found her deep in snow in the Figs, it seemed impossible\nto thank Maimie, for they could not waken her. They went through the\nform of thanking her, that is to say, the new King stood on her body and\nread her a long address of welcome, but she heard not a word of it. They\nalso cleared the snow off her, but soon she was covered again, and they\nsaw she was in danger of perishing of cold.\n\n\"Turn her into something that does not mind the cold,\" seemed a good\nsuggestion of the doctor's, but the only thing they could think of\nthat does not mind cold was a snowflake. \"And it might melt,\" the Queen\npointed out, so that idea had to be given up.\n\nA magnificent attempt was made to carry her to a sheltered spot, but\nthough there were so many of them she was too heavy. By this time all\nthe ladies were crying in their handkerchiefs, but presently the Cupids\nhad a lovely idea. \"Build a house round her,\" they cried, and at once\neverybody perceived that this was the thing to do; in a moment a hundred\nfairy sawyers were among the branches, architects were running round\nMaimie, measuring her; a bricklayer's yard sprang up at her feet,\nseventy-five masons rushed up with the foundation stone and the Queen\nlaid it, overseers were appointed to keep the boys off, scaffoldings\nwere run up, the whole place rang with hammers and chisels and turning\nlathes, and by this time the roof was on and the glaziers were putting\nin the windows.\n\nThe house was exactly the size of Maimie and perfectly lovely. One of\nher arms was extended and this had bothered them for a second, but they\nbuilt a verandah round it, leading to the front door. The windows were\nthe size of a coloured picture-book and the door rather smaller, but it\nwould be easy for her to get out by taking off the roof. The fairies, as\nis their custom, clapped their hands with delight over their cleverness,\nand they were all so madly in love with the little house that they could\nnot bear to think they had finished it. So they gave it ever so many\nlittle extra touches, and even then they added more extra touches.\n\nFor instance, two of them ran up a ladder and put on a chimney.\n\n\"Now we fear it is quite finished,\" they sighed. But no, for another two\nran up the ladder, and tied some smoke to the chimney.\n\n\"That certainly finishes it,\" they cried reluctantly.\n\n\"Not at all,\" cried a glow-worm, \"if she were to wake without seeing a\nnight-light she might be frightened, so I shall be her night-light.\"\n\n\"Wait one moment,\" said a china merchant, \"and I shall make you a\nsaucer.\"\n\nNow alas, it was absolutely finished.\n\nOh, dear no!\n\n\"Gracious me,\" cried a brass manufacturer, \"there's no handle on the\ndoor,\" and he put one on.\n\nAn ironmonger added a scraper and an old lady ran up with a door-mat.\nCarpenters arrived with a water-butt, and the painters insisted on\npainting it.\n\nFinished at last!\n\n\"Finished! how can it be finished,\" the plumber demanded scornfully,\n\"before hot and cold are put in?\" and he put in hot and cold. Then an\narmy of gardeners arrived with fairy carts and spades and seeds and\nbulbs and forcing-houses, and soon they had a flower garden to the\nright of the verandah and a vegetable garden to the left, and roses and\nclematis on the walls of the house, and in less time than five minutes\nall these dear things were in full bloom.\n\nOh, how beautiful the little house was now! But it was at last finished\ntrue as true, and they had to leave it and return to the dance. They\nall kissed their hands to it as they went away, and the last to go was\nBrownie. She stayed a moment behind the others to drop a pleasant dream\ndown the chimney.\n\nAll through the night the exquisite little house stood there in the Figs\ntaking care of Maimie, and she never knew. She slept until the dream\nwas quite finished and woke feeling deliciously cosy just as morning was\nbreaking from its egg, and then she almost fell asleep again, and then\nshe called out, \"Tony,\" for she thought she was at home in the nursery.\nAs Tony made no answer, she sat up, whereupon her head hit the roof,\nand it opened like the lid of a box, and to her bewilderment she saw all\naround her the Kensington Gardens lying deep in snow. As she was not in\nthe nursery she wondered whether this was really herself, so she pinched\nher cheeks, and then she knew it was herself, and this reminded her\nthat she was in the middle of a great adventure. She remembered now\neverything that had happened to her from the closing of the gates up to\nher running away from the fairies, but however, she asked herself, had\nshe got into this funny place? She stepped out by the roof, right over\nthe garden, and then she saw the dear house in which she had passed the\nnight. It so entranced her that she could think of nothing else.\n\n\"Oh, you darling, oh, you sweet, oh, you love!\" she cried.\n\nPerhaps a human voice frightened the little house, or maybe it now knew\nthat its work was done, for no sooner had Maimie spoken than it began to\ngrow smaller; it shrank so slowly that she could scarce believe it\nwas shrinking, yet she soon knew that it could not contain her now. It\nalways remained as complete as ever, but it became smaller and smaller,\nand the garden dwindled at the same time, and the snow crept closer,\nlapping house and garden up. Now the house was the size of a little\ndog's kennel, and now of a Noah's Ark, but still you could see the smoke\nand the door-handle and the roses on the wall, every one complete.\nThe glow-worm light was waning too, but it was still there. \"Darling,\nloveliest, don't go!\" Maimie cried, falling on her knees, for the little\nhouse was now the size of a reel of thread, but still quite complete.\nBut as she stretched out her arms imploringly the snow crept up on all\nsides until it met itself, and where the little house had been was now\none unbroken expanse of snow.\n\nMaimie stamped her foot naughtily, and was putting her fingers to her\neyes, when she heard a kind voice say, \"Don't cry, pretty human, don't\ncry,\" and then she turned round and saw a beautiful little naked boy\nregarding her wistfully. She knew at once that he must be Peter Pan.\n\n\n\n\nXVIII. Peter's Goat\n\nMaimie felt quite shy, but Peter knew not what shy was.\n\n\"I hope you have had a good night,\" he said earnestly.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she replied, \"I was so cosy and warm. But you\"--and she\nlooked at his nakedness awkwardly--\"don't you feel the least bit cold?\"\n\nNow cold was another word Peter had forgotten, so he answered, \"I think\nnot, but I may be wrong: you see I am rather ignorant. I am not exactly\na boy, Solomon says I am a Betwixt-and-Between.\"\n\n\"So that is what it is called,\" said Maimie thoughtfully.\n\n\"That's not my name,\" he explained, \"my name is Peter Pan.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course,\" she said, \"I know, everybody knows.\"\n\nYou can't think how pleased Peter was to learn that all the people\noutside the gates knew about him. He begged Maimie to tell him what they\nknew and what they said, and she did so. They were sitting by this time\non a fallen tree; Peter had cleared off the snow for Maimie, but he sat\non a snowy bit himself.\n\n\"Squeeze closer,\" Maimie said.\n\n\"What is that?\" he asked, and she showed him, and then he did it. They\ntalked together and he found that people knew a great deal about him,\nbut not everything, not that he had gone back to his mother and been\nbarred out, for instance, and he said nothing of this to Maimie, for it\nstill humiliated him.\n\n\"Do they know that I play games exactly like real boys?\" he asked very\nproudly. \"Oh, Maimie, please tell them!\" But when he revealed how he\nplayed, by sailing his hoop on the Round Pond, and so on, she was simply\nhorrified.\n\n\"All your ways of playing,\" she said with her big eyes on him, \"are\nquite, quite wrong, and not in the least like how boys play!\"\n\nPoor Peter uttered a little moan at this, and he cried for the first\ntime for I know not how long. Maimie was extremely sorry for him, and\nlent him her handkerchief, but he didn't know in the least what to do\nwith it, so she showed him, that is to say, she wiped her eyes, and then\ngave it back to him, saying \"Now you do it,\" but instead of wiping his\nown eyes he wiped hers, and she thought it best to pretend that this was\nwhat she had meant.\n\nShe said, out of pity for him, \"I shall give you a kiss if you like,\"\nbut though he once knew he had long forgotten what kisses are, and he\nreplied, \"Thank you,\" and held out his hand, thinking she had offered to\nput something into it. This was a great shock to her, but she felt she\ncould not explain without shaming him, so with charming delicacy she\ngave Peter a thimble which happened to be in her pocket, and pretended\nthat it was a kiss. Poor little boy! he quite believed her, and to this\nday he wears it on his finger, though there can be scarcely anyone who\nneeds a thimble so little. You see, though still a tiny child, it was\nreally years and years since he had seen his mother, and I daresay the\nbaby who had supplanted him was now a man with whiskers.\n\nBut you must not think that Peter Pan was a boy to pity rather than to\nadmire; if Maimie began by thinking this, she soon found she was very\nmuch mistaken. Her eyes glistened with admiration when he told her of\nhis adventures, especially of how he went to and fro between the island\nand the Gardens in the Thrush's Nest.\n\n\"How romantic,\" Maimie exclaimed, but it was another unknown word, and\nhe hung his head thinking she was despising him.\n\n\"I suppose Tony would not have done that?\" he said very humbly.\n\n\"Never, never!\" she answered with conviction, \"he would have been\nafraid.\"\n\n\"What is afraid?\" asked Peter longingly. He thought it must be some\nsplendid thing. \"I do wish you would teach me how to be afraid, Maimie,\"\nhe said.\n\n\"I believe no one could teach that to you,\" she answered adoringly, but\nPeter thought she meant that he was stupid. She had told him about Tony\nand of the wicked thing she did in the dark to frighten him (she knew\nquite well that it was wicked), but Peter misunderstood her meaning and\nsaid, \"Oh, how I wish I was as brave as Tony.\"\n\nIt quite irritated her. \"You are twenty thousand times braver than\nTony,\" she said, \"you are ever so much the bravest boy I ever knew!\"\n\nHe could scarcely believe she meant it, but when he did believe he\nscreamed with joy.\n\n\"And if you want very much to give me a kiss,\" Maimie said, \"you can do\nit.\"\n\nVery reluctantly Peter began to take the thimble off his finger. He\nthought she wanted it back.\n\n\"I don't mean a kiss,\" she said hurriedly, \"I mean a thimble.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" Peter asked.\n\n\"It's like this,\" she said, and kissed him.\n\n\"I should love to give you a thimble,\" Peter said gravely, so he gave\nher one. He gave her quite a number of thimbles, and then a delightful\nidea came into his head! \"Maimie,\" he said, \"will you marry me?\"\n\nNow, strange to tell, the same idea had come at exactly the same time\ninto Maimie's head. \"I should like to,\" she answered, \"but will there be\nroom in your boat for two?\"\n\n\"If you squeeze close,\" he said eagerly.\n\n\"Perhaps the birds would be angry?\"\n\nHe assured her that the birds would love to have her, though I am not so\ncertain of it myself. Also that there were very few birds in winter.\n\"Of course they might want your clothes,\" he had to admit rather\nfalteringly.\n\nShe was somewhat indignant at this.\n\n\"They are always thinking of their nests,\" he said apologetically, \"and\nthere are some bits of you\"--he stroked the fur on her pelisse--\"that\nwould excite them very much.\"\n\n\"They sha'n't have my fur,\" she said sharply.\n\n\"No,\" he said, still fondling it, however, \"no! Oh, Maimie,\" he said\nrapturously, \"do you know why I love you? It is because you are like a\nbeautiful nest.\"\n\nSomehow this made her uneasy. \"I think you are speaking more like a bird\nthan a boy now,\" she said, holding back, and indeed he was even\nlooking rather like a bird. \"After all,\" she said, \"you are only a\nBetwixt-and-Between.\" But it hurt him so much that she immediately\nadded, \"It must be a delicious thing to be.\"\n\n\"Come and be one then, dear Maimie,\" he implored her, and they set off\nfor the boat, for it was now very near Open-Gate time. \"And you are not\na bit like a nest,\" he whispered to please her.\n\n\"But I think it is rather nice to be like one,\" she said in a woman's\ncontradictory way. \"And, Peter, dear, though I can't give them my fur, I\nwouldn't mind their building in it. Fancy a nest in my neck with little\nspotty eggs in it! Oh, Peter, how perfectly lovely!\"\n\nBut as they drew near the Serpentine, she shivered a little, and said,\n\"Of course I shall go and see mother often, quite often. It is not as\nif I was saying good-bye for ever to mother, it is not in the least like\nthat.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" answered Peter, but in his heart he knew it was very like\nthat, and he would have told her so had he not been in a quaking fear\nof losing her. He was so fond of her, he felt he could not live without\nher. \"She will forget her mother in time, and be happy with me,\" he kept\nsaying to himself, and he hurried her on, giving her thimbles by the\nway.\n\nBut even when she had seen the boat and exclaimed ecstatically over its\nloveliness, she still talked tremblingly about her mother. \"You know\nquite well, Peter, don't you,\" she said, \"that I wouldn't come unless\nI knew for certain I could go back to mother whenever I want to? Peter,\nsay it!\"\n\nHe said it, but he could no longer look her in the face.\n\n\"If you are sure your mother will always want you,\" he added rather\nsourly.\n\n\"The idea of mother's not always wanting me!\" Maimie cried, and her face\nglistened.\n\n\"If she doesn't bar you out,\" said Peter huskily.\n\n\"The door,\" replied Maimie, \"will always, always be open, and mother\nwill always be waiting at it for me.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Peter, not without grimness, \"step in, if you feel so sure\nof her,\" and he helped Maimie into the Thrush's Nest.\n\n\"But why don't you look at me?\" she asked, taking him by the arm.\n\nPeter tried hard not to look, he tried to push off, then he gave a great\ngulp and jumped ashore and sat down miserably in the snow.\n\nShe went to him. \"What is it, dear, dear Peter?\" she said, wondering.\n\n\"Oh, Maimie,\" he cried, \"it isn't fair to take you with me if you think\nyou can go back. Your mother\"--he gulped again--\"you don't know them as\nwell as I do.\"\n\nAnd then he told her the woful story of how he had been barred out, and\nshe gasped all the time. \"But my mother,\" she said, \"my mother\"--\n\n\"Yes, she would,\" said Peter, \"they are all the same. I daresay she is\nlooking for another one already.\"\n\nMaimie said aghast, \"I can't believe it. You see, when you went away\nyour mother had none, but my mother has Tony, and surely they are\nsatisfied when they have one.\"\n\nPeter replied bitterly, \"You should see the letters Solomon gets from\nladies who have six.\"\n\nJust then they heard a grating creak, followed by creak, creak, all\nround the Gardens. It was the Opening of the Gates, and Peter jumped\nnervously into his boat. He knew Maimie would not come with him now, and\nhe was trying bravely not to cry. But Maimie was sobbing painfully.\n\n\"If I should be too late,\" she called in agony, \"oh, Peter, if she has\ngot another one already!\"\n\nAgain he sprang ashore as if she had called him back. \"I shall come and\nlook for you to-night,\" he said, squeezing close, \"but if you hurry away\nI think you will be in time.\"\n\nThen he pressed a last thimble on her sweet little mouth, and covered\nhis face with his hands so that he might not see her go.\n\n\"Dear Peter!\" she cried.\n\n\"Dear Maimie!\" cried the tragic boy.\n\nShe leapt into his arms, so that it was a sort of fairy wedding, and\nthen she hurried away. Oh, how she hastened to the gates! Peter, you may\nbe sure, was back in the Gardens that night as soon as Lock-out sounded,\nbut he found no Maimie, and so he knew she had been in time. For long\nhe hoped that some night she would come back to him; often he thought he\nsaw her waiting for him by the shore of the Serpentine as his bark drew\nto land, but Maimie never went back. She wanted to, but she was afraid\nthat if she saw her dear Betwixt-and-Between again she would linger with\nhim too long, and besides the ayah now kept a sharp eye on her. But she\noften talked lovingly of Peter and she knitted a kettle-holder for him,\nand one day when she was wondering what Easter present he would like,\nher mother made a suggestion.\n\n\"Nothing,\" she said thoughtfully, \"would be so useful to him as a goat.\"\n\n\"He could ride on it,\" cried Maimie, \"and play on his pipe at the same\ntime!\"\n\n\"Then,\" her mother asked, \"won't you give him your goat, the one you\nfrighten Tony with at night?\"\n\n\"But it isn't a real goat,\" Maimie said.\n\n\"It seems very real to Tony,\" replied her mother.\n\n\"It seems frightfully real to me too,\" Maimie admitted, \"but how could I\ngive it to Peter?\"\n\nHer mother knew a way, and next day, accompanied by Tony (who was really\nquite a nice boy, though of course he could not compare), they went to\nthe Gardens, and Maimie stood alone within a fairy ring, and then her\nmother, who was a rather gifted lady, said,\n\n \"My daughter, tell me, if you can,\n  What have you got for Peter Pan?\"\n\nTo which Maimie replied,\n\n \"I have a goat for him to ride,\n  Observe me cast it far and wide.\"\n\nShe then flung her arms about as if she were sowing seed, and turned\nround three times.\n\nNext Tony said,\n\n \"If P. doth find it waiting here,\n  Wilt ne'er again make me to fear?\"\n\nAnd Maimie answered,\n\n \"By dark or light I fondly swear\n  Never to see goats anywhere.\"\n\nShe also left a letter to Peter in a likely place, explaining what she\nhad done, and begging him to ask the fairies to turn the goat into one\nconvenient for riding on. Well, it all happened just as she hoped, for\nPeter found the letter, and of course nothing could be easier for the\nfairies than to turn the goat into a real one, and so that is how Peter\ngot the goat on which he now rides round the Gardens every night playing\nsublimely on his pipe. And Maimie kept her promise and never frightened\nTony with a goat again, though I have heard that she created another\nanimal. Until she was quite a big girl she continued to leave presents\nfor Peter in the Gardens (with letters explaining how humans play with\nthem), and she is not the only one who has done this. David does it, for\ninstance, and he and I know the likeliest place for leaving them in, and\nwe shall tell you if you like, but for mercy's sake don't ask us before\nPorthos, for were he to find out the place he would take every one of\nthem.\n\nThough Peter still remembers Maimie he is become as gay as ever, and\noften in sheer happiness he jumps off his goat and lies kicking merrily\non the grass. Oh, he has a joyful time! But he has still a vague memory\nthat he was a human once, and it makes him especially kind to the\nhouse-swallows when they revisit the island, for house-swallows are the\nspirits of little children who have died. They always build in the eaves\nof the houses where they lived when they were humans, and sometimes they\ntry to fly in at a nursery window, and perhaps that is why Peter loves\nthem best of all the birds.\n\nAnd the little house? Every lawful night (that is to say, every night\nexcept ball nights) the fairies now build the little house lest there\nshould be a human child lost in the Gardens, and Peter rides the marshes\nlooking for lost ones, and if he finds them he carries them on his goat\nto the little house, and when they wake up they are in it and when they\nstep out they see it. The fairies build the house merely because it\nis so pretty, but Peter rides round in memory of Maimie and because he\nstill loves to do just as he believes real boys would do.\n\nBut you must not think that, because somewhere among the trees the\nlittle house is twinkling, it is a safe thing to remain in the Gardens\nafter Lock-out Time. If the bad ones among the fairies happen to be out\nthat night they will certainly mischief you, and even though they are\nnot, you may perish of cold and dark before Peter Pan comes round. He\nhas been too late several times, and when he sees he is too late he runs\nback to the Thrush's Nest for his paddle, of which Maimie had told him\nthe true use, and he digs a grave for the child and erects a little\ntombstone and carves the poor thing's initials on it. He does this at\nonce because he thinks it is what real boys would do, and you must have\nnoticed the little stones and that there are always two together. He\nputs them in twos because it seems less lonely. I think that quite the\nmost touching sight in the Gardens is the two tombstones of Walter\nStephen Matthews and Phoebe Phelps. They stand together at the spot\nwhere the parishes of Westminster St. Mary's is said to meet the parish\nof Paddington. Here Peter found the two babes, who had fallen unnoticed\nfrom their perambulators, Phoebe aged thirteen months and Walter\nprobably still younger, for Peter seems to have felt a delicacy about\nputting any age on his stone. They lie side by side, and the simple\ninscriptions read\n\n               +-----------+     +-----------+\n               |           |     |           |\n               |     W     |     |    13a.   |\n               |           |     |    P.P.   |\n               |   St. M   |     |   1841    |\n               |           |     |           |\n               +-----------+     +-----------+\n\nDavid sometimes places white flowers on these two innocent graves.\n\nBut how strange for parents, when they hurry into the Gardens at the\nopening of the gates looking for their lost one, to find the sweetest\nlittle tombstone instead. I do hope that Peter is not too ready with his\nspade. It is all rather sad.\n\n\n\n\nXIX. An Interloper\n\nDavid and I had a tremendous adventure. It was this, he passed the night\nwith me. We had often talked of it as a possible thing, and at last Mary\nconsented to our having it.\n\nThe adventure began with David's coming to me at the unwonted hour of\nsix P.M., carrying what looked like a packet of sandwiches, but proved\nto be his requisites for the night done up in a neat paper parcel. We\nwere both so excited that, at the moment of greeting, neither of us\ncould be apposite to the occasion in words, so we communicated our\nfeelings by signs; as thus, David half sat down in a place where there\nwas no chair, which is his favourite preparation for being emphatic, and\nis borrowed, I think, from the frogs, and we then made the extraordinary\nfaces which mean, \"What a tremendous adventure!\"\n\nWe were to do all the important things precisely as they are done every\nevening at his own home, and so I am in a puzzle to know how it was such\nan adventure to David. But I have now said enough to show you what an\nadventure it was to me.\n\nFor a little while we played with my two medals, and, with the delicacy\nof a sleeping companion, David abstained on this occasion from asking\nwhy one of them was not a Victoria Cross. He is very troubled because I\nnever won the Victoria Cross, for it lowers his status in the Gardens.\nHe never says in the Gardens that I won it, but he fights any boy of\nhis year who says I didn't. Their fighting consists of challenging each\nother.\n\nAt twenty-five past six I turned on the hot water in the bath, and\ncovertly swallowed a small glass of brandy. I then said, \"Half-past\nsix; time for little boys to be in bed.\" I said it in the matter-of-fact\nvoice of one made free of the company of parents, as if I had said it\noften before, and would have to say it often again, and as if there was\nnothing particularly delicious to me in hearing myself say it. I tried\nto say it in that way.\n\nAnd David was deceived. To my exceeding joy he stamped his little foot,\nand was so naughty that, in gratitude, I gave him five minutes with a\nmatchbox. Matches, which he drops on the floor when lighted, are the\ngreatest treat you can give David; indeed, I think his private heaven is\na place with a roaring bonfire.\n\nThen I placed my hand carelessly on his shoulder, like one a trifle\nbored by the dull routine of putting my little boys to bed, and\nconducted him to the night nursery, which had lately been my private\nchamber. There was an extra bed in it tonight, very near my own,\nbut differently shaped, and scarcely less conspicuous was the new\nmantel-shelf ornament: a tumbler of milk, with a biscuit on top of it,\nand a chocolate riding on the biscuit. To enter the room without seeing\nthe tumbler at once was impossible. I had tried it several times,\nand David saw and promptly did his frog business, the while, with an\nindescribable emotion, I produced a night-light from my pocket and\nplanted it in a saucer on the wash-stand.\n\nDavid watched my preparations with distasteful levity, but anon made a\nnoble amend by abruptly offering me his foot as if he had no longer\nuse for it, and I knew by intuition that he expected me to take off his\nboots. I took them off with all the coolness of an old hand, and then\nI placed him on my knee and removed his blouse. This was a delightful\nexperience, but I think I remained wonderfully calm until I came\nsomewhat too suddenly to his little braces, which agitated me\nprofoundly.\n\nI cannot proceed in public with the disrobing of David.\n\nSoon the night nursery was in darkness, but for the glimmer from the\nnight-light, and very still save when the door creaked as a man peered\nin at the little figure on the bed. However softly I opened the door, an\ninch at a time, his bright eyes turned to me at once, and he always made\nthe face which means, \"What a tremendous adventure!\"\n\n\"Are you never to fall asleep, David?\" I always said.\n\n\"When are you coming to bed?\" he always replied, very brave but in\na whisper, as if he feared the bears and wolves might have him. When\nlittle boys are in bed there is nothing between them and bears and\nwolves but the night-light.\n\nI returned to my chair to think, and at last he fell asleep with\nhis face to the wall, but even then I stood many times at the door,\nlistening.\n\nLong after I had gone to bed a sudden silence filled the chamber, and I\nknew that David had awaked. I lay motionless, and, after what seemed\na long time of waiting, a little far-away voice said in a cautious\nwhisper, \"Irene!\"\n\n\"You are sleeping with me to-night, you know, David,\" I said.\n\n\"I didn't know,\" he replied, a little troubled but trying not to be a\nnuisance.\n\n\"You remember you are with me?\" I asked.\n\nAfter a moment's hesitation he replied, \"I nearly remember,\" and\npresently he added very gratefully, as if to some angel who had\nwhispered to him, \"I remember now.\"\n\nI think he had nigh fallen asleep again when he stirred and said, \"Is it\ngoing on now?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The adventure.\"\n\n\"Yes, David.\"\n\nPerhaps this disturbed him, for by-and-by I had to inquire, \"You are not\nfrightened, are you?\"\n\n\"Am I not?\" he answered politely, and I knew his hand was groping in the\ndarkness, so I put out mine and he held on tightly to one finger.\n\n\"I am not frightened now,\" he whispered.\n\n\"And there is nothing else you want?\"\n\n\"Is there not?\" he again asked politely. \"Are you sure there's not?\" he\nadded.\n\n\"What can it be, David?\"\n\n\"I don't take up very much room,\" the far-away voice said.\n\n\"Why, David,\" said I, sitting up, \"do you want to come into my bed?\"\n\n\"Mother said I wasn't to want it unless you wanted it first,\" he\nsqueaked.\n\n\"It is what I have been wanting all the time,\" said I, and then without\nmore ado the little white figure rose and flung itself at me. For the\nrest of the night he lay on me and across me, and sometimes his feet\nwere at the bottom of the bed and sometimes on the pillow, but he always\nretained possession of my finger, and occasionally he woke me to say\nthat he was sleeping with me. I had not a good night. I lay thinking.\n\nOf this little boy, who, in the midst of his play while I undressed him,\nhad suddenly buried his head on my knees.\n\nOf the woman who had been for him who could be sufficiently daring.\n\nOf David's dripping little form in the bath, and how when I essayed to\ncatch him he had slipped from my arms like a trout.\n\nOf how I had stood by the open door listening to his sweet breathing,\nhad stood so long that I forgot his name and called him Timothy.\n\n\n\n\nXX. David and Porthos Compared\n\nBut Mary spoilt it all, when I sent David back to her in the morning, by\ninquiring too curiously into his person and discovering that I had put\nhis combinations on him with the buttons to the front. For this I\nwrote her the following insulting letter. When Mary does anything\nthat specially annoys me I send her an insulting letter. I once had a\nphotograph taken of David being hanged on a tree. I sent her that. You\ncan't think of all the subtle ways of grieving her I have. No woman with\nthe spirit of a crow would stand it.\n\n\"Dear Madam [I wrote], It has come to my knowledge that when you walk\nin the Gardens with the boy David you listen avidly for encomiums of him\nand of your fanciful dressing of him by passers-by, storing them in your\nheart the while you make vain pretence to regard them not: wherefore\nlest you be swollen by these very small things I, who now know David\nboth by day and by night, am minded to compare him and Porthos the\none with the other, both in this matter and in other matters of graver\naccount. And touching this matter of outward show, they are both very\nlordly, and neither of them likes it to be referred to, but they endure\nin different ways. For David says 'Oh, bother!' and even at times hits\nout, but Porthos droops his tail and lets them have their say. Yet is he\nextolled as beautiful and a darling ten times for the once that David is\nextolled.\n\n\"The manners of Porthos are therefore prettier than the manners of\nDavid, who when he has sent me to hide from him behind a tree sometimes\ncomes not in search, and on emerging tamely from my concealment I find\nhim playing other games entirely forgetful of my existence. Whereas\nPorthos always comes in search. Also if David wearies of you he scruples\nnot to say so, but Porthos, in like circumstances, offers you his paw,\nmeaning 'Farewell,' and to bearded men he does this all the time (I\nthink because of a hereditary distaste for goats), so that they conceive\nhim to be enamoured of them when he is only begging them courteously to\ngo. Thus while the manners of Porthos are more polite it may be argued\nthat those of David are more efficacious.\n\n\"In gentleness David compares ill with Porthos. For whereas the one\nshoves and has been known to kick on slight provocation, the other, who\nis noisily hated of all small dogs by reason of his size, remonstrates\nnot, even when they cling in froth and fury to his chest, but carries\nthem along tolerantly until they drop off from fatigue. Again,\nDavid will not unbend when in the company of babies, expecting them\nunreasonably to rise to his level, but contrariwise Porthos, though\nterrible to tramps, suffers all things of babies, even to an exploration\nof his mouth in an attempt to discover what his tongue is like at\nthe other end. The comings and goings of David are unnoticed by\nperambulators, which lie in wait for the advent of Porthos. The strong\nand wicked fear Porthos but no little creature fears him, not the\nhedgehogs he conveys from place to place in his mouth, nor the sparrows\nthat steal his straw from under him.\n\n\"In proof of which gentleness I adduce his adventure with the rabbit.\nHaving gone for a time to reside in a rabbit country Porthos was elated\nto discover at last something small that ran from him, and developing\nat once into an ecstatic sportsman he did pound hotly in pursuit, though\nalways over-shooting the mark by a hundred yards or so and wondering\nvery much what had become of the rabbit. There was a steep path, from\nthe top of which the rabbit suddenly came into view, and the practice of\nPorthos was to advance up it on tiptoe, turning near the summit to\ngive me a knowing look and then bounding forward. The rabbit here did\nsomething tricky with a hole in the ground, but Porthos tore onwards in\nfull faith that the game was being played fairly, and always returned\npanting and puzzling but glorious.\n\n\"I sometimes shuddered to think of his perplexity should he catch the\nrabbit, which however was extremely unlikely; nevertheless he did catch\nit, I know not how, but presume it to have been another than the one of\nwhich he was in chase. I found him with it, his brows furrowed in the\ndeepest thought. The rabbit, terrified but uninjured, cowered beneath\nhim. Porthos gave me a happy look and again dropped into a weighty frame\nof mind. 'What is the next thing one does?' was obviously the puzzle\nwith him, and the position was scarcely less awkward for the rabbit,\nwhich several times made a move to end this intolerable suspense.\nWhereupon Porthos immediately gave it a warning tap with his foot, and\nagain fell to pondering. The strain on me was very great.\n\n\"At last they seemed to hit upon a compromise. Porthos looked over his\nshoulder very self-consciously, and the rabbit at first slowly and then\nin a flash withdrew. Porthos pretended to make a search for it, but you\ncannot think how relieved he looked. He even tried to brazen out his\ndisgrace before me and waved his tail appealingly. But he could not\nlook me in the face, and when he saw that this was what I insisted on he\ncollapsed at my feet and moaned. There were real tears in his eyes, and\nI was touched, and swore to him that he had done everything a dog could\ndo, and though he knew I was lying he became happy again. For so long as\nI am pleased with him, ma'am, nothing else greatly matters to Porthos. I\ntold this story to David, having first extracted a promise from him that\nhe would not think the less of Porthos, and now I must demand the same\npromise of you. Also, an admission that in innocence of heart, for which\nDavid has been properly commended, he can nevertheless teach Porthos\nnothing, but on the contrary may learn much from him.\n\n\"And now to come to those qualities in which David excels over\nPorthos--the first is that he is no snob but esteems the girl Irene\n(pretentiously called his nurse) more than any fine lady, and envies\nevery ragged boy who can hit to leg. Whereas Porthos would have every\nclass keep its place, and though fond of going down into the kitchen,\nalways barks at the top of the stairs for a servile invitation before\nhe graciously descends. Most of the servants in our street have had\nthe loan of him to be photographed with, and I have but now seen him\nstalking off for that purpose with a proud little housemaid who is\nlooking up to him as if he were a warrior for whom she had paid a\nshilling.\n\n\"Again, when David and Porthos are in their bath, praise is due to the\none and must be withheld from the other. For David, as I have noticed,\nloves to splash in his bath and to slip back into it from the hands that\nwould transfer him to a towel. But Porthos stands in his bath drooping\nabjectly like a shamed figure cut out of some limp material.\n\n\"Furthermore, the inventiveness of David is beyond that of Porthos, who\ncannot play by himself, and knows not even how to take a solitary\nwalk, while David invents playfully all day long. Lastly, when David is\ndiscovered of some offence and expresses sorrow therefor, he does\nthat thing no more for a time, but looks about him for other offences,\nwhereas Porthos incontinently repeats his offence, in other words, he\nagain buries his bone in the backyard, and marvels greatly that I know\nit, although his nose be crusted with earth.\n\n\"Touching these matters, therefore, let it be granted that David excels\nPorthos; and in divers similar qualities the one is no more than a match\nfor the other, as in the quality of curiosity; for, if a parcel comes\ninto my chambers Porthos is miserable until it is opened, and I have\nnoticed the same thing of David.\n\n\"Also there is the taking of medicine. For at production of the vial all\ngaiety suddenly departs from Porthos and he looks the other way, but if\nI say I have forgotten to have the vial refilled he skips joyfully,\nyet thinks he still has a right to a chocolate, and when I remarked\ndisparagingly on this to David he looked so shy that there was revealed\nto me a picture of a certain lady treating him for youthful maladies.\n\n\"A thing to be considered of in both is their receiving of punishments,\nand I am now reminded that the girl Irene (whom I take in this matter\nto be your mouthpiece) complains that I am not sufficiently severe with\nDavid, and do leave the chiding of him for offences against myself to\nher in the hope that he will love her less and me more thereby. Which we\nhave hotly argued in the Gardens to the detriment of our dignity. And I\nhere say that if I am slow to be severe to David, the reason thereof is\nthat I dare not be severe to Porthos, and I have ever sought to treat\nthe one the same with the other.\n\n\"Now I refrain from raising hand or voice to Porthos because his great\nheart is nigh to breaking if he so much as suspects that all is not well\nbetween him and me, and having struck him once some years ago never can\nI forget the shudder which passed through him when he saw it was I\nwho had struck, and I shall strike him, ma'am, no more. But when he is\ndetected in any unseemly act now, it is my stern practice to cane my\nwriting table in his presence, and even this punishment is almost more\nthan he can bear. Wherefore if such chastisement inflicted on David\nencourages him but to enter upon fresh trespasses (as the girl Irene\navers), the reason must be that his heart is not like unto that of the\nnoble Porthos.\n\n\"And if you retort that David is naturally a depraved little boy, and\nso demands harsher measure, I have still my answer, to wit, what is the\nmanner of severity meted out to him at home? And lest you should shuffle\nin your reply I shall mention a notable passage that has come to my\nears.\n\n\"As thus, that David having heard a horrid word in the street, uttered\nit with unction in the home. That the mother threatened corporal\npunishment, whereat the father tremblingly intervened. That David\ncontinuing to rejoice exceedingly in his word, the father spoke darkly\nof a cane, but the mother rushed between the combatants. That the\nproblematical chastisement became to David an object of romantic\ninterest. That this darkened the happy home. That casting from his\npath a weeping mother, the goaded father at last dashed from the house\nyelling that he was away to buy a cane. That he merely walked the\nstreets white to the lips because of the terror David must now be\nfeeling. And that when he returned, it was David radiant with hope who\nopened the door and then burst into tears because there was no cane.\nTruly, ma'am, you are a fitting person to tax me with want of severity.\nRather should you be giving thanks that it is not you I am comparing\nwith Porthos.\n\n\"But to make an end of this comparison, I mention that Porthos is ever\nwishful to express gratitude for my kindness to him, so that looking\nup from my book I see his mournful eyes fixed upon me with a passionate\nattachment, and then I know that the well-nigh unbearable sadness which\ncomes into the face of dogs is because they cannot say Thank you to\ntheir masters. Whereas David takes my kindness as his right. But for\nthis, while I should chide him I cannot do so, for of all the ways David\nhas of making me to love him the most poignant is that he expects it of\nme as a matter of course. David is all for fun, but none may plumb the\ndepths of Porthos. Nevertheless I am most nearly doing so when I lie\ndown beside him on the floor and he puts an arm about my neck. On my\nsoul, ma'am, a protecting arm. At such times it is as if each of us knew\nwhat was the want of the other.\n\n\"Thus weighing Porthos with David it were hard to tell which is the\nworthier. Wherefore do you keep your boy while I keep my dog, and so we\nshall both be pleased.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXI. William Paterson\n\nWe had been together, we three, in my rooms, David telling me about the\nfairy language and Porthos lolling on the sofa listening, as one may\nsay. It is his favourite place of a dull day, and under him were some\nsheets of newspaper, which I spread there at such times to deceive my\nhousekeeper, who thinks dogs should lie on the floor.\n\nFairy me tribber is what you say to the fairies when you want them to\ngive you a cup of tea, but it is not so easy as it looks, for all the\nr's should be pronounced as w's, and I forget this so often that David\nbelieves I should find difficulty in making myself understood.\n\n\"What would you say,\" he asked me, \"if you wanted them to turn you\ninto a hollyhock?\" He thinks the ease with which they can turn you into\nthings is their most engaging quality.\n\nThe answer is Fairy me lukka, but though he had often told me this I\nagain forgot the lukka.\n\n\"I should never dream,\" I said (to cover my discomfiture), \"of asking\nthem to turn me into anything. If I was a hollyhock I should soon\nwither, David.\"\n\nHe himself had provided me with this objection not long before, but\nnow he seemed to think it merely silly. \"Just before the time to wither\nbegins,\" he said airily, \"you say to them Fairy me bola.\"\n\nFairy me bola means \"Turn me back again,\" and David's discovery made\nme uncomfortable, for I knew he had hitherto kept his distance of\nthe fairies mainly because of a feeling that their conversions are\npermanent.\n\nSo I returned him to his home. I send him home from my rooms under the\ncare of Porthos. I may walk on the other side unknown to them, but they\nhave no need of me, for at such times nothing would induce Porthos to\ndepart from the care of David. If anyone addresses them he growls softly\nand shows the teeth that crunch bones as if they were biscuits. Thus\namicably the two pass on to Mary's house, where Porthos barks his\nknock-and-ring bark till the door is opened. Sometimes he goes in\nwith David, but on this occasion he said good-bye on the step. Nothing\nremarkable in this, but he did not return to me, not that day nor next\nday nor in weeks and months. I was a man distraught; and David wore\nhis knuckles in his eyes. Conceive it, we had lost our dear Porthos--at\nleast--well--something disquieting happened. I don't quite know what to\nthink of it even now. I know what David thinks. However, you shall think\nas you choose.\n\nMy first hope was that Porthos had strolled to the Gardens and got\nlocked in for the night, and almost as soon as Lock-out was over I was\nthere to make inquiries. But there was no news of Porthos, though\nI learned that someone was believed to have spent the night in the\nGardens, a young gentleman who walked out hastily the moment the gates\nwere opened. He had said nothing, however, of having seen a dog. I\nfeared an accident now, for I knew no thief could steal him, yet even an\naccident seemed incredible, he was always so cautious at crossings; also\nthere could not possibly have been an accident to Porthos without there\nbeing an accident to something else.\n\nDavid in the middle of his games would suddenly remember the great blank\nand step aside to cry. It was one of his qualities that when he knew\nhe was about to cry he turned aside to do it and I always respected his\nprivacy and waited for him. Of course being but a little boy he was\nsoon playing again, but his sudden floods of feeling, of which we never\nspoke, were dear to me in those desolate days.\n\nWe had a favourite haunt, called the Story-seat, and we went back to\nthat, meaning not to look at the grass near it where Porthos used to\nsquat, but we could not help looking at it sideways, and to our distress\na man was sitting on the acquainted spot. He rose at our approach and\ntook two steps toward us, so quick that they were almost jumps, then\nas he saw that we were passing indignantly I thought I heard him give a\nlittle cry.\n\nI put him down for one of your garrulous fellows who try to lure\nstrangers into talk, but next day, when we found him sitting on the\nStory-seat itself, I had a longer scrutiny of him. He was dandiacally\ndressed, seemed to tell something under twenty years and had a handsome\nwistful face atop of a heavy, lumbering, almost corpulent figure, which\nhowever did not betoken inactivity; for David's purple hat (a conceit of\nhis mother's of which we were both heartily ashamed) blowing off as we\nneared him he leapt the railings without touching them and was back with\nit in three seconds; only instead of delivering it straightway he seemed\nto expect David to chase him for it.\n\nYou have introduced yourself to David when you jump the railings without\ntouching them, and William Paterson (as proved to be his name) was at\nonce our friend. We often found him waiting for us at the Story-seat,\nand the great stout fellow laughed and wept over our tales like a\nthree-year-old. Often he said with extraordinary pride, \"You are telling\nthe story to me quite as much as to David, ar'n't you?\" He was of an\ninnocence such as you shall seldom encounter, and believed stories at\nwhich even David blinked. Often he looked at me in quick alarm if David\nsaid that of course these things did not really happen, and unable to\nresist that appeal I would reply that they really did. I never saw him\nirate except when David was still sceptical, but then he would say quite\nwarningly \"He says it is true, so it must be true.\" This brings me to\nthat one of his qualities, which at once gratified and pained me, his\nadmiration for myself. His eyes, which at times had a rim of red, were\never fixed upon me fondly except perhaps when I told him of Porthos and\nsaid that death alone could have kept him so long from my side. Then\nPaterson's sympathy was such that he had to look away. He was shy of\nspeaking of himself so I asked him no personal questions, but concluded\nthat his upbringing must have been lonely, to account for his ignorance\nof affairs, and loveless, else how could he have felt such a drawing to\nme?\n\nI remember very well the day when the strange, and surely monstrous,\nsuspicion first made my head tingle. We had been blown, the three of\nus, to my rooms by a gust of rain; it was also, I think, the first time\nPaterson had entered them. \"Take the sofa, Mr. Paterson,\" I said, as\nI drew a chair nearer to the fire, and for the moment my eyes were off\nhim. Then I saw that, before sitting down on the sofa, he was spreading\nthe day's paper over it. \"Whatever makes you do that?\" I asked, and he\nstarted like one bewildered by the question, then went white and pushed\nthe paper aside.\n\nDavid had noticed nothing, but I was strangely uncomfortable, and,\ndespite my efforts at talk, often lapsed into silence, to be roused from\nit by a feeling that Paterson was looking at me covertly. Pooh! what\nvapours of the imagination were these. I blew them from me, and to prove\nto myself, so to speak, that they were dissipated, I asked him to\nsee David home. As soon as I was alone, I flung me down on the floor\nlaughing, then as quickly jumped up and was after them, and very sober\ntoo, for it was come to me abruptly as an odd thing that Paterson had\nset off without asking where David lived.\n\nSeeing them in front of me, I crossed the street and followed. They were\nwalking side by side rather solemnly, and perhaps nothing remarkable\nhappened until they reached David's door. I say perhaps, for something\ndid occur. A lady, who has several pretty reasons for frequenting the\nGardens, recognised David in the street, and was stooping to address\nhim, when Paterson did something that alarmed her. I was too far off\nto see what it was, but had he growled \"Hands off!\" she could not have\nscurried away more precipitately. He then ponderously marched his\ncharge to the door, where, assuredly, he did a strange thing. Instead of\nknocking or ringing, he stood on the step and called out sharply, \"Hie,\nhie, hie!\" until the door was opened.\n\nThe whimsy, for it could be nothing more, curtailed me of my sleep that\nnight, and you may picture me trying both sides of the pillow.\n\nI recalled other queer things of Paterson, and they came back to me\ncharged with new meanings. There was his way of shaking hands. He now\ndid it in the ordinary way, but when first we knew him his arm had\ndescribed a circle, and the hand had sometimes missed mine and come\nheavily upon my chest instead. His walk, again, might more correctly\nhave been called a waddle.\n\nThere were his perfervid thanks. He seldom departed without thanking me\nwith an intensity that was out of proportion to the little I had done\nfor him. In the Gardens, too, he seemed ever to take the sward rather\nthan the seats, perhaps a wise preference, but he had an unusual way of\nsitting down. I can describe it only by saying that he let go of himself\nand went down with a thud.\n\nI reverted to the occasion when he lunched with me at the Club. We had\ncutlets, and I noticed that he ate his in a somewhat finicking manner;\nyet having left the table for a moment to consult the sweets-card,\nI saw, when I returned, that there was now no bone on his plate. The\nwaiters were looking at him rather curiously.\n\nDavid was very partial to him, but showed it in a somewhat singular\nmanner, used to pat his head, for instance. I remembered, also, that\nwhile David shouted to me or Irene to attract our attention, he usually\nwhistled to Paterson, he could not explain why.\n\nThese ghosts made me to sweat in bed, not merely that night, but often\nwhen some new shock brought them back in force, yet, unsupported,\nthey would have disturbed me little by day. Day, however, had its\nreflections, and they came to me while I was shaving, that ten minutes\nwhen, brought face to face with the harsher realities of life, we see\nthings most clearly as they are. Then the beautiful nature of Paterson\nloomed offensively, and his honest eyes insulted over me. No one come to\nnigh twenty years had a right to such faith in his fellow-creatures. He\ncould not backbite, nor envy, nor prevaricate, nor jump at mean motives\nfor generous acts. He had not a single base story about women. It all\nseemed inhuman.\n\nWhat creatures we be! I was more than half ashamed of Paterson's faith\nin me, but when I saw it begin to shrink I fought for it. An easy task,\nyou may say, but it was a hard one, for gradually a change had come over\nthe youth. I am now arrived at a time when the light-heartedness had\ngone out of him; he had lost his zest for fun, and dubiety sat in the\neyes that were once so certain. He was not doubtful of me, not then, but\nof human nature in general; that whilom noble edifice was tottering. He\nmixed with boys in the Gardens; ah, mothers, it is hard to say, but how\ncould he retain his innocence when he had mixed with boys? He heard your\ntalk of yourselves, and so, ladies, that part of the edifice went down.\nI have not the heart to follow him in all his discoveries. Sometimes\nhe went in flame at them, but for the most part he stood looking on,\nbewildered and numbed, like one moaning inwardly.\n\nHe saw all, as one fresh to the world, before he had time to breathe\nupon the glass. So would your child be, madam, if born with a man's\npowers, and when disillusioned of all else, he would cling for a moment\nlonger to you, the woman of whom, before he saw you, he had heard so\nmuch. How you would strive to cheat him, even as I strove to hide my\nreal self from Paterson, and still you would strive as I strove after\nyou knew the game was up.\n\nThe sorrowful eyes of Paterson stripped me bare. There were days when I\ncould not endure looking at him, though surely I have long ceased to be\na vain man. He still met us in the Gardens, but for hours he and I would\nbe together without speaking. It was so upon the last day, one of those\ninnumerable dreary days when David, having sneezed the night before,\nwas kept at home in flannel, and I sat alone with Paterson on the\nStory-seat. At last I turned to address him. Never had we spoken of what\nchained our tongues, and I meant only to say now that we must go, for\nsoon the gates would close, but when I looked at him I saw that he was\nmore mournful than ever before; he shut his eyes so tightly that a drop\nof blood fell from them.\n\n\"It was all over, Paterson, long ago,\" I broke out harshly, \"why do we\nlinger?\"\n\nHe beat his hands together miserably, and yet cast me appealing looks\nthat had much affection in them.\n\n\"You expected too much of me,\" I told him, and he bowed his head. \"I\ndon't know where you brought your grand ideas of men and women from. I\ndon't want to know,\" I added hastily.\n\n\"But it must have been from a prettier world than this,\" I said: \"are\nyou quite sure that you were wise in leaving it?\"\n\nHe rose and sat down again. \"I wanted to know you,\" he replied slowly,\n\"I wanted to be like you.\"\n\n\"And now you know me,\" I said, \"do you want to be like me still? I am a\ncurious person to attach oneself to, Paterson; don't you see that even\nDavid often smiles at me when he thinks he is unobserved. I work very\nhard to retain that little boy's love; but I shall lose him soon; even\nnow I am not what I was to him; in a year or two at longest, Paterson,\nDavid will grow out of me.\"\n\nThe poor fellow shot out his hand to me, but \"No,\" said I, \"you have\nfound me out. Everybody finds me out except my dog, and that is why the\nloss of him makes such a difference to me. Shall we go, Paterson?\"\n\nHe would not come with me, and I left him on the seat; when I was far\naway I looked back, and he was still sitting there forlornly.\n\nFor long I could not close my ears that night: I lay listening, I knew\nnot what for. A scare was on me that made me dislike the dark, and I\nswitched on the light and slept at last. I was roused by a great to-do\nin the early morning, servants knocking excitedly, and my door opened,\nand the dear Porthos I had mourned so long tore in. They had heard his\nbark, but whence he came no one knew.\n\nHe was in excellent condition, and after he had leaped upon me from all\npoints I flung him on the floor by a trick I know, and lay down beside\nhim, while he put his protecting arm round me and looked at me with the\nold adoring eyes.\n\nBut we never saw Paterson again. You may think as you choose.\n\n\n\n\nXXII. Joey\n\nWise children always choose a mother who was a shocking flirt in\nher maiden days, and so had several offers before she accepted their\nfortunate papa. The reason they do this is because every offer refused\nby their mother means another pantomime to them. You see you can't trust\nto your father's taking you to the pantomime, but you can trust to\nevery one of the poor frenzied gentlemen for whom that lady has wept a\ndelicious little tear on her lovely little cambric handkerchief. It is\npretty (but dreadfully affecting) to see them on Boxing Night gathering\ntogether the babies of their old loves. Some knock at but one door and\nbring a hansom, but others go from street to street in private 'buses,\nand even wear false noses to conceal the sufferings you inflict upon\nthem as you grew more and more like your sweet cruel mamma.\n\nSo I took David to the pantomime, and I hope you follow my reasoning,\nfor I don't. He went with the fairest anticipations, pausing on the\nthreshold to peer through the hole in the little house called \"Pay\nHere,\" which he thought was Red Riding Hood's residence, and asked\npolitely whether he might see her, but they said she had gone to the\nwood, and it was quite true, for there she was in the wood gathering a\nstick for her grandmother's fire. She sang a beautiful song about the\nBoys and their dashing ways, which flattered David considerably, but she\nforgot to take away the stick after all. Other parts of the play were\nnot so nice, but David thought it all lovely, he really did.\n\nYet he left the place in tears. All the way home he sobbed in the\ndarkest corner of the growler, and if I tried to comfort him he struck\nme.\n\nThe clown had done it, that man of whom he expected things so fair. He\nhad asked in a loud voice of the middling funny gentleman (then in the\nmiddle of a song) whether he thought Joey would be long in coming, and\nwhen at last Joey did come he screamed out, \"How do you do, Joey!\" and\nwent into convulsions of mirth.\n\nJoey and his father were shadowing a pork-butcher's shop, pocketing the\nsausages for which their family has such a fatal weakness, and so when\nthe butcher engaged Joey as his assistant there was soon not a sausage\nleft. However, this did not matter, for there was a box rather like an\nice-cream machine, and you put chunks of pork in at one end and turned\na handle and they came out as sausages at the other end. Joey quite\nenjoyed doing this, and you could see that the sausages were excellent\nby the way he licked his fingers after touching them, but soon\nthere were no more pieces of pork, and just then a dear little Irish\nterrier-dog came trotting down the street, so what did Joey do but pop\nit into the machine and it came out at the other end as sausages.\n\nIt was this callous act that turned all David's mirth to woe, and drove\nus weeping to our growler.\n\nHeaven knows I have no wish to defend this cruel deed, but as Joey told\nme afterward, it is very difficult to say what they will think funny and\nwhat barbarous. I was forced to admit to him that David had perceived\nonly the joyous in the pokering of the policeman's legs, and had called\nout heartily \"Do it again!\" every time Joey knocked the pantaloon down\nwith one kick and helped him up with another.\n\n\"It hurts the poor chap,\" I was told by Joey, whom I was agreeably\nsurprised to find by no means wanting in the more humane feelings, \"and\nhe wouldn't stand it if there wasn't the laugh to encourage him.\"\n\nHe maintained that the dog got that laugh to encourage him also.\n\nHowever, he had not got it from David, whose mother and father and nurse\ncombined could not comfort him, though they swore that the dog was still\nalive and kicking, which might all have been very well had not David\nseen the sausages. It was to inquire whether anything could be done to\natone that in considerable trepidation I sent in my card to the clown,\nand the result of our talk was that he invited me and David to have tea\nwith him on Thursday next at his lodgings.\n\n\"I sha'n't laugh,\" David said, nobly true to the memory of the little\ndog, \"I sha'n't laugh once,\" and he closed his jaws very tightly as we\ndrew near the house in Soho where Joey lodged. But he also gripped my\nhand, like one who knew that it would be an ordeal not to laugh.\n\nThe house was rather like the ordinary kind, but there was a convenient\nsausage-shop exactly opposite (trust Joey for that) and we saw a\npoliceman in the street looking the other way, as they always do look\njust before you rub them. A woman wearing the same kind of clothes as\npeople in other houses wear, told us to go up to the second floor, and\nshe grinned at David, as if she had heard about him; so up we went,\nDavid muttering through his clenched teeth, \"I sha'n't laugh,\" and as\nsoon as we knocked a voice called out, \"Here we are again!\" at which a\nshudder passed through David as if he feared that he had set himself an\nimpossible task. In we went, however, and though the voice had certainly\ncome from this room we found nobody there. I looked in bewilderment at\nDavid, and he quickly put his hand over his mouth.\n\nIt was a funny room, of course, but not so funny as you might expect;\nthere were droll things in it, but they did nothing funny, you could\nsee that they were just waiting for Joey. There were padded chairs\nwith friendly looking rents down the middle of them, and a table and a\nhorse-hair sofa, and we sat down very cautiously on the sofa but nothing\nhappened to us.\n\nThe biggest piece of furniture was an enormous wicker trunk, with a very\nlively coloured stocking dangling out at a hole in it, and a notice on\nthe top that Joey was the funniest man on earth. David tried to pull the\nstocking out of the hole, but it was so long that it never came to an\nend, and when it measured six times the length of the room he had to\ncover his mouth again.\n\n\"I'm not laughing,\" he said to me, quite fiercely. He even managed not\nto laugh (though he did gulp) when we discovered on the mantelpiece a\nphotograph of Joey in ordinary clothes, the garments he wore before he\nbecame a clown. You can't think how absurd he looked in them. But David\ndidn't laugh.\n\nSuddenly Joey was standing beside us, it could not have been more\nsudden though he had come from beneath the table, and he was wearing his\npantomime clothes (which he told us afterward were the only clothes he\nhad) and his red and white face was so funny that David made gurgling\nsounds, which were his laugh trying to force a passage.\n\nI introduced David, who offered his hand stiffly, but Joey, instead of\ntaking it, put out his tongue and waggled it, and this was so droll that\nDavid had again to save himself by clapping his hand over his mouth.\nJoey thought he had toothache, so I explained what it really meant,\nand then Joey said, \"Oh, I shall soon make him laugh,\" whereupon the\nfollowing conversation took place between them:\n\n\"No, you sha'n't,\" said David doggedly.\n\n\"Yes, I shall.\"\n\n\"No, you sha'n't not.\"\n\n\"Yes, I shall so.\"\n\n\"Sha'n't, sha'n't, sha'n't.\"\n\n\"Shall, shall, shall.\"\n\n\"You shut up.\"\n\n\"You're another.\"\n\nBy this time Joey was in a frightful way (because he saw he was getting\nthe worst of it), and he boasted that he had David's laugh in his\npocket, and David challenged him to produce it, and Joey searched his\npockets and brought out the most unexpected articles, including a duck\nand a bunch of carrots; and you could see by his manner that the simple\nsoul thought these were things which all boys carried loose in their\npockets.\n\nI daresay David would have had to laugh in the end, had there not been a\nhalf-gnawed sausage in one of the pockets, and the sight of it reminded\nhim so cruelly of the poor dog's fate that he howled, and Joey's heart\nwas touched at last, and he also wept, but he wiped his eyes with the\nduck.\n\nIt was at this touching moment that the pantaloon hobbled in, also\ndressed as we had seen him last, and carrying, unfortunately, a\ntrayful of sausages, which at once increased the general gloom, for he\nannounced, in his squeaky voice, that they were the very sausages that\nhad lately been the dog.\n\nThen Joey seemed to have a great idea, and his excitement was so\nimpressive that we stood gazing at him. First, he counted the sausages,\nand said that they were two short, and he found the missing two up the\npantaloon's sleeve. Then he ran out of the room and came back with the\nsausage-machine; and what do you think he did? He put all the sausages\ninto the end of the machine that they had issued from, and turned the\nhandle backward, and then out came the dog at the other end!\n\nCan you picture the joy of David?\n\nHe clasped the dear little terrier in his arms; and then we noticed that\nthere was a sausage adhering to its tail. The pantaloon said we must\nhave put in a sausage too many, but Joey said the machine had not worked\nquite smoothly and that he feared this sausage was the dog's bark, which\ndistressed David, for he saw how awkward it must be to a dog to have its\nbark outside, and we were considering what should be done when the dog\nclosed the discussion by swallowing the sausage.\n\nAfter that, David had the most hilarious hour of his life, entering\ninto the childish pleasures of this family as heartily as if he had been\nbrought up on sausages, and knocking the pantaloon down repeatedly. You\nmust not think that he did this viciously; he did it to please the old\ngentleman, who begged him to do it, and always shook hands warmly and\nsaid \"Thank you,\" when he had done it. They are quite a simple people.\n\nJoey called David and me \"Sonny,\" and asked David, who addressed him as\n\"Mr. Clown,\" to call him Joey. He also told us that the pantaloon's name\nwas old Joey, and the columbine's Josy, and the harlequin's Joeykin.\n\nWe were sorry to hear that old Joey gave him a good deal of trouble.\nThis was because his memory is so bad that he often forgets whether it\nis your head or your feet you should stand on, and he usually begins the\nday by standing on the end that happens to get out of bed first. Thus\nhe requires constant watching, and the worst of it is, you dare not draw\nattention to his mistake, he is so shrinkingly sensitive about it. No\nsooner had Joey told us this than the poor old fellow began to turn\nupside down and stood on his head; but we pretended not to notice, and\ntalked about the weather until he came to.\n\nJosy and Joeykin, all skirts and spangles, were with us by this time,\nfor they had been invited to tea. They came in dancing, and danced off\nand on most of the time. Even in the middle of what they were saying\nthey would begin to flutter; it was not so much that they meant to\ndance as that the slightest thing set them going, such as sitting in a\ndraught; and David found he could blow them about the room like pieces\nof paper. You could see by the shortness of Josy's dress that she was\nvery young indeed, and at first this made him shy, as he always is when\nintroduced formally to little girls, and he stood sucking his thumb, and\nso did she, but soon the stiffness wore off and they sat together on the\nsofa, holding each other's hands.\n\nAll this time the harlequin was rotating like a beautiful fish, and\nDavid requested him to jump through the wall, at which he is such an\nadept, and first he said he would, and then he said better not, for the\nlast time he did it the people in the next house had made such a fuss.\nDavid had to admit that it must be rather startling to the people on the\nother side of the wall, but he was sorry.\n\nBy this time tea was ready, and Josy, who poured out, remembered to ask\nif you took milk with just one drop of tea in it, exactly as her mother\nwould have asked. There was nothing to eat, of course, except sausages,\nbut what a number of them there were! hundreds at least, strings of\nsausages, and every now and then Joey jumped up and played skipping rope\nwith them. David had been taught not to look greedy, even though he felt\ngreedy, and he was shocked to see the way in which Joey and old Joey\nand even Josy eyed the sausages they had given him. Soon Josy developed\nnobler feelings, for she and Joeykin suddenly fell madly in love with\neach other across the table, but unaffected by this pretty picture, Joey\ncontinued to put whole sausages in his mouth at a time, and then rubbed\nhimself a little lower down, while old Joey secreted them about his\nperson; and when David wasn't looking they both pounced on his sausages,\nand yet as they gobbled they were constantly running to the top of the\nstair and screaming to the servant to bring up more sausages.\n\nYou could see that Joey (if you caught him with his hand in your plate)\nwas a bit ashamed of himself, and he admitted to us that sausages were a\npassion with him.\n\nHe said he had never once in his life had a sufficient number of\nsausages. They had maddened him since he was the smallest boy. He told\nus how, even in those days, his mother had feared for him, though fond\nof a sausage herself; how he had bought a sausage with his first penny,\nand hoped to buy one with his last (if they could not be got in any\nother way), and that he always slept with a string of them beneath his\npillow.\n\nWhile he was giving us these confidences, unfortunately, his eyes came\nto rest, at first accidentally, then wistfully, then with a horrid gleam\nin them, on the little dog, which was fooling about on the top of the\nsausage-machine, and his hands went out toward it convulsively, whereat\nDavid, in sudden fear, seized the dog in one arm and gallantly clenched\nhis other fist, and then Joey begged his pardon and burst into tears,\neach one of which he flung against the wall, where it exploded with a\nbang.\n\nDavid refused to pardon him unless he promised on wood never to look in\nthat way at the dog again, but Joey said promises were nothing to him\nwhen he was short of sausages, and so his wisest course would be to\npresent the dog to David. Oh, the joy of David when he understood that\nthe little dog he had saved was his very own! I can tell you he was now\nin a hurry to be off before Joey had time to change his mind.\n\n\"All I ask of you,\" Joey said with a break in his voice, \"is to call him\nafter me, and always to give him a sausage, sonny, of a Saturday night.\"\n\nThere was a quiet dignity about Joey at the end, which showed that he\nmight have risen to high distinction but for his fatal passion.\n\nThe last we saw of him was from the street. He was waving his tongue at\nus in his attractive, foolish way, and Josy was poised on Joeykin's hand\nlike a butterfly that had alighted on a flower. We could not exactly see\nold Joey, but we saw his feet, and so feared the worst. Of course they\nare not everything they should be, but one can't help liking them.\n\n\n\n\nXXIII. Pilkington's\n\nOn attaining the age of eight, or thereabout, children fly away from the\nGardens, and never come back. When next you meet them they are ladies\nand gentlemen holding up their umbrellas to hail a hansom.\n\nWhere the girls go to I know not, to some private place, I suppose, to\nput up their hair, but the boys have gone to Pilkington's. He is a man\nwith a cane. You may not go to Pilkington's in knickerbockers made\nby your mother, make she ever so artfully. They must be real\nknickerbockers. It is his stern rule. Hence the fearful fascination of\nPilkington's.\n\nHe may be conceived as one who, baiting his hook with real\nknickerbockers, fishes all day in the Gardens, which are to him but a\npool swarming with small fry.\n\nAbhorred shade! I know not what manner of man thou art in the flesh,\nsir, but figure thee bearded and blackavised, and of a lean tortuous\nhabit of body, that moves ever with a swish. Every morning, I swear,\nthou readest avidly the list of male births in thy paper, and then are\nthy hands rubbed gloatingly the one upon the other. 'Tis fear of thee\nand thy gown and thy cane, which are part of thee, that makes the\nfairies to hide by day; wert thou to linger but once among their haunts\nbetween the hours of Lock-out and Open Gates there would be left not one\nsingle gentle place in all the Gardens. The little people would flit.\nHow much wiser they than the small boys who swim glamoured to thy crafty\nhook. Thou devastator of the Gardens, I know thee, Pilkington.\n\nI first heard of Pilkington from David, who had it from Oliver Bailey.\n\nThis Oliver Bailey was one of the most dashing figures in the Gardens,\nand without apparent effort was daily drawing nearer the completion\nof his seventh year at a time when David seemed unable to get beyond\nhalf-past five. I have to speak of him in the past tense, for gone is\nOliver from the Gardens (gone to Pilkington's) but he is still a name\namong us, and some lordly deeds are remembered of him, as that his\nfather shaved twice a day. Oliver himself was all on that scale.\n\nHis not ignoble ambition seems always to have been to be wrecked upon\nan island, indeed I am told that he mentioned it insinuatingly in his\nprayers, and it was perhaps inevitable that a boy with such an outlook\nshould fascinate David. I am proud, therefore, to be able to state on\nwood that it was Oliver himself who made the overture.\n\nOn first hearing, from some satellite of Oliver's, of Wrecked Islands,\nas they are called in the Gardens, David said wistfully that he supposed\nyou needed to be very very good before you had any chance of being\nwrecked, and the remark was conveyed to Oliver, on whom it made\nan uncomfortable impression. For a time he tried to evade it, but\nultimately David was presented to him and invited gloomily to say\nit again. The upshot was that Oliver advertised the Gardens of his\nintention to be good until he was eight, and if he had not been wrecked\nby that time, to be as jolly bad as a boy could be. He was naturally so\nbad that at the Kindergarten Academy, when the mistress ordered whoever\nhad done the last naughty deed to step forward, Oliver's custom had been\nto step forward, not necessarily because he had done it, but because he\npresumed he very likely had.\n\nThe friendship of the two dated from this time, and at first I thought\nOliver discovered generosity in hasting to David as to an equal; he also\nwalked hand in hand with him, and even reproved him for delinquencies\nlike a loving elder brother. But 'tis a gray world even in the Gardens,\nfor I found that a new arrangement had been made which reduced Oliver to\nlife-size. He had wearied of well-doing, and passed it on, so to speak,\nto his friend. In other words, on David now devolved the task of being\ngood until he was eight, while Oliver clung to him so closely that the\none could not be wrecked without the other.\n\nWhen this was made known to me it was already too late to break the\nspell of Oliver, David was top-heavy with pride in him, and, faith, I\nbegan to find myself very much in the cold, for Oliver was frankly bored\nby me and even David seemed to think it would be convenient if I went\nand sat with Irene. Am I affecting to laugh? I was really distressed and\nlonely, and rather bitter; and how humble I became. Sometimes when the\ndog Joey is unable, by frisking, to induce Porthos to play with him,\nhe stands on his hind legs and begs it of him, and I do believe I\nwas sometimes as humble as Joey. Then David would insist on my being\nsuffered to join them, but it was plain that he had no real occasion for\nme.\n\nIt was an unheroic trouble, and I despised myself. For years I had\nbeen fighting Mary for David, and had not wholly failed though she was\nadvantaged by the accident of relationship; was I now to be knocked out\nso easily by a seven year old? I reconsidered my weapons, and I fought\nOliver and beat him. Figure to yourself those two boys become as\nfaithful to me as my coat-tails.\n\nWith wrecked islands I did it. I began in the most unpretentious way by\ntelling them a story which might last an hour, and favoured by many an\nunexpected wind it lasted eighteen months. It started as the wreck of\nthe simple Swiss family who looked up and saw the butter tree, but soon\na glorious inspiration of the night turned it into the wreck of David\nA---- and Oliver Bailey. At first it was what they were to do when they\nwere wrecked, but imperceptibly it became what they had done. I spent\nmuch of my time staring reflectively at the titles of the boys' stories\nin the booksellers' windows, whistling for a breeze, so to say, for\nI found that the titles were even more helpful than the stories. We\nwrecked everybody of note, including all Homer's most taking characters\nand the hero of Paradise Lost. But we suffered them not to land. We\nstripped them of what we wanted and left them to wander the high seas\nnaked of adventure. And all this was merely the beginning.\n\nBy this time I had been cast upon the island. It was not my own\nproposal, but David knew my wishes, and he made it all right for me with\nOliver. They found me among the breakers with a large dog, which had\nkept me afloat throughout that terrible night. I was the sole survivor\nof the ill-fated Anna Pink. So exhausted was I that they had to carry\nme to their hut, and great was my gratitude when on opening my eyes, I\nfound myself in that romantic edifice instead of in Davy Jones's locker.\nAs we walked in the Gardens I told them of the hut they had built; and\nthey were inflated but not surprised. On the other hand they looked for\nsurprise from me.\n\n\"Did we tell you about the turtle we turned on its back?\" asked Oliver,\nreverting to deeds of theirs of which I had previously told them.\n\n\"You did.\"\n\n\"Who turned it?\" demanded David, not as one who needed information but\nafter the manner of a schoolmaster.\n\n\"It was turned,\" I said, \"by David A----, the younger of the two\nyouths.\"\n\n\"Who made the monkeys fling cocoa-nuts at him?\" asked the older of the\ntwo youths.\n\n\"Oliver Bailey,\" I replied.\n\n\"Was it Oliver,\" asked David sharply, \"that found the cocoa-nut-tree\nfirst?\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" I answered, \"it was first observed by David,\nwho immediately climbed it, remarking, 'This is certainly the\ncocos-nucifera, for, see, dear Oliver, the slender columns supporting\nthe crown of leaves which fall with a grace that no art can imitate.'\"\n\n\"That's what I said,\" remarked David with a wave of his hand.\n\n\"I said things like that, too,\" Oliver insisted.\n\n\"No, you didn't then,\" said David.\n\n\"Yes, I did so.\"\n\n\"No, you didn't so.\"\n\n\"Shut up.\"\n\n\"Well, then, let's hear one you said.\"\n\nOliver looked appealingly at me. \"The following,\" I announced, \"is\none that Oliver said: 'Truly dear comrade, though the perils of these\nhappenings are great, and our privations calculated to break the\nstoutest heart, yet to be rewarded by such fair sights I would endure\nstill greater trials and still rejoice even as the bird on yonder\nbough.'\"\n\n\"That's one I said!\" crowed Oliver.\n\n\"I shot the bird,\" said David instantly.\n\n\"What bird?\"\n\n\"The yonder bird.\"\n\n\"No, you didn't.\"\n\n\"Did I not shoot the bird?\"\n\n\"It was David who shot the bird,\" I said, \"but it was Oliver who saw\nby its multi-coloured plumage that it was one of the Psittacidae, an\nexcellent substitute for partridge.\"\n\n\"You didn't see that,\" said Oliver, rather swollen.\n\n\"Yes, I did.\"\n\n\"What did you see?\"\n\n\"I saw that.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You shut up.\"\n\n\"David shot it,\" I summed up, \"and Oliver knew its name, but I ate it.\nDo you remember how hungry I was?\"\n\n\"Rather!\" said David.\n\n\"I cooked it,\" said Oliver.\n\n\"It was served up on toast,\" I reminded them.\n\n\"I toasted it,\" said David.\n\n\"Toast from the bread-fruit-tree,\" I said, \"which (as you both remarked\nsimultaneously) bears two and sometimes three crops in a year, and also\naffords a serviceable gum for the pitching of canoes.\"\n\n\"I pitched mine best,\" said Oliver.\n\n\"I pitched mine farthest,\" said David.\n\n\"And when I had finished my repast,\" said I, \"you amazed me by handing\nme a cigar from the tobacco-plant.\"\n\n\"I handed it,\" said Oliver.\n\n\"I snicked off the end,\" said David.\n\n\"And then,\" said I, \"you gave me a light.\"\n\n\"Which of us?\" they cried together.\n\n\"Both of you,\" I said. \"Never shall I forget my amazement when I saw you\nget that light by rubbing two sticks together.\"\n\nAt this they waggled their heads. \"You couldn't have done it!\" said\nDavid.\n\n\"No, David,\" I admitted, \"I can't do it, but of course I know that all\nwrecked boys do it quite easily. Show me how you did it.\"\n\nBut after consulting apart they agreed not to show me. I was not shown\neverything.\n\nDavid was now firmly convinced that he had once been wrecked on an\nisland, while Oliver passed his days in dubiety. They used to argue it\nout together and among their friends. As I unfolded the story Oliver\nlistened with an open knife in his hand, and David who was not allowed\nto have a knife wore a pirate-string round his waist. Irene in her usual\ninterfering way objected to this bauble and dropped disparaging remarks\nabout wrecked islands which were little to her credit. I was for defying\nher, but David, who had the knack of women, knew a better way; he\ncraftily proposed that we \"should let Irene in,\" in short, should wreck\nher, and though I objected, she proved a great success and recognised\nthe yucca filamentosa by its long narrow leaves the very day she joined\nus. Thereafter we had no more scoffing from Irene, who listened to the\nstory as hotly as anybody.\n\nThis encouraged us in time to let in David's father and mother, though\nthey never knew it unless he told them, as I have no doubt he did. They\nwere admitted primarily to gratify David, who was very soft-hearted and\nknew that while he was on the island they must be missing him very much\nat home. So we let them in, and there was no part of the story he liked\nbetter than that which told of the joyous meeting. We were in need of\nanother woman at any rate, someone more romantic looking than Irene, and\nMary, I can assure her now, had a busy time of it. She was constantly\nbeing carried off by cannibals, and David became quite an adept at\nplucking her from the very pot itself and springing from cliff to cliff\nwith his lovely burden in his arms. There was seldom a Saturday in which\nDavid did not kill his man.\n\nI shall now provide the proof that David believed it all to be as true\nas true. It was told me by Oliver, who had it from our hero himself. I\nhad described to them how the savages had tattooed David's father, and\nOliver informed me that one night shortly afterward David was discovered\nsoftly lifting the blankets off his father's legs to have a look at the\nbirds and reptiles etched thereon.\n\nThus many months passed with no word of Pilkington, and you may be\nasking where he was all this time. Ah, my friends, he was very busy\nfishing, though I was as yet unaware of his existence. Most suddenly I\nheard the whirr of his hated reel, as he struck a fish. I remember that\ngrim day with painful vividness, it was a wet day, indeed I think it has\nrained for me more or less ever since. As soon as they joined me I saw\nfrom the manner of the two boys that they had something to communicate.\nOliver nudged David and retired a few paces, whereupon David said to me\nsolemnly,\n\n\"Oliver is going to Pilkington's.\"\n\nI immediately perceived that it was some school, but so little did I\nunderstand the import of David's remark that I called out jocularly, \"I\nhope he won't swish you, Oliver.\"\n\nEvidently I had pained both of them, for they exchanged glances and\nretired for consultation behind a tree, whence David returned to say\nwith emphasis,\n\n\"He has two jackets and two shirts and two knickerbockers, all real\nones.\"\n\n\"Well done, Oliver!\" said I, but it was the wrong thing again, and once\nmore they disappeared behind the tree. Evidently they decided that the\ntime for plain speaking was come, for now David announced bluntly:\n\n\"He wants you not to call him Oliver any longer.\"\n\n\"What shall I call him?\"\n\n\"Bailey.\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"He's going to Pilkington's. And he can't play with us any more after\nnext Saturday.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"He's going to Pilkington's.\"\n\nSo now I knew the law about the thing, and we moved on together, Oliver\nstretching himself consciously, and methought that even David walked\nwith a sedater air.\n\n\"David,\" said I, with a sinking, \"are you going to Pilkington's?\"\n\n\"When I am eight,\" he replied.\n\n\"And sha'n't I call you David then, and won't you play with me in the\nGardens any more?\"\n\nHe looked at Bailey, and Bailey signalled him to be firm.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said David cheerily.\n\nThus sharply did I learn how much longer I was to have of him. Strange\nthat a little boy can give so much pain. I dropped his hand and walked\non in silence, and presently I did my most churlish to hurt him by\nending the story abruptly in a very cruel way. \"Ten years have elapsed,\"\nsaid I, \"since I last spoke, and our two heroes, now gay young men,\nare revisiting the wrecked island of their childhood. 'Did we wreck\nourselves,' said one, 'or was there someone to help us?' And the other\nwho was the younger, replied, 'I think there was someone to help us,\na man with a dog. I think he used to tell me stories in the Kensington\nGardens, but I forget all about him; I don't remember even his name.'\"\n\nThis tame ending bored Bailey, and he drifted away from us, but David\nstill walked by my side, and he was grown so quiet that I knew a storm\nwas brewing. Suddenly he flashed lightning on me. \"It's not true,\" he\ncried, \"it's a lie!\" He gripped my hand. \"I sha'n't never forget you,\nfather.\"\n\nStrange that a little boy can give so much pleasure.\n\nYet I could go on. \"You will forget, David, but there was once a boy who\nwould have remembered.\"\n\n\"Timothy?\" said he at once. He thinks Timothy was a real boy, and is\nvery jealous of him. He turned his back to me, and stood alone and\nwept passionately, while I waited for him. You may be sure I begged his\npardon, and made it all right with him, and had him laughing and happy\nagain before I let him go. But nevertheless what I said was true. David\nis not my boy, and he will forget. But Timothy would have remembered.\n\n\n\n\nXXIV. Barbara\n\nAnother shock was waiting for me farther down the story.\n\nFor we had resumed our adventures, though we seldom saw Bailey now. At\nlong intervals we met him on our way to or from the Gardens, and, if\nthere was none from Pilkington's to mark him, methought he looked at us\nsomewhat longingly, as if beneath his real knickerbockers a morsel of\nthe egg-shell still adhered. Otherwise he gave David a not unfriendly\nkick in passing, and called him \"youngster.\" That was about all.\n\nWhen Oliver disappeared from the life of the Gardens we had lofted\nhim out of the story, and did very well without him, extending our\noperations to the mainland, where they were on so vast a scale that we\nwere rapidly depopulating the earth. And then said David one day,\n\n\"Shall we let Barbara in?\"\n\nWe had occasionally considered the giving of Bailey's place to some\nother child of the Gardens, divers of David's year having sought\nelection, even with bribes; but Barbara was new to me.\n\n\"Who is she?\" I asked.\n\n\"She's my sister.\"\n\nYou may imagine how I gaped.\n\n\"She hasn't come yet,\" David said lightly, \"but she's coming.\"\n\n\nI was shocked, not perhaps so much shocked as disillusioned, for though\nI had always suspicioned Mary A---- as one who harboured the craziest\nambitions when she looked most humble, of such presumption as this I had\nnever thought her capable.\n\nI wandered across the Broad Walk to have a look at Irene, and she was\nwearing an unmistakable air. It set me reflecting about Mary's\nhusband and his manner the last time we met, for though I have had no\nopportunity to say so, we still meet now and again, and he has even\ndined with me at the club. On these occasions the subject of Timothy is\nbarred, and if by any unfortunate accident Mary's name is mentioned, we\nimmediately look opposite ways and a silence follows, in which I feel\nsure he is smiling, and wonder what the deuce he is smiling at. I\nremembered now that I had last seen him when I was dining with him at\nhis club (for he is become member of a club of painter fellows, and\nMary is so proud of this that she has had it printed on his card), when\nundoubtedly he had looked preoccupied. It had been the look, I saw now,\nof one who shared a guilty secret.\n\nAs all was thus suddenly revealed to me I laughed unpleasantly at\nmyself, for, on my soul, I had been thinking well of Mary of late.\nAlways foolishly inflated about David, she had been grudging him even to\nme during these last weeks, and I had forgiven her, putting it down to a\nmother's love. I knew from the poor boy of unwonted treats she had been\ngiving him; I had seen her embrace him furtively in a public place, her\nevery act, in so far as they were known to me, had been a challenge to\nwhoever dare assert that she wanted anyone but David. How could I, not\nbeing a woman, have guessed that she was really saying good-bye to him?\n\nReader, picture to yourself that simple little boy playing about the\nhouse at this time, on the understanding that everything was going on\nas usual. Have not his toys acquired a new pathos, especially the engine\nshe bought him yesterday?\n\nDid you look him in the face, Mary, as you gave him that engine? I envy\nyou not your feelings, ma'am, when with loving arms he wrapped you round\nfor it. That childish confidence of his to me, in which unwittingly he\nbetrayed you, indicates that at last you have been preparing him for the\ngreat change, and I suppose you are capable of replying to me that David\nis still happy, and even interested. But does he know from you what it\nreally means to him? Rather, I do believe, you are one who would not\nscruple to give him to understand that B (which you may yet find stands\nfor Benjamin) is primarily a gift for him. In your heart, ma'am, what do\nyou think of this tricking of a little boy?\n\nSuppose David had known what was to happen before he came to you, are\nyou sure he would have come? Undoubtedly there is an unwritten compact\nin such matters between a mother and her first-born, and I desire to\npoint out to you that he never breaks it. Again, what will the other\nboys say when they know? You are outside the criticism of the Gardens,\nbut David is not. Faith, madam, I believe you would have been kinder to\nwait and let him run the gauntlet at Pilkington's.\n\nYou think your husband is a great man now because they are beginning to\ntalk of his foregrounds and middle distances in the newspaper columns\nthat nobody reads. I know you have bought him a velvet coat, and that\nhe has taken a large, airy and commodious studio in Mews Lane, where you\nare to be found in a soft material on first and third Wednesdays. Times\nare changing, but shall I tell you a story here, just to let you see\nthat I am acquainted with it?\n\nThree years ago a certain gallery accepted from a certain artist a\npicture which he and his wife knew to be monstrous fine. But no one\nspoke of the picture, no one wrote of it, and no one made an offer for\nit. Crushed was the artist, sorry for the denseness of connoisseurs was\nhis wife, till the work was bought by a dealer for an anonymous client,\nand then elated were they both, and relieved also to discover that I was\nnot the buyer. He came to me at once to make sure of this, and remained\nto walk the floor gloriously as he told me what recognition means to\ngentlemen of the artistic callings. O, the happy boy!\n\nBut months afterward, rummaging at his home in a closet that is usually\nkept locked, he discovered the picture, there hidden away. His wife\nbacked into a corner and made trembling confession. How could she submit\nto see her dear's masterpiece ignored by the idiot public, and her dear\nhimself plunged into gloom thereby? She knew as well as he (for had\nthey not been married for years?) how the artistic instinct hungers\nfor recognition, and so with her savings she bought the great work\nanonymously and stored it away in a closet. At first, I believe, the man\nraved furiously, but by-and-by he was on his knees at the feet of this\nlittle darling. You know who she was, Mary, but, bless me, I seem to be\npraising you, and that was not the enterprise on which I set out. What\nI intended to convey was that though you can now venture on small\nextravagances, you seem to be going too fast. Look at it how one may,\nthis Barbara idea is undoubtedly a bad business.\n\nHow to be even with her? I cast about for a means, and on my lucky day I\ndid conceive my final triumph over Mary, at which I have scarcely as yet\ndared to hint, lest by discovering it I should spoil my plot. For there\nhas been a plot all the time.\n\nFor long I had known that Mary contemplated the writing of a book, my\ninformant being David, who, because I have published a little volume\non Military tactics, and am preparing a larger one on the same subject\n(which I shall never finish), likes to watch my methods of composition,\nhow I dip, and so on, his desire being to help her. He may have done\nthis on his own initiative, but it is also quite possible that in her\ndesperation she urged him to it; he certainly implied that she had\ntaken to book-writing because it must be easy if I could do it. She\nalso informed him (very inconsiderately), that I did not print my books\nmyself, and this lowered me in the eyes of David, for it was for the\nprinting he had admired me and boasted of me in the Gardens.\n\n\"I suppose you didn't make the boxes neither, nor yet the labels,\" he\nsaid to me in the voice of one shorn of belief in everything.\n\nI should say here that my literary labours are abstruse, the token\nwhereof is many rows of boxes nailed against my walls, each labelled\nwith a letter of the alphabet. When I take a note in A, I drop its into\nthe A box, and so on, much to the satisfaction of David, who likes to\ndrop them in for me. I had now to admit that Wheeler & Gibb made the\nboxes.\n\n\"But I made the labels myself, David.\"\n\n\"They are not so well made as the boxes,\" he replied.\n\nThus I have reason to wish ill to Mary's work of imagination, as I\npresumed it to be, and I said to him with easy brutality, \"Tell her\nabout the boxes, David, and that no one can begin a book until they are\nall full. That will frighten her.\"\n\nSoon thereafter he announced to me that she had got a box.\n\n\"One box!\" I said with a sneer.\n\n\"She made it herself,\" retorted David hotly.\n\nI got little real information from him about the work, partly because\nDavid loses his footing when he descends to the practical, and perhaps\nstill more because he found me unsympathetic. But when he blurted out\nthe title, \"The Little White Bird,\" I was like one who had read the\nbook to its last page. I knew at once that the white bird was the little\ndaughter Mary would fain have had. Somehow I had always known that she\nwould like to have a little daughter, she was that kind of woman, and\nso long as she had the modesty to see that she could not have one, I\nsympathised with her deeply, whatever I may have said about her book to\nDavid.\n\nIn those days Mary had the loveliest ideas for her sad little book, and\nthey came to her mostly in the morning when she was only three-parts\nawake, but as she stepped out of bed they all flew away like startled\nbirds. I gathered from David that this depressed her exceedingly.\n\nOh, Mary, your thoughts are much too pretty and holy to show themselves\nto anyone but yourself. The shy things are hiding within you. If they\ncould come into the open they would not be a book, they would be little\nBarbara.\n\nBut that was not the message I sent her. \"She will never be able to\nwrite it,\" I explained to David. \"She has not the ability. Tell her I\nsaid that.\"\n\nI remembered now that for many months I had heard nothing of her\nambitious project, so I questioned David and discovered that it was\nabandoned. He could not say why, nor was it necessary that he should,\nthe trivial little reason was at once so plain to me. From that moment\nall my sympathy with Mary was spilled, and I searched for some means of\nexulting over her until I found it. It was this. I decided, unknown even\nto David, to write the book \"The Little White Bird,\" of which she had\nproved herself incapable, and then when, in the fulness of time, she\nheld her baby on high, implying that she had done a big thing, I was to\nhold up the book. I venture to think that such a devilish revenge was\nnever before planned and carried out.\n\nYes, carried out, for this is the book, rapidly approaching completion.\nShe and I are running a neck-and-neck race.\n\nI have also once more brought the story of David's adventures to\nan abrupt end. \"And it really is the end this time, David,\" I said\nseverely. (I always say that.)\n\nIt ended on the coast of Patagonia, whither we had gone to shoot the\ngreat Sloth, known to be the largest of animals, though we found his\nsize to have been under-estimated. David, his father and I had flung\nour limbs upon the beach and were having a last pipe before turning in,\nwhile Mary, attired in barbaric splendour, sang and danced before us.\nIt was a lovely evening, and we lolled manlike, gazing, well-content, at\nthe pretty creature.\n\nThe night was absolutely still save for the roaring of the Sloths in the\ndistance.\n\nBy-and-by Irene came to the entrance of our cave, where by the light of\nher torch we could see her exploring a shark that had been harpooned by\nDavid earlier in the day.\n\nEverything conduced to repose, and a feeling of gentle peace crept over\nus, from which we were roused by a shrill cry. It was uttered by Irene,\nwho came speeding to us, bearing certain articles, a watch, a pair of\nboots, a newspaper, which she had discovered in the interior of the\nshark. What was our surprise to find in the newspaper intelligence of\nthe utmost importance to all of us. It was nothing less than this, the\nbirth of a new baby in London to Mary.\n\nHow strange a method had Solomon chosen of sending us the news.\n\nThe bald announcement at once plunged us into a fever of excitement, and\nnext morning we set sail for England. Soon we came within sight of the\nwhite cliffs of Albion. Mary could not sit down for a moment, so hot was\nshe to see her child. She paced the deck in uncontrollable agitation.\n\n\"So did I!\" cried David, when I had reached this point in the story.\n\nOn arriving at the docks we immediately hailed a cab.\n\n\"Never, David,\" I said, \"shall I forget your mother's excitement. She\nkept putting her head out of the window and calling to the cabby to go\nquicker, quicker. How he lashed his horse! At last he drew up at your\nhouse, and then your mother, springing out, flew up the steps and beat\nwith her hands upon the door.\"\n\nDavid was quite carried away by the reality of it. \"Father has the key!\"\nhe screamed.\n\n\"He opened the door,\" I said grandly, \"and your mother rushed in, and\nnext moment her Benjamin was in her arms.\"\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n\"Barbara,\" corrected David.\n\n\"Benjamin,\" said I doggedly.\n\n\"Is that a girl's name?\"\n\n\"No, it's a boy's name.\"\n\n\"But mother wants a girl,\" he said, very much shaken.\n\n\"Just like her presumption,\" I replied testily. \"It is to be a boy,\nDavid, and you can tell her I said so.\"\n\nHe was in a deplorable but most unselfish state of mind. A boy would\nhave suited him quite well, but he put self aside altogether and was\npertinaciously solicitous that Mary should be given her fancy.\n\n\"Barbara,\" he repeatedly implored me.\n\n\"Benjamin,\" I replied firmly.\n\nFor long I was obdurate, but the time was summer, and at last I agreed\nto play him for it, a two-innings match. If he won it was to be a girl,\nand if I won it was to be a boy.\n\n\n\n\nXXV. The Cricket Match\n\nI think there has not been so much on a cricket match since the day when\nSir Horace Mann walked about Broad Ha'penny agitatedly cutting down the\ndaisies with his stick. And, be it remembered, the heroes of Hambledon\nplayed for money and renown only, while David was champion of a lady. A\nlady! May we not prettily say of two ladies? There were no spectators of\nour contest except now and again some loiterer in the Gardens who little\nthought what was the stake for which we played, but cannot we conceive\nBarbara standing at the ropes and agitatedly cutting down the daisies\nevery time David missed the ball? I tell you, this was the historic\nmatch of the Gardens.\n\nDavid wanted to play on a pitch near the Round Pond with which he is\nfamiliar, but this would have placed me at a disadvantage, so I insisted\non unaccustomed ground, and we finally pitched stumps in the Figs. We\ncould not exactly pitch stumps, for they are forbidden in the Gardens,\nbut there are trees here and there which have chalk-marks on them\nthroughout the summer, and when you take up your position with a bat\nnear one of these you have really pitched stumps. The tree we selected\nis a ragged yew which consists of a broken trunk and one branch, and\nI viewed the ground with secret satisfaction, for it falls slightly\nat about four yards' distance from the tree, and this exactly suits my\nstyle of bowling.\n\nI won the toss and after examining the wicket decided to take first\nknock. As a rule when we play the wit at first flows free, but on this\noccasion I strode to the crease in an almost eerie silence. David had\ntaken off his blouse and rolled up his shirt-sleeves, and his teeth were\nset, so I knew he would begin by sending me down some fast ones.\n\nHis delivery is underarm and not inelegant, but he sometimes tries a\nround-arm ball, which I have seen double up the fielder at square leg.\nHe has not a good length, but he varies his action bewilderingly, and\nhas one especially teasing ball which falls from the branches just as\nyou have stepped out of your ground to look for it. It was not, however,\nwith his teaser that he bowled me that day. I had notched a three and\ntwo singles, when he sent me down a medium to fast which got me in two\nminds and I played back to it too late. Now, I am seldom out on a really\ngrassy wicket for such a meagre score, and as David and I changed places\nwithout a word, there was a cheery look on his face that I found very\ngalling. He ran in to my second ball and cut it neatly to the on for a\nsingle, and off my fifth and sixth he had two pretty drives for three,\nboth behind the wicket. This, however, as I hoped, proved the undoing of\nhim, for he now hit out confidently at everything, and with his score at\nnine I beat him with my shooter.\n\nThe look was now on my face.\n\nI opened my second innings by treating him with uncommon respect, for\nI knew that his little arm soon tired if he was unsuccessful, and then\nwhen he sent me loose ones I banged him to the railings. What cared I\nthough David's lips were twitching.\n\nWhen he ultimately got past my defence, with a jumpy one which broke\nawkwardly from the off, I had fetched twenty-three so that he needed\ntwenty to win, a longer hand than he had ever yet made. As I gave him\nthe bat he looked brave, but something wet fell on my hand, and then a\nsudden fear seized me lest David should not win.\n\nAt the very outset, however, he seemed to master the bowling, and soon\nfetched about ten runs in a classic manner. Then I tossed him a Yorker\nwhich he missed and it went off at a tangent as soon as it had reached\nthe tree. \"Not out,\" I cried hastily, for the face he turned to me was\nterrible.\n\nSoon thereafter another incident happened, which I shall always recall\nwith pleasure. He had caught the ball too high on the bat, and I just\nmissed the catch. \"Dash it all!\" said I irritably, and was about to\nresume bowling, when I noticed that he was unhappy. He hesitated, took\nup his position at the wicket, and then came to me manfully. \"I am a\ncad,\" he said in distress, \"for when the ball was in the air I prayed.\"\nHe had prayed that I should miss the catch, and as I think I have\nalready told you, it is considered unfair in the Gardens to pray for\nvictory.\n\nMy splendid David! He has the faults of other little boys, but he has\na noble sense of fairness. \"We shall call it a no-ball, David,\" I said\ngravely.\n\nI suppose the suspense of the reader is now painful, and therefore I\nshall say at once that David won the match with two lovely fours, the\none over my head and the other to leg all along the ground. When I came\nback from fielding this last ball I found him embracing his bat, and\nto my sour congratulations he could at first reply only with hysterical\nsounds. But soon he was pelting home to his mother with the glorious\nnews.\n\nAnd that is how we let Barbara in.\n\n\n\n\nXXVI. The Dedication\n\nIt was only yesterday afternoon, dear reader, exactly three weeks after\nthe birth of Barbara, that I finished the book, and even then it was\nnot quite finished, for there remained the dedication, at which I set\nto elatedly. I think I have never enjoyed myself more; indeed, it is my\nopinion that I wrote the book as an excuse for writing the dedication.\n\n\"Madam\" (I wrote wittily), \"I have no desire to exult over you, yet I\nshould show a lamentable obtuseness to the irony of things were I not\nto dedicate this little work to you. For its inception was yours, and\nin your more ambitious days you thought to write the tale of the little\nwhite bird yourself. Why you so early deserted the nest is not for me\nto inquire. It now appears that you were otherwise occupied. In fine,\nmadam, you chose the lower road, and contented yourself with obtaining\nthe Bird. May I point out, by presenting you with this dedication, that\nin the meantime I am become the parent of the Book? To you the shadow,\nto me the substance. Trusting that you will accept my little offering in\na Christian spirit, I am, dear madam,\" etc.\n\nIt was heady work, for the saucy words showed their design plainly\nthrough the varnish, and I was re-reading in an ecstasy, when, without\nwarning, the door burst open and a little boy entered, dragging in a\nfaltering lady.\n\n\"Father,\" said David, \"this is mother.\"\n\nHaving thus briefly introduced us, he turned his attention to the\nelectric light, and switched it on and off so rapidly that, as was very\nfitting, Mary and I may be said to have met for the first time to the\naccompaniment of flashes of lightning. I think she was arrayed in little\nblue feathers, but if such a costume is not seemly, I swear there were,\nat least, little blue feathers in her too coquettish cap, and that she\nwas carrying a muff to match. No part of a woman is more dangerous than\nher muff, and as muffs are not worn in early autumn, even by invalids, I\nsaw in a twink, that she had put on all her pretty things to wheedle me.\nI am also of opinion that she remembered she had worn blue in the days\nwhen I watched her from the club-window. Undoubtedly Mary is an engaging\nlittle creature, though not my style. She was paler than is her wont,\nand had the touching look of one whom it would be easy to break. I\ndaresay this was a trick. Her skirts made music in my room, but perhaps\nthis was only because no lady had ever rustled in it before. It was\ndisquieting to me to reflect that despite her obvious uneasiness, she\nwas a very artful woman.\n\nWith the quickness of David at the switch, I slipped a blotting-pad\nover the dedication, and then, \"Pray be seated,\" I said coldly, but she\nremained standing, all in a twitter and very much afraid of me, and I\nknow that her hands were pressed together within the muff. Had there\nbeen any dignified means of escape, I think we would both have taken it.\n\n\"I should not have come,\" she said nervously, and then seemed to wait\nfor some response, so I bowed.\n\n\"I was terrified to come, indeed I was,\" she assured me with obvious\nsincerity.\n\n\"But I have come,\" she finished rather baldly.\n\n\"It is an epitome, ma'am,\" said I, seeing my chance, \"of your whole\nlife,\" and with that I put her into my elbow-chair.\n\nShe began to talk of my adventures with David in the Gardens, and of\nsome little things I have not mentioned here, that I may have done for\nher when I was in a wayward mood, and her voice was as soft as her muff.\nShe had also an affecting way of pronouncing all her r's as w's, just as\nthe fairies do. \"And so,\" she said, \"as you would not come to me to be\nthanked, I have come to you to thank you.\" Whereupon she thanked me most\nabominably. She also slid one of her hands out of the muff, and though\nshe was smiling her eyes were wet.\n\n\"Pooh, ma'am,\" said I in desperation, but I did not take her hand.\n\n\"I am not very strong yet,\" she said with low cunning. She said this to\nmake me take her hand, so I took it, and perhaps I patted it a little.\nThen I walked brusquely to the window. The truth is, I begun to think\nuncomfortably of the dedication.\n\nI went to the window because, undoubtedly, it would be easier to address\nher severely from behind, and I wanted to say something that would sting\nher.\n\n\"When you have quite done, ma'am,\" I said, after a long pause, \"perhaps\nyou will allow me to say a word.\"\n\nI could see the back of her head only, but I knew, from David's face,\nthat she had given him a quick look which did not imply that she was\nstung. Indeed I felt now, as I had felt before, that though she\nwas agitated and in some fear of me, she was also enjoying herself\nconsiderably.\n\nIn such circumstances I might as well have tried to sting a sand-bank,\nso I said, rather off my watch, \"If I have done all this for you, why\ndid I do it?\"\n\nShe made no answer in words, but seemed to grow taller in the chair, so\nthat I could see her shoulders, and I knew from this that she was now\nholding herself conceitedly and trying to look modest. \"Not a bit of it,\nma'am,\" said I sharply, \"that was not the reason at all.\"\n\nI was pleased to see her whisk round, rather indignant at last.\n\n\"I never said it was,\" she retorted with spirit, \"I never thought for\na moment that it was.\" She added, a trifle too late in the story,\n\"Besides, I don't know what you are talking of.\"\n\nI think I must have smiled here, for she turned from me quickly, and\nbecame quite little in the chair again.\n\n\"David,\" said I mercilessly, \"did you ever see your mother blush?\"\n\n\"What is blush?\"\n\n\"She goes a beautiful pink colour.\"\n\nDavid, who had by this time broken my connection with the head office,\ncrossed to his mother expectantly.\n\n\"I don't, David,\" she cried.\n\n\"I think,\" said I, \"she will do it now,\" and with the instinct of a\ngentleman I looked away. Thus I cannot tell what happened, but presently\nDavid exclaimed admiringly, \"Oh, mother, do it again!\"\n\nAs she would not, he stood on the fender to see in the mantel-glass\nwhether he could do it himself, and then Mary turned a most candid face\non me, in which was maternity rather than reproach. Perhaps no look\ngiven by woman to man affects him quite so much. \"You see,\" she said\nradiantly and with a gesture that disclosed herself to me, \"I can\nforgive even that. You long ago earned the right to hurt me if you want\nto.\"\n\nIt weaned me of all further desire to rail at Mary, and I felt an\nuncommon drawing to her.\n\n\"And if I did think that for a little while--,\" she went on, with an\nunsteady smile.\n\n\"Think what?\" I asked, but without the necessary snap.\n\n\"What we were talking of,\" she replied wincing, but forgiving me again.\n\"If I once thought that, it was pretty to me while it lasted and it\nlasted but a little time. I have long been sure that your kindness to me\nwas due to some other reason.\"\n\n\"Ma'am,\" said I very honestly, \"I know not what was the reason. My\nconcern for you was in the beginning a very fragile and even a selfish\nthing, yet not altogether selfish, for I think that what first stirred\nit was the joyous sway of the little nursery governess as she walked\ndown Pall Mall to meet her lover. It seemed such a mighty fine thing to\nyou to be loved that I thought you had better continue to be loved for a\nlittle longer. And perhaps having helped you once by dropping a letter\nI was charmed by the ease with which you could be helped, for you must\nknow that I am one who has chosen the easy way for more than twenty\nyears.\"\n\nShe shook her head and smiled. \"On my soul,\" I assured her, \"I can think\nof no other reason.\"\n\n\"A kind heart,\" said she.\n\n\"More likely a whim,\" said I.\n\n\"Or another woman,\" said she.\n\nI was very much taken aback.\n\n\"More than twenty years ago,\" she said with a soft huskiness in her\nvoice, and a tremor and a sweetness, as if she did not know that in\ntwenty years all love stories are grown mouldy.\n\nOn my honour as a soldier this explanation of my early solicitude for\nMary was one that had never struck me, but the more I pondered it now--.\nI raised her hand and touched it with my lips, as we whimsical old\nfellows do when some gracious girl makes us to hear the key in the lock\nof long ago. \"Why, ma'am,\" I said, \"it is a pretty notion, and there may\nbe something in it. Let us leave it at that.\"\n\nBut there was still that accursed dedication, lying, you remember,\nbeneath the blotting-pad. I had no longer any desire to crush her with\nit. I wished that she had succeeded in writing the book on which her\nlongings had been so set.\n\n\"If only you had been less ambitious,\" I said, much troubled that she\nshould be disappointed in her heart's desire.\n\n\"I wanted all the dear delicious things,\" she admitted contritely.\n\n\"It was unreasonable,\" I said eagerly, appealing to her intellect.\n\"Especially this last thing.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she agreed frankly, \"I know.\" And then to my amazement she added\ntriumphantly, \"But I got it.\"\n\nI suppose my look admonished her, for she continued apologetically but\nstill as if she really thought hers had been a romantic career, \"I know\nI have not deserved it, but I got it.\"\n\n\"Oh, ma'am,\" I cried reproachfully, \"reflect. You have not got the great\nthing.\" I saw her counting the great things in her mind, her wondrous\nhusband and his obscure success, David, Barbara, and the other trifling\ncontents of her jewel-box.\n\n\"I think I have,\" said she.\n\n\"Come, madam,\" I cried a little nettled, \"you know that there is lacking\nthe one thing you craved for most of all.\"\n\nWill you believe me that I had to tell her what it was? And when I had\ntold her she exclaimed with extraordinary callousness, \"The book? I\nhad forgotten all about the book!\" And then after reflection she added,\n\"Pooh!\" Had she not added Pooh I might have spared her, but as it was\nI raised the blotting-pad rather haughtily and presented her with the\nsheet beneath it.\n\n\"What is this?\" she asked.\n\n\"Ma'am,\" said I, swelling, \"it is a Dedication,\" and I walked\nmajestically to the window.\n\nThere is no doubt that presently I heard an unexpected sound. Yet if\nindeed it had been a laugh she clipped it short, for in almost the\nsame moment she was looking large-eyed at me and tapping my sleeve\nimpulsively with her fingers, just as David does when he suddenly likes\nyou.\n\n\"How characteristic of you,\" she said at the window.\n\n\"Characteristic,\" I echoed uneasily. \"Ha!\"\n\n\"And how kind.\"\n\n\"Did you say kind, ma'am?\"\n\n\"But it is I who have the substance and you who have the shadow, as you\nknow very well,\" said she.\n\nYes, I had always known that this was the one flaw in my dedication,\nbut how could I have expected her to have the wit to see it? I was very\ndepressed.\n\n\"And there is another mistake,\" said she.\n\n\"Excuse me, ma'am, but that is the only one.\"\n\n\"It was never of my little white bird I wanted to write,\" she said.\n\nI looked politely incredulous, and then indeed she overwhelmed me. \"It\nwas of your little white bird,\" she said, \"it was of a little boy whose\nname was Timothy.\"\n\nShe had a very pretty way of saying Timothy, so David and I went into\nanother room to leave her alone with the manuscript of this poor little\nbook, and when we returned she had the greatest surprise of the day for\nme. She was both laughing and crying, which was no surprise, for all of\nus would laugh and cry over a book about such an interesting subject\nas ourselves, but said she, \"How wrong you are in thinking this book is\nabout me and mine, it is really all about Timothy.\"\n\nAt first I deemed this to be uncommon nonsense, but as I considered I\nsaw that she was probably right again, and I gazed crestfallen at this\nvery clever woman.\n\n\"And so,\" said she, clapping her hands after the manner of David when he\nmakes a great discovery, \"it proves to be my book after all.\"\n\n\"With all your pretty thoughts left out,\" I answered, properly humbled.\n\nShe spoke in a lower voice as if David must not hear. \"I had only\none pretty thought for the book,\" she said, \"I was to give it a happy\nending.\" She said this so timidly that I was about to melt to her when\nshe added with extraordinary boldness, \"The little white bird was to\nbear an olive-leaf in its mouth.\"\n\nFor a long time she talked to me earnestly of a grand scheme on which\nshe had set her heart, and ever and anon she tapped on me as if to get\nadmittance for her ideas. I listened respectfully, smiling at this young\nthing for carrying it so motherly to me, and in the end I had to remind\nher that I was forty-seven years of age.\n\n\"It is quite young for a man,\" she said brazenly.\n\n\"My father,\" said I, \"was not forty-seven when he died, and I remember\nthinking him an old man.\"\n\n\"But you don't think so now, do you?\" she persisted, \"you feel young\noccasionally, don't you? Sometimes when you are playing with David in\nthe Gardens your youth comes swinging back, does it not?\"\n\n\"Mary A----,\" I cried, grown afraid of the woman, \"I forbid you to make\nany more discoveries to-day.\"\n\nBut still she hugged her scheme, which I doubt not was what had brought\nher to my rooms. \"They are very dear women,\" said she coaxingly.\n\n\"I am sure,\" I said, \"they must be dear women if they are friends of\nyours.\"\n\n\"They are not exactly young,\" she faltered, \"and perhaps they are not\nvery pretty--\"\n\nBut she had been reading so recently about the darling of my youth that\nshe halted abashed at last, feeling, I apprehend, a stop in her mind\nagainst proposing this thing to me, who, in those presumptuous days, had\nthought to be content with nothing less than the loveliest lady in all\nthe land.\n\nMy thoughts had reverted also, and for the last time my eyes saw the\nlittle hut through the pine wood haze. I met Mary there, and we came\nback to the present together.\n\nI have already told you, reader, that this conversation took place no\nlonger ago than yesterday.\n\n\"Very well, ma'am,\" I said, trying to put a brave face on it, \"I will\ncome to your tea-parties, and we shall see what we shall see.\"\n\nIt was really all she had asked for, but now that she had got what she\nwanted of me the foolish soul's eyes became wet, she knew so well that\nthe youthful romances are the best.\n\nIt was now my turn to comfort her. \"In twenty years,\" I said, smiling\nat her tears, \"a man grows humble, Mary. I have stored within me a great\nfund of affection, with nobody to give it to, and I swear to you, on the\nword of a soldier, that if there is one of those ladies who can be got\nto care for me I shall be very proud.\" Despite her semblance of delight\nI knew that she was wondering at me, and I wondered at myself, but it\nwas true.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Little White Bird, by J.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":584,"split":"train"}
