Parallel to this is the romance of Roland Graeme, a dim-witted but spirited youth. He is brought up at the castle of Avenel by Mary Avenel and her husband, Halbert Glendinning. Roland is sent by the Regent Murray to be page to Mary Stuart with directions to guard her. He falls in love with Catherine Seyton, who is one of the ladies-in-waiting to the queen. He is found later to be the heir to Avenel. Edward Glendinning, the brother of Halbert, is the abbot of the title, the last abbot of the monastery described in the preceding novel.Ten years had passed since the final events of The Monastery, during which Halbert had been knighted for his services to the regent, and Lady Avenel had adopted Roland, whom her dog had saved from drowning. The boy grew up petted by his mistress, but disliked by her chaplain and servants; and at length, having threatened to dirk the falconer, he was dismissed to seek his fortune. He had been secretly taught the Romish faith by Father Ambrose, and led by his grandmother to believe that he was of gentle birth. She now introduced him to Catherine Seyton, and then accompanied him to the abbey, where the revels of some masqueraders were interrupted by the arrival of Sir Halbert on his way to Edinburgh, who attached the youth to his train. On reaching the capital he aided Lord Seyton in a street fray, and was introduced to the Earl of Murray, who desired him to be ready to travel at short notice. In company with Adam Woodcock he adjourned to an inn, and was entrusted by Henry Seyton (whom he believed to be Catherine in male attire) with a sword, which he was not to unsheath until commanded by his rightful sovereign. He then learnt that he was to be attached to the household of Queen Mary, and accompanied Lord Lindesay to the castle of Lochleven, situated on an island, where he found Catherine in attendance on her, and was present when, in compliance with a note contained in his sword-sheath, she signed her abdication at the behest of the Secret Council.\nAfter a lapse of several months, during which Henderson attempted to convert him, Roland learnt from Catherine that Father Ambrose had been evicted from his monastery, and he pledged himself, for her sake, to assist the imprisoned queen in recovering her freedom. A plan of escape arranged by George Douglas having failed through the vigilance of the Lady of Lochleven, Roland undertook to forge a false set of keys, and the abbot arrived disguised as a man-at-arms sent by Sir William to take part in guarding the castle. As soon as the curfew had tolled, a preconcerted signal was made from the shore, and Roland contrived to substitute his forged keys for the real ones. At midnight the garden gate was unlocked, a boat was in waiting, Henry Seyton came forward, and the queen, with all her adherents, was safely afloat, when the alarm was given. Roland, however, had run back, ere they started, to turn the locks on their jailers, and, until they were out of reach of musketry, George Douglas protected Mary by placing himself before her. On landing, horses were in readiness, and before daybreak they reached Lord Seyton's castle in West Lothian, which was strongly garrisoned. The next morning, as the queen was endeavouring to make peace between Roland and Henry Seyton, who treated the page as a churl, his grandmother emerged from a recess and declared him to be the son of Julian Avenel, who was killed in the battle with Sir John Foster; Lord Seyton also recognised him, and insisted that his son should shake hands with him.\nSupported by a considerable number of adherents in battle array, and accompanied by the abbot, the royal party moved onwards for Dumbarton, where help from France was expected. They were, however, intercepted by the regent's forces, and a desperate battle ensued. The queen stood near a yew tree, guarded by her devoted admirer George Douglas in close armour, while her page pushed forward to watch the conflict. It had lasted nearly an hour, when Sir Halbert attacked the flank of Mary's supporters, and they were completely routed, Henry Seyton was killed, and Douglas, who was mortally wounded, expired without withdrawing his eyes from her face. Hopeless of further aid, the queen adopted the fatal resolution of trusting to Elizabeth's mercy, and, having bid adieu to her followers, took ship for England. Roland soon afterwards succeeded in obtaining proofs of his claim as the heir of Avenel, and was married to Catherine on her return from two years residence with her unhappy mistress.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Abbot, by Sir Walter Scott\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

It is true, the booksellers did not\ncomplain of the sale, because, unless on very felicitous occasions,\nor on those which are equally the reverse, literary popularity is not\ngained or lost by a single publication. Leisure must be allowed for the\ntide both to flow and ebb. But I was conscious that, in my situation,\nnot to advance was in some Degree to recede, and being naturally\nunwilling to think that the principle of decay lay in myself, I was\nat least desirous to know of a certainty, whether the degree of\ndiscountenance which I had incurred, was now owing to an ill-managed\nstory, or an ill-chosen subject.\n\nI was never, I confess, one of those who are willing to suppose the\nbrains of an author to be a kind of milk, which will not stand above\na single creaming, and who are eternally harping to young authors to\nhusband their efforts, and to be chary of their reputation, lest it grow\nhackneyed in the eyes of men. Perhaps I was, and have always been, the\nmore indifferent to the degree of estimation in which I might be held\nas an author, because I did not put so high a value as many others upon\nwhat is termed literary reputation in the abstract, or at least upon the\nspecies of popularity which had fallen to my share; for though it\nwere worse than affectation to deny that my vanity was satisfied at my\nsuccess in the department in which chance had in some measure enlisted\nme, I was, nevertheless, far from thinking that the novelist or\nromance-writer stands high in the ranks of literature. But I spare the\nreader farther egotism on this subject, as I have expressed my opinion\nvery fully in the Introductory Epistle to the Fortunes of Nigel, first\nedition; and, although it be composed in an imaginary character, it is\nas sincere and candid as if it had been written \u00e2\u0080\u009cwithout my gown and\nband.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn a word, when I considered myself as having been unsuccessful in the\nMonastery, I was tempted to try whether I could not restore, even at\nthe risk of totally losing, my so-called reputation, by a new hazard--I\nlooked round my library, and could not but observe, that, from the time\nof Chaucer to that of Byron, the most popular authors had been the\nmost prolific. Even the aristarch Johnson allowed that the quality\nof readiness and profusion had a merit in itself, independent of the\nintrinsic value of the composition. Talking of Churchill, I believe,\nwho had little merit in his prejudiced eyes, he allowed him that of\nfertility, with some such qualification as this, \u00e2\u0080\u009cA Crab-apple can bear\nbut crabs after all; but there is a great difference in favour of that\nwhich bears a large quantity of fruit, however indifferent, and that\nwhich produces only a few.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLooking more attentively at the patriarchs of literature, whose earner\nwas as long as it was brilliant, I thought I perceived that in the\nbusy and prolonged course of exertion, there were no doubt occasional\nfailures, but that still those who were favourites of their age\ntriumphed over these miscarriages. By the new efforts which they\nmade, their errors were obliterated, they became identified with the\nliterature of their country, and after having long received law from the\ncritics, came in some degree to impose it. And when such a writer was at\nlength called from the scene, his death first made the public sensible\nwhat a large share he had occupied in their attention. I recollected a\npassage in Grimm's Correspondence, that while the unexhausted Voltaire\nsent forth tract after tract to the very close of a long life, the first\nimpression made by each as it appeared, was, that it was inferior to\nits predecessors; an opinion adopted from the general idea that the\nPatriarch of Ferney must at last find the point from which he was to\ndecline. But the opinion of the public finally ranked in succession\nthe last of Voltaire's Essays on the same footing with those which had\nformerly charmed the French nation. The inference from this and similar\nfacts seemed to me to be, that new works were often judged of by the\npublic, not so much from their own intrinsic merit, as from extrinsic\nideas which readers had previously formed with regard to them, and over\nwhich a writer might hope to triumph by patience and by exertion. There\nis risk in the attempt;\n\n   \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf he fall in, good night, or sink or swim.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut this is a chance incident to every literary attempt, and by which\nmen of a sanguine temper are little moved.\n\nI may illustrate what I mean, by the feelings of most men in travelling.\nIf we have found any stage particularly tedious, or in an especial\ndegree interesting, particularly short, or much longer than we expected,\nour imaginations are so apt to exaggerate the original impression, that,\non repeating the journey, we usually find that we have considerably\nover-rated the predominating quality, and the road appears to be duller\nor more pleasant, shorter or more tedious, than what we expected, and,\nconsequently, than what is actually the case. It requires a third or\nfourth journey to enable us to form an accurate judgment of its beauty,\nits length, or its other attributes.\n\nIn the same manner, the public, judging of a new work, which it receives\nperhaps with little expectation, if surprised into applause, becomes\nvery often ecstatic, gives a great deal more approbation than is due,\nand elevates the child of its immediate favour to a rank which, as it\naffects the author, it is equally difficult to keep, and painful to\nlose. If, on this occasion, the author trembles at the height to which\nhe is raised, and becomes afraid of the shadow of his own renown, he may\nindeed retire from the lottery with the prize which he has drawn, but,\nin future ages, his honour will be only in proportion to his labours.\nIf, on the contrary, he rushes again into the lists, he is sure to be\njudged with severity proportioned to the former favour of the public. If\nhe be daunted by a bad reception on this second occasion, he may again\nbecome a stranger to the arena. If, on the contrary, he can keep his\nground, and stand the shuttlecock's fate, of being struck up and down,\nhe will probably, at length, hold with some certainty the level in\npublic opinion which he may be found to deserve; and he may perhaps\nboast of arresting the general attention, in the same manner as the\nBachelor Samson Carrasco, of fixing the weathercock La Giralda of\nSeville for weeks, months, or years, that is, for as long as the wind\nshall uniformly blow from one quarter. To this degree of popularity the\nauthor had the hardihood to aspire, while, in order to attain it, he\nassumed the daring resolution to keep himself in the view of the public\nby frequent appearances before them.\n\nIt must be added, that the author's incognito gave him greater courage\nto renew his attempts to please the public, and an advantage similar to\nthat which Jack the Giant-killer received from his coat of darkness.\nIn sending the Abbot forth so soon after the Monastery, he had used the\nwell-known practice recommended by Bassanio:--\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn my school days, when I had lost one shaft,\n  I shot another of the self-same flight,\n  The self-same way, with more advised watch,\n  To find the other forth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd, to continue the simile, his shafts, like those of the lesser Ajax,\nwere discharged more readily that the archer was as inaccessible\nto criticism, personally speaking, as the Grecian archer under his\nbrother's sevenfold shield.\n\nShould the reader desire to know upon what principles the Abbot was\nexpected to amend the fortune of the Monastery, I have first to request\nhis attention to the Introductory Epistle addressed to the imaginary\nCaptain Clutterbuck; a mode by which, like his predecessors in this walk\nof fiction, the real author makes one of his _dramatis personae_ the\nmeans of communicating his own sentiments to the public, somewhat more\nartificially than by a direct address to the readers. A pleasing French\nwriter of fairy tales, Monsieur Pajon, author of the History of Prince\nSoly, has set a diverting example of the same machinery, where he\nintroduces the presiding Genius of the land of Romance conversing with\none of the personages of the tale.\n\nIn this Introductory Epistle, the author communicates, in confidence, to\nCaptain Clutterbuck, his sense that the White Lady had not met the taste\nof the times, and his reason for withdrawing her from the scene. The\nauthor did not deem it equally necessary to be candid respecting another\nalteration. The Monastery was designed, at first, to have contained some\nsupernatural agency, arising out of the fact, that Melrose had been the\nplace of deposit of the great Robert Bruce's heart. The writer shrunk,\nhowever, from filling up, in this particular, the sketch as it was\noriginally traced; nor did he venture to resume, in continuation, the\nsubject which he had left unattempted in the original work. Thus, the\nincident of the discovery of the heart, which occupies the greater\npart of the Introduction to the Monastery, is a mystery unnecessarily\nintroduced, and which remains at last very imperfectly explained. In\nthis particular, I was happy to shroud myself by the example of the\nauthor of \u00e2\u0080\u009cCaleb Williams,\u00e2\u0080\u009d who never condescends to inform us of the\nactual contents of that Iron Chest which makes such a figure in his\ninteresting work, and gives the name to Mr. Colman's drama.\n\nThe public had some claim to inquire into this matter, but it seemed\nindifferent policy in the author to give the explanation. For, whatever\npraise may be due to the ingenuity which brings to a general combination\nall the loose threads of a narrative, like the knitter at the finishing\nof her stocking, I am greatly deceived if in many cases a superior\nadvantage is not attained, by the air of reality which the deficiency\nof explanation attaches to a work written on a different system. In life\nitself, many things befall every mortal, of which the individual never\nknows the real cause or origin; and were we to point out the most marked\ndistinction between a real and a fictitious narrative, we would say,\nthat the former in reference to the remote causes of the events it\nrelates, is obscure, doubtful, and mysterious; whereas, in the latter\ncase, it is a part of the author's duty to afford satisfactory details\nupon the causes of the separate events he has recorded, and, in a word,\nto account for every thing. The reader, like Mungo in the Padlock, will\nnot be satisfied with hearing what he is not made fully to comprehend.\n\nI omitted, therefore, in the Introduction to the Abbot, any attempt to\nexplain the previous story, or to apologize for unintelligibility.\n\nNeither would it have been prudent to have endeavoured to proclaim,\nin the Introduction to the Abbot, the real spring, by which I hoped\nit might attract a greater degree of interest than its immediate\npredecessor. A taking title, or the announcement of a popular subject,\nis a recipe for success much in favour with booksellers, but which\nauthors will not always find efficacious. The cause is worth a moment's\nexamination.\n\nThere occur in every country some peculiar historical characters, which\nare, like a spell or charm, sovereign to excite curiosity and attract\nattention, since every one in the slightest degree interested in the\nland which they belong to, has heard much of them, and longs to hear\nmore. A tale turning on the fortunes of Alfred or Elizabeth in England,\nor of Wallace or Bruce in Scotland, is sure by the very announcement\nto excite public curiosity to a considerable degree, and ensure the\npublisher's being relieved of the greater part of an impression,\neven before the contents of the work are known. This is of the last\nimportance to the bookseller, who is at once, to use a technical phrase,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cbrought home,\u00e2\u0080\u009d all his outlay being repaid. But it is a different case\nwith the author, since it cannot be denied that we are apt to feel least\nsatisfied with the works of which we have been induced, by titles and\nlaudatory advertisements, to entertain exaggerated expectations.\nThe intention of the work has been anticipated, and misconceived or\nmisrepresented, and although the difficulty of executing the work again\nreminds us of Hotspur's task of \u00e2\u0080\u009co'er-walking a current roaring loud,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n yet the adventurer must look for more ridicule if he fails, than\napplause if he executes, his undertaking.\n\nNotwithstanding a risk, which should make authors pause ere they adopt\na theme which, exciting general interest and curiosity, is often\nthe preparative for disappointment, yet it would be an injudicious\nregulation which should deter the poet or painter from attempting to\nintroduce historical portraits, merely from the difficulty of executing\nthe task in a satisfactory manner. Something must be trusted to the\ngenerous impulse, which often thrusts an artist upon feats of which he\nknows the difficulty, while he trusts courage and exertion may afford\nthe means of surmounting it.\n\nIt is especially when he is sensible of losing ground with the public,\nthat an author may be justified in using with address, such selection of\nsubject or title as is most likely to procure a rehearing. It was with\nthese feelings of hope and apprehension, that I venture to awaken, in\na work of fiction, the memory of Queen Mary, so interesting by her\nwit, her beauty, her misfortunes, and the mystery which still does, and\nprobably always will, overhang her history. In doing so, I was aware\nthat failure would be a conclusive disaster, so that my task was\nsomething like that of an enchanter who raises a spirit over whom he\nis uncertain of possessing an effectual control; and I naturally paid\nattention to such principles of composition, as I conceived were best\nsuited to the historical novel.\n\nEnough has been already said to explain the purpose of composing the\nAbbot. The historical references are, as usual, explained in the notes.\nThat which relates to Queen Mary's escape from Lochleven Castle, is a\nmore minute account of that romantic adventure, than is to be found in\nthe histories of the period.\n\nABBOTSFORD,\n\n1_st January_, 1831.\n\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTORY EPISTLE.\n\nFROM THE AUTHOR OF \u00e2\u0080\u009cWAVERLEY,\u00e2\u0080\u009d TO CAPTAIN CLUTTERBUCK, LATE OF HIS\nMAJESTY'S ---- REGIMENT OF INFANTRY.\n\nDEAR CAPTAIN:\n\nI am sorry to observe, by your last favour, that you disapprove of\nthe numerous retrenchments and alterations which I have been under the\nnecessity of making on the Manuscript of your friend, the Benedictine,\nand I willingly make you the medium of apology to many, who have\nhonoured me more than I deserve.\n\nI admit that my retrenchments have been numerous, and leave gaps in the\nstory, which, in your original manuscript, would have run well-nigh to\na fourth volume, as my printer assures me. I am sensible, besides, that,\nin consequence of the liberty of curtailment you have allowed me, some\nparts of the story have been huddled up without the necessary details.\nBut, after all, it is better that the travellers should have to step\nover a ditch, than to wade through a morass--that the reader should have\nto suppose what may easily be inferred, than be obliged to creep through\npages of dull explanation. I have struck out, for example, the whole\nmachinery of the White Lady, and the poetry by which it is so ably\nsupported, in the original manuscript. But you must allow that\nthe public taste gives little encouragement to those legendary\nsuperstitions, which formed alternately the delight and the terror of\nour predecessors. In like manner, much is omitted illustrative of\nthe impulse of enthusiasm in favour of the ancient religion in Mother\nMagdalen and the Abbot. But we do not feel deep sympathy at this period\nwith what was once the most powerful and animating principle in\nEurope, with the exception of that of the Reformation, by which it was\nsuccessfully opposed.\n\nYou rightly observe, that these retrenchments have rendered the title\nno longer applicable to the subject, and that some other would have been\nmore suitable to the Work, in its present state, than that of THE ABBOT,\nwho made so much greater figure in the original, and for whom your\nfriend, the Benedictine, seems to have inspired you with a sympathetic\nrespect. I must plead guilty to this accusation, observing, at the same\ntime, in manner of extenuation, that though the objection might have\nbeen easily removed, by giving a new title to the Work, yet, in doing\nso, I should have destroyed the necessary cohesion between the present\nhistory, and its predecessor THE MONASTERY, which I was unwilling to do,\nas the period, and several of the personages, were the same.\n\nAfter all, my good friend, it is of little consequence what the work\nis called, or on what interest it turns, provided it catches the public\nattention; for the quality of the wine (could we but insure it) may,\naccording to the old proverb, render the bush unnecessary, or of little\nconsequence.\n\nI congratulate you upon your having found it consistent with prudence\nto establish your Tilbury, and approve of the colour, and of your\nboy's livery, (subdued green and pink.)--As you talk of completing\nyour descriptive poem on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cRuins of Kennaquhair, with notes by an\nAntiquary,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I hope you have procured a steady horse.--I remain, with\ncompliments to all friends, dear Captain, very much\n\nYours, &c. &c. &c.\n\nTHE AUTHOR OF WAVERLEY.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ABBOT.\n\n\n\n\nChapter the First.\n\n\n  _Domum mansit--lanam fecit._\n              Ancient Roman Epitaph.\n\n  She keepit close the hous, and birlit at the quhele.\n                                      GAWAIN DOUGLAS.\n\nThe time which passes over our heads so imperceptibly, makes the\nsame gradual change in habits, manners, and character, as in personal\nappearance. At the revolution of every five years we find ourselves\nanother, and yet the same--there is a change of views, and no less of\nthe light in which we regard them; a change of motives as well as\nof actions. Nearly twice that space had glided away over the head of\nHalbert Glendinning and his lady, betwixt the period of our former\nnarrative, in which they played a distinguished part, and the date at\nwhich our present tale commences.\n\nTwo circumstances only had imbittered their union, which was otherwise\nas happy as mutual affection could render it. The first of these was\nindeed the common calamity of Scotland, being the distracted state of\nthat unhappy country, where every man's sword was directed against his\nneighbour's bosom. Glendinning had proved what Murray expected of him,\na steady friend, strong in battle, and wise in counsel, adhering to him,\nfrom motives of gratitude, in situations where by his own unbiassed will\nhe would either have stood neuter, or have joined the opposite party.\nHence, when danger was near--and it was seldom far distant--Sir Halbert\nGlendinning, for he now bore the rank of knighthood, was perpetually\nsummoned to attend his patron on distant expeditions, or on perilous\nenterprises, or to assist him with his counsel in the doubtful intrigues\nof a half-barbarous court. He was thus frequently, and for a long space,\nabsent from his castle and from his lady; and to this ground of regret\nwe must add, that their union had not been blessed with children, to\noccupy the attention of the Lady of Avenel, while she was thus deprived\nof her husband's domestic society.\n\nOn such occasions she lived almost entirely secluded from the world,\nwithin the walls of her paternal mansion. Visiting amongst neighbors\nwas a matter entirely out of the question, unless on occasions of solemn\nfestival, and then it was chiefly confined to near kindred. Of these the\nLady of Avenel had none who survived, and the dames of the neighbouring\nbarons affected to regard her less as the heiress of the house of Avenel\nthan as the wife of a peasant, the son of a church-vassal, raised up to\nmushroom eminence by the capricious favour of Murray.\n\nThe pride of ancestry, which rankled in the bosom of the ancient gentry,\nwas more openly expressed by their ladies, and was, moreover, imbittered\nnot a little by the political feuds of the time, for most of the\nSouthern chiefs were friends to the authority of the Queen, and very\njealous of the power of Murray. The Castle of Avenel was, therefore, on\nall these accounts, as melancholy and solitary a residence for its lady\nas could well be imagined. Still it had the essential recommendation of\ngreat security. The reader is already aware that the fortress was built\nupon an islet on a small lake, and was only accessible by a causeway,\nintersected by a double ditch, defended by two draw-bridges, so that\nwithout artillery, it might in those days be considered as impregnable.\nIt was only necessary, therefore, to secure against surprise, and\nthe service of six able men within the castle was sufficient for that\npurpose. If more serious danger threatened, an ample garrison was\nsupplied by the male inhabitants of a little hamlet, which, under the\nauspices of Halbert Glendinning, had arisen on a small piece of level\nground, betwixt the lake and the hill, nearly adjoining to the spot\nwhere the causeway joined the mainland. The Lord of Avenel had found\nit an easy matter to procure inhabitants, as he was not only a kind and\nbeneficent overlord, but well qualified, both by his experience in arms,\nhis high character for wisdom and integrity, and his favour with the\npowerful Earl of Murray, to protect and defend those who dwelt under his\nbanner. In leaving his castle for any length of time, he had, therefore,\nthe consolation to reflect, that this village afforded, on the slightest\nnotice, a band of thirty stout men, which was more than sufficient for\nits defence; while the families of the villagers, as was usual on such\noccasions, fled to the recesses of the mountains, drove their cattle\nto the same places of shelter, and left the enemy to work their will on\ntheir miserable cottages.\n\nOne guest only resided generally, if not constantly, at the Castle of\nAvenel. This was Henry Warden, who now felt himself less able for the\nstormy task imposed on the reforming clergy; and having by his zeal\ngiven personal offence to many of the leading nobles and chiefs, did not\nconsider himself as perfectly safe, unless when within the walls of the\nstrong mansion of some assured friend. He ceased not, however, to serve\nhis cause as eagerly with his pen, as he had formerly done with his\ntongue, and had engaged in a furious and acrimonious contest, concerning\nthe sacrifice of the mass, as it was termed, with the Abbot Eustatius,\nformerly the Sub-Prior of Kennaquhair. Answers, replies, duplies,\ntriplies, quadruplies, followed thick upon each other, and displayed, as\nis not unusual in controversy, fully as much zeal as Christian charity.\nThe disputation very soon became as celebrated as that of John Knox\nand the Abbot of Crosraguel, raged nearly as fiercely, and, for aught I\nknow, the publications to which it gave rise may be as precious in the\neyes of bibliographers. [Footnote: The tracts which appeared in the\nDisputation between the Scottish Reformer and Quentin Kennedy, Abbot\nof Crosraguel, are among the scarcest in Scottish Bibliography. See\nM'Crie's _Life of Knox_, p. 258.] But the engrossing nature of his\noccupation rendered the theologian not the most interesting companion\nfor a solitary female; and his grave, stern, and absorbed deportment,\nwhich seldom showed any interest, except in that which concerned his\nreligious profession, made his presence rather add to than diminish the\ngloom which hung over the Castle of Avenel. To superintend the tasks of\nnumerous female domestics, was the principal part of the Lady's daily\nemployment; her spindle and distaff, her Bible, and a solitary walk upon\nthe battlements of the castle, or upon the causeway, or occasionally,\nbut more seldom, upon the banks of the little lake, consumed the rest\nof the day. But so great was the insecurity of the period, that when\nshe ventured to extend her walk beyond the hamlet, the warder on the\nwatch-tower was directed to keep a sharp look-out in every direction,\nand four or five men held themselves in readiness to mount and sally\nforth from the castle on the slightest appearance of alarm.\n\nThus stood affairs at the castle, when, after an absence of several\nweeks, the Knight of Avenel, which was now the title most frequently\ngiven to Sir Halbert Glendinning, was daily expected to return home. Day\nafter day, however, passed away, and he returned not. Letters in\nthose days were rarely written, and the Knight must have resorted to a\nsecretary to express his intentions in that manner; besides, intercourse\nof all kinds was precarious and unsafe, and no man cared to give any\npublic intimation of the time and direction of a journey, since, if his\nroute were publicly known, it was always likely he might in that case\nmeet with more enemies than friends upon the road. The precise day,\ntherefore, of Sir Halbert's return, was not fixed, but that which his\nlady's fond expectation had calculated upon in her own mind had long\nsince passed, and hope delayed began to make the heart sick.\n\nIt was upon the evening of a sultry summer's day, when the sun was\nhalf-sunk behind the distant western mountains of Liddesdale, that the\nLady took her solitary walk on the battlements of a range of buildings,\nwhich formed the front of the castle, where a flat roof of flag-stones\npresented a broad and convenient promenade. The level surface of the\nlake, undisturbed except by the occasional dipping of a teal-duck, or\ncoot, was gilded with the beams of the setting luminary, and reflected,\nas if in a golden mirror, the hills amongst which it lay embossed. The\nscene, otherwise so lonely, was occasionally enlivened by the voices of\nthe children in the village, which, softened by distance, reached the\near of the Lady, in her solitary walk, or by the distant call of the\nherdsman, as he guided his cattle from the glen in which they had\npastured all day, to place them in greater security for the night,\nin the immediate vicinity of the village. The deep lowing of the cows\nseemed to demand the attendance of the milk-maidens, who, singing\nshrilly and merrily, strolled forth, each with her pail on her head,\nto attend to the duty of the evening. The Lady of Avenel looked and\nlistened; the sounds which she heard reminded her of former days, when\nher most important employment, as well as her greatest delight, was\nto assist Dame Glendinning and Tibb Tackett in milking the cows at\nGlendearg. The thought was fraught with melancholy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy was I not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe peasant girl which in all men's eyes I\nseemed to be? Halbert and I had then spent our life peacefully in his\nnative glen, undisturbed by the phantoms either of fear or of ambition.\nHis greatest pride had then been to show the fairest herd in the\nHalidome; his greatest danger to repel some pilfering snatcher from the\nBorder; and the utmost distance which would have divided us, would have\nbeen the chase of some outlying deer. But, alas! what avails the blood\nwhich Halbert has shed, and the dangers which he encounters, to support\na name and rank, dear to him because he has it from me, but which we\nshall never transmit to our posterity! with me the name of Avenel must\nexpire.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe sighed as the reflections arose, and, looking towards the shore of\nthe lake, her eye was attracted by a group of children of various ages,\nassembled to see a little ship, constructed by some village artist,\nperform its first voyage on the water. It was launched amid the shouts\nof tiny voices and the clapping of little hands, and shot bravely forth\non its voyage with a favouring wind, which promised to carry it to the\nother side of the lake. Some of the bigger boys ran round to receive and\nsecure it on the farther shore, trying their speed against each other\nas they sprang like young fawns along the shingly verge of the lake. The\nrest, for whom such a journey seemed too arduous, remained watching the\nmotions of the fairy vessel from the spot where it had been launched.\nThe sight of their sports pressed on the mind of the childless Lady of\nAvenel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy are none of these prattlers mine?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she continued, pursuing the\ntenor of her melancholy reflections. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTheir parents can scarce find them\nthe coarsest food--and I, who could nurse them in plenty, I am doomed\nnever to hear a child call me mother!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe thought sunk on her heart with a bitterness which resembled envy,\nso deeply is the desire of offspring implanted in the female breast. She\npressed her hands together as if she were wringing them in the extremity\nof her desolate feeling, as one whom Heaven had written childless. A\nlarge stag-hound of the greyhound species approached at this moment, and\nattracted perhaps by the gesture, licked her hands and pressed his large\nhead against them. He obtained the desired caresses in return, but still\nthe sad impression remained.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWolf,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, as if the animal could have understood her complaints,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthou art a noble and beautiful animal; but, alas! the love and\naffection that I long to bestow, is of a quality higher than can fall to\nthy share, though I love thee much.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd, as if she were apologizing to Wolf for withholding from him any\npart of her regard, she caressed his proud head and crest, while,\nlooking in her eyes, he seemed to ask her what she wanted, or what he\ncould do to show his attachment. At this moment a shriek of distress\nwas heard on the shore, from the playful group which had been lately so\njovial. The Lady looked, and saw the cause with great agony.\n\nThe little ship, the object of the children's delighted attention, had\nstuck among some tufts of the plant which bears the water-lily, that\nmarked a shoal in the lake about an arrow-flight from the shore. A hardy\nlittle boy, who had taken the lead in the race round the margin of the\nlake, did not hesitate a moment to strip off his _wylie-coat_, plunge\ninto the water, and swim towards the object of their common solicitude.\nThe first movement of the Lady was to call for help; but she observed\nthat the boy swam strongly and fearlessly, and as she saw that one or\ntwo villagers, who were distant spectators of the incident, seemed to\ngive themselves no uneasiness on his account, she supposed that he was\naccustomed to the exercise, and that there was no danger. But whether,\nin swimming, the boy had struck his breast against a sunken rock,\nor whether he was suddenly taken with cramp, or whether he had\nover-calculated his own strength, it so happened, that when he had\ndisembarrassed the little plaything from the flags in which it was\nentangled, and sent it forward on its course, he had scarce swam a few\nyards in his way to the shore, than he raised himself suddenly from the\nwater, and screamed aloud, clapping his hands at the same time with an\nexpression of fear and pain.\n\nThe Lady of Avenel, instantly taking the alarm, called hastily to the\nattendants to get the boat ready. But this was an affair of some time.\nThe only boat permitted to be used on the lake, was moored within the\nsecond cut which intersected the canal, and it was several minutes ere\nit could be unmoored and got under way. Meantime, the Lady of Avenel,\nwith agonizing anxiety, saw that the efforts that the poor boy made to\nkeep himself afloat, were now exchanged for a faint struggling, which\nwould soon have been over, but for aid equally prompt and unhoped-for.\nWolf, who, like some of that large species of greyhound, was a practised\nwater-dog, had marked the object of her anxiety, and, quitting his\nmistress's side, had sought the nearest point from which he could with\nsafety plunge into the lake. With the wonderful instinct which these\nnoble animals have so often displayed in the like circumstances, he\nswam straight to the spot where his assistance was so much wanted,\nand seizing the child's under-dress in his mouth, he not only kept him\nafloat, but towed him towards the causeway. The boat having put off with\na couple of men, met the dog half-way, and relieved him of his burden.\nThey landed on the causeway, close by the gates of the castle, with\ntheir yet lifeless charge, and were there met by the Lady of Avenel,\nattended by one or two of her maidens, eagerly waiting to administer\nassistance to the sufferer.\n\nHe was borne into the castle, deposited upon a bed, and every mode of\nrecovery resorted to, which the knowledge of the times, and the skill\nof Henry Warden, who professed some medical science, could dictate. For\nsome time it was all in vain, and the Lady watched, with unspeakable\nearnestness, the pallid countenance of the beautiful child. He seemed\nabout ten years old. His dress was of the meanest sort, but his long\ncurled hair, and the noble cast of his features, partook not of that\npoverty of appearance. The proudest noble in Scotland might have been\nyet prouder could he have called that child his heir. While, with\nbreathless anxiety, the Lady of Avenel gazed on his well-formed and\nexpressive features, a slight shade of colour returned gradually to the\ncheek; suspended animation became restored by degrees, the child sighed\ndeeply, opened his eyes, which to the human countenance produces the\neffect of light upon the natural landscape, stretched his arms towards\nthe Lady, and muttered the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cMother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d that epithet, of all others,\nwhich is dearest to the female ear.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGod, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the preacher, \u00e2\u0080\u009chas restored the child to your wishes;\nit must be yours so to bring him up, that he may not one day wish that\nhe had perished in his innocence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt shall be my charge,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady; and again throwing her arms\naround the boy, she overwhelmed him with kisses and caresses, so much\nwas she agitated by the terror arising from the danger in which he had\nbeen just placed, and by joy at his unexpected deliverance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you are not my mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the boy, recovering his recollection,\nand endeavouring, though faintly, to escape from the caresses of the\nLady of Avenel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are not my mother,--alas! I have no mother--only I\nhave dreamt that I had one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will read the dream for you, my love,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Lady of Avenel;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cand I will be myself your mother. Surely God has heard my wishes,\nand, in his own marvellous manner, hath sent me an object on which my\naffections may expand themselves.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She looked towards Warden as she\nspoke. The preacher hesitated what he should reply to a burst of\npassionate feeling, which, perhaps, seemed to him more enthusiastic than\nthe occasion demanded. In the meanwhile, the large stag-hound, Wolf,\nwhich, dripping wet as he was, had followed his mistress into the\napartment, and had sat by the bedside, a patient and quiet spectator of\nall the means used for resuscitation of the being whom he had preserved,\nnow became impatient of remaining any longer unnoticed, and began to\nwhine and fawn upon the Lady with his great rough paws.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood Wolf, and you shall be remembered also for your\nday's work; and I will think the more of you for having preserved the\nlife of a creature so beautiful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Wolf was not quite satisfied with the share of attention which he\nthus attracted; he persisted in whining and pawing upon his mistress,\nhis caresses rendered still more troublesome by his long shaggy hair\nbeing so much and thoroughly wetted, till she desired one of the\ndomestics, with whom he was familiar, to call the animal out of the\napartment. Wolf resisted every invitation to this purpose, until his\nmistress positively commanded him to be gone, in an angry tone; when,\nturning towards the bed on which the body still lay, half awake to\nsensation, half drowned in the meanders of fluctuating delirium, he\nuttered a deep and savage growl, curled up his nose and lips, showing\nhis full range of white and sharpened teeth, which might have matched\nthose of an actual wolf, and then, turning round, sullenly followed the\ndomestic out of the apartment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is singular,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, addressing Warden; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe animal is not\nonly so good-natured to all, but so particularly fond of children. What\ncan ail him at the little fellow whose life he has saved?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDogs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the preacher, \u00e2\u0080\u009care but too like the human race in their\nfoibles, though their instinct be less erring than the reason of poor\nmortal man when relying upon his own unassisted powers. Jealousy, my\ngood lady, is a passion not unknown to them, and they often evince it,\nnot only with respect to the preferences which they see given by their\nmasters to individuals of their own species, but even when their rivals\nare children. You have caressed that child much and eagerly, and the dog\nconsiders himself as a discarded favourite.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a strange instinct,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand from the gravity with\nwhich you mention it, my reverend friend, I would almost say that you\nsupposed this singular jealousy of my favourite Wolf, was not only well\nfounded, but justifiable. But perhaps you speak in jest?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI seldom jest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the preacher; \u00e2\u0080\u009clife was not lent to us to\nbe expended in that idle mirth which resembles the crackling of thorns\nunder the pot. I would only have you derive, if it so please you,\nthis lesson from what I have said, that the best of our feelings, when\nindulged to excess, may give pain to others. There is but one in which\nwe may indulge to the utmost limit of vehemence of which our bosom is\ncapable, secure that excess cannot exist in the greatest intensity to\nwhich it can be excited--I mean the love of our Maker.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSurely,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady of Avenel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe are commanded by the same\nauthority to love our neighbour?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Warden, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut our love to God is to be unbounded--we\nare to love him with our whole heart, our whole soul, and our whole\nstrength. The love which the precept commands us to bear to our\nneighbour, has affixed to it a direct limit and qualification--we are to\nlove our neighbour as ourself; as it is elsewhere explained by the great\ncommandment, that we must do unto him as we would that he should do unto\nus. Here there is a limit, and a bound, even to the most praiseworthy of\nour affections, so far as they are turned upon sublunary and terrestrial\nobjects. We are to render to our neighbour, whatever be his rank or\ndegree, that corresponding portion of affection with which we could\nrationally expect we should ourselves be regarded by those standing in\nthe same relation to us. Hence, neither husband nor wife, neither son\nnor daughter, neither friend nor relation, are lawfully to be made the\nobjects of our idolatry. The Lord our God is a jealous God, and will not\nendure that we bestow on the creature that extremity of devotion which\nHe who made us demands as his own share. I say to you, Lady, that even\nin the fairest, and purest, and most honourable feelings of our nature,\nthere is that original taint of sin which ought to make us pause and\nhesitate, ere we indulge them to excess.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI understand not this, reverend sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady; \u00e2\u0080\u009cnor do I guess\nwhat I can have now said or done, to draw down on me an admonition which\nhas something a taste of reproof.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Warden, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI crave your pardon, if I have urged aught beyond\nthe limits of my duty. But consider, whether in the sacred promise to be\nnot only a protectress, but a mother, to this poor child, your purpose\nmay meet the wishes of the noble knight your husband. The fondness which\nyou have lavished on the unfortunate, and, I own, most lovely child,\nhas met something like a reproof in the bearing of your household\ndog.--Displease not your noble husband. Men, as well as animals, are\njealous of the affections of those they love.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is too much, reverend sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady of Avenel, greatly\noffended. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have been long our guest, and have received from the\nKnight of Avenel and myself that honour and regard which your character\nand profession so justly demand. But I am yet to learn that we have at\nany time authorized your interference in our family arrangements, or\nplaced you as a judge of our conduct towards each other. I pray this may\nbe forborne in future.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the preacher, with the boldness peculiar to the clergy\nof his persuasion at that time, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen you weary of my admonitions--when\nI see that my services are no longer acceptable to you, and the noble\nknight your husband, I shall know that my Master wills me no longer to\nabide here; and, praying for a continuance of his best blessings on your\nfamily I will then, were the season the depth of winter, and the hour\nmidnight, walk out on yonder waste, and travel forth through these wild\nmountains, as lonely and unaided, though far more helpless, than when\nI first met your husband in the valley of Glendearg. But while I\nremain here, I will not see you err from the true path, no, not a\nhair's-breadth, without making the old man's voice and remonstrance\nheard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, but,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, who both loved and respected the good man,\nthough sometimes a little offended at what she conceived to be an\nexuberant degree of zeal, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe will not part this way, my good friend.\nWomen are quick and hasty in their feelings; but, believe me, my wishes\nand my purposes towards this child are such as both my husband and\nyou will approve of.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The clergyman bowed, and retreated to his own\napartment.\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Second.\n\n\n  How steadfastly he fix'd his eyes on me--\n  His dark eyes shining through forgotten tears--\n  Then stretch'd his little arms, and call'd me mother!\n  What could I do? I took the bantling home--\n  I could not tell the imp he had no mother.\n                         COUNT BASIL.\n\nWhen Warden had left the apartment, the Lady of Avenel gave way to the\nfeelings of tenderness which the sight of the boy, his sudden danger,\nand his recent escape, had inspired; and no longer awed by the\nsternness, as she deemed it, of the preacher, heaped with caresses the\nlovely and interesting child. He was now, in some measure, recovered\nfrom the consequences of his accident, and received passively, though\nnot without wonder, the tokens of kindness with which he was thus\nloaded. The face of the lady was strange to him, and her dress different\nand far more sumptuous than any he remembered. But the boy was naturally\nof an undaunted temper; and indeed children are generally acute\nphysiognomists, and not only pleased by that which is beautiful in\nitself, but peculiarly quick in distinguishing and replying to the\nattentions of those who really love them. If they see a person in\ncompany, though a perfect stranger, who is by nature fond of children,\nthe little imps seem to discover it by a sort of free-masonry, while the\nawkward attempts of those who make advances to them for the purpose of\nrecommending themselves to the parents, usually fail in attracting their\nreciprocal attention. The little boy, therefore, appeared in some degree\nsensible of the lady's caresses, and it was with difficulty she withdrew\nherself from his pillow, to afford him leisure for necessary repose.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo whom belongs our little rescued varlet?\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the first question\nwhich the Lady of Avenel put to her handmaiden Lilias, when they had\nretired to the hall.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo an old woman in the hamlet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lilias, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwho is even now come so\nfar as the porter's lodge to inquire concerning his safety. Is it your\npleasure that she be admitted?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it my pleasure?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady of Avenel, echoing the question with\na strong accent of displeasure and surprise; \u00e2\u0080\u009ccan you make any doubt\nof it? What woman but must pity the agony of the mother, whose heart is\nthrobbing for the safety of a child so lovely!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, but, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lilias, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis woman is too old to be the mother\nof the child; I rather think she must be his grandmother, or some more\ndistant relation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe she who she will, Lilias,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe must have an\naching heart while the safety of a creature so lovely is uncertain.\nGo instantly and bring her hither. Besides, I would willingly learn\nsomething concerning his birth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLilias left the hall, and presently afterwards returned, ushering in a\ntall female very poorly dressed, yet with more pretension to decency\nand cleanliness than was usually combined with such coarse garments. The\nLady of Avenel knew her figure the instant she presented herself. It was\nthe fashion of the family, that upon every Sabbath, and on two evenings\nin the week besides, Henry Warden preached or lectured in the chapel at\nthe castle. The extension of the Protestant faith was, upon principle,\nas well as in good policy, a primary object with the Knight of Avenel.\nThe inhabitants of the village were therefore invited to attend upon the\ninstructions of Henry Warden, and many of them were speedily won to\nthe doctrine which their master and protector approved. These sermons,\nhomilies, and lectures, had made a great impression on the mind of the\nAbbot Eustace, or Eustatius, and were a sufficient spur to the severity\nand sharpness of his controversy with his old fellow-collegiate;\nand, ere Queen Mary was dethroned, and while the Catholics still had\nconsiderable authority in the Border provinces, he more than once\nthreatened to levy his vassals, and assail and level with the earth\nthat stronghold of heresy the Castle of Avenel. But notwithstanding the\nAbbot's impotent resentment, and notwithstanding also the disinclination\nof the country to favour the new religion, Henry Warden proceeded\nwithout remission in his labours, and made weekly converts from the\nfaith of Rome to that of the reformed church. Amongst those who gave\nmost earnest and constant attendance on his ministry, was the aged\nwoman, whose form, tall, and otherwise too remarkable to be forgotten,\nthe Lady had of late observed frequently as being conspicuous among the\nlittle audience. She had indeed more than once desired to know who\nthat stately-looking woman was, whose appearance was so much above the\npoverty of her vestments. But the reply had always been, that she was an\nEnglishwoman, who was tarrying for a season at the hamlet, and that\nno one knew more concerning her. She now asked her after her name and\nbirth.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMagdalen Graeme is my name,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the woman; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI come of the Graemes of\nHeathergill, in Nicol Forest, [Footnote: A district of Cumberland, lying\nclose to the Scottish border.] a people of ancient blood.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what make you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued the Lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cso far distant from your\nhome?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no home,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Magdalen Graeme, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit was burnt by your\nBorder-riders--my husband and my son were slain--there is not a drop's\nblood left in the veins of any one which is of kin to mine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is no uncommon fate in these wild times, and in this unsettled\nland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe English hands have been as deeply dyed in our\nblood as ever those of Scotsmen have been in yours.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have right to say it, Lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Magdalen Graeme; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor men\ntell of a time when this castle was not strong enough to save your\nfather's life, or to afford your mother and her infant a place of\nrefuge. And why ask ye me, then, wherefore I dwell not in mine own home,\nand with mine own people?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was indeed an idle question,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhere misery so\noften makes wanderers; but wherefore take refuge in a hostile country?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy neighbours were Popish and mass-mongers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the old woman; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\nhas pleased Heaven to give me a clearer sight of the gospel, and I have\ntarried here to enjoy the ministry of that worthy man Henry Warden, who,\nto the praise and comfort of many, teacheth the Evangel in truth and in\nsincerity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you poor?\u00e2\u0080\u009d again demanded the Lady of Avenel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou hear me ask alms of no one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Englishwoman.\n\nHere there was a pause. The manner of the woman was, if not\ndisrespectful, at least much less than gracious; and she appeared to\ngive no encouragement to farther communication. The Lady of Avenel\nrenewed the conversation on a different topic.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have heard of the danger in which your boy has been placed?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have, Lady, and how by an especial providence he was rescued from\ndeath. May Heaven make him thankful, and me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat relation do you bear to him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am his grandmother, lady, if it so please you; the only relation he\nhath left upon earth to take charge of him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe burden of his maintenance must necessarily be grievous to you in\nyour deserted situation?\u00e2\u0080\u009d pursued the Lady.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have complained of it to no one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Magdalen Graeme, with the same\nunmoved, dry, and unconcerned tone of voice, in which she had answered\nall the former questions.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady of Avenel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour grandchild could be received into a\nnoble family, would it not advantage both him and you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cReceived into a noble family!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the old woman, drawing herself up,\nand bending her brows until her forehead was wrinkled into a frown of\nunusual severity; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand for what purpose, I pray you?--to be my lady's\npage, or my lord's jackman, to eat broken victuals, and contend with\nother menials for the remnants of the master's meal? Would you have\nhim to fan the flies from my lady's face while she sleeps, to carry\nher train while she walks, to hand her trencher when she feeds, to ride\nbefore her on horseback, to walk after her on foot, to sing when she\nlists, and to be silent when she bids?--a very weathercock, which,\nthough furnished in appearance with wings and plumage, cannot soar into\nthe air--cannot fly from the spot where it is perched, but receives all\nits impulse, and performs all its revolutions, obedient to the changeful\nbreath of a vain woman? When the eagle of Helvellyn perches on the tower\nof Lanercost, and turns and changes his place to show how the wind sits,\nRoland Graeme shall be what you would make him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe woman spoke with a rapidity and vehemence which seemed to have in it\na touch of insanity; and a sudden sense of the danger to which the child\nmust necessarily be exposed in the charge of such a keeper, increased\nthe Lady's desire to keep him in the castle if possible.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou mistake me, dame,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, addressing the old woman in a soothing\nmanner; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not wish your boy to be in attendance on myself, but upon\nthe good knight my husband. Were he himself the son of a belted earl,\nhe could not better be trained to arms, and all that befits a gentleman,\nthan by the instructions and discipline of Sir Halbert Glendinning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the old woman, in the same style of bitter irony, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know\nthe wages of that service;--a curse when the corslet is not sufficiently\nbrightened,--a blow when the girth is not tightly drawn,--to be beaten\nbecause the hounds are at fault,--to be reviled because the foray is\nunsuccessful,--to stain his hands for the master's bidding in the blood\nalike of beast and of man,--to be a butcher of harmless deer, a murderer\nand defacer of God's own image, not at his own pleasure, but at that of\nhis lord,--to live a brawling ruffian, and a common stabber--exposed to\nheat, to cold, to want of food, to all the privations of an anchoret,\nnot for the love of God, but for the service of Satan,--to die by the\ngibbet, or in some obscure skirmish,--to sleep out his brief life\nin carnal security, and to awake in the eternal fire, which is never\nquenched.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady of Avenel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut to such unhallowed course of life\nyour grandson will not be here exposed. My husband is just and kind to\nthose who live under his banner; and you yourself well know, that youth\nhave here a strict as well as a good preceptor in the person of our\nchaplain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old woman appeared to pause.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have named,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe only circumstance which can move me. I\nmust soon onward, the vision has said it--I must not tarry in the same\nspot--I must on,--I must on, it is my weird.--Swear, then, that you will\nprotect the boy as if he were your own, until I return hither and claim\nhim, and I will consent for a space to part with him. But especially\nswear, he shall not lack the instruction of the godly man who hath\nplaced the gospel-truth high above those idolatrous shavelings, the\nmonks and friars.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe satisfied, dame,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady of Avenel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe boy shall have as\nmuch care as if he were born of my own blood. Will you see him now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the old woman sternly; \u00e2\u0080\u009cto part is enough. I go forth\non my own mission. I will not soften my heart by useless tears and\nwailings, as one that is not called to a duty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you not accept of something to aid you in your pilgrimage?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nthe Lady of Avenel, putting into her hands two crowns of the sun. The\nold woman flung them down on the table.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAm I of the race of Cain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cproud Lady, that you offer me\ngold in exchange for my own flesh and blood?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI had no such meaning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, gently; \u00e2\u0080\u009cnor am I the proud\nwoman you term me. Alas! my own fortunes might have taught me humility,\neven had it not been born with me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old woman seemed somewhat to relax her tone of severity.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are of gentle blood,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009celse we had not parleyed thus long\ntogether.--You are of gentle blood, and to such,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added, drawing up\nher tall form as she spoke, \u00e2\u0080\u009cpride is as graceful as is the plume upon\nthe bonnet. But for these pieces of gold, lady, you must needs resume\nthem. I need not money. I am well provided; and I may not care for\nmyself, nor think how, or by whom, I shall be sustained. Farewell, and\nkeep your word. Cause your gates to be opened, and your bridges to be\nlowered. I will set forward this very night. When I come again, I will\ndemand from you a strict account, for I have left with you the jewel of\nmy life! Sleep will visit me but in snatches, food will not refresh me,\nrest will not restore my strength, until I see Roland Graeme. Once more,\nfarewell.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMake your obeisance, dame,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lilias to Magdalen Graeme, as she\nretired, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmake your obeisance to her ladyship, and thank her for her\ngoodness, as is but fitting and right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old woman turned short around on the officious waiting-maid. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\nher make her obeisance to me then, and I will return it. Why should\nI bend to her?--is it because her kirtle is of silk, and mine of blue\nlockeram?--Go to, my lady's waiting-woman. Know that the rank of the man\nrates that of the wife, and that she who marries a churl's son, were she\na king's daughter, is but a peasant's bride.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLilias was about to reply in great indignation, but her mistress imposed\nsilence on her, and commanded that the old woman should be safely\nconducted to the mainland.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cConduct her safe!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the incensed waiting-woman, while Magdalen\nGraeme left the apartment; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI say, duck her in the loch, and then we\nwill see whether she is witch or not, as every body in the village of\nLochside will say and swear. I marvel your ladyship could bear so long\nwith her insolence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But the commands of the Lady were obeyed, and the\nold dame, dismissed from the castle, was committed to her fortune. She\nkept her word, and did not long abide in that place, leaving the hamlet\non the very night succeeding the interview, and wandering no one asked\nwhither. The Lady of Avenel inquired under what circumstances she had\nappeared among them, but could only learn that she was believed to\nbe the widow of some man of consequence among the Graemes who then\ninhabited the Debateable Land, a name given to a certain portion of\nterritory which was the frequent subject of dispute betwixt Scotland\nand England--that she had suffered great wrong in some of the frequent\nforays by which that unfortunate district was wasted, and had been\ndriven from her dwelling-place. She had arrived in the hamlet no one\nknew for what purpose, and was held by some to be a witch, by others a\nzealous Protestant, and by others again a Catholic devotee. Her language\nwas mysterious, and her manners repulsive; and all that could be\ncollected from her conversation seemed to imply that she was under the\ninfluence either of a spell or of a vow,--there was no saying which,\nsince she talked as one who acted under a powerful and external agency.\n\nSuch were the particulars which the Lady's inquiries were able\nto collect concerning Magdalen Graeme, being far too meagre and\ncontradictory to authorize any satisfactory deduction. In truth, the\nmiseries of the time, and the various turns of fate incidental to a\nfrontier country, were perpetually chasing from their habitations those\nwho had not the means of defence or protection. These wanderers in the\nland were too often seen, to excite much attention or sympathy. They\nreceived the cold relief which was extorted by general feelings of\nhumanity; a little excited in some breasts, and perhaps rather chilled\nin others, by the recollection that they who gave the charity to-day\nmight themselves want it to-morrow. Magdalen Graeme, therefore, came and\ndeparted like a shadow from the neighbourhood of Avenel Castle.\n\nThe boy whom Providence, as she thought, had thus strangely placed\nunder her care, was at once established a favourite with the Lady of\nthe castle. How could it be otherwise? He became the object of those\naffectionate feelings, which, finding formerly no object on which to\nexpand themselves, had increased the gloom of the castle, and imbittered\nthe solitude of its mistress. To teach him reading and writing as far as\nher skill went, to attend to his childish comforts, to watch his boyish\nsports, became the Lady's favourite amusement. In her circumstances,\nwhere the ear only heard the lowing of the cattle from the distant\nhills, or the heavy step of the warder as he walked upon his post,\nor the half-envied laugh of her maiden as she turned her wheel, the\nappearance of the blooming and beautiful boy gave an interest which\ncan hardly be conceived by those who live amid gayer and busier scenes.\nYoung Roland was to the Lady of Avenel what the flower, which occupies\nthe window of some solitary captive, is to the poor wight by whom it is\nnursed and cultivated,--something which at once excited and repaid\nher care; and in giving the boy her affection, she felt, as it were,\ngrateful to him for releasing her from the state of dull apathy in\nwhich she had usually found herself during the absence of Sir Halbert\nGlendinning.\n\nBut even the charms of this blooming favourite were unable to chase the\nrecurring apprehensions which arose from her husband's procrastinated\nreturn. Soon after Roland Graeme became a resident at the castle, a\ngroom, despatched by Sir Halbert, brought tidings that business still\ndelayed the Knight at the Court of Holyrood. The more distant period\nwhich the messenger had assigned for his master's arrival at length\nglided away, summer melted into autumn, and autumn was about to give\nplace to winter, and yet he came not.\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Third.\n\n\n The waning harvest-moon shone broad and bright,\n The warder's horn was heard at dead of night,\n And while the portals-wide were flung,\n With trampling hoofs the rocky pavement rung.\n                                         LEYDEN.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you, too, would be a soldier, Roland?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady of Avenel\nto her young charge, while, seated on a stone chair at one end of the\nbattlements, she saw the boy attempt, with a long stick, to mimic the\nmotions of the warder, as he alternately shouldered, or ported, or\nsloped pike.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, Lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the boy,--for he was now familiar, and replied to her\nquestions with readiness and alacrity,-\u00e2\u0080\u009ca soldier will I be; for there\nne'er was gentleman but who belted him with the brand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThou a gentleman!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lilias, who, as usual, was in attendance; \u00e2\u0080\u009csuch\na gentleman as I would make of a bean-cod with a rusty knife.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, chide him not, Lilias,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady of Avenel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor, beshrew me,\nbut I think he comes of gentle blood--see how it musters in his face at\nyour injurious reproof.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHad I my will, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lilias, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca good birchen wand should\nmake his colour muster to better purpose still.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOn my word, Lilias,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cone would think you had received\nharm from the poor boy--or is he so far on the frosty side of your\nfavour because he enjoys the sunny side of mine?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOver heavens forbode, my Lady!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lilias; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have lived too long\nwith gentles, I praise my stars for it, to fight with either follies or\nfantasies, whether they relate to beast, bird, or boy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLilias was a favourite in her own class, a spoiled domestic, and often\naccustomed to take more licence than her mistress was at all times\nwilling to encourage. But what did not please the Lady of Avenel, she\ndid not choose to hear, and thus it was on the present occasion. She\nresolved to look more close and sharply after the boy, who had hitherto\nbeen committed chiefly to the management of Lilias. He must, she\nthought, be born of gentle blood; it were shame to think otherwise of\na form so noble, and features so fair;--the very wildness in which\nhe occasionally indulged, his contempt of danger, and impatience of\nrestraint, had in them something noble;--assuredly the child was born of\nhigh rank. Such was her conclusion, and she acted upon it accordingly.\nThe domestics around her, less jealous, or less scrupulous than Lilias,\nacted as servants usually do, following the bias, and flattering, for\ntheir own purposes, the humour of the Lady; and the boy soon took on him\nthose airs of superiority, which the sight of habitual deference seldom\nfails to inspire. It seemed, in truth, as if to command were his natural\nsphere, so easily did he use himself to exact and receive compliance\nwith his humours. The chaplain, indeed, might have interposed to check\nthe air of assumption which Roland Graeme so readily indulged, and\nmost probably would have willingly rendered him that favour; but the\nnecessity of adjusting with his brethren some disputed points of church\ndiscipline had withdrawn him for some time from the castle, and detained\nhim in a distant part of the kingdom.\n\nMatters stood thus in the castle of Avenel, when a winded bugle sent its\nshrill and prolonged notes from the shore of the lake, and was replied\nto cheerily by the signal of the warder. The Lady of Avenel knew the\nsounds of her husband, and rushed to the window of the apartment in\nwhich she was sitting. A band of about thirty spearmen, with a pennon\ndisplayed before them, winded along the indented shores of the lake,\nand approached the causeway. A single horseman rode at the head of the\nparty, his bright arms catching a glance of the October sun as he moved\nsteadily along. Even at that distance, the Lady recognized the lofty\nplume, bearing the mingled colours of her own liveries and those of\nGlendonwyne, blended with the holly-branch; and the firm seat and\ndignified demeanour of the rider, joined to the stately motion of the\ndark-brown steed, sufficiently announced Halbert Glendinning.\n\nThe Lady's first thought was that of rapturous joy at her husband's\nreturn--her second was connected with a fear which had sometimes\nintruded itself, that he might not altogether approve the peculiar\ndistinction with which she had treated her orphan ward. In this fear\nthere was implied a consciousness, that the favour she had shown him was\nexcessive; for Halbert Glendinning was at least as gentle and indulgent,\nas he was firm and rational in the intercourse of his household; and to\nher in particular, his conduct had ever been most affectionately tender.\n\nYet she did fear, that, on the present occasion, her conduct might incur\nSir Halbert's censure; and hastily resolving that she would not mention,\nthe anecdote of the boy until the next day, she ordered him to be\nwithdrawn from the apartment by Lilias.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not go with Lilias, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the spoiled child, who\nhad more than once carried his point by perseverance, and who, like his\nbetters, delighted in the exercise of such authority,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not go to\nLilias's gousty room--I will stay and see that brave warrior who comes\nriding so gallantly along the drawbridge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must not stay, Roland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, more positively than she\nusually spoke to her little favourite.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will,\u00e2\u0080\u009d reiterated the boy, who had already felt his consequence, and\nthe probable chance of success.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou _will_, Roland!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat manner of word is that? I\ntell you, you must go.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_Will_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the forward boy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis a word for a man, and _must_ is\nno word for a lady.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are saucy, sirrah,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady--\u00e2\u0080\u009cLilias, take him with you\ninstantly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI always thought,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lilias, smiling, as she seized the reluctant\nboy by the arm, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat my young master must give place to my old one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you, too, are malapert, mistress!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady; \u00e2\u0080\u009chath the moon\nchanged, that ye all of you thus forget yourselves?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLilias made no reply, but led off the boy, who, too proud to offer\nunavailing resistance, darted at his benefactress a glance, which\nintimated plainly, how willingly he would have defied her authority, had\nhe possessed the power to make good his point.\n\nThe Lady of Avenel was vexed to find how much this trifling circumstance\nhad discomposed her, at the moment when she ought naturally to have\nbeen entirely engrossed by her husband's return. But we do not recover\ncomposure by the mere feeling that agitation is mistimed. The glow of\ndispleasure had not left the Lady's cheek, her ruffled deportment was\nnot yet entirely composed, when her husband, unhelmeted, but still\nwearing the rest of his arms, entered the apartment. His appearance\nbanished the thoughts of every thing else; she rushed to him, clasped\nhis iron-sheathed frame in her arms, and kissed his martial and manly\nface with an affection which was at once evident and sincere. The\nwarrior returned her embrace and her caress with the same fondness; for\nthe time which had passed since their union had diminished its romantic\nardour, perhaps, but it had rather increased its rational tenderness,\nand Sir Halbert Glendinning's long and frequent absences from his castle\nhad prevented affection from degenerating by habit into indifference.\n\nWhen the first eager greetings were paid and received, the Lady\ngazed fondly on her husband's face as she remarked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are altered,\nHalbert--you have ridden hard and far to-day, or you have been ill?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have been well, Mary,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Knight, \u00e2\u0080\u009cpassing well have\nI been; and a long ride is to me, thou well knowest, but a thing of\nconstant custom. Those who are born noble may slumber out their lives\nwithin the walls of their castles and manor-houses; but he who hath\nachieved nobility by his own deeds must ever be in the saddle, to show\nthat he merits his advancement.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhile he spoke thus, the Lady gazed fondly on him, as if endeavouring\nto read his inmost soul; for the tone in which he spoke was that of\nmelancholy depression.\n\nSir Halbert Glendinning was the same, yet a different person from what\nhe had appeared in his early years. The fiery freedom of the aspiring\nyouth had given place to the steady and stern composure of the approved\nsoldier and skilful politician. There were deep traces of care on those\nnoble features, over which each emotion used formerly to pass, like\nlight clouds across a summer sky. That sky was now, not perhaps clouded,\nbut still and grave, like that of the sober autumn evening. The forehead\nwas higher and more bare than in early youth, and the locks which still\nclustered thick and dark on the warrior's head, were worn away at the\ntemples, not by age, but by the constant pressure of the steel cap, or\nhelmet. His beard, according to the fashion of the time, grew short and\nthick, and was turned into mustaches on the upper lip, and peaked at the\nextremity. The cheek, weather-beaten and embrowned, had lost the glow\nof youth, but showed the vigorous complexion of active and confirmed\nmanhood. Halbert Glendinning was, in a word, a knight to ride at a\nking's right hand, to bear his banner in war, and to be his counsellor\nin time of peace; for his looks expressed the considerate firmness which\ncan resolve wisely and dare boldly. Still, over these noble features,\nthere now spread an air of dejection, of which, perhaps, the owner was\nnot conscious, but which did not escape the observation of his anxious\nand affectionate partner.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSomething has happened, or is about to happen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady of\nAvenel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis sadness sits not on your brow without cause--misfortune,\nnational or particular, must needs be at hand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is nothing new that I wot of,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Halbert Glendinning; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut\nthere is little of evil which can befall a kingdom, that may not be\napprehended in this unhappy and divided realm.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI see there hath really been some fatal\nwork on foot. My Lord of Murray has not so long detained you at\nHolyrood, save that he wanted your help in some weighty purpose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have not been at Holyrood, Mary,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Knight; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have been\nseveral weeks abroad.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAbroad! and sent me no word?\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Lady.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat would the knowledge have availed, but to have rendered you\nunhappy, my love?\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Knight; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour thoughts would have\nconverted the slightest breeze that curled your own lake, into a tempest\nraging in the German ocean.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd have you then really crossed the sea?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, to whom the\nvery idea of an element which she had never seen conveyed notions of\nterror and of wonder,--\u00e2\u0080\u009creally left your own native land, and trodden\ndistant shores, where the Scottish tongue is unheard and unknown?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cReally, and really,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Knight, taking her hand in affectionate\nplayfulness, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have done this marvellous deed--have rolled on the ocean\nfor three days and three nights, with the deep green waves dashing by\nthe side of my pillow, and but a thin plank to divide me from it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed, my Halbert,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat was a tempting of Divine\nProvidence. I never bade you unbuckle the sword from your side, or lay\nthe lance from your hand--I never bade you sit still when your honour\ncalled you to rise and ride; but are not blade and spear dangers enough\nfor one man's life, and why would you trust rough waves and raging\nseas?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have in Germany, and in the Low Countries, as they are called,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n answered Glendinning, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmen who are united with us in faith, and with\nwhom it is fitting we should unite in alliance. To some of these I was\ndespatched on business as important as it was secret. I went in safety,\nand I returned in security; there is more danger to a man's life betwixt\nthis and Holyrood, than are in all the seas that wash the lowlands of\nHolland.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the country, my Halbert, and the people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009care they\nlike our kindly Scots? or what bearing have they to strangers?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are a people, Mary, strong in their wealth, which renders all\nother nations weak, and weak in those arts of war by which other nations\nare strong.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not understand you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Hollander and the Fleming, Mary, pour forth their spirit in\ntrade, and not in war; their wealth purchases them the arms of foreign\nsoldiers, by whose aid they defend it. They erect dikes on the sea-shore\nto protect the land which they have won, and they levy regiments of the\nstubborn Switzers and hardy Germans to protect the treasures which they\nhave amassed. And thus they are strong in their weakness; for the very\nwealth which tempts their masters to despoil them, arms strangers in\ntheir behalf.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe slothful hinds!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Mary, thinking and feeling like a\nScotswoman of the period; \u00e2\u0080\u009chave they hands, and fight not for the land\nwhich bore them? They should be notched off at the elbow!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, that were but hard justice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered her husband; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor their\nhands serve their country, though not in battle, like ours. Look at\nthese barren hills, Mary, and at that deep winding vale by which the\ncattle are even now returning from their scanty browse. The hand of the\nindustrious Fleming would cover these mountains with wood, and raise\ncorn where we now see a starved and scanty sward of heath and ling. It\ngrieves me, Mary, when I look on that land, and think what benefit it\nmight receive from such men as I have lately seen--men who seek not\nthe idle fame derived from dead ancestors, or the bloody renown won in\nmodern broils, but tread along the land, as preservers and improvers,\nnot as tyrants and destroyers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese amendments would here be but a vain fancy, my Halbert,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered\nthe Lady of Avenel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe trees would be burned by the English foemen,\nere they ceased to be shrubs, and the grain that you raised would be\ngathered in by the first neighbour that possessed more riders than\nfollow your train. Why should you repine at this? The fate that made\nyou Scotsman by birth, gave you head, and heart, and hand, to uphold the\nname as it must needs be upheld.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt gave _me_ no name to uphold,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Halbert, pacing the floor slowly;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cmy arm has been foremost in every strife--my voice has been heard in\nevery council, nor have the wisest rebuked me. The crafty Lethington,\nthe deep and dark Morton, have held secret council with me, and Grange\nand Lindsay have owned, that in the field I did the devoir of a gallant\nknight--but let the emergence be passed when they need my head and hand,\nand they only know me as son of the obscure portioner of Glendearg.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis was a theme which the Lady always dreaded; for the rank conferred\non her husband, the favour in which he was held by the powerful Earl of\nMurray, and the high talents by which he vindicated his right to\nthat rank and that favour, were qualities which rather increased than\ndiminished the envy which was harboured against Sir Halbert Glendinning\namong a proud aristocracy, as a person originally of inferior and\nobscure birth, who had risen to his present eminence solely by his\npersonal merit. The natural firmness of his mind did not enable him to\ndespise the ideal advantages of a higher pedigree, which were held in\nsuch universal esteem by all with whom he conversed; and so open are\nthe noblest minds to jealous inconsistencies, that there were moments in\nwhich he felt mortified that his lady should possess those advantages\nof birth and high descent which he himself did not enjoy, and regretted\nthat his importance as the proprietor of Avenel was qualified by his\npossessing it only as the husband of the heiress. He was not so unjust\nas to permit any unworthy feelings to retain permanent possession of his\nmind, but yet they recurred from time to time, and did not escape his\nlady's anxious observation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHad we been blessed with children,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she was wont on such occasions\nto say to herself, \u00e2\u0080\u009chad our blood been united in a son who might have\njoined my advantages of descent with my husband's personal worth, these\npainful and irksome reflections had not disturbed our union even for a\nmoment. But the existence of such an heir, in whom our affections, as\nwell as our pretensions, might have centred, has been denied to us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith such mutual feelings, it cannot be wondered that it gave the\nLady pain to hear her husband verging towards this topic of mutual\ndiscontent. On the present, as on other similar occasions, she\nendeavoured to divert the knight's thoughts from this painful channel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow can you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009csuffer yourself to dwell upon things which\nprofit nothing? Have you indeed no name to uphold? You, the good and the\nbrave, the wise in council, and the strong in battle, have you not\nto support the reputation your own deeds have won, a reputation more\nhonourable than mere ancestry can supply? Good men love and honour you,\nthe wicked fear, and the turbulent obey you; and is it not necessary you\nshould exert yourself to ensure the endurance of that love, that honour,\nand wholesome fear, and that necessary obedience?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs she thus spoke, the eye of her husband caught from hers courage and\ncomfort, and it lightened as he took her hand and replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is\nmost true, my Mary, and I deserve thy rebuke, who forget what I am, in\nrepining because I am not what I cannot be. I am now what the most famed\nancestors of those I envy were, the mean man raised into eminence by\nhis own exertions; and sure it is a boast as honourable to have those\ncapacities which are necessary to the foundation of a family, as to be\ndescended from one who possessed them some centuries before. The Hay of\nLoncarty, who bequeathed his bloody yoke to his lineage,--the 'dark gray\nman,' who first founded the house of Douglas, had yet less of ancestry\nto boast than I have. For thou knowest, Mary, that my name derives\nitself from a line of ancient warriors, although my immediate\nforefathers preferred the humble station in which thou didst first\nfind them; and war and counsel are not less proper to the house of\nGlendonwyne, even, in its most remote descendants, than to the proudest\nof their baronage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d [Footnote: This was a house of ancient descent and\nsuperior consequence, including persons who fought at Bannockburn and\nOtterburn, and closely connected by alliance and friendship with the\ngreat Earls of Douglas. The Knight in this story argues as most Scotsmen\nwould do in his situation, for all of the same clan are popularly\nconsidered as descended from the same stock, and as having a right to\nthe ancestral honor of the chief branch. This opinion, though sometimes\nideal, is so strong even at this day of innovation, that it may be\nobserved as a national difference between my countrymen and the English.\nIf you ask an Englishman of good birth, whether a person of the same\nname be connected with him, he answers (if _in dubio._) \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo--he is a\nmere namesake.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ask a similar question of a Scot, (I mean a Scotsman,)\nhe replies--\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is one of our clan; I daresay there is a relationship,\nthough I do not know how distant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Englishman thinks of\ndiscountenancing a species of rivalry in society; the Scotsman's answer\nis grounded on the ancient idea of strengthening the clan.]\n\nHe strode across the hall as he spoke; and the Lady smiled internally\nto observe how much his mind dwelt upon the prerogatives of birth, and\nendeavoured to establish his claims, however remote, to a share in them,\nat the very moment when he affected to hold them in contempt. It will\neasily be guessed, however, that she permitted no symptom to escape\nher that could show she was sensible of the weakness of her husband, a\nperspicacity which perhaps his proud spirit could not very easily have\nbrooked.\n\nAs he returned from the extremity of the hall, to which he had stalked\nwhile in the act of vindicating the title of the house of Glendonwyne in\nits most remote branches to the full privileges of aristocracy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis Wolf? I have not seen him since my return, and he was\nusually the first to welcome my home-coming.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWolf,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, with a slight degree of embarrassment, for which\nperhaps, she would have found it difficult to assign any reason even to\nherself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWolf is chained up for the present. He hath been surly to my\npage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWolf chained up--and Wolf surly to your page!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Sir Halbert\nGlendinning; \u00e2\u0080\u009cWolf never was surly to any one; and the chain will either\nbreak his spirit or render him savage--So ho, there--set Wolf free\ndirectly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe was obeyed; and the huge dog rushed into the hall, disturbing, by his\nunwieldy and boisterous gambols, the whole economy of reels, rocks, and\ndistaffs, with which the maidens of the household were employed when the\narrival of their lord was a signal to them to withdraw, and extracting\nfrom Lilias, who was summoned to put them again in order, the natural\nobservation, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat the Laird's pet was as troublesome as the lady's\npage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd who is this page, Mary?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Knight, his attention again\ncalled to the subject by the observation of the waiting-woman,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho\nis this page, whom every one seems to weigh in the balance with my\nold friend and favourite, Wolf?--When did you aspire to the dignity of\nkeeping a page, or who is the boy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI trust, my Halbert,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, not without a blush, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou will\nnot think your wife entitled to less attendance than other ladies of her\nquality?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, Dame Mary,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Knight, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is enough you desire such\nan attendant.--Yet I have never loved to nurse such useless menials--a\nlady's page--it may well suit the proud English dames to have a slender\nyouth to bear their trains from bower to hall, fan them when they\nslumber, and touch the lute for them when they please to listen; but our\nScottish matrons were wont to be above such vanities, and our Scottish\nyouth ought to be bred to the spear and the stirrup.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, but, my husband,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI did but jest when I called\nthis boy my page; he is in sooth a little orphan whom we saved from\nperishing in the lake, and whom I have since kept in the castle out of\ncharity.--Lilias, bring little Roland hither.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland entered accordingly, and, flying to the Lady's side, took hold\nof the plaits of her gown, and then turned round, and gazed with\nan attention not unmingled with fear, upon the stately form of the\nKnight.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cRoland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cgo kiss the hand of the noble Knight,\nand ask him to be thy protector.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--But Roland obeyed not, and, keeping\nhis station, continued to gaze fixedly and timidly on Sir Halbert\nGlendinning.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo to the Knight, boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat dost thou\nfear, child? Go, kiss Sir Halbert's hand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will kiss no hand save yours, Lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the boy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, but do as you are commanded, child,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Lady.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is\ndashed by your presence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, apologizing to her husband; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut is\nhe not a handsome boy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd so is Wolf,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Halbert, as he patted his huge four-footed\nfavourite, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca handsome dog; but he has this double advantage over your\nnew favourite, that he does what he is commanded, and hears not when he\nis praised.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, now you are displeased with me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Lady; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand yet why\nshould you be so? There is nothing wrong in relieving the distressed\norphan, or in loving that which is in itself lovely and deserving of\naffection. But you have seen Mr. Warden at Edinburgh, and he has set you\nagainst the poor boy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear Mary,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered her husband, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Warden better knows his place\nthan to presume to interfere either in your affairs or mine. I neither\nblame your relieving this boy, nor your kindness for him. But, I think,\nconsidering his birth and prospects, you ought not to treat him with\ninjudicious fondness, which can only end in rendering him unfit for the\nhumble situation to which Heaven has designed him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, but, my Halbert, do but look at the boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand see\nwhether he has not the air of being intended by Heaven for something\nnobler than a mere peasant. May he not be designed, as others have been,\nto rise out of a humble situation into honour and eminence?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThus far had she proceeded, when the consciousness that she was treading\nupon delicate ground at once occurred to her, and induced her to take\nthe most natural, but the worst of all courses in such occasions,\nwhether in conversation or in an actual bog, namely, that of stopping\nsuddenly short in the illustration which she had commenced. Her brow\ncrimsoned, and that of Sir Halbert Glendinning was slightly overcast.\nBut it was only for an instant; for he was incapable of mistaking his\nlady's meaning, or supposing that she meant intentional disrespect to\nhim.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe it as you please, my love,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI owe you too much to\ncontradict you in aught which may render your solitary mode of life\nmore endurable. Make of this youth what you will, and you have my\nfull authority for doing so. But remember he is your charge, not\nmine--remember he hath limbs to do man's service, a soul and a tongue\nto worship God; breed him, therefore, to be true to his country and to\nHeaven; and for the rest, dispose of him as you list--it is, and shall\nrest, your own matter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis conversation decided the fate of Roland Graeme, who from\nthence-forward was little noticed by the master of the mansion of\nAvenel, but indulged and favoured by its mistress.\n\nThis situation led to many important consequences, and, in truth, tended\nto bring forth the character of the youth in all its broad lights and\ndeep shadows. As the Knight himself seemed tacitly to disclaim alike\ninterest and control over the immediate favourite of his lady, young\nRoland was, by circumstances, exempted from the strict discipline to\nwhich, as the retainer of a Scottish man of rank, he would otherwise\nhave been subjected, according to all the rigour of the age. But the\nsteward, or master of the household--such was the proud title assumed\nby the head domestic of each petty baron--deemed it not advisable to\ninterfere with the favourite of the Lady, and especially since she had\nbrought the estate into the present family. Master Jasper Wingate was a\nman experienced, as he often boasted, in the ways of great families, and\nknew how to keep the steerage even when the wind and tide chanced to be\nin contradiction.\n\nThis prudent personage winked at much, and avoided giving opportunity\nfor farther offence, by requesting little of Roland Graeme beyond\nthe degree of attention which he was himself disposed to pay; rightly\nconjecturing, that however lowly the place which the youth might hold in\nthe favour of the Knight of Avenel, still to make an evil report of\nhim would make an enemy of the Lady, without securing the favour of her\nhusband. With these prudential considerations, and doubtless not without\nan eye to his own ease and convenience, he taught the boy as much, and\nonly as much, as he chose to learn, readily admitting whatever apology\nit pleased his pupil to allege in excuse for idleness or negligence.\nAs the other persons in the castle, to whom such tasks were delegated,\nreadily imitated the prudential conduct of the major-domo, there was\nlittle control used towards Roland Graeme, who, of course, learned no\nmore than what a very active mind, and a total impatience of absolute\nidleness led him to acquire upon his own account, and by dint of his\nown exertions. The latter were especially earnest, when the Lady herself\ncondescended to be his tutress, or to examine his progress.\n\nIt followed also from his quality as my Lady's favourite, that Roland\nwas viewed with no peculiar good-will by the followers of the Knight,\nmany of whom, of the same age, and apparently similar origin, with the\nfortunate page, were subjected to severe observance of the ancient and\nrigorous discipline of a feudal retainer. To these, Roland Graeme was\nof course an object of envy, and, in consequence, of dislike and\ndetraction; but the youth possessed qualities which it was impossible\nto depreciate. Pride, and a sense of early ambition, did for him what\nseverity and constant instruction did for others. In truth, the youthful\nRoland displayed that early flexibility both of body and mind, which\nrenders exercise, either mental or bodily, rather matter of sport than\nof study; and it seemed as if he acquired accidentally, and by starts,\nthose accomplishments, which earnest and constant instruction, enforced\nby frequent reproof and occasional chastisement, had taught to others.\nSuch military exercises, such lessons of the period, as he found it\nagreeable or convenient to apply to, he learned so perfectly, as\nto confound those who were ignorant how often the want of constant\napplication is compensated by vivacity of talent and ardent enthusiasm.\nThe lads, therefore, who were more regularly trained to arms, to\nhorsemanship, and to other necessary exercises of the period, while they\nenvied Roland Graeme the indulgence or negligence with which he\nseemed to be treated, had little reason to boast of their own superior\nacquirements; a few hours, with the powerful exertion of a most\nenergetic will, seemed to do for him more than the regular instruction\nof weeks could accomplish for others.\n\nUnder these advantages, if, indeed, they were to be termed such,\nthe character of young Roland began to develope itself. It was bold,\nperemptory, decisive, and overbearing; generous, if neither withstood\nnor contradicted; vehement and passionate, if censured or opposed. He\nseemed to consider himself as attached to no one, and responsible to\nno one, except his mistress, and even over her mind he had gradually\nacquired that species of ascendancy which indulgence is so apt to\noccasion. And although the immediate followers and dependents of Sir\nHalbert Glendinning saw his ascendancy with jealousy, and often took\noccasion to mortify his vanity, there wanted not those who were willing\nto acquire the favour of the Lady of Avenel by humouring and taking part\nwith the youth whom she protected; for although a favourite, as the poet\nassures us, has no friend, he seldom fails to have both followers and\nflatterers.\n\nThe partisans of Roland Graeme were chiefly to be found amongst the\ninhabitants of the little hamlet on the shore of the lake. These\nvillagers, who were sometimes tempted to compare their own situation\nwith that of the immediate and constant followers of the Knight, who\nattended him on his frequent journeys to Edinburgh and elsewhere,\ndelighted in considering and representing themselves as more properly\nthe subjects of the Lady of Avenel than of her husband. It is true, her\nwisdom and affection on all occasions discountenanced the distinction\nwhich was here implied; but the villagers persisted in thinking it must\nbe agreeable to her to enjoy their peculiar and undivided homage, or at\nleast in acting as if they thought so; and one chief mode by which they\nevinced their sentiments, was by the respect they paid to young Roland\nGraeme, the favourite attendant of the descendant of their ancient\nlords. This was a mode of flattery too pleasing to encounter rebuke or\ncensure; and the opportunity which it afforded the youth to form, as\nit were, a party of his own within the limits of the ancient barony\nof Avenel, added not a little to the audacity and decisive tone of a\ncharacter, which was by nature bold, impetuous, and incontrollable.\n\nOf the two members of the household who had manifested an early jealousy\nof Roland Graeme, the prejudices of Wolf were easily overcome; and in\nprocess of time the noble dog slept with Bran, Luath, and the celebrated\nhounds of ancient days. But Mr. Warden, the chaplain, lived, and\nretained his dislike to the youth. That good man, single-minded and\nbenevolent as he really was, entertained rather more than a reasonable\nidea of the respect due to him as a minister, and exacted from the\ninhabitants of the castle more deference than the haughty young page,\nproud of his mistress's favour, and petulant from youth and situation,\nwas at all times willing to pay. His bold and free demeanour, his\nattachment to rich dress and decoration, his inaptitude to receive\ninstruction, and his hardening himself against rebuke, were\ncircumstances which induced the good old man, with more haste than\ncharity, to set the forward page down as a vessel of wrath, and to\npresage that the youth nursed that pride and haughtiness of spirit which\ngoes before ruin and destruction. On the other hand, Roland evinced\nat times a marked dislike, and even something like contempt, of\nthe chaplain. Most of the attendants and followers of Sir Halbert\nGlendinning entertained the same charitable thoughts as the reverend\nMr. Warden; but while Roland was favoured by their lady, and endured by\ntheir lord, they saw no policy in making their opinions public.\n\nRoland Graeme was sufficiently sensible of the unpleasant situation in\nwhich he stood; but in the haughtiness of his heart he retorted upon the\nother domestics the distant, cold, and sarcastic manner in which they\ntreated him, assumed an air of superiority which compelled the most\nobstinate to obedience, and had the satisfaction at least to be dreaded,\nif he was heartily hated.\n\nThe chaplain's marked dislike had the effect of recommending him to\nthe attention of Sir Halbert's brother, Edward, who now, under the\nconventual appellation of Father Ambrose, continued to be one of the\nfew monks who, with the Abbot Eustatius, had, notwithstanding the nearly\ntotal downfall of their faith under the regency of Murray, been still\npermitted to linger in the cloisters at Kennaquhair. Respect to Sir\nHalbert had prevented their being altogether driven out of the Abbey,\nthough their order was now in a great measure suppressed, and they were\ninterdicted the public exercise of their ritual, and only allowed for\ntheir support a small pension out of their once splendid revenues.\nFather Ambrose, thus situated, was an occasional, though very rare\nvisitant, at the Castle of Avenel, and was at such times observed to pay\nparticular attention to Roland Graeme, who seemed to return it with more\ndepth of feeling than consisted with his usual habits.\n\nThus situated, years glided on, during which the Knight of Avenel\ncontinued to act a frequent and important part in the convulsions of his\ndistracted country; while young Graeme anticipated, both in wishes and\npersonal accomplishments, the age which should enable him to emerge from\nthe obscurity of his present situation.\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Fourth.\n\n\n  Amid their cups that freely flow'd,\n    Their revelry and mirth,\n  A youthful lord tax'd Valentine\n    With base and doubtful birth.\n                 VALENTINE AND ORSON.\n\nWhen Roland Graeme was a youth about seventeen years of age, he\nchanced one summer morning to descend to the mew in which Sir Halbert\nGlendinning kept his hawks, in order to superintend the training of an\neyas, or young hawk, which he himself, at the imminent risk of neck and\nlimbs, had taken from the celebrated eyry in the neighborhood, called\nGledscraig. As he was by no means satisfied with the attention which had\nbeen bestowed on his favourite bird, he was not slack in testifying his\ndispleasure to the falconer's lad, whose duty it was to have attended\nupon it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat, ho! sir knave,\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis it thus you feed the\neyas with unwashed meat, as if you were gorging the foul brancher of a\nworthless hoodie-crow? by the mass, and thou hast neglected its castings\nalso for these two days! Think'st thou I ventured my neck to bring the\nbird down from the crag, that thou shouldst spoil him by thy neglect?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n And to add force to his remonstrances, he conferred a cuff or two on the\nnegligent attendant of the hawks, who, shouting rather louder than was\nnecessary under all the circumstances, brought the master falconer to\nhis assistance.\n\nAdam Woodcock, the falconer of Avenel, was an Englishman by birth, but\nso long in the service of Glendinning, that he had lost much of his\nnotional attachment in that which he had formed to his master. He was\na favourite in his department, jealous and conceited of his skill, as\nmasters of the game usually are; for the rest of his character he was\na jester and a parcel poet, (qualities which by no means abated his\nnatural conceit,) a jolly fellow, who, though a sound Protestant, loved\na flagon of ale better than a long sermon, a stout man of his hands\nwhen need required, true to his master, and a little presuming on his\ninterest with him.\n\nAdam Woodcock, such as we have described him, by no means relished the\nfreedom used by young Graeme, in chastising his assistant. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, hey,\nmy Lady's page,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, stepping between his own boy and Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfair\nand softly, an it like your gilt jacket--hands off is fair play--if my\nboy has done amiss, I can beat him myself, and then you may keep your\nhands soft.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will beat him and thee too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Roland, without hesitation, \u00e2\u0080\u009can\nyou look not better after your business. See how the bird is cast away\nbetween you. I found the careless lurdane feeding him with unwashed\nflesh, and she an eyas.\u00e2\u0080\u009d [Footnote: There is a difference amongst\nauthorities how long the nestling hawk should be fed with flesh which\nhas previously been washed.]\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo to,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the falconer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthou art but an eyas thyself, child\nRoland.--What knowest thou of feeding? I say that the eyas should have\nher meat unwashed, until she becomes a brancher--'twere the ready way\nto give her the frounce, to wash her meat sooner, and so knows every one\nwho knows a gled from a falcon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is thine own laziness, thou false English blood, that dost nothing\nbut drink and sleep,\u00e2\u0080\u009d retorted the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand leaves that lither lad to\ndo the work, which he minds as little as thou.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd am I so idle then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the falconer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat have three cast of\nhawks to look after, at perch and mew, and to fly them in the field\nto boot?--and is my Lady's page so busy a man that he must take me\nup short?--and am I of false English blood?--I marvel what blood thou\nart--neither Englander nor Scot--fish nor flesh--a bastard from the\nDebateable Land, without either kith, kin, or ally!--Marry, out upon\nthee, foul kite, that would fain be a tercel gentle!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe reply to this sarcasm was a box on the ear, so well applied, that it\noverthrew the falconer into the cistern in which water was kept for\nthe benefit of the hawks. Up started Adam Woodcock, his wrath no way\nappeased by the cold immersion, and seizing on a truncheon which stood\nby, would have soon requited the injury he had received, had not Roland\nlaid his hand on his poniard, and sworn by all that was sacred, that\nif he offered a stroke towards him, he would sheath the blade in his\nbowels. The noise was now so great, that more than one of the household\ncame in, and amongst others the major-domo, a grave personage, already\nmentioned, whose gold chain and white wand intimated his authority.\nAt the appearance of this dignitary, the strife was for the present\nappeased. He embraced, however, so favourable an opportunity, to read\nRoland Graeme a shrewd lecture on the impropriety of his deportment to\nhis fellow-menials, and to assure him, that, should he communicate this\nfray to his master, (who, though now on one of his frequent expeditions,\nwas speedily expected to return,) which but for respect to his Lady he\nwould most certainly do, the residence of the culprit in the Castle of\nAvenel would be but of brief duration. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, however,\u00e2\u0080\u009d added the prudent\nmaster of the household, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will report the matter first to my Lady.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery just, very right, Master Wingate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed several voices\ntogether; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy Lady will consider if daggers, are to be drawn on us for\nevery idle word, and whether we are to live in a well-ordered household,\nwhere there is the fear of God, or amidst drawn dirks and sharp knives.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe object of this general resentment darted an angry glance around him,\nand suppressing with difficulty the desire which urged him to reply\nin furious or in contemptuous language, returned his dagger into his\nscabbard, looked disdainfully around upon the assembled menials, turned\nshort upon his heel, and pushing aside those who stood betwixt him and\nthe door, left the apartment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis will be no tree for my nest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the falconer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif this\ncock-sparrow is to crow over us as he seems to do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe struck me with his switch yesterday,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said one of the grooms,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause the tail of his worship's gelding was not trimmed altogether so\nas suited his humour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I promise you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the laundress, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy young master will stick\nnothing to call an honest woman slut and quean, if there be but a speck\nof soot upon his band-collar.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf Master Wingate do not his errand to my Lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the general\nresult, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere will be no tarrying in the same house with Roland\nGraeme.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe master of the household heard them all for some time, and then,\nmotioning for universal silence, he addressed them with all the\ndignity of Malvolio himself.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy masters,--not forgetting you, my\nmistresses,--do not think the worse of me that I proceed with as much\ncare as haste in this matter. Our master is a gallant knight, and will\nhave his sway at home and abroad, in wood and field, in hall and bower,\nas the saying is. Our Lady, my benison upon her, is also a noble person\nof long descent, and rightful heir of this place and barony, and she\nalso loves her will; as for that matter, show me the woman who doth\nnot. Now, she hath favoured, doth favour, and will favour, this\njack-an-ape,--for what good part about him I know not, save that as one\nnoble lady will love a messan dog, and another a screaming popinjay,\nand a third a Barbary ape, so doth it please our noble dame to set her\naffections upon this stray elf of a page, for nought that I can think\nof, save that she--was the cause of his being saved (the more's the\npity) from drowning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And here Master Wingate made a pause.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would have been his caution for a gray groat against salt water or\nfresh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland's adversary, the falconer; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmarry, if he crack not a\nrope for stabbing or for snatching, I will be content never to hood hawk\nagain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPeace, Adam Woodcock,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Wingate, waving his hand; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI prithee, peace\nman--Now, my Lady liking this springald, as aforesaid, differs therein\nfrom my Lord, who loves never a bone in his skin. Now, is it for me to\nstir up strife betwixt them, and put as'twere my finger betwixt the bark\nand the tree, on account of a pragmatical youngster, whom, nevertheless,\nI would willingly see whipped forth of the barony? Have patience, and\nthis boil will break without our meddling. I have been in service since\nI wore a beard on my chin, till now that that beard is turned gray, and\nI have seldom known any one better themselves, even by taking the lady's\npart against the lord's; but never one who did not dirk himself, if he\ntook the lord's against the lady's.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lilias, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe are to be crowed over, every one of us, men\nand women, cock and hen, by this little upstart?--I will try titles with\nhim first, I promise you.--I fancy, Master Wingate, for as wise as you\nlook, you will be pleased to tell what you have seen to-day, if my lady\ncommands you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo speak the truth when my lady commands me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the prudential\nmajor-domo, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis in some measure my duty, Mistress Lilias; always\nproviding for and excepting those cases in which it cannot be\nspoken without breeding mischief and inconvenience to myself or my\nfellow-servants; for the tongue of a tale-bearer breaketh bones as well\nas Jeddart-staff.\u00e2\u0080\u009d [Footnote: A species of battle-axe, so called as\nbeing in especial use in that ancient burgh, whose armorial bearing\nstill represent an armed horseman brandishing such a weapon.]\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut this imp of Satan is none of your friends or fellow-servants,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nLilias; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I trust you mean not to stand up for him against the whole\nfamily besides?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCredit me, Mrs. Lilias,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the senior, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshould I see the time\nfitting, I would, with right good-will give him a lick with the rough\nside of my tongue.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEnough said, Master Wingate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lilias; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthen trust me his song\nshall soon be laid. If my mistress does not ask me what is the matter\nbelow stairs before she be ten minutes of time older, she is no born\nwoman, and my name is not Lilias Bradbourne.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn pursuance of her plan, Mistress Lilias failed not to present herself\nbefore her mistress with all the exterior of one who is possessed of\nan important secret,--that is, she had the corners of her mouth turned\ndown, her eyes raised up, her lips pressed as fast together as if they\nhad been sewed up, to prevent her babbling, and an air of prim mystical\nimportance diffused over her whole person and demeanour, which seemed to\nintimate, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know something which I am resolved not to tell you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLilias had rightly read her mistress's temper, who, wise and good as\nshe was, was yet a daughter of grandame Eve, and could not witness this\nmysterious bearing on the part of her waiting-woman without longing to\nascertain the secret cause. For a space, Mrs. Lilias was obdurate to all\ninquiries, sighed, turned her eyes up higher yet to heaven, hoped for\nthe best, but had nothing particular to communicate. All this, as was\nmost natural and proper, only stimulated the Lady's curiosity;\nneither was her importunity to be parried with,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank God, I am no\nmakebate--no tale-bearer,--thank God, I never envied any one's favour,\nor was anxious to propale their misdemeanour-only, thank God, there has\nbeen no bloodshed and murder in the house--that is all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBloodshed and murder!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the Lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat does the quean\nmean?--if you speak not plain out, you shall have something you will\nscarce be thankful for.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, my Lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lilias, eager to disburden her mind, or, in,\nChaucer's phrase, to \u00e2\u0080\u009cunbuckle her mail,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you bid me speak out\nthe truth, you must not be moved with what might displease you--Roland\nGraeme has dirked Adam Woodstock--that is all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood Heaven!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, turning pale as ashes, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis the man slain?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Lilias, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut slain he would have been, if there\nhad not been ready help; but may be, it is your Ladyship's pleasure that\nthis young esquire shall poniard the servants, as well as switch and\nbaton them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo to, minion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are saucy-tell the master of the\nhousehold to attend me instantly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLilias hastened to seek out Mr. Wingate, and hurry him to his lady's\npresence, speaking as a word in season to him on the way, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have set\nthe stone a-trowling, look that you do not let it stand still.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe steward, too prudential a person to commit himself otherwise,\nanswered by a sly look and a nod of intelligence, and presently after\nstood in the presence of the Lady of Avenel, with a look of great\nrespect for his lady, partly real, partly affected, and an air of great\nsagacity, which inferred no ordinary conceit of himself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow is this, Wingate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand what rule do you keep in the\ncastle, that the domestics of Sir Halbert Glendinning draw the dagger on\neach other, as in a cavern of thieves and murderers?--is the wounded man\nmuch hurt? and what--what hath become of the unhappy boy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is no one wounded as yet, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied he of the golden chain;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cit passes my poor skill to say how many may be wounded before Pasche,\n[Footnote: Easter.] if some rule be not taken with this youth--not but\nthe youth is a fair youth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, correcting himself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand able at\nhis exercise; but somewhat too ready with the ends of his fingers, the\nbutt of his riding-switch, and the point of his dagger.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd whose fault is that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut yours, who should have\ntaught him better discipline, than to brawl or to draw his dagger.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it please your Ladyship so to impose the blame on me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the\nsteward, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is my part, doubtless, to bear it--only I submit to your\nconsideration, that unless I nailed his weapon to the scabbard, I could\nno more keep it still, than I could fix quicksilver, which defied even\nthe skill of Raymond Lullius.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTell me not of Raymond Lullius,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, losing patience, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut\nsend me the chaplain hither. You grow all of you too wise for me, during\nyour lord's long and repeated absences. I would to God his affairs would\npermit him to remain at home and rule his own household, for it passes\nmy wit and skill!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGod forbid, my Lady!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the old domestic, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you should sincerely\nthink what you are now pleased to say: your old servants might well\nhope, that after so many years' duty, you would do their service more\njustice than to distrust their gray hairs, because they cannot rule the\npeevish humour of a green head, which the owner carries, it may be, a\nbrace of inches higher than becomes him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLeave me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady; \u00e2\u0080\u009cSir Halbert's return must now be expected\ndaily, and he will look into these matters himself--leave me, I say,\nWingate, without saying more of it. I know you are honest, and I believe\nthe boy is petulant; and yet I think it is my favour which hath set all\nof you against him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe steward bowed and retired, after having been silenced in a second\nattempt to explain the motives on which he acted.\n\nThe chaplain arrived; but neither from him did the Lady receive much\ncomfort. On the contrary, she found him disposed, in plain terms, to\nlay to the door of her indulgence all the disturbances which the fiery\ntemper of Roland Graeme had already occasioned, or might hereafter\noccasion, in the family. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009chonoured Lady, that you\nhad deigned to be ruled by me in the outset of this matter, sith it is\neasy to stem evil in the fountain, but hard to struggle against it in\nthe stream. You, honoured madam, (a word which I do not use according to\nthe vain forms of this world, but because I have ever loved and honoured\nyou as an honourable and elect lady,)--you, I say, madam, have been\npleased, contrary to my poor but earnest counsel, to raise this boy from\nhis station, into one approaching to your own.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat mean you, reverend sir?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have made this youth\na page--is there aught in my doing so that does not become my character\nand quality?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI dispute not, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the pertinacious preacher, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour benevolent\npurpose in taking charge of this youth, or your title to give him this\nidle character of page, if such was your pleasure; though what the\neducation of a boy in the train of a female can tend to, save to ingraft\nfoppery and effeminacy on conceit and arrogance, it passes my knowledge\nto discover. But I blame you more directly for having taken little care\nto guard him against the perils of his condition, or to tame and humble\na spirit naturally haughty, overbearing, and impatient. You have brought\ninto your bower a lion's cub; delighted with the beauty of his fur, and\nthe grace of his gambols, you have bound him with no fetters befitting\nthe fierceness of his disposition. You have let him grow up as unawed as\nif he had been still a tenant of the forest, and now you are surprised,\nand call out for assistance, when he begins to ramp, rend, and tear,\naccording to his proper nature.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Warden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, considerably offended, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are my\nhusband's ancient friend, and I believe your love sincere to him and\nto his household. Yet let me say, that when I asked you for counsel,\nI expected not this asperity of rebuke. If I have done wrong in loving\nthis poor orphan lad more than others of his class, I scarce think\nthe error merited such severe censure; and if stricter discipline were\nrequired to keep his fiery temper in order, it ought, I think, to be\nconsidered, that I am a woman, and that if I have erred in this matter,\nit becomes a friend's part rather to aid than to rebuke me. I would\nthese evils were taken order with before my lord's return. He loves not\ndomestic discord or domestic brawls; and I would not willingly that he\nthought such could arise from one whom I favoured--What do you counsel\nme to do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDismiss this youth from your service, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the preacher.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou cannot bid me do so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou cannot, as a Christian\nand a man of humanity, bid me turn away an unprotected creature against\nwhom my favour, my injudicious favour if you will, has reared up so many\nenemies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not necessary you should altogether abandon him, though you\ndismiss him to another service, or to a calling better suiting his\nstation and character,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the preacher; \u00e2\u0080\u009celsewhere he maybe an useful\nand profitable member of the commonweal--here he is but a makebate, and\na stumbling-block of offence. The youth has snatches of sense and of\nintelligence, though he lacks industry. I will myself give him letters\ncommendatory to Olearius Schinderhausen, a learned professor at the\nfamous university of Leyden, where they lack an under-janitor--where,\nbesides gratis instruction, if God give him the grace to seek it, he\nwill enjoy five merks by the year, and the professor's cast-off suit,\nwhich he disparts with biennially.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis will never do, good Mr. Warden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, scarce able to\nsuppress a smile; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe will think more at large upon this matter. In the\nmeanwhile, I trust to your remonstrances with this wild boy and with the\nfamily, for restraining these violent and unseemly jealousies and bursts\nof passion; and I entreat you to press on him and them their duty in\nthis respect towards God, and towards their master.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou shall be obeyed, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Warden. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOn the next Thursday I\nexhort the family, and will, with God's blessing, so wrestle with the\ndemon of wrath and violence, which hath entered into my little flock,\nthat I trust to hound the wolf out of the fold, as if he were chased\naway with bandogs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis was the part of the conference from which Mr. Warden derived the\ngreatest pleasure. The pulpit was at that time the same powerful engine\nfor affecting popular feeling which the press has since become, and he\nhad been no unsuccessful preacher, as we have already seen. It followed\nas a natural consequence, that he rather over-estimated the powers of\nhis own oratory, and, like some of his brethren about the period, was\nglad of an opportunity to handle any matters of importance, whether\npublic or private, the discussion of which could be dragged into his\ndiscourse. In that rude age the delicacy was unknown which prescribed\ntime and place to personal exhortations; and as the court-preacher often\naddressed the King individually, and dictated to him the conduct he\nought to observe in matters of state, so the nobleman himself, or any of\nhis retainers, were, in the chapel of the feudal castle, often incensed\nor appalled, as the case might be, by the discussion of their private\nfaults in the evening exercise, and by spiritual censures directed\nagainst them, specifically, personally, and by name. The sermon, by\nmeans of which Henry Warden purposed to restore concord and good order\nto the Castle of Avenel, bore for text the well-known words, \u00e2\u0080\u009c_He who\nstriketh with the sword shall perish by the sword,_\u00e2\u0080\u009d and was a singular\nmixture of good sense and powerful oratory with pedantry and bad taste.\nHe enlarged a good deal on the word striketh, which he assured his\nhearers comprehended blows given with the point as well as with\nthe edge, and more generally, shooting with hand-gun, cross-bow, or\nlong-bow, thrusting with a lance, or doing any thing whatever by which\ndeath might be occasioned to the adversary. In the same manner,\nhe proved satisfactorily, that the word sword comprehended all\ndescriptions, whether backsword or basket-hilt, cut-and-thrust or\nrapier, falchion, or scimitar. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut if,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, with still\ngreater animation, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe text includeth in its anathema those who strike\nwith any of those weapons which man hath devised for the exercise of his\nopen hostility, still more doth it comprehend such as from their form\nand size are devised rather for the gratification of privy malice by\ntreachery, than for the destruction of an enemy prepared and standing\nupon his defence. Such,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he proceeded, looking sternly at the place\nwhere the page was seated on a cushion at the feet of his mistress, and\nwearing in his crimson belt a gay dagger with a gilded hilt,--\u00e2\u0080\u009csuch,\nmore especially, I hold to be those implements of death, which, in\nour modern and fantastic times, are worn not only by thieves and\ncut-throats, to whom they most properly belong, but even by those who\nattend upon women, and wait in the chambers of honourable ladies. Yes,\nmy friends,--every species of this unhappy weapon, framed for all evil\nand for no good, is comprehended under this deadly denunciation, whether\nit be a stillet, which we have borrowed from the treacherous Italian, or\na dirk, which is borne by the savage Highlandman, or a whinger, which is\ncarried by our own Border thieves and cut-throats, or a dudgeon-dagger,\nall are alike engines invented by the devil himself, for ready\nimplements of deadly wrath, sudden to execute, and difficult to be\nparried. Even the common sword-and-buckler brawler despises the use of\nsuch a treacherous and malignant instrument, which is therefore fit to\nbe used, not by men or soldiers, but by those who, trained under female\ndiscipline, become themselves effeminate hermaphrodites, having female\nspite and female cowardice added to the infirmities and evil passions of\ntheir masculine nature.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe effect which this oration produced upon the assembled congregation\nof Avenel cannot very easily be described. The lady seemed at once\nembarrassed and offended; the menials could hardly contain, under\nan affectation of deep attention, the joy with which they heard the\nchaplain launch his thunders at the head of the unpopular favourite, and\nthe weapon which they considered as a badge of affectation and finery.\nMrs. Lilias crested and drew up her head with all the deep-felt pride of\ngratified resentment; while the steward, observing a strict neutrality\nof aspect, fixed his eyes upon an old scutcheon on the opposite side\nof the wall, which he seemed to examine with the utmost accuracy, more\nwilling, perhaps, to incur the censure of being inattentive to the\nsermon, than that of seeming to listen with marked approbation to what\nappeared so distasteful to his mistress.\n\nThe unfortunate subject of the harangue, whom nature had endowed with\npassions which had hitherto found no effectual restraint, could not\ndisguise the resentment which he felt at being thus directly held up to\nthe scorn, as well as the censure, of the assembled inhabitants of the\nlittle world in which he lived. His brow grew red, his lip grew pale, he\nset his teeth, he clenched his hand, and then with mechanical readiness\ngrasped the weapon of which the clergyman had given so hideous a\ncharacter; and at length, as the preacher heightened the colouring of\nhis invective, he felt his rage become so ungovernable, that, fearful\nof being hurried into some deed of desperate violence, he rose up,\ntraversed the chapel with hasty steps, and left the congregation.\n\nThe preacher was surprised into a sudden pause, while the fiery youth\nshot across him like a flash of lightning, regarding him as he passed,\nas if he had wished to dart from his eyes the same power of blighting\nand of consuming. But no sooner had he crossed the chapel, and shut\nwith violence behind him the door of the vaulted entrance by which\nit communicated with the castle, than the impropriety of his conduct\nsupplied Warden with one of those happier subjects for eloquence, of\nwhich he knew how to take advantage for making a suitable impression on\nhis hearers. He paused for an instant, and then pronounced, in a slow\nand solemn voice, the deep anathema: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe hath gone out from us because\nhe was not of us--the sick man hath been offended at the wholesome\nbitter of the medicine--the wounded patient hath flinched from the\nfriendly knife of the surgeon--the sheep hath fled from the sheepfold\nand delivered himself to the wolf, because he could not assume the\nquiet and humble conduct demanded of us by the great Shepherd. Ah! my\nbrethren, beware of wrath--beware of pride--beware of the deadly and\ndestroying sin which so often shows itself to our frail eyes in\nthe garments of light! What is our earthly honour? Pride, and pride\nonly--What our earthly gifts and graces? Pride and vanity. Voyagers\nspeak of Indian men who deck themselves with shells, and anoint\nthemselves with pigments, and boast of their attire as we do of our\nmiserable carnal advantages--Pride could draw down the morning-star from\nHeaven even to the verge of the pit--Pride and self-opinion kindled the\nflaming sword which waves us off from Paradise--Pride made Adam mortal,\nand a weary wanderer on the face of the earth, which he had else been at\nthis day the immortal lord of--Pride brought amongst us sin, and doubles\nevery sin it has brought. It is the outpost which the devil and the\nflesh most stubbornly maintain against the assaults of grace; and until\nit be subdued, and its barriers levelled with the very earth, there is\nmore hope of a fool than of the sinner. Rend, then, from your bosoms\nthis accursed shoot of the fatal apple; tear it up by the roots, though\nit be twisted with the chords of your life. Profit by the example of the\nmiserable sinner that has passed from us, and embrace the means of\ngrace while it is called to-day 'ere your conscience is seared as with\na fire-brand, and your ears deafened like those of the adder, and\nyour heart hardened like the nether mill-stone. Up, then, and be\ndoing--wrestle and overcome; resist, and the enemy shall flee from\nyou--Watch and pray, lest ye fall into temptation, and let the stumbling\nof others be your warning and your example. Above all, rely not on\nyourselves, for such self-confidence is even the worst symptom of the\ndisorder itself. The Pharisee, perhaps, deemed himself humble while he\nstooped in the Temple, and thanked God that he was not as other men, and\neven as the publican. But while his knees touched the marble pavement,\nhis head was as high as the topmost pinnacle of the Temple. Do not,\ntherefore, deceive yourselves, and offer false coin, where the purest\nyou can present is but as dross--think not that such--will pass the\nassay of Omnipotent Wisdom. Yet shrink not from the task, because, as\nis my bounden duty, I do not disguise from you its difficulties.\nSelf-searching can do much--Meditation can do much--Grace can do all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he concluded with a touching and animating exhortation to his\nhearers to seek divine grace, which is perfected in human wakness.\n\nThe audience did not listen to this address without being considerably\naffected; though it might be doubted whether the feelings of triumph,\nexcited by the disgraceful retreat of the favourite page, did not\ngreatly qualify in the minds of many the exhortations of the preacher\nto charity and to humility. And, in fact, the expression of their\ncountenances much resembled the satisfied triumphant air of a set of\nchildren, who, having just seen a companion punished for a fault in\nwhich they had no share, con their task with double glee, both because\nthey themselves are out of the scrape, and because the culprit is in it.\n\nWith very different feelings did the Lady of Avenel seek her own\napartment. She felt angry at Warden having made a domestic matter,\nin which she took a personal interest, the subject of such public\ndiscussion. But this she knew the good man claimed as a branch of his\nChristian liberty as a preacher, and also that it was vindicated by the\nuniversal custom of his brethren. But the self-willed conduct of her\nproteg\u00c3\u00a9 afforded her yet deeper concern. That he had broken through in\nso remarkable a degree, not only the respect due to her presence, but\nthat which was paid to religious admonition in those days with such\npeculiar reverence, argued a spirit as untameable as his enemies had\nrepresented him to possess. And yet so far as he had been under her own\neye, she had seen no more of that fiery spirit than appeared to her to\nbecome his years and his vivacity. This opinion might be founded in\nsome degree on partiality; in some degree, too, it might be owing to the\nkindness and indulgence which she had always extended to him; but still\nshe thought it impossible that she could be totally mistaken in the\nestimate she had formed of his character. The extreme of violence is\nscarce consistent with a course of continued hypocrisy, (although Lilias\ncharitably hinted, that in some instances they were happily united,) and\nthere fore she could not exactly trust the report of others against her\nown experience and observation. The thoughts of this orphan boy clung\nto her heartstrings with a fondness for which she herself was unable to\naccount. He seemed to have been sent to her by Heaven, to fill up those\nintervals of languor and vacuity which deprived her of much enjoyment.\nPerhaps he was not less dear to her, because she well saw that he was\na favourite with no one else, and because she felt, that to give him up\nwas to afford the judgment of her husband and others a triumph over\nher own; a circumstance not quite indifferent to the best of spouses of\neither sex.\n\nIn short, the Lady of Avenel formed the internal resolution, that she\nwould not desert her page while her page could be rationally protected;\nand, with a view of ascertaining how far this might be done, she caused\nhim to be summoned to her presence.\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Fifth.\n\n\n  --In the wild storm,\n  The seaman hews his mast down, and the merchant\n  Heaves to the billows wares he once deem'd precious;\n  So prince and peer, 'mid popular contentions,\n  Cast off their favourites.\n                                  OLD PLAY.\n\nIt was some time ere Roland Graeme appeared. The messenger (his old\nfriend Lilias) had at first attempted to open the door of his little\napartment with the charitable purpose, doubtless, of enjoying the\nconfusion, and marking the demeanour of the culprit. But an oblong bit\nof iron, ycleped a bolt, was passed across the door on the inside, and\nprevented her benign intentions. Lilias knocked and called at intervals.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRoland--Roland Graeme--_Master_ Roland Graeme\u00e2\u0080\u009d (an emphasis on the word\nMaster,) \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill you be pleased to undo the door?--What ails you?--are\nyou at your prayers in private, to complete the devotion which you left\nunfinished in public?--Surely we must have a screened seat for you in\nthe chapel, that your gentility may be free from the eyes of common\nfolks!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Still no whisper was heard in reply. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, master Roland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nthe waiting-maid, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI must tell my mistress, that if she would have an\nanswer, she must either come herself, or send those on errand to you who\ncan beat the door down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat says your Lady?\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the page from within.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMarry, open the door, and you shall hear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the waiting-maid.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI trow it becomes my Lady's message to be listened to face to face; and\nI will not for your idle pleasure, whistle it through a key-hole.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour mistress's name,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, opening the door, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis too fair a\ncover for your impertinence--What says my Lady?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat you will be pleased to come to her directly, in the\nwithdrawing-room,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lilias. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI presume she has some directions\nfor you concerning the forms to be observed in leaving chapel in\nfuture.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSay to my Lady, that I will directly wait on her,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the page;\nand returning into his apartment, he once more locked the door in the\nface of the waiting-maid.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRare courtesy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d muttered Lilias; and, returning to her mistress,\nacquainted her that Roland Graeme would wait on her when it suited his\nconvenience.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat, is that his addition, or your own phrase, Lilias?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady,\ncoolly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the attendant, not directly answering the\nquestion, \u00e2\u0080\u009che looked as if he could have said much more impertinent\nthings than that, if I had been willing to hear them.--But here he comes\nto answer for himself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland Graeme entered the apartment with a loftier mien, and somewhat a\nhigher colour than his wont; there was embarrassment in his manner, but\nit was neither that of fear nor of penitence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYoung man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat trow you I am to think of your conduct\nthis day?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it has offended you, madam, I am deeply grieved,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the youth.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo have offended me alone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwere but little--You\nhave been guilty of conduct which will highly offend your master--of\nviolence to your fellow-servants, and of disrespect to God himself, in\nthe person of his ambassador.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPermit me again to reply,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat if I have offended\nmy only mistress, friend, and benefactress, it includes the sum of my\nguilt, and deserves the sum of my penitence--Sir Halbert Glendinning\ncalls me not servant, nor do I call him master--he is not entitled to\nblame me for chastising an insolent groom--nor do I fear the wrath\nof Heaven for treating with scorn the unauthorized interference of a\nmeddling preacher.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Lady of Avenel had before this seen symptoms in her favourite of\nboyish petulance, and of impatience of censure or reproof. But his\npresent demeanour was of a graver and more determined character, and she\nwas for a moment at a loss how she should treat the youth, who seemed to\nhave at once assumed the character not only of a man, but of a bold and\ndetermined one. She paused an instant, and then assuming the dignity\nwhich was natural to her, she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it to me, Roland, that you hold\nthis language? Is it for the purpose of making me repent the favour I\nhave shown you, that you declare yourself independent both of an earthly\nand a Heavenly master? Have you forgotten what you were, and to what the\nloss of my protection would speedily again reduce you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have forgot nothing, I remember but too much.\nI know, that but for you, I should have perished in yon blue waves,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n pointing, as he spoke, to the lake, which was seen through the\nwindow, agitated by the western wind. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour goodness has gone farther,\nmadam--you have protected me against the malice of others, and against\nmy own folly. You are free, if you are willing, to abandon the orphan\nyou have reared. You have left nothing undone by him, and he complains\nof nothing. And yet, Lady, do not think I have been ungrateful--I have\nendured something on my part, which I would have borne for the sake of\nno one but my benefactress.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor my sake!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand what is it that I can have subjected\nyou to endure, which can be remembered with other feelings than those of\nthanks and gratitude?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are too just, madam, to require me to be thankful for the cold\nneglect with which your husband has uniformly treated me--neglect not\nunmingled with fixed aversion. You are too just, madam, to require me\nto be grateful for the constant and unceasing marks of scorn and\nmalevolence with which I have been treated by others, or for such a\nhomily as that with which your reverend chaplain has, at my expense,\nthis very day regaled the assembled household.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHeard mortal ears the like of this!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the waiting-maid, with her\nhands expanded and her eyes turned up to heaven; \u00e2\u0080\u009che speaks as if he\nwere son of an earl, or of a belted knight the least penny!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe page glanced on her a look of supreme contempt, but vouchsafed\nno other answer. His mistress, who began to feel herself seriously\noffended, and yet sorry for the youth's folly, took up the same tone.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed, Roland, you forget yourself so strangely,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you\nwill tempt me to take serious measures to lower you in your own opinion\nby reducing you to your proper station in society.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d added Lilias, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould be best done by turning him out the\nsame beggar's brat that your ladyship took him in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLilias speaks too rudely,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued the Lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut she has spoken the\ntruth, young man; nor do I think I ought to spare that pride which\nhath so completely turned your head. You have been tricked up with fine\ngarments, and treated like the son of a gentleman, until you have forgot\nthe fountain of your churlish blood.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCraving your pardon, most honourable madam, Lilias hath _not_ spoken\ntruth, nor does your ladyship know aught of my descent, which should\nentitle you to treat it with such decided scorn. I am no beggar's\nbrat--my grandmother begged from no one, here nor elsewhere--she would\nhave perished sooner on the bare moor. We were harried out and driven\nfrom our home--a chance which has happed elsewhere, and to others.\nAvenel Castle, with its lake and its towers, was not at all times able\nto protect its inhabitants from want and desolation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHear but his assurance!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lilias, \u00e2\u0080\u009che upbraids my Lady with the\ndistresses of her family!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt had indeed been a theme more gratefully spared,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady,\naffected nevertheless with the allusion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was necessary, madam, for my vindication,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cor I\nhad not even hinted at a word that might give you pain. But believe,\nhonoured Lady, I am of no churl's blood. My proper descent I know not;\nbut my only relation has said, and my heart has echoed it back and\nattested the truth, that I am sprung of gentle blood, and deserve gentle\nusage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd upon an assurance so vague as this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo you propose\nto expect all the regard, all the privileges, befitting high rank and\ndistinguished birth, and become a contender for concessions which are\nonly due to the noble? Go to, sir, know yourself, or the master of\nthe household shall make you know you are liable to the scourge as a\nmalapert boy. You have tasted too little the discipline fit for your age\nand station.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe master of the household shall taste of my dagger, ere I taste of\nhis discipline,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, giving way to his restrained passion.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLady, I have been too long the vassal of a pantoufle, and the slave\nof a silver whistle. You must henceforth find some other to answer your\ncall; and let him be of birth and spirit mean enough to brook the scorn\nof your menials, and to call a church vassal his master.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have deserved this insult,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, colouring deeply, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor\nso long enduring and fostering your petulance. Begone, sir. Leave this\ncastle to-night--I will send you the means of subsistence till you find\nsome honest mode of support, though I fear your imaginary grandeur will\nbe above all others, save those of rapine and violence. Begone, sir, and\nsee my face no more.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe page threw himself at her feet in an agony of sorrow. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear\nand honoured mistress,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, but was unable to bring out another\nsyllable.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cArise, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand let go my mantle--hypocrisy is a poor\ncloak for ingratitude.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am incapable of either, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, springing up with the\nhasty start of passion which belonged to his rapid and impetuous temper.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThink not I meant to implore permission to reside here; it has been\nlong my determination to leave Avenel, and I will never forgive myself\nfor having permitted you to say the word begone, ere I said, 'I leave\nyou.' I did but kneel to ask your forgiveness for an ill-considered word\nused in the height of displeasure, but which ill became my mouth,\nas addressed to you. Other grace I asked not--you have done much for\nme--but I repeat, that you better know what you yourself have done, than\nwhat I have suffered.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRoland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, somewhat appeased, and relenting towards her\nfavourite, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou had me to appeal to when you were aggrieved. You were\nneither called upon to suffer wrong, nor entitled to resent it, when you\nwere under my protection.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the youth, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif I sustained wrong from those you loved\nand favoured, was I to disturb your peace with idle tale-bearings and\neternal complaints? No, madam; I have borne my own burden in silence,\nand without disturbing you with murmurs; and the respect with which\nyou accuse me of wanting, furnishes the only reason why I have neither\nappealed to you, nor taken vengeance at my own hand in a manner far more\neffectual. It is well, however, that we part. I was not born to be a\nstipendiary, favoured by his mistress, until ruined by the calumnies\nof others. May Heaven multiply its choicest blessings on your honoured\nhead; and, for your sake, upon all that are dear to you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe was about to leave the apartment, when the Lady called upon him to\nreturn. He stood still, while she thus addressed him: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was not my\nintention, nor would it be just, even in the height of my displeasure,\nto dismiss you without the means of support; take this purse of gold.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cForgive me, Lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the boy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand let me go hence with the\nconsciousness that I have not been degraded to the point of accepting\nalms. If my poor services can be placed against the expense of my\napparel and my maintenance, I only remain debtor to you for my life, and\nthat alone is a debt which I can never repay; put up then that purse,\nand only say, instead, that you do not part from me in anger.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, not in anger,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin sorrow rather for your\nwilfulness; but take the gold, you cannot but need it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMay God evermore bless you for the kind tone and the kind word! but the\ngold I cannot take. I am able of body, and do not lack friends so wholly\nas you may think; for the time may come that I may yet show myself more\nthankful than by mere words.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He threw himself on his knees, kissed the\nhand which she did not withdraw, and then, hastily left the apartment.\n\nLilias, for a moment or two, kept her eye fixed on her mistress, who\nlooked so unusually pale, that she seemed about to faint; but the Lady\ninstantly recovered herself, and declining the assistance which her\nattendant offered her, walked to her own apartment.\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Sixth.\n\n\n  Thou hast each secret of the household, Francis.\n  I dare be sworn thou hast been in the buttery,\n  Steeping thy curious humour in fat ale,\n  And in thy butler's tattle--ay, or chatting\n  With the glib waiting-woman o'er her comfits--\n  These bear the key to each domestic mystery.\n                                  OLD PLAY.\n\nUpon the morrow succeeding the scene we have described, the disgraced\nfavourite left the castle; and at breakfast-time the cautious old\nsteward and Mrs. Lilias sat in the apartment of the latter personage,\nholding grave converse on the important event of the day, sweetened by a\nsmall treat of comfits, to which the providence of Mr. Wingate had added\na little flask of racy canary.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is gone at last,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the abigail, sipping her glass; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand here is\nto his good journey.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAmen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the steward, gravely; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish the poor deserted lad no\nill.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd he is gone like a wild-duck, as he came,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Mrs. Lilias;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cno lowering of drawbridges, or pacing along causeways, for him. My\nmaster has pushed off in the boat which they call the little Herod,\n(more shame to them for giving the name of a Christian to wood and\niron,) and has rowed himself by himself to the farther side of the loch,\nand off and away with himself, and left all his finery strewed about his\nroom. I wonder who is to clean his trumpery out after him--though the\nthings are worth lifting, too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoubtless, Mistress Lilias,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the master of the household,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cin the which case, I am free to think, they will not long cumber the\nfloor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now tell me, Master Wingate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued the damsel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo not the\nvery cockles of your heart rejoice at the house being rid of this\nupstart whelp, that flung us all into shadow?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, Mistress Lilias,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Wingate, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas to rejoicing--those who\nhave lived as long in great families as has been my lot, will be in no\nhurry to rejoice at any thing. And for Roland Graeme, though he may be a\ngood riddance in the main, yet what says the very sooth proverb, 'Seldom\ncomes a better.'\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSeldom comes a better, indeed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d echoed Mrs. Lilias. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI say, never can\ncome a worse, or one half so bad. He might have been the ruin of our\npoor dear mistress,\u00e2\u0080\u009d (here she used her kerchief,) \u00e2\u0080\u009cbody and soul, and\nestate too; for she spent more coin on his apparel than on any four\nservants about the house.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMistress Lilias,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the sage steward, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do opine that our mistress\nrequireth not this pity at your hands, being in all respects competent\nto take care of her own body, soul, and estate into the bargain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou would not mayhap have said so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the waiting-woman, \u00e2\u0080\u009chad\nyou seen how like Lot's wife she looked when young master took his\nleave. My mistress is a good lady, and a virtuous, and a well-doing\nlady, and a well-spoken of--but I would not Sir Halbert had seen her\nlast evening for two and a plack.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, foy! foy! foy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d reiterated the steward; \u00e2\u0080\u009cservants should hear and\nsee, and say nothing. Besides that, my lady is utterly devoted to Sir\nHalbert, as well she may, being, as he is, the most renowned knight in\nthese parts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the abigail, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI mean no more harm; but they that seek\nleast renown abroad, are most apt to find quiet at home, that's all; and\nmy Lady's lonesome situation is to be considered, that made her fain to\ntake up with the first beggar's brat that a dog brought her out of the\nloch.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd, therefore,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the steward, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI say, rejoice not too much, or too\nhastily, Mistress Lilias; for if your Lady wished a favourite to pass\naway the time, depend upon it, the time will not pass lighter now that\nhe is gone. So she will have another favourite to choose for herself;\nand be assured, if she wishes such a toy, she will not lack one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd where should she choose one, but among her own tried and faithful\nservants,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Lilias, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwho have broken her bread, and drunk her\ndrink, for so many years? I have known many a lady as high as she is,\nthat never thought either of a friend or favourite beyond their own\nwaiting-woman--always having a proper respect, at the same time, for\ntheir old and faithful master of the household, Master Wingate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTruly, Mistress Lilias,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the steward, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do partly see the mark\nat which you shoot, but I doubt your bolt will fall short. Matters\nbeing with our Lady as it likes you to suppose, it will neither be your\ncrimped pinners, Mrs. Lilias, (speaking of them with due respect,) nor\nmy silver hair, or golden chain, that will fill up the void which Roland\nGraeme must needs leave in our Lady's leisure. There will be a learned\nyoung divine with some new doctrine--a learned leech with some new\ndrug--a bold cavalier, who will not be refused the favour of wearing her\ncolours at a running at the ring--a cunning harper that could harp the\nheart out of woman's breast, as they say Signer David Rizzio did to\nour poor Queen;--these are the sort of folk who supply the loss of\na well-favoured favourite, and not an old steward, or a middle-aged\nwaiting-woman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Lilias, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have experience, Master Wingate, and truly\nI would my master would leave off his picking hither and thither,\nand look better after the affairs of his household. There will be a\npapestrie among us next, for what should I see among master's clothes\nbut a string of gold beads! I promise you, _aves_ and _credos_ both!--I\nseized on them like a falcon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI doubt it not, I doubt it not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the steward, sagaciously nodding\nhis head; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have often noticed that the boy had strange observances\nwhich savoured of popery, and that he was very jealous to conceal them.\nBut you will find the Catholic under the Presbyterian cloak as often as\nthe knave under the Friar's hood--what then? we are all mortal--Right\nproper beads they are,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, looking attentively at them, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand may\nweigh four ounces of fine gold.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I will have them melted down presently,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbefore they be\nthe misguiding of some poor blinded soul.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery cautious, indeed, Mistress Lilias,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the steward, nodding his\nhead in assent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will have them made,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Lilias, \u00e2\u0080\u009cinto a pair of shoe-buckles;\nI would not wear the Pope's trinkets, or whatever has once borne the\nshape of them, one inch above my instep, were they diamonds instead\nof gold.--But this is what has come of Father Ambrose coming about the\ncastle, as demure as a cat that is about to steal cream.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFather Ambrose is our master's brother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the steward gravely.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery true, Master Wingate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Dame; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut is that a good\nreason why he should pervert the king's liege subjects to papistrie?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHeaven forbid, Mistress Lilias,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the sententious major-domo;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cbut yet there are worse folk than the Papists.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wonder where they are to be found,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the waiting-woman, with some\nasperity; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I believe, Master Wingate, if one were to speak to you\nabout the devil himself, you would say there were worse people than\nSatan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAssuredly I might say so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the steward, \u00e2\u0080\u009csupposing that I saw\nSatan standing at my elbow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe waiting-woman started, and having exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGod bless us!\u00e2\u0080\u009d added,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wonder, Master Wingate, you can take pleasure in frightening one\nthus.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, Mistress Lilias, I had no such purpose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the reply; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut look\nyou here--the Papists are but put down for the present, but who knows\nhow long this word _present_ will last? There are two great Popish earls\nin the north of England, that abominate the very word reformation; I\nmean the Northumberland and Westmoreland Earls, men of power enough to\nshake any throne in Christendom. Then, though our Scottish king be,\nGod bless him, a true Protestant, yet he is but a boy; and here is his\nmother that was our queen--I trust there is no harm to say, God bless\nher too--and she is a Catholic; and many begin to think she has had but\nhard measure, such as the Hamiltons in the west, and some of our Border\nclans here, and the Gordons in the north, who are all wishing to see a\nnew world; and if such a new world should chance to come up, it is like\nthat the Queen will take back her own crown, and that the mass and the\ncross will come up, and then down go pulpits, Geneva-gowns, and black\nsilk skull-caps.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd have you, Master Jasper Wingate, who have heard the word, and\nlistened unto pure and precious Mr. Henry Warden, have you, I say, the\npatience to speak, or but to think, of popery coming down on us like a\nstorm, or of the woman Mary again making the royal seat of Scotland a\nthrone of abomination? No marvel that you are so civil to the cowled\nmonk, Father Ambrose, when he comes hither with his downcast eyes that\nhe never raises to my Lady's face, and with his low sweet-toned voice,\nand his benedicites, and his benisons; and who so ready to take them\nkindly as Master Wingate?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMistress Lilias,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the butler, with an air which was intended\nto close the debate, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere are reasons for all things. If I received\nFather Ambrose debonairly, and suffered him to steal a word now and\nthen with this same Roland Graeme, it was not that I cared a brass\nbodle for his benison or malison either, but only because I respected\nmy master's blood. And who can answer, if Mary come in again, whether he\nmay not be as stout a tree to lean to as ever his brother hath proved\nto us? For down goes the Earl of Murray when the Queen comes by her\nown again; and good is his luck if he can keep the head on his own\nshoulders. And down goes our Knight, with the Earl, his patron; and who\nso like to mount into his empty saddle as this same Father Ambrose? The\nPope of Rome can so soon dispense with his vows, and then we should have\nSir Edward the soldier, instead of Ambrose the priest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnger and astonishment kept Mrs. Lilias silent,--while her old friend,\nin his self-complacent manner, was making known to her his political\nspeculations. At length her resentment found utterance in words of\ngreat ire and scorn. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat, Master Wingate! have you eaten my mistress's\nbread, to say nothing of my master's, so many years, that you could live\nto think of her being dispossessed of her own Castle of Avenel, by a\nwretched monk, who is not a drop's blood to her in the way of relation?\nI, that am but a woman, would try first whether my rock or his cowl was\nthe better metal. Shame on you, Master Wingate! I If I had not held\nyou as so old an acquaintance, this should have gone to my Lady's ears\nthough I had been called pickthank and tale-pyet for my pains, as when I\ntold of Roland Graeme shooting the wild swan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMaster Wingate was somewhat dismayed at perceiving, that the details\nwhich he had given of his far-sighted political views had produced on\nhis hearer rather suspicion of his fidelity, than admiration of his\nwisdom, and endeavoured, as hastily as possible, to apologize and to\nexplain, although internally extremely offended at the unreasonable\nview, as he deemed it, which it had pleased Mistress Lilias\nBradbourne to take of his expressions; and mentally convinced that her\ndisapprobation of his sentiments arose solely out of the consideration,\nthat though Father Ambrose, supposing him to become the master of the\ncastle, would certainly require the services of a steward, yet those\nof a waiting-woman would, in the supposed circumstances, be altogether\nsuperfluous.\n\nAfter his explanation had been received as explanations usually are, the\ntwo friends separated; Lilias to attend the silver whistle which called\nher to her mistress's chamber, and the sapient major-domo to the duties\nof his own department. They parted with less than their usual degree of\nreverence and regard; for the steward felt that his worldly wisdom was\nrebuked by the more disinterested attachment of the waiting-woman, and\nMistress Lilias Bradbourne was compelled to consider her old friend as\nsomething little better than a time-server.\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Seventh.\n\n\n  When I hae a saxpence under my thumb,\n  Then I get credit in ilka town;\n  But when I am puir they bid me gae by--\n  Oh, poverty parts good company!\n                         OLD SONG.\n\nWhile the departure of the page afforded subject for the conversation\nwhich we have detailed in our last chapter, the late favourite was far\nadvanced on his solitary journey, without well knowing what was its\nobject, or what was likely to be its end. He had rowed the skiff in\nwhich he left the castle, to the side of the lake most distant from the\nvillage, with the desire of escaping from the notice of the inhabitants.\nHis pride whispered, that he would be in his discarded state, only the\nsubject of their wonder and compassion; and his generosity told him,\nthat any mark of sympathy which his situation should excite, might be\nunfavourably reported at the castle. A trifling incident convinced him\nhe had little to fear for his friends on the latter score. He was met by\na young man some years older than himself, who had on former occasions\nbeen but too happy to be permitted to share in his sports in the\nsubordinate character of his assistant. Ralph Fisher approached to greet\nhim, with all the alacrity of an humble friend.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat, Master Roland, abroad on this side, and without either hawk or\nhound?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHawk or hound,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will never perhaps hollo to again. I\nhave been dismissed--that is, I have left the castle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRalph was surprised. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat! you are to pass into the Knight's service,\nand take the black jack and the lance?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Roland Graeme, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not--I am now leaving the service\nof Avenel for ever.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd whither are you going, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young peasant.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, that is a question which it craves time to answer--I have that\nmatter to determine yet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the disgraced favourite.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, nay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ralph, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI warrant you it is the same to you which way\nyou go--my Lady would not dismiss you till she had put some lining into\nthe pouches of your doublet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSordid slave!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdost thou think I would have\naccepted a boon from one who was giving me over a prey to detraction\nand to ruin, at the instigation of a canting priest and a meddling\nserving-woman? The bread that I had bought with such an alms would have\nchoked me at the first mouthful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRalph looked at his quondam friend with an air of wonder not\nunmixed with contempt. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, at length, \u00e2\u0080\u009cno occasion for\npassion--each man knows his own stomach best--but, were I on a black\nmoor at this time of day, not knowing whither I was going, I should\nbe glad to have a broad piece or two in my pouch, come by them as I\ncould.--But perhaps you will go with me to my father's--that is, for a\nnight, for to-morrow we expect my uncle Menelaus and all his folk; but,\nas I said, for one night----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe cold-blooded limitation of the offered shelter to one night only,\nand that tendered most unwillingly, offended the pride of the discarded\nfavourite.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would rather sleep on the fresh heather, as I have done many a night\non less occasion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthan in the smoky garret of your\nfather, that smells of peat smoke and usquebaugh like a Highlander's\nplaid.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may choose, my master, if you are so nice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Ralph Fisher;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cyou may be glad to smell a peat-fire, and usquebaugh too, if you\njourney long in the fashion you propose. You might have said God-a-mercy\nfor your proffer, though--it is not every one that will put themselves\nin the way of ill-will by harbouring a discarded serving-man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRalph,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would pray you to remember that I have\nswitched you before now, and this is the same riding-wand which you have\ntasted.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRalph, who was a thickset clownish figure, arrived at his full strength,\nand conscious of the most complete personal superiority, laughed\ncontemptuously at the threats of the slight-made stripling.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt may be the same wand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut not the same hand; and that is\nas good rhyme as if it were in a ballad. Look you, my Lady's page\nthat was, when your switch was up, it was no fear of you, but of\nyour betters, that kept mine down--and I wot not what hinders me from\nclearing old scores with this hazel rung, and showing you it was your\nLady's livery-coat which I spared, and not your flesh and blood, Master\nRoland.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn the midst of his rage, Roland Graeme was just wise enough to see,\nthat by continuing this altercation, he would subject himself to very\nrude treatment from the boor, who was so much older and stronger than\nhimself; and while his antagonist, with a sort of jeering laugh of\ndefiance, seemed to provoke the contest, he felt the full bitterness of\nhis own degraded condition, and burst into a passion of tears, which he\nin vain endeavoured to conceal with both his hands.\n\nEven the rough churl was moved with the distress of his quondam\ncompanion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, Master Roland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI did but as 'twere jest with thee--I\nwould not harm thee, man, were it but for old acquaintance sake. But\never look to a man's inches ere you talk of switching--why, thine arm,\nman, is but like a spindle compared to mine.--But hark, I hear old Adam\nWoodcock hollowing to his hawk--Come along, man, we will have a merry\nafternoon, and go jollily to my father's in spite of the peat-smoke and\nusquebaugh to boot. Maybe we may put you into some honest way of winning\nyour bread, though it's hard to come by in these broken times.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe unfortunate page made no answer, nor did he withdraw his hands from\nhis face, and Fisher continued in what he imagined a suitable tone of\ncomfort.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, man, when you were my Lady's minion, men held you proud, and some\nthought you a Papist, and I wot not what; and so, now that you have no\none to bear you out, you must be companionable and hearty, and wait on\nthe minister's examinations, and put these things out of folk's head;\nand if he says you are in fault, you must jouk your head to the stream;\nand if a gentleman, or a gentleman's gentleman, give you a rough word,\nor a light blow, you must only say, thank you for dusting my doublet, or\nthe like, as I have done by you.--But hark to Woodcock's whistle again.\nCome, and I will teach you all the trick on't as we go on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thank you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme, endeavouring to assume an air of\nindifference and of superiority; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I have another path before me, and\nwere it otherwise, I could not tread in yours.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery true, Master Roland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the clown; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand every man knows his\nown matters best, and so I will not keep you from the path, as you say.\nGive us a grip of your hand, man, for auld lang syne.--What! not clap\npalms ere we part?--well, so be it--a wilful man will have his way, and\nso farewell, and the blessing of the morning to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-morrow--good-morrow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, hastily; and the clown walked\nlightly off, whistling as he went, and glad, apparently, to be rid of an\nacquaintance, whose claims might be troublesome, and who had no longer\nthe means to be serviceable to him.\n\nRoland Graeme compelled himself to walk on while they were within sight\nof each other that his former intimate might not augur any vacillation\nof purpose, or uncertainty of object, from his remaining on the same\nspot; but the effort was a painful one. He seemed stunned, as it were,\nand giddy; the earth on which he stood felt as if unsound, and quaking\nunder his feet like the surface of a bog; and he had once or twice\nnearly fallen, though the path he trode was of firm greensward. He kept\nresolutely moving forward, in spite of the internal agitation to which\nthese symptoms belonged, until the distant form of his acquaintance\ndisappeared behind the slope of a hill, when his heart failed at once;\nand, sitting down on the turf, remote from human ken, he gave way to\nthe natural expressions of wounded pride, grief, and fear, and wept with\nunrestrained profusion and unqualified bitterness.\n\nWhen the first violent paroxysm of his feelings had subsided, the\ndeserted and friendless youth felt that mental relief which usually\nfollows such discharges of sorrow. The tears continued to chase each\nother down his cheeks, but they were no longer accompanied by the same\nsense of desolation; an afflicting yet milder sentiment was awakened\nin his mind, by the recollection of his benefactress, of the unwearied\nkindness which had attached her to him, in spite of many acts of\nprovoking petulance, now recollected as offences of a deep dye, which\nhad protected him against the machinations of others, as well as against\nthe consequences of his own folly, and would have continued to do so,\nhad not the excess of his presumption compelled her to withdraw her\nprotection.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhatever indignity I have borne,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009chas been the just reward of\nmy own ingratitude. And have I done well to accept the hospitality, the\nmore than maternal kindness, of my protectress, yet to detain from her\nthe knowledge of my religion?--but she shall know that a Catholic has\nas much gratitude as a Puritan--that I have been thoughtless, but not\nwicked--that in my wildest moments I have loved, respected, and honoured\nher--and that the orphan boy might indeed be heedless, but was never\nungrateful!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe turned, as these thoughts passed through his mind, and began hastily\nto retread his footsteps towards the castle. But he checked the first\neagerness of his repentant haste, when he reflected on the scorn and\ncontempt with which the family were likely to see the return of\nthe fugitive, humbled, as they must necessarily suppose him, into a\nsupplicant, who requested pardon for his fault, and permission to return\nto his service. He slackened his pace, but he stood not still.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI care not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he resolutely determined; \u00e2\u0080\u009clet them wink, point, nod,\nsneer, speak of the conceit which is humbled, of the pride which has had\na fall--I care not; it is a penance due to my folly, and I will endure\nit with patience. But if she also, my benefactress, if she also should\nthink me sordid and weak-spirited enough to beg, not for her pardon\nalone, but for a renewal of the advantages which I derived from her\nfavour--_her_ suspicion of my meanness I cannot--I will not brook.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe stood still, and his pride rallying with constitutional obstinacy\nagainst his more just feeling, urged that he would incur the scorn of\nthe Lady of Avenel, rather than obtain her favour, by following the\ncourse which the first ardour of his repentant feelings had dictated to\nhim.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I had but some plausible pretext,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he thought, \u00e2\u0080\u009csome ostensible\nreason for my return, some excuse to allege which might show I came not\nas a degraded supplicant, or a discarded menial, I might go thither--but\nas I am, I cannot--my heart would leap from its place and burst.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs these thoughts swept through his mind, something passed in the air\nso near him as to dazzle his eyes, and almost to brush the plume in his\ncap. He looked up--it was the favourite falcon of Sir Halbert, which,\nflying around his head, seemed to claim his attention, as that of a\nwell-known friend. Roland extended his arm, and gave the accustomed\nwhoop, and the falcon instantly settled on his wrist, and began to prune\nitself, glancing at the youth from time to time an acute and brilliant\nbeam of its hazel eye, which seemed to ask why he caressed it not with\nhis usual fondness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, Diamond!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, as if the bird understood him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthou and I must\nbe strangers henceforward. Many a gallant stoop have I seen thee make,\nand many a brave heron strike down; but that is all gone and over, and\nthere is no hawking more for me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd why not, Master Roland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Adam Woodcock the falconer, who came\nat that instant from behind a few alder bushes which had concealed him\nfrom view, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy should there be no more hawking for you? Why, man, what\nwere our life without our sports?--thou know'st the jolly old song--\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd rather would Allan in dungeon lie,\n  Than live at large where the falcon cannot fly;\n  And Allan would rather lie in Sexton's pound,\n  Than live where he followed not the merry hawk and hound.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe voice of the falconer was hearty and friendly, and the tone in which\nhe half-sung half-recited his rude ballad, implied honest frankness\nand cordiality. But remembrance of their quarrel, and its consequences,\nembarrassed Roland, and prevented his reply. The falconer saw his\nhesitation, and guessed the cause.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster Roland? do you, who are half an Englishman,\nthink that I, who am a whole one, would keep up anger against you,\nand you in distress? That were like some of the Scots, (my master's\nreverence always excepted,) who can be fair and false, and wait their\ntime, and keep their mind, as they say, to themselves, and touch pot and\nflagon with you, and hunt and hawk with you, and, after all, when\ntime serves, pay off some old feud with the point of the dagger. Canny\nYorkshire has no memory for such old sores. Why, man, an you had hit me\na rough blow, maybe I would rather have taken it from you, than a rough\nword from another; for you have a good notion of falconry, though you\nstand up for washing the meat for the eyases. So give us your hand, man,\nand bear no malice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland, though he felt his proud blood rebel at the familiarity of\nhonest Adam's address, could not resist its downright frankness.\nCovering his face with the one hand, he held out the other to the\nfalconer, and returned with readiness his friendly grasp.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, this is hearty now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Woodcock; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI always said you had a kind\nheart, though you have a spice of the devil in your disposition, that is\ncertain. I came this way with the falcon on purpose to find you, and yon\nhalf-bred lubbard told me which way you took flight. You ever thought\ntoo much of that kestril-kite, Master Roland, and he knows nought of\nsport after all, but what he caught from you. I saw how it had been\nbetwixt you, and I sent him out of my company with a wanion--I would\nrather have a rifler on my perch than a false knave at my elbow--and\nnow, Master Roland, tell me what way wing ye?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is as God pleases,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the page, with a sigh which he could\nnot suppress.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, man, never droop a feather for being cast off,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the falconer;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwho knows but you may soar the better and fairer flight for all this\nyet?--Look at Diamond there, 'tis a noble bird, and shows gallantly\nwith his hood, and bells, and jesses; but there is many a wild falcon\nin Norway that would not change properties with him--And that is what\nI would say of you. You are no longer my Lady's page, and you will\nnot clothe so fair, or feed so well, or sleep so soft, or show so\ngallant--What of all that? if you are not her page, you are your own\nman, and may go where you will, without minding whoop or whistle. The\nworst is the loss of the sport, but who knows what you may come to? They\nsay that Sir Halbert himself, I speak with reverence, was once glad to\nbe the Abbot's forester, and now he has hounds and hawks of his own, and\nAdam Woodcock for a falconer to the boot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are right, and say well, Adam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the youth, the blood\nmantling in his cheeks, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe falcon will soar higher without his bells\nthan with them, though the bells be made of silver.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is cheerily spoken,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the falconer; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand whither now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought of going to the Abbey of Kennaquhair,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Roland\nGraeme, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto ask the counsel of Father Ambrose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd joy go with you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the falconer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthough it is likely you may\nfind the old monks in some sorrow; they say the commons are threatening\nto turn them out of their cells, and make a devil's mass of it in the\nold church, thinking they have forborne that sport too long; and troth I\nam clear of the same opinion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen will Father Ambrose be the better of having a friend beside him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said the page, manfully.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, but, my young fearnought,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the falconer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe friend will\nscarce be the better of being beside Father Ambrose--he may come by the\nredder's lick, and that is ever the worst of the battle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI care not for that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe dread of a lick should not\nhold me back; but I fear I may bring trouble between the brothers by\nvisiting Father Ambrose. I will tarry to-night at Saint Cuthbert's cell,\nwhere the old priest will give me a night's shelter; and I will send to\nFather Ambrose to ask his advice before I go down to the convent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy Our Lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the falconer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand that is a likely plan--and now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n he continued, exchanging his frankness of manner for a sort of awkward\nembarrassment, as if he had somewhat to say that he had no ready means\nto bring out--\u00e2\u0080\u009cand now, you wot well that I wear a pouch for my hawk's\nmeat, [Footnote: This same hag, like every thing belonging to falconry,\nwas esteemed an honourable distinction, and worn often by the nobility\nand gentry. One of the Sommervilles of Camnethan was called _Sir John\nwith the red bag_, because it was his wont to wear his hawking pouch\ncovered with satin of that colour.] and so forth; but wot you what it is\nlined with, Master Roland?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith leather, to be sure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Roland, somewhat surprised at the\nhesitation with which Adam Woodcock asked a question apparently so\nsimple.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith leather, lad?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Woodcock; \u00e2\u0080\u009cay, and with silver to the boot of\nthat. See here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, showing a secret slit in the lining of his bag\nof office--\u00e2\u0080\u009chere they are, thirty good Harry groats as ever were struck\nin bluff old Hal's time, and ten of them are right heartily at your\nservice; and now the murder is out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland's first idea was to refuse his assistance; but he recollected the\nvows of humility which he had just taken upon him, and it occurred that\nthis was the opportunity to put his new-formed resolution to the test.\nAssuming a strong command of himself, he answered Adam Woodcock with as\nmuch frankness as his nature permitted him to wear, in doing what was\nso contrary to his inclinations, that he accepted thankfully of his\nkind offer, while, to soothe his own reviving pride, he could not help\nadding, \u00e2\u0080\u009che hoped soon to requite the obligation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat as you list--that as you list, young man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the falconer, with\nglee, counting out and delivering to his young friend the supply he had\nso generously offered, and then adding, with great cheerfulness,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow\nyou may go through the world; for he that can back a horse, wind a horn,\nhollow a greyhound, fly a hawk, and play at sword and buckler, with a\nwhole pair of shoes, a green jacket, and ten lily-white groats in his\npouch, may bid Father Care hang himself in his own jesses. Farewell, and\nGod be with you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, and as if desirous to avoid the thanks of his companion,\nhe turned hastily round, and left Roland Graeme to pursue his journey\nalone.\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Eight.\n\n\n  The sacred tapers lights are gone.\n  Gray moss has clad the altar stone,\n  The holy image is o'erthrown,\n    The bell has ceased to toll,\n  The long ribb'd aisles are burst and shrunk,\n  The holy shrines to ruin sunk,\n  Departed is the pious monk,\n    God's blessing on his soul!\n                             REDIVIVA.\n\nThe cell of Saint Cuthbert, as it was called, marked, or was supposed\nto mark, one of those resting-places, which that venerable saint was\npleased to assign to his monks, when his convent, being driven from\nLindisfern by the Danes, became a peripatetic society of religionists,\nand bearing their patron's body on their shoulders, transported him from\nplace to place through Scotland and the borders of England, until he was\npleased at length to spare them the pain of carrying him farther, and\nto choose his ultimate place of rest in the lordly towers of Durham.\nThe odour of his sanctity remained behind him at each place where he had\ngranted the monks a transient respite from their labours; and proud were\nthose who could assign, as his temporary resting-place, any spot within\ntheir vicinity. There were few cells more celebrated and honoured\nthan that of Saint Cuthbert, to which Roland Graeme now bent his\nway, situated considerably to the north-west of the great Abbey of\nKennaquhair, on which it was dependent. In the neighbourhood were some\nof those recommendations which weighed with the experienced priesthood\nof Rome, in choosing their sites for places of religion.\n\nThere was a well, possessed of some medicinal qualities, which, of\ncourse, claimed the saint for its guardian and patron, and occasionally\nproduced some advantage to the recluse who inhabited his cell, since\nnone could reasonably expect to benefit by the fountain who did not\nextend their bounty to the saint's chaplain. A few rods of fertile land\nafforded the monk his plot of garden ground; an eminence well clothed\nwith trees rose behind the cell, and sheltered it from, the north and\nthe east, while the front, opening to the south-west, looked up a wild\nbut pleasant valley, down which wandered a lively brook, which battled\nwith every stone that interrupted its passage.\n\nThe cell itself was rather plainly than rudely constructed--a low Gothic\nbuilding with two small apartments, one of which served the priest for\nhis dwelling-place, the other for his chapel. As there were few of\nthe secular clergy who durst venture to reside so near the Border, the\nassistance of this monk in spiritual affairs had not been useless to the\ncommunity, while the Catholic religion retained the ascendancy; as he\ncould marry, christen, and administer the other sacraments of the Roman\nchurch. Of late, however, as the Protestant doctrines gained ground, he\nhad found it convenient to live in close retirement, and to avoid, as\nmuch as possible, drawing upon himself observation or animadversion. The\nappearance of his habitation, however, when Roland Graeme came before\nit in the close of the evening, plainly showed that his caution had been\nfinally ineffectual.\n\nThe page's first movement was to knock at the door, when he observed,\nto his surprise, that it was open, not from being left unlatched, but\nbecause, beat off its upper hinge, it was only fastened to the door-post\nby the lower, and could therefore no longer perform its functions.\nSomewhat alarmed at this, and receiving no answer when he knocked and\ncalled, Roland began to look more at leisure upon the exterior of the\nlittle dwelling before he ventured to enter it. The flowers, which had\nbeen trained with care against the walls, seemed to have been recently\ntorn down, and trailed their dishonoured garlands on the earth; the\nlatticed window was broken and dashed in. The garden, which the monk had\nmaintained by his constant labour in the highest order and beauty, bore\nmarks of having been lately trod down and destroyed by the hoofs of\nanimals, and the feet of men.\n\nThe sainted spring had not escaped. It was wont to rise beneath a canopy\nof ribbed arches, with which the devotion of elder times had secured\nand protected its healing waters. These arches were now almost entirely\ndemolished, and the stones of which they were built were tumbled\ninto the well, as if for the purpose of choking up and destroying the\nfountain, which, as it had shared in other days the honour of the saint,\nwas, in the present, doomed to partake his unpopularity. Part of the\nroof had been pulled down from the house itself, and an attempt had\nbeen made with crows and levers upon one of the angles, by which several\nlarge corner-stones had been forced out of their place; but the solidity\nof ancient mason-work had proved too great for the time or patience of\nthe assailants, and they had relinquished their task of destruction.\nSuch dilapidated buildings, after the lapse of years, during which\nnature has gradually covered the effects of violence with creeping\nplants, and with weather-stains, exhibit, amid their decay, a melancholy\nbeauty. But when the visible effects of violence appear raw and recent,\nthere is no feeling to mitigate the sense of devastation with which they\nimpress the spectators; and such was now the scene on which the youthful\npage gazed, with the painful feelings it was qualified to excite.\n\nWhen his first momentary surprise was over, Roland Graeme was at no loss\nto conjecture the cause of these ravages. The destruction of the\nPopish edifices did not take place at once throughout Scotland, but at\ndifferent times, and according to the spirit which actuated the\nreformed clergy; some of whom instigated their hearers to these acts of\ndemolition, and others, with better taste and feeling, endeavoured to\nprotect the ancient shrines, while they desired to see them purified\nfrom the objects which had attracted idolatrous devotion. From time to\ntime, therefore, the populace of the Scottish towns and villages,\nwhen instigated either by their own feelings of abhorrence for Popish\nsuperstition, or by the doctrines of the more zealous preachers, resumed\nthe work of destruction, and exercised it upon some sequestered church,\nchapel, or cell, which had escaped the first burst of their indignation\nagainst the religion of Rome. In many places, the vices of the Catholic\nclergy, arising out of the wealth and the corruption of that tremendous\nhierarchy, furnished too good an apology for wreaking vengeance upon\nthe splendid edifices which they inhabited; and of this an old Scottish\nhistorian gives a remarkable instance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy mourn ye,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said an aged matron, seeing the discontent of some of\nthe citizens, while a stately convent was burnt by the multitude,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy\nmourn ye for its destruction? If you knew half the flagitious wickedness\nwhich has been perpetrated within that house, you would rather bless\nthe divine judgment, which permits not even the senseless walls that\nscreened such profligacy, any longer to cumber Christian ground.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut although, in many instances, the destruction of the Roman Catholic\nbuildings might be, in the matron's way of judging, an act of justice,\nand in others an act of policy, there is no doubt that the humour of\ndemolishing monuments of ancient piety and munificence, and that in a\npoor country like Scotland, where there was no chance of their being\nreplaced, was both useless, mischievous, and barbarous.\n\nIn the present instance, the unpretending and quiet seclusion of the\nmonk of Saint Cuthbert's had hitherto saved him from the general\nwreck; but it would seem ruin had now at length reached him. Anxious to\ndiscover if he had at least escaped personal harm, Roland Graeme entered\nthe half ruined cell.\n\nThe interior of the building was in a state which fully justified the\nopinion he had formed from its external injuries. The few rude utensils\nof the solitary's hut were broken down, and lay scattered on the floor,\nwhere it seemed as if a fire had been made with some of the fragments\nto destroy the rest of his property, and to consume, in particular, the\nrude old image of Saint Cuthbert, in its episcopal habit, which lay on\nthe hearth like Dagon of yore, shattered with the axe and scorched with\nthe flames, but only partially destroyed. In the little apartment which\nserved as a chapel, the altar was overthrown, and the four huge stones\nof which it had been once composed lay scattered around the floor. The\nlarge stone crucifix which occupied the niche behind the altar, and\nfronted the supplicant while he paid his devotion there, had been pulled\ndown and dashed by its own weight into three fragments. There were marks\nof sledge-hammers on each of these; yet the image had been saved from\nutter demolition by the size and strength of the remaining fragments,\nwhich, though much injured, retained enough of the original sculpture to\nshow what it had been intended to represent.\n\n[Footnote: I may here observe, that this is entirely an ideal scene.\nSaint Cuthbert, a person of established sanctity, had, no doubt, several\nplaces of worship on the Borders, where he flourished whilst living;\nbut Tillmouth Chapel is the only one which bears some resemblance to\nthe hermitage described in the text. It has, indeed, a well, famous\nfor gratifying three wishes for every worshipper who shall quaff the\nfountain with sufficient belief in its efficacy. At this spot the Saint\nis said to have landed in his stone coffin, in which he sailed down the\nTweed from Melrose and here the stone coffin long lay, in evidence of\nthe fact. The late Sir Francis Blake Delaval is said to have taken the\nexact measure of the coffin, and to have ascertained, by hydrostatic\nprinciples, that it might have actually swum. A profane farmer in the\nneighborhood announced his intention of converting this last bed of\nthe Saint into a trough for his swine; but the profanation was rendered\nimpossible, either by the Saint, or by some pious votary in his behalf,\nfor on the following morning the stone sarcophargus was found broken in\ntwo fragments.\n\nTillmouth Chapel, with these points of resemblance, lies, however, in\nexactly the opposite direction as regards Melrose, which the supposed\ncell of St. Cuthbert is said to have borne towards Kennaquhair.]\n\nRoland Graeme, secretly nursed in the tenets of Rome, saw with horror\nthe profanation of the most sacred emblem, according to his creed, of\nour holy religion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is the badge of our redemption,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich the felons have\ndared to violate--would to God my weak strength were able to replace\nit--my humble strength, to atone for the sacrilege!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe stooped to the task he first meditated, and with a sudden, and to\nhimself almost an incredible exertion of power, he lifted up the one\nextremity of the lower shaft of the cross, and rested it upon the edge\nof the large stone which served for its pedestal. Encouraged by this\nsuccess, he applied his force to the other extremity, and, to his own\nastonishment, succeeded so far as to erect the lower end of the limb\ninto the socket, out of which it had been forced, and to place this\nfragment of the image upright.\n\nWhile he was employed in this labour, or rather at the very moment when\nhe had accomplished the elevation of the fragment, a voice, in thrilling\nand well-known accents, spoke behind him these words:--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell done,\nthou good and faithful servant! Thus would I again meet the child of my\nlove--the hope of my aged eyes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland turned round in astonishment, and the tall commanding form of\nMagdalen Graeme stood beside him. She was arrayed in a sort of loose\nhabit, in form like that worn by penitents in Catholic countries, but\nblack in colour, and approaching as near to a pilgrim's cloak as it was\nsafe to wear in a country where the suspicion of Catholic devotion\nin many places endangered the safety of those who were suspected of\nattachment to the ancient faith. Roland Graeme threw himself at her\nfeet. She raised and embraced him, with affection indeed, but not\nunmixed with gravity which amounted almost to sternness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThou hast kept well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe bird in thy bosom. [Footnote: An\nexpression used by Sir Ralph Percy, slain in the battle of Hedgly-moor\nin 1464, when dying, to express his having preserved unstained his\nfidelity to the house of Lancaster.] As a boy, as a youth, thou hast\nheld fast thy faith amongst heretics--thou hast kept thy secret and mine\nown amongst thine enemies. I wept when I parted from you--I who seldom\nweep, then shed tears, less for thy death than for thy spiritual\ndanger--I dared not even see thee to bid thee a last farewell--my grief,\nmy swelling grief, had betrayed me to these heretics. But thou hast been\nfaithful--down, down on thy knees before the holy sign, which evil men\ninjure and blaspheme; down, and praise saints and angels for the grace\nthey have done thee, in preserving thee from the leprous plague which\ncleaves to the house in which thou wert nurtured.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf, my mother--so I must ever call you\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Graeme,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cif I am\nreturned such as thou wouldst wish me, thou must thank the care of the\npious father Ambrose, whose instructions confirmed your early precepts,\nand taught me at once to be faithful and to be silent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe he blessed for it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she; \u00e2\u0080\u009cblessed in the cell and in the field,\nin the pulpit and at the altar--the saints rain blessings on him!--they\nare just, and employ his pious care to counteract the evils which his\ndetested brother works against the realm and the church,--but he knew\nnot of thy lineage?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI could not myself tell him that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Roland. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI knew but darkly\nfrom your words, that Sir Halbert Glendinning holds mine inheritance,\nand that I am of blood as noble as runs in the veins of any Scottish\nBaron--these are things not to be forgotten, but for the explanation I\nmust now look to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd when time suits, thou shalt not look for it in vain. But men say,\nmy son, that thou art bold and sudden; and those who bear such tempers\nare not lightly to be trusted with what will strongly move them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSay rather, my mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d returned Roland Graeme, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I am laggard and\ncold-blooded--what patience or endurance can you require of which _he_\nis not capable, who for years has heard his religion ridiculed and\ninsulted, yet failed to plunge his dagger into the blasphemer's bosom!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe contented, my child,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Magdalen Graeme; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe time, which then\nand even now demands patience, will soon ripen to that of effort and\naction--great events are on the wing, and thou,--thou shalt have thy\nshare in advancing them. Thou hast relinquished the service of the Lady\nof Avenel?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have been dismissed from it, my mother--I have lived to be dismissed,\nas if I were the meanest of the train.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is the better, my child,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied she; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthy mind will be the more\nhardened to undertake that which must be performed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet it be nothing, then, against the Lady of Avenel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cas thy look and words seem to imply. I have eaten her bread--I have\nexperienced her favour--I will neither injure nor betray her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf that hereafter, my son,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut learn this, that it is not\nfor thee to capitulate in thy duty, and to say this will I do, and that\nwill I leave undone--No, Roland! God and man will no longer abide the\nwickedness of this generation. Seest thou these fragments--knowest\nthou what they represent?--and canst thou think it is for thee to make\ndistinctions amongst a race so accursed by Heaven, that they renounce,\nviolate, blaspheme, and destroy, whatsoever we are commanded to believe\nin, whatsoever we are commanded to reverence?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs she spoke, she bent her head towards the broken image, with a\ncountenance in which strong resentment and zeal were mingled with an\nexpression of ecstatic devotion; she raised her left hand aloft as\nin the act of making a vow, and thus proceeded; \u00e2\u0080\u009cBear witness for me,\nblessed symbol of our salvation, bear witness, holy saint, within whose\nviolated temple we stand, that as it is not for vengeance of my own\nthat my hate pursues these people, so neither, for any favour or earthly\naffection towards any amongst them, will I withdraw my hand from the\nplough, when it shall pass through the devoted furrow! Bear witness,\nholy saint, once thyself a wanderer and fugitive as we are now--bear\nwitness, Mother of Mercy, Queen of Heaven--bear witness, saints and\nangels!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn this high train of enthusiasm, she stood, raising her eyes through\nthe fractured roof of the vault, to the stars which now began to twinkle\nthrough the pale twilight, while the long gray tresses which hung\ndown over her shoulders waved in the night-breeze, which the chasm and\nfractured windows admitted freely.\n\nRoland Graeme was too much awed by early habits, as well as by the\nmysterious import of her words, to ask for farther explanation of the\npurpose she obscurely hinted at. Nor did she farther press him on the\nsubject; for, having concluded her prayer or obtestation, by clasping\nher hands together with solemnity, and then signing herself with the\ncross, she again addressed her grandson, in a tone more adapted to the\nordinary business of life.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThou must hence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRoland, thou must hence, but not till\nmorning--And now, how wilt thou shift for thy night's quarters?--thou\nhast been more softly bred than when we were companions in the misty\nhills of Cumberland and Liddesdale.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have at least preserved, my good mother, the habits which I then\nlearned--can lie hard, feed sparingly, and think it no hardship. Since I\nwas a wanderer with thee on the hills, I have been a hunter, and fisher,\nand fowler, and each of these is accustomed to sleep freely in a worse\nshelter than sacrilege has left us here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThan sacrilege has left us here!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the matron, repeating his words,\nand pausing on them. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMost true, my son; and God's faithful children are\nnow worst sheltered, when they lodge in God's own house and the demesne\nof his blessed saints. We shall sleep cold here, under the nightwind,\nwhich whistles through the breaches which heresy has made. They shall\nlie warmer who made them--ay, and through a long hereafter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNotwithstanding the wild and singular expression of this female, she\nappeared to retain towards Roland Graeme, in a strong degree, that\naffectionate and sedulous love which women bear to their nurslings,\nand the children dependent on their care. It seemed as if she would not\npermit him to do aught for himself which in former days her attention\nhad been used to do for him, and that she considered the tall stripling\nbefore her as being equally dependent on her careful attention as\nwhen he was the orphan child, who had owed all to her affectionate\nsolicitude.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat hast thou to eat now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, as, leaving the chapel, they went\ninto the deserted habitation of the priest; \u00e2\u0080\u009cor what means of kindling\na fire, to defend thee from this raw and inclement air? Poor child! thou\nhast made slight provision for a long journey; nor hast thou skill to\nhelp thyself by wit, when means are scanty. But Our Lady has placed by\nthy side one to whom want, in all its forms, is as familiar as plenty\nand splendour have formerly been. And with want, Roland, come the arts\nof which she is the inventor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith an active and officious diligence, which strangely contrasted with\nher late abstracted and high tone of Catholic devotion, she set about\nher domestic arrangements for the evening. A pouch, which was hidden\nunder her garment, produced a flint and steel, and from the scattered\nfragments around (those pertaining to the image of Saint Cuthbert\nscrupulously excepted) she obtained splinters sufficient to raise a\nsparkling and cheerful fire on the hearth of the deserted cell.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor needful food.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThink not of it, mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cunless you yourself feel\nhunger. It is a little thing for me to endure a night's abstinence, and\na small atonement for the necessary transgression of the rules of the\nChurch upon which I was compelled during my stay in the castle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHunger for myself!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the matron--\u00e2\u0080\u009cKnow, youth, that a mother\nknows not hunger till that of her child is satisfied.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And with\naffectionate inconsistency, totally different from her usual manner, she\nadded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRoland, you must not fast; you have dispensation; you are young,\nand to youth food and sleep are necessaries not to be dispensed with.\nHusband your strength, my child,--your sovereign, your religion, your\ncountry, require it. Let age macerate by fast and vigil a body which can\nonly suffer; let youth, in these active times, nourish the limbs and the\nstrength which action requires.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhile she thus spoke, the scrip, which had produced the means of\nstriking fire, furnished provision for a meal; of which she herself\nscarce partook, but anxiously watched her charge, taking a pleasure,\nresembling that of an epicure, in each morsel which he swallowed with a\nyouthful appetite which abstinence had rendered unusually sharp. Roland\nreadily obeyed her recommendations, and ate the food which she so\naffectionately and earnestly placed before him. But she shook her head\nwhen invited by him in return to partake of the refreshment her own\ncares had furnished; and when his solicitude became more pressing, she\nrefused him in a loftier tone of rejection.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYoung man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou know not to whom or of what you speak. They\nto whom Heaven declares its purpose must merit its communication by\nmortifying the senses; they have that within which requires not the\nsuperfluity of earthly nutriment, which is necessary to those who are\nwithout the sphere of the Vision. To them the watch spent in prayer is\na refreshing slumber, and the sense of doing the will of Heaven is a\nricher banquet than the tables of monarchs can spread before them!--But\ndo thou sleep soft, my son,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, relapsing from the tone of\nfanaticism into that of maternal affection and tenderness; \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo thou\nsleep sound while life is but young with thee, and the cares of the day\ncan be drowned in the slumbers of the evening. Different is thy duty and\nmine, and as different the means by which we must qualify and strengthen\nourselves to perform it. From thee is demanded strength of body--from\nme, strength of soul.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen she thus spoke, she prepared with ready address a pallet-couch,\ncomposed partly of the dried leaves which had once furnished a bed to\nthe solitary, and the guests who occasionally received his hospitality,\nand which, neglected by the destroyers of his humble cell, had remained\nlittle disturbed in the corner allotted for them. To these her care\nadded some of the vestures which lay torn and scattered on the floor.\nWith a zealous hand she selected all such as appeared to have made\nany part of the sacerdotal vestments, laying them aside as sacred\nfrom ordinary purposes, and with the rest she made, with dexterous\npromptness, such a bed as a weary man might willingly stretch himself\non; and during the time she was preparing it, rejected, even with\nacrimony, any attempt which the youth made to assist her, or any\nentreaty which he urged, that she would accept of the place of rest for\nher own use. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSleep thou,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRoland Graeme, sleep thou--the\npersecuted, the disinherited orphan--the son of an ill-fated\nmother--sleep thou! I go to pray in the chapel beside thee.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe manner was too enthusiastically earnest, too obstinately firm, to\npermit Roland Graeme to dispute her will any farther. Yet he felt some\nshame in giving way to it. It seemed as if she had forgotten the years\nthat had passed away since their parting; and expected to meet, in the\ntall, indulged, and wilful youth, whom she had recovered, the passive\nobedience of the child whom she had left in the Castle of Avenel. This\ndid not fail to hurt her grandson's characteristic and constitutional\npride. He obeyed, indeed, awed into submission by the sudden recurrence\nof former subordination, and by feelings of affection and gratitude.\nStill, however, he felt the yoke.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave I relinquished the hawk and the hound,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto become the\npupil of her pleasure, as if I were still a child?--I, whom even my\nenvious mates allowed to be superior in those exercises which they took\nmost pains to acquire, and which came to me naturally, as if a knowledge\nof them had been my birthright? This may not, and must not be. I will be\nno reclaimed sparrow-hawk, who is carried hooded on a woman's wrist,\nand has his quarry only shown to him when his eyes are uncovered for his\nflight. I will know her purpose ere it is proposed to me to aid it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThese, and other thoughts, streamed through the mind of Roland Graeme;\nand although wearied with the fatigues of the day, it was long ere he\ncould compose himself to rest.\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Ninth.\n\n\n  Kneel with me--swear it--'tis not in words I trust,\n  Save when they're fenced with an appeal to Heaven.\n                                   OLD PLAY\n\nAfter passing the night in that sound sleep for which agitation and\nfatigue had prepared him, Roland was awakened by the fresh morning\nair, and by the beams of the rising sun. His first feeling was that of\nsurprise; for, instead of looking forth from a turret window on the\nLake of Avenel, which was the prospect his former apartment afforded,\nan unlatticed aperture gave him the view of the demolished garden of the\nbanished anchorite. He sat up on his couch of leaves, and arranged in\nhis memory, not without wonder, the singular events of the preceding\nday, which appeared the more surprising the more he considered them.\nHe had lost the protectress of his youth, and, in the same day, he\nhad recovered the guide and guardian of his childhood. The former\ndeprivation he felt ought to be matter of unceasing regret, and\nit seemed as if the latter could hardly be the subject of unmixed\nself-congratulation. He remembered this person, who had stood to him in\nthe relation of a mother, as equally affectionate in her attention, and\nabsolute in her authority. A singular mixture of love and fear attended\nupon his early remembrances as they were connected with her; and the\nfear that she might desire to resume the same absolute control over\nhis motions--a fear which her conduct of yesterday did not tend much to\ndissipate--weighed heavily against the joy of this second meeting.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe cannot mean,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his rising pride, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto lead and direct me as\na pupil, when I am at the age of judging of my own actions?--this she\ncannot mean, or meaning it, will feel herself strangely deceived.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA sense of gratitude towards the person against whom his heart thus\nrebelled, checked his course of feeling. He resisted the thoughts which\ninvoluntarily arose in his mind, as he would have resisted an actual\ninstigation of the foul fiend; and, to aid him in his struggle, he felt\nfor his beads. But, in his hasty departure from the Castle of Avenel, he\nhad forgotten and left them behind him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is yet worse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut two things I learned of her under the\nmost deadly charge of secrecy--to tell my beads, and to conceal that I\ndid so; and I have kept my word till now; and when she shall ask me\nfor the rosary, I must say I have forgotten it! Do I deserve she should\nbelieve me when. I say I have kept the secret of my faith, when I set so\nlight by its symbol?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe paced the floor in anxious agitation. In fact, his attachment to\nhis faith was of a nature very different from that which animated the\nenthusiastic matron, but which, notwithstanding, it would have been his\nlast thought to relinquish.\n\nThe early charges impressed on him by his grandmother, had been\ninstilled into a mind and memory of a character peculiarly tenacious.\nChild as he was, he was proud of the confidence reposed in his\ndiscretion, and resolved to show that it had not been rashly intrusted\nto him. At the same time, his resolution was no more than that of\na child, and must, necessarily, have gradually faded away under the\noperation both of precept and example, during his residence at the\nCastle of Avenel, but for the exhortations of Father Ambrose, who, in\nhis lay estate, had been called Edward Glendinning. This zealous\nmonk had been apprized, by an unsigned letter placed in his hand by\na pilgrim, that a child educated in the Catholic faith was now in the\nCastle of Avenel, perilously situated, (so was the scroll expressed,)\nas ever the three children who were cast into the fiery furnace of\npersecution. The letter threw upon Father Ambrose the fault, should\nthis solitary lamb, unwillingly left within the demesnes of the prowling\nwolf, become his final prey. There needed no farther exhortation to the\nmonk than the idea that a soul might be endangered, and that a Catholic\nmight become an apostate; and he made his visits more frequent than\nusual to the castle of Avenel, lest, through want of the private\nencouragement and instruction which he always found some opportunity of\ndispensing, the church should lose a proselyte, and, according to the\nRomish creed, the devil acquire a soul.\n\nStill these interviews were rare; and though they encouraged the\nsolitary boy to keep his secret and hold fast his religion, they were\nneither frequent nor long enough to inspire him with any thing beyond\na blind attachment to the observances which the priest recommended. He\nadhered to the forms of his religion rather because he felt it would\nbe dishonourable to change that of his fathers, than from any rational\nconviction or sincere belief of its mysterious doctrines. It was a\nprincipal part of the distinction which, in his own opinion, singled him\nout from those with whom he lived, and gave him an additional, though an\ninternal and concealed reason, for contemning those of the household who\nshowed an undisguised dislike of him, and for hardening himself against\nthe instructions of the chaplain, Henry Warden.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe fanatic preacher,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he thought within himself, during some one\nof the chaplain's frequent discourses against the Church of Rome, \u00e2\u0080\u009che\nlittle knows whose ears are receiving his profane doctrine, and with\nwhat contempt and abhorrence they hear his blasphemies against the holy\nreligion by which kings have been crowned, and for which martyrs have\ndied!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut in such proud feelings of defiance of heresy, as it was termed, and\nof its professors, which associated the Catholic religion with a\nsense of generous independence, and that of the Protestants with the\nsubjugation of his mind and temper to the direction of Mr. Warden, began\nand ended the faith of Roland Graeme, who, independently of the pride of\nsingularity, sought not to understand, and had no one to expound to\nhim, the peculiarities of the tenets which he professed. His regret,\ntherefore, at missing the rosary which had been conveyed to him through\nthe hands of Father Ambrose, was rather the shame of a soldier who has\ndropped his cockade, or badge of service, than that of a zealous votary\nwho had forgotten a visible symbol of his religion.\n\nHis thoughts on the subject, however, were mortifying, and the more\nso from apprehension that his negligence must reach the ears of\nhis relative. He felt it could be no one but her who had secretly\ntransmitted these beads to Father Ambrose for his use, and that his\ncarelessness was but an indifferent requital of her kindness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNor will she omit to ask me about them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he to himself; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor hers\nis a zeal which age cannot quell; and if she has not quitted her wont,\nmy answer will not fail to incense her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhile he thus communed with himself, Magdalen Graeme entered the\napartment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe blessing of the morning on your youthful head, my son,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n she said, with a solemnity of expression which thrilled the youth to the\nheart, so sad and earnest did the benediction flow from her lips, in a\ntone where devotion was blended with affection. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd thou hast started\nthus early from thy couch to catch the first breath of the dawn? But it\nis not well, my Roland. Enjoy slumber while thou canst; the time is not\nfar behind when the waking eye must be thy portion, as well as mine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe uttered these words with an affectionate and anxious tone, which\nshowed, that devotional as were the habitual exercises of her mind, the\nthoughts of her nursling yet bound her to earth with the cords of human\naffection and passion.\n\nBut she abode not long in a mood which she probably regarded as a\nmomentary dereliction of her imaginary high calling--\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cyouth, up and be doing--It is time that we leave this place.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd whither do we go?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young man; \u00e2\u0080\u009cor what is the object of\nour journey?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe matron stepped back, and gazed on him with surprise, not unmingled\nwith displeasure.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo what purpose such a question?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cis it not enough that I\nlead the way? Hast thou lived with heretics till thou hast learned to\ninstal the vanity of thine own private judgment in place of due honour\nand obedience?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thought Roland Graeme within himself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis already come, when\nI must establish my freedom, or be a willing thrall for ever--I feel\nthat I must speedily look to it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe instantly fulfilled his foreboding, by recurring to the theme by\nwhich her thoughts seemed most constantly engrossed, although, when she\npleased, no one could so perfectly disguise her religion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThy beads, my son--hast thou told thy beads?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland Graeme coloured high; he felt the storm was approaching, but\nscorned to avert it by a falsehood.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have forgotten my rosary,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cat the Castle of Avenel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cForgotten thy rosary!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she exclaimed; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfalse both to religion and to\nnatural duty, hast thou lost what was sent so far, and at such risk, a\ntoken of the truest affection, that should have been, every bead of it,\nas dear to thee as thine eyeballs?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am grieved it should have so chanced, mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the youth,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cand much did I value the token, as coming from you. For what remains,\nI trust to win gold enough, when I push my way in the world; and till\nthen, beads of black oak, or a rosary of nuts, must serve the turn.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHear him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his grandmother; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyoung as he is, he hath learned\nalready the lessons of the devil's school! The rosary, consecrated by\nthe Holy Father himself, and sanctified by his blessing, is but a few\nknobs of gold, whose value may be replaced by the wages of his\nprofane labour, and whose virtue may be supplied by a string of\nhazel-nuts!--This is heresy--So Henry Warden, the wolf who ravages the\nflock of the Shepherd, hath taught thee to speak and to think.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am no heretic; I believe and I pray\naccording to the rules of our church--This misfortune I regret, but I\ncannot amend it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThou canst repent it, though,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied his spiritual directress,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009crepent it in dust and ashes, atone for it by fasting, prayer, and\npenance, instead of looking on me with a countenance as light as if thou\nhadst lost but a button from thy cap.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbe appeased; I will remember my fault in the\nnext confession which I have space and opportunity to make, and will\ndo whatever the priest may require of me in atonement. For the heaviest\nfault I can do no more.--But, mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, after a moment's pause,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009clet me not incur your farther displeasure, if I ask whither our journey\nis bound, and what is its object. I am no longer a child, but a man, and\nat my own disposal, with down upon my chin, and a sword by my side--I\nwill go to the end of the world with you to do your pleasure; but I owe\nit to myself to inquire the purpose and direction of our travels.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou owe it to yourself, ungrateful boy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied his relative,\npassion rapidly supplying the colour which age had long chased from her\nfeatures,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cto yourself you owe nothing--you can owe nothing--to me\nyou owe every thing--your life when an infant--your support while a\nchild--the means of instruction, and the hopes of honour--and, sooner\nthan thou shouldst abandon the noble cause to which I have devoted thee,\nwould I see thee lie a corpse at my feet!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland was alarmed at the vehement agitation with which she spoke,\nand which threatened to overpower her aged frame; and he hastened to\nreply,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI forget nothing of what I owe to you, my dearest mother--show\nme how my blood can testify my gratitude, and you shall judge if I spare\nit. But blindfold obedience has in it as little merit as reason.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSaints and angels!\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Magdalen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand do I hear these words from\nthe child of my hopes, the nursling by whose bed I have kneeled, and for\nwhose weal I have wearied every saint in heaven with prayers? Roland,\nby obedience only canst thou show thy affection and thy gratitude. What\navails it that you might perchance adopt the course I propose to thee,\nwere it to be fully explained? Thou wouldst not then follow my command,\nbut thine own judgment; thou wouldst not do the will of Heaven,\ncommunicated through thy best friend, to whom thou owest thine all; but\nthou wouldst observe the blinded dictates of thine own imperfect reason.\nHear me, Roland! a lot calls thee--solicits thee--demands thee--the\nproudest to which man can be destined, and it uses the voice of thine\nearliest, thy best, thine only friend--Wilt thou resist it? Then go\nthy way--leave me here--my hopes on earth are gone and withered--I will\nkneel me down before yonder profaned altar, and when the raging heretics\nreturn, they shall dye it with the blood of a martyr.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, my dearest mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme, whose early recollections\nof her violence were formidably renewed by these wild expressions of\nreckless passion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not forsake you--I will abide with you--worlds\nshall not force me from your side--I will protect--I will defend you--I\nwill live with you, and die for you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne word, my son, were worth all these--say only, 'I will obey you.'\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoubt it not, mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the youth, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will, and that with all my\nheart; only----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, I receive no qualifications of thy promise,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Magdalen Graeme,\ncatching at the word, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe obedience which I require is absolute; and\na blessing on thee, thou darling memory of my beloved child, that thou\nhast power to make a promise so hard to human pride! Trust me well, that\nin the design in which thou dost embark, thou hast for thy partners the\nmighty and the valiant, the power of the church, and the pride of the\nnoble. Succeed or fail, live or die, thy name shall be among those\nwith whom success or failure is alike glorious, death or life alike\ndesirable. Forward, then, forward! life is short, and our plan is\nlaborious--Angels, saints, and the whole blessed host of heaven, have\ntheir eyes even now on this barren and blighted land of Scotland--What\nsay I? on Scotland? their eye is on _us_, Roland--on the frail woman, on\nthe inexperienced youth, who, amidst the ruins which sacrilege hath made\nin the holy place, devote themselves to God's cause, and that of\ntheir lawful Sovereign. Amen, so be it! The blessed eyes of saints and\nmartyrs, which see our resolve, shall witness the execution; or their\nears, which hear our vow, shall hear our death-groan, drawn in the\nsacred cause!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhile thus speaking, she held Roland Graeme firmly with one hand, while\nshe pointed upward with the other, to leave him, as it were, no means of\nprotest against the obtestation to which he was thus made a party.\nWhen she had finished her appeal to Heaven, she left him no leisure for\nfarther hesitation, or for asking any explanation of her purpose; but\npassing with the same ready transition as formerly, to the solicitous\nattentions of an anxious parent, overwhelmed him with questions\nconcerning his residence in the Castle of Avenel, and the qualities and\naccomplishments he had acquired.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, when she had exhausted her inquiries, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy gay\ngoss-hawk\n\n[Footnote: The comparison is taken from some beautiful verses in an old\nballad, entitled Fause Foodrage, published in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMinstrelsy of the\nScottish Border.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A deposed queen, to preserve her infant son from\nthe traitors who have slain his father, exchanges him with the female\noffspring of a faithful friend, and goes on to direct the education of\nthe children, and the private signals by which the parents are to hear\nnews each of her own offspring.\n\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you shall learn my gay goss-hawk\n  Right well to breast a steed;\n  And so will I your turtle dow,\n  As well to write and read.\n\n  And ye shall learn my gay goss-hawk\n  To wield both bow and brand;\n  And so will I your turtle dow,\n  To lay gowd with her hand.\n\n  At kirk or market when we meet,\n  We'll dare make no avow,\n  But, 'Dame, how does my gay goss-hawk?'\n  'Madame, how does my dow?'\u00e2\u0080\u009d ]\n\nhath been well trained, and will soar high; but those who bred him will\nhave cause to fear as well as to wonder at his flight.--Let us now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto our morning meal, and care not though it be a scanty one. A\nfew hours' walk will bring us to more friendly quarters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey broke their fast accordingly, on such fragments as remained of\ntheir yesterday's provision, and immediately set out on their farther\njourney. Magdalen Graeme led the way, with a firm and active step much\nbeyond her years, and Roland Graeme followed, pensive and anxious, and\nfar from satisfied with the state of dependence to which he seemed again\nto be reduced.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAm I for ever,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to himself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto be devoured with the desire\nof independence and free agency, and yet to be for ever led on, by\ncircumstances, to follow the will of others?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Tenth.\n\n\n  She dwelt unnoticed and alone,\n    Beside the springs of Dove:\n  A maid whom there was none to praise,\n    And very few to love.\n                        WORDSWORTH.\n\nIn the course of their journey the travellers spoke little to each\nother. Magdalen Graeme chanted, from time to time, in a low voice, a\npart of some one of those beautiful old Latin hymns which belong to the\nCatholic service, muttered an Ave or a Credo, and so passed on, lost in\ndevotional contemplation. The meditations of her grandson were more\nbent on mundane matters; and many a time, as a moor-fowl arose from the\nheath, and shot along the moor, uttering his bold crow of defiance, he\nthought of the jolly Adam Woodcock, and his trusty goss-hawk; or, as\nthey passed a thicket where the low trees and bushes were intermingled\nwith tall fern, furze, and broom, so as to form a thick and intricate\ncover, his dreams were of a roebuck and a brace of gaze-hounds. But\nfrequently his mind returned to the benevolent and kind mistress whom he\nhad left behind him, offended justly, and unreconciled by any effort of\nhis.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy step would be lighter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he thought, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand so would my heart, could\nI but have returned to see her for one instant, and to say, Lady, the\norphan boy was wild, but not ungrateful!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTravelling in these divers moods, about the hour of noon they reached\na small straggling village, in which, as usual, were seen one or two\nof those predominating towers, or peel houses, which, for reasons of\ndefence elsewhere detailed, were at that time to be found in every\nBorder hamlet. A brook flowed beside the village, and watered the valley\nin which it stood. There was also a mansion at the end of the village,\nand a little way separated from it, much dilapidated, and in very\nbad order, but appearing to have been the abode of persons of some\nconsideration. The situation was agreeable, being an angle formed by the\nstream, bearing three or four large sycamore trees, which were in full\nleaf, and served to relieve the dark appearance of the mansion, which\nwas built of a deep red stone. The house itself was a large one, but was\nnow obviously too big for the inmates; several windows were built\nup, especially those which opened from the lower story; others were\nblockaded in a less substantial manner. The court before the door, which\nhad once been defended with a species of low outer-wall, now ruinous,\nwas paved, but the stones were completely covered with long gray\nnettles, thistles, and other weeds, which, shooting up betwixt the\nflags, had displaced many of them from their level. Even matters\ndemanding more peremptory attention had been left neglected, in a manner\nwhich argued sloth or poverty in the extreme. The stream, undermining a\npart of the bank near an angle of the ruinous wall, had brought it down,\nwith a corner turret, the ruins of which lay in the bed of the river.\nThe current, interrupted by the ruins which it had overthrown, and\nturned yet nearer to the site of the tower, had greatly enlarged the\nbreach it had made, and was in the process of undermining the ground\non which the house itself stood, unless it were speedily protected by\nsufficient bulwarks.\n\nAll this attracted Roland Graeme's observation, as they approached the\ndwelling by a winding path, which gave them, at intervals, a view of it\nfrom different points.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we go to yonder house,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to his mother, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI trust it is but\nfor a short visit. It looks as if two rainy days from the north-west\nwould send the whole into the brook.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see but with the eyes of the body,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the old woman; \u00e2\u0080\u009cGod will\ndefend his own, though it be forsaken and despised of men. Better to\ndwell on the sand, under his law, than fly to the rock of human trust.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs she thus spoke, they entered the court before the old mansion, and\nRoland could observe that the front of it had formerly been considerably\nornamented with carved work, in the same dark-coloured freestone of\nwhich it was built. But all these ornaments had been broken down and\ndestroyed, and only the shattered vestiges of niches and entablatures\nnow strewed the place which they had once occupied. The larger\nentrance in front was walled up, but a little footpath, which, from its\nappearance, seemed to be rarely trodden, led to a small wicket, defended\nby a door well clenched with iron-headed nails, at which Magdalen Graeme\nknocked three times, pausing betwixt each knock, until she heard an\nanswering tap from within. At the last knock, the wicket was opened by a\npale thin female, who said, \u00e2\u0080\u009c_Benedicti qui venient in nomine Domini_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n They entered, and the portress hastily shut behind them the wicket, and\nmade fast the massive fastenings by which it was secured.\n\nThe female led the way through a narrow entrance, into a vestibule of\nsome extent, paved with stone, and having benches of the same solid\nmaterial ranged around. At the upper end was an oriel window, but some\nof the intervals formed by the stone shafts and mullions were blocked\nup, so that the apartment was very gloomy.\n\nHere they stopped, and the mistress of the mansion, for such she was,\nembraced Magdalen Graeme, and greeting her by the title of sister,\nkissed her with much solemnity, on either side of the face.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe blessing of Our Lady be upon you, my sister,\u00e2\u0080\u009d were her next words;\nand they left no doubt upon Roland's mind respecting the religion of\ntheir hostess, even if he could have suspected his venerable and\nzealous guide of resting elsewhere than in the habitation of an orthodox\nCatholic. They spoke together a few words in private, during which\nhe had leisure to remark more particularly the appearance of his\ngrandmother's friend.\n\nHer age might be betwixt fifty and sixty; her looks had a mixture of\nmelancholy and unhappiness that bordered on discontent, and obscured the\nremains of beauty which age had still left on her features. Her dress\nwas of the plainest and most ordinary description, of a dark colour,\nand, like Magdalen Graeme's, something approaching to a religious habit.\nStrict neatness and cleanliness of person, seemed to intimate, that if\npoor, she was not reduced to squalid or heart-broken distress, and that\nshe was still sufficiently attached to life to retain a taste for its\ndecencies, if not its elegancies. Her manner, as well as her features\nand appearance, argued an original condition and education far above the\nmeanness of her present appearance. In short, the whole figure was\nsuch as to excite the idea, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat female must have had a history worth\nknowing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d While Roland Graeme was making this very reflection, the\nwhispers of the two females ceased, and the mistress of the mansion,\napproaching him, looked on his face and person with much attention, and,\nas it seemed, some interest.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, addressing his relative, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis the child of thine\nunhappy daughter, sister Magdalen; and him, the only shoot from your\nancient tree, you are willing to devote to the Good Cause?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, by the rood,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Magdalen Graeme, in her usual tone of\nresolved determination, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto the good cause I devote him, flesh and fell,\nsinew and limb, body and soul.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThou art a happy woman, sister Magdalen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered her companion,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat, lifted so high above human affection and human feeling, thou\ncanst bind such a victim to the horns of the altar. Had I been called\nto make such a sacrifice--to plunge a youth so young and fair into the\nplots and bloodthirsty dealings of the time, not the patriarch Abraham,\nwhen he led Isaac up the mountain, would have rendered more melancholy\nobedience.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe then continued to look at Roland with a mournful aspect of\ncompassion, until the intentness of her gaze occasioned his colour to\nrise, and he was about to move out of its influence, when he was stopped\nby his grand-mother with one hand, while with the other she divided the\nhair upon his forehead, which was now crimson with bashfulness, while\nshe added, with a mixture of proud affection and firm resolution,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy,\nlook at him well, my sister, for on a fairer face thine eye never\nrested. I too, when I first saw him, after a long separation, felt as\nthe worldly feel, and was half shaken in my purpose. But no wind can\ntear a leaf from the withered tree which has long been stripped of its\nfoliage, and no mere human casualty can awaken the mortal feelings which\nhave long slept in the calm of devotion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhile the old woman thus spoke, her manner gave the lie to her\nassertions, for the tears rose to her eyes while she added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the\nfairer and the more spotless the victim, is it not, my sister, the more\nworthy of acceptance?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe seemed glad to escape from the sensations which agitated her, and\ninstantly added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe will escape, my sister--there will be a ram caught\nin the thicket, and the hand of our revolted brethren shall not be on\nthe youthfull Joseph. Heaven can defend its own rights, even by means of\nbabes and sucklings, of women and beardless boys.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHeaven hath left us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the other female; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor our sins and our\nfathers' the succours of the blessed Saints have abandoned this accursed\nland. We may win the crown of Martyrdom, but not that of earthly\ntriumph. One, too, whose prudence was at this deep crisis so\nindispensable, has been called to a better world. The Abbot Eustatius is\nno more.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMay his soul have mercy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Magdalen Graeme, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand may Heaven, too,\nhave mercy upon us, who linger behind in this bloody land! His loss\nis indeed a perilous blow to our enterprise; for who remains behind\npossessing his far-fetched experience, his self-devoted zeal, his\nconsummate wisdom, and his undaunted courage! He hath fallen with the\nchurch's standard in his hand, but God will raise up another to lift the\nblessed banner. Whom have the Chapter elected in his room?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is rumoured no one of the few remaining brethren dare accept\nthe office. The heretics have sworn that they will permit no future\nelection, and will heavily punish any attempt to create a new Abbot of\nSaint Mary's. _Conjuraverunt inter se principes, dicentes, Projiciamus\nlaqueos ejus_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_Quousque, Domine!_\u00e2\u0080\u009d--ejaculated Magdalen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis, my sister, were\nindeed a perilous and fatal breach in our band; but I am firm in my\nbelief, that another will arise in the place of him so untimely removed.\nWhere is thy daughter Catharine?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the parlour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the matron, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut\u00e2\u0080\u009d--She looked at Roland\nGraeme, and muttered something in the ear of her friend.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFear it not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Magdalen Graeme, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is both lawful and\nnecessary--fear nothing from him--I would he were as well grounded in\nthe faith by which alone comes safety, as he is free from thought,\ndeed, or speech of villany. Therein is the heretics' discipline to be\ncommended, my sister, that they train up their youth in strong morality,\nand choke up every inlet to youthful folly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is but a cleansing the outside of the cup,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered her friend,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009ca whitening of the sepulchre; but he shall see Catharine, since you,\nsister, judge it safe and meet.--Follow us, youth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added, and led\nthe way from the apartment--with her friend. These were the only words\nwhich the matron had addressed to Roland Graeme, who obeyed them in\nsilence. As they paced through several winding passages and waste\napartments with a very slow step, the young page had leisure to make\nsome reflections on his situation,--reflections of a nature which his\nardent temper considered as specially disagreeable. It seemed he had now\ngot two mistresses, or tutoresses, instead of one, both elderly women,\nand both, it would seem, in league to direct his motions according to\ntheir own pleasure, and for the accomplishment of plans to which he was\nno party. This, he thought, was too much; arguing reasonably enough,\nthat whatever right his grandmother and benefactress had to guide his\nmotions, she was neither entitled to transfer her authority or divide it\nwith another, who seemed to assume, without ceremony, the same tone of\nabsolute command over him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it shall not long continue thus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thought Roland; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not be\nall my life the slave of a woman's whistle, to go when she bids, and\ncome when she calls. No, by Saint Andrew! the hand that can hold the\nlance is above the control of the distaff. I will leave them the slipp'd\ncollar in their hands on the first opportunity, and let them execute\ntheir own devices by their own proper force. It may save them both from\nperil, for I guess what they meditate is not likely to prove either safe\nor easy--the Earl of Murray and his heresy are too well rooted to be\ngrubbed up by two old women.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs he thus resolved, they entered a low room, in which a third female\nwas seated. This apartment was the first he had observed in the mansion\nwhich was furnished with moveable seats, and with a wooden table, over\nwhich was laid a piece of tapestry. A carpet was spread on the floor,\nthere was a grate in the chimney, and, in brief, the apartment had the\nair of being habitable and inhabited.\n\nBut Roland's eyes found better employment than to make observations on\nthe accommodations of the chamber; for this second female inhabitant of\nthe mansion seemed something very different from any thing he had yet\nseen there. At his first entry, she had greeted with a silent and low\nobeisance the two aged matrons, then glancing her eyes towards Roland,\nshe adjusted a veil which hung back over her shoulders, so as to bring\nit over her face; an operation which she performed with much modesty,\nbut without either affected haste or embarrassed timidity.\n\nDuring this manoeuvre Roland had time to observe, that the face was that\nof a girl apparently not much past sixteen, and that the eyes were at\nonce soft and brilliant. To these very favourable observations was added\nthe certainty that the fair object to whom they referred possessed an\nexcellent shape, bordering perhaps on _enbonpoint_, and therefore rather\nthat of a Hebe than of a Sylph, but beautifully formed, and shown to\ngreat advantage by the close jacket and petticoat which she wore after a\nforeign fashion, the last not quite long enough to conceal a very pretty\nfoot, which rested on a bar of the table at which she sate; her round\narms and taper fingers very busily employed in repairing--the piece\nof tapestry which was spread on it, which exhibited several deplorable\nfissures, enough to demand the utmost skill of the most expert\nseamstress.\n\nIt is to be remarked, that it was by stolen glances that Roland Graeme\ncontrived to ascertain these interesting particulars; and he thought he\ncould once or twice, notwithstanding the texture of the veil, detect the\ndamsel in the act of taking similar cognizance of his own person. The\nmatrons in the meanwhile continued their separate conversation, eyeing\nfrom time to time the young people, in a manner which left Roland in\nno doubt that they were the subject of their conversation. At length he\ndistinctly heard Magdalen Graeme say these words--\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, my sister, we\nmust give them opportunity to speak together, and to become acquainted;\nthey must be personally known to each other, or how shall they be able\nto execute what they are intrusted with?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt seemed as if the matron, not fully satisfied with her friend's\nreasoning, continued to offer some objections; but they were borne down\nby her more dictatorial friend.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt must be so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy dear sister; let us therefore go forth\non the balcony, to finish our conversation.--And do you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said,\naddressing Roland and the girl, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecome acquainted with each other.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith this she stepped up to the young woman, and raising her veil,\ndiscovered features which, whatever might be their ordinary complexion,\nwere now covered with a universal blush.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_Licitum sit,_\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Magdalen, looking at the other matron.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_Vix licitum,_\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the other, with reluctant and hesitating\nacquiescence; and again adjusting the veil of the blushing girl, she\ndropped it so as to shade, though not to conceal her countenance, and\nwhispered to her, in a tone loud enough for the page to hear, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRemember,\nCatharine, who thou art, and for what destined.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe matron then retreated with Magdalen Graeme through one of the\ncasements of the apartment, that opened on a large broad balcony, which,\nwith its ponderous balustrade, had once run along the whole south\nfront of the building which faced the brook, and formed a pleasant and\ncommodious walk in the open air. It was now in some places deprived of\nthe balustrade, in others broken and narrowed; but, ruinous as it was,\ncould still be used as a pleasant promenade. Here then walked the two\nancient dames, busied in their private conversation; yet not so much so,\nbut that Roland could observe the matrons, as their thin forms darkened\nthe casement in passing or repassing before it, dart a glance into the\napartment, to see how matters were going on there.\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Eleventh.\n\n\n  Life hath its May, and is mirthful then:\n  The woods are vocal, and the flowers all odour;\n  Its very blast has mirth in't,--and the maidens,\n  The while they don their cloaks to screen their kirtles,\n  Laugh at the rain that wets them.\n                             OLD PLAY.\n\nCatherine was at the happy age of innocence and buoyancy of spirit,\nwhen, after the first moment of embarrassment was over, a situation\nof awkwardness, like that in which she was suddenly left to make\nacquaintance with a handsome youth, not even known to her by name,\nstruck her, in spite of herself, in a ludicrous point of view. She bent\nher beautiful eyes upon the work with which she was busied, and with\ninfinite gravity sate out the two first turns of the matrons upon the\nbalcony; but then, glancing her deep blue eye a little towards Roland,\nand observing the embarrassment under which he laboured, now shifting on\nhis chair, and now dangling his cap, the whole man evincing that he was\nperfectly at a loss how to open the conversation, she could keep her\ncomposure no longer, but after a vain struggle broke out into a sincere,\nthough a very involuntary fit of laughing, so richly accompanied by the\nlaughter of her merry eyes, which actually glanced through the tears\nwhich the effort filled them with, and by the waving of her rich\ntresses, that the goddess of smiles herself never looked more lovely\nthan Catherine at that moment. A court page would not have left her long\nalone in her mirth; but Roland was country-bred, and, besides, having\nsome jealousy as well as bashfulness, he took it into his head that he\nwas himself the object of her inextinguishable laughter. His endeavours\nto sympathize with Catherine, therefore, could carry him no farther than\na forced giggle, which had more of displeasure than of mirth in it, and\nwhich so much enhanced that of the girl, that it seemed to render it\nimpossible for her ever to bring her laughter to an end, with whatever\nanxious pains she laboured to do so. For every one has felt, that when a\nparoxysm of laughter has seized him at a misbecoming time and place,\nthe efforts which he made to suppress it, nay, the very sense of the\nimpropriety of giving way to it, tend only to augment and prolong the\nirresistible impulse.\n\nIt was undoubtedly lucky for Catherine, as well as for Roland, that the\nlatter did not share in the excessive mirth of the former. For, seated\nas she was, with her back to the casement, Catherine could easily escape\nthe observation of the two matrons during the course of their promenade;\nwhereas Graeme was so placed, with his side to the window, that his\nmirth, had he shared that of his companion, would have been instantly\nvisible, and could not have failed to give offence to the personages in\nquestion. He sate, however, with some impatience, until Catherine had\nexhausted either her power or her desire of laughing, and was returning\nwith good grace to the exercise of her needle, and then he observed with\nsome dryness, that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere seemed no great occasion to recommend to them\nto improve their acquaintance, as it seemed, that they were already\ntolerably familiar.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCatherine had an extreme desire to set off upon a fresh score, but\nshe repressed it strongly, and fixing her eyes on her work, replied by\nasking his pardon, and promising to avoid future offence.\n\nRoland had sense enough to feel, that an air of offended dignity was\nvery much misplaced, and that it was with a very different bearing he\nought to meet the deep blue eyes which had borne such a hearty burden in\nthe laughing scene. He tried, therefore, to extricate himself as well as\nhe could from his blunder, by assuming a tone of correspondent gaiety,\nand requesting to know of the nymph, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow it was her pleasure that they\nshould proceed in improving the acquaintance which had commenced so\nmerrily.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou must yourself discover; perhaps I have gone a\nstep too far in opening our interview.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSuppose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe should begin as in a tale-book, by\nasking each other's names and histories?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is right well imagined,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand shows an argute\njudgment. Do you begin, and I will listen, and only put in a question\nor two at the dark parts of the story. Come, unfold then your name and\nhistory, my new acquaintance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am called Roland Graeme, and that tall woman is my grandmother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd your tutoress?--good. Who are your parents?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are both dead,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Roland.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, but who were they? you _had_ parents, I presume?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I have never been able to learn much\nof their history. My father was a Scottish knight, who died gallantly\nin his stirrups--my mother was a Graeme of Hathergill, in the Debateable\nLand--most of her family were killed when the Debateable country was\nburned by Lord Maxwell and Herries of Caerlaverock.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it long ago?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the damsel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBefore I was born,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the page.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat must be a great while since,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, shaking her head gravely;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009clook you, I cannot weep for them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt needs not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the youth, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey fell with honour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo much for your lineage, fair sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied his companion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cof whom I\nlike the living specimen (a glance at the casement) far less than those\nthat are dead. Your much honoured grandmother looks as if she could make\none weep in sad earnest. And now, fair sir, for your own person--if you\ntell not the tale faster, it will be cut short in the middle; Mother\nBridget pauses longer and longer every time she passes the window, and\nwith her there is as little mirth as in the grave of your ancestors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy tale is soon told--I was introduced into the castle of Avenel to be\npage to the lady of the mansion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is a strict Huguenot, is she not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the maiden.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs strict as Calvin himself. But my grandmother can play the puritan\nwhen it suits her purpose, and she had some plan of her own, for\nquartering me in the Castle--it would have failed, however, after we had\nremained several weeks at the hamlet, but for an unexpected master of\nceremonies--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd who was that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the girl.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA large black dog, Wolf by name, who brought me into the castle one day\nin his mouth, like a hurt wild-duck, and presented me to the lady.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA most respectable introduction, truly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand what\nmight you learn at this same castle? I love dearly to know what my\nacquaintances can do at need.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo fly a hawk, hollow to a hound, back a horse, and wield lance, bow,\nand brand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd to boast of all this when you have learned it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich, in France at least, is the surest accomplishment of a page. But\nproceed, fair sir; how came your Huguenot lord and your no less Huguenot\nlady to receive and keep in the family so perilous a person as a\nCatholic page?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause they knew not that part of my history, which from infancy I\nhave been taught to keep secret--and because my grand-dame's former\nzealous attendance on their heretic chaplain, had laid all this\nsuspicion to sleep, most fair Callipolis,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page; and in so\nsaying, he edged his chair towards the seat of the fair querist.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, but keep your distance, most gallant sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the blue-eyed\nmaiden, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor, unless I greatly mistake, these reverend ladies will soon\ninterrupt our amicable conference, if the acquaintance they recommend\nshall seem to proceed beyond a certain point--so, fair sir, be\npleased to abide by your station, and reply to my questions.--By what\nachievements did you prove the qualities of a page, which you had thus\nhappily acquired?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland, who began to enter into the tone and spirit of the damsel's\nconversation, replied to her with becoming spirit.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn no feat, fair gentlewoman, was I found inexpert, wherein there was\nmischief implied. I shot swans, hunted cats, frightened serving-women,\nchased the deer, and robbed the orchard. I say nothing of tormenting the\nchaplain in various ways, for that was my duty as a good Catholic.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, as I am a gentlewoman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think these heretics\nhave done Catholic penance in entertaining so all-accomplished a\nserving-man! And what, fair sir, might have been the unhappy event which\ndeprived them of an inmate altogether so estimable?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTruly, fair gentlewoman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the youth, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour real proverb says\nthat the longest lane will have a turning, and mine was more--it was, in\nfine, a turning off.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the merry young maiden, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is an apt play on the word--and\nwhat occasion was taken for so important a catastrophe?--Nay, start not\nfor my learning, I do know the schools--in plain phrase, why were you\nsent from service?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe page shrugged his shoulders while he replied,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cA short tale is soon\ntold--and a short horse soon curried. I made the falconer's boy taste of\nmy switch--the falconer threatened to make me brook his cudgel--he is a\nkindly clown as well as a stout, and I would rather have been cudgelled\nby him than any man in Christendom to choose--but I knew not his\nqualities at that time--so I threatened to make him brook the stab, and\nmy Lady made me brook the 'Begone;' so adieu to the page's office and\nthe fair Castle of Avenel--I had not travelled far before I met my\nvenerable parent--And so tell your tale, fair gentlewoman, for mine is\ndone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA happy grandmother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the maiden, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwho had the luck to find the\nstray page just when his mistress had slipped his leash, and a most\nlucky page that has jumped at once from a page to an old lady's\ngentleman-usher!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll this is nothing of your history,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Roland Graeme, began\nto be much interested in the congenial vivacity of this facetious young\ngentlewoman,--\u00e2\u0080\u009ctale for tale is fellow-traveller's justice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWait till we are fellow-travellers, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Catherine.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, you escape me not so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page; \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you deal not justly by\nme, I will call out to Dame Bridget, or whatever your dame be called,\nand proclaim you for a cheat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou shall not need,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the maiden--\u00e2\u0080\u009cmy history is the\ncounterpart of your own; the same words might almost serve, change but\ndress and name. I am called Catherine Seyton, and I also am an orphan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave your parents been long dead?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is the only question,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, throwing down her fine eyes with\na sudden expression of sorrow, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat is the only question I cannot laugh\nat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd Dame Bridget is your grandmother?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe sudden cloud passed away like that which crosses for an instant the\nsummer sun, and she answered with her usual lively expression, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWorse by\ntwenty degrees--Dame Bridget is my maiden aunt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOver gods forbode!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas! that you have such a tale to\ntell! and what horror comes next?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour own history, exactly. I was taken upon trial for service--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd turned off for pinching the duenna, or affronting my lady's\nwaiting-woman?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, our history varies there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the damsel--\u00e2\u0080\u009cOur mistress broke\nup house, or had her house broke up, which is the same thing, and I am a\nfree woman of the forest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I am as glad of it as if any one had lined my doublet with cloth of\ngold,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the youth.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thank you for your mirth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut the matter is not likely to\nconcern you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, but go on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor you will be presently interrupted;\nthe two good dames have been soaring yonder on the balcony, like two old\nhooded crows, and their croak grows hoarser as night comes on; they will\nwing to roost presently.--This mistress of yours, fair gentlewoman, who\nwas she, in God's name?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, she has a fair name in the world,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Catherine Seyton. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFew\nladies kept a fairer house, or held more gentlewomen in her household;\nmy aunt Bridget was one of her housekeepers. We never saw our mistress's\nblessed face, to be sure, but we heard enough of her; were up early and\ndown late, and were kept to long prayers and light food.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOut upon the penurious old beldam!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor Heaven's sake, blaspheme not!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the girl, with an expression\nof fear.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cGod pardon us both! I meant no harm. I speak of our blessed\nSaint Catherine of Sienna!--may God forgive me that I spoke so lightly,\nand made you do a great sin and a great blasphemy. This was her nunnery,\nin which there were twelve nuns and an abbess. My aunt was the abbess,\ntill the heretics turned all adrift.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd where are your companions?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the youth.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith the last year's snow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the maiden; \u00e2\u0080\u009ceast, north, south,\nand west--some to France, some to Flanders, some, I fear, into the\nworld and its pleasures. We have got permission to remain, or rather our\nremaining has been connived at, for my aunt has great relations among\nthe Kerrs, and they have threatened a death-feud if any one touches us;\nand bow and spear are the best warrant in these times.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, then, you sit under a sure shadow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the youth; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I suppose\nyou wept yourself blind when Saint Catherine broke up housekeeping\nbefore you had taken arles [Footnote: _Anglice_--Earnest-money] in her\nservice?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHush! for Heaven's sake,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the damsel, crossing herself; \u00e2\u0080\u009cno more\nof that! but I have not quite cried my eyes out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, turning them\nupon him, and instantly again bending them upon her work. It was one of\nthose glances which would require the threefold plate of brass around\nthe heart, more than it is needed by the mariners, to whom Horace\nrecommends it. Our youthful page had no defence whatever to offer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat say you, Catherine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif we two, thus strangely turned\nout of service at the same time, should give our two most venerable\nduennas the torch to hold, while we walk a merry measure with each other\nover the floor of this weary world?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA goodly proposal, truly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand worthy the mad-cap\nbrain of a discarded page!--And what shifts does your worship propose\nwe should live by?--by singing ballads, cutting purses, or swaggering\non the highway? for there, I think, you would find your most productive\nexchequer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cChoose, you proud peat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, drawing off in huge disdain\nat the calm and unembarrassed ridicule with which his wild proposal was\nreceived. And as he spoke the words, the casement was again darkened by\nthe forms of the matrons--it opened, and admitted Magdalen Graeme and\nthe Mother Abbess, so we must now style her, into the apartment.\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Twelfth.\n\n\n  Nay, hear me, brother--I am elder, wiser,\n  And holier than thou--And age, and wisdom,\n  And holiness, have peremptory claims,\n  And will be listen'd to.\n                              OLD PLAY.\n\nWhen the matrons re-entered, and put an end to the conversation--which\nwe have detailed in the last chapter, Dame Magdalen Graeme thus\naddressed her grandson and his pretty companion: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you spoke\ntogether, my children?--Have you become known to each other as\nfellow-travellers on the same dark and dubious road, whom chance hath\nbrought together, and who study to learn the tempers and dispositions of\nthose by whom their perils are to be shared?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was seldom the light-hearted Catharine could suppress a jest, so that\nshe often spoke when she would have acted more wisely in holding her\npeace.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour grandson admires the journey which you propose so very greatly,\nthat he was even now preparing for setting out upon it instantly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is to be too forward, Roland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the dame, addressing him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas\nyesterday you were over slack--the just mean lies in obedience, which\nboth waits for the signal to start, and obeys it when given.--But once\nagain, my children, have you so perused each other's countenances, that\nwhen you meet, in whatever disguise the times may impose upon you, you\nmay recognize each in the other the secret agent of the mighty work in\nwhich you are to be leagued?--Look at each other, know each line and\nlineament of each other's countenance. Learn to distinguish by the step,\nby the sound of the voice, by the motion of the hand, by the glance\nof the eye, the partner whom Heaven hath sent to aid in working its\nwill.--Wilt thou know that maiden, whensoever, or wheresoever you shall\nagain meet her, my Roland Graeme?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs readily as truly did Roland answer in the affirmative. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd thou, my\ndaughter, wilt thou again remember the features of this youth?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTruly, mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Catherine Seyton, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have not seen so many men\nof late, that I should immediately forget your grandson, though I mark\nnot much about him that is deserving of especial remembrance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJoin hands, then, my children,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Magdalen Graeme; but, in saying\nso, was interrupted by her companion, whose conventual prejudices had\nbeen gradually giving her more and more uneasiness, and who could remain\nacquiescent no longer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, my good sister, you forget,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she to Magdalen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCatharine is\nthe betrothed bride of Heaven--these intimacies cannot be.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is in the cause of Heaven that I command them to embrace,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nMagdalen, with the full force of her powerful voice; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe end, sister,\nsanctifies the means we must use.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey call me Lady Abbess, or Mother at the least, who address me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said Dame Bridget, drawing herself up, as if offended at her friend's\nauthoritative manner--\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Lady of Heathergill forgets that she speaks\nto the Abbess of Saint Catherine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I was what you call me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Magdalen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou indeed were the\nAbbess of Saint Catherine, but both names are now gone, with all the\nrank that the world and that the church gave to them; and we are now, to\nthe eye of human judgment, two poor, despised, oppressed women, dragging\nour dishonoured old age to a humble grave. But what are we in the eye of\nHeaven?--Ministers, sent forth to work his will,--in whose weakness the\nstrength of the church shall be manifested-before whom shall be humbled\nthe wisdom of Murray, and the dark strength of Morton,--And to such\nwouldst thou apply the narrow rules of thy cloistered seclusion?--or,\nhast thou forgotten the order which I showed thee from thy Superior,\nsubjecting thee to me in these matters?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOn thy head, then, be the scandal and the sin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbess,\nsullenly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOn mine be they both,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Magdalen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI say, embrace each other, my\nchildren.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Catherine, aware, perhaps, how the dispute was likely to terminate,\nhad escaped from the apartment, and so disappointed the grandson, at\nleast as much as the old matron.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is gone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbess, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto provide some little refreshment. But\nit will have little savour to those who dwell in the world; for I, at\nleast, cannot dispense with the rules to which I am vowed, because it is\nthe will of wicked men to break down the sanctuary in which they wont to\nbe observed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is well, my sister,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Magdalen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto pay each even the\nsmallest tithes of mint and cummin which the church demands, and I blame\nnot thy scrupulous observance of the rules of thine order. But they were\nestablished by the church, and for the church's benefit; and reason it\nis that they should give way when the salvation of the church herself is\nat stake.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Abbess made no reply.\n\nOne more acquainted with human nature than the inexperienced page, might\nhave found amusement in comparing the different kinds of fanaticisms\nwhich these two females exhibited. The Abbess, timid, narrowminded, and\ndiscontented, clung to ancient usages and pretensions which were ended\nby the Reformation; and was in adversity, as she had been in prosperity,\nscrupulous, weak-spirited, and bigoted. While the fiery and more lofty\nspirit of her companion suggested a wider field of effort, and would\nnot be limited by ordinary rules in the extraordinary schemes which\nwere suggested by her bold and irregular imagination. But Roland Graeme,\ninstead of tracing these peculiarities of character in the two old\ndamps, only waited with great anxiety for the return of Catherine,\nexpecting probably that the proposal of the fraternal embrace would be\nrenewed, as his grandmother seemed disposed to carry matters with a high\nhand.\n\nHis expectations, or hopes, if we may call them so, were, however,\ndisappointed; for, when Catherine re-entered on the summons of the\nAbbess, and placed on the table an earthen pitcher of water, and\nfour wooden platters, with cups of the same materials, the Dame of\nHeathergill, satisfied with the arbitrary mode in which she had borne\ndown the opposition of the Abbess, pursued her victory no farther--a\nmoderation for which her grandson, in his heart, returned her but\nslender thanks.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Catherine continued to place upon the table the\nslender preparations for the meal of a recluse, which consisted almost\nentirely of colewort, boiled and served up in a wooden platter, having\nno better seasoning than a little salt, and no better accompaniment than\nsome coarse barley-bread, in very moderate quantity. The water-pitcher,\nalready mentioned, furnished the only beverage. After a Latin\ngrace, delivered by the Abbess, the guests sat down to their spare\nentertainment. The simplicity of the fare appeared to produce no\ndistaste in the females, who ate of it moderately, but with the usual\nappearance of appetite. But Roland Graeme had been used to better\ncheer. Sir Halbert Glendinning, who affected even an unusual degree\nof nobleness in his housekeeping, maintained it in a style of genial\nhospitality, which rivalled that of the Northern Barons of England. He\nmight think, perhaps, that by doing so, he acted yet more completely\nthe part for which he was born--that of a great Baron and a leader. Two\nbullocks, and six sheep, weekly, were the allowance when the Baron was\nat home, and the number was not greatly diminished during his absence. A\nboll of malt was weekly brewed into ale, which was used by the household\nat discretion. Bread was baked in proportion for the consumption of his\ndomestics and retainers; and in this scene of plenty had Roland Graeme\nnow lived for several years. It formed a bad introduction to lukewarm\ngreens and spring-water; and probably his countenance indicated some\nsense of the difference, for the Abbess observed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would seem,\nmy son, that the tables of the heretic Baron, whom you have so long\nfollowed, are more daintily furnished than those of the suffering\ndaughters of the church; and yet, not upon the most solemn nights of\nfestival, when the nuns were permitted to eat their portion at mine own\ntable, did I consider the cates, which were then served up, as half so\ndelicious as these vegetables and this water, on which I prefer to feed,\nrather than do aught which may derogate from the strictness of my vow.\nIt shall never be said that the mistress of this house made it a house\nof feasting, when days of darkness and of affliction were hanging over\nthe Holy Church, of which I am an unworthy member.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell hast thou said, my sister,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Magdalen Graeme; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut now\nit is not only time to suffer in the good cause, but to act in it. And\nsince our pilgrim's meal is finished, let us go apart to prepare for our\njourney tomorrow, and to advise on the manner in which these children\nshall be employed, and what measures we can adopt to supply their\nthoughtlessness and lack of discretion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNotwithstanding his indifferent cheer, the heart of Roland Graeme\nbounded high at this proposal, which he doubted not would lead to\nanother _t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a2-t\u00c3\u00aate_ betwixt him and the pretty novice. But he was\nmistaken. Catherine, it would seem, had no mind so far to indulge him;\nfor, moved either by delicacy or caprice, or some of those indescribable\nshades betwixt the one and the other, with which women love to tease,\nand at the same time to captivate, the ruder sex, she reminded the\nAbbess that it was necessary she should retire an hour before vespers;\nand, receiving the ready and approving nod of her Superior, she arose\nto withdraw. But before leaving the apartment, she made obeisance to the\nmatrons, bending herself till her hands touched her knees, and then made\na lesser reverence to Roland, which consisted in a slight bend of\nthe body and gentle depression of the head. This she performed very\ndemurely; but the party on whom the salutation was conferred, thought he\ncould discern in her manner an arch and mischievous exultation over his\nsecret disappointment.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe devil take the saucy girl,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he thought in\nhis heart, though the presence of the Abbess should have repressed all\nsuch profane imaginations,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cshe is as hard-hearted as the laughing\nhyaena that the story-books tell of--she has a mind that I shall not\nforget her this night at least.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe matrons now retired also, giving the page to understand that he\nwas on no account to stir from the convent, or to show himself at the\nwindows, the Abbess assigning as a reason, the readiness with which the\nrude heretics caught at every occasion of scandalizing the religious\norders.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is worse than the rigour of Mr. Henry Warden, himself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\npage, when he was left alone; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor, to do him justice, however strict in\nrequiring the most rigid attention during the time of his homilies, he\nleft us to the freedom of our own wills afterwards--ay, and would take\na share in our pastimes, too, if he thought them entirely innocent.\nBut these old women are utterly wrapt up in gloom, mystery and\nself-denial.--Well, then, if I must neither stir out of the gate nor\nlook out at window, I will at least see what the inside of the house\ncontains that may help to pass away one's time--peradventure I may light\non that blue-eyed laugher in some corner or other.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGoing, therefore, out of the chamber by the entrance opposite to that\nthrough which the two matrons had departed, (for it may be readily\nsupposed that he had no desire to intrude on their privacy.) he wandered\nfrom one chamber to another, through the deserted edifice, seeking, with\nboyish eagerness, some source of interest and amusement. Here he passed\nthrough a long gallery, opening on either hand into the little cells\nof the nuns, all deserted, and deprived of the few trifling articles of\nfurniture which the rules of the order admitted.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe birds are flown,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thought the page; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut whether they will find\nthemselves worse off in the open air than in these damp narrow cages, I\nleave my Lady Abbess and my venerable relative to settle betwixt them.\nI think the wild young lark whom they have left behind them, would like\nbest to sing under God's free sky.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA winding stair, strait and narrow, as if to remind the nuns of their\nduties of fast and maceration, led down to a lower suite of apartments,\nwhich occupied the ground story of the house. These rooms were even more\nruinous than those which he had left; for, having encountered the first\nfury of the assailants by whom the nunnery had been wasted, the windows\nhad been dashed in, the doors broken down, and even the partitions\nbetwixt the apartments, in some places, destroyed. As he thus stalked\nfrom desolation to desolation, and began to think of returning from\nso uninteresting a research to the chamber which he had left, he was\nsurprised to hear the low of a cow very close to him. The sound was so\nunexpected at the time and place, that Roland Graeme started as if it\nhad been the voice of a lion, and laid his hand on his dagger, while at\nthe same moment the light and lovely form of Catherine Seyton presented\nitself at the door of the apartment from which the sound had issued.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood even to you, valiant champion!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she: \u00e2\u0080\u009csince the days of Guy\nof Warwick, never was one more worthy to encounter a dun cow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCow?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme, \u00e2\u0080\u009cby my faith, I thought it had been the\ndevil that roared so near me. Who ever heard of a convent containing a\ncow-house?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCow and calf may come hither now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Catherine, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor we have no\nmeans to keep out either. But I advise you, kind sir, to return to the\nplace from whence you came.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot till I see your charge, fair sister,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Roland, and made\nhis way into the apartment, in spite of the half serious half laughing\nremonstrances of the girl.\n\nThe poor solitary cow, now the only severe recluse within the nunnery,\nwas quartered in a spacious chamber, which had once been the refectory\nof the convent. The roof was graced with groined arches, and the wall\nwith niches, from which the images had been pulled down. These remnants\nof architectural ornaments were strangely contrasted with the rude crib\nconstructed for the cow in one corner of the apartment, and the stack of\nfodder which was piled beside it for her food. [Footnote: This, like\nthe cell of Saint Cuthbert, is an imaginary scene, but I took one or\ntwo ideas of the desolation of the interior from a story told me by my\nfather. In his youth--it may be near eighty years since, as he was born\nin 1729--he had occasion to visit an old lady who resided in a Border\ncastle of considerable renown. Only one very limited portion of the\nextensive ruins sufficed for the accommodation of the inmates, and my\nfather amused himself by wandering through the part that was untenanted.\nIn a dining-apartment, having a roof richly adorned with arches and\ndrops, there was deposited a large stack of hay, to which calves were\nhelping themselves from opposite sides. As my father was scaling a\ndark ruinous turnpike staircase, his greyhound ran up before him, and\nprobably was the means of saving his life, for the animal fell through\na trap-door, or aperture in the stair, thus warning the owner of the\ndanger of the ascent. As the dog continued howling from a great depth,\nmy father got the old butler, who alone knew most of the localities\nabout the castle, to unlock a sort of stable, in which Kill-buck was\nfound safe and sound, the place being filled with the same commodity\nwhich littered the stalls of Augeas, and which had rendered the dog's\nfall an easy one.]\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy my faith,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCrombie is more lordly lodged than any\none here!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou had best remain with her,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand supply by your\nfilial attentions the offspring she has had the ill luck to lose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will remain, at least, to help you to prepare her night's lair,\npretty Catherine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, seizing upon a pitch-fork.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy no means,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor, besides that you know not in the\nleast how to do her that service, you will bring a chiding my way, and I\nget enough of that in the regular course of things.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat! for accepting my assistance?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cfor accepting _my_\nassistance, who am to be your confederate in some deep matter of import?\nThat were altogether unreasonable--and, now I think on it, tell me if\nyou can, what is this mighty emprise to which I am destined?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRobbing a bird's nest, I should suppose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine, \u00e2\u0080\u009cconsidering\nthe champion whom they have selected.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy my faith,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the youth, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand he that has taken a falcon's nest\nin the Scaurs of Polmoodie, has done something to brag of, my fair\nsister.--But that is all over now--a murrain on the nest, and the eyases\nand their food, washed or unwashed, for it was all anon of cramming\nthese worthless kites that I was sent upon my present travels. Save\nthat I have met with you, pretty sister, I could eat my dagger-hilt for\nvexation at my own folly. But, as we are to be fellow-travellers--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFellow-labourers! not fellow-travellers!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the girl; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor to\nyour comfort be it known, that the Lady Abbess and I set out earlier\nthan you and your respected relative to-morrow, and that I partly endure\nyour company at present, because it may be long ere we meet again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy Saint Andrew, but it shall not though,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Roland; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not\nhunt at all unless we are to hunt in couples.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI suspect, in that and in other points, we must do as we are bid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n replied the young lady.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, hark! I hear my aunt's voice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old lady entered in good earnest, and darted a severe glance at her\nniece, while Roland had the ready wit to busy himself about the halter\nof the cow.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe young gentleman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine, gravely, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis helping me to tie\nthe cow up faster to her stake, for I find that last night when she put\nher head out of window and lowed, she alarmed the whole village;\nand--we shall be suspected of sorcery among the heretics, if they do not\ndiscover the cause of the apparition, or lose our cow if they do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRelieve yourself of that fear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbess, somewhat ironically;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe person to whom she is now sold, comes for the animal presently.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood night, then, my poor companion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine, patting the\nanimal's shoulders; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope thou hast fallen into kind hands, for my\nhappiest hours of late have been spent in tending thee--I would I had\nbeen born to no better task!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, out upon thee, mean-spirited wench!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbess; \u00e2\u0080\u009cis that a\nspeech worthy of the name of Seyton, or of the mouth of a sister of this\nhouse, treading the path of election--and to be spoken before a stranger\nyouth, too?--Go to my oratory, minion--there read your Hours till I come\nthither, when I will read you such a lecture as shall make you prize the\nblessings which you possess.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCatherine was about to withdraw in silence, casting a half sorrowful\nhalf comic glance at Roland Graeme, which seemed to say--\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see to\nwhat your untimely visit has exposed me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d when, suddenly changing her\nmind, she came forward to the page, and extended her hand as she bid\nhim good evening. Their palms had pressed each other ere the astonished\nmatron could interfere, and Catherine had time to say--\u00e2\u0080\u009cForgive me,\nmother; it is long since we have seen a face that looked with kindness\non us. Since these disorders have broken up our peaceful retreat, all\nhas been gloom and malignity. I bid this youth kindly farewell, because\nhe has come hither in kindness, and because the odds are great, that\nwe may never again meet in this world. I guess better than he, that the\nschemes on which you are rushing are too mighty for your management, and\nthat you are now setting the stone a-rolling, which must surely crush\nyou in its descent. I bid fare-well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto my fellow-victim!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis was spoken with a tone of deep and serious feeling, altogether\ndifferent from the usual levity of Catherine's manner, and plainly\nshowed, that beneath the giddiness of extreme youth and total\ninexperience, there lurked in her bosom a deeper power of sense and\nfeeling, than her conduct had hitherto expressed.\n\nThe Abbess remained a moment silent after she had left the room. The\nproposed rebuke died on her tongue, and she appeared struck with the\ndeep and foreboding, tone in which her niece had spoken her good-even.\nShe led the way in silence to the apartment which they had formerly\noccupied, and where there was prepared a small refection, as the\nAbbess termed it, consisting of milk and barley-bread. Magdalen Graeme,\nsummoned to take share in this collation, appeared from an adjoining\napartment, but Catherine was seen no more. There was little said during\nthe hasty meal, and after it was finished, Roland Graeme was dismissed\nto the nearest cell, where some preparations had been made for his\nrepose.\n\nThe strange circumstances in which he found himself, had their usual\neffect in preventing slumber from hastily descending on him, and he\ncould distinctly hear, by a low but earnest murmuring in the apartment\nwhich he had left, that the matrons continued in deep consultation to\na late hour. As they separated he heard the Abbess distinctly express\nherself thus: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn a word, my sister, I venerate your character and the\nauthority with which my Superiors have invested you; yet it seems to me,\nthat, ere entering on this perilous course, we should consult some of\nthe Fathers of the Church.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd how and where are we to find a faithful Bishop or Abbot at whom to\nask counsel? The faithful Eustatius is no more--he is withdrawn from a\nworld of evil, and from the tyranny of heretics. May Heaven and our\nLady assoilzie him of his sins, and abridge the penance of his mortal\ninfirmities!--Where shall we find another, with whom to take counsel?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHeaven will provide for the Church,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbess; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand the faithful\nfathers who yet are suffered to remain in the house of Kennaquhair, will\nproceed to elect an Abbot. They will not suffer the staff to fall down,\nor the mitre to be unfilled, for the threats of heresy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat will I learn to-morrow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Magdalen Graeme; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyet who now takes\nthe office of an hour, save to partake with the spoilers in their work\nof plunder?--to-morrow will tell us if one of the thousand saints who\nare sprung from the House of Saint Mary's continues to look down on it\nin its misery.--Farewell, my sister--we meet at Edinburgh.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBenedicito!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Abbess, and they parted.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo Kennaquhair and to Edinburgh we bend our way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d thought Roland\nGraeme. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat information have I purchased by a sleepless hour--it suits\nwell with my purpose. At Kennaquhair I shall see Father Ambrose;--at\nEdinburgh I shall find the means of shaping my own course through\nthis bustling world, without burdening my affectionate relation--at\nEdinburgh, too, I shall see again the witching novice, with her blue\neyes and her provoking smile.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--He fell asleep, and it was to dream of\nCatherine Seyton.\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Thirteenth.\n\n\n  What, Dagon up again!--I thought we had hurl'd him\n  Down on the threshold, never more to rise.\n  Bring wedge and axe; and, neighbours, lend your hands\n  And rive the idol into winter fagots!\n                   ATHELSTANE, OR THE CONVERTED DANE.\n\nRoland Graeme slept long and sound, and the sun was high over the\nhorizon, when the voice of his companion summoned him to resume their\npilgrimage; and when, hastily arranging his dress, he went to attend her\ncall, the enthusiastic matron stood already at the threshold, prepared\nfor her journey. There was in all the deportment of this remarkable\nwoman, a promptitude of execution, and a sternness of perseverance,\nfounded on the fanaticism which she nursed so deeply, and which seemed\nto absorb all the ordinary purposes and feelings of mortality. One only\nhuman affection gleamed through her enthusiastic energies, like the\nbroken glimpses of the sun through the rising clouds of a storm. It was\nher maternal fondness for her grandson--a fondness carried almost to the\nverge of dotage, in circumstances where the Catholic religion was not\nconcerned, but which gave way instantly when it chanced either to thwart\nor come in contact with the more settled purpose of her soul, and the\nmore devoted duty of her life. Her life she would willingly have laid\ndown to save the earthly object of her affection; but that object itself\nshe was ready to hazard, and would have been willing to sacrifice,\ncould the restoration of the Church of Rome have been purchased with his\nblood. Her discourse by the way, excepting on the few occasions in which\nher extreme love of her grandson found opportunity to display itself in\nanxiety for his health and accommodation, turned entirely on the duty\nof raising up the fallen honours of the Church, and replacing a Catholic\nsovereign on the throne. There were times at which she hinted, though\nvery obscurely and distantly, that she herself was foredoomed by Heaven\nto perform a part in this important task; and that she had more than\nmere human warranty for the zeal with which she engaged in it. But on\nthis subject she expressed herself in such general language, that it was\nnot easy to decide whether she made any actual pretensions to a direct\nand supernatural call, like the celebrated Elizabeth Barton, commonly\ncalled the Nun of Kent; [Footnote: A fanatic nun, called the Holy Maid\nof Kent, who pretended to the gift of prophecy and power of miracles.\nHaving denounced the doom of speedy death against Henry VIII. for his\nmarriage with Anne Boleyn, the prophetess was attainted in Parliament,\nand executed with her accomplices. Her imposture was for a time so\nsuccessful, that even Sir Thomas More was disposed to be a believer.]\nor whether she dwelt upon the general duty which was incumbent on\nall Catholics of the time, and the pressure of which she felt in an\nextraordinary degree.\n\nYet though Magdalen Graeme gave no direct intimation of her pretensions\nto be considered as something beyond the ordinary class of mortals,\nthe demeanour of one or two persons amongst the travellers whom they\noccasionally met, as they entered the more fertile and populous part of\nthe valley, seemed to indicate their belief in her superior attributes.\nIt is true, that two clowns, who drove before them a herd of cattle--one\nor two village wenches, who seemed bound for some merry-making--a\nstrolling soldier, in a rusted morion, and a wandering student, as his\nthreadbare black cloak and his satchel of books proclaimed him--passed\nour travellers without observation, or with a look of contempt; and,\nmoreover, that two or three children, attracted by the appearance of\na dress so nearly resembling that of a pilgrim, joined in hooting and\ncalling \u00e2\u0080\u009cOut upon the mass-monger!\u00e2\u0080\u009d But one or two, who nourished in\ntheir bosoms respect for the downfallen hierarchy--casting first a\ntimorous glance around, to see that no one observed them--hastily\ncrossed themselves--bent their knee to Sister Magdalen, by which\nname they saluted her--kissed her hand, or even the hem of her\ndalmatique--received with humility the Benedicite with which she repaid\ntheir obeisance; and then starting up, and again looking timidly round\nto see that they had been unobserved, hastily resumed their journey.\nEven while within sight of persons of the prevailing faith, there were\nindividuals bold enough, by folding their arms and bending their head,\nto give distant and silent intimation that they recognized Sister\nMagdalen, and honoured alike her person and her purpose.\n\nShe failed not to notice to her grandson these marks of honour and\nrespect which from time to time she received. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy\nson, that the enemies have been unable altogether to suppress the good\nspirit, or to root out the true seed. Amid heretics and schismatics,\nspoilers of the church's lands, and scoffers at saints and sacraments,\nthere is left a remnant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is true, my mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut methinks they are of\na quality which can help us but little. See you not all those who wear\nsteel at their side, and bear marks of better quality, ruffle past us as\nthey would past the meanest beggars? for those who give us any marks of\nsympathy, are the poorest of the poor, and most outcast of the needy,\nwho have neither bread to share with us, nor swords to defend us, nor\nskill to use them if they had. That poor wretch that last kneeled to you\nwith such deep devotion, and who seemed emaciated by the touch of some\nwasting disease within, and the grasp of poverty without--that pale,\nshivering, miserable caitiff, how can he aid the great schemes you\nmeditate?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMuch, my son,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Matron, with more mildness than the page\nperhaps expected. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen that pious son of the church returns from the\nshrine of Saint Ringan, whither he now travels by my counsel, and by the\naid of good Catholics,--when he returns, healed, of his wasting\nmalady, high in health, and strong in limb, will not the glory of his\nfaithfulness, and its miraculous reward, speak louder in the ears of\nthis besotted people of Scotland, than the din which is weekly made in a\nthousand heretical pulpits?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, but, mother, I fear the Saint's hand is out. It is long since we\nhave heard of a miracle performed at St. Ringan's.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe matron made a dead pause, and, with a voice tremulous with emotion,\nasked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cArt thou so unhappy as to doubt the power of the blessed Saint?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the youth hastened to reply, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe as the Holy\nChurch commands, and doubt not Saint Ringan's power of healing; but, be\nit said with reverence, he hath not of late showed the inclination.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd has this land deserved it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Catholic matron, advancing\nhastily while she spoke, until she attained the summit of a rising\nground, over which the path led, and then standing again still.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cstood the Cross, the limits of the Halidome of Saint\nMary's--here--on this eminence--from which the eye of the holy pilgrim\nmight first catch a view of that ancient monastery, the light of the\nland, the abode of Saints, and the grave of monarchs--Where is now that\nemblem of our faith? It lies on the earth--a shapeless block, from which\nthe broken fragments have been carried off, for the meanest uses, till\nnow no semblance of its original form remains. Look towards the east,\nmy son, where the sun was wont to glitter on stately spires--from which\ncrosses and bells have now been hurled, as if the land had been invaded\nonce more by barbarous heathens.--Look at yonder battlements, of which\nwe can, even at this distance, descry the partial demolition; and ask\nif this land can expect from the blessed saints, whose shrines and whose\nimages have been profaned, any other miracles but those of vengeance?\nHow long,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she exclaimed, looking upward, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow long shall it be\ndelayed?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She paused, and then resumed with enthusiastic rapidity, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\nmy son, all on earth is but for a period--joy and grief, triumph and\ndesolation, succeed each other like cloud and sunshine;--the vineyard\nshall not be forever trodden down, the gaps shall be amended, and the\nfruitful branches once more dressed and trimmed. Even this day--ay,\neven this hour, I trust to hear news of importance. Dally not--let us\non--time is brief, and judgment is certain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe resumed the path which led to the Abbey--a path which, in ancient\ntimes, was carefully marked out by posts and rails, to assist the\npilgrim in his journey--these were now torn up and destroyed. A\nhalf-hour's walk placed them in front of the once splendid Monastery,\nwhich, although the church was as yet entire, had not escaped the fury\nof the times. The long range of cells and of apartments for the use of\nthe brethren, which occupied two sides of the great square, were almost\nentirely ruinous, the interior having been consumed by fire, which\nonly the massive architecture of the outward walls had enabled them to\nresist. The Abbot's house, which formed the third side of the square,\nwas, though injured, still inhabited, and afforded refuge to the few\nbrethren, who yet, rather by connivance than by actual authority,--were\npermitted to remain at Kennaquhair. Their stately offices--their\npleasant gardens--the magnificent cloisters constructed for their\nrecreation, were all dilapidated and ruinous; and some of the building\nmaterials had apparently been put into requisition by persons in the\nvillage and in the vicinity, who, formerly vassals of the Monastery, had\nnot hesitated to appropriate to themselves a part of the spoils. Roland\nsaw fragments of Gothic pillars richly carved, occupying the place of\ndoor-posts to the meanest huts; and here and there a mutilated statue,\ninverted or laid on its side, made the door-post, or threshold, of a\nwretched cow-house. The church itself was less injured than the other\nbuildings of the Monastery. But the images which had been placed in the\nnumerous niches of its columns and buttresses, having all fallen under\nthe charge of idolatry, to which the superstitious devotion of the\nPapists had justly exposed them, had been broken and thrown down,\nwithout much regard to the preservation of the rich and airy canopies\nand pedestals on which they were placed; nor, if the devastation had\nstopped short at this point, could we have considered the preservation\nof these monuments of antiquity as an object to be put in the balance\nwith the introduction of the reformed worship.\n\nOur pilgrims saw the demolition of these sacred and venerable\nrepresentations of saints and angels--for as sacred and venerable they\nhad been taught to consider them--with very different feelings. The\nantiquary may be permitted to regret the necessity of the action, but\nto Magdalen Graeme it seemed a deed of impiety, deserving the instant\nvengeance of heaven,--a sentiment in which her relative joined for the\nmoment as cordially as herself. Neither, however, gave vent to their\nfeelings in words, and uplifted hands and eyes formed their only mode of\nexpressing them. The page was about to approach the great eastern gate\nof the church, but was prevented by his guide. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat gate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009chas long been blockaded, that the heretical rabble may not know there\nstill exist among the brethren of Saint Mary's men who dare worship\nwhere their predecessors prayed while alive, and were interred when\ndead--follow me this way, my son.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland Graeme followed accordingly; and Magdalen, casting a hasty glance\nto see whether they were observed, (for she had learned caution from the\ndanger of the times,) commanded her grandson to knock at a little wicket\nwhich she pointed out to him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut knock gently,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added, with a\nmotion expressive of caution. After a little space, during which no\nanswer was returned, she signed to Roland to repeat his summons for\nadmission; and the door at length partially opening, discovered a\nglimpse of the thin and timid porter, by whom the duty was performed,\nskulking from the observation of those who stood without; but\nendeavouring at the same time to gain a sight of them without being\nhimself seen. How different from the proud consciousness of dignity with\nwhich the porter of ancient days offered his important brow, and his\ngoodly person, to the pilgrims who repaired to Kennaquhair! His solemn\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_Intrate, mei filii,_\u00e2\u0080\u009d was exchanged for a tremulous \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou cannot enter\nnow--the brethren are in their chambers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But, when Magdalen Graeme\nasked, in an under tone of voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHast thou forgotten me, my brother?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n he changed his apologetic refusal to \u00e2\u0080\u009cEnter, my honoured sister, enter\nspeedily, for evil eyes are upon us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey entered accordingly, and having waited until the porter had, with\njealous haste, barred and bolted the wicket, were conducted by him\nthrough several dark and winding passages. As they walked slowly on,\nhe spoke to the matron in a subdued voice, as if he feared to trust the\nvery walls with the avowal which he communicated.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOur Fathers are assembled in the Chapter-house, worthy sister--yes, in\nthe Chapter-house--for the election of an Abbott.--Ah, Benedicite! there\nmust be no ringing of bells--no high mass--no opening of the great gates\nnow, that the people might see and venerate their spiritual Father! Our\nFathers must hide themselves rather like robbers who choose a leader,\nthan godly priests who elect a mitred Abbot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRegard not that, my brother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Magdalen Graeme; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe first\nsuccessors of Saint Peter himself were elected, not in sunshine, but\nin tempests--not in the halls of the Vatican, but in the subterranean\nvaults and dungeons of heathen Rome--they were not gratulated with\nshouts and salvos of cannon-shot and of musketry, and the display of\nartificial fire--no, my brother--but by the hoarse summons of Lictors\nand Praetors, who came to drag the Fathers of the Church to martyrdom.\nFrom such adversity was the Church once raised, and by such will it\nnow be purified.--And mark me, brother! not in the proudest days of the\nmitred Abbey, was a Superior ever chosen, whom his office shall so much\nhonour, as _he_ shall be honoured, who now takes it upon him in these\ndays of tribulation. On whom, my brother, will the choice fall?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOn whom can it fall--or, alas! who would dare to reply to the call,\nsave the worthy pupil of the Sainted Eustatius--the good and valiant\nFather Ambrose?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Magdalen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy heart told me long ere your lips had\nuttered his name. Stand forth, courageous champion, and man the fatal\nbreach!--Rise, bold and experienced pilot, and seize the helm while\nthe tempest rages!--Turn back the battle, brave raiser of the fallen\nstandard!--Wield crook and slang, noble shepherd of a scattered flock!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI pray you, hush, my sister!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the porter, opening a door which led\ninto the great church, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe brethren will be presently here to celebrate\ntheir election with a solemn mass--I must marshal them the way to the\nhigh altar--all the offices of this venerable house have now devolved on\none poor decrepit old man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe left the church, and Magdalen and Roland remained alone in that great\nvaulted space, whose style of rich, yet chaste architecture, referred\nits origin to the early part of the fourteenth century, the best period\nof Gothic building. But the niches were stripped of their images in the\ninside as well as the outside of the church; and in the pell-mell havoc,\nthe tombs of warriors and of princes had been included in the demolition\nof the idolatrous shrines. Lances and swords of antique size, which had\nhung over the tombs of mighty warriors of former days, lay now strewed\namong relics, with which the devotion of pilgrims had graced those of\ntheir peculiar saints; and the fragments of the knights and dames, which\nhad once lain recumbent, or kneeled in an attitude of devotion, where\ntheir mortal relics were reposed, were mingled with those of the saints\nand angels of the Gothic chisel, which the hand of violence had sent\nheadlong from their stations.\n\nThe most fatal symptom of the whole appeared to be, that, though this\nviolence had now been committed for many months, the Fathers had lost so\ntotally all heart and resolution, that they had not adventured even upon\nclearing away the rubbish, or restoring the church to some decent degree\nof order. This might have been done without much labour. But terror had\noverpowered the scanty remains of a body once so powerful, and, sensible\nthey were only suffered to remain in this ancient seat by connivance and\nfrom compassion, they did not venture upon taking any step which might\nbe construed into an assertion of their ancient rights, contenting\nthemselves with the secret and obscure exercise of their religious\nceremonial, in as unostentatious a manner as was possible.\n\nTwo or three of the more aged brethren had sunk under the pressure of\nthe times, and the ruins had been partly cleared away to permit their\ninterment. One stone had been laid over Father Nicholas, which recorded\nof him in special, that he had taken the vows during the incumbency of\nAbbot Ingelram, the period to which his memory so frequently recurred.\nAnother flag-stone, yet more recently deposited, covered the body of\nPhilip the Sacristan, eminent for his aquatic excursion with the phantom\nof Avenel, and a third, the most recent of all, bore the outline of a\nmitre, and the words _Hic jacet Eustatius Abbas_; for no one dared to\nadd a word of commendation in favour of his learning, and strenuous zeal\nfor the Roman Catholic faith.\n\nMagdalen Graeme looked at and perused the brief records of these\nmonuments successively, and paused over that of Father Eustace. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn\na good hour for thyself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut oh! in an evil hour for the\nChurch, wert thou called from us. Let thy spirit be with us, holy\nman--encourage thy successor to tread in thy footsteps--give him thy\nbold and inventive capacity, thy zeal and thy discretion--even _thy_\npiety exceeds not his.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As she spoke, a side door, which closed a\npassage from the Abbot's house into the church, was thrown open, that\nthe Fathers might enter the choir, and conduct to the high altar the\nSuperior whom they had elected.\n\nIn former times, this was one of the most splendid of the many pageants\nwhich the hierarchy of Rome had devised to attract the veneration of\nthe faithful. The period during which the Abbacy remained vacant, was\na state of mourning, or, as their emblematical phrase expressed it,\nof widowhood; a melancholy term, which was changed into rejoicing and\ntriumph when a new Superior was chosen. When the folding doors were on\nsuch solemn occasions thrown open, and the new Abbot appeared on the\nthreshold in full-blown dignity, with ring and mitre, and dalmatique\nand crosier, his hoary standard-bearers and his juvenile dispensers of\nincense preceding him, and the venerable train of monks behind him, with\nall besides which could announce the supreme authority to which he was\nnow raised, his appearance was a signal for the magnificent _jubilate_\nto rise from the organ and music-loft, and to be joined by the\ncorresponding bursts of Alleluiah from the whole assembled congregation.\nNow all was changed. In the midst of rubbish and desolation, seven or\neight old men, bent and shaken as much by grief and fear as by age,\nshrouded hastily in the proscribed dress of their order, wandered like\na procession of spectres, from the door which had been thrown open, up\nthrough the encumbered passage, to the high altar, there to instal their\nelected Superior a chief of ruins. It was like a band of bewildered\ntravellers choosing a chief in the wilderness of Arabia; or a\nshipwrecked crew electing a captain upon the barren island on which fate\nhas thrown them.\n\nThey who, in peaceful times, are most ambitious of authority among\nothers, shrink from the competition at such eventful periods, when\nneither ease nor parade attend the possession of it, and when it gives\nonly a painful pre-eminence both in danger and in labour, and exposes\nthe ill-fated chieftain to the murmurs of his discontented associates,\nas well as to the first assault of the common enemy. But he on whom the\noffice of the Abbot of Saint Mary's was now conferred, had a mind fitted\nfor the situation to which he was called. Bold and enthusiastic, yet\ngenerous and forgiving--wise and skilful, yet zealous and prompt--he\nwanted but a better cause than the support of a decaying superstition,\nto have raised him to the rank of a truly great man. But as the end\ncrowns the work, it also forms the rule by which it must be ultimately\njudged; and those who, with sincerity and generosity, fight and fall in\nan evil cause, posterity can only compassionate as victims of a generous\nbut fatal error. Amongst these, we must rank Ambrosius, the last Abbot\nof Kennaqubair, whose designs must be condemned, as their success would\nhave riveted on Scotland the chains of antiquated superstition and\nspiritual tyranny; but whose talents commanded respect, and whose\nvirtues, even from the enemies of his faith, extorted esteem.\n\nThe bearing of the new Abbot served of itself to dignify a ceremonial\nwhich was deprived of all other attributes of grandeur. Conscious of\nthe peril in which they stood, and recalling, doubtless, the better days\nthey had seen, there hung over his brethren an appearance of mingled\nterror, and grief, and shame, which induced them to hurry over the\noffice in which they were engaged, as something at once degrading and\ndangerous.\n\nBut not so Father Ambrose. His features, indeed, expressed a deep\nmelancholy, as he walked up the centre aisle, amid the ruin of things\nwhich he considered as holy, but his brow was undejected, and his step\nfirm and solemn. He seemed to think that the dominion which he was about\nto receive, depended in no sort upon the external circumstances under\nwhich it was conferred; and if a mind so firm was accessible to sorrow\nor fear, it was not on his own account, but on that of the Church to\nwhich he had devoted himself.\n\nAt length he stood on the broken steps of the high altar, barefooted, as\nwas the rule, and holding in his hand his pastoral staff, for the gemmed\nring and jewelled mitre had become secular spoils. No obedient vassals\ncame, man after man, to make their homage, and to offer the tribute\nwhich should provide their spiritual Superior with palfrey and\ntrappings. No Bishop assisted at the solemnity, to receive into the\nhigher ranks of the Church nobility a dignitary, whose voice in the\nlegislature was as potential as his own. With hasty and maimed rites,\nthe few remaining brethren stepped forward alternately to give their new\nAbbot the kiss of peace, in token of fraternal affection and spiritual\nhomage. Mass was then hastily performed, but in such precipitation as if\nit had been hurried over rather to satisfy the scruples of a few youths,\nwho were impatient to set out on a hunting party, than as if it made the\nmost solemn part of a solemn ordination. The officiating priest faltered\nas he spoke the service, and often looked around, as if he expected to\nbe interrupted in the midst of his office; and the brethren listened to\nthat which, short as it was, they wished yet more abridged.[Footnote:\nIn Catholic countries, in order to reconcile the pleasures of the great\nwith the observances of religion, it was common, when a party was bent\nfor the chase, to celebrate mass, abridged and maimed of its rites,\ncalled a hunting-mass, the brevity of which was designed to correspond\nwith the impatience of the audience.]\n\nThese symptoms of alarm increased as the ceremony proceeded, and, as it\nseemed, were not caused by mere apprehension alone; for, amid the pauses\nof the hymn, there were heard without sounds of a very different sort,\nbeginning faintly and at a distance, but at length approaching close to\nthe exterior of the church, and stunning with dissonant clamour those\nengaged in the service. The winding of horns, blown with no regard to\nharmony or concert; the jangling of bells, the thumping of drums,\nthe squeaking of bagpipes, and the clash of cymbals--the shouts of a\nmultitude, now as in laughter, now as in anger--the shrill tones of\nfemale voices, and of those of children, mingling with the deeper\nclamour of men, formed a Babel of sounds, which first drowned, and then\nawed into utter silence, the official hymns of the Convent. The cause\nand result of this extraordinary interruption will be explained in the\nnext chapter.\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Fourteenth.\n\n\n  Not the wild billow, when it breaks its barrier--\n  Not the wild wind, escaping from its cavern--\n  Not the wild fiend, that mingles both together,\n  And pours their rage upon the ripening harvest,\n  Can match the wild freaks of this mirthful meeting--\n  Comic, yet fearful--droll, and yet destructive.\n                              THE CONSPIRACY.\n\nThe monks ceased their song, which, like that of the choristers in the\nlegend of the Witch of Berkley, died away in a quaver of consternation;\nand, like a flock of chickens disturbed by the presence of the\nkite, they at first made a movement to disperse and fly in different\ndirections, and then, with despair, rather than hope, huddled themselves\naround their new Abbot; who, retaining the lofty and undismayed look\nwhich had dignified him through the whole ceremony, stood on the higher\nstep of the altar, as if desirous to be the most conspicuous mark on\nwhich danger might discharge itself, and to save his companions by his\nself-devotion, since he could afford them no other protection.\n\nInvoluntarily, as it were, Magdalen Graeme and the page stepped from the\nstation which hitherto they had occupied unnoticed, and approached to\nthe altar, as desirous of sharing the fate which approached the monks,\nwhatever that might be. Both bowed reverently low to the Abbot; and\nwhile Magdalen seemed about to speak, the youth, looking towards the\nmain entrance, at which the noise now roared most loudly, and which was\nat the same time assailed with much knocking, laid his hand upon his\ndagger.\n\nThe Abbot motioned to both to forbear: \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeace, my sister,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, in a\nlow tone, but which, being in a different key from the tumultuary sounds\nwithout, could be distinctly heard, even amidst the tumult;--\u00e2\u0080\u009cPeace,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy sister; let the new Superior of Saint Mary's himself receive\nand reply to the grateful acclamations of the vassals, who come to\ncelebrate his installation.--And thou, my son, forbear, I charge thee,\nto touch thy earthly weapon;--if it is the pleasure of our protectress,\nthat her shrine be this day desecrated by deeds of violence, and\npolluted by blood-shedding, let it not, I charge thee, happen through\nthe deed of a Catholic son of the church.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe noise and knocking at the outer gate became now every moment louder;\nand voices were heard impatiently demanding admittance. The Abbot, with\ndignity, and with a step which even the emergency of danger rendered\nneither faltering nor precipitate, moved towards the portal, and\ndemanded to know, in a tone of authority, who it was that disturbed\ntheir worship, and what they desired?\n\nThere was a moment's silence, and then a loud laugh from without. At\nlength a voice replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe desire entrance into the church; and when\nthe door is opened you will soon see who we are.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy whose authority do you require entrance?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Father.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy authority of the right reverend Lord Abbot of Unreason.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n[Footnote: We learn from no less authority than that of Napoleon\nBonaparte, that there is but a single step between the sublime and\nridiculous; and it is a transition from one extreme to another; so very\neasy, that the vulgar of every degree are peculiarly captivated with it.\nThus the inclination to laugh becomes uncontrollable, when the solemnity\nand gravity of time, place, and circumstances, render it peculiarly\nimproper. Some species of general license, like that which inspired the\nancient Saturnalia, or the modern Carnival, has been commonly indulged\nto the people at all times and in almost all countries. But it was, I\nthink, peculiar to the Roman Catholic Church, that while they studied\nhow to render their church rites imposing and magnificent, by all that\npomp, music, architecture, and external display could add to them, they\nnevertheless connived, upon special occasions, at the frolics of the\nrude vulgar, who, in almost all Catholic countries, enjoyed, or at least\nassumed, the privilege of making: some Lord of the revels, who, under\nthe name of the Abbot of Unreason, the Boy Bishop, or the President\nof Fools, occupied the churches, profaned the holy places by a mock\nimitation of the sacred rites, and sung indecent parodies on hymns of\nthe church. The indifference of the clergy, even when their power was\ngreatest, to the indecent exhibitions which they always tolerated, and\nsometimes encouraged, forms a strong contrast to the sensitiveness with\nwhich they regarded any serious attempt, by preaching or writing, to\nimpeach any of the doctrines of the church. It could only be compared to\nthe singular apathy with which they endured, and often admired the gross\nnovels which Chaucer, Dunbar, Boccacio, Bandello, and others, composed\nupon the bad morals of the clergy. It seems as if the churchmen in both\ninstances had endeavoured to compromise with the laity, and allowed them\noccasionally to gratify their coarse humour by indecent satire, provided\nthey would abstain from any grave question concerning the foundation\nof the doctrines on which was erected such an immense fabric of\necclesiastical power.\n\nBut the sports thus licensed assumed a very different appearance, so\nsoon as the Protestant doctrines began to prevail; and the license which\ntheir forefathers had exercised in mere gaiety of heart, and without\nthe least intention of dishonouring religion by their frolics, were now\npersevered in by the common people as a mode of testifying their utter\ndisregard for the Roman priesthood and its ceremonies.\n\nI may observe, for example, the case of an apparitor sent to Borthwick\nfrom the Primate of Saint Andrews, to cite the lord of that castle, who\nwas opposed by an Abbot of Unreason, at whose command the officer of the\nspiritual court was appointed to be ducked in a mill-dam, and obliged to\neat up his parchment citation.\n\nThe reader may be amused with the following whimsical details of this\nincident, which took place in the castle of Borthwick, in the year 1517.\nIt appears, that in consequence of a process betwixt Master George\nHay de Minzeane and the Lord Borthwick, letters of excommunication\nhad passed against the latter, on account of the contumacy of certain\nwitnesses. William Langlands, an apparitor or macer (_bacularius_) of\nthe See of St Andrews, presented these letters to the curate of the\nchurch of Borthwick, requiring him to publish the same at the service of\nhigh mass. It seems that the inhabitants of the castle were at this\ntime engaged in the favourite sport of enacting the Abbot of Unreason,\na species of high jinks, in which a mimic prelate was elected, who, like\nthe Lord of Misrule in England, turned all sort of lawful authority, and\nparticularly the church ritual, into ridicule. This frolicsome person\nwith his retinue, notwithstanding of the apparitor's character, entered\nthe church, seized upon the primate's officer without hesitation, and,\ndragging him to the mill-dam on the south side of the castle, compelled\nhim to leap into the water. Not contented with this partial immersion,\nthe Abbot of Unreason pronounced, that Mr. William Langlands was not yet\nsufficiently bathed, and therefore caused his assistants to lay him\non his back in the stream, and duck him in the most satisfactory and\nperfect manner. The unfortunate apparitor was then conducted back to\nthe church, where, for his refreshment after his bath, the letters of\nexcommunication were torn to pieces, and steeped in a bowl of wine; the\nmock abbot being probably of opinion that a tough parchment was but\ndry eating, Langlands was compelled to eat the letters, and swallow\nthe wine, and dismissed by the Abbot of Unreason, with the comfortable\nassurance, that if any more such letters should arrive during the\ncontinuance of his office, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey should a' gang the same gate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d _i. e._\ngo the same road.\n\nA similar scene occurs betwixt a sumner of the Bishop of Rochester,\nand Harpool, the servant of Lord Cobham, in the old play of Sir John\nOldcastle, when the former compels the church-officer to eat his\ncitation. The dialogue, which may be found in the note, contains most\nof the jests which may be supposed, appropriate to such an extraordinary\noccasion:\n\n_Harpool_ Marry, sir, is, this process parchment?\n\n_Sumner._ Yes, marry is it.\n\n_Harpool._ And this seal wax?\n\n_Sumner._ It is so.\n\n_Harpool._ If this be parchment, and this be wax, eat you this parchment\nand wax, or I will make parchment of your skin, and beat your brains\ninto wax. Sirrah Sumner, despatch--devour, sirrah, devour.\n\n_Sumner._ I am my Lord of Rochester's sumner; I came to do my office,\nand thou shall answer it.\n\n_Harpool._ Sirrah, no railing, but, betake thyself to thy teeth. Thou\nshalt, eat no worse than thou bringest with thee. Thou bringest it for\nmy lord; and wilt thou bring my lord worse than thou wilt eat thyself?\n\n_Sumner._ Sir. I brought it not my lord to eat.\n\n_Harpool._ O, do you Sir me now? All's one for that; I'll make you eat\nit for bringing it.\n\n_Sumner._ I cannot eat it.\n\n_Harpool._ Can you not? 'Sblood, I'll beat you till you have a stomach!\n(_Beats him._)\n\n_Sumner._ Oh, hold, hold, good Mr. Servingman; I will eat it.\n\n_Harpool._ Be champing, be chewing, sir, or I will chew you, you rogue.\nTough wax is the purest of the honey.\n\n_Sumner._ The purest of the honey?--O Lord, sir, oh! oh!\n\n_Harpool._ Feed, feed; 'tis wholesome, rogue, wholesome. Cannot you,\nlike an honest sumner, walk with the devil your brother, to fetch in\nyour bailiff's rents, but you must come to a nobleman's house with\nprocess! If the seal were broad as the lead which covers Rochester\nChurch, thou shouldst eat it.\n\n_Sumner._ Oh, I am almost choked--I am almost choked!\n\n_Harpool._ Who's within there? Will you shame my lord? Is there no beer\nin the house? Butler, I say.\n\n    _Enter_ BUTLER.\n\n_Butler._ Here, here.\n\n_Harpool._ Give him beer. Tough old sheep skin's but dry meat.\n\n    _First Part of Sir John Oldcastle_, Act II. Scene I.]\n\n\nreplied the voice from without; and, from the laugh--which followed,\nit seemed as if there was something highly ludicrous couched under this\nreply.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know not, and seek not to know, your meaning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Abbot,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009csince it is probably a rude one. But begone, in the name of God, and\nleave his servants in peace. I speak this, as having lawful authority to\ncommand here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOpen the door,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said another rude voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand we will try titles with\nyou, Sir Monk, and show you a superior we must all obey.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBreak open the doors if he dallies any longer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a third, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand down\nwith the carrion monks who would bar us of our privilege!\u00e2\u0080\u009d A general\nshout followed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay, our privilege! our privilege! down with the\ndoors, and with the lurdane monks, if they make opposition!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe knocking was now exchanged for blows with great, hammers, to which\nthe doors, strong as they were, must soon have given way. But the Abbot,\nwho saw resistance would be in vain, and who did not wish to incense the\nassailants by an attempt at offering it, besought silence earnestly, and\nwith difficulty obtained a hearing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy children,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will\nsave you from committing a great sin. The porter will presently undo the\ngate--he is gone to fetch the keys--meantime I pray you to consider with\nyourselves, if you are in a state of mind to cross the holy threshold.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTillyvally for your papistry!\u00e2\u0080\u009d was answered from without; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe are in\nthe mood of the monks when they are merriest, and that is when they sup\nbeef-brewis for lanten-kail. So, if your porter hath not the gout, let\nhim come speedily, or we heave away readily.--Said I well, comrades?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBravely said, and it shall be as bravely done,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the multitude; and\nhad not the keys arrived at that moment, and the porter in hasty terror\nperformed his office, throwing open the great door, the populace would\nhave saved him the trouble. The instant he had done so, the affrighted\njanitor fled, like one who has drawn the bolts of a flood-gate, and\nexpects to be overwhelmed by the rushing inundation. The monks, with one\nconsent, had withdrawn themselves behind the Abbot, who alone kept his\nstation, about three yards from the entrance, showing no signs of fear\nor perturbation. His brethren--partly encouraged by his devotion, partly\nashamed to desert him, and partly animated by a sense of duty.--remained\nhuddled close together, at the back of their Superior. There was a loud\nlaugh and huzza when the doors were opened; but, contrary to what might\nhave been expected, no crowd of enraged assailants rushed into the\nchurch. On the contrary, there was a cry of \u00e2\u0080\u009cA halt!-a halt--to order,\nmy masters! and let the two reverend fathers greet each other, as\nbeseems them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe appearance of the crowd who were thus called to order, was grotesque\nin the extreme. It was composed of men, women, and children, ludicrously\ndisguised in various habits, and presenting groups equally diversified\nand grotesque. Here one fellow with a horse's head painted before him,\nand a tail behind, and the whole covered with a long foot-cloth, which\nwas supposed to hide the body of the animal, ambled, caracoled, pranced,\nand plunged, as he performed the celebrated part of the hobby-horse,\n\n[Footnote: This exhibition, the play-mare of Scotland, stood high among\nholyday gambols. It must be carefully separated from the wooden\nchargers which furnish out our nurseries. It gives rise to Hamlet's\nejaculation,--\n\n    But oh, but oh, the hobby-horse is forgot!\n\nThere is a very comic scene in Beaumont and Fletcher's play of \u00e2\u0080\u009cWoman\nPleased,\u00e2\u0080\u009d where Hope-on-high Bombye, a puritan cobbler, refuses to dance\nwith the hobby-horse. There was much difficulty and great variety in the\nmotions which the hobby-horse was expected to exhibit.\n\nThe learned Mr. Douce, who has contributed so much to the illustration\nof our theatrical antiquities, has given us a full account of this\npageant, and the burlesque horsemanship which it practised.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe hobby-horse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Mr. Douce, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas represented by a man equipped\nwith as much pasteboard as was sufficient to form the head and hinder\nparts of a horse, the quadrupedal defects being concealed by a long\nmantle or footcloth that nearly touched the ground. The former, on this\noccasion, exerted all his skill in burlesque horsemanship. In Sympson's\nplay of the Law-breakers, 1636, a miller personates the hobby-horse, and\nbeing angry that the Mayor of the city is put in competition with him,\nexclaims, 'Let the mayor play the hobby-horse among his brethren, an he\nwill; I hope our town-lads cannot want a hobby-horse. Have I practised\nmy reins, my careers, my prankers, my ambles, my false trots, my smooth\nambles, and Canterbury paces, and shall master mayor put me beside\nthe hobby-horse? Have I borrowed the fore-horse bells, his plumes, his\nbraveries; nay, had his mane new shorn and frizzled, and shall the mayor\nput me beside the hobby-horse?\u00e2\u0080\u009d --_Douce's Illustrations_, vol. II. p.\n468]\n\nso often alluded to in our ancient drama; and which still flourishes\non the stage in the battle that concludes Bayes's tragedy. To rival\nthe address and agility displayed by this character, another personage\nadvanced in the more formidable character of a huge dragon, with gilded\nwings, open jaws, and a scarlet tongue, cloven at the end, which made\nvarious efforts to overtake and devour a lad, dressed as the lovely\nSabaea, daughter of the King of Egypt, who fled before him; while a\nmartial Saint George, grotesquely armed with a goblet for a helmet, and\na spit for a lance, ever and anon interfered, and compelled the monster\nto relinquish his prey. A bear, a wolf, and one or two other wild\nanimals, played their parts with the discretion of Snug the joiner; for\nthe decided preference which they gave to the use of their hind legs,\nwas sufficient, without any formal annunciation, to assure the most\ntimorous spectators that they had to do with habitual bipeds. There was\na group of outlaws with Robin Hood and Little John at their head\n\n[Footnote: The representation of Robin Hood was the darling Maygame both\nin England and Scotland, and doubtless the favourite personification was\noften revived, when the Abbot of Unreason, or other pretences of frolic,\ngave an unusual decree of license.\n\nThe Protestant clergy, who had formerly reaped advantage from the\nopportunities which these sports afforded them of directing their own\nsatire and the ridicule of the lower orders against the Catholic church,\nbegan to find that, when these purposes were served, their favourite\npastimes deprived them of the wish to attend divine worship, and\ndisturbed the frame of mind in which it can be attended to advantage.\nThe celebrated Bishop Latimer gives a very _naive_ account of the manner\nin which, bishop as he was, he found himself compelled to give place to\nRobin Hood and his followers.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI came once myselfe riding on a journey homeward from London, and I\nsent word over night into the towne that I would preach there in the\nmorning, because it was holiday, and me thought it was a holidayes\nworke. The church stood in my way, and I took my horse and my company,\nand went thither, (I thought I should have found a great company in\nthe church,) and when I came there the church doore was fast locked. I\ntarryed there halfe an houre and more. At last the key was found, and\none of the parish comes to me and said,--'Sir, this is a busie day with\nus, we cannot hear you; it is Robin Hood's day. The parish are gone\nabroad to gather for Robin Hood. I pray you let them not.' I was faine\nthere to give place to Robin Hood. I thought my rochet should have been\nregarded, though I were not: but it would not serve, it was faine to\ngive place to Robin Hood's men. It is no laughing matter, my friends,\nit is a weeping matter, a heavie matter, a heavie matter. Under the\npretence for gathering for Robin Hood, a traytour, and a theif, to put\nout a preacher; to have his office lesse esteemed; to preferre Robin\nHood before the ministration of God's word; and all this hath come of\nunpreaching prelates. This realme hath been ill provided for, that it\nhath had such corrupt judgments in it, to prefer Robin Hood to God's\nword.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--_Bishop Latimer's sixth Sermon before King Edward_.\n\nWhile the English Protestants thus preferred the outlaw's pageant to the\npreaching of their excellent Bishop, the Scottish calvinistic clergy,\nwith the celebrated John Knox at their head, and backed by the authority\nof the magistrates of Edinburgh, who had of late been chosen exclusively\nfrom this party, found it impossible to control the rage of the\npopulace, when they attempted to deprive them of the privilege of\npresenting their pageant of Robin Hood.\n\n[Note on old Scottish spelling: leading y = modern 'th'; leading v =\nmodern 'u']\n\n(561) \u00e2\u0080\u009cVpon the xxi day of Junij.

Many persons were\nexcommunicated for this outrage, and not admitted to church ordinances\ntill they had made satisfaction.] --the best representation exhibited\nat the time; and no great wonder, since most of the actors were, by\nprofession, the banished men and thieves whom they presented. Other\nmasqueraders there were, of a less marked description. Men were\ndisguised as women, and women as men--children wore the dress of aged\npeople, and tottered with crutch-sticks in their hands, furred gowns\non their little backs, and caps on their round heads--while grandsires\nassumed the infantine tone as well as the dress of children. Besides\nthese, many had their faces painted, and wore their shirts over the\nrest of their dress; while coloured pasteboard and ribbons furnished out\ndecorations for others. Those who wanted all these properties,\nblacked their faces, and turned their jackets inside out; and thus the\ntransmutation of the whole assembly into a set of mad grotesque mummers,\nwas at once completed.\n\nThe pause which the masqueraders made, waiting apparently for some\nperson of the highest authority amongst them, gave those within the\nAbbey Church full time to observe all these absurdities. They were at no\nloss to comprehend their purpose and meaning.\n\nFew readers can be ignorant, that at an early period, and during the\nplenitude of her power, the Church of Rome not only connived at,\nbut even encouraged, such Saturnalian licenses as the inhabitants of\nKennaquhair and the neighbourhood had now in hand, and that the vulgar,\non such occasions, were not only permitted but encouraged by a number of\ngambols, sometimes puerile and ludicrous, sometimes immoral and profane,\nto indemnify themselves for the privations and penances imposed on them\nat other seasons. But, of all other topics for burlesque and ridicule,\nthe rites and ceremonial of the church itself were most frequently\nresorted to; and, strange to say, with the approbation of the clergy\nthemselves.\n\nWhile the hierarchy flourished in full glory, they do not appear to\nhave dreaded the consequences of suffering the people to become so\nirreverently familiar with things sacred; they then imagined the laity\nto be much in the condition of the labourer's horse, which does not\nsubmit to the bridle and the whip with greater reluctance, because, at\nrare intervals, he is allowed to frolic at large in his pasture, and\nfling out his heels in clumsy gambols at the master who usually drives\nhim. But, when times changed--when doubt of the Roman Catholic doctrine,\nand hatred of their priesthood, had possessed the reformed party, the\nclergy discovered, too late, that no small inconvenience arose from\nthe established practice of games and merry-makings, in which they\nthemselves, and all they held most sacred, were made the subject of\nridicule. It then became obvious to duller politicians than the Romish\nchurchmen, that the same actions have a very different tendency when\ndone in the spirit of sarcastic insolence and hatred, than when\nacted merely in exuberance of rude and uncontrollable spirits. They,\ntherefore, though of the latest, endeavoured, where they had any\nremaining influence, to discourage the renewal of these indecorous\nfestivities. In this particular, the Catholic clergy were joined by most\nof the reformed preachers, who were more shocked at the profanity and\nimmorality of many of these exhibitions, than disposed to profit by\nthe ridiculous light in which they placed the Church of Rome and her\nobservances. But it was long ere these scandalous and immoral sports\ncould be abrogated;--the rude multitude continued attached to their\nfavourite pastimes, and, both in England and Scotland, the mitre of the\nCatholic--the rochet of the reformed bishop--and the cloak and band of\nthe Calvinistic divine--were, in turn, compelled to give place to those\njocular personages, the Pope of Fools, the Boy-Bishop, and the Abbot of\nUnreason. [Footnote: From the interesting novel entitled Anastasius, it\nseems the same burlesque ceremonies were practised in the Greek Church.\n]\n\nIt was the latter personage who now, in full costume, made his approach\nto the great door of the church of St. Mary's, accoutred in such a\nmanner as to form a caricature, or practical parody, on the costume and\nattendants of the real Superior, whom he came to beard on the very day\nof his installation, in the presence of his clergy, and in the chancel\nof his church. The mock dignitary was a stout-made under-sized fellow,\nwhose thick squab form had been rendered grotesque by a supplemental\npaunch, well stuffed. He wore a mitre of leather, with the front like a\ngrenadier's cap, adorned with mock embroidery, and trinkets of tin. This\nsurmounted a visage, the nose of which was the most prominent feature,\nbeing of unusual size, and at least as richly gemmed as his head-gear.\nHis robe was of buckram, and his cope of canvass, curiously painted, and\ncut into open work. On one shoulder was fixed the painted figure of an\nowl; and he bore in the right hand his pastoral staff, and in the left a\nsmall mirror having a handle to it, thus resembling a celebrated\njester, whose adventures, translated into English, were whilom extremely\npopular, and which may still be procured in black letter, for about one\nsterling pound per leaf.\n\nThe attendants of this mock dignitary had their proper dresses and\nequipage, bearing the same burlesque resemblance to the officers of\nthe Convent which their leader did to the Superior. They followed their\nleader in regular procession, and the motley characters, which had\nwaited his arrival, now crowded into the church in his train, shouting\nas they came,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cA hall, a hall! for the venerable Father Howleglas, the\nlearned Monk of Misrule, and the Right Reverend Abbot of Unreason!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe discordant minstrelsy of every kind renewed its din; the boys\nshrieked and howled, and the men laughed and hallooed, and the women\ngiggled and screamed, and the beasts roared, and the dragon wallopped\nand hissed, and the hobby-horse neighed, pranced, and capered, and the\nrest frisked and frolicked, clashing their hobnailed shoes against the\npavement, till it sparkled with the marks of their energetic caprioles.\n\nIt was, in fine, a scene of ridiculous confusion, that deafened the ear,\nmade the eyes giddy, and must have altogether stunned any indifferent\nspectator; the monks, whom personal apprehension and a consciousness\nthat much of the popular enjoyment arose from the ridicule being\ndirected against them, were, moreover, little comforted by the\nreflection, that, bold in their disguise, the mummers who whooped and\ncapered around them, might, on slight provocation, turn their jest into\nearnest, or at least proceed to those practical pleasantries, which\nat all times arise so naturally out of the frolicsome and mischievous\ndisposition of the populace. They looked to their Abbot amid the tumult,\nwith such looks as landsmen cast upon the pilot when the storm is at the\nhighest--looks which express that they are devoid of all hope arising\nfrom their own exertions, and not very confident in any success likely\nto attend those of their Palinurus.\n\nThe Abbot himself seemed at a stand; he felt no fear, but he was\nsensible of the danger of expressing his rising indignation, which he\nwas scarcely able to suppress. He made a gesture with his hand as if\ncommanding silence, which was at first only replied to by redoubled\nshouts, and peals of wild laughter. When, however, the same motion,\nand as nearly in the same manner, had been made by Howleglas, it was\nimmediately obeyed by his riotous companions, who expected fresh food\nfor mirth in the conversation betwixt the real and mock Abbot, having\nno small confidence in the vulgar wit and impudence of their leader.\nAccordingly, they began to shout, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo it, fathers--to it I\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cFight\nmonk, fight madcap--Abbot against Abbot is fair play, and so is reason\nagainst unreason, and malice against monkery!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSilence, my mates!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Howleglas; \u00e2\u0080\u009ccannot two learned Fathers of\nthe Church hold communion together, but you must come here with your\nbear-garden whoop and hollo, as if you were hounding forth a mastiff\nupon a mad bull? I say silence! and let this learned Father and me\nconfer, touching matters affecting our mutual state and authority.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy children\u00e2\u0080\u009d--said Father Ambrose.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_My_ children too,--and happy children they are!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his burlesque\ncounterpart; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmany a wise child knows not its own father, and it is well\nthey have two to choose betwixt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf thou hast aught in thee, save scoffing and ribaldry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the real\nAbbot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cpermit me, for thine own soul's sake, to speak a few words to\nthese misguided men.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAught in me but scoffing, sayest thou?\u00e2\u0080\u009d retorted the Abbot of Unreason;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy, reverend brother, I have all that becomes mine office at this\ntime a-day--I have beef, ale, and brandy-wine, with other condiments not\nworth mentioning; and for speaking, man--why, speak away, and we will\nhave turn about, like honest fellows.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDuring this discussion the wrath of Magdalen Graeme had risen to the\nuttermost; she approached the Abbot, and placing herself by his side,\nsaid in a low and yet distinct tone-\u00e2\u0080\u009cWake and arouse thee, Father--the\nsword of Saint Peter is in thy hand--strike and avenge Saint Peter's\npatrimony!--Bind them in the chains which, being riveted by the church\non earth, are riveted in Heaven--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPeace, sister!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot; \u00e2\u0080\u009clet not their madness destroy our\ndiscretion--I pray thee, peace, and let me do mine office. It is the\nfirst, peradventure it may be the last time, I shall be called on to\ndischarge it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, my holy brother!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Howleglas, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI rede you, take the holy\nsister's advice--never throve convent without woman's counsel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPeace, vain man!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand you, my brethren--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, nay!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot of Unreason, \u00e2\u0080\u009cno speaking to the lay people,\nuntil you have conferred with your brother of the cowl. I swear by bell,\nbook, and candle, that no one of my congregation shall listen to one\nword you have to say; so you had as well address yourself to me who\nwill.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTo escape a conference so ludicrous, the Abbot again attempted an appeal\nto what respectful feelings might yet remain amongst the inhabitants of\nthe Halidome, once so devoted to their spiritual Superiors. Alas!\nthe Abbot of Unreason had only to nourish his mock crosier, and the\nwhooping, the hallooing, and the dancing, were renewed with a vehemence\nwhich would have defied the lungs of Stentor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now, my mates,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot of Unreason, \u00e2\u0080\u009conce again dight your\ngabs and be hushed-let us see if the Cock of Kennaquhair will fight or\nflee the pit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was again a dead silence of expectation, of which Father Ambrose\navailed himself to address his antagonist, seeing plainly that he could\ngain an audience on no other terms. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWretched man!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009chast thou\nno better employment for thy carnal wit, than to employ it in leading\nthese blind and helpless creatures into the pit of utter darkness?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTruly, my brother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Howleglas, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can see little difference\nbetwixt your employment and mine, save that you make a sermon of a jest,\nand I make a jest of a sermon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnhappy being,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwho hast no better subject of\npleasantry than that which should make thee tremble--no sounder jest\nthan thine own sins, and no better objects for laughter than those who\ncan absolve thee from the guilt of them!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVerily, my reverend brother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the mock Abbot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat you say\nmight be true, if, in laughing at hypocrites, I meant to laugh at\nreligion.--Oh, it is a precious thing to wear a long dress, with a\ngirdle and a cowl--we become a holy pillar of Mother Church, and a boy\nmust not play at ball against the walls for fear of breaking a painted\nwindow!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd will you, my friends,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot, looking round and speaking\nwith a vehemence which secured him a tranquil audience for some\ntime,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cwill you suffer a profane buffoon, within the very church of\nGod, to insult his ministers? Many of you--all of you, perhaps--have\nlived under my holy predecessors, who were called upon to rule in this\nchurch where I am called upon to suffer. If you have worldly goods, they\nare their gift; and, when you scorned not to accept better gifts--the\nmercy and forgiveness of the church--were they not ever at your\ncommand?--did we not pray while you were jovial--wake while you slept?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSome of the good wives of the Halidome were wont to say so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nthe Abbot of Unreason; but his jest met in this instance but slight\napplause, and Father Ambrose, having gained a moment's attention,\nhastened to improve it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand is this grateful--is it seemly--is it honest--to\nassail with scorn a few old men, from whose predecessors you hold all,\nand whose only wish is to die in peace among these fragments of what was\nonce the light of the land, and whose daily prayer is, that they may be\nremoved ere that hour comes when the last spark shall be extinguished,\nand the land left in the darkness which it has chosen rather than light?\nWe have not turned against you the edge of the spiritual sword, to\nrevenge our temporal persecution; the tempest of your wrath hath\ndespoiled us of land, and deprived us almost of our daily food, but we\nhave not repaid it with the thunders of excommunication--we only pray\nyour leave to live and die within the church which is our own, invoking\nGod, our Lady, and the Holy Saints to pardon your sins, and our own,\nundisturbed by scurril buffoonery and blasphemy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis speech, so different in tone and termination from that which the\ncrowd had expected, produced an effect upon their feelings unfavourable\nto the prosecution of their frolic. The morris-dancers stood still--the\nhobby-horse surceased his capering--pipe and tabor were mute, and\n\u00e2\u0080\u009csilence, like a heavy cloud,\u00e2\u0080\u009d seemed to descend on the once noisy\nrabble. Several of the beasts were obviously moved to compunction; the\nbear could not restrain his sobs, and a huge fox was observed to wipe\nhis eyes with his tail. But in especial the dragon, lately so formidably\nrampant, now relaxed the terror of his claws, uncoiled his tremendous\nrings, and grumbled out of his fiery throat in a repentant tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy\nthe mass, I thought no harm in exercising our old pastime, but an I had\nthought the good Father would have taken it so to heart, I would as soon\nhave played your devil, as your dragon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn this momentary pause, the Abbot stood amongst the miscellaneous and\ngrotesque forms by which he was surrounded, triumphant as Saint Anthony,\nin Callot's Temptations; but Howleglas would not so resign his purpose.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd how now, my masters!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis this fair play or no? Have you\nnot chosen me Abbot of Unreason, and is it lawful for any of you to\nlisten to common sense to-day? Was I not formally elected by you in\nsolemn chapter, held in Luckie Martin's change-house, and will you now\ndesert me, and give up your old pastime and privilege? Play out the\nplay--and he that speaks the next word of sense or reason, or bids us\nthink or consider, or the like of that, which befits not the day, I will\nhave him solemnly ducked in the mill-dam!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe rabble, mutable as usual, huzzaed, the pipe and tabor struck up, the\nhobby-horse pranced, the beasts roared, and even the repentant dragon\nbegan again to coil up his spires, and prepare himself for fresh\ngambols. But the Abbot might still have overcome, by his eloquence and\nhis entreaties, the malicious designs of the revellers, had not Dame\nMagdalen Graeme given loose to the indignation which she had long\nsuppressed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cScoffers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand men of Belial--Blasphemous heretics, and\ntruculent tyrants----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour patience, my sister, I entreat and I command you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009clet me do my duty--disturb me not in mine office!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Dame Magdalen continued to thunder forth her threats in the name\nof Popes and Councils, and in the name of every Saint, from St. Michael\ndownward.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy comrades!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot of Unreason, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis good dame hath not\nspoken a single word of reason, and therein may esteem herself free from\nthe law. But what she spoke was meant for reason, and, therefore, unless\nshe confesses and avouches all which she has said to be nonsense, it\nshall pass for such, so far as to incur our statutes. Wherefore, holy\ndame, pilgrim, or abbess, or whatever thou art, be mute with thy mummery\nor beware the mill-dam. We will have neither spiritual nor temporal\nscolds in our Diocese of Unreason!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs he spoke thus, he extended his hand towards the old woman, while his\nfollowers shouted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cA doom--a doom!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and prepared to second his purpose,\nwhen lo! it was suddenly frustrated. Roland Graeme had witnessed with\nindignation the insults offered to his old spiritual preceptor, but yet\nhad wit enough to reflect he could render him no assistance, but might\nwell, by ineffective interference, make matters worse. But when he saw\nhis aged relative in danger of personal violence, he gave way to the\nnatural impetuosity of his temper, and, stepping forward, struck his\nponiard into the body of the Abbot of Unreason, whom the blow instantly\nprostrated on the pavement.\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Fifteenth.\n\n\n  As when in tumults rise the ignoble crowd,\n  Mad are their motions, and their tongues are loud,\n  And stones and brands in rattling furies fly,\n  And all the rustic arms which fury can supply--\n  Then if some grave and pious man appear,\n  They hush their noise, and lend a listening ear.\n                                  DRYDEN'S VIRGIL\n\nA dreadful shout of vengeance was raised by the revellers, whose sport\nwas thus so fearfully interrupted; but for an instant, the want of\nweapons amongst the multitude, as well as the inflamed features and\nbrandished poniard of Roland Graeme, kept them at bay, while the Abbot,\nhorror-struck at the violence, implored, with uplifted hands, pardon\nfor blood-shed committed within the sanctuary. Magdalen Graeme alone\nexpressed triumph in the blow her descendant had dealt to the scoffer,\nmixed, however, with a wild and anxious expression of terror for her\ngrandson's safety. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet him perish,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin his blasphemy--let\nhim die on the holy pavement which he has insulted!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut the rage of the multitude, the grief of the Abbot, the exultation of\nthe enthusiastic Magdalen, were all mistimed and unnecessary. Howleglas,\nmortally wounded as he was supposed to be, sprung alertly up from the\nfloor, calling aloud, \u00e2\u0080\u009cA miracle, a miracle, my masters! as brave a\nmiracle as ever was wrought in the kirk of Kennaquhair. And I charge\nyou, my masters, as your lawfully chosen Abbot, that you touch no one\nwithout my command--You, wolf and bear, will guard this pragmatic youth,\nbut without hurting him--And you, reverend brother, will, with your\ncomrades, withdraw to your cells; for our conference has ended like all\nconferences, leaving each of his own mind, as before; and if we\nfight, both you, and your brethren, and the Kirk, will have the worst\non't--Wherefore, pack up you pipes and begone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe hubbub was beginning again to awaken, but still Father Ambrose\nhesitated, as uncertain to what path his duty called him, whether to\nface out the present storm, or to reserve himself for a better moment.\nHis brother of Unreason observed his difficulty, and said, in a tone\nmore natural and less affected than that with which he had hitherto\nsustained his character, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe came hither, my good sir, more in mirth\nthan in mischief--our bark is worse than our bite--and, especially, we\nmean you no personal harm--wherefore, draw off while the play is good;\nfor it is ill whistling for a hawk when she is once on the soar, and\nworse to snatch the quarry from the ban-dog--Let these fellows once\nbegin their brawl, and it will be too much for madness itself, let alone\nthe Abbot of Unreason, to bring them back to the lure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe brethren crowded around Father Ambrosius, and joined in urging\nhim to give place to the torrent. The present revel was, they said,\nan ancient custom which his predecessors had permitted, and old\nFather Nicholas himself had played the dragon in the days of the Abbot\nIngelram.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd we now reap the fruit of the seed which they have so unadvisedly\nsown,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ambrosius; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey taught men to make a mock of what is\nholy, what wonder that the descendants of scoffers become robbers\nand plunderers? But be it as you list, my brethren--move towards the\ndortour--And you, dame, I command you, by the authority which I have\nover you, and by your respect for that youth's safety, that you go with\nus without farther speech--Yet, stay--what are your intentions towards\nthat youth whom you detain prisoner?--Wot ye,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, addressing\nHowleglas in a stern tone of voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat he bears the livery of the\nHouse of Avenel? They who fear not the anger of Heaven, may at least\ndread the wrath of man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCumber not yourself concerning him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Howleglas, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe know right\nwell who and what he is.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me pray,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot, in a tone of entreaty, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you do him\nno wrong for the rash deed--which he attempted in his imprudent zeal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI say, cumber not yourself about it, father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Howleglas, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut\nmove off with your train, male and female, or I will not undertake to\nsave yonder she-saint from the ducking-stool--And as for bearing of\nmalice, my stomach has no room for it; it is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, clapping\nhis hand on his portly belly, \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoo well bumbasted out with straw and\nbuckram--gramercy to them both--they kept out that madcap's dagger as\nwell as a Milan corslet could have done.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn fact, the home-driven poniard of Roland Graeme had lighted upon the\nstuffing of the fictitious paunch, which the Abbot of Unreason wore as a\npart of his characteristic dress, and it was only the force of the blow\nwhich had prostrated that reverend person on the ground for a moment.\n\nSatisfied in some degree by this man's assurances, and compelled--to\ngive way to superior force, the Abbot Ambrosius retired from the Church\nat the head of the monks, and left the court free for the revellers\nto work their will. But, wild and wilful as these rioters were, they\naccompanied the retreat of the religionists with none of those shouts\nof contempt and derision with which they had at first hailed them. The\nAbbot's discourse had affected some of them with remorse, others with\nshame, and all with a transient degree of respect. They remained\nsilent until the last monk had disappeared through the side-door which\ncommunicated with their dwelling-place, and even then it cost\nsome exhortations on the part of Howleglas, some caprioles of the\nhobby-horse, and some wallops of the dragon, to rouse once more the\nrebuked spirit of revelry.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd how now, my masters?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot of Unreason; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand wherefore\nlook on me with such blank Jack-a-Lent visages? Will you lose your old\npastime for an old wife's tale of saints and purgatory? Why, I thought\nyou would have made all split long since--Come, strike up, tabor and\nharp, strike up, fiddle and rebeck--dance and be merry to-day, and\nlet care come to-morrow. Bear and wolf, look to your prisoner--prance,\nhobby--hiss, dragon, and halloo, boys--we grow older every moment we\nstand idle, and life is too short to be spent in playing mumchance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis pithy exhortation was attended with the effect desired. They\nfumigated the Church with burnt wool and feathers instead of incense,\nput foul water into the holy-water basins, and celebrated a parody on\nthe Church-service, the mock Abbot officiating at the altar; they sung\nludicrous and indecent parodies, to the tunes of church hymns; they\nviolated whatever vestments or vessels belonging to the Abbey they could\nlay their hands upon; and, playing every freak which the whim of the\nmoment could suggest to their wild caprice, at length they fell to\nmore lasting deeds of demolition, pulled down and destroyed some carved\nwood-work, dashed out the painted windows which had escaped former\nviolence, and in their rigorous search after sculpture dedicated to\nidolatry, began to destroy what ornaments yet remained entire upon the\ntombs, and around the cornices of the pillars.\n\nThe spirit of demolition, like other tastes, increases by indulgence;\nfrom these lighter attempts at mischief, the more tumultuous part of the\nmeeting began to meditate destruction on a more extended scale--\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\nus heave it down altogether, the old crow's nest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d became a general cry\namong them; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit has served the Pope and his rooks too long;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and up\nthey struck a ballad which was then popular among the lower classes.\n[Footnote: These rude rhymes are taken, with some trifling alterations,\nfrom a ballad called Trim-go-trix. It occurs in a singular collection,\nentitled; \u00e2\u0080\u009cA Compendious Book of Godly and Spiritual Songs, collected\nout of sundrie parts of the Scripture, with sundry of other ballatis\nchanged out of prophane sanges for avoyding of sin and harlotrie, with\nAugmentation of sundrie Gude and Godly Ballates.

Take the leprosy out of your flesh, before you speak of purifying\nstone walls--abate your insolent license, which leads but to idle vanity\nand sinful excess; and know, that what you now practise, is one of\nthe profane and unseemly sports introduced by the priests of Rome\nthemselves, to mislead and to brutify the souls which fell into their\nnet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMarry come up--are you there with your bears?\u00e2\u0080\u009d muttered the dragon,\nwith a draconic sullenness, which was in good keeping with his\ncharacter, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe had as good have been Romans still, if we are to have no\nfreedom in our pastimes!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDost thou reply to me so?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Halbert Glendinning; \u00e2\u0080\u009cor is there\nany pastime in grovelling on the ground there like a gigantic\nkail-worm?--Get out of thy painted case, or, by my knighthood, I will\ntreat you like the beast and reptile you have made yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBeast and reptile?\u00e2\u0080\u009d retorted the offended dragon, \u00e2\u0080\u009csetting aside your\nknighthood, I hold myself as well a born man as thyself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Knight made no answer in words, but bestowed two such blows with the\nbutt of his lance on the petulant dragon, that had not the hoops which\nconstituted the ribs of the machine been pretty strong, they would\nhardly have saved those of the actor from being broken. In all haste the\nmasker crept out of his disguise, unwilling to abide a third buffet from\nthe lance of the enraged Knight. And when the ex-dragon stood on the\nfloor of the church, he presented to Halbert Glendinning the well-known\ncountenance of Dan of the Howlet-hirst, an ancient comrade of his own,\nere fate had raised him so high above the rank to which he was born.\nThe clown looked sulkily upon the Knight, as if to upbraid him for his\nviolence towards an old acquaintance, and Glendinning's own good-nature\nreproached him for the violence he had acted upon him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI did wrong to strike thee,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDan; but in truth, I knew thee\nnot--thou wert ever a mad fellow--come to Avenel Castle, and we shall\nsee how my hawks fly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd if we show him not falcons that will mount as merrily as rockets,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said the Abbot of Unreason, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would your honour laid as hard on my\nbones as you did on his even now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow now, Sir Knave,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Knight, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand what has brought you\nhither?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Abbot, hastily ridding himself of the false nose which mystified\nhis physiognomy, and the supplementary belly which made up his disguise,\nstood before his master in his real character, of Adam Woodcock, the\nfalconer of Avenel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow, varlet!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Knight; \u00e2\u0080\u009chast thou dared to come here and\ndisturb the very house my brother was dwelling in?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd it was even for that reason, craving your honour's pardon, that I\ncame hither--for I heard the country was to be up to choose an Abbot of\nUnreason, and sure, thought I, I that can sing, dance, leap backwards\nover a broadsword, and am as good a fool as ever sought promotion, have\nall chance of carrying the office; and if I gain my election, I may\nstand his honour's brother in some stead, supposing things fall roughly\nout at the Kirk of Saint Mary's.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThou art but a cogging knave,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Halbert, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand well I wot, that\nlove of ale and brandy, besides the humour of riot and frolic, would\ndraw thee a mile, when love of my house would not bring thee a yard.\nBut, go to--carry thy roisterers elsewhere--to the alehouse if they\nlist, and there are crowns to pay your charges--make out the day's\nmadness without doing more mischief, and be wise men to-morrow--and\nhereafter learn to serve a good cause better than by acting like\nbuffoons or ruffians.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nObedient to his master's mandate, the falconer was collecting\nhis discouraged followers, and whispering into their ears--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAway,\naway--_tace_ is Latin for a candle--never mind the good Knight's\npuritanism--we will play the frolic out over a stand of double ale in\nDame Martin the Brewster's barn-yard--draw off, harp and tabor--bagpipe\nand drum--mum till you are out of the church-yard, then let the welkin\nring again--move on, wolf and bear--keep the hind legs till you cross\nthe kirk-stile, and then show yourselves beasts of mettle--what devil\nsent him here to spoil our holiday!--but anger him not, my hearts; his\nlance is no goose-feather, as Dan's ribs can tell.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy my soul,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dan, \u00e2\u0080\u009chad it been another than my ancient comrade, I\nwould have made my father's old fox [Footnote: _Fox_, An old-fashioned\nbroadsword was often so called.] fly about his ears!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHush! hush! man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Adam Woodcock, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot a word that way, as you\nvalue the safety of your bones--what man? we must take a clink as it\npasses, so it is not bestowed in downright ill-will.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I will take no such thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dan of the Howlet-hirst, suddenly\nresisting the efforts of Woodcock, who was dragging him out of the\nchurch; when the quick military eye of Sir Halbert Glendinning detecting\nRoland Graeme betwixt his two guards, the Knight exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo ho!\nfalconer,--Woodcock,--knave, hast thou brought my Lady's page in mine\nown livery, to assist at this hopeful revel of thine, with your wolves\nand bears? Since you were at such mummings, you might, if you would,\nhave at least saved the credit of my household, by dressing him up as a\njackanapes--bring him hither, fellows!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAdam Woodcock was too honest and downright, to permit blame to light\nupon the youth, when it was undeserved. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI swear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cby Saint\nMartin of Bullions--\u00e2\u0080\u009d [Footnote: The Saint Swithin, or weeping Saint of\nScotland. If his festival (fourth July) prove wet, forty days of rain\nare expected.]\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what hast thou to do with Saint Martin?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, little enough, sir, unless when he sends such rainy days that we\ncannot fly a hawk--but I say to your worshipful knighthood, that as I\nam, a true man----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs you are a false varlet, had been the better obtestation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, if your knighthood allows me not to speak,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Adam, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can hold\nmy tongue--but the boy came not hither by my bidding, for all that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut to gratify his own malapert pleasure, I warrant me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir\nHalbert Glendinning--\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome hither, young springald, and tell me whether\nyou have your mistress's license to be so far absent from the castle, or\nto dishonour my livery by mingling in such a May-game?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir Halbert Glendinning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Roland Graeme with steadiness, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nhave obtained the permission, or rather the commands, of your lady, to\ndispose of my time hereafter according to my own pleasure. I have been a\nmost unwilling spectator of this May-game, since it is your pleasure so\nto call it; and I only wear your livery until I can obtain clothes which\nbear no such badge of servitude.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow am I to understand this, young man?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Halbert Glendinning;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cspeak plainly, for I am no reader of riddles.--That my lady favoured\nthee, I know. What hast thou done to disoblige her, and occasion thy\ndismissal?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing to speak of,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Adam Woodcock, answering for the boy--\u00e2\u0080\u009ca\nfoolish quarrel with me, which was more foolishly told over again to\nmy honoured lady, cost the poor boy his place. For my part, I will say\nfreely, that I was wrong from beginning to end, except about the washing\nof the eyas's meat. There I stand to it that I was right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith that, the good-natured falconer repeated to his master the whole\nhistory of the squabble which had brought Roland Graeme into disgrace\nwith his mistress, but in a manner so favourable for the page, that Sir\nHalbert could not but suspect his generous motive.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThou art a good-natured fellow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAdam Woodcock.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs ever had falcon upon fist,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Adam; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand, for that matter, so is\nMaster Roland; but, being half a gentleman by his office, his blood is\nsoon up, and so is mine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Halbert, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbe it as it will, my lady has acted hastily,\nfor this was no great matter of offence to discard the lad whom she\nhad trained up for years; but he, I doubt not, made it worse by his\nprating--it jumps well with a purpose, however, which I had in my mind.\nDraw off these people, Woodcock,--and you, Roland Graeme, attend me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe page followed him in silence into the Abbot's house, where, stepping\ninto the first apartment which he found open, he commanded one of his\nattendants to let his brother, Master Edward Glendinning, know that he\ndesired to speak with him. The men-at-arms went gladly off to join their\ncomrade, Adam Woodcock, and the jolly crew whom he had assembled at Dame\nMartin's, the hostler's wife, and the Page and Knight were left alone in\nthe apartment. Sir Halbert Glendinning paced the floor for a moment in\nsilence and then thus addressed his attendant--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThou mayest have remarked, stripling, that I have but seldom\ndistinguished thee by much notice;--I see thy colour rises, but do not\nspeak till thou nearest me out. I say I have never much distinguished\nthee, not because I did not see that in thee which I might well have\npraised, but because I saw something blameable, which such praises might\nhave made worse. Thy mistress, dealing according to her pleasure in her\nown household, as no one had better reason or title, had picked thee\nfrom the rest, and treated thee more like a relation than a domestic;\nand if thou didst show some vanity and petulance under such distinction,\nit were injustice not to say that thou hast profited both in thy\nexercises and in thy breeding, and hast shown many sparkles of a gentle\nand manly spirit. Moreover, it were ungenerous, having bred thee up\nfreakish and fiery, to dismiss thee to want or wandering, for showing\nthat very peevishness and impatience of discipline which arose from thy\ntoo delicate nurture. Therefore, and for the credit of my own household,\nI am determined to retain thee in my train, until I can honourably\ndispose of thee elsewhere, with a fair prospect of thy going through the\nworld with credit to the house that brought thee up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIf there was something in Sir Halbert Glendinning's speech which\nflattered Roland's pride, there was also much that, according to his\nmode of thinking, was an alloy to the compliment. And yet his conscience\ninstantly told him that he ought to accept, with grateful deference, the\noffer which was made him by the husband of his kind protectress; and his\nprudence, however slender, could not but admit he should enter the world\nunder very different auspices as a retainer of Sir Halbert Glendinning,\nso famed for wisdom, courage, and influence, from those under which\nhe might partake the wanderings, and become an agent in the visionary\nschemes, for such they appeared to him, of Magdalen, his relative.\nStill, a strong reluctance to re-enter a service from which he had been\ndismissed with contempt, almost counterbalanced these considerations.\n\nSir Halbert looked on the youth with surprise, and resumed--\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou seem to\nhesitate, young man. Are your own prospects so inviting, that you should\npause ere you accept those which I should offer to you? or, must I\nremind you that, although you have offended your benefactress, even to\nthe point of her dismissing you, yet I am convinced, the knowledge that\nyou have gone unguided on your own wild way, into a world so disturbed\nas ours of Scotland, cannot, in the upshot, but give her sorrow and\npain; from which it is, in gratitude, your duty to preserve her, no less\nthan it is in common wisdom your duty to accept my offered protection,\nfor your own sake, where body and soul are alike endangered, should you\nrefuse it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland Graeme replied in a respectful tone, but at the same time with\nsome spirit, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not ungrateful for such countenance as has been\nafforded me by the Lord of Avenel, and I am glad to learn, for the\nfirst time, that I have not had the misfortune to be utterly beneath his\nobservation, as I had thought--And it is only needful to show me how\nI can testify my duty and my gratitude towards my early and constant\nbenefactress with my life's hazard, and I will gladly peril it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He\nstopped.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese are but words, young man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Glendinning, \u00e2\u0080\u009clarge\nprotestations are often used to supply the place of effectual service.\nI know nothing in which the peril of your life can serve the Lady of\nAvenel; I can only say, she will be pleased to learn you have adopted\nsome course which may ensure the safety of your person, and the weal\nof your soul--What ails you, that you accept not that safety when it is\noffered you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy only relative who is alive,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cat least the only\nrelative whom I have ever seen, has rejoined me since I was dismissed\nfrom the Castle of Avenel, and I must consult with her whether I can\nadopt the line to which you now call me, or whether her increasing\ninfirmities, or the authority which she is entitled to exercise over me,\nmay not require me to abide with her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere is this relation?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Halbert Glendinning.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn this house,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the page.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo then, and seek her out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Knight of Avenel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmore than meet\nit is that thou shouldst have her approbation, yet worse than foolish\nwould she show herself in denying it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland left the apartment to seek for his grandmother; and, as he\nretreated, the Abbot entered.\n\nThe two brothers met as brothers who loved each other fondly, yet\nmeet rarely together. Such indeed was the case. Their mutual affection\nattached them to each other; but in every pursuit, habit or sentiment,\nconnected with the discords of the times, the friend and counsellor of\nMurray stood opposed to the Roman Catholic priest; nor, indeed, could\nthey have held very much society together, without giving cause of\noffence and suspicion to their confederates on each side. After a close\nembrace on the part of both, and a welcome on that of the Abbot, Sir\nHalbert Glendinning expressed his satisfaction that he had come in time\nto appease the riot raised by Howleglas and his tumultuous followers.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd yet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen I look on your garments, brother Edward, I\ncannot help thinking there still remains an Abbot of Unreason within the\nbounds of the Monastery.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd wherefore carp at my garments, brother Halbert?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cit is the spiritual armour of my calling, and, as such, beseems me as\nwell as breastplate and baldric becomes your own bosom.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, but there were small wisdom, methinks, in putting on armour where\nwe have no power to fight; it is but a dangerous temerity to defy the\nfoe whom we cannot resist.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor that, my brother, no one can answer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cuntil the\nbattle be fought; and, were it even as you say, methinks a brave man,\nthough desperate of victory, would rather desire to fight and fall, than\nto resign sword and shield on some mean and dishonourable composition\nwith his insulting antagonist. But, let not you and I make discord of\na theme on which we cannot agree, but rather stay and partake, though a\nheretic, of my admission feast. You need not fear, my brother, that your\nzeal for restoring the primitive discipline of the church will, on this\noccasion, be offended with the rich profusion of a conventual banquet.\nThe days of our old friend Abbot Boniface are over; and the Superior of\nSaint Mary's has neither forests nor fishings, woods nor pastures, nor\ncorn-fields;--neither flocks nor herds, bucks nor wild-fowl--granaries\nof wheat, nor storehouses of oil and wine, of ale and of mead. The\nrefectioner's office is ended; and such a meal as a hermit in romance\ncan offer to a wandering knight, is all we have to set before you. But,\nif you will share it with us, we shall eat it with a cheerful heart,\nand thank you, my brother, for your timely protection against these rude\nscoffers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dearest brother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Knight, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit grieves me deeply I cannot\nabide with you; but it would sound ill for us both were one of the\nreformed congregation to sit down at your admission feast; and, if I\ncan ever have the satisfaction of affording you effectual protection,\nit will be much owing to my remaining unsuspected of countenancing or\napproving your religious rites and ceremonies. It will demand whatever\nconsideration I can acquire among my own friends, to shelter the bold\nman, who, contrary to law and the edicts of parliament, has dared to\ntake up the office of Abbot of Saint Mary's.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrouble not yourself with the task, my brother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Father\nAmbrosius. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would lay down my dearest blood to know that you defended\nthe church for the church's sake; but, while you remain unhappily her\nenemy, I would not that you endangered your own safety, or diminished\nyour own comforts, for the sake of my individual protection.--But who\ncomes hither to disturb the few minutes of fraternal communication which\nour evil fate allows us?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe door of the apartment opened as the Abbot spoke, and Dame Magdalen\nentered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho is this woman?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Halbert Glendinning, somewhat sternly,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cand what does she want?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat you know me not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the matron, \u00e2\u0080\u009csignifies little; I come\nby your own order, to give my free consent that the stripling, Roland\nGraeme, return to your service; and, having said so, I cumber you no\nlonger with my presence. Peace be with you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She turned to go away, but\nwas stopped by inquiries of Sir Halbert Glendinning.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho are you?--what are you?--and why do you not await to make me\nanswer?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhile yet I belonged to the world, a matron of no\nvulgar name; now I am Magdalen, a poor pilgrimer, for the sake of Holy\nKirk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYea,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Halbert, \u00e2\u0080\u009cart thou a Catholic? I thought my dame said\nthat Roland Graeme came of reformed kin.'\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHis father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the matron, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas a heretic, or rather one who\nregarded neither orthodoxy or heresy--neither the temple of the church\nor of antichrist. I, too, for the sins of the times make sinners, have\nseemed to conform to your unhallowed rites--but I had my dispensation\nand my absolution.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see, brother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Halbert, with a smile of meaning towards\nhis brother, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat we accuse you not altogether without grounds of\nmental equivocation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy brother, you do us injustice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Abbot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis woman,\nas her bearing may of itself warrant you, is not in her perfect mind.\nThanks, I must needs say, to the persecution of your marauding barons,\nand of your latitudinarian clergy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not dispute the point,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Halbert; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe evils of the time\nare unhappily so numerous, that both churches may divide them, and have\nenow to spare.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he leaned from the window of the apartment,\nand winded his bugle.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy do you sound your horn, my brother?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe have spent\nbut few minutes together.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the elder brother, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand even these few have been sullied\nby disagreement. I sound to horse, my brother--the rather that, to avert\nthe consequences of this day's rashness on your part, requires hasty\nefforts on mine.--Dame, you will oblige me by letting your young\nrelative know that we mount instantly. I intend not that he shall return\nto Avenel with me--it would lead to new quarrels betwixt him and my\nhousehold; at least to taunts which his proud heart could ill brook,\nand my wish is to do him kindness. He shall, therefore, go forward to\nEdinburgh with one of my retinue, whom I shall send back to say what\nhas chanced here.--You seem rejoiced at this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, fixing his eyes\nkeenly on Magdalen Graeme, who returned his gaze with calm indifference.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would rather,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat Roland, a poor and friendless orphan,\nwere the jest of the world at large, than of the menials at Avenel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFear not, dame--he shall be scorned by neither,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Knight.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt may be,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied--\u00e2\u0080\u009cit may well be--but I will trust more to his\nown bearing than to your countenance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She left the room as she spoke.\n\nThe Knight looked after her as she departed, but turned instantly to his\nbrother, and expressing, in the most affectionate terms, his wishes for\nhis welfare and happiness, craved his leave to depart. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy knaves,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u009care too busy at the ale-stand, to leave their revelry for the\nempty breath of a bugle-horn.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have freed them from higher restraint, Halbert,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the\nAbbot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand therein taught them to rebel against your own.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFear not that, Edward,\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Halbert, who never gave his brother\nhis monastic name of Ambrosius; \u00e2\u0080\u009cnone obey the command of real duty so\nwell as those who are free from the observance of slavish bondage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe was turning to depart, when the Abbot said,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet us not yet part, my\nbrother--here comes some light refreshment. Leave not the house which I\nmust now call mine, till force expel me from it, until you have at least\nbroken bread with me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe poor lay brother, the same who acted as porter, now entered the\napartment, bearing some simple refreshment, and a flask of wine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe had\nfound it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said with officious humility, \u00e2\u0080\u009cby rummaging through every\nnook of the cellar.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Knight filled a small silver cup, and, quaffing it off, asked his\nbrother to pledge him, observing, the wine was Bacharac, of the first\nvintage, and great age.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the poor lay brother, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit came out of the nook which old\nbrother Nicholas, (may his soul be happy!) was wont to call Abbot\nIngelram's corner; and Abbot Ingelram was bred at the Convent of\nWurtzburg, which I understand to be near where that choice wine grows.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrue, my reverend sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Halbert; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand therefore I entreat my\nbrother and you to pledge me in a cup of this orthodox vintage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe thin old porter looked with a wishful glance towards the Abbot. \u00e2\u0080\u009c_Do\nveniam_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his Superior; and the old man seized, with a trembling\nhand, a beverage to which he had been long unaccustomed; drained the cup\nwith protracted delight, as if dwelling on the flavour and perfume, and\nset it down with a melancholy smile and shake of the head, as if bidding\nadieu in future to such delicious potations. The brothers smiled. But\nwhen Sir Halbert motioned to the Abbot to take up his cup and do him\nreason, the Abbot, in turn, shook his head, and replied--\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is no\nday for the Abbot of Saint Mary's to eat the fat and drink the sweat.\nIn water from our Lady's well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, filling a cup with the limpid\nelement, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish you, brother, all happiness, and above all, a true\nsight of your spiritual errors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd to you, my beloved Edward,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Glendinning, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish the free\nexercise of your own free reason, and the discharge of more important\nduties than are connected with the idle name which you have so rashly\nassumed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe brothers parted with deep regret; and yet, each confident in his\nopinion, felt somewhat relieved by the absence of one whom he respected\nso much, and with whom he could agree so little.\n\nSoon afterwards the sound of the Knight of Avenel's trumpets was heard,\nand the Abbot went to the top of the tower, from whose dismantled\nbattlements he could soon see the horsemen ascending the rising ground\nin the direction of the drawbridge. As he gazed, Magdalen Graeme came to\nhis side.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThou art come,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto catch the last glimpse of thy grandson,\nmy sister. Yonder he wends, under the charge of the best knight in\nScotland, his faith ever excepted.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThou canst bear witness, my father, that it was no wish either of\nmine or of Roland's,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the matron, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich induced the Knight\nof Avenel, as he is called, again to entertain my grandson in his\nhousehold--Heaven, which confounds the wise with their own wisdom,\nand the wicked with their own policy, hath placed him where, for the\nservices of the Church, I would most wish him to be.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know not what you mean, my sister,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cReverend father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Magdalen, \u00e2\u0080\u009chast thou never heard that there\nare spirits powerful to rend the walls of a castle asunder when once\nadmitted, which yet cannot enter the house unless they are invited, nay,\ndragged over the threshold?\n\n[Footnote: There is a popular belief respecting evil spirits, that they\ncannot enter an inhabited house unless invited, nay, dragged over the\nthreshold. There is an instance of the same superstition in the Tales of\nthe Genii, where an enchanter is supposed to have intruded himself into\nthe Divan of the Sultan.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c'Thus,' said the illustrious Misnar, 'let the enemies of Mahomet be\ndismayed! but inform me, O ye sages! under the semblance of which of\nyour brethren did that foul enchanter gain admittance here?'--'May the\nlord of my heart,' answered Balihu, the hermit of the faithful from\nQueda, 'triumph over all his foes! As I travelled on the mountains from\nQueda, and saw neither the footsteps of beasts, nor the flight of birds,\nbehold, I chanced to pass through a cavern, in whose hollow sides I\nfound this accursed sage, to whom I unfolded the invitation of the\nSultan of India, and we, joining, journeyed towards the Divan; but ere\nwe entered, he said unto me. 'Put thy hand forth, and pull me towards\nthee into the Divan, calling on the name of Mahomet, for the evil\nspirits are on me and vex me.'\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI have understood that many parts of these fine tales, and in particular\nthat of the Sultan Misnar, were taken from genuine Oriental sources by\nthe editor, Mr. James Ridley.\n\nBut the most picturesque use of this popular belief occurs in\nColeridge's beautiful and tantalizing fragment of Christabel. Has not\nour own imaginative poet cause to fear that future ages will desire to\nsummon him from his place of rest, as Milton longed\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo call him up, who left half told\n   The story of Cambuscan bold?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe verses I refer to are when Christabel conducts into her father's\ncastle a mysterious and malevolent being, under the guise of a\ndistressed female stranger.\n\n\n  'They cross'd the moat, and Christabel\n  Took the key that fitted well;\n  A little door she open'd straight,\n  All in the middle of the gate;\n  The gate that was iron'd within and without,\n  Where an army in battle array had march'd out.\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe lady sank, belike through pain,\n  And Christabel with might and main\n  Lifted her up, a weary weight,\n  Over the threshold of the gate:\n  Then the lady rose again,\n  And moved as she were not in pain.\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo free from danger, free from fear,\n  They cross'd the court;--right glad they were,\n  And Christabel devoutly cried\n  To the lady by her side:\n  'Praise we the Virgin, all divine,\n    Who hath rescued thee from this distress.'\n  'Alas, alas!' said Geraldine,\n  'I cannot speak from weariness.'\n  So free from danger, free from fear,\n  They cross'd the court: right glad they were\n]\n\nTwice hath Roland Graeme been thus drawn into the household of Avenel by\nthose who now hold the title. Let them look to the issue.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying she left the turret; and the Abbot, after pausing a moment on\nher words, which he imputed to the unsettled state of her mind, followed\ndown the winding stair to celebrate his admission to his high office by\nfast and prayer instead of revelling and thanksgiving.\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Sixteenth.\n\n\n  Youth! thou wear'st to manhood now,\n  Darker lip and darker brow,\n  Statelier step, more pensive mien,\n  In thy face and gate are seen:\n  Thou must now brook midnight watches,\n  Take thy food and sport by snatches;\n  For the gambol and the jest,\n  Thou wert wont to love the best,\n  Graver follies must thou follow,\n  But as senseless, false, and hollow.\n                        LIFE, A POEM.\n\nYoung Roland Graeme now trotted gaily forward in the train of\nSir Halbert Glendinning. He was relieved from his most galling\napprehension,--the encounter of the scorn and taunt which might possibly\nhail his immediate return to the Castle of Avenel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere will be a\nchange ere they see me again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he thought to himself; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall wear the\ncoat of plate, instead of the green jerkin, and the steel morion for the\nbonnet and feather. They will be bold that may venture to break a gibe\non the man-at-arms for the follies of the page; and I trust, that ere we\nreturn I shall have done something more worthy of note than hallooing\na hound after a deer, or scrambling a crag for a kite's nest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He\ncould not, indeed, help marvelling that his grandmother, with all her\nreligious prejudices, leaning, it would seem, to the other side, had\nconsented so readily to his re-entering the service of the House of\nAvenel; and yet more, at the mysterious joy with which she took leave of\nhim at the Abbey.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHeaven,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the dame, as she kissed her young relation, and bade him\nfarewell, \u00e2\u0080\u009cworks its own work, even by the hands of those of our enemies\nwho think themselves the strongest and the wisest. Thou, my child, be\nready to act upon the call of thy religion and country; and remember,\neach earthly bond which thou canst form is, compared to the ties which\nbind thee to them, like the loose flax to the twisted cable. Thou hast\nnot forgot the face or form of the damsel Catherine Seyton?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland would have replied in the negative, but the word seemed to stick\nin his throat and Magdalen continued her exhortations.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThou must not forget her, my son; and here I intrust thee with a token,\nwhich I trust thou wilt speedily find an opportunity of delivering with\ncare and secrecy into her own hand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe put here into Roland's hand a very small packet, of which she again\nenjoined him to take the strictest care, and to suffer it to be seen\nby no one save Catherine Seyton, who, she again (very unnecessarily)\nreminded him, was the young lady he had met on the preceding day. She\nthen bestowed on him her solemn benediction, and bade God speed him.\n\nThere was something in her manner and her conduct which implied mystery;\nbut Roland Graeme was not of an age or temper to waste much time\nin endeavoring to decipher her meaning. All that was obvious to his\nperception in the present journey, promised pleasure and novelty. He\nrejoiced that he was travelling towards Edinburgh, in order to assume\nthe character of a man, and lay aside that of a boy. He was delighted to\nthink that he would have an opportunity of rejoining Catherine\nSeyton, whose bright eyes and lively manners had made so favourable an\nimpression on his imagination; and, as an experienced, yet high-spirited\nyouth, entering for the first time upon active life, his heart bounded\nat the thought, that he was about to see all those scenes of courtly\nsplendour and warlike adventures, of which the followers of Sir Halbert\nused to boast on their occasional visits to Avenel, to the wonderment\nand envy of those who, like Roland, knew courts and camps only by\nhearsay, and were condemned to the solitary sports and almost monastic\nseclusion of Avenel, surrounded by its lonely lake, and embossed\namong its pathless mountains. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey shall mention my name,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said\nto himself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif the risk of my life can purchase me opportunities of\ndistinction, and Catherine Seyton's saucy eye shall rest with more\nrespect on the distinguished soldier, than that with which she laughed\nto scorn the raw and inexperienced page.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--There was wanting but\none accessary to complete the sense of rapturous excitation, and he\npossessed it by being once more mounted on the back of a fiery and\nactive horse, instead of plodding along on foot, as had been the case\nduring the preceding days.\n\nImpelled by the liveliness of his own spirits, which so many\ncircumstances tended naturally to exalt, Roland Graeme's voice and his\nlaughter were soon distinguished amid the trampling of the horses of the\nretinue, and more than once attracted the attention of the leader, who\nremarked with satisfaction, that the youth replied with good-humoured\nraillery to such of the train as jested with him on his dismissal and\nreturn to the service of the House of Avenel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought the holly-branch in your bonnet had been blighted, Master\nRoland?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said one of the men-at-arms.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly pinched with half an hour's frost; you see it flourishes as green\nas ever.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is too grave a plant to flourish on so hot a soil as that headpiece\nof thine, Master Roland Graeme,\u00e2\u0080\u009d retorted the other, who was an old\nequerry of Sir Halbert Glendinning.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it will not flourish alone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will mix it with the\nlaurel and the myrtle--and I will carry them so near the sky, that it\nshall make amends for their stinted growth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThus speaking, he dashed his spurs into his horse's sides, and, checking\nhim at the same time, compelled him to execute a lofty caracole. Sir\nHalbert Glendinning looked at the demeanour of his new attendant with\nthat sort of melancholy pleasure with which those who have long followed\nthe pursuits of life, and are sensible of their vanity, regard the gay,\nyoung, and buoyant spirits to whom existence, as yet, is only hope and\npromise.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Adam Woodcock, the falconer, stripped of his masquing\nhabit, and attired, according to his rank and calling, in a green\njerkin, with a hawking-bag on the one side, and a short hanger on the\nother, a glove on his left hand which reached half way up his arm, and\na bonnet and feather upon his head, came after the party as fast as\nhis active little galloway-nag could trot, and immediately entered into\nparley with Roland Graeme.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo, my youngster, you are once more under shadow of the holly-branch?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd in case to repay you, my good friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour ten\ngroats of silver.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhich, but an hour since,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the falconer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou had nearly paid me\nwith ten inches of steel. On my faith, it is written in the book of our\ndestiny, that I must brook your dagger after all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, speak not of that, my good friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the youth, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would\nrather have broached my own bosom than yours; but who could have known\nyou in the mumming dress you wore?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the falconer resumed,--for both as a poet and actor he had\nhis own professional share of self-conceit,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think I was as good a\nHowleglas as ever played part at a Shrovetide revelry, and not a much\nworse Abbot of Unreason. I defy the Old Enemy to unmask me when I choose\nto keep my vizard on. What the devil brought the Knight on us before we\nhad the game out? You would have heard me hollo my own new ballad with a\nvoice should have reached to Berwick. But I pray you, Master Roland, be\nless free of cold steel on slight occasions; since, but for the stuffing\nof my reverend doublet, I had only left the kirk to take my place in the\nkirkyard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, spare me that feud,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe shall have no time to\nfight it out; for, by our lord's command, I am bound for Edinburgh.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Adam Woodcock, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand even therefore we shall have time\nto solder up this rent by the way, for Sir Halbert has appointed me your\ncompanion and guide.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy? and with what purpose?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the falconer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis a question I cannot answer; but I know,\nthat be the food of the eyases washed or unwashed, and, indeed, whatever\nbecomes of perch and mew, I am to go with you to Edinburgh, and see you\nsafely delivered to the Regent at Holyrood.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow, to the Regent?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, in surprise.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, by my faith, to the Regent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Woodcock; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI promise you, that\nif you are not to enter his service, at least you are to wait upon him\nin the character of a retainer of our Knight of Avenel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know no right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the youth, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich the Knight of Avenel hath to\ntransfer my service, supposing that I owe it to himself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHush, hush!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the falconer; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat is a question I advise no one to\nstir in until he has the mountain or the lake, or the march of another\nkingdom, which is better than either, betwixt him and his feudal\nsuperior.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut Sir Halbert Glendinning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the youth, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis not my feudal\nsuperior; nor has he aught of authority--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI pray you, my son, to rein your tongue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Adam Woodcock; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy\nlord's displeasure, if you provoke it, will be worse to appease than\nmy lady's. The touch of his least finger were heavier than her hardest\nblow. And, by my faith, he is a man of steel, as true and as pure, but\nas hard and as pitiless. You remember the Cock of Capperlaw, whom he\nhanged over his gate for a mere mistake--a poor yoke of oxen taken in\nScotland, when he thought he was taking them in English land? I loved\nthe Cock of Capperlaw; the Kerrs had not an honester man in their clan,\nand they have had men that might have been a pattern to the Border--men\nthat would not have lifted under twenty cows at once, and would have\nheld themselves dishonoured if they had taken a drift of sheep, or the\nlike, but always managed their raids in full credit and honour.--But\nsee, his worship halts, and we are close by the bridge. Ride up--ride\nup--we must have his last instructions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was as Adam Woodcock said. In the hollow way descending towards the\nbridge, which was still in the guardianship of Peter Bridgeward, as he\nwas called, though he was now very old, Sir Halbert Glendinning halted\nhis retinue, and beckoned to Woodcock and Graeme to advance to the head\nof the train.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWoodcock,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthou knowest to whom thou art to conduct this\nyouth. And thou, young man, obey discreetly and with diligence the\norders that shall be given thee. Curb thy vain and peevish temper. Be\njust, true, and faithful; and there is in thee that which may raise\nthee many a degree above thy present station. Neither shalt thou--always\nsupposing thine efforts to be fair and honest--want the protection and\ncountenance of Avenel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLeaving them in front of the bridge, the centre tower of which now began\nto cast a prolonged shade upon the river, the Knight of Avenel turned\nto the left, without crossing the river, and pursued his way towards the\nchain of hills within whose recesses are situated the Lake and Castle\nof Avenel. There remained behind, the falconer, Roland Graeme, and a\ndomestic of the Knight, of inferior rank, who was left with them to look\nafter their horses while on the road, to carry their baggage, and to\nattend to their convenience.\n\nSo soon as the more numerous body of riders had turned off to pursue\ntheir journey westward, those whose route lay across the river, and was\ndirected towards the north, summoned the Bridgeward, and demanded a free\npassage.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not lower the bridge,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Peter, in a voice querulous with\nage and ill-humour.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome Papist, come Protestant, ye are all the\nsame. The Papist threatened us with Purgatory, and fleeched us with\npardons--the Protestant mints at us with his sword, and cuttles us with\nthe liberty of conscience; but never a one of either says, 'Peter, there\nis your penny.' I am well tired of all this, and for no man shall the\nbridge fall that pays me not ready money; and I would have you know I\ncare as little for Geneva as for Rome--as little for homilies as for\npardons; and the silver pennies are the only passports I will hear of.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere is a proper old chuff!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Woodcock to his companion; then\nraising his voice, he exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHark thee, dog--Bridgeward, villain,\ndost thou think we have refused thy namesake Peter's pence to Rome, to\npay thine at the bridge of Kennaquhair? Let thy bridge down instantly to\nthe followers of the house of Avenel, or by the hand of my father, and\nthat handled many a bridle rein, for he was a bluff Yorkshireman--I say,\nby my father's hand, our Knight will blow thee out of thy solan-goose's\nnest there in the middle of the water, with the light falconet which we\nare bringing southward from Edinburgh to-morrow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Bridgeward heard, and muttered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cA plague on falcon and falconet,\non cannon and demicannon, and all the barking bull-dogs whom they halloo\nagainst stone and lime in these our days! It was a merry time when there\nwas little besides handy blows, and it may be a flight of arrows that\nharmed an ashler wall as little as so many hailstones. But we must jouk\nand let the jaw gang by.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Comforting himself in his state of diminished\nconsequence with this pithy old proverb, Peter Bridgeward lowered the\ndrawbridge, and permitted them to pass over. At the sight of his white\nhair, albeit it discovered a visage equally peevish through age and\nmisfortune, Roland was inclined to give him an alms, but Adam Woodcock\nprevented him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cE'en let him pay the penalty of his former churlishness\nand greed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe wolf, when he has lost his teeth, should be\ntreated no better than a cur.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLeaving the Bridgeward to lament the alteration of times, which sent\ndomineering soldiers and feudal retainers to his place of passage,\ninstead of peaceful pilgrims, and reduced him to become the oppressed,\ninstead of playing the extortioner, the travellers turned them\nnorthward; and Adam Woodcock, well acquainted with that part of the\ncountry, proposed to cut short a considerable portion of the road, by\ntraversing the little vale of Glendearg, so famous for the adventures\nwhich befell therein during the earlier part of the Benedictine's\nmanuscript. With these, and with the thousand commentaries,\nrepresentations, and misrepresentations, to which they had given rise,\nRoland Graeme was, of course, well acquainted; for in the Castle of\nAvenel, as well as in other great establishments, the inmates talked of\nnothing so often, or with such pleasure, as of the private affairs of\ntheir lord and lady. But while Roland was viewing with interest these\nhaunted scenes, in which things were said to have passed beyond the\nordinary laws of nature, Adam Woodcock was still regretting in his\nsecret soul the unfinished revel and the unsung ballad, and kept every\nnow and then, breaking out with some such verses as these:--\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Friars of Fail drank berry-brown ale,\n       The best that e'er was tasted;\n     The Monks of Melrose made gude kale\n       On Fridays, when they fasted.\n          Saint Monance' sister.\n          The gray priest kist her--\n           Fiend save the company!\n          Sing hay trix, trim-go-trix.\n            Under the greenwood tree.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy my hand, friend Woodcock,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthough I know you for a\nhardy gospeller, that fear neither saint nor devil, yet, if I were\nyou, I would not sing your profane songs in this valley of Glendearg,\nconsidering what has happened here before our time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA straw for your wandering spirits!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Adam Woodcock; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI mind them\nno more than an earn cares for a string of wild-geese--they have all\nfled since the pulpits were filled with honest men, and the people's\nears with sound doctrine. Nay, I have a touch at them in my ballad, an I\nhad but had the good luck to have it sung to end;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and again he set off\nin the same key:\n\n  From haunted spring and grassy ring,\n    Troop goblin, elf, and fairy;\n  And the kelpie must flit from the black bog-pit,\n    And the brownie must not tarry;\n       To Limbo-lake,\n       Their way they take,\n         With scarce the pith to flee.\n       Sing hay trix, trim-go-trix,\n         Under the greenwood tree.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat could Sir Halbert's patience have stretched\ntill we came that length, he would have had a hearty laugh, and that is\nwhat he seldom enjoys.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it be all true that men tell of his early life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009che\nhas less right to laugh at goblins than most men.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, _if_ it be all true,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Adam Woodcock; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut who can ensure\nus of that? Moreover, these were but tales the monks used to gull us\nsimple laymen withal; they knew that fairies and hobgoblins brought\naves and paternosters into repute; but, now we have given up worship\nof images in wood and stone, methinks it were no time to be afraid of\nbubbles in the water, or shadows in the air.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHowever,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas the Catholics say they do not worship\nwood or stone, but only as emblems of the holy saints, and not as things\nholy in themselves----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPshaw! pshaw!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the falconer; \u00e2\u0080\u009ca rush for their prating.\nThey told us another story when these baptized idols of theirs brought\npike-staves and sandalled shoon from all the four winds, and whillied\nthe old women out of their corn and their candle ends, and their butter,\nbacon, wool, and cheese, and when not so much as a gray groat escaped\ntithing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland Graeme had been long taught, by necessity, to consider his form\nof religion as a profound secret, and to say nothing whatever in its\ndefence when assailed, lest he should draw on himself the suspicion of\nbelonging to the unpopular and exploded church. He therefore suffered\nAdam Woodcock to triumph without farther opposition, marvelling in his\nown mind whether any of the goblins, formerly such active agents, would\navenge his rude raillery before they left the valley of Glendearg.\nBut no such consequences followed. They passed the night quietly in a\ncottage in the glen, and the next day resumed their route to Edinburgh.\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Seventeenth.\n\n\nEdina! Scotia's darling seat,  All hail thy palaces and towers,\nWhere once, beneath a monarch's feet,  Sate legislation's sovereign powers.\n                          BURNS.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis, then, is Edinburgh?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the youth, as the fellow-travellers\narrived at one of the heights to the southward, which commanded a view\nof the great northern capital--\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is that Edinburgh of which we have\nheard so much!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEven so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the falconer; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyonder stands Auld Reekie--you may see\nthe smoke hover over her at twenty miles' distance, as the gosshawk\nhangs over a plump of young wild-ducks--ay, yonder is the heart of\nScotland, and each throb that she gives is felt from the edge of Solway\nto Duncan's-bay-head. See, yonder is the old Castle; and see to the\nright, on yon rising ground, that is the Castle of Craigmillar, which I\nhave known a merry place in my time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWas it not there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page in a low voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat the Queen held\nher court?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the falconer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cQueen she was then, though you must not\ncall her so now. Well, they may say what they will--many a true heart\nwill be sad for Mary Stewart, e'en if all be true men say of her; for\nlook you, Master Roland--she was the loveliest creature to look upon\nthat I ever saw with eye, and no lady in the land liked better the fair\nflight of a falcon. I was at the great match on Roslin Moor betwixt\nBothwell--he was a black sight to her that Bothwell--and the Baron\nof Roslin, who could judge a hawk's flight as well as any man in\nScotland--a butt of Rhenish and a ring of gold was the wager, and it was\nflown as fairly for as ever was red gold and bright wine. And to see\nher there on her white palfrey, that flew as if it scorned to touch more\nthan the heather blossom; and to hear her voice, as clear and sweet as\nthe mavis's whistle, mix among our jolly whooping and whistling; and to\nmark all the nobles dashing round her; happiest he who got a word or a\nlook--tearing through moss and hagg, and venturing neck and limb to\ngain the praise of a bold rider, and the blink of a bonny Queen's bright\neye!--she will see little hawking where she lies now--ay, ay, pomp and\npleasure pass away as speedily as the wap of a falcon's wing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd where is this poor Queen now confined?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme,\ninterested in the fate of a woman whose beauty and grace had made so\nstrong an impression even on the blunt and careless character of Adam\nWoodcock.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere is she now imprisoned?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said honest Adam; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy, in some castle\nin the north, they say--I know not where, for my part, nor is it worth\nwhile to vex one's sell anent what cannot be mended--An she had guided\nher power well whilst she had it, she had not come to so evil a pass.\nMen say she must resign her crown to this little baby of a prince, for\nthat they will trust her with it no longer. Our master has been as busy\nas his neighbours in all this work. If the Queen should come to her\nown again, Avenel Castle is like to smoke for it, unless he makes\nhis bargain all the better.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn a castle in the north Queen Mary is\nconfined?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, ay--they say so, at least--In a castle\nbeyond that great river which comes down yonder, and looks like a river,\nbut it is a branch of the sea, and as bitter as brine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd amongst all her subjects,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, with some emotion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis\nthere none that will adventure anything for her relief?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is a kittle question,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the falconer; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand if you ask it\noften, Master Roland, I am fain to tell you that you will be mewed up\nyourself in some of those castles, if they do not prefer twisting your\nhead off, to save farther trouble with you--Adventure any thing? Lord,\nwhy, Murray has the wind in his poop now, man, and flies so high and\nstrong, that the devil a wing of them can match him--No, no; there she\nis, and there she must lie, till Heaven send her deliverance, or till\nher son has the management of all--But Murray will never let her loose\nagain, he knows her too well.--And hark thee, we are now bound for\nHolyrood, where thou wilt find plenty of news, and of courtiers to tell\nit--But, take my counsel, and keep a calm sough, as the Scots say--hear\nevery man's counsel, and keep your own. And if you hap to learn any\nnews you like, leap not up as if you were to put on armour direct in the\ncause--Our old Mr. Wingate says--and he knows court-cattle well--that if\nyou are told old King Coul is come alive again, you should turn it off\nwith, 'And is he in truth?--I heard not of it,' and should seem no more\nmoved, than if one told you, by way of novelty, that old King Coul was\ndead and buried. Wherefore, look well to your bearing, Master Roland,\nfor, I promise you, you come among a generation that are keen as a\nhungry hawk--And never be dagger out of sheath at every wry word you\nhear spoken; for you will find as hot blades as yourself, and then will\nbe letting of blood without advice either of leech or almanack.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou shall see how staid I will be, and how cautious, my good friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said Graeme; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut, blessed Lady, what goodly house is that which is\nlying all in ruins so close to the city? Have they been playing at the\nAbbot of Unreason here, and ended the gambol by burning the church?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere again now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied his companion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou go down the wind like a\nwild haggard, that minds neither lure nor beck--that is a question you\nshould have asked in as low a tone as I shall answer it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I stay here long,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is like I shall lose the\nnatural use of my voice--but what are the ruins then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Kirk of Field,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the falconer, in a low and impressive whisper,\nlaying at the same time his finger on his lip; \u00e2\u0080\u009cask no more about\nit--somebody got foul play, and somebody got the blame of it; and the\ngame began there which perhaps may not be played out in our time.--Poor\nHenry Darnley! to be an ass, he understood somewhat of a hawk; but\nthey sent him on the wing through the air himself one bright moonlight\nnight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe memory of this catastrophe was so recent, that the page averted his\neyes with horror from the scathed ruins in which it had taken place; and\nthe accusations against the Queen, to which it had given rise, came over\nhis mind with such strength as to balance the compassion he had begun to\nentertain for her present forlorn situation.\n\nIt was, indeed, with that agitating state of mind which arises partly\nfrom horror, but more from anxious interest and curiosity, that young\nGraeme found himself actually traversing the scene of those tremendous\nevents, the report of which had disturbed the most distant solitudes\nin Scotland, like the echoes of distant thunder rolling among the\nmountains.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he thought, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnow or never shall I become a man, and bear my part\nin those deeds which the simple inhabitants of our hamlets repeat to\neach other, as if they were wrought by beings of a superior order to\ntheir own. I will know now, wherefore the Knight of Avenel carries his\ncrest so much above those of the neighbouring baronage, and how it is\nthat men, by valour and wisdom, work their way from the hoddin-gray\ncoat to the cloak of scarlet and gold. Men say I have not much wisdom to\nrecommend me; and if that be true, courage must do it; for I will be a\nman amongst living men, or a dead corpse amongst the dead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFrom these dreams of ambition he turned his thoughts to those of\npleasure, and began to form many conjectures, when and where he should\nsee Catherine Seyton, and in what manner their acquaintance was to be\nrenewed. With such conjectures he was amusing himself, when he found\nthat they had entered the city, and all other feelings were suspended\nin the sensation of giddy astonishment with which an inhabitant of the\ncountry is affected, when, for the first time, he finds himself in the\nstreets of a large and populous city, a unit in the midst of thousands.\n\nThe principal street of Edinburgh was then, as now, one of the most\nspacious in Europe. The extreme height of the houses, and the variety of\nGothic gables and battlements, and balconies, by which the sky-line on\neach side was crowned and terminated, together with the width of the\nstreet itself, might have struck with surprise a more practised eye than\nthat of young Graeme. The population, close packed within the walls of\nthe city, and at this time increased by the number of the lords of\nthe King's party who had thronged to Edinburgh to wait upon the Regent\nMurray, absolutely swarmed like bees on the wide and stately street.\nInstead of the shop-windows, which are now calculated for the display\nof goods, the traders had their open booths projecting on the street,\nin which, as in the fashion of the modern bazaars, all was exposed which\nthey had upon sale. And though the commodities were not of the richest\nkinds, yet Graeme thought he beheld the wealth of the whole world in the\nvarious bales of Flanders cloths, and the specimens of tapestry; and,\nat other places, the display of domestic utensils and pieces of plate\nstruck him with wonder. The sight of cutlers' booths, furnished with\nswords and poniards, which were manufactured in Scotland, and with\npieces of defensive armour, imported from Flanders, added to his\nsurprise; and, at every step, he found so much to admire and gaze upon,\nthat Adam Woodcock had no little difficulty in prevailing on him to\nadvance through such a scene of enchantment.\n\nThe sight of the crowds which filled the streets was equally a subject\nof wonder. Here a gay lady, in her muffler, or silken veil, traced her\nway delicately, a gentleman-usher making way for her, a page bearing up\nher train, and a waiting gentlewoman carrying her Bible, thus intimating\nthat her purpose was towards the church--There he might see a group of\ncitizens bending the same way, with their short Flemish cloaks, wide\ntrowsers, and high-caped doublets, a fashion to which, as well as to\ntheir bonnet and feather, the Scots were long faithful. Then, again,\ncame the clergyman himself, in his black Geneva cloak and band, lending\na grave and attentive ear to the discourse of several persons who\naccompanied him, and who were doubtless holding serious converse on\nthe religious subject he was about to treat of. Nor did there lack\npassengers of a different class and appearance.\n\nAt every turn, Roland Graeme might see a gallant ruffle along in the\nnewer or French mode, his doublet slashed, and his points of the same\ncolours with the lining, his long sword on one side, and his poniard on\nthe other, behind him a body of stout serving men, proportioned to\nhis estate and quality, all of whom walked with the air of military\nretainers, and were armed with sword and buckler, the latter being a\nsmall round shield, not unlike the Highland target, having a steel\nspike in the centre. Two of these parties, each headed by a person of\nimportance, chanced to meet in the very centre of the street, or, as\nit was called, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe crown of the cause-way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a post of honour as\ntenaciously asserted in Scotland, as that of giving or taking the wall\nused to be in the more southern part of the island. The two leaders\nbeing of equal rank, and, most probably, either animated by political\ndislike, or by recollection of some feudal enmity, marched close up\nto each other, without yielding an inch to the right or the left; and\nneither showing the least purpose of giving way, they stopped for an\ninstant, and then drew their swords. Their followers imitated their\nexample; about a score of weapons at once flashed in the sun, and there\nwas an immediate clatter of swords and bucklers, while the followers on\neither side cried their master's name; the one shouting \u00e2\u0080\u009cHelp, a Leslie!\na Leslie!\u00e2\u0080\u009d while the others answered with shouts of \u00e2\u0080\u009cSeyton! Seyton!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n with the additional punning slogan, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSet on, set on--bear the knaves to\nthe ground!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIf the falconer found difficulty in getting the page to go forward\nbefore, it was now perfectly impossible. He reined up his horse, clapped\nhis hands, and, delighted with the fray, cried and shouted as fast as\nany of those who were actually engaged in it.\n\nThe noise and cries thus arising on the Highgate, as it was called,\ndrew into the quarrel two or three other parties of gentlemen and their\nservants, besides some single passengers, who, hearing a fray betwixt\nthese two distinguished names, took part in it, either for love or\nhatred.\n\nThe combat became now very sharp, and although the sword-and-buckler men\nmade more clatter and noise than they did real damage, yet several\ngood cuts were dealt among them; and those who wore rapiers, a more\nformidable weapon than the ordinary Scottish swords, gave and received\ndangerous wounds. Two men were already stretched on the causeway, and\nthe party of Seyton began to give ground, being much inferior in number\nto the other, with which several of the citizens had united themselves,\nwhen young Roland Graeme, beholding their leader, a noble gentleman,\nfighting bravely, and hard pressed with numbers, could withhold no\nlonger. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAdam Woodcock,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009can you be a man, draw, and let us\ntake part with the Seyton.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And, without waiting a reply, or listening\nto the falconer's earnest entreaty, that he would leave alone a strife\nin which he had no concern, the fiery youth sprung from his horse, drew\nhis short sword, and shouting like the rest, \u00e2\u0080\u009cA Seyton! a Seyton! Set\non! set on!\u00e2\u0080\u009d thrust forward into the throng, and struck down one\nof those who was pressing hardest upon the gentleman whose cause he\nespoused. This sudden reinforcement gave spirit to the weaker party,\nwho began to renew the combat with much alacrity, when four of the\nmagistrates of the city, distinguished by their velvet cloaks and gold\nchains, came up with a guard of halberdiers and citizens, armed with\nlong weapons, and well accustomed to such service, thrust boldly\nforward, and compelled the swordsmen to separate, who immediately\nretreated in different directions, leaving such of the wounded on both\nsides, as had been disabled in the fray, lying on the street.\n\nThe falconer, who had been tearing his beard for anger at his comrade's\nrashness, now rode up to him with the horse which he had caught by\nthe bridle, and accosted him with \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster Roland--master goose--master\nmad-cap--will it please you to get on horse, and budge? or will you\nremain here to be carried to prison, and made to answer for this pretty\nday's work?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe page, who had begun his retreat along with the Seytons, just as\nif he had been one of their natural allies, was by this unceremonious\napplication made sensible that he was acting a foolish part; and,\nobeying Adam Woodcock with some sense of shame, he sprung actively on\nhorseback, and upsetting with the shoulder of the animal a city-officer,\nwho was making towards him, he began to ride smartly down the street,\nalong with his companion, and was quickly out of the reach of the hue\nand cry. In fact, rencounters of the kind were so common in Edinburgh\nat that period, that the disturbance seldom excited much attention after\nthe affray was over, unless some person of consequence chanced to have\nfallen, an incident which imposed on his friends the duty of avenging\nhis death on the first convenient opportunity. So feeble, indeed, was\nthe arm of the police, that it was not unusual for such skirmishes to\nlast for hours, where the parties were numerous and well matched. But at\nthis time the Regent, a man of great strength of character, aware of the\nmischief which usually arose from such acts of violence, had prevailed\nwith the magistrates to keep a constant guard on foot for preventing or\nseparating such affrays as had happened in the present case.\n\nThe falconer and his young companion were now riding down the Canongate,\nand had slackened their pace to avoid attracting attention, the rather\nthat there seemed to be no appearance of pursuit. Roland hung his head\nas one who was conscious his conduct had been none of the wisest, whilst\nhis companion thus addressed him:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you be pleased to tell me one thing, Master Roland Graeme, and\nthat is, whether there be a devil incarnate in you or no?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTruly, Master Adam Woodcock,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would fain hope\nthere is not.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Adam, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would fain know by what other influence or\ninstigation you are perpetually at one end or the other of some bloody\nbrawl? What, I pray, had you to do with these Seytons and Leslies, that\nyou never heard the names of in your life before?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are out there, my friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have my own\nreasons for being a friend to the Seytons.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey must have been very secret reasons then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Adam Woodcock,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cfor I think I could have wagered, you had never known one of the name;\nand I am apt to believe still, that it was your unhallowed passion\nfor that clashing of cold iron, which has as much charm for you as the\nclatter of a brass pan hath for a hive of bees, rather than any care\neither for Seyton or for Leslie, that persuaded you to thrust your\nfool's head into a quarrel that no ways concerned you. But take this for\na warning, my young master, that if you are to draw sword with every man\nwho draws sword on the Highgate here, it will be scarce worth your while\nto sheathe bilbo again for the rest of your life, since, if I guess\nrightly, it will scarce endure on such terms for many hours--all which I\nleave to your serious consideration.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy my word, Adam, I honour your advice; and I promise you, that I will\npractise by it as faithfully as if I were sworn apprentice to you,\nto the trade and mystery of bearing myself with all wisdom and safety\nthrough the new paths of life that I am about to be engaged in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd therein you will do well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the falconer; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I do not quarrel\nwith you, Master Roland, for having a grain over much spirit, because\nI know one may bring to the hand a wild hawk which one never can a\ndung-hill hen--and so betwixt two faults you have the best on't. But\nbesides your peculiar genius for quarrelling and lugging out your side\ncompanion, my dear Master Roland, you have also the gift of peering\nunder every woman's muffler and screen, as if you expected to find\nan old acquaintance. Though were you to spy one, I should be as much\nsurprised at it, well wotting how few you have seen of these same\nwild-fowl, as I was at your taking so deep an interest even now in the\nSeyton.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTush, man! nonsense and folly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Roland Graeme, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI but sought\nto see what eyes these gentle hawks have got under their hood.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, but it's a dangerous subject of inquiry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the falconer; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\nhad better hold out your bare wrist for an eagle to perch upon.--Look\nyou, Master Roland, these pretty wild-geese cannot be hawked at without\nrisk--they have as many divings, boltings, and volleyings, as the most\ngamesome quarry that falcon ever flew at--And besides, every woman of\nthem is manned with her husband, or her kind friend, or her brother,\nor her cousin, or her sworn servant at the least--But you heed me not,\nMaster Roland, though I know the game so well--your eye is all on that\npretty damsel who trips down the gate before us--by my certes, I will\nwarrant her a blithe dancer either in reel or revel--a pair of silver\nmorisco bells would become these pretty ankles as well as the jesses\nwould suit the fairest Norway hawk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThou art a fool, Adam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I care not a button about\nthe girl or her ankles--But, what the foul fiend, one must look at\nsomething!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery true, Master Roland Graeme,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his guide, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut let me pray you\nto choose your objects better. Look you, there is scarce a woman walks\nthis High-gate with a silk screen or a pearlin muffler, but, as I said\nbefore, she has either gentleman-usher before her, or kinsman, or lover,\nor husband, at her elbow, or it may be a brace of stout fellows with\nsword and buckler, not so far behind but what they can follow close--But\nyou heed me no more than a goss-hawk minds a yellow yoldring.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO yes, I do--I do mind you indeed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut hold my\nnag a bit--I will be with you in the exchange of a whistle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying,\nand ere Adam Woodcock could finish the sermon which was dying on his\ntongue, Roland Graeme, to the falconer's utter astonishment, threw him\nthe bridle of his jennet, jumped off horseback, and pursued down one of\nthe closes or narrow lanes, which, opening under a vault, terminate upon\nthe main-street, the very maiden to whom his friend had accused him of\nshowing so much attention, and who had turned down the pass in question.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSaint Mary, Saint Magdalen, Saint Benedict, Saint Barnabas!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\npoor falconer, when he found himself thus suddenly brought to a pause\nin the midst of the Canongate, and saw his young charge start off like a\nmadman in quest of a damsel whom he had never, as Adam supposed, seen in\nhis life before,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cSaint Satan and Saint Beelzebub--for this would\nmake one swear saint and devil--what can have come over the lad, with\na wanion! And what shall I do the whilst!--he will have his throat cut,\nthe poor lad, as sure as I was born at the foot of Roseberry-Topping.\nCould I find some one to hold the horses! but they are as sharp here\nnorth-away as in canny Yorkshire herself, and quit bridle, quit titt,\nas we say. An I could but see one of our folks now, a holly-sprig were\nworth a gold tassel; or could I but see one of the Regent's men--but to\nleave the horses to a stranger, that I cannot--and to leave the place\nwhile the lad is in jeopardy, that I wonot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe must leave the falconer, however, in the midst of his distress, and\nfollow the hot-headed youth who was the cause of his perplexity.\n\nThe latter part of Adam Woodcock's sage remonstrance had been in a great\nmeasure lost upon Roland, for whose benefit it was intended; because,\nin one of the female forms which tripped along the street, muffled in\na veil of striped silk, like the women of Brussels at this day, his eye\nhad discerned something which closely resembled the exquisite shape and\nspirited bearing of Catherine Seyton.--During all the grave advice which\nthe falconer was dinning in his ears, his eye continued intent upon so\ninteresting an object of observation; and at length, as the damsel, just\nabout to dive under one of the arched passages which afforded an outlet\nto the Canongate from the houses beneath, (a passage, graced by a\nprojecting shield of arms, supported by two huge foxes of stone,) had\nlifted her veil for the purpose perhaps of descrying who the horseman\nwas who for some time had eyed her so closely, young Roland saw, under\nthe shade of the silken plaid, enough of the bright azure eyes, fair\nlocks, and blithe features, to induce him, like an inexperienced\nand rash madcap, whose wilful ways never had been traversed by\ncontradiction, nor much subjected to consideration, to throw the bridle\nof his horse into Adam Woodcock's hand, and leave him to play the\nwaiting gentleman, while he dashed down the paved court after Catherine\nSeyton--all as aforesaid.\n\nWomen's wits are proverbially quick, but apparently those of Catherine\nsuggested no better expedient than fairly to betake herself to speed of\nfoot, in hopes of baffling the page's vivacity, by getting safely lodged\nbefore he could discover where. But a youth of eighteen, in pursuit of\na mistress, is not so easily outstripped. Catherine fled across a\npaved court, decorated with large formal vases of stone, in which yews,\ncypresses, and other evergreens, vegetated in sombre sullenness, and\ngave a correspondent degree of solemnity to the high and heavy building\nin front of which they were placed as ornaments, aspiring towards a\nsquare portion of the blue hemisphere, corresponding exactly in extent\nto the quadrangle in which they were stationed, and all around which\nrose huge black walls, exhibiting windows in rows of five stories, with\nheavy architraves over each, bearing armorial and religious devices.\n\nThrough this court Catherine Seyton flashed like a hunted doe, making\nthe best use of those pretty legs which had attracted the commendation\neven of the reflective and cautious Adam Woodcock. She hastened towards\na large door in the centre of the lower front of the court, pulled the\nbobbin till the latch flew up, and ensconced herself in the ancient\nmansion. But, if she fled like a doe, Roland Graeme followed with the\nspeed and ardour of a youthful stag-hound, loosed for the first time\non his prey. He kept her in view in spite of her efforts; for it is\nremarkable what an advantage, in such a race, the gallant who desires to\nsee, possesses over the maiden who wishes not to be seen--an advantage\nwhich I have known counterbalance a great start in point of distance.\nIn short, he saw the waving of her screen, or veil, at one corner, heard\nthe tap of her foot, light as that was, as it crossed the court, and\ncaught a glimpse of her figure just as she entered the door of the\nmansion.\n\nRoland Graeme, inconsiderate and headlong as we have described him,\nhaving no knowledge of real life but from the romances which he had\nread, and not an idea of checking himself in the midst of any eager\nimpulse; possessed, besides, of much courage and readiness, never\nhesitated for a moment to approach the door through which the object of\nhis search had disappeared. He, too, pulled the bobbin, and the latch,\nthough heavy and massive, answered to the summons, and arose. The\npage entered with the same precipitation which had marked his whole\nproceeding, and found himself in a large hall, or vestibule, dimly\nenlightened by latticed casements of painted glass, and rendered yet\ndimmer through the exclusion of the sunbeams, owing to the height of the\nwalls of those buildings by which the court-yard was enclosed. The walls\nof the hall were surrounded with suits of ancient and rusted armour,\ninterchanged with huge and massive stone scutcheons, bearing double\ntressures, fleured and counter-fleured, wheat-sheaves, coronets, and so\nforth, things to which Roland Graeme gave not a moment's attention.\n\nIn fact, he only deigned to observe the figure of Catherine Seyton, who,\ndeeming herself safe in the hall, had stopped to take breath after her\ncourse, and was reposing herself for a moment on a large oaken settle\nwhich stood at the upper end of the hall. The noise of Roland's entrance\nat once disturbed her; she started up with a faint scream of surprise,\nand escaped through one of the several folding-doors which opened\ninto this apartment as a common centre. This door, which Roland Graeme\ninstantly approached, opened on a large and well-lighted gallery, at the\nupper end of which he could hear several voices, and the noise of hasty\nsteps approaching towards the hall or vestibule. A little recalled to\nsober thought by an appearance of serious danger, he was deliberating\nwhether he should stand fast or retire, when Catherine Seyton re-entered\nfrom a side door, running towards him with as much speed as a few\nminutes since she had fled from him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, what mischief brought you hither?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfly--fly, or you are\na dead man,--or stay--they come--flight is impossible--say you came to\nask for Lord Seyton.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe sprung from him and disappeared through the door by which she had\nmade her second appearance; and, at the same instant, a pair of large\nfolding-doors at the upper end of the gallery flew open with vehemence,\nand six or seven young gentlemen, richly dressed, pressed forward into\nthe apartment, having, for the greater part, their swords drawn.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho is it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said one, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdare intrude on us in our own mansion?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCut him to pieces,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said another; \u00e2\u0080\u009clet him pay for this day's insolence\nand violence--he is some follower of the Rothes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, by Saint Mary,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said another; \u00e2\u0080\u009che is a follower of the arch-fiend\nand ennobled clown Halbert Glendinning, who takes the style of\nAvenel--once a church-vassal, now a pillager of the church.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a fourth; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know him by the holly-sprig, which is\ntheir cognizance. Secure the door, he must answer for this insolence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTwo of the gallants, hastily drawing their weapons, passed on to the\ndoor by which Roland had entered the hall, and stationed themselves\nthere as if to prevent his escape. The others advanced on Graeme, who\nhad just sense enough to perceive that any attempt at resistance would\nbe alike fruitless and imprudent. At once, and by various voices, none\nof which sounded amicably, the page was required to say who he was,\nwhence he came, his name, his errand, and who sent him hither. The\nnumber of the questions demanded of him at once, afforded a momentary\napology for his remaining silent, and ere that brief truce had elapsed,\na personage entered the hall, at whose appearance those who had gathered\nfiercely around Roland, fell back with respect.\n\nThis was a tall man, whose dark hair was already grizzled, though his\nhigh and haughty features retained all the animation of youth. The upper\npart of his person was undressed to his Holland shirt, whose ample folds\nwere stained with blood. But he wore a mantle of crimson, lined with\nrich fur, cast around him, which supplied the deficiency of his dress.\nOn his head he had a crimson velvet bonnet, looped up on one side with\na small golden chain of many links, which, going thrice around the hat,\nwas fastened by a medal, agreeable to the fashion amongst the grandees\nof the time.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhom have you here, sons and kinsmen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009caround whom you crowd\nthus roughly?--Know you not that the shelter of this roof should secure\nevery one fair treatment, who shall come hither either in fair peace, or\nin open and manly hostility?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut here, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered one of the youths, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis a knave who comes\non treacherous espial!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI deny the charge!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme, boldly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI came to inquire\nafter my Lord Seyton.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA likely tale,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered his accusers, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin the mouth of a follower of\nGlendinning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStay, young men,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lord Seyton, for it was that nobleman\nhimself, \u00e2\u0080\u009clet me look at this youth--By heaven, it is the very same who\ncame so boldly to my side not very many minutes since, when some of my\nown knaves bore themselves with more respect to their own worshipful\nsafety than to mine! Stand back from him, for he well deserves honour\nand a friendly welcome at your hands, instead of this rough treatment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey fell back on all sides, obedient to Lord Seyton's commands, who,\ntaking Roland Graeme by the hand, thanked him for his prompt and gallant\nassistance, adding, that he nothing doubted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe same interest which\nhe had taken in his cause in the affray, brought him hither to inquire\nafter his hurt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland bowed low in acquiescence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOr is there any thing in which I can serve you, to show my sense of\nyour ready gallantry?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut the page, thinking it best to abide by the apology for his visit\nwhich the Lord Seyton had so aptly himself suggested, replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat\nto be assured of his lordship's safety, had been the only cause of his\nintrusion. He judged,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009che had seen him receive some hurt in\nthe affray.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA trifle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Seyton; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had but stripped my doublet, that the\nchirurgeon might put some dressing on the paltry scratch, when these\nrash boys interrupted us with their clamour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland Graeme, making a low obeisance, was now about to depart, for,\nrelieved from the danger of being treated as a spy, he began next to\nfear, that his companion, Adam Woodcock, whom he had so unceremoniously\nquitted, would either bring him into some farther dilemma, by venturing\ninto the hotel in quest of him, or ride off and leave him behind\naltogether. But Lord Seyton did not permit him to escape so easily.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTarry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyoung man, and let me know thy rank and name. The\nSeyton has of late been more wont to see friends and followers shrink\nfrom his side, than to receive aid from strangers-but a new world\nmay come around, in which he may have the chance of rewarding his\nwell-wishers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy name is Roland Graeme, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the youth, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca page, who,\nfor the present, is in the service of Sir Halbert Glendinning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI said so from the first,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said one of the young men; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy life I will\nwager, that this is a shaft out of the heretic's quiver-a stratagem from\nfirst to last, to injeer into your confidence some espial of his own.\nThey know how to teach both boys and women to play the intelligencers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is false, if it be spoken of me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland; \u00e2\u0080\u009cno man in Scotland\nshould teach me such a foul part!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe thee, boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Seyton, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor thy strokes were too fair\nto be dealt upon an understanding with those that were to receive them.\nCredit me, however, I little expected to have help at need from one of\nyour master's household; and I would know what moved thee in my quarrel,\nto thine own endangering?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo please you, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think my master himself would\nnot have stood by, and seen an honourable man borne to earth by odds,\nif his single arm could help him. Such, at least, is the lesson we were\ntaught in chivalry, at the Castle of Avenel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe good seed hath fallen into good ground, young man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Seyton;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cbut, alas! if thou practise such honourable war in these dishonourable\ndays, when right is every where borne down by mastery, thy life, my poor\nboy, will be but a short one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet it be short, so it be honourable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand permit\nme now, my lord, to commend me to your grace, and to take my leave. A\ncomrade waits with my horse in the street.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTake this, however, young man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Seyton,\n\n[Footnote: George, fifth Lord Seton, was immovably faithful to Queen\nMary during all the mutabilities of her fortune. He was grand master of\nthe household, in which capacity he had a picture painted of himself,\nwith his official baton, and the following motto:\n\n  In adversitate, patiens;\n  In prosperitate, benevolus.\n  Hazard, yet forward.\n\nOn various parts of his castle he inscribed, as expressing his religious\nand political creed, the legend:\n\n  Un Dieu, un Foy, un Roy, un Loy.\n\nHe declined to be promoted to an earldom, which Queen Mary offered him\nat the same time when she advanced her natural brother to be Earl of\nMar, and afterwards of Murray.\n\nOn his refusing this honour, Mary wrote, or caused to be written, the\nfollowing lines in Latin and French:\n\n  Sunt comites, ducesque alii; sunt denique reges;\n  Sethom dominum sit satis esse mihi.\n\n  Il y a des comptes, des roys, des ducs; ainsi\n  C'est assez pour moy d'estre Seigneur de Seton.\n\nWhich may be thus rendered:--\n\n  Earl, duke, or king, be thou that list to be:\n  Seton, thy lordship is enough for me.\n\nThis distich reminds us of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cpride which aped humility,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the motto\nof the house of Couci:\n\n  Je suis ni roy, ni prince aussi;\n  Je suis le Seigneur de Coucy.\n\nAfter the battle of Langside, Lord Seton was obliged to retire abroad\nfor safety, and was an exile for two years, during which he was reduced\nto the necessity of driving a waggon in Flanders for his subsistence. He\nrose to favour in James VI's reign, and assuming his paternal property,\nhad himself painted in his waggoner's dress, and in the act of driving\na wain with four horses, on the north end of a stately gallery at Seton\nCastle]\n\nundoing from his bonnet the golden chain and medal, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand wear it for my\nsake.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith no little pride Roland Graeme accepted the gift, which he hastily\nfastened around his bonnet, as he had seen gallants wear such an\nornament, and renewing his obeisance to the Baron, left the hall,\ntraversed the court, and appeared in the street, just as Adam Woodcock,\nvexed and anxious at his delay, had determined to leave the horses to\ntheir fate, and go in quest of his youthful comrade. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhose barn hast\nthou broken next?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed, greatly relieved by his appearance,\nalthough his countenance indicated that he had passed through an\nagitating scene.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAsk me no questions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, leaping gaily on his horse; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut see\nhow short time it takes to win a chain of gold,\u00e2\u0080\u009d pointing to that which\nhe now wore.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, God forbid that thou hast either stolen it, or reft it by\nviolence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the falconer; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor, otherwise, I wot not how the devil\nthou couldst compass it. I have been often here, ay, for months at an\nend, and no one gave me either chain or medal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThou seest I have got one on shorter acquaintance with the city,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n answered the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut set thine honest heart at rest; that which is\nfairly won and freely given, is neither reft nor stolen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMarry, hang thee, with thy fanfarona [Footnote: A name given to the\ngold chains worn by the military men of the period. It is of Spanish\norigin: for the fashion of wearing these costly ornaments was much\nfollowed amongst the conquerors of the New World.] about thy neck!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nthe falconer; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think water will not drown, nor hemp strangle thee.\nThou hast been discarded as my lady's page, to come in again as my\nlord's squire; and for following a noble young damsel into some great\nhousehold, thou gettest a chain and medal, where another would have\nhad the baton across his shoulders, if he missed having the dirk in his\nbody. But here we come in front of the old Abbey. Bear thy good luck\nwith you when you cross these paved stones, and, by our Lady, you may\nbrag Scotland.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs he spoke, they checked their horses, where the huge old vaulted\nentrance to the Abbey or Palace of Holyrood crossed the termination of\nthe street down which they had proceeded. The courtyard of the palace\nopened within this gloomy porch, showing the front of an irregular pile\nof monastic buildings, one wing of which is still extant, forming a part\nof the modern palace, erected in the days of Charles I.\n\nAt the gate of the porch the falconer and page resigned their horses to\nthe serving-man in attendance; the falconer commanding him with an air\nof authority, to carry them safely to the stables. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe follow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Knight of Avenel--We must bear ourselves for what we are here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said he in a whisper to Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor every one here is looked on as they\ndemean themselves; and he that is too modest must to the wall, as the\nproverb says; therefore cock thy bonnet, man, and let us brook the\ncauseway bravely.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAssuming, therefore, an air of consequence, corresponding to what he\nsupposed to be his master's importance and quality, Adam Woodcock led\nthe way into the courtyard of the Palace of Holyrood.\n\nHe appears to have been fond of the arts; for there exists a beautiful\nfamily-piece of him in the centre of his family. Mr. Pinkerton, in his\nScottish Iconographia, published an engraving of this curious portrait.\nThe original is the property of Lord Somerville, nearly connected with\nthe Seton family, and is at present at his lordship's fishing villa of\nthe Pavilion, near Melrose.\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Eighteenth.\n\n\n  --The sky is clouded, Gaspard,\n  And the vexed ocean sleeps a troubled sleep,\n  Beneath a lurid gleam of parting sunshine.\n  Such slumber hangs o'er discontented lands,\n  While factions doubt, as yet, if they have strength\n  To front the open battle.\n                             ALBION--A POEM.\n\nThe youthful page paused on the entrance of the court-yard, and implored\nhis guide to give him a moment's breathing space. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me but look\naround me, man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou consider not I have never seen such a\nscene as this before.--And this is Holyrood--the resort of the gallant\nand gay, and the fair, and the wise, and the powerful!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, marry, is it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Woodcock; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I wish I could hood thee as they\ndo the hawks, for thou starest as wildly as if you sought another fray\nor another fanfarona. I would I had thee safely housed, for thou lookest\nwild as a goss-hawk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was indeed no common sight to Roland, the vestibule of a palace\ntraversed by its various groups,--some radiant with gaiety--some\npensive, and apparently weighed down by affairs concerning the state, or\nconcerning themselves. Here the hoary statesman, with his cautious\nyet commanding look, his furred cloak and sable pantoufles; there the\nsoldier in buff and steel, his long sword jarring against the pavement,\nand his whiskered upper lip and frowning brow, looking an habitual\ndefiance of danger, which perhaps was not always made good; there again\npassed my lord's serving-man, high of heart, and bloody of hand, humble\nto his master and his master's equals, insolent to all others. To these\nmight be added, the poor suitor, with his anxious look and depressed\nmien--the officer, full of his brief authority, elbowing his betters,\nand possibly his benefactors, out of the road--the proud priest, who\nsought a better benefice--the proud baron, who sought a grant of church\nlands--the robber chief, who came to solicit a pardon for the injuries\nhe had inflicted on his neighbors--the plundered franklin, who came to\nseek vengeance for that which he had himself received. Besides there was\nthe mustering and disposition of guards and soldiers--the despatching of\nmessengers, and the receiving them--the trampling and neighing of horses\nwithout the gate--the flashing of arms, and rustling of plumes, and\njingling of spurs, within it. In short, it was that gay and splendid\nconfusion, in which the eye of youth sees all that is brave and\nbrilliant, and that of experience much that is doubtful, deceitful,\nfalse, and hollow--hopes that will never be gratified--promises\nwhich will never be fulfilled--pride in the disguise of humility--and\ninsolence in that of frank and generous bounty.\n\nAs, tired of the eager and enraptured attention which the page gave to\na scene so new to him, Adam Woodcock endeavoured to get him to move\nforward, before his exuberance of astonishment should attract the\nobservation of the sharp-witted denizens of the court, the falconer\nhimself became an object of attention to a gay menial in a dark-green\nbonnet and feather, with a cloak of a corresponding colour, laid down,\nas the phrase then went, by six broad bars of silver lace, and welted\nwith violet and silver. The words of recognition burst from both\nat once. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat! Adam Woodcock at court!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat! Michael\nWing-the-wind--and how runs the hackit greyhound bitch now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe waur for the wear, like ourselves, Adam--eight years this grass--no\nfour legs will carry a dog forever; but we keep her for the breed, and\nso she 'scapes Border doom--But why stand you gazing there? I promise\nyou my lord has wished for you, and asked for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy Lord of Murray asked for me, and he Regent of the kingdom too!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nAdam. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hunger and thirst to pay my duty to my good lord;--but I fancy\nhis good lordship remembers the day's sport on Carnwath-moor; and my\nDrummelzier falcon, that beat the hawks from the Isle of Man, and won\nhis lordship a hundred crowns from the Southern baron whom they called\nStanley.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, not to flatter thee, Adam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his court-friend, \u00e2\u0080\u009che remembers\nnought of thee, or of thy falcon either. He hath flown many a higher\nflight since that, and struck his quarry too. But come, come hither\naway; I trust we are to be good comrades on the old score.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Adam, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou would have me crush a pot with you; but I must\nfirst dispose of my eyas, where he will neither have girl to chase, nor\nlad to draw sword upon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs the youngster such a one?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Michael.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, by my hood, he flies at all game,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Woodcock.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen had he better come with us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Michael Wing-the-wind; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor we\ncannot have a proper carouse just now, only I would wet my lips, and so\nmust you. I want to hear the news from Saint Mary's before you see my\nlord, and I will let you know how the wind sits up yonder.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhile he thus spoke, he led the way to a side door which opened into the\ncourt; and threading several dark passages with the air of one who knew\nthe most secret recesses of the palace, conducted them to a small matted\nchamber, where he placed bread and cheese and a foaming flagon of ale\nbefore the falconer and his young companion, who immediately did justice\nto the latter in a hearty draught, which nearly emptied the measure.\nHaving drawn his breath, and dashed the froth from his whiskers, he\nobserved, that his anxiety for the boy had made him deadly dry.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMend your draught,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his hospitable friend, again supplying\nthe flagon from a pitcher which stood beside. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know the way to the\nbutterybar. And now, mind what I say--this morning the Earl of Morton\ncame to my lord in a mighty chafe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat! they keep the old friendship, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Woodcock.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay, man, what else?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Michael; \u00e2\u0080\u009cone hand must scratch the\nother. But in a mighty chafe was my Lord of Morton, who, to say truth,\nlooketh on such occasions altogether uncanny, and, as it were, fiendish;\nand he says to my lord,--for I was in the chamber taking orders about\na cast of hawks that are to be fetched from Darnoway--they match your\nlong-winged falcons, friend Adam.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will believe that when I see them fly as high a pitch,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied\nWoodcock, this professional observation forming a sort of parenthesis.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHowever,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Michael, pursuing his tale, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy Lord of Morton, in a\nmighty chafe, asked my Lord Regent whether he was well dealt with--'for\nmy brother,' said he, 'should have had a gift to be Commendator of\nKennaqubair, and to have all the temporalities erected into a lordship\nof regality for his benefit; and here,' said he, 'the false monks have\nhad the insolence to choose a new Abbot to put his claim in my brother's\nway; and moreover, the rascality of the neighbourhood have burnt and\nplundered all that was left in the Abbey, so that my brother will\nnot have a house to dwell in, when he hath ousted the lazy hounds of\npriests.' And my lord, seeing him chafed, said mildly to him, 'These\nare shrewd tidings, Douglas, but I trust they be not true; for Halbert\nGlendinning went southward yesterday, with a band of spears, and\nassuredly, had either of these chances happened, that the monks had\npresumed to choose an Abbot, or that the Abbey had been burnt, as\nyou say, he had taken order on the spot for the punishment of such\ninsolence, and had despatched us a messenger.' And the Earl of Morton\nreplied--now I pray you, Adam, to notice, that I say this out of love\nto you and your lord, and also for old comradeship, and also because Sir\nHalbert hath done me good, and may again--and also because I love not\nthe Earl of Morton, as indeed more fear than like him--so then it were\na foul deed in you to betray me.--'But,' said the Earl to the Regent,\n'take heed, my lord, you trust not this Glendinning too far--he comes\nof churl's blood, which was never true to the nobles'--by Saint Andrew,\nthese were his very words.--'And besides,' he said, 'he hath a brother,\na monk in Saint Mary's, and walks all by his guidance, and is making\nfriends on the Border with Buccleuch and with Ferniehirst, [Footnote:\nBoth these Border Chieftains were great friends of Queen Mary.] and will\njoin hand with them, were there likelihood of a new world.' And my lord\nanswered, like a free noble lord as he is; 'Tush! my Lord of Morton, I\nwill be warrant for Glendinning's faith; and for his brother, he is a\ndreamer, that thinks of nought but book and breviary--and if such hap\nhave chanced as you tell of, I look to receive from Glendinning the cowl\nof a hanged monk, and the head of a riotous churl, by way of sharp\nand sudden justice.'--And my Lord of Morton left the place, and, as it\nseemed to me, somewhat malecontent. But since that time, my lord has\nasked me more than once whether there has arrived no messenger from the\nKnight of Avenel. And all this I have told you, that you may frame your\ndiscourse to the best purpose, for it seems to me that my lord will not\nbe well-pleased, if aught has happened like what my Lord of Morton said,\nand if your lord hath not ta'en strict orders with it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was something in this communication which fairly blanked the bold\nvisage of Adam Woodcock, in spite of the reinforcement which his natural\nhardihood had received from the berry-brown ale of Holyrood.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat was it he said about a churl's head, that grim Lord of Morton?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said the discontented falconer to his friend.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, it was my Lord Regent, who said that he expected, if the Abbey was\ninjured, your Knight would send him the head of the ringleader among the\nrioters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, but is this done like a good Protestant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Adam Woodcock,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cor a true Lord of the Congregation? We used to be their white-boys and\ndarlings when we pulled down the convents in Fife and Perthshire.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAy,\nbut that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Michael, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas when old mother Rome held her own, and our\ngreat folks were determined she should have no shelter for her head in\nScotland. But, now that the priests are fled in all quarters, and their\nhouses and lands are given to our grandees, they cannot see that we are\nworking the work of reformation in destroying the palaces of zealous\nProtestants.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I tell you Saint Mary's is not destroyed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Woodcock, in\nincreasing agitation; \u00e2\u0080\u009csome trash of painted windows there were\nbroken--things that no nobleman could have brooked in his house--some\nstone saints were brought on their marrow-bones, like old Widdrington at\nChevy-Chase; but as for fire-raising, there was not so much as a lighted\nlunt amongst us, save the match which the dragon had to light the\nburning tow withal, which he was to spit against Saint George; nay, I\nhad caution of that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow! Adam Woodcock,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his comrade, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI trust thou hadst no hand in\nsuch a fair work? Look you, Adam, I were loth to terrify you, and you\njust come from a journey; but I promise you, Earl Morton hath brought\nyou down a Maiden from Halifax, you never saw the like of her--and\nshe'll clasp you round the neck, and your head will remain in her arms.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPshaw!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Adam, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am too old to have my head turned by any\nmaiden of them all. I know my Lord of Morton will go as far for a buxom\nlass as anyone; but what the devil took him to Halifax all the way? and\nif he has got a gamester there, what hath she to do with my head?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMuch, much!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Michael. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHerod's daughter, who did such\nexecution with her foot and ankle, danced not men's heads off more\ncleanly than this maiden of Morton. [Footnote: Maiden of Morton--a\nspecies of Guillotine which the Regent Morton brought down from Halifax,\ncertainly at a period considerably later than intimated in the tale. He\nwas himself the first who suffered by the engine.] 'Tis an axe, man,--an\naxe which falls of itself like a sash window, and never gives the\nheadsmen the trouble to wield it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy my faith, a shrewd device,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Woodcock; \u00e2\u0080\u009cheaven keep us free\non't!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe page, seeing no end to the conversation betwixt these two old\ncomrades, and anxious from what he had heard, concerning the fate of the\nAbbot, now interrupted their conference.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMethinks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAdam Woodcock, thou hadst better deliver thy\nmaster's letter to the Regent; questionless he hath therein stated\nwhat has chanced at Kennaquhair, in the way most advantageous for all\nconcerned.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe boy is right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Michael Wing-the-wind, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy lord will be very\nimpatient.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe child hath wit enough to keep himself warm,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Adam Woodcock,\nproducing from his hawking-bag his lord's letter, addressed to the Earl\nof Murray, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand for that matter so have I. So, Master Roland, you will\ne'en please to present this yourself to the Lord Regent; his presence\nwill be better graced by a young page than by an old falconer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell said, canny Yorkshire!\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied his friend; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand but now you were\nso earnest to see our good lord!--Why, wouldst thou put the lad into\nthe noose that thou mayst slip tether thyself?--or dost thou think\nthe maiden will clasp his fair young neck more willingly than thy old\nsunburnt weasand?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo to,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the falconer; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthy wit towers high an it could strike\nthe quarry. I tell thee, the youth has nought to fear--he had nothing\nto do with the gambol--a rare gambol it was, Michael, as mad-caps ever\nplayed; and I had made as rare a ballad, if we had had the luck to get\nit sung to an end. But mum for that--_tace_, as I said before, is Latin\nfor a candle. Carry the youth to the presence, and I will remain here,\nwith bridle in hand, ready to strike the spurs up to the rowel-heads, in\ncase the hawk flies my way.--I will soon put Soltraedge, I trow, betwixt\nthe Regent and me, if he means me less than fair play.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome on then, my lad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Michael, \u00e2\u0080\u009csince thou must needs take\nthe spring before canny Yorkshire.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he led the way through\nwinding passages, closely followed by Roland Graeme, until they arrived\nat a large winding stone stair, the steps of which were so long and\nbroad, and at the same time so low, as to render the ascent uncommonly\neasy. When they had ascended about the height of one story, the\nguide stepped aside, and pushed open the door of a dark and gloomy\nantechamber; so dark, indeed, that his youthful companion stumbled, and\nnearly fell down upon a low step, which was awkwardly placed on the very\nthreshold.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTake heed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Michael Wing-the-wind, in a very low tone of voice,\nand first glancing cautiously round to see if any one listened--\u00e2\u0080\u009cTake\nheed, my young friend, for those who fall on these boards seldom rise\nagain--Seest thou that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, in a still lower voice, pointing to\nsome dark crimson stains on the floor, on which a ray of light, shot\nthrough a small aperture, and traversing the general gloom of the\napartment, fell with mottled radiance--\u00e2\u0080\u009cSeest thou that, youth?--walk\nwarily, for men have fallen here before you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat mean you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, his flesh creeping, though he scarce\nknew why; \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it blood?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the domestic, in the same whispering tone, and dragging\nthe youth on by the arm--\u00e2\u0080\u009cBlood it is,--but this is no time to question,\nor even to look at it. Blood it is, foully and fearfully shed, as foully\nand fearfully avenged. The blood,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, in a still more cautious\ntone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cof Seignior David.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland Graeme's heart throbbed when he found himself so unexpectedly in\nthe scene of Rizzio's slaughter, a catastrophe which had chilled with\nhorror all even in that rude age, which had been the theme of wonder and\npity through every cottage and castle in Scotland, and had not escaped\nthat of Avenel. But his guide hurried him forward, permitting no farther\nquestion, and with the manner of one who has already tampered too much\nwith a dangerous subject. A tap which he made at a low door at one end\nof the vestibule, was answered by a huissier or usher, who, opening\nit cautiously, received Michael's intimation that a page waited the\nRegent's leisure, who brought letters from the Knight of Avenel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Council is breaking up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the usher; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut give me the packet;\nhis Grace the Regent will presently see the messenger.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe packet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmust be delivered into the Regent's own\nhands; such were the orders of my master.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe usher looked at him from head to foot, as if surprised at his\nboldness, and then replied, with some asperity, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSay you so, my young\nmaster? Thou crowest loudly to be but a chicken, and from a country\nbarn-yard too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWere it a time or place,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthou shouldst see I can do\nmore than crow; but do your duty, and let the Regent know I wait his\npleasure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThou art but a pert knave to tell me of my duty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the courtier\nin office; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I will find a time to show you you are out of yours;\nmeanwhile, wait there till you are wanted.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he shut the door\nin Roland's face.\n\nMichael Wing-the-wind, who had shrunk from his youthful companion during\nthis altercation, according to the established maxim of courtiers of\nall ranks, and in all ages, now transgressed their prudential line of\nconduct so far as to come up to him once more. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThou art a hopeful young\nspringald,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I see right well old Yorkshire had reason in\nhis caution. Thou hast been five minutes in the court, and hast employed\nthy time so well, as to make a powerful and a mortal enemy out of the\nusher of the council-chamber. Why, man, you might almost as well have\noffended the deputy butler!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI care not what he is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will teach whomever I\nspeak with to speak civilly to me in return. I did not come from Avenel\nto be browbeaten in Holyrood.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBravo, my lad!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Michael; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is a fine spirit if you can but hold\nit--but see, the door opens.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe usher appeared, and, in a more civil tone of voice and manner, said,\nthat his Grace the Regent would receive the Knight of Avenel's message;\nand accordingly marshalled Roland Graeme the way into the apartment,\nfrom which the Council had been just dismissed, after finishing their\nconsultations. There was in the room a long oaken table, surrounded by\nstools of the same wood, with a large elbow chair, covered with crimson\nvelvet, at the head. Writing materials and papers were lying there\nin apparent disorder; and one or two of the privy counsellors who had\nlingered behind, assuming their cloaks, bonnets, and swords, and bidding\nfarewell to the Regent, were departing slowly by a large door, on the\nopposite side to that through which the page entered. Apparently the\nEarl of Murray had made some jest, for the smiling countenances of the\nstatesmen expressed that sort of cordial reception which is paid by\ncourtiers to the condescending pleasantries of a prince.\n\nThe Regent himself was laughing heartily as he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFarewell, my\nlords, and hold me remembered to the Cock of the North.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe then turned slowly round towards Roland Graeme, and the marks of\ngaiety, real or assumed, disappeared from his countenance, as completely\nas the passing bubbles leave the dark mirror of a still profound lake\ninto which a traveller has cast a stone; in the course of a minute his\nnoble features had assumed their natural expression of deep and even\nmelancholy gravity.\n\nThis distinguished statesman, for as such his worst enemies acknowledged\nhim, possessed all the external dignity, as well as almost all the\nnoble qualities, which could grace the power that he enjoyed; and had he\nsucceeded to the throne as his legitimate inheritance, it is probable he\nwould have been recorded as one of Scotland's wisest and greatest kings.\nBut that he held his authority by the deposition and imprisonment of\nhis sister and benefactress, was a crime which those only can excuse\nwho think ambition an apology for ingratitude. He was dressed plainly\nin black velvet, after the Flemish fashion, and wore in his high-crowned\nhat a jewelled clasp, which looped it up on one side, and formed the\nonly ornament of his apparel. He had his poniard by his side, and his\nsword lay on the council table.\n\nSuch was the personage before whom Roland Graeme now presented himself,\nwith a feeling of breathless awe, very different from the usual boldness\nand vivacity of his temper. In fact, he was, from education and nature,\nforward, but not impudent, and was much more easily controlled by the\nmoral superiority, arising from the elevated talents and renown of those\nwith whom he conversed, than by pretensions founded only on rank or\nexternal show. He might have braved with indifference the presence of an\nearl, merely distinguished by his belt and coronet; but he felt overawed\nin that of the eminent soldier and statesman, the wielder of a nation's\npower, and the leader of her armies.--The greatest and wisest are\nflattered by the deference of youth--so graceful and becoming in itself;\nand Murray took, with much courtesy, the letter from the hands of\nthe abashed and blushing page, and answered with complaisance to the\nimperfect and half-muttered greeting, which he endeavoured to deliver to\nhim on the part of Sir Halbert of Avenel. He even paused a moment ere\nhe broke the silk with which the letter was secured, to ask the page his\nname--so much he was struck with his very handsome features and form.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRoland Graeme,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, repeating the words after the hesitating page.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat! of the Grahams of the Lennox?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Roland; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy parents dwelt in the Debateable\nLand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMurray made no further inquiry, but proceeded to read his dispatches;\nduring the perusal of which his brow began to assume a stern expression\nof displeasure, as that of one who found something which at once\nsurprised and disturbed him. He sat down on the nearest seat, frowned\ntill his eyebrows almost met together, read the letter twice over, and\nwas then silent for several minutes. At length, raising his head, his\neye encountered that of the usher, who in vain endeavoured to exchange\nthe look of eager and curious observation with which he had been\nperusing the Regent's features, for that open and unnoticing expression\nof countenance, which, in looking at all, seems as if it saw and marked\nnothing--a cast of look which may be practised with advantage by all\nthose, of whatever degree, who are admitted to witness the familiar and\nunguarded hours of their superiors. Great men are as jealous of their\nthoughts as the wife of King Candaules was of her charms, and will as\nreadily punish those who have, however involuntarily, beheld them in\nmental deshabille and exposure.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLeave the apartment, Hyndman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Regent, sternly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand carry\nyour observation elsewhere. You are too knowing, sir, for your post,\nwhich, by special order, is destined for men of blunter capacity. So!\nnow you look more like a fool than you did,\u00e2\u0080\u009d--(for Hyndman, as may\neasily be supposed, was not a little disconcerted by this rebuke)--\u00e2\u0080\u009ckeep\nthat confused stare, and it may keep your office. Begone, sir!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe usher departed in dismay, not forgetting to register, amongst his\nother causes of dislike to Roland Graeme, that he had been the witness\nof this disgraceful chiding. When he had left the apartment, the Regent\nagain addressed the page.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour name, you say, is Armstrong?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy name is Graeme, so please you--Roland Graeme,\nwhose forbears were designated of Heathergill, in the Debateable Land.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, I knew it was a name from the Debateable Land. Hast thou any\nacquaintance in Edinburgh?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Roland, willing rather to evade this question than\nto answer it directly, for the prudence of being silent with respect\nto Lord Seyton's adventure immediately struck him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have been in\nEdinburgh scarce an hour, and that for the first time in my life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat! and thou Sir Halbert Glendinning's page?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Regent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was brought up as my Lady's page,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the youth, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand left Avenel\nCastle for the first time in my life--at least since my childhood--only\nthree days since.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy Lady's page!\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeated the Earl of Murray, as if speaking to\nhimself; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit was strange to send his Lady's page on a matter of such\ndeep concernment--Morton will say it is of a piece with the nomination\nof his brother to be Abbot; and yet in some sort an inexperienced youth\nwill best serve the turn.--What hast thou been taught, young man, in thy\ndoughty apprenticeship?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo hunt, my lord, and to hawk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo hunt coneys, and to hawk at ouzels!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Regent, smiling; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor\nsuch are the sports of ladies and their followers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGraeme's cheek reddened deeply as he replied, not without some emphasis,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo hunt red-deer of the first head, and to strike down herons of the\nhighest soar, my lord, which, in Lothian speech, may be termed, for\naught I know, coneys and ouzels;-also I can wield a brand and couch a\nlance, according to our Border meaning; in inland speech these may be\ntermed water-flags and bulrushes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThy speech rings like metal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Regent, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I pardon the\nsharpness of it for the truth.--Thou knowest, then, what belongs to the\nduty of a man-at-arms?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo far as exercise can teach--it without real service in the field,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n answered Roland Graeme; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut our Knight permitted none of his household\nto make raids, and I never had the good fortune to see a stricken\nfield.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe good fortune!\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeated the Regent, smiling somewhat sorrowfully,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009ctake my word, young man, war is the only game from which both parties\nrise losers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot always, my lord!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the page, with his characteristic\naudacity, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif fame speaks truth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow, sir?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Regent, colouring in his turn, and perhaps\nsuspecting an indiscreet allusion to the height which he himself had\nattained by the hap of civil war.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme, without change of tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009che who\nfights well, must have fame in life, or honour in death; and so war is a\ngame from which no one can rise a loser.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Regent smiled and shook his head, when at that moment the door\nopened, and the Earl of Morton presented himself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI come somewhat hastily,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I enter unannounced because my\nnews are of weight--It is as I said; Edward Glendinning is named Abbot,\nand--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHush, my lord!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Regent, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know it, but--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd perhaps you knew it before I did, my Lord of Murray,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered\nMorton, his dark red brow growing darker and redder as he spoke.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMorton,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Murray, \u00e2\u0080\u009csuspect me not--touch not mine honour--I have\nto suffer enough from the calumnies of foes, let me not have to contend\nwith the unjust suspicions of my friends.--We are not alone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he,\nrecollecting himself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cor I could tell you more.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe led Morton into one of the deep embrasures which the windows formed\nin the massive wall, and which afforded a retiring place for their\nconversing apart. In this recess, Roland observed them speak together\nwith much earnestness, Murray appearing to be grave and earnest, and\nMorton having a jealous and offended air, which seemed gradually to give\nway to the assurances of the Regent.\n\nAs their conversation grew more earnest, they became gradually louder\nin speech, having perhaps forgotten the presence of the page, the more\nreadily as his position in the apartment placed him put of sight, so\nthat he found himself unwillingly privy to more of their discourse than\nhe cared to hear. For, page though he was, a mean curiosity after the\nsecrets of others had never been numbered amongst Roland's failings;\nand moreover, with all his natural rashness, he could not but doubt the\nsafety of becoming privy to the secret discourse of these powerful and\ndreaded men. Still he could neither stop his ears, nor with propriety\nleave the apartment; and while he thought of some means of signifying\nhis presence, he had already heard so much, that, to have produced\nhimself suddenly would have been as awkward, and perhaps as dangerous,\nas in quiet to abide the end of their conference. What he overheard,\nhowever, was but an imperfect part of their communication; and although\nan expert politician, acquainted with the circumstances of the times,\nwould have had little difficulty in tracing the meaning, yet Roland\nGraeme could only form very general and vague conjectures as to the\nimport of their discourse.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll is prepared,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Murray, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand Lindsay is setting forward--She\nmust hesitate no longer--thou seest I act by thy counsel, and harden\nmyself against softer considerations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrue, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Morton, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin what is necessary to gain power,\nyou do not hesitate, but go boldly to the mark. But are you as careful\nto defend and preserve what you have won?--Why this establishment of\ndomestics around her?--has not your sister men and maidens enough\nto tend her, but you must consent to this superfluous and dangerous\nretinue?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor shame, Morton!--a Princess, and my sister, could I do less than\nallow her due attendance?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Morton, \u00e2\u0080\u009ceven thus fly all your shafts--smartly enough\nloosened from the bow, and not unskilfully aimed--but a breath of\nfoolish affection ever crosses in the mid volley, and sways the arrow\nfrom the mark.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSay not so, Morton,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Murray, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have both dared and done--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, enough to gain, but not enough to keep--reckon not that she will\nthink and act thus--you have wounded her deeply, both in pride and\nin power--it signifies nought, that you would tent now the wound with\nunavailing salves--as matters stand with you, you must forfeit the\ntitle of an affectionate brother, to hold that of a bold and determined\nstatesman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMorton!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Murray, with some impatience, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI brook not these\ntaunts--what I have done I have done--what I must farther do, I must\nand will--but I am not made of iron like thee, and I cannot but\nremember--Enough of this-my purpose holds.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I warrant me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Morton, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe choice of these domestic\nconsolations will rest with--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHere he whispered names which escaped Roland Graeme's ear. Murray\nreplied in a similar tone, but so much raised towards the conclusion, of\nthe sentence, that the page heard these words--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd of him I hold myself\nsecure, by Glendinning's recommendation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, which may be as much trustworthy as his late conduct at the Abbey\nof Saint Mary's--you have heard that his brother's election has taken\nplace. Your favourite Sir Halbert, my Lord of Murray, has as much\nfraternal affection as yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy heaven, Morton, that taunt demanded an unfriendly answer, but I\npardon it, for your brother also is concerned; but this election shall\nbe annulled. I tell you, Earl of Morton, while I hold the sword of state\nin my royal nephew's name, neither Lord nor Knight in Scotland shall\ndispute my authority; and if I bear--with insults from my friends, it is\nonly while I know them to be such, and forgive their follies for their\nfaithfulness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMorton muttered what seemed to be some excuse, and the Regent answered\nhim in a milder tone, and then subjoined, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBesides, I have another\npledge than Glendinning's recommendation, for this youth's fidelity--his\nnearest relative has placed herself in my hands as his security, to be\ndealt withal as his doings shall deserve.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is something,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Morton; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut yet in fair love and goodwill,\nI must still pray you to keep on your guard. The foes are stirring\nagain, as horse-flies and hornets become busy so soon as the storm-blast\nis over. George of Seyton was crossing the causeway this morning with a\nscore of men at his back, and had a ruffle with my friends of the\nhouse of Leslie--they met at the Tron, and were fighting hard, when the\nprovost, with his guard of partisans, came in thirdsman, and staved them\nasunder with their halberds, as men part dog and bear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe hath my order for such interference,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Regent--\u00e2\u0080\u009cHas any one\nbeen hurt?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGeorge of Seyton himself, by black Ralph Leslie--the devil take the\nrapier that ran not through from side to side! Ralph has a bloody\ncoxcomb, by a blow from a messan-page whom nobody knew--Dick Seyton of\nWindygowl is run through the arm, and two gallants of the Leslies have\nsuffered phlebotomy. This is all the gentle blood which has been spilled\nin the revel; but a yeoman or two on both sides have had bones broken\nand ears chopped. The ostlere-wives, who are like to be the only losers\nby their miscarriage, have dragged the knaves off the street, and are\ncrying a drunken coronach over them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou take it lightly, Douglas,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Regent; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthese broils and feuds\nwould shame the capital of the great Turk, let alone that of a Christian\nand reformed state. But, if I live, this gear shall be amended; and men\nshall say, when they read my story, that if it were my cruel hap to rise\nto power by the dethronement of a sister, I employed it, when gained,\nfor the benefit of the commonweal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd of your friends,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Morton; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwherefore I trust for your\ninstant order annulling the election of this lurdane Abbot, Edward\nGlendinning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou shall be presently satisfied.\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Regent; and stepping\nforward, he began to call, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo ho, Hyndman!\u00e2\u0080\u009d when suddenly his eye\nlighted on Roland Graeme--\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy my faith, Douglas,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, turning to\nhis friend, \u00e2\u0080\u009chere have been three at counsel!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, but only two can keep counsel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Morton; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe galliard must be\ndisposed of.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor shame, Morton--an orphan boy!--Hearken thee, my child--Thou hast\ntold me some of thy accomplishments--canst thou speak truth?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, my\nlord, when it serves my turn,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Graeme.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt shall serve thy turn now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Regent; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand falsehood shall be\nthy destruction. How much hast thou heard or understood of what we two\nhave spoken together?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut little, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Roland Graeme boldly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich met my\napprehension, saving that it seemed to me as if in something you doubted\nthe faith of the Knight of Avenel, under whose roof I was nurtured.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what hast thou to say on that point, young man?\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued the\nRegent, bending his eyes upon him with a keen and strong expression of\nobservation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdepends on the quality of those who speak\nagainst his honour whose bread I have long eaten. If they be my\ninferiors, I say they lie, and will maintain what I say with my baton;\nif my equals, still I say they lie, and will do battle in the quarrel,\nif they list, with my sword; if my superiors\u00e2\u0080\u009d--he paused.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cProceed boldly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Regent--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat if thy superiors said aught\nthat nearly touched your master's honour?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would say,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Graeme, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat he did ill to slander the absent,\nand that my master was a man who could render an account of his actions\nto any one who should manfully demand it of him to his face.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd it were manfully said,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Regent--\u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat thinkest thou, my\nLord of Morton?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Morton, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat if the young galliard resemble a\ncertain ancient friend of ours, as much in the craft of his disposition\nas he does in eye and in brow, there may be a wide difference betwixt\nwhat he means and what he speaks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd whom meanest thou that he resembles so closely?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Murray.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEven the true and trusty Julian Avenel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Morton.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut this youth belongs to the Debateable Land,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Murray.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt may be so; but Julian was an outlaying striker of venison, and made\nmany a far cast when he had a fair doe in chase.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPshaw!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Regent, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is but idle talk--Here,\nthou Hyndman--thou curiosity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d calling to the usher, who now\nentered,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cconduct this youth to his companion--You will both,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsaid to Graeme, \u00e2\u0080\u009ckeep yourselves in readiness to travel on short\nnotice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--And then motioning to him courteously to withdraw, he broke up\nthe interview.\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Nineteenth.\n\n\n  It is and is not--'tis the thing I sought for,\n  Have kneel'd for, pray'd for, risk'd my fame and life for,\n  And yet it is not--no more than the shadow\n  Upon the hard, cold, flat, and polished mirror,\n  Is the warm, graceful, rounded, living substance\n  Which it presents in form and lineament.\n                                     OLD PLAY.\n\nThe usher, with gravity which ill concealed a jealous scowl, conducted\nRoland Graeme to a lower apartment, where he found his comrade the\nfalconer. The man of office then briefly acquainted them that this would\nbe their residence till his Grace's farther orders; that they were to go\nto the pantry, to the buttery, to the cellar, and to the kitchen, at\nthe usual hours, to receive the allowances becoming their\nstation,--instructions which Adam Woodcock's old familiarity with the\ncourt made him perfectly understand--\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor your beds,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou must\ngo to the hostelry of Saint Michael's, in respect the palace is now full\nof the domestics of the greater nobles.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNo sooner was the usher's back turned than Adam exclaimed with all\nthe glee of eager curiosity, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now, Master Roland, the news--the\nnews--come unbutton thy pouch, and give us thy tidings--What says the\nRegent? asks he for Adam Woodcock?--and is all soldered up, or must the\nAbbot of Unreason strap for it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll is well in that quarter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand for the rest--But,\nhey-day, what! have you taken the chain and medal off from my bonnet?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd meet time it was, when yon usher, vinegar-faced rogue that he is,\nbegan to inquire what Popish trangam you were wearing.--By the mass, the\nmetal would have been confiscated for conscience-sake, like your other\nrattle-trap yonder at Avenel, which Mistress Lilias bears about on her\nshoes in the guise of a pair of shoe-buckles--This comes of carrying\nPopish nicknackets about you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe jade!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Roland Graeme, \u00e2\u0080\u009chas she melted down my rosary into\nbuckles for her clumsy hoofs, which will set off such a garnish nearly\nas well as a cow's might?--But, hang her, let her keep them--many a\ndog's trick have I played old Lilias, for want of having something\nbetter to do, and the buckles will serve for a remembrance. Do you\nremember the verjuice I put into the comfits, when old Wingate and she\nwere to breakfast together on Easter morning?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn troth do I, Master Roland--the major-domo's mouth was as crooked as\na hawk's beak for the whole morning afterwards, and any other page in\nyour room would have tasted the discipline of the porter's lodge for it.\nBut my Lady's favour stood between your skin and many a jerking--Lord\nsend you may be the better for her protection in such matters!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am least grateful for it, Adam! and I am glad you put me in mind of\nit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, but the news, my young master,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Woodcock, \u00e2\u0080\u009cspell me the\ntidings--what are we to fly at next?--what did the Regent say to you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing that I am to repeat again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme, shaking his\nhead.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, hey-day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Adam, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow prudent we are become all of a sudden!\nYou have advanced rarely in brief space, Master Roland. You have well\nnigh had your head broken, and you have gained your gold chain, and you\nhave made an enemy, Master Usher to wit, with his two legs like hawks'\nperches, and you have had audience of the first man in the realm, and\nbear as much mystery in your brow, as if you had flown in the court-sky\never since you were hatched. I believe, in my soul, you would run with a\npiece of the egg-shell on your head like the curlews, which (I would we\nwere after them again) we used to call whaups in the Halidome and its\nneighbourhood. But sit thee down, boy; Adam Woodcock was never the lad\nto seek to enter into forbidden secrets--sit thee down, and I will go\nand fetch the vivers--I know the butler and the pantler of old.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe good-natured falconer set forth upon his errand, busying himself\nabout procuring their refreshment; and, during his absence, Roland\nGraeme abandoned himself to the strange, complicated, and yet\nheart-stirring reflections, to which the events of the morning had given\nrise. Yesterday he was of neither mark nor likelihood; a vagrant boy,\nthe attendant on a relative, of whose sane judgment he himself had\nnot the highest opinion; but now he had become, he knew not why, or\nwherefore, or to what extent, the custodier, as the Scottish phrase\nwent, of some important state secret, in the safe keeping of which the\nRegent himself was concerned. It did not diminish from, but rather added\nto the interest of a situation so unexpected, that Roland himself\ndid not perfectly understand wherein he stood committed by the state\nsecrets, in which he had unwittingly become participator. On the\ncontrary, he felt like one who looks on a romantic landscape, of which\nhe sees the features for the first time, and then obscured with mist and\ndriving tempest. The imperfect glimpse which the eye catches of rocks,\ntrees, and other objects around him, adds double dignity to these\nshrouded mountains and darkened abysses, of which the height, depth, and\nextent, are left to imagination.\n\nBut mortals, especially at the well-appetized age which precedes twenty\nyears, are seldom so much engaged either by real or conjectural subjects\nof speculation, but that their earthly wants claim their hour of\nattention. And with many a smile did our hero, so the reader may term\nhim if he will, hail the re-appearance of his friend Adam Woodcock,\nbearing on one platter a tremendous portion of boiled beef, and on\nanother a plentiful allowance of greens, or rather what the Scotch call\nlang-kale. A groom followed with bread, salt, and the other means of\nsetting forth a meal; and when they had both placed on the oaken table\nwhat they bore in their hands, the falconer observed, that since he knew\nthe court, it had got harder and harder every day to the poor gentlemen\nand yeoman retainers, but that now it was an absolute flaying of a flea\nfor the hide and tallow. Such thronging to the wicket, and such\nchurlish answers, and such bare beef-bones, such a shouldering at\nthe buttery-hatch and cellarage, and nought to be gained beyond small\ninsufficient single ale, or at best with a single straike of malt to\ncounterbalance a double allowance of water--\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy the mass, though, my\nyoung friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, while he saw the food disappearing fast under\nRoland's active exertions, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is not so to well to lament for former\ntimes as to take the advantage of the present, else we are like to lose\non both sides.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, Adam Woodcock drew his chair towards the table, unsheathed\nhis knife, (for every one carried that minister of festive distribution\nfor himself,) and imitated his young companion's example, who for the\nmoment had lost his anxiety for the future in the eager satisfaction of\nan appetite sharpened by youth and abstinence.\n\nIn truth, they made, though the materials were sufficiently simple, a\nvery respectable meal, at the expense of the royal allowance; and Adam\nWoodcock, notwithstanding the deliberate censure which he had passed on\nthe household beer of the palace, had taken the fourth deep draught\nof the black jack ere he remembered him that he had spoken in its\ndispraise. Flinging himself jollily and luxuriously back in an old\ndanske elbow-chair, and looking with careless glee towards the page,\nextending at the same time his right leg, and stretching the other\neasily over it, he reminded his companion that he had not yet heard\nthe ballad which he had made for the Abbot of Unreason's revel. And\naccordingly he struck merrily up with\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Pope, that pagan full of pride,\n   Has blinded us full lang.\u00e2\u0080\u009d------\n\nRoland Graeme, who felt no great delight, as may be supposed, in the\nfalconer's satire, considering its subject, began to snatch up his\nmantle, and fling it around his shoulders, an action which instantly\ninterrupted the ditty of Adam Woodcock.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere the vengeance are you going now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthou restless\nboy?--Thou hast quicksilver in the veins of thee to a certainty, and\ncanst no more abide any douce and sensible communing, than a hoodless\nhawk would keep perched on my wrist!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, Adam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you must needs know, I am about to\ntake a walk and look at this fair city. One may as well be still mewed\nup in the old castle of the lake, if one is to sit the live-long night\nbetween four walls, and hearken to old ballads.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a new ballad--the Lord help thee!\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Adam, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand that one of\nthe best that ever was matched with a rousing chorus.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe it so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will hear it another day, when the rain\nis dashing against the windows, and there is neither steed stamping, nor\nspur jingling, nor feather waving in the neighbourhood to mar my marking\nit well. But, even now, I want to be in the world, and to look about\nme.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the never a stride shall you go without me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the falconer,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cuntil the Regent shall take you whole and sound off my hand; and so, if\nyou will, we may go to the hostelrie of Saint Michael's, and there you\nwill see company enough, but through the casement, mark you me; for as\nto rambling through the street to seek Seytons and Leslies, and having\na dozen holes drilled in your new jacket with rapier and poniard, I will\nyield no way to it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo the hostelrie of Saint Michael's, then, with all my heart,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\npage; and they left the palace accordingly, rendered to the sentinels\nat the gate, who had now taken their posts for the evening, a strict\naccount of their names and business, were dismissed through a small\nwicket of the close-barred portal, and soon reached the inn or hostelrie\nof Saint Michael, which stood in a large court-yard, off the main\nstreet, close under the descent of the Calton-hill. The place, wide,\nwaste, and uncomfortable, resembled rather an Eastern caravansary, where\nmen found shelter indeed, but were obliged to supply themselves with\nevery thing else, than one of our modern inns;\n\n  Where not one comfort shall to those be lost,\n  Who never ask, or never feel, the cost.\n\nBut still, to the inexperienced eye of Roland Graeme, the bustle and\nconfusion of this place of public resort, furnished excitement and\namusement. In the large room, into which they had rather found their own\nway than been ushered by mine host, travellers and natives of the city\nentered and departed, met and greeted, gamed or drank together, forming\nthe strongest contrast to the stern and monotonous order and silence\nwith which matters were conducted in the well-ordered household of the\nKnight of Avenel. Altercation of every kind, from brawling to jesting,\nwas going on amongst the groups around them, and yet the noise and\nmingled voices seemed to disturb no one and indeed to be noticed by\nno others than by those who composed the group to which the speaker\nbelonged.\n\nThe falconer passed through the apartment to a projecting latticed\nwindow, which formed a sort of recess from the room itself; and\nhaving here ensconced himself and his companion, he called for some\nrefreshments; and a tapster, after he had shouted for the twentieth\ntime, accommodated him with the remains of a cold capon and a neat's\ntongue, together with a pewter stoup of weak French vin-de-pays. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFetch\na stoup of brandy-wine, thou knave--We will be jolly to-night, Master\nRoland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, when he saw himself thus accommodated, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand let care\ncome to-morrow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Roland had eaten too lately to enjoy the good cheer; and feeling his\ncuriosity much sharper than his appetite, he made it his choice to\nlook out of the lattice, which overhung a large yard, surrounded by the\nstables of the hostelrie, and fed his eyes on the busy sight beneath,\nwhile Adam Woodcock, after he had compared his companion to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cLaird\nof Macfarlane's geese, who liked their play better than their meat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n disposed of his time with the aid of cup and trencher, occasionally\nhumming the burden of his birth-strangled ballad, and beating time to\nit with his fingers on the little round table. In this exercise he was\nfrequently interrupted by the exclamations of his companion, as he saw\nsomething new in the yard beneath, to attract and interest him.\n\nIt was a busy scene, for the number of gentlemen and nobles who were now\ncrowded into the city, had filled all spare stables and places of public\nreception with their horses and military attendants. There were some\nscore of yeomen, dressing their own or their masters' horses in the\nyard, whistling, singing, laughing, and upbraiding each other, in a\nstyle of wit which the good order of Avenel Castle rendered strange\nto Roland Graeme's ears. Others were busy repairing their own arms, or\ncleaning those of their masters. One fellow, having just bought a bundle\nof twenty spears, was sitting in a corner, employed in painting the\nwhite staves of the weapons with yellow and vermillion. Other lacqueys\nled large stag-hounds, or wolf-dogs, of noble race, carefully muzzled to\nprevent accidents to passengers. All came and went, mixed together and\nseparated, under the delighted eye of the page, whose imagination had\nnot even conceived a scene so gaily diversified with the objects he\nhad most pleasure in beholding; so that he was perpetually breaking the\nquiet reverie of honest Woodcock, and the mental progress which he was\nmaking in his ditty, by exclaiming, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook here, Adam--look at the bonny\nbay horse--Saint Anthony, what, a gallant forehand he hath got!--and see\nthe goodly gray, which yonder fellow in the frieze-jacket is dressing\nas awkwardly as if he had never touched aught but a cow--I would I were\nnigh him to teach him his trade!--And lo you, Adam, the gay Milan armour\nthat the yeoman is scouring, all steel and silver, like our Knight's\nprime suit, of which old Wingate makes such account--And see to yonder\npretty wench, Adam, who comes tripping through them all with her\nmilk-pail--I warrant me she has had a long walk from the loaning; she\nhas a stammel waistcoat, like your favourite Cicely Sunderland, Master\nAdam!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy my hood, lad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the falconer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is well for thee thou wert\nbrought up where grace grew. Even in the Castle of Avenel thou wert\na wild-blood enough, but hadst thou been nurtured here, within a\nflight-shot of the Court, thou hadst been the veriest crack-hemp of a\npage that ever wore feather in thy bonnet or steel by thy side: truly, I\nwish it may end well with thee.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, but leave thy senseless humming and drumming, old Adam, and come\nto the window ere thou hast drenched thy senses in the pint-pot there.\nSee here comes a merry minstrel with his crowd, and a wench with him,\nthat dances with bells at her ankles; and see, the yeomen and pages\nleave their horses and the armour they were cleaning, and gather round,\nas is very natural, to hear the music. Come, old Adam, we will thither\ntoo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou shall call me cutt if I do go down,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Adam; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are near as\ngood minstrelsy as the stroller can make, if you had but the grace to\nlisten to it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the wench in the stammel waistcoat is stopping too, Adam--by\nheaven, they are going to dance! Frieze-jacket wants to dance with\nstammel waistcoat, but she is coy and recusant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen suddenly changing his tone of levity into one of deep interest and\nsurprise, he exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cQueen of Heaven! what is it that I see!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and\nthen remained silent.\n\nThe sage Adam Woodcock, who was in a sort of languid degree amused with\nthe page's exclamations, even while he professed to despise them, became\nat length rather desirous to set his tongue once more a-going, that he\nmight enjoy the superiority afforded by his own intimate familiarity\nwith all the circumstances which excited in his young companion's mind\nso much wonderment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said at last, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat is it you do see, Master Roland,\nthat you have become mute all of a sudden?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland returned no answer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI say, Master Roland Graeme,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the falconer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is manners in my\ncountry for a man to speak when he is spoken to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland Graeme remained silent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe murrain is in the boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Adam Woodcock, \u00e2\u0080\u009che has stared out his\neyes, and talked his tongue to pieces, I think.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe falconer hastily drank off his can of wine, and came to Roland,\nwho stood like a statue, with his eyes eagerly bent on the court-yard,\nthough Adam Woodcock was unable to detect amongst the joyous scenes\nwhich it exhibited aught that could deserve such devoted attention.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe lad is mazed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the falconer to himself.\n\nBut Roland Graeme had good reasons for his surprise, though they were\nnot such as he could communicate to his companion.\n\nThe touch of the old minstrel's instrument, for he had already begun to\nplay, had drawn in several auditors from the street when one entered the\ngate of the yard, whose appearance exclusively arrested the attention of\nRoland Graeme. He was of his own age, or a good deal younger, and from\nhis dress and bearing might be of the same rank and calling, having all\nthe air of coxcombry and pretension, which accorded with a handsome,\nthough slight and low figure, and an elegant dress, in part hid by\na large purple cloak. As he entered, he cast a glance up towards the\nwindows, and, to his extreme astonishment, under the purple velvet\nbonnet and white feather, Roland recognized the features so deeply\nimpressed on his memory, the bright and clustered tresses, the laughing\nfull blue eyes, the well-formed eyebrows, the nose, with the slightest\npossible inclination to be aquiline, the ruby lip, of which an arch and\nhalf-suppressed smile seemed the habitual expression--in short, the form\nand face of Catherine Seyton; in man's attire, however, and mimicking,\nas it seemed, not unsuccessfully, the bearing of a youthful but forward\npage.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSaint George and Saint Andrew!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the amazed Roland Graeme to\nhimself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas there ever such an audacious quean!--she seems a little\nashamed of her mummery too, for she holds the lap of her cloak to her\nface, and her colour is heightened--but Santa Maria, how she threads the\nthrong, with as firm and bold a step as if she had never tied petticoat\nround her waist!--Holy Saints! she holds up her riding-rod as if she\nwould lay it about some of their ears, that stand most in her way--by\nthe hand of my father! she bears herself like the very model of\npagehood.--Hey! what! sure she will not strike frieze-jacket in\nearnest?\u00e2\u0080\u009d But he was not long left in doubt; for the lout whom he had\nbefore repeatedly noticed, standing in the way of the bustling page, and\nmaintaining his place with clownish obstinacy or stupidity, the advanced\nriding-rod was, without a moment's hesitation, sharply applied to his\nshoulders, in a manner which made him spring aside, rubbing the part of\nthe body which had received so unceremonious a hint that it was in the\nway of his betters. The party injured growled forth an oath or two of\nindignation, and Roland Graeme began to think of flying down stairs to\nthe assistance of the translated Catherine; but the laugh of the yard\nwas against frieze-jacket, which indeed had, in those days, small\nchance of fair play in a quarrel with velvet and embroidery; so that\nthe fellow, who was menial in the inn, slunk back to finish his task of\ndressing the bonny gray, laughed at by all, but most by the wench in the\nstammel waistcoat, his fellow-servant, who, to crown his disgrace, had\nthe cruelty to cast an applauding smile upon the author of the injury,\nwhile, with a freedom more like the milk-maid of the town than she of\nthe plains, she accosted him with--\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs there any one you want here, my\npretty gentleman, that you seem in such haste?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI seek a sprig of a lad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the seeming gallant, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwith a sprig of\nholly in his cap, black hair, and black eyes, green jacket, and the air\nof a country coxcomb--I have sought him through every close and alley in\nthe Canongate, the fiend gore him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, God-a-mercy, Nun!\u00e2\u0080\u009d muttered Roland Graeme, much bewildered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will inquire him presently out for your fair young worship,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nwench of the inn.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the gallant squire, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand if you bring me to him, you shall\nhave a groat to-night, and a kiss on Sunday when you have on a cleaner\nkirtle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, God-a-mercy, Nun!\u00e2\u0080\u009d again muttered Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is a note above E\nLa.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn a moment after, the servant entered the room, and ushered in the\nobject of his surprise.\n\nWhile the disguised vestal looked with unabashed brow, and bold and\nrapid glance of her eye, through the various parties in the large old\nroom, Roland Graeme, who felt an internal awkward sense of bashful\nconfusion, which he deemed altogether unworthy of the bold and dashing\ncharacter to which he aspired, determined not to be browbeaten and\nput down by this singular female, but to meet her with a glance of\nrecognition so sly, so penetrating, so expressively humorous, as should\nshow her at once he was in possession of her secret and master of her\nfate, and should compel her to humble herself towards him, at least into\nthe look and manner of respectful and deprecating observance.\n\nThis was extremely well planned; but just as Roland had called up the\nknowing glance, the suppressed smile, the shrewd intelligent look, which\nwas to ensure his triumph, he encountered the bold, firm, and steady\ngaze of his brother or sister-page, who, casting on him a falcon glance,\nand recognizing him at once as the object of his search, walked up with\nthe most unconcerned look, the most free and undaunted composure, and\nhailed him with \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou, Sir Holly-top, I would speak with you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe steady coolness and assurance with which these words were uttered,\nalthough the voice was the very voice he had heard at the old convent,\nand although the features more nearly resembled those of Catharine when\nseen close than when viewed from a distance, produced, nevertheless,\nsuch a confusion in Roland's mind, that he became uncertain whether he\nwas not still under a mistake from the beginning; the knowing shrewdness\nwhich should have animated his visage faded into a sheepish bashfulness,\nand the half-suppressed but most intelligible smile, became the\nsenseless giggle of one who laughs to cover his own disorder of ideas.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo they understand a Scotch tongue in thy country, Holly-top?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nthis marvellous specimen of metamorphosis. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI said I would speak with\nthee.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is your business with my comrade, my young chick of the game?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said Adam Woodcock, willing to step in to his companion's assistance,\nthough totally at a loss to account for the sudden disappearance of all\nRoland's usual smartness and presence of mind.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing to you, my old cock of the perch,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the gallant; \u00e2\u0080\u009cgo\nmind your hawk's castings. I guess by your bag and your gauntlet that\nyou are squire of the body to a sort of kites.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe laughed as he spoke, and the laugh reminded Roland so irresistibly\nof the hearty fit of risibility, in which Catherine had indulged at his\nexpense when they first met in the old nunnery, that he could scarce\nhelp exclaiming, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCatherine Seyton, by Heavens!\u00e2\u0080\u009d--He checked the\nexclamation, however, and only said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think, sir, we two are not\ntotally strangers to each other.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe must have met in our dreams then\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the youth; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand my days are\ntoo busy to remember what I think on at nights.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOr apparently to remember upon one day those whom you may have seen on\nthe preceding eve\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme.\n\nThe youth in his turn cast on him a look of some surprise, as he\nreplied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know no more of what you mean than does the horse I ride\non--if there be offence in your words, you shall find me ready to take\nit as any lad in Lothian.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthough it pleases you to use the language\nof a stranger, that with you I have no purpose to quarrel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me do mine errand, then, and be rid of you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page. \u00e2\u0080\u009cStep\nhither this way, out of that old leathern fist's hearing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey walked into the recess of the window, which Roland had left upon\nthe youth's entrance into the apartment. The messenger then turned his\nback on the company, after casting a hasty and sharp glance around to\nsee if they were observed. Roland did the same, and the page in the\npurple mantle thus addressed him, taking at the same time from under his\ncloak a short but beautifully wrought sword, with the hilt and ornaments\nupon the sheath of silver, massively chased and over-gilded--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI bring\nyou this weapon from a friend, who gives it you under the solemn\ncondition, that you will not unsheath it until you are commanded by\nyour rightful Sovereign. For your warmth of temper is known, and the\npresumption with which you intrude yourself into the quarrels of others;\nand, therefore, this is laid upon you as a penance by those who wish you\nwell, and whose hand will influence your destiny for good or for evil.\nThis is what I was charged to tell you. So if you will give a fair word\nfor a fair sword, and pledge your promise, with hand and glove, good and\nwell; and if not, I will carry back Caliburn to those who sent it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd may I not ask who these are?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme, admiring at the\nsame time the beauty of the weapon thus offered him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy commission in no way leads me to answer such a question,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he of\nthe purple mantle.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut if I am offended\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmay I not draw to defend myself?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot _this_ weapon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the sword-bearer; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut you have your own\nat command, and, besides, for what do you wear your poniard?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor no good,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Adam Woodcock, who had now approached close to them,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cand that I can witness as well as any one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStand back, fellow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the messenger, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthou hast an intrusive\ncurious face, that will come by a buffet if it is found where it has no\nconcern.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA buffet, my young Master Malapert?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Adam, drawing back, however;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cbest keep down fist, or, by Our Lady, buffet will beget buffet!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe patient, Adam Woodcock,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand let me pray\nyou, fair sir, since by such addition you choose for the present to\nbe addressed, may I not barely unsheathe this fair weapon, in pure\nsimplicity of desire to know whether so fair a hilt and scabbard are\nmatched with a befitting blade?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy no manner of means,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the messenger; \u00e2\u0080\u009cat a word, you must\ntake it under the promise that you never draw it until you receive the\ncommands of your lawful Sovereign, or you must leave it alone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnder that condition, and coming from your friendly hand, I accept of\nthe sword,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, taking it from his hand; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut credit me, if we\nare to work together in any weighty emprise, as I am induced to believe,\nsome confidence and openness on your part will be necessary to give the\nright impulse to my zeal--I press for no more at present, it is enough\nthat you understand me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI understand you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, exhibiting the appearance of\nunfeigned surprise in his turn,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cRenounce me if I do!--here you stand\njiggeting, and sniggling, and looking cunning, as if there were some\nmighty matter of intrigue and common understanding betwixt you and me,\nwhom you never set your eyes on before!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill you deny that we have met before?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMarry that I will, in any Christian court,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the other page.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd will you also deny,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat it was recommended to us\nto study each other's features well, that in whatever disguise the time\nmight impose upon us, each should recognize in the other the secret\nagent of a mighty work? Do not you remember, that Sister Magdalen and\nDame Bridget----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe messenger here interrupted him, shrugging up his shoulders, with\na look of compassion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBridget and Magdalen! why, this is madness\nand dreaming! Hark ye, Master Holly-top, your wits are gone on\nwool-gathering; comfort yourself with a caudle, and thatch your\nbrain-sick noddle with a woollen night-cap, and so God be with you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs he concluded this polite parting address, Adam Woodcock, who was\nagain seated by the table on which stood the now empty can, said to him,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you drink a cup, young man, in the way of courtesy, now you have\ndone your errand, and listen to a good song?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and without waiting for an\nanswer, he commenced his ditty,--\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Pope, that pagan full of pride,\n  Hath blinded us full lang--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt is probable that the good wine had made some innovation in the\nfalconer's brain, otherwise he would have recollected the danger of\nintroducing any thing like political or polemical pleasantry into a\npublic assemblage at a time when men's minds were in a state of great\nirritability. To do him justice, he perceived his error, and stopped\nshort so soon as he saw that the word Pope had at once interrupted the\nseparate conversations of the various parties which were assembled in\nthe apartment; and that many began to draw themselves up, bridle, look\nbig, and prepare to take part in the impending brawl; while others,\nmore decent and cautious persons, hastily paid down their lawing, and\nprepared to leave the place ere bad should come to worse.\n\nAnd to worse it was soon likely to come; for no sooner did Woodcock's\nditty reach the ear of the stranger page, than, uplifting his\nriding-rod, he exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe who speaks irreverently of the Holy Father\nof the church in my presence, is the cub of a heretic wolf-bitch, and I\nwill switch him as I would a mongrel-cur.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I will break thy young pate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Adam, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif thou darest to lift a\nfinger to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And then, in defiance of the young Drawcansir's threats,\nwith a stout heart and dauntless accent, he again uplifted the stave.\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Pope, that pagan full of pride.\n  Hath blinded--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Adam was able to proceed no farther, being himself unfortunately\nblinded by a stroke of the impatient youth's switch across his eyes.\nEnraged at once by the smart and the indignity, the falconer started\nup, and darkling as he was, for his eyes watered too fast to permit\nhis seeing any thing, he would soon have been at close grips with his\ninsolent adversary, had not Roland Graeme, contrary to his nature,\nplayed for once the prudent man and the peacemaker, and thrown himself\nbetwixt them, imploring Woodcock's patience. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwith whom you have to do.--And thou,\u00e2\u0080\u009d addressing the messenger, who\nstood scornfully laughing at Adam's rage, \u00e2\u0080\u009cget thee gone, whoever\nthou art; if thou be'st what I guess thee, thou well knowest there are\nearnest reasons why thou shouldst.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThou hast hit it right for once, Holly-top,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the gallant, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthough\nI guess you drew your bow at a venture.--Here, host, let this yeoman\nhave a bottle of wine to wash the smart out of his eyes--and there is\na French crown for him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he threw the piece of money on the\ntable, and left the apartment, with a quick yet steady pace, looking\nfirmly at right and left, as if to defy interruption: and snapping his\nfingers at two or three respectable burghers, who, declaring it was a\nshame that any one should be suffered to rant and ruffle in defence of\nthe Pope, were labouring to find the hilts of their swords, which had\ngot for the present unhappily entangled in the folds of their cloaks.\nBut, as the adversary was gone ere any of them had reached his weapon,\nthey did not think it necessary to unsheath cold iron, but merely\nobserved to each other, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is more than masterful violence, to see\na poor man stricken in the face just for singing a ballad against the\nwhore of Babylon! If the Pope's champions are to be bangsters in our\nvery change-houses, we shall soon have the old shavelings back again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe provost should look to it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said another, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand have some five or\nsix armed with partisans, to come in upon the first whistle, to teach\nthese gallants their lesson. For, look you, neighbour Lugleather, it\nis not for decent householders like ourselves to be brawling with the\ngodless grooms and pert pages of the nobles, that are bred up to little\nelse save bloodshed and blasphemy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor all that, neighbour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lugleather, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would have curried that\nyoungster as properly as ever I curried a lamb's hide, had not the hilt\nof my bilbo been for the instant beyond my grasp; and before I could\nturn my girdle, gone was my master!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the others, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe devil go with him, and peace abide with\nus--I give my rede, neighbours, that we pay the lawing, and be stepping\nhomeward, like brother and brother; for old Saint Giles's is tolling\ncurfew, and the street grows dangerous at night.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith that the good burghers adjusted their cloaks, and prepared for\ntheir departure, while he that seemed the briskest of the three, laying\nhis hand on his Andrea Ferrara, observed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat they that spoke in the\npraise of the Pope on the High-gate of Edinburgh, had best bring the\nsword of Saint Peter to defend them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhile the ill-humour excited by the insolence of the young aristocrat\nwas thus evaporating in empty menace, Roland Graeme had to control the\nfar more serious indignation of Adam Woodcock. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, man, it was but a\nswitch across the mazzard--blow your nose, dry your eyes, and you will\nsee all the better for it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy this light, which I cannot see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Adam Woodcock, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthou hast been\na false friend to me, young man--neither taking up my rightful quarrel,\nnor letting me fight it out myself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFy for shame, Adam Woodcock,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the youth, determined to turn\nthe tables on him, and become in turn the counsellor of good order and\npeaceable demeanour--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI say, fy for shame!--Alas, that you will speak\nthus! Here are you sent with me, to prevent my innocent youth getting\ninto snares----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish your innocent youth were cut short with a halter, with all my\nheart,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Adam, who began to see which way the admonition tended.\n--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd instead of setting before me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009can example of\npatience and sobriety becoming the falconer of Sir Halbert Glendinning,\nyou quaff me off I know not how many flagons of ale, besides a gallon of\nwine, and a full measure of strong waters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was but one small pottle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said poor Adam, whom consciousness of his\nown indiscretion now reduced to a merely defensive warfare.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was enough to pottle you handsomely, however,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd\nthen, instead of going to bed to sleep off your liquor, must you sit\nsinging your roistering songs about popes and pagans, till you have got\nyour eyes almost switched out of your head; and but for my interference,\nwhom your drunken ingratitude accuses of deserting you, yon galliard\nwould have cut your throat, for he was whipping out a whinger as broad\nas my hand, and as sharp as a razor--And these are lessons for an\ninexperienced youth!--Oh, Adam! out upon you! out upon you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMarry, amen, and with all my heart,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Adam; \u00e2\u0080\u009cout upon my folly for\nexpecting any thing but impertinent raillery from a page like thee, that\nif he saw his father in a scrape, would laugh at him, instead of lending\nhim aid.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, but I will lend you aid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, still laughing, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat is,\nI will lend thee aid to thy chamber, good Adam, where thou shalt sleep\noff wine and ale, ire and indignation, and awake the next morning with\nas much fair wit as nature has blessed thee withal. Only one thing\nI will warn thee, good Adam, that henceforth and for ever, when thou\nrailest at me for being somewhat hot at hand, and rather too prompt to\nout with poniard or so, thy admonition shall serve as a prologue to the\nmemorable adventure of the switching of Saint Michael's.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith such condoling expressions he got the crest-fallen falconer to his\nbed, and then retired to his own pallet, where it was some time ere\nhe could fall asleep. If the messenger whom he had seen were really\nCatherine Seyton, what a masculine virago and termagant must she be! and\nstored with what an inimitable command of insolence and assurance!--The\nbrass on her brow would furbish the front of twenty pages; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I should\nknow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thought Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat that amounts to--And yet, her features, her\nlook, her light gait, her laughing eye, the art with which she disposed\nthe mantle to show no more of her limbs than needs must be seen--I am\nglad she had at least that grace left--the voice, the smile--it must\nhave been Catherine Seyton, or the devil in her likeness! One thing\nis good, I have silenced the eternal predications of that ass, Adam\nWoodcock, who has set up for being a preacher and a governor, over me,\nso soon as he has left the hawks' mew behind him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd with this comfortable reflection, joined to the happy indifference\nwhich youth hath for the events of the morrow, Roland Graeme fell fast\nasleep.\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Twentieth.\n\n\n  Now have you reft me from my staff, my guide,\n  Who taught my youth, as men teach untamed falcons,\n  To use my strength discreetly--I am reft\n  Of comrade and of counsel.\n                                        OLD PLAY.\n\nIn the gray of the next morning's dawn, there was a loud knocking at the\ngate of the hostelrie; and those without, proclaiming that they came\nin the name of the Regent, were instantly admitted. A moment or\ntwo afterwards, Michael Wing-the-wind stood by the bedside of our\ntravellers.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUp! up!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is no slumber where Murray hath work ado.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBoth sleepers sprung up, and began to dress themselves.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou, old friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Wing-the-wind to Adam Woodcock, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmust to horse\ninstantly, with this packet to the Monks of Kennaquhair; and with this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n delivering them as he spoke, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto the Knight of Avenel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs much as commanding the monks to annul their election, I'll warrant\nme, of an Abbot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d quoth Adam Woodcock, as he put the packets into his\nbag, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand charging my master to see it done--To hawk at one brother with\nanother, is less than fair play, methinks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFash not thy beard about it, old boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Michael, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut betake thee\nto the saddle presently; for if these orders are not obeyed, there will\nbe bare walls at the Kirk of Saint Mary's, and it may be at the Castle\nof Avenel to boot; for I heard my Lord of Morton loud with the Regent,\nand we are at a pass that we cannot stand with him anent trifles.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Adam, \u00e2\u0080\u009ctouching the Abbot of Unreason--what say they to\nthat outbreak--An they be shrewishly disposed, I were better pitch the\npackets to Satan, and take the other side of the Border for my bield.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, that was passed over as a jest, since there was little harm\ndone.--But, hark thee, Adam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued his comrade, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif there was a\ndozen vacant abbacies in your road, whether of jest or earnest, reason\nor unreason, draw thou never one of their mitres over thy brows.--The\ntime is not fitting, man!--besides, our Maiden longs to clip the neck of\na fat churchman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe shall never sheer mine in that capacity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the falconer, while\nhe knotted the kerchief in two or three double folds around his sunburnt\nbull-neck, calling out at the same time, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster Roland, Master Roland,\nmake haste! we must back to perch and mew, and, thank Heaven, more than\nour own wit, with our bones whole, and without a stab in the stomach.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, but,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Wing-the-wind, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe page goes not back with you; the\nRegent has other employment for him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSaints and sorrows!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the falconer--\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster Roland Graeme to\nremain here, and I to return to Avenel!--Why, it cannot be--the child\ncannot manage himself in this wide world without me, and I question\nif he will stoop to any other whistle than mine own; there are times I\nmyself can hardly bring him to my lure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was at Roland's tongue's end to say something concerning the occasion\nthey had for using mutually each other's prudence, but the real anxiety\nwhich Adam evinced at parting with him, took away his disposition\nto such ungracious raillery. The falconer did not altogether escape,\nhowever, for, in turning his face towards the lattice, his friend\nMichael caught a glimpse of it, and exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI prithee, Adam\nWoodcock, what hast thou been doing with these eyes of thine? They are\nswelled to the starting from the socket!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNought in the world,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, after casting a deprecating glance\nat Roland Graeme, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut the effect of sleeping in this d--ned truckle\nwithout a pillow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, Adam Woodcock, thou must be grown strangely dainty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his old\ncompanion; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have known thee sleep all night with no better pillow than\na bush of ling, and start up with the sun, as glegg as a falcon; and now\nthine eyes resemble----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTush, man, what signifies how mine eyes look now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Adam--\u00e2\u0080\u009clet\nus but roast a crab-apple, pour a pottle of ale on it, and bathe our\nthroats withal, thou shalt see a change in me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd thou wilt be in heart to sing thy jolly ballad about the Pope,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said his comrade.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, that I will,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the falconer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat is, when we have left\nthis quiet town five miles behind us, if you will take your hobby and\nride so far on my way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, that I may not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Michael--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can but stop to partake your\nmorning draught, and see you fairly to horse--I will see that they\nsaddle them, and toast the crab for thee, without loss of time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDuring his absence the falconer took the page by the hand--\u00e2\u0080\u009cMay I never\nhood hawk again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the good-natured fellow, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif I am not as sorry to\npart with you as if you were a child of mine own, craving pardon for the\nfreedom--I cannot tell what makes me love you so much, unless it be for\nthe reason that I loved the vicious devil of a brown galloway nag whom\nmy master the Knight called Satan, till Master Warden changed his name\nto Seyton; for he said it was over boldness to call a beast after the\nKing of Darkness----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit was over boldness in him, I trow, to call a\nvicious brute after a noble family.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d proceeded Adam, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSeyton or Satan, I loved that nag over every\nother horse in the stable---There was no sleeping on his back--he was\nfor ever fidgeting, bolting, rearing, biting, kicking, and giving you\nwork to do, and maybe the measure of your back on the heather to the\nboot of it all. And I think I love you better than any lad in the\ncastle, for the self-same qualities.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks, thanks, kind Adam. I regard myself bound to you for the good\nestimation in which you hold me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, interrupt me not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the falconer--\u00e2\u0080\u009cSatan was a good nag--But\nI say I think I shall call the two eyases after you, the one Roland,\nand the other Graeme; and while Adam Woodcock lives, be sure you have a\nfriend--Here is to thee, my dear son.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland most heartily returned the grasp of the hand, and Woodcock,\nhaving taken a deep draught, continued his farewell speech.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are three things I warn you against, Roland, now that you art to\ntread this weary world without my experience to assist you. In the first\nplace, never draw dagger on slight occasion--every man's doublet is not\nso well stuffed as a certain abbot's that you wot of. Secondly, fly not\nat every pretty girl, like a merlin at a thrush--you will not always win\na gold chain for your labour--and, by the way, here I return to you your\nfanfarona--keep it close, it is weighty, and may benefit you at a pinch\nmore ways than one. Thirdly, and to conclude, as our worthy preacher\nsays, beware of the pottle-pot--it has drenched the judgment of wiser\nmen than you. I could bring some instances of it, but I dare say it\nneedeth not; for if you should forget your own mishaps, you will scarce\nfail to remember mine--And so farewell, my dear son.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland returned his good wishes, and failed not to send his humble duty\nto his kind Lady, charging the falconer, at the same time, to express\nhis regret that he should have offended her, and his determination so\nto bear him in the world that she would not be ashamed of the generous\nprotection she had afforded him.\n\nThe falconer embraced his young friend, mounted his stout, round-made,\ntrotting-nag, which the serving-man, who had attended him, held ready at\nthe door, and took the road to the southward. A sullen and heavy\nsound echoed from the horse's feet, as if indicating the sorrow of the\ngood-natured rider. Every hoof-tread seemed to tap upon Roland's heart\nas he heard his comrade withdraw with so little of his usual alert\nactivity, and felt that he was once more alone in the world.\n\nHe was roused from his reverie by Michael Wing-the-wind, who reminded\nhim that it was necessary they should instantly return to the palace,\nas my Lord Regent went to the Sessions early in the morning. They went\nthither accordingly, and Wing-the-wind, a favourite old domestic, who\nwas admitted nearer to the Regent's person and privacy, than many whose\nposts were more ostensible, soon introduced Graeme into a small matted\nchamber, where he had an audience of the present head of the troubled\nState of Scotland. The Earl of Murray was clad in a sad-coloured\nmorning-gown, with a cap and slippers of the same cloth, but, even in\nthis easy deshabill\u00c3\u00a9, held his sheathed rapier in his hand, a precaution\nwhich he adopted when receiving strangers, rather in compliance with\nthe earnest remonstrances of his friends and partisans, than from any\npersonal apprehensions of his own. He answered with a silent nod the\nrespectful obeisance of the page, and took one or two turns through\nthe small apartment in silence, fixing his keen eye on Roland, as if he\nwished to penetrate into his very soul. At length he broke silence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour name is, I think, Julian Graeme?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRoland Graeme, my lord, not Julian,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the page.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRight--I was misled by some trick of my memory--Roland Graeme, from\nthe Debateable Land.--Roland, thou knowest the duties which belong to a\nlady's service?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should know them, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009chaving been bred so\nnear the person of my Lady of Avenel; but I trust never more to practise\nthem, as the Knight hath promised----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe silent, young man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Regent, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am to speak, and you to hear\nand obey. It is necessary that, for some space at least, you shall\nagain enter into the service of a lady, who, in rank, hath no equal in\nScotland; and this service accomplished, I give thee my word as Knight\nand Prince, that it shall open to you a course of ambition, such as may\nwell gratify the aspiring wishes of one whom circumstances entitle\nto entertain much higher views than thou. I will take thee into my\nhousehold and near to my person, or, at your own choice, I will give you\nthe command of a foot-company--either is a preferment which the proudest\nlaird in the land might be glad to ensure for a second son.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMay I presume to ask, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, observing the Earl paused\nfor a reply, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto whom my poor services are in the first place destined?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will be told hereafter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Regent; and then, as if\novercoming some internal reluctance to speak farther himself, he added,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cor why should I not myself tell you, that you are about to enter into\nthe service of a most illustrious--most unhappy lady--into the service\nof Mary of Scotland.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf the Queen, my lord!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, unable to suppress his surprise.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf her who was the Queen!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Murray, with a singular mixture of\ndispleasure and embarrassment in his tone of voice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must be aware,\nyoung man, that her son reigns in her stead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe sighed from an emotion, partly natural, perhaps, and partly assumed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd am I to attend upon her Grace in her place of imprisonment,\nmy lord?\u00e2\u0080\u009d again demanded the page, with a straightforward and hardy\nsimplicity, which somewhat disconcerted the sage and powerful statesman.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is not imprisoned,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Murray, angrily; \u00e2\u0080\u009cGod forbid she\nshould--she is only sequestered from state affairs, and from the\nbusiness of the public, until the world be so effectually settled, that\nshe may enjoy her natural and uncontrolled freedom, without her royal\ndisposition being exposed to the practices of wicked and designing men.\nIt is for this purpose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat while she is to be furnished,\nas right is, with such attendance as may befit her present secluded\nstate, it becomes necessary that those placed around her, are persons on\nwhose prudence I can have reliance. You see, therefore, you are at once\ncalled on to discharge an office most honourable in itself, and so to\ndischarge it that you may make a friend of the Regent of Scotland. Thou\nart, I have been told, a singularly apprehensive youth; and I perceive\nby thy look, that thou dost already understand what I would say on this\nmatter. In this schedule your particular points of duty are set down\nat length--but the sum required of you is fidelity--I mean fidelity\nto myself and to the state. You are, therefore, to watch every attempt\nwhich is made, or inclination displayed, to open any communication with\nany of the lords who have become banders in the west--with Hamilton,\nSeyton, with Fleming, or the like. It is true that my gracious sister,\nreflecting upon the ill chances that have happened to the state of this\npoor kingdom, from evil counsellors who have abused her royal nature in\ntime past, hath determined to sequestrate herself from state affairs in\nfuture. But it is our duty, as acting for and in the name of our infant\nnephew, to guard against the evils which may arise from any mutation or\nvacillation in her royal resolutions. Wherefore, it will be thy duty to\nwatch, and report to our lady mother, whose guest our sister is for the\npresent, whatever may infer a disposition to withdraw her person from\nthe place of security in which she is lodged, or to open communication\nwith those without. If, however, your observation should detect any\nthing of weight, and which may exceed mere suspicion, fail not to send\nnotice by an especial messenger to me directly, and this ring shall be\nthy warrant to order horse and men on such service.--And now begone.\nIf there be half the wit in thy head that there is apprehension in\nthy look, thou fully comprehendest all that I would say--Serve me\nfaithfully, and sure as I am belted earl, thy reward shall be great.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland Graeme made an obeisance, and was about to depart.\n\nThe Earl signed to him to remain. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have trusted thee deeply,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cyoung man, for thou art the only one of her suite who has been sent\nto her by my own recommendation. Her gentlewomen are of her own\nnomination--it were too hard to have barred her that privilege, though\nsome there were who reckoned it inconsistent with sure policy. Thou\nart young and handsome. Mingle in their follies, and see they cover not\ndeeper designs under the appearance of female levity--if they do mine,\ndo thou countermine. For the rest, bear all decorum and respect to the\nperson of thy mistress--she is a princess, though a most unhappy one,\nand hath been a queen! though now, alas! no longer such! Pay, therefore,\nto her all honour and respect, consistent with thy fidelity to the King\nand me--and now, farewell.--Yet stay--you travel with Lord Lindesay, a\nman of the old world, rough and honest, though untaught; see that thou\noffend him not, for he is not patient of raillery, and thou, I have\nheard, art a crack-halter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This he said with a smile, then added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\ncould have wished the Lord Lindesay's mission had been intrusted to some\nother and more gentle noble.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd wherefore should you wish that, my lord?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Morton, who even\nthen entered the apartment; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe council have decided for the best--we\nhave had but too many proofs of this lady's stubbornness of mind, and\nthe oak that resists the sharp steel axe, must be riven with the rugged\niron wedge.--And this is to be her page?--My Lord Regent hath doubtless\ninstructed you, young man, how you shall guide yourself in these\nmatters; I will add but a little hint on my part. You are going to the\ncastle of a Douglas, where treachery never thrives--the first moment of\nsuspicion will be the last of your life. My kinsman, William Douglas,\nunderstands no raillery, and if he once have cause to think you false,\nyou will waver in the wind from the castle battlements ere the sun set\nupon his anger.--And is the lady to have an almoner withal?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOccasionally, Douglas,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Regent; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit were hard to deny the\nspiritual consolation which she thinks essential to her salvation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are ever too soft hearted, my lord--What! a false priest to\ncommunicate her lamentations, not only to our unfriends in Scotland, but\nto the Guises, to Rome, to Spain, and I know not where!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFear not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Regent, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe will take such order that no treachery\nshall happen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook to it then.\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Morton; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou know my mind respecting the wench\nyou have consented she shall receive as a waiting-woman--one of a\nfamily, which, of all others, has ever been devoted to her, and inimical\nto us. Had we not been wary, she would have been purveyed of a page as\nmuch to her purpose as her waiting-damsel. I hear a rumour that an old\nmad Romish pilgrimer, who passes for at least half a saint among them,\nwas employed to find a fit subject.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have escaped that danger at least,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Murray, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand converted it\ninto a point of advantage, by sending this boy of Glendinning's--and for\nher waiting-damsel, you cannot grudge her one poor maiden instead of her\nfour noble Marys and all their silken train?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI care not so much for the waiting-maiden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Morton, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I cannot\nbrook the almoner--I think priests of all persuasions are much like\neach other--Here is John Knox, who made such a noble puller-down, is\nambitious of becoming a setter-up, and a founder of schools and colleges\nout of the Abbey lands, and bishops' rents, and other spoils of Rome,\nwhich the nobility of Scotland have won with their sword and bow, and\nwith which he would endow new hives to sing the old drone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJohn is a man of God,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Regent, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand his scheme is a devout\nimagination.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe sedate smile with which this was spoken, left it impossible to\nconjecture whether the words were meant in approbation, or in derision,\nof the plan of the Scottish Reformer. Turning then to Roland Graeme, as\nif he thought he had been long enough a witness of this conversation,\nhe bade him get him presently to horse, since my Lord of Lindesay was\nalready mounted. The page made his reverence, and left the apartment.\n\nGuided by Michael Wing-the-wind, he found his horse ready saddled and\nprepared for the journey, in front of the palace porch, where hovered\nabout a score of men-at-arms, whose leader showed no small symptoms of\nsurly impatience.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs this the jackanape page for whom we have waited thus long?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nhe to Wing-the-wind.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd my Lord Ruthven will reach the castle long\nbefore us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMichael assented, and added, that the boy had been detained by the\nRegent to receive some parting instructions. The leader made an\ninarticulate sound in his throat, expressive of sullen acquiescence, and\ncalling to one of his domestic attendants, \u00e2\u0080\u009cEdward,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009ctake the\ngallant into your charge, and let him speak with no one else.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe then addressed, by the title of Sir Robert, an elderly and\nrespectable-looking gentleman, the only one of the party who seemed\nabove the rank of a retainer or domestic, and observed, that they must\nget to horse with all speed.\n\nDuring this discourse, and while they were riding slowly along the\nstreet of the suburb, Roland had time to examine more accurately the\nlooks and figure of the Baron, who was at their head.\n\nLord Lindesay of the Byres was rather touched than stricken with years.\nHis upright stature and strong limbs, still showed him fully equal to\nall the exertions and fatigues of war. His thick eyebrows, now partially\ngrizzled, lowered over large eyes full of dark fire, which seemed yet\ndarker from the uncommon depth at which they were set in his head. His\nfeatures, naturally strong and harsh, had their sternness exaggerated\nby one or two scars received in battle. These features, naturally\ncalculated to express the harsher passions, were shaded by an open steel\ncap, with a projecting front, but having no visor, over the gorget\nof which fell the black and grizzled beard of the grim old Baron, and\ntotally hid the lower part of his face. The rest of his dress was a\nloose buff-coat, which had once been lined with silk and adorned with\nembroidery, but which seemed much stained with travel, and damaged with\ncuts, received probably in battle. It covered a corslet, which had once\nbeen of polished steel, fairly gilded, but was now somewhat injured with\nrust. A sword of antique make and uncommon size, framed to be wielded\nwith both hands, a kind of weapon which was then beginning to go out\nof use, hung from his neck in a baldrick, and was so disposed as\nto traverse his whole person, the huge hilt appearing over his left\nshoulder, and the point reaching well-nigh to the right heel, and\njarring against his spur as he walked. This unwieldy weapon could only\nbe unsheathed by pulling the handle over the left shoulder--for no human\narm was long enough to draw it in the usual manner. The whole\nequipment was that of a rude warrior, negligent of his exterior even to\nmisanthropical sullenness; and the short, harsh, haughty tone, which he\nused towards his attendants, belonged to the same unpolished character.\n\nThe personage who rode with Lord Lindesay, at the head of the party, was\nan absolute contrast to him, in manner, form, and features. His thin and\nsilky hair was already white, though he seemed not above forty-five or\nfifty years old. His tone of voice was soft and insinuating--his\nform thin, spare, and bent by an habitual stoop--his pale cheek was\nexpressive of shrewdness and intelligence--his eye was quick though\nplacid, and his whole demeanour mild and conciliatory. He rode an\nambling nag, such as were used by ladies, clergymen, or others of\npeaceful professions--wore a riding habit of black velvet, with a cap\nand feather of the same hue, fastened up by a golden medal--and\nfor show, and as a mark of rank rather than for use, carried a\nwalking-sword, (as the short light rapiers were called,) without any\nother arms, offensive or defensive.\n\nThe party had now quitted the town, and proceeded, at a steady trot,\ntowards the west.--As they prosecuted their journey, Roland Graeme\nwould gladly have learned something of its purpose and tendency, but\nthe countenance of the personage next to whom he had been placed in the\ntrain, discouraged all approach to familiarity. The Baron himself did\nnot look more grim and inaccessible than his feudal retainer, whose\ngrisly beard fell over his mouth like the portcullis before the gate of\na castle, as if for the purpose of preventing the escape of any word, of\nwhich absolute necessity did not demand the utterance. The rest of the\ntrain seemed under the same taciturn influence, and journeyed on without\na word being exchanged amongst them--more like a troop of Carthusian\nfriars than a party of military retainers. Roland Graeme was surprised\nat this extremity of discipline; for even in the household of the Knight\nof Avenel, though somewhat distinguished for the accuracy with which\ndecorum was enforced, a journey was a period of license, during which\njest and song, and every thing within the limits of becoming mirth and\npastime were freely permitted. This unusual silence was, however, so far\nacceptable, that it gave him time to bring any shadow of judgment which\nhe possessed to council on his own situation and prospects, which would\nhave appeared to any reasonable person in the highest degree dangerous\nand perplexing.\n\nIt was quite evident that he had, through various circumstances not\nunder his own control, formed contradictory connexions with both the\ncontending factions, by whose strife the kingdom was distracted, without\nbeing properly an adherent of either. It seemed also clear, that the\nsame situation in the household of the deposed Queen, to which he was\nnow promoted by the influence of the Regent, had been destined to him by\nhis enthusiastic grandmother, Magdalen Graeme; for on this subject, the\nwords which Morton had dropped had been a ray of light; yet it was no\nless clear that these two persons, the one the declared enemy, the other\nthe enthusiastic votary, of the Catholic religion,--the one at the head\nof the King's new government, the other, who regarded that government\nas a criminal usurpation--must have required and expected very different\nservices from the individual whom they had thus united in recommending.\nIt required very little reflection to foresee that these contradictory\nclaims on his services might speedily place him in a situation where his\nhonour as well as his life might be endangered. But it was not in Roland\nGraeme's nature to anticipate evil before it came, or to prepare to\ncombat difficulties before they arrived. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will see this beautiful and\nunfortunate Mary Stewart,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cof whom we have heard so much, and\nthen there will be time enough to determine whether I will be kingsman\nor queensman. None of them can say I have given word or promise to\neither of their factions; for they have led me up and down like a blind\nBilly, without giving me any light into what I was to do. But it was\nlucky that grim Douglas came into the Regent's closet this morning,\notherwise I had never got free of him without plighting my troth to do\nall the Earl would have me, which seemed, after all, but foul play to\nthe poor imprisoned lady, to place her page as an espial on her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSkipping thus lightly over a matter of such consequence, the thoughts of\nthe hare-brained boy went a wool-gathering after more agreeable\ntopics. Now he admired the Gothic towers of Barnbougle, rising from the\nseabeaten rock, and overlooking one of the most glorious landscapes in\nScotland--and now he began to consider what notable sport for the hounds\nand the hawks must be afforded by the variegated ground over which they\ntravelled--and now he compared the steady and dull trot at which they\nwere then prosecuting their journey, with the delight of sweeping\nover hill and dale in pursuit of his favourite sports. As, under the\ninfluence of these joyous recollections, he gave his horse the spur,\nand made him execute a gambade, he instantly incurred the censure of his\ngrave neighbour, who hinted to him to keep the pace, and move quietly\nand in order, unless he wished such notice to be taken of his eccentric\nmovements as was likely to be very displeasing to him.\n\nThe rebuke and the restraint under which the youth now found\nhimself, brought back to his recollection his late good-humoured and\naccommodating associate and guide, Adam Woodcock; and from that topic\nhis imagination made a short flight to Avenel Castle, to the quiet\nand unconfined life of its inhabitants, the goodness of his early\nprotectress, not forgetting the denizens of its stables, kennels, and\nhawk-mews. In a brief space, all these subjects of meditation gave way\nto the resemblance of that riddle of womankind, Catherine Seyton, who\nappeared before the eye of his mind--now in her female form, now in\nher male attire--now in both at once--like some strange dream, which\npresents to us the same individual under two different characters at\nthe same instant. Her mysterious present also recurred to his\nrecollection--the sword which he now wore at his side, and which he was\nnot to draw save by command of his legitimate Sovereign! But the key of\nthis mystery he judged he was likely to find in the issue of his present\njourney.\n\nWith such thoughts passing through his mind, Roland Graeme accompanied\nthe party of Lord Lindesay to the Queen's-Ferry, which they passed in\nvessels that lay in readiness for them. They encountered no adventure\nwhatever in their passage, excepting one horse being lamed in getting\ninto the boat, an accident very common on such occasions, until a\nfew years ago, when the ferry was completely regulated. What was more\npeculiarly characteristic of the olden age, was the discharge of a\nculverin at the party from the battlements of the old castle of Rosythe,\non the north side of the Ferry, the lord of which happened to have some\npublic or private quarrel with the Lord Lindesay, and took this mode\nof expressing his resentment. The insult, however, as it was harmless,\nremained unnoticed and unavenged, nor did any thing else occur worth\nnotice until the band had come where Lochleven spread its magnificent\nsheet of waters to the beams of a bright summer's sun.\n\nThe ancient castle, which occupies an island nearly in the centre of\nthe lake, recalled to the page that of Avenel, in which he had been\nnurtured. But the lake was much larger, and adorned with several islets\nbesides that on which the fortress was situated; and instead of being\nembosomed in hills like that of Avenel, had upon the southern side only\na splendid mountainous screen, being the descent of one of the Lomond\nhills, and on the other was surrounded by the extensive and fertile\nplain of Kinross. Roland Graeme looked with some degree of dismay on the\nwater-girdled fortress, which then, as now, consisted only of one\nlarge donjon-keep, surrounded with a court-yard, with two round\nflanking-towers at the angles, which contained within its circuit some\nother buildings of inferior importance. A few old trees, clustered\ntogether near the castle, gave some relief to the air of desolate\nseclusion; but yet the page, while he gazed upon a building so\nsequestrated, could not but feel for the situation of a captive Princess\ndoomed to dwell there, as well as for his own. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI must have been born,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n he thought, \u00e2\u0080\u009cunder the star that presides over ladies and lakes of\nwater, for I cannot by any means escape from the service of the one, or\nfrom dwelling in the other. But if they allow me not the fair freedom\nof my sport and exercise, they shall find it as hard to confine a\nwild-drake, as a youth who can swim like one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe band had now reached the edge of the water, and one of the party\nadvancing displayed Lord Lindesay's pennon, waving it repeatedly to and\nfro, while that Baron himself blew a clamorous blast on his bugle. A\nbanner was presently displayed from the roof of the castle in reply to\nthese signals, and one or two figures were seen busied as if unmooring a\nboat which lay close to the islet.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will be some time ere they can reach us with the boat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\ncompanion of Lord Lindesay; \u00e2\u0080\u009cshould we not do well to proceed to\nthe town, and array ourselves in some better order, ere we appear\nbefore----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may do as you list, Sir Robert,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Lindesay, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have neither\ntime nor temper to waste on such vanities. She has cost me many a hard\nride, and must not now take offence at the threadbare cloak and soiled\ndoublet that I am arrayed in. It is the livery to which she has brought\nall Scotland.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo not speak so harshly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Robert; \u00e2\u0080\u009cif she hath done wrong,\nshe hath dearly abied it; and in losing all real power, one would not\ndeprive her of the little external homage due at once to a lady and a\nprincess.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI say to you once more, Sir Robert Melville,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Lindesay, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo as\nyou will--for me, I am now too old to dink myself as a gallant to grace\nthe bower of dames.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe bower of dames, my lord!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Melville, looking at the rude old\ntower--\u00e2\u0080\u009cis it yon dark and grated castle, the prison of a captive Queen,\nto which you give so gay a name?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cName it as you list,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Lindesay; \u00e2\u0080\u009chad the Regent desired to send\nan envoy capable to speak to a captive Queen, there are many gallants\nin his court who would have courted the occasion to make speeches out of\nAmadis of Gaul, or the Mirror of Knighthood. But when he sent blunt old\nLindesay, he knew he would speak to a misguided woman, as her former\nmisdoings and her present state render necessary. I sought not this\nemployment--it has been thrust upon me; and I will not cumber myself\nwith more form in the discharge of it, than needs must be tacked to such\nan occupation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, Lord Lindesay threw himself from horseback, and wrapping\nhis riding-cloak around him, lay down at lazy length upon the sward, to\nawait the arrival of the boat, which was now seen rowing from the castle\ntowards the shore. Sir Robert Melville, who had also dismounted, walked\nat short turns to and fro upon the bank, his arms crossed on his breast,\noften looking to the castle, and displaying in his countenance a mixture\nof sorrow and of anxiety. The rest of the party sate like statues on\nhorseback, without moving so much as the points of their lances, which\nthey held upright in the air.\n\nAs soon as the boat approached a rude quay or landing-place, near to\nwhich they had stationed themselves, Lord Lindesay started up from his\nrecumbent posture, and asked the person who steered, why he had not\nbrought a larger boat with him to transport his retinue.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo please you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the boatman, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause it is the order of our\nlady, that we bring not to the castle more than four persons.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThy lady is a wise woman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lindesay, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto suspect me of\ntreachery!--Or, had I intended it, what was to hinder us from throwing\nyou and your comrades into the lake, and filling the boat with my own\nfellows?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe steersman, on hearing this, made a hasty signal to his men to back\ntheir oars, and hold off from the shore which they were approaching.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, thou ass,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lindesay, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthou didst not think that I meant\nthy fool's head serious harm? Hark thee, friend--with fewer than three\nservants I will go no whither--Sir Robert Melville will require at least\nthe attendance of one domestic; and it will be at your peril and your\nlady's to refuse us admission, come hither as we are, on matters of\ngreat national concern.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe steersman answered with firmness, but with great civility of\nexpression, that his orders were positive to bring no more than four\ninto the island, but he offered to row back to obtain a revisal of his\norders.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo so, my friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Robert Melville, after he had in vain\nendeavoured to persuade his stubborn companion to consent to a temporary\nabatement of his train, \u00e2\u0080\u009crow back to the castle, sith it will be no\nbetter, and obtain thy lady's orders to transport the Lord Lindesay,\nmyself, and our retinue hither.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd hearken,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Lindesay, \u00e2\u0080\u009ctake with you this page, who comes\nas an attendant on your lady's guest.--Dismount, sirrah,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he,\naddressing Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand embark with them in that boat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what is to become of my horse?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Graeme; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am answerable for\nhim to my master.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will relieve you of the charge,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lindesay; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthou wilt have\nlittle enough to do with horse, saddle, or bridle, for ten years to\ncome--Thou mayst take the halter an thou wilt--it may stand thee in a\nturn.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I thought so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland--but he was interrupted by Sir Robert\nMelville, who said to him good-humouredly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDispute it not, young\nfriend--resistance can do no good, but may well run thee into danger.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland Graeme felt the justice of what he said, and, though neither\ndelighted with the matter or manner of Lindesay's address, deemed it\nbest to submit to necessity, and to embark without farther remonstrance.\nThe men plied their oars. The quay, with the party of horse stationed\nnear it, receded from the page's eyes--the castle and the islet seemed\nto draw near in the same proportion, and in a brief space he landed\nunder the shadow of a huge old tree which overhung the landing place.\nThe steersman and Graeme leaped ashore; the boatmen remained lying on\ntheir oars ready for further service.\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Twenty-First.\n\n\n  Could valour aught avail or people's love,\n    France had not wept Navarre's brave Henry slain;\n  If wit or beauty could compassion move,\n    The rose of Scotland had not wept in vain.\n           _Elegy in a Royal Mausoleum._ LEWIS.\n\nAt the gate of the court-yard of Lochleven appeared the stately form of\nthe Lady Lochleven, a female whose early charms had captivated James V.,\nby whom she became mother of the celebrated Regent Murray. As she was of\nnoble birth (being a daughter of the house of Mar) and of great beauty,\nher intimacy with James did not prevent her being afterwards sought in\nhonourable marriage by many gallants of the time, among whom she had\npreferred Sir William Douglas of Lochleven. But well has it been said\n\n  ----\u00e2\u0080\u009cOur pleasant vices\n  Are made the whips to scourge us\u00e2\u0080\u009d---\n\nThe station which the Lady of Lochleven now held as the wife of a man\nof high rank and interest, and the mother of a lawful family, did not\nprevent her nourishing a painful sense of degradation, even while she\nwas proud of the talents, the power, and the station of her son, now\nprime ruler of the state, but still a pledge of her illicit intercourse.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHad James done to her,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, in her secret heart, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe justice he\nowed her, she had seen in her son, as a source of unmixed delight and of\nunchastened pride, the lawful monarch of Scotland, and one of the\nablest who ever swayed the sceptre.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The House of Mar, not inferior in\nantiquity or grandeur to that of Drummond, would then have also boasted\na Queen among its daughters, and escaped the stain attached to female\nfrailty, even when it has a royal lover for its apology. While such\nfeelings preyed on a bosom naturally proud and severe, they had a\ncorresponding effect on her countenance, where, with the remains of\ngreat beauty, were mingled traits of inward discontent and peevish\nmelancholy. It perhaps contributed to increase this habitual\ntemperament, that the Lady Lochleven had adopted uncommonly rigid and\nsevere views of religion, imitating in her ideas of reformed faith\nthe very worst errors of the Catholics, in limiting the benefit of the\ngospel to those who profess their own speculative tenets.\n\nIn every respect, the unfortunate Queen Mary, now the compulsory guest,\nor rather prisoner, of this sullen lady, was obnoxious to her hostess.\nLady Lochleven disliked her as the daughter of Mary of Guise, the legal\npossessor of those rights over James's heart and hand, of which she\nconceived herself to have been injuriously deprived; and yet more so as\nthe professor of a religion which she detested worse than Paganism.\n\nSuch was the dame, who, with stately mien, and sharp yet handsome\nfeatures, shrouded by her black velvet coif, interrogated the domestic\nwho steered her barge to the shore, what had become of Lindesay and\nSir Robert Melville. The man related what had passed, and she smiled\nscornfully as she replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFools must be flattered, not foughten\nwith.--Row back--make thy excuse as thou canst--say Lord Ruthven\nhath already reached this castle, and that he is impatient for Lord\nLindesay's presence. Away with thee, Randal--yet stay--what galopin is\nthat thou hast brought hither?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo please you, my lady, he is the page who is to wait upon----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, the new male minion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady Lochleven; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe female\nattendant arrived yesterday. I shall have a well-ordered house with this\nlady and her retinue; but I trust they will soon find some others to\nundertake such a charge. Begone, Randal--and you\u00e2\u0080\u009d (to Roland Graeme)\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cfollow me to the garden.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe led the way with a slow and stately step to the small garden, which,\nenclosed by a stone wall ornamented with statues, and an artificial\nfountain in the centre, extended its dull parterres on the side of\nthe court-yard, with which it communicated by a low and arched portal.\nWithin the narrow circuit of its formal and limited walks, Mary Stewart\nwas now learning to perform the weary part of a prisoner, which, with\nlittle interval, she was doomed to sustain during the remainder of her\nlife. She was followed in her slow and melancholy exercise by two female\nattendants; but in the first glance which Roland Graeme bestowed\nupon one so illustrious by birth, so distinguished by her beauty,\naccomplishments, and misfortunes, he was sensible of the presence of no\nother than the unhappy Queen of Scotland.\n\nHer face, her form, have been so deeply impressed upon the imagination,\nthat even at the distance of nearly three centuries, it is unnecessary\nto remind the most ignorant and uninformed reader of the striking traits\nwhich characterize that remarkable countenance, which seems at once\nto combine our ideas of the majestic, the pleasing, and the brilliant,\nleaving us to doubt whether they express most happily the queen, the\nbeauty, or the accomplished woman. Who is there, that, at the very\nmention of Mary Stewart's name, has not her countenance before him,\nfamiliar as that of the mistress of his youth, or the favourite daughter\nof his advanced age? Even those who feel themselves compelled to believe\nall, or much, of what her enemies laid to her charge, cannot think\nwithout a sigh upon a countenance expressive of anything rather than\nthe foul crimes with which she was charged when living, and which still\ncontinue to shade, if not to blacken, her memory. That brow, so truly\nopen and regal--those eyebrows, so regularly graceful, which yet were\nsaved from the charge of regular insipidity by the beautiful effect of\nthe hazel eyes which they overarched, and which seem to utter a thousand\nhistories--the nose, with all its Grecian precision of outline--the\nmouth, so well proportioned, so sweetly formed, as if designed to speak\nnothing but what was delightful to hear--the dimpled chin--the stately\nswan-like neck, form a countenance, the like of which we know not to\nhave existed in any other character moving in that class of life,\nwhere the actresses as well as the actors command general and undivided\nattention. It is in vain to say that the portraits which exist of this\nremarkable woman are not like each other; for, amidst their discrepancy,\neach possesses general features which the eye at once acknowledges as\npeculiar to the vision which our imagination has raised while we read\nher history for the first time, and which has been impressed upon it by\nthe numerous prints and pictures which we have seen. Indeed we cannot\nlook on the worst of them, however deficient in point of execution,\nwithout saying that it is meant for Queen Mary; and no small instance\nit is of the power of beauty, that her charms should have remained the\nsubject not merely of admiration, but of warm and chivalrous interest,\nafter the lapse of such a length of time. We know that by far the most\nacute of those who, in latter days, have adopted the unfavourable view\nof Mary's character, longed, like the executioner before his dreadful\ntask was performed, to kiss the fair hand of her on whom he was about to\nperform so horrible a duty.\n\nDressed, then, in a deep mourning robe, and with all those charms of\nface, shape, and manner, with which faithful tradition has made each\nreader familiar, Mary Stewart advanced to meet the Lady of Lochleven,\nwho, on her part, endeavoured to conceal dislike and apprehension under\nthe appearance of respectful indifference. The truth was, that she\nhad experienced repeatedly the Queen's superiority in that species of\ndisguised yet cutting sarcasm, with which women can successfully avenge\nthemselves, for real and substantial injuries. It may be well doubted,\nwhether this talent was not as fatal to its possessor as the many others\nenjoyed by that highly gifted, but most unhappy female; for, while it\noften afforded her a momentary triumph over her keepers, it failed not\nto exasperate their resentment; and the satire and sarcasm in which she\nhad indulged were frequently retaliated by the deep and bitter hardships\nwhich they had the power of inflicting. It is well known that her death\nwas at length hastened by a letter which she wrote to Queen Elizabeth,\nin which she treated her jealous rival, and the Countess of Shrewsbury,\nwith the keenest irony and ridicule.\n\nAs the ladies met together, the Queen said, bending her head at the same\ntime, in return to the obeisance of the Lady Lochleven, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are this\nday fortunate--we enjoy the company of our amiable hostess at an unusual\nhour, and during a period which we have hitherto been permitted to give\nto our private exercise. But our good hostess knows well she has at all\ntimes access to our presence, and need not observe the useless ceremony\nof requiring our permission.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sorry my presence is deemed an intrusion by your Grace,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nLady of Lochleven. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI came but to announce the arrival of an addition\nto your train,\u00e2\u0080\u009d motioning with her hand towards Roland Graeme; \u00e2\u0080\u009ca\ncircumstance to which ladies are seldom indifferent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! I crave your ladyship's pardon; and am bent to the earth with\nobligations for the kindness of my nobles--or my sovereigns, shall I\ncall them?--who have permitted me such a respectable addition to my\npersonal retinue.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey have indeed studied, Madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady of Lochleven, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto show\ntheir kindness towards your Grace--something at the risk perhaps of\nsound policy, and I trust their doings will not be misconstrued.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cImpossible!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe bounty which permits the daughter of\nso many kings, and who yet is Queen of the realm, the attendance of\ntwo waiting-women and a boy, is a grace which Mary Stewart can never\nsufficiently acknowledge. Why! my train will be equal to that of any\ncountry dame in this your kingdom of Fife, saving but the lack of a\ngentleman-usher, and a pair or two of blue-coated serving-men. But I\nmust not forget, in my selfish joy, the additional trouble and charges\nto which this magnificent augmentation of our train will put our kind\nhostess, and the whole house of Lochleven. It is this prudent anxiety, I\nam aware, which clouds your brows, my worthy lady. But be of good cheer;\nthe crown of Scotland has many a fair manor, and your affectionate son,\nand my no less affectionate brother, will endow the good knight your\nhusband with the best of them, ere Mary should be dismissed from this\nhospitable castle from your ladyship's lack of means to support the\ncharges.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Douglasses of Lochleven, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009chave known\nfor ages how to discharge their duty to the State, without looking for\nreward, even when the task was both irksome and dangerous.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay! but, my dear Lochleven,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are over\nscrupulous--I pray you accept of a goodly manor; what should support\nthe Queen of Scotland in this her princely court, saving her own\ncrown-lands--and who should minister to the wants of a mother, save an\naffectionate son like the Earl of Murray, who possesses so wonderfully\nboth the power and inclination?--Or said you it was the danger of the\ntask which clouded your smooth and hospitable brow?--No doubt, a page is\na formidable addition to my body-guard of females; and I bethink me it\nmust have been for that reason that my Lord of Lindesay refused even\nnow to venture within the reach of a force so formidable, without being\nattended by a competent retinue.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Lady Lochleven started, and looked something surprised; and Mary\nsuddenly changing her manner from the smooth ironical affectation of\nmildness to an accent of austere command, and drawing up at the same\ntime her fine person, said, with the full majesty of her rank, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes!\nLady of Lochleven; I know that Ruthven is already in the castle, and\nthat Lindesay waits on the bank the return of your barge to bring him\nhither along with Sir Robert Melville. For what purpose do these nobles\ncome--and why am I not in ordinary decency apprised of their arrival?\u00e2\u0080\u009d'\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTheir purpose, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Lady of Lochleven, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey must\nthemselves explain--but a formal annunciation were needless, where your\nGrace hath attendants who can play the espial so well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas! poor Fleming,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, turning to the elder of the female\nattendants, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthou wilt be tried, condemned, and gibbeted, for a spy in\nthe garrison, because thou didst chance to cross the great hall while my\ngood Lady of Lochleven was parleying at the full pitch of her voice with\nher pilot Randal. Put black wool in thy ears, girl, as you value the\nwearing of them longer. Remember, in the Castle of Lochleven, ears and\ntongues are matters not of use, but for show merely. Our good hostess\ncan hear, as well as speak, for us all. We excuse your farther\nattendance, my lady hostess,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, once more addressing the object\nof her resentment, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand retire to prepare for an interview with our\nrebel lords. We will use the ante-chamber of our sleeping apartment as\nour hall of audience. You, young man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she proceeded, addressing Roland\nGraeme, and at once softening the ironical sharpness of her manner into\ngood-humoured raillery, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou, who are all our male attendance, from our\nLord High Chamberlain down to our least galopin, follow us to prepare\nour court.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe turned, and walked slowly towards the castle. The Lady of Lochleven\nfolded her arms, and smiled in bitter resentment, as she watched her\nretiring steps.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe whole male attendance!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she muttered, repeating the Queen's last\nwords, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand well for thee had it been had thy train never been larger;\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n then turning to Roland, in whose way she had stood while making this\npause, she made room for him to pass, saying at the same time, \u00e2\u0080\u009cArt thou\nalready eaves-dropping? follow thy mistress, minion, and, if thou wilt,\ntell her what I have now said.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland Graeme hastened after his royal mistress and her attendants, who\nhad just entered a postern-gate communicating betwixt the castle and the\nsmall garden. They ascended a winding-stair as high as the second story,\nwhich was in a great measure occupied by a suite of three rooms, opening\ninto each other, and assigned as the dwelling of the captive Princess.\nThe outermost was a small hall or ante-room, within which opened a\nlarge parlour, and from that again the Queen's bedroom. Another small\napartment, which opened into the same parlour, contained the beds of the\ngentlewomen in waiting.\n\nRoland Graeme stopped, as became his station, in the outermost of these\napartments, there to await such orders as might be communicated to him.\nFrom the grated window of the room he saw Lindesay, Melville, and their\nfollowers disembark; and observed that they were met at the castle gate\nby a third noble, to whom Lindesay exclaimed, in his loud harsh voice,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy Lord of Ruthven, you have the start of us!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this instant, the page's attention was called to a burst of\nhysterical sobs from the inner apartment, and to the hurried\nejaculations of the terrified females, which led him almost instantly to\nhasten to their assistance. When he entered, he saw that the Queen had\nthrown herself into the large chair which stood nearest the door, and\nwas sobbing for breath in a strong fit of hysterical affection. The\nelder female supported her in her arms, while the younger bathed her\nface with water and with tears alternately.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHasten, young man!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the elder lady, in alarm, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfly--call in\nassistance--she is swooning!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut the Queen ejaculated in a faint and broken voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cStir not, I\ncharge you!--call no one to witness--I am better--I shall recover\ninstantly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And, indeed, with an effort which seemed like that of one\nstruggling for life, she sate up in her chair, and endeavoured to resume\nher composure, while her features yet trembled with the violent emotion\nof body and mind which she had undergone. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am ashamed of my weakness,\ngirls,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, taking the hands of her attendants; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut it is\nover--and I am Mary Stewart once more. The savage tone of that man's\nvoice--my knowledge of his insolence--the name which he named--the\npurpose for which they come--may excuse a moment's weakness, and it\nshall be a moment's only.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She snatched from her head the curch or cap,\nwhich had been disordered during her hysterical agony, shook down the\nthick clustered tresses of dark brown which had been before veiled under\nit--and, drawing her slender fingers across the labyrinth which they\nformed, she arose from the chair, and stood like the inspired image of a\nGrecian prophetess in a mood which partook at once of sorrow and pride,\nof smiles and of tears. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are ill appointed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto meet\nour rebel subjects; but, as far as we may, we will strive to present\nourselves as becomes their Queen. Follow me, my maidens,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat says thy favourite song, my Fleming?\n\n  'My maids, come to my dressing-bower,\n  And deck my nut-brown hair;\n  Where'er ye laid a plait before,\n  Look ye lay ten times 'mair.'\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added, when she had repeated with a smile these lines of an\nold ballad, \u00e2\u0080\u009cviolence has already robbed me of the ordinary decorations\nof my rank; and the few that nature gave me have been destroyed by\nsorrow and by fear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yet while she spoke thus, she again let her slender\nfingers stray through the wilderness of the beautiful tresses which\nveiled her kingly neck and swelling bosom, as if, in her agony of mind,\nshe had not altogether lost the consciousness of her unrivalled charms.\nRoland Graeme, on whose youth, inexperience, and ardent sense of what\nwas dignified and lovely, the demeanour of so fair and high-born a lady\nwrought like the charm of a magician, stood rooted to the spot with\nsurprise and interest, longing to hazard his life in a quarrel so\nfair as that which Mary Stewart's must needs be. She had been bred in\nFrance--she was possessed of the most distinguished beauty--she had\nreigned a Queen and a Scottish Queen, to whom knowledge of character was\nas essential as the use of vital air. In all these capacities, Mary\nwas, of all women on the earth, most alert at perceiving and using the\nadvantages which her charms gave her over almost all who came within the\nsphere of their influence. She cast on Roland a glance which might have\nmelted a heart of stone. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy poor boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, with a feeling partly\nreal, partly politic, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthou art a stranger to us--sent to this doleful\ncaptivity from the society of some tender mother, or sister, or maiden,\nwith whom you had freedom to tread a gay measure round the Maypole. I\ngrieve for you; but you are the only male in my limited household--wilt\nthou obey my orders?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo the death, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Graeme, in a determined tone.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen keep the door of mine apartment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen; \u00e2\u0080\u009ckeep it till\nthey offer actual violence, or till we shall be fitly arrayed to receive\nthese intrusive visiters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will defend it till they pass over my body,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme; any\nhesitation which he had felt concerning the line of conduct he ought to\npursue being completely swept away by the impulse of the moment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot so, my good youth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Mary; \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot so, I command. If I have\none faithful subject beside me, much need, God wot, I have to care for\nhis safety. Resist them but till they are put to the shame of using\nactual violence, and then give way, I charge you. Remember my commands.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n And, with a smile expressive at once of favour and of authority, she\nturned from him, and, followed by her attendants, entered the bedroom.\n\nThe youngest paused for half a second ere she followed her companion,\nand made a signal to Roland Graeme with her hand. He had been already\nlong aware that this was Catherine Seyton--a circumstance which could\nnot much surprise a youth of quick intellects, who recollected the sort\nof mysterious discourse which had passed betwixt the two matrons at the\ndeserted nunnery, and on which his meeting with Catherine in this place\nseemed to cast so much light. Yet such was the engrossing effect of\nMary's presence, that it surmounted for the moment even the feelings of\na youthful lover; and it was not until Catherine Seyton had disappeared,\nthat Roland began to consider in what relation they were to stand to\neach other. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe held up her hand to me in a commanding manner,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nthought; \u00e2\u0080\u009cperhaps she wanted to confirm my purpose for the execution of\nthe Queen's commands; for I think she could scarce purpose to scare me\nwith the sort of discipline which she administered to the groom in the\nfrieze-jacket, and to poor Adam Woodcock. But we will see to that anon;\nmeantime, let us do justice to the trust reposed in us by this unhappy\nQueen. I think my Lord of Murray will himself own that it is the duty of\na faithful page to defend his lady against intrusion on her privacy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAccordingly, he stepped to the little vestibule, made fast, with lock\nand bar, the door which opened from thence to the large staircase, and\nthen sat himself down to attend the result. He had not long to wait--a\nrude and strong hand first essayed to lift the latch, then pushed and\nshook the door with violence, and, when it resisted his attempt to open\nit, exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cUndo the door there, you within!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, and at whose command,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cam I to undo the door of\nthe apartments of the Queen of Scotland?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnother vain attempt, which made hinge and bolt jingle, showed that\nthe impatient applicant without would willingly have entered altogether\nregardless of his challenge; but at length an answer was returned.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUndo the door, on your peril--the Lord Lindesay comes to speak with the\nLady Mary of Scotland.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Lord Lindesay, as a Scottish noble,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmust await\nhis Sovereign's leisure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAn earnest altercation ensued amongst those without, in which Roland\ndistinguished the remarkable harsh voice of Lindesay in reply to\nSir Robert Melville, who appeared to have been using some soothing\nlanguage--\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo! no! no! I tell thee, no! I will place a petard against\nthe door rather than be baulked by a profligate woman, and bearded by an\ninsolent footboy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYet, at least,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Melville, \u00e2\u0080\u009clet me try fair means in the first\ninstance. Violence to a lady would stain your scutcheon for ever. Or\nawait till my Lord Ruthven comes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will await no longer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lindesay; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is high time the business\nwere done, and we on our return to the council. But thou mayest try thy\nfair play, as thou callest it, while I cause my train to prepare the\npetard. I came hither provided with as good gunpowder as blew up the\nKirk of Field.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor God's sake, be patient,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Melville; and, approaching the door,\nhe said, as speaking to those within, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet the Queen know, that I, her\nfaithful servant, Robert Melville, do entreat her, for her own sake, and\nto prevent worse consequences, that she will undo the door, and admit\nLord Lindesay, who brings a mission from the Council of State.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will do your errand to the Queen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand report to you\nher answer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe went to the door of the bedchamber, and tapping against it gently, it\nwas opened by the elderly lady, to whom he communicated his errand, and\nreturned with directions from the Queen to admit Sir Robert Melville and\nLord Lindesay. Roland Graeme returned to the vestibule, and opened the\ndoor accordingly, into which the Lord Lindesay strode, with the air of\na soldier who has fought his way into a conquered fortress; while\nMelville, deeply dejected, followed him more slowly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI draw you to witness, and to record,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page to this last,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat, save for the especial commands of the Queen, I would have made\ngood the entrance, with my best strength, and my best blood, against all\nScotland.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe silent, young man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Melville, in a tone of grave rebuke; \u00e2\u0080\u009cadd\nnot brands to fire--this is no time to make a flourish of thy boyish\nchivalry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe has not appeared even yet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lindesay, who had now reached the\nmidst of the parlour or audience-room; \u00e2\u0080\u009chow call you this trifling?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPatience, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Sir Robert, \u00e2\u0080\u009ctime presses not--and Lord\nRuthven hath not as yet descended.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this moment the door of the inner apartment opened, and Queen Mary\npresented herself, advancing with an air of peculiar grace and majesty,\nand seeming totally unruffled, either by the visit, or by the rude\nmanner in which it had been enforced. Her dress was a robe of black\nvelvet; a small ruff, open in front, gave a full view of her beautifully\nformed chin and neck, but veiled the bosom. On her head she wore a small\ncap of lace, and a transparent white veil hung from her shoulders over\nthe long black robe, in large loose folds, so that it could be drawn at\npleasure over the face and person. She wore a cross of gold around her\nneck, and had her rosary of gold and ebony hanging from her girdle. She\nwas closely followed by her two ladies, who remained standing behind her\nduring the conference. Even Lord Lindesay, though the rudest noble\nof that rude age, was surprised into something like respect by the\nunconcerned and majestic mien of her, whom he had expected to find\nfrantic with impotent passion, or dissolved in useless and vain sorrow,\nor overwhelmed with the fears likely in such a situation to assail\nfallen royalty.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe fear we have detained you, my Lord of Lindesay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen,\nwhile she curtsied with dignity in answer to his reluctant obeisance;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cbut a female does not willingly receive her visiters without some\nminutes spent at the toilette. Men, my lord, are less dependant on such\nceremonies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLord Lindesay, casting his eye down on his own travel-stained and\ndisordered dress, muttered something of a hasty journey, and the Queen\npaid her greeting to Sir Robert Melville with courtesy, and even, as\nit seemed, with kindness. There was then a dead pause, during which\nLindesay looked towards the door, as if expecting with impatience the\ncolleague of their embassy. The Queen alone was entirely unembarrassed,\nand, as if to break the silence, she addressed Lord Lindesay, with\na glance at the large and cumbrous sword which he wore, as already\nmentioned, hanging from his neck.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have there a trusty and a weighty travelling companion, my lord.\nI trust you expected to meet with no enemy here, against whom such\na formidable weapon could be necessary? it is, methinks, somewhat a\nsingular ornament for a court, though I am, as I well need to be, too\nmuch of a Stuart to fear a sword.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not the first time, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Lindesay, bringing round the\nweapon so as to rest its point on the ground, and leaning one hand on\nthe huge cross-handle, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is not the first time that this weapon has\nintruded itself into the presence of the House of Stewart.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPossibly, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit may have done service to my\nancestors--Your ancestors were men of loyalty\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cservice it hath done; but such as kings love\nneither to acknowledge nor to reward. It was the service which the knife\nrenders to the tree when trimming it to the quick, and depriving it of\nthe superfluous growth of rank and unfruitful suckers, which rob it of\nnourishment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou talk riddles, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mary; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will hope the explanation\ncarries nothing insulting with it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou shall judge, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lindesay. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith this good sword was\nArchibald Douglas, Earl of Angus, girded on the memorable day when he\nacquired the name of Bell-the-Cat, for dragging from the presence of\nyour great grandfather, the third James of the race, a crew of minions,\nflatterers, and favourites whom he hanged over the bridge of Lauder,\nas a warning to such reptiles how they approach a Scottish throne. With\nthis same weapon, the same inflexible champion of Scottish honour\nand nobility slew at one blow Spens of Kilspindie, a courtier of your\ngrandfather, James the fourth, who had dared to speak lightly of him\nin the royal presence. They fought near the brook of Fala; and\nBell-the-Cat, with this blade, sheared through the thigh of his\nopponent, and lopped the limb as easily as a shepherd's boy slices a\ntwig from a sapling.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Queen, reddening, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy nerves are too good to\nbe alarmed even by this terrible history--May I ask how a blade\nso illustrious passed from the House of Douglas to that of\nLindesay?--Methinks it should have been preserved as a consecrated\nrelic, by a family who have held all that they could do against their\nking, to be done in favour of their country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Melville, anxiously interfering, \u00e2\u0080\u009cask not\nthat question of Lord Lindesay--And you, my lord, for shame--for\ndecency--forbear to reply to it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is time that this lady should hear the truth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Lindesay.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd be assured,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat she will be moved to anger by\nnone that you can tell her, my lord. There are cases in which just scorn\nhas always the mastery over just anger.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lindesay, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat upon the field of Carberry-hill, when\nthat false and infamous traitor and murderer, James, sometime Earl of\nBothwell, and nicknamed Duke of Orkney, offered to do personal battle\nwith any of the associated nobles who came to drag him to justice, I\naccepted his challenge, and was by the noble Earl of Morton gifted\nwith his good sword that I might therewith fight it out--Ah! so help me\nHeaven, had his presumption been one grain more, or his cowardice one\ngrain less, I should have done such work with this good steel on his\ntraitorous corpse, that the hounds and carrion-crows should have found\ntheir morsels daintily carved to their use !\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Queen's courage well-nigh gave way at the mention of Bothwell's\nname--a name connected with such a train of guilt, shame, and disaster.\nBut the prolonged boast of Lindesay gave her time to rally herself, and\nto answer with an appearance of cold contempt--\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is easy to slay\nan enemy who enters not the lists. But had Mary Stewart inherited her\nfather's sword as well as his sceptre, the boldest of her rebels should\nnot upon that day have complained that they had no one to cope withal.\nYour lordship will forgive me if I abridge this conference. A brief\ndescription of a bloody fight is long enough to satisfy a lady's\ncuriosity; and unless my Lord of Lindesay has something more important\nto tell us than of the deeds which old Bell-the-Cat achieved, and how he\nwould himself have emulated them, had time and tide permitted, we will\nretire to our private apartment, and you, Fleming, shall finish reading\nto us yonder little treatise _Des Rodomontades Espagnolles_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTarry, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lindesay, his complexion reddening in his turn, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nknow your quick wit too well of old to have sought an interview that\nyou might sharpen its edge at the expense of my honour. Lord Ruthven and\nmyself, with Sir Robert Melville as a concurrent, come to your Grace on\nthe part of the Secret Council, to tender to you what much concerns the\nsafety of your own life and the welfare of the State.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Secret Council?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cby what powers can it subsist or\nact, while I, from whom it holds its character, am here detained under\nunjust restraint? But it matters not--what concerns the welfare of\nScotland shall be acceptable to Mary Stewart, come from whatever quarter\nit will--and for what concerns her own life, she has lived long enough\nto be weary of it, even at the age of twenty-five.--Where is your\ncolleague, my lord?--why tarries he?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe comes, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Melville, and Lord Ruthven entered at the\ninstant, holding in his hand a packet. As the Queen returned his\nsalutation she became deadly pale, but instantly recovered herself\nby dint of strong and sudden resolution, just as the noble, whose\nappearance seemed to excite such emotions in her bosom, entered the\napartment in company with George Douglas, the youngest son of the Knight\nof Lochleven, who, during the absence of his father and brethren,\nacted as Seneschal of the Castle, under the direction of the elder Lady\nLochleven, his father's mother.\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Twenty-Second.\n\n\n  I give this heavy weight from off my head,\n  And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand;\n  With mine own tears I wash away my balm,\n  With mine own hand I give away my crown,\n  With mine own tongue deny my sacred state,\n  With mine own breath release all duteous oaths.\n                                   RICHARD II.\n\nLord Ruthven had the look and bearing which became a soldier and a\nstatesman, and the martial cast of his form and features procured him\nthe popular epithet of Greysteil, by which he was distinguished by his\nintimates, after the hero of a metrical romance then generally known.\nHis dress, which was a buff-coat embroidered, had a half-military\ncharacter, but exhibited nothing of the sordid negligence which\ndistinguished that of Lindesay. But the son of an ill-fated sire, and\nthe father of a yet more unfortunate family, bore in his look that cast\nof inauspicious melancholy, by which the physiognomists of that time\npretended to distinguish those who were predestined to a violent and\nunhappy death.\n\nThe terror which the presence of this nobleman impressed on the Queen's\nmind, arose from the active share he had borne in the slaughter of\nDavid Rizzio; his father having presided at the perpetration of that\nabominable crime, although so weak from long and wasting illness, that\nhe could not endure the weight of his armour, having arisen from a\nsick-bed to commit a murder in the presence of his Sovereign. On that\noccasion his son also had attended and taken an active part. It was\nlittle to be wondered at, that the Queen, considering her condition\nwhen such a deed of horror was acted in her presence, should retain an\ninstinctive terror for the principal actors in the murder. She returned,\nhowever, with grace the salutation of Lord Ruthven, and extended her\nhand to George Douglas, who kneeled, and kissed it with respect; the\nfirst mark of a subject's homage which Roland Graeme had seen any of\nthem render to the captive Sovereign. She returned his greeting in\nsilence, and there was a brief pause, during which the steward of the\ncastle, a man of a sad brow and a severe eye, placed, under George\nDouglas's directions, a table and writing materials; and the page,\nobedient to his mistress's dumb signal, advanced a large chair to the\nside on which the Queen stood, the table thus forming a sort of bar\nwhich divided the Queen and her personal followers from her unwelcome\nvisitors. The steward then withdrew after a low reverence. When he had\nclosed the door behind him, the Queen broke silence--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith your favour,\nmy lords, I will sit--my walks are not indeed extensive enough at\npresent to fatigue me greatly, yet I find repose something more\nnecessary than usual.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe sat down accordingly, and, shading her cheek with her beautiful\nhand, looked keenly and impressively at each of the nobles in turn.\nMary Fleming applied her kerchief to her eyes, and Catherine Seyton and\nRoland Graeme exchanged a glance, which showed that both were too deeply\nengrossed with sentiments of interest and commiseration for their royal\nmistress, to think of any thing which regarded themselves.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wait the purpose of your mission, my lords,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, after\nshe had been seated for about a minute without a word-being spoken,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nwait your message from those you call the Secret Council.-I trust it\nis a petition of pardon, and a desire that I will resume my rightful\nthrone, without using with due severity my right of punishing those who\nhave dispossessed me of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Ruthven, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is painful for us to speak harsh truths to\na Princess who has long ruled us. But we come to offer, not to implore,\npardon. In a word, madam, we have to propose to you on the part of the\nSecret Council, that you sign these deeds, which will contribute greatly\nto the pacification of the State, the advancement of God's word, and the\nwelfare of your own future life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAm I expected to take these fair words on trust, my lord? or may I hear\nthe contents of these reconciling papers, ere I am asked to sign them?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnquestionably, madam; it is our purpose and wish, you should read what\nyou are required to sign,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Ruthven.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRequired?\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Queen, with some emphasis; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut the phrase suits\nwell the matter-read, my lord.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Lord Ruthven proceeded to read a formal instrument, running in the\nQueen's name, and setting forth that she had been called, at an early\nage, to the administration of the crown and realm of Scotland, and had\ntoiled diligently therein, until she was in body and spirit so wearied\nout and disgusted, that she was unable any longer to endure the travail\nand pain of State affairs; and that since God had blessed her with a\nfair and hopeful son, she was desirous to ensure to him, even while\nshe yet lived, his succession to the crown, which was his by right of\nhereditary descent. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWherefore,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the instrument proceeded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe, of the\nmotherly affection we bear to our said son, have renounced and demitted,\nand by these our letters of free good-will, renounce and demit, the\nCrown, government, and guiding of the realm of Scotland, in favour of\nour said son, that he may succeed to us as native Prince thereof, as\nmuch as if we had been removed by disease, and not by our own proper\nact. And that this demission of our royal authority may have the more\nfull and solemn effect, and none pretend ignorance, we give, grant,\nand commit, fall and free and plain power to our trusty cousins, Lord\nLindesay of the Byres, and William Lord Ruthven, to appear in our\nname before as many of the nobility, clergy, and burgesses, as may be\nassembled at Stirling, and there, in our name and behalf, publicly, and\nin their presence, to renounce the Crown, guidance, and government of\nthis our kingdom of Scotland.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Queen here broke in with an air of extreme surprise. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow is this,\nmy lords?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre my ears turned rebels, that they deceive me\nwith sounds so extraordinary?--And yet it is no wonder that, having\nconversed so long with rebellion, they should now force its language\nupon my understanding. Say I am mistaken, my lords--say, for the honour\nof yourselves and the Scottish nobility, that my right trusty cousins of\nLindesay and Ruthven, two barons of warlike fame and ancient line, have\nnot sought the prison-house of their kind mistress for such a purpose as\nthese words seem to imply. Say, for the sake of honour and loyalty, that\nmy ears have deceived me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ruthven gravely, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour ears do _not_ deceive you--they\ndeceived you when they were closed against the preachers of the\nevangele, and the honest advice of your faithful subjects; and when\nthey were ever open to flattery of pickthanks and traitors, foreign\ncubiculars and domestic minions. The land may no longer brook the rule\nof one who cannot rule herself; wherefore, I pray you to comply with the\nlast remaining wish of your subjects and counsellors, and spare yourself\nand us the farther agitation of matter so painful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd is this _all_ my loving subjects require of me, my lord?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nMary, in a tone of bitter irony. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo they really stint themselves to the\neasy boon that I should yield up the crown, which is mine by birthright,\nto an infant which is scarcely more than a year old--fling down my\nsceptre, and take up a distaff--Oh no! it is too little for them to\nask--That other roll of parchment contains something harder to be\ncomplied with, and which may more highly task my readiness to comply\nwith the petitions of my lieges.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis parchment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Ruthven, in the same tone of inflexible\ngravity, and unfolding the instrument as he spoke, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis one by which your\ngrace constitutes your nearest in blood, and the most honourable and\ntrustworthy of your subjects, James, Earl of Murray, Regent of the\nkingdom during the minority of the young King. He already holds the\nappointment from the Secret Council.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Queen gave a sort of shriek, and, clapping her hands together,\nexclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cComes the arrow out of his quiver?--out of my brother's\nbow?--Alas! I looked for his return from France as my sole, at least my\nreadiest, chance of deliverance.--And yet, when I heard he had assumed\nthe government, I guessed he would shame to wield it in my name.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI must pray your answer, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Ruthven, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto the demand of\nthe Council.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe demand of the Council!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen; \u00e2\u0080\u009csay rather the demand of a\nset of robbers, impatient to divide the spoil they have seized. To such\na demand, and sent by the mouth of a traitor, whose scalp, but for my\nwomanish mercy, should long since have stood on the city gates, Mary of\nScotland has no answer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI trust, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Ruthven, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy being unacceptable to your\npresence will not add to your obduracy of resolution. It may become\nyou to remember that the death of the minion, Rizzio, cost the house\nof Ruthven its head and leader. My father, more worthy than a whole\nprovince of such vile sycophants, died in exile, and broken-hearted.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Queen clasped her hands on her face, and, resting her arms on the\ntable, stooped down her head and wept so bitterly, that the tears were\nseen to find their way in streams between the white and slender fingers\nwith which she endeavoured to conceal them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lords,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Robert Melville, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is too much rigour. Under\nyour lordship's favour, we came hither, not to revive old griefs, but to\nfind the mode of avoiding new ones.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir Robert Melville,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ruthven, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe best know for what purpose we\nwere delegated hither, and wherefore you were somewhat unnecessarily\nsent to attend us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, by my hand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Lindesay, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know not why we were cumbered\nwith the good knight, unless he comes in place of the lump of sugar\nwhich pothicars put into their wholesome but bitter medicaments, to\nplease a froward child--a needless labour, methinks, where men have the\nmeans to make them swallow the physic otherwise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, my lords,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Melville, \u00e2\u0080\u009cye best know your own secret\ninstructions. I conceive I shall best obey mine in striving to mediate\nbetween her Grace and you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe silent, Sir Robert Melville,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, arising, and her face\nstill glowing with agitation as she spoke. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy kerchief, Fleming--I\nshame that traitors should have power to move me thus.--Tell me, proud\nlords,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added, wiping away the tears as she spoke, \u00e2\u0080\u009cby what earthly\nwarrant can liege subjects pretend to challenge the rights of an\nanointed Sovereign--to throw off the allegiance they have vowed, and to\ntake away the crown from the head on which Divine warrant hath placed\nit?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ruthven, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will deal plainly with you. Your reign, from\nthe dismal field of Pinkie-cleugh, when you were a babe in the cradle,\ntill now that ye stand a grown dame before us, hath been such a tragedy\nof losses, disasters, civil dissensions, and foreign wars, that the like\nis not to be found in our chronicles. The French and English have, with\none consent, made Scotland the battle-field on which to fight out their\nown ancient quarrel.--For ourselves every man's hand hath been\nagainst his brother, nor hath a year passed over without rebellion and\nslaughter, exile of nobles, and oppressing of the commons. We may endure\nit no longer, and therefore, as a prince, to whom God hath refused the\ngift of hearkening to wise counsel, and on whose dealings and projects\nno blessing hath ever descended, we pray you to give way to other rule\nand governance of the land, that a remnant may yet be saved to this\ndistracted realm.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mary, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit seems to me that you fling on my unhappy and\ndevoted head those evils, which, with far more justice, I may impute\nto your own turbulent, wild, and untameable dispositions--the frantic\nviolence with which you, the Magnates of Scotland, enter into feuds\nagainst each other, sticking at no cruelty to gratify your wrath, taking\ndeep revenge for the slightest offences, and setting at defiance those\nwise laws which your ancestors made for stanching of such cruelty,\nrebelling against the lawful authority, and bearing yourselves as if\nthere were no king in the land; or rather as if each were king in his\nown premises. And now you throw the blame on me--on me, whose life has\nbeen embittered--whose sleep has been broken--whose happiness has been\nwrecked by your dissensions. Have I not myself been obliged to traverse\nwilds and mountains, at the head of a few faithful followers, to\nmaintain peace and put down oppression? Have I not worn harness on my\nperson, and carried pistols at my saddle; fain to lay aside the softness\nof a woman, and the dignity of a Queen, that I might show an example to\nmy followers?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe grant, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lindesay, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat the affrays occasioned by your\nmisgovernment, may sometimes have startled you in the midst of a masque\nor galliard; or it may be that such may have interrupted the idolatry of\nthe mass, or the jesuitical counsels of some French ambassador. But the\nlongest and severest journey which your Grace has taken in my memory,\nwas from Hawick to Hermitage Castle; and whether it was for the weal of\nthe state, or for your own honour, rests with your Grace's conscience.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Queen turned to him with inexpressible sweetness of tone and manner,\nand that engaging look which Heaven had assigned her, as if to show\nthat the choicest arts to win men's affections may be given in vain.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLindesay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou spoke not to me in this stern tone, and with\nsuch scurril taunt, yon fair summer evening, when you and I shot at the\nbutts against the Earl of Mar and Mary Livingstone, and won of them the\nevening's collation, in the privy garden of Saint Andrews. The Master\nof Lindesay was then my friend, and vowed to be my soldier. How I have\noffended the Lord of Lindesay I know not, unless honours have changed\nmanners.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHardhearted as he was, Lindesay seemed struck with this unexpected\nappeal, but almost instantly replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam, it is well known that\nyour Grace could in those days make fools of whomever approached you.\nI pretend not to have been wiser than others. But gayer men and better\ncourtiers soon jostled aside my rude homage, and I think your Grace\ncannot but remember times, when my awkward attempts to take the manners\nthat pleased you, were the sport of the court-popinjays, the Marys and\nthe Frenchwomen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord, I grieve if I have offended you through idle gaiety,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nthe Queen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand can but say it was most unwittingly done. You are fully\nrevenged; for through gaiety,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said with a sigh, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill I never\noffend any one more.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOur time is wasting, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Ruthven; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI must pray your\ndecision on this weighty matter which I have submitted to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat, my lord!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cupon the instant, and without a\nmoment's time to deliberate?--Can the Council, as they term themselves,\nexpect this of me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Ruthven, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Council hold the opinion, that since the\nfatal term which passed betwixt the night of King Henry's murder and the\nday of Carberry-hill, your Grace should have held you prepared for the\nmeasure now proposed, as the easiest escape from your numerous dangers\nand difficulties.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGreat God!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the Queen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand is it as a boon that you propose\nto me, what every Christian king ought to regard as a loss of honour\nequal to the loss of life!--You take from me my crown, my power, my\nsubjects, my wealth, my state. What, in the name of every saint, can you\noffer, or do you offer, in requital of my compliance?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe give you pardon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Ruthven, sternly--\u00e2\u0080\u009cwe give you space and\nmeans to spend your remaining life in penitence and seclusion--we give\nyou time to make your peace with Heaven, and to receive the pure Gospel,\nwhich you have ever rejected and persecuted.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Queen turned pale at the menace which this speech, as well as\nthe rough and inflexible tones of the speaker, seemed distinctly to\ninfer--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd if I do not comply with your request so fiercely urged, my\nlord, what then follows?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe said this in a voice in which female and natural fear was contending\nwith the feelings of insulted dignity.--There was a pause, as if no one\ncared to return to the question a distinct answer. At length Ruthven\nspoke: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is little need to tell to your Grace, who are well read\nboth in the laws and in the chronicles of the realm, that murder and\nadultery are crimes for which ere now queens themselves have suffered\ndeath.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd where, my lord, or how, found you an accusation so horrible,\nagainst her who stands before you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Queen Mary. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe foul and\nodious calumnies which have poisoned the general mind of Scotland, and\nhave placed me a helpless prisoner in your hands, are surely no proof of\nguilt?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need look for no farther proof,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the stern Lord Ruthven,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthan the shameless marriage betwixt the widow of the murdered and the\nleader of the band of murderers!--They that joined hands in the fated\nmonth of May, had already united hearts and counsel in the deed which\npreceded that marriage but a few brief weeks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord, my lord!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, eagerly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cremember well there were\nmore consents than mine to that fatal union, that most unhappy act of\na most unhappy life. The evil steps adopted by sovereigns are often\nthe suggestion of bad counsellors; but these counsellors are worse than\nfiends who tempt and betray, if they themselves are the first to call\ntheir unfortunate princes to answer for the consequences of their own\nadvice.--Heard ye never of a bond by the nobles, my lords, recommending\nthat ill-fated union to the ill-fated Mary? Methinks, were it carefully\nexamined, we should see that the names of Morton and of Lindesay, and\nof Ruthven, may be found in that bond, which pressed me to marry that\nunhappy man.--Ah! stout and loyal Lord Herries, who never knew guile\nor dishonour, you bent your noble knee to me in vain, to warn me of my\ndanger, and wert yet the first to draw thy good sword in my cause when\nI suffered for neglecting thy counsel! Faithful knight and true noble,\nwhat a difference betwixt thee and those counsellors of evil, who now\nthreaten my life for having fallen into the snares they spread for me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ruthven, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe know that you are an orator; and perhaps for\nthat reason the Council has sent hither men, whose converse hath been\nmore with the wars, than with the language of the schools or the cabals\nof state. We but desire to know if, on assurance of life and honour, ye\nwill demit the rule of this kingdom of Scotland?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what warrant have I,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat ye will keep treaty\nwith me, if I should barter my kingly estate for seclusion, and leave to\nweep in secret?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOur honour and our word, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Ruthven.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are too slight and unsolid pledges, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cadd\nat least a handful of thistle-down to give them weight in the balance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAway, Ruthven,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lindesay; \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe was ever deaf to counsel, save of\nslaves and sycophants; let her remain by her refusal, and abide by it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStay, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Robert Melville, \u00e2\u0080\u009cor rather permit me to have\nbut a few minutes' private audience with her Grace. If my presence with\nyou could avail aught, it must be as a mediator--do not, I conjure you,\nleave the castle, or break off the conference, until I bring you word\nhow her Grace shall finally stand disposed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will remain in the hall,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lindesay, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor half an hour's space;\nbut in despising our words and our pledge of honour, she has touched the\nhonour of my name--let her look herself to the course she has to pursue.\nIf the half hour should pass away without her determining to comply with\nthe demands of the nation, her career will be brief enough.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith little ceremony the two nobles left the apartment, traversed the\nvestibule, and descended the winding-stairs, the clash of Lindesay's\nhuge sword being heard as it rang against each step in his descent.\nGeorge Douglas followed them, after exchanging with Melville a gesture\nof surprise and sympathy.\n\nAs soon as they were gone, the Queen, giving way to grief, fear, and\nagitation, threw herself into the seat, wrung her hands, and seemed to\nabandon herself to despair. Her female attendants, weeping themselves,\nendeavoured yet to pray her to be composed, and Sir Robert Melville,\nkneeling at her feet, made the same entreaty. After giving way to a\npassionate burst of sorrow, she at length said to Melville, \u00e2\u0080\u009cKneel not\nto me, Melville--mock me not with the homage of the person, when the\nheart is far away--Why stay you behind with the deposed, the condemned?\nher who has but few hours perchance to live? You have been favoured as\nwell as the rest; why do you continue the empty show of gratitude and\nthankfulness any longer than they?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Robert Melville, \u00e2\u0080\u009cso help me Heaven at my need, my\nheart is as true to you as when you were in your highest place.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrue to me! true to me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeated the Queen, with some scorn; \u00e2\u0080\u009ctush,\nMelville, what signifies the truth which walks hand in hand with my\nenemies' falsehood?--thy hand and thy sword have never been so well\nacquainted that I can trust thee in aught where manhood is required--Oh,\nSeyton, for thy bold father, who is both wise, true, and valiant!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland Graeme could withstand no longer his earnest desire to offer his\nservices to a princess so distressed and so beautiful. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf one sword,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmadam, can do any thing to back the wisdom of this grave\ncounsellor, or to defend your rightful cause, here is my weapon, and\nhere is my hand ready to draw and use it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And raising his sword with\none hand, he laid the other upon the hilt.\n\nAs he thus held up the weapon, Catherine Seyton exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMethinks\nI see a token from my father, madam;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and immediately crossing the\napartment, she took Roland Graeme by the skirt of the cloak, and asked\nhim earnestly whence he had that sword.\n\nThe page answered with surprise, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMethinks this is no presence in\nwhich to jest--Surely, damsel, you yourself best know whence and how I\nobtained the weapon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs this a time for folly?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine Seyton; \u00e2\u0080\u009cunsheathe the sword\ninstantly!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf the Queen commands me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the youth, looking towards his royal\nmistress.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor shame, maiden!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwouldst thou instigate the poor\nboy to enter into useless strife with the two most approved soldiers in\nScotland?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn your Grace's cause,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will venture my life upon\nthem!\u00e2\u0080\u009d And as he spoke, he drew his weapon partly from the sheath, and a\npiece of parchment, rolled around the blade, fell out and dropped on the\nfloor. Catherine Seyton caught it up with eager haste.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is my father's hand-writing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand doubtless conveys his\nbest duteous advice to your Majesty; I know that it was prepared to be\nsent in this weapon, but I expected another messenger.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy my faith, fair one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thought Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand if you knew not that I had\nsuch a secret missive about me, I was yet more ignorant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Queen cast her eye upon the scroll, and remained a few minutes\nwrapped in deep thought. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSir Robert Melville,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she at length said,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthis scroll advises me to submit myself to necessity, and to subscribe\nthe deeds these hard men have brought with them, as one who gives way to\nthe natural fear inspired by the threats of rebels and murderers. You,\nSir Robert, are a wise man, and Seyton is both sagacious and brave.\nNeither, I think, would mislead me in this matter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Melville, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif I have not the strength of body of the Lord\nHerries or Seyton, I will yield to neither in zeal for your Majesty's\nservice. I cannot fight for you like these lords, but neither of them is\nmore willing to die for your service.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe it, my old and faithful counsellor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand\nbelieve me, Melville, I did thee but a moment's injustice. Read what my\nLord Seyton hath written to us, and give us thy best counsel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe glanced over the parchment, and instantly replied,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! my dear and\nroyal mistress, only treason itself could give you other advice than\nLord Seyton has here expressed. He, Herries, Huntly, the English\nambassador Throgmorton, and others, your friends, are all alike of\nopinion, that whatever deeds or instruments you execute within these\nwalls, must lose all force and effect, as extorted from your Grace by\nduresse, by sufferance of present evil, and fear of men, and harm to\nensue on your refusal. Yield, therefore, to the tide, and be assured,\nthat in subscribing what parchments they present to you, you bind\nyourself to nothing, since your act of signature wants that which alone\ncan make it valid, the free will of the granter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, so says my Lord Seyton,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Mary; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyet methinks, for the\ndaughter of so long a line of sovereigns to resign her birthright,\nbecause rebels press upon her with threats, argues little of royalty,\nand will read ill for the fame of Mary in future chronicles. Tush! Sir\nRobert Melville, the traitors may use black threats and bold words, but\nthey will not dare to put their hands forth on our person.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas! madam, they have already dared so far and incurred such peril by\nthe lengths which they have gone, that they are but one step from the\nworst and uttermost.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSurely,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, her fears again predominating, \u00e2\u0080\u009cScottish\nnobles would not lend themselves to assassinate a helpless woman?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBethink you, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat horrid spectacles have been seen\nin our day; and what act is so dark, that some Scottish hand has not\nbeen found to dare it? Lord Lindesay, besides his natural sullenness and\nhardness of temper, is the near kinsman of Henry Darnley, and Ruthven\nhas his own deep and dangerous plans. The Council, besides, speak of\nproofs by writ and word, of a casket with letters--of I know not what.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! good Melville,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwere I as sure of the\neven-handed integrity of my judges, as of my own innocence--and yet----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! pause, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Melville; \u00e2\u0080\u009ceven innocence must sometimes for a\nseason stoop to injurious blame. Besides, you are here--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe looked round, and paused.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSpeak out, Melville,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnever one approached my person\nwho wished to work me evil; and even this poor page, whom I have\nto-day seen for the first time in my life, I can trust safely with your\ncommunication.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Melville, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin such emergence, and he being the\nbearer of Lord Seyton's message, I will venture to say, before him and\nthese fair ladies, whose truth and fidelity I dispute not--I say I will\nventure to say, that there are other modes besides that of open trial,\nby which deposed sovereigns often die; and that, as Machiavel saith,\nthere is but one step betwixt a king's prison and his grave.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh I were it but swift and easy for the body,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the unfortunate\nPrincess, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwere it but a safe and happy change for the soul, the woman\nlives not that would take the step so soon as I--But, alas! Melville,\nwhen we think of death, a thousand sins, which we have trod as\nworms beneath our feet, rise up against us as flaming serpents. Most\ninjuriously do they accuse me of aiding Darnley's death; yet, blessed\nLady! I afforded too open occasion for the suspicion--I espoused\nBothwell.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThink not of that now, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Melville, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthink rather of the\nimmediate mode of saving yourself and son. Comply with the present\nunreasonable demands, and trust that better times will shortly arrive.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif it pleases you that I should do so, I\nwill presently swim through the lake, if they refuse me other conveyance\nto the shore; I will go to the courts successively of England, France,\nand Spain, and will show you have subscribed these vile instruments from\nno stronger impulse than the fear of death, and I will do battle against\nthem that say otherwise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Queen turned her round, and with one of those sweet smiles which,\nduring the era of life's romance, overpay every risk, held her hand\ntowards Roland, but without \u00e2\u0080\u009cspeaking a word. He kneeled reverently, and\nkissed it, and Melville again resumed his plea.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009ctime presses, and you must not let those boats,\nwhich I see they are even now preparing, put forth on the lake. Here are\nenough of witnesses--your ladies--this bold youth--myself, when it can\nserve your cause effectually, for I would not hastily stand committed in\nthis matter--but even without me here is evidence enough to show, that\nyou have yielded to the demands of the Council through force and fear,\nbut from no sincere and unconstrained assent. Their boats are already\nmanned for their return--oh! permit your old servant to recall them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMelville,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthou art an ancient courtier--when didst\nthou ever know a Sovereign Prince recall to his presence subjects who\nhad parted from him on such terms as those on which these envoys of\nthe Council left us, and who yet were recalled without submission or\napology?--Let it cost me both life and crown, I will not again command\nthem to my presence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas! madam, that empty form should make a barrier! If I rightly\nunderstand, you are not unwilling to listen to real and advantageous\ncounsel--but your scruple is saved--I hear them returning to ask your\nfinal resolution. Oh! take the advice of the noble Seyton, and you may\nonce more command those who now usurp a triumph over you. But hush! I\nhear them in the vestibule.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs he concluded speaking, George Douglas opened the door of the\napartment, and marshalled in the two noble envoys.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe come, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lord Ruthven, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto request your answer to the\nproposal of the Council.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour final answer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Lindesay; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor with a refusal you must\ncouple the certainty that you have precipitated your fate, and renounced\nthe last opportunity of making peace with God, and ensuring your longer\nabode in the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lords,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mary, with inexpressible grace and dignity, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe evils\nwe cannot resist we must submit to--I will subscribe these parchments\nwith such liberty of choice as my condition permits me. Were I on yonder\nshore, with a fleet jennet and ten good and loyal knights around me,\nI would subscribe my sentence of eternal condemnation as soon as the\nresignation of my throne. But here, in the Castle of Lochleven, with\ndeep water around me--and you, my lords, beside me,--I have no freedom\nof choice.--Give me the pen, Melville, and bear witness to what I do,\nand why I do it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is our hope your Grace will not suppose yourself compelled by any\napprehensions from us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lord Ruthven, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto execute what must be\nyour own voluntary deed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Queen had already stooped towards the table, and placed the\nparchment before her, with the pen between her fingers, ready for the\nimportant act of signature. But when Lord Ruthven had done speaking, she\nlooked up, stopped short, and threw down the pen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am\nexpected to declare I give away my crown of free will, or otherwise than\nbecause I am compelled to renounce it by the threat of worse evils to\nmyself and my subjects, I will not put my name to such an untruth--not\nto gain full possession of England, France, and Scotland!--all once my\nown, in possession, or by right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBeware, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lindesay, and, snatching hold of the Queen's arm\nwith his own gauntleted hand, he pressed it, in the rudeness of his\npassion, more closely, perhaps, than he was himself aware of,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cbeware\nhow you contend with those who are the stronger, and have the mastery of\nyour fate!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe held his grasp on her arm, bending his eyes on her with a stern\nand intimidating look, till both Ruthven and Melville cried shame; and\nDouglas, who had hitherto remained in a state of apparent apathy, had\nmade a stride from the door, as if to interfere. The rude Baron then\nquitted his hold, disguising the confusion which he really felt\nat having indulged his passion to such extent, under a sullen and\ncontemptuous smile.\n\nThe Queen immediately began, with an expression of pain, to bare the\narm which he had grasped, by drawing up the sleeve of her gown, and it\nappeared that his gripe had left the purple marks of his iron fingers\nupon her flesh--\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas a knight and gentleman, you\nmight have spared my frail arm so severe a proof that you have the\ngreater strength on your side, and are resolved to use it--But I thank\nyou for it--it is the most decisive token of the terms on which this\nday's business is to rest.--I draw you to witness, both lords and\nladies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, showing the marks of the grasp on her arm, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I\nsubscribe these instruments in obedience to the sign manual of my Lord\nof Lindesay, which you may see imprinted on mine arm.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n[Footnote: The details of this remarkable event are, as given in\nthe preceding chapter, imaginary; but the outline of the events is\nhistorical. Sir Robert Lindesay, brother to the author of the Memoirs,\nwas at first intrusted with the delicate commission of persuading the\nimprisoned queen to resign her crown. As he flatly refused to interfere,\nthey determined to send the Lord Lindesay, one of the rudest and most\nviolent of their own faction, with instructions, first to use fair\npersuasions, and if these did not succeed, to enter into harder terms.\nKnox associates Lord Ruthven with Lindesay in this alarming commission.\nHe was the son of that Lord Ruthven who was prime agent in the murder\nof Rizzio; and little mercy was to be expected from his conjunction with\nLindesay.\n\nThe employment of such rude tools argued a resolution on the part of\nthose who had the Queen's person in their power, to proceed to the\nutmost extremities, should they find Mary obstinate. To avoid this\npressing danger, Sir Robert Melville was despatched by them to\nLochleven, carrying with him, concealed in the scabbard of his sword,\nletters to the Queen from the Earl of Athole, Maitland of Lethington,\nand even from Throgmorton, the English Ambassador, who was then\nfavourable to the unfortunate Mary, conjuring her to yield to the\nnecessity of the times, and to subscribe such deeds as Lindesay should\nlay before her, without being startled by their tenor; and assuring her\nthat her doing so, in the state of captivity under which she was placed,\nwould neither, in law, honour, nor conscience, be binding upon her when\nshe should obtain her liberty. Submitting by the advice of one part of\nher subjects to the menace of the others, and learning that Lindesay\nwas arrived in a boasting, that is, threatening humour, the Queen,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwith some reluctancy, and with tears,\u00e2\u0080\u009d saith Knox, subscribed one deed\nresigning her crown to her infant son, and another establishing the Earl\nof Murray regent. It seems agreed by historians that Lindesay behaved\nwith great brutality on the occasion. The deeds were signed 24th July,\n1567.]\n\nLindesay would have spoken, but was restrained by his colleague Ruthven,\nwho said to him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeace, my lord. Let the Lady Mary of Scotland ascribe\nher signature to what she will, it is our business to procure it, and\ncarry it to the Council. Should there be debate hereafter on the manner\nin which it was adhibited, there will be time enough for it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLindesay was silent accordingly, only muttering within his beard,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI meant not to hurt her; but I think women's flesh be as tender as\nnew-fallen snow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Queen meanwhile subscribed the rolls of parchment with a hasty\nindifference, as if they had been matters of slight consequence, or of\nmere formality. When she had performed this painful task, she arose,\nand, having curtsied to the lords, was about to withdraw to her chamber.\nRuthven and Sir Robert Melville made, the first a formal reverence, the\nsecond an obeisance, in which his desire to acknowledge his sympathy was\nobviously checked by the fear of appearing in the eyes of his colleagues\ntoo partial to his former mistress. But Lindesay stood motionless, even\nwhen they were preparing to withdraw. At length, as if moved by a sudden\nimpulse, he walked round the table which had hitherto been betwixt them\nand the Queen, kneeled on one knee, took her hand, kissed it, let it\nfall, and arose--\u00e2\u0080\u009cLady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthou art a noble creature, even\nthough thou hast abused God's choicest gifts. I pay that devotion to thy\nmanliness of spirit, which I would not have paid to the power thou hast\nlong undeservedly wielded--I kneel to Mary Stewart, not to the Queen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Queen and Mary Stewart pity thee alike, Lindesay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nMary--\u00e2\u0080\u009calike thee pity, and they forgive thee. An honoured soldier hadst\nthou been by a king's side--leagued with rebels, what art thou but a\ngood blade in the hands of a ruffian?--Farewell, my Lord Ruthven, the\nsmoother but the deeper traitor.--Farewell, Melville--Mayest thou find\nmasters that can understand state policy better, and have the means\nto reward it more richly, than Mary Stewart.--Farewell, George of\nDouglas--make your respected grand-dame comprehend that we would be\nalone for the remainder of the day--God wot, we have need to collect our\nthoughts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAll bowed and withdrew; but scarce had they entered the vestibule, ere\nRuthven and Lindesay were at variance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cChide not with me, Ruthven,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Lindesay was heard to say, in answer to something more indistinctly\nurged by his colleague--\u00e2\u0080\u009cChide not with me, for I will not brook it! You\nput the hangman's office on me in this matter, and even the very hangman\nhath leave to ask some pardon of those on whom he does his office. I\nwould I had as deep cause to be this lady's friend as I have to be her\nenemy--thou shouldst see if I spared limb and life in her quarrel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThou art a sweet minion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ruthven, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto fight a lady's quarrel, and\nall for a brent brow and a tear in the eye! Such toys have been out of\nthy thoughts this many a year.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo me right, Ruthven,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lindesay. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are like a polished corslet\nof steel; it shines more gaudily, but it is not a whit softer--nay,\nit is five times harder than a Glasgow breastplate of hammered iron.\nEnough. We know each other.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey descended the stairs, were heard to summon their boats, and the\nQueen signed to Roland Graeme to retire to the vestibule, and leave her\nwith her female attendants.\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Twenty-Third.\n\n\n  Give me a morsel on the greensward rather,\n  Coarse as you will the cooking--Let the fresh spring\n  Bubble beside my napkin--and the free birds\n  Twittering and chirping, hop from bough to bough,\n  To claim the crumbs I leave for perquisites--\n  Your prison feasts I like not.\n                           THE WOODSMAN, A DRAMA.\n\nA recess in the vestibule was enlightened by a small window, at which\nRoland Graeme stationed himself to mark the departure of the lords. He\ncould see their followers mustering on horseback under their respective\nbanners--the western sun glancing on their corslets and steel-caps\nas they moved to and fro, mounted or dismounted, at intervals. On the\nnarrow space betwixt the castle and the water, the Lords Ruthven and\nLindesay were already moving slowly to their boats, accompanied by the\nLady of Lochleven, her grandson, and their principal attendants. They\ntook a ceremonious leave of each other, as Roland could discern by their\ngestures, and the boats put oft from their landing-place; the boatmen\nstretched to their oars, and they speedily diminished upon the eye\nof the idle gazer, who had no better employment than to watch their\nmotions. Such seemed also the occupation of the Lady Lochleven and\nGeorge Douglas, who, returning from the landing-place, looked frequently\nback to the boats, and at length stopped as if to observe their progress\nunder the window at which Roland Graeme was stationed.--As they gazed on\nthe lake, he could hear the lady distinctly say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd she has bent her\nmind to save her life at the expense of her kingdom?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHer life, madam!\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied her son; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know not who would dare to\nattempt it in the castle of my father. Had I dreamt that it was with\nsuch purpose that Lindesay insisted on bringing his followers hither,\nneither he nor they should have passed the iron gate of Lochleven\ncastle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI speak not of private slaughter, my son, but of open trial,\ncondemnation, and execution; for with such she has been threatened, and\nto such threats she has given way. Had she not more of the false Gusian\nblood than of the royal race of Scotland in her veins, she had bidden\nthem defiance to their teeth--But it is all of the same complexion,\nand meanness is the natural companion of profligacy.--I am discharged,\nforsooth, from intruding on her gracious presence this evening. Go\nthou, my son, and render the usual service of the meal to this unqueened\nQueen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo please you, lady mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Douglas, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI care not greatly to\napproach her presence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThou art right, my son; and therefore I trust thy prudence, even\nbecause I have noted thy caution. She is like an isle on the ocean,\nsurrounded with shelves and quicksands; its verdure fair and inviting to\nthe eye, but the wreck of many a goodly vessel which hath approached it\ntoo rashly. But for thee, my son, I fear nought; and we may not, with\nour honour, suffer her to eat without the attendance of one of us. She\nmay die by the judgment of Heaven, or the fiend may have power over her\nin her despair; and then we would be touched in honour to show that\nin our house, and at our table, she had had all fair play and fitting\nusage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHere Roland was interrupted by a smart tap on the shoulders, reminding\nhim sharply of Adam Woodcock's adventure of the preceding evening.\nHe turned round, almost expecting to see the page of Saint Michael's\nhostelry. He saw, indeed, Catherine Seyton; but she was in female\nattire, differing, no doubt, a great deal in shape and materials from\nthat which she had worn when they first met, and becoming her birth\nas the daughter of a great baron, and her rank as the attendant on a\nprincess. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo, fair page,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009ceaves-dropping is one of your\npage-like qualities, I presume.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFair sister,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Roland, in the same tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif some friends of\nmine be as well acquainted with the rest of our mystery as they are with\nthe arts of swearing, swaggering, and switching, they need ask no page\nin Christendom for farther insight into his vocation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnless that pretty speech infer that you have yourself had the\ndiscipline of the switch since we last met, the probability whereof I\nnothing doubt, I profess, fair page, I am at a loss to conjecture your\nmeaning. But there is no time to debate it now--they come with the\nevening meal. Be pleased, Sir Page, to do your duty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFour servants entered bearing dishes, preceded by the same stern old\nsteward whom Roland had already seen, and followed by George Douglas,\nalready mentioned as the grandson of the Lady of Lochleven, and who,\nacting as seneschal, represented, upon this occasion, his father, the\nLord of the Castle. He entered with his arms folded on his bosom, and\nhis looks bent on the ground. With the assistance of Roland Graeme, a\ntable was suitably covered in the next or middle apartment, on which\nthe domestics placed their burdens with great reverence, the steward and\nDouglas bending low when they had seen the table properly adorned, as if\ntheir royal prisoner had sat at the board in question. The door opened,\nand Douglas, raising his eyes hastily, cast them again on the earth,\nwhen he perceived it was only the Lady Mary Fleming who entered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHer Grace,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill not eat to-night.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet us hope she may be otherwise persuaded,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Douglas; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmeanwhile,\nmadam, please to see our duty performed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA servant presented bread and salt on a silver plate, and the old\nsteward carved for Douglas a small morsel in succession from each of the\ndishes presented, which he tasted, as was then the custom at the tables\nof princes, to which death was often suspected to find its way in the\ndisguise of food.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Queen will not then come forth to-night?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Douglas.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe has so determined,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the lady.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOur farther attendance then is unnecessary--we leave you to your\nsupper, fair ladies, and wish you good even.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe retired slowly as he came, and with the same air of deep dejection,\nand was followed by the attendants belonging to the castle. The two\nladies sate down to their meal, and Roland Graeme, with ready alacrity,\nprepared to wait upon them. Catherine Seyton whispered to her companion,\nwho replied with the question spoken in a low tone, but looking at the\npage--\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs he of gentle blood and well nurtured?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe answer which she received seemed satisfactory, for she said to\nRoland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSit down, young gentleman, and eat with your sisters in\ncaptivity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPermit me rather to perform my duty in attending them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland,\nanxious to show he was possessed of the high tone of deference\nprescribed by the rules of chivalry towards the fair sex, and especially\nto dames and maidens of quality.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will find, Sir Page,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou will have little time\nallowed you for your meal; waste it not in ceremony, or you may rue your\npoliteness ere to-morrow morning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour speech is too free, maiden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the elder lady; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe modesty of\nthe youth may teach you more fitting fashions towards one whom to-day\nyou have seen for the first time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCatherine Seyton cast down her eyes, but not till she had given a single\nglance of inexpressible archness towards Roland, whom her more grave\ncompanion now addressed in a tone of protection.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRegard her not, young gentleman--she knows little of the world, save\nthe forms of a country nunnery--take thy place at the board-end, and\nrefresh thyself after thy journey.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland Graeme obeyed willingly, as it was the first food he had that day\ntasted; for Lindesay and his followers seemed regardless of human wants.\nYet, notwithstanding the sharpness of his appetite, a natural gallantry\nof disposition, the desire of showing himself a well-nurtured gentleman,\nin all courtesies towards the fair sex, and, for aught I know, the\npleasure of assisting Catherine Seyton, kept his attention awake, during\nthe meal, to all those nameless acts of duty and service which gallants\nof that age were accustomed to render. He carved with neatness and\ndecorum, and selected duly whatever was most delicate to place before\nthe ladies. Ere they could form a wish, he sprung from the table, ready\nto comply with it--poured wine--tempered it with water--removed the\nexchanged trenchers, and performed the whole honours of the table, with\nan air at once of cheerful diligence, profound respect, and graceful\npromptitude.\n\nWhen he observed that they had finished eating, he hastened to offer to\nthe elder lady the silver ewer, basin, and napkin, with the ceremony and\ngravity which he would have used towards Mary herself. He next, with the\nsame decorum, having supplied the basin with fair water, presented it\nto Catherine Seyton. Apparently, she was determined to disturb his\nself-possession, if possible; for, while in the act of bathing her\nhands, she contrived, as it were by accident, to flirt some drops of\nwater upon the face of the assiduous assistant. But if such was her\nmischievous purpose she was completely disappointed; for Roland Graeme,\ninternally piquing himself on his self-command, neither laughed nor was\ndiscomposed; and all that the maiden gained by her frolic was a severe\nrebuke from her companion, taxing her with mal-address and indecorum.\nCatherine replied not, but sat pouting, something in the humour of a\nspoilt child, who watches the opportunity of wreaking upon some one or\nother its resentment for a deserved reprimand.\n\nThe Lady Mary Fleming, in the mean-while, was naturally well pleased\nwith the exact and reverent observance of the page, and said to\nCatherine, after a favourable glance at Roland Graeme,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou might well\nsay, Catherine, our companion in captivity was well born and gentle\nnurtured. I would not make him vain by my praise, but his services\nenable us to dispense with those which George Douglas condescends not to\nafford us, save when the Queen is herself in presence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUmph! I think hardly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Catherine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGeorge Douglas is one of\nthe most handsome gallants in Scotland, and 'tis pleasure to see\nhim even still, when the gloom of Lochleven Castle has shed the same\nmelancholy over him, that it has done over every thing else. When he was\nat Holyrood who would have said the young sprightly George Douglas would\nhave been contented to play the locksman here in Lochleven, with no\ngayer amusement than that of turning the key on two or three helpless\nwomen?--a strange office for a Knight of the Bleeding Heart--why does he\nnot leave it to his father or his brothers?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps, like us, he has no choice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Lady Fleming. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut,\nCatherine, thou hast used thy brief space at court well, to remember\nwhat George Douglas was then.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI used mine eyes, which I suppose was what I was designed to do, and\nthey were worth using there. When I was at the nunnery, they were very\nuseless appurtenances; and now I am at Lochleven, they are good for\nnothing, save to look over that eternal work of embroidery.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou speak thus, when you have been but a few brief hours amongst\nus--was this the maiden who would live and die in a dungeon, might she\nbut have permission to wait on her gracious Queen?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, if you chide in earnest, my jest is ended,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine Seyton.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would not yield in attachment to my poor god-mother, to the gravest\ndame that ever had wise saws upon her tongue, and a double-starched ruff\naround her throat--you know I would not, Dame Mary Fleming, and it is\nputting shame on me to say otherwise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe will challenge the other court lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thought Roland Graeme; \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe\nwill to a certainty fling down her glove, and if Dame Mary Fleming hath\nbut the soul to lift it, we may have a combat in the lists!\u00e2\u0080\u009d--but the\nanswer of Lady Mary Fleming was such as turns away wrath.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThou art a good child,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy Catherine, and a faithful;\nbut Heaven pity him who shall have one day a creature so beautiful to\ndelight him, and a thing so mischievous to torment him--thou art fit to\ndrive twenty husbands stark mad.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine, resuming the full career of her careless\ngood-humour, \u00e2\u0080\u009che must be half-witted beforehand, that gives me such\nan opportunity. But I am glad you are not angry with me in sincerity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n casting herself as she spoke into the arms of her friend, and\ncontinuing, with a tone of apologetic fondness, while she kissed her\non either side of the face; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou know, my dear Fleming, that I have to\ncontend with both my father's lofty pride, and with my mother's high\nspirit--God bless them! they have left me these good qualities, having\nsmall portion to give besides, as times go--and so I am wilful and\nsaucy; but let me remain only a week in this castle, and oh, my dear\nFleming, my spirit will be as chastised and humble as thine own.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDame Mary Fleming's sense of dignity, and love of form, could not\nresist this affectionate appeal. She kissed Catherine Seyton in her turn\naffectionately; while, answering the last part of her speech, she said,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow Our Lady forbid, dear Catherine, that you should lose aught that\nis beseeming of what becomes so well your light heart and lively humour.\nKeep but your sharp wit on this side of madness, and it cannot but be\na blessing to us. But let me go, mad wench--I hear her Grace touch her\nsilver call.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And, extricating herself from Catherine's grasp, she went\ntowards the door of Queen Mary's apartment, from which was heard the low\ntone of a silver whistle, which, now only used by the boatswains in the\nnavy, was then, for want of bells, the ordinary mode by which ladies,\neven of the very highest rank, summoned their domestics. When she had\nmade two or three steps towards the door, however, she turned back, and\nadvancing to the young couple whom she left together, she said, in a\nvery serious though a low tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI trust it is impossible that we can,\nany of us, or in any circumstances, forget, that, few as we are, we form\nthe household of the Queen of Scotland; and that, in her calamity, all\nboyish mirth and childish jesting can only serve to give a great triumph\nto her enemies, who have already found their account in objecting to her\nthe lightness of every idle folly, that the young and the gay practised\nin her court.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, she left the apartment.\n\nCatherine Seyton seemed much struck with this remonstrance--She suffered\nherself to drop into the seat which she had quitted when she went to\nembrace Dame Mary Fleming, and for some time rested her brow upon her\nhands; while Roland Graeme looked at her earnestly, with a mixture\nof emotions which perhaps he himself could neither have analysed nor\nexplained. As she raised her face slowly from the posture to which a\nmomentary feeling of self-rebuke had depressed it, her eyes encountered\nthose of Roland, and became gradually animated with their usual\nspirit of malicious drollery, which not unnaturally excited a similar\nexpression in those of the equally volatile page. They sat for the space\nof two minutes, each looking at the other with great seriousness on\ntheir features, and much mirth in their eyes, until at length Catherine\nwas the first to break silence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMay I pray you, fair sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she began, very demurely, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto tell me what\nyou see in my face to arouse looks so extremely sagacious and knowing\nas those with which it is your worship's pleasure to honour me? It would\nseem as if there were some wonderful confidence and intimacy betwixt us,\nfair sir, if one is to judge from your extremely cunning looks; and so\nhelp me, Our Lady, as I never saw you but twice in my life before.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd where were those happy occasions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif I may be bold\nenough to ask the question?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt the nunnery of St. Catherine's,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the damsel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin the first\ninstance; and, in the second, during five minutes of a certain raid or\nforay which it was your pleasure to make into the lodging of my lord\nand father, Lord Seyton, from which, to my surprise, as probably to\nyour own, you returned with a token of friendship and favour, instead\nof broken bones, which were the more probable reward of your intrusion,\nconsidering the prompt ire of the house of Seyton. I am deeply\nmortified,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added, ironically, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat your recollection should\nrequire refreshment on a subject so important; and that my memory should\nbe stronger than yours on such an occasion, is truly humiliating.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour own, memory is not so exactly correct, fair mistress,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered\nthe page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cseeing you have forgotten meeting the third, in the hostelrie\nof St. Michael's, when it pleased you to lay your switch across the\nface of my comrade, in order, I warrant, to show that, in the house of\nSeyton, neither the prompt ire of its descendants, nor the use of the\ndoublet and hose, are subject to Salique law, or confined to the use of\nthe males.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFair sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Catherine, looking at him with great steadiness,\nand some surprise, \u00e2\u0080\u009cunless your fair wits have forsaken you, I am at a\nloss what to conjecture of your meaning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy my troth, fair mistress,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand were I as wise a\nwarlock as Michael Scott, I could scarce riddle the dream you read me.\nDid I not see you last night in the hostelrie of St. Michael's?--Did you\nnot bring me this sword, with command not to draw it save at the command\nof my native and rightful Sovereign? And have I not done as you required\nme? Or is the sword a piece of lath--my word a bulrush--my memory a\ndream--and my eyes good for nought--espials which corbies might pick out\nof my head?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd if your eyes serve you not more truly on other occasions than\nin your vision of St. Michael,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know not, the\npain apart, that the corbies would do you any great injury in\nthe deprivation--But hark, the bell--hush, for God's sake, we are\ninterrupted.--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe damsel was right; for no sooner had the dull toll of the castle bell\nbegun to resound through the vaulted apartment, than the door of the\nvestibule flew open, and the steward, with his severe countenance, his\ngold chain, and his white rod, entered the apartment, followed by the\nsame train of domestics who had placed the dinner on the table, and who\nnow, with the same ceremonious formality, began to remove it.\n\nThe steward remained motionless as some old picture, while the domestics\ndid their office; and when it was accomplished, every thing removed from\nthe table, and the board itself taken from its tressels and disposed\nagainst the wall, he said aloud, without addressing any one in\nparticular, and somewhat in the tone of a herald reading a proclamation,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy noble lady, Dame Margaret Erskine, by marriage Douglas, lets the\nLady Mary of Scotland and her attendants to wit, that a servant of the\ntrue evangele, her reverend chaplain, will to-night, as usual, expound,\nlecture, and catechise, according to the forms of the congregation of\ngospellers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHark you, my friend, Mr. Dryfesdale,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI understand\nthis announcement is a nightly form of yours. Now, I pray you to remark,\nthat the Lady Fleming and I--for I trust your insolent invitation\nconcerns us only--have chosen Saint Peter's pathway to Heaven, so I see\nno one whom your godly exhortation, catechise, or lecture, can benefit,\nexcepting this poor page, who, being in Satan's hand as well as\nyourself, had better worship with you than remain to cumber our\nbetter-advised devotions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe page was well-nigh giving a round denial to the assertions which\nthis speech implied, when, remembering what had passed betwixt him and\nthe Regent, and seeing Catherine's finger raised in a monitory fashion,\nhe felt himself, as on former occasions at the Castle of Avenel, obliged\nto submit to the task of dissimulation, and followed Dryfesdale down to\nthe castle chapel, where he assisted in the devotions of the evening.\n\nThe chaplain was named Elias Henderson. He was a man in the prime of\nlife, and possessed of good natural parts, carefully improved by the\nbest education which those times afforded. To these qualities were added\na faculty of close and terse reasoning; and, at intervals, a flow of\nhappy illustration and natural eloquence. The religious faith of Roland\nGraeme, as we have already had opportunity to observe, rested on\nno secure basis, but was entertained rather in obedience to his\ngrandmother's behests, and his secret desire to contradict the chaplain\nof Avenel Castle, than from any fixed or steady reliance which he placed\non the Romish creed. His ideas had been of late considerably enlarged\nby the scenes he had passed through; and feeling that there was shame\nin not understanding something of those political disputes betwixt the\nprofessors of the ancient and the reformed faith, he listened with\nmore attention than it had hitherto been in his nature to yield on such\noccasions, to an animated discussion of some of the principal points\nof difference betwixt the churches. So passed away the first day in the\nCastle of Lochleven; and those which followed it were, for some time, of\na very monotonous and uniform tenor.\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Twenty-Fourth.\n\n\n  'Tis a weary life this--\n  Vaults overhead, and grates and bars around me,\n  And my sad hours spent with as sad companions,\n  Whose thoughts are brooding: o'er their own mischances,\n  Far, far too deeply to take part in mine.\n                                      THE WOODSMAN.\n\nThe course of life to which Mary and her little retinue were doomed,\nwas in the last degree secluded and lonely, varied only as the weather\npermitted or rendered impossible the Queen's usual walk in the garden or\non the battlements. The greater part of the morning she wrought with her\nladies at those pieces of needlework, many of which still remain proofs\nof her indefatigable application. At such hours the page was permitted\nthe freedom of the castle and islet; nay, he was sometimes invited to\nattend George Douglas when he went a-sporting upon the lake, or on\nits margin; opportunities of diversion which were only clouded by the\nremarkable melancholy which always seemed to brood on that gentleman's\nbrow, and to mark his whole demeanour,--a sadness so profound, that\nRoland never observed him to smile, or to speak any word unconnected\nwith the immediate object of their exercise.\n\nThe most pleasant part of Roland's day, was the occasional space which\nhe was permitted to pass in personal attendance on the Queen and her\nladies, together with the regular dinner-time, which he always spent\nwith Dame Mary Fleming and Catharine Seyton. At these periods, he had\nfrequent occasion to admire the lively spirit and inventive imagination\nof the latter damsel, who was unwearied in her contrivances to amuse\nher mistress, and to banish, for a time at least, the melancholy which\npreyed on her bosom. She danced, she sung, she recited tales of ancient\nand modern times, with that heartfelt exertion of talent, of which the\npleasure lies not in the vanity of displaying it to others, but in the\nenthusiastic consciousness that we possess it ourselves. And yet these\nhigh accomplishments were mixed with an air of rusticity and harebrained\nvivacity, which seemed rather to belong to some village maid, the\ncoquette of the ring around the Maypole, than to the high-bred\ndescendant of an ancient baron. A touch of audacity, altogether short\nof effrontery, and far less approaching to vulgarity, gave as it were a\nwildness to all that she did; and Mary, while defending her from some\nof the occasional censures of her grave companion, compared her to a\ntrained singing-bird escaped from a cage, which practises in all the\nluxuriance of freedom, and in full possession of the greenwood bough,\nthe airs which it had learned during its earlier captivity.\n\nThe moments which the page was permitted to pass in the presence of this\nfascinating creature, danced so rapidly away, that, brief as they were,\nthey compensated the weary dulness of all the rest of the day. The\nspace of indulgence, however, was always brief, nor were any private\ninterviews betwixt him and Catharine permitted, or even possible.\nWhether it were some special precaution respecting the Queen's\nhousehold, or whether it were her general ideas of propriety, Dame\nFleming seemed particularly attentive to prevent the young people\nfrom holding any separate correspondence together, and bestowed, for\nCatharine's sole benefit in this matter, the full stock of prudence and\nexperience which she had acquired, when mother of the Queen's maidens\nof honour, and by which she had gained their hearty hatred. Casual\nmeetings, however, could not be prevented, unless Catherine had been\nmore desirous of shunning, or Roland Graeme less anxious in watching for\nthem. A smile, a gibe, a sarcasm, disarmed of its severity by the arch\nlook with which it was accompanied, was all that time permitted to pass\nbetween them on such occasions. But such passing interviews neither\nafforded means nor opportunity to renew the discussion of the\ncircumstances attending their earlier acquaintance, nor to permit Roland\nto investigate more accurately the mysterious apparition of the page in\nthe purple velvet cloak at the hostelrie of Saint Michael's.\n\nThe winter months slipped heavily away, and spring was already advanced,\nwhen Roland Graeme observed a gradual change in the manners of his\nfellow-prisoners. Having no business of his own to attend to, and being,\nlike those of his age, education, and degree, sufficiently curious\nconcerning what passed around, he began by degrees to suspect, and\nfinally to be convinced, that there was something in agitation among his\ncompanions in captivity, to which they did not desire that he should be\nprivy. Nay, he became almost certain that, by some means unintelligible\nto him, Queen Mary held correspondence beyond the walls and waters which\nsurrounded her prison-house, and that she nourished some secret hope\nof deliverance or escape. In the conversations betwixt her and her\nattendants, at which he was necessarily present, the Queen could not\nalways avoid showing that she was acquainted with the events which were\npassing abroad in the world, and which he only heard through her report.\nHe observed that she wrote more and worked less than had been her former\ncustom, and that, as if desirous to lull suspicion asleep, she changed\nher manner towards the Lady Lochleven into one more gracious, and which\nseemed to express a resigned submission to her lot. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey think I am\nblind,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to himself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand that I am unfit to be trusted because\nI am so young, or it may be because I was sent hither by the Regent.\nWell!--be it so--they may be glad to confide in me in the long run;\nand Catherine Seyton, for as saucy as she is, may find me as safe a\nconfidant as that sullen Douglas, whom she is always running after. It\nmay be they are angry with me for listening to Master Elias Henderson;\nbut it was their own fault for sending me there, and if the man speaks\ntruth and good sense, and preaches only the word of God, he is as likely\nto be right as either Pope or Councils.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt is probable that in this last conjecture, Roland Graeme had hit upon\nthe real cause why the ladies had not intrusted him with their councils.\nHe had of late had several conferences with Henderson on the subject of\nreligion, and had given him to understand that he stood in need of his\ninstructions, although he had not thought there was either prudence or\nnecessity for confessing that hitherto he had held the tenets of the\nChurch of Rome.\n\nElias Henderson, a keen propagator of the reformed faith, had sought the\nseclusion of Lochleven Castle, with the express purpose and expectation\nof making converts from Rome amongst the domestics of the dethroned\nQueen, and confirming the faith of those who already held the Protestant\ndoctrines. Perhaps his hopes soared a little higher, and he might\nnourish some expectation of a proselyte more distinguished in the person\nof the deposed Queen. But the pertinacity with which she and her female\nattendants refused to see or listen to him, rendered such hope, if he\nnourished it, altogether abortive.\n\nThe opportunity, therefore, of enlarging the religious information of\nRoland Graeme, and bringing him to a more due sense of his duties to\nHeaven, was hailed by the good man as a door opened by Providence\nfor the salvation of a sinner. He dreamed not, indeed, that he was\nconverting a Papist, but such was the ignorance which Roland displayed\nupon some material points of the reformed doctrine, that Master\nHenderson, while praising his docility to the Lady Lochleven and her\ngrandson, seldom failed to add, that his venerable brother, Henry\nWarden, must be now decayed in strength and in mind, since he found a\ncatechumen of his flock so ill-grounded in the principles of his belief.\nFor this, indeed, Roland Graeme thought it was unnecessary to assign the\ntrue reason, which was his having made it a point of honour to forget\nall that Henry Warden taught him, as soon as he was no longer compelled\nto read it over as a lesson acquired by rote. The lessons of his new\ninstructor, if not more impressively delivered, were received by a more\nwilling ear, and a more awakened understanding, and the solitude of\nLochleven Castle was favourable to graver thoughts than the page had\nhitherto entertained. He wavered yet, indeed, as one who was almost\npersuaded; but his attention to the chaplain's instructions procured him\nfavour even with the stern old dame herself; and he was once or twice,\nbut under great precaution, permitted to go to the neighbouring\nvillage of Kinross, situated on the mainland, to execute some ordinary\ncommission of his unfortunate mistress.\n\nFor some time Roland Graeme might be considered as standing neuter\nbetwixt the two parties who inhabited the water-girdled Tower of\nLochleven; but, as he rose in the opinion of the Lady of the Castle and\nher chaplain, he perceived, with great grief, that he lost ground in\nthat of Mary and her female allies.\n\nHe came gradually to be sensible that he was regarded as a spy upon\ntheir discourse, and that, instead of the ease with which they had\nformerly conversed in his presence, without suppressing any of the\nnatural feelings of anger, of sorrow, or mirth, which the chance topic\nof the moment happened to call forth, their talk was now guardedly\nrestricted to the most indifferent subjects, and a studied reserve\nobserved even in their mode of treating these. This obvious want of\nconfidence was accompanied with a correspondent change in their personal\ndemeanor towards the unfortunate page. The Queen, who had at first\ntreated him with marked courtesy, now scarce spoke to him, save\nto convey some necessary command for her service. The Lady Fleming\nrestricted her notice to the most dry and distant expressions of\ncivility, and Catherine Seyton became bitter in her pleasantries, and\nshy, cross, and pettish, in any intercourse they had together. What was\nyet more provoking, he saw, or thought he saw, marks of intelligence\nbetwixt George Douglas and the beautiful Catherine Seyton; and,\nsharpened by jealousy, he wrought himself almost into a certainty, that\nthe looks which they exchanged, conveyed matters of deep and serious\nimport. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo wonder,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he thought, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif, courted by the son of a proud\nand powerful baron, she can no longer spare a word or look to the poor\nfortuneless page.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn a word, Roland Graeme's situation became truly disagreeable, and his\nheart naturally enough rebelled against the injustice of this treatment,\nwhich deprived him of the only comfort which he had received for\nsubmitting to a confinement in other respects irksome. He accused Queen\nMary and Catherine Seyton (for concerning the opinion of Dame Fleming\nhe was indifferent) of inconsistency in being displeased with him on\naccount of the natural consequences of an order of their own. Why did\nthey send him to hear this overpowering preacher? The Abbot Ambrosius,\nhe recollected, understood the weakness of their Popish cause better,\nwhen he enjoined him to repeat within his own mind, _aves_, and\n_credos_, and _paters_, all the while old Henry Warden preached or\nlectured, that so he might secure himself against lending even a\nmomentary ear to his heretical doctrine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I will endure this life no\nlonger,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he to himself, manfully; \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo they suppose I would betray\nmy mistress, because I see cause to doubt of her religion?--that would\nbe a serving, as they say, the devil for God's sake. I will forth into\nthe world--he that serves fair ladies, may at least expect kind looks\nand kind words; and I bear not the mind of a gentleman, to submit to\ncold treatment and suspicion, and a life-long captivity besides. I will\nspeak to George Douglas to-morrow when we go out a-fishing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA sleepless night was spent in agitating this magnanimous resolution,\nand he arose in the morning not perfectly decided in his own mind\nwhether he should abide by it or not. It happened that he was summoned\nby the Queen at an unusual hour, and just as he was about to go out with\nGeorge Douglas. He went to attend her commands in, the garden; but as he\nhad his angling-rod in his hand, the circumstance announced his previous\nintention, and the Queen, turning to the Lady Fleming, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCatherine\nmust devise some other amusement for us, _ma bonnie amie_; our discreet\npage has already made his party for the day's pleasure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI said from the beginning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Lady Fleming, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat your Grace\nought not to rely on being favoured with the company of a youth who has\nso many Huguenot acquaintances, and has the means of amusing himself far\nmore agreeably than with us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine, her animated features reddening with\nmortification, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat his friends would sail away with him for good, and\nbring us in return a page (if such a thing can be found) faithful to his\nQueen and to his religion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne part of your wishes may be granted, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme,\nunable any longer to restrain his sense of the treatment which he\nreceived on all sides; and he was about to add, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI heartily wish you a\ncompanion in my room, if such can be found, who is capable of enduring\nwomen's caprices without going distracted.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Luckily, he recollected the\nremorse which he had felt at having given way to the vivacity of his\ntemper upon a similar occasion; and, closing his lips, imprisoned,\nuntil it died on his tongue, a reproach so misbecoming the presence of\nmajesty.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy do you remain there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas if you were rooted to the\nparterre?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI but attend your Grace's commands,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have none to give you--Begone, sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs he left the garden to go to the boat, he distinctly heard Mary\nupbraid one of her attendants in these words:--\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see to what you have\nexposed us!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis brief scene at once determined Roland Graeme's resolution to quit\nthe castle, if it were possible, and to impart his resolution to George\nDouglas without loss of time. That gentleman, in his usual mood of\nsilence, sate in the stern of the little skiff which they used on\nsuch occasions, trimming his fishing-tackle, and, from time to time,\nindicating by signs to Graeme, who pulled the oars, which way he should\nrow. When they were a furlong or two from the castle, Roland rested\non the oars, and addressed his companion somewhat abruptly,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have\nsomething of importance to say to you, under your pleasure, fair sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe pensive melancholy of Douglas's countenance at once gave way to the\neager, keen, and startled look of one who expects to hear something of\ndeep and alarming import.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am wearied to the very death of this Castle of Lochleven,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued\nRoland.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs that all?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Douglas; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know none of its inhabitants who are\nmuch better pleased with it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, but I am neither a native of the house, nor a prisoner in it, and\nso I may reasonably desire to leave it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou might desire to quit it with equal reason,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Douglas, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif\nyou were both the one and the other.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not only tired of living in Lochleven\nCastle, but I am determined to quit it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is a resolution more easily taken than executed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Douglas.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot if yourself, sir, and your Lady Mother, choose to consent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n answered the page.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou mistake the matter, Roland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Douglas; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou will find that the\nconsent of two other persons is equally essential--that of the Lady Mary\nyour mistress, and that of my uncle the Regent, who placed you about\nher person, and who will not think it proper that she should change her\nattendants so soon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd must I then remain whether I will or no?\u00e2\u0080\u009d demanded the page,\nsomewhat appalled at a view of the subject, which would have occurred\nsooner to a person of more experience.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt least,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George Douglas, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou must will to remain till my uncle\nconsents to dismiss you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFrankly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand speaking to you as a gentleman who is\nincapable of betraying me, I will confess, that if I thought myself a\nprisoner here, neither walls nor water should confine me long.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFrankly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Douglas, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI could not much blame you for the attempt;\nyet, for all that, my father, or uncle, or the earl, or any of my\nbrothers, or in short any of the king's lords into whose hands you fell,\nwould in such a case hang you like a dog, or like a sentinel who deserts\nhis post; and I promise you that you will hardly escape them. But row\ntowards Saint Serf's island--there is a breeze from the west, and we\nshall have sport, keeping to windward of the isle, where the ripple is\nstrongest. We will speak more of what you have mentioned when we have\nhad an hour's sport.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTheir fishing was successful, though never did two anglers pursue even\nthat silent and unsocial pleasure with less of verbal intercourse.\n\nWhen their time was expired, Douglas took the oars in his turn, and by\nhis order Roland Graeme steered the boat, directing her course upon the\nlanding-place at the castle. But he also stopped in the midst of his\ncourse, and, looking around him, said to Graeme, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a thing which\nI could mention to thee; but it is so deep a secret, that even here,\nsurrounded as we are by sea and sky, without the possibility of a\nlistener, I cannot prevail on myself to speak it out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBetter leave it unspoken, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Roland Graeme, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you doubt\nthe honour of him who alone can hear it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI doubt not your honour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied George Douglas; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut you are young,\nimprudent, and changeful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYoung,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am, and it may be imprudent--but who hath\ninformed you that I am changeful?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne that knows you, perhaps, better than you know yourself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied\nDouglas.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose you mean Catherine Seyton,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, his heart rising\nas he spoke; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut she is herself fifty times more variable in her humour\nthan the very water which we are floating upon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy young acquaintance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Douglas, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI pray you to remember that\nCatherine Seyton is a lady of blood and birth, and must not be lightly\nspoken of.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster George of Douglas,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Graeme, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas that speech seemed to\nbe made under the warrant of something like a threat, I pray you to\nobserve, that I value not the threat at the estimation of a fin of one\nof these dead trouts; and, moreover, I would have you to know that the\nchampion who undertakes the defence of every lady of blood and birth,\nwhom men accuse of change of faith and of fashion, is like to have\nenough of work on his hands.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo to,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Seneschal, but in a tone of good-humour, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthou art a\nfoolish boy, unfit to deal with any matter more serious than the casting\nof a net, or the flying of a hawk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf your secret concern Catherine Seyton,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI care not\nfor it, and so you may tell her if you will. I wot she can shape you\nopportunity to speak with her, as she has ere now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe flush which passed over Douglas's face, made the page aware that he\nhad alighted on a truth, when he was, in fact, speaking at random; and\nthe feeling that he had done so, was like striking a dagger into his\nown heart. His companion, without farther answer, resumed the oars,\nand pulled lustily till they arrived at the island and the castle.\nThe servants received the produce of their spoil, and the two fishers,\nturning from each other in silence, went each to his several apartment.\n\nRoland Graeme had spent about an hour in grumbling against Catherine\nSeyton, the Queen, the Regent, and the whole house of Lochleven, with\nGeorge Douglas at the head of it, when the time approached that his duty\ncalled him to attend the meal of Queen Mary. As he arranged his dress\nfor this purpose, he grudged the trouble, which, on similar occasions,\nhe used, with boyish foppery, to consider as one of the most important\nduties of his day; and when he went to take his place behind the chair\nof the Queen, it was with an air of offended dignity, which could not\nescape her observation, and probably appeared to her ridiculous enough,\nfor she whispered something in French to her ladies, at which the\nlady Fleming laughed, and Catherine appeared half diverted and half\ndisconcerted. This pleasantry, of which the subject was concealed from\nhim, the unfortunate page received, of course, as a new offence, and\ncalled an additional degree of sullen dignity into his mien, which might\nhave exposed him to farther raillery, but that Mary appeared disposed to\nmake allowance for and compassionate his feelings.\n\nWith the peculiar tact and delicacy which no woman possessed in greater\nperfection, she began to soothe by degrees the vexed spirit of her\nmagnanimous attendant. The excellence of the fish which he had taken in\nhis expedition, the high flavour and beautiful red colour of the trouts,\nwhich have long given distinction to the lake, led her first to express\nher thanks to her attendant for so agreeable an addition to her table,\nespecially upon a _jour de jeune_; and then brought on inquiries\ninto the place where the fish had been taken, their size, their\npeculiarities, the times when they were in season, and a comparison\nbetween the Lochleven trouts and those which are found in the lakes and\nrivers of the south of Scotland. The ill humour of Roland Graeme was\nnever of an obstinate character. It rolled away like mist before the\nsun, and he was easily engaged in a keen and animated dissertation about\nLochleven trout, and sea trout, and river trout, and bull trout, and\nchar, which never rise to a fly, and par, which some suppose infant\nsalmon, and _herlings_, which frequent the Nith, and _vendisses_, which\nare only found in the Castle-Loch of Lochmaben; and he was hurrying on\nwith the eager impetuosity and enthusiasm of a young sportsman, when he\nobserved that the smile with which the Queen at first listened to him\ndied languidly away, and that, in spite of her efforts to suppress them,\ntears rose to her eyes. He stopped suddenly short, and, distressed\nin his turn, asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf he had the misfortune unwittingly to give\ndispleasure to her Grace?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, my poor boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Queen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut as you numbered up the lakes\nand rivers of my kingdom, imagination cheated me, as it will do, and\nsnatched me from these dreary walls away to the romantic streams of\nNithsdale, and the royal towers of Lochmaben.--O land, which my fathers\nhave so long ruled! of the pleasures which you extend so freely, your\nQueen is now deprived, and the poorest beggar, who may wander free from\none landward town to another, would scorn to change fates with Mary of\nScotland!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour highness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady Fleming, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill do well to withdraw.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome with me, then, Fleming,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would not burden\nhearts so young as these are, with the sight of my sorrows.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe accompanied these words with a look of melancholy compassion towards\nRoland and Catherine, who were now left alone together in the apartment.\n\nThe page found his situation not a little embarrassing; for, as every\nreader has experienced who may have chanced to be in such a situation,\nit is extremely difficult to maintain the full dignity of an offended\nperson in the presence of a beautiful girl, whatever reason we may have\nfor being angry with her. Catherine Seyton, on her part, sate still\nlike a lingering ghost, which, conscious of the awe which its presence\nimposes, is charitably disposed to give the poor confused mortal whom\nit visits, time to recover his senses, and comply with the grand rule of\ndemonology by speaking first. But as Roland seemed in no hurry to avail\nhimself of her condescension, she carried it a step farther, and herself\nopened the conversation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI pray you, fair sir, if it may be permitted me to disturb your august\nreverie by a question so simple,--what may have become of your rosary?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is lost, madam--lost some time since,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, partly\nembarrassed and partly indignant.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd may I ask farther, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy you have not replaced\nit with another?--I have half a mind,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, taking from her pocket\na string of ebony beads adorned with gold, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto bestow one upon you, to\nkeep for my sake, just to remind you of former acquaintance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was a little tremulous accent in the tone with which these words\nwere delivered, which at once put to flight Roland Graeme's resentment,\nand brought him to Catherine's side; but she instantly resumed the bold\nand firm accent which was more familiar to her. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI did not bid you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccome and sit so close by me; for the acquaintance that I spoke\nof, has been stiff and cold, dead and buried, for this many a day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow Heaven forbid!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit has only slept, and now that you\ndesire it should awake, fair Catherine, believe me that a pledge of your\nreturning favour--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, nay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine, withholding the rosary, towards which, as\nhe spoke, he extended his hand, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have changed my mind on better\nreflection. What should a heretic do with these holy beads, that have\nbeen blessed by the father of the church himself?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland winced grievously, for he saw plainly which way the discourse was\nnow likely to tend, and felt that it must at all events be embarrassing.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, but,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit was as a token of your own regard that you\noffered them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, fair sir, but that regard attended the faithful subject, the loyal\nand pious Catholic, the individual who was so solemnly devoted at\nthe same time with myself to the same grand duty; which, you must now\nunderstand, was to serve the church and Queen. To such a person, if you\never heard of him, was my regard due, and not to him who associates with\nheretics, and is about to become a renegado.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should scarce believe, fair mistress,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, indignantly,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat the vane of your favour turned only to a Catholic wind,\nconsidering that it points so plainly to George Douglas, who, I think,\nis both kingsman and Protestant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThink better of George Douglas,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthan to believe--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n and then checking herself, as if she had spoken too much, she went on,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI assure you, fair Master Roland, that all who wish you well are sorry\nfor you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTheir number is very few, I believe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand their\nsorrow, if they feel any, not deeper than ten minutes' time will cure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are more numerous, and think more deeply concerning you, than\nyou seem to be aware,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Catherine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut perhaps they think\nwrong--You are the best judge in your own affairs; and if you prefer\ngold and church-lands to honour and loyalty, and the faith of your\nfathers, why should you be hampered in conscience more than others?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMay Heaven bear witness for me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat if I entertain\nany difference of opinion--that is, if I nourish any doubts in point of\nreligion, they have been adopted on the conviction of my own mind, and\nthe suggestion of my own conscience!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay, your conscience--your conscience!\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeated she with satiric\nemphasis; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour conscience is the scape-goat; I warrant it an able\none--it will bear the burden of one of the best manors of the Abbey of\nSaint Mary of Kennaquhair, lately forfeited to our noble Lord the King,\nby the Abbot and community thereof, for the high crime of fidelity\nto their religious vows, and now to be granted by the High and Mighty\nTraitor, and so forth, James Earl of Murray, to the good squire of dames\nRoland Graeme, for his loyal and faithful service as under-espial, and\ndeputy-turnkey, for securing the person of his lawful sovereign, Queen\nMary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou misconstrue me cruelly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyes, Catherine, most\ncruelly--God knows I would protect this poor lady at the risk of my\nlife, or with my life; but what can I do--what can any one do for her?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMuch may be done--enough may be done--all may be done--if men will be\nbut true and honourable, as Scottish men were in the days of Bruce and\nWallace. Oh, Roland, from what an enterprise you are now withdrawing\nyour heart and hand, through mere fickleness and coldness of spirit!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow can I withdraw,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfrom an enterprise which has never\nbeen communicated to me?--Has the Queen, or have you, or has any\none, communicated with me upon any thing for her service which I have\nrefused? Or have you not, all of you, held me at such distance from\nyour counsels, as if I were the most faithless spy since the days\nof Ganelon?\u00e2\u0080\u009d [Footnote: Gan, Gano, or Ganelon of Mayence, is in\nthe Romances on the subject of Charlemagne and his Paladins, always\nrepresented as the traitor by whom the Christian champions are\nbetrayed.]\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd who,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine Seyton, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould trust the sworn friend, and\npupil, and companion, of the heretic preacher Henderson? ay--a proper\ntutor you have chosen, instead of the excellent Ambrosius, who is now\nturned out of house and homestead, if indeed he is not languishing in\na dungeon, for withstanding the tyranny of Morton, to whose brother the\ntemporalities of that noble house of God have been gifted away by the\nRegent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it possible?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand is the excellent Father Ambrose in\nsuch distress?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe would account the news of your falling away from the faith of your\nfathers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Catherine, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca worse mishap than aught that tyranny\ncan inflict on himself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut why,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, very much moved, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy should you suppose\nthat--that--that it is with me as you say?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you yourself deny it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Catherine; \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo you not admit that you\nhave drunk the poison which you should have dashed from your lips?--Do\nyou deny that it now ferments in your veins, if it has not altogether\ncorrupted the springs of life?--Do you deny that you have your doubts,\nas you proudly term them, respecting what popes and councils have\ndeclared it unlawful to doubt of?--Is not your faith wavering, if not\noverthrown?--Does not the heretic preacher boast his conquest?--Does\nnot the heretic woman of this prison-house hold up thy example to\nothers?--Do not the Queen and the Lady Fleming believe in thy falling\naway?--And is there any except one--yes, I will speak it out, and think\nas lightly as you please of my good-will--is there one except myself\nthat holds even a lingering hope that you may yet prove what we once all\nbelieved of you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said our poor page, much embarrassed by the view which was\nthus presented to him of the conduct he was expected to pursue, and by\na person in whom he was not the less interested that, though long a\nresident in Lochleven Castle, with no object so likely to attract his\nundivided attention, no lengthened interview had taken place since they\nhad first met,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know not what you expect of me, or fear from me. I\nwas sent hither to attend Queen Mary, and to her I acknowledge the duty\nof a servant through life and death. If any one had expected service\nof another kind, I was not the party to render it. I neither avow\nnor disclaim the doctrines of the reformed church.--Will you have the\ntruth?--It seems to me that the profligacy of the Catholic clergy has\nbrought this judgment on their own heads, and, for aught I know, it may\nbe for their reformation. But, for betraying this unhappy Queen, God\nknows I am guiltless of the thought. Did I even believe worse of her,\nthan as her servant I wish--as her subject I dare to do--I would not\nbetray her--far from it--I would aid her in aught which could tend to a\nfair trial of her cause.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEnough! enough!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Catherine, clasping her hands together; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthen\nthou wilt not desert us if any means are presented, by which, placing\nour Royal Mistress at freedom, this case may be honestly tried betwixt\nher and her rebellious subjects?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay--but, fair Catherine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009chear but what the Lord of\nMurray said when he sent me hither.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHear but what the devil said,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the maiden, \u00e2\u0080\u009crather than what\na false subject, a false brother, a false counsellor, a false friend,\nsaid! A man raised from a petty pensioner on the crown's bounty, to be\nthe counsellor of majesty, and the prime distributor of the bounties of\nthe state;--one with whom rank, fortune, title, consequence, and power,\nall grew up like a mushroom, by the mere warm good-will of the sister,\nwhom, in requital, he hath mewed up in this place of melancholy\nseclusion--whom, in farther requital, he has deposed, and whom, if he\ndared, he would murder!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think not so ill of the Earl of Murray,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand\nsooth to speak,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, with a smile, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit would require some bribe to\nmake me embrace, with firm and desperate resolution, either one side or\nthe other.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, if that is all,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Catherine Seyton, in a tone of\nenthusiasm, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou shall be guerdoned with prayers from oppressed\nsubjects--from dispossessed clergy--from insulted nobles--with immortal\npraise by future ages--with eager gratitude by the present--with fame\non earth, and with felicity in heaven! Your country will thank you--your\nQueen will be debtor to you--you will achieve at once the highest from\nthe lowest degree in chivalry--all men will honour, all women will\nlove you--and I, sworn with you so early to the accomplishment of Queen\nMary's freedom, will--yes, I will--love you better than--ever sister\nloved brother!\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cSay on--say on!\u00e2\u0080\u009d whispered Roland, kneeling on\none knee, and taking her hand, which, in the warmth of exhortation,\nCatherine held towards him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, pausing, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have already said too much--far too much,\nif I prevail not with you--far too little if I do. But I prevail,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n she continued, seeing that the countenance of the youth she addressed\nreturned the enthusiasm of her own--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI prevail; or rather the good cause\nprevails through its own strength--thus I devote thee to it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And as\nshe spoke she approached her finger to the brow of the astonished youth,\nand, without touching it, signed the cross over his forehead--stooped\nher face towards him, and seemed to kiss the empty space in which she\nhad traced the symbol; then starting up, and extricating herself from\nhis grasp, darted into the Queen's apartment.\n\nRoland Graeme remained as the enthusiastic maiden had left him, kneeling\non one knee, with breath withheld, and with eyes fixed upon the space\nwhich the fairy form of Catherine Seyton had so lately occupied. If\nhis thoughts were not of unmixed delight, they at least partook of that\nthrilling and intoxicating, though mingled sense of pain and pleasure,\nthe most over-powering which life offers in its blended cup. He rose and\nretired slowly; and although the chaplain Mr. Henderson preached on that\nevening his best sermon against the errors of Popery, I would not engage\nthat he was followed accurately through the train of his reasoning\nby the young proselyte, with a view to whose especial benefit he had\nhandled the subject.\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Twenty-Fifth.\n\n\n  And when love's torch hath set the heart in flame,\n  Comes Seignor Reason, with his saws and cautions,\n  Giving such aid as the old gray-beard Sexton,\n  Who from the church-vault drags the crazy engine,\n  To ply its dribbling ineffectual streamlet\n  Against a conflagration.\n                                OLD PLAY.\n\nIn a musing mood, Roland Graeme upon the ensuing morning betook himself\nto the battlements of the Castle, as a spot where he might indulge the\ncourse of his thick-coming fancies with least chance of interruption.\nBut his place of retirement was in the present case ill chosen, for he\nwas presently joined by Mr. Elias Henderson.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI sought you, young man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the preacher, \u00e2\u0080\u009chaving to speak of\nsomething which concerns you nearly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe page had no pretence for avoiding the conference which the chaplain\nthus offered, though he felt that it might prove an embarrassing one.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn teaching thee, as far as my feeble knowledge hath permitted, thy\nduty towards God,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the chaplain, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere are particulars of your\nduty towards man, upon which I was unwilling long or much to insist.\nYou are here in the service of a lady, honourable as touching her birth,\ndeserving of all compassion as respects her misfortunes, and garnished\nwith even but too many of those outward qualities which win men's regard\nand affection. Have you ever considered your regard to this Lady Mary of\nScotland, in its true light and bearing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI trust, reverend sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Roland Graeme, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I am well aware\nof the duties a servant in my condition owes to his royal mistress,\nespecially in her lowly and distressed condition.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the preacher; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut it is even that honest feeling\nwhich may, in the Lady Mary's case, carry thee into great crime and\ntreachery.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow so, reverend sir?\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the page; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI profess I understand you\nnot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI speak to you not of the crimes of this ill-advised lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\npreacher; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey are not subjects for the ears of her sworn servant. But\nit is enough to say, that this unhappy person hath rejected more offers\nof grace, and more hopes of glory, than ever were held out to\nearthly princes; and that she is now, her day of favour being passed,\nsequestered in this lonely castle, for the common weal of the people of\nScotland, and it may be for the benefit of her own soul.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cReverend sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, somewhat impatiently, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am but too well\naware that my unfortunate mistress is imprisoned, since I have the\nmisfortune to share in her restraint myself--of which, to speak sooth, I\nam heartily weary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is even of that which I am about to speak,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the chaplain,\nmildly; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut, first, my good Roland, look forth on the pleasant prospect\nof yonder cultivated plain. You see, where the smoke arises, yonder\nvillage standing half hidden by the trees, and you know it to be the\ndwelling-place of peace and industry. From space to space, each by the\nside of its own stream, you see the gray towers of barons, with cottages\ninterspersed; and you know that they also, with their household, are now\nliving in unity; the lance hung upon the wall, and the sword resting\nin its sheath. You see, too, more than one fair church, where the pure\nwaters of life are offered to the thirsty, and where the hungry are\nrefreshed with spiritual food.--What would he deserve, who should bring\nfire and slaughter into so fair and happy a scene--who should bare the\nswords of the gentry and turn them against each other--who should give\ntower and cottage to the flames, and slake the embers with the blood\nof the indwellers?--What would he deserve who should lift up again that\nancient Dagon of Superstition, whom the worthies of the time have beaten\ndown, and who should once more make the churches of God the high places\nof Baal?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have limned a frightful picture, reverend sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cyet I guess not whom you would charge with the purpose of effecting a\nchange so horrible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGod forbid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the preacher, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I should say to thee, Thou art\nthe man.--Yet beware, Roland Graeme, that thou, in serving thy mistress,\nhold fast the still higher service which thou owest to the peace of thy\ncountry, and the prosperity of her inhabitants; else, Roland Graeme,\nthou mayest be the very man upon whose head will fall the curses and\nassured punishment due to such work. If thou art won by the song of\nthese sirens to aid that unhappy lady's escape from this place of\npenitence and security, it is over with the peace of Scotland's\ncottages, and with the prosperity of her palaces--and the babe unborn\nshall curse the name of the man who gave inlet to the disorder which\nwill follow the war betwixt the mother and the son.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know of no such plan, reverend sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand\ntherefore can aid none such.--My duty towards the Queen has been\nsimply that of an attendant; it is a task, of which, at times, I would\nwillingly have been freed; nevertheless--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is to prepare thee for the enjoyment of something more of liberty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said the preacher, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I have endeavoured to impress upon you the\ndeep responsibility under which your office must be discharged. George\nDouglas hath told the Lady Lochleven that you are weary of this service,\nand my intercession hath partly determined her good ladyship, that, as\nyour discharge cannot be granted, you shall, instead, be employed in\ncertain commissions on the mainland, which have hitherto been discharged\nby other persons of confidence. Wherefore, come with me to the lady, for\neven to-day such duty will be imposed on you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI trust you will hold me excused, reverend sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, who\nfelt that an increase of confidence on the part of the Lady of the\nCastle and her family would render his situation in a moral view doubly\nembarrassing, \u00e2\u0080\u009cone cannot serve two masters--and I much fear that my\nmistress will not hold me excused for taking employment under another.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFear not that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the preacher; \u00e2\u0080\u009cher consent shall be asked and\nobtained. I fear she will yield it but too easily, as hoping to avail\nherself of your agency to maintain correspondence with her friends, as\nthose falsely call themselves, who would make her name the watchword for\ncivil war.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd thus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall be exposed to suspicion on all\nsides; for my mistress will consider me as a spy placed on her by her\nenemies, seeing me so far trusted by them; and the Lady Lochleven will\nnever cease to suspect the possibility of my betraying her, because\ncircumstances put it into my power to do so--I would rather remain as I\nam.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere followed a pause of one or two minutes, during which Henderson\nlooked steadily in Roland's countenance, as if desirous to ascertain\nwhether there was not more in the answer than the precise words seemed\nto imply. He failed in this point, however; for Roland, bred a page from\nchildhood, knew how to assume a sullen pettish cast of countenance, well\nenough calculated to hide all internal emotions.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI understand thee not, Roland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the preacher, \u00e2\u0080\u009cor rather thou\nthinkest on this matter more deeply than I apprehended to be in thy\nnature. Methought, the delight of going on shore with thy bow, or thy\ngun, or thy angling-rod, would have borne away all other feelings.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd so it would,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Roland, who perceived the danger of suffering\nHenderson's half-raised suspicions to become fully awake,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would have\nthought of nothing but the gun and the oar, and the wild water-fowl that\ntempt me by sailing among the sedges yonder so far out of flight-shot,\nhad you not spoken of my going on shore as what was to occasion burning\nof town and tower, the downfall of the evangele, and the upsetting of\nthe mass.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFollow me, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Henderson, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand we will seek the Lady\nLochleven.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey found her at breakfast with her grandson George Douglas.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cPeace be\nwith your ladyship!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the preacher, bowing to his patroness; \u00e2\u0080\u009cRoland\nGraeme awaits your order.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYoung man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cour chaplain hath warranted for thy\nfidelity, and we are determined to give you certain errands to do for us\nin our town of Kinross.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot by my advice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Douglas, coldly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI said not that it was,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the lady, something sharply. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe\nmother of thy father may, I should think, be old enough to judge for\nherself in a matter so simple.--Thou wilt take the skiff, Roland, and\ntwo of my people, whom Dryfesdale or Randal will order out, and fetch\noff certain stuff of plate and hangings, which should last night be\nlodged at Kinross by the wains from Edinburgh.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd give this packet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George Douglas, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto a servant of ours,\nwhom you will find in waiting there.--It is the report to my father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n he added, looking towards his grandmother, who acquiesced by bending her\nhead.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have already mentioned to Master Henderson,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat as my duty requires my attendance on the Queen, her Grace's\npermission for my journey ought to be obtained before I can undertake\nyour commission.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook to it, my son,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the old lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe scruple of the youth is\nhonourable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCraving your pardon, madam, I have no wish to force myself on her\npresence thus early,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said. Douglas, in an indifferent tone; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit might\ndisplease her, and were no way agreeable to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady Lochleven, \u00e2\u0080\u009calthough her temper hath been more\ngentle of late, have no will to undergo, without necessity, the rancour\nof her wit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnder your permission, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the chaplain, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will myself render\nyour request to the Queen. During my long residence in this house she\nhath not deigned to see me in private, or to hear my doctrine; yet so\nmay Heaven prosper my labours, as love for her soul, and desire to bring\nher into the right path, was my chief desire for coming hither.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTake care, Master Henderson,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Douglas, in a tone which seemed\nalmost sarcastic, \u00e2\u0080\u009clest you rush hastily on an adventure to which you\nhave no vocation--you are learned, and know the adage, _Ne accesseris in\nconsilium nisi vocatus_.--Who hath required this at your hand?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Master to whose service I am called,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the preacher,\nlooking upward,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe who hath commanded me to be earnest in season and\nout of season.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour acquaintance hath not been much, I think, with courts or princes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n continued the young Esquire.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Henderson, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut like my Master Knox, I see nothing\nfrightful in the fair face of a pretty lady.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy son,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady of Lochleven, \u00e2\u0080\u009cquench not the good man's\nzeal--let him do the errand to this unhappy Princess.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith more willingness than I would do it myself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George Douglas.\nYet something in his manner appeared to contradict his words.\n\nThe minister went accordingly, followed by Roland Graeme, and, demanding\nan audience of the imprisoned Princess, was admitted. He found her with\nher ladies engaged in the daily task of embroidery. The Queen received\nhim with that courtesy, which, in ordinary cases, she used towards all\nwho approached her, and the clergyman, in opening his commission, was\nobviously somewhat more embarrassed than he had expected to be.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe\ngood Lady of Lochleven--may it please your Grace--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe made a short pause, during which Mary said, with a smile, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy Grace\nwould, in truth, be well pleased, were the Lady Lochleven our _good_\nlady--But go on--what is the will of the good Lady of Lochleven?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe desires, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the chaplain, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat your Grace will permit\nthis young gentleman, your page, Roland Graeme, to pass to Kinross, to\nlook after some household stuff and hangings, sent hither for the better\nfurnishing your Grace's apartments.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Lady of Lochleven,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cuses needless ceremony, in\nrequesting our permission for that which stands within her own pleasure.\nWe well know that this young gentleman's attendance on us had not been\nso long permitted, were he not thought to be more at the command of that\ngood lady than at ours.--But we cheerfully yield consent that he shall\ngo on her errand--with our will we would doom no living creature to the\ncaptivity which we ourselves must suffer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the preacher, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand it is doubtless natural for\nhumanity to quarrel with its prison-house. Yet there have been those,\nwho have found, that time spent in the house of temporal captivity may\nbe so employed as to redeem us from spiritual slavery.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI apprehend your meaning, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I have heard\nyour apostle--I have heard Master John Knox; and were I to be perverted,\nI would willingly resign to the ablest and most powerful of heresiarchs,\nthe poor honour he might acquire by overcoming my faith and my hope.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the preacher, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is not to the talents or skill of the\nhusbandman that God gives the increase--the words which were offered\nin vain by him whom you justly call our apostle, during the bustle and\ngaiety of a court, may yet find better acceptance during the leisure for\nreflection which this place affords. God knows, lady, that I speak in\nsingleness of heart, as one who would as soon compare himself to the\nimmortal angels, as to the holy man whom you have named. Yet would you\nbut condescend to apply to their noblest use, those talents and that\nlearning which all allow you to be possessed of--would you afford us\nbut the slightest hope that you would hear and regard what can be urged\nagainst the blinded superstition and idolatry in which you are brought\nup, sure am I, that the most powerfully-gifted of my brethren, that even\nJohn Knox himself, would hasten hither, and account the rescue of your\nsingle soul from the nets of Romish error--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am obliged to you and to them for their charity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mary; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut as\nI have at present but one presence-chamber, I would reluctantly see it\nconverted into a Huguenot synod.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt least, madam, be not thus obstinately blinded in your errors! Hear\none who has hungered and thirsted, watched and prayed, to undertake\nthe good work of your conversion, and who would be content to die the\ninstant that a work so advantageous for yourself and so beneficial to\nScotland were accomplished--Yes, lady, could I but shake the remaining\npillar of the heathen temple in this land--and that permit me to\nterm your faith in the delusions of Rome--I could be content to die\noverwhelmed in the ruins!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not insult your zeal, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Mary, \u00e2\u0080\u009cby saying you\nare more likely to make sport for the Philistines than to overwhelm\nthem--your charity claims my thanks, for it is warmly expressed and may\nbe truly purposed--But believe as well of me as I am willing to do of\nyou, and think that I may be as anxious to recall you to the ancient and\nonly road, as you are to teach me your new by-ways to paradise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen, madam, if such be your generous purpose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Henderson,\neagerly, \u00e2\u0080\u009c--what hinders that we should dedicate some part of that time,\nunhappily now too much at your Grace's disposal, to discuss a question\nso weighty? You, by report of all men, are both learned and witty; and\nI, though without such advantages, am strong in my cause as in a tower\nof defence. Why should we not spend some space in endeavouring to\ndiscover which of us hath the wrong side in this important matter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Queen Mary, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI never alleged my force was strong enough\nto accept of a combat _en champ clos_, with a scholar and a polemic.\nBesides, the match is not equal. You, sir, might retire when you felt\nthe battle go against you, while I am tied to the stake, and have no\npermission to say the debate wearies me.--I would be alone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe curtsied low to him as she uttered these words; and Henderson, whose\nzeal was indeed ardent, but did not extend to the neglect of delicacy,\nbowed in return, and prepared to withdraw.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat my earnest wish, my most zealous prayer, could\nprocure to your Grace any blessing or comfort, but especially that\nin which alone blessing or comfort is, as easily as the slightest\nintimation of your wish will remove me from your presence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe was in the act of departing, when Mary said to him with much\ncourtesy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo me no injury in your thoughts, good sir; it may be, that\nif my time here be protracted longer--as surely I hope it will not,\ntrusting that either my rebel subjects will repent of their disloyalty,\nor that my faithful lieges will obtain the upper hand--but if my time\nbe here protracted, it may be I shall have no displeasure in hearing one\nwho seems so reasonable and compassionate as yourself, and I may hazard\nyour contempt by endeavouring to recollect and repeat the reasons which\nschoolmen and councils give for the faith that is in me,--although\nI fear that, God help me! my Latin has deserted me with my other\npossessions. This must, however, be for another day. Meanwhile, sir,\nlet the Lady of Lochleven employ my page as she lists--I will not afford\nsuspicion by speaking a word to him before he goes.--Roland Graeme, my\nfriend, lose not an opportunity of amusing thyself--dance, sing, run,\nand leap--all may be done merrily on the mainland; but he must have more\nthan quicksilver in his veins who would frolic here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas! madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the preacher, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto what is it you exhort the youth,\nwhile time passes, and eternity summons? Can our salvation be insured by\nidle mirth, or our good work wrought out without fear and trembling?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot fear or tremble,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Queen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cto Mary Stewart such\nemotions are unknown. But if weeping and sorrow on my part will atone\nfor the boy's enjoying an hour of boyish pleasure, be assured the\npenance shall be duly paid.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, but, gracious lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the preacher, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin this you greatly\nerr;--our tears and our sorrows are all too little for our own faults\nand follies, nor can we transfer them, as your church falsely teaches,\nto the benefit of others.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMay I pray you, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwith as little offence as\nsuch a prayer may import, to transfer yourself elsewhere? We are sick at\nheart, and may not now be disposed with farther controversy--and thou,\nRoland, take this little purse;\u00e2\u0080\u009d (then, turning to the divine, she said,\nshowing its contents,) \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook, reverend sir,--it contains only these\ntwo or three gold testoons, a coin which, though bearing my own poor\nfeatures, I have ever found more active against me than on my side, just\nas my subjects take arms against me, with my own name for their\nsummons and signal.--Take this purse, that thou mayest want no means of\namusement. Fail not--fail not to bring met back news from Kinross; only\nlet it be such as, without suspicion or offence, may be told in the\npresence of this reverend gentleman, or of the good Lady Lochleven\nherself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe last hint was too irresistible to be withstood; and Henderson\nwithdrew, half mortified, half pleased, with his reception; for Mary,\nfrom long habit, and the address which was natural to her, had learned,\nin an extraordinary degree, the art of evading discourse which was\ndisagreeable to her feelings or prejudices, without affronting those by\nwhom it was proffered.\n\nRoland Graeme retired with the chaplain, at a signal from his lady; but\nit did not escape him, that as he left the room, stepping backwards, and\nmaking the deep obeisance due to royalty, Catherine Seyton held up her\nslender forefinger, with a gesture which he alone could witness, and\nwhich seemed to say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRemember what has passed betwixt us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe young page had now his last charge from the Lady of Lochleven.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are revels,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis day at the village--my son's\nauthority is, as yet, unable to prevent these continued workings of the\nancient leaven of folly which the Romish priests have kneaded into the\nvery souls of the Scottish peasantry. I do not command thee to abstain\nfrom them--that would be only to lay a snare for thy folly, or to teach\nthee falsehood; but enjoy these vanities with moderation, and mark\nthem as something thou must soon learn to renounce and contemn. Our\nchamberlain at Kinross, Luke Lundin,--Doctor, as he foolishly calleth\nhimself,--will acquaint thee what is to be done in the matter about\nwhich thou goest. Remember thou art trusted--show thyself, therefore,\nworthy of trust.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen we recollect that Roland Graeme was not yet nineteen, and that he\nhad spent his whole life in the solitary Castle of Avenel, excepting\nthe few hours he had passed in Edinburgh, and his late residence at\nLochleven, (the latter period having very little served to enlarge his\nacquaintance with the gay world.) we cannot wonder that his heart beat,\nhigh with hope and curiosity, at the prospect of partaking the sport\neven of a country wake. He hastened to his little cabin, and turned over\nthe wardrobe with which (in every respect becoming his station) he had\nbeen supplied from Edinburgh, probably by order of the Earl of Murray.\nBy the Queen's command he had hitherto waited upon her in mourning, or\nat least in sad-coloured raiment. Her condition, she said, admitted\nof nothing more gay. But now he selected the gayest dress his wardrobe\nafforded; composed of scarlet slashed with black satin, the royal\ncolours of Scotland--combed his long curled hair--disposed his chain and\nmedal round a beaver hat of the newest block; and with the gay falchion\nwhich had reached him in so mysterious a manner, hung by his side in\nan embroidered belt, his apparel, added to his natural frank mien and\nhandsome figure, formed a most commendable and pleasing specimen of the\nyoung gallant of the period. He sought to make his parting reverence to\nthe Queen and her ladies, but old Dryfesdale hurried him to the boat.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will have no private audiences,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy master; since you are\nto be trusted with somewhat, we will try at least to save thee from\nthe temptation of opportunity. God help thee, child,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, with a\nglance of contempt at his gay clothes, \u00e2\u0080\u009can the bear-ward be yonder from\nSaint Andrews, have a care thou go not near him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd wherefore, I pray you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLest he take thee for one of his runaway jackanapes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the\nsteward, smiling sourly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wear not my clothes at thy cost,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland indignantly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNor at thine own either, my son\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the steward, \u00e2\u0080\u009celse would thy\ngarb more nearly resemble thy merit and thy station.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland Graeme suppressed with difficulty the repartee which arose to his\nlips, and, wrapping his scarlet mantle around him, threw himself into\nthe boat, which two rowers, themselves urged by curiosity to see the\nrevels, pulled stoutly towards the west end of the lake. As they put\noff, Roland thought he could discover the face of Catherine Seyton,\nthough carefully withdrawn from observation, peeping from a loophole\nto view his departure. He pulled off his hat, and held it up as a token\nthat he saw and wished her adieu. A white kerchief waved for a second\nacross the window, and for the rest of the little voyage, the thoughts\nof Catherine Seyton disputed ground in his breast with the expectations\nexcited by the approaching revel. As they drew nearer and nearer the\nshore, the sounds of mirth and music, the laugh, the halloo, and the\nshout, came thicker upon the ear, and in a trice the boat was moored,\nand Roland Graeme hastened in quest of the chamberlain, that, being\ninformed what time he had at his own disposal, he might lay it out to\nthe best advantage.\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Twenty-Sixth.\n\n\n  Room for the master of the ring, ye swains,\n  Divide your crowded ranks--before him march\n  The rural minstrelsy, the rattling drum,\n  The clamorous war-pipe, and far-echoing horn.\n               _Rural Sports_.--SOMERVILLE.\n\nNo long space intervened ere Roland Graeme was able to discover among\nthe crowd of revellers, who gambolled upon the open space which extends\nbetwixt the village and the lake, a person of so great importance as Dr.\nLuke Lundin, upon whom devolved officially the charge of representing\nthe lord of the land, and who was attended for support of his authority\nby a piper, a drummer, and four sturdy clowns armed with rusty halberds,\ngarnished with party-coloured ribbons; myrmidons who, early as the day\nwas, had already broken more than one head in the awful names of the\nLaird of Lochleven and his chamberlain.\n\n[Footnote: At Scottish fairs, the bailie, or magistrate, deputed by the\nlord in whose name the meeting is held, attends the fair with his\nguard, decides trifling disputes, and punishes on the spot any petty\ndelinquencies. His attendants are usually armed with halberds, and\nsometimes, at least, escorted by music. Thus, in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cLife and Death of\nHabbie Simpson,\u00e2\u0080\u009d we are told of that famous minstrel,--\n\n   \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt fairs he play'd before the spear-men,\n   And gaily graithed in their gear-men;--\n   Steel bonnets, jacks, and swords shone clear then,\n        Like ony bead;\n   Now wha shall play before sic weir-men,\n        Since Habbie's dead! ]\n\nAs soon as this dignitary was informed that the castle skiff had\narrived, with a gallant, dressed like a lord's son at the least, who\ndesired presently to speak to him, he adjusted his ruff and his black\ncoat, turned round his girdle till the garnished hilt of his long rapier\nbecame visible, and walked with due solemnity towards the beach. Solemn\nindeed he was entitled to be, even on less important occasions, for he\nhad been bred to the venerable study of medicine, as those acquainted\nwith the science very soon discovered from the aphorisms which\nornamented his discourse. His success had not been equal to his\npretensions; but as he was a native of the neighbouring kingdom of Fife,\nand bore distant relation to, or dependence upon, the ancient family of\nLundin of that Ilk, who were bound in close friendship with the house\nof Lochleven, he had, through their interest, got planted comfortably\nenough in his present station upon the banks of that beautiful lake.\nThe profits of his chamberlainship being moderate, especially in those\nunsettled times, he had eked it out a little with some practice in his\noriginal profession; and it was said that the inhabitants of the village\nand barony of Kinross were not more effectually thirled (which may\nbe translated enthralled) to the baron's mill, than they were to the\nmedical monopoly of the chamberlain. Wo betide the family of the rich\nboor, who presumed to depart this life without a passport from Dr. Luke\nLundin! for if his representatives had aught to settle with the baron,\nas it seldom happened otherwise, they were sure to find a cold friend\nin the chamberlain. He was considerate enough, however, gratuitously\nto help the poor out of their ailments, and sometimes out of all their\nother distresses at the same time.\n\nFormal, in a double proportion, both as a physician and as a person in\noffice, and proud of the scraps of learning which rendered his language\nalmost universally unintelligible, Dr. Luke Lundin approached the beach,\nand hailed the page as he advanced towards him.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe freshness of the\nmorning upon you, fair sir--You are sent, I warrant me, to see if we\nobserve here the regimen which her good ladyship hath prescribed, for\neschewing all superstitious observances and idle anilities in these\nour revels. I am aware that her good ladyship would willingly have\naltogether abolished and abrogated them--But as I had the honour to\nquote to her from the works of the learned Hercules of Saxony, _omnis\ncuratio est vel canonica vel coacta_,--that is, fair sir, (for silk and\nvelvet have seldom their Latin _ad unguem_,) every cure must be wrought\neither by art and induction of rule, or by constraint; and the wise\nphysician chooseth the former. Which argument her ladyship being pleased\nto allow well of, I have made it my business so to blend instruction and\ncaution with delight--_fiat mixtio_, as we say--that I can answer\nthat the vulgar mind will be defecated and purged of anile and Popish\nfooleries by the medicament adhibited, so that the _primae vice_ being\ncleansed, Master Henderson, or any other able pastor, may at will throw\nin tonics, and effectuate a perfect moral cure, _tuto, cito, jucunde_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no charge, Dr. Lundin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the page--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCall me not doctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the chamberlain, \u00e2\u0080\u009csince I have laid aside\nmy furred gown and bonnet, and retired me into this temporality of\nchamberlainship.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, who was no stranger by report to the character\nof this original, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe cowl makes not the monk, neither the cord the\nfriar--we have all heard of the cures wrought by Dr. Lundin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cToys, young sir--trifles,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the leech with grave disclamation\nof superior skill; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe hit-or-miss practice of a poor retired\ngentleman, in a short cloak and doublet--Marry, Heaven sent its\nblessing--and this I must say, better fashioned mediciners have\nbrought fewer patients through--_lunga roba corta scienzia_, saith the\nItalian--ha, fair sir, you have the language?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland Graeme did not think it necessary to expound to this learned\nTheban whether he understood him or no; but, leaving that matter\nuncertain, he told him he came in quest of certain packages which should\nhave arrived at Kinross, and been placed under the chamberlain's charge\nthe evening before.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBody o' me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Doctor Lundin, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI fear our common carrier, John\nAuchtermuchty, hath met with some mischance, that he came not up last\nnight with his wains--bad land this to journey in, my master; and the\nfool will travel by night too, although, (besides all maladies from your\n_tussis_ to your _pestis_, which walk abroad in the night-air,) he may\nwell fall in with half a dozen swash-bucklers, who will ease him at once\nof his baggage and his earthly complaints. I must send forth to inquire\nafter him, since he hath stuff of the honourable household on hand--and,\nby our Lady, he hath stuff of mine too--certain drugs sent me from\nthe city for composition of my alexipharmics--this gear must be looked\nto.--Hodge,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, addressing one of his redoubted body-guard,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cdo thou and Toby Telford take the mickle brown aver and the black\ncut-tailed mare, and make out towards the Kerry-craigs, and see what\ntidings you can have of Auchtermuchty and his wains--I trust it is only\nthe medicine of the pottle-pot, (being the only _medicamentum_ which\nthe beast useth,) which hath caused him to tarry on the road. Take\nthe ribbons from your halberds, ye knaves, and get on your jacks,\nplate-sleeves, and knapskulls, that your presence may work some terror\nif you meet with opposers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He then added, turning to Roland Graeme, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nwarrant me, we shall have news of the wains in brief season. Meantime\nit will please you to look upon the sports; but first to enter my\npoor lodging and take your morning's cup. For what saith the school of\nSalerno?\n\n  _Poculum, mane haustum,\n  Restaurat naturam exhaustam.\u00e2\u0080\u009d_\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour learning is too profound for me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the page; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand so would\nyour draught be likewise, I fear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot a whit, fair sir--a cordial cup of sack, impregnated with wormwood,\nis the best anti-pestilential draught; and, to speak truth, the\npestilential miasmata are now very rife in the atmosphere. We live in\na happy time, young man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued he, in a tone of grave irony, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand\nhave many blessings unknown to our fathers--Here are two sovereigns\nin the land, a regnant and a claimant--that is enough of one good\nthing--but if any one wants more, he may find a king in every peel-house\nin the country; so if we lack government, it is not for want of\ngovernors. Then have we a civil war to phlebotomize us every year, and\nto prevent our population from starving for want of food--and for the\nsame purpose we have the Plague proposing us a visit, the best of all\nrecipes for thinning a land, and converting younger brothers into elder\nones. Well, each man in his vocation. You young fellows of the sword\ndesire to wrestle, fence, or so forth, with some expert adversary; and\nfor my part, I love to match myself for life or death against that same\nPlague.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs they proceeded up the street of the little village towards the\nDoctor's lodgings, his attention was successively occupied by the\nvarious personages whom he met, and pointed out to the notice of his\ncompanion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you see that fellow with the red bonnet, the blue jerkin, and the\ngreat rough baton in his hand?--I believe that clown hath the strength\nof a tower--he has lived fifty years in the world, and never encouraged\nthe liberal sciences by buying one penny-worth of medicaments.--But see\nyou that man with the _facies hippocratica_?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, pointing out\na thin peasant, with swelled legs, and a most cadaverous countenance;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I call one of the worthiest men in the barony--he breakfasts,\nluncheons, dines, and sups by my advice, and not without my medicine;\nand, for his own single part, will go farther to clear out a moderate\nstock of pharmaceutics, than half the country besides.--How do you,\nmy honest friend?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he to the party in question, with a tone of\ncondolence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery weakly, sir, since I took the electuary,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the patient;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cit neighboured ill with the two spoonfuls of pease-porridge and the\nkirnmilk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPease-porridge and kirnmilk! Have you been under medicine these ten\nyears, and keep your diet so ill?--the next morning take the electuary\nby itself, and touch nothing for six hours.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--The poor object bowed, and\nlimped off.\n\nThe next whom the Doctor deigned to take notice of, was a lame fellow,\nby whom the honour was altogether undeserved, for at sight of the\nmediciner, he began to shuffle away in the crowd as fast as his\ninfirmities would permit.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is an ungrateful hound for you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Doctor Lundin; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI cured\nhim of the gout in his feet, and now he talks of the chargeableness of\nmedicine, and makes the first use of his restored legs to fly from his\nphysician. His _podagra_ hath become a _chiragra_, as honest Martial\nhath it--the gout has got into his fingers, and he cannot draw his\npurse. Old saying and true,\n\n  Praemia cum poscit medicus, Sathan est.\n\nWe are angels when we come to cure--devils when we ask payment--but I\nwill administer a purgation to his purse I warrant him. There is his\nbrother too, a sordid chuff.--So ho, there! Saunders Darlet! you have\nbeen ill, I hear?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust got the turn, as I was thinking to send to your honour, and I am\nbrawly now again--it was nae great thing that ailed me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHark you, sirrah,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI trust you remember you are owing\nto the laird four stones of barleymeal, and a bow of oats; and I would\nhave you send no more such kain-fowls as you sent last season, that\nlooked as wretchedly as patients just dismissed from a plague-hospital;\nand there is hard money owing besides.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was thinking, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the man, _more Scotico_, that is, returning\nno direct answer on the subject on which he was addressed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy best way\nwould be to come down to your honour, and take your advice yet, in case\nmy trouble should come back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo so, then, knave,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Lundin, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand remember what Ecclesiasticus\nsaith--'Give place to the physician-let him not go from thee, for thou\nhast need of him.'\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis exhortation was interrupted by an apparition, which seemed to strike\nthe doctor with as much horror and surprise, as his own visage inflicted\nupon sundry of those persons whom he had addressed.\n\nThe figure which produced this effect on the Esculapius of the village,\nwas that of a tall old woman, who wore a high-crowned hat and muffler.\nThe first of these habiliments added apparently to her stature, and\nthe other served to conceal the lower part of her face, and as the hat\nitself was slouched, little could be seen besides two brown cheek-bones,\nand the eyes of swarthy fire, that gleamed from under two shaggy gray\neyebrows. She was dressed in a long dark-coloured robe of unusual\nfashion, bordered at the skirts, and on the stomacher, with a sort of\nwhite trimming resembling the Jewish phylacteries, on which were wrought\nthe characters of some unknown language. She held in her hand a walking\nstaff of black ebony.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy the soul of Celsus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Doctor Luke Lundin, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is old Mother\nNicneven herself--she hath come to beard me within mine own bounds, and\nin the very execution of mine office! Have at thy coat, Old Woman, as\nthe song says--Hob Anster, let her presently be seized and committed to\nthe tolbooth; and if there are any zealous brethren here who would give\nthe hag her deserts, and duck her, as a witch, in the loch, I pray let\nthem in no way be hindered.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut the myrmidons of Dr. Lundin showed in this case no alacrity to do\nhis bidding. Hob Anster even ventured to remonstrate in the name of\nhimself and his brethren. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be sure he was to do his honour's bidding;\nand for a' that folks said about the skill and witcheries of Mother\nNicneven, he would put his trust in God, and his hand on her collar,\nwithout dreadour. But she was no common spaewife, this Mother Nicneven,\nlike Jean Jopp that lived in the Bricrie-baulk. She had lords and lairds\nthat would ruffle for her. There was Moncrieff of Tippermalloch, that\nwas Popish, and the laird of Carslogie, a kend Queen's man, were in the\nfair, with wha kend how mony swords and bucklers at their back; and they\nwould be sure to make a break-out if the officers meddled with the auld\nPopish witch-wife, who was sae weel friended; mair especially as the\nlaird's best men, such as were not in the castle, were in Edinburgh with\nhim, and he doubted his honour the Doctor would find ower few to make a\ngood backing, if blades were bare.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe doctor listened unwillingly to this prudential counsel, and was only\ncomforted by the faithful promise of his satellite, that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe old\nwoman should,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as he expressed it, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbe ta'en canny the next time she\ntrespassed on the bounds.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd in that event,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor to his companion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfire and fagot\nshall be the best of her welcome.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis he spoke in hearing of the dame herself, who even then, and in\npassing the Doctor, shot towards him from under her gray eyebrows a look\nof the most insulting and contemptuous superiority.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued the physician, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d marshalling his guest\ninto his lodging,--\u00e2\u0080\u009ctake care you stumble not over a retort, for it is\nhazardous for the ignorant to walk in the ways of art.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe page found all reason for the caution; for besides stuffed birds,\nand lizards, and snakes bottled up, and bundles of simples made up, and\nother parcels spread out to dry, and all the confusion, not to mention\nthe mingled and sickening smells, incidental to a druggist's stock in\ntrade, he had also to avoid heaps of charcoal crucibles, bolt-heads,\nstoves, and the other furniture of a chemical laboratory.\n\nAmongst his other philosophical qualities, Doctor Lundin failed not to\nbe a confused sloven, and his old dame housekeeper, whose life, as she\nsaid, was spent in \u00e2\u0080\u009credding him up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d had trotted off to the mart of\ngaiety with other and younger folks. Much chattering and jangling\ntherefore there was among jars, and bottles, and vials, ere the Doctor\nproduced the salutiferous potion which he recommended so strongly, and\na search equally long and noisy followed, among broken cans and cracked\npipkins, ere he could bring forth a cup out of which to drink it. Both\nmatters being at length achieved, the Doctor set the example to his\nguest, by quaffing off a cup of the cordial, and smacking his lips with\napprobation as it descended his gullet.--Roland, in turn, submitted to\nswallow the potion which his host so earnestly recommended, but which\nhe found so insufferably bitter, that he became eager to escape from the\nlaboratory in search of a draught of fair water to expel the taste. In\nspite of his efforts, he was nevertheless detained by the garrulity of\nhis host, till he gave him some account of Mother Nicneven.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI care not to speak of her,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin the open air, and\namong the throng of people; not for fright, like yon cowardly dog\nAnster, but because I would give no occasion for a fray, having no\nleisure to look to stabs, slashes, and broken bones. Men call the old\nhag a prophetess--I do scarce believe she could foretell when a brood\nof chickens will chip the shell--Men say she reads the heavens--my black\nbitch knows as much of them when she sits baying the moon--Men pretend\nthe ancient wretch is a sorceress, a witch, and, what not--_Inter nos_,\nI will never contradict a rumour which may bring her to the stake which\nshe so justly deserves; but neither will I believe that the tales of\nwitches which they din into our ears are aught but knavery, cozenage,\nand old women's fables.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the name of Heaven, what is she then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you make\nsuch a stir about her?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is one of those cursed old women,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwho take\ncurrently and impudently upon themselves to act as advisers and curers\nof the sick, on the strength of some trash of herbs, some rhyme of\nspells, some julap or diet, drink or cordial.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, go no farther,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page; \u00e2\u0080\u009cif they brew cordials, evil be\ntheir lot and all their partakers!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou say well, young man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Lundin; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor mine own part, I know\nno such pests to the commonwealth as these old incarnate devils, who\nhaunt the chambers of the brain-sick patients, that are mad enough to\nsuffer them to interfere with, disturb, and let, the regular process of\na learned and artificial cure, with their sirups, and their julaps, and\ndiascordium, and mithridate, and my Lady What-shall-call'um's powder,\nand worthy Dame Trashem's pill; and thus make widows and orphans, and\ncheat the regular and well-studied physician, in order to get the\nname of wise women and skeely neighbours, and so forth. But no more\non't--Mother Nicneven [Footnote: This was the name given to the grand\nMother Witch, the very Hecate of Scottish popular superstition. Her name\nwas bestowed, in one or two instances, upon sorceresses, who were held\nto resemble her by their superior skill in \u00e2\u0080\u009cHell's black grammar.\u00e2\u0080\u009d] and\nI will meet one day, and she shall know there is danger in dealing with\nthe Doctor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a true word, and many have found it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut under\nyour favour, I would fain walk abroad for a little, and see these\nsports.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is well moved,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I too should be showing myself\nabroad. Moreover the play waits us, young man-to-day, _totus mundus\nagit histrionem_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--And they sallied forth accordingly into the mirthful\nscene.\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Twenty-Seventh.\n\n\n  See on yon verdant lawn, the gathering crowd\n  Thickens amain; the buxom nymphs advance,\n  Usher'd by jolly clowns; distinctions cease,\n  Lost in the common joy, and the bold slave\n  Leans on his wealthy master unreproved.\n              _Rural Games_.--SOMERVILLLE.\n\nThe re-appearance of the dignified Chamberlain on the street of the\nvillage was eagerly hailed by the revellers, as a pledge that the\nplay, or dramatic representation, which had been postponed owing to his\nabsence, was now full surely to commence. Any thing like an approach\nto this most interesting of all amusements, was of recent origin in\nScotland, and engaged public attention in proportion. All other sports\nwere discontinued. The dance around the Maypole was arrested--the ring\nbroken up and dispersed, while the dancers, each leading his partner by\nthe hand, tripped, off to the silvan theatre. A truce was in like\nmanner achieved betwixt a huge brown bear and certain mastiffs, who\nwere tugging and pulling at his shaggy coat, under the mediation of the\nbear-ward and half a dozen butchers and yeomen, who, by dint of _staving\nand tailing_, as it was technically termed, separated the unfortunate\nanimals, whose fury had for an hour past been their chief amusement.\nThe itinerant minstrel found himself deserted by the audience he had\ncollected, even in the most interesting passage of the romance which he\nrecited, and just as he was sending about his boy, with bonnet in hand,\nto collect their oblations. He indignantly stopped short in the midst\nof _Rosewal and Lilian_, and, replacing his three-stringed fiddle, or\nrebeck, in its leathern case, followed the crowd, with no good-will, to\nthe exhibition which had superseded his own. The juggler had ceased his\nexertions of emitting flame and smoke, and was content to respire in the\nmanner of ordinary mortals, rather than to play gratuitously the part\nof a fiery dragon. In short, all other sports were suspended, so eagerly\ndid the revellers throng towards the place of representation.\n\nThey would err greatly, who should regulate their ideas of this dramatic\nexhibition upon those derived from a modern theatre; for the rude shows\nof Thespis were far less different from those exhibited by Euripides on\nthe stage of Athens, with all its magnificent decorations and pomp of\ndresses and of scenery. In the present case, there were no scenes, no\nstage, no machinery, no pit, box, and gallery, no box-lobby; and, what\nmight in poor Scotland be some consolation for other negations, there\nwas no taking of money at the door. As in the devices of the magnanimous\nBottom, the actors had a greensward plot for a stage, and a hawthorn\nbush for a greenroom and tiring-house; the spectators being accommodated\nwith seats on the artificial bank which had been raised around\nthree-fourths of the playground, the remainder being left open for the\nentrance and exit of the performers. Here sate the uncritical audience,\nthe Chamberlain in the centre, as the person highest in office, all\nalive to enjoyment and admiration, and all therefore dead to criticism.\n\nThe characters which appeared and disappeared before the amused and\ninterested audience, were those which fill the earlier stage in all\nnations--old men, cheated by their wives and daughters, pillaged by\ntheir sons, and imposed on by their domestics, a braggadocia captain,\na knavish pardoner or quaestionary, a country bumpkin and a wanton city\ndame. Amid all these, and more acceptable than almost the whole put\ntogether, was the all-licensed fool, the Gracioso of the Spanish drama,\nwho, with his cap fashioned into the resemblance of a coxcomb, and his\nbauble, a truncheon terminated by a carved figure wearing a fool's cap,\nin his hand, went, came, and returned, mingling in every scene of the\npiece, and interrupting the business, without having any share himself\nin the action, and ever and anon transferring his gibes from the actors\non the stage to the audience who sate around, prompt to applaud the\nwhole.\n\nThe wit of the piece, which was not of the most polished kind, was\nchiefly directed against the superstitious practices of the Catholic\nreligion; and the stage artillery had on this occasion been levelled\nby no less a person than Doctor Lundin, who had not only commanded the\nmanager of the entertainment to select one of the numerous satires which\nhad been written against the Papists, (several of which were cast in a\ndramatic form,) but had even, like the Prince of Denmark, caused them to\ninsert, or according to his own phrase, to infuse here and there, a\nfew pleasantries of his own penning, on the same inexhaustible subject,\nhoping thereby to mollify the rigour of the Lady of Lochleven towards\npastimes of this description. He failed not to jog Roland's elbow,\nwho was sitting in state behind him, and recommend to his particular\nattention those favourite passages. As for the page, to whom, the very\nidea of such an exhibition, simple as it was, was entirely new, he\nbeheld it with the undiminished and ecstatic delight with which men\nof all ranks look for the first time on dramatic representation, and\nlaughed, shouted, and clapped his hands as the performance proceeded. An\nincident at length took place, which effectually broke off his interest\nin the business of the scene.\n\nOne of the principal personages in the comic part of the drama was,\nas we have already said, a quaestionary or pardoner, one of those\nitinerants who hawked about from place to place relics, real or\npretended, with which he excited the devotion at once, and the charity\nof the populace, and generally deceived both the one and the other. The\nhypocrisy, impudence, and profligacy of these clerical wanderers, had\nmade them the subject of satire from the time of Chaucer down to that of\nHeywood. Their present representative failed not to follow the same line\nof humour, exhibiting pig's bones for relics, and boasting the virtues\nof small tin crosses, which had been shaken in the holy porringer at\nLoretto, and of cockleshells, which had been brought from the shrine\nof Saint James of Compostella, all which he disposed of to the devout\nCatholics at nearly as high a price as antiquaries are now willing\nto pay for baubles of similar intrinsic value. At length the pardoner\npulled from his scrip a small phial of clear water, of which he vaunted\nthe quality in the following verses:--\n\n  Listneth, gode people, everiche one\n  For in the londe of Babylone,\n  Far eastward I wot it lyeth,\n  And is the first londe the sonne espieth,\n  Ther, as he cometh fro out the s\u00c3\u00a9;\n  In this ilk londe, as thinketh me,\n  Right as holie legendes tell.\n  Snottreth from a roke a well,\n  And falleth into ane bath of ston,\n  Where chaste Susanne, in times long gon,\n\n  Wax wont to wash her bodie and lim\n  Mickle vertue hath that streme,\n  As ye shall se er that ye pas,\n  Ensample by this little glas--\n  Through night\u00c3\u00a9s cold and day\u00c3\u00a9s hote\n  Hiderward I have it brought;\n  Hath a wife made slip or side,\n  Or a maiden stepp'd aside,\n  Putteth this water under her nese,\n  Wold she nold she, she shall snese.\n\nThe jest, as the reader skilful in the antique language of the drama\nmust at once perceive, turned on the same pivot as in the old minstrel\ntales of the Drinking Horn of King Arthur, and the Mantle made Amiss.\nBut the audience were neither learned nor critical enough to challenge\nits want of originality. The potent relic was, after such grimace and\nbuffoonery as befitted the subject, presented successively to each\nof the female personages of the drama, not one of whom sustained\nthe supposed test of discretion; but, to the infinite delight of the\naudience, sneezed much louder and longer than perhaps they themselves\nhad counted on. The jest seemed at last worn threadbare, and the\npardoner was passing on to some new pleasantry, when the jester or clown\nof the drama, possessing himself secretly of the phial which contained\nthe wondrous liquor, applied it suddenly to the nose of a young woman,\nwho, with her black silk muffler, or screen drawn over her face, was\nsitting in the foremost rank of the spectators, intent apparently upon\nthe business of the stage. The contents of the phial, well calculated to\nsustain the credit of the pardoner's legend, set the damsel a-sneezing\nviolently, an admission of frailty which was received with shouts\nof rapture by the audience. These were soon, however, renewed at the\nexpense of the jester himself, when the insulted maiden extricated, ere\nthe paroxysm was well over, one hand from the folds of her mantle, and\nbestowed on the wag a buffet, which made him reel fully his own\nlength from the pardoner, and then acknowledge the favour by instant\nprostration.\n\nNo one pities a jester overcome in his vocation, and the clown met with\nlittle sympathy, when, rising from the ground, and whimpering forth his\ncomplaints of harsh treatment, he invoked the assistance and sympathy\nof the audience. But the Chamberlain, feeling his own dignity insulted,\nordered two of his halberdiers to bring the culprit before him. When\nthese official persons first approached the virago, she threw herself\ninto an attitude of firm defiance, as if determined to resist their\nauthority; and from the sample of strength and spirit which she\nhad already displayed, they showed no alacrity at executing their\ncommission. But on half a minute's reflection, the damsel changed\ntotally her attitude and manner, folded her cloak around her arms in\nmodest and maiden-like fashion, and walked of her own accord to the\npresence of the great man, followed and guarded by the two manful\nsatellites. As she moved across the vacant space, and more especially\nas she stood at the footstool of the Doctor's judgment-seat, the maiden\ndiscovered that lightness and elasticity of step, and natural grace of\nmanner, which connoisseurs in female beauty know to be seldom divided\nfrom it. Moreover, her neat russet-coloured jacket, and short petticoat\nof the same colour, displayed a handsome form and a pretty leg. Her\nfeatures were concealed by the screen; but the Doctor, whose gravity did\nnot prevent his pretensions to be a connoisseur of the school we have\nhinted at, saw enough to judge favourably of the piece by the sample.\n\nHe began, however, with considerable austerity of manner.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd how now,\nsaucy quean!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the medical man of office; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat have you to say why\nI should not order you to be ducked in the loch, for lifting your hand\nto the man in my presence?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMarry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the culprit, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause I judge that your honour will not\nthink the cold bath necessary for my complaints.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA pestilent jade,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, whispering to Roland Graeme; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand\nI'll warrant her a good one--her voice is as sweet as sirup.--But,\nmy pretty maiden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou show us wonderful little of that\ncountenance of yours--be pleased to throw aside your muffler.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI trust your honour will excuse me till we are more private,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered\nthe maiden; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor I have acquaintance, and I should like ill to be known\nin the country as the poor girl whom that scurvy knave put his jest\nupon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFear nothing for thy good name, my sweet little modicum of candied\nmanna,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor I protest to you, as I am Chamberlain\nof Lochleven, Kinross, and so forth, that the chaste Susanna herself\ncould not have snuffed that elixir without sternutation, being in truth\na curious distillation of rectified _acetum_, or vinegar of the sun,\nprepared by mine own hands--Wherefore, as thou sayest thou wilt come to\nme in private, and express thy contrition for the offence whereof thou\nhast been guilty, I command that all for the present go forward as if no\nsuch interruption of the prescribed course had taken place.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe damsel curtsied and tripped back to her place. The play proceeded,\nbut it no longer attracted the attention of Roland Graeme.\n\nThe voice, the figure, and what the veil permitted to be seen of the\nneck and tresses of the village damsel, bore so strong a resemblance to\nthose of Catherine Seyton, that he felt like one bewildered in the\nmazes of a changeful and stupifying dream. The memorable scene of\nthe hostelrie rushed on his recollection, with all its doubtful and\nmarvellous circumstances. Were the tales of enchantment which he\nhad read in romances realized in this extraordinary girl? Could she\ntransport herself from the walled and guarded Castle of Lochleven,\nmoated with its broad lake, (towards which he cast back a look as if to\nascertain it was still in existence,) and watched with such scrupulous\ncare as the safety of a nation demanded?--Could she surmount all these\nobstacles, and make such careless and dangerous use of her liberty, as\nto engage herself publicly in a quarrel in a village fair? Roland was\nunable to determine whether the exertions which it must have cost her\nto gain her freedom or the use to which she had put it, rendered her the\nmost unaccountable creature.\n\nLost in these meditations, he kept his gaze fixed on the subject of\nthem; and in every casual motion, discovered, or thought he discovered,\nsomething which reminded him still more strongly of Catherine Seyton.\nIt occurred to him more than once, indeed, that he might be deceiving\nhimself by exaggerating some casual likeness into absolute identity.\nBut then the meeting at the hostelrie of Saint Michael's returned to his\nmind, and it seemed in the highest degree improbable, that, under\nsuch various circumstances, mere imagination should twice have found\nopportunity to play him the selfsame trick. This time, however, he\ndetermined to have his doubts resolved, and for this purpose he sate\nduring the rest of the play like a greyhound in the slip, ready to\nspring upon the hare the instant that she was started. The damsel, whom\nhe watched attentively lest she should escape in the crowd when the\nspectacle was closed, sate as if perfectly unconscious that she was\nobserved. But the worthy Doctor marked the direction of his eyes, and\nmagnanimously suppressed his own inclination to become the Theseus\nto this Hippolyta, in deference to the rights of hospitality, which\nenjoined him to forbear interference with the pleasurable pursuits\nof his young friend. He passed one or two formal gibes upon the fixed\nattention which the page paid to the unknown, and upon his own jealousy;\nadding, however, that if both were to be presented to the patient at\nonce, he had little doubt she would think the younger man the sounder\nprescription. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI fear me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe shall have no news of the knave\nAuchtermuchty for some time, since the vermin whom I sent after him seem\nto have proved corbie-messengers. So you have an hour or two on your\nhands, Master Page; and as the minstrels are beginning to strike up, now\nthe play is ended, why, an you incline for a dance, yonder is the green,\nand there sits your partner--I trust you will hold me perfect in my\ndiagnostics, since I see with half an eye what disease you are sick of,\nand have administered a pleasing remedy.\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009c_Discernit sapiens res_ (as Chambers hath it) _quas\n    confundit asellus_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe page hardly heard the end of the learned adage, or the charge\nwhich the Chamberlain gave him to be within reach, in case of the wains\narriving suddenly, and sooner than expected--so eager he was at once\nto shake himself free of his learned associate, and to satisfy his\ncuriosity regarding the unknown damsel. Yet in the haste with which he\nmade towards her he found time to reflect, that, in order to secure an\nopportunity of conversing with her in private, he must not alarm her\nat first accosting her. He therefore composed his manner and gait,\nand advancing with becoming self-confidence before three or four\ncountry-fellows who were intent on the same design, but knew not so well\nhow to put their request into shape, he acquainted her that he, as the\ndeputy of the venerable Chamberlain, requested the honour of her hand as\na partner.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe venerable Chamberlain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the damsel frankly, reaching the page\nher hand, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdoes very well to exercise this part of his privilege by\ndeputy; and I suppose the laws of the revels leave me no choice but to\naccept of his faithful delegate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cProvided, fair damsel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009chis choice of a delegate is not\naltogether distasteful to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf that, fair sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the maiden, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will tell you more when we\nhave danced the first measure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCatherine Seyton had admirable skill in gestic lore, and was sometimes\ncalled on to dance for the amusement of her royal mistress. Roland\nGraeme had often been a spectator of her skill, and sometimes, at\nthe Queen's command, Catherine's partner on such occasions. He was,\ntherefore, perfectly acquainted with Catherine's mode of dancing; and\nobserved that his present partner, in grace, in agility, in quickness\nof ear, and precision of execution, exactly resembled her, save that the\nScottish jig, which he now danced with her, required a more violent\nand rapid motion, and more rustic agility, than the stately pavens,\nlavoltas, and courantoes, which he had seen her execute in the chamber\nof Queen Mary. The active duties of the dance left him little time for\nreflection, and none for conversation; but when their _pas de deux_\nwas finished, amidst the acclamations of the villagers, who had seldom\nwitnessed such an exhibition, he took an opportunity, when they yielded\nup the green to another couple, to use the privilege of a partner and\nenter into conversation with the mysterious maiden, whom he still held\nby the hand.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFair partner, may I not crave the name of her who has graced me thus\nfar?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the maiden; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut it is a question whether I shall answer\nyou.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd why?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Roland.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause nobody gives anything for nothing--and you can tell me nothing\nin return which I care to hear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCould I not tell you my name and lineage, in exchange for yours?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n returned Roland.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the maiden, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor you know little of either.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, somewhat angrily.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWrath you not for the matter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the damsel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will show you in an\ninstant that I know more of you than you do of yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Graeme; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor whom then do you take me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor the wild falcon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhom a dog brought in his mouth to\na certain castle, when he was but an unfledged eyas--for the hawk\nwhom men dare not fly, lest he should check at game, and pounce on\ncarrion--whom folk must keep hooded till he has the proper light of his\neyes, and can discover good from evil.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell--be it so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Roland Graeme; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI guess at a part of your\nparable, fair mistress mine--and perhaps I know as much of you as you\ndo of me, and can well dispense with the information which you are so\nniggard in giving.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cProve that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the maiden, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I will give you credit for more\npenetration than I judged you to be gifted withal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt shall be proved instantly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe first letter of\nyour name is S, and the last N.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAdmirable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his partner, \u00e2\u0080\u009cguess on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt pleases you to-day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto wear the snood and\nkirtle, and perhaps you may be seen to-morrow in hat and feather, hose\nand doublet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the clout! in the clout! you have hit the very white,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\ndamsel, suppressing a great inclination to laugh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can switch men's eyes out of their heads, as well as the heart out\nof their bosoms.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThese last words were uttered in a low and tender tone, which, to\nRoland's great mortification, and somewhat to his displeasure, was so\nfar from allaying, that it greatly increased, his partner's disposition\nto laughter. She could scarce compose herself while she replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you\nhad thought my hand so formidable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d extricating it from his hold, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\nwould not have grasped it so hard; but I perceive you know me so fully,\nthat there is no occasion to show you my face.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFair Catherine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009che were unworthy ever to have seen\nyou, far less to have dwelt so long in the same service, and under the\nsame roof with you, who could mistake your air, your gesture, your step\nin walking or in dancing, the turn of your neck, the symmetry of your\nform--none could be so dull as not to recognize you by so many proofs;\nbut for me, I could swear even to that tress of hair that escapes from\nunder your muffler.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd to the face, of course, which that muffler covers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nmaiden, removing her veil, and in an instant endeavouring to replace it.\nShe showed the features of Catherine; but an unusual degree of petulant\nimpatience inflamed them, when, from some awkwardness in her management\nof the muffler, she was unable again to adjust it with that dexterity\nwhich was a principal accomplishment of the coquettes of the time.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe fiend rive the rag to tatters!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the damsel, as the veil\nfluttered about her shoulders, with an accent so earnest and decided,\nthat it made the page start. He looked again at the damsel's face, but\nthe information which his eyes received, was to the same purport as\nbefore. He assisted her to adjust her muffler, and both were for\nan instant silent. The damsel spoke first, for Roland Graeme was\noverwhelmed with surprise at the contrarieties which Catherine Seyton\nseemed to include in her person and character.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are surprised,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the damsel to him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cat what you see and\nhear--But the times which make females men, are least of all fitted for\nmen to become women; yet you yourself are in danger of such a change.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI in danger of becoming effeminate!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, you, for all the boldness of your reply,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the damsel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen\nyou should hold fast your religion, because it is assailed on all sides\nby rebels, traitors, and heretics, you let it glide out of your breast\nlike water grasped in the hand. If you are driven from the faith of\nyour fathers from fear of a traitor, is not that womanish?--If you\nare cajoled by the cunning arguments of a trumpeter of heresy, or the\npraises of a puritanic old woman, is not that womanish?--If you are\nbribed by the hope of spoil and preferment, is not that womanish?--And\nwhen you wonder at my venting a threat or an execration, should you not\nwonder at yourself, who, pretending to a gentle name and aspiring\nto knighthood, can be at the same time cowardly, silly, and\nself-interested!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would that a man would bring such a charge,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page; \u00e2\u0080\u009che\nshould see, ere his life was a minute older, whether he had cause to\nterm me coward or no.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBeware of such big words,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the maiden; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou said but anon that\nI sometimes wear hose and doublet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut remain still Catharine Seyton, wear what you list,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page,\nendeavouring again to possess himself of her hand.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou indeed are pleased to call me so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the maiden, evading his\nintention, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I have many other names besides.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd will you not reply to that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cby which you are\ndistinguished beyond every other maiden in Scotland?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe damsel, unallured by his praises, still kept aloof, and sung with\ngaiety a verse from an old ballad,\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, some do call me Jack, sweet love,\n    And some do call me Gill;\n  But when I ride to Holyrood,\n    My name is Wilful Will.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWilful Will\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the page, impatiently; \u00e2\u0080\u009csay rather Will o' the\nWisp--Jack with the Lantern--for never was such a deceitful or wandering\nmeteor!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I be such,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the maiden, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI ask no fools to follow me--If\nthey do so, it is at their own pleasure, and must be on their own proper\nperil.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, but, dearest Catherine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbe for one instant\nserious.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you will call me your dearest Catherine, when I have given you so\nmany names to choose upon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the damsel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would ask you how,\nsupposing me for two or three hours of my life escaped from yonder\ntower, you have the cruelty to ask me to be serious during the only\nmerry moments I have seen perhaps for months?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, but, fair Catherine, there are moments of deep and true feeling,\nwhich are worth ten thousand years of the liveliest mirth; and such was\nthat of yesterday, when you so nearly--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo nearly what?\u00e2\u0080\u009d demanded the damsel, hastily.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you approached your lips so near to the sign you had traced on my\nforehead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMother of Heaven!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed she, in a yet fiercer tone, and with a\nmore masculine manner than she had yet exhibited,-\u00e2\u0080\u009cCatherine Seyton\napproach her lips to a man's brow, and thou that man!--vassal, thou\nliest!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe page stood astonished; but, conceiving he had alarmed the damsel's\ndelicacy by alluding to the enthusiasm of a moment, and the manner in\nwhich she had expressed it, he endeavoured to falter forth an apology.\nHis excuses, though he was unable to give them any regular shape, were\naccepted by his companion, who had indeed suppressed her indignation\nafter its first explosion--\u00e2\u0080\u009cSpeak no more on't,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now let\nus part; our conversation may attract more notice than is convenient for\neither of us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, but allow me at least to follow you to some sequestered place.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou dare not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the maiden.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the youth, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdare not? where is it you dare go, where I dare\nnot follow?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou fear a Will o' the Wisp,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the damsel; \u00e2\u0080\u009chow would you face a\nfiery dragon, with an enchantress mounted on its back?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLike Sir Eger, Sir Grime, or Sir Greysteil,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut be\nthere such toys to be seen here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI go to Mother Nicneven's,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the maid; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand she is witch enough\nto rein the horned devil, with a red silk thread for a bridle, and a\nrowan-tree switch for a whip.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will follow you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet it be at some distance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the maiden.\n\nAnd wrapping her mantle round her with more success than on her former\nattempt, she mingled with the throng, and walked towards the village,\nheedfully followed by Roland Graeme at some distance, and under\nevery precaution which he could use to prevent his purpose from being\nobserved.\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Twenty-Eighth.\n\n\n  Yes, it is he whose eyes look'd on thy childhood,\n  And watch'd with trembling hope thy dawn of youth,\n  That now, with these same eyeballs dimm'd with age,\n  And dimmer yet with tears, sees thy dishonour.\n                                OLD PLAY.\n\nAt the entrance of the principal, or indeed, so to speak, the only\nstreet in Kinross, the damsel, whose steps were pursued by Roland\nGraeme, cast a glance behind her, as if to be certain he had not lost\ntrace of her and then plunged down a very narrow lane which ran betwixt\ntwo rows of poor and ruinous cottages. She paused for a second at the\ndoor of one of those miserable tenements, again cast her eye up the lane\ntowards Roland, then lifted the latch, opened the door, and disappeared\nfrom his view.\n\nWith whatever haste the page followed her example, the difficulty which\nhe found in discovering the trick of the latch, which did not work quite\nin the usual manner, and in pushing open the door, which did not yield\nto his first effort, delayed for a minute or two his entrance into the\ncottage. A dark and smoky passage led, as usual, betwixt the exterior\nwall of the house, and the _hallan_, or clay wall, which served as a\npartition betwixt it and the interior. At the end of this passage,\nand through the partition, was a door leading into the _ben_, or inner\nchamber of the cottage, and when Roland Graeme's hand was upon the latch\nof this door, a female voice pronounced, \u00e2\u0080\u009c_Benedictus qui veniat in\nnomine Domini, damnandus qui in nomine inimici._\u00e2\u0080\u009d On entering the\napartment, he perceived the figure which the chamberlain had pointed out\nto him as Mother Nicneven, seated beside the lowly hearth. But there was\nno other person in the room. Roland Graeme gazed around in surprise at\nthe disappearance of Catherine Seyton, without paying much regard to the\nsupposed sorceress, until she attracted and riveted his regard by the\ntone in which she asked him--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat seekest thou here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI seek,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, with much embarrassment; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI seek--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut his answer was cut short, when the old woman, drawing her huge gray\neyebrows sternly together, with a frown which knitted her brow into a\nthousand wrinkles, arose, and erecting herself up to her full natural\nsize, tore the kerchief from her head, and seizing Roland by the arm,\nmade two strides across the floor of the apartment to a small window\nthrough which the light fell full on her face, and showed the astonished\nyouth the countenance of Magdalen Graeme.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, Roland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthine eyes deceive thee not; they show thee truly the features of her\nwhom thou hast thyself deceived, whose wine thou hast turned into gall,\nher bread of joyfulness into bitter poison, her hope into the blackest\ndespair--it is she who now demands of thee, what seekest thou here?--She\nwhose heaviest sin towards Heaven hath been, that she loved thee\neven better than the weal of the whole church, and could not without\nreluctance surrender thee even in the cause of God--she now asks you,\nwhat seekest thou here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhile she spoke, she kept her broad black eye riveted on the youth's\nface, with the expression with which the eagle regards his prey ere he\ntears it to pieces. Roland felt himself at the moment incapable either\nof reply or evasion. This extraordinary enthusiast had preserved over\nhim in some measure the ascendency which she had acquired during his\nchildhood; and, besides, he knew the violence of her passions and her\nimpatience of contradiction, and was sensible that almost any reply\nwhich he could make, was likely to throw her into an ecstasy of rage.\nHe was therefore silent; and Magdalen Graeme proceeded with increasing\nenthusiasm in her apostrophe--\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnce more, what seek'st thou, false\nboy?--seek'st thou the honour thou hast renounced, the faith thou hast\nabandoned, the hopes thou hast destroyed?--Or didst thou seek me, the\nsole protectress of thy youth, the only parent whom thou hast known,\nthat thou mayest trample on my gray hairs, even as thou hast already\ntrampled on the best wishes of my heart?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPardon me, mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut, in truth and reason,\nI deserve not your blame. I have been treated amongst you--even by\nyourself, my revered parent, as well as by others--as one who lacked the\ncommon attributes of free-will and human reason, or was at least deemed\nunfit to exercise them. A land of enchantment have I been led into, and\nspells have been cast around me--every one has met me in disguise--every\none has spoken to me in parables--I have been like one who walks in a\nweary and bewildering dream; and now you blame me that I have not the\nsense, and judgment, and steadiness of a waking, and a disenchanted, and\na reasonable man, who knows what he is doing, and wherefore he does it.\nIf one must walk with masks and spectres, who waft themselves from place\nto place as it were in vision rather than reality, it might shake the\nsoundest faith and turn the wisest head. I sought, since I must needs\navow my folly, the same Catherine Seyton with whom you made me first\nacquainted, and whom I most strangely find in this village of Kinross,\ngayest among the revellers, when I had but just left her in the\nwell-guarded castle of Lochleven, the sad attendant of an imprisoned\nQueen-I sought her, and in her place I find you, my mother, more\nstrangely disguised than even she is.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what hadst thou to do with Catherine Seyton?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the matron,\nsternly; \u00e2\u0080\u009cis this a time or a world to follow maidens, or to dance\naround a Maypole? When the trumpet summons every true-hearted Scotsman\naround the standard of the true sovereign, shalt thou be found loitering\nin a lady's bower?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, by Heaven, nor imprisoned in the rugged walls of an island castle!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n answered Roland Graeme: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would the blast were to sound even now, for I\nfear that nothing less loud will dispel the chimerical visions by which\nI am surrounded.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoubt not that it will be winded,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the matron, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand that so\nfearfully loud, that Scotland will never hear the like until the last\nand loudest blast of all shall announce to mountain and to valley that\ntime is no more. Meanwhile, be thou but brave and constant--Serve God\nand honour thy sovereign--Abide by thy religion--I cannot--I will\nnot--I dare not ask thee the truth of the terrible surmises I have heard\ntouching thy falling away--perfect not that accursed sacrifice--and yet,\neven at this late hour, thou mayest be what I have hoped for the son\nof my dearest hope--what say I? the son of _my_ hope--thou shalt be the\nhope of Scotland, her boast and her honour!--Even thy wildest and most\nfoolish wishes may perchance be fulfilled--I might blush to mingle\nmeaner motives with the noble guerdon I hold out to thee--It shames me,\nbeing such as I am, to mention the idle passions of youth, save with\ncontempt and the purpose of censure. But we must bribe children to\nwholesome medicine by the offer of cates, and youth to honourable\nachievement with the promise of pleasure. Mark me, therefore, Roland.\nThe love of Catherine Seyton will follow him only who shall achieve the\nfreedom of her mistress; and believe, it may be one day in thine own\npower to be that happy lover. Cast, therefore, away doubt and fear, and\nprepare to do what religion calls for, what thy country demands of thee,\nwhat thy duty as a subject and as a servant alike require at your hand;\nand be assured, even the idlest or wildest wishes of thy heart will be\nmost readily attained by following the call of thy duty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs she ceased speaking, a double knock was heard against the inner door.\nThe matron hastily adjusting her muffler, and resuming her chair by the\nhearth, demanded who was there.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_Salve in nomine sancto_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was answered from without.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_Salvete et vos_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Magdalen Graeme.\n\nAnd a man entered in the ordinary dress of a nobleman's retainer,\nwearing at his girdle a sword and buckler--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI sought you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy\nmother, and him whom I see with you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then addressing himself to Roland\nGraeme, he said to him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHast thou not a packet from George Douglas?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, suddenly recollecting that which had been\ncommitted to his charge in the morning, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I may not deliver it to any\none without some token that they have a right to ask it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou say well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the serving-man, and whispered into his ear,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe packet which I ask is the report to his father--will this token\nsuffice?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the page, and taking the packet from his bosom, gave\nit to the man.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will return presently,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the serving-man, and left the cottage.\n\nRoland had now sufficiently recovered his surprise to accost his\nrelative in turn, and request to know the reason why he found her in\nso precarious a disguise, and a place so dangerous--\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou cannot be\nignorant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cof the hatred that the Lady of Lochleven bears to\nthose of your--that is of our religion--your present disguise lays you\nopen to suspicion of a different kind, but inferring no less hazard;\nand whether as a Catholic, or as a sorceress, or as a friend to the\nunfortunate Queen, you are in equal danger, if apprehended within the\nbounds of the Douglas; and in the chamberlain who administers their\nauthority, you have, for his own reasons, an enemy, and a bitter one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the matron, her eyes kindling with triumph; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know\nthat, vain of his school-craft, and carnal wisdom, Luke Lundin views\nwith jealousy and hatred the blessings which the saints have conferred\non my prayers, and on the holy relics, before the touch, nay, before the\nbare presence of which, disease and death have so often been known to\nretreat.--I know he would rend and tear me; but there is a chain and\na muzzle on the ban dog that shall restrain his fury, and the Master's\nservant shall not be offended by him until the Master's work is wrought.\nWhen that hour comes, let the shadows of the evening descend on me in\nthunder and in tempest; the time shall be welcome that relieves my eyes\nfrom seeing guilt, and my ears from listening to blasphemy. Do thou but\nbe constant--play thy part as I have played and will play mine, and my\nrelease shall be like that of a blessed martyr whose ascent to heaven\nangels hail with psalm and song, while earth pursues him with hiss and\nwith execration.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs she concluded, the serving-man again entered the cottage, and said,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll is well! the time holds for to-morrow night.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat time? what holds?\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Roland Graeme; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI trust I have given\nthe Douglas's packet to no wrong--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cContent yourself, young man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the serving-man; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthou hast my\nword and token.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know not if the token be right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I care not much\nfor the word of a stranger.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the matron, \u00e2\u0080\u009calthough thou mayest have given a packet\ndelivered to thy charge by one of the Queen's rebels into the hand of\na loyal subject--there were no great mistake in that, thou hot-brained\nboy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy Saint Andrew, there were foul mistake, though,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the page;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cit is the very spirit of my duty, in this first stage of chivalry,\nto be faithful to my trust; and had the devil given me a message to\ndischarge, I would not (so I had plighted my faith to the contrary)\nbetray his counsel to an angel of light.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, by the love I once bore thee,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the matron, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI could slay thee\nwith mine own hand, when I hear thee talk of a dearer faith being due to\nrebels and heretics, than thou owest to thy church and thy prince!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe patient, my good sister,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the serving-man; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will give him\nsuch reasons as shall counterbalance the scruples which beset\nhim---the spirit is honourable, though now it may be mistimed and\nmisplaced.--Follow me, young man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEre I go to call this stranger to a reckoning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page to the\nmatron, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis there nothing I can do for your comfort and safety?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnothing, save what will lead more to thine own\nhonour;--the saints who have protected me thus far, will lend me succour\nas I need it. Tread the path of glory that is before thee, and only\nthink of me as the creature on earth who will be most delighted to hear\nof thy fame.--Follow the stranger--he hath tidings for you that you\nlittle expect.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe stranger remained on the threshold as if waiting for Roland, and as\nsoon as he saw him put himself in motion, he moved on before at a quick\npace. Diving still deeper down the lane, Roland perceived that it was\nnow bordered by buildings upon the one side only, and that the other\nwas fenced by a high old wall, over which some trees extended their\nbranches. Descending a good way farther, they came to a small door in\nthe wall. Roland's guide paused, looked around an instant to see if any\none were within sight, then taking a key from his pocket, opened the\ndoor and entered, making a sign to Roland Graeme to follow him. He did\nso, and the stranger locked the door carefully on the inside. During\nthis operation the page had a moment to look around, and perceived that\nhe was in a small orchard very trimly kept.\n\nThe stranger led him through an alley or two, shaded by trees loaded\nwith summer-fruit, into a pleached arbour, where, taking the turf-seat\nwhich was on the one side, he motioned to Roland to occupy that\nwhich was opposite to him, and, after a momentary silence, opened the\nconversation as follows: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have asked a better warrant than the word\nof a mere stranger, to satisfy you that I have the authority of George\nof Douglas for possessing myself of the packet intrusted to your\ncharge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is precisely the point on which I demand reckoning of you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nRoland. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI fear I have acted hastily; if so, I must redeem my error as I\nbest may.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou hold me then as a perfect stranger?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the man. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook at my face\nmore attentively, and see if the features do not resemble those of a man\nmuch known to you formerly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland gazed attentively; but the ideas recalled to his mind were so\ninconsistent with the mean and servile dress of the person before him,\nthat he did not venture to express the opinion which he was irresistibly\ninduced to form.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, my son,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the stranger, observing his embarrassment, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\ndo indeed see before you the unfortunate Father Ambrosius, who once\naccounted his ministry crowned in your preservation from the snares of\nheresy, but who is now condemned to lament thee as a castaway!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland Graeme's kindness of heart was at least equal to his vivacity\nof temper--he could not bear to see his ancient and honoured master and\nspiritual guide in a situation which inferred a change of fortune so\nmelancholy, but throwing himself at his feet, grasped his knees and wept\naloud.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat mean these tears, my son?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cif they are shed for\nyour own sins and follies, surely they are gracious showers, and may\navail thee much--but weep not, if they fall on my account. You indeed\nsee the Superior of the community of Saint Mary's in the dress of a poor\nsworder, who gives his master the use of his blade and buckler, and,\nif needful, of his life, for a coarse livery coat and four marks by the\nyear. But such a garb suits the time, and, in the period of the church\nmilitant, as well becomes her prelates, as staff, mitre, and crosier, in\nthe days of the church's triumph.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy what fate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page--\u00e2\u0080\u009cand yet why,\u00e2\u0080\u009d added he, checking\nhimself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cneed I ask? Catherine Seyton in some sort prepared me for\nthis. But that the change should be so absolute--the destruction so\ncomplete!\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, my son,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot Ambrosius, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthine own eyes beheld, in my\nunworthy elevation to the Abbot's stall, the last especial act of holy\nsolemnity which shall be seen in the church of Saint Mary's, until it\nshall please Heaven to turn back the captivity of the church. For the\npresent, the shepherd is smitten--ay, well-nigh to the earth--the\nflock are scattered, and the shrines of saints and martyrs, and pious\nbenefactors to the church, are given to the owls of night, and the\nsatyrs of the desert.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd your brother, the Knight of Avenel--could he do nothing for your\nprotection?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe himself hath fallen under the suspicion of the ruling powers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nthe Abbot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwho are as unjust to their friends as they are cruel to\ntheir enemies. I could not grieve at it, did I hope it might estrange\nhim from his cause; but I know the soul of Halbert, and I rather fear\nit will drive him to prove his fidelity to their unhappy cause, by some\ndeed which may be yet more destructive to the church, and more offensive\nto Heaven. Enough of this; and now to the business of our meeting.--I\ntrust you will hold it sufficient if I pass my word to you that the\npacket of which you were lately the bearer, was designed for my hands by\nGeorge of Douglas?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis George of Douglas----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA true friend to his Queen, Roland; and will soon, I trust, have his\neyes opened to the errors of his (miscalled) church.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut what is he to his father, and what to the Lady of Lochleven, who\nhas been as a mother to him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page impatiently.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe best friend to both, in time and through eternity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cif he shall prove the happy instrument for redeeming the evil they have\nwrought, and are still working.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStill,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI like not that good service which begins in\nbreach of trust.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI blame not thy scruples, my son,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut the time which\nhas wrenched asunder the allegiance of Christians to the church, and of\nsubjects to their king, has dissolved all the lesser bonds of society;\nand, in such days, mere human ties must no more restrain our progress,\nthan the brambles and briers which catch hold of his garments, should\ndelay the path of a pilgrim who travels to pay his vows.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, my father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d--said the youth, and then stopt short in a hesitating\nmanner.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSpeak on, my son,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cspeak without fear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me not offend you then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen I say, that it is\neven this which our adversaries charge against us; when they say that,\nshaping the means according to the end, we are willing to commit great\nmoral evil in order that we may work out eventual good.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe heretics have played their usual arts on you, my son,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nAbbot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey would willingly deprive us of the power of acting wisely\nand secretly, though their possession of superior force forbids our\ncontending with them on terms of equality. They have reduced us to a\nstate of exhausted weakness, and now would fain proscribe the means by\nwhich weakness, through all the range of nature, supplies the lack of\nstrength and defends itself against its potent enemies. As well might\nthe hound say to the hare, use not these wily turns to escape me, but\ncontend with me in pitched battle, as the armed and powerful heretic\ndemand of the down-trodden and oppressed Catholic to lay aside the\nwisdom of the serpent, by which alone they may again hope to raise\nup the Jerusalem over which they weep, and which it is their duty to\nrebuild--But more of this hereafter. And now, my son, I command thee\non thy faith to tell me truly and particularly what has chanced to thee\nsince we parted, and what is the present state of thy conscience. Thy\nrelation, our sister Magdalen, is a woman of excellent gifts, blessed\nwith a zeal which neither doubt nor danger can quench; but yet it is\nnot a zeal altogether according to knowledge; wherefore, my son, I would\nwillingly be myself thy interrogator, and thy counsellor, in these days\nof darkness and stratagem.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith the respect which he owed to his first instructor, Roland Graeme\nwent rapidly through the events which the reader is acquainted with; and\nwhile he disguised not from the prelate the impression which had\nbeen made on his mind by the arguments of the preacher Henderson, he\naccidentally and almost involuntarily gave his Father Confessor to\nunderstand the influence which Catherine Seyton had acquired over his\nmind.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is with joy I discover, my dearest son,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Abbot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat\nI have arrived in time to arrest thee on the verge of the precipice to\nwhich thou wert approaching. These doubts of which you complain, are the\nweeds which naturally grow up in a strong soil, and require the careful\nhand of the husbandman to eradicate them. Thou must study a little\nvolume, which I will impart to thee in fitting time, in which, by Our\nLady's grace, I have placed in somewhat a clearer light than heretofore,\nthe points debated betwixt us and these heretics, who sow among the\nwheat the same tares which were formerly privily mingled with the good\nseed by the Albigenses and the Lollards. But it is not by reason alone\nthat you must hope to conquer these insinuations of the enemy: It is\nsometimes by timely resistance, but oftener by timely flight. You\nmust shut your ears against the arguments of the heresiarch, when\ncircumstances permit you not to withdraw the foot from his company.\nAnchor your thoughts upon the service of Our Lady, while he is expending\nin vain his heretical sophistry. Are you unable to maintain your\nattention on heavenly objects--think rather on thine own earthly\npleasures, than tempt Providence and the Saints by giving an attentive\near to the erring doctrine--think of thy hawk, thy hound, thine angling\nrod, thy sword and buckler--think even of Catherine Seyton, rather than\ngive thy soul to the lessons of the tempter. Alas! my son, believe not\nthat, worn out with woes, and bent more by affliction than by years, I\nhave forgotten the effect of beauty over the heart of youth. Even in\nthe watches of the night, broken by thoughts of an imprisoned Queen, a\ndistracted kingdom, a church laid waste and ruinous, come other thoughts\nthan these suggest, and feelings which belonged to an earlier and\nhappier course of life. Be it so--we must bear our load as we may: and\nnot in vain are these passions implanted in our breast, since, as now\nin thy case, they may come in aid of resolutions founded upon higher\ngrounds. Yet beware, my son--this Catherine Seyton is the daughter of\none of Scotland's proudest, as well as most worthy barons; and thy state\nmay not suffer thee, as yet, to aspire so high. But thus it is--Heaven\nworks its purposes through human folly; and Douglas's ambitious\naffection, as well as thine, shall contribute alike to the desired end.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow, my father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy suspicions are then true!--Douglas\nloves----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe does; and with a love as much misplaced as thine own; but beware of\nhim--cross him not--thwart him not.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet him not cross or thwart me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor I will not yield\nhim an inch of way, had he in his body the soul of every Douglas\nthat has lived since the time of the Dark Gray Man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d [Footnote: By an\nancient, though improbable tradition, the Douglasses are said to have\nderived their name from a champion who had greatly distinguished himself\nin an action. When the king demanded by whom the battle had been won,\nthe attendants are said to have answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSholto Douglas, sir;\u00e2\u0080\u009d which\nis said to mean, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYonder dark gray man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But the name is undoubtedly\nterritorial, and taken from Douglas river and vale.]\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, have patience, idle boy, and reflect that your suit can never\ninterfere with his.--But a truce with these vanities, and let us better\nemploy the little space which still remains to us to spend together. To\nthy knees, my son, and resume the long-interrupted duty of confession,\nthat, happen what may, the hour may find in thee a faithful Catholic,\nrelieved from the guilt of his sins by authority of the Holy Church.\nCould I but tell thee, Roland, the joy with which I see thee once more\nput thy knee to its best and fittest use! _Quid dicis, mi fili?_\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_Culpas meas_\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the youth; and according to the ritual of the\nCatholic Church, he confessed and received absolution, to which was\nannexed the condition of performing certain enjoined penances.\n\nWhen this religious ceremony was ended, an old man, in the dress of\na peasant of the better order, approached the arbour, and greeted the\nAbbot.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have waited the conclusion of your devotions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto\ntell you the youth is sought after by the chamberlain, and it were well\nhe should appear without delay. Holy Saint Francis, if the halberdiers\nwere to seek him here, they might sorely wrong my garden-plot--they are\nin office, and reck not where they tread, were each step on jessamine\nand clovegilly-flowers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will speed him forth, my brother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut alas! is it\npossible that such trifles should live in your mind at a crisis so awful\nas that which is now impending?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cReverend father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the proprietor of the garden, for such he\nwas, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow oft shall I pray you to keep your high counsel for high minds\nlike your own? What have you required of me, that I have not granted\nunresistingly, though with an aching heart?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would require of you to be yourself, my brother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot\nAmbrosius; \u00e2\u0080\u009cto remember what you were, and to what your early vows have\nbound you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI tell thee, Father Ambrosius,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the gardener, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe patience of\nthe best saint that ever said pater-noster, would be exhausted by the\ntrials to which you have put mine--What I have been, it skills not\nto speak at present-no one knows better than yourself, father, what I\nrenounced, in hopes to find ease and quiet during the remainder of\nmy days--and no one better knows how my retreat has been invaded, my\nfruit-trees broken, my flower-beds trodden down, my quiet frightened\naway, and my very sleep driven from my bed, since ever this poor Queen,\nGod bless her, hath been sent to Lochleven.--I blame her not; being a\nprisoner, it is natural she should wish to get out from so vile a hold,\nwhere there is scarcely any place even for a tolerable garden, and where\nthe water-mists, as I am told, blight all the early blossoms--I say, I\ncannot blame her for endeavouring for her freedom; but why I should be\ndrawn into the scheme--why my harmless arbours, that I planted with my\nown hands, should become places of privy conspiracy-why my little quay,\nwhich I built for my own fishing boat, should have become a haven for\nsecret embarkations--in short, why I should be dragged into matters\nwhere both heading and hanging are like to be the issue, I profess to\nyou, reverend father, I am totally ignorant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy brother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Abbot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are wise, and ought to know--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not--I am not--I am not wise,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the horticulturist,\npettishly, and stopping his ears with his fingers--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was never called\nwise but when men wanted to engage me in some action of notorious\nfolly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, my good brother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not good neither,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the peevish gardener; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am neither good\nnor wise--Had I been wise, you would not have been admitted here; and\nwere I good, methinks I should send you elsewhere to hatch plots for\ndestroying the quiet of the country. What signifies disputing about\nqueen or king,--when men may sit at peace--_sub umbra vitis sui?_ and so\nwould I do, after the precept of Holy Writ, were I, as you term me, wise\nor good. But such as I am, my neck is in the yoke, and you make me draw\nwhat weight you list.--Follow me, youngster. This reverend father, who\nmakes in his jackman's dress nearly as reverend a figure as I myself,\nwill agree with me in one thing at least, and that is, that you have\nbeen long enough here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFollow the good father, Roland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand remember my\nwords--a day is approaching that will try the temper of all true\nScotsmen--may thy heart prove faithful as the steel of thy blade!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe page bowed in silence, and they parted; the gardener,\nnotwithstanding his advanced age, walking on before him very briskly,\nand muttering as he went, partly to himself, partly to his companion,\nafter the manner of old men of weakened intellects--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I was great,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n thus ran his maundering, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand had my mule and my ambling palfrey at\ncommand, I warrant you I could have as well flown through the air\nas have walked at this pace. I had my gout and my rheumatics, and an\nhundred things besides, that hung fetters on my heels; and, now, thanks\nto Our Lady, and honest labour, I can walk with any good man of my age\nin the kingdom of Fife--Fy upon it, that experience should be so long in\ncoming!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs he was thus muttering, his eye fell upon the branch of a pear-tree\nwhich drooped down for want of support, and at once forgetting his\nhaste, the old man stopped and set seriously about binding it up.\nRoland Graeme had both readiness, neatness of hand, and good nature in\nabundance; he immediately lent his aid, and in a minute or two the bough\nwas supported, and tied up in a way perfectly satisfactory to the old\nman, who looked at it with great complaisance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are bergamots,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand if you will come ashore in autumn, you shall taste of\nthem--the like are not in Lochleven Castle--the garden there is a poor\npin-fold, and the gardener, Hugh Houkham, hath little skill of his\ncraft--so come ashore, Master Page, in autumn, when you would eat pears.\nBut what am I thinking of--ere that time come, they may have given thee\nsour pears for plums. Take an old man's advice, youth, one who hath seen\nmany days, and sat in higher places than thou canst hope for--bend thy\nsword into a pruning-hook, and make a dibble of thy dagger--thy days\nshall be the longer, and thy health the better for it,--and come to\naid me in my garden, and I will teach thee the real French fashion of\n_imping_, which the Southron call graffing. Do this, and do it without\nloss of time, for there is a whirlwind coming over the land, and only\nthose shall escape who lie too much beneath the storm to have their\nboughs broken by it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, he dismissed Roland Graeme, through a different door\nfrom that by which he had entered, signed a cross, and pronounced a\nbenedicite as they parted, and then, still muttering to himself, retired\ninto the garden, and locked the door on the inside.\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Twenty-Ninth.\n\n\n  Pray God she prove not masculine ere long!\n                        KING HENRY VI.\n\nDismissed from the old man's garden, Roland Graeme found that a grassy\npaddock, in which sauntered two cows, the property of the gardener,\nstill separated him from the village. He paced through it, lost in\nmeditation upon the words of the Abbot. Father Ambrosius had, with\nsuccess enough, exerted over him that powerful influence which the\nguardians and instructors of our childhood possess over our more mature\nyouth. And yet, when Roland looked back upon what the father had said,\nhe could not but suspect that he had rather sought to evade entering\ninto the controversy betwixt the churches, than to repel the objections\nand satisfy the doubts which the lectures of Henderson had excited.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor this he had no time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page to himself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cneither have I now\ncalmness and learning sufficient to judge upon points of such magnitude.\nBesides, it were base to quit my faith while the wind of fortune sets\nagainst it, unless I were so placed, that my conversion, should it take\nplace, were free as light from the imputation of self-interest. I was\nbred a Catholic--bred in the faith of Bruce and Wallace--I will hold\nthat faith till time and reason shall convince me that it errs. I\nwill serve this poor Queen as a subject should serve an imprisoned\nand wronged sovereign--they who placed me in her service have to blame\nthemselves--who sent me hither, a gentleman trained in the paths of\nloyalty and honour, when they should have sought out some truckling,\ncogging, double-dealing knave, who would have been at once the observant\npage of the Queen, and the obsequious spy of her enemies. Since I must\nchoose betwixt aiding and betraying her, I will decide as becomes her\nservant and her subject; but Catherine Seyton--Catherine Seyton, beloved\nby Douglas and holding me on or off as the intervals of her leisure or\ncaprice will permit--how shall I deal with the coquette?--By heaven,\nwhen I next have an opportunity, she shall render me some reason for her\nconduct, or I will break with her for ever!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs he formed this doughty resolution, he crossed the stile which led out\nof the little enclosure, and was almost immediately greeted by Dr. Luke\nLundin.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHa! my most excellent young friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfrom whence come\nyou?--but I note the place.--Yes, neighbour Blinkhoolie's garden is a\npleasant rendezvous, and you are of the age when lads look after a bonny\nlass with one eye, and a dainty plum with another. But hey! you look\nsubtriste and melancholic--I fear the maiden has proved cruel, or the\nplums unripe; and surely I think neighbour Blinkhoolie's damsons can\nscarcely have been well preserved throughout the winter--he spares the\nsaccharine juice on his confects. But courage, man, there are more Kates\nin Kinross; and for the immature fruit, a glass of my double distilled\n_aqua mirabilis--probatum est_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe page darted an ireful glance at the facetious physician; but\npresently recollecting that the name Kate, which had provoked his\ndispleasure, was probably but introduced for the sake of alliteration,\nhe suppressed his wrath, and only asked if the wains had been heard of?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, I have been seeking for you this hour, to tell you that the stuff\nis in your boat, and that the boat waits your pleasure. Auchtermuchty\nhad only fallen into company with an idle knave like himself, and a\nstoup of aquavitae between them. Your boatmen lie on their oars, and\nthere have already been made two wefts from the warder's turret to\nintimate that those in the castle are impatient for your return. Yet\nthere is time for you to take a slight repast; and, as your friend and\nphysician, I hold it unfit you should face the water-breeze with an\nempty stomach.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland Graeme had nothing for it but to return, with such cheer as he\nmight, to the place where his boat was moored on the beach, and resisted\nall offer of refreshment, although the Doctor promised that he should\nprelude the collation with a gentle appetizer--a decoction of herbs,\ngathered and distilled by himself. Indeed, as Roland had not forgotten\nthe contents of his morning cup, it is possible that the recollection\ninduced him to stand firm in his refusal of all food, to which such\nan unpalatable preface was the preliminary. As they passed towards the\nboat, (for the ceremonious politeness of the worthy Chamberlain would\nnot permit the page to go thither without attendance,) Roland Graeme,\namidst a group who seemed to be assembled around a party of wandering\nmusicians, distinguished, as he thought, the dress of Catherine Seyton.\nHe shook himself clear from his attendant, and at one spring was in\nthe midst of the crowd, and at the side of the damsel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCatherine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nwhispered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis it well for you to be still here?--will you not return to\nthe castle?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo the devil with your Catherines and your castles!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the\nmaiden, snappishly; \u00e2\u0080\u009chave you not had time enough already to get rid of\nyour follies? Begone! I desire not your farther company, and there will\nbe danger in thrusting it upon me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay--but if there be danger, fairest Catherine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Roland; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy\nwill you not allow me to stay and share it with you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIntruding fool,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the maiden, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe danger is all on thine own\nside--the risk in, in plain terms, that I strike thee on the mouth with\nthe hilt of my dagger.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, she turned haughtily from him,\nand moved through the crowd, who gave way in some astonishment at the\nmasculine activity with which she forced her way among them.\n\nAs Roland, though much irritated, prepared to follow, he was grappled\non the other side by Doctor Luke Lundin, who reminded him of the loaded\nboat, of the two wefts, or signals with the flag, which had been made\nfrom the tower, of the danger of the cold breeze to an empty stomach,\nand of the vanity of spending more time upon coy wenches and sour plums.\nRoland was thus, in a manner, dragged back to his boat, and obliged to\nlaunch her forth upon his return to Lochleven Castle.\n\nThat little voyage was speedily accomplished, and the page was\ngreeted at the landing-place by the severe and caustic welcome of old\nDryfesdale. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo, young gallant, you are come at last, after a delay of\nsix hours, and after two signals from the castle? But, I warrant, some\nidle junketing hath occupied you too deeply to think of your service\nor your duty. Where is the note of the plate and household stuff?--Pray\nHeaven it hath not been diminished under the sleeveless care of so young\na gad-about!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDiminished under my care, Sir Steward!\u00e2\u0080\u009d retorted the page angrily; \u00e2\u0080\u009csay\nso in earnest, and by Heaven your gray hair shall hardly protect your\nsaucy tongue!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA truce with your swaggering, young esquire,\u00e2\u0080\u009d returned the steward; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe\nhave bolts and dungeons for brawlers. Go to my lady, and swagger before\nher, if thou darest--she will give thee proper cause of offence, for she\nhas waited for thee long and impatiently.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd where then is the Lady of Lochleven?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor I\nconceive it is of her thou speakest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy--of whom else?\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Dryfesdale; \u00e2\u0080\u009cor who besides the Lady of\nLochleven hath a right to command in this castle?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Lady of Lochleven is thy mistress,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut mine\nis the Queen of Scotland.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe steward looked at him fixedly for a moment, with an air in which\nsuspicion and dislike were ill concealed by an affectation of contempt.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe bragging cock-chicken,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill betray himself by his rash\ncrowing. I have marked thy altered manner in the chapel of late--ay, and\nyour changing of glances at meal-time with a certain idle damsel, who,\nlike thyself, laughs at all gravity and goodness. There is something\nabout you, my master, which should be looked to. But, if you would\nknow whether the Lady of Lochleven, or that other lady, hath a right\nto command thy service, thou wilt find them together in the Lady Mary's\nante-room.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland hastened thither, not unwilling to escape from the ill-natured\npenetration of the old man, and marvelling at the same time what\npeculiarity could have occasioned the Lady of Lochleven's being in the\nQueen's apartment at this time of the afternoon, so much contrary to\nher usual wont. His acuteness instantly penetrated the meaning. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\nwishes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he concluded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto see the meeting betwixt the Queen and me\non my return, that she may form a guess whether there is any private\nintelligence or understanding betwixt us--I must be guarded.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith this resolution he entered the parlour, where the Queen, seated\nin her chair, with the Lady Fleming leaning upon the back of it, had\nalready kept the Lady of Lochleven standing in her presence for the\nspace of nearly an hour, to the manifest increase of her very visible\nbad humour. Roland Graeme, on entering the apartment, made a deep\nobeisance to the Queen, and another to the Lady, and then stood still as\nif to await their farther question. Speaking almost together, the Lady\nLochleven said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo, young man, you are returned at length?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd then stopped indignantly short, while the Queen went on without\nregarding her--\u00e2\u0080\u009cRoland, you are welcome home to us--you have proved the\ntrue dove and not the raven--Yet I am sure I could have forgiven you,\nif, once dismissed, from this water-circled ark of ours, you had never\nagain returned to us. I trust you have brought back an olive-branch, for\nour kind and worthy hostess has chafed herself much on account of\nyour long absence, and we never needed more some symbol of peace and\nreconciliation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI grieve I should have been detained, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the page; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut\nfrom the delay of the person intrusted with the matters for which I was\nsent, I did not receive them till late in the day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSee you there now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen to the Lady Lochleven; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe could not\npersuade you, our dearest hostess, that your household goods were in all\nsafe keeping and surety. True it is, that we can excuse your anxiety,\nconsidering that these august apartments are so scantily furnished, that\nwe have not been able to offer you even the relief of a stool during the\nlong time you have afforded us the pleasure of your society.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe will, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe will to offer such accommodation\nwas more wanting than the means.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, looking round, and affecting surprise, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere\nare then stools in this apartment--one, two--no less than four,\nincluding the broken one--a royal garniture!--We observed them not--will\nit please your ladyship to sit?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, madam, I will soon relieve you of my presence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Lady\nLochleven; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand while with you, my aged limbs can still better brook\nfatigue, than my mind stoop to accept of constrained courtesy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, Lady of Lochleven, if you take it so deeply,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen,\nrising and motioning to her own vacant chair, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would rather you\nassumed my seat--you are not the first of your family who has done so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Lady of Lochleven curtsied a negative, but seemed with much\ndifficulty to suppress the angry answer which rose to her lips.\n\nDuring this sharp conversation, the page's attention had been almost\nentirely occupied by the entrance of Catherine Seyton, who came from\nthe inner apartment, in the usual dress in which she attended upon the\nQueen, and with nothing in her manner which marked either the hurry or\nconfusion incident to a hasty change of disguise, or the conscious fear\nof detection in a perilous enterprise. Roland Graeme ventured to make\nher an obeisance as she entered, but she returned it with an air of the\nutmost indifference, which, in his opinion, was extremely\ninconsistent with the circumstances in which they stood towards each\nother.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cSurely,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he thought, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe cannot in reason expect to bully me\nout of the belief due to mine own eyes, as she tried to do concerning\nthe apparition in the hostelry of Saint Michael's--I will try if\nI cannot make her feel that this will be but a vain task, and that\nconfidence in me is the wiser and safer course to pursue.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThese thoughts had passed rapidly through his mind, when the Queen,\nhaving finished her altercation with the Lady of the castle, again\naddressed him--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat of the revels at Kinross, Roland Graeme? Methought\nthey were gay, if I may judge from some faint sounds of mirth and\ndistant music, which found their way so far as these grated windows,\nand died when they entered them, as all that is mirthful must--But\nthou lookest as sad as if thou hadst come from a conventicle of the\nHuguenots!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd so perchance he hath, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Lady of Lochleven, at\nwhom this side-shaft was lanched. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI trust, amid yonder idle fooleries,\nthere wanted not some pouring forth of doctrine to a better purpose than\nthat vain mirth, which, blazing and vanishing like the crackling of dry\nthorns, leaves to the fools who love it nothing but dust and ashes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMary Fleming,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, turning round and drawing her mantle\nabout her, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would that we had the chimney-grate supplied with a fagot\nor two of these same thorns which the Lady of Lochleven describes so\nwell. Methinks the damp air from the lake, which stagnates in these\nvaulted rooms, renders them deadly cold.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour Grace's pleasure shall be obeyed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady of Lochleven;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cyet may I presume to remind you that we are now in summer?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thank you for the information, my good lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor\nprisoners better learn their calender from the mouth of their jailor,\nthan from any change they themselves feel in the seasons.--Once more,\nRoland Graeme, what of the revels?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey were gay, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut of the usual sort, and\nlittle worth your Highness's ear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, you know not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow very indulgent my ear has\nbecome to all that speaks of freedom and the pleasures of the free.\nMethinks I would rather have seen the gay villagers dance their ring\nround the Maypole, than have witnessed the most stately masques within\nthe precincts of a palace. The absence of stone-wall--the sense that the\ngreen turf is under the foot which may tread it free and unrestrained,\nis worth all that art or splendour can add to more courtly revels.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI trust,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady Lochleven, addressing the page in her turn,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthere were amongst these follies none of the riots or disturbances to\nwhich they so naturally lead?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland gave a slight glance to Catherine Seyton, as if to bespeak her\nattention, as he replied,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI witnessed no offence, madam, worthy of\nmarking--none indeed of any kind, save that a bold damsel made her\nhand somewhat too familiar with the cheek of a player-man, and ran some\nhazard of being ducked in the lake.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs he uttered these words he cast a hasty glance at Catherine; but she\nsustained, with the utmost serenity of manner and countenance, the hint\nwhich he had deemed could not have been thrown out before her without\nexciting some fear and confusion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will cumber your Grace no longer with my presence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady\nLochleven, \u00e2\u0080\u009cunless you have aught to command me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNought, our good hostess,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cunless it be to pray\nyou, that on another occasion you deem it not needful to postpone your\nbetter employment to wait so long upon us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMay it please you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d added the Lady Lochleven, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto command this your\ngentleman to attend us, that I may receive some account of these matters\nwhich have been sent hither for your Grace's use?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe may not refuse what you are pleased to require, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the\nQueen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGo with the lady, Roland, if our commands be indeed necessary\nto thy doing so. We will hear to-morrow the history of thy Kinross\npleasures. For this night we dismiss thy attendance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland Graeme went with the Lady of Lochleven, who failed not to ask\nhim many questions concerning what had passed at the sports, to which he\nrendered such answers as were most likely to lull asleep any suspicions\nwhich she might entertain of his disposition to favour Queen Mary,\ntaking especial care to avoid all allusion to the apparition of Magdalen\nGraeme, and of the Abbot Ambrosius. At length, after undergoing a long\nand somewhat close examination, he was dismissed with such expressions,\nas, coming from the reserved and stern Lady of Lochleven, might seem to\nexpress a degree of favour and countenance.\n\nHis first care was to obtain some refreshment, which was more cheerfully\nafforded him by a good-natured pantler than by Dryfesdale, who was, on\nthis occasion, much disposed to abide by the fashion of Pudding-burn\nHouse, where\n\n  They who came not the first call.\n  Gat no more meat till the next meal.\n\nWhen Roland Graeme had finished his repast, having his dismissal from\nthe Queen for the evening, and being little inclined for such society\nas the castle afforded, he stole into the garden, in which he had\npermission to spend his leisure time, when it pleased him. In this\nplace, the ingenuity of the contriver and disposer of the walks had\nexerted itself to make the most of little space, and by screens, both\nof stone ornamented with rude sculpture, and hedges of living green, had\nendeavoured to give as much intricacy and variety as the confined limits\nof the garden would admit.\n\nHere the young man walked sadly, considering the events of the day,\nand comparing what had dropped from the Abbot with what he had himself\nnoticed of the demeanour of George Douglas. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt must be so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the\npainful but inevitable conclusion at which he arrived. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt must be by\nhis aid that she is thus enabled, like a phantom, to transport herself\nfrom place to place, and to appear at pleasure on the mainland or on\nthe islet.--It must be so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he repeated once more; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwith him she holds a\nclose, secret, and intimate correspondence, altogether inconsistent with\nthe eye of favour which she has sometimes cast upon me, and destructive\nto the hopes which she must have known these glances have necessarily\ninspired.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And yet (for love will hope where reason despairs) the\nthought rushed on his mind, that it was possible she only encouraged\nDouglas's passion so far as might serve her mistress's interest, and\nthat she was of too frank, noble, and candid a nature, to hold out\nto himself hopes which she meant not to fulfil. Lost in these various\nconjectures, he seated himself upon a bank of turf which commanded a\nview of the lake on the one side, and on the other of that front of the\ncastle along which the Queen's apartments were situated.\n\nThe sun had now for some time set, and the twilight of May was rapidly\nfading into a serene night. On the lake, the expanded water rose and\nfell, with the slightest and softest influence of a southern breeze,\nwhich scarcely dimpled the surface over which it passed. In the distance\nwas still seen the dim outline of the island of Saint Serf, once visited\nby many a sandalled pilgrim, as the blessed spot trodden by a man of\nGod--now neglected or violated, as the refuge of lazy priests, who had\nwith justice been compelled to give place to the sheep and the heifers\nof a Protestant baron.\n\nAs Roland gazed on the dark speck, amid the lighter blue of the waters\nwhich surrounded it, the mazes of polemical discussion again stretched\nthemselves before the eye of the mind. Had these men justly suffered\ntheir exile as licentious drones, the robbers, at once, and disgrace, of\nthe busy hive? or had the hand of avarice and rapine expelled from\nthe temple, not the ribalds who polluted, but the faithful priests who\nserved the shrine in honour and fidelity? The arguments of Henderson,\nin this contemplative hour, rose with double force before him; and could\nscarcely be parried by the appeal which the Abbot Ambrosius had made\nfrom his understanding to his feelings,--an appeal which he had felt\nmore forcibly amid the bustle of stirring life, than now when his\nreflections were more undisturbed. It required an effort to divert his\nmind from this embarrassing topic; and he found that he best succeeded\nby turning his eyes to the front of the tower, watching where a\ntwinkling light still streamed from the casement of Catherine Seyton's\napartment, obscured by times for a moment as the shadow of the fair\ninhabitant passed betwixt the taper and the window. At length the light\nwas removed or extinguished, and that object of speculation was also\nwithdrawn from the eyes of the meditative lover. Dare I confess the\nfact, without injuring his character for ever as a hero of romance?\nThese eyes gradually became heavy; speculative doubts on the subject of\nreligious controversy, and anxious conjectures concerning the state of\nhis mistress's affections, became confusedly blended together in\nhis musings; the fatigues of a busy day prevailed over the harassing\nsubjects of contemplation which occupied his mind, and he fell fast\nasleep.\n\nSound were his slumbers, until they were suddenly dispelled by the iron\ntongue of the castle-bell, which sent its deep and sullen sounds wide\nover the bosom of the lake, and awakened the echoes of Bennarty, the\nhill which descends steeply on its southern bank. Roland started up, for\nthis bell was always tolled at ten o'clock, as the signal for locking\nthe castle gates, and placing the keys under the charge of the\nseneschal. He therefore hastened to the wicket by which the garden\ncommunicated with the building, and had the mortification, just as he\nreached it, to hear the bolt leave its sheath with a discordant crash,\nand enter the stone groove of the door-lintel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHold, hold,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the\npage, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand let me in ere you lock the wicket.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The voice of Dryfesdale\nreplied from within, in his usual tone of embittered sullenness,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe hour is passed, fair master--you like not the inside of these\nwalls--even make it a complete holiday, and spend the night as well as\nthe day out of bounds.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOpen the door,\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the indignant page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cor by Saint Giles I will\nmake thy gold chain smoke for it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMake no alarm here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d retorted the impenetrable Dryfesdale, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut keep\nthy sinful oaths and silly threats for those that regard them--I do mine\noffice, and carry the keys to the seneschal.--Adieu, my young master!\nthe cool night air will advantage your hot blood.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe steward was right in what he said; for the cooling breeze was very\nnecessary to appease the feverish fit of anger which Roland experienced,\nnor did the remedy succeed for some time. At length, after some hasty\nturns made through the garden, exhausting his passion in vain vows of\nvengeance, Roland Graeme began to be sensible that his situation ought\nrather to be held as matter of laughter than of serious resentment. To\none bred a sportsman, a night spent in the open air had in it little of\nhardship, and the poor malice of the steward seemed more worthy of his\ncontempt than his anger. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would to God,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat the grim old\nman may always have contented himself with such sportive revenge. He\noften looks as he were capable of doing us a darker turn.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Returning,\ntherefore, to the turf-seat which he had formerly occupied, and which\nwas partially sheltered by a trim fence of green holly, he drew his\nmantle around him, stretched himself at length on the verdant settle,\nand endeavoured to resume that sleep which the castle bell had\ninterrupted to so little purpose.\n\nSleep, like other earthly blessings, is niggard of its favours when most\ncourted. The more Roland invoked her aid, the farther she fled from his\neyelids. He had been completely awakened, first, by the sounds of the\nbell, and then by his own aroused vivacity of temper, and he found\nit difficult again to compose himself to slumber. At length, when his\nmind--was wearied out with a maze of unpleasing meditation, he succeeded\nin coaxing himself into a broken slumber. This was again dispelled by\nthe voices of two persons who were walking in the garden, the sound of\nwhose conversation, after mingling for some time in the page's dreams,\nat length succeeded in awaking him thoroughly. He raised himself from\nhis reclining posture in the utmost astonishment, which the circumstance\nof hearing two persons at that late hour conversing on the outside of\nthe watchfully guarded Castle of Lochloven, was so well calculated to\nexcite. His first thought was of supernatural beings; his next, upon\nsome attempt on the part of Queen Mary's friends and followers; his last\nwas, that George of Douglas, possessed of the keys, and having the means\nof ingress and egress at pleasure, was availing himself of his office\nto hold a rendezvous with Catherine Seyton in the castle garden. He was\nconfirmed in this opinion by the tone of the voice, which asked in a low\nwhisper, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhether all was ready?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Thirtieth.\n\n\n  In some breasts passion lies conceal'd and silent,\n  Like war's swart powder in a castle vault,\n  Until occasion, like the linstock, lights it:\n  Then comes at once the lightning--and the thunder,\n  And distant echoes tell that all is rent asunder.\n                                 OLD PLAY.\n\nRoland Graeme, availing himself of a breach in the holly screen, and\nof the assistance of the full moon, which was now arisen, had a perfect\nopportunity, himself unobserved, to reconnoitre the persons and the\nmotions of those by whom his rest had been thus unexpectedly disturbed;\nand his observations confirmed his jealous apprehensions. They stood\ntogether in close and earnest conversation within four yards of the\nplace of his retreat, and he could easily recognize the tall form and\ndeep voice of Douglas, and the no less remarkable dress and tone of the\npage at the hostelry of Saint Michael's.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have been at the door of the page's apartment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Douglas, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut he\nis not there, or he will not answer. It is fast bolted on the inside, as\nis the custom, and we cannot pass through it--and what his silence may\nbode I know not.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have trusted him too far,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the other; \u00e2\u0080\u009ca feather-headed\ncox-comb, upon whose changeable mind and hot brain there is no making an\nabiding impression.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was not I who was willing to trust him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Douglas, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I was\nassured he would prove friendly when called upon--for----\u00e2\u0080\u009d Here he\nspoke so low that Roland lost the tenor of his words, which was the\nmore provoking, as he was fully aware that he was himself the subject of\ntheir conversation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the stranger, more aloud, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have on my side put him off\nwith fair words, which make fools vain--but now, if you distrust him at\nthe push, deal with him with your dagger, and so make open passage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat were too rash,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Douglas; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand besides, as I told you, the\ndoor of his apartment is shut and bolted. I will essay again to waken\nhim.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGraeme instantly comprehended, that the ladies, having been somehow made\naware of his being in the garden, had secured the door of the outer room\nin which he usually slept, as a sort of sentinel upon that only access\nto the Queen's apartments. But then, how came Catherine Seyton to\nbe abroad, if the Queen and the other lady were still within their\nchambers, and the access to them locked and bolted?--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will be\ninstantly at the bottom of these mysteries,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand then thank\nMistress Catherine, if this be really she, for the kind use which she\nexhorted Douglas to make of his dagger--they seek me, as I comprehend,\nand they shall not seek me in vain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDouglas had by this time re-entered the castle by the wicket, which was\nnow open. The stranger stood alone in the garden walk, his arms folded\non his breast, and his eyes cast impatiently up to the moon, as if\naccusing her of betraying him by the magnificence of her lustre. In\na moment Roland Graeme stood before him--\u00e2\u0080\u009cA goodly night,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMistress Catherine, for a young lady to stray forth in disguise, and to\nmeet with men in an orchard!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHush!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the stranger page, \u00e2\u0080\u009chush, thou foolish patch, and tell us\nin a word if thou art friend or foe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow should I be friend to one who deceives me by fair words, and who\nwould have Douglas deal with me with his poniard?\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Roland.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe fiend receive George of Douglas and thee too, thou born madcap and\nsworn marplot!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the other; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe shall be discovered, and then death\nis the word.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCatherine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have dealt falsely and cruelly with\nme, and the moment of explanation is now come--neither it nor you shall\nescape me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMadman!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the stranger, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am neither Kate nor Catherine--the moon\nshines bright enough surely to know the hart from the hind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat shift shall not serve you, fair mistress,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, laying\nhold on the lap of the stranger's cloak; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis time, at least, I will\nknow with whom I deal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnhand me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, endeavouring to extricate herself from his grasp;\nand in a tone where anger seemed to contend with a desire to laugh, \u00e2\u0080\u009cuse\nyou so little discretion towards a daughter of Seyton?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut as Roland, encouraged perhaps by her risibility to suppose his\nviolence was not unpardonably offensive, kept hold on her mantle,\nshe said, in a sterner tone of unmixed resentment,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cMadman! let me\ngo!--there is life and death in this moment--I would not willingly hurt\nthee, and yet beware!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs she spoke she made a sudden effort to escape, and, in doing so, a\npistol, which she carried in her hand or about her person, went off.\n\nThis warlike sound instantly awakened the well-warded castle. The warder\nblew his horn, and began to toll the castle bell, crying out at the same\ntime, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFie, treason! treason! cry all! cry all!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe apparition of Catherine Seyton, which the page had let loose in the\nfirst moment of astonishment, vanished in darkness; but the plash of\noars was heard, and, in a second or two, five or six harquebuses and a\nfalconet were fired from the battlements of the castle successively,\nas if levelled at some object on the water. Confounded with these\nincidents, no way for Catherine's protection (supposing her to be in the\nboat which he had heard put from the shore) occurred to Roland, save to\nhave recourse to George of Douglas. He hastened for this purpose\ntowards the apartment of the Queen, whence he heard loud voices and much\ntrampling of feet. When he entered, he found himself added to a confused\nand astonished group, which, assembled in that apartment, stood gazing\nupon each other. At the upper end of the room stood the Queen, equipped\nas for a journey, and--attended not only by the Lady Fleming, but by the\nomnipresent Catherine Seyton, dressed in the habit of her own sex, and\nbearing in her hand the casket in which Mary kept such jewels as she had\nbeen permitted to retain. At the other end of the hall was the Lady of\nLochleven, hastily dressed, as one startled from slumber by the sudden\nalarm, and surrounded by domestics, some bearing torches, others holding\nnaked swords, partisans, pistols, or such other weapons as they had\ncaught up in the hurry of a night alarm. Betwixt these two parties stood\nGeorge of Douglas, his arms folded on his breast, his eyes bent on\nthe ground, like a criminal who knows not how to deny, yet continues\nunwilling to avow, the guilt in which he has been detected.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSpeak, George of Douglas,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady of Lochleven; \u00e2\u0080\u009cspeak, and\nclear the horrid suspicion which rests on thy name. Say, 'A Douglas was\nnever faithless to his trust, and I am a Douglas.' Say this, my dearest\nson, and it is all I ask thee to say to clear thy name, even under, such\na foul charge. Say it was but the wile of these unhappy women, and this\nfalse boy, which plotted an escape so fatal to Scotland--so destructive\nto thy father's house.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said old Dryfesdale the steward, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis much do I say for this\nsilly page, that he could not be accessary to unlocking the doors, since\nI myself this night bolted him out of the castle. Whoever limned this\nnight-piece, the lad's share in it seems to have been small.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThou liest, Dryfesdale,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand wouldst throw the blame on\nthy master's house, to save the worthless life of a gipsy boy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHis death were more desirable to me than his life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the\nsteward, sullenly; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut the truth is the truth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt these words Douglas raised his head, drew up his figure to its full\nheight, and spoke boldly and sedately, as one whose resolution was\ntaken. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet no life be endangered for me. I alone----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDouglas,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, interrupting him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cart thou mad? Speak not, I\ncharge you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied, bowing with the deepest respect, \u00e2\u0080\u009cgladly would I\nobey your commands, but they must have a victim, and let it be the true\none.--Yes, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, addressing the Lady of Lochleven, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nalone am guilty in this matter. If the word of a Douglas has yet any\nweight with you, believe me that this boy is innocent; and on your\nconscience I charge you, do him no wrong; nor let the Queen suffer\nhardship for embracing the opportunity of freedom which sincere\nloyalty--which a sentiment yet deeper--offered to her acceptance. Yes!\nI had planned the escape of the most beautiful, the most persecuted of\nwomen; and far from regretting that I, for a while, deceived the malice\nof her enemies, I glory in it, and am most willing to yield up life\nitself in her cause.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow may God have compassion on my age,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady of Lochleven,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cand enable me to bear this load of affliction! O Princess, born in a\nluckless hour, when will you cease to be the instrument of seduction and\nof ruin to all who approach you? O ancient house of Lochleven, famed so\nlong for birth and honour, evil was the hour which brought the deceiver\nunder thy roof!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSay not so, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied her grandson; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe old honours of the\nDouglas line will be outshone, when one of its descendants dies for the\nmost injured of queens--for the most lovely of women.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDouglas,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmust I at this moment--ay, even at this\nmoment, when I may lose a faithful subject for ever, chide thee for\nforgetting what is due to me as thy Queen?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWretched boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the distracted Lady of Lochleven, \u00e2\u0080\u009chast thou\nfallen even thus far into the snare of this Moabitish woman?--hast thou\nbartered thy name, thy allegiance, thy knightly oath, thy duty to thy\nparents, thy country, and thy God, for a feigned tear, or a sickly\nsmile, from lips which flattered the infirm Francis--lured to death the\nidiot Darnley--read luscious poetry with the minion Chastelar--mingled\nin the lays of love which were sung by the beggar Rizzio--and which were\njoined in rapture to those of the foul and licentious Bothwell?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBlaspheme not, madam!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Douglas;--\u00e2\u0080\u009cnor you, fair Queen, and\nvirtuous as fair, chide at this moment the presumption of thy\nvassal!--Think not that the mere devotion of a subject could have moved\nme to the part I have been performing. Well you deserve that each of\nyour lieges should die for you; but I have done more--have done that to\nwhich love alone could compel a Douglas--I have dissembled. Farewell,\nthen, Queen of all hearts, and Empress of that of Douglas!--When you are\nfreed from this vile bondage--as freed you shall be, if justice remains\nin Heaven--and when you load with honours and titles the happy man\nwho shall deliver you, cast one thought on him whose heart would have\ndespised every reward for a kiss of your hand--cast one thought on his\nfidelity, and drop one tear on his grave.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And throwing himself at her\nfeet, he seized her hand, and pressed it to his lips.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis before my face!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the Lady of Lochleven--\u00e2\u0080\u009cwilt thou court\nthy adulterous paramour before the eyes of a parent?--Tear them asunder,\nand put him under strict ward! Seize him, upon your lives!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added,\nseeing that her attendants looked at each other with hesitation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are doubtful,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mary. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSave thyself, Douglas, I command thee!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe started up from the floor, and only exclaiming, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy life or death are\nyours, and at your disposal!\u00e2\u0080\u009d--drew his sword, and broke through those\nwho stood betwixt him and the door. The enthusiasm of his onset was too\nsudden and too lively to have been opposed by any thing short of the\nmost decided opposition; and as he was both loved and feared by his\nfather's vassals, none of them would offer him actual injury.\n\nThe Lady of Lochleven stood astonished at his sudden escape--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAm I\nsurrounded,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cby traitors? Upon him, villains!--pursue, stab,\ncut him down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe cannot leave the island, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dryfesdale, interfering; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nhave the key of the boat-chain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut two or three voices of those who pursued from curiosity, or command\nof their mistress, exclaimed from below, that he had cast himself into\nthe lake.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBrave Douglas still!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the Queen--\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, true and noble heart,\nthat prefers death to imprisonment!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFire upon him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady of Lochleven; \u00e2\u0080\u009cif there be here a true\nservant of his father, let him shoot the runagate dead, and let the lake\ncover our shame!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe report of a gun or two was heard, but they were probably shot rather\nto obey the Lady, than with any purpose of hitting the mark; and Randal\nimmediately entering, said that Master George had been taken up by a\nboat from the castle, which lay at a little distance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMan a barge, and pursue them!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt were quite vain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Randal; \u00e2\u0080\u009cby this time they are half way to\nshore, and a cloud has come over the moon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd has the traitor then escaped?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, pressing her hands\nagainst her forehead with a gesture of despair; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe honour of our\nhouse is for ever gone, and all will be deemed accomplices in this base\ntreachery.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLady of Lochleven,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mary, advancing towards her, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have this\nnight cut off my fairest hopes--You have turned my expected freedom\ninto bondage, and dashed away the cup of joy in the very instant I was\nadvancing it to my lips--and yet I feel for your sorrow the pity that\nyou deny to mine--Gladly would I comfort you if I might; but as I may\nnot, I would at least part from you in charity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAway, proud woman!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwho ever knew so well as thou\nto deal the deepest wounds under the pretence of kindness and\ncourtesy?--Who, since the great traitor, could ever so betray with a\nkiss?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLady Douglas of Lochleven,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin this moment thou canst\nnot offend me--no, not even by thy coarse and unwomanly language, held\nto me in the presence of menials and armed retainers. I have this night\nowed so much to one member of the house of Lochleven, as to cancel\nwhatever its mistress can do or say in the wildness of her passion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are bounden to you, Princess,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lady Lochleven, putting a strong\nconstraint on herself, and passing from her tone of violence to that\nof bitter irony; \u00e2\u0080\u009cour poor house hath been but seldom graced with royal\nsmiles, and will hardly, with my choice, exchange their rough honesty\nfor such court-honour as Mary of Scotland has now to bestow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Mary, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwho knew so well how to _take_, may think\nthemselves excused from the obligation implied in receiving. And that\nI have now little to offer, is the fault of the Douglasses and their\nallies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFear nothing, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Lady of Lochleven, in the same bitter\ntone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou retain an exchequer which neither your own prodigality can\ndrain, nor your offended country deprive you of. While you have fair\nwords and delusive smiles at command, you need no other bribes to lure\nyouth to folly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Queen cast not an ungratified glance on a large mirror, which,\nhanging on one side of the apartment, and illuminated by the\ntorch-light, reflected her beautiful face and person. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur hostess grows\ncomplaisant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy Fleming; we had not thought that grief and\ncaptivity had left us so well stored with that sort of wealth which\nladies prize most dearly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour Grace will drive this severe woman frantic,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Fleming, in\na low tone. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOn my knees I implore you to remember she is already\ndreadfully offended, and that we are in her power.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not spare her, Fleming,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Queen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is against my\nnature. She returned my honest sympathy with insult and abuse, and I\nwill gall her in return,--if her words are too blunt for answer, let her\nuse her poniard if she dare!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Lady Lochleven,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady Fleming aloud, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould surely do well\nnow to withdraw, and to leave her Grace to repose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cor to leave her Grace, and her Grace's minions,\nto think what silly fly they may next wrap their meshes about. My eldest\nson is a widower--were he not more worthy the flattering hopes with\nwhich you have seduced his brother?--True, the yoke of marriage has been\nalready thrice fitted on--but the church of Rome calls it a sacrament,\nand its votaries may deem it one in which they cannot too often\nparticipate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the votaries of the church of Geneva,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Mary, colouring with\nindignation, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas they deem marriage _no_ sacrament, are said at times\nto dispense with the holy ceremony.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--Then, as if afraid of the\nconsequences of this home allusion to the errors of Lady Lochleven's\nearly life, the Queen added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, my Fleming, we grace her too much\nby this altercation; we will to our sleeping apartment. If she would\ndisturb us again to-night, she must cause the door to be forced.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So\nsaying, she retired to her bed-room, followed by her two women.\n\nLady Lochleven, stunned as it were by this last sarcasm, and not the\nless deeply incensed that she had drawn it upon herself, remained like\na statue on the spot which she had occupied when she received an\naffront so flagrant. Dryfesdale and Randal endeavoured to rouse her to\nrecollection by questions.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is your honourable Ladyship's pleasure in the premises?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShall we not double the sentinels, and place one upon the boats and\nanother in the garden?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Randal.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWould you that despatches were sent to Sir William at Edinburgh, to\nacquaint him with what has happened?\u00e2\u0080\u009d demanded Dryfesdale; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand ought\nnot the place of Kinross to be alarmed, lest there be force upon the\nshores of the lake?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo all as thou wilt,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, collecting herself, and about\nto depart. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThou hast the name of a good soldier, Dryfesdale, take all\nprecautions.--Sacred Heaven! that I should be thus openly insulted!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWould it be your pleasure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dryfesdale, hesitating, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat this\nperson--this Lady--be more severely restrained?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, vassal!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Lady, indignantly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy revenge stoops not to\nso low a gratification. But I will have more worthy vengeance, or the\ntomb of my ancestors shall cover my shame!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you shall have it, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Dryfesdale--\u00e2\u0080\u009cere two suns go\ndown, you shall term yourself amply revenged.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Lady made no answer--perhaps did not hear his words, as she\npresently left the apartment. By the command of Dryfesdale, the rest of\nthe attendants were dismissed, some to do the duty of guard, others to\ntheir repose. The steward himself remained after they had all departed;\nand Roland Graeme, who was alone in the apartment, was surprised to see\nthe old soldier advance towards him with an air of greater cordiality\nthan he had ever before assumed to him, but which sat ill on his\nscowling features.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYouth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have done thee some wrong--it is thine own fault,\nfor thy behaviour hath seemed as light to me as the feather thou wearest\nin thy hat; and surely thy fantastic apparel, and idle humour of mirth\nand folly, have made me construe thee something harshly. But I saw this\nnight from my casement, (as I looked out to see how thou hadst disposed\nof thyself in the garden,) I saw, I say, the true efforts which thou\ndidst make to detain the companion of the perfidy of him who is no\nlonger worthy to be called by his father's name, but must be cut off\nfrom his house like a rotten branch. I was just about to come to thy\nassistance when the pistol went off; and the warder (a false knave, whom\nI suspect to be bribed for the nonce) saw himself forced to give the\nalarm, which, perchance, till then he had wilfully withheld. To atone,\ntherefore, for my injustice towards you, I would willingly render you a\ncourtesy, if you would accept of it from my hands.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMay I first crave to know what it is?\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the page.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSimply to carry the news of this discovery to Holyrood, where thou\nmayest do thyself much grace, as well with the Earl of Morton and the\nRegent himself, as with Sir William Douglas, seeing thou hast seen the\nmatter from end to end, and borne faithful part therein. The making\nthine own fortune will be thus lodged in thine own hand, when I trust\nthou wilt estrange thyself from foolish vanities, and learn to walk in\nthis world as one who thinks upon the next.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir Steward,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thank you for your courtesy, but I\nmay not do your errand. I pass that I am the Queen's sworn servant, and\nmay not be of counsel against her. But, setting this apart, methinks it\nwere a bad road to Sir William of Lochleven's favour, to be the first to\ntell him of his son's defection--neither would the Regent be over well\npleased to hear the infidelity of his vassal, nor Morton to learn the\nfalsehood of his kinsman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUm!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the steward, making that inarticulate sound which expresses\nsurprise mingled with displeasure. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, then, even fly where ye list;\nfor, giddy-pated as ye may be, you know how to bear you in the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will show you my esteem is less selfish than ye think for,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nthe page; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor I hold truth and mirth to be better than gravity and\ncunning--ay, and in the end to be a match for them.--You never loved me\nless, Sir Steward, than you do at this moment. I know you will give me\nno real confidence, and I am resolved to accept no false protestations\nas current coin. Resume your old course--suspect me as much and watch\nme as closely as you will, I bid you defiance--you have met with your\nmatch.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy Heaven, young man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the steward, with a look of bitter\nmalignity, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif thou darest to attempt any treachery towards the House of\nLochleven, thy head shall blacken in the sun from the warder's turret!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe cannot commit treachery who refuses trust,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand for\nmy head, it stands as securely on my shoulders, as on any turret that\never mason built.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFarewell, thou prating and speckled pie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dryfesdale, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat art\nso vain of thine idle tongue and variegated coat! Beware trap and\nlime-twig.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd fare thee well, thou hoarse old raven,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the page;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthy solemn flight, sable hue, and deep croak, are no charms against\nbird-bolt or hail-shot, and that thou mayst find--it is open war betwixt\nus, each for the cause of our mistress, and God show the right!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAmen, and defend his own people!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the steward. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will let my\nmistress know what addition thou hast made to this mess of traitors.\nGood night, Monsieur Featherpate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-night, Seignior Sowersby,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the page; and, when the old man\ndeparted, he betook himself to rest.\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Thirty-First.\n\n\n  Poison'd--ill fare!--dead, forsook, cast off!--\n                                  KING JOHN.\n\nHowever weary Roland Graeme might be of the Castle of Lochleven--however\nmuch he might wish that the plan for Mary's escape had been perfected,\nI question if he ever awoke with more pleasing feelings than on the\nmorning after George Douglas's plan for accomplishing her deliverance\nhad been frustrated. In the first place, he had the clearest conviction\nthat he had misunderstood the innuendo of the Abbot, and that the\naffections of Douglas were fixed, not on Catherine Seyton, but on the\nQueen; and in the second place, from the sort of explanation which had\ntaken place betwixt the steward and him, he felt himself at liberty,\nwithout any breach of honour towards the family of Lochleven, to\ncontribute his best aid to any scheme which should in future be formed\nfor the Queen's escape; and, independently of the good-will which he\nhimself had to the enterprise, he knew he could find no surer road to\nthe favour of Catherine Seyton. He now sought but an opportunity to\ninform her that he had dedicated himself to this task, and fortune was\npropitious in affording him one which was unusually favourable.\n\nAt the ordinary hour of breakfast, it was introduced by the steward with\nhis usual forms, who, as soon as it was placed on the board in the inner\napartment, said to Roland Graeme, with a glance of sarcastic import, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nleave you, my young sir, to do the office of sewer--it has been too long\nrendered to the Lady Mary by one belonging to the house of Douglas.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWere it the prime and principal who ever bore the name,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe office were an honour to him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe steward departed without replying to this bravade, otherwise than\nby a dark look of scorn. Graeme, thus left alone, busied himself as one\nengaged in a labour of love, to imitate, as well as he could, the\ngrace and courtesy with which George of Douglas was wont to render his\nceremonial service at meals to the Queen of Scotland. There was more\nthan youthful vanity--there was a generous devotion in the feeling with\nwhich he took up the task, as a brave soldier assumes the place of a\ncomrade who has fallen in the front of battle. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009ctheir only champion: and, come weal, come wo, I will be, to the best\nof my skill and power, as faithful, as trustworthy, as brave, as any\nDouglas of them all could have been.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this moment Catherine Seyton entered alone, contrary to her custom;\nand not less contrary to her custom, she entered with her kerchief\nat her eyes. Roland Graeme approached her with beating heart and with\ndown-cast eyes, and asked her, in a low and hesitating voice, whether\nthe Queen were well?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCan you suppose it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThink you her heart and body are\nframed of steel and iron, to endure the cruel disappointment of yester\neven, and the infamous taunts of yonder puritanic hag?--Would to God\nthat I were a man, to aid her more effectually!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf those who carry pistols, and batons, and poniards,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009care not men, they are at least Amazons; and that is as formidable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are welcome to the flash of your wit, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the damsel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nam neither in spirits to enjoy, nor to reply to it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009clist to me in all serious truth. And,\nfirst, let me say, that the gear last night had been smoother, had you\ntaken me into your counsels.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd so we meant; but who could have guessed that Master Page should\nchoose to pass all night in the garden, like some moon-stricken knight\nin a Spanish romance--instead of being in his bed-room, when Douglas\ncame to hold communication with him on our project.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd why,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdefer to so late a moment so important a\nconfidence?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause your communications with Henderson, and--with pardon--the\nnatural impetuosity and fickleness of your disposition, made us dread to\nentrust you with a secret of such consequence, till the last moment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd why at the last moment?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, offended at this frank\navowal; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy at that, or any other moment, since I had the misfortune to\nincur so much suspicion?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay--now you are angry again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand to serve you aright\nI should break off this talk; but I will be magnanimous, and answer your\nquestion. Know, then, our reason for trusting you was twofold. In the\nfirst place, we could scarce avoid it, since you slept in the room\nthrough which we had to pass. In the second place----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou may dispense with a second reason, when the\nfirst makes your confidence in me a case of necessity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood now, hold thy peace,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the second place, as\nI said before, there is one foolish person among us, who believes that\nRoland Graeme's heart is warm, though his head is giddy--that his blood\nis pure, though it boils too hastily--and that his faith and honour\nare true as the load-star, though his tongue sometimes is far less than\ndiscreet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis avowal Catherine repeated in a low tone, with her eye fixed on the\nfloor, as if she shunned the glance of Roland while she suffered it\nto escape her lips--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd this single friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the youth in\nrapture; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis only one who would do justice to the poor Roland Graeme,\nand whose own generous heart taught her to distinguish between follies\nof the brain and faults of the heart--Will you not tell me, dearest\nCatherine, to whom I owe my most grateful, my most heartfelt thanks?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine, with her eyes still fixed on the ground, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif your\nown heart tell you not----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDearest Catherine!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, seizing upon her hand, and kneeling\non one knee.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf your own heart, I say, tell you not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine, gently\ndisengaging her hand, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is very ungrateful; for since the maternal\nkindness of the Lady Fleming----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe page started on his feet. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy Heaven, Catherine, your tongue wears\nas many disguises as your person! But you only mock me, cruel girl.\nYou know the Lady Fleming has no more regard for any one, than hath the\nforlorn princess who is wrought into yonder piece of old figured court\ntapestry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt may be so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine Seyton, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut you should not speak so\nloud.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPshaw!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the page, but at the same time lowering his voice,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cshe cares for no one but herself and the Queen. And you know, besides,\nthere is no one of you whose opinion I value, if I have not your own.\nNo--not that of Queen Mary herself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe more shame for you, if it be so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine, with great\ncomposure.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, but, fair Catherine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy will you thus damp my\nardour, when I am devoting myself, body and soul, to the cause of your\nmistress?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is because in doing so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou debase a cause so\nnoble, by naming along with it any lower or more selfish motive. Believe\nme,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, with kindling eyes, and while the blood mantled on her\ncheek, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey think vilely and falsely of women--I mean of those who\ndeserve the name--who deem that they love the gratification of their\nvanity, or the mean purpose of engrossing a lover's admiration and\naffection, better than they love the virtue and honour of the man they\nmay be brought to prefer. He that serves his religion, his prince, and\nhis country, with ardour and devotion, need not plead his cause with the\ncommonplace rant of romantic passion--the woman whom he honours with his\nlove becomes his debtor, and her corresponding affection is engaged to\nrepay his glorious toil.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou hold a glorious prize for such toil,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the youth, bending his\neyes on her with enthusiasm.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly a heart which knows how to value it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe that\nshould free this injured Princess from these dungeons, and set her at\nliberty among her loyal and warlike nobles, whose hearts are burning\nto welcome her--where is the maiden in Scotland whom the love of such a\nhero would not honour, were she sprung from the blood royal of the land,\nand he the offspring of the poorest cottager that ever held a plough?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am determined,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto take the adventure. Tell me first,\nhowever, fair Catherine, and speak it as if you were confessing to the\npriest--this poor Queen, I know she is unhappy--but, Catherine, do you\nhold her innocent? She is accused of murder.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo I hold the lamb guilty, because it is assailed by the wolf?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n answered Catherine; \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo I hold yonder sun polluted, because an\nearth-damp sullies his beams?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe page sighed and looked down. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWould my conviction were as deep\nas thine! But one thing is clear, that in this captivity she hath\nwrong--She rendered herself up, on a capitulation, and the terms have\nbeen refused her--I will embrace her quarrel to the death!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you--will you, indeed?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine, taking his hand in her\nturn. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, be but firm in mind, as thou art bold in deed and quick in\nresolution; keep but thy plighted faith, and after ages shall honour\nthee as the saviour of Scotland!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut when I have toiled successfully to win that Leah, Honour, thou wilt\nnot, my Catherine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccondemn me to a new term of service\nfor that Rachel, Love?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine, again extricating her hand from his grasp,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwe shall have full time to speak; but Honour is the elder sister, and\nmust be won the first.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI may not win her,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the page; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I will venture fairly for\nher, and man can do no more. And know, fair Catherine,--for you shall\nsee the very secret thought of my heart,--that not Honour only--not\nonly that other and fairer sister, whom you frown on me for so much as\nmentioning--but the stern commands of duty also, compel me to aid the\nQueen's deliverance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou were wont to have doubts on that matter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, but her life was not then threatened,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Roland.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd is it now more endangered than heretofore?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Catherine Seyton,\nin anxious terror.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe not alarmed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut you heard the terms on which your\nroyal mistress parted with the Lady of Lochleven?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cToo well--but too well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine; \u00e2\u0080\u009calas! that she cannot rule\nher princely resentment, and refrain from encounters like these!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat hath passed betwixt them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor which woman never\nforgives woman. I saw the Lady's brow turn pale, and then black, when,\nbefore all the menzie, and in her moment of power, the Queen humbled her\nto the dust by taxing her with her shame. And I heard the oath of deadly\nresentment and revenge which she muttered in the ear of one, who by his\nanswer will, I judge, be but too ready an executioner of her will.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou terrify me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo not so take it--call up the masculine part of your spirit--we will\ncounteract and defeat her plans, be they dangerous as they may. Why do\nyou look upon me thus, and weep?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause you stand there before me a living and\nbreathing man, in all the adventurous glow and enterprise of youth, yet\nstill possessing the frolic spirits of childhood--there you stand, full\nalike of generous enterprise and childish recklessness; and if to-day,\nor to-morrow, or some such brief space, you lie a mangled and lifeless\ncorpse upon the floor of these hateful dungeons, who but Catherine\nSeyton will be the cause of your brave and gay career being broken short\nas you start from the goal? Alas! she whom you have chosen to twine your\nwreath, may too probably have to work your shroud!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd be it so, Catherine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, in the full glow of youthful\nenthusiasm; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand _do_ thou work my shroud! and if thou grace it with\nsuch tears as fall now at the thought, it will honour my remains more\nthan an earl's mantle would my living body. But shame on this faintness\nof heart! the time craves a firmer mood--Be a woman, Catherine, or\nrather be a man--thou canst be a man if thou wilt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCatherine dried her tears, and endeavoured to smile.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must not ask me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cabout that which so much disturbs\nyour mind; you shall know all in time--nay, you should know all now, but\nthat--Hush! here comes the Queen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMary entered from her apartment, paler than usual, and apparently\nexhausted by a sleepless night, and by the painful thoughts which had\nill supplied the place of repose; yet the languor of her looks was\nso far from impairing her beauty, that it only substituted the frail\ndelicacy of the lovely woman for the majestic grace of the Queen.\nContrary to her wont, her toilette had been very hastily despatched,\nand her hair, which was usually dressed by Lady Fleming with great care,\nescaping from beneath the headtire, which had been hastily adjusted,\nfell in long and luxuriant tresses of Nature's own curling, over a neck\nand bosom which were somewhat less carefully veiled than usual.\n\nAs she stepped over the threshold of her apartment, Catherine, hastily\ndrying her tears, ran to meet her royal mistress, and having first\nkneeled at her feet, and kissed her hand, instantly rose, and placing\nherself on the other side of the Queen, seemed anxious to divide with\nthe Lady Fleming the honour of supporting and assisting her. The page,\non his part, advanced and put in order the chair of state, which she\nusually occupied, and having placed the cushion and footstool for her\naccommodation, stepped back, and stood ready for service in the place\nusually occupied by his predecessor, the young Seneschal. Mary's\neye rested an instant on him, and could not but remark the change of\npersons. Hers was not the female heart which could refuse compassion, at\nleast, to a gallant youth who had suffered in her cause, although he\nhad been guided in his enterprise by a too presumptuous passion; and the\nwords \u00e2\u0080\u009cPoor Douglas!\u00e2\u0080\u009d escaped from her lips, perhaps unconsciously, as\nshe leant herself back in her chair, and put the kerchief to her eyes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, gracious madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine, assuming a cheerful manner,\nin order to cheer her sovereign, \u00e2\u0080\u009cour gallant Knight is indeed\nbanished--the adventure was not reserved for him; but he has left behind\nhim a youthful Esquire, as much devoted to your Grace's service, and\nwho, by me, makes you tender of his hand and sword.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf they may in aught avail your Grace,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme, bowing\nprofoundly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat needs this, Catherine?--why prepare new\nvictims to be involved in, and overwhelmed by, my cruel fortune?--were\nwe not better cease to struggle, and ourselves sink in the tide without\nfarther resistance, than thus drag into destruction with us every\ngenerous heart which makes an effort in our favour?--I have had but too\nmuch of plot and intrigue around me, since I was stretched an orphan\nchild in my very cradle, while contending nobles strove which should\nrule in the name of the unconscious innocent. Surely time it were that\nall this busy and most dangerous coil should end. Let me call my prison\na convent, and my seclusion a voluntary sequestration of myself from the\nworld and its ways.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSpeak not thus, madam, before your faithful servants,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cto discourage their zeal at once, and to break their hearts. Daughter\nof Kings, be not in this hour so unkingly--Come, Roland, and let us, the\nyoungest of her followers, show ourselves worthy of her cause--let us\nkneel before her footstool, and implore her to be her own magnanimous\nself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And leading Roland Graeme to the Queen's seat, they both kneeled\ndown before her. Mary raised herself in her chair, and sat erect, while,\nextending one hand to be kissed by the page, she arranged with the\nother the clustering locks which shaded the bold yet lovely brow of the\nhigh-spirited Catherine.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas! _ma mign\u00c3\u00b3ne_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, for so in fondness she often called her\nyoung attendant, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you should thus desperately mix with my unhappy\nfate the fortune of your young lives!--Are they not a lovely couple,\nmy Fleming? and is it not heart-rending to think that I must be their\nruin?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is we, gracious Sovereign, who will be\nyour deliverers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_Ex oribus parvulorum!_\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, looking upward; \u00e2\u0080\u009cif it is by\nthe mouth of these children that Heaven calls me to resume the stately\nthoughts which become my birth and my rights, thou wilt grant them thy\nprotection, and to me the power of rewarding their zeal!\u00e2\u0080\u009d--Then turning\nto Fleming, she instantly added,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cThou knowest, my friend, whether\nto make those who have served me happy, was not ever Mary's favourite\npastime. When I have been rebuked by the stern preachers of the\nCalvinistic heresy--when I have seen the fierce countenances of my\nnobles averted from me, has it not been because I mixed in the harmless\npleasures of the young and gay, and rather for the sake of their\nhappiness than my own, have mingled in the masque, the song, or the\ndance, with the youth of my household? Well, I repent not of it--though\nKnox termed it sin, and Morton degradation--I was happy, because I\nsaw happiness around me; and woe betide the wretched jealousy that can\nextract guilt out of the overflowings of an unguarded gaiety!--Fleming,\nif we are restored to our throne, shall we not have one blithesome day\nat a blithesome bridal, of which we must now name neither the bride\nnor the bridegroom? but that bridegroom shall have the barony of\nBlairgowrie, a fair gift even for a Queen to give, and that bride's\nchaplet shall be twined with the fairest pearls that ever were found\nin the depths of Lochlomond; and thou thyself, Mary Fleming, the best\ndresser of tires that ever busked the tresses of a Queen, and who would\nscorn to touch those of any woman of lower rank,--thou thyself shalt,\nfor my love, twine them into the bride's tresses.--Look, my Fleming,\nsuppose them such clustered locks as those of our Catherine, they would\nnot put shame upon thy skill.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, she passed her hand fondly over the head of her youthful\nfavourite, while her more aged attendant replied despondently, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas!\nmadam, your thoughts stray far from home.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey do, my Fleming,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut is it well or kind in you to\ncall them back?--God knows, they have kept the perch this night but too\nclosely--Come, I will recall the gay vision, were it but to punish them.\nYes, at that blithesome bridal, Mary herself shall forget the weight\nof sorrows, and the toil of state, and herself once more lead a\nmeasure.--At whose wedding was it that we last danced, my Fleming?\nI think care has troubled my memory--yet something of it I should\nremember--canst thou not aid me?--I know thou canst.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas! madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the lady----\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mary, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwilt thou not help us so far? this is a peevish\nadherence to thine own graver opinion, which holds our talk as folly.\nBut thou art court-bred, and wilt well understand me when I say,\nthe Queen _commands_ Lady Fleming to tell her where she led the last\n_branle_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith a face deadly pale, and a mien as if she were about to sink into\nthe earth, the court-bred dame, no longer daring to refuse obedience,\nfaltered out--\u00e2\u0080\u009cGracious Lady--if my memory err not--it was at a masque\nin Holyrood--at the marriage of Sebastian.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe unhappy Queen, who had hitherto listened with a melancholy smile,\nprovoked by the reluctance with which the Lady Fleming brought out her\nstory, at this ill-fated word interrupted her with a shriek so wild\nand loud that the vaulted apartment rang, and both Roland and Catherine\nsprang to their feet in the utmost terror and alarm. Meantime, Mary\nseemed, by the train of horrible ideas thus suddenly excited, surprised\nnot only beyond self-command, but for the moment beyond the verge of\nreason.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTraitress!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said to the Lady Fleming, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthou wouldst slay thy\nsovereign--Call my French guards--_a moi! a moi! mes Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais!_--I\nam beset with traitors in mine own palace--they have murdered my\nhusband--Rescue! rescue for the Queen of Scotland!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She started up from\nher chair--her features, late so exquisitely lovely in their paleness,\nnow inflamed with the fury of frenzy, and resembling those of a Bellona.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will take the field ourself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwarn the city--warn Lothian\nand Fife--saddle our Spanish barb, and bid French Paris see our petronel\nbe charged!--Better to die at the head of our brave Scotsmen, like our\ngrandfather at Flodden, than of a broken heart, like our ill-starred\nfather!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe patient--be composed, dearest Sovereign,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine: and then\naddressing Lady Fleming angrily, she added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow could you say aught\nthat reminded her of her husband?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe word reached the ear of the unhappy Princess, who caught it up,\nspeaking with great rapidity. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHusband!--what husband?--Not his most\nChristian Majesty--he is ill at ease--he cannot mount on horseback.--Not\nhim of the Lennox--but it was the Duke of Orkney thou wouldst say.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor God's love, madam, be patient!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady Fleming.\n\nBut the Queen's excited imagination could by no entreaty be diverted\nfrom its course. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBid him come hither to our aid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand\nbring with him his lambs, as he calls them--Bowton, Hay of Talla, Black\nOrmiston, and his kinsman Hob--Fie! how swart they are, and how they\nsmell of sulphur! What! closeted with Morton? Nay, if the Douglas and\nthe Hepburn hatch the complot together, the bird, when it breaks the\nshell, will scare Scotland. Will it not, my Fleming?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe grows wilder and wilder,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Fleming; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe have too many hearers\nfor these strange words.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRoland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin the name of God, begone! You cannot aid us\nhere--Leave us to deal with her alone--Away--away!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe thrust him to the door of the anteroom; yet even when he had entered\nthat apartment, and shut the door, he could still hear the Queen talk in\na loud and determined tone, as if giving forth orders, until at length\nthe voice died away in a feeble and continued lamentation.\n\nAt this crisis Catherine entered the anteroom. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBe not too anxious,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe crisis is now over; but keep the door fast--let no one enter\nuntil she is more composed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the name of God, what does this mean?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page; \u00e2\u0080\u009cor what was\nthere in the Lady Fleming's words to excite so wild a transport?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, the Lady Fleming, the Lady Fleming,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine, repeating the\nwords impatiently; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Lady Fleming is a fool--she loves her mistress,\nyet knows so little how to express her love, that were the Queen to ask\nher for very poison, she would deem it a point of duty not to resist\nher commands. I could have torn her starched head-tire from her formal\nhead--The Queen should have as soon had the heart out of my body, as the\nword Sebastian out of my lips--That that piece of weaved tapestry should\nbe a woman, and yet not have wit enough to tell a lie!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what was this story of Sebastian?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy Heaven,\nCatherine, you are all riddles alike!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are as great a fool as Fleming,\u00e2\u0080\u009d returned the impatient maiden;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cknow ye not, that on the night of Henry Darnley's murder, and at the\nblowing up of the Kirk of Field, the Queen's absence was owing to her\nattending on a masque at Holyrood, given by her to grace the marriage of\nthis same Sebastian, who, himself a favoured servant, married one of her\nfemale attendants, who was near to her person?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy Saint Giles,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wonder not at her passion, but only\nmarvel by what forgetfulness it was that she could urge the Lady Fleming\nwith such a question.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot account for it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut it seems as if great\nand violent grief and horror sometimes obscure the memory, and spread\na cloud like that of an exploding cannon, over the circumstances with\nwhich they are accompanied. But I may not stay here, where I came not to\nmoralize with your wisdom, but simply to cool my resentment against that\nunwise Lady Fleming, which I think hath now somewhat abated, so that I\nshall endure her presence without any desire to damage either her curch\nor vasquine. Meanwhile, keep fast that door--I would not for my life\nthat any of these heretics saw her in the unhappy state, which, brought\non her as it has been by the success of their own diabolical plottings,\nthey would not stick to call, in their snuffling cant, the judgment of\nProvidence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe left the apartment just as the latch of the outward door was\nraised from without. But the bolt which Roland had drawn on the inside,\nresisted the efforts of the person desirous to enter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho is there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said Graeme aloud.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is I,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the harsh and yet slow voice of the steward\nDryfesdale.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou cannot enter now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d returned the youth.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd wherefore?\u00e2\u0080\u009d demanded Dryfesdale, \u00e2\u0080\u009cseeing I come but to do my duty,\nand inquire what mean the shrieks from the apartment of the Moabitish\nwoman. Wherefore, I say, since such is mine errand, can I not enter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSimply,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the youth, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause the bolt is drawn, and I have no\nfancy to undo it. I have the right side of the door to-day, as you had\nlast night.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThou art ill-advised, thou malapert boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the steward, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto\nspeak to me in such fashion; but I shall inform my Lady of thine\ninsolence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe insolence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis meant for thee only, in fair guerdon\nof thy discourtesy to me. For thy Lady's information, I have answer more\ncourteous--you may say that the Queen is ill at ease, and desires to be\ndisturbed neither by visits nor messages.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI conjure you, in the name of God,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the old man, with more\nsolemnity in his tone than he had hitherto used, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto let me know if her\nmalady really gains power on her!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe will have no aid at your hand, or at your Lady's--wherefore,\nbegone, and trouble us no more--we neither want, nor will accept of, aid\nat your hands.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith this positive reply, the steward, grumbling and dissatisfied,\nreturned down stairs.\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Thirty-Second.\n\n\n  It is the curse of kings to be attended\n  By slaves, who take their humours for a warrant\n  To break into the bloody house of life,\n  And on the winking of authority\n  To understand a law.\n                          KING JOHN.\n\nThe Lady of Lochleven sat alone in her chamber, endeavouring with\nsincere but imperfect zeal, to fix her eyes and her attention on\nthe black-lettered Bible which lay before her, bound in velvet and\nembroidery, and adorned with massive silver clasps and knosps. But she\nfound her utmost efforts unable to withdraw her mind from the resentful\nrecollection of what had last night passed betwixt her and the Queen,\nin which the latter had with such bitter taunt reminded her of her early\nand long-repented transgression.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshould I resent so deeply that another reproaches\nme with that which I have never ceased to make matter of blushing\nto myself? and yet, why should this woman, who reaps--at least, has\nreaped--the fruits of my folly, and has jostled my son aside from the\nthrone, why should she, in the face of all my domestics, and of her own,\ndare to upbraid me with my shame? Is she not in my power? Does she not\nfear me? Ha! wily tempter, I will wrestle with thee strongly, and with\nbetter suggestions than my own evil heart can supply!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe again took up the sacred volume, and was endeavouring to fix her\nattention on its contents, when she was disturbed by a tap at the\ndoor of the room. It opened at her command, and the steward Dryfesdale\nentered, and stood before her with a gloomy and perturbed expression on\nhis brow.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat has chanced, Dryfesdale, that thou lookest thus?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nhis mistress--\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave there been evil tidings of my son, or of my\ngrandchildren?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, Lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Dryfesdale, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut you were deeply insulted last\nnight, and I fear me thou art as deeply avenged this morning--Where is\nthe chaplain?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat mean you by hints so dark, and a question so sudden? The chaplain,\nas you well know, is absent at Perth upon an assembly of the brethren.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI care not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the steward; \u00e2\u0080\u009che is but a priest of Baal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDryfesdale,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, sternly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat meanest thou? I have ever\nheard, that in the Low Countries thou didst herd with the Anabaptist\npreachers, those boars which tear up the vintage--But the ministry which\nsuits me and my house must content my retainers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would I had good ghostly counsel, though,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the steward, not\nattending to his mistress's rebuke, and seeming to speak to himself.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis woman of Moab----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSpeak of her with reverence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady; \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe is a king's\ndaughter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe it so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Dryfesdale; \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe goes where there is little\ndifference betwixt her and a beggar's child--Mary of Scotland is dying.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDying, and in my castle!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, starting up in alarm; \u00e2\u0080\u009cof what\ndisease, or by what accident?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBear patience, Lady. The ministry was mine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThine, villain and traitor!--how didst thou dare----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI heard you insulted, Lady--I heard you demand vengeance--I promised\nyou should have it, and I now bring tidings of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDryfesdale, I trust thou ravest?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI rave not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the steward. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat which was written of me a\nmillion of years ere I saw the light, must be executed by me. She hath\nthat in her veins that, I fear me, will soon stop the springs of life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cCruel villain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the Lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthou hast not poisoned her?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd\nif I had,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dryfesdale, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat does it so greatly merit? Men bane\nvermin--why not rid them of their enemies so? in Italy they will do it\nfor a cruizuedor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCowardly ruffian, begone from my sight!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThink better of my zeal, Lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the steward, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand judge not\nwithout looking around you. Lindesay, Ruthven, and your kinsman Morton,\nponiarded Rizzio, and yet you now see no blood on their embroidery--the\nLord Semple stabbed the Lord of Sanquhar--does his bonnet sit a jot more\nawry on his brow? What noble lives in Scotland who has not had a share,\nfor policy or revenge, in some such dealing?--and who imputes it to\nthem? Be not cheated with names--a dagger or a draught work to the\nsame end, and are little unlike--a glass phial imprisons the one, and a\nleathern sheath the other--one deals with the brain, the other sluices\nthe blood--Yet, I say not I gave aught to this lady.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat dost thou mean by thus dallying with me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady; \u00e2\u0080\u009cas thou\nwouldst save thy neck from the rope it merits, tell me the whole truth\nof this story-thou hast long been known a dangerous man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, in my master's service I can be cold and sharp as my sword. Be it\nknown to you, that when last on shore, I consulted with a woman of skill\nand power, called Nicneven, of whom the country has rung for some brief\ntime past. Fools asked her for charms to make them beloved, misers for\nmeans to increase their store; some demanded to know the future--an idle\nwish, since it cannot be altered; others would have an explanation\nof the past--idler still, since it cannot be recalled. I heard their\nqueries with scorn, and demanded the means of avenging myself of a\ndeadly enemy, for I grow old, and may trust no longer to Bilboa blade.\nShe gave me a packet--`Mix that,' said she, `with any liquid, and thy\nvengeance is complete.'\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVillain! and you mixed it with the food of this imprisoned Lady, to the\ndishonour of thy master's house?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo redeem the insulted honour of my master's house, I mixed the\ncontents of the packet with the jar of succory-water: They seldom fail\nto drain it, and the woman loves it over all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a work of hell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady Lochleven, \u00e2\u0080\u009cboth the asking and\nthe granting.--Away, wretched man, let us see if aid be yet too late!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey will not admit us, madam, save we enter by force--I have been.\ntwice at the door, but can obtain no entrance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will beat it level with the ground, if needful--And, hold--summon\nRandal hither instantly.--Randal, here is a foul and evil chance\nbefallen--send off a boat instantly to Kinross, the Chamberlain Luke\nLundin is said to have skill--Fetch off, too, that foul witch Nicneven;\nshe shall first counteract her own spell, and then be burned to ashes\nin the island of Saint Serf. Away, away--Tell them to hoist sail and ply\noar, as ever they would have good of the Douglas's hand!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMother Nicneven will not be lightly found, or fetched hither on these\nconditions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Dryfesdale.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen grant her full assurance of safety--Look to it, for thine own life\nmust answer for this lady's recovery.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI might have guessed that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dryfesdale, sullenly; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut it is\nmy comfort I have avenged mine own cause, as well as yours. She hath\nscoffed and scripped at me, and encouraged her saucy minion of a page to\nridicule my stiff gait and slow speech. I felt it borne in upon me that\nI was to be avenged on them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo to the western turret,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand remain there in\nward until we see how this gear will terminate. I know thy resolved\ndisposition--thou wilt not attempt escape.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot were the walls of the turret of egg-shells, and the lake sheeted\nice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dryfesdale. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am well taught, and strong in belief, that man\ndoes nought of himself; he is but the foam on the billow, which rises,\nbubbles, and bursts, not by its own effort, but by the mightier impulse\nof fate which urges him. Yet, Lady, if I may advise, amid this zeal for\nthe life of the Jezebel of Scotland, forget not what is due to thine own\nhonour, and keep the matter secret as you may.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, the gloomy fatalist turned from her, and stalked off with\nsullen composure to the place of confinement allotted to him.\n\nHis lady caught at his last hint, and only expressed her fear that the\nprisoner had partaken of some unwholesome food, and was dangerously ill.\nThe castle was soon alarmed and in confusion. Randal was dispatched to\nthe shore to fetch off Lundin, with such remedies as could counteract\npoison; and with farther instructions to bring mother Nicneven, if she\ncould be found, with full power to pledge the Lady of Lochleven's word\nfor her safety.\n\nMeanwhile the Lady of Lochleven herself held parley at the door of the\nQueen's apartment, and in vain urged the page to undo it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFoolish boy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthine own life and thy Lady's are at\nstake--Open, I say, or we will cause the door to be broken down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI may not open the door without my royal mistress's orders,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered\nRoland; \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe has been very ill, and now she slumbers--if you wake her by\nusing violence, let the consequence be on you and your followers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWas ever woman in a strait so fearful!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the Lady of\nLochleven--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt least, thou rash boy, beware that no one tastes the food,\nbut especially the jar of succory-water.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe then hastened to the turret, where Dryfesdale had composedly\nresigned himself to imprisonment. She found him reading, and demanded of\nhim, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWas thy fell potion of speedy operation?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSlow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the steward. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe hag asked me which I chose--I\ntold her I loved a slow and sure revenge. 'Revenge,' said I, 'is the\nhighest-flavoured draught which man tastes upon earth, and he should sip\nit by little and little--not drain it up greedily at once.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAgainst whom, unhappy man, couldst thou nourish so fell a revenge?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI had many objects, but the chief was that insolent page.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe boy!--thou inhuman man!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the lady; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat could he do to\ndeserve thy malice?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe rose in your favour, and you graced him with your commissions--that\nwas one thing. He rose in that of George Douglas's also--that was\nanother. He was the favourite of the Calvinistic Henderson, who hated\nme because my spirit disowns a separated priesthood. The Moabitish Queen\nheld him dear--winds from each opposing point blew in his favour--the\nold servitor of your house was held lightly among ye--above all, from\nthe first time I saw his face, I longed to destroy him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat fiend have I nurtured in my house!\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Lady. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMay God\nforgive me the sin of having given thee food and raiment!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou might not choose, Lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the steward. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLong ere this\ncastle was builded--ay, long ere the islet which sustains it reared its\nhead above the blue water, I was destined to be your faithful slave, and\nyou to be my ungrateful mistress. Remember you not when I plunged amid\nthe victorious French, in the time of this lady's mother, and brought\noff your husband, when those who had hung at the same breasts with him\ndared not attempt the rescue?--Remember how I plunged into the lake when\nyour grandson's skiff was overtaken by the tempest, boarded, and steered\nher safe to the land. Lady--the servant of a Scottish baron is he who\nregards not his own life, or that of any other, save his master. And,\nfor the death of the woman, I had tried the potion on her sooner,\nhad not Master George been her taster. Her death--would it not be the\nhappiest news that Scotland ever heard? Is she not of the bloody Guisian\nstock, whose sword was so often red with the blood of God's saints? Is\nshe not the daughter of the wretched tyrant James, whom Heaven cast\ndown from his kingdom, and his pride, even as the king of Babylon was\nsmitten?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPeace, villain!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady--a thousand varied recollections\nthronging on her mind at the mention of her royal lover's name; \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeace,\nand disturb not the ashes of the dead--of the royal, of the unhappy\ndead. Read thy Bible; and may God grant thee to avail thyself better of\nits contents than thou hast yet done!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She departed hastily, and as she\nreached the next apartment, the tears rose in her eyes so hastily, that\nshe was compelled to stop and use her kerchief to dry them. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI expected\nnot this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cno more than to have drawn water from the dry\nflint, or sap from a withered tree. I saw with a dry eye the apostacy\nand shame of George Douglas, the hope of my son's house--the child of my\nlove; and yet I now weep for him who has so long lain in his grave--for\nhim to whom I owe it that his daughter can make a scoffing and a jest of\nmy name! But she is _his_ daughter--my heart, hardened against her\nfor so many causes, relents when a glance of her eye places her father\nunexpectedly before me--and as often her likeness to that true daughter\nof the house of Guise, her detested mother, has again confirmed my\nresolution. But she must not--must not die in my house, and by so foul\na practice. Thank God, the operation of the potion is slow, and may be\ncounteracted. I will to her apartment once more. But oh! that hardened\nvillain, whose fidelity we held in such esteem, and had such high proof\nof! What miracle can unite so much wickedness and so much truth in one\nbosom!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Lady of Lochleven was not aware how far minds of a certain gloomy\nand determined cast by nature, may be warped by a keen sense of petty\ninjuries and insults, combining with the love of gain, and sense of\nself-interest, and amalgamated with the crude, wild, and indigested\nfanatical opinions which this man had gathered among the crazy sectaries\nof Germany; or how far the doctrines of fatalism, which he had embraced\nso decidedly, sear the human conscience, by representing our actions as\nthe result of inevitable necessity.\n\nDuring her visit to the prisoner, Roland had communicated to Catherine\nthe tenor of the conversation he had had with her at the door of the\napartment. The quick intelligence of that lively maiden instantly\ncomprehended the outline of what was believed to have happened, but her\nprejudices hurried her beyond the truth.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey meant to have poisoned us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she exclaimed in horror, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand there\nstands the fatal liquor which should have done the deed!--Ay, as soon\nas Douglas ceased to be our taster, our food was likely to be fatally\nseasoned. Thou, Roland, who shouldst have made the essay, wert readily\ndoomed to die with us. Oh, dearest Lady Fleming, pardon, pardon, for the\ninjuries I said to you in my anger--your words were prompted by Heaven\nto save our lives, and especially that of the injured Queen. But what\nhave we now to do? that old crocodile of the lake will be presently back\nto shed her hypocritical tears over our dying agonies.--Lady Fleming,\nwhat shall we do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOur Lady help us in our need!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied; \u00e2\u0080\u009chow should I\ntell?--unless we were to make our plaint to the Regent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMake our plaint to the devil,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine impatiently, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand accuse\nhis dam at the foot of his burning throne!--The Queen still sleeps--we\nmust gain time. The poisoning hag must not know her scheme has\nmiscarried; the old envenomed spider has but too many ways of mending\nher broken web. The jar of succory-water,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she--\u00e2\u0080\u009cRoland, if\nthou be'st a man, help me--empty the jar on the chimney or from the\nwindow--make such waste among the viands as if we had made our usual\nmeal, and leave the fragments on cup and porringer, but taste nothing\nas thou lovest thy life. I will sit by the Queen, and tell her at her\nwaking, in what a fearful pass we stand. Her sharp wit and ready spirit\nwill teach us what is best to be done. Meanwhile, till farther notice,\nobserve, Roland, that the Queen is in a state of torpor--that Lady\nFleming is indisposed--that character\u00e2\u0080\u009d (speaking in a lower tone) \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill\nsuit her best, and save her wits some labour in vain. I am not so much\nindisposed, thou understandest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou?\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Catherine, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are quite well--who thinks it worth while\nto poison puppy-dogs or pages?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoes this levity become the time?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the page.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt does, it does,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Catherine Seyton; \u00e2\u0080\u009cif the Queen approves, I\nsee plainly how this disconcerted attempt may do us good service.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe went to work while she spoke, eagerly assisted by Roland. The\nbreakfast table soon displayed the appearance as if the meal had been\neaten as usual; and the ladies retired as softly as possible into the\nQueen's sleeping apartment. At a new summons of the Lady Lochleven,\nthe page undid the door, and admitted her into the anteroom, asking her\npardon for having withstood her, alleging in excuse, that the Queen had\nfallen into a heavy slumber since she had broken her fast.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe has eaten and drunken, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady of Lochleven.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSurely,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009caccording to her Grace's ordinary custom,\nunless upon the fasts of the church.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe jar,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, hastily examining it, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is empty--drank the Lady\nMary the whole of this water?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA large part, madam; and I heard the Lady Catherine Seyton jestingly\nupbraid the Lady Mary Fleming with having taken more than a just share\nof what remained, so that but little fell to her own lot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd are they well in health?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady of Lochleven.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLady Fleming,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccomplains of lethargy, and looks duller\nthan usual; and the Lady Catherine of Seyton feels her head somewhat\nmore giddy than is her wont.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe raised his voice a little as he said these words, to apprise the\nladies of the part assigned to each of them, and not, perhaps, without\nthe wish of conveying to the ears of Catherine the page-like jest which\nlurked in the allotment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will enter the Queen's bedchamber,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady of Lochleven; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy\nbusiness is express.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs she advanced to the door, the voice of Catherine Seyton was heard\nfrom within--\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo one can enter here--the Queen sleeps.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not be controlled, young lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Lady of Lochleven;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is, I wot, no inner bar, and I will enter in your despite.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is, indeed, no inner bar,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Catherine, firmly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut there\nare the staples where that bar should be; and into those staples have I\nthrust mine arm, like an ancestress of your own, when, better employed\nthan the Douglasses of our days, she thus defended the bedchamber of\nher sovereign against murderers. Try your force, then, and see whether a\nSeyton cannot rival in courage a maiden of the house of Douglas.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI dare not attempt the pass at such risk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady of Lochleven:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStrange, that this Princess, with all that justly attaches to her\nas blameworthy, should preserve such empire over the minds of her\nattendants.--Damsel, I give thee my honour that I come for the Queen's\nsafety and advantage. Awaken her, if thou lovest her, and pray her leave\nthat I may enter--I will retire from the door the whilst.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThou wilt not awaken the Queen?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady Fleming.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat choice have we?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the ready-witted maiden, \u00e2\u0080\u009cunless you deem\nit better to wait till the Lady Lochleven herself plays lady of the\nbedchamber. Her fit of patience will not last long, and the Queen must\nbe prepared to meet her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut thou wilt bring back her Grace's fit by thus disturbing her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHeaven forbid!\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Catherine; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut if so, it must pass for an\neffect of the poison. I hope better things, and that the Queen will be\nable when she wakes to form her own judgment in this terrible crisis.\nMeanwhile, do thou, dear Lady Fleming, practise to look as dull and\nheavy as the alertness of thy spirit will permit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCatherine kneeled by the side of the Queen's bed, and, kissing her hand\nrepeatedly, succeeded at last in awakening without alarming her. She\nseemed surprised to find that she was ready dressed, but sate up in her\nbed, and appeared so perfectly composed, that Catherine Seyton, without\nfarther preamble, judged it safe to inform her of the predicament in\nwhich they were placed. Mary turned pale, and crossed herself again and\nagain, when she heard the imminent danger in which she had stood. But,\nlike the Ulysses of Homer,\n\n  --Hardly waking yet,\n  Sprung in her mind the momentary wit,\n\nand she at once understood her situation, with the dangers and\nadvantages that attended it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe cannot do better,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, after her hasty conference with\nCatherine, pressing her at the same time to her bosom, and kissing her\nforehead; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe cannot do better than to follow the scheme so happily\ndevised by thy quick wit and bold affection. Undo the door to the Lady\nLochleven--She shall meet her match in art, though not in perfidy.\nFleming, draw close the curtain, and get thee behind it--thou art a\nbetter tire-woman than an actress; do but breathe heavily, and, if thou\nwilt, groan slightly, and it will top thy part. Hark! they come. Now,\nCatherine of Medicis, may thy spirit inspire me, for a cold northern\nbrain is too blunt for this scene!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nUshered by Catherine Seyton, and stepping as light as she could, the\nLady Lochleven was shown into the twilight apartment, and conducted to\nthe side of the couch, where Mary, pallid and exhausted from a sleepless\nnight, and the subsequent agitation of the morning, lay extended so\nlistlessly as might well confirm the worst fears of her hostess.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, God forgive us our sins!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady of Lochleven, forgetting\nher pride, and throwing herself on her knees by the side of the bed; \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\nis too true--she is murdered!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho is in the chamber?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mary, as if awaking from a heavy\nsleep. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSeyton, Fleming, where are you? I heard a strange voice. Who\nwaits?--Call Courcelles.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas! her memory is at Holyrood, though her body is at\nLochleven.--Forgive, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued the Lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif I call your\nattention to me--I am Margaret Erskine, of the house of Mar, by marriage\nLady Douglas of Lochleven.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, our gentle hostess,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwho hath such care of our\nlodgings and of our diet--We cumber you too much and too long, good Lady\nof Lochleven; but we now trust your task of hospitality is well-nigh\nended.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHer words go like a knife through my heart,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady of\nLochleven--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith a breaking heart, I pray your Grace to tell me what is\nyour ailment, that aid may be had, if there be yet time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, my ailment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis nothing worth telling, or\nworth a leech's notice--my limbs feel heavy--my heart feels cold--a\nprisoner's limbs and heart are rarely otherwise--fresh air, methinks,\nand freedom, would soon revive me; but as the Estates have ordered it,\ndeath alone can break my prison-doors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWere it possible, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat your liberty could\nrestore your perfect health, I would myself encounter the resentment of\nthe Regent--of my son, Sir William--of my whole friends, rather than you\nshould meet your fate in this castle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas! madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady Fleming, who conceived the time propitious\nto show that her own address had been held too lightly of; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is but\ntrying what good freedom may work upon us; for myself, I think a free\nwalk on the greensward would do me much good at heart.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Lady of Lochleven rose from the bedside, and darted a penetrating\nlook at the elder valetudinary. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you so evil-disposed, Lady\nFleming?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEvil-disposed indeed, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the court dame, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand more\nespecially since breakfast.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHelp! help!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Catherine, anxious to break off a conversation\nwhich boded her schemes no good; \u00e2\u0080\u009chelp! I say, help! the Queen is about\nto pass away. Aid her, Lady Lochleven, if you be a woman!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Lady hastened to support the Queen's head, who, turning her eyes\ntowards her with an air of great languor, exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks, my dearest\nLady of Lochleven--notwithstanding some passages of late, I have never\nmisconstrued or misdoubted your affection to our house. It was proved,\nas I have heard, before I was born.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Lady Lochleven sprung from the floor, on which she had again knelt,\nand, having paced the apartment in great disorder, flung open the\nlattice, as if to get air.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, Our Lady forgive me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine to herself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow deep must\nthe love of sarcasm, be implanted in the breasts of us women, since the\nQueen, with all her sense, will risk ruin rather than rein in her wit!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n She then adventured, stooping over the Queen's person, to press her\narm with her hand, saying, at the same time, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor God's sake, madam,\nrestrain yourself!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThou art too forward, maiden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen; but immediately added,\nin a low whisper, \u00e2\u0080\u009cForgive me, Catherine; but when I felt the hag's\nmurderous hands busy about my head and neck, I felt such disgust and\nhatred, that I must have said something, or died. But I will be schooled\nto better behaviour--only see that thou let her not touch me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, God be praised!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady Lochleven, withdrawing her head\nfrom the window, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe boat comes as fast as sail and oar can send wood\nthrough water. It brings the leech and a female--certainly, from the\nappearance, the very person I was in quest of. Were she but well out of\nthis castle, with our honour safe, I would that she were on the top of\nthe wildest mountain in Norway; or I would I had been there myself, ere\nI had undertaken this trust.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhile she thus expressed herself, standing apart at one window, Roland\nGraeme, from the other, watched the boat bursting through the waters\nof the lake, which glided from its side in ripple and in foam. He, too,\nbecame sensible, that at the stern was seated the medical Chamberlain,\nclad in his black velvet cloak; and that his own relative, Magdalen\nGraeme, in her assumed character of Mother Nieneven, stood in the bow,\nher hands clasped together, and pointed towards the castle, and her\nattitude, even at that distance, expressing enthusiastic eagerness to\narrive at the landing-place. They arrived there accordingly, and while\nthe supposed witch was detained in a room beneath, the physician\nwas ushered to the Queen's apartment, which he entered with all due\nprofessional solemnity. Catherine had, in the meanwhile, fallen back\nfrom the Queen's bed, and taken an opportunity to whisper to Roland,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMethinks, from the information of the threadbare velvet cloak and the\nsolemn beard, there would be little trouble in haltering yonder ass. But\nthy grandmother, Roland--thy grandmother's zeal will ruin us, if she get\nnot a hint to dissemble.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland, without reply, glided towards the door of the apartment, crossed\nthe parlour, and safely entered the antechamber; but when he attempted\nto pass farther, the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cBack! Back!\u00e2\u0080\u009d echoed from one to the other, by\ntwo men armed with carabines, convinced him that the Lady of Lochleven's\nsuspicions had not, even in the midst of her alarms, been so far lulled\nto sleep as to omit the precaution of stationing sentinels on her\nprisoners. He was compelled, therefore, to return to the parlour, or\naudience-chamber, in which he found the Lady of the castle in conference\nwith her learned leech.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA truce with your cant phrase and your solemn foppery, Lundin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in such\nterms she accosted the man of art, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand let me know instantly, if thou\ncanst tell, whether this lady hath swallowed aught that is less than\nwholesome?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, but, good lady--honoured patroness--to whom I am alike bonds-man\nin my medical and official capacity, deal reasonably with me. If this,\nmine illustrious patient, will not answer a question, saving with sighs\nand moans--if that other honourable lady will do nought but yawn in\nmy face when I inquire after the diagnostics--and if that other young\ndamsel, who I profess is a comely maiden--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTalk not to me of comeliness or of damsels,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady of\nLochleven, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI say, are they evil-disposed?--In one word, man, have they\ntaken poison, ay or no?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPoisons, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the learned leech, \u00e2\u0080\u009care of various sorts. There\nis your animal poison, as the lepus marinus, as mentioned by Dioscorides\nand Galen--there are mineral and semi-mineral poisons, as those\ncompounded of sublimate regulus of antimony, vitriol, and the arsenical\nsalts--there are your poisons from herbs and vegetables, as the aqua\ncymbalariae, opium, aconitum, cantharides, and the like--there are\nalso--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, out upon thee for a learned fool! and I myself am no better for\nexpecting an oracle from such a log,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, but if your ladyship will have patience--if I knew what food they\nhave partaken of, or could see but the remnants of what they have last\neaten--for as to the external and internal symptoms, I can discover\nnought like; for, as Galen saith in his second book _de Antidotis_--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAway, fool!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady; \u00e2\u0080\u009csend me that hag hither; she shall\navouch what it was that she hath given to the wretch Dryfesdale, or the\npilniewinks and thumbikins shall wrench it out of her finger joints!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cArt hath no enemy unless the ignorant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the mortified Doctor;\nveiling, however, his remark under the Latin version, and stepping apart\ninto a corner to watch the result.\n\nIn a minute or two Magdalen Graeme entered the apartment, dressed as we\nhave described her at the revel, but with her muffler thrown back, and\nall affectation of disguise. She was attended by two guards, of whose\npresence she did not seem even to be conscious, and who followed her\nwith an air of embarrassment and timidity, which was probably owing to\ntheir belief in her supernatural power, coupled with the effect\nproduced by her bold and undaunted demeanour. She confronted the Lady of\nLochleven, who seemed to endure with high disdain the confidence of her\nair and manner.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWretched woman!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, after essaying for a moment to bear\nher down, before she addressed her, by the stately severity of her look,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat was that powder which thou didst give to a servant of this house,\nby name Jasper Dryfesdale, that he might work out with it some slow and\nsecret vengeance?--Confess its nature and properties, or, by the honour\nof Douglas, I give thee to fire and stake before the sun is lower!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Magdalen Graeme in reply, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand when became a Douglas or a\nDouglas's man so unfurnished in his revenge, that he should seek them\nat the hands of a poor and solitary woman? The towers in which your\ncaptives pine away into unpitied graves, yet stand fast on their\nfoundation--the crimes wrought in them have not yet burst their\nvaults asunder--your men have still their cross-bows, pistolets, and\ndaggers--why need you seek to herbs or charms for the execution of your\nrevenges?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHear me, foul hag,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady Lochleven,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cbut what avails speaking\nto thee?--Bring Dryfesdale hither, and let them be confronted together.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may spare your retainers the labour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Magdalen Graeme.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI came not here to be confronted with a base groom, nor to answer the\ninterrogatories of James's heretical leman--I came to speak with the\nQueen of Scotland--Give place there!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd while the Lady Lochleven stood confounded at her boldness, and at\nthe reproach she had cast upon her, Magdalen Graeme strode past her\ninto the bedchamber of the Queen, and, kneeling on the floor, made a\nsalutation as if, in the Oriental fashion, she meant to touch the earth\nwith her forehead.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHail, Princess!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009chail, daughter of many a King, but\ngraced above them all in that thou art called to suffer for the true\nfaith--hail to thee, the pure gold of whose crown has been tried in the\nseven-times heated furnace of affliction--hear the comfort which God\nand Our Lady send thee by the mouth of thy unworthy servant.--But\nfirst\u00e2\u0080\u009d--and stooping her head she crossed herself repeatedly, and,\nstill upon her knees, appeared to be rapidly reciting some formula of\ndevotion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSeize her, and drag her to the massy-more!--to the deepest dungeon with\nthe sorceress, whose master, the Devil, could alone have inspired her\nwith boldness enough to insult the mother of Douglas in his own castle!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThus spoke the incensed Lady of Lochleven, but the physician presumed to\ninterpose.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI pray of you, honoured madam, she be permitted to take her course\nwithout interruption. Peradventure we shall learn something concerning\nthe nostrum she hath ventured, contrary to law and the rules of art, to\nadhibit to these ladies, through the medium of the steward Dryfesdale.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor a fool,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Lady of Lochleven, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthou hast counselled\nwisely--I will bridle my resentment till their conference be over.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGod forbid, honoured Lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Doctor Lundin, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you should\nsuppress it longer--nothing may more endanger the frame of your honoured\nbody; and truly, if there be witchcraft in this matter, it is held by\nthe vulgar, and even by solid authors on Demonology, that three scruples\nof the ashes of the witch, when she hath been well and carefully burned\nat a stake, is a grand Catholicon in such matter, even as they prescribe\n_crinis canis rabidi_, a hair of the dog that bit the patient, in cases\nof hydrophobia. I warrant neither treatment, being out of the regular\npractice of the schools; but, in the present case, there can be\nlittle harm in trying the conclusion upon this old necromancer and\nquacksalver-_fiat experimentum_ (as we say) _in corpore vili_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPeace, fool!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe is about to speak.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt that moment Magdalen Graeme arose from her knees, and turned her\ncountenance on the Queen, at the same time advancing her foot, extending\nher arm, and assuming the mien and attitude of a Sibyl in frenzy. As her\ngray hair floated back from beneath her coif, and her eye gleamed fire\nfrom under its shaggy eyebrow, the effect of her expressive though\nemaciated features, was heightened by an enthusiasm approaching to\ninsanity, and her appearance struck with awe all who were present. Her\neyes for a time glanced wildly around as if seeking for something to aid\nher in collecting her powers of expression, and her lips had a nervous\nand quivering motion, as those of one who would fain speak, yet rejects\nas inadequate the words which present themselves. Mary herself caught\nthe infection as if by a sort of magnetic influence, and raising herself\nfrom her bed, without being able to withdraw her eyes from those of\nMagdalen, waited as if for the oracle of a Pythoness. She waited not\nlong, for no sooner had the enthusiast collected herself, than her gaze\nbecame instantly steady, her features assumed a determined energy,\nand when she began to speak, the words flowed from her with a profuse\nfluency, which might have passed for inspiration, and which, perhaps,\nshe herself mistook for such.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cArise,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cQueen of France and of England! Arise, Lioness\nof Scotland, and be not dismayed though the nets of the hunters have\nencircled thee! Stoop not to feign with the false ones, whom thou shall\nsoon meet in the field. The issue of battle is with the God of armies,\nbut by battle thy cause shall be tried. Lay aside, then, the arts of\nlower mortals, and assume those which become a Queen! True defender of\nthe only true faith, the armoury of heaven is open to thee! Faithful\ndaughter of the Church, take the keys of St. Peter, to bind and to\nloose!--Royal Princess of the land, take the sword of St. Paul, to\nsmite and to shear! There is darkness in thy destiny;--but not in these\ntowers, not under the rule of their haughty mistress, shall that destiny\nbe closed--In other lands the lioness may crouch to the power of the\ntigress, but not in her own--not in Scotland shall the Queen of Scotland\nlong remain captive--nor is the fate of the royal Stuart in the hands\nof the traitor Douglas. Let the Lady of Lochleven double her bolts and\ndeepen her dungeons, they shall not retain thee--each element shall give\nthee its assistance ere thou shalt continue captive--the land shall lend\nits earthquakes, the water its waves, the air its tempests, the fire its\ndevouring flames, to desolate this house, rather than it shall continue\nthe place of thy captivity.--Hear this, and tremble, all ye who fight\nagainst the light, for she says it, to whom it hath been assured!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe was silent, and the astonished physician said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf there was ever\nan _Energumene,_ or possessed demoniac, in our days, there is a devil\nspeaking with that woman's tongue!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPractice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady of Lochleven, recovering her surprise; \u00e2\u0080\u009chere\nis all practice and imposture--To the dungeon with her!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLady of Lochleven,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mary, arising from her bed, and coming\nforward with her wonted dignity, \u00e2\u0080\u009cere you make arrest on any one in our\npresence, hear me but one word. I have done you some wrong--I believed\nyou privy to the murderous purpose of your vassal, and I deceived you in\nsuffering you to believe it had taken effect. I did you wrong, Lady of\nLochleven, for I perceive your purpose to aid me was sincere. We tasted\nnot of the liquid, nor are we now sick, save that we languish for our\nfreedom.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is avowed like Mary of Scotland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Magdalen Graeme; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand know,\nbesides, that had the Queen drained the drought to the dregs, it was\nharmless as the water from a sainted spring. Trow ye, proud woman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nadded, addressing herself to the Lady of Lochleven, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I--I--would\nhave been the wretch to put poison into the hands of a servant or vassal\nof the house of Lochleven, knowing whom that house contained? as soon\nwould I have furnished drug to slay my own daughter!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAm I thus bearded in mine own castle?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady; \u00e2\u0080\u009cto the dungeon\nwith her!--she shall abye what is due to the vender of poisons and\npractiser of witchcraft.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYet hear me for an instant, Lady of Lochleven,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mary; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand do\nyou,\u00e2\u0080\u009d to Magdalen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbe silent at my command.--Your steward, lady, has by\nconfession attempted my life, and those of my household, and this\nwoman hath done her best to save them, by furnishing him with what was\nharmless, in place of the fatal drugs which he expected. Methinks I\npropose to you but a fair exchange when I say I forgive your vassal with\nall my heart, and leave vengeance to God, and to his conscience, so that\nyou also forgive the boldness of this woman in your presence; for we\ntrust you do not hold it as a crime, that she substituted an innocent\nbeverage for the mortal poison which was to have drenched our cup.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHeaven forfend, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I should account that a\ncrime which saved the house of Douglas from a foul breach of honour and\nhospitality! We have written to our son touching our vassal's delict,\nand he must abide his doom, which will most likely be death. Touching\nthis woman, her trade is damnable by Scripture, and is mortally punished\nby the wise laws of our ancestry--she also must abide her doom.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd have I then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cno claim on the house of Lochleven\nfor the wrong I have so nearly suffered within their walls? I ask but in\nrequital, the life of a frail and aged woman, whose brain, as yourself\nmay judge, seems somewhat affected by years and suffering.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf the Lady Mary,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the inflexible Lady of Lochleven, \u00e2\u0080\u009chath been\nmenaced with wrong in the house of Douglas, it may be regarded as some\ncompensation, that her complots have cost that house the exile of a\nvalued son.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPlead no more for me, my gracious Sovereign,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Magdalen Graeme,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cnor abase yourself to ask so much as a gray hair of my head at her\nhands. I knew the risk at which I served my Church and my Queen, and was\never prompt to pay my poor life as the ransom. It is a comfort to think,\nthat in slaying me, or in restraining my freedom, or even in injuring\nthat single gray hair, the house, whose honour she boasts so highly,\nwill have filled up the measure of their shame by the breach of their\nsolemn written assurance of safety.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--And taking from her bosom a paper,\nshe handed it to the Queen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a solemn assurance of safety in life and limb,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Queen Mary,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwith space to come and go, under the hand and seal of the Chamberlain\nof Kinross, granted to Magdalen Graeme, commonly called Mother Nicneven,\nin consideration of her consenting to put herself, for the space of\ntwenty-four hours, if required, within the iron gate of the Castle of\nLochleven.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cKnave!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, turning to the Chamberlain, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow dared you grant\nher such a protection?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was by your Ladyship's orders, transmitted by Randal, as he can\nbear witness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Doctor Lundin; \u00e2\u0080\u009cnay, I am only like the\npharmacopolist, who compounds the drugs after the order of the\nmediciner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI remember--I remember,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Lady; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I meant the assurance\nonly to be used in case, by residing in another jurisdiction, she could\nnot have been apprehended under our warrant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNevertheless,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Lady of Lochleven is bound by the\naction of her deputy in granting the assurance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe house of Douglas have never broken\ntheir safe-conduct, and never will--too deeply did they suffer by such\na breach of trust, exercised on themselves, when your Grace's ancestor,\nthe second James, in defiance of the rights of hospitality, and of his\nown written assurance of safety, poniarded the brave Earl of Douglas\nwith his own hand, and within two yards of the social board, at which he\nhad just before sat the King of Scotland's honoured guest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMethinks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, carelessly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin consideration of so very\nrecent and enormous a tragedy, which I think only chanced some six-score\nyears agone, the Douglasses should have shown themselves less tenacious\nof the company of their sovereigns, than you, Lady of Lochleven, seem to\nbe of mine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet Randal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009ctake the hag back to Kinross, and set her\nat full liberty, discharging her from our bounds in future, on peril of\nher head.--And let your wisdom,\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the Chamberlain, \u00e2\u0080\u009ckeep her company.\nAnd fear not for your character, though I send you in such company; for,\ngranting her to be a witch, it would be a waste of fagots to burn you\nfor a wizard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe crest-fallen Chamberlain was preparing to depart; but Magdalen\nGraeme, collecting herself, was about to reply, when the Queen\ninterposed, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood mother, we heartily thank you for your\nunfeigned zeal towards our person, and pray you, as our liege-woman,\nthat you abstain from whatever may lead you into personal danger; and,\nfarther, it is our will that you depart without a word of farther parley\nwith any one in this castle. For thy present guerdon, take this small\nreliquary--it was given to us by our uncle the Cardinal, and hath had\nthe benediction of the Holy Father himself;--and now depart in peace and\nin silence.--For you, learned sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued the Queen, advancing to\nthe Doctor, who made his reverence in a manner doubly embarrassed by the\nawe of the Queen's presence, which made him fear to do too little, and\nby the apprehension of his lady's displeasure, in case he should chance\nto do too much--\u00e2\u0080\u009cfor you, learned sir, as it was not your fault, though\nsurely our own good fortune, that we did not need your skill at this\ntime, it would not become us, however circumstanced, to suffer our leech\nto leave us without such guerdon as we can offer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith these words, and with the grace which never forsook her, though,\nin the present case, there might lurk under it a little gentle ridicule,\nshe offered a small embroidered purse to the Chamberlain, who, with\nextended hand and arched back, his learned face stooping until a\nphysiognomist might have practised the metoposcopical science upon it,\nas seen from behind betwixt his gambadoes, was about to accept of the\nprofessional recompense offered by so fair as well as illustrious a\nhand. But the Lady interposed, and, regarding the Chamberlain, said\naloud, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo servant of our house, without instantly relinquishing that\ncharacter, and incurring withal our highest displeasure, shall dare\nreceive any gratuity at the hand of the Lady Mary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSadly and slowly the Chamberlain raised his depressed stature into the\nperpendicular attitude, and left the apartment dejectedly, followed by\nMagdalen Graeme, after, with mute but expressive gesture, she had kissed\nthe reliquary with which the Queen had presented her, and, raising her\nclasped hands and uplifted eyes towards Heaven, had seemed to entreat\na benediction upon the royal dame. As she left the castle, and\nwent towards the quay where the boat lay, Roland Graeme, anxious to\ncommunicate with her if possible, threw himself in her way, and might\nhave succeeded in exchanging a few words with her, as she was guarded\nonly by the dejected Chamberlain and his halberdiers, but she seemed to\nhave taken, in its most strict and literal acceptation, the command to\nbe silent which she had received from the Queen; for, to the repeated\nsigns of her grandson, she only replied by laying her finger on her lip.\nDr. Lundin was not so reserved. Regret for the handsome gratuity, and\nfor the compulsory task of self-denial imposed on him, had grieved the\nspirit of that worthy officer and learned mediciner--\u00e2\u0080\u009cEven thus, my\nfriend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, squeezing the page's hand as he bade him farewell, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis\nmerit rewarded. I came to cure this unhappy Lady--and I profess she well\ndeserves the trouble, for, say what they will of her, she hath a most\nwinning manner, a sweet voice, a gracious smile, and a most majestic\nwave of her hand. If she was not poisoned, say, my dear Master Roland,\nwas that fault of mine, I being ready to cure her if she had?--and now I\nam denied the permission to accept my well-earned honorarium--O Galen! O\nHippocrates! is the graduate's cap and doctor's scarlet brought to this\npass! _Frustra fatigamus remediis aegros!_\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe wiped his eyes, stepped on the gunwale, and the boat pushed off from\nthe shore, and went merrily across the lake, which was dimpled by the\nsummer wind. [Footnote: A romancer, to use a Scottish phrase, wants but\na hair to make a tether of. The whole detail of the steward's supposed\nconspiracy against the life of Mary, is grounded upon an expression in\none of her letters, which affirms, that Jasper Dryfesdale, one of the\nLaird of Lochleven's servants, had threatened to murder William Douglas,\n(for his share in the Queen's escape,) and averred that he would plant a\ndagger in Mary's own heart.--CHALMER'S _Life of Queen Mary_, vol. i. p.\n278.]\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Thirty-Third.\n\n\n  Death distant?--No, alas! he's ever with us,\n  And shakes the dart at us in all our actings:\n  He lurks within our cup, while we're in health;\n  Sits by our sick-bed, mocks our medicines;\n  We cannot walk, or sit, or ride, or travel,\n  But Death is by to seize us when he lists.\n                         THE SPANISH FATHER.\n\nFrom the agitating scene in the Queen's presence-chamber, the Lady of\nLochleven retreated to her own apartment, and ordered the steward to be\ncalled before her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave they not disarmed thee, Dryfesdale?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, on seeing him\nenter, accoutred, as usual, with sword and dagger.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo!\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the old man; \u00e2\u0080\u009chow should they?--Your ladyship, when you\ncommanded me to ward, said nought of laying down my arms; and, I think\nnone of your menials, without your order, or your son's, dare approach\nJasper Dryfesdale for such a purpose.--Shall I now give up my sword to\nyou?--it is worth little now, for it has fought for your house till it\nis worn down to old iron, like the pantler's old chipping knife.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have attempted a deadly crime--poison under trust.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnder trust?--hem!--I know not what your ladyship thinks of it, but the\nworld without thinks the trust was given you even for that very end; and\nyou would have been well off had it been so ended as I proposed, and you\nneither the worse nor the wiser.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWretch!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand fool as well as villain, who could\nnot even execute the crime he had planned!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI bid as fair for it as man could,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Dryfesdale; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI went to a\nwoman--a witch and a Papist--If I found not poison, it was because it\nwas otherwise predestined. I tried fair for it; but the half-done job\nmay be clouted, if you will.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVillain! I am even now about to send off an express messenger to my\nson, to take order how thou shouldst be disposed of. Prepare thyself for\ndeath, if thou canst.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe that looks on death, Lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Dryfesdale, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas that which\nhe may not shun, and which has its own fixed and certain hour, is ever\nprepared for it. He that is hanged in May will eat no flaunes\n[footnote: Pancakes] in midsummer--so there is the moan made for the old\nserving-man. But whom, pray I, send you on so fair an errand?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere will be no lack of messengers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered his mistress.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy my hand, but there will,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the old man; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour castle is but\npoorly manned, considering the watches that you must keep, having this\ncharge--There is the warder, and two others, whom you discarded for\ntampering with Master George; then for the warder's tower, the bailie,\nthe donjon--five men mount each guard, and the rest must sleep for the\nmost part in their clothes. To send away another man, were to harass\nthe sentinels to death--unthrifty misuse for a household. To take in new\nsoldiers were dangerous, the charge requiring tried men. I see but one\nthing for it--I will do your errand to Sir William Douglas myself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat were indeed a resource!--And on what day within twenty years would\nit be done?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEven with the speed of man and horse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dryfesdale; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor though I\ncare not much about the latter days of an old serving-man's life, yet I\nwould like to know as soon as may be, whether my neck is mine own or the\nhangman's.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHoldest thou thy own life so lightly?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cElse I had reckoned more of that of others,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\npredestinarian--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is death?--it is but ceasing to live--And what\nis living?--a weary return of light and darkness, sleeping and waking,\nbeing hungered and eating. Your dead man needs neither candle nor can,\nneither fire nor feather-bed; and the joiner's chest serves him for an\neternal frieze-jerkin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWretched man! believest thou not that after death comes the judgment?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Dryfesdale, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas my mistress, I may not dispute your\nwords; but, as spiritually speaking, you are still but a burner of\nbricks in Egypt, ignorant of the freedom of the saints; for, as was well\nshown to me by that gifted man, Nicolaus Schoefferbach, who was martyred\nby the bloody Bishop of Munster, he cannot sin who doth but execute that\nwhich is predestined, since--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSilence!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, interrupting him,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnswer me not with thy\nbold and presumptuous blasphemy, but hear me. Thou hast been long the\nservant of our house--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe born servant of the Douglas--they have had the best of me--I served\nthem since I left Lockerbie: I was then ten years old, and you may soon\nadd the threescore to it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThy foul attempt has miscarried, so thou art guilty only in intention.\nIt were a deserved deed to hang thee on the warder's tower; and yet\nin thy present mind, it were but giving a soul to Satan. I take thine\noffer, then--Go hence--here is my packet--I will add to it but a line,\nto desire him to send me a faithful servant or two to complete the\ngarrison. Let my son deal with you as he will. If thou art wise, thou\nwilt make for Lockerbie so soon as thy foot touches dry land, and let\nthe packet find another bearer; at all rates, look it miscarries not.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied he--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was born, as I said, the Douglas's servant,\nand I will be no corbie-messenger in mine old age--your message to your\nson shall be done as truly by me as if it concerned another man's neck.\nI take my leave of your honour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Lady issued her commands, and the old man was ferried over to the\nshore, to proceed on his extraordinary pilgrimage. It is necessary\nthe reader should accompany him on his journey, which Providence had\ndetermined should not be of long duration.\n\nOn arriving at the village, the steward, although his disgrace had\ntranspired, was readily accommodated with a horse, by the Chamberlain's\nauthority; and the roads being by no means esteemed safe, he associated\nhimself with Auchtermuchty, the common carrier, in order to travel in\nhis company to Edinburgh.\n\nThe worthy waggoner, according to the established customs of all\ncarriers, stage-coachmen, and other persons in public authority, from\nthe earliest days to the present, never wanted good reasons for stopping\nupon the road, as often as he would; and the place which had most\ncaptivation for him as a resting-place was a change-house, as it was\ntermed, not very distant from a romantic dell, well known by the name\nof Keirie Craigs. Attractions of a kind very different from those\nwhich arrested the progress of John Auchtermuchty and his wains, still\ncontinue to hover round this romantic spot, and none has visited its\nvicinity without a desire to remain long and to return soon.\n\nArrived near his favourite _howss_, not all the authority of Dryfesdale\n(much diminished indeed by the rumours of his disgrace) could prevail on\nthe carrier, obstinate as the brutes which he drove, to pass on without\nhis accustomed halt, for which the distance he had travelled furnished\nlittle or no pretence. Old Keltie, the landlord, who had bestowed his\nname on a bridge in the neighbourhood of his quondam dwelling, received\nthe carrier with his usual festive cordiality, and adjourned with him\ninto the house, under pretence of important business, which, I believe,\nconsisted in their emptying together a mutchkin stoup of usquebaugh.\nWhile the worthy host and his guest were thus employed, the discarded\nsteward, with a double portion of moroseness in his gesture and look,\nwalked discontentedly into the kitchen of the place, which was occupied\nbut by one guest. The stranger was a slight figure, scarce above the age\nof boyhood, and in the dress of a page, but bearing an air of haughty\naristocratic boldness and even insolence in his look and manner, that\nmight have made Dryfesdale conclude he had pretensions to superior\nrank, had not his experience taught him how frequently these airs of\nsuperiority were assumed by the domestics and military retainers of the\nScottish nobility.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe pilgrim's morning to you, old sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nyouth; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou come, as I think, from Lochleven Castle--What news of our\nbonny Queen?--a fairer dove was never pent up in so wretched a dovecot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey that speak of Lochleven, and of those whom its walls contain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n answered Dryfesdale, \u00e2\u0080\u009cspeak of what concerns the Douglas; and they who\nspeak of what concerns the Douglas, do it at their peril.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you speak from fear of them, old man, or would you make a quarrel\nfor them?--I should have deemed your age might have cooled your blood.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever, while there are empty-pated coxcombs at each corner to keep it\nwarm.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe sight of thy gray hairs keeps mine cold,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the boy, who had\nrisen up and now sat down again.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is well for thee, or I had cooled it with this holly-rod,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied\nthe steward. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think thou be'st one of those swash-bucklers, who brawl\nin alehouses and taverns; and who, if words were pikes, and oaths were\nAndrew Ferraras, would soon place the religion of Babylon in the land\nonce more, and the woman of Moab upon the throne.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, by Saint Bennet of Seyton,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the youth, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will strike thee on\nthe face, thou foul-mouthed old railing heretic!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSaint Bennet of Seyton,\u00e2\u0080\u009d echoed the steward; \u00e2\u0080\u009ca proper warrant is Saint\nBennet's, and for a proper nest of wolf-birds like the Seytons!--I will\narrest thee as a traitor to King James and the good Regent.--Ho! John\nAuchtermuchty, raise aid against the King's traitor!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, he laid his hand on the youth's collar, and drew his sword.\nJohn Auchtermuchty looked in, but, seeing the naked weapon, ran faster\nout than he entered. Keltie, the landlord, stood by and helped neither\nparty, only exclaiming, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGentlemen! gentlemen! for the love of Heaven!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n and so forth. A struggle ensued, in which the young man, chafed at\nDryfesdale's boldness, and unable, with the ease he expected, to\nextricate himself from the old man's determined grasp, drew his dagger,\nand with the speed of light, dealt him three wounds in the breast and\nbody, the least of which was mortal. The old man sunk on the ground with\na deep groan, and the host set up a piteous exclamation of surprise.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPeace, ye brawling hound!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the wounded steward; \u00e2\u0080\u009care dagger-stabs\nand dying men such rarities in Scotland, that you should cry as if the\nhouse were falling?--Youth, I do not forgive thee, for there is nought\nbetwixt us to forgive. Thou hast done what I have done to more than\none--And I suffer what I have seen them suffer--it was all ordained to\nbe thus and not otherwise. But if thou wouldst do me right, thou wilt\nsend this packet safely to the hands of Sir William Douglas; and see\nthat my memory suffer not, as if I would have loitered on mine errand\nfor fear of my life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe youth, whose passion had subsided the instant he had done the deed,\nlistened with sympathy and attention, when another person, muffled in\nhis cloak, entered the apartment, and exclaimed--\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood God! Dryfesdale,\nand expiring!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, and Dryfesdale would that he had been dead,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the wounded\nman, \u00e2\u0080\u009crather than that his ears had heard the words of the only Douglas\nthat ever was false--but yet it is better as it is. Good my murderer,\nand the rest of you, stand back a little, and let me speak with this\nunhappy apostate.--Kneel down by me, Master George--You have heard that\nI failed in my attempt to take away that Moabitish stumbling-block and\nher retinue--I gave them that which I thought would have removed the\ntemptation out of thy path--and this, though I had other reasons to show\nto thy mother and others, I did chiefly purpose for love of thee.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor the love of me, base poisoner!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Douglas, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwouldst thou\nhave committed so horrible, so unprovoked a murder, and mentioned my\nname with it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd wherefore not, George of Douglas?\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Dryfesdale. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBreath\nis now scarce with me, but I would spend my last gasp on this argument.\nHast thou not, despite the honour thou owest to thy parents, the faith\nthat is due to thy religion, the truth that is due to thy king, been\nso carried away by the charms of this beautiful sorceress, that thou\nwouldst have helped her to escape from her prison-house, and lent her\nthine arm again to ascend the throne, which she had made a place of\nabomination?--Nay, stir not from me--my hand, though fast stiffening,\nhas yet force enough to hold thee--What dost thou aim at?--to wed this\nwitch of Scotland?--I warrant thee, thou mayest succeed--her heart and\nhand have been oft won at a cheaper rate, than thou, fool that thou art,\nwould think thyself happy to pay. But, should a servant of thy father's\nhouse have seen thee embrace the fate of the idiot Darnley, or of\nthe villain Bothwell--the fate of the murdered fool, or of the living\npirate--while an ounce of ratsbane would have saved thee?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThink on God, Dryfesdale,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George Douglas, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand leave the\nutterance of those horrors--Repent, if thou canst--if not, at least\nbe silent.--Seyton, aid me to support this dying wretch, that he may\ncompose himself to better thoughts, if it be possible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSeyton!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the dying man; \u00e2\u0080\u009cSeyton! Is it by a Seyton's hand that\nI fall at last?--There is something of retribution in that--since the\nhouse had nigh lost a sister by my deed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fixing his fading eyes on the\nyouth, he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe hath her very features and presence!--Stoop down,\nyouth, and let me see thee closer--I would know thee when we meet in\nyonder world, for homicides will herd together there, and I have been\none.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He pulled Seyton's face, in spite of some resistance, closer to\nhis own, looked at him fixedly, and added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThou hast begun young--thy\ncareer will be the briefer--ay, thou wilt be met with, and that anon--a\nyoung plant never throve that was watered with an old man's blood.--Yet\nwhy blame I thee? Strange turns of fate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he muttered, ceasing to\naddress Seyton; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI designed what I could not do, and he has done what\nhe did not perchance design.--Wondrous, that our will should ever oppose\nitself to the strong and uncontrollable tide of destiny--that we should\nstrive with the stream when we might drift with the current! My brain\nwill serve me to question it no farther--I would Schoefferbach were\nhere--yet why?--I am on a course which the vessel can hold without a\npilot.--Farewell, George of Douglas--I die true to thy father's house.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n He fell into convulsions at these words, and shortly after expired.\n\nSeyton and Douglas stood looking on the dying man, and when the scene\nwas closed, the former was the first to speak. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs I live, Douglas, I\nmeant not this, and am sorry; but he laid hands on me, and compelled me\nto defend my freedom, as I best might, with my dagger. If he were ten\ntimes thy friend and follower, I can but say that I am sorry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI blame thee not, Seyton,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Douglas, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthough I lament the chance.\nThere is an overruling destiny above us, though not in the sense in\nwhich it was viewed by that wretched man, who, beguiled by some foreign\nmystagogue, used the awful word as the ready apology for whatever he\nchose to do--we must examine the packet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey withdrew into an inner room, and remained deep in consultation,\nuntil they were disturbed by the entrance of Keltie, who, with an\nembarrassed countenance, asked Master George Douglas's pleasure\nrespecting the disposal of the body. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour honour knows,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I make my bread by living men, not by dead corpses; and old Mr.\nDryfesdale, who was but a sorry customer while he was alive, occupies\nmy public room now that he is deceased, and can neither call for ale nor\nbrandy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTie a stone round his neck,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Seyton, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand when the sun is down,\nhave him to the Loch of Ore, heave him in, and let him alone for finding\nout the bottom.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnder your favour, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George Douglas, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit shall not be\nso.--Keltie, thou art a true fellow to me, and thy having been so shall\nadvantage thee. Send or take the body to the chapel at Scotland's wall,\nor to the church of Ballanry, and tell what tale thou wilt of his having\nfallen in a brawl with some unruly guests of thine. Auchtermuchty knows\nnought else, nor are the times so peaceful as to admit close-looking\ninto such accounts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, let him tell the truth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Seyton, \u00e2\u0080\u009cso far as it harms not our\nscheme.--Say that Henry Seyton met with him, my good fellow;--I care not\na brass bodle for the feud.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA feud with the Douglas was ever to be feared, however,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George,\ndispleasure mingling with his natural deep gravity of manner.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot when the best of the name is on my side,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Seyton.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas! Henry, if thou meanest me, I am but half a Douglas in this\nemprize--half head, half heart, and half hand.--But I will think on\none who can never be forgotten, and be all, or more, than any of my\nancestors was ever.--Keltie, say it was Henry Seyton did the deed; but\nbeware, not a word of me!--Let Auchtermuchty carry this packet\u00e2\u0080\u009d (which\nhe had resealed with his own signet) \u00e2\u0080\u009cto my father at Edinburgh; and\nhere is to pay for the funeral expenses, and thy loss of custom.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the washing of the floor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the landlord, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich will be an\nextraordinary job; for blood they say, will scarcely ever cleanse out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut as for your plan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George of Douglas, addressing Seyton, as if\nin continuation of what they had been before treating of, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit has a good\nface; but, under your favour, you are yourself too hot and too young,\nbesides other reasons which are much against your playing the part you\npropose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will consult the Father Abbot upon it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the youth. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you ride\nto Kinross to-night?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy--so I purpose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Douglas; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe night will be dark, and suits\na muffled man. [Footnote: Generally, a disguised man; originally one who\nwears the cloak or mantle muffled round the lower part of the face\nto conceal his countenance. I have on an ancient, piece of iron the\nrepresentation of a robber thus accoutred, endeavouring to make his way\ninto a house, and opposed by a mastiff, to whom he in vain offers food.\nThe motto is _spernit dona fides_. It is part of a fire-grate said to\nhave belonged to Archbishop Sharpe.]--Keltie, I forgot, there should\nbe a stone laid on that man's grave, recording his name, and his only\nmerit, which was being a faithful servant to the Douglas.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat religion was the man of?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Seyton; \u00e2\u0080\u009che used words, which make\nme fear I have sent Satan a subject before his time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can tell you little of that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George Douglas; \u00e2\u0080\u009che was noted for\ndisliking both Rome and Geneva, and spoke of lights he had learned among\nthe fierce sectaries of Lower Germany--an evil doctrine it was, if we\njudge by the fruits. God keep us from presumptuously judging of Heaven's\nsecrets!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAmen!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young Seyton, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand from meeting any encounter this\nevening.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not thy wont to pray so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George Douglas.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo! I leave that to you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the youth, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen you are seized with\nscruples of engaging with your father's vassals. But I would fain have\nthis old man's blood off these hands of mine ere I shed more--I will\nconfess to the Abbot to-night, and I trust to have light penance for\nridding the earth of such a miscreant. All I sorrow for is, that he was\nnot a score of years younger--He drew steel first, however, that is one\ncomfort.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Thirty-Fourth.\n\n\n  Ay, Pedro,--Come you here with mask and lantern.\n  Ladder of ropes and other moonshine tools--\n  Why, youngster, thou mayst cheat the old Duenna,\n  Flatter the waiting-woman, bribe the valet;\n  But know, that I her father play the Gryphon,\n  Tameless and sleepless, proof to fraud or bribe,\n  And guard the hidden, treasure of her beauty.\n                             THE SPANISH FATHER.\n\nThe tenor of our tale carries us back to the Castle of Lochleven, where\nwe take up the order of events on the same remarkable day on which\nDryfesdale had been dismissed from the castle. It was past noon, the\nusual hour of dinner, yet no preparations seemed made for the Queen's\nentertainment. Mary herself had retired into her own apartment, where\nshe was closely engaged in writing. Her attendants were together in the\npresence-chamber, and much disposed to speculate on the delay of\nthe dinner; for it may be recollected that their breakfast had been\ninterrupted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe in my conscience,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat having\nfound the poisoning scheme miscarry, by having gone to the wrong\nmerchant for their deadly wares, they are now about to try how famine\nwill work upon us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLady Fleming was somewhat alarmed at this surmise, but comforted herself\nby observing that the chimney of the kitchen had reeked that whole\nday in a manner which contradicted the supposition.--Catherine Seyton\npresently exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey were bearing the dishes across the court,\nmarshalled by the Lady Lochleven herself, dressed out in her highest\nand stiffest ruff, with her partlet and sleeves of cyprus, and her huge\nold-fashioned farthingale of crimson velvet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe on my word,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, approaching the window also, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\nwas in that very farthingale that she captivated the heart of gentle\nKing Jamie, which procured our poor Queen her precious bargain of a\nbrother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat may hardly be, Master Roland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Lady Fleming, who was\na great recorder of the changes of fashion, \u00e2\u0080\u009csince the farthingales came\nfirst in when the Queen Regent went to Saint Andrews, after the battle\nof Pinkie, and were then called _Vertugardins_--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe would have proceeded farther in this important discussion, but was\ninterrupted by the entrance of the Lady of Lochleven, who preceded the\nservants bearing the dishes, and formally discharged the duty of tasting\neach of them. Lady Fleming regretted, in courtly phrase, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat the Lady\nof Lochleven should have undertaken so troublesome an office.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter the strange incident of this day, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is\nnecessary for my honour and that of my son, that I partake whatever is\noffered to my involuntary guest. Please to inform the Lady Mary that I\nattend her commands.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHer Majesty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Lady Fleming, with due emphasis on the word,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cshall be informed that the Lady Lochleven waits.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMary appeared instantly, and addressed her hostess with courtesy, which\neven approached to something more cordial. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is nobly done, Lady\nLochleven,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor though we ourselves apprehend no danger under\nyour roof, our ladies have been much alarmed by this morning's chance,\nand our meal will be the more cheerful for your presence and assurance.\nPlease you to sit down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Lady Lochleven obeyed the Queen's commands, and Roland performed the\noffice of carver and attendant as usual. But, notwithstanding what the\nQueen had said, the meal was silent and unsocial; and every effort which\nMary made to excite some conversation, died away under the solemn and\nchill replies of the Lady of Lochleven. At length it became plain that\nthe Queen, who had considered these advances as a condescension on her\npart, and who piqued herself justly on her powers of pleasing, became\noffended at the repulsive conduct of her hostess. After looking with a\nsignificant glance at Lady Fleming and Catherine, she slightly shrugged\nher shoulders, and remained silent. A pause ensued, at the end of which\nthe Lady Douglas spoke:--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI perceive, madam, I am a check on the mirth\nof this fair company. I pray you to excuse me--I am a widow--alone here\nin a most perilous charge---deserted by my grandson--betrayed by my\nservant--I am little worthy of the grace you do me in offering me a\nseat at your table, where I am aware that wit and pastime are usually\nexpected from the guests.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf the Lady Lochleven is serious,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe wonder by what\nsimplicity she expects our present meals to be seasoned with mirth. If\nshe is a widow, she lives honoured and uncontrolled, at the head of her\nlate husband's household. But I know at least of one widowed woman in\nthe world, before whom the words desertion and betrayal ought never to\nbe mentioned, since no one has been made so bitterly acquainted with\ntheir import.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI meant not, madam, to remind you of your misfortunes, by the mention\nof mine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Lady Lochleven, and there was again a deep\nsilence.\n\nMary at length addressed Lady Fleming. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can commit no deadly sins\nhere, _ma bonne_, where we are so well warded and looked to; but if we\ncould, this Carthusian silence might be useful as a kind of penance.\nIf thou hast adjusted my wimple amiss, my Fleming, or if Catherine hath\nmade a wry stitch in her broidery, when she was thinking of something\nelse than her work, or if Roland Graeme hath missed a wild-duck on the\nwing, and broke a quarrel-pane [Footnote: Diamond-shaped; literally,\nformed like the head of a _quarrel_, or arrow for the crossbow.] of\nglass in the turret window, as chanced to him a week since, now is the\ntime to think on your sins and to repent of them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam, I speak with all reverence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady Lochleven; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I am\nold, and claim the privilege of age. Methinks your followers might find\nfitter subjects for repentance than the trifles you mention, and so\nmention--once more, I crave your pardon--as if you jested with sin and\nrepentance both.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have been our taster, Lady Lochleven,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI perceive\nyou would eke out your duty with that of our Father Confessor--and since\nyou choose that our conversation should be serious, may I ask you why\nthe Regent's promise--since your son so styles himself--has not been\nkept to me in that respect? From time to time this promise has been\nrenewed, and as constantly broken. Methinks those who pretend themselves\nto so much gravity and sanctity, should not debar from others the\nreligious succours which their consciences require.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam, the Earl of Murray was indeed weak enough,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady\nLochleven, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto give so far way to your unhappy prejudices, and a\nreligioner of the Pope presented himself on his part at our town of\nKinross. But the Douglass is Lord of his own castle, and will not permit\nhis threshold to be darkened, no not for a single moment, by an emissary\nbelonging to the Bishop of Rome.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMethinks it were well, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mary, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat my Lord Regent would\nsend me where there is less scruple and more charity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn this, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Lady Lochleven, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou mistake the nature\nboth of charity and of religion. Charity giveth to those who are in\ndelirium the medicaments which may avail their health, but refuses those\nenticing cates and liquors which please the palate, but augment the\ndisease.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis your charity, Lady Lochleven, is pure cruelty, under the\nhypocritical disguise of friendly care. I am oppressed amongst you as if\nyou meant the destruction both of my body and soul; but Heaven will not\nendure such iniquity for ever, and they who are the most active agents\nin it may speedily expect their reward.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this moment Randal entered the apartment, with a look so much\nperturbed, that the Lady Fleming uttered a faint scream, the Queen was\nobviously startled, and the Lady of Lochleven, though too bold and proud\nto evince any marked signs of alarm, asked hastily what was the matter?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDryfesdale has been slain, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the reply; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmurdered as soon as\nhe gained the dry land by young Master Henry Seyton.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was now Catherine's turn to start and grow pale--\u00e2\u0080\u009cHas the murderer of\nthe Douglas's vassal escaped?\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the Lady's hasty question.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere was none to challenge him but old Keltie, and the carrier\nAuchtermuchty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Randal; \u00e2\u0080\u009cunlikely men to stay one of the\nfrackest [Footnote: Boldest--most forward.] youths in Scotland of\nhis years, and who was sure to have friends and partakers at no great\ndistance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWas the deed completed?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDone, and done thoroughly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Randal; \u00e2\u0080\u009ca Seyton seldom strikes\ntwice--But the body was not despoiled, and your honour's packet goes\nforward to Edinburgh by Auchtermuchty, who leaves Keltie-Bridge early\nto-morrow--marry, he has drunk two bottles of aquavitae to put the\nfright out of his head, and now sleeps them off beside his cart-avers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n [Footnote: Cart-horses.]\n\nThere was a pause when this fatal tale was told. The Queen and Lady\nDouglas looked on each other, as if each thought how she could best\nturn the incident to her own advantage in the controversy, which was\ncontinually kept alive betwixt them--Catherine Seyton kept her kerchief\nat her eyes and wept.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see, madam, the bloody maxims and practice of the deluded Papists,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said Lady Lochleven.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009csay rather you see the deserved\njudgment of Heaven upon a Calvinistical poisoner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDryfesdale was not of the Church of Geneva, or of Scotland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nLady of Lochleven, hastily.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was a heretic, however,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Mary; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is but one true and\nunerring guide; the others lead alike into error.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, madam, I trust it will reconcile you to your retreat, that\nthis deed shows the temper of those who might wish you at liberty.\nBlood-thirsty tyrants, and cruel men-quellers are they all, from\nthe Clan-Ranald and Clan-Tosach in the north, to the Ferniherst and\nBuccleuch in the south--the murdering Seytons in the east, and--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMethinks, madam, you forget that I am a Seyton?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine,\nwithdrawing her kerchief from her face, which was now coloured with\nindignation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I had forgot it, fair mistress, your forward bearing would have\nreminded me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lady Lochleven.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf my brother has slain the villain that would have poisoned his\nSovereign, and his sister,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am only so far sorry that\nhe should have spared the hangman his proper task. For aught farther,\nhad it been the best Douglas in the land, he would have been honoured in\nfalling by the Seyton's sword.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFarewell, gay mistress,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady of Lochleven, rising to\nwithdraw; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is such maidens as you, who make giddy-fashioned revellers\nand deadly brawlers. Boys must needs rise, forsooth, in the grace of\nsome sprightly damsel, who thinks to dance through life as through a\nFrench galliard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She then made her reverence to the Queen, and added,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you also, madam, fare you well, till curfew time, when I will\nmake, perchance, more bold than welcome in attending upon your supper\nboard.--Come with me, Randal, and tell me more of this cruel fact.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c'Tis an extraordinary chance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, when she had departed;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cand, villain as he was, I would this man had been spared time for\nrepentance. We will cause something to be done for his soul, if we\never attain our liberty, and the Church will permit such grace to a\nheretic.--But, tell me, Catherine, _ma mign\u00c3\u00b3ne_--this brother of thine,\nwho is so _frack_, as the fellow called him, bears he the same wonderful\nlikeness to thee as formerly?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf your Grace means in temper, you know whether I am so _frack_ as the\nserving-man spoke him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, thou art prompt enough in all reasonable conscience,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the\nQueen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut thou art my own darling notwithstanding--But I meant, is\nthis thy twin-brother as like thee in form and features as formerly? I\nremember thy dear mother alleged it as a reason for destining thee to\nthe veil, that, were ye both to go at large, thou wouldst surely get the\ncredit of some of thy brother's mad pranks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere are some unusually simple\npeople even yet, who can hardly distinguish betwixt us, especially when,\nfor diversion's sake, my brother hath taken a female dress,\u00e2\u0080\u009d--and as\nshe spoke, she gave a quick glance at Roland Graeme, to whom this\nconversation conveyed a ray of light, welcome as ever streamed into the\ndungeon of a captive through the door which opened to give him freedom.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe must be a handsome cavalier this brother of thine, if he be so like\nyou,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Mary. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was in France, I think, for these late years, so\nthat I saw him not at Holyrood.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHis looks, madam, have never been much found fault with,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered\nCatherine Seyton; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I would he had less of that angry and heady\nspirit which evil times have encouraged amongst our young nobles. God\nknows, I grudge not his life in your Grace's quarrel; and love him for\nthe willingness with which he labours for your rescue. But wherefore\nshould he brawl with an old ruffianly serving-man, and stain at once\nhis name with such a broil, and his hands with the blood of an old and\nignoble wretch?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, be patient, Catherine; I will not have thee traduce my gallant\nyoung knight. With Henry for my knight, and Roland Graeme for my trusty\nsquire, methinks I am like a princess of romance, who may shortly set at\ndefiance the dungeons and the weapons of all wicked sorcerers.--But\nmy head aches with the agitation of the day. Take me _La Mer Des\nHistoires_, and resume where we left off on Wednesday.--Our Lady help\nthy head, girl, or rather may she help thy heart!--I asked thee for the\nSea of Histories, and thou hast brought _La Cronique d'Amour_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOnce embarked upon the Sea of Histories, the Queen continued her\nlabours with her needle, while Lady Fleming and Catherine read to her\nalternately for two hours.\n\nAs to Roland Graeme, it is probable that he continued in secret intent\nupon the Chronicle of Love, notwithstanding the censure which the Queen\nseemed to pass upon that branch of study. He now remembered a thousand\ncircumstances of voice and manner, which, had his own prepossession been\nless, must surely have discriminated the brother from the sister; and\nhe felt ashamed, that, having as it were by heart every particular of\nCatherine's gestures, words, and manners, he should have thought her,\nnotwithstanding her spirits and levity, capable of assuming the bold\nstep, loud tones, and forward assurance, which accorded well enough with\nher brother's hasty and masculine character. He endeavoured repeatedly\nto catch a glance of Catherine's eye, that he might judge how she was\ndisposed to look upon him since he had made the discovery, but he was\nunsuccessful; for Catherine, when she was not reading herself, seemed\nto take so much interest in the exploits of the Teutonic knights against\nthe Heathens of Esthonia and Livonia, that he could not surprise her eye\neven for a second. But when, closing the book, the Queen commanded their\nattendance in the garden, Mary, perhaps of set purpose, (for Roland's\nanxiety could not escape so practised an observer,) afforded him a\nfavourable opportunity of accosting his mistress. The Queen commanded\nthem to a little distance, while she engaged Lady Fleming in a\nparticular and private conversation; the subject whereof we learn, from\nanother authority, to have been the comparative excellence of the high\nstanding ruff and the falling band. Roland must have been duller, and\nmore sheepish than ever was youthful lover, if he had not endeavoured to\navail himself of this opportunity.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have been longing this whole evening to ask of you, fair Catherine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow foolish and unapprehensive you must have thought me,\nin being capable to mistake betwixt your brother and you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe circumstance does indeed little honour to my rustic manners,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nCatherine, \u00e2\u0080\u009csince those of a wild young man were so readily mistaken for\nmine. But I shall grow wiser in time; and with that view I am determined\nnot to think of your follies, but to correct my own.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will be the lighter subject of meditation of the two,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know not that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine, very gravely; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI fear we have been\nboth unpardonably foolish.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have been mad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cunpardonably mad. But you, lovely\nCatherine--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine, in the same tone of unusual gravity, \u00e2\u0080\u009chave too long\nsuffered you to use such expressions towards me--I fear I can permit it\nno longer, and I blame myself for the pain it may give you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what can have happened so suddenly to change our relation to each\nother, or alter, with such sudden cruelty, your whole deportment to me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can hardly tell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Catherine, \u00e2\u0080\u009cunless it is that the events\nof the day have impressed on my mind the necessity of our observing more\ndistance to each other. A chance similar to that which betrayed to you\nthe existence of my brother, may make known to Henry the terms you have\nused to me; and, alas! his whole conduct, as well as his deed, this day,\nmakes me too justly apprehensive of the consequences.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFear nothing for that, fair Catherine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the page; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am well\nable to protect myself against risks of that nature.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is to say,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you would fight with my\ntwin-brother to show your regard for his sister? I have heard the\nQueen say, in her sad hours, that men are, in love or in hate, the most\nselfish animals of creation; and your carelessness in this matter looks\nvery like it. But be not so much abashed--you are no worse than others.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou do me injustice, Catherine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought but of\nbeing threatened with a sword, and did not remember in whose hand your\nfancy had placed it. If your brother stood before me, with his drawn\nweapon in his hand, so like as he is to you in word, person, and favour,\nhe might shed my life's blood ere I could find in my heart to resist him\nto his injury.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is not my brother alone. But you remember only the\nsingular circumstances in which we have met in equality, and I may say\nin intimacy. You think not, that whenever I re-enter my father's house,\nthere is a gulf between us you may not pass, but with peril of your\nlife.--Your only known relative is of wild and singular habits, of a\nhostile and broken clan [Footnote: A broken clan was one who had no\nchief able to find security for their good behaviour--a clan of outlaws;\nAnd the Graemes of the Debateable Land were in that condition.]--the\nrest of your lineage unknown--forgive me that I speak what is the\nundeniable truth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLove, my beautiful Catherine, despises genealogies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Roland\nGraeme.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLove may, but so will not the Lord Seyton,\u00e2\u0080\u009d rejoined the damsel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Queen, thy mistress and mine, she will intercede. Oh! drive me not\nfrom you at the moment I thought myself most happy!--and if I shall\naid her deliverance, said not yourself that you and she would become my\ndebtors?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll Scotland will become your debtors,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut for the\nactive effects you might hope from our gratitude, you must remember I am\nwholly subjected to my father; and the poor Queen is, for a long time,\nmore likely to be dependant on the pleasure of the nobles of her party,\nthan possessed of power to control them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe it so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Roland; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy deeds shall control prejudice itself--it\nis a bustling world, and I will have my share. The Knight of Avenel,\nhigh as he now stands, rose from as obscure an origin as mine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere spoke the doughty knight of romance, that\nwill cut his way to the imprisoned princess, through fiends and fiery\ndragons!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut if I can set the princess at large, and procure her the freedom\nof her own choice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhere, dearest Catherine, will that\nchoice alight?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRelease the princess from duresse, and she will tell you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\ndamsel; and breaking off the conversation abruptly, she joined the Queen\nso suddenly, that Mary exclaimed, half aloud--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo more tidings of evil import--no dissension, I trust, in my limited\nhousehold?\u00e2\u0080\u009d--Then looking on Catherine's blushing cheek, and Roland's\nexpanded brow and glancing eye--\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo--no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI see all is\nwell--_Ma petite mignone_, go to my apartment and fetch me down--let me\nsee--ay, fetch my pomander box.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd having thus disposed of her attendant in the manner best qualified\nto hide her confusion, the Queen added, speaking apart to Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nshould at least have two grateful subjects of Catherine and you; for\nwhat sovereign but Mary would aid true love so willingly?--Ay, you lay\nyour hand on your sword--your _petite flamberge \u00c3\u00a0 rien_ there--Well,\nshort time will show if all the good be true that is protested to us--I\nhear them toll curfew from Kinross. To our chamber--this old dame hath\npromised to be with us again at our evening meal. Were it not for the\nhope of speedy deliverance, her presence would drive me distracted. But\nI will be patient.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI profess,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine, who just then entered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would I could be\nHenry, with all a man's privileges, for one moment--I long to throw my\nplate at that confect of pride and formality, and ill-nature.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Lady Fleming reprimanded her young companion for this explosion of\nimpatience; the Queen laughed, and they went to the presence-chamber,\nwhere almost immediately entered supper, and the Lady of the castle.\nThe Queen, strong in her prudent resolutions, endured her presence with\ngreat fortitude and equanimity, until her patience was disturbed by\na new form, which had hitherto made no part of the ceremonial of the\ncastle. When the other attendant had retired, Randal entered, bearing\nthe keys of the castle fastened upon a chain, and, announcing that\nthe watch was set, and the gates locked, delivered the keys with all\nreverence to the Lady of Lochleven.\n\nThe Queen and her ladies exchanged with each other a look of\ndisappointment, anger, and vexation; and Mary said aloud, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe cannot\nregret the smallness of our court, when we see our hostess discharge in\nperson so many of its offices. In addition to her charges of principal\nsteward of our household and grand almoner, she has to-night done duty\nas captain of our guard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd will continue to do so in future, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Lady\nLochleven, with much gravity; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe history of Scotland may teach me how\nill the duty is performed, which is done by an accredited deputy--We\nhave heard, madam, of favourites of later date, and as little merit,\nas Oliver Sinclair.\u00e2\u0080\u009d [Footnote: A favourite, and said to be an unworthy\none, of James V.]\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy father had his female as well as\nhis male favourites--there were the Ladies Sandilands and Olifaunt,\n[Footnote: The names of these ladies, and a third frail favourite of\nJames, are preserved in an epigram too _gaillard_ for quotation.] and\nsome others, methinks; but their names cannot survive in the memory of\nso grave a person as you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Lady Lochleven looked as if she could have slain the Queen on the\nspot, but commanded her temper and retired from the apartment, bearing\nin her hand the ponderous bunch of keys.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow God be praised for that woman's youthful frailty!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHad she not that weak point in her character, I might waste my words on\nher in vain--But that stain is the very reverse of what is said of\nthe witch's mark--I can make her feel there, though she is otherwise\ninsensible all over.--But how say you, girls--here is a new\ndifficulty--How are these keys to be come by?--there is no deceiving or\nbribing this dragon, I trow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMay I crave to know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhether, if your Grace were beyond\nthe walls of the castle, you could find means of conveyance to the firm\nland, and protection when you are there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrust us for that, Roland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor to that point our\nscheme is indifferent well laid.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen if your Grace will permit me to speak my mind, I think I could be\nof some use in this matter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs how, my good youth?--speak on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand fearlessly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy patron the Knight of Avenel used to compel the youth educated in his\nhousehold to learn the use of axe and hammer, and working in wood and\niron--he used to speak of old northern champions, who forged their own\nweapons, and of the Highland Captain, Donald nan Ord, or Donald of the\nHammer, whom he himself knew, and who used to work at the anvil with a\nsledge-hammer in each hand. Some said he praised this art, because he\nwas himself of churl's blood. However, I gained some practice in it,\nas the Lady Catherine Seyton partly knows; for since we were here, I\nwrought her a silver brooch.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Catharine, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut you should tell her Grace that your\nworkmanship was so indifferent that it broke to pieces next day, and I\nflung it away.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBelieve her not, Roland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe wept when it was broken,\nand put the fragments into her bosom. But for your scheme--could your\nskill avail to forge a second set of keys?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, madam, because I know not the wards. But I am convinced I could\nmake a set so like that hateful bunch which the Lady bore off even now,\nthat could they be exchanged against them by any means, she would never\ndream she was possessed of the wrong.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the good dame, thank Heaven, is somewhat blind,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cbut then for a forge, my boy, and the means of labouring unobserved?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe armourer's forge, at which I used sometimes to work with him, is\nthe round vault at the bottom of the turret--he was dismissed with\nthe warder for being supposed too much attached to George Douglas. The\npeople are accustomed to see me work there, and I warrant I shall find\nsome excuse that will pass current with them for putting bellows and\nanvil to work.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe scheme has a promising face,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cabout it, my lad,\nwith all speed, and beware the nature of your work is not discovered.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, I will take the liberty to draw the bolt against chance visitors,\nso that I will have time to put away what I am working upon, before I\nundo the door.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill not that of itself attract suspicion, in a place where it is so\ncurrent already?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot a whit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Roland; \u00e2\u0080\u009cGregory the armourer, and every good\nhammerman, locks himself in when he is about some master piece of craft.\nBesides, something must be risked.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPart we then to-night,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand God bless you my\nchildren!--If Mary's head ever rises above water, you shall all rise\nalong with her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Thirty-Fifth.\n\n\n  It is a time of danger, not of revel,\n  When churchmen turn to masquers.\n                     SPANISH FATHER.\n\nThe enterprise of Roland Graeme appeared to prosper. A trinket or two,\nof which the work did not surpass the substance, (for the materials were\nsilver, supplied by the Queen,) were judiciously presented to those most\nlikely to be inquisitive into the labours of the forge and anvil, which\nthey thus were induced to reckon profitable to others and harmless\nin itself. Openly, the page was seen working about such trifles. In\nprivate, he forged a number of keys resembling so nearly in weight and\nin form those which were presented every evening to the Lady Lochleven,\nthat, on a slight inspection, it would have been difficult to perceive\nthe difference. He brought them to the dark rusty colour by the use of\nsalt and water; and, in the triumph of his art, presented them at length\nto Queen Mary in her presence-chamber, about an hour before the tolling\nof the curfew. She looked at them with pleasure, but at the same time\nwith doubt.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI allow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat the Lady Lochleven's eyes, which\nare not of the clearest, may be well deceived, could we pass those keys\non her in place of the real implements of her tyranny. But how is this\nto be done, and which of my little court dare attempt this _tour de\njongleur_ with any chance of success? Could we but engage her in some\nearnest matter of argument--but those which I hold with her, always have\nbeen of a kind which make her grasp her keys the faster, as if she\nsaid to herself--Here I hold what sets me above your taunts and\nreproaches--And even for her liberty, Mary Stuart could not stoop to\nspeak the proud heretic fair.--What shall we do? Shall Lady Fleming try\nher eloquence in describing the last new head-tire from Paris?--alas!\nthe good dame has not changed the fashion of her head-gear since\nPinkie-field for aught that I know. Shall my _mign\u00c3\u00b3ne_ Catherine sing to\nher one of those touching airs, which draw the very souls out of me and\nRoland Graeme?--Alas! Dame Margaret Douglas would rather hear a Huguenot\npsalm of Clement Marrot, sung to the tune of _Reveillez vous, belle\nendormie._--Cousins and liege counsellors, what is to be done, for our\nwits are really astray in this matter?--Must our man-at-arms and the\nchampion of our body, Roland Graeme, manfully assault the old lady, and\ntake the keys from her _par voie du fait?_\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay! with your Grace's permission.\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not doubt being\nable to manage the matter with more discretion; for though, in your\nGrace's service, I do not fear--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA host of old women,\u00e2\u0080\u009d interrupted Catherine, \u00e2\u0080\u009ceach armed with rock and\nspindle, yet he has no fancy for pikes and partisans, which might rise\nat the cry of _Help! a Douglas, a Douglas!_\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey that do not fear fair ladies' tongues,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cneed\ndread nothing else.--But, gracious Liege, I am well-nigh satisfied that\nI could pass the exchange of these keys on the Lady Lochleven; but I\ndread the sentinel who is now planted nightly in the garden, which, by\nnecessity, we must traverse.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOur last advices from our friends on the shore have promised us\nassistance in that matter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Queen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd is your Grace well assured of the fidelity and watchfulness of\nthose without?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor their fidelity, I will answer with my life, and for their\nvigilance, I will answer with my life--I will give thee instant proof,\nmy faithful Roland, that they are ingenuous and trusty as thyself. Come\nhither--Nay, Catherine, attend us; we carry not so deft a page into our\nprivate chamber alone. Make fast the door of the parlour, Fleming,\nand warn us if you hear the least step--or stay, go thou to the\ndoor, Catherine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d (in a whisper, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthy ears and thy wits are both\nsharper.)--Good Fleming, attend us thyself\u00e2\u0080\u009d--(and again she whispered,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cher reverend presence will be as safe a watch on Roland as thine\ncan--so be not jealous, _mignone_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d)\n\nThus speaking, they were lighted by the Lady Fleming into the Queen's\nbedroom, a small apartment enlightened by a projecting window.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook from that window, Roland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said; \u00e2\u0080\u009csee you amongst the several\nlights which begin to kindle, and to glimmer palely through the gray of\nthe evening from the village of Kinross-seest thou, I say, one solitary\nspark apart from the others, and nearer it seems to the verge of the\nwater?--It is no brighter at this distance than the torch of the poor\nglowworm, and yet, my good youth, that light is more dear to Mary\nStuart, than every star that twinkles in the blue vault of heaven.\nBy that signal, I know that more than one true heart is plotting my\ndeliverance; and without that consciousness, and the hope of freedom\nit gives me, I had long since stooped to my fate, and died of a broken\nheart. Plan after plan has been formed and abandoned, but still the\nlight glimmers; and while it glimmers, my hope lives.--Oh! how many\nevenings have I sat musing in despair over our ruined schemes, and\nscarce hoping that I should again see that blessed signal; when it\nhas suddenly kindled, and, like the lights of Saint Elmo in a tempest,\nbrought hope and consolation, where there, was only dejection and\ndespair!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I mistake not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe candle shines from the house\nof Blinkhoolie, the mail-gardener.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThou hast a good eye,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is there where my trusty\nlieges--God and the saints pour blessings on them!--hold consultation\nfor my deliverance. The voice of a wretched captive would die on these\nblue waters, long ere it could mingle in their councils; and yet I can\nhold communication--I will confide the whole to thee--I am about to\nask those faithful friends if the moment for the great attempt is\nnigh.--Place the lamp in the window, Fleming.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe obeyed, and immediately withdrew it. No sooner had she done so, than\nthe light in the cottage of the gardener disappeared.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow count,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Queen Mary, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor my heart beats so thick that I cannot\ncount myself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Lady Fleming began deliberately to count one, two, three, and when\nshe had arrived at ten, the light on the shore showed its pale twinkle.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, our Lady be praised!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit was but two nights\nsince, that the absence of the light remained while I could tell thirty.\nThe hour of deliverance approaches. May God bless those who labour in it\nwith such truth to me!--alas! with such hazard to themselves--and bless\nyou, too, my children!--Come, we must to the audience-chamber again. Our\nabsence might excite suspicion, should they serve supper.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey returned to the presence-chamber, and the evening concluded as\nusual.\n\nThe next morning, at dinner-time, an unusual incident occurred. While\nLady Douglas of Lochleven performed her daily duty of assistant and\ntaster at the Queen's table, she was told a man-at-arms had arrived,\nrecommended by her son, but without any letter or other token than what\nhe brought by word of mouth.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHath he given you that token?\u00e2\u0080\u009d demanded the Lady.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe reserved it, as I think, for your Ladyship's ear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Randal.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe doth well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady; \u00e2\u0080\u009ctell him to wait in the hall--But\nno--with your permission, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d (to the Queen) \u00e2\u0080\u009clet him attend me\nhere.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSince you are pleased to receive your domestics in my presence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nthe Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot choose--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy infirmities must plead my excuse, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Lady; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe\nlife I must lead here ill suits with the years which have passed over my\nhead, and compels me to waive ceremonial.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, my good Lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would there were nought in\nthis your castle more strongly compulsive than the cobweb chains of\nceremony; but bolts and bars are harder matters to contend with.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs she spoke, the person announced by Randal entered the room, and\nRoland Graeme at once recognized in him the Abbot Ambrosius.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is your name, good fellow?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEdward Glendinning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Abbot, with a suitable reverence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cArt thou of the blood of the Knight of Avenel?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady of\nLochleven.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, madam, and that nearly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the pretended soldier.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is likely enough,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor the Knight is the son of his\nown good works, and has risen from obscure lineage to his present high\nrank in the Estate--But he is of sure truth and approved worth, and his\nkinsman is welcome to us. You hold, unquestionably, the true faith?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo not doubt of it, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the disguised churchman.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHast thou a token to me from Sir William Douglas?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut it must be said in private.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThou art right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady, moving towards the recess of a window;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009csay in what does it consist?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the words of an old bard,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Abbot.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRepeat them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Lady; and he uttered, in a low tone, the\nlines from an old poem, called The Howlet,--\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cO Douglas! Douglas!\n  Tender and true.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrusty Sir John Holland!\u00e2\u0080\u009d [Footnote: Sir John Holland's poem of the\nHowlet is known to collectors by the beautiful edition presented to\nthe Bannatyne Club, by Mr. David Laing.] said the Lady Douglas,\napostrophizing the poet, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca kinder heart never inspired a rhyme, and the\nDouglas's honour was ever on thy heart-string! We receive you among our\nfollowers, Glendinning--But, Randal, see that he keep the outer ward\nonly, till we shall hear more touching him from our son.--Thou fearest\nnot the night air. Glendinning?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the cause of the Lady before whom I stand, I fear nothing, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n answered the disguised Abbot.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOur garrison, then, is stronger by one trustworthy soldier,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nmatron--\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo to the buttery, and let them make much of thee.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen the Lady Lochleven had retired, the Queen said to Roland Graeme,\nwho was now almost constantly in her company, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI spy comfort in that\nstranger's countenance; I know not why it should be so, but I am well\npersuaded he is a friend.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour Grace's penetration does not deceive you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the page; and\nhe informed her that the Abbot of St. Mary's himself played the part of\nthe newly arrived soldier.\n\nThe Queen crossed herself and looked upwards. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnworthy sinner that I\nam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat for my sake a man so holy, and so high in spiritual\noffice, should wear the garb of a base sworder, and run the risk of\ndying the death of a traitor!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHeaven will protect its own servant, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine Seyton;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009chis aid would bring a blessing on our undertaking, were it not already\nblest for its own sake.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat I admire in my spiritual father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas the steady\nfront with which he looked on me, without giving the least sign of\nformer acquaintance. I did not think the like was possible, since I have\nceased to believe that Henry was the same person with Catherine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut marked you not how astuciously the good father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009celuded the questions of the woman Lochleven, telling her the very\ntruth, which yet she received not as such?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland thought in his heart, that when the truth was spoken for the\npurpose of deceiving, it was little better than a lie in disguise. But\nit was no time to agitate such questions of conscience.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now for the signal from the shore,\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Catherine; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy bosom\ntells me we shall see this night two lights instead of one gleam from\nthat garden of Eden--And then, Roland, do you play your part manfully,\nand we will dance on the greensward like midnight fairies!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCatherine's conjecture misgave not, nor deceived her. In the evening\ntwo beams twinkled from the cottage, instead of one; and the page heard,\nwith beating heart, that the new retainer was ordered to stand sentinel\non the outside of the castle. When he intimated this news to the Queen,\nshe held her hand out to him--he knelt, and when he raised it to his\nlips in all dutiful homage, he found it was damp and cold as marble.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor God's sake, madam, droop not now,--sink not now!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCall upon our Lady, my Liege,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady Fleming--\u00e2\u0080\u009ccall upon your\ntutelar saint.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCall the spirits of the hundred kings you are descended from,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n exclaimed the page; \u00e2\u0080\u009cin this hour of need, the resolution of a monarch\nwere worth the aid of a hundred saints.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! Roland Graeme,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mary, in a tone of deep despondency, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbe true\nto me--many have been false to me. Alas! I have not always been true to\nmyself. My mind misgives me that I shall die in bondage, and that this\nbold attempt will cost all our lives. It was foretold me by a soothsayer\nin France, that I should die in prison, and by a violent death, and here\ncomes the hour--Oh, would to God it found me prepared!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine Seyton, \u00e2\u0080\u009cremember you are a Queen. Better we all\ndied in bravely attempting to gain our freedom, than remained here to be\npoisoned, as men rid them of the noxious vermin that haunt old houses.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are right, Catherine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand Mary will bear her\nlike herself. But alas! your young and buoyant spirit can ill spell the\ncauses which have broken mine. Forgive me, my children, and farewell for\na while--I will prepare both mind and body for this awful venture.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey separated, till again called together by the tolling of the curfew.\nThe Queen appeared grave, but firm and resolved; the Lady Fleming, with\nthe art of an experienced courtier, knew perfectly how to disguise her\ninward tremors; Catherine's eye was fired, as if with the boldness of\nthe project, and the half smile which dwelt upon her beautiful mouth\nseemed to contemn all the risk and all the consequences of discovery;\nRoland, who felt how much success depended on his own address and\nboldness, summoned together his whole presence of mind, and if he found\nhis spirits flag for a moment, cast his eye upon Catherine, whom he\nthought he had never seen look so beautiful.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI may be foiled,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nthought, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut with this reward in prospect, they must bring the devil to\naid them ere they cross me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Thus resolved, he stood like a greyhound\nin the slips, with hand, heart, and eye intent upon making and seizing\nopportunity for the execution of their project.\n\nThe keys had, with the wonted ceremonial, been presented to the Lady\nLochleven. She stood with her back to the casement, which, like that\nof the Queen's apartment, commanded a view of Kinross, with the church,\nwhich stands at some distance from the town, and nearer to the lake,\nthen connected with the town by straggling cottages. With her back to\nthis casement, then, and her face to the table, on which the keys lay\nfor an instant while she tasted the various dishes which were placed\nthere, stood the Lady of Lochleven, more provokingly intent than\nusual--so at least it seemed to her prisoners--upon the huge and heavy\nbunch of iron, the implements of their restraint. Just when, having\nfinished her ceremony as taster of the Queen's table, she was about to\ntake up the keys, the page, who stood beside her, and had handed her the\ndishes in succession, looked sideways to the churchyard, and exclaimed\nhe saw corpse-candles in the churchyard. The Lady of Lochleven was not\nwithout a touch, though a slight one, of the superstitions of the time;\nthe fate of her sons made her alive to omens, and a corpse-light, as it\nwas called, in the family burial-place boded death. She turned her head\ntowards the casement--saw a distant glimmering--forgot her charge for\none second, and in that second were lost the whole fruits of her former\nvigilance. The page held the forged keys under his cloak, and with great\ndexterity exchanged them for the real ones.

She repented nothing but, when the Lords and others, at\nInverness, came in the morning from the watches, that she was not a man,\nto know what life it was to lye all night in the fields, or to walk\nupon the causeway with a jack and a knaps-cap, a Glasgow buckler, and a\nbroadsword.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--RANDOLPH _to_ CECIL, _September_ 18, 1562.\n\nThe writer of the above letter seems to have felt the same impression\nwhich Catherine Seyton, in the text, considered as proper to the Queen's\npresence among her armed subjects.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThough we neither thought nor looked for other than on that day to have\nfought or never-what desperate blows would not have been given, when\nevery man should have fought in the sight of so noble a Queen, and so\nmany fair ladies, our enemies to have taken them from us, and we to\nsave our honours, not to be reft of them, your honour can easily\njudge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--_The same to the same, September_ 24, 1562. ]\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoubt not me, Catherine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Queen; \u00e2\u0080\u009ca while since I was\noverborne, but I have recalled the spirit of my earlier and more\nsprightly days, when I used to accompany my armed nobles, and wish to\nbe myself a man, to know what life it was to be in the fields with sword\nand buckler, jack, and knapscap.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, the lark lives not a gayer life, nor sings a lighter and gayer song\nthan the merry soldier,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Catherine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour Grace shall be in\nthe midst of them soon, and the look of such a liege Sovereign will make\neach of your host worth three in the hour of need:--but I must to my\ntask.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have but brief time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Queen Mary; \u00e2\u0080\u009cone of the two lights in the\ncottage is extinguished--that shows the boat is put off.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey will row very slow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cor kent where depth permits,\nto avoid noise.--To our several tasks--I will communicate with the good\nFather.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt the dead hour of midnight, when all was silent in the castle, the\npage put the key into the lock of the wicket which opened into the\ngarden, and which was at the bottom of a staircase which descended from\nthe Queen's apartment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, turn smooth and softly, thou good bolt,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif ever oil softened rust!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and his precautions had been so\neffectual, that the bolt revolved with little or no sound of resistance.\nHe ventured not to cross the threshold, but exchanging a word with the\ndisguised Abbot, asked if the boat were ready?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis half hour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the sentinel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe lies beneath the wall, too\nclose under the islet to be seen by the warder, but I fear she will\nhardly escape his notice in putting off again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe darkness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the page, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand our profound silence, may take her\noff unobserved, as she came in. Hildebrand has the watch on the tower--a\nheavy-headed knave, who holds a can of ale to be the best headpiece upon\na night-watch. He sleeps, for a wager.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen bring the Queen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I will call Henry Seyton to\nassist them to the boat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOn tiptoe, with noiseless step and suppressed breath, trembling at every\nrustle of their own apparel, one after another the fair prisoners glided\ndown the winding stair, under the guidance of Roland Graeme, and were\nreceived at the wicket-gate by Henry Seyton and the churchman. The\nformer seemed instantly to take upon himself the whole direction of the\nenterprise. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy Lord Abbot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cgive my sister your arm--I will\nconduct the Queen--and that youth will have the honour to guide Lady\nFleming.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis was no time to dispute the arrangement, although it was not that\nwhich Roland Graeme would have chosen. Catherine Seyton, who well knew\nthe garden path, tripped on before like a sylph, rather leading the\nAbbot than receiving assistance--the Queen, her native spirit prevailing\nover female fear, and a thousand painful reflections, moved steadily\nforward, by the assistance of Henry Seyton--while the Lady Fleming,\nencumbered with her fears and her helplessness Roland Graeme, who\nfollowed in the rear, and who bore under the other arm a packet of\nnecessaries belonging to the Queen. The door of the garden, which\ncommunicated with the shore of the islet, yielded to one of the keys\nof which Roland had possessed himself, although not until he had tried\nseveral,--a moment of anxious terror and expectation. The ladies were\nthen partly led, partly carried, to the side of the lake, where a boat\nwith six rowers attended them, the men couched along the bottom to\nsecure them from observation. Henry Seyton placed the Queen in the\nstern; the Abbot offered to assist Catherine, but she was seated by\nthe Queen's side before he could utter his proffer of help; and Roland\nGraeme was just lifting Lady Fleming over the boat-side, when a thought\nsuddenly occurred to him, and exclaiming, \u00e2\u0080\u009cForgotten, forgotten! wait\nfor me but one half-minute,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replaced on the shore the helpless Lady\nof the bed-chamber, threw the Queen's packet into the boat, and sped\nback through the garden with the noiseless speed of a bird on the wing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy Heaven, he is false at last!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Seyton; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI ever feared it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is as true,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas Heaven itself, and that I will\nmaintain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe silent, minion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said her brother, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor shame, if not for\nfear--Fellows, put off, and row for your lives!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHelp me, help me on board!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the deserted Lady Fleming, and that\nlouder than prudence warranted.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPut off--put off!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Henry Seyton; \u00e2\u0080\u009cleave all behind, so the Queen\nis safe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you permit this, madam?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine, imploringly; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou leave\nyour deliverer to death.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cSeyton I command you to stay at every\nrisk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPardon me, madam, if I disobey,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the intractable young man; and\nwith one hand lifting in Lady Fleming, he began himself to push off the\nboat.\n\nShe was two fathoms' length from the shore, and the rowers were getting\nher head round, when Roland Graeme, arriving, bounded from the beach,\nand attained the boat, overturning Seyton, on whom he lighted. The youth\nswore a deep but suppressed oath, and stopping Graeme as he stepped\ntowards the stern, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour place is not with high-born dames--keep\nat the head and trim the vessel--Now give way--give way--Row, for God\nand the Queen!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe rowers obeyed, and began to pull vigorously.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy did ye not muffle the oars?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe dash must\nawaken the sentinel--Row, lads, and get out of reach of shot; for\nhad not old Hildebrand, the warder, supped upon poppy-porridge, this\nwhispering must have waked him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was all thine own delay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Seyton; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthou shalt reckon, with me\nhereafter for that and other matters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Roland's apprehension was verified too instantly to permit him to\nreply. The sentinel, whose slumbering had withstood the whispering, was\nalarmed by the dash of the oars. His challenge was instantly heard. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA\nboat---a boat!--bring to, or I shoot!\u00e2\u0080\u009d And, as they continued to ply\ntheir oars, he called aloud, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTreason! treason!\u00e2\u0080\u009d rung the bell of the\ncastle, and discharged his harquebuss at the boat. The ladies crowded\non each other like startled wild foul, at the flash and report of the\npiece, while the men urged the rowers to the utmost speed. They heard\nmore than one ball whiz along the surface of the lake, at no great\ndistance from their little bark; and from the lights, which glanced\nlike meteors from window to window, it was evident the whole castle was\nalarmed, and their escape discovered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPull!\u00e2\u0080\u009d again exclaimed Seyton; \u00e2\u0080\u009cstretch to your oars, or I will spur\nyou to the task with my dagger--they will launch a boat immediately.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is cared for,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI locked gate and wicket on them when\nI went back, and no boat will stir from the island this night, if doors\nof good oak and bolts of iron can keep men within stone-walls.--And\nnow I resign my office of porter of Lochleven, and give the keys to the\nKelpie's keeping.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs the heavy keys plunged in the lake, the Abbot,--who till then had\nbeen repeating his prayers, exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, bless thee, my son! for thy\nready prudence puts shame on us all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n[Footnote: It is well known that the escape of Queen Mary from Lochleven\nwas effected by George Douglas, the youngest brother of Sir William\nDouglas, the lord of the castle; but the minute circumstances of the\nevent have been a good deal confused, owing to two agents having been\nconcerned in it who bore the same name. It has been always supposed that\nGeorge Douglas was induced to abet Mary's escape by the ambitions hope\nthat, by such service, he might merit her hand. But his purpose was\ndiscovered by his brother Sir William, and he was expelled from the\ncastle. He continued, notwithstanding, to hover in the neighbourhood,\nand maintain a correspondence with the royal prisoner and others in the\nfortress.\n\nIf we believe the English ambassador Drury, the Queen was grateful to\nGeorge Douglas, and even proposed a marriage with him; a scheme which\ncould hardly be serious, since she was still the wife of Bothwell, but\nwhich, if suggested at all, might be with a purpose of gratifying the\nRegent Murray's ambition, and propitiating his favour; since he was, it\nmust be remembered, the brother uterine of George Douglas, for whom such\nhigh honour was said to be designed.\n\nThe proposal, if seriously made, was treated as inadmissible, and Mary\nagain resumed her purpose of escape. Her failure in her first attempt\nhas some picturesque particulars, which might have been advantageously\nintroduced in fictitious narrative. Drury sends Cecil the following\naccount of the matter:--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut after, upon the 25th of the last, (April 1567,) she interprised\nan escape, and was the rather near effect, through her accustomed long\nlying in bed all the morning. The manner of it was thus: there cometh in\nto her the laundress early as other times before she was wanted, and the\nQueen according to such a secret practice putteth on her the hood of the\nlaundress, and so with the fardel of clothes and the muffler upon her\nface, passeth, out and entereth the boat to pass the Loch; which, after\nsome space, one of them that rowed said merrily, 'Let us see what manner\nof dame this is,' and therewith offered to pull down her muffler, which\nto defend, she put up her hands, which they spied to be very fair and\nwhite; wherewith they entered into suspicion whom she was, beginning to\nwonder at her enterprise. Whereat she was little dismayed, but charged\nthem, upon danger of their lives, to row her over to the shore, which\nthey nothing regarded, but eftsoons rowed her back again, promising her\nit should be secreted, and especially from the lord of the house, under\nwhose guard she lyeth. It seemeth she knew her refuge, and--where to\nhave found it if she had once landed; for there did, and yet do linger,\nat a little village called Kinross, hard at the Loch side, the same\nGeorge Douglas, one Sempel and one Beton, the which two were sometime\nher trusty servants, and, as yet appeareth, they mind her no less\naffection.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--_Bishop Keith's History of the Affairs of Church and State\nin Scotland_, p. 490.\n\nNotwithstanding this disappointment, little spoke of by historians, Mary\nrenewed her attempts to escape. There was in the Castle of Lochleven\na lad, named William Douglas, some relation probably of the baron,\nand about eighteen years old. This youth proved as accessible to Queen\nMary's prayers and promises, as was the brother of his patron, George\nDouglas, from whom this William must be carefully kept distinct. It was\nyoung William who played the part commonly assigned to his superior,\nGeorge, stealing the keys of the castle from the table on which they\nlay, while his lord was at supper. He let the Queen and a waiting woman\nout of the apartment where they were secured, and out of the tower\nitself, embarked with them in a small skiff, and rowed them to the\nshore. To prevent instant pursuit, he, for precaution's sake, locked the\niron grated door of the tower, and threw the keys into the lake. They\nfound George Douglas and the Queen's servant, Beton, waiting for them,\nand Lord Seyton and James Hamilton of Orbeiston in attendance, at the\nhead of a party of faithful followers, with whom they fled to Niddrie\nCastle, and from thence to Hamilton.\n\nIn narrating this romantic story, both history and tradition confuse the\ntwo Douglasses together, and confer on George the successful execution\nof the escape from the castle, the merit of which belongs, in reality,\nto the boy called William, or, more frequently, the Little Douglas,\neither from his youth or his slight stature. The reader will observe,\nthat in the romance, the part of the Little Douglas has been assigned\nto Roland Graeme. In another case, it would be tedious to point out in a\nwork of amusement such minute points of historical fact; but the\ngeneral interest taken in the fate of Queen Mary, renders every thing of\nconsequence which connects itself with her misfortunes. ]\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI knew,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mary, drawing her breath more freely, as they were now\nout of reach of the musketry--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI knew my squire's truth, promptitude,\nand sagacity.--I must have him my dear friends--with my no less true\nknights, Douglas and Seyton--but where, then, is Douglas?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the deep and melancholy voice of the boatman who\nsat next her, and who acted as steersman.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas! was it you who stretched your body before me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen the balls were raining around us?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBelieve you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, in a low tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat Douglas would have resigned\nto any one the chance of protecting his Queen's life with his own?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe dialogue was here interrupted by a shot or two from one of those\nsmall pieces of artillery called falconets, then used in defending\ncastles. The shot was too vague to have any effect, but the broader\nflash, the deeper sound, the louder return which was made by the\nmidnight echoes of Bennarty, terrified and imposed silence on the\nliberated prisoners. The boat was alongside of a rude quay or landing\nplace, running out from a garden of considerable extent, ere any of\nthem again attempted to speak. They landed, and while the Abbot returned\nthanks aloud to Heaven,--which had thus far favoured their enterprise,\nDouglas enjoyed the best reward of his desperate undertaking, in\nconducting the Queen to the house of the gardener.\n\nYet, not unmindful of Roland Graeme even in that moment of terror and\nexhaustion, Mary expressly commanded Seyton to give his assistance to\nFleming, while Catherine voluntarily, and without bidding, took the arm\nof the page. Seyton presently resigned Lady Fleming to the care of the\nAbbot, alleging, he must look after their horses; and his attendants,\ndisencumbering themselves of their boat-cloaks, hastened to assist him.\n\nWhile Mary spent in the gardener's cottage the few minutes which were\nnecessary to prepare the steeds for their departure, she perceived, in\na corner, the old man to whom the garden belonged, and called him to\napproach. He came as it were with reluctance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow, brother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cso slow to welcome thy royal Queen and\nmistress to liberty and to her kingdom!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old man, thus admonished, came forward, and, in good terms of\nspeech, gave her Grace joy of her deliverance. The Queen returned him\nthanks in the most gracious manner, and added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will remain to us\nto offer some immediate reward for your fidelity, for we wot well your\nhouse has been long the refuge in which our trusty servants have met\nto concert measures for our freedom.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, she offered gold, and\nadded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will consider your services more fully hereafter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cKneel, brother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot, \u00e2\u0080\u009ckneel instantly, and thank her\nGrace's kindness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood brother, that wert once a few steps under me, and art still\nmany years younger,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the gardener, pettishly, \u00e2\u0080\u009clet me do mine\nacknowledgments in my own way. Queens have knelt to me ere now, and in\ntruth my knees are too old and stiff to bend even to this lovely-faced\nlady. May it please your Grace, if your Grace's servants have occupied\nmy house, so that I could not call it mine own--if they have trodden\ndown my flowers in the zeal of their midnight comings and goings, and\ndestroyed the hope of the fruit season, by bringing their war-horses\ninto my garden, I do but crave of your Grace in requital, that you will\nchoose your residence as far from me as possible. I am an old man\nwho would willingly creep to my grave as easily as I can, in peace,\ngood-will, and quiet labour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI promise you fairly, good man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not make\nyonder castle my residence again, if I can help it. But let me press on\nyou this money--it will make some amends for the havoc we have made in\nyour little garden and orchard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thank your Grace, but it will make me not the least amends,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nold man. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe ruined labours of a whole year are not so easily replaced\nto him who has perchance but that one year to live; and besides, they\ntell me I must leave this place and become a wanderer in mine old age--I\nthat have nothing on earth saving these fruit-trees, and a few old\nparchments and family secrets not worth knowing. As for gold, if I had\nloved it, I might have remained Lord Abbot of St. Mary's--and yet, I\nwot not--for, if Abbot Boniface be but the poor peasant Blinkhoolie, his\nsuccessor, the Abbot Ambrosius, is still transmuted for the worse into\nthe guise of a sword-and-buckler-man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs this indeed the Abbot Boniface of whom I have heard?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nQueen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is indeed I who should have bent the knee for your blessing,\ngood Father.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBend no knee to me, Lady! The blessing of an old man, who is no longer\nan Abbot, go with you over dale and down--I hear the trampling of your\nhorses.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFarewell, Father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen we are once more seated at\nHolyrood, we will neither forget thee nor thine injured garden.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cForget us both,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Ex-Abbot Boniface, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand may God be with you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs they hurried out of the house, they heard the old man talking and\nmuttering to himself, as he hastily drew bolt and bar behind them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe revenge of the Douglasses will reach the poor old man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nQueen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGod help me, I ruin every one whom I approach!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHis safety is cared for,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Seyton; \u00e2\u0080\u009che must not remain here, but\nwill be privately conducted to a place of greater security. But I would\nyour Grace were in the saddle.--To horse! to horse!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe party of Seyton and of Douglas were increased to about ten by those\nattendants who had remained with the horses. The Queen and her ladies,\nwith all the rest who came from the boat, were instantly mounted; and\nholding aloof from the village, which was already alarmed by the firing\nfrom the castle, with Douglas acting as their guide, they soon reached\nthe open ground and began to ride as fast as was consistent with keeping\ntogether in good order.\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Thirty-Sixth.\n\n\n  He mounted himself on a coal-black steed,\n   And her on a freckled gray,\n  With a bugelet horn hung down from his side,\n   And roundly they rode away.\n                               OLD BALLAD.\n\nThe influence of the free air, the rushing of the horses over high and\nlow, the ringing of the bridles, the excitation at once arising from a\nsense of freedom and of rapid motion, gradually dispelled the confused\nand dejected sort of stupefaction by which Queen Mary was at first\noverwhelmed. She could not at last conceal the change of her feelings to\nthe person who rode at her rein, and who she doubted not was the Father\nAmbrosius; for Seyton, with all the heady impetuosity of a youth, proud,\nand justly so, of his first successful adventure, assumed all the bustle\nand importance of commander of the little party, which escorted, in the\nlanguage of the time, the Fortune of Scotland. He now led the van,\nnow checked his bounding steed till the rear had come up, exhorted the\nleaders to keep a steady, though rapid pace, and commanded those who\nwere hindmost of the party to use their spurs, and allow no interval to\ntake place in their line of march; and anon he was beside the Queen, or\nher ladies, inquiring how they brooked the hasty journey, and whether\nthey had any commands for him. But while Seyton thus busied himself in\nthe general cause with some advantage to the regular order of the march,\nand a good deal of personal ostentation, the horseman who rode beside\nthe Queen gave her his full and undivided attention, as if he had\nbeen waiting upon some superior being. When the road was rugged and\ndangerous, he abandoned almost entirely the care of his own horse, and\nkept his hand constantly upon the Queen's bridle; if a river or larger\nbrook traversed their course, his left arm retained her in the saddle,\nwhile his right held her palfrey's rein.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI had not thought, reverend Father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, when they reached\nthe other bank, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat the convent bred such good horsemen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--The person\nshe addressed sighed, but made no other answer.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know not how it is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said Queen Mary, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut either the sense of freedom, or the pleasure of\nmy favourite exercise, from which I have been so long debarred, or both\ncombined, seem to have given wings to me--no fish ever shot through the\nwater, no bird through the air, with the hurried feeling of liberty\nand rapture with which I sweep through, this night-wind, and over these\nwolds. Nay, such is the magic of feeling myself once more in the\nsaddle, that I could almost swear I am at this moment mounted on my own\nfavourite Rosabelle, who was never matched in Scotland for swiftness,\nfor ease of motion, and for sureness of foot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd if the horse which bears so dear a burden could speak,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered\nthe deep voice of the melancholy George of Douglas, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould she not\nreply, who but Rosabelle ought at such an emergence as this to serve her\nbeloved mistress, or who but Douglas ought to hold her bridle-rein?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nQueen Mary started; she foresaw at once all the evils like to arise to\nherself and him from the deep enthusiastic passion of this youth; but\nher feelings as a woman, grateful at once and compassionate, prevented\nher assuming the dignity of a Queen, and she endeavoured to continue the\nconversation in an indifferent tone.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMethought,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI heard that, at the division of my spoils,\nRosabelle had become the property of Lord Morton's paramour and\nladye-love Alice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe noble palfrey had indeed been destined to so base a lot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered\nDouglas; \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe was kept under four keys, and under the charge of a\nnumerous crew of grooms and domestics--but Queen Mary needed Rosabelle,\nand Rosabelle is here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd was it well, Douglas,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Queen Mary, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen such fearful risks of\nvarious kinds must needs be encountered, that you should augment their\nperils to yourself for a subject of so little moment as a palfrey?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you call that of little moment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Douglas, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich has\nafforded you a moment's pleasure?--Did you not start with joy when I\nfirst said you were mounted on Rosabelle?--And to purchase you that\npleasure, though it were to last no longer than the flash of lightning\ndoth, would not Douglas have risked his life a thousand times?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, peace, Douglas, peace,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is unfitting\nlanguage; and, besides, I would speak,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, recollecting herself,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwith the Abbot of Saint Mary's--Nay, Douglas, I will not let you quit\nmy rein in displeasure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDispleasure, lady!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Douglas: \u00e2\u0080\u009calas! sorrow is all that I can\nfeel for your well-warranted contempt--I should be as soon displeased\nwith Heaven for refusing the wildest wish which mortal can form.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAbide by my rein, however,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mary, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is room for my Lord Abbot\non the other side; and, besides, I doubt if his assistance would be\nso useful to Rosabelle and me as yours has been, should the road again\nrequire it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Abbot came up on the other side, and she immediately opened a\nconversation with him on the topic of the state of parties, and the\nplan fittest for her to pursue inconsequence of her deliverance. In\nthis conversation Douglas took little share, and never but when directly\napplied to by the Queen, while, as before, his attention seemed entirely\nengrossed by the care of Mary's personal safety. She learned, however,\nshe had a new obligation to him, since, by his contrivance, the Abbot,\nwhom he had furnished with the family pass-word, was introduced into the\ncastle as one of the garrison.\n\nLong before daybreak they ended their hasty and perilous journey before\nthe gates of Niddrie, a castle in West Lothian, belonging to Lord\nSeyton. When the Queen was about to alight, Henry Seyton, preventing\nDouglas, received her in his arms, and, kneeling down, prayed her\nMajesty to enter the house of his father, her faithful servant.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour Grace,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmay repose yourself here in perfect safety--it\nis already garrisoned with good men for your protection; and I have sent\na post to my father, whose instant arrival, at the head of five hundred\nmen, may be looked for. Do not dismay yourself, therefore, should your\nsleep be broken by the trampling of horse; but only think that here are\nsome scores more of the saucy Seytons come to attend you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd by better friends than the Saucy Seytons, a Scottish Queen cannot\nbe guarded,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Mary. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRosabelle went fleet as the summer breeze,\nand well-nigh as easy; but it is long since I have been a traveller, and\nI feel that repose will be welcome.--Catherine, _ma mignone_, you\nmust sleep in my apartment to-night, and bid me welcome to your noble\nfather's castle.--Thanks, thanks to all my kind deliverers--thanks, and\na good night is all I can now offer; but if I climb once more to the\nupper side of Fortune's wheel, I will not have her bandage. Mary Stewart\nwill keep her eyes open, and distinguish her friends.--Seyton, I need\nscarcely recommend the venerable Abbot, the Douglas, and my page, to\nyour honour able care and hospitality.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHenry Seyton bowed, and Catherine and Lady Fleming attended the Queen to\nher apartment; where, acknowledging to them that she should have found\nit difficult in that moment to keep her promise of holding her eyes\nopen, she resigned herself to repose, and awakened not till the morning\nwas advanced.\n\nMary's first feeling when she awoke, was the doubt of her freedom; and\nthe impulse prompted her to start from bed, and hastily throwing her\nmantle over her shoulders, to look out at the casement of her apartment.\nOh, sight of joy! instead of the crystal sheet of Lochleven, unaltered\nsave by the influence of the wind, a landscape of wood and moorland lay\nbefore her, and the park around the castle was occupied by the troops of\nher most faithful and most favourite nobles.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRise, rise, Catherine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the enraptured Princess; \u00e2\u0080\u009carise and come\nhither!--here are swords and spears in true hands, and glittering armour\non loyal breasts. Here are banners, my girl, floating in the wind, as\nlightly as summer clouds--Great God! what pleasure to my weary eyes\nto trace their devices--thine own brave father's--the princely\nHamilton's--the faithful Fleming's--See--see--they have caught a glimpse\nof me, and throng towards the window!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe flung the casement open, and with her bare head, from which the\ntresses flew back loose and dishevelled, her fair arm slenderly veiled\nby her mantle, returned by motion and sign the exulting shouts of the\nwarriors, which echoed for many a furlong around. When the first burst\nof ecstatic joy was over, she recollected how lightly she was dressed,\nand, putting her hands to her face, which was covered with blushes at\nthe recollection, withdrew abruptly from the window. The cause of her\nretreat was easily conjectured, and increased the general enthusiasm for\na Princess, who had forgotten her rank in her haste to acknowledge the\nservices of her subjects. The unadorned beauties of the lovely woman,\ntoo, moved the military spectators more than the highest display of her\nregal state might; and what might have seemed too free in her mode of\nappearing before them, was more than atoned for by the enthusiasm of the\nmoment and by the delicacy evinced in her hasty retreat. Often as the\nshouts died away, as often were they renewed, till wood and hill rung\nagain; and many a deep path was made that morning on the cross of the\nsword, that the hand should not part with the weapon, till Mary Stewart\nwas restored to her rights. But what are promises, what the hopes of\nmortals? In ten days, these gallant and devoted votaries were slain,\nwere captives, or had fled.\n\nMary flung herself into the nearest seat, and still blushing, yet half\nsmiling, exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009c_Ma mignone_, what will they think of me?--to show\nmyself to them with my bare feet hastily thrust into the slippers--only\nthis loose mantle about me--my hair loose on my shoulders--my arms and\nneck so bare--Oh, the best they can suppose is, that her abode in yonder\ndungeon has turned their Queen's brain! But my rebel subjects saw me\nexposed when I was in the depth of affliction, why should I hold colder\nceremony with these faithful and loyal men?--Call Fleming, however--I\ntrust she has not forgotten the little mail with my apparel--We must be\nas brave as we can, _mign\u00c3\u00b3ne_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, madam, our good Lady Fleming was in no case to remember any\nthing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou jest, Catherine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, somewhat offended; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is not in\nher nature surely, to forget her duty so far as to leave us without a\nchange of apparel?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRoland Graeme, madam, took care of that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Catherine; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor he\nthrew the mail, with your highness's clothes and jewels, into the boat,\nere he ran back to lock the gate--I never saw so awkward a page as that\nyouth--the packet well-nigh fell on my head.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe shall make thy heart amends, my girl,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Queen Mary, laughing,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cfor that and all other offences given. But call Fleming, and let us put\nourselves into apparel to meet our faithful lords.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSuch had been the preparations, and such was the skill of Lady Fleming,\nthat the Queen appeared before her assembled nobles in such attire as\nbecame, though it could not enhance, her natural dignity. With the most\nwinning courtesy, she expressed to each individual her grateful thanks,\nand dignified not only every noble, but many of the lesser barons by her\nparticular attention.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd whither now, my lords?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat way do your counsels\ndetermine for us?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo Draphane Castle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Lord Arbroath, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif your Majesty is so\npleased; and thence to Dunbarton, to place your Grace's person in\nsafety, after which we long to prove if these traitors will abide us in\nthe field.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd when do we journey?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe propose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Seyton, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif your Grace's fatigue will permit, to\ntake horse after the morning's meal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour pleasure, my Lords, is mine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Queen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe will rule our\njourney by your wisdom now, and hope hereafter to have the advantage of\ngoverning by it our kingdom.--You will permit my ladies and me, my\ngood lords, to break our fasts along with you--We must be half soldiers\nourselves, and set state apart.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLow bowed many a helmeted head at this gracious proffer, when the Queen,\nglancing her eyes through the assembled leaders, missed both Douglas and\nRoland Graeme, and inquired for them in a whisper to Catherine Seyton.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are in yonder oratory, madam, sad enough,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Catherine; and\nthe Queen observed that her favourite's eyes were red with weeping.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis must not be,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cKeep the company amused--I will\nseek them, and introduce them myself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe went into the oratory, where the first she met was George Douglas,\nstanding, or rather reclining, in the recess of a window, his back\nrested against the wall, and his arms folded on his breast. At the sight\nof the Queen he started, and his countenance showed, for an instant,\nan expression of intense delight, which was instantly exchanged for his\nusual deep melancholy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat means this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cDouglas, why does the first deviser and\nbold executor of the happy scheme for our freedom, shun the company of\nhis fellow-nobles, and of the Sovereign whom he has obliged?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Douglas, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthose whom you grace with your presence bring\nfollowers to aid your cause, wealth to support your state,--can offer\nyou halls in which to feast, and impregnable castles for your defence.\nI am a houseless and landless man--disinherited by my mother, and\nlaid under her malediction--disowned by my name and kindred--who bring\nnothing to your standard but a single sword, and the poor life of its\nowner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you mean to upbraid me, Douglas,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cby showing\nwhat you have lost for my sake?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGod forbid, madam!\u00e2\u0080\u009d interrupted the young man, eagerly; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwere it to do\nagain, and had I ten times as much rank and wealth, and twenty times as\nmany friends to lose, my losses would be overpaid by the first step you\nmade, as a free princess, upon the soil of your native kingdom.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what then ails you, that you will not rejoice with those who\nrejoice upon the same joyful occasion?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the youth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d though exheridated and disowned, I am yet\na Douglas: with most of yonder nobles my family have been in feud for\nages--a cold reception amongst them, were an insult, and a kind one yet\nmore humiliating.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor shame, Douglas,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshake off this unmanly\ngloom!--I can make thee match for the best of them in title and fortune,\nand, believe me, I will.--Go then amongst them, I command you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat word,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Douglas, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis enough--I go. This only let me say, that\nnot for wealth or title would I have done that which I have done--Mary\nStewart will not, and the Queen cannot, reward me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, he left the oratory, mingled with the nobles, and placed\nhimself at the bottom of the table. The Queen looked after him, and put\nher kerchief to her eyes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, Our Lady pity me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor no sooner are my prison cares\nended, than those which beset me as a woman and a Queen again thicken\naround me.--Happy Elizabeth! to whom political interest is every thing,\nand whose heart never betrays thy head.--And now must I seek this\nother boy, if I would prevent daggers-drawing betwixt him and the young\nSeyton.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland Graeme was in the same oratory, but at such a distance from\nDouglas, that he could not overhear what passed betwixt the Queen and\nhim. He also was moody and thoughtful, but cleared his brow at the\nQueen's question, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow now, Roland? you are negligent in your attendance\nthis morning. Are you so much overcome with your night's ride?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot so, gracious madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Graeme; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I am told the page of\nLochleven is not the page of Niddrie Castle; and so Master Henry Seyton\nhath in a manner been pleased to supersede my attendance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, Heaven forgive me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow soon these cock-chickens\nbegin to spar!--with children and boys, at least, I may be a queen.--I\nwill have you friends.--Some one send me Henry Seyton hither.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As she\nspoke the last words aloud, the youth whom she had named entered the\napartment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome hither,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHenry Seyton--I will have you give\nyour hand to this youth, who so well aided in the plan of my escape.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWillingly, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Seyton, \u00e2\u0080\u009cso that the youth will grant me,\nas a boon, that he touch not the hand of another Seyton whom he knows\nof. My hand has passed current for hers with him before now--and to win\nmy friendship, he must give up thoughts of my sister's love.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHenry Seyton,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdoes it become you to add any condition\nto my command?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Henry, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am the servant of your Grace's throne, son to\nthe most loyal man in Scotland. Our goods, our castles, our blood, are\nyours: Our honour is in our own keeping. I could say more, but--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, speak on, rude boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat avails it that I am\nreleased from Lochleven, if I am thus enthralled under the yoke of my\npretended deliverers, and prevented from doing justice to one who has\ndeserved as well of me as yourself?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe not in this distemperature for me, sovereign Lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthis young gentleman, being the faithful servant of your Grace, and the\nbrother of Catherine Seyton, bears that about him which will charm down\nmy passion at the hottest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI warn thee once more,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Henry Seyton, haughtily, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you make no\nspeech which may infer that the daughter of Lord Seyton can be aught to\nthee beyond what she is to every churl's blood in Scotland.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Queen was again about to interfere, for Roland's complexion rose,\nand it became somewhat questionable how long his love for Catherine\nwould suppress the natural fire of his temper. But the interposition of\nanother person, hitherto unseen, prevented Mary's interference, There\nwas in the oratory a separate shrine, enclosed with a high screen\nof pierced oak, within which was placed an image of Saint Bennet, of\npeculiar sanctity. From this recess, in which she had been probably\nengaged in her devotions, issued suddenly Magdalen Graeme, and addressed\nHenry Seyton, in reply to his last offensive expressions,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd of\nwhat clay, then, are they moulded these Seytons, that the blood of the\nGraemes may not aspire to mingle with theirs? Know, proud boy, that when\nI call this youth my daughter's child, I affirm his descent from Malise\nEarl of Strathern, called Malise with the Bright Brand; and I trow the\nblood of your house springs from no higher source.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Seyton, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmethinks your sanctity should make you\nsuperior to these worldly vanities; and indeed it seems to have rendered\nyou somewhat oblivious touching them, since, to be of gentle descent,\nthe father's name and lineage must be as well qualified as the\nmother's.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd if I say he comes of the blood of Avenel by the father's side,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n replied Magdalen Graeme, \u00e2\u0080\u009cname I not blood as richly coloured as thine\nown?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf Avenel?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cis my page descended of Avenel?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, gracious Princess, and the last male heir of that ancient\nhouse--Julian Avenel was his father, who fell in battle against the\nSouthron.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have heard the tale of sorrow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit was thy daughter,\nthen, who followed that unfortunate baron to the field, and died on his\nbody? Alas! how many ways does woman's affection find to work out her\nown misery! The tale has oft been told and sung in hall and bower--And\nthou, Roland, art that child of misfortune, who was left among the dead\nand dying? Henry Seyton, he is thine equal in blood and birth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cScarcely so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Henry Seyton, \u00e2\u0080\u009ceven were he legitimate; but if the\ntale be told and sung aright, Julian Avenel was a false knight, and his\nleman a frail and credulous maiden.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, by Heaven, thou liest!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Graeme, and laid his hand on\nhis sword. The entrance of Lord Seyton, however, prevented violence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSave me, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand separate these wild and untamed\nspirits.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow, Henry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Baron, \u00e2\u0080\u009care my castle, and the Queen's presence,\nno checks on thine insolence and impetuosity?--And with whom art thou\nbrawling?--unless my eyes spell that token false, it is with the very\nyouth who aided me so gallantly in the skirmish with the Leslies--Let me\nlook, fair youth, at the medal which thou wearest in thy cap. By Saint\nBennet, it is the same!--Henry, I command thee to forbear him, as thou\nlovest my blessing----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd as you honour my command,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood service hath he\ndone me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied young Seyton, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas when he carried the billet\nenclosed in the sword-sheath to Lochleven--marry, the good youth knew no\nmore than a pack-horse what he was carrying.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I who dedicated him to this great work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Magdalen Graeme--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI,\nby whose advice and agency this just heir hath been unloosed from her\nthraldom--I, who spared not the last remaining hope of a falling house\nin this great action--I, at least, knew and counselled; and what merit\nmay be mine, let the reward, most gracious Queen, descend upon this\nyouth. My ministry here is ended; you are free--a sovereign Princess,\nat the head of a gallant army, surrounded by valiant barons--My service\ncould avail you no farther, but might well prejudice you; your fortune\nnow rests upon men's hearts and men's swords. May they prove as trusty\nas the faith of women!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will not leave us, mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen--\u00e2\u0080\u009cyou whose practices in\nour favour were so powerful, who dared so many dangers, and wore so many\ndisguises, to blind our enemies and to confirm our friends--you will not\nleave us in the dawn of our reviving fortunes, ere we have time to know\nand to thank you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou cannot know her,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Magdalen Graeme, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwho knows not\nherself--there are times, when, in this woman's frame of mine, there is\nthe strength of him of Gath--in this overtoiled brain, the wisdom of the\nmost sage counsellor--and again the mist is on me, and my strength\nis weakness, my wisdom folly. I have spoken before princes and\ncardinals--ay, noble Princess, even before the princes of thine own\nhouse of Lorraine; and I know not whence the words of persuasion came\nwhich flowed from my lips, and were drunk in by their ears.--And now,\neven when I most need words of persuasion, there is something which\nchokes my voice, and robs me of utterance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf there be aught in my power to do thee pleasure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe barely naming it shall avail as well as all thine eloquence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSovereign Lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the enthusiast, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit shames me that at this\nhigh moment something of human frailty should cling to one, whose vows\nthe saints have heard, whose labours in the rightful cause Heaven has\nprospered. But it will be thus while the living spirit is shrined in the\nclay of mortality--I will yield to the folly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, weeping as she\nspoke, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand it shall be the last.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then seizing Roland's hand, she led\nhim to the Queen's feet, kneeling herself upon one knee, and causing him\nto kneel on both. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMighty Princess,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009clook on this flower--it\nwas found by a kindly stranger on a bloody field of battle, and long it\nwas ere my anxious eyes saw, and my arms pressed, all that was left of\nmy only daughter. For your sake, and for that of the holy faith we\nboth profess, I could leave this plant, while it was yet tender, to\nthe nurture of strangers--ay, of enemies, by whom, perchance, his blood\nwould have been poured forth as wine, had the heretic Glendinning known\nthat he had in his house the heir of Julian Avenel. Since then I have\nseen him only in a few hours of doubt and dread, and now I part with the\nchild of my love--for ever--for ever!--Oh, for every weary step I\nhave made in your rightful cause, in this and in foreign lands, give\nprotection to the child whom I must no more call mine!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI swear to you, mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, deeply affected, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat, for\nyour sake and his own, his happiness and fortunes shall be our charge!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thank you, daughter of princes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Magdalen, and pressed her lips,\nfirst to the Queen's hand, then to the brow of her grandson. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n she said, drying her tears, and rising with dignity, \u00e2\u0080\u009cEarth has had\nits own, and Heaven claims the rest.--Lioness of Scotland, go forth and\nconquer! and if the prayers of a devoted votaress can avail thee, they\nwill rise in many a land, and from many a distant shrine. I will glide\nlike a ghost from land to land, from temple to temple; and where the\nvery name of my country is unknown, the priests shall ask who is the\nQueen of that distant northern land, for whom the aged pilgrim was so\nfervent in prayer. Farewell! Honour be thine, and earthly prosperity, if\nit be the will of God--if not, may the penance thou shalt do here ensure\nthee happiness hereafter!--Let no one speak or follow me--my resolution\nis taken--my vow cannot be cancelled.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe glided from their presence as she spoke, and her last look was upon\nher beloved grandchild. He would have risen and followed, but the Queen\nand Lord Seyton interfered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPress not on her now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Seyton, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you would not lose her for\never. Many a time have we seen the sainted mother, and often at the most\nneedful moment; but to press on her privacy, or to thwart her purpose,\nis a crime which she cannot pardon. I trust we shall yet see her at her\nneed--a holy woman she is for certain, and dedicated wholly to prayer\nand penance; and hence the heretics hold her as one distracted, while\ntrue Catholics deem her a saint.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me then hope,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you, my lord, will aid me in\nthe execution of her last request.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat! in the protection of my young second?--cheerfully--that is, in\nall that your majesty can think it fitting to ask of me.--Henry, give\nthy hand upon the instant to Roland Avenel, for so I presume he must now\nbe called.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd shall be Lord of the Barony,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif God prosper our\nrightful arms.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt can only be to restore it to my kind protectress, who now holds it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said young Avenel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would rather be landless, all my life, than she\nlost a rood of ground by me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, looking to Lord Seyton, \u00e2\u0080\u009chis mind matches his\nbirth--Henry, thou hast not yet given thy hand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is his,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Henry, giving it with some appearance of courtesy,\nbut whispering Roland at the same time,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor all this, thou hast not my\nsister's.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMay it please your Grace,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Seyton, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnow that these passages\nare over, to honour our poor meal. Time it were that our banners were\nreflected in the Clyde. We must to horse with as little delay as may\nbe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Thirty-Seventh.\n\n\n  Ay, sir--our ancient crown, in these wild times,\n  Oft stood upon a cast--the gamester's ducat,\n  So often staked, and lost, and then regain'd,\n  Scarce knew so many hazards.\n                          THE SPANISH FATHER.\n\nIt is not our object to enter into the historical part of the reign of\nthe ill-fated Mary, or to recount how, during the week which succeeded\nher flight from Lochleven, her partisans mustered around her with their\nfollowers, forming a gallant army, amounting to six thousand men. So\nmuch light has been lately thrown on the most minute details of the\nperiod, by Mr. Chalmers, in his valuable history of Queen Mary, that the\nreader may be safely referred to it for the fullest information\nwhich ancient records afford concerning that interesting time. It is\nsufficient for our purpose to say, that while Mary's head-quarters\nwere at Hamilton, the Regent and his adherents had, in the King's name,\nassembled a host at Glasgow, inferior indeed to that of the Queen in\nnumbers, but formidable from the military talents of Murray, Morton, the\nLaird of Grange, and others, who had been trained from their youth in\nforeign and domestic wars.\n\nIn these circumstances, it was the obvious policy of Queen Mary to avoid\na conflict, secure that were her person once in safety, the number of\nher adherents must daily increase; whereas, the forces of those opposed\nto her must, as had frequently happened in the previous history of her\nreign, have diminished, and their spirits become broken. And so evident\nwas this to her counsellors, that they resolved their first step should\nbe to place the Queen in the strong castle of Dunbarton, there to await\nthe course of events, the arrival of succours from France, and the\nlevies which were made by her adherents in every province of Scotland.\nAccordingly, orders were given, that all men should be on horseback or\non foot, apparelled in their armour, and ready to follow the Queen's\nstandard in array of battle, the avowed determination being to escort\nher to the Castle of Dunbarton in defiance of her enemies.\n\nThe muster was made upon Hamilton-Moor, and the march commenced in all\nthe pomp of feudal times. Military music sounded, banners and pennons\nwaved, armour glittered far and wide, and spears glanced and twinkled\nlike stars in a frosty sky. The gallant spectacle of warlike parade was\non this occasion dignified by the presence of the Queen herself, who,\nwith a fair retinue of ladies and household attendants, and a\nspecial guard of gentlemen, amongst whom young Seyton and Roland were\ndistinguished, gave grace at once and confidence to the army, which\nspread its ample files before, around, and behind her. Many churchmen\nalso joined the cavalcade, most of whom did not scruple to assume arms,\nand declare their intention of wielding them in defence of Mary and the\nCatholic faith. Not so the Abbot of Saint Mary's. Roland had not seen\nthis prelate since the night of their escape from Lochleven, and he now\nbeheld him, robed in the dress of his order, assume his station near the\nQueen's person. Roland hastened to pull off his basnet, and beseech the\nAbbot's blessing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThou hast it, my son!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the priest; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI see thee now under thy true\nname, and in thy rightful garb. The helmet with the holly branch befits\nyour brows well--I have long waited for the hour thou shouldst assume\nit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen you knew of my descent, my good father?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI did so, but it was under seal of confession from thy grandmother;\nnor was I at liberty to tell the secret, till she herself should make it\nknown.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHer reason for such secrecy, my father?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Avenel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFear, perchance of my brother--a mistaken fear, for Halbert would not,\nto ensure himself a kingdom, have offered wrong to an orphan; besides\nthat, your title, in quiet times, even had your father done your mother\nthat justice which I well hope he did, could not have competed with that\nof my brother's wife, the child of Julian's elder brother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey need fear no competition from me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Avenel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cScotland is\nwide enough, and there are many manors to win, without plundering my\nbenefactor. But prove to me, my reverend father, that my father was just\nto my mother--show me that I may call myself a legitimate Avenel, and\nmake me your bounden slave for ever.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Abbot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hear the Seytons hold thee cheap for that\nstain on thy shield. Something, however, I have learnt from the late\nAbbot Boniface, which, if it prove sooth, may redeem that reproach.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTell me that blessed news,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand the future service of my\nlife--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRash boy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI should but madden thine impatient temper,\nby exciting hopes that may never be fulfilled--and is this a time for\nthem? Think on what perilous march we are bound, and if thou hast a sin\nunconfessed, neglect not the only leisure which Heaven may perchance\nafford thee for confession and absolution.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere will be time enough for both, I trust, when we reach Dunbarton,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n answered the page.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthou crowest as loudly as the rest--but we are\nnot yet at Dunbarton, and there is a lion in the path.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMean you Murray, Morton, and the other rebels at Glasgow, my reverend\nfather? Tush! they dare not look on the royal banner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEven so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Abbot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cspeak many of those who are older, and\nshould be wiser, than thou.--I have returned from the southern shires,\nwhere I left many a chief of name arming in the Queen's interest--I\nleft the lords here wise and considerate men--I find them madmen on my\nreturn--they are willing, for mere pride and vain-glory, to brave the\nenemy, and to carry the Queen, as it were in triumph, past the walls of\nGlasgow, and under the beards of the adverse army.--Seldom does Heaven\nsmile on such mistimed confidence. We shall be encountered, and that to\nthe purpose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd so much the better,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Roland; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe field of battle was my\ncradle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBeware it be not thy dying bed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut what avails it\nwhispering to young wolves the dangers of the chase? You will know,\nperchance, ere this day is out, what yonder men are, whom you hold in\nrash contempt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, what are they?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Henry Seyton, who now joined them: \u00e2\u0080\u009chave\nthey sinews of wire, and flesh of iron?--Will lead pierce and steel cut\nthem?--If so, reverend father, we have little to fear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are evil men,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut the trade of war demands\nno saints.--Murray and Morton are known to be the best generals in\nScotland. No one ever saw Lindesay's or Ruthven's back--Kirkaldy of\nGrange was named by the Constable Montmorency the first soldier in\nEurope--My brother, too good a name for such a cause, has been far and\nwide known for a soldier.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe better, the better!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Seyton, triumphantly; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe shall have all\nthese traitors of rank and name in a fair field before us. Our cause\nis the best, our numbers are the strongest, our hearts and limbs match\ntheirs--Saint Bennet, and set on!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Abbot made no reply, but seemed lost in reflection; and his anxiety\nin some measure communicated itself to Roland Avenel, who ever, as their\nline of march led over a ridge or an eminence, cast an anxious look\ntowards the towers of Glasgow, as if he expected to see symptoms of the\nenemy issuing forth. It was not that he feared the fight, but the issue\nwas of such deep import to his country, and to himself, that the natural\nfire of his spirit burned with a less lively, though with a more intense\nglow. Love, honour, fame, fortune, all seemed to depend on the issue of\none field, rashly hazarded perhaps, but now likely to become unavoidable\nand decisive.\n\nWhen, at length, their march came to be nearly parallel with the city of\nGlasgow, Roland became sensible that the high grounds before them were\nalready in part occupied by a force, showing, like their own, the royal\nbanner of Scotland, and on the point of being supported by columns of\ninfantry and squadrons of horse, which the city gates had poured forth,\nand which hastily advanced to sustain those troops who already possessed\nthe ground in front of the Queen's forces. Horseman after horseman\ngalloped in from the advanced guard, with tidings that Murray had taken\nthe field with his whole army; that his object was to intercept the\nQueen's march, and his purpose unquestionable to hazard a battle. It\nwas now that the tempers of men were subjected to a sudden and a severe\ntrial; and that those who had too presumptuously concluded that they\nwould pass without combat, were something disconcerted, when, at once,\nand with little time to deliberate, they found themselves placed in\nfront of a resolute enemy.--Their chiefs immediately assembled around\nthe Queen, and held a hasty council of war. Mary's quivering lip\nconfessed the fear which she endeavoured to conceal under a bold\nand dignified demeanour. But her efforts were overcome by painful\nrecollections of the disastrous issue of her last appearance in arms at\nCarberry-hill; and when she meant to have asked them their advice for\nordering the battle, she involuntarily inquired whether there were no\nmeans of escaping without an engagement?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEscaping?\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Lord Seyton; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen I stand as one to ten of\nyour Highness's enemies, I may think of escape--but never while I stand\nwith three to two!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBattle! battle!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the assembled lords; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe will drive the\nrebels from their vantage ground, as the hound turns the hare on the\nhill side.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMethinks, my noble lords,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit were as well to prevent\nhis gaining that advantage.--Our road lies through yonder hamlet on the\nbrow, and whichever party hath the luck to possess it, with its little\ngardens and enclosures, will attain a post of great defence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe reverend father is right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, haste thee, Seyton,\nhaste, and get thither before them--they are marching like the wind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSeyton bowed low, and turned his horse's head.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour Highness honours\nme,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will instantly press forward, and seize the pass.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot before me, my lord, whose charge is the command of the vanguard,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said the Lord of Arbroath.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBefore you, or any Hamilton in Scotland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Seyton, \u00e2\u0080\u009chaving the\nQueen's command--Follow me, gentlemen, my vassals and kinsmen--Saint\nBennet, and set on!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd follow me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Arbroath, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy noble kinsmen, and brave\nmen-tenants, we will see which will first reach the post of danger. For\nGod and Queen Mary!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIll-omened haste, and most unhappy strife,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot, who saw\nthem and their followers rush hastily and emulously to ascend the\nheight without waiting till their men were placed in order.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you,\ngentlemen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, addressing Roland and Seyton, who were each\nabout to follow those who hastened thus disorderly to the conflict,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwill you leave the Queen's person unguarded?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, leave me not, gentlemen!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen--\u00e2\u0080\u009cRoland and Seyton,\ndo not leave me--there are enough of arms to strike in this fell\ncombat--withdraw not those to whom I trust for my safety.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe may not leave her Grace,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, looking at Seyton, and\nturning his horse.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI ever looked when thou wouldst find out that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d rejoined the fiery\nyouth.\n\nRoland made no answer, but bit his lip till the blood came, and spurring\nhis horse up to the side of Catherine Seyton's palfrey, he whispered\nin a low voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI never thought to have done aught to deserve you;\nbut this day I have heard myself upbraided with cowardice, and my sword\nremained still sheathed, and all for the love of you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is madness among us all,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the damsel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy father, my\nbrother, and you, are all alike bereft of reason. Ye should think\nonly of this poor Queen, and you are all inspired by your own absurd\njealousies--The monk is the only soldier and man of sense amongst you\nall.--My lord Abbot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried aloud, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwere it not better we should\ndraw to the westward, and wait the event that God shall send us, instead\nof remaining here in the highway, endangering the Queen's person, and\ncumbering the troops in their advance?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou say well, my daughter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Abbot; \u00e2\u0080\u009chad we but one to guide\nus where the Queen's person may be in safety--Our nobles hurry to the\nconflict, without casting a thought on the very cause of the war.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFollow me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a knight, or man-at-arms, well mounted, and attired\ncompletely in black armour, but having the visor of his helmet closed,\nand bearing no crest on his helmet, or device upon his shield.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will follow no stranger,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwithout some warrant of\nhis truth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am a stranger and in your hands,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the horseman; \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you wish to\nknow more of me, the Queen herself will be your warrant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Queen had remained fixed to the spot, as if disabled by fear, yet\nmechanically smiling, bowing, and waving her hand, as banners were\nlowered and spears depressed before her, while, emulating the strife\nbetwixt Seyton and Arbroath, band on band pressed forward their march\ntowards the enemy. Scarce, however, had the black rider whispered\nsomething in her ear, than she assented to what he said; and when he\nspoke aloud, and with an air of command, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGentlemen, it is the Queen's\npleasure that you should follow me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mary uttered, with something like\neagerness, the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAll were in motion in an instant; for the black horseman, throwing off a\nsort of apathy of manner, which his first appearance indicated, spurred\nhis horse to and fro, making him take such active bounds and short\nturns, as showed the rider master of the animal; and getting the Queen's\nlittle retinue in some order for marching, he led them to the left,\ndirecting his course towards a castle, which, crowning a gentle yet\ncommanding eminence, presented an extensive view over the country\nbeneath, and in particular, commanded a view of those heights which both\narmies hastened to occupy, and which it was now apparent must almost\ninstantly be the scene of struggle and dispute.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYonder towers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot, questioning the sable horseman, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto\nwhom do they belong?--and are they in the hands of friends?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are untenanted,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the stranger, \u00e2\u0080\u009cor, at least, they have\nno hostile inmates.--But urge these youths. Sir Abbot, to make more\nhaste--this is but an evil time to satisfy their idle curiosity, by\npeering out upon the battle in which they are to take no share.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe worse luck mine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Henry Seyton, who overheard him--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nwould rather be under my father's banner at this moment than be made\nChamberlain of Holyrood, for this my present duty of peaceful ward well\nand patiently discharged.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour place under your father's banner will shortly be right dangerous,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said Roland Avenel, who, pressing his horse towards the westward,\nhad still his look reverted to the armies; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor I see yonder body of\ncavalry, which presses from the eastward, will reach the village ere\nLord Seyton can gain it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are but cavalry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Seyton, looking attentively; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey cannot\nhold the village without shot of harquebuss.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook more closely,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou will see that each of these\nhorseman who advance so rapidly from Glasgow, carries a footman behind\nhim.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, by Heaven, he speaks well!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the black cavalier; \u00e2\u0080\u009cone of you\ntwo must go carry the news to Lord Seyton and Lord Arbroath, that\nthey hasten not their horsemen on before the foot, but advance more\nregularly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe that my errand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor I first marked the stratagem of\nthe enemy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, by your leave,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Seyton, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyonder is my father's banner\nengaged, and it best becomes me to go to the rescue.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will stand by the Queen's decision,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Avenel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat new appeal?--what new quarrel?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Queen Mary--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre there not\nin yonder dark host enemies enough to Mary Stewart, but must her very\nfriends turn enemies to each other?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe young master of Seyton and I did but\ndispute who should leave your person to do a most needful message to the\nhost. He thought his rank entitled him, and I deemed that the person of\nleast consequence, being myself, were better perilled--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cif one must leave me, be it Seyton.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHenry Seyton bowed till the white plumes on his helmet mixed with the\nflowing mane of his gallant war-horse, then placed himself firm in the\nsaddle, shook his lance aloft with an air of triumph and determination,\nand striking his horse with the spurs, made towards his father's banner,\nwhich was still advancing up the hill, and dashed his steed over every\nobstacle that occurred in his headlong path.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy brother! my father!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Catherine, with an expression\nof agonized apprehension--\u00e2\u0080\u009cthey are in the midst of peril, and I in\nsafety!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWould to God,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I were with them, and could ransom\nevery drop of their blood by two of mine!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo I not know thou dost wish it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine--\u00e2\u0080\u009cCan a woman say to\na man what I have well-nigh said to thee, and yet think that he could\nharbour fear or faintness of heart?--There is that in yon distant sound\nof approaching battle that pleases me even while it affrights me. I\nwould I were a man, that I might feel that stern delight, without the\nmixture of terror!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRide up, ride up, Lady Catherine Seyton,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Abbot, as they\nstill swept on at a rapid pace, and were now close beneath the walls\nof the castle--\u00e2\u0080\u009cride up, and aid Lady Fleming to support the Queen--she\ngives way more and more.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey halted and lifted Mary from the saddle, and were about to\nsupport her towards the castle, when she said faintly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot there--not\nthere--these walls will I never enter more!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe a Queen, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand forget that you are a woman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I must forget much, much more,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the unfortunate Mary,\nin an under tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cere I can look with steady eyes on these well-known\nscenes!--I must forget the days which I spent here as the bride of the\nlost--the murdered----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is the Castle of Crookstone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady Fleming, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin which the\nQueen held her first court after she was married to Darnley.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHeaven,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthy hand is upon us!--Bear yet up,\nmadam--your foes are the foes of Holy Church, and God will this day\ndecide whether Scotland shall be Catholic or heretic.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA heavy and continued fire of cannon and musketry, bore a tremendous\nburden to his words, and seemed far more than they to recall the spirits\nof the Queen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo yonder tree,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, pointing to a yew-tree which grew on a small\nmount close to the castle; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know it well--from thence you may see a\nprospect wide as from the peaks of Schehallion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd freeing herself from her assistants, she walked with a determined,\nyet somewhat wild step, up to the stem of the noble yew. The Abbot,\nCatherine, and Roland Avenel followed her, while Lady Fleming kept back\nthe inferior persons of her train. The black horseman also followed the\nQueen, waiting on her as closely as the shadow upon the light, but ever\nremaining at the distance of two or three yards---he folded his arms on\nhis bosom, turned his back to the battle, and seemed solely occupied by\ngazing on Mary, through the bars of his closed visor. The Queen regarded\nhim not, but fixed her eyes upon the spreading yew.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, fair and stately tree,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, as if at the sight of it she had\nbeen rapt away from the present scene, and had overcome the horror\nwhich had oppressed her at the first approach to Crookstone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere thou\nstandest, gay and goodly as ever, though thou hearest the sounds of war,\ninstead of the vows of love. All is gone since I last greeted thee--love\nand lover--vows and vower--king and kingdom.--How goes the field, my\nLord Abbot?--with us, I trust--yet what but evil can Mary's eyes witness\nfrom this spot?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHer attendants eagerly bent their eyes on the field of battle, but could\ndiscover nothing more than that it was obstinately contested. The small\nenclosures and cottage gardens in the village, of which they had a full\nand commanding view, and which shortly before lay, with their lines of\nsycamore and ash-trees, so still and quiet in the mild light of a May\nsun, were now each converted into a line of fire, canopied by smoke; and\nthe sustained and constant report of the musketry and cannon, mingled\nwith the shouts of meeting combatants, showed that as yet neither party\nhad given ground.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMany a soul finds its final departure to heaven or hell, in these awful\nthunders,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot; \u00e2\u0080\u009clet those that believe in the Holy Church,\njoin me in orisons for victory in this dreadful combat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot here--not here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the unfortunate Queen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cpray not here,\nfather, or pray in silence--my mind is too much torn between the past\nand the present, to dare to approach the heavenly throne--Or, if we\nwill pray, be it for one whose fondest affections have been her greatest\ncrimes, and who has ceased to be a queen, only because she was a\ndeceived and a tender-hearted woman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWere it not well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I rode somewhat nearer the hosts,\nand saw the fate of the day?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo so, in the name of God,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor if our friends are\nscattered, our flight must be hasty--but beware thou approach not too\nnigh the conflict; there is more than thine own life depends on thy safe\nreturn.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, go not too nigh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut fail not to see how the\nSeytons fight, and how they bear themselves.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFear nothing, I will be on my guard,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland Avenel; and without\nwaiting farther answer, rode towards the scene of conflict, keeping, as\nhe rode, the higher and unenclosed ground, and ever looking cautiously\naround him, for fear of involving himself in some hostile party. As he\napproached, the shots rung sharp and more sharply on his ear, the shouts\ncame wilder and wilder, and he felt that thick beating of the heart,\nthat mixture of natural apprehension, intense curiosity, and anxiety for\nthe dubious event, which even the bravest experience when they approach\nalone to a scene of interest and of danger.\n\nAt length he drew so close, that from a bank, screened by bushes and\nunderwood, he could distinctly see where the struggle was most keenly\nmaintained. This was in a hollow way, leading to the village, up\nwhich the Queen's vanguard had marched, with more hasty courage than\nwell-advised conduct, for the purpose of possessing themselves of that\npost of advantage. They found their scheme anticipated, and the hedges\nand enclosures already occupied by the enemy, led by the celebrated\nKirkaldy of Grange and the Earl of Morton; and not small was the loss\nwhich they sustained while struggling forward to come to close with\nthe men-at-arms on the other side. But, as the Queen's followers were\nchiefly noblemen and barons, with their kinsmen and followers, they had\npressed onward, contemning obstacles and danger, and had, when Roland\narrived on the ground, met hand to hand at the gorge of the pass with\nthe Regent's vanguard, and endeavoured to bear them out of the village\nat the spear-point; while their foes, equally determined to keep the\nadvantage which they had attained, struggled with the like obstinacy\nto drive back the assailants. Both parties were on foot, and armed in\nproof; so that, when the long lances of the front ranks were fixed in\neach other's shields, corslets, and breastplates, the struggle resembled\nthat of two bulls, who fixing their frontlets hard against each other,\nremain in that posture for hours, until the superior strength or\nobstinacy of the one compels the other to take to flight, or bears him\ndown to the earth. Thus locked together in the deadly struggle, which\nswayed slowly to and fro, as one or other party gained the advantage,\nthose who fell were trampled on alike by friends and foes; those whose\nweapons were broken, retired from the front rank, and had their place\nsupplied by others; while the rearward ranks, unable otherwise to share\nin the combat, fired their pistols, and hurled their daggers, and the\npoints and truncheons of the broken weapons, like javelins against the\nenemy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGod and the Queen!\u00e2\u0080\u009d resounded from the one party; \u00e2\u0080\u009cGod and the King!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n thundered from the other; while, in the name of their sovereign,\nfellow-subjects on both sides shed each other's blood, and, in the name\nof their Creator, defaced his image. Amid the tumult was often heard the\nvoices of the captains, shouting their commands; of leaders and chiefs,\ncrying their gathering words; of groans and shrieks from the falling and\nthe dying.\n\nThe strife had lasted nearly an hour. The strength of both parties\nseemed exhausted; but their rage was unabated, and their obstinacy\nunsubdued, when Roland, who turned eye and ear to all around him, saw\na column of infantry, headed by a few horsemen, wheel round the base\nof the bank where he had stationed himself, and, levelling their long\nlances, attack the Queen's vanguard, closely engaged as they were in\nconflict on their front. The very first glance showed him that the\nleader who directed this movement was the Knight of Avenel, his ancient\nmaster; and the next convinced him, that its effects would be decisive.\nThe result of the attack of fresh and unbroken forces upon the flank of\nthose already wearied with a long and obstinate struggle, was, indeed,\ninstantaneous.\n\nThe column of the assailants, which had hitherto shown one dark, dense,\nand united line of helmets, surmounted with plumage, was at once\nbroken and hurled in confusion down the hill, which they had so long\nendeavoured to gain. In vain were the leaders heard calling upon their\nfollowers to stand to the combat, and seen personally resisting when all\nresistance was evidently vain. They were slain, or felled to the earth,\nor hurried backwards by the mingled tide of flight and pursuit. What\nwere Roland's feelings on beholding the rout, and feeling that all that\nremained for him was to turn bridle, and endeavour to ensure the safety\nof the Queen's person! Yet, keen as his grief and shame might be,\nthey were both forgotten, when, almost close beneath the bank which\nhe occupied, he saw Henry Seyton forced away from his own party in the\ntumult, covered with dust and blood, and defending himself desperately\nagainst several of the enemy who had gathered around him, attracted by\nhis gay armour. Roland paused not a moment, but pushing his steed down\nthe bank, leaped him amongst the hostile party, dealt three or four\nblows amongst them, which struck down two, and made the rest stand\naloof; then reaching Seyton his hand, he exhorted him to seize fast on\nhis horse's mane.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe live or die together this day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he; \u00e2\u0080\u009ckeep but fast hold till we\nare out of the press, and then my horse is yours.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSeyton heard and exerted his remaining strength, and, by their joint\nefforts, Roland brought him out of danger, and behind the spot from\nwhence he had witnessed the disastrous conclusion of the fight. But\nno sooner were they under shelter of the trees, than Seyton let go his\nhold, and, in spite of Roland's efforts to support him, fell at length\non the turf. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrouble yourself no more with me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is my\nfirst and my last battle--and I have already seen too much to wish\nto see the close. Hasten to save the Queen--and commend me to\nCatherine--she will never more be mistaken for me nor I for her--the\nlast sword-stroke has made an eternal distinction.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me aid you to mount my horse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, eagerly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand you may\nyet be saved--I can find my own way on foot--turn but my horse's head\nwestward, and he will carry you fleet and easy as the wind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will never mount steed more,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the youth; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfarewell--I love thee\nbetter dying, than ever I thought to have done while in life--I would\nthat old man's blood were not on my hand!--_Sancte Benedicte, ora pro\nme_--Stand not to look on a dying man, but haste to save the Queen!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThese words were spoken with the last effort of his voice, and scarce\nwere they uttered ere the speaker was no more. They recalled Roland to\na sense of the duty which he had well-nigh forgotten, but they did not\nreach his ears only.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Queen--where is the Queen?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Halbert Glendinning, who, followed\nby two or three horsemen, appeared at this instant. Roland made no\nanswer, but, turning his horse, and confiding in his speed, gave him at\nonce rein and spur, and rode over height and hollow towards the Castle\nof Crookstone. More heavily armed, and mounted upon a horse of less\nspeed, Sir Halbert Glendinning followed with couched lance, calling out\nas he rode, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSir, with the holly-branch, halt, and show your right to\nbear that badge--fly not thus cowardly, nor dishonour the cognizance\nthou deservest not to wear!--Halt, sir coward, or by Heaven, I will\nstrike thee with my lance on the back, and slay thee like a dastard--I\nam the Knight of Avenel--I am Halbert Glendinning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Roland, who had no purpose of encountering his old master, and who,\nbesides, knew the Queen's safety depended on his making the best speed\nhe could, answered not a word to the defiances and reproaches which Sir\nHalbert continued to throw out against him; but making the best use of\nhis spurs, rode yet harder than before, and had gained about a hundred\nyards upon his pursuer, when, coming near to the yew-tree where he had\nleft the Queen, he saw them already getting to horse, and cried out\nas loud as he could, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFoes! foes!--Ride for it, fair ladies--Brave\ngentlemen, do your devoir to protect them!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, he wheeled his horse, and avoiding the shock of Sir Halbert\nGlendinning, charged one of that Knight's followers, who was nearly on\na line with him, so rudely with his lance, that he overthrew horse and\nman. He then drew his sword and attacked the second, while the black\nman-at-arms, throwing himself in the way of Glendinning, they rushed on\neach other so fiercely, that both horses were overthrown, and the riders\nlay rolling on the plain. Neither was able to arise, for the black\nhorseman was pierced through with Glendinning's lance, and the Knight\nof Avenel, oppressed with the weight of his own horse and sorely bruised\nbesides, seemed in little better plight than he whom he had mortally\nwounded.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYield thee, Sir Knight of Avenel, rescue or no rescue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland,\nwho had put a second antagonist out of condition to combat, and hastened\nto prevent Glendinning from renewing the conflict.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI may not choose but yield,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Halbert, \u00e2\u0080\u009csince I can no longer\nfight; but it shames me to speak such a word to a coward like thee!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCall me not coward,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, lifting his visor, and helping his\nprisoner to rise, \u00e2\u0080\u009csince but for old kindness at thy hands, and yet more\nat thy lady's, I had met thee as a brave man should.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe favourite page of my wife!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Halbert, astonished; \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh!\nwretched boy, I have heard of thy treason at Lochleven.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cReproach him not, my brother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot, \u00e2\u0080\u009che was but an agent in\nthe hands of Heaven.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo horse, to horse!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catherine Seyton; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmount and begone, or we\nare all lost. I see our gallant army flying for many a league--To horse,\nmy Lord Abbot--To horse, Roland--my gracious Liege, to horse! Ere this,\nwe should have ridden many a mile.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook on these features,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mary, pointing to the dying knight, who\nhad been unhelmed by some compassionate hand; \u00e2\u0080\u009clook there, and tell me\nif she who ruins all who love her, ought to fly a foot farther to save\nher wretched life!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe reader must have long anticipated the discovery which the Queen's\nfeelings had made before her eyes confirmed it. It was the features of\nthe unhappy George Douglas, on which death was stamping his mark.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook--look at him well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthus has it been with all who\nloved Mary Stewart!--The royalty of Francis, the wit of Chastelar, the\npower and gallantry of the gay Gordon, the melody of Rizzio, the portly\nform and youthful grace of Darnley, the bold address and courtly\nmanners of Bothwell--and now the deep-devoted passion of the noble\nDouglas--nought could save them!--they looked on the wretched Mary, and\nto have loved her was crime enough to deserve early death! No sooner had\nthe victim formed a kind thought of me, than the poisoned cup, the axe\nand block, the dagger, the mine, were ready to punish them for casting\naway affection on such a wretch as I am!--Importune me not--I will fly\nno farther--I can die but once, and I will die here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhile she spoke, her tears fell fast on the face of the dying man, who\ncontinued to fix his eyes on her with an eagerness of passion, which\ndeath itself could hardly subdue.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cMourn not for me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said faintly,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cbut care for your own safety--I die in mine armour as a Douglas should,\nand I die pitied by Mary Stewart!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe expired with these words, and without withdrawing his eyes from her\nface; and the Queen, whose heart was of that soft and gentle mould,\nwhich in domestic life, and with a more suitable partner than Darnley,\nmight have made her happy, remained weeping by the dead man, until\nrecalled to herself by the Abbot, who found it necessary to use a style\nof unusual remonstrance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe also, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe, your Grace's\ndevoted followers, have friends and relatives to weep for. I leave\na brother in imminent jeopardy--the husband of the Lady Fleming--the\nfather and brothers of the Lady Catherine, are all in yonder bloody\nfield, slain, it is to be feared, or prisoners. We forget the fate\nof our nearest and dearest, to wait on our Queen, and she is too much\noccupied with her own sorrows to give one thought to ours.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI deserve not your reproach, father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, checking her\ntears; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I am docile to it--where must we go--what must we do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe must fly, and that instantly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhither is not so\neasily answered, but we may dispute it upon the road--Lift her to her\nsaddle, and set forward.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n[Footnote: I am informed in the most polite manner, by D. MacVean, Esq.\nof Glasgow, that I have been incorrect in my locality, in giving an\naccount of the battle of Langside. Crookstone Castle, he observes, lies\nfour miles west from the field of battle, and rather in the rear of\nMurray's army. The real place from which Mary saw the rout of her last\narmy, was Cathcart Castle, which, being a mile and a half east from\nLangside, was, situated in the rear of the Queen's own army. I was led\nastray in the present case, by the authority of my deceased friend,\nJames Grahame the excellent and amiable author of the Sabbath, in his\ndrama on the subject of Queen Mary; and by a traditionary report of Mary\nhaving seen the battle from the Castle of Crookstone, which seemed so\nmuch to increase the interest of the scene, that I have been unwilling\nto make, in this particular instance, the fiction give way to the fact,\nwhich last is undoubtedly in favour of Mr. MacVean's system.\n\nIt is singular how tradition, which is sometimes a sure guide to truth,\nis, in other cases, prone to mislead us. In the celebrated field of\nbattle at Killiecrankie, the traveller is struck with one of those\nrugged pillars of rough stone, which indicate the scenes of ancient\nconflict. A friend of the author, well acquainted with the circumstances\nof the battle, was standing near this large stone, and looking on the\nscene around, when a highland shepherd hurried down from the hill to\noffer his services as cicerone, and proceeded to inform him, that Dundee\nwas slain at that stone, which was raised to his memory. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFie, Donald.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n answered my friend, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow can you tell such a story to a stranger? I\nam sure you know well enough that Dundee was killed at a considerable\ndistance from this place, near the house of Fascally, and that this\nstone was here long before the battle, in 1688.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cOich! oich!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nDonald, no way abashed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand your honour's in the right, and I see you\nken a' about it. And he wasna killed on the spot neither, but lived till\nthe next morning; but a' the Saxon gentlemen like best to hear he was\nkilled at the great stane.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It is on the same principle of pleasing my\nreaders, that I retain Crookstone Castle instead of Cathcart.\n\nIf, however, the author has taken a liberty in removing the actual field\nof battle somewhat to the eastward, he has been tolerably strict in\nadhering to the incidents of the engagement, as will appear from it\ncomparison of events in the novel, with the following account from an\nold writer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Regent was out on foot and all his company, except the Laird of\nGrange, Alexander Hume of Manderston, and some borderers to the number\nof two hundred. The Laird of Grange had already viewed the ground, and\nwith all imaginable diligence caused every horseman to take behind him\na footman of the Regent's, to guard behind them, and rode with speed\nto the head of Langside-hill, and set down the footmen with their\nculverings at the head of a straight lane, where there were some cottage\nhouses and yards of great advantage. Which soldiers with their continual\nshot killed divers of the vaunt guard, led by the Hamiltons, who,\ncourageously and fiercely ascending up the hill, were already out of\nbreath, when the Regent's vaunt guard joined with them. Where the\nworthy Lord Hume fought on foot with his pike in his hand very manfully,\nassisted by the Laird of Cessford, his brother-in-law, who helped him up\nagain when he was strucken to the ground by many strokes upon his face,\nthrough the throwing pistols at him after they had been discharged. He\nwas also wounded with staves, and had many strokes of spears through his\nlegs; for he and Grange, at the joining, cried to let their adversaries\nfirst lay down their spears, to bear up theirs; which spears were so\nthick fixed in the others' jacks, that some of the pistols and great\nstaves that were thrown by them which were behind, might be seen lying\nupon the spears.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUpon the Queen's side the Earl of Argyle commanded the battle, and the\nLord of Arbroth the vaunt guard. But the Regent committed to the Laird\nof Grange the special care, as being an experimented captain, to oversee\nevery danger, and to ride to every wing, to encourage and make help\nwhere greatest need was. He perceived, at the first joining, the right\nwing of the Regent's vaunt guard put back and like to fly, whereof the\ngreatest part were commons of the barony of Renfrew; whereupon he rode\nto them, and told them that their enemy was already turning their backs,\nrequesting them to stay and debate till he should bring them fresh men\nforth of the battle. Whither at full speed he did ride alone, and told\nthe Regent that the enemy were shaken and flying away behind the little\nvillage, and desired a few number of fresh men to go with him. Where he\nfound enough willing, as the Lord Lindesay, the Laird of Lochleven,\nSir James Balfour, and all the Regent's servants, who followed him with\ndiligence, and reinforced that wing which was beginning to fly; which\nfresh men with their loose weapons struck the enemies in their flank and\nfaces, which forced them incontinent to give place and turn back after\nlong fighting and pushing others to and fro with their spears. There\nwere not many horsemen to pursue after them, and the Regent cried to\nsave and not to kill, and Grange was never cruel, so that there were few\nslain and taken. And the only slaughter was at the first rencounter\nby the shot of the soldiers, which Grange had planted at the lane head\nbehind some dikes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt is remarkable that, while passing through the small town of Renfrew,\nsome partisans, adherents of the House of Lennox, attempting to arrest\nQueen Mary and her attendants, were obliged to make way for her not\nwithout slaughter.]\n\nThey set off accordingly--Roland lingered a moment to command the\nattendants of the Knight of Avenel to convey their master to the Castle\nof Crookstone, and to say that he demanded from him no other condition\nof liberty, than his word, that he and his followers would keep secret\nthe direction in which the Queen fled. As he turned his rein to\ndepart, the honest countenance of Adam Woodcock stared upon him with an\nexpression of surprise, which, at another time, would have excited his\nhearty mirth. He had been one of the followers who had experienced the\nweight of Roland's arm, and they now knew each other, Roland having put\nup his visor, and the good yeoman having thrown away his barret-cap,\nwith the iron bars in front, that he might the more readily assist his\nmaster. Into this barret-cap, as it lay on the ground, Roland forgot not\nto drop a few gold pieces, (fruits of the Queen's liberality,) and with\na signal of kind recollection and enduring friendship, he departed at\nfull gallop to overtake the Queen, the dust raised by her train being\nalready far down the hill.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not fairy-money,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said honest Adam, weighing and handling the\ngold--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd it was Master Roland himself, that is a certain thing--the\nsame open hand, and, by our Lady!\u00e2\u0080\u009d (shrugging his shoulders)--\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe same\nready fist!--My Lady will hear of this gladly, for she mourns for him as\nif he were her son. And to see how gay he is! But these light lads\nare as sure to be uppermost as the froth to be on the top of the\nquart-pot--Your man of solid parts remains ever a falconer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying,\nhe went to aid his comrades, who had now come up in greater numbers, to\ncarry his master into the Castle of Crookstone.\n\n\n\n\nChapter the Thirty-Eighth.\n\n\n  My native land, good night!\n                            BYRON.\n\nMany a bitter tear was shed, during the hasty flight of Queen Mary, over\nfallen hopes, future prospects, and slaughtered friends. The deaths of\nthe brave Douglas, and of the fiery but gallant young Seyton, seemed to\naffect the Queen as much as the fall from the throne, on which she had\nso nearly been again seated. Catherine Seyton devoured in secret her own\ngrief, anxious to support the broken spirits of her mistress; and the\nAbbot, bending his troubled thoughts upon futurity, endeavoured in\nvain to form some plan which had a shadow of hope. The spirit of young\nRoland--for he also mingled in the hasty debates held by the companions\nof the Queen's flight--continued unchecked and unbroken.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour Majesty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009chas lost a battle--Your ancestor, Bruce, lost\nseven successively, ere he sat triumphant on the Scottish throne, and\nproclaimed with the voice of a victor, in the field of Bannockburn, the\nindependence of his country. Are not these heaths, which we may traverse\nat will, better than the locked, guarded, and lake-moated Castle of\nLochleven?--We are free--in that one word there is comfort for all our\nlosses.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe struck a bold note, but the heart of Mary made no response.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBetter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had still been in Lochleven, than seen the\nslaughter made by rebels among the subjects who offered themselves to\ndeath for my sake. Speak not to me of farther efforts--they would only\ncost the lives of you, the friends who recommend them! I would not again\nundergo what I felt, when I saw from yonder mount the swords of the fell\nhorsemen of Morton raging among the faithful Seytons and Hamiltons, for\ntheir loyalty to their Queen--I would not again feel what I felt when\nDouglas's life-blood stained my mantle for his love to Mary Stewart--not\nto be empress of all that Britain's seas enclose. Find for me some place\nwhere I can hide my unhappy head, which brings destruction on all\nwho love it--it is the last favour that Mary asks of her faithful\nfollowers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn this dejected mood, but still pursuing her flight with unabated\nrapidity, the unfortunate Mary, after having been joined by Lord Herries\nand a few followers, at length halted, for the first time, at the Abbey\nof Dundrennan, nearly sixty miles distant from the field of battle. In\nthis remote quarter of Galloway, the Reformation not having yet been\nstrictly enforced against the monks, a few still lingered in their\ncells unmolested; and the Prior, with tears and reverence, received the\nfugitive Queen at the gate of his convent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI bring you ruin, my good father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, as she was lifted\nfrom her palfrey.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is welcome,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Prior, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif it comes in the train of duty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPlaced on the ground, and supported by her ladies, the Queen looked for\nan instant at her palfrey, which, jaded and drooping its head, seemed as\nif it mourned the distresses of its mistress.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood Roland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Queen, whispering, \u00e2\u0080\u009clet Rosabelle be cared\nfor--ask thy heart, and it will tell thee why I make this trifling\nrequest even in this awful hour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe was conducted to her apartment, and in the hurried consultation\nof her attendants, the fatal resolution of the retreat to England was\nfinally adopted. In the morning it received her approbation, and\na messenger was despatched to the English warden, to pray him for\nsafe-conduct and hospitality, on the part of the Queen of Scotland. On\nthe next day the Abbot Ambrose walked in the garden of the Abbey with\nRoland, to whom he expressed his disapprobation of the course pursued.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is madness and ruin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbetter commit herself to the savage\nHighlanders or wild Bordermen, than to the faith of Elizabeth. A woman\nto a rival woman--a presumptive successor to the keeping of a jealous\nand childless Queen!--Roland, Herries is true and loyal, but his counsel\nhas ruined his mistress.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ruin follows us every where,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said an old man, with a spade in\nhis hand, and dressed like a lay-brother, of whose presence, in the\nvehemence of his exclamation, the Abbot had not been aware--\u00e2\u0080\u009cGaze not on\nme with such wonder!--I am he who was the Abbot Boniface at Kennaquhair,\nwho was the gardener Blinkhoolie at Lochleven, hunted round to the\nplace in which I served my noviciate, and now ye are come to rouse me\nup again!--A weary life I have had for one to whom peace was ever the\ndearest blessing!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will soon rid you of our company, good father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand\nthe Queen will, I fear, trouble your retreat no more.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, you said as much before,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the querulous old man, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand yet I\nwas put forth from Kinross, and pillaged by troopers on the road.--They\ntook from me the certificate that you wot of--that of the Baron--ay,\nhe was a moss-trooper like themselves--You asked me of it, and I could\nnever find it, but they found it--it showed the marriage of--of--my\nmemory fails me--Now see how men differ! Father Nicholas would have\ntold you an hundred tales of the Abbot Ingelram, on whose soul God have\nmercy!--He was, I warrant you, fourscore and six, and I am not more\nthan--let me see----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWas not Avenel the name you seek, my good father?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland,\nimpatiently, yet moderating his tone for fear of alarming or offending\nthe infirm old man.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, right--Avenel, Julian Avenel--You are perfect in the name--I kept\nall the special confessions, judging it held with my vow to do so--I\ncould not find it when my successor, Ambrosius, spoke on't--but the\ntroopers found it, and the Knight who commanded the party struck his\nbreast, till the target clattered like an empty watering-can.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSaint Mary!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin whom could such a paper excite such\ninterest! What was the appearance of the knight, his arms, his colours?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe distract me with your questions--I dared hardly look at him--they\ncharged me with bearing letters for the Queen, and searched my\nmail--This was all along of your doings at Lochleven.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI trust in God,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot to Roland, who stood beside him,\nshivering and trembling \u00e2\u0080\u009cwith impatience,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the paper has fallen into the\nhands of my brother--I heard he had been with his followers on the scout\nbetwixt Stirling and Glasgow.--Bore not the Knight a holly-bough on his\nhelmet?--Canst thou not remember?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, remember--remember,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the old man pettishly; \u00e2\u0080\u009ccount as many\nyears as I do, if your plots will let you, and see what, and how much,\nyou remember.--Why, I scarce remember the pear-mains which I graffed\nhere with my own hands some fifty years since.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this moment a bugle sounded loudly from the beach.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is the death-blast to Queen Mary's royalty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ambrosius; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe\nEnglish warden's answer has been received, favourable doubtless, for\nwhen was the door of the trap closed against the prey which it was set\nfor?--Droop not, Roland--this matter shall be sifted to the bottom--but\nwe must not now leave the Queen--follow me--let us do our duty, and\ntrust the issue with God--Farewell, good Father--I will visit thee again\nsoon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe was about to leave the garden, followed by Roland, with\nhalf-reluctant steps. The Ex-Abbot resumed his spade.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI could be sorry for these men,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cay, and for that poor Queen,\nbut what avail earthly sorrows to a man of fourscore?--and it is a rare\ndropping morning for the early colewort.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is stricken with age,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ambrosius, as he dragged Roland down\nto the sea-beach; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe must let him take his time to collect\nhimself--nothing now can be thought on but the fate of the Queen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey soon arrived where she stood, surrounded by her little train,\nand by her side the sheriff of Cumberland, a gentleman of the house of\nLowther, richly dressed and accompanied by soldiers. The aspect of the\nQueen exhibited a singular mixture of alacrity and reluctance to depart.\nHer language and gestures spoke hope and consolation to her attendants,\nand she seemed desirous to persuade even herself that the step she\nadopted was secure, and that the assurance she had received of kind\nreception was altogether satisfactory; but her quivering lip, and\nunsettled eye, betrayed at once her anguish at departing from Scotland,\nand her fears of confiding herself to the doubtful faith of England.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWelcome, my Lord Abbot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, speaking to Ambrosius, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand you,\nRoland Avenel, we have joyful news for you--our loving sister's officer\nproffers us, in her name, a safe asylum from the rebels who have driven\nus from our home--only it grieves me we must here part from you for a\nshort space.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPart from us, madam!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Abbot. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs your welcome in England,\nthen, to commence with the abridgment of your train, and dismissal of\nyour counsellors?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTake it not thus, good Father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mary; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Warden and the Sheriff,\nfaithful servants of our Royal Sister, deem it necessary to obey her\ninstructions in the present case, even to the letter, and can only\ntake upon them to admit me with my female attendants. An express will\ninstantly be despatched from London, assigning me a place of residence;\nand I will speedily send to all of you whenever my Court shall be\nformed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour Court formed in England! and while Elizabeth lives and reigns?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said the Abbot--\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat will be when we shall see two suns in one heaven!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo not think so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Queen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe are well assured of our\nsister's good faith. Elizabeth loves fame--and not all that she has won\nby her power and her wisdom will equal that which she will acquire by\nextending her hospitality to a distressed sister!--not all that she may\nhereafter do of good, wise, and great, would blot out the reproach of\nabusing our confidence.--Farewell, my page--now my knight--farewell for\na brief season. I will dry the tears of Catherine, or I will weep with\nher till neither of us can weep longer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--She held out her hand to\nRoland, who flinging himself on his knees, kissed it with much emotion.\nHe was about to render the same homage to Catherine, when the Queen,\nassuming an air of sprightliness, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHer lips, thou foolish boy!\nand, Catherine, coy it not--these English gentlemen should see,\nthat, even in our cold clime, Beauty knows how to reward Bravery and\nFidelity!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are not now to learn the force of Scottish beauty, or the mettle of\nScottish valour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Sheriff of Cumberland, courteously--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would\nit were in my power to bid these attendants upon her who is herself\nthe mistress of Scottish beauty, as welcome to England as my poor cares\nwould make them. But our Queen's orders are positive in case of such an\nemergence, and they must not be disputed by her subject.--May I remind\nyour Majesty that the tide ebbs fast?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Sheriff took the Queen's hand, and she had already placed her foot\non the gangway, by which she was to enter the skiff, when the Abbot,\nstarting from a trance of grief and astonishment at the words of the\nSheriff, rushed into the water, and seized upon her mantle.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe foresaw it!--She foresaw it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d--he exclaimed--\u00e2\u0080\u009cshe foresaw your\nflight into her realm; and, foreseeing it, gave orders you should be\nthus received. Blinded, deceived, doomed--Princess! your fate is sealed\nwhen you quit this strand.--Queen of Scotland, thou shalt not leave\nthine heritage!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, holding a still firmer grasp upon her\nmantle; \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrue men shall turn rebels to thy will, that they may save thee\nfrom captivity or death. Fear not the bills and bows whom that gay man\nhas at his beck--we will withstand him by force. Oh, for the arm of my\nwarlike brother!--Roland Avenel, draw thy sword.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Queen stood irresolute and frightened; one foot upon the plank, the\nother on the sand of her native shore, which she was quitting for ever.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat needs this violence, Sir Priest?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Sheriff of Cumberland;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI came hither at your Queen's command, to do her service; and I will\ndepart at her least order, if she rejects such aid as I can offer. No\nmarvel is it if our Queen's wisdom foresaw that such chance as this\nmight happen amidst the turmoils of your unsettled State; and, while\nwilling to afford fair hospitality to her Royal Sister, deemed it wise\nto prohibit the entrance of a broken army of her followers into the\nEnglish frontier.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou hear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Queen Mary, gently unloosing her robe from the Abbot's\ngrasp, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat we exercise full liberty of choice in leaving this shore;\nand, questionless, the choice will remain free to us in going to France,\nor returning to our own dominions, as we shall determine--Besides, it is\ntoo late--Your blessing, Father, and God speed thee!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMay He have mercy on thee, Princess, and speed thee also!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nAbbot, retreating. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut my soul tells me I look on thee for the last\ntime!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The sails were hoisted, the oars were plied, the vessel went\nfreshly on her way through the firth, which divides the shores of\nCumberland from those of Galloway; but not till the vessel diminished\nto the size of a child's frigate, did the doubtful, and dejected, and\ndismissed followers of the Queen cease to linger on the sands; and\nlong, long could they discern the kerchief of Mary, as she waved the\noft-repeated signal of adieu to her faithful adherents, and to the\nshores of Scotland.\n\nIf good tidings of a private nature could have consoled Roland for\nparting with his mistress, and for the distresses of his sovereign,\nhe received such comfort some days subsequent to the Queen's leaving\nDundrennan. A breathless post--no other than Adam Woodcock--brought\ndespatches from Sir Halbert Glendinning to the Abbot, whom he found with\nRoland, still residing at Dundrennan, and in vain torturing Boniface\nwith fresh interrogations. The packet bore an earnest invitation to his\nbrother to make Avenel Castle for a time his residence. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe clemency of\nthe Regent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the writer, \u00e2\u0080\u009chas extended pardon both to Roland and\nto you, upon condition of your remaining a time under my wardship. And\nI have that to communicate respecting the parentage of Roland, which\nnot only you will willingly listen to, but which will be also found to\nafford me, as the husband of his nearest relative, some interest in the\nfuture course of his life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Abbot read this letter, and paused, as if considering what were best\nfor him to do. Meanwhile, Woodcock took Roland side, and addressed him\nas follows:--\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, look, Mr. Roland, that you do not let any papestrie\nnonsense lure either the priest or you from the right quarry. See you,\nyou ever bore yourself as a bit of a gentleman. Read that, and thank\nGod that threw old Abbot Boniface in our way, as two of the Seyton's\nmen were conveying him towards Dundrennan here.--We searched him for\nintelligence concerning that fair exploit of yours at Lochleven, that\nhas cost many a man his life, and me a set of sore bones--and we found\nwhat is better for your purpose than ours.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe paper which he gave, was, indeed, an attestation by Father Philip,\nsubscribing himself unworthy Sacristan, and brother of the House of\nSaint Mary's, stating, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat under a vow of secrecy he had united, in\nthe holy sacrament of marriage, Julian Avenel and Catherine Graeme; but\nthat Julian having repented of his union, he, Father Philip, had been\nsinfully prevailed on by him to conceal and disguise the same, according\nto a complot devised betwixt him and the said Julian Avenel, whereby the\npoor damsel was induced to believe that the ceremony had been performed\nby one not in holy orders, and having no authority to that effect. Which\nsinful concealment the undersigned conceived to be the cause why he was\nabandoned to the misguiding of a water-fiend, whereby he had been under\na spell, which obliged him to answer every question, even touching the\nmost solemn matters, with idle snatches of old songs, besides being\nsorely afflicted with rheumatic pains ever after. Wherefore he had\ndeposited this testificate and confession with the day and date of the\nsaid marriage, with his lawful superior Boniface, Abbot of Saint Mary's,\n_sub sigillo confessionis_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt appeared by a letter from Julian, folded carefully up with the\ncertificate, that the Abbot Boniface had, in effect, bestirred himself\nin the affair, and obtained from the Baron a promise to avow his\nmarriage; but the death of both Julian and his injured bride, together\nwith the Abbot's resignation, his ignorance of the fate of their unhappy\noffspring, and above all, the good father's listless and inactive\ndisposition, had suffered the matter to become totally forgotten, until\nit was recalled by some accidental conversation with the Abbot Ambrosius\nconcerning the fortunes of the Avenel family. At the request of his\nsuccessor, the quondam Abbot made search for it; but as he would receive\nno assistance in looking among the few records of spiritual experiences\nand important confessions, which he had conscientiously treasured,\nit might have remained for ever hidden amongst them, but for the more\nactive researches of Sir Halbert Glendinning.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo that you are like to be heir of Avenel at last, Master Roland, after\nmy lord and lady have gone to their place,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Adam; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand as I have\nbut one boon to ask, I trust you will not nick me with nay.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot if it be in my power to say yes, my trusty friend.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy then, I must needs, if I live to see that day, keep on feeding the\neyases with unwashed flesh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Woodcock sturdily, as if doubting the\nreception that his request might meet with.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThou shalt feed them with what you list for me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, laughing;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not many months older than when I left the Castle, but I trust I\nhave gathered wit enough to cross no man of skill in his own vocation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen I would not change places with the King's falconer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Adam\nWoodcock, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnor with the Queen's neither--but they say she will be mewed\nup and never need one.--I see it grieves you to think of it, and I could\ngrieve for company; but what help for it?--Fortune will fly her own\nflight, let a man hollo himself hoarse.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Abbot and Roland journeyed to Avenel, where the former was tenderly\nreceived by his brother, while the lady wept for joy to find that in her\nfavourite orphan she had protected the sole surviving branch of her\nown family. Sir Halbert Glendinning and his household were not a little\nsurprised at the change which a brief acquaintance with the world had\nproduced in their former inmate, and rejoiced to find, in the pettish,\nspoiled, and presuming page, a modest and unassuming young man, too\nmuch acquainted with his own expectations and character, to be hot\nor petulant in demanding the consideration which was readily and\nvoluntarily yielded to him. The old Major Domo Wingate was the first\nto sing his praises, to which Mistress Lilias bore a loud echo, always\nhoping that God would teach him the true gospel.\n\nTo the true gospel the heart of Roland had secretly long inclined, and\nthe departure of the good Abbot for France, with the purpose of\nentering into some house of his order in that kingdom, removed his chief\nobjection to renouncing the Catholic faith. Another might have existed\nin the duty which he owed to Magdalen Graeme, both by birth and from\ngratitude. But he learned, ere he had been long a resident in Avenel,\nthat his grandmother had died at Cologne, in the performance of a\npenance too severe for her age, which she had taken upon herself in\nbehalf of the Queen and Church of Scotland, as soon as she heard of the\ndefeat at Langside. The zeal of the Abbot Ambrosius was more regulated;\nbut he retired into the Scottish convent of------, and so lived there,\nthat the fraternity were inclined to claim for him the honours of\ncanonization. But he guessed their purpose, and prayed them, on his\ndeath-bed, to do no honours to the body of one as sinful as themselves;\nbut to send his body and his heart to be buried in Avenel burial-aisle,\nin the monastery of Saint Mary's, that the last Abbot of that celebrated\nhouse of devotion might sleep among its ruins.\n\n[Footnote: This was not the explanation of the incident of searching for\nthe heart, mentioned in the introduction to the tale, which the author\noriginally intended. It was designed to refer to the heart of Robert\nBruce. It is generally known that that great monarch, being on his\ndeath-bed, bequeathed to the good Lord James of Douglas, the task of\ncarrying his heart to the Holy Land, to fulfil in a certain degree his\nown desire to perform a crusade. Upon Douglas's death, fighting against\nthe Moors in Spain, a sort of military hors d'oeuvre to which he could\nhave pleaded no regular call of duty, his followers brought back the\nBruce's heart, and deposited it in the Abbey church of Melrose, the\nKennaquhair of the tale.\n\nThis Abbey has been always particularly favoured by the Bruce. We have\nalready seen his extreme anxiety that each of the reverend brethren\nshould be daily supplied with a service of boiled almonds, rice and\nmilk, pease, or the like, to be called the King's mess, and that without\nthe ordinary service of their table being either disturbed in quantity\nor quality. But this was not the only mark of the benignity of good King\nRobert towards the monks of Melrose, since, by a charter of the dale\n29th May, 1326, he conferred on the Abbot of Melrose the sum of two\nthousand pounds sterling, for rebuilding: the church of St. Mary's,\nruined by the English; and there is little or no doubt that the\nprincipal part of the remains which now display such exquisite specimens\nof Gothic architecture, at its very purest period, had their origin in\nthis munificent donation. The money was to be paid out of crown lands,\nestates forfeited to the King, and other property or demesnes of the\ncrown.\n\nA very curious letter written to his son about three weeks before his\ndeath, has been pointed out to me by my friend Mr. Thomas Thomson,\nDeputy-Register for Scotland. It enlarges so much on the love of the\nroyal writer to the community of Melrose, that it is well worthy of\nbeing inserted in a work connected in some degree with Scottish History.\n\nLITERA DOMINI REGIS ROBERTI AD FILIUM SUUM DAVID.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRobertius dei gratia Rex Scottorum, David precordialissimo filio suo,\nac ceteris successoribus suis; Salutem, et sic ejus precepta tenere,\nut cum sua benedictione possint regnare.

The\nletter announces that the King had already destined his heart to be\ndeposited at Melrose. The resolution to send it to Palestine, under the\ncharge of Douglas, must have been adopted betwixt 11th May 1329, the\ndate of the letter, and 7th June of the same year, when the Bruce died;\nor else we must suppose that the commission of Douglas extended not only\nto taking the Bruce's heart to Palestine, but to bring it safe back to\nits final place of deposit in the Abbey of Melrose.\n\nIt would not be worth inquiring: by what caprice the author was induced\nto throw the incident of the Bruce's heart entirely out of the story,\nsave merely to say, that he found himself unable to fill up the canvass\nhe had sketched, and indisposed to prosecute the management of\nthe supernatural machinery with which his plan, when it was first\nrough-hewn, was connected and combined.]\n\nLong before that period arrived, Roland Avenel was wedded to Catherine\nSeyton, who, after two years' residence with her unhappy mistress, was\ndismissed upon her being subjected to closer restraint than had been at\nfirst exercised. She returned to her father's house, and as Roland was\nacknowledged for the successor and lawful heir of the ancient house of\nAvenel, greatly increased as the estate was by the providence of Sir\nHalbert Gleninning, there occurred no objections to the match on the\npart of her family. Her mother was recently dead when she first entered\nthe convent; and her father, in the unsettled times which followed Queen\nMary's flight to England, was not averse to an alliance with a youth,\nwho, himself loyal to Queen Mary, still held some influence, through\nmeans of Sir Halbert Glendinning, with the party in power.\n\nRoland and Catherine, therefore, were united, spite of their differing\nfaiths; and the White Lady, whose apparition had been infrequent when\nthe house of Avenel seemed verging to extinction, was seen to sport by\nher haunted well, with a zone of gold around her bosom as broad as the\nbaldrick of an Earl.\n\nEND OF THE ABBOT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Abbot, by Sir Walter Scott\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ABBOT ***\n\n***** This file should be named 6407-0.txt or 6407-0.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/6\/4\/0\/6407\/\n\nProduced by Alan Millar, David Moynihan, Charles Franks\nand the Online Distributed Proofreading Team\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.  Email\ncontact links and up to date contact information can be found at the\nFoundation's web site and official page at www.gutenberg.org\/contact\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n","id":236,"split":"train"}
