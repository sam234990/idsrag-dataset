Tommy goes to Mathew Mugg to find out where the doctor lives who tells him that the Doctor can speak the language of animals so they go to his house but find out he's gone away on a voyage and is guarded by the his dog Jip. Later the Doctor comes home to meet Tommy and takes care of his squirrel then explains when Tommy see's a strange fish creature in his house that it's a Wiff-Waff and is trying to learn shellfish language but eventually he quits it as it is too hard to study. Unexpectedly Polynesia turns up in Puddleby from Africa who imforms the Doctor that Bumpo is studying in Bullford then Tommy gets the Doctor, with the help of Poynesia, to teach him the animal languages. After Polynesia teaches Tommy the language of animals, so he can understand Jip and Dub-Dub, Chee-Chee comes from Africa disguised as a lady and tells about his voyage to Puddleby. The Doctor then gets a vessel called The Curlew and is thinking of taking Tommy, Polynesia, and Luke the Hermit. They find out from the hermit's dog, Bob, that he was sent to prison for murder but Bob is a witness so when the court is in process the Doctor proves to the judge that he can talk to animals, when this is settled he translates Bob's story to english. When the story is finished the judges conclude that the hermit is innocent.\nLater the Purple Bird of Paradise informs the Doctor that Long Arrow, son of Golden Arrow, who is a friend of the Doctor, is missing so after they play the game Blind Travel, which would determine where in the world they would voyage, they decide to take a trip to Spider Monkey Island to find Long Arrow. The Doctor, Tommy, Bumpo, Polynesia and Mathew start the voyage across the sea but on the way they discover some stowaways and drop them off at the coast off Puddleby. Their first stop is Spain where a bullfight is in process so the Doctor makes a deal with the bullfighters that if he can beat them in a fight they would agree to stop bullfighting ever again. The Doctor talks to the bulls and they agreed to stick to the plan to make everyone think that he outwitted them. When the fight is over and the doctor wins against the other bullfighters the people protest because of bullfighting being banned. When the doctor and his crew set off again the Doctor shows Tommy he has caught a fidgit that talks english so he consults it and finds out that to go underwater deeper to observe the ocean is to find the Pink Sea Snail.\nAfterwards there is a storm which wrecks the ship leaving Tommy alone without anyone in sight then the Purple Bird of Paradise tells him that his friends are on Spider Monkey Island so with the help of the porpoises Tommy reaches the island and the crew. The doctor finds out from catching a Jabizri, a rare beetle, that Long Arrow is stuck inside Hawk's Head Mountain so they try to find an opening but fail so they use the Jabizri to locate it. When the find a slab in the mountain they dig under it until it collapses and Long Arrow is free. The Doctor finds out from the people of the island that the island is going southward and is going to perish so the doctor gets some whales to push the island back to South America. After this the Doctor is told by the Popsipetels, the people of the island, that they will be attacked soon by their rivals the Bag-jagderags so the Doctor uses the birds of the island as well as the Popsipetels to battle them. The Doctor and his army win but the people then decide after so much he did for them that they would crown him king of their island. So for many months the doctor rules the island and makes good changes for the Popsipetels and everything as he stays king. One day though Polynesia spots the Pink Sea Snail so she and Tommy tell the Doctor about it which makes him interested in speaking shellfish language again. He talks to the Pink Sea Snail and learns that it is because of the island colliding with South America that it ends up on the shores of Spider Monkey Island so the Doctor asks the snail to take him in his shell with his crew back to England. The Doctor abandons Spider Monkey Island and sets off with Polynesia, Tommy, Mathew, Chee-Chee and Jip and makes his journey through the ocean in the shell of the Pink Sea Snail. When they come back to England the Doctor and his crew go back to Puddleby in the doctor's house and Dub-Dub says they are just in time for tea.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Voyages of Dr. Dolittle, by Hugh Lofting\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most\nother parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions\nwhatsoever.

But I now come to set down that part of the\ngreat man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life which I myself saw and took part in.\n\nMany years ago the Doctor gave me permission to do this. But we were\nboth of us so busy then voyaging around the world, having adventures\nand filling note-books full of natural history that I never seemed to\nget time to sit down and write of our doings.\n\nNow of course, when I am quite an old man, my memory isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so good any\nmore. But whenever I am in doubt and have to hesitate and think, I\nalways ask Polynesia, the parrot.\n\nThat wonderful bird (she is now nearly two hundred and fifty years old)\nsits on the top of my desk, usually humming sailor songs to herself,\nwhile I write this book. And, as every one who ever met her knows,\nPolynesia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s memory is the most marvelous memory in the world. If\nthere is any happening I am not quite sure of, she is always able to\nput me right, to tell me exactly how it took place, who was there and\neverything about it. In fact sometimes I almost think I ought to say\nthat this book was written by Polynesia instead of me.\n\nVery well then, I will begin. And first of all I must tell you\nsomething about myself and how I came to meet the Doctor.\n\n\n\n\nPART I\n\n\n\n\n_THE FIRST CHAPTER_\n\nTHE COBBLER\u00e2\u0080\u0099S SON\n\n\nMY name was Tommy Stubbins, son of Jacob Stubbins, the cobbler of\nPuddleby-on-the-Marsh; and I was nine and a half years old. At that\ntime Puddleby was only quite a small town. A river ran through the\nmiddle of it; and over this river there was a very old stone bridge,\ncalled Kingsbridge, which led you from the market-place on one side to\nthe churchyard on the other.\n\nSailing-ships came up this river from the sea and anchored near the\nbridge. I used to go down and watch the sailors unloading the ships\nupon the river-wall. The sailors sang strange songs as they pulled upon\nthe ropes; and I learned these songs by heart. And I would sit on the\nriver-wall with my feet dangling over the water and sing with the men,\npretending to myself that I too was a sailor.\n\nFor I longed always to sail away with those brave ships when they\nturned their backs on Puddleby Church and went creeping down the river\nagain, across the wide lonely marshes to the sea. I longed to go with\nthem out into the world to seek my fortune in foreign lands\u00e2\u0080\u0094Africa,\nIndia, China and Peru! When they got round the bend in the river and\nthe water was hidden from view, you could still see their huge brown\nsails towering over the roofs of the town, moving onward slowly\u00e2\u0080\u0094like\nsome gentle giants that walked among the houses without noise. What\nstrange things would they have seen, I wondered, when next they came\nback to anchor at Kingsbridge! And, dreaming of the lands I had never\nseen, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d sit on there, watching till they were out of sight.\n\nThree great friends I had in Puddleby in those days. One was Joe, the\nmussel-man, who lived in a tiny hut by the edge of the water under the\nbridge. This old man was simply marvelous at making things. I never saw\na man so clever with his hands. He used to mend my toy ships for me\nwhich I sailed upon the river; he built windmills out of packing-cases\nand barrel-staves; and he could make the most wonderful kites from old\numbrellas.\n\nJoe would sometimes take me in his mussel-boat, and when the tide\nwas running out we would paddle down the river as far as the edge of\nthe sea to get mussels and lobsters to sell. And out there on the\ncold lonely marshes we would see wild geese flying, and curlews and\nredshanks and many other kinds of seabirds that live among the samfire\nand the long grass of the great salt fen. And as we crept up the river\nin the evening, when the tide had turned, we would see the lights\non Kingsbridge twinkle in the dusk, reminding us of tea-time and warm\nfires.\n\n[Illustration: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would sit on the river-wall with my feet dangling\nover the water\u00e2\u0080\u009d]\n\nAnother friend I had was Matthew Mugg, the cat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s-meat-man. He was a\nfunny old person with a bad squint. He looked rather awful but he\nwas really quite nice to talk to. He knew everybody in Puddleby;\nand he knew all the dogs and all the cats. In those times being a\ncat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s-meat-man was a regular business. And you could see one nearly any\nday going through the streets with a wooden tray full of pieces of meat\nstuck on skewers crying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMeat! M-E-A-T!\u00e2\u0080\u009d People paid him to give this\nmeat to their cats and dogs instead of feeding them on dog-biscuits or\nthe scraps from the table.\n\nI enjoyed going round with old Matthew and seeing the cats and dogs\ncome running to the garden-gates whenever they heard his call.\nSometimes he let me give the meat to the animals myself; and I thought\nthis was great fun. He knew a lot about dogs and he would tell me\nthe names of the different kinds as we went through the town. He had\nseveral dogs of his own; one, a whippet, was a very fast runner, and\nMatthew used to win prizes with her at the Saturday coursing races;\nanother, a terrier, was a fine ratter. The cat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s-meat-man used to make\na business of rat-catching for the millers and farmers as well as his\nother trade of selling cat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s-meat.\n\nMy third great friend was Luke the Hermit. But of him I will tell you\nmore later on.\n\nI did not go to school; because my father was not rich enough to send\nme. But I was extremely fond of animals. So I used to spend my time\ncollecting birds\u00e2\u0080\u0099 eggs and butterflies, fishing in the river, rambling\nthrough the countryside after blackberries and mushrooms and helping\nthe mussel-man mend his nets.\n\nYes, it was a very pleasant life I lived in those days long ago\u00e2\u0080\u0094though\nof course I did not think so then. I was nine and a half years old;\nand, like all boys, I wanted to grow up\u00e2\u0080\u0094not knowing how well off I was\nwith no cares and nothing to worry me. Always I longed for the time\nwhen I should be allowed to leave my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house, to take passage\nin one of those brave ships, to sail down the river through the misty\nmarshes to the sea\u00e2\u0080\u0094out into the world to seek my fortune.\n\n\n\n\n_THE SECOND CHAPTER_\n\nI HEAR OF THE GREAT NATURALIST\n\n\nONE early morning in the Springtime, when I was wandering among the\nhills at the back of the town, I happened to come upon a hawk with a\nsquirrel in its claws. It was standing on a rock and the squirrel was\nfighting very hard for its life. The hawk was so frightened when I came\nupon it suddenly like this, that it dropped the poor creature and flew\naway. I picked the squirrel up and found that two of its legs were\nbadly hurt. So I carried it in my arms back to the town.\n\nWhen I came to the bridge I went into the mussel-man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hut and asked\nhim if he could do anything for it. Joe put on his spectacles and\nexamined it carefully. Then he shook his head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYon crittur\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got a broken leg,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cand another badly cut an\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nall. I can mend you your boats, Tom, but I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the tools nor the\nlearning to make a broken squirrel seaworthy. This is a job for a\nsurgeon\u00e2\u0080\u0094and for a right smart one an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 all. There be only one man I know\nwho could save yon crittur\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s John Dolittle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho is John Dolittle?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs he a vet?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the mussel-man. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no vet. Doctor Dolittle is a\nnacheralist.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a nacheralist?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA nacheralist,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Joe, putting away his glasses and starting to\nfill his pipe, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis a man who knows all about animals and butterflies\nand plants and rocks an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 all. John Dolittle is a very great\nnacheralist. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m surprised you never heard of him\u00e2\u0080\u0094and you daft over\nanimals. He knows a whole lot about shellfish\u00e2\u0080\u0094that I know from my own\nknowledge. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a quiet man and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk much; but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s folks who\ndo say he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the greatest nacheralist in the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere does he live?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOver on the Oxenthorpe Road, t\u00e2\u0080\u0099other side the town. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know just\nwhich house it is, but \u00e2\u0080\u0099most anyone \u00e2\u0080\u0099cross there could tell you, I\nreckon. Go and see him. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo I thanked the mussel-man, took up my squirrel again and started off\ntowards the Oxenthorpe Road.\n\nThe first thing I heard as I came into the market-place was some one\ncalling \u00e2\u0080\u009cMeat! M-E-A-T!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Matthew Mugg,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said to myself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll know where this Doctor\nlives. Matthew knows everyone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo I hurried across the market-place and caught him up.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMatthew,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo you know Doctor Dolittle?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo I know John Dolittle!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I should think I do! I know\nhim as well as I know my own wife\u00e2\u0080\u0094better, I sometimes think. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a\ngreat man\u00e2\u0080\u0094a very great man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCan you show me where he lives?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to take this\nsquirrel to him. It has a broken leg.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCertainly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the cat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s-meat-man. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be going right by his house\ndirectly. Come along and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll show you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo off we went together.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve known John Dolittle for years and years,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Matthew as we\nmade our way out of the market-place. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pretty sure he ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nhome just now. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s away on a voyage. But he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s liable to be back any\nday. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll show you his house and then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll know where to find him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAll the way down the Oxenthorpe Road Matthew hardly stopped talking\nabout his great friend, Doctor John Dolittle\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cM. D.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He talked so much\nthat he forgot all about calling out \u00e2\u0080\u009cMeat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d until we both suddenly\nnoticed that we had a whole procession of dogs following us patiently.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere did the Doctor go to on this voyage?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked as Matthew handed\nround the meat to them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNobody never knows where he goes,\nnor when he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going, nor when he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming back. He lives all alone\nexcept for his pets. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s made some great voyages and some wonderful\ndiscoveries. Last time he came back he told me he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d found a tribe of\nRed Indians in the Pacific Ocean\u00e2\u0080\u0094lived on two islands, they did. The\nhusbands lived on one island and the wives lived on the other. Sensible\npeople, some of them savages. They only met once a year, when the\nhusbands came over to visit the wives for a great feast\u00e2\u0080\u0094Christmas-time,\nmost likely. Yes, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a wonderful man is the Doctor. And as for\nanimals, well, there ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t no one knows as much about \u00e2\u0080\u0099em as what he\ndoes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow did he get to know so much about animals?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\nThe cat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s-meat-man stopped and leant down to whisper in my ear.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_He talks their language_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in a hoarse, mysterious voice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe animals\u00e2\u0080\u0099 language?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy certainly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Matthew. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll animals have some kind of a\nlanguage. Some sorts talk more than others; some only speak in\nsign-language, like deaf-and-dumb. But the Doctor, he understands them\nall\u00e2\u0080\u0094birds as well as animals. We keep it a secret though, him and me,\nbecause folks only laugh at you when you speak of it. Why, he can\neven write animal-language. He reads aloud to his pets. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrote\nhistory-books in monkey-talk, poetry in canary language and comic\nsongs for magpies to sing. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fact. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now busy learning the\nlanguage of the shellfish. But he says it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard work\u00e2\u0080\u0094and he has caught\nsome terrible colds, holding his head under water so much. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great\nman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe certainly must be,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do wish he were home so I could meet\nhim.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s his house, look,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the cat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s-meat-man\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat little\none at the bend in the road there\u00e2\u0080\u0094the one high up\u00e2\u0080\u0094like it was sitting\non the wall above the street.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe were now come beyond the edge of the town. And the house that\nMatthew pointed out was quite a small one standing by itself. There\nseemed to be a big garden around it; and this garden was much higher\nthan the road, so you had to go up a flight of steps in the wall before\nyou reached the front gate at the top. I could see that there were many\nfine fruit trees in the garden, for their branches hung down over the\nwall in places. But the wall was so high I could not see anything else.\n\nWhen we reached the house Matthew went up the steps to the front gate\nand I followed him. I thought he was going to go into the garden; but\nthe gate was locked. A dog came running down from the house; and he\ntook several pieces of meat which the cat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s-meat-man pushed through\nthe bars of the gate, and some paper bags full of corn and bran. I\nnoticed that this dog did not stop to eat the meat, as any ordinary\ndog would have done, but he took all the things back to the house and\ndisappeared. He had a curious wide collar round his neck which looked\nas though it were made of brass or something. Then we came away.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Doctor isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t back yet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Matthew, \u00e2\u0080\u009cor the gate wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be\nlocked.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat were all those things in paper-bags you gave the dog?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, those were provisions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Matthew\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cthings for the animals to\neat. The Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house is simply full of pets. I give the things to\nthe dog, while the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s away, and the dog gives them to the other\nanimals.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what was that curious collar he was wearing round his neck?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a solid gold dog-collar,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Matthew. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was given to him\nwhen he was with the Doctor on one of his voyages long ago. He saved a\nman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow long has the Doctor had him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, a long time. Jip\u00e2\u0080\u0099s getting pretty old now. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why the Doctor\ndoesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take him on his voyages any more. He leaves him behind to take\ncare of the house. Every Monday and Thursday I bring the food to the\ngate here and give it him through the bars. He never lets any one come\ninside the garden while the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s away\u00e2\u0080\u0094not even me, though he knows\nme well. But you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll always be able to tell if the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back or\nnot\u00e2\u0080\u0094because if he is, the gate will surely be open.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo I went off home to my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house and put my squirrel to bed in\nan old wooden box full of straw. And there I nursed him myself and took\ncare of him as best I could till the time should come when the Doctor\nwould return. And every day I went to the little house with the big\ngarden on the edge of the town and tried the gate to see if it were\nlocked. Sometimes the dog, Jip, would come down to the gate to meet\nme. But though he always wagged his tail and seemed glad to see me, he\nnever let me come inside the garden.\n\n\n\n\n_THE THIRD CHAPTER_\n\nTHE DOCTOR\u00e2\u0080\u0099S HOME\n\n\nONE Monday afternoon towards the end of April my father asked me to\ntake some shoes which he had mended to a house on the other side of the\ntown. They were for a Colonel Bellowes who was very particular.\n\nI found the house and rang the bell at the front door. The Colonel\nopened it, stuck out a very red face and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGo round to the\ntradesmen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entrance\u00e2\u0080\u0094go to the back door.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then he slammed the door\nshut.\n\nI felt inclined to throw the shoes into the middle of his flower-bed.\nBut I thought my father might be angry, so I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. I went round\nto the back door, and there the Colonel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife met me and took the\nshoes from me. She looked a timid little woman and had her hands all\nover flour as though she were making bread. She seemed to be terribly\nafraid of her husband whom I could still hear stumping round the house\nsomewhere, grunting indignantly because I had come to the front door.\nThen she asked me in a whisper if I would have a bun and a glass of\nmilk. And I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, please.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAfter I had eaten the bun and milk, I thanked the Colonel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife and\ncame away. Then I thought that before I went home I would go and see\nif the Doctor had come back yet. I had been to his house once already\nthat morning. But I thought I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d just like to go and take another look.\nMy squirrel wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t getting any better and I was beginning to be worried\nabout him.\n\nSo I turned into the Oxenthorpe Road and started off towards the\nDoctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house. On the way I noticed that the sky was clouding over and\nthat it looked as though it might rain.\n\nI reached the gate and found it still locked. I felt very discouraged.\nI had been coming here every day for a week now. The dog, Jip, came to\nthe gate and wagged his tail as usual, and then sat down and watched me\nclosely to see that I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get in.\n\nI began to fear that my squirrel would die before the Doctor came back.\nI turned away sadly, went down the steps on to the road and turned\ntowards home again.\n\nI wondered if it were supper-time yet. Of course I had no watch of my\nown, but I noticed a gentleman coming towards me down the road; and\nwhen he got nearer I saw it was the Colonel out for a walk. He was all\nwrapped up in smart overcoats and mufflers and bright-colored gloves.\nIt was not a very cold day but he had so many clothes on he looked\nlike a pillow inside a roll of blankets. I asked him if he would please\ntell me the time.\n\nHe stopped, grunted and glared down at me\u00e2\u0080\u0094his red face growing redder\nstill; and when he spoke it sounded like the cork coming out of a\ngingerbeer-bottle.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you imagine for one moment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he spluttered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I am going to get\nmyself all unbuttoned just to tell a little boy like you _the time_!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAnd he went stumping down the street, grunting harder than ever.\n\nI stood still a moment looking after him and wondering how old I would\nhave to be, to have him go to the trouble of getting his watch out. And\nthen, all of a sudden, the rain came down in torrents.\n\nI have never seen it rain so hard. It got dark, almost like night. The\nwind began to blow; the thunder rolled; the lightning flashed, and in a\nmoment the gutters of the road were flowing like a river. There was no\nplace handy to take shelter, so I put my head down against the driving\nwind and started to run towards home.\n\nI hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t gone very far when my head bumped into something soft and\nI sat down suddenly on the pavement. I looked up to see whom I had\nrun into. And there in front of me, sitting on the wet pavement like\nmyself, was a little round man with a very kind face. He wore a shabby\nhigh hat and in his hand he had a small black bag.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m very sorry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had my head down and I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see you\ncoming.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTo my great surprise, instead of getting angry at being knocked down,\nthe little man began to laugh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know this reminds me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cof a time once when I was in\nIndia. I ran full tilt into a woman in a thunderstorm. But she was\ncarrying a pitcher of molasses on her head and I had treacle in my hair\nfor weeks afterwards\u00e2\u0080\u0094the flies followed me everywhere. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hurt\nyou, did I?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m all right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was just as much my fault as it was yours, you know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nlittle man. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had my head down too\u00e2\u0080\u0094but look here, we mustn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sit\ntalking like this. You must be soaked. I know I am. How far have you\ngot to go?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy home is on the other side of the town,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, as we picked\nourselves up.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy Goodness, but that _was_ a wet pavement!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I declare\nit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming down worse than ever. Come along to my house and get dried.\nA storm like this can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t last.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe took hold of my hand and we started running back down the road\ntogether. As we ran I began to wonder who this funny little man could\nbe, and where he lived. I was a perfect stranger to him, and yet\nhe was taking me to his own home to get dried. Such a change, after\nthe old red-faced Colonel who had refused even to tell me the time!\nPresently we stopped.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere we are,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nI looked up to see where we were and found myself back at the foot\nof the steps leading to the little house with the big garden! My new\nfriend was already running up the steps and opening the gate with some\nkeys he took from his pocket.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSurely,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I thought, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis cannot be the great Doctor Dolittle himself!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI suppose after hearing so much about him I had expected some one very\ntall and strong and marvelous. It was hard to believe that this funny\nlittle man with the kind smiling face could be really he. Yet here he\nwas, sure enough, running up the steps and opening the very gate which\nI had been watching for so many days!\n\nThe dog, Jip, came rushing out and started jumping up on him and\nbarking with happiness. The rain was splashing down heavier than ever.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you Doctor Dolittle?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I shouted as we sped up the short\ngarden-path to the house.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m Doctor Dolittle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, opening the front door with the\nsame bunch of keys. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGet in! Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother about wiping your feet. Never\nmind the mud. Take it in with you. Get in out of the rain!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI popped in, he and Jip following. Then he slammed the door to behind\nus.\n\nThe storm had made it dark enough outside; but inside the house,\nwith the door closed, it was as black as night. Then began the most\nextraordinary noise that I have ever heard. It sounded like all sorts\nand kinds of animals and birds calling and squeaking and screeching\nat the same time. I could hear things trundling down the stairs and\nhurrying along passages. Somewhere in the dark a duck was quacking,\na cock was crowing, a dove was cooing, an owl was hooting, a lamb\nwas bleating and Jip was barking. I felt birds\u00e2\u0080\u0099 wings fluttering\nand fanning near my face. Things kept bumping into my legs and\nnearly upsetting me. The whole front hall seemed to be filling up\nwith animals. The noise, together with the roaring of the rain, was\ntremendous; and I was beginning to grow a little bit scared when I felt\nthe Doctor take hold of my arm and shout into my ear.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be alarmed. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be frightened. These are just some of my pets.\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been away three months and they are glad to see me home again.\nStand still where you are till I strike a light. My Gracious, what a\nstorm!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Just listen to that thunder!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo there I stood in the pitch-black dark, while all kinds of animals\nwhich I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see chattered and jostled around me. It was a curious\nand a funny feeling. I had often wondered, when I had looked in from\nthe front gate, what Doctor Dolittle would be like and what the funny\nlittle house would have inside it. But I never imagined it would be\nanything like this. Yet somehow after I had felt the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand upon\nmy arm I was not frightened, only confused. It all seemed like some\nqueer dream; and I was beginning to wonder if I was really awake, when\nI heard the Doctor speaking again:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy blessed matches are all wet. They won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t strike. Have you got any?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I called back.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever mind,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps Dab-Dab can raise us a light somewhere.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen the Doctor made some funny clicking noises with his tongue and I\nheard some one trundle up the stairs again and start moving about in\nthe rooms above.\n\nThen we waited quite a while without anything happening.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill the light be long in coming?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSome animal is sitting on\nmy foot and my toes are going to sleep.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, only a minute,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be back in a minute.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd just then I saw the first glimmerings of a light around the landing\nabove. At once all the animals kept quiet.\n\n[Illustration: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd in her right foot she carried a lighted candle!\u00e2\u0080\u009d]\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought you lived alone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said to the Doctor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo I do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is Dab-Dab who is bringing the light.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI looked up the stairs trying to make out who was coming. I could not\nsee around the landing but I heard the most curious footstep on the\nupper flight. It sounded like some one hopping down from one step to\nthe other, as though he were using only one leg.\n\nAs the light came lower, it grew brighter and began to throw strange\njumping shadows on the walls.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh\u00e2\u0080\u0094at last!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood old Dab-Dab!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd then I thought I _really_ must be dreaming. For there, craning her\nneck round the bend of the landing, hopping down the stairs on one leg,\ncame a spotless white duck. And in her right foot she carried a lighted\ncandle!\n\n\n\n\n_THE FOURTH CHAPTER_\n\nTHE WIFF-WAFF\n\n\nWHEN at last I could look around me I found that the hall was indeed\nsimply full of animals. It seemed to me that almost every kind of\ncreature from the countryside must be there: a pigeon, a white rat, an\nowl, a badger, a jackdaw\u00e2\u0080\u0094there was even a small pig, just in from the\nrainy garden, carefully wiping his feet on the mat while the light from\nthe candle glistened on his wet pink back.\n\nThe Doctor took the candlestick from the duck and turned to me.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou must get those wet clothes off\u00e2\u0080\u0094by the way,\nwhat is your name?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTommy Stubbins,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, are you the son of Jacob Stubbins, the shoemaker?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cExcellent bootmaker, your father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see these?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nand he held up his right foot to show me the enormous boots he was\nwearing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour father made me those boots four years ago, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve\nbeen wearing them ever since\u00e2\u0080\u0094perfectly wonderful boots\u00e2\u0080\u0094Well now, look\nhere, Stubbins. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to change those wet things\u00e2\u0080\u0094and quick. Wait\na moment till I get some more candles lit, and then we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go upstairs\nand find some dry clothes. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to wear an old suit of mine till\nwe can get yours dry again by the kitchen-fire.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo presently when more candles had been lighted round different parts\nof the house, we went upstairs; and when we had come into a bedroom the\nDoctor opened a big wardrobe and took out two suits of old clothes.\nThese we put on. Then we carried our wet ones down to the kitchen and\nstarted a fire in the big chimney. The coat of the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s which I was\nwearing was so large for me that I kept treading on my own coat-tails\nwhile I was helping to fetch the wood up from the cellar. But very\nsoon we had a huge big fire blazing up the chimney and we hung our wet\nclothes around on chairs.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cook some supper,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll stay and have\nsupper with me, Stubbins, of course?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAlready I was beginning to be very fond of this funny little man who\ncalled me \u00e2\u0080\u009cStubbins,\u00e2\u0080\u009d instead of \u00e2\u0080\u009cTommy\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009clittle lad\u00e2\u0080\u009d (I did so\nhate to be called \u00e2\u0080\u009clittle lad\u00e2\u0080\u009d!) This man seemed to begin right away\ntreating me as though I were a grown-up friend of his. And when he\nasked me to stop and have supper with him I felt terribly proud and\nhappy. But I suddenly remembered that I had not told my mother that I\nwould be out late. So very sadly I answered,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you very much. I would like to stay, but I am afraid that my\nmother will begin to worry and wonder where I am if I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, but my dear Stubbins,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, throwing another log of\nwood on the fire, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour clothes aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t dry yet. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to wait\nfor them, won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you? By the time they are ready to put on we will have\nsupper cooked and eaten\u00e2\u0080\u0094Did you see where I put my bag?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it is still in the hall,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go and see.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI found the bag near the front door. It was made of black leather and\nlooked very, very old. One of its latches was broken and it was tied up\nround the middle with a piece of string.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor when I brought it to him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWas that bag all the luggage you had for your voyage?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, as he undid the piece of string. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nbelieve in a lot of baggage. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s such a nuisance. Life\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too short to\nfuss with it. And it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really necessary, you know\u00e2\u0080\u0094Where _did_ I put\nthose sausages?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Doctor was feeling about inside the bag. First he brought out a\nloaf of new bread. Next came a glass jar with a curious metal top to\nit. He held this up to the light very carefully before he set it down\nupon the table; and I could see that there was some strange little\nwater-creature swimming about inside. At last the Doctor brought out a\npound of sausages.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009call we want is a frying-pan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe went into the scullery and there we found some pots and pans hanging\nagainst the wall. The Doctor took down the frying-pan. It was quite\nrusty on the inside.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDear me, just look at that!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the worst of being away\nso long. The animals are very good and keep the house wonderfully clean\nas far as they can. Dab-Dab is a perfect marvel as a housekeeper.\nBut some things of course they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t manage. Never mind, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll soon\nclean it up. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find some silver-sand down there, under the sink,\nStubbins. Just hand it up to me, will you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn a few moments we had the pan all shiny and bright and the sausages\nwere put over the kitchen-fire and a beautiful frying smell went all\nthrough the house.\n\nWhile the Doctor was busy at the cooking I went and took another look\nat the funny little creature swimming about in the glass jar.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is this animal?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, turning round\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a Wiff-Waff. Its\nfull name is _hippocampus pippitopitus_. But the natives just call\nit a Wiff-Waff\u00e2\u0080\u0094on account of the way it waves its tail, swimming,\nI imagine. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I went on this last voyage for, to get that.\nYou see I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m very busy just now trying to learn the language of the\nshellfish. They _have_ languages, of that I feel sure. I can talk\na little shark language and porpoise dialect myself. But what I\nparticularly want to learn now is shellfish.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, you see, some of the shellfish are the oldest kind of animals in\nthe world that we know of. We find their shells in the rocks\u00e2\u0080\u0094turned to\nstone\u00e2\u0080\u0094thousands of years old. So I feel quite sure that if I could only\nget to talk their language, I should be able to learn a whole lot about\nwhat the world was like ages and ages and ages ago. You see?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t some of the other animals tell you as well?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, prodding the sausages with a fork.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be sure, the monkeys I knew in Africa some time ago were very\nhelpful in telling me about bygone days; but they only went back a\nthousand years or so. No, I am certain that the oldest history in the\nworld is to be had from the shellfish\u00e2\u0080\u0094and from them only. You see most\nof the other animals that were alive in those very ancient times have\nnow become extinct.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you learned any shellfish language yet?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve only just begun. I wanted this particular kind of a pipe-fish\nbecause he is half a shellfish and half an ordinary fish. I went all\nthe way to the Eastern Mediterranean after him. But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m very much\nafraid he isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to be a great deal of help to me. To tell you the\ntruth, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m rather disappointed in his appearance. He doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t _look_\nvery intelligent, does he?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I agreed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe sausages are done to a turn. Come\nalong\u00e2\u0080\u0094hold your plate near and let me give you some.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen we sat down at the kitchen-table and started a hearty meal.\n\nIt was a wonderful kitchen, that. I had many meals there afterwards\nand I found it a better place to eat in than the grandest dining-room\nin the world. It was so cozy and home-like and warm. It was so handy\nfor the food too. You took it right off the fire, hot, and put it on\nthe table and ate it. And you could watch your toast toasting at the\nfender and see it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t burn while you drank your soup. And if you\nhad forgotten to put the salt on the table, you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to get up\nand go into another room to fetch it; you just reached round and took\nthe big wooden box off the dresser behind you. Then the fireplace\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\nbiggest fireplace you ever saw\u00e2\u0080\u0094was like a room in itself. You could get\nright inside it even when the logs were burning and sit on the wide\nseats either side and roast chestnuts after the meal was over\u00e2\u0080\u0094or listen\nto the kettle singing, or tell stories, or look at picture-books by the\nlight of the fire. It was a marvelous kitchen. It was like the Doctor,\ncomfortable, sensible, friendly and solid.\n\nWhile we were gobbling away, the door suddenly opened and in marched\nthe duck, Dab-Dab, and the dog, Jip, dragging sheets and pillow-cases\nbehind them over the clean tiled floor. The Doctor, seeing how\nsurprised I was, explained:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just going to air the bedding for me in front of the fire.\nDab-Dab is a perfect treasure of a housekeeper; she never forgets\nanything. I had a sister once who used to keep house for me (poor, dear\nSarah! I wonder how she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s getting on\u00e2\u0080\u0094I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen her in many years).\nBut she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t nearly as good as Dab-Dab. Have another sausage?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Doctor turned and said a few words to the dog and duck in some\nstrange talk and signs. They seemed to understand him perfectly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCan you talk in squirrel language?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh yes. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite an easy language,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou could\nlearn that yourself without a great deal of trouble. But why do you\nask?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause I have a sick squirrel at home,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI took it away from\na hawk. But two of its legs are badly hurt and I wanted very much to\nhave you see it, if you would. Shall I bring it to-morrow?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, if its leg is badly broken I think I had better see it to-night.\nIt may be too late to do much; but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come home with you and take a\nlook at it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo presently we felt the clothes by the fire and mine were found to be\nquite dry. I took them upstairs to the bedroom and changed, and when I\ncame down the Doctor was all ready waiting for me with his little black\nbag full of medicines and bandages.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome along,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe rain has stopped now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOutside it had grown bright again and the evening sky was all red with\nthe setting sun; and thrushes were singing in the garden as we opened\nthe gate to go down on to the road.\n\n\n\n\n_THE FIFTH CHAPTER_\n\nPOLYNESIA\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI THINK your house is the most interesting house I was ever in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\nsaid as we set off in the direction of the town. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMay I come and see\nyou again to-morrow?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCertainly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome any day you like. To-morrow I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nshow you the garden and my private zoo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, have you a zoo?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe larger animals are too big for the house, so I\nkeep them in a zoo in the garden. It is not a very big collection but\nit is interesting in its way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt must be splendid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto be able to talk all the languages of\nthe different animals. Do you think I could ever learn to do it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh surely,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cwith practise. You have to be very\npatient, you know. You really ought to have Polynesia to start you. It\nwas she who gave me my first lessons.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho is Polynesia?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPolynesia was a West African parrot I had. She isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t with me any more\nnow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor sadly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy\u00e2\u0080\u0094is she dead?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is still living, I hope. But when we\nreached Africa she seemed so glad to get back to her own country. She\nwept for joy. And when the time came for me to come back here I had not\nthe heart to take her away from that sunny land\u00e2\u0080\u0094although, it is true,\nshe did offer to come. I left her in Africa\u00e2\u0080\u0094Ah well! I have missed her\nterribly. She wept again when we left. But I think I did the right\nthing. She was one of the best friends I ever had. It was she who\nfirst gave me the idea of learning the animal languages and becoming\nan animal doctor. I often wonder if she remained happy in Africa, and\nwhether I shall ever see her funny, old, solemn face again\u00e2\u0080\u0094Good old\nPolynesia!\u00e2\u0080\u0094A most extraordinary bird\u00e2\u0080\u0094Well, well!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJust at that moment we heard the noise of some one running behind us;\nand turning round we saw Jip the dog rushing down the road after us,\nas fast as his legs could bring him. He seemed very excited about\nsomething, and as soon as he came up to us, he started barking and\nwhining to the Doctor in a peculiar way. Then the Doctor too seemed to\nget all worked up and began talking and making queer signs to the dog.\nAt length he turned to me, his face shining with happiness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPolynesia has come back!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried. \u00e2\u0080\u009cImagine it. Jip says she has just\narrived at the house. My! And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s five years since I saw her\u00e2\u0080\u0094Excuse\nme a minute.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe turned as if to go back home. But the parrot, Polynesia, was already\nflying towards us. The Doctor clapped his hands like a child getting\na new toy; while the swarm of sparrows in the roadway fluttered,\ngossiping, up on to the fences, highly scandalized to see a gray and\nscarlet parrot skimming down an English lane.\n\nOn she came, straight on to the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulder, where she\nimmediately began talking a steady stream in a language I could not\nunderstand. She seemed to have a terrible lot to say. And very soon\nthe Doctor had forgotten all about me and my squirrel and Jip and\neverything else; till at length the bird clearly asked him something\nabout me.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh excuse me, Stubbins!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was so interested\nlistening to my old friend here. We must get on and see this squirrel\nof yours\u00e2\u0080\u0094Polynesia, this is Thomas Stubbins.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe parrot, on the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulder, nodded gravely towards me and\nthen, to my great surprise, said quite plainly in English,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do you do? I remember the night you were born. It was a terribly\ncold winter. You were a very ugly baby.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStubbins is anxious to learn animal language,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was\njust telling him about you and the lessons you gave me when Jip ran up\nand told us you had arrived.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the parrot, turning to me, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI may have started the Doctor\nlearning but I never could have done even that, if he hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t first\ntaught me to understand what _I_ was saying when I spoke English.\nYou see, many parrots can talk like a person, but very few of them\nunderstand what they are saying. They just say it because\u00e2\u0080\u0094well, because\nthey fancy it is smart or, because they know they will get crackers\ngiven them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBy this time we had turned and were going towards my home with Jip\nrunning in front and Polynesia still perched on the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulder.\nThe bird chattered incessantly, mostly about Africa; but now she spoke\nin English, out of politeness to me.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow is Prince Bumpo getting on?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the Doctor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad you asked me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polynesia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI almost forgot to tell\nyou. What do you think?\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Bumpo is in England!_\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn England!\u00e2\u0080\u0094You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat on earth is he\ndoing here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHis father, the king, sent him here to a place called\u00e2\u0080\u0094er\u00e2\u0080\u0094Bullford, I\nthink it was\u00e2\u0080\u0094to study lessons.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBullford!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Bullford!\u00e2\u0080\u009d muttered the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI never heard of the\nplace\u00e2\u0080\u0094Oh, you mean Oxford.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the place\u00e2\u0080\u0094Oxford,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polynesia \u00e2\u0080\u009cI knew it had cattle in\nit somewhere. Oxford\u00e2\u0080\u0094that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the place he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d murmured the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFancy Bumpo studying at\nOxford\u00e2\u0080\u0094Well, well!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere were great doings in Jolliginki when he left. He was scared to\ndeath to come. He was the first man from that country to go abroad. He\nthought he was going to be eaten by white cannibals or something. You\nknow what those niggers are\u00e2\u0080\u0094that ignorant! Well!\u00e2\u0080\u0094But his father made\nhim come. He said that all the black kings were sending their sons to\nOxford now. It was the fashion, and he would have to go. Bumpo wanted\nto bring his six wives with him. But the king wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let him do that\neither. Poor Bumpo went off in tears\u00e2\u0080\u0094and everybody in the palace was\ncrying too. You never heard such a hullabaloo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you know if he ever went back in search of The Sleeping Beauty?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nasked the Doctor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polynesia\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe day after you left. And a good thing for\nhim he did: the king got to know about his helping you to escape; and\nhe was dreadfully wild about it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd The Sleeping Beauty?\u00e2\u0080\u0094did he ever find her?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, he brought back something which he _said_ was The Sleeping\nBeauty. Myself, I think it was an albino niggeress. She had red hair\nand the biggest feet you ever saw. But Bumpo was no end pleased with\nher and finally married her amid great rejoicings. The feastings lasted\nseven days. She became his chief wife and is now known out there as the\nCrown-Princess Bum_pah_\u00e2\u0080\u0094you accent the last syllable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd tell me, did he remain white?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly for about three months,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the parrot. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter that his face\nslowly returned to its natural color. It was just as well. He was so\nconspicuous in his bathing-suit the way he was, with his face white and\nthe rest of him black.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd how is Chee-Chee getting on?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Chee-Chee,\u00e2\u0080\u009d added the Doctor in\nexplanation to me, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas a pet monkey I had years ago. I left him too in\nAfrica when I came away.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polynesia frowning,\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cChee-Chee is not entirely happy. I\nsaw a good deal of him the last few years. He got dreadfully homesick\nfor you and the house and the garden. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s funny, but I was just the\nsame way myself. You remember how crazy I was to get back to the dear\nold land? And Africa _is_ a wonderful country\u00e2\u0080\u0094I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care what anybody\nsays. Well, I thought I was going to have a perfectly grand time. But\nsomehow\u00e2\u0080\u0094I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know\u00e2\u0080\u0094after a few weeks it seemed to get tiresome. I\njust couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to settle down. Well, to make a long story short,\none night I made up my mind that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d come back here and find you. So\nI hunted up old Chee-Chee and told him about it. He said he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nblame me a bit\u00e2\u0080\u0094felt exactly the same way himself. Africa was so deadly\nquiet after the life we had led with you. He missed the stories you\nused to tell us out of your animal books\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the chats we used to have\nsitting round the kitchen-fire on winter nights. The animals out there\nwere very nice to us and all that. But somehow the dear kind creatures\nseemed a bit stupid. Chee-Chee said he had noticed it too. But I\nsuppose it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they who had changed; it was we who were different.\nWhen I left, poor old Chee-Chee broke down and cried. He said he felt\nas though his only friend were leaving him\u00e2\u0080\u0094though, as you know, he has\nsimply millions of relatives there. He said it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem fair that I\nshould have wings to fly over here any time I liked, and him with no\nway to follow me. But mark my words, I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be a bit surprised if\nhe found a way to come\u00e2\u0080\u0094some day. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a smart lad, is Chee-Chee.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this point we arrived at my home. My father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shop was closed and\nthe shutters were up; but my mother was standing at the door looking\ndown the street.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood evening, Mrs. Stubbins,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is my fault your\nson is so late. I made him stay to supper while his clothes were\ndrying. He was soaked to the skin; and so was I. We ran into one\nanother in the storm and I insisted on his coming into my house for\nshelter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was beginning to get worried about him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said my mother. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am\nthankful to you, Sir, for looking after him so well and bringing him\nhome.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mention it\u00e2\u0080\u0094don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mention it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have had a\nvery interesting chat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho might it be that I have the honor of addressing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked my mother\nstaring at the gray parrot perched on the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulder.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m John Dolittle. I dare say your husband will remember me. He\nmade me some very excellent boots about four years ago. They really\nare splendid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d added the Doctor, gazing down at his feet with great\nsatisfaction.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Doctor has come to cure my squirrel, Mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe knows\nall about animals.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot all, Stubbins, not all about them by\nany means.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is very kind of you to come so far to look after his pet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said my\nmother. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTom is always bringing home strange creatures from the woods\nand the fields.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs he?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps he will grow up to be a naturalist\nsome day. Who knows?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you come in?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked my mother. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe place is a little untidy\nbecause I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t finished the spring cleaning yet. But there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a nice\nfire burning in the parlor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a charming home you have!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd after wiping his enormous boots very, very carefully on the mat,\nthe great man passed into the house.\n\n\n\n\n_THE SIXTH CHAPTER_\n\nTHE WOUNDED SQUIRREL\n\n\nINSIDE we found my father busy practising on the flute beside the fire.\nThis he always did, every evening, after his work was over.\n\nThe Doctor immediately began talking to him about flutes and piccolos\nand bassoons; and presently my father said,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps you perform upon the flute yourself, Sir. Won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you play us a\ntune?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is a long time since I touched the\ninstrument. But I would like to try. May I?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen the Doctor took the flute from my father and played and played and\nplayed. It was wonderful. My mother and father sat as still as statues,\nstaring up at the ceiling as though they were in church; and even I,\nwho didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother much about music except on the mouth-organ\u00e2\u0080\u0094even I\nfelt all sad and cold and creepy and wished I had been a better boy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh I think that was just beautiful!\u00e2\u0080\u009d sighed my mother when at length\nthe Doctor stopped.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are a great musician, Sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said my father, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca very great\nmusician. Won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you please play us something else?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy certainly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, but look here, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve forgotten all\nabout the squirrel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll show him to you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is upstairs in my room.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo I led the Doctor to my bedroom at the top of the house and showed\nhim the squirrel in the packing-case filled with straw.\n\nThe animal, who had always seemed very much afraid of me\u00e2\u0080\u0094though I had\ntried hard to make him feel at home, sat up at once when the Doctor\ncame into the room and started to chatter. The Doctor chattered back\nin the same way and the squirrel when he was lifted up to have his leg\nexamined, appeared to be rather pleased than frightened.\n\nI held a candle while the Doctor tied the leg up in what he called\n\u00e2\u0080\u009csplints,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which he made out of match-sticks with his pen-knife.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think you will find that his leg will get better now in a very short\ntime,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor closing up his bag. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let him run about for\nat least two weeks yet, but keep him in the open air and cover him up\nwith dry leaves if the nights get cool. He tells me he is rather lonely\nhere, all by himself, and is wondering how his wife and children are\ngetting on. I have assured him you are a man to be trusted; and I will\nsend a squirrel who lives in my garden to find out how his family are\nand to bring him news of them. He must be kept cheerful at all costs.\nSquirrels are naturally a very cheerful, active race. It is very hard\nfor them to lie still doing nothing. But you needn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry about him.\nHe will be all right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen we went back again to the parlor and my mother and father kept him\nplaying the flute till after ten o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock.\n\nAlthough my parents both liked the Doctor tremendously from the first\nmoment that they saw him, and were very proud to have him come and play\nto us (for we were really terribly poor) they did not realize then\nwhat a truly great man he was one day to become. Of course now, when\nalmost everybody in the whole world has heard about Doctor Dolittle and\nhis books, if you were to go to that little house in Puddleby where\nmy father had his cobbler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shop you would see, set in the wall over\nthe old-fashioned door, a stone with writing on it which says: \u00e2\u0080\u009cJOHN\nDOLITTLE, THE FAMOUS NATURALIST, PLAYED THE FLUTE IN THIS HOUSE IN THE\nYEAR 1839.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI often look back upon that night long, long ago. And if I close my\neyes and think hard I can see that parlor just as it was then: a funny\nlittle man in coat-tails, with a round kind face, playing away on the\nflute in front of the fire; my mother on one side of him and my father\non the other, holding their breath and listening with their eyes shut;\nmyself, with Jip, squatting on the carpet at his feet, staring into the\ncoals; and Polynesia perched on the mantlepiece beside his shabby high\nhat, gravely swinging her head from side to side in time to the music.\nI see it all, just as though it were before me now.\n\nAnd then I remember how, after we had seen the Doctor out at the front\ndoor, we all came back into the parlor and talked about him till it\nwas still later; and even after I did go to bed (I had never stayed up\nso late in my life before) I dreamed about him and a band of strange\nclever animals that played flutes and fiddles and drums the whole night\nthrough.\n\n\n\n\n_THE SEVENTH CHAPTER_\n\nSHELLFISH TALK\n\n\nTHE next morning, although I had gone to bed so late the night before,\nI was up frightfully early. The first sparrows were just beginning to\nchirp sleepily on the slates outside my attic window when I jumped out\nof bed and scrambled into my clothes.\n\nI could hardly wait to get back to the little house with the big\ngarden\u00e2\u0080\u0094to see the Doctor and his private zoo. For the first time in\nmy life I forgot all about breakfast; and creeping down the stairs on\ntip-toe, so as not to wake my mother and father, I opened the front\ndoor and popped out into the empty, silent street.\n\nWhen I got to the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gate I suddenly thought that perhaps it was\ntoo early to call on any one: and I began to wonder if the Doctor would\nbe up yet. I looked into the garden. No one seemed to be about. So I\nopened the gate quietly and went inside.\n\nAs I turned to the left to go down a path between some hedges, I heard\na voice quite close to me say,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood morning. How early you are!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI turned around, and there, sitting on the top of a privet hedge, was\nthe gray parrot, Polynesia.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood morning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose I am rather early. Is the Doctor\nstill in bed?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polynesia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe has been up an hour and a half. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nfind him in the house somewhere. The front door is open. Just push it\nand go in. He is sure to be in the kitchen cooking breakfast\u00e2\u0080\u0094or working\nin his study. Walk right in. I am waiting to see the sun rise. But\nupon my word I believe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forgotten to rise. It is an awful climate,\nthis. Now if we were in Africa the world would be blazing with sunlight\nat this hour of the morning. Just see that mist rolling over those\ncabbages. It is enough to give you rheumatism to look at it. Beastly\nclimate\u00e2\u0080\u0094Beastly! Really I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know why anything but frogs ever stay\nin England\u00e2\u0080\u0094Well, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let me keep you. Run along and see the Doctor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go and look for him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen I opened the front door I could smell bacon frying, so I made my\nway to the kitchen. There I discovered a large kettle boiling away over\nthe fire and some bacon and eggs in a dish upon the hearth. It seemed\nto me that the bacon was getting all dried up with the heat. So I\npulled the dish a little further away from the fire and went on through\nthe house looking for the Doctor.\n\nI found him at last in the Study. I did not know then that it was\ncalled the Study. It was certainly a very interesting room, with\ntelescopes and microscopes and all sorts of other strange things which\nI did not understand about but wished I did. Hanging on the walls were\npictures of animals and fishes and strange plants and collections of\nbirds\u00e2\u0080\u0099 eggs and sea-shells in glass cases.\n\nThe Doctor was standing at the main table in his dressing-gown. At\nfirst I thought he was washing his face. He had a square glass box\nbefore him full of water. He was holding one ear under the water while\nhe covered the other with his left hand. As I came in he stood up.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood morning, Stubbins,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGoing to be a nice day, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nyou think? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve just been listening to the Wiff-Waff. But he is very\ndisappointing\u00e2\u0080\u0094very.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDidn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you find that he has any language at all?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009che has a language. But it is such a poor\nlanguage\u00e2\u0080\u0094only a few words, like \u00e2\u0080\u0098yes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and \u00e2\u0080\u0098no\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0098hot\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and \u00e2\u0080\u0098cold.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nall he can say. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very disappointing. You see he really belongs\nto two different families of fishes. I thought he was going to be\ntremendously helpful\u00e2\u0080\u0094Well, well!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat means he hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very much sense\u00e2\u0080\u0094if his\nlanguage is only two or three words?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I suppose it does. Possibly it is the kind of life he leads.\nYou see, they are very rare now, these Wiff-Waffs\u00e2\u0080\u0094very rare and very\nsolitary. They swim around in the deepest parts of the ocean entirely\nby themselves\u00e2\u0080\u0094always alone. So I presume they really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to talk\nmuch.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps some kind of a bigger shellfish would talk more,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter all, he is very small, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true. Oh I have no doubt that there\nare shellfish who are good talkers\u00e2\u0080\u0094not the least doubt. But the big\nshellfish\u00e2\u0080\u0094the biggest of them, are so hard to catch. They are only to\nbe found in the deep parts of the sea; and as they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t swim very\nmuch, but just crawl along the floor of the ocean most of the time,\nthey are very seldom taken in nets. I do wish I could find some way of\ngoing down to the bottom of the sea. I could learn a lot if I could\nonly do that. But we are forgetting all about breakfast\u00e2\u0080\u0094Have you had\nbreakfast yet, Stubbins?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI told the Doctor that I had forgotten all about it and he at once led\nthe way into the kitchen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, as he poured the hot water from the kettle into the\ntea-pot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif a man could only manage to get right down to the bottom\nof the sea, and live there a while, he would discover some wonderful\nthings\u00e2\u0080\u0094things that people have never dreamed of.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut men do go down, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cdivers and people like that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh yes, to be sure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDivers go down. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been down\nmyself in a diving-suit, for that matter. But my!\u00e2\u0080\u0094they only go where\nthe sea is shallow. Divers can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go down where it is really deep. What\nI would like to do is to go down to the great depths\u00e2\u0080\u0094where it is miles\ndeep\u00e2\u0080\u0094Well, well, I dare say I shall manage it some day. Let me give you\nanother cup of tea.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n_THE EIGHTH CHAPTER_\n\nARE YOU A GOOD NOTICER?\n\n\nJUST at that moment Polynesia came into the room and said something to\nthe Doctor in bird language. Of course I did not understand what it\nwas. But the Doctor at once put down his knife and fork and left the\nroom.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know it is an awful shame,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the parrot as soon as the Doctor\nhad closed the door. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDirectly he comes back home, all the animals\nover the whole countryside get to hear of it and every sick cat and\nmangy rabbit for miles around comes to see him and ask his advice. Now\nthere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a big fat hare outside at the back door with a squawking baby.\nCan she see the Doctor, please!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Thinks it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to have convulsions.\nStupid little thing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been eating Deadly Nightshade again, I suppose.\nThe animals are _so_ inconsiderate at times\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially the mothers.\nThey come round and call the Doctor away from his meals and wake him\nout of his bed at all hours of the night. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how he stands\nit\u00e2\u0080\u0094really I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Why, the poor man never gets any peace at all! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve\ntold him time and again to have special hours for the animals to come.\nBut he is so frightfully kind and considerate. He never refuses to see\nthem if there is anything really wrong with them. He says the urgent\ncases must be seen at once.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t some of the animals go and see the other doctors?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh Good Gracious!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the parrot, tossing her head scornfully.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, there aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any other animal-doctors\u00e2\u0080\u0094not real doctors. Oh of\ncourse there _are_ those vet persons, to be sure. But, bless you,\nthey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re no good. You see, they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand the animals\u00e2\u0080\u0099 language;\nso how can you expect them to be any use? Imagine yourself, or your\nfather, going to see a doctor who could not understand a word you\nsay\u00e2\u0080\u0094nor even tell you in your own language what you must do to get\nwell! Poof!\u00e2\u0080\u0094those vets! They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re that stupid, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve no idea!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Put the\nDoctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bacon down by the fire, will you?\u00e2\u0080\u0094to keep hot till he comes\nback.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you think I would ever be able to learn the language of the\nanimals?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked, laying the plate upon the hearth.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, it all depends,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polynesia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you clever at lessons?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered, feeling rather ashamed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve\nnever been to school. My father is too poor to send me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the parrot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t suppose you have really missed\nmuch\u00e2\u0080\u0094to judge from what _I_ have seen of school-boys. But listen: are\nyou a good noticer?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Do you notice things well? I mean, for instance,\nsupposing you saw two cock-starlings on an apple-tree, and you only\ntook one good look at them\u00e2\u0080\u0094would you be able to tell one from the other\nif you saw them again the next day?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never tried.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polynesia, brushing some crumbs off the corner\nof the table with her left foot\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat is what you call powers of\nobservation\u00e2\u0080\u0094noticing the small things about birds and animals: the way\nthey walk and move their heads and flip their wings; the way they sniff\nthe air and twitch their whiskers and wiggle their tails. You have to\nnotice all those little things if you want to learn animal language.\nFor you see, lots of the animals hardly talk at all with their tongues;\nthey use their breath or their tails or their feet instead. That is\nbecause many of them, in the olden days when lions and tigers were more\nplentiful, were afraid to make a noise for fear the savage creatures\nheard them. Birds, of course, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care; for they always had wings to\nfly away with. But that is the first thing to remember: being a good\nnoticer is terribly important in learning animal language.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt sounds pretty hard,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to be very patient,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polynesia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt takes a long\ntime to say even a few words properly. But if you come here often\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give you a few lessons myself. And once you get started you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nbe surprised how fast you get on. It would indeed be a good thing if\nyou could learn. Because then you could do some of the work for the\nDoctor\u00e2\u0080\u0094I mean the easier work, like bandaging and giving pills. Yes,\nyes, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good idea of mine. \u00e2\u0080\u0099Twould be a great thing if the poor\nman could get some help\u00e2\u0080\u0094and some rest. It is a scandal the way he\nworks. I see no reason why you shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to help him a great\ndeal\u00e2\u0080\u0094That is, if you are really interested in animals.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n[Illustration: \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Being a good noticer is terribly important\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d]\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love that!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you think the Doctor would let me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCertainly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polynesia\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cas soon as you have learned something\nabout doctoring. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll speak of it to him myself\u00e2\u0080\u0094Sh! I hear him coming.\nQuick\u00e2\u0080\u0094bring his bacon back on to the table.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n_THE NINTH CHAPTER_\n\nTHE GARDEN OF DREAMS\n\n\nWHEN breakfast was over the Doctor took me out to show me the garden.\nWell, if the house had been interesting, the garden was a hundred\ntimes more so. Of all the gardens I have ever seen that was the most\ndelightful, the most fascinating. At first you did not realize how big\nit was. You never seemed to come to the end of it. When at last you\nwere quite sure that you had seen it all, you would peer over a hedge,\nor turn a corner, or look up some steps, and there was a whole new part\nyou never expected to find.\n\nIt had everything\u00e2\u0080\u0094everything a garden can have, or ever has had. There\nwere wide, wide lawns with carved stone seats, green with moss. Over\nthe lawns hung weeping-willows, and their feathery bough-tips brushed\nthe velvet grass when they swung with the wind. The old flagged paths\nhad high, clipped, yew hedges either side of them, so that they looked\nlike the narrow streets of some old town; and through the hedges,\ndoorways had been made; and over the doorways were shapes like vases\nand peacocks and half-moons all trimmed out of the living trees. There\nwas a lovely marble fish-pond with golden carp and blue water-lilies in\nit and big green frogs. A high brick wall alongside the kitchen garden\nwas all covered with pink and yellow peaches ripening in the sun. There\nwas a wonderful great oak, hollow in the trunk, big enough for four men\nto hide inside. Many summer-houses there were, too\u00e2\u0080\u0094some of wood and\nsome of stone; and one of them was full of books to read. In a corner,\namong some rocks and ferns, was an outdoor fire-place, where the Doctor\nused to fry liver and bacon when he had a notion to take his meals in\nthe open air. There was a couch as well on which he used to sleep, it\nseems, on warm summer nights when the nightingales were singing at\ntheir best; it had wheels on it so it could be moved about under any\ntree they sang in. But the thing that fascinated me most of all was a\ntiny little tree-house, high up in the top branches of a great elm,\nwith a long rope ladder leading to it. The Doctor told me he used it\nfor looking at the moon and the stars through a telescope.\n\nIt was the kind of a garden where you could wander and explore for days\nand days\u00e2\u0080\u0094always coming upon something new, always glad to find the old\nspots over again. That first time that I saw the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s garden I was\nso charmed by it that I felt I would like to live in it\u00e2\u0080\u0094always and\nalways\u00e2\u0080\u0094and never go outside of it again. For it had everything within\nits walls to give happiness, to make living pleasant\u00e2\u0080\u0094to keep the heart\nat peace. It was the Garden of Dreams.\n\nOne peculiar thing I noticed immediately I came into it; and that was\nwhat a lot of birds there were about. Every tree seemed to have two or\nthree nests in it. And heaps of other wild creatures appeared to be\nmaking themselves at home there, too. Stoats and tortoises and dormice\nseemed to be quite common, and not in the least shy. Toads of different\ncolors and sizes hopped about the lawn as though it belonged to them.\nGreen lizards (which were very rare in Puddleby) sat up on the stones\nin the sunlight and blinked at us. Even snakes were to be seen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou need not be afraid of them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, noticing that I\nstarted somewhat when a large black snake wiggled across the path right\nin front of us. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese fellows are not poisonous. They do a great deal\nof good in keeping down many kinds of garden-pests. I play the flute to\nthem sometimes in the evening. They love it. Stand right up on their\ntails and carry on no end. Funny thing, their taste for music.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy do all these animals come and live here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI never saw a\ngarden with so many creatures in it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I suppose it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because they get the kind of food they like; and\nnobody worries or disturbs them. And then, of course, they know me. And\nif they or their children get sick I presume they find it handy to be\nliving in a doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s garden\u00e2\u0080\u0094Look! You see that sparrow on the sundial,\nswearing at the blackbird down below? Well, he has been coming here\nevery summer for years. He comes from London. The country sparrows\nround about here are always laughing at him. They say he chirps with\nsuch a Cockney accent. He is a most amusing bird\u00e2\u0080\u0094very brave but very\ncheeky. He loves nothing better than an argument, but he always ends it\nby getting rude. He is a real city bird. In London he lives around St.\nPaul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cathedral. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Cheapside,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 we call him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre all these birds from the country round here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMost of them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut a few rare ones visit me every\nyear who ordinarily never come near England at all. For instance,\nthat handsome little fellow hovering over the snapdragon there, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\na Ruby-throated Humming-bird. Comes from America. Strictly speaking,\nhe has no business in this climate at all. It is too cool. I make him\nsleep in the kitchen at night. Then every August, about the last week\nof the month, I have a Purple Bird-of-Paradise come all the way from\nBrazil to see me. She is a very great swell. Hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t arrived yet of\ncourse. And there are a few others, foreign birds from the tropics\nmostly, who drop in on me in the course of the summer months. But come,\nI must show you the zoo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n_THE TENTH CHAPTER_\n\nTHE PRIVATE ZOO\n\n\nI DID not think there could be anything left in that garden which we\nhad not seen. But the Doctor took me by the arm and started off down a\nlittle narrow path and after many windings and twistings and turnings\nwe found ourselves before a small door in a high stone wall. The Doctor\npushed it open.\n\nInside was still another garden. I had expected to find cages with\nanimals inside them. But there were none to be seen. Instead there were\nlittle stone houses here and there all over the garden; and each house\nhad a window and a door. As we walked in, many of these doors opened\nand animals came running out to us evidently expecting food.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the doors any locks on them?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked the Doctor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cevery door has a lock. But in my zoo the doors open\nfrom the inside, not from the out. The locks are only there so the\nanimals can go and shut themselves _in_ any time they want to get away\nfrom the annoyance of other animals or from people who might come here.\nEvery animal in this zoo stays here because he likes it, not because\nhe is made to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey all look very happy and clean,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWould you mind telling\nme the names of some of them?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCertainly. Well now: that funny-looking thing with plates on his back,\nnosing under the brick over there, is a South American armadillo. The\nlittle chap talking to him is a Canadian woodchuck. They both live in\nthose holes you see at the foot of the wall. The two little beasts\ndoing antics in the pond are a pair of Russian minks\u00e2\u0080\u0094and that reminds\nme: I must go and get them some herrings from the town before noon\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\nis early-closing to-day. That animal just stepping out of his house is\nan antelope, one of the smaller South African kinds. Now let us move to\nthe other side of those bushes there and I will show you some more.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre those deer over there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_Deer!_\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere do you mean?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOver there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, pointing\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cnibbling the grass border of the bed.\nThere are two of them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor with a smile. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t two animals:\nthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one animal with two heads\u00e2\u0080\u0094the only two-headed animal in the\nworld. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s called the \u00e2\u0080\u0098pushmi-pullyu.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I brought him from Africa. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nvery tame\u00e2\u0080\u0094acts as a kind of night-watchman for my zoo. He only sleeps\nwith one head at a time, you see\u00e2\u0080\u0094very handy\u00e2\u0080\u0094the other head stays awake\nall night.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you any lions or tigers?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked as we moved on.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be possible to keep them here\u00e2\u0080\u0094and\nI wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t keep them even if I could. If I had my way, Stubbins, there\nwouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be a single lion or tiger in captivity anywhere in the world.\nThey never take to it. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re never happy. They never settle down.\nThey are always thinking of the big countries they have left behind.\nYou can see it in their eyes, dreaming\u00e2\u0080\u0094dreaming always of the great\nopen spaces where they were born; dreaming of the deep, dark jungles\nwhere their mothers first taught them how to scent and track the deer.\nAnd what are they given in exchange for all this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the Doctor,\nstopping in his walk and growing all red and angry\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are they given\nin exchange for the glory of an African sunrise, for the twilight\nbreeze whispering through the palms, for the green shade of the matted,\ntangled vines, for the cool, big-starred nights of the desert, for the\npatter of the waterfall after a hard day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hunt? What, I ask you, are\nthey given in exchange for _these_? Why, a bare cage with iron bars; an\nugly piece of dead meat thrust in to them once a day; and a crowd of\nfools to come and stare at them with open mouths!\u00e2\u0080\u0094No, Stubbins. Lions\nand tigers, the Big Hunters, should never, never be seen in zoos.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Doctor seemed to have grown terribly serious\u00e2\u0080\u0094almost sad. But\nsuddenly his manner changed again and he took me by the arm with his\nsame old cheerful smile.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen the butterfly-houses yet\u00e2\u0080\u0094nor the aquariums. Come\nalong. I am very proud of my butterfly-houses.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOff we went again and came presently into a hedged enclosure. Here I\nsaw several big huts made of fine wire netting, like cages. Inside the\nnetting all sorts of beautiful flowers were growing in the sun, with\nbutterflies skimming over them. The Doctor pointed to the end of one of\nthe huts where little boxes with holes in them stood in a row.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThose are the hatching-boxes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere I put the different\nkinds of caterpillars. And as soon as they turn into butterflies and\nmoths they come out into these flower-gardens to feed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo butterflies have a language?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh I fancy they have,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cand the beetles too. But so\nfar I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t succeeded in learning much about insect languages. I have\nbeen too busy lately trying to master the shellfish-talk. I mean to\ntake it up though.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt that moment Polynesia joined us and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDoctor, there are two\nguinea-pigs at the back door. They say they have run away from the boy\nwho kept them because they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get the right stuff to eat. They want\nto know if you will take them in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShow them the way to the zoo. Give them\nthe house on the left, near the gate\u00e2\u0080\u0094the one the black fox had. Tell\nthem what the rules are and give them a square meal\u00e2\u0080\u0094Now, Stubbins, we\nwill go on to the aquariums. And first of all I must show you my big,\nglass, sea-water tank where I keep the shellfish.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n_THE ELEVENTH CHAPTER_\n\nMY SCHOOLMASTER, POLYNESIA\n\n\nWELL, there were not many days after that, you may be sure, when I did\nnot come to see my new friend. Indeed I was at his house practically\nall day and every day. So that one evening my mother asked me jokingly\nwhy I did not take my bed over there and live at the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house\naltogether.\n\nAfter a while I think I got to be quite useful to the Doctor, feeding\nhis pets for him; helping to make new houses and fences for the zoo;\nassisting with the sick animals that came; doing all manner of odd jobs\nabout the place. So that although I enjoyed it all very much (it was\nindeed like living in a new world) I really think the Doctor would have\nmissed me if I had not come so often.\n\nAnd all this time Polynesia came with me wherever I went, teaching me\nbird language and showing me how to understand the talking signs of the\nanimals. At first I thought I would never be able to learn at all\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\nseemed so difficult. But the old parrot was wonderfully patient with\nme\u00e2\u0080\u0094though I could see that occasionally she had hard work to keep her\ntemper.\n\nSoon I began to pick up the strange chatter of the birds and to\nunderstand the funny talking antics of the dogs. I used to practise\nlistening to the mice behind the wainscot after I went to bed, and\nwatching the cats on the roofs and pigeons in the market-square of\nPuddleby.\n\nAnd the days passed very quickly\u00e2\u0080\u0094as they always do when life is\npleasant; and the days turned into weeks, and weeks into months; and\nsoon the roses in the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s garden were losing their petals and\nyellow leaves lay upon the wide green lawn. For the summer was nearly\ngone.\n\nOne day Polynesia and I were talking in the library. This was a fine\nlong room with a grand mantlepiece and the walls were covered from the\nceiling to the floor with shelves full of books: books of stories,\nbooks on gardening, books about medicine, books of travel; these I\nloved\u00e2\u0080\u0094and especially the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great atlas with all its maps of the\ndifferent countries of the world.\n\nThis afternoon Polynesia was showing me the books about animals which\nJohn Dolittle had written himself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat a lot of books the Doctor has\u00e2\u0080\u0094all the way around\nthe room! Goodness! I wish I could read! It must be tremendously\ninteresting. Can you read, Polynesia?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly a little,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBe careful how you turn those pages\u00e2\u0080\u0094don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\ntear them. No, I really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get time enough for reading\u00e2\u0080\u0094much. That\nletter there is a _k_ and this is a _b_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat does this word under the picture mean?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, and started spelling it out.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cB-A-B-O-O-N\u00e2\u0080\u0094that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s _Monkey_. Reading isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t nearly as hard as it looks,\nonce you know the letters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPolynesia,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to ask you something very important.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is it, my boy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, smoothing down the feathers of her\nright wing. Polynesia often spoke to me in a very patronizing way. But\nI did not mind it from her. After all, she was nearly two hundred years\nold; and I was only ten.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cListen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy mother doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it is right that I come\nhere for so many meals. And I was going to ask you: supposing I did a\nwhole lot more work for the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0094why couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I come and live here\naltogether? You see, instead of being paid like a regular gardener or\nworkman, I would get my bed and meals in exchange for the work I did.\nWhat do you think?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou mean you want to be a proper assistant to the Doctor, is that it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes. I suppose that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what you call it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know you\nsaid yourself that you thought I could be very useful to him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094she thought a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cI really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see why not. But is this\nwhat you want to be when you grow up, a naturalist?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have made up my mind. I would sooner be a naturalist\nthan anything else in the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHumph!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s go and speak to the Doctor about it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polynesia.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the next room\u00e2\u0080\u0094in the study. Open the door very gently\u00e2\u0080\u0094he may\nbe working and not want to be disturbed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI opened the door quietly and peeped in. The first thing I saw was an\nenormous black retriever dog sitting in the middle of the hearth-rug\nwith his ears cocked up, listening to the Doctor who was reading aloud\nto him from a letter.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat _is_ the Doctor doing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked Polynesia in a whisper.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, the dog has had a letter from his mistress and he has brought it\nto the Doctor to read for him. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all. He belongs to a funny little\ngirl called Minnie Dooley, who lives on the other side of the town. She\nhas pigtails down her back. She and her brother have gone away to the\nseaside for the Summer; and the old retriever is heart-broken while the\nchildren are gone. So they write letters to him\u00e2\u0080\u0094in English of course.\nAnd as the old dog doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand them, he brings them here,\nand the Doctor turns them into dog language for him. I think Minnie\nmust have written that she is coming back\u00e2\u0080\u0094to judge from the dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nexcitement. Just look at him carrying on!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIndeed the retriever seemed to be suddenly overcome with joy. As the\nDoctor finished the letter the old dog started barking at the top of\nhis voice, wagging his tail wildly and jumping about the study. He\ntook the letter in his mouth and ran out of the room snorting hard and\nmumbling to himself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going down to meet the coach,\u00e2\u0080\u009d whispered Polynesia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndevotion to those children is more than I can understand. You should\nsee Minnie! She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the most conceited little minx that ever walked. She\nsquints too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n_THE TWELFTH CHAPTER_\n\nMY GREAT IDEA\n\n\nPRESENTLY the Doctor looked up and saw us at the door.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh\u00e2\u0080\u0094come in, Stubbins,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdid you wish to speak to me? Come in\nand take a chair.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to be a naturalist\u00e2\u0080\u0094like you\u00e2\u0080\u0094when I grow up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh you do, do you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d murmured the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHumph!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Well!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Dear me!\u00e2\u0080\u0094You\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Well, well! Have you er\u00e2\u0080\u0094have you spoken to your mother and\nfather about it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, not yet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want you to speak to them for me. You would\ndo it better. I want to be your helper\u00e2\u0080\u0094your assistant, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have\nme. Last night my mother was saying that she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t consider it right\nfor me to come here so often for meals. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been thinking about it\na good deal since. Couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we make some arrangement\u00e2\u0080\u0094couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I work\nfor my meals and sleep here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut my dear Stubbins,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, laughing, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are quite\nwelcome to come here for three meals a day all the year round. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m only\ntoo glad to have you. Besides, you do do a lot of work, as it is. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve\noften felt that I ought to pay you for what you do\u00e2\u0080\u0094But what arrangement\nwas it that you thought of?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I thought,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat perhaps you would come and see my\nmother and father and tell them that if they let me live here with you\nand work hard, that you will teach me to read and write. You see my\nmother is awfully anxious to have me learn reading and writing. And\nbesides, I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be a proper naturalist without, could I?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know so much about that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is nice, I\nadmit, to be able to read and write. But naturalists are not all alike,\nyou know. For example: this young fellow Charles Darwin that people are\ntalking about so much now\u00e2\u0080\u0094he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a Cambridge graduate\u00e2\u0080\u0094reads and writes\nvery well. And then Cuvier\u00e2\u0080\u0094he used to be a tutor. But listen, the\ngreatest naturalist of them all doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even know how to write his own\nname nor to read the _A B C_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho is he?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is a mysterious person,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009ca very mysterious person.\nHis name is Long Arrow, the son of Golden Arrow. He is a Red Indian.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you ever seen him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never seen him. No white man has ever met\nhim. I fancy Mr. Darwin doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even know that he exists. He lives\nalmost entirely with the animals and with the different tribes of\nIndians\u00e2\u0080\u0094usually somewhere among the mountains of Peru. Never stays long\nin one place. Goes from tribe to tribe, like a sort of Indian tramp.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do you know so much about him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cif you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never even seen\nhim?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Purple Bird-of-Paradise,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cshe told me all about\nhim. She says he is a perfectly marvelous naturalist. I got her to take\na message to him for me last time she was here. I am expecting her back\nany day now. I can hardly wait to see what answer she has brought from\nhim. It is already almost the last week of August. I do hope nothing\nhas happened to her on the way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut why do the animals and birds come to you when they are sick?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\nsaid\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they go to him, if he is so very wonderful?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt seems that my methods are more up to date,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut\nfrom what the Purple Bird-of-Paradise tells me, Long Arrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knowledge\nof natural history must be positively tremendous. His specialty is\nbotany\u00e2\u0080\u0094plants and all that sort of thing. But he knows a lot about\nbirds and animals too. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very good on bees and beetles\u00e2\u0080\u0094But now\ntell me, Stubbins, are you quite sure that you really want to be a\nnaturalist?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy mind is made up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell you know, it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a very good profession for making money. Not\nat all, it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Most of the good naturalists don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make any money\nwhatever. All they do is _spend_ money, buying butterfly-nets and\ncases for birds\u00e2\u0080\u0099 eggs and things. It is only now, after I have been a\nnaturalist for many years, that I am beginning to make a little money\nfrom the books I write.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care about money,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to be a naturalist.\nWon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you please come and have dinner with my mother and father next\nThursday\u00e2\u0080\u0094I told them I was going to ask you\u00e2\u0080\u0094and then you can talk to\nthem about it. You see, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another thing: if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m living with you,\nand sort of belong to your house and business, I shall be able to come\nwith you next time you go on a voyage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, smiling. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo you want to come on a voyage with\nme, do you?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Ah hah!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to go on all your voyages with you. It would be much easier\nfor you if you had someone to carry the butterfly-nets and note-books.\nWouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFor a long time the Doctor sat thinking, drumming on the desk with his\nfingers, while I waited, terribly impatiently, to see what he was going\nto say.\n\nAt last he shrugged his shoulders and stood up.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Stubbins,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come and talk it over with you and\nyour parents next Thursday. And\u00e2\u0080\u0094well, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see. Give your\nmother and father my compliments and thank them for their invitation,\nwill you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen I tore home like the wind to tell my mother that the Doctor had\npromised to come.\n\n\n\n\n_THE THIRTEENTH CHAPTER_\n\nA TRAVELER ARRIVES\n\n\nTHE next day I was sitting on the wall of the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s garden after\ntea, talking to Dab-Dab. I had now learned so much from Polynesia that\nI could talk to most birds and some animals without a great deal of\ndifficulty. I found Dab-Dab a very nice, old, motherly bird\u00e2\u0080\u0094though not\nnearly so clever and interesting as Polynesia. She had been housekeeper\nfor the Doctor many years now.\n\nWell, as I was saying, the old duck and I were sitting on the flat top\nof the garden-wall that evening, looking down into the Oxenthorpe Road\nbelow. We were watching some sheep being driven to market in Puddleby;\nand Dab-Dab had just been telling me about the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s adventures in\nAfrica. For she had gone on a voyage with him to that country long ago.\n\nSuddenly I heard a curious distant noise down the road, towards the\ntown. It sounded like a lot of people cheering. I stood up on the wall\nto see if I could make out what was coming. Presently there appeared\nround a bend a great crowd of school-children following a very ragged,\ncurious-looking woman.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat in the world can it be?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Dab-Dab.\n\nThe children were all laughing and shouting. And certainly the woman\nthey were following was most extraordinary. She had very long arms and\nthe most stooping shoulders I have ever seen. She wore a straw hat on\nthe side of her head with poppies on it; and her skirt was so long for\nher it dragged on the ground like a ball-gown\u00e2\u0080\u0099s train. I could not see\nanything of her face because of the wide hat pulled over her eyes. But\nas she got nearer to us and the laughing of the children grew louder,\nI noticed that her hands were very dark in color, and hairy, like a\nwitch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\n\nThen all of a sudden Dab-Dab at my side startled me by crying out in a\nloud voice,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chee-Chee!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Chee-Chee come back at last! How dare those\nchildren tease him! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give the little imps something to laugh at!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd she flew right off the wall down into the road and made straight\nfor the children, squawking away in a most terrifying fashion and\npecking at their feet and legs. The children made off down the street\nback to the town as hard as they could run.\n\nThe strange-looking figure in the straw hat stood gazing after them a\nmoment and then came wearily up to the gate. It didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother to undo\nthe latch but just climbed right over the gate as though it were\nsomething in the way. And then I noticed that it took hold of the bars\nwith its feet, so that it really had four hands to climb with. But it\nwas only when I at last got a glimpse of the face under the hat that I\ncould be really sure it was a monkey.\n\n[Illustration: A traveler arrives]\n\nChee-Chee\u00e2\u0080\u0094for it was he\u00e2\u0080\u0094frowned at me suspiciously from the top of the\ngate, as though he thought I was going to laugh at him like the other\nboys and girls. Then he dropped into the garden on the inside and\nimmediately started taking off his clothes. He tore the straw hat in\ntwo and threw it down into the road. Then he took off his bodice and\nskirt, jumped on them savagely and began kicking them round the front\ngarden.\n\nPresently I heard a screech from the house, and out flew Polynesia,\nfollowed by the Doctor and Jip.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cChee-Chee!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Chee-Chee!\u00e2\u0080\u009d shouted the parrot. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come at last! I\nalways told the Doctor you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d find a way. How ever did you do it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey all gathered round him shaking him by his four hands, laughing and\nasking him a million questions at once. Then they all started back for\nthe house.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRun up to my bedroom, Stubbins,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, turning to me.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find a bag of peanuts in the small left-hand drawer of the\nbureau. I have always kept them there in case he might come back\nunexpectedly some day. And wait a minute\u00e2\u0080\u0094see if Dab-Dab has any bananas\nin the pantry. Chee-Chee hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t had a banana, he tells me, in two\nmonths.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen I came down again to the kitchen I found everybody listening\nattentively to the monkey who was telling the story of his journey from\nAfrica.\n\n\n\n\n_THE FOURTEENTH CHAPTER_\n\nCHEE-CHEE\u00e2\u0080\u0099S VOYAGE\n\n\nIt seems that after Polynesia had left, Chee-Chee had grown more\nhomesick than ever for the Doctor and the little house in Puddleby. At\nlast he had made up his mind that by hook or crook he would follow her.\nAnd one day, going down to the seashore, he saw a lot of people, black\nand white, getting on to a ship that was coming to England. He tried to\nget on too. But they turned him back and drove him away. And presently\nhe noticed a whole big family of funny people passing on to the ship.\nAnd one of the children in this family reminded Chee-Chee of a cousin\nof his with whom he had once been in love. So he said to himself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\ngirl looks just as much like a monkey as I look like a girl. If I\ncould only get some clothes to wear I might easily slip on to the ship\namongst these families, and people would take me for a girl. Good idea!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo he went off to a town that was quite close, and hopping in through\nan open window he found a skirt and bodice lying on a chair. They\nbelonged to a fashionable black lady who was taking a bath. Chee-Chee\nput them on. Next he went back to the seashore, mingled with the crowd\nthere and at last sneaked safely on to the big ship. Then he thought he\nhad better hide, for fear people might look at him too closely. And he\nstayed hidden all the time the ship was sailing to England\u00e2\u0080\u0094only coming\nout at night, when everybody was asleep, to find food.\n\nWhen he reached England and tried to get off the ship, the sailors saw\nat last that he was only a monkey dressed up in girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clothes; and\nthey wanted to keep him for a pet. But he managed to give them the\nslip; and once he was on shore, he dived into the crowd and got away.\nBut he was still a long distance from Puddleby and had to come right\nacross the whole breadth of England.\n\nHe had a terrible time of it. Whenever he passed through a town all the\nchildren ran after him in a crowd, laughing; and often silly people\ncaught hold of him and tried to stop him, so that he had to run up\nlamp-posts and climb to chimney-pots to escape from them. At night\nhe used to sleep in ditches or barns or anywhere he could hide; and\nhe lived on the berries he picked from the hedges and the cob-nuts\nthat grew in the copses. At length, after many adventures and narrow\nsqueaks, he saw the tower of Puddleby Church and he knew that at last\nhe was near his old home.\n\nWhen Chee-Chee had finished his story he ate six bananas without\nstopping and drank a whole bowlful of milk.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I born with wings, like Polynesia, so I\ncould fly here? You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve no idea how I grew to hate that hat and skirt.\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never been so uncomfortable in my life. All the way from Bristol\nhere, if the wretched hat wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t falling off my head or catching in the\ntrees, those beastly skirts were tripping me up and getting wound round\neverything. What on earth do women wear those things for? Goodness, I\nwas glad to see old Puddleby this morning when I climbed over the hill\nby Bellaby\u00e2\u0080\u0099s farm!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour bed on top of the plate-rack in the scullery is all ready for\nyou,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe never had it disturbed in case you might\ncome back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dab-Dab, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand you can have the old smoking-jacket of the\nDoctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s which you used to use as a blanket, in case it is cold in the\nnight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Chee-Chee. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good to be back in the old house again.\nEverything\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just the same as when I left\u00e2\u0080\u0094except the clean roller-towel\non the back of the door there\u00e2\u0080\u0094that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new\u00e2\u0080\u0094Well, I think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go to bed\nnow. I need sleep.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen we all went out of the kitchen into the scullery and watched\nChee-Chee climb the plate-rack like a sailor going up a mast. On the\ntop, he curled himself up, pulled the old smoking-jacket over him, and\nin a minute he was snoring peacefully.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood old Chee-Chee!\u00e2\u0080\u009d whispered the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes\u00e2\u0080\u0094good old Chee-Chee!\u00e2\u0080\u009d echoed Dab-Dab and Polynesia.\n\nThen we all tip-toed out of the scullery and closed the door very\ngently behind us.\n\n\n\n\n_THE FIFTEENTH CHAPTER_\n\nI BECOME A DOCTOR\u00e2\u0080\u0099S ASSISTANT\n\n\nWHEN Thursday evening came there was great excitement at our house.\nMy mother had asked me what were the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favorite dishes, and I\nhad told her: spare ribs, sliced beet-root, fried bread, shrimps and\ntreacle-tart. To-night she had them all on the table waiting for him;\nand she was now fussing round the house to see if everything was tidy\nand in readiness for his coming.\n\nAt last we heard a knock upon the door, and of course it was I who got\nthere first to let him in.\n\nThe Doctor had brought his own flute with him this time. And after\nsupper was over (which he enjoyed very much) the table was cleared away\nand the washing-up left in the kitchen-sink till the next day. Then the\nDoctor and my father started playing duets.\n\nThey got so interested in this that I began to be afraid that they\nwould never come to talking over my business. But at last the Doctor\nsaid,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour son tells me that he is anxious to become a naturalist.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd then began a long talk which lasted far into the night. At first\nboth my mother and father were rather against the idea\u00e2\u0080\u0094as they had been\nfrom the beginning. They said it was only a boyish whim, and that I\nwould get tired of it very soon. But after the matter had been talked\nover from every side, the Doctor turned to my father and said,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell now, supposing, Mr. Stubbins, that your son came to me for two\nyears\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, until he is twelve years old. During those two years he\nwill have time to see if he is going to grow tired of it or not. Also\nduring that time, I will promise to teach him reading and writing and\nperhaps a little arithmetic as well. What do you say to that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said my father, shaking his head. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are very kind\nand it is a handsome offer you make, Doctor. But I feel that Tommy\nought to be learning some trade by which he can earn his living later\non.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen my mother spoke up. Although she was nearly in tears at the\nprospect of my leaving her house while I was still so young, she\npointed out to my father that this was a grand chance for me to get\nlearning.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow Jacob,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou know that many lads in the town have been\nto the Grammar School till they were fourteen or fifteen years old.\nTommy can easily spare these two years for his education; and if he\nlearns no more than to read and write, the time will not be lost.\nThough goodness knows,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added, getting out her handkerchief to cry,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe house will seem terribly empty when he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will take care that he comes to see you, Mrs. Stubbins,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nDoctor\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cevery day, if you like. After all, he will not be very far\naway.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWell, at length my father gave in; and it was agreed that I was to live\nwith the Doctor and work for him for two years in exchange for learning\nto read and write and for my board and lodging.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course,\u00e2\u0080\u009d added the Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhile I have money I will keep Tommy in\nclothes as well. But money is a very irregular thing with me; sometimes\nI have some, and then sometimes I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are very good, Doctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said my mother, drying her tears. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\nseems to me that Tommy is a very fortunate boy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd then, thoughtless, selfish little imp that I was, I leaned over and\nwhispered in the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ear,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPlease don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forget to say something about the voyages.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, by the way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said John Dolittle, \u00e2\u0080\u009cof course occasionally my work\nrequires me to travel. You will have no objection, I take it, to your\nson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming with me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMy poor mother looked up sharply, more unhappy and anxious than ever\nat this new turn; while I stood behind the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chair, my heart\nthumping with excitement, waiting for my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s answer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said slowly after a while. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we agree to the other\narrangement I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve the right to make any objection to\nthat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWell, there surely was never a happier boy in the world than I was at\nthat moment. My head was in the clouds. I trod on air. I could scarcely\nkeep from dancing round the parlor. At last the dream of my life was to\ncome true! At last I was to be given a chance to seek my fortune, to\nhave adventures! For I knew perfectly well that it was now almost time\nfor the Doctor to start upon another voyage. Polynesia had told me that\nhe hardly ever stayed at home for more than six months at a stretch.\nTherefore he would be surely going again within a fortnight. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0094I,\nTommy Stubbins, would go with him! Just to think of it!\u00e2\u0080\u0094to cross the\nSea, to walk on foreign shores, to roam the World!\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nPART TWO\n\n_THE FIRST CHAPTER_\n\nTHE CREW OF \u00e2\u0080\u009cTHE CURLEW\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nFROM that time on of course my position in the town was very different.\nI was no longer a poor cobbler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son. I carried my nose in the air as\nI went down the High Street with Jip in his gold collar at my side;\nand snobbish little boys who had despised me before because I was not\nrich enough to go to school now pointed me out to their friends and\nwhispered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see him? He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assistant\u00e2\u0080\u0094and only ten years\nold!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut their eyes would have opened still wider with wonder if they had\nbut known that I and the dog that was with me could talk to one another.\n\nTwo days after the Doctor had been to our house to dinner he told me\nvery sadly that he was afraid that he would have to give up trying to\nlearn the language of the shellfish\u00e2\u0080\u0094at all events for the present.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m very discouraged, Stubbins, very. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve tried the mussels and\nthe clams, the oysters and the whelks, cockles and scallops; seven\ndifferent kinds of crabs and all the lobster family. I think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nleave it for the present and go at it again later on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat will you turn to now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I rather thought of going on a voyage, Stubbins. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite\na time now since I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been away. And there is a great deal of work\nwaiting for me abroad.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen shall we start?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, first I shall have to wait till the Purple Bird-of-Paradise gets\nhere. I must see if she has any message for me from Long Arrow. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nlate. She should have been here ten days ago. I hope to goodness she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nall right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we better be seeing about getting a boat?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\nis sure to be here in a day or so; and there will be lots of things to\ndo to get ready in the mean time, won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, indeed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSuppose we go down and see your friend\nJoe, the mussel-man. He will know about boats.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to come too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jip.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right, come along,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, and off we went.\n\nJoe said yes, he had a boat\u00e2\u0080\u0094one he had just bought\u00e2\u0080\u0094but it needed three\npeople to sail her. We told him we would like to see it anyway.\n\nSo the mussel-man took us off a little way down the river and showed\nus the neatest, prettiest, little vessel that ever was built. She was\ncalled _The Curlew_. Joe said he would sell her to us cheap. But the\ntrouble was that the boat needed three people, while we were only two.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course I shall be taking Chee-Chee,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut although\nhe is very quick and clever, he is not as strong as a man. We really\nought to have another person to sail a boat as big as that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know of a good sailor, Doctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Joe\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009ca first-class seaman who\nwould be glad of the job.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, thank you, Joe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Doctor Dolittle. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want any seamen.\nI couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford to hire them. And then they hamper me so, seamen do,\nwhen I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m at sea. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re always wanting to do things the proper way;\nand I like to do them _my_ way\u00e2\u0080\u0094Now let me see: who could we take with\nus?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Matthew Mugg, the cat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s-meat-man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, he wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do. Matthew\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very nice fellow, but he talks too\nmuch\u00e2\u0080\u0094mostly about his rheumatism. You have to be frightfully particular\nwhom you take with you on long voyages.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow about Luke the Hermit?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good idea\u00e2\u0080\u0094splendid\u00e2\u0080\u0094if he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s go and ask him right\naway.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n_THE SECOND CHAPTER_\n\nLUKE THE HERMIT\n\n\nTHE Hermit was an old friend of ours, as I have already told you. He\nwas a very peculiar person. Far out on the marshes he lived in a little\nbit of a shack\u00e2\u0080\u0094all alone except for his brindle bulldog. No one knew\nwhere he came from\u00e2\u0080\u0094not even his name. Just \u00e2\u0080\u009cLuke the Hermit\u00e2\u0080\u009d folks\ncalled him. He never came into the town; never seemed to want to see\nor talk to people. His dog, Bob, drove them away if they came near his\nhut. When you asked anyone in Puddleby who he was or why he lived out\nin that lonely place by himself, the only answer you got was, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Luke\nthe Hermit? Well, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some mystery about him. Nobody knows what it\nis. But there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a mystery. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go near him. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll set the dog on you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNevertheless there were two people who often went out to that little\nshack on the fens: the Doctor and myself. And Bob, the bulldog, never\nbarked when he heard us coming. For we liked Luke; and Luke liked us.\n\nThis afternoon, crossing the marshes we faced a cold wind blowing from\nthe East. As we approached the hut Jip put up his ears and said,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s funny!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s funny?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the Doctor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat Bob hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come out to meet us. He should have heard us long\nago\u00e2\u0080\u0094or smelt us. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that queer noise?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSounds to me like a gate creaking,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nLuke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s door, only we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see the door from here; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on the far side\nof the shack.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope Bob isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sick,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jip; and he let out a bark to see if that\nwould call him. But the only answer he got was the wailing of the wind\nacross the wide, salt fen.\n\nWe hurried forward, all three of us thinking hard.\n\nWhen we reached the front of the shack we found the door open, swinging\nand creaking dismally in the wind. We looked inside. There was no one\nthere.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIsn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Luke at home then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s out for a walk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is _always_ at home,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor frowning in a peculiar sort\nof way. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd even if he were out for a walk he wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t leave his\ndoor banging in the wind behind him. There is something queer about\nthis\u00e2\u0080\u0094What are you doing in there, Jip?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing much\u00e2\u0080\u0094nothing worth speaking of,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jip examining the floor\nof the hut extremely carefully.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome here, Jip,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor in a stern voice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are hiding\nsomething from me. You see signs and you know something\u00e2\u0080\u0094or you guess\nit. What has happened? Tell me. Where is the Hermit?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jip looking very guilty and uncomfortable. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know where he is.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, you know something. I can tell it from the look in your eye.\nWhat is it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Jip didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t answer.\n\nFor ten minutes the Doctor kept questioning him. But not a word would\nthe dog say.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor at last, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is no use our standing around here\nin the cold. The Hermit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all. We might as well go home to\nluncheon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs we buttoned up our coats and started back across the marsh, Jip ran\nahead pretending he was looking for water-rats.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe knows something all right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d whispered the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I think he\nknows what has happened too. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s funny, his not wanting to tell me. He\nhas never done that before\u00e2\u0080\u0094not in eleven years. He has always told me\neverything\u00e2\u0080\u0094Strange\u00e2\u0080\u0094very strange!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you mean you think he knows all about the Hermit, the big mystery\nabout him which folks hint at and all that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wonder if he did,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Doctor answered slowly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI noticed\nsomething in his expression the moment we found that door open and the\nhut empty. And the way he sniffed the floor too\u00e2\u0080\u0094it told him something,\nthat floor did. He saw signs we couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see\u00e2\u0080\u0094I wonder why he won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell\nme. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try him again. Here, Jip! Jip!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Where is the dog? I thought he\nwent on in front.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo did I,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was there a moment ago. I saw him as large as\nlife. Jip\u00e2\u0080\u0094Jip\u00e2\u0080\u0094Jip\u00e2\u0080\u0094JIP!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut he was gone. We called and called. We even walked back to the hut.\nBut Jip had disappeared.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmost likely he has just run home ahead of us. He\noften does that, you know. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find him there when we get back to the\nhouse.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut the Doctor just closed his coat-collar tighter against the wind and\nstrode on muttering, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOdd\u00e2\u0080\u0094very odd!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n_THE THIRD CHAPTER_\n\nJIP AND THE SECRET\n\n\nWHEN we reached the house the first question the Doctor asked of\nDab-Dab in the hall was,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs Jip home yet?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dab-Dab, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me know the moment he comes in, will you, please?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nDoctor, hanging up his hat.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCertainly I will,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dab-Dab. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be long over washing your\nhands; the lunch is on the table.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJust as we were sitting down to luncheon in the kitchen we heard a\ngreat racket at the front door. I ran and opened it. In bounded Jip.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoctor!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccome into the library quick. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got something\nto tell you\u00e2\u0080\u0094No, Dab-Dab, the luncheon must wait. Please hurry, Doctor.\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a moment to be lost. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let any of the animals come\u00e2\u0080\u0094just\nyou and Tommy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, when we were inside the library and the door was\nclosed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cturn the key in the lock and make sure there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no one\nlistening under the windows.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNobody can hear you here. Now what\nis it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Doctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jip (he was badly out of breath from running), \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nknow all about the Hermit\u00e2\u0080\u0094I have known for years. But I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell\nyou.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the Doctor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d promised not to tell any one. It was Bob, his dog, that\ntold me. And I swore to him that I would keep the secret.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, and are you going to tell me now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jip, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to save him. I followed Bob\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scent just\nnow when I left you out there on the marshes. And I found him. And I\nsaid to him, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Is it all right,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098for me to tell the Doctor now?\nMaybe he can do something.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And Bob says to me, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 says he, \u00e2\u0080\u0098it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nall right because\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, for Heaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake, go on, go on!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTell us what\nthe mystery is\u00e2\u0080\u0094not what you said to Bob and what Bob said to you. What\nhas happened? Where _is_ the Hermit?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in Puddleby Jail,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jip. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in prison.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn prison!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat for?\u00e2\u0080\u0094What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s he done?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJip went over to the door and smelt at the bottom of it to see if any\none were listening outside. Then he came back to the Doctor on tiptoe\nand whispered,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_He killed a man!_\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLord preserve us!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Doctor, sitting down heavily in a chair\nand mopping his forehead with a handkerchief. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen did he do it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFifteen years ago\u00e2\u0080\u0094in a Mexican gold-mine. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why he has been a\nhermit ever since. He shaved off his beard and kept away from people\nout there on the marshes so he wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be recognized. But last week,\nit seems these new-fangled policemen came to Town; and they heard there\nwas a strange man who kept to himself all alone in a shack on the\nfen. And they got suspicious. For a long time people had been hunting\nall over the world for the man that did that killing in the Mexican\ngold-mine fifteen years ago. So these policemen went out to the shack,\nand they recognized Luke by a mole on his arm. And they took him to\nprison.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, well!\u00e2\u0080\u009d murmured the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho would have thought it?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Luke,\nthe philosopher!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Killed a man!\u00e2\u0080\u0094I can hardly believe it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true enough\u00e2\u0080\u0094unfortunately,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jip. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLuke did it. But it\nwasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t his fault. Bob says so. And he was there and saw it all. He was\nscarcely more than a puppy at the time. Bob says Luke couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help it.\nHe _had_ to do it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere is Bob now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the Doctor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDown at the prison. I wanted him to come with me here to see you; but\nhe won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t leave the prison while Luke is there. He just sits outside the\ndoor of the prison-cell and won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t move. He doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even eat the food\nthey give him. Won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you please come down there, Doctor, and see if\nthere is anything you can do? The trial is to be this afternoon at two\no\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock. What time is it now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ten minutes past one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBob says he thinks they are going to kill Luke for a punishment if\nthey can prove that he did it\u00e2\u0080\u0094or certainly keep him in prison for the\nrest of his life. Won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you please come? Perhaps if you spoke to the\njudge and told him what a good man Luke really is they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d let him off.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor getting up and moving to go.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m very much afraid that I shan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be of any real help.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He turned\nat the door and hesitated thoughtfully.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd yet\u00e2\u0080\u0094I wonder\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen he opened the door and passed out with Jip and me close at his\nheels.\n\n\n\n\n_THE FOURTH CHAPTER_\n\nBOB\n\n\nDAB-DAB was terribly upset when she found we were going away again\nwithout luncheon; and she made us take some cold pork-pies in our\npockets to eat on the way.\n\nWhen we got to Puddleby Court-house (it was next door to the prison),\nwe found a great crowd gathered around the building.\n\nThis was the week of the Assizes\u00e2\u0080\u0094a business which happened every three\nmonths, when many pick-pockets and other bad characters were tried by\na very grand judge who came all the way from London. And anybody in\nPuddleby who had nothing special to do used to come to the Court-house\nto hear the trials.\n\nBut to-day it was different. The crowd was not made up of just a few\nidle people. It was enormous. The news had run through the countryside\nthat Luke the Hermit was to be tried for killing a man and that the\ngreat mystery which had hung over him so long was to be cleared up\nat last. The butcher and the baker had closed their shops and taken\na holiday. All the farmers from round-about, and all the townsfolk,\nwere there with their Sunday clothes on, trying to get seats in the\nCourt-house or gossipping outside in low whispers. The High Street was\nso crowded you could hardly move along it. I had never seen the quiet\nold town in such a state of excitement before. For Puddleby had not had\nsuch an Assizes since 1799, when Ferdinand Phipps, the Rector\u00e2\u0080\u0099s oldest\nson, had robbed the bank.\n\nIf I hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t had the Doctor with me I am sure I would never have been\nable to make my way through the mob packed around the Court-house door.\nBut I just followed behind him, hanging on to his coat-tails; and at\nlast we got safely into the jail.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to see Luke,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor to a very grand person in a blue\ncoat with brass buttons standing at the door.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAsk at the Superintendent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the man. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThird door on the\nleft down the corridor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho is that person you spoke to, Doctor?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked as we went along the\npassage.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is a policeman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what are policemen?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPolicemen? They are to keep people in order. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve just been\ninvented\u00e2\u0080\u0094by Sir Robert Peel. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why they are also called \u00e2\u0080\u0098peelers\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsometimes. It is a wonderful age we live in. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re always thinking of\nsomething new\u00e2\u0080\u0094This will be the Superintendent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office, I suppose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n[Illustration: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOn the bed sat the Hermit\u00e2\u0080\u009d]\n\nFrom there another policeman was sent with us to show us the way.\n\nOutside the door of Luke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cell we found Bob, the bulldog, who wagged\nhis tail sadly when he saw us. The man who was guiding us took a large\nbunch of keys from his pocket and opened the door.\n\nI had never been inside a real prison-cell before; and I felt quite\na thrill when the policeman went out and locked the door after him,\nleaving us shut in the dimly-lighted, little, stone room. Before he\nwent, he said that as soon as we had done talking with our friend we\nshould knock upon the door and he would come and let us out.\n\nAt first I could hardly see anything, it was so dim inside. But after\na little I made out a low bed against the wall, under a small barred\nwindow. On the bed, staring down at the floor between his feet, sat the\nHermit, his head resting in his hands.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Luke,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor in a kindly voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give you\nmuch light in here, do they?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nVery slowly the Hermit looked up from the floor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHulloa, John Dolittle. What brings you here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come to see you. I would have been here sooner, only I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nhear about all this till a few minutes ago. I went to your hut to ask\nyou if you would join me on a voyage; and when I found it empty I had\nno idea where you could be. I am dreadfully sorry to hear about your\nbad luck. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come to see if there is anything I can do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLuke shook his head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t imagine there is anything can be done. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve caught me\nat last. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the end of it, I suppose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe got up stiffly and started walking up and down the little room.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn a way I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s over,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI never got any peace, always\nthinking they were after me\u00e2\u0080\u0094afraid to speak to anyone. They were bound\nto get me in the end\u00e2\u0080\u0094Yes, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s over.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen the Doctor talked to Luke for more than half an hour, trying to\ncheer him up; while I sat around wondering what I ought to say and\nwishing I could do something.\n\nAt last the Doctor said he wanted to see Bob; and we knocked upon the\ndoor and were let out by the policeman.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBob,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor to the big bulldog in the passage, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccome out\nwith me into the porch. I want to ask you something.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow is he, Doctor?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Bob as we walked down the corridor into the\nCourt-house porch.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Luke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all right. Very miserable of course, but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all right.\nNow tell me, Bob: you saw this business happen, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you? You were\nthere when the man was killed, eh?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was, Doctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bob, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I tell you\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Doctor interrupted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all I want to know for the\npresent. There isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t time to tell me more now. The trial is just going\nto begin. There are the judge and the lawyers coming up the steps. Now\nlisten, Bob: I want you to stay with me when I go into the court-room.\nAnd whatever I tell you to do, do it. Do you understand? Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make\nany scenes. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bite anybody, no matter what they may say about\nLuke. Just behave perfectly quietly and answer any question I may ask\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0094truthfully. Do you understand?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well. But do you think you will be able to get him off, Doctor?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nasked Bob. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good man, Doctor. He really is. There never was a\nbetter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see, Bob. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a new thing I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to try. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not\nsure the judge will allow it. But\u00e2\u0080\u0094well, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to go\ninto the court-room now. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forget what I told you. Remember: for\nHeaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t start biting any one or you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get us all put out\nand spoil everything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n_THE FIFTH CHAPTER_\n\nMENDOZA\n\n\nINSIDE the court-room everything was very solemn and wonderful. It was\na high, big room. Raised above the floor, against the wall was the\nJudge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s desk; and here the judge was already sitting\u00e2\u0080\u0094an old, handsome\nman in a marvelous big wig of gray hair and a gown of black. Below him\nwas another wide, long desk at which lawyers in white wigs sat. The\nwhole thing reminded me of a mixture between a church and a school.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThose twelve men at the side,\u00e2\u0080\u009d whispered the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cthose in pews\nlike a choir, they are what is called the jury. It is they who decide\nwhether Luke is guilty\u00e2\u0080\u0094whether he did it or not.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd look!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Luke himself in a sort of pulpit-thing\nwith policemen each side of him. And there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another pulpit, the same\nkind, the other side of the room, see\u00e2\u0080\u0094only that one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s empty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat one is called the witness-box,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going\ndown to speak to one of those men in white wigs; and I want you to wait\nhere and keep these two seats for us. Bob will stay with you. Keep an\neye on him\u00e2\u0080\u0094better hold on to his collar. I shan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be more than a minute\nor so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith that the Doctor disappeared into the crowd which filled the main\npart of the room.\n\nThen I saw the judge take up a funny little wooden hammer and knock on\nhis desk with it. This, it seemed, was to make people keep quiet, for\nimmediately every one stopped buzzing and talking and began to listen\nvery respectfully. Then another man in a black gown stood up and began\nreading from a paper in his hand.\n\nHe mumbled away exactly as though he were saying his prayers and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nwant any one to understand what language they were in. But I managed to\ncatch a few words:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_Biz\u00e2\u0080\u0094biz\u00e2\u0080\u0094biz\u00e2\u0080\u0094biz\u00e2\u0080\u0094biz_\u00e2\u0080\u0094otherwise known as Luke the\nHermit, of\u00e2\u0080\u0094_biz\u00e2\u0080\u0094biz\u00e2\u0080\u0094biz\u00e2\u0080\u0094biz_\u00e2\u0080\u0094for killing his partner\nwith\u00e2\u0080\u0094_biz\u00e2\u0080\u0094biz\u00e2\u0080\u0094biz_\u00e2\u0080\u0094otherwise known as Bluebeard Bill on the night\nof the\u00e2\u0080\u0094_biz\u00e2\u0080\u0094biz\u00e2\u0080\u0094biz_\u00e2\u0080\u0094in the _biz\u00e2\u0080\u0094biz\u00e2\u0080\u0094biz_\u00e2\u0080\u0094of Mexico.

It is his business to get Luke off\u00e2\u0080\u0094if he can.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Jenkyns seemed to be an extremely young man with a round smooth\nface like a boy. He shook hands with me and then immediately turned and\nwent on talking with the Doctor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I think it is a perfectly precious idea,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he was saying. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOf\n_course_ the dog must be admitted as a witness; he was the only one\nwho saw the thing take place. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m awfully glad you came. I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nhave missed this for anything. My hat! Won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it make the old court sit\nup? They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re always frightfully dull, these Assizes. But this will stir\nthings. A bulldog witness for the defense! I do hope there are plenty\nof reporters present\u00e2\u0080\u0094Yes, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one making a sketch of the prisoner.\nI shall become known after this\u00e2\u0080\u0094And won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Conkey be pleased? My hat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe put his hand over his mouth to smother a laugh and his eyes fairly\nsparkled with mischief.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho is Conkey?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked the Doctor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSh! He is speaking of the judge up there, the Honorable Eustace\nBeauchamp Conckley.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Jenkyns, bringing out a note-book, \u00e2\u0080\u009ctell me a little\nmore about yourself, Doctor. You took your degree as Doctor of Medicine\nat Durham, I think you said. And the name of your last book was?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI could not hear any more for they talked in whispers; and I fell to\nlooking round the court again.\n\nOf course I could not understand everything that was going on, though\nit was all very interesting. People kept getting up in the place the\nDoctor called the witness-box, and the lawyers at the long table asked\nthem questions about \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe night of the 29th.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then the people would get\ndown again and somebody else would get up and be questioned.\n\nOne of the lawyers (who, the Doctor told me afterwards, was called the\nProsecutor) seemed to be doing his best to get the Hermit into trouble\nby asking questions which made it look as though he had always been a\nvery bad man. He was a nasty lawyer, this Prosecutor, with a long nose.\n\nMost of the time I could hardly keep my eyes off poor Luke, who sat\nthere between his two policemen, staring at the floor as though he\nweren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t interested. The only time I saw him take any notice at all was\nwhen a small dark man with wicked, little, watery eyes got up into the\nwitness-box. I heard Bob snarl under my chair as this person came into\nthe court-room and Luke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes just blazed with anger and contempt.\n\nThis man said his name was Mendoza and that he was the one who had\nguided the Mexican police to the mine after Bluebeard Bill had been\nkilled. And at every word he said I could hear Bob down below me\nmuttering between his teeth,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lie! It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lie! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll chew his face. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lie!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd both the Doctor and I had hard work keeping the dog under the seat.\n\nThen I noticed that our Mr. Jenkyns had disappeared from the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nside. But presently I saw him stand up at the long table to speak to\nthe judge.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour Honor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish to introduce a new witness for the\ndefense, Doctor John Dolittle, the naturalist. Will you please step\ninto the witness-stand, Doctor?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was a buzz of excitement as the Doctor made his way across the\ncrowded room; and I noticed the nasty lawyer with the long nose lean\ndown and whisper something to a friend, smiling in an ugly way which\nmade me want to pinch him.\n\nThen Mr. Jenkyns asked the Doctor a whole lot of questions about\nhimself and made him answer in a loud voice so the whole court could\nhear. He finished up by saying,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you are prepared to swear, Doctor Dolittle, that you understand\nthe language of dogs and can make them understand you. Is that so?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat is so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what, might I ask,\u00e2\u0080\u009d put in the judge in a very quiet, dignified\nvoice, \u00e2\u0080\u009chas all this to do with the killing of er\u00e2\u0080\u0094er\u00e2\u0080\u0094Bluebeard Bill?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis, Your Honor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Jenkyns, talking in a very grand manner as\nthough he were on a stage in a theatre: \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is in this court-room\nat the present moment a bulldog, who was the only living thing that\nsaw the man killed. With the Court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s permission I propose to put that\ndog in the witness-stand and have him questioned before you by the\neminent scientist, Doctor John Dolittle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n_THE SIXTH CHAPTER_\n\nTHE JUDGE\u00e2\u0080\u0099S DOG\n\n\nAT first there was a dead silence in the Court. Then everybody began\nwhispering or giggling at the same time, till the whole room sounded\nlike a great hive of bees. Many people seemed to be shocked; most of\nthem were amused; and a few were angry.\n\nPresently up sprang the nasty lawyer with the long nose.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI protest, Your Honor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, waving his arms wildly to the judge.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI object. The dignity of this court is in peril. I protest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am the one to take care of the dignity of this court,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\njudge.\n\nThen Mr. Jenkyns got up again. (If it hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been such a serious\nmatter, it was almost like a Punch-and-Judy show: somebody was always\npopping down and somebody else popping up).\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf there is any doubt on the score of our being able to do as we say,\nYour Honor will have no objection, I trust, to the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s giving the\nCourt a demonstration of his powers\u00e2\u0080\u0094of showing that he actually can\nunderstand the speech of animals?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI thought I saw a twinkle of amusement come into the old judge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes\nas he sat considering a moment before he answered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said at last, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then he turned to the Doctor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you quite sure you can do this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cQuite, Your Honor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cquite sure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the judge. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you can satisfy us that you\nreally are able to understand canine testimony, the dog shall be\nadmitted as a witness. I do not see, in that case, how I could object\nto his being heard. But I warn you that if you are trying to make a\nlaughing-stock of this Court it will go hard with you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI protest, I protest!\u00e2\u0080\u009d yelled the long-nosed Prosecutor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a\nscandal, an outrage to the Bar!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSit down!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the judge in a very stern voice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat animal does Your Honor wish me to talk with?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the Doctor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would like you to talk to my own dog,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the judge. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is\noutside in the cloak-room. I will have him brought in; and then we\nshall see what you can do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen someone went out and fetched the judge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dog, a lovely great\nRussian wolf-hound with slender legs and a shaggy coat. He was a proud\nand beautiful creature.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, Doctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the judge, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdid you ever see this dog\nbefore?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Remember you are in the witness-stand and under oath.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, Your Honor, I never saw him before.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well then, will you please ask him to tell you what I had for\nsupper last night? He was with me and watched me while I ate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen the Doctor and the dog started talking to one another in signs and\nsounds; and they kept at it for quite a long time. And the Doctor began\nto giggle and get so interested that he seemed to forget all about the\nCourt and the judge and everything else.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a time he takes!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I heard a fat woman in front of me whispering.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only pretending. Of course he can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it! Who ever heard of\ntalking to a dog? He must think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re children.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you finished yet?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the judge asked the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\ntake that long just to ask what I had for supper.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh no, Your Honor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe dog told me that long ago.\nBut then he went on to tell me what you did after supper.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever mind that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the judge. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTell me what answer he gave you to\nmy question.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe says you had a mutton-chop, two baked potatoes, a pickled walnut\nand a glass of ale.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Honorable Eustace Beauchamp Conckley went white to the lips.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSounds like witchcraft,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he muttered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI never dreamed\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd after your supper,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Doctor went on, \u00e2\u0080\u009che says you went to see a\nprize-fight and then sat up playing cards for money till twelve o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock\nand came home singing, \u00e2\u0080\u0098We won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat will do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the judge interrupted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am satisfied you can do as\nyou say. The prisoner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dog shall be admitted as a witness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI protest, I object!\u00e2\u0080\u009d screamed the Prosecutor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour Honor, this is\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSit down!\u00e2\u0080\u009d roared the judge. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI say the dog shall be heard. That ends\nthe matter. Put the witness in the stand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd then for the first time in the solemn history of England a dog was\nput in the witness-stand of Her Majesty\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Court of Assizes. And it\nwas I, Tommy Stubbins (when the Doctor made a sign to me across the\nroom) who proudly led Bob up the aisle, through the astonished crowd,\npast the frowning, spluttering, long-nosed Prosecutor, and made him\ncomfortable on a high chair in the witness-box; from where the old\nbulldog sat scowling down over the rail upon the amazed and gaping\njury.\n\n[Illustration: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSat scowling down upon the amazed and gaping jury\u00e2\u0080\u009d]\n\n\n\n\n_THE SEVENTH CHAPTER_\n\nTHE END OF THE MYSTERY\n\n\nTHE trial went swiftly forward after that. Mr. Jenkyns told the Doctor\nto ask Bob what he saw on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cnight of the 29th;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and when Bob had\ntold all he knew and the Doctor had turned it into English for the\njudge and the jury, this was what he had to say:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOn the night of the 29th of November, 1824, I was with my master, Luke\nFitzjohn (otherwise known as Luke the Hermit) and his two partners,\nManuel Mendoza and William Boggs (otherwise known as Bluebeard Bill)\non their gold-mine in Mexico. For a long time these three men had been\nhunting for gold; and they had dug a deep hole in the ground. On the\nmorning of the 29th gold was discovered, lots of it, at the bottom of\nthis hole. And all three, my master and his two partners, were very\nhappy about it because now they would be rich. But Manuel Mendoza asked\nBluebeard Bill to go for a walk with him. These two men I had always\nsuspected of being bad. So when I noticed that they left my master\nbehind, I followed them secretly to see what they were up to. And in a\ndeep cave in the mountains I heard them arrange together to kill Luke\nthe Hermit so that they should get all the gold and he have none.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this point the judge asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere is the witness Mendoza?\nConstable, see that he does not leave the court.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut the wicked little man with the watery eyes had already sneaked out\nwhen no one was looking and he was never seen in Puddleby again.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bob\u00e2\u0080\u0099s statement went on, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI went to my master and tried very\nhard to make him understand that his partners were dangerous men. But\nit was no use. He did not understand dog language. So I did the next\nbest thing: I never let him out of my sight but stayed with him every\nmoment of the day and night.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow the hole that they had made was so deep that to get down and up\nit you had to go in a big bucket tied on the end of a rope; and the\nthree men used to haul one another up and let one another down the mine\nin this way. That was how the gold was brought up too\u00e2\u0080\u0094in the bucket.\nWell, about seven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock in the evening my master was standing at the\ntop of the mine, hauling up Bluebeard Bill who was in the bucket. Just\nas he had got Bill halfway up I saw Mendoza come out of the hut where\nwe all lived. Mendoza thought that Bill was away buying groceries. But\nhe wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t: he was in the bucket. And when Mendoza saw Luke hauling and\nstraining on the rope he thought he was pulling up a bucketful of\ngold. So he drew a pistol from his pocket and came sneaking up behind\nLuke to shoot him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI barked and barked to warn my master of the danger he was in; but he\nwas so busy hauling up Bill (who was a heavy fat man) that he took no\nnotice of me. I saw that if I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do something quick he would surely\nbe shot. So I did a thing I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never done before: suddenly and savagely\nI bit my master in the leg from behind. Luke was so hurt and startled\nthat he did just what I wanted him to do: he let go the rope with both\nhands at once and turned round. And then, _Crash!_ down went Bill in\nhis bucket to the bottom of the mine and he was killed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile my master was busy scolding me Mendoza put his pistol in his\npocket, came up with a smile on his face and looked down the mine.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why, Good Gracious!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said he to Luke, \u00e2\u0080\u0098You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve killed Bluebeard Bill.\nI must go and tell the police\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0094hoping, you see, to get the whole mine\nto himself when Luke should be put in prison. Then he jumped on his\nhorse and galloped away.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd soon my master grew afraid; for he saw that if Mendoza only told\nenough lies to the police, it _would_ look as though he had killed Bill\non purpose. So while Mendoza was gone he and I stole away together\nsecretly and came to England. Here he shaved off his beard and became a\nhermit. And ever since, for fifteen years, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve remained in hiding.\nThis is all I have to say. And I swear it is the truth, every word.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen the Doctor finished reading Bob\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long speech the excitement among\nthe twelve men of the jury was positively terrific. One, a very old\nman with white hair, began to weep in a loud voice at the thought of\npoor Luke hiding on the fen for fifteen years for something he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nhelp. And all the others set to whispering and nodding their heads to\none another.\n\nIn the middle of all this up got that horrible Prosecutor again, waving\nhis arms more wildly than ever.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour Honor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI must object to this evidence as biased.\nOf course the dog would not tell the truth against his own master. I\nobject. I protest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the judge, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are at liberty to cross-examine. It\nis your duty as Prosecutor to prove his evidence untrue. There is the\ndog: question him, if you do not believe what he says.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI thought the long-nosed lawyer would have a fit. He looked first at\nthe dog, then at the Doctor, then at the judge, then back at the dog\nscowling from the witness-box. He opened his mouth to say something;\nbut no words came. He waved his arms some more. His face got redder\nand redder. At last, clutching his forehead, he sank weakly into his\nseat and had to be helped out of the court-room by two friends. As he\nwas half carried through the door he was still feebly murmuring, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nprotest\u00e2\u0080\u0094I object\u00e2\u0080\u0094I protest!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n_THE EIGHTH CHAPTER_\n\nTHREE CHEERS\n\n\nNEXT the judge made a very long speech to the jury; and when it was\nover all the twelve jurymen got up and went out into the next room. And\nat that point the Doctor came back, leading Bob, to the seat beside me.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat have the jurymen gone out for?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey always do that at the end of a trial\u00e2\u0080\u0094to make up their minds\nwhether the prisoner did it or not.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you and Bob go in with them and help them make up their minds\nthe right way?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not allowed. They have to talk it over in secret. Sometimes\nit takes\u00e2\u0080\u0094My Gracious, look, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re coming back already! They didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nspend long over it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nEverybody kept quite still while the twelve men came tramping back\ninto their places in the pews. Then one of them, the leader\u00e2\u0080\u0094a little\nman\u00e2\u0080\u0094stood up and turned to the judge. Every one was holding his breath,\nespecially the Doctor and myself, to see what he was going to say. You\ncould have heard a pin drop while the whole court-room, the whole of\nPuddleby in fact, waited with craning necks and straining ears to hear\nthe weighty words.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour Honor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the little man, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe jury returns a verdict of _Not\nGuilty_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that mean?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked, turning to the Doctor.\n\nBut I found Doctor John Dolittle, the famous naturalist, standing on\ntop of a chair, dancing about on one leg like a schoolboy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt means he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s free!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLuke is free!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be able to come on the voyage with us, won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut I could not hear his answer; for the whole court-room seemed to\nbe jumping up on chairs like the Doctor. The crowd had suddenly gone\ncrazy. All the people were laughing and calling and waving to Luke to\nshow him how glad they were that he was free. The noise was deafening.\n\nThen it stopped. All was quiet again; and the people stood up\nrespectfully while the judge left the Court. For the trial of Luke the\nHermit, that famous trial which to this day they are still talking of\nin Puddleby, was over.\n\nIn the hush while the judge was leaving, a sudden shriek rang out, and\nthere, in the doorway stood a woman, her arms out-stretched to the\nHermit.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLuke!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve found you at last!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s his wife,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the fat woman in front of me whispered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nseen \u00e2\u0080\u0099im in fifteen years, poor dear! What a lovely re-union. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad\nI came. I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have missed this for anything!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs soon as the judge had gone the noise broke out again; and now the\nfolks gathered round Luke and his wife and shook them by the hand and\ncongratulated them and laughed over them and cried over them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome along, Stubbins,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, taking me by the arm, \u00e2\u0080\u009clet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nget out of this while we can.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you going to speak to Luke?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cto ask him if he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\ncome on the voyage?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be a bit of use,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s come for\nhim. No man stands any chance of going on a voyage when his wife hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nseen him in fifteen years. Come along. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s get home to tea. We didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nhave any lunch, remember. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve earned something to eat. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have\none of those mixed meals, lunch and tea combined\u00e2\u0080\u0094with watercress and\nham. Nice change. Come along.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJust as we were going to step out at a side door I heard the crowd\nshouting,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Doctor! The Doctor! Where\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Doctor? The Hermit would have\nhanged if it hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been for the Doctor. Speech! Speech!\u00e2\u0080\u0094The Doctor!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd a man came running up to us and said,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe people are calling for you, Sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m very sorry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m in a hurry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe crowd won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be denied, Sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the man. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey want you to make\na speech in the market-place.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBeg them to excuse me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cwith my compliments. I have\nan appointment at my house\u00e2\u0080\u0094a very important one which I may not break.\nTell Luke to make a speech. Come along, Stubbins, this way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh Lord!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he muttered as we got out into the open air and found\nanother crowd waiting for him at the side door. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s go up that\nalleyway\u00e2\u0080\u0094to the left. Quick!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Run!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe took to our heels, darted through a couple of side streets and just\nmanaged to get away from the crowd.\n\nIt was not till we had gained the Oxenthorpe Road that we dared to\nslow down to a walk and take our breath. And even when we reached the\nDoctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gate and turned to look backwards towards the town, the faint\nmurmur of many voices still reached us on the evening wind.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still clamoring for you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cListen!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe murmur suddenly swelled up into a low distant roar; and although it\nwas a mile and half away you could distinctly hear the words,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThree cheers for Luke the Hermit: Hooray!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Three cheers for his dog:\nHooray!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Three cheers for his wife: Hooray!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Three cheers for the Doctor:\nHooray! Hooray! HOO-R-A-Y!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n_THE NINTH CHAPTER_\n\nTHE PURPLE BIRD-OF-PARADISE\n\n\nPOLYNESIA was waiting for us in the front porch. She looked full of\nsome important news.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Purple Bird-of-Paradise has arrived!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt last!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had begun to fear some accident had\nbefallen her. And how is Miranda?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFrom the excited way in which the Doctor fumbled his key into the lock\nI guessed that we were not going to get our tea right away, even now.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, she seemed all right when she arrived,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polynesia\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009ctired from\nher long journey of course but otherwise all right. But what _do_ you\nthink? That mischief-making sparrow, Cheapside, insulted her as soon\nas she came into the garden. When I arrived on the scene she was in\ntears and was all for turning round and going straight back to Brazil\nto-night. I had the hardest work persuading her to wait till you came.\nShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the study. I shut Cheapside in one of your book-cases and told\nhim I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d tell you exactly what had happened the moment you got home.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Doctor frowned, then walked silently and quickly to the study.\n\nHere we found the candles lit; for the daylight was nearly gone.\nDab-Dab was standing on the floor mounting guard over one of the\nglass-fronted book-cases in which Cheapside had been imprisoned. The\nnoisy little sparrow was still fluttering angrily behind the glass when\nwe came in.\n\nIn the centre of the big table, perched on the ink-stand, stood the\nmost beautiful bird I have ever seen. She had a deep violet-colored\nbreast, scarlet wings and a long, long sweeping tail of gold. She was\nunimaginably beautiful but looked dreadfully tired. Already she had her\nhead under her wing; and she swayed gently from side to side on top of\nthe ink-stand like a bird that has flown long and far.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dab-Dab. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMiranda is asleep. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got this little imp\nCheapside in here. Listen, Doctor: for Heaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake send that sparrow\naway before he does any more mischief. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing but a vulgar little\nnuisance. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had a perfectly awful time trying to get Miranda to\nstay. Shall I serve your tea in here, or will you come into the kitchen\nwhen you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ready?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come into the kitchen, Dab-Dab,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet Cheapside\nout before you go, please.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDab-Dab opened the bookcase-door and Cheapside strutted out trying hard\nnot to look guilty.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCheapside,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor sternly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat did you say to Miranda when\nshe arrived?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say nothing, Doc, straight I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. That is, nothing much. I\nwas picking up crumbs off the gravel path when she comes swanking into\nthe garden, turning up her nose in all directions, as though she owned\nthe earth\u00e2\u0080\u0094just because she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got a lot of colored plumage. A London\nsparrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as good as her any day. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hold by these gawdy bedizened\nforeigners nohow. Why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they stay in their own country?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut what did you say to her that got her so offended?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll I said was, \u00e2\u0080\u0098You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t belong in an English garden; you ought to\nbe in a milliner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s window.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou ought to be ashamed of yourself, Cheapside. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you realize that\nthis bird has come thousands of miles to see me\u00e2\u0080\u0094only to be insulted by\nyour impertinent tongue as soon as she reaches my garden? What do you\nmean by it?\u00e2\u0080\u0094If she had gone away again before I got back to-night I\nwould never have forgiven you\u00e2\u0080\u0094Leave the room.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSheepishly, but still trying to look as though he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care,\nCheapside hopped out into the passage and Dab-Dab closed the door.\n\nThe Doctor went up to the beautiful bird on the ink-stand and gently\nstroked its back. Instantly its head popped out from under its wing.\n\n\n\n\n_THE TENTH CHAPTER_\n\nLONG ARROW, THE SON OF GOLDEN ARROW\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWELL, Miranda,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m terribly sorry this has\nhappened. But you mustn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind Cheapside; he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know any better.\nHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a city bird; and all his life he has had to squabble for a living.\nYou must make allowances. He doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know any better.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMiranda stretched her gorgeous wings wearily. Now that I saw her awake\nand moving I noticed what a superior, well-bred manner she had. There\nwere tears in her eyes and her beak was trembling.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have minded so much,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said in a high silvery voice,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cif I hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been so dreadfully worn out\u00e2\u0080\u0094That and something else,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nadded beneath her breath.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you have a hard time getting here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the Doctor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe worst passage I ever made,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Miranda. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe weather\u00e2\u0080\u0094Well there.\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the use? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m here anyway.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTell me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor as though he had been impatiently waiting to\nsay something for a long time: \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat did Long Arrow say when you gave\nhim my message?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Purple Bird-of-Paradise hung her head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the worst part of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI might almost as well have\nnot come at all. I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t able to deliver your message. I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find\nhim. _Long Arrow, the son of Golden Arrow, has disappeared!_\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDisappeared!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s become of him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNobody knows,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Miranda answered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe had often disappeared before, as\nI have told you\u00e2\u0080\u0094so that the Indians didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know where he was. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\na mighty hard thing to hide away from the birds. I had always been able\nto find some owl or martin who could tell me where he was\u00e2\u0080\u0094if I wanted\nto know. But not this time. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m nearly a fortnight late in\ncoming to you: I kept hunting and hunting, asking everywhere. I went\nover the whole length and breadth of South America. But there wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a\nliving thing could tell me where he was.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was a sad silence in the room after she had finished; the Doctor\nwas frowning in a peculiar sort of way and Polynesia scratched her head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you ask the black parrots?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Polynesia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey usually know\neverything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCertainly I did,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Miranda. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I was so upset at not being\nable to find out anything, that I forgot all about observing the\nweather-signs before I started my flight here. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even bother to\nbreak my journey at the Azores, but cut right across, making for the\nStraits of Gibraltar\u00e2\u0080\u0094as though it were June or July. And of course I\nran into a perfectly frightful storm in mid-Atlantic. I really thought\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never come through it. Luckily I found a piece of a wrecked vessel\nfloating in the sea after the storm had partly died down; and I roosted\non it and took some sleep. If I hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been able to take that rest I\nwouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be here to tell the tale.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPoor Miranda! What a time you must have had!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut\ntell me, were you able to find out whereabouts Long Arrow was last\nseen?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes. A young albatross told me he had seen him on Spidermonkey Island?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSpidermonkey Island? That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s somewhere off the coast of Brazil, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nit?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it. Of course I flew there right away and asked every bird\non the island\u00e2\u0080\u0094and it is a big island, a hundred miles long. It seems\nthat Long Arrow was visiting some peculiar Indians that live there;\nand that when last seen he was going up into the mountains looking for\nrare medicine-plants. I got that from a tame hawk, a pet, which the\nChief of the Indians keeps for hunting partridges with. I nearly got\ncaught and put in a cage for my pains too. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the worst of having\nbeautiful feathers: it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as much as your life is worth to go near most\nhumans\u00e2\u0080\u0094They say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098oh how pretty!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and shoot an arrow or a bullet into\nyou. You and Long Arrow were the only two men that I would ever trust\nmyself near\u00e2\u0080\u0094out of all the people in the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut was he never known to have returned from the mountains?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo. That was the last that was seen or heard of him. I questioned the\nsea-birds around the shores to find out if he had left the island in a\ncanoe. But they could tell me nothing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you think that some accident has happened to him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the Doctor\nin a fearful voice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid it must have,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Miranda shaking her head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said John Dolittle slowly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif I could never meet Long Arrow\nface to face it would be the greatest disappointment in my whole\nlife. Not only that, but it would be a great loss to the knowledge of\nthe human race. For, from what you have told me of him, he knew more\nnatural science than all the rest of us put together; and if he has\ngone without any one to write it down for him, so the world may be the\nbetter for it, it would be a terrible thing. But you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really\nthink that he is dead, do you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n[Illustration: \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098What else can I think?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d]\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat else can I think?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Miranda, bursting into tears, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen for\nsix whole months he has not been seen by flesh, fish or fowl.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n_THE ELEVENTH CHAPTER_\n\nBLIND TRAVEL\n\n\nTHIS news about Long Arrow made us all very sad. And I could see from\nthe silent dreamy way the Doctor took his tea that he was dreadfully\nupset. Every once in a while he would stop eating altogether and sit\nstaring at the spots on the kitchen table-cloth as though his thoughts\nwere far away; till Dab-Dab, who was watching to see that he got a good\nmeal, would cough or rattle the pots in the sink.\n\nI did my best to cheer him up by reminding him of all he had done for\nLuke and his wife that afternoon. And when that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to work, I\nwent on talking about our preparations for the voyage.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you see, Stubbins,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he as we rose from the table and Dab-Dab\nand Chee-Chee began to clear away, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know where to go now. I\nfeel sort of lost since Miranda brought me this news. On this voyage I\nhad planned going to see Long Arrow. I had been looking forward to it\nfor a whole year. I felt he might help me in learning the language of\nthe shellfish\u00e2\u0080\u0094and perhaps in finding some way of getting to the bottom\nof the sea. But now?\u00e2\u0080\u0094He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone! And all his great knowledge has gone\nwith him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen he seemed to fall a-dreaming again.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust to think of it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he murmured. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLong Arrow and I, two\nstudents\u00e2\u0080\u0094Although I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never met him, I felt as though I knew him quite\nwell. For, in his way\u00e2\u0080\u0094without any schooling\u00e2\u0080\u0094he has, all his life, been\ntrying to do the very things which I have tried to do in mine\u00e2\u0080\u0094And now\nhe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone!\u00e2\u0080\u0094A whole world lay between us\u00e2\u0080\u0094And only a bird knew us both!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe went back into the study, where Jip brought the Doctor his slippers\nand his pipe. And after the pipe was lit and the smoke began to fill\nthe room the old man seemed to cheer up a little.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you will go on some voyage, Doctor, won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009ceven if\nyou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go to find Long Arrow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe looked up sharply into my face; and I suppose he saw how anxious I\nwas. Because he suddenly smiled his old, boyish smile and said,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, Stubbins. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go. We mustn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop working and\nlearning, even if poor Long Arrow has disappeared\u00e2\u0080\u0094But where to go:\nthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the question. Where shall we go?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere were so many places that I wanted to go that I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make up\nmy mind right away. And while I was still thinking, the Doctor sat up\nin his chair and said,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI tell you what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do, Stubbins: it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a game I used to play when I\nwas young\u00e2\u0080\u0094before Sarah came to live with me. I used to call it Blind\nTravel. Whenever I wanted to go on a voyage, and I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make up my\nmind where to go, I would take the atlas and open it with my eyes shut.\nNext, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d wave a pencil, still without looking, and stick it down on\nwhatever page had fallen open. Then I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d open my eyes and look. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a\nvery exciting game, is Blind Travel. Because you have to swear, before\nyou begin, that you will go to the place the pencil touches, come what\nmay. Shall we play it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I almost yelled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow thrilling! I hope it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s China\u00e2\u0080\u0094or\nBorneo\u00e2\u0080\u0094or Bagdad.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd in a moment I had scrambled up the bookcase, dragged the big atlas\nfrom the top shelf and laid it on the table before the Doctor.\n\nI knew every page in that atlas by heart. How many days and nights I\nhad lingered over its old faded maps, following the blue rivers from\nthe mountains to the sea; wondering what the little towns really looked\nlike, and how wide were the sprawling lakes! I had had a lot of fun\nwith that atlas, traveling, in my mind, all over the world. I can see\nit now: the first page had no map; it just told you that it was printed\nin Edinburgh in 1808, and a whole lot more about the book. The next\npage was the Solar System, showing the sun and planets, the stars and\nthe moon. The third page was the chart of the North and South Poles.\nThen came the hemispheres, the oceans, the continents and the countries.\n\nAs the Doctor began sharpening his pencil a thought came to me.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat if the pencil falls upon the North Pole,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill we have\nto go there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo. The rules of the game say you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to go any place you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve\nbeen to before. You are allowed another try. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been to the North\nPole,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he ended quietly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cso we shan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to go there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI could hardly speak with astonishment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been to the North pole!_\u00e2\u0080\u009d I managed to gasp out at last. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut\nI thought it was still undiscovered. The map shows all the places\nexplorers have reached to, _trying_ to get there. Why isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t your name\ndown if you discovered it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI promised to keep it a secret. And you must promise me never to\ntell any one. Yes, I discovered the North Pole in April, 1809. But\nshortly after I got there the polar bears came to me in a body and\ntold me there was a great deal of coal there, buried beneath the snow.\nThey knew, they said, that human beings would do anything, and go\nanywhere, to get coal. So would I please keep it a secret. Because\nonce people began coming up there to start coal-mines, their beautiful\nwhite country would be spoiled\u00e2\u0080\u0094and there was nowhere else in the world\ncold enough for polar bears to be comfortable. So of course I had to\npromise them I would. Ah, well, it will be discovered again some day,\nby somebody else. But I want the polar bears to have their play-ground\nto themselves as long as possible. And I daresay it will be a good\nwhile yet\u00e2\u0080\u0094for it certainly is a fiendish place to get to\u00e2\u0080\u0094Well now, are\nwe ready?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Good! Take the pencil and stand here close to the table. When\nthe book falls open, wave the pencil round three times and jab it down.\nReady?\u00e2\u0080\u0094All right. Shut your eyes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was a tense and fearful moment\u00e2\u0080\u0094but very thrilling. We both had our\neyes shut tight. I heard the atlas fall open with a bang. I wondered\nwhat page it was: England or Asia. If it should be the map of Asia, so\nmuch would depend on where that pencil would land. I waved three times\nin a circle. I began to lower my hand. The pencil-point touched the\npage.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I called out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s done.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n_THE TWELFTH CHAPTER_\n\nDESTINY AND DESTINATION\n\n\nWE both opened our eyes; then bumped our heads together with a crack in\nour eagerness to lean over and see where we were to go.\n\nThe atlas lay open at a map called, _Chart of the South Atlantic\nOcean_. My pencil-point was resting right in the center of a tiny\nisland. The name of it was printed so small that the Doctor had to get\nout his strong spectacles to read it. I was trembling with excitement.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_Spidermonkey Island_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he read out slowly. Then he whistled softly\nbeneath his breath. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOf all the extraordinary things! You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve hit upon\nthe very island where Long Arrow was last seen on earth\u00e2\u0080\u0094I wonder\u00e2\u0080\u0094Well,\nwell! How very singular!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go there, Doctor, won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course we will. The rules of the game say we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so glad it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Oxenthorpe or Bristol,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be a\ngrand voyage, this. Look at all the sea we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to cross. Will it\ntake us long?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cnot very. With a good boat and a good wind\nwe should make it easily in four weeks. But isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it extraordinary?\nOf all the places in the world you picked out that one with your eyes\nshut. Spidermonkey Island after all!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Well, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one good thing about\nit: I shall be able to get some Jabizri beetles.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are Jabizri beetles?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are a very rare kind of beetles with peculiar habits. I want to\nstudy them. There are only three countries in the world where they are\nto be found. Spidermonkey Island is one of them. But even there they\nare very scarce.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is this little question-mark after the name of the island for?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\nasked, pointing to the map.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat means that the island\u00e2\u0080\u0099s position in the ocean is not known very\nexactly\u00e2\u0080\u0094that it is somewhere _about_ there. Ships have probably seen it\nin that neighborhood, that is all, most likely. It is quite possible we\nshall be the first white men to land there. But I daresay we shall have\nsome difficulty in finding it first.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHow like a dream it all sounded! The two of us sitting there at the big\nstudy-table; the candles lit; the smoke curling towards the dim ceiling\nfrom the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pipe\u00e2\u0080\u0094the two of us sitting there, talking about\nfinding an island in the ocean and being the first white men to land\nupon it!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll bet it will be a great voyage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt looks a lovely\nisland on the map. Will there be black men there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo. A peculiar tribe of Red Indians lives on it, Miranda tells me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this point the poor Bird-of-Paradise stirred and woke up. In our\nexcitement we had forgotten to speak low.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are going to Spidermonkey Island, Miranda,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\nknow where it is, do you not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know where it was the last time I saw it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the bird. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut\nwhether it will be there still, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you mean?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is always in the same place\nsurely?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot by any means,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Miranda. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you know?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Spidermonkey\nIsland is a _floating_ island. It moves around all over the\nplace\u00e2\u0080\u0094usually somewhere near southern South America. But of course I\ncould surely find it for you if you want to go there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this fresh piece of news I could contain myself no longer. I was\nbursting to tell some one. I ran dancing and singing from the room to\nfind Chee-Chee.\n\nAt the door I tripped over Dab-Dab, who was just coming in with her\nwings full of plates, and fell headlong on my nose.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHas the boy gone crazy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the duck. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere do you think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re\ngoing, ninny?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo Spidermonkey Island!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I shouted, picking myself up and doing\ncart-wheels down the hall\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cSpidermonkey Island! Hooray!\u00e2\u0080\u0094And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a\n_floating_ island!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to Bedlam, I should say,\u00e2\u0080\u009d snorted the housekeeper. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook\nwhat you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done to my best china!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut I was far too happy to listen to her scolding; and I ran on,\nsinging, into the kitchen to find Chee-Chee.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nPART THREE\n\n\n\n\n_THE FIRST CHAPTER_\n\nTHE THIRD MAN\n\n\nTHAT same week we began our preparations for the voyage.\n\nJoe, the mussel-man, had the _Curlew_ moved down the river and tied it\nup along the river-wall, so it would be more handy for loading. And for\nthree whole days we carried provisions down to our beautiful new boat\nand stowed them away.\n\nI was surprised to find how roomy and big she was inside. There were\nthree little cabins, a saloon (or dining-room) and underneath all this,\na big place called the hold where the food and extra sails and other\nthings were kept.\n\nI think Joe must have told everybody in the town about our coming\nvoyage, because there was always a regular crowd watching us when we\nbrought the things down to put aboard. And of course sooner or later\nold Matthew Mugg was bound to turn up.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy Goodness, Tommy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, as he watched me carrying on some sacks\nof flour, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pretty boat! Where might the Doctor be going\nto this voyage?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to Spidermonkey Island,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said proudly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd be you the only one the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taking along?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, he has spoken of wanting to take another man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut so\nfar he hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t made up his mind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMatthew grunted; then squinted up at the graceful masts of the _Curlew_.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know, Tommy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for my rheumatism I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve half\na mind to come with the Doctor myself. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something about a boat\nstanding ready to sail that always did make me feel venturesome and\ntravelish-like. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that stuff in the cans you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking on?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is treacle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009ctwenty pounds of treacle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy Goodness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he sighed, turning away sadly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat makes me feel more\nlike going with you than ever\u00e2\u0080\u0094But my rheumatism is that bad I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nhardly\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hear any more for Matthew had moved off, still mumbling, into\nthe crowd that stood about the wharf. The clock in Puddleby Church\nstruck noon and I turned back, feeling very busy and important, to the\ntask of loading.\n\nBut it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very long before some one else came along and\ninterrupted my work. This was a huge, big, burly man with a red beard\nand tattoo-marks all over his arms. He wiped his mouth with the back of\nhis hand, spat twice on to the river-wall and said,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBoy, where\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the skipper?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe _skipper_!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Who do you mean?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe captain\u00e2\u0080\u0094Where\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the captain of this craft?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, pointing to\nthe _Curlew_.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, you mean the Doctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, he isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t here at present.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt that moment the Doctor arrived with his arms full of note-books and\nbutterfly-nets and glass cases and other natural history things. The\nbig man went up to him, respectfully touching his cap.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood morning, Captain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI heard you was in need of hands for\na voyage. My name\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ben Butcher, able seaman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am very glad to know you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid I shan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nbe able to take on any more crew.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, but Captain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the able seaman, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou surely ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to\nface deep-sea weather with nothing more than this bit of a lad to help\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0094and with a cutter that big!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Doctor assured him that he was; but the man didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go away. He hung\naround and argued. He told us he had known of many ships being sunk\nthrough \u00e2\u0080\u009cundermanning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He got out what he called his _stiffikit_\u00e2\u0080\u0094a\npaper which said what a good sailor he was\u00e2\u0080\u0094and implored us, if we\nvalued our lives, to take him.\n\n[Illustration: \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Boy, where\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the skipper?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d]\n\nBut the Doctor was quite firm\u00e2\u0080\u0094polite but determined\u00e2\u0080\u0094and finally the man\nwalked sorrowfully away, telling us he never expected to see us alive\nagain.\n\nCallers of one sort and another kept us quite busy that morning.\nThe Doctor had no sooner gone below to stow away his note-books\nthan another visitor appeared upon the gang-plank. This was a most\nextraordinary-looking black man. The only other negroes I had seen\nhad been in circuses, where they wore feathers and bone necklaces and\nthings like that. But this one was dressed in a fashionable frock coat\nwith an enormous bright red cravat. On his head was a straw hat with\na gay band; and over this he held a large green umbrella. He was very\nsmart in every respect except his feet. He wore no shoes or socks.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPardon me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, bowing elegantly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut is this the ship of the\nphysician Dolittle?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdid you wish to see him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI did\u00e2\u0080\u0094if it will not be discommodious,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho shall I say it is?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am Bumpo Kahbooboo, Crown Prince of Jolliginki.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI ran downstairs at once and told the Doctor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow fortunate!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried John Dolittle. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy old friend Bumpo! Well,\nwell!\u00e2\u0080\u0094He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s studying at Oxford, you know. How good of him to come all\nthis way to call on me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he tumbled up the ladder to greet his\nvisitor.\n\nThe strange black man seemed to be overcome with joy when the Doctor\nappeared and shook him warmly by the hand.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNews reached me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you were about to sail upon a voyage.\nI hastened to see you before your departure. I am sublimely ecstasied\nthat I did not miss you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou very nearly did miss us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs it happened, we\nwere delayed somewhat in getting the necessary number of men to sail\nour boat. If it hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been for that, we would have been gone three\ndays ago.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow many men does your ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s company yet require?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Bumpo.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it is so hard to find the right one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMethinks I detect something of the finger of Destination in this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsaid Bumpo. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow would I do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSplendidly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut what about your studies? You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nvery well just go off and leave your university career to take care of\nitself, you know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI need a holiday,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bumpo. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEven had I not gone with you, I\nintended at the end of this term to take a three-months\u00e2\u0080\u0099 absconsion\u00e2\u0080\u0094But\nbesides, I shall not be neglecting my edification if I accompany you.\nBefore I left Jolliginki my august father, the King, told me to be\nsure and travel plenty. You are a man of great studiosity. To see the\nworld in your company is an opportunity not to be sneezed upon. No, no,\nindeed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow did you like the life at Oxford?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the Doctor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, passably, passably,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bumpo. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI liked it all except the\nalgebra and the shoes. The algebra hurt my head and the shoes hurt my\nfeet. I threw the shoes over a wall as soon as I got out of the college\nquadrilateral this morning; and the algebra I am happily forgetting\nvery fast\u00e2\u0080\u0094I liked Cicero\u00e2\u0080\u0094Yes, I think Cicero\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fine\u00e2\u0080\u0094so simultaneous.\nBy the way, they tell me his son is rowing for our college next\nyear\u00e2\u0080\u0094charming fellow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Doctor looked down at the black man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s huge bare feet thoughtfully a\nmoment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said slowly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is something in what you say, Bumpo,\nabout getting education from the world as well as from the college. And\nif you are really sure that you want to come, we shall be delighted to\nhave you. Because, to tell you the truth, I think you are exactly the\nman we need.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n_THE SECOND CHAPTER_\n\nGOOD-BYE!\n\n\nTWO days after that we had all in readiness for our departure.\n\nOn this voyage Jip begged so hard to be taken that the Doctor finally\ngave in and said he could come. Polynesia and Chee-Chee were the only\nother animals to go with us. Dab-Dab was left in charge of the house\nand the animal family we were to leave behind.\n\nOf course, as is always the way, at the last moment we kept remembering\nthings we had forgotten; and when we finally closed the house up and\nwent down the steps to the road, we were all burdened with armfuls of\nodd packages.\n\nHalfway to the river, the Doctor suddenly remembered that he had left\nthe stock-pot boiling on the kitchen-fire. However, we saw a blackbird\nflying by who nested in our garden, and the Doctor asked her to go back\nfor us and tell Dab-Dab about it.\n\nDown at the river-wall we found a great crowd waiting to see us off.\n\nStanding right near the gang-plank were my mother and father. I hoped\nthat they would not make a scene, or burst into tears or anything like\nthat. But as a matter of fact they behaved quite well\u00e2\u0080\u0094for parents. My\nmother said something about being sure not to get my feet wet; and my\nfather just smiled a crooked sort of smile, patted me on the back and\nwished me luck. Good-byes are awfully uncomfortable things and I was\nglad when it was over and we passed on to the ship.\n\nWe were a little surprised not to see Matthew Mugg among the crowd. We\nhad felt sure that he would be there; and the Doctor had intended to\ngive him some extra instructions about the food for the animals we had\nleft at the house.\n\nAt last, after much pulling and tugging, we got the anchor up and undid\na lot of mooring-ropes. Then the _Curlew_ began to move gently down the\nriver with the out-running tide, while the people on the wall cheered\nand waved their handkerchiefs.\n\nWe bumped into one or two other boats getting out into the stream; and\nat one sharp bend in the river we got stuck on a mud bank for a few\nminutes. But though the people on the shore seemed to get very excited\nat these things, the Doctor did not appear to be disturbed by them in\nthe least.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese little accidents will happen in the most carefully regulated\nvoyages,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said as he leaned over the side and fished for his boots\nwhich had got stuck in the mud while we were pushing off. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSailing is\nmuch easier when you get out into the open sea. There aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so many\nsilly things to bump into.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFor me indeed it was a great and wonderful feeling, that getting out\ninto the open sea, when at length we passed the little lighthouse at\nthe mouth of the river and found ourselves free of the land. It was all\nso new and different: just the sky above you and sea below. This ship,\nwhich was to be our house and our street, our home and our garden, for\nso many days to come, seemed so tiny in all this wide water\u00e2\u0080\u0094so tiny and\nyet so snug, sufficient, safe.\n\nI looked around me and took in a deep breath. The Doctor was at the\nwheel steering the boat which was now leaping and plunging gently\nthrough the waves. (I had expected to feel seasick at first but was\ndelighted to find that I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.) Bumpo had been told off to go\ndownstairs and prepare dinner for us. Chee-Chee was coiling up ropes\nin the stern and laying them in neat piles. My work was fastening down\nthe things on the deck so that nothing could roll about if the weather\nshould grow rough when we got further from the land. Jip was up in the\npeak of the boat with ears cocked and nose stuck out\u00e2\u0080\u0094like a statue, so\nstill\u00e2\u0080\u0094his keen old eyes keeping a sharp look-out for floating wrecks,\nsand-bars, and other dangers. Each one of us had some special job to\ndo, part of the proper running of a ship. Even old Polynesia was taking\nthe sea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s temperature with the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bath-thermometer tied on the\nend of a string, to make sure there were no icebergs near us. As I\nlistened to her swearing softly to herself because she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t read\nthe pesky figures in the fading light, I realized that the voyage had\nbegun in earnest and that very soon it would be night\u00e2\u0080\u0094my first night at\nsea!\n\n\n\n\n_THE THIRD CHAPTER_\n\nOUR TROUBLES BEGIN\n\n\nJUST before supper-time Bumpo appeared from downstairs and went to the\nDoctor at the wheel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA stowaway in the hold, Sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he in a very business-like\nseafaring voice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI just discovered him, behind the flour-bags.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDear me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a nuisance! Stubbins, go down with\nBumpo and bring the man up. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t leave the wheel just now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo Bumpo and I went down into the hold; and there, behind the\nflour-bags, plastered in flour from head to foot, we found a man. After\nwe had swept most of the flour off him with a broom, we discovered\nthat it was Matthew Mugg. We hauled him upstairs sneezing and took him\nbefore the Doctor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy Matthew!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said John Dolittle. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat on earth are you doing here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe temptation was too much for me, Doctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the cat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s-meat-man.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve often asked you to take me on voyages with you and you\nnever would. Well, this time, knowing that you needed an extra man, I\nthought if I stayed hid till the ship was well at sea you would find I\ncame in handy like and keep me. But I had to lie so doubled up, for\nhours, behind them flour-bags, that my rheumatism came on something\nawful. I just had to change my position; and of course just as I\nstretched out my legs along comes this here African cook of yours and\nsees my feet sticking out\u00e2\u0080\u0094Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t this ship roll something awful! How\nlong has this storm been going on? I reckon this damp sea air wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nbe very good for my rheumatics.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, Matthew it really isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. You ought not to have come. You are not\nin any way suited to this kind of a life. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enjoy\na long voyage a bit. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll stop in at Penzance and put you ashore.\nBumpo, please go downstairs to my bunk; and listen: in the pocket of\nmy dressing-gown you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find some maps. Bring me the small one\u00e2\u0080\u0094with\nblue pencil-marks at the top. I know Penzance is over here on our left\nsomewhere. But I must find out what light-houses there are before I\nchange the ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s course and sail inshore.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery good, Sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bumpo, turning round smartly and making for the\nstairway.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow Matthew,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou can take the coach from Penzance\nto Bristol. And from there it is not very far to Puddleby, as you know.\nDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forget to take the usual provisions to the house every Thursday,\nand be particularly careful to remember the extra supply of herrings\nfor the baby minks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhile we were waiting for the maps Chee-Chee and I set about lighting\nthe lamps: a green one on the right side of the ship, a red one on the\nleft and a white one on the mast.\n\nAt last we heard some one trundling on the stairs again and the Doctor\nsaid,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bumpo with the maps at last!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut to our great astonishment it was not Bumpo alone that appeared but\n_three_ people.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood Lord deliver us! Who are these?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried John Dolittle.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTwo more stowaways, Sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bumpo stepping forward briskly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nfound them in your cabin hiding under the bunk. One woman and one man,\nSir. Here are the maps.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is too much,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor feebly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho are they? I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see\ntheir faces in this dim light. Strike a match, Bumpo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nYou could never guess who it was. It was Luke and his wife. Mrs. Luke\nappeared to be very miserable and seasick.\n\nThey explained to the Doctor that after they had settled down to live\ntogether in the little shack out on the fens, so many people came\nto visit them (having heard about the great trial) that life became\nimpossible; and they had decided to escape from Puddleby in this\nmanner\u00e2\u0080\u0094for they had no money to leave any other way\u00e2\u0080\u0094and try to find\nsome new place to live where they and their story wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be so well\nknown. But as soon as the ship had begun to roll Mrs. Luke had got most\ndreadfully unwell.\n\nPoor Luke apologized many times for being such a nuisance and said that\nthe whole thing had been his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s idea.\n\nThe Doctor, after he had sent below for his medicine-bag and had given\nMrs. Luke some _sal volatile_ and smelling-salts, said he thought the\nbest thing to do would be for him to lend them some money and put them\nashore at Penzance with Matthew. He also wrote a letter for Luke to\ntake with him to a friend the Doctor had in the town of Penzance who,\nit was hoped, would be able to find Luke work to do there.\n\nAs the Doctor opened his purse and took out some gold coins I heard\nPolynesia, who was sitting on my shoulder watching the whole affair,\nmutter beneath her breath,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere he goes\u00e2\u0080\u0094lending his last blessed penny\u00e2\u0080\u0094three pounds ten\u00e2\u0080\u0094all\nthe money we had for the whole trip! Now we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the price of a\npostage-stamp aboard if we should lose an anchor or have to buy a pint\nof tar\u00e2\u0080\u0094Well, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pray we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t run out of food\u00e2\u0080\u0094Why doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he give\nthem the ship and walk home?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPresently with the help of the map the course of the boat was changed\nand, to Mrs. Luke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great relief, we made for Penzance and dry land.\n\nI was tremendously interested to see how a ship could be steered into a\nport at night with nothing but light-houses and a compass to guide you.\nIt seemed to me that the Doctor missed all the rocks and sand-bars very\ncleverly.\n\nWe got into that funny little Cornish harbor about eleven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock that\nnight. The Doctor took his stowaways on shore in our small row-boat\nwhich we kept on the deck of the _Curlew_ and found them rooms at\nthe hotel there. When he got back he told us that Mrs. Luke had gone\nstraight to bed and was feeling much better.\n\nIt was now after midnight; so we decided to stay in the harbor and wait\ntill morning before setting out again.\n\nI was glad to get to bed, although I felt that staying up so\ntremendously late was great fun. As I climbed into the bunk over the\nDoctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and pulled the blankets snugly round me, I found I could look\nout of the port-hole at my elbow, and, without raising my head from\nthe pillow, could see the lights of Penzance swinging gently up and\ndown with the motion of the ship at anchor. It was like being rocked\nto sleep with a little show going on to amuse you. I was just deciding\nthat I liked the life of the sea very much when I fell fast asleep.\n\n\n\n\n_THE FOURTH CHAPTER_\n\nOUR TROUBLES CONTINUE\n\n\nTHE next morning when we were eating a very excellent breakfast of\nkidneys and bacon, prepared by our good cook Bumpo, the Doctor said to\nme,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was just wondering, Stubbins, whether I should stop at the Capa\nBlanca Islands or run right across for the coast of Brazil. Miranda\nsaid we could expect a spell of excellent weather now\u00e2\u0080\u0094for four and a\nhalf weeks at least.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, spooning out the sugar at the bottom of my cocoa-cup,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should think it would be best to make straight across while we\nare sure of good weather. And besides the Purple Bird-of-Paradise is\ngoing to keep a lookout for us, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t she? She\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be wondering what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhappened to us if we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get there in about a month.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrue, quite true, Stubbins. On the other hand, the Capa Blancas make\na very convenient stopping place on our way across. If we should need\nsupplies or repairs it would be very handy to put in there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow long will it take us from here to the Capa Blancas?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAbout six days,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, we can decide later. For the\nnext two days at any rate our direction would be the same practically\nin either case. If you have finished breakfast let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s go and get under\nway.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nUpstairs I found our vessel surrounded by white and gray seagulls\nwho flashed and circled about in the sunny morning air, looking for\nfood-scraps thrown out by the ships into the harbor.\n\nBy about half past seven we had the anchor up and the sails set to a\nnice steady breeze; and this time we got out into the open sea without\nbumping into a single thing. We met the Penzance fishing fleet coming\nin from the night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fishing, and very trim and neat they looked, in a\nline like soldiers, with their red-brown sails all leaning over the\nsame way and the white water dancing before their bows.\n\nFor the next three or four days everything went smoothly and nothing\nunusual happened. During this time we all got settled down into our\nregular jobs; and in spare moments the Doctor showed each of us how to\ntake our turns at the wheel, the proper manner of keeping a ship on her\nright course, and what to do if the wind changed suddenly. We divided\nthe twenty-four hours of the day into three spells; and we took it in\nturns to sleep our eight hours and be awake sixteen. So the ship was\nwell looked after, with two of us always on duty.\n\nBesides that, Polynesia, who was an older sailor than any of us, and\nreally knew a lot about running ships, seemed to be always awake\u00e2\u0080\u0094except\nwhen she took her couple of winks in the sun, standing on one leg\nbeside the wheel. You may be sure that no one ever got a chance to stay\nabed more than his eight hours while Polynesia was around. She used to\nwatch the ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clock; and if you overslept a half-minute, she would\ncome down to the cabin and peck you gently on the nose till you got up.\n\nI very soon grew to be quite fond of our funny black friend Bumpo,\nwith his grand way of speaking and his enormous feet which some one\nwas always stepping on or falling over. Although he was much older\nthan I was and had been to college, he never tried to lord it over me.\nHe seemed to be forever smiling and kept all of us in good humor. It\nwasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t long before I began to see the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good sense in bringing\nhim\u00e2\u0080\u0094in spite of the fact that he knew nothing whatever about sailing or\ntravel.\n\nOn the morning of the fifth day out, just as I was taking the wheel\nover from the Doctor, Bumpo appeared and said,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe salt beef is nearly all gone, Sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe salt beef!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, we brought a hundred and\ntwenty pounds with us. We couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have eaten that in five days. What\ncan have become of it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n[Illustration: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn these lower levels we came upon the shadowy shapes\nof dead ships\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n_Page 360_]\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, Sir, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure. Every time I go down to the stores I find\nanother hunk missing. If it is rats that are eating it, then they are\ncertainly colossal rodents.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPolynesia who was walking up and down a stay-rope taking her morning\nexercise, put in,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe must search the hold. If this is allowed to go on we will all be\nstarving before a week is out. Come downstairs with me, Tommy, and we\nwill look into this matter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo we went downstairs into the store-room and Polynesia told us to keep\nquite still and listen. This we did. And presently we heard from a dark\ncorner of the hold the distinct sound of someone snoring.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, I thought so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polynesia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a man\u00e2\u0080\u0094and a big one. Climb\nin there, both of you, and haul him out. It sounds as though he were\nbehind that barrel\u00e2\u0080\u0094Gosh! We seem to have brought half of Puddleby with\nus. Anyone would think we were a penny ferry-boat. Such cheek! Haul him\nout.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo Bumpo and I lit a lantern and climbed over the stores. And there,\nbehind the barrel, sure enough, we found an enormous bearded man fast\nasleep with a well-fed look on his face. We woke him up.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWashamarrer?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said sleepily.\n\nIt was Ben Butcher, the able seaman.\n\nPolynesia spluttered like an angry fire-cracker.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is the last straw,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe one man in the world we least\nwanted. Shiver my timbers, what cheek!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWould it not be, advisable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d suggested Bumpo, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhile the varlet is\nstill sleepy, to strike him on the head with some heavy object and push\nhim through a port-hole into the sea?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099d get into trouble,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polynesia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not in Jolliginki\nnow, you know\u00e2\u0080\u0094worse luck!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Besides, there never was a port-hole big\nenough to push that man through. Bring him upstairs to the Doctor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo we led the man to the wheel where he respectfully touched his cap to\nthe Doctor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnother stowaway, Sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bumpo smartly.\n\nI thought the poor Doctor would have a fit.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood morning, Captain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the man. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBen Butcher, able seaman, at\nyour service. I knew you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d need me, so I took the liberty of stowing\naway\u00e2\u0080\u0094much against my conscience. But I just couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bear to see you\npoor landsmen set out on this voyage without a single real seaman to\nhelp you. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never have got home alive if I hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come\u00e2\u0080\u0094Why look at\nyour mainsail, Sir\u00e2\u0080\u0094all loose at the throat. First gust of wind come\nalong, and away goes your canvas overboard\u00e2\u0080\u0094Well, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all right now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\nhere. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll soon get things in shipshape.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t all right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all wrong. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not\nat all glad to see you. I told you in Puddleby I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want you. You\nhad no right to come.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut Captain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the able seaman, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sail this ship without\nme. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand navigation. Why, look at the compass now:\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve let her swing a point and a half off her course. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s madness\nfor you to try to do this trip alone\u00e2\u0080\u0094if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll pardon my saying so,\nSir. Why\u00e2\u0080\u0094why, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll lose the ship!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, a sudden stern look coming into his\neyes, \u00e2\u0080\u009closing a ship is nothing to me. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve lost ships before and it\ndoesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother me in the least. When I set out to go to a place, I get\nthere. Do you understand? I may know nothing whatever about sailing\nand navigation, but I get there just the same. Now you may be the best\nseaman in the world, but on _this_ ship you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just a plain ordinary\nnuisance\u00e2\u0080\u0094very plain and very ordinary. And I am now going to call at\nthe nearest port and put you ashore.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, and think yourself lucky,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Polynesia put in, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you are not\nlocked up for stowing away and eating all our salt beef.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what the mischief we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to do now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I heard her\nwhisper to Bumpo. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve no money to buy any more; and that salt beef\nwas the most important part of the stores.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWould it not be good political economy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bumpo whispered back, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif\nwe salted the able seaman and ate him instead? I should judge that he\nwould weigh more than a hundred and twenty pounds.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow often must I tell you that we are not in Jolliginki,\u00e2\u0080\u009d snapped\nPolynesia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThose things are not done on white men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ships\u00e2\u0080\u0094Still,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nmurmured after a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thought, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an awfully bright idea. I\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t suppose anybody saw him come on to the ship\u00e2\u0080\u0094Oh, but Heavens! we\nhaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t got enough salt. Besides, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be sure to taste of tobacco.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n_THE FIFTH CHAPTER_\n\nPOLYNESIA HAS A PLAN\n\n\nTHEN the Doctor told me to take the wheel while he made a little\ncalculation with his map and worked out what new course we should take.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall have to run for the Capa Blancas after all,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told me when\nthe seaman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back was turned. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDreadful nuisance! But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d sooner swim\nback to Puddleby than have to listen to that fellow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talk all the way\nto Brazil.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIndeed he was a terrible person, this Ben Butcher. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099d think that any\none after being told he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wanted would have had the decency to\nkeep quiet. But not Ben Butcher. He kept going round the deck pointing\nout all the things we had wrong. According to him there wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a thing\nright on the whole ship. The anchor was hitched up wrong; the hatches\nweren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fastened down properly; the sails were put on back to front;\nall our knots were the wrong kind of knots.\n\nAt last the Doctor told him to stop talking and go downstairs. He\nrefused\u00e2\u0080\u0094said he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to be sunk by landlubbers while he was\nstill able to stay on deck.\n\nThis made us feel a little uneasy. He was such an enormous man there\nwas no knowing what he might do if he got really obstreperous.\n\nBumpo and I were talking about this downstairs in the dining-saloon\nwhen Polynesia, Jip and Chee-Chee came and joined us. And, as usual,\nPolynesia had a plan.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cListen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am certain this Ben Butcher is a smuggler and a\nbad man. I am a very good judge of seamen, remember, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like\nthe cut of this man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s jib. I\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you really think,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I interrupted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat it _is_ safe for the Doctor\nto cross the Atlantic without any regular seamen on his ship?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nYou see it had upset me quite a good deal to find that all the things\nwe had been doing were wrong; and I was beginning to wonder what might\nhappen if we ran into a storm\u00e2\u0080\u0094particularly as Miranda had only said the\nweather would be good for a certain time; and we seemed to be having so\nmany delays. But Polynesia merely tossed her head scornfully.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, bless you, my boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re always safe with John\nDolittle. Remember that. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take any notice of that stupid old salt.\nOf course it is perfectly true the Doctor does do everything wrong. But\nwith him it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter. Mark my words, if you travel with John\nDolittle you always get there, as you heard him say. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been with him\nlots of times and I know. Sometimes the ship is upside down when you\nget there, and sometimes it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right way up. But you get there just the\nsame. And then of course there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another thing about the Doctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nadded thoughtfully: \u00e2\u0080\u009che always has extraordinary good luck. He may have\nhis troubles; but with him things seem to have a habit of turning out\nall right in the end. I remember once when we were going through the\nStraits of Magellan the wind was so strong\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut what are we going to do about Ben Butcher?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jip put in. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou had\nsome plan Polynesia, hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes. What I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid of is that he may hit the Doctor on the head when\nhe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not looking and make himself captain of the _Curlew_. Bad sailors\ndo that sometimes. Then they run the ship their own way and take it\nwhere they want. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what you call a mutiny.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jip, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand we ought to do something pretty quick. We can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nreach the Capa Blancas before the day after to-morrow at best. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nlike to leave the Doctor alone with him for a minute. He smells like a\nvery bad man to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got it all worked out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polynesia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cListen: is there a\nkey in that door?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe looked outside the dining-room and found that there was.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polynesia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow Bumpo lays the table for lunch and\nwe all go and hide. Then at twelve o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock Bumpo rings the dinner-bell\ndown here. As soon as Ben hears it he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come down expecting more salt\nbeef. Bumpo must hide behind the door outside. The moment that Ben is\nseated at the dining-table Bumpo slams the door and locks it. Then\nwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got him. See?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow stratagenious!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bumpo chuckled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs Cicero said, _parrots cum\nparishioners facilime congregation_. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll lay the table at once.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes and take that Worcestershire sauce off the dresser with you when\nyou go out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polynesia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t leave any loose eatables around.\nThat fellow has had enough to last any man for three days. Besides, he\nwon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be so inclined to start a fight when we put him ashore at the\nCapa Blancas if we thin him down a bit before we let him out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo we all went and hid ourselves in the passage where we could watch\nwhat happened. And presently Bumpo came to the foot of the stairs and\nrang the dinner-bell like mad. Then he hopped behind the dining-room\ndoor and we all kept still and listened.\n\nAlmost immediately, _thump_, _thump_, _thump_, down the stairs tramped\nBen Butcher, the able seaman. He walked into the dining-saloon, sat\nhimself down at the head of the table in the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s place, tucked a\nnapkin under his fat chin and heaved a sigh of expectation.\n\nThen, _bang_! Bumpo slammed the door and locked it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat settles _him_ for a while,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polynesia coming out from her\nhiding-place. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow let him teach navigation to the side-board. Gosh,\nthe cheek of the man! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve forgotten more about the sea than that\nlumbering lout will ever know. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s go upstairs and tell the Doctor.\nBumpo, you will have to serve the meals in the cabin for the next\ncouple of days.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd bursting into a rollicking Norwegian sea-song, she climbed up to my\nshoulder and we went on deck.\n\n\n\n\n_THE SIXTH CHAPTER_\n\nTHE BED-MAKER OF MONTEVERDE\n\n\nWE remained three days in the Capa Blanca Islands.\n\nThere were two reasons why we stayed there so long when we were really\nin such a hurry to get away. One was the shortage in our provisions\ncaused by the able seaman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enormous appetite. When we came to go over\nthe stores and make a list, we found that he had eaten a whole lot of\nother things besides the beef. And having no money, we were sorely\npuzzled how to buy more. The Doctor went through his trunk to see if\nthere was anything he could sell. But the only thing he could find\nwas an old watch with the hands broken and the back dented in; and we\ndecided this would not bring us in enough money to buy much more than a\npound of tea. Bumpo suggested that he sing comic songs in the streets\nwhich he had learned in Jolliginki. But the Doctor said he did not\nthink that the islanders would care for African music.\n\nThe other thing that kept us was the bullfight. In these islands, which\nbelonged to Spain, they had bullfights every Sunday. It was on a Friday\nthat we arrived there; and after we had got rid of the able seaman we\ntook a walk through the town.\n\nIt was a very funny little town, quite different from any that I had\never seen. The streets were all twisty and winding and so narrow that a\nwagon could only just pass along them. The houses over-hung at the top\nand came so close together that people in the attics could lean out of\nthe windows and shake hands with their neighbors on the opposite side\nof the street. The Doctor told us the town was very, very old. It was\ncalled Monteverde.\n\nAs we had no money of course we did not go to a hotel or anything like\nthat. But on the second evening when we were passing by a bed-maker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nshop we noticed several beds, which the man had made, standing on\nthe pavement outside. The Doctor started chatting in Spanish to the\nbed-maker who was sitting at his door whistling to a parrot in a cage.\nThe Doctor and the bed-maker got very friendly talking about birds and\nthings. And as it grew near to supper-time the man asked us to stop and\nsup with him.\n\nThis of course we were very glad to do. And after the meal was over\n(very nice dishes they were, mostly cooked in olive-oil\u00e2\u0080\u0094I particularly\nliked the fried bananas) we sat outside on the pavement again and went\non talking far into the night.\n\nAt last when we got up to go back to our ship, this very nice\nshopkeeper wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hear of our going away on any account. He said the\nstreets down by the harbor were very badly lighted and there was no\nmoon. We would surely get lost. He invited us to spend the night with\nhim and go back to our ship in the morning.\n\nWell, we finally agreed; and as our good friend had no spare bedrooms,\nthe three of us, the Doctor, Bumpo and I, slept on the beds set out for\nsale on the pavement before the shop. The night was so hot we needed\nno coverings. It was great fun to fall asleep out of doors like this,\nwatching the people walking to and fro and the gay life of the streets.\nIt seemed to me that Spanish people never went to bed at all. Late as\nit was, all the little restaurants and caf\u00c3\u00a9s around us were wide open,\nwith customers drinking coffee and chatting merrily at the small tables\noutside. The sound of a guitar strumming softly in the distance mingled\nwith the clatter of chinaware and the babble of voices.\n\nSomehow it made me think of my mother and father far away in Puddleby,\nwith their regular habits, the evening practise on the flute and the\nrest\u00e2\u0080\u0094doing the same thing every day. I felt sort of sorry for them in\na way, because they missed the fun of this traveling life, where we\nwere doing something new all the time\u00e2\u0080\u0094even sleeping differently. But\nI suppose if they had been invited to go to bed on a pavement in front\nof a shop they wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have cared for the idea at all. It is funny how\nsome people are.\n\n[Illustration: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Doctor started chatting in Spanish to the\nbed-maker\u00e2\u0080\u009d]\n\n\n\n\n_THE SEVENTH CHAPTER_\n\nTHE DOCTOR\u00e2\u0080\u0099S WAGER\n\n\nNEXT morning we were awakened by a great racket. There was a procession\ncoming down the street, a number of men in very gay clothes followed\nby a large crowd of admiring ladies and cheering children. I asked the\nDoctor who they were.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are the bullfighters,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is to be a bullfight\nto-morrow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is a bullfight?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\nTo my great surprise the Doctor got red in the face with anger. It\nreminded me of the time when he had spoken of the lions and tigers in\nhis private zoo.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA bullfight is a stupid, cruel, disgusting business,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese\nSpanish people are most lovable and hospitable folk. How they can enjoy\nthese wretched bullfights is a thing I could never understand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen the Doctor went on to explain to me how a bull was first made very\nangry by teasing and then allowed to run into a circus where men came\nout with red cloaks, waved them at him, and ran away. Next the bull was\nallowed to tire himself out by tossing and killing a lot of poor, old,\nbroken-down horses who couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t defend themselves. Then, when the bull\nwas thoroughly out of breath and wearied by this, a man came out with a\nsword and killed the bull.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery Sunday,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin almost every big town in Spain\nthere are six bulls killed like that and as many horses.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the men ever killed by the bull?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnfortunately very seldom,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA bull is not nearly as\ndangerous as he looks, even when he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s angry, if you are only quick on\nyour feet and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lose your head. These bullfighters are very clever\nand nimble. And the people, especially the Spanish ladies, think no\nend of them. A famous bullfighter (or matador, as they call them) is\na more important man in Spain than a king\u00e2\u0080\u0094Here comes another crowd of\nthem round the corner, look. See the girls throwing kisses to them.\nRidiculous business!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt that moment our friend the bed-maker came out to see the procession\ngo past. And while he was wishing us good morning and enquiring how\nwe had slept, a friend of his walked up and joined us. The bed-maker\nintroduced this friend to us as Don Enrique Cardenas.\n\nDon Enrique when he heard where we were from, spoke to us in English.\nHe appeared to be a well-educated, gentlemanly sort of person.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you go to see the bullfight to-morrow, yes?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked the Doctor\npleasantly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCertainly not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said John Dolittle firmly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like\nbullfights\u00e2\u0080\u0094cruel, cowardly shows.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDon Enrique nearly exploded. I never saw a man get so excited. He told\nthe Doctor that he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what he was talking about. He said\nbullfighting was a noble sport and that the matadors were the bravest\nmen in the world.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, rubbish!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou never give the poor bull a chance.\nIt is only when he is all tired and dazed that your precious matadors\ndare to try and kill him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI thought the Spaniard was going to strike the Doctor he got so angry.\nWhile he was still spluttering to find words, the bed-maker came\nbetween them and took the Doctor aside. He explained to John Dolittle\nin a whisper that this Don Enrique Cardenas was a very important\nperson; that he it was who supplied the bulls\u00e2\u0080\u0094a special, strong black\nkind\u00e2\u0080\u0094from his own farm for all the bullfights in the Capa Blancas. He\nwas a very rich man, the bed-maker said, a most important personage. He\nmustn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be allowed to take offense on any account.\n\nI watched the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face as the bed-maker finished, and I saw a\nflash of boyish mischief come into his eyes as though an idea had\nstruck him. He turned to the angry Spaniard.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon Enrique,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou tell me your bullfighters are very\nbrave men and skilful. It seems I have offended you by saying that\nbullfighting is a poor sport. What is the name of the best matador you\nhave for to-morrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s show?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPepito de Malaga,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Don Enrique, \u00e2\u0080\u009cone of the greatest names, one\nof the bravest men, in all Spain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have a proposal to make to you. I\nhave never fought a bull in my life. Now supposing I were to go into\nthe ring to-morrow with Pepito de Malaga and any other matadors you\nchoose; and if I can do more tricks with a bull than they can, would\nyou promise to do something for me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDon Enrique threw back his head and laughed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou must be mad! You would be killed at once. One has\nto be trained for years to become a proper bullfighter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSupposing I were willing to take the risk of that\u00e2\u0080\u0094You are not afraid,\nI take it, to accept my offer?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Spaniard frowned.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfraid!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSir, if you can beat Pepito de Malaga in the\nbull-ring I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll promise you anything it is possible for me to grant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery good,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnow I understand that you are quite a\npowerful man in these islands. If you wished to stop all bullfighting\nhere after to-morrow, you could do it, couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Don Enrique proudly\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cI could.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell that is what I ask of you\u00e2\u0080\u0094if I win my wager,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said John Dolittle.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I can do more with angry bulls than can Pepito de Malaga, you are\nto promise me that there shall never be another bullfight in the Capa\nBlancas so long as you are alive to stop it. Is it a bargain?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Spaniard held out his hand.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a bargain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cI promise. But I must warn you that you\nare merely throwing your life away, for you will certainly be killed.\nHowever, that is no more than you deserve for saying that bullfighting\nis an unworthy sport. I will meet you here to-morrow morning if you\nshould wish to arrange any particulars. Good day, Sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs the Spaniard turned and walked into the shop with the bed-maker,\nPolynesia, who had been listening as usual, flew up on to my shoulder\nand whispered in my ear,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have a plan. Get hold of Bumpo and come some place where the Doctor\ncan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hear us. I want to talk to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI nudged Bumpo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s elbow and we crossed the street and pretended to look\ninto a jeweler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s window; while the Doctor sat down upon his bed to lace\nup his boots, the only part of his clothing he had taken off for the\nnight.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cListen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polynesia, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been breaking my head trying to think\nup some way we can get money to buy those stores with; and at last I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve\ngot it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe money?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bumpo.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, stupid. The idea\u00e2\u0080\u0094to make the money with. Listen: the Doctor is\nsimply bound to win this game to-morrow, sure as you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re alive. Now all\nwe have to do is to make a side bet with these Spaniards\u00e2\u0080\u0094they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re great\non gambling\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the trick\u00e2\u0080\u0099s done.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a side bet?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh I know what that is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bumpo proudly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe used to have lots of\nthem at Oxford when boat-racing was on. I go to Don Enrique and say,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I bet you a hundred pounds the Doctor wins.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Then if he does win, Don\nEnrique pays me a hundred pounds; and if he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, I have to pay Don\nEnrique.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the idea,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polynesia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say a hundred pounds:\nsay two-thousand five-hundred pesetas. Now come and find old Don\nRicky-ticky and try to look rich.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo we crossed the street again and slipped into the bed-maker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shop\nwhile the Doctor was still busy with his boots.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon Enrique,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bumpo, \u00e2\u0080\u009callow me to introduce myself. I am the\nCrown Prince of Jolliginki. Would you care to have a small bet with me\non to-morrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bullfight?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDon Enrique bowed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy certainly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall be delighted. But I must warn you\nthat you are bound to lose. How much?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh a mere truffle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bumpo\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cjust for the fun of the thing, you\nknow. What do you say to three-thousand pesetas?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI agree,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Spaniard bowing once more. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will meet you after\nthe bullfight to-morrow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polynesia as we came out to join the\nDoctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI feel as though quite a load had been taken off my mind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n_THE EIGHTH CHAPTER_\n\nTHE GREAT BULLFIGHT\n\n\nTHE next day was a great day in Monteverde. All the streets were\nhung with flags; and everywhere gaily dressed crowds were to be seen\nflocking towards the bull-ring, as the big circus was called where the\nfights took place.\n\nThe news of the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s challenge had gone round the town and, it\nseemed, had caused much amusement to the islanders. The very idea of\na mere foreigner daring to match himself against the great Pepito de\nMalaga!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Serve him right if he got killed!\n\nThe Doctor had borrowed a bullfighter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suit from Don Enrique; and very\ngay and wonderful he looked in it, though Bumpo and I had hard work\ngetting the waistcoat to close in front and even then the buttons kept\nbursting off it in all directions.\n\nWhen we set out from the harbor to walk to the bull-ring, crowds of\nsmall boys ran after us making fun of the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fatness, calling\nout, \u00e2\u0080\u009c_Juan Hagapoco, el grueso matador!_\u00e2\u0080\u009d which is the Spanish for,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJohn Dolittle, the fat bullfighter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs soon as we arrived the Doctor said he would like to take a look\nat the bulls before the fight began; and we were at once led to the\nbull pen where, behind a high railing, six enormous black bulls were\ntramping around wildly.\n\nIn a few hurried words and signs the Doctor told the bulls what he was\ngoing to do and gave them careful instructions for their part of the\nshow. The poor creatures were tremendously glad when they heard that\nthere was a chance of bullfighting being stopped; and they promised to\ndo exactly as they were told.\n\nOf course the man who took us in there didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand what we were\ndoing. He merely thought the fat Englishman was crazy when he saw the\nDoctor making signs and talking in ox tongue.\n\nFrom there the Doctor went to the matadors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 dressing-rooms while Bumpo\nand I with Polynesia made our way into the bull-ring and took our seats\nin the great open-air theatre.\n\nIt was a very gay sight. Thousands of ladies and gentlemen were there,\nall dressed in their smartest clothes; and everybody seemed very happy\nand cheerful.\n\nRight at the beginning Don Enrique got up and explained to the people\nthat the first item on the program was to be a match between the\nEnglish Doctor and Pepito de Malaga. He told them what he had promised\nif the Doctor should win. But the people did not seem to think there\nwas much chance of that. A roar of laughter went up at the very\nmention of such a thing.\n\nWhen Pepito came into the ring everybody cheered, the ladies blew\nkisses and the men clapped and waved their hats.\n\nPresently a large door on the other side of the ring was rolled back\nand in galloped one of the bulls; then the door was closed again. At\nonce the matador became very much on the alert. He waved his red cloak\nand the bull rushed at him. Pepito stepped nimbly aside and the people\ncheered again.\n\nThis game was repeated several times. But I noticed that whenever\nPepito got into a tight place and seemed to be in real danger from the\nbull, an assistant of his, who always hung around somewhere near, drew\nthe bull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention upon himself by waving another red cloak. Then\nthe bull would chase the assistant and Pepito was left in safety. Most\noften, as soon as he had drawn the bull off, this assistant ran for the\nhigh fence and vaulted out of the ring to save himself. They evidently\nhad it all arranged, these matadors; and it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to me that they\nwere in any very great danger from the poor clumsy bull so long as they\ndidn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t slip and fall.\n\nAfter about ten minutes of this kind of thing the small door into the\nmatadors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 dressing-room opened and the Doctor strolled into the ring.\nAs soon as his fat figure, dressed in sky-blue velvet, appeared, the\ncrowd rocked in their seats with laughter.\n\nJuan Hagapoco, as they had called him, walked out into the centre of\nthe ring and bowed ceremoniously to the ladies in the boxes. Then he\nbowed to the bull. Then he bowed to Pepito. While he was bowing to\nPepito\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assistant the bull started to rush at him from behind.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook out! Look out!\u00e2\u0080\u0094The bull! You will be killed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d yelled the crowd.\n\nBut the Doctor calmly finished his bow. Then turning round he folded\nhis arms, fixed the on-rushing bull with his eye and frowned a terrible\nfrown.\n\nPresently a curious thing happened: the bull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speed got slower and\nslower. It almost looked as though he were afraid of that frown. Soon\nhe stopped altogether. The Doctor shook his finger at him. He began to\ntremble. At last, tucking his tail between his legs, the bull turned\nround and ran away.\n\nThe crowd gasped. The Doctor ran after him. Round and round the ring\nthey went, both of them puffing and blowing like grampuses. Excited\nwhispers began to break out among the people. This was something new\nin bullfighting, to have the bull running away from the man, instead\nof the man away from the bull. At last in the tenth lap, with a final\nburst of speed, Juan Hagapoco, the English matador, caught the poor\nbull by the tail.\n\nThen leading the now timid creature into the middle of the ring, the\nDoctor made him do all manner of tricks: standing on the hind legs,\nstanding on the front legs, dancing, hopping, rolling over. He finished\nup by making the bull kneel down; then he got on to his back and did\nhandsprings and other acrobatics on the beast\u00e2\u0080\u0099s horns.\n\nPepito and his assistant had their noses sadly out of joint. The crowd\nhad forgotten them entirely. They were standing together by the fence\nnot far from where I sat, muttering to one another and slowly growing\ngreen with jealousy.\n\nFinally the Doctor turned towards Don Enrique\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seat and bowing said in\na loud voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis bull is no good any more. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s terrified and out of\nbreath. Take him away, please.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoes the caballero wish for a fresh bull?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Don Enrique.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want five fresh bulls. And I would like them\nall in the ring at once, please.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this a cry of horror burst from the people. They had been used to\nseeing matadors escaping from one bull at a time. But _five_!\u00e2\u0080\u0094That must\nmean certain death.\n\nPepito sprang forward and called to Don Enrique not to allow it, saying\nit was against all the rules of bullfighting. (\u00e2\u0080\u009cHa!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Polynesia\nchuckled into my ear. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s navigation: he breaks all\nthe rules; but he gets there. If they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll only let him, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give them\nthe best show for their money they ever saw.\u00e2\u0080\u009d) A great argument began.\nHalf the people seemed to be on Pepito\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side and half on the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nside. At last the Doctor turned to Pepito and made another very grand\nbow which burst the last button off his waistcoat.\n\n[Illustration: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid acrobatics on the beast\u00e2\u0080\u0099s horns\u00e2\u0080\u009d]\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, of course if the caballero is afraid\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d he began with a bland\nsmile.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfraid!\u00e2\u0080\u009d screamed Pepito. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am afraid of nothing on earth. I am the\ngreatest matador in Spain. With this right hand I have killed nine\nhundred and fifty-seven bulls.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009clet us see if you can kill five\nmore. Let the bulls in!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he shouted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPepito de Malaga is not afraid.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA dreadful silence hung over the great theatre as the heavy door into\nthe bull pen was rolled back. Then with a roar the five big bulls\nbounded into the ring.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook fierce,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I heard the Doctor call to them in cattle language.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t scatter. Keep close. Get ready for a rush. Take Pepito, the one\nin purple, first. But for Heaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t kill him. Just chase him\nout of the ring\u00e2\u0080\u0094Now then, all together, go for him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe bulls put down their heads and all in line, like a squadron of\ncavalry, charged across the ring straight for poor Pepito.\n\nFor one moment the Spaniard tried his hardest to look brave. But the\nsight of the five pairs of horns coming at him at full gallop was too\nmuch. He turned white to the lips, ran for the fence, vaulted it and\ndisappeared.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow the other one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Doctor hissed. And in two seconds the gallant\nassistant was nowhere to be seen. Juan Hagapoco, the fat matador, was\nleft alone in the ring with five rampaging bulls.\n\nThe rest of the show was really well worth seeing. First, all five\nbulls went raging round the ring, butting at the fence with their\nhorns, pawing up the sand, hunting for something to kill. Then each one\nin turn would pretend to catch sight of the Doctor for the first time\nand giving a bellow of rage, would lower his wicked looking horns and\nshoot like an arrow across the ring as though he meant to toss him to\nthe sky.\n\nIt was really frightfully exciting. And even I, who knew it was all\narranged beforehand, held my breath in terror for the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life\nwhen I saw how near they came to sticking him. But just at the last\nmoment, when the horns\u00e2\u0080\u0099 points were two inches from the sky-blue\nwaistcoat, the Doctor would spring nimbly to one side and the great\nbrutes would go thundering harmlessly by, missing him by no more than a\nhair.\n\nThen all five of them went for him together, completely surrounding\nhim, slashing at him with their horns and bellowing with fury. How he\nescaped alive I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know. For several minutes his round figure could\nhardly be seen at all in that scrimmage of tossing heads, stamping\nhoofs and waving tails.\u00e2\u0080\u0094It was, as Polynesia had prophesied, the\ngreatest bullfight ever seen.\n\nOne woman in the crowd got quite hysterical and screamed up to Don\nEnrique,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStop the fight! Stop the fight! He is too brave a man to be killed.\nThis is the most wonderful matador in the world. Let him live! Stop the\nfight!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut presently the Doctor was seen to break loose from the mob of\nanimals that surrounded him. Then catching each of them by the horns,\none after another, he would give their heads a sudden twist and throw\nthem down flat on the sand. The great fellows acted their parts\nextremely well. I have never seen trained animals in a circus do\nbetter. They lay there panting on the ground where the Doctor threw\nthem as if they were exhausted and completely beaten.\n\nThen with a final bow to the ladies John Dolittle took a cigar from his\npocket, lit it and strolled out of the ring.\n\n\n\n\n_THE NINTH CHAPTER_\n\nWE DEPART IN A HURRY\n\n\nAS soon as the door closed behind the Doctor the most tremendous noise\nI have ever heard broke loose. Some of the men appeared to be angry\n(friends of Pepito\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, I suppose); but the ladies called and called to\nhave the Doctor come back into the ring.\n\nWhen at length he did so, the women seemed to go entirely mad over him.\nThey blew kisses to him. They called him a darling. Then they started\ntaking off their flowers, their rings, their necklaces, and their\nbrooches and threw them down at his feet. You never saw anything like\nit\u00e2\u0080\u0094a perfect shower of jewelry and roses.\n\nBut the Doctor just smiled up at them, bowed once more and backed out.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, Bumpo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polynesia, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is where you go down and gather up\nall those trinkets and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll sell \u00e2\u0080\u0099em. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what the big matadors\ndo: leave the jewelry on the ground and their assistants collect\nit for them. We might as well lay in a good supply of money while\nwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got the chance\u00e2\u0080\u0094you never know when you may need it when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re\ntraveling with the Doctor. Never mind the roses\u00e2\u0080\u0094you can leave them\u00e2\u0080\u0094but\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t leave any rings. And when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve finished go and get your\nthree-thousand pesetas out of Don Ricky-ticky. Tommy and I will meet\nyou outside and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll pawn the gew-gaws at that Jew\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shop opposite the\nbed-maker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. Run along\u00e2\u0080\u0094and not a word to the Doctor, remember.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOutside the bull-ring we found the crowd still in a great state of\nexcitement. Violent arguments were going on everywhere. Bumpo joined\nus with his pockets bulging in all directions; and we made our way\nslowly through the dense crowd to that side of the building where the\nmatadors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 dressing-room was. The Doctor was waiting at the door for us.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood work, Doctor!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polynesia, flying on to his shoulder\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cGreat\nwork!\u00e2\u0080\u0094But listen: I smell danger. I think you had better get back to\nthe ship now as quick and as quietly as you can. Put your overcoat on\nover that giddy suit. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like the looks of this crowd. More than\nhalf of them are furious because you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve won. Don Ricky-ticky must now\nstop the bullfighting\u00e2\u0080\u0094and you know how they love it. What I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid of\nis that some of these matadors who are just mad with jealousy may start\nsome dirty work. I think this would be a good time for us to get away.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI dare say you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re right, Polynesia,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou usually are.\nThe crowd does seem to be a bit restless. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll slip down to the ship\nalone\u00e2\u0080\u0094so I shan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be so noticeable; and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll wait for you there. You\ncome by some different way. But don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be long about it. Hurry!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs soon as the Doctor had departed Bumpo sought out Don Enrique and\nsaid,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHonorable Sir, you owe me three-thousand pesetas.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWithout a word, but looking cross-eyed with annoyance, Don Enrique paid\nhis bet.\n\nWe next set out to buy the provisions; and on the way we hired a cab\nand took it along with us.\n\nNot very far away we found a big grocer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shop which seemed to sell\neverything to eat. We went in and bought up the finest lot of food you\never saw in your life.\n\nAs a matter of fact, Polynesia had been right about the danger we were\nin. The news of our victory must have spread like lightning through the\nwhole town. For as we came out of the shop and loaded the cab up with\nour stores, we saw various little knots of angry men hunting round the\nstreets, waving sticks and shouting,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Englishmen! Where are those accursed Englishmen who stopped the\nbullfighting?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Hang them to a lamp-post!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Throw them in the sea! The\nEnglishmen!\u00e2\u0080\u0094We want the Englishmen!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAfter that we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t waste any time, you may be sure. Bumpo grabbed the\nSpanish cab-driver and explained to him in signs that if he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\ndrive down to the harbor as fast as he knew how and keep his mouth shut\nthe whole way, he would choke the life out of him. Then we jumped into\nthe cab on top of the food, slammed the door, pulled down the blinds\nand away we went.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get a chance to pawn the jewelry now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polynesia, as we\nbumped over the cobbly streets. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut never mind\u00e2\u0080\u0094it may come in handy\nlater on. And anyway we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got two-thousand five-hundred pesetas left\nout of the bet. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give the cabby more than two pesetas fifty,\nBumpo. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the right fare, I know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWell, we reached the harbor all right and we were mighty glad to find\nthat the Doctor had sent Chee-Chee back with the row-boat to wait for\nus at the landing-wall.\n\nUnfortunately while we were in the middle of loading the supplies from\nthe cab into the boat, the angry mob arrived upon the wharf and made\na rush for us. Bumpo snatched up a big beam of wood that lay near\nand swung it round and round his head, letting out dreadful African\nbattle-yells the while. This kept the crowd off while Chee-Chee and\nI hustled the last of the stores into the boat and clambered in\nourselves. Bumpo threw his beam of wood into the thick of the Spaniards\nand leapt in after us. Then we pushed off and rowed like mad for the\n_Curlew_.\n\nThe mob upon the wall howled with rage, shook their fists and hurled\nstones and all manner of things after us. Poor old Bumpo got hit on the\nhead with a bottle. But as he had a very strong head it only raised a\nsmall bump while the bottle smashed into a thousand pieces.\n\nWhen we reached the ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side the Doctor had the anchor drawn up and\nthe sails set and everything in readiness to get away. Looking back we\nsaw boats coming out from the harbor-wall after us, filled with angry,\nshouting men. So we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother to unload our rowboat but just tied\nit on to the ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stern with a rope and jumped aboard.\n\nIt only took a moment more to swing the _Curlew_ round into the wind;\nand soon we were speeding out of the harbor on our way to Brazil.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHa!\u00e2\u0080\u009d sighed Polynesia, as we all flopped down on the deck to take a\nrest and get our breath. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a bad adventure\u00e2\u0080\u0094quite reminds\nme of my old seafaring days when I sailed with the smugglers\u00e2\u0080\u0094Golly,\nthat was the life!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Never mind your head, Bumpo. It will be all right\nwhen the Doctor puts a little arnica on it. Think what we got out of\nthe scrap: a boat-load of ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stores, pockets full of jewelry and\nthousands of pesetas. Not bad, you know\u00e2\u0080\u0094not bad.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nPART FOUR\n\n\n\n\n_THE FIRST CHAPTER_\n\nSHELLFISH LANGUAGES AGAIN\n\n\nMIRANDA, the Purple Bird-of-Paradise had prophesied rightly when she\nhad foretold a good spell of weather. For three weeks the good ship\n_Curlew_ plowed her way through smiling seas before a steady powerful\nwind.\n\nI suppose most real sailors would have found this part of the voyage\ndull. But not I. As we got further South and further West the face\nof the sea seemed different every day. And all the little things of\na voyage which an old hand would have hardly bothered to notice were\nmatters of great interest for my eager eyes.\n\nWe did not pass many ships. When we did see one, the Doctor would get\nout his telescope and we would all take a look at it. Sometimes he\nwould signal to it, asking for news, by hauling up little colored flags\nupon the mast; and the ship would signal back to us in the same way.\nThe meaning of all the signals was printed in a book which the Doctor\nkept in the cabin. He told me it was the language of the sea and that\nall ships could understand it whether they be English, Dutch, or\nFrench.\n\nOur greatest happening during those first weeks was passing an iceberg.\nWhen the sun shone on it it burst into a hundred colors, sparkling\nlike a jeweled palace in a fairy-story. Through the telescope we saw\na mother polar bear with a cub sitting on it, watching us. The Doctor\nrecognized her as one of the bears who had spoken to him when he was\ndiscovering the North Pole. So he sailed the ship up close and offered\nto take her and her baby on to the _Curlew_ if she wished it. But she\nonly shook her head, thanking him; she said it would be far too hot for\nthe cub on the deck of our ship, with no ice to keep his feet cool. It\nhad been indeed a very hot day; but the nearness of that great mountain\nof ice made us all turn up our coat-collars and shiver with the cold.\n\nDuring those quiet peaceful days I improved my reading and writing a\ngreat deal with the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s help. I got on so well that he let me keep\nthe ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s log. This is a big book kept on every ship, a kind of diary,\nin which the number of miles run, the direction of your course and\neverything else that happens is written down.\n\nThe Doctor too, in what spare time he had, was nearly always writing\u00e2\u0080\u0094in\nhis note-books. I used to peep into these sometimes, now that I could\nread, but I found it hard work to make out the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s handwriting.\nMany of these note-books seemed to be about sea things. There were six\nthick ones filled full with notes and sketches of different seaweeds;\nand there were others on sea birds; others on sea worms; others on\nseashells. They were all some day to be re-written, printed and bound\nlike regular books.\n\nOne afternoon we saw, floating around us, great quantities of stuff\nthat looked like dead grass. The Doctor told me this was gulf-weed. A\nlittle further on it became so thick that it covered all the water as\nfar as the eye could reach; it made the _Curlew_ look as though she\nwere moving across a meadow instead of sailing the Atlantic.\n\nCrawling about upon this weed, many crabs were to be seen. And the\nsight of them reminded the Doctor of his dream of learning the language\nof the shellfish. He fished several of these crabs up with a net and\nput them in his listening-tank to see if he could understand them.\nAmong the crabs he also caught a strange-looking, chubby, little fish\nwhich he told me was called a Silver Fidgit.\n\nAfter he had listened to the crabs for a while with no success, he put\nthe fidgit into the tank and began to listen to that. I had to leave\nhim at this moment to go and attend to some duties on the deck. But\npresently I heard him below shouting for me to come down again.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStubbins,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried as soon as he saw me\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009ca most extraordinary\nthing\u00e2\u0080\u0094Quite unbelievable\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure whether I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m dreaming\u00e2\u0080\u0094Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nbelieve my own senses.

But they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re\nEnglish words, unless there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something very wrong with my hearing\u00e2\u0080\u0094And\nthe tune he whistles, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as plain as anything\u00e2\u0080\u0094always the same tune.\nNow you listen and tell me what you make of it. Tell me everything you\nhear. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss a word.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI went to the glass tank upon the table while the Doctor grabbed a\nnote-book and a pencil. Undoing my collar I stood upon the empty\npacking-case he had been using for a stand and put my right ear down\nunder the water.\n\nFor some moments I detected nothing at all\u00e2\u0080\u0094except, with my dry ear, the\nheavy breathing of the Doctor as he waited, all stiff and anxious, for\nme to say something. At last from within the water, sounding like a\nchild singing miles and miles away, I heard an unbelievably thin, small\nvoice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the Doctor in a hoarse, trembly whisper. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat does\nhe say?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite make it out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mostly in some strange fish\nlanguage\u00e2\u0080\u0094Oh, but wait a minute!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Yes, now I get it\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0098No smoking\u00e2\u0080\u0099.... \u00e2\u0080\u0098My,\nhere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a queer one!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Popcorn and picture postcards here\u00e2\u0080\u0099.... \u00e2\u0080\u0098This\nway out\u00e2\u0080\u0099.... \u00e2\u0080\u0098Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spit\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0094What funny things to say, Doctor!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Oh, but\nwait!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Now he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s whistling the tune.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat tune is it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d gasped the Doctor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJohn Peel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh hah,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I made it out to be.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he\nwrote furiously in his note-book.\n\nI went on listening.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is most extraordinary,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Doctor kept muttering to himself\nas his pencil went wiggling over the page\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cMost extraordinary\u00e2\u0080\u0094but\nfrightfully thrilling.

Now he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talking fish-talk again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe big tank!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Doctor murmured frowning in a puzzled kind of way.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wonder where on earth he learned\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen he bounded up out of his chair.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he yelled, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis fish has escaped from an aquarium.\nWhy, of course! Look at the kind of things he has learned: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Picture\npostcards\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0094they always sell them in aquariums; \u00e2\u0080\u0098Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spit\u00e2\u0080\u0099; \u00e2\u0080\u0098No\nsmoking\u00e2\u0080\u0099; \u00e2\u0080\u0098This way out\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0094the things the attendants say.

There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no doubt about\nit, Stubbins: we have here a fish who has escaped from captivity. And\nit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite possible\u00e2\u0080\u0094not certain, by any means, but quite possible\u00e2\u0080\u0094that\nI may now, through him, be able to establish communication with the\nshellfish. This is a great piece of luck.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n_THE SECOND CHAPTER_\n\nTHE FIDGIT\u00e2\u0080\u0099S STORY\n\n\nWELL, now that he was started once more upon his old hobby of the\nshellfish languages, there was no stopping the Doctor. He worked right\nthrough the night.\n\nA little after midnight I fell asleep in a chair; about two in the\nmorning Bumpo fell asleep at the wheel; and for five hours the _Curlew_\nwas allowed to drift where she liked. But still John Dolittle worked\non, trying his hardest to understand the fidgit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s language, struggling\nto make the fidgit understand him.\n\nWhen I woke up it was broad daylight again. The Doctor was still\nstanding at the listening-tank, looking as tired as an owl and\ndreadfully wet. But on his face there was a proud and happy smile.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStubbins,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said as soon as he saw me stir, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done it. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve\ngot the key to the fidgit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s language. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a frightfully difficult\nlanguage\u00e2\u0080\u0094quite different from anything I ever heard. The only thing it\nreminds me of\u00e2\u0080\u0094slightly\u00e2\u0080\u0094is ancient Hebrew. It isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shellfish; but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\na big step towards it. Now, the next thing, I want you to take a pencil\nand a fresh notebook and write down everything I say. The fidgit has\npromised to tell me the story of his life. I will translate it into\nEnglish and you put it down in the book. Are you ready?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOnce more the Doctor lowered his ear beneath the level of the water;\nand as he began to speak, I started to write. And this is the story\nthat the fidgit told us.\n\n\n    THIRTEEN MONTHS IN AN AQUARIUM\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was born in the Pacific Ocean, close to the coast\n    of Chile. I was one of a family of two-thousand\n    five-hundred and ten. Soon after our mother and father\n    left us, we youngsters got scattered. The family was\n    broken up\u00e2\u0080\u0094by a herd of whales who chased us. I and\n    my sister, Clippa (she was my favorite sister) had a\n    very narrow escape for our lives. As a rule, whales\n    are not very hard to get away from if you are good at\n    dodging\u00e2\u0080\u0094if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve only got a quick swerve. But this\n    one that came after Clippa and myself was a very mean\n    whale. Every time he lost us under a stone or something\n    he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d come back and hunt and hunt till he routed us\n    out into the open again. I never saw such a nasty,\n    persevering brute.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, we shook him at last\u00e2\u0080\u0094though not before he had\n    worried us for hundreds of miles northward, up the\n    west coast of South America. But luck was against us\n    that day. While we were resting and trying to get our\n    breath, another family of fidgits came rushing by,\n    shouting, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Come on! Swim for your lives! The dog-fish\n    are coming!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow dog-fish are particularly fond of fidgits. We are,\n    you might say, their favorite food\u00e2\u0080\u0094and for that reason\n    we always keep away from deep, muddy waters. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\n    more, dog-fish are not easy to escape from; they are\n    terribly fast and clever hunters. So up we had to jump\n    and on again.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter we had gone a few more hundred miles we looked\n    back and saw that the dog-fish were gaining on us. So\n    we turned into a harbor. It happened to be one on the\n    west coast of the United States. Here we guessed, and\n    hoped, the dog-fish would not be likely to follow us.\n    As it happened, they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even see us turn in, but\n    dashed on northward and we never saw them again. I hope\n    they froze to death in the Arctic Seas.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, as I said, luck was against us that day. While\n    I and my sister were cruising gently round the ships\n    anchored in the harbor looking for orange-peels, a\n    great delicacy with us\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Swoop! Bang!_\u00e2\u0080\u0094we were caught in\n    a net.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe struggled for all we were worth; but it was no use.\n    The net was small-meshed and strongly made. Kicking\n    and flipping we were hauled up the side of the ship\n    and dumped down on the deck, high and dry in a blazing\n    noon-day sun.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere a couple of old men in whiskers and spectacles\n    leant over us, making strange sounds. Some codling had\n    got caught in the net the same time as we were. These\n    the old men threw back into the sea; but us they seemed\n    to think very precious. They put us carefully into a\n    large jar and after they had taken us on shore they\n    went to a big house and changed us from the jar into\n    glass boxes full of water. This house was on the edge\n    of the harbor; and a small stream of sea-water was made\n    to flow through the glass tank so we could breathe\n    properly. Of course we had never lived inside glass\n    walls before; and at first we kept on trying to swim\n    through them and got our noses awfully sore bumping the\n    glass at full speed.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen followed weeks and weeks of weary idleness. They\n    treated us well, so far as they knew how. The old\n    fellows in spectacles came and looked at us proudly\n    twice a day and saw that we had the proper food to eat,\n    the right amount of light and that the water was not\n    too hot or too cold. But oh, the dullness of that life!\n    It seemed we were a kind of a show. At a certain hour\n    every morning the big doors of the house were thrown\n    open and everybody in the city who had nothing special\n    to do came in and looked at us. There were other tanks\n    filled with different kinds of fishes all round the\n    walls of the big room. And the crowds would go from\n    tank to tank, looking in at us through the glass\u00e2\u0080\u0094with\n    their mouths open, like half-witted flounders. We got\n    so sick of it that we used to open our mouths back at\n    them; and this they seemed to think highly comical.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne day my sister said to me, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Think you, Brother,\n    that these strange creatures who have captured us can\n    talk?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Surely,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said I, \u00e2\u0080\u0098have you not noticed that some talk\n    with the lips only, some with the whole face, and yet\n    others discourse with the hands? When they come quite\n    close to the glass you can hear them. Listen!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt that moment a female, larger than the rest, pressed\n    her nose up against the glass, pointed at me and said\n    to her young behind her, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, look, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a queer one!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd then we noticed that they nearly always said this\n    when they looked in. And for a long time we thought\n    that such was the whole extent of the language, this\n    being a people of but few ideas. To help pass away the\n    weary hours we learned it by heart, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, look, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\n    a queer one!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 But we never got to know what it meant.\n    Other phrases, however, we did get the meaning of; and\n    we even learned to read a little in man-talk. Many big\n    signs there were, set up upon the walls; and when we\n    saw that the keepers stopped the people from spitting\n    and smoking, pointed to these signs angrily and read\n    them out loud, we knew then that these writings\n    signified, _No Smoking_ and _Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Spit_.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen in the evenings, after the crowd had gone, the\n    same aged male with one leg of wood, swept up the\n    peanut-shells with a broom every night. And while\n    he was so doing he always whistled the same tune to\n    himself. This melody we rather liked; and we learned\n    that too by heart\u00e2\u0080\u0094thinking it was part of the language.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cThus a whole year went by in this dismal place. Some\n    days new fishes were brought in to the other tanks;\n    and other days old fishes were taken out. At first we\n    had hoped we would only be kept here for a while, and\n    that after we had been looked at sufficiently we would\n    be returned to freedom and the sea. But as month after\n    month went by, and we were left undisturbed, our hearts\n    grew heavy within our prison-walls of glass and we\n    spoke to one another less and less.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne day, when the crowd was thickest in the big room,\n    a woman with a red face fainted from the heat. I\n    watched through the glass and saw that the rest of the\n    people got highly excited\u00e2\u0080\u0094though to me it did not seem\n    to be a matter of very great importance. They threw\n    cold water on her and carried her out into the open air.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis made me think mightily; and presently a great\n    idea burst upon me.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Sister,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I said, turning to poor Clippa who was\n    sulking at the bottom of our prison trying to hide\n    behind a stone from the stupid gaze of the children who\n    thronged about our tank, \u00e2\u0080\u0098supposing that _we_ pretended\n    we were sick: do you think they would take us also from\n    this stuffy house?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Brother,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said she wearily, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that they might do. But\n    most likely they would throw us on a rubbish-heap,\n    where we would die in the hot sun.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098But,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said I, \u00e2\u0080\u0098why should they go abroad to seek\n    a rubbish-heap, when the harbor is so close? While\n    we were being brought here I saw men throwing their\n    rubbish into the water. If they would only throw us\n    also there, we could quickly reach the sea.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098The Sea!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 murmured poor Clippa with a far-away look\n    in her eyes (she had fine eyes, had my sister, Clippa).\n    \u00e2\u0080\u0098How like a dream it sounds\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Sea! Oh brother, will\n    we ever swim in it again, think you? Every night as I\n    lie awake on the floor of this evil-smelling dungeon I\n    hear its hearty voice ringing in my ears. How I have\n    longed for it! Just to feel it once again, the nice,\n    big, wholesome homeliness of it all! To jump, just to\n    jump from the crest of an Atlantic wave, laughing in\n    the trade wind\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spindrift, down into the blue-green\n    swirling trough! To chase the shrimps on a summer\n    evening, when the sky is red and the light\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all pink\n    within the foam! To lie on the top, in the doldrums\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n    noonday calm, and warm your tummy in the tropic sun!\n    To wander hand in hand once more through the giant\n    seaweed forests of the Indian Ocean, seeking the\n    delicious eggs of the pop-pop! To play hide-and-seek\n    among the castles of the coral towns with their pearl\n    and jasper windows spangling the floor of the Spanish\n    Main! To picnic in the anemone-meadows, dim blue\n    and lilac-gray, that lie in the lowlands beyond the\n    South Sea Garden! To throw somersaults on the springy\n    sponge-beds of the Mexican Gulf! To poke about among\n    the dead ships and see what wonders and adventures lie\n    inside!\u00e2\u0080\u0094And then, on winter nights when the Northeaster\n    whips the water into froth, to swoop down and down to\n    get away from the cold, down to where the water\u00e2\u0080\u0099s warm\n    and dark, down and still down, till we spy the twinkle\n    of the fire-eels far below where our friends and\n    cousins sit chatting round the Council Grotto\u00e2\u0080\u0094chatting,\n    Brother, over the news and gossip of _the Sea_!... Oh\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd then she broke down completely, sniffling.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Stop it!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I said. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You make me homesick. Look here:\n    let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretend we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sick\u00e2\u0080\u0094or better still, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretend\n    we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re dead; and see what happens. If they throw us on a\n    rubbish-heap and we fry in the sun, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll not be much\n    worse off than we are here in this smelly prison. What\n    do you say? Will you risk it?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098I will,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0098and gladly.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo next morning two fidgits were found by the keeper\n    floating on the top of the water in their tank, stiff\n    and dead. We gave a mighty good imitation of dead\n    fish\u00e2\u0080\u0094although I say it myself. The keeper ran and\n    got the old gentlemen with spectacles and whiskers.\n    They threw up their hands in horror when they saw us.\n    Lifting us carefully out of the water they laid us on\n    wet cloths. That was the hardest part of all. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re\n    a fish and get taken out of the water you have to keep\n    opening and shutting your mouth to breathe at all\u00e2\u0080\u0094and\n    even that you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t keep up for long. And all this time\n    we had to stay stiff as sticks and breathe silently\n    through half-closed lips.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, the old fellows poked us and felt us and pinched\n    us till I thought they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never be done. Then, when\n    their backs were turned a moment, a wretched cat got\n    up on the table and nearly ate us. Luckily the old\n    men turned round in time and shooed her away. You may\n    be sure though that we took a couple of good gulps\n    of air while they weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t looking; and that was the\n    only thing that saved us from choking. I wanted to\n    whisper to Clippa to be brave and stick it out. But I\n    couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even do that; because, as you know, most kinds\n    of fish-talk cannot be heard\u00e2\u0080\u0094not even a shout\u00e2\u0080\u0094unless\n    you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re under water.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen, just as we were about to give it up and let on\n    that we were alive, one of the old men shook his head\n    sadly, lifted us up and carried us out of the building.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Now for it!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I thought to myself. \u00e2\u0080\u0098We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll soon know\n    our fate: liberty or the garbage-can.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cOutside, to our unspeakable horror, he made straight\n    for a large ash-barrel which stood against the wall on\n    the other side of a yard. Most happily for us, however,\n    while he was crossing this yard a very dirty man with a\n    wagon and horses drove up and took the ash-barrel away.\n    I suppose it was his property.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen the old man looked around for some other place to\n    throw us. He seemed about to cast us upon the ground.\n    But he evidently thought that this would make the yard\n    untidy and he desisted. The suspense was terrible. He\n    moved outside the yard-gate and my heart sank once more\n    as I saw that he now intended to throw us in the gutter\n    of the roadway. But (fortune was indeed with us that\n    day), a large man in blue clothes and silver buttons\n    stopped him in the nick of time. Evidently, from the\n    way the large man lectured and waved a short thick\n    stick, it was against the rules of the town to throw\n    dead fish in the streets.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt last, to our unutterable joy, the old man turned\n    and moved off with us towards the harbor. He walked so\n    slowly, muttering to himself all the way and watching\n    the man in blue out of the corner of his eye, that I\n    wanted to bite his finger to make him hurry up. Both\n    Clippa and I were actually at our last gasp.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cFinally he reached the sea-wall and giving us one last\n    sad look he dropped us into the waters of the harbor.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cNever had we realized anything like the thrill of\n    that moment, as we felt the salt wetness close over\n    our heads. With one flick of our tails we came to life\n    again. The old man was so surprised that he fell right\n    into the water, almost on top of us. From this he was\n    rescued by a sailor with a boat-hook; and the last we\n    saw of him, the man in blue was dragging him away by\n    the coat-collar, lecturing him again. Apparently it was\n    also against the rules of the town to throw dead fish\n    into the harbor.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut we?\u00e2\u0080\u0094What time or thought had we for his troubles?\n    _We were free!_ In lightning leaps, in curving spurts,\n    in crazy zig-zags\u00e2\u0080\u0094whooping, shrieking with delight, we\n    sped for home and the open sea!\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is all of my story and I will now, as I promised\n    last night, try to answer any questions you may ask\n    about the sea, on condition that I am set at liberty as\n    soon as you have done.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n    _The Doctor:_ \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs there any part of the sea deeper than\n    that known as the Nero Deep\u00e2\u0080\u0094I mean the one near the\n    Island of Guam?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n    _The Fidgit:_ \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, certainly. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one much deeper\n    than that near the mouth of the Amazon River. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\n    small and hard to find. We call it \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Deep Hole.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And\n    there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another in the Antarctic Sea.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n    _The Doctor:_ \u00e2\u0080\u009cCan you talk any shellfish language\n    yourself?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n    _The Fidgit:_ \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, not a word. We regular fishes don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\n    have anything to do with the shellfish. We consider\n    them a low class.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n    _The Doctor:_ \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re near them, can you hear\n    the sound they make talking\u00e2\u0080\u0094I mean without necessarily\n    understanding what they say?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n    _The Fidgit:_ \u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly with the very largest ones.\n    Shellfish have such weak small voices it is almost\n    impossible for any but their own kind to hear them. But\n    with the bigger ones it is different. They make a sad,\n    booming noise, rather like an iron pipe being knocked\n    with a stone\u00e2\u0080\u0094only not nearly so loud of course.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n    _The Doctor:_ \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am most anxious to get down to the\n    bottom of the sea\u00e2\u0080\u0094to study many things. But we land\n    animals, as you no doubt know, are unable to breathe\n    under water. Have you any ideas that might help me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n    _The Fidgit:_ \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think that for both your difficulties\n    the best thing for you to do would be to try and get\n    hold of the Great Glass Sea Snail.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n    _The Doctor:_ \u00e2\u0080\u009cEr\u00e2\u0080\u0094who, or what, is the Great Glass Sea\n    Snail?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n    _The Fidgit:_ \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is an enormous salt-water snail,\n    one of the winkle family, but as large as a big house.\n    He talks quite loudly\u00e2\u0080\u0094when he speaks, but this is not\n    often. He can go to any part of the ocean, at all\n    depths because he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to be afraid of any\n    creature in the sea. His shell is made of transparent\n    mother-o\u00e2\u0080\u0099-pearl so that you can see through it; but\n    it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thick and strong. When he is out of his shell\n    and he carries it empty on his back, there is room in\n    it for a wagon and a pair of horses. He has been seen\n    carrying his food in it when traveling.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n    _The Doctor:_ \u00e2\u0080\u009cI feel that that is just the creature\n    I have been looking for. He could take me and my\n    assistant inside his shell and we could explore the\n    deepest depths in safety. Do you think you could get\n    him for me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n    _The Fidgit:_ \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas! no. I would willingly if I could;\n    but he is hardly ever seen by ordinary fish. He lives\n    at the bottom of the Deep Hole, and seldom comes\n    out\u00e2\u0080\u0094And into the Deep Hole, the lower waters of which\n    are muddy, fishes such as we are afraid to go.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n    _The Doctor:_ \u00e2\u0080\u009cDear me! That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a terrible\n    disappointment. Are there many of this kind of snail in\n    the sea?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n    _The Fidgit:_ \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh no. He is the only one in existence,\n    since his second wife died long, long ago. He is the\n    last of the Giant Shellfish. He belongs to past ages\n    when the whales were land-animals and all that. They\n    say he is over seventy thousand years old.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n    _The Doctor:_ \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood Gracious, what wonderful things he\n    could tell me! I do wish I could meet him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n    _The Fidgit:_ \u00e2\u0080\u009cWere there any more questions you wished\n    to ask me? This water in your tank is getting quite\n    warm and sickly. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to be put back into the sea\n    as soon as you can spare me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n    _The Doctor:_ \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust one more thing: when Christopher\n    Columbus crossed the Atlantic in 1492, he threw\n    overboard two copies of his diary sealed up in barrels.\n    One of them was never found. It must have sunk. I would\n    like to get it for my library. Do you happen to know\n    where it is?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n    _The Fidgit:_ \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I do. That too is in the Deep Hole.\n    When the barrel sank the currents drifted it northwards\n    down what we call the Orinoco Slope, till it finally\n    disappeared into the Deep Hole. If it was any other\n    part of the sea I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d try and get it for you; but not\n    there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n    _The Doctor:_ \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, that is all, I think. I hate to\n    put you back into the sea, because I know that as soon\n    as I do, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll think of a hundred other questions I\n    wanted to ask you. But I must keep my promise. Would\n    you care for anything before you go?\u00e2\u0080\u0094it seems a cold\n    day\u00e2\u0080\u0094some cracker-crumbs or something?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n    _The Fidgit:_ \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop. All I want just at\n    present is fresh sea-water.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n    _The Doctor:_ \u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot thank you enough for all the\n    information you have given me. You have been very\n    helpful and patient.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n    _The Fidgit:_ \u00e2\u0080\u009cPray do not mention it. It has been a\n    real pleasure to be of assistance to the great John\n    Dolittle. You are, as of course you know, already quite\n    famous among the better class of fishes. Goodbye!\u00e2\u0080\u0094and\n    good luck to you, to your ship and to all your plans!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Doctor carried the listening-tank to a port-hole, opened it and\nemptied the tank into the sea.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-bye!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he murmured as a faint splash reached us from without.\n\nI dropped my pencil on the table and leaned back with a sigh. My\nfingers were so stiff with writers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cramp that I felt as though I\nshould never be able to open my hand again. But I, at least, had had\na night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sleep. As for the poor Doctor, he was so weary that he had\nhardly put the tank back upon the table and dropped into a chair, when\nhis eyes closed and he began to snore.\n\nIn the passage outside Polynesia scratched angrily at the door. I rose\nand let her in.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA nice state of affairs!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she stormed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat sort of a ship is this?\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that colored man upstairs asleep under the wheel; the Doctor\nasleep down here; and you making pot-hooks in a copybook with a\npencil! Expect the ship to steer herself to Brazil? We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just drifting\naround the sea like an empty bottle\u00e2\u0080\u0094and a week behind time as it is.\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happened to you all?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe was so angry that her voice rose to a scream. But it would have\ntaken more than that to wake the Doctor.\n\nI put the note-book carefully in a drawer and went on deck to take the\nwheel.\n\n\n\n\n_THE THIRD CHAPTER_\n\nBAD WEATHER\n\n\nAS soon as I had the _Curlew_ swung round upon her course again I\nnoticed something peculiar: we were not going as fast as we had been.\nOur favorable wind had almost entirely disappeared.\n\nThis, at first, we did not worry about, thinking that at any moment it\nmight spring up again. But the whole day went by; then two days; then\na week,\u00e2\u0080\u0094ten days, and the wind grew no stronger. The _Curlew_ just\ndawdled along at the speed of a toddling babe.\n\nI now saw that the Doctor was becoming uneasy. He kept getting out his\nsextant (an instrument which tells you what part of the ocean you are\nin) and making calculations. He was forever looking at his maps and\nmeasuring distances on them. The far edge of the sea, all around us, he\nexamined with his telescope a hundred times a day.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut Doctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said when I found him one afternoon mumbling to himself\nabout the misty appearance of the sky, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter so much,\nwould it, if we did take a little longer over the trip? We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got\nplenty to eat on board now; and the Purple Bird-of-Paradise will know\nthat we have been delayed by something that we couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I suppose so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said thoughtfully. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I hate to keep her\nwaiting. At this season of the year she generally goes to the Peruvian\nmountains\u00e2\u0080\u0094for her health. And besides, the good weather she prophesied\nis likely to end any day now and delay us still further. If we could\nonly keep moving at even a fair speed, I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this\nhanging around, almost dead still, that gets me restless\u00e2\u0080\u0094Ah, here comes\na wind\u00e2\u0080\u0094Not very strong\u00e2\u0080\u0094but maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll grow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA gentle breeze from the Northeast came singing through the ropes; and\nwe smiled up hopefully at the _Curlew\u00e2\u0080\u0099s_ leaning masts.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve only got another hundred and fifty miles to make, to sight the\ncoast of Brazil,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf that wind would just stay with\nus, steady, for a full day we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d see land.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut suddenly the wind changed, swung to the East, then back to the\nNortheast\u00e2\u0080\u0094then to the North. It came in fitful gusts, as though it\nhadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t made up its mind which way to blow; and I was kept busy at the\nwheel, swinging the _Curlew_ this way and that to keep the right side\nof it.\n\nPresently we heard Polynesia, who was in the rigging keeping a look-out\nfor land or passing ships, screech down to us,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBad weather coming. That jumpy wind is an ugly sign. And look!\u00e2\u0080\u0094over\nthere in the East\u00e2\u0080\u0094see that black line, low down? If that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a\nstorm I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a land-lubber. The gales round here are fierce, when they\ndo blow\u00e2\u0080\u0094tear your canvas out like paper. You take the wheel, Doctor:\nit\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need a strong arm if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a real storm. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go wake Bumpo and\nChee-Chee. This looks bad to me. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099d best get all the sail down right\naway, till we see how strong she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to blow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIndeed the whole sky was now beginning to take on a very threatening\nlook. The black line to the eastward grew blacker as it came nearer\nand nearer. A low, rumbly, whispering noise went moaning over the sea.\nThe water which had been so blue and smiling turned to a ruffled ugly\ngray. And across the darkening sky, shreds of cloud swept like tattered\nwitches flying from the storm.\n\nI must confess I was frightened. You see I had only so far seen the\nsea in friendly moods: sometimes quiet and lazy; sometimes laughing,\nventuresome and reckless; sometimes brooding and poetic, when moonbeams\nturned her ripples into silver threads and dreaming snowy night-clouds\npiled up fairy-castles in the sky. But as yet I had not known, or even\nguessed at, the terrible strength of the Sea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wild anger.\n\nWhen that storm finally struck us we leaned right over flatly on our\nside, as though some invisible giant had slapped the poor _Curlew_ on\nthe cheek.\n\nAfter that things happened so thick and so fast that what with the wind\nthat stopped your breath, the driving, blinding water, the deafening\nnoise and the rest, I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a very clear idea of how our shipwreck\ncame about.\n\nI remember seeing the sails, which we were now trying to roll up upon\nthe deck, torn out of our hands by the wind and go overboard like a\npenny balloon\u00e2\u0080\u0094very nearly carrying Chee-Chee with them. And I have a\ndim recollection of Polynesia screeching somewhere for one of us to go\ndownstairs and close the port-holes.\n\nIn spite of our masts being bare of sail we were now scudding along\nto the southward at a great pace. But every once in a while huge\ngray-black waves would arise from under the ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side like nightmare\nmonsters, swell and climb, then crash down upon us, pressing us into\nthe sea; and the poor _Curlew_ would come to a standstill, half under\nwater, like a gasping, drowning pig.\n\nWhile I was clambering along towards the wheel to see the Doctor,\nclinging like a leech with hands and legs to the rails lest I be blown\noverboard, one of these tremendous seas tore loose my hold, filled my\nthroat with water and swept me like a cork the full length of the deck.\nMy head struck a door with an awful bang. And then I fainted.\n\n\n\n\n_THE FOURTH CHAPTER_\n\nWRECKED!\n\n\nWHEN I awoke I was very hazy in my head. The sky was blue and the sea\nwas calm. At first I thought that I must have fallen asleep in the sun\non the deck of the _Curlew_. And thinking that I would be late for my\nturn at the wheel, I tried to rise to my feet. I found I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t; my\narms were tied to something behind me with a piece of rope. By twisting\nmy neck around I found this to be a mast, broken off short. Then I\nrealized that I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sitting on a ship at all; I was only sitting on\na piece of one. I began to feel uncomfortably scared. Screwing up my\neyes, I searched the rim of the sea North, East, South and West: no\nland: no ships; nothing was in sight. I was alone in the ocean!\n\nAt last, little by little, my bruised head began to remember what had\nhappened: first, the coming of the storm; the sails going overboard;\nthen the big wave which had banged me against the door. But what had\nbecome of the Doctor and the others? What day was this, to-morrow or\nthe day after?\u00e2\u0080\u0094And why was I sitting on only part of a ship?\n\n[Illustration: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was alone in the ocean!\u00e2\u0080\u009d]\n\nWorking my hand into my pocket, I found my penknife and cut the rope\nthat tied me. This reminded me of a shipwreck story which Joe had once\ntold me, of a captain who had tied his son to a mast in order that he\nshouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be washed overboard by the gale. So of course it must have\nbeen the Doctor who had done the same to me.\n\nBut where was he?\n\nThe awful thought came to me that the Doctor and the rest of\nthem must be drowned, since there was no other wreckage to be\nseen upon the waters. I got to my feet and stared around the sea\nagain\u00e2\u0080\u0094Nothing\u00e2\u0080\u0094nothing but water and sky!\n\nPresently a long way off I saw the small dark shape of a bird skimming\nlow down over the swell. When it came quite close I saw it was a Stormy\nPetrel. I tried to talk to it, to see if it could give me news. But\nunluckily I hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t learned much seabird language and I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even\nattract its attention, much less make it understand what I wanted.\n\nTwice it circled round my raft, lazily, with hardly a flip of the\nwing. And I could not help wondering, in spite of the distress I was\nin, where it had spent last night\u00e2\u0080\u0094how it, or any other living thing,\nhad weathered such a smashing storm. It made me realize the great big\ndifference between different creatures; and that size and strength are\nnot everything. To this petrel, a frail little thing of feathers, much\nsmaller and weaker than I, the Sea could do anything she liked, it\nseemed; and his only answer was a lazy, saucy flip of the wing! _He_\nwas the one who should be called the _able seaman_. For, come raging\ngale, come sunlit calm, this wilderness of water was his home.\n\nAfter swooping over the sea around me (just looking for food, I\nsupposed) he went off in the direction from which he had come. And I\nwas alone once more.\n\nI found I was somewhat hungry\u00e2\u0080\u0094and a little thirsty too. I began to\nthink all sorts of miserable thoughts, the way one does when he is\nlonesome and has missed breakfast. What was going to become of me now,\nif the Doctor and the rest were drowned? I would starve to death or\ndie of thirst. Then the sun went behind some clouds and I felt cold.\nHow many hundreds or thousands of miles was I from any land? What if\nanother storm should come and smash up even this poor raft on which I\nstood?\n\nI went on like this for a while, growing gloomier and gloomier, when\nsuddenly I thought of Polynesia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re always safe with the Doctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nshe had said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe gets there. Remember that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have minded so much if he had been here with me. It\nwas this being all alone that made me want to weep. And yet the petrel\nwas alone!\u00e2\u0080\u0094What a baby I was, I told myself, to be scared to the verge\nof tears just by loneliness! I was quite safe where I was\u00e2\u0080\u0094for the\npresent anyhow. John Dolittle wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get scared by a little thing\nlike this. He only got excited when he made a discovery, found a new\nbug or something. And if what Polynesia had said was true, he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nbe drowned and things would come out all right in the end somehow.\n\nI threw out my chest, buttoned up my collar and began walking up and\ndown the short raft to keep warm. I would be like John Dolittle. I\nwouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cry\u00e2\u0080\u0094And I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get excited.\n\nHow long I paced back and forth I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know. But it was a long\ntime\u00e2\u0080\u0094for I had nothing else to do.\n\nAt last I got tired and lay down to rest. And in spite of all my\ntroubles, I soon fell fast asleep.\n\nThis time when I woke up, stars were staring down at me out of a\ncloudless sky. The sea was still calm; and my strange craft was rocking\ngently under me on an easy swell. All my fine courage left me as I\ngazed up into the big silent night and felt the pains of hunger and\nthirst set to work in my stomach harder than ever.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you awake?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a high silvery voice at my elbow.\n\nI sprang up as though some one had stuck a pin in me. And there,\nperched at the very end of my raft, her beautiful golden tail glowing\ndimly in the starlight, sat Miranda, the Purple Bird-of-Paradise!\n\nNever have I been so glad to see any one in my life. I almost fell into\nthe water as I leapt to hug her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to wake you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI guessed you must be tired\nafter all you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been through\u00e2\u0080\u0094Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t squash the life out of me, boy: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\nnot a stuffed duck, you know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Miranda, you dear old thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so glad to see you.\nTell me, where is the Doctor? Is he alive?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s alive\u00e2\u0080\u0094and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my firm belief he always will be. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nover there, about forty miles to the westward.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s he doing there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sitting on the other half of the _Curlew_ shaving himself\u00e2\u0080\u0094or he\nwas, when I left him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, thank Heaven he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s alive!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd Bumpo\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the animals, are\nthey all right?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re with him. Your ship broke in half in the storm. The\nDoctor had tied you down when he found you stunned. And the part you\nwere on got separated and floated away. Golly, it _was_ a storm! One\nhas to be a gull or an albatross to stand that sort of weather. I had\nbeen watching for the Doctor for three weeks, from a cliff-top; but\nlast night I had to take refuge in a cave to keep my tail-feathers from\nblowing out. As soon as I found the Doctor, he sent me off with some\nporpoises to help us in our search. There had been quite a gathering\nof sea-birds waiting to greet the Doctor; but the rough weather sort of\nbroke up the arrangements that had been made to welcome him properly.\nIt was the petrel that first gave us the tip where you were.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, but how can I get to the Doctor, Miranda?\u00e2\u0080\u0094I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any oars.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGet to him!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Why, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to him now. Look behind you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI turned around. The moon was just rising on the sea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s edge. And I now\nsaw that my raft was moving through the water, but so gently that I had\nnot noticed it before.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s moving us?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe porpoises,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Miranda.\n\nI went to the back of the raft and looked down into the water. And just\nbelow the surface I could see the dim forms of four big porpoises,\ntheir sleek skins glinting in the moonlight, pushing at the raft with\ntheir noses.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re old friends of the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Miranda. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099d do\nanything for John Dolittle. We should see his party soon now. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re\npretty near the place I left them\u00e2\u0080\u0094Yes, there they are! See that dark\nshape?\u00e2\u0080\u0094No, more to the right of where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking. Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you\nmake out the figure of the black man standing against the sky?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Now\nChee-Chee spies us\u00e2\u0080\u0094he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s waving. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see them?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\u00e2\u0080\u0094for my eyes were not as sharp as Miranda\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. But presently from\nsomewhere in the murky dusk I heard Bumpo singing his African comic\nsongs with the full force of his enormous voice. And in a little, by\npeering and peering in the direction of the sound, I at last made out a\ndim mass of tattered, splintered wreckage\u00e2\u0080\u0094all that remained of the poor\n_Curlew_\u00e2\u0080\u0094floating low down upon the water.\n\nA hulloa came through the night. And I answered it. We kept it up,\ncalling to one another back and forth across the calm night sea. And a\nfew minutes later the two halves of our brave little ruined ship bumped\ngently together again.\n\nNow that I was nearer and the moon was higher I could see more plainly.\nTheir half of the ship was much bigger than mine.\n\nIt lay partly upon its side; and most of them were perched upon the top\nmunching ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biscuit.\n\nBut close down to the edge of the water, using the sea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s calm surface\nfor a mirror and a piece of broken bottle for a razor, John Dolittle\nwas shaving his face by the light of the moon.\n\n\n\n\n_THE FIFTH CHAPTER_\n\nLAND!\n\n\nTHEY all gave me a great greeting as I clambered off my half of the\nship on to theirs. Bumpo brought me a wonderful drink of fresh water\nwhich he drew from a barrel; and Chee-Chee and Polynesia stood around\nme feeding me ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biscuit.\n\nBut it was the sight of the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smiling face\u00e2\u0080\u0094just knowing that I\nwas with him once again\u00e2\u0080\u0094that cheered me more than anything else. As I\nwatched him carefully wipe his glass razor and put it away for future\nuse, I could not help comparing him in my mind with the Stormy Petrel.\nIndeed the vast strange knowledge which he had gained from his speech\nand friendship with animals had brought him the power to do things\nwhich no other human being would dare to try. Like the petrel, he could\napparently play with the sea in all her moods. It was no wonder that\nmany of the ignorant savage peoples among whom he passed in his voyages\nmade statues of him showing him as half a fish, half a bird, and half\na man. And ridiculous though it was, I could quite understand what\nMiranda meant when she said she firmly believed that he could never\ndie. Just to be with him gave you a wonderful feeling of comfort and\nsafety.\n\nExcept for his appearance (his clothes were crumpled and damp and his\nbattered high hat was stained with salt water) that storm which had\nso terrified me had disturbed him no more than getting stuck on the\nmud-bank in Puddleby River.\n\nPolitely thanking Miranda for getting me so quickly, he asked her\nif she would now go ahead of us and show us the way to Spidermonkey\nIsland. Next, he gave orders to the porpoises to leave my old piece of\nthe ship and push the bigger half wherever the Bird-of-Paradise should\nlead us.\n\nHow much he had lost in the wreck besides his razor I did not\nknow\u00e2\u0080\u0094everything, most likely, together with all the money he had saved\nup to buy the ship with. And still he was smiling as though he wanted\nfor nothing in the world. The only things he had saved, as far as\nI could see\u00e2\u0080\u0094beyond the barrel of water and bag of biscuit\u00e2\u0080\u0094were his\nprecious note-books. These, I saw when he stood up, he had strapped\naround his waist with yards and yards of twine. He was, as old Matthew\nMugg used to say, a great man. He was unbelievable.\n\nAnd now for three days we continued our journey slowly but\nsteadily\u00e2\u0080\u0094southward.\n\nThe only inconvenience we suffered from was the cold. This seemed\nto increase as we went forward. The Doctor said that the island,\ndisturbed from its usual paths by the great gale, had evidently drifted\nfurther South than it had ever been before.\n\nOn the third night poor Miranda came back to us nearly frozen. She told\nthe Doctor that in the morning we would find the island quite close to\nus, though we couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see it now as it was a misty dark night. She\nsaid that she must hurry back at once to a warmer climate; and that she\nwould visit the Doctor in Puddleby next August as usual.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forget, Miranda,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said John Dolittle, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you should hear\nanything of what happened to Long Arrow, to get word to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Bird-of-Paradise assured him she would. And after the Doctor had\nthanked her again and again for all that she had done for us, she\nwished us good luck and disappeared into the night.\n\nWe were all awake early in the morning, long before it was light,\nwaiting for our first glimpse of the country we had come so far to see.\nAnd as the rising sun turned the eastern sky to gray, of course it\nwas old Polynesia who first shouted that she could see palm-trees and\nmountain tops.\n\nWith the growing light it became plain to all of us: a long island with\nhigh rocky mountains in the middle\u00e2\u0080\u0094and so near to us that you could\nalmost throw your hat upon the shore.\n\nThe porpoises gave us one last push and our strange-looking craft\nbumped gently on a low beach. Then, thanking our lucky stars for\na chance to stretch our cramped legs, we all bundled off on to the\nland\u00e2\u0080\u0094the first land, even though it was floating land, that we had\ntrodden for six weeks. What a thrill I felt as I realized that\nSpidermonkey Island, the little spot in the atlas which my pencil had\ntouched, lay at last beneath my feet!\n\nWhen the light increased still further we noticed that the palms and\ngrasses of the island seemed withered and almost dead. The Doctor\nsaid that it must be on account of the cold that the island was now\nsuffering from in its new climate. These trees and grasses, he told us,\nwere the kind that belonged to warm, tropical weather.\n\nThe porpoises asked if we wanted them any further. And the Doctor said\nthat he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think so, not for the present\u00e2\u0080\u0094nor the raft either, he\nadded; for it was already beginning to fall to pieces and could not\nfloat much longer.\n\nAs we were preparing to go inland and explore the island, we suddenly\nnoticed a whole band of Red Indians watching us with great curiosity\nfrom among the trees. The Doctor went forward to talk to them. But\nhe could not make them understand. He tried by signs to show them\nthat he had come on a friendly visit. The Indians didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to like\nus however. They had bows and arrows and long hunting spears, with\nstone points, in their hands; and they made signs back to the Doctor\nto tell him that if he came a step nearer they would kill us all.\nThey evidently wanted us to leave the island at once. It was a very\nuncomfortable situation.\n\nAt last the Doctor made them understand that he only wanted to see the\nisland all over and that then he would go away\u00e2\u0080\u0094though how he meant to\ndo it, with no boat to sail in, was more than I could imagine.\n\nWhile they were talking among themselves another Indian\narrived\u00e2\u0080\u0094apparently with a message that they were wanted in some\nother part of the island. Because presently, shaking their spears\nthreateningly at us, they went off with the newcomer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat discourteous pagans!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bumpo. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you ever see such\ninhospitability?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Never even asked us if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d had breakfast, the\nbenighted bounders!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSh! They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going off to their village,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polynesia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll bet\nthere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a village on the other side of those mountains. If you take my\nadvice, Doctor, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get away from this beach while their backs are\nturned. Let us go up into the higher land for the present\u00e2\u0080\u0094some place\nwhere they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know where we are. They may grow friendlier when\nthey see we mean no harm. They have honest, open faces and look like\na decent crowd to me. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just ignorant\u00e2\u0080\u0094probably never saw white\nfolks before.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo, feeling a little bit discouraged by our first reception, we moved\noff towards the mountains in the centre of the island.\n\n\n\n\n_THE SIXTH CHAPTER_\n\nTHE JABIZRI\n\n\nWE found the woods at the feet of the hills thick and tangly and\nsomewhat hard to get through. On Polynesia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advice, we kept away from\nall paths and trails, feeling it best to avoid meeting any Indians for\nthe present.\n\nBut she and Chee-Chee were good guides and splendid jungle-hunters; and\nthe two of them set to work at once looking for food for us. In a very\nshort space of time they had found quite a number of different fruits\nand nuts which made excellent eating, though none of us knew the names\nof any of them. We discovered a nice clean stream of good water which\ncame down from the mountains; so we were supplied with something to\ndrink as well.\n\nWe followed the stream up towards the heights. And presently we came to\nparts where the woods were thinner and the ground rocky and steep. Here\nwe could get glimpses of wonderful views all over the island, with the\nblue sea beyond.\n\nWhile we were admiring one of these the Doctor suddenly said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSh!\u00e2\u0080\u0094A\nJabizri!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you hear it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe listened and heard, somewhere in the air about us, an\nextraordinarily musical hum\u00e2\u0080\u0094like a bee, but not just one note. This hum\nrose and fell, up and down\u00e2\u0080\u0094almost like some one singing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo other insect but the Jabizri beetle hums like that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nDoctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wonder where he is\u00e2\u0080\u0094quite near, by the sound\u00e2\u0080\u0094flying among the\ntrees probably. Oh, if I only had my butterfly-net! Why didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I think\nto strap that around my waist too. Confound the storm: I may miss the\nchance of a lifetime now of getting the rarest beetle in the world\u00e2\u0080\u0094Oh\nlook! There he goes!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA huge beetle, easily three inches long I should say, suddenly flew by\nour noses. The Doctor got frightfully excited. He took off his hat to\nuse as a net, swooped at the beetle and caught it. He nearly fell down\na precipice on to the rocks below in his wild hurry, but that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nbother him in the least. He knelt down, chortling, upon the ground\nwith the Jabizri safe under his hat. From his pocket he brought out a\nglass-topped box, and into this he very skilfully made the beetle walk\nfrom under the rim of the hat. Then he rose up, happy as a child, to\nexamine his new treasure through the glass lid.\n\nIt certainly was a most beautiful insect. It was pale blue underneath;\nbut its back was glossy black with huge red spots on it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t an entymologist in the whole world who wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give\nall he has to be in my shoes to-day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cHulloa! This\nJabizri\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got something on his leg\u00e2\u0080\u0094Doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look like mud. I wonder what\nit is.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe took the beetle carefully out of the box and held it by its back\nin his fingers, where it waved its six legs slowly in the air. We all\ncrowded about him peering at it. Rolled around the middle section of\nits right foreleg was something that looked like a thin dried leaf. It\nwas bound on very neatly with strong spider-web.\n\nIt was marvelous to see how John Dolittle with his fat heavy fingers\nundid that cobweb cord and unrolled the leaf, whole, without tearing it\nor hurting the precious beetle. The Jabizri he put back into the box.\nThen he spread the leaf out flat and examined it.\n\nYou can imagine our surprise when we found that the inside of the leaf\nwas covered with signs and pictures, drawn so tiny that you almost\nneeded a magnifying-glass to tell what they were. Some of the signs we\ncouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make out at all; but nearly all of the pictures were quite\nplain, figures of men and mountains mostly. The whole was done in a\ncurious sort of brown ink.\n\nFor several moments there was a dead silence while we all stared at\nthe leaf, fascinated and mystified.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think this is written in blood,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor at last. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\nturns that color when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dry. Somebody pricked his finger to make\nthese pictures. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an old dodge when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re short of ink\u00e2\u0080\u0094but highly\nunsanitary\u00e2\u0080\u0094What an extraordinary thing to find tied to a beetle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leg!\nI wish I could talk beetle language, and find out where the Jabizri got\nit from.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut what is it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cRows of little pictures and signs. What do\nyou make of it, Doctor?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a letter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009ca picture letter. All these little things put\ntogether mean a message\u00e2\u0080\u0094But why give a message to a beetle to carry\u00e2\u0080\u0094and\nto a Jabizri, the rarest beetle in the world?\u00e2\u0080\u0094What an extraordinary\nthing!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen he fell to muttering over the pictures.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wonder what it means: men walking up a mountain; men walking into\na hole in a mountain; a mountain falling down\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good drawing,\nthat; men pointing to their open mouths; bars\u00e2\u0080\u0094prison-bars, perhaps; men\npraying; men lying down\u00e2\u0080\u0094they look as though they might be sick; and\nlast of all, just a mountain\u00e2\u0080\u0094a peculiar-shaped mountain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAll of a sudden the Doctor looked up sharply at me, a wonderful smile\nof delighted understanding spreading over his face.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_Long Arrow!_\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see, Stubbins?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Why, of course!\nOnly a naturalist would think of doing a thing like this: giving his\nletter to a beetle\u00e2\u0080\u0094not to a common beetle, but to the rarest of all,\none that other naturalists would try to catch\u00e2\u0080\u0094Well, well! Long Arrow!\u00e2\u0080\u0094A\npicture-letter from Long Arrow. For pictures are the only writing that\nhe knows.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, but who is the letter to?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to me very likely. Miranda had told him, I know, years ago, that\nsome day I meant to come here. But if not for me, then it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s for any one\nwho caught the beetle and read it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a letter to the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, but what does it say? It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to me that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s much good\nto you now you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, it is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause, look, I can read it now. First\npicture: men walking up a mountain\u00e2\u0080\u0094that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Long Arrow and his party;\nmen going into a hole in a mountain\u00e2\u0080\u0094they enter a cave looking for\nmedicine-plants or mosses; a mountain falling down\u00e2\u0080\u0094some hanging rocks\nmust have slipped and trapped them, imprisoned them in the cave. And\nthis was the only living creature that could carry a message for them\nto the outside world\u00e2\u0080\u0094a beetle, who could _burrow_ his way into the open\nair. Of course it was only a slim chance that the beetle would be ever\ncaught and the letter read. But it _was_ a chance; and when men are in\ngreat danger they grab at any straw of hope.... All right. Now look at\nthe next picture: men pointing to their open mouths\u00e2\u0080\u0094they are hungry;\nmen praying\u00e2\u0080\u0094begging any one who finds this letter to come to their\nassistance; men lying down\u00e2\u0080\u0094they are sick, or starving. This letter,\nStubbins, is their last cry for help.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe sprang to his feet as he ended, snatched out a note-book and put\nthe letter between the leaves. His hands were trembling with haste and\nagitation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome on!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cup the mountain\u00e2\u0080\u0094all of you. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a moment\nto lose. Bumpo, bring the water and nuts with you. Heaven only knows\nhow long they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been pining underground. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hope and pray we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not\ntoo late!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut where are you going to look?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMiranda said the island\nwas a hundred miles long and the mountains seem to run all the way down\nthe centre of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDidn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see the last picture?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, grabbing up his hat from\nthe ground and cramming it on his head. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was an oddly shaped\nmountain\u00e2\u0080\u0094looked like a hawk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head. Well, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where he is\u00e2\u0080\u0094if he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nstill alive. First thing for us to do, is to get up on a high peak and\nlook around the island for a mountain shaped like a hawks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 head\u00e2\u0080\u0094Just\nto think of it! There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a chance of my meeting Long Arrow, the son of\nGolden Arrow, after all!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Come on! Hurry! To delay may mean death to the\ngreatest naturalist ever born!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n_THE SEVENTH CHAPTER_\n\nHAWK\u00e2\u0080\u0099S-HEAD MOUNTAIN\n\n\nWE all agreed afterwards that none of us had ever worked so hard in our\nlives before as we did that day. For my part, I know I was often on the\npoint of dropping exhausted with fatigue; but I just kept on going\u00e2\u0080\u0094like\na machine\u00e2\u0080\u0094determined that, whatever happened, _I_ would not be the\nfirst to give up.\n\nWhen we had scrambled to the top of a high peak, almost instantly we\nsaw the strange mountain pictured in the letter. In shape it was the\nperfect image of a hawk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head, and was, as far as we could see, the\nsecond highest summit in the island.\n\nAlthough we were all out of breath from our climb, the Doctor didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nlet us rest a second as soon as he had sighted it. With one look at the\nsun for direction, down he dashed again, breaking through thickets,\nsplashing over brooks, taking all the short cuts. For a fat man, he was\ncertainly the swiftest cross-country runner I ever saw.\n\nWe floundered after him as fast as we could. When I say _we_, I mean\nBumpo and myself; for the animals, Jip, Chee-Chee and Polynesia, were\na long way ahead\u00e2\u0080\u0094even beyond the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0094enjoying the hunt like a\npaper-chase.\n\nAt length we arrived at the foot of the mountain we were making for;\nand we found its sides very steep. Said the Doctor,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow we will separate and search for caves. This spot where we now are,\nwill be our meeting-place. If anyone finds anything like a cave or a\nhole where the earth and rocks have fallen in, he must shout and hulloa\nto the rest of us. If we find nothing we will all gather here in about\nan hour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time\u00e2\u0080\u0094Everybody understand?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen we all went off our different ways.\n\nEach of us, you may be sure, was anxious to be the one to make a\ndiscovery. And never was a mountain searched so thoroughly. But alas!\nnothing could we find that looked in the least like a fallen-in cave.\nThere were plenty of places where rocks had tumbled down to the foot\nof the slopes; but none of these appeared as though caves or passages\ncould possibly lie behind them.\n\nOne by one, tired and disappointed, we straggled back to the\nmeeting-place. The Doctor seemed gloomy and impatient but by no means\ninclined to give up.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJip,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you _smell_ anything like an Indian anywhere?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jip. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI sniffed at every crack on the mountainside. But I am\nafraid my nose will be of no use to you here, Doctor. The trouble is,\nthe whole air is so saturated with the smell of spider-monkeys that it\ndrowns every other scent\u00e2\u0080\u0094And besides, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too cold and dry for good\nsmelling.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is certainly that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cand getting colder all the\ntime. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid the island is still drifting to the southward. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhope it stops before long, or we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to get even nuts and\nfruit to eat\u00e2\u0080\u0094everything in the island will perish\u00e2\u0080\u0094Chee-Chee, what luck\ndid you have?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNone, Doctor. I climbed to every peak and pinnacle I could see. I\nsearched every hollow and cleft. But not one place could I find where\nmen might be hidden.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd Polynesia,\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdid you see nothing that might put\nus on the right track?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot a thing, Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0094But I have a plan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh good!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried John Dolittle, full of hope renewed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is it?\nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hear it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou still have that beetle with you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Biz-biz, or\nwhatever it is you call the wretched insect?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, producing the glass-topped box from his pocket,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009chere it is.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right. Now listen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf what you have supposed is\ntrue\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, that Long Arrow had been trapped inside the mountain by\nfalling rock, he probably found that beetle inside the cave\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps\nmany other different beetles too, eh? He wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have been likely to\ntake the Biz-biz in with him, would he?\u00e2\u0080\u0094He was hunting plants, you say,\nnot beetles. Isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that right?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well. It is fair to suppose then that the beetle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home, or his\nhole, is in that place\u00e2\u0080\u0094the part of the mountain where Long Arrow and\nhis party are imprisoned, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cQuite, quite.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right. Then the thing to do is to let the beetle go\u00e2\u0080\u0094and watch him;\nand sooner or later he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll return to his home in Long Arrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cave. And\nthere we will follow him\u00e2\u0080\u0094Or at all events,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added smoothing down\nher wing-feathers with a very superior air, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe will follow him till\nthe miserable bug starts nosing under the earth. But at least he will\nshow us what part of the mountain Long Arrow is hidden in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut he may fly, if I let him out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen we shall\njust lose him and be no better off than we were before.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_Let_ him fly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d snorted Polynesia scornfully. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA parrot can wing it as\nfast as a Biz-biz, I fancy. If he takes to the air, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll guarantee not\nto let the little devil out of my sight. And if he just crawls along\nthe ground you can follow him yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSplendid!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPolynesia, you have a great brain. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nset him to work at once and see what happens.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAgain we all clustered round the Doctor as he carefully lifted off the\nglass lid and let the big beetle climb out upon his finger.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLadybug, Ladybug, fly away home!\u00e2\u0080\u009d crooned Bumpo. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour house is on\nfire and your chil\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, be quiet!\u00e2\u0080\u009d snapped Polynesia crossly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cStop insulting him! Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nyou suppose he has wits enough to go home without your telling him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought perchance he might be of a philandering disposition,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nBumpo humbly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt could be that he is tired of his home and needs to be\nencouraged. Shall I sing him \u00e2\u0080\u0098Home Sweet Home,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 think you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo. Then he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never go back. Your voice needs a rest. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sing to\nhim: just watch him\u00e2\u0080\u0094Oh, and Doctor, why not tie another message to the\ncreature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leg, telling Long Arrow that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing our best to reach\nhim and that he mustn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give up hope?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. And in a minute he had pulled a dry leaf\nfrom a bush near by and was covering it with little pictures in pencil.\n\nAt last, neatly fixed up with his new mail-bag, Mr. Jabizri crawled off\nthe Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s finger to the ground and looked about him. He stretched\nhis legs, polished his nose with his front feet and then moved off\nleisurely to the westward.\n\nWe had expected him to walk _up_ the mountain; instead, he walked\n_around_ it. Do you know how long it takes a beetle to walk round a\nmountain? Well, I assure you it takes an unbelievably long time. As\nthe hours dragged by, we hoped and hoped that he would get up and fly\nthe rest, and let Polynesia carry on the work of following him. But he\nnever opened his wings once. I had not realized before how hard it is\nfor a human being to walk slowly enough to keep up with a beetle. It\nwas the most tedious thing I have ever gone through. And as we dawdled\nalong behind, watching him like hawks lest we lose him under a leaf or\nsomething, we all got so cross and ill-tempered we were ready to bite\none another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heads off. And when he stopped to look at the scenery or\npolish his nose some more, I could hear Polynesia behind me letting out\nthe most dreadful seafaring swear-words you ever heard.\n\nAfter he had led us the whole way round the mountain he brought us to\nthe exact spot where we started from and there he came to a dead stop.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bumpo to Polynesia, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat do you think of the beetle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nsense now? You see he _doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t_ know enough to go home.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, be still, you Hottentot!\u00e2\u0080\u009d snapped Polynesia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t _you_ want\nto stretch your legs for exercise if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been shut up in a box all\nday. Probably his home is near here, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s come back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut why,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdid he go the whole way round the mountain first?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen the three of us got into a violent argument. But in the middle of\nit all the Doctor suddenly called out,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook, look!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe turned and found that he was pointing to the Jabizri, who was now\nwalking _up_ the mountain at a much faster and more business-like gait.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bumpo sitting down wearily; \u00e2\u0080\u009cif he is going to walk _over_\nthe mountain and back, for more exercise, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll wait for him here.\nChee-Chee and Polynesia can follow him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIndeed it would have taken a monkey or a bird to climb the place which\nthe beetle was now walking up. It was a smooth, flat part of the\nmountain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side, steep as a wall.\n\nBut presently, when the Jabizri was no more than ten feet above our\nheads, we all cried out together. For, even while we watched him, he\nhad disappeared into the face of the rock like a raindrop soaking into\nsand.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Polynesia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere must be a hole up there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And in a\ntwinkling she had fluttered up the rock and was clinging to the face of\nit with her claws.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she shouted down, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve run him to earth at last. His hole is\nright here, behind a patch of lichen\u00e2\u0080\u0094big enough to get two fingers in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis great slab of rock then must have slid\ndown from the summit and shut off the mouth of the cave like a door.\nPoor fellows! What a dreadful time they must have spent in there!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Oh,\nif we only had some picks and shovels now!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPicks and shovels wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do much good,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polynesia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook at the\nsize of the slab: a hundred feet high and as many broad. You would need\nan army for a week to make any impression on it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wonder how thick it is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor; and he picked up a big\nstone and banged it with all his might against the face of the rock.\nIt made a hollow booming sound, like a giant drum. We all stood still\nlistening while the echo of it died slowly away.\n\nAnd then a cold shiver ran down my spine. For, from within the\nmountain, back came three answering knocks: _Boom!... Boom!... Boom!_\n\nWide-eyed we looked at one another as though the earth itself had\nspoken. And the solemn little silence that followed was broken by the\nDoctor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank Heaven,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in a hushed reverent voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009csome of them at\nleast are alive!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nPART FIVE\n\n\n\n\n_THE FIRST CHAPTER_\n\nA GREAT MOMENT\n\n\nTHE next part of our problem was the hardest of all: how to roll aside,\npull down or break open, that gigantic slab. As we gazed up at it\ntowering above our heads, it looked indeed a hopeless task for our tiny\nstrength.\n\nBut the sounds of life from inside the mountain had put new heart in\nus. And in a moment we were all scrambling around trying to find any\nopening or crevice which would give us something to work on. Chee-Chee\nscaled up the sheer wall of the slab and examined the top of it where\nit leaned against the mountain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side; I uprooted bushes and stripped\noff hanging creepers that might conceal a weak place; the Doctor got\nmore leaves and composed new picture-letters for the Jabizri to take\nin if he should turn up again; whilst Polynesia carried up a handful\nof nuts and pushed them into the beetle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hole, one by one, for the\nprisoners inside to eat.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNuts are so nourishing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\n\nBut Jip it was who, scratching at the foot of the slab like a good\nratter, made the discovery which led to our final success.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, running up to John Dolittle with his nose all\ncovered with black mud, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis slab is resting on nothing but a bed of\nsoft earth. You never saw such easy digging. I guess the cave behind\nmust be just too high up for the Indians to reach the earth with their\nhands, or they could have scraped a way out long ago. If we can only\nscratch the earth-bed away from under, the slab might drop a little.\nThen maybe the Indians can climb out over the top.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Doctor hurried to examine the place where Jip had dug.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif we can get the earth away from under this\nfront edge, the slab is standing up so straight, we might even make it\nfall right down in this direction. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well worth trying. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s get at\nit, quick.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe had no tools but the sticks and slivers of stone which we could\nfind around. A strange sight we must have looked, the whole crew of us\nsquatting down on our heels, scratching and burrowing at the foot of\nthe mountain, like six badgers in a row.\n\nAfter about an hour, during which in spite of the cold the sweat fell\nfrom our foreheads in all directions, the Doctor said,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe ready to jump from under, clear out of the way, if she shows signs\nof moving. If this slab falls on anybody, it will squash him flatter\nthan a pancake.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPresently there was a grating, grinding sound.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook out!\u00e2\u0080\u009d yelled John Dolittle, \u00e2\u0080\u009chere she comes!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Scatter!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe ran for our lives, outwards, toward the sides. The big rock slid\ngently down, about a foot, into the trough which we had made beneath\nit. For a moment I was disappointed, for like that, it was as hopeless\nas before\u00e2\u0080\u0094no signs of a cave-mouth showing above it. But as I looked\nupward, I saw the top coming very slowly away from the mountainside.\nWe had unbalanced it below. As it moved apart from the face of the\nmountain, sounds of human voices, crying gladly in a strange tongue,\nissued from behind. Faster and faster the top swung forward, downward.\nThen, with a roaring crash which shook the whole mountain-range beneath\nour feet, it struck the earth and cracked in halves.\n\nHow can I describe to any one that first meeting between the two\ngreatest naturalists the world ever knew, Long Arrow, the son of Golden\nArrow and John Dolittle, M.D., of Puddleby-on-the-Marsh? The scene\nrises before me now, plain and clear in every detail, though it took\nplace so many, many years ago. But when I come to write of it, words\nseem such poor things with which to tell you of that great occasion.\n\nI know that the Doctor, whose life was surely full enough of big\nhappenings, always counted the setting free of the Indian scientist\nas the greatest thing he ever did. For my part, knowing how much this\nmeeting must mean to him, I was on pins and needles of expectation and\ncuriosity as the great stone finally thundered down at our feet and we\ngazed across it to see what lay behind.\n\nThe gloomy black mouth of a tunnel, full twenty feet high, was\nrevealed. In the centre of this opening stood an enormous red Indian,\nseven feet tall, handsome, muscular, slim and naked\u00e2\u0080\u0094but for a beaded\ncloth about his middle and an eagle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feather in his hair. He held one\nhand across his face to shield his eyes from the blinding sun which he\nhad not seen in many days.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is he!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I heard the Doctor whisper at my elbow. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know him by his\ngreat height and the scar upon his chin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he stepped forward slowly across the fallen stone with his hand\noutstretched to the red man.\n\nPresently the Indian uncovered his eyes. And I saw that they had a\ncurious piercing gleam in them\u00e2\u0080\u0094like the eyes of an eagle, but kinder\nand more gentle. He slowly raised his right arm, the rest of him still\nand motionless like a statue, and took the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand in his. It was\na great moment. Polynesia nodded to me in a knowing, satisfied kind of\nway. And I heard old Bumpo sniffle sentimentally.\n\nThen the Doctor tried to speak to Long Arrow. But the Indian knew\nno English of course, and the Doctor knew no Indian. Presently, to my\nsurprise, I heard the Doctor trying him in different animal languages.\n\n[Illustration: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a great moment\u00e2\u0080\u009d]\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do you do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in dog-talk; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am glad to see you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in\nhorse-signs; \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow long have you been buried?\u00e2\u0080\u009d in deer-language.\nStill the Indian made no move but stood there, straight and stiff,\nunderstanding not a word.\n\nThe Doctor tried again, in several other animal dialects. But with no\nresult.\n\nTill at last he came to the language of eagles.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGreat Red-Skin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in the fierce screams and short grunts that\nthe big birds use, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnever have I been so glad in all my life as I am\nto-day to find you still alive.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn a flash Long Arrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stony face lit up with a smile of\nunderstanding; and back came the answer in eagle-tongue,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMighty White Man, I owe my life to you. For the remainder of my days I\nam your servant to command.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAfterwards Long Arrow told us that this was the only bird or animal\nlanguage that he had ever been able to learn. But that he had not\nspoken it in a long time, for no eagles ever came to this island.\n\nThen the Doctor signaled to Bumpo who came forward with the nuts and\nwater. But Long Arrow neither ate nor drank. Taking the supplies with\na nod of thanks, he turned and carried them into the inner dimness of\nthe cave. We followed him.\n\nInside we found nine other Indians, men, women and boys, lying on the\nrock floor in a dreadful state of thinness and exhaustion.\n\nSome had their eyes closed, as if dead. Quickly the Doctor went round\nthem all and listened to their hearts. They were all alive; but one\nwoman was too weak even to stand upon her feet.\n\nAt a word from the Doctor, Chee-Chee and Polynesia sped off into the\njungles after more fruit and water.\n\nWhile Long Arrow was handing round what food we had to his starving\nfriends, we suddenly heard a sound outside the cave. Turning about we\nsaw, clustered at the entrance, the band of Indians who had met us so\ninhospitably at the beach.\n\nThey peered into the dark cave cautiously at first. But as soon as\nthey saw Long Arrow and the other Indians with us, they came rushing\nin, laughing, clapping their hands with joy and jabbering away at a\ntremendous rate.\n\nLong Arrow explained to the Doctor that the nine Indians we had found\nin the cave with him were two families who had accompanied him into\nthe mountains to help him gather medicine-plants. And while they had\nbeen searching for a kind of moss\u00e2\u0080\u0094good for indigestion\u00e2\u0080\u0094which grows only\ninside of damp caves, the great rock slab had slid down and shut them\nin. Then for two weeks they had lived on the medicine-moss and such\nfresh water as could be found dripping from the damp walls of the cave.\nThe other Indians on the island had given them up for lost and mourned\nthem as dead; and they were now very surprised and happy to find their\nrelatives alive.\n\nWhen Long Arrow turned to the newcomers and told them in their own\nlanguage that it was the white man who had found and freed their\nrelatives, they gathered round John Dolittle, all talking at once and\nbeating their breasts.\n\nLong Arrow said they were apologizing and trying to tell the Doctor how\nsorry they were that they had seemed unfriendly to him at the beach.\nThey had never seen a white man before and had really been afraid of\nhim\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially when they saw him conversing with the porpoises. They\nhad thought he was the Devil, they said.\n\nThen they went outside and looked at the great stone we had thrown\ndown, big as a meadow; and they walked round and round it, pointing to\nthe break running through the middle and wondering how the trick of\nfelling it was done.\n\nTravelers who have since visited Spidermonkey Island tell me that\nthat huge stone slab is now one of the regular sights of the island.\nAnd that the Indian guides, when showing it to visitors, always tell\n_their_ story of how it came there. They say that when the Doctor\nfound that the rocks had entrapped his friend, Long Arrow, he was so\nangry that he ripped the mountain in halves with his bare hands and let\nhim out.\n\n\n\n\n_THE SECOND CHAPTER_\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTHE MEN OF THE MOVING LAND\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nFROM that time on the Indians\u00e2\u0080\u0099 treatment of us was very different. We\nwere invited to their village for a feast to celebrate the recovery\nof the lost families. And after we had made a litter from saplings to\ncarry the sick woman in, we all started off down the mountain.\n\nOn the way the Indians told Long Arrow something which appeared to\nbe sad news, for on hearing it, his face grew very grave. The Doctor\nasked him what was wrong. And Long Arrow said he had just been informed\nthat the chief of the tribe, an old man of eighty, had died early that\nmorning.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Polynesia whispered in my ear, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmust have been what they went\nback to the village for, when the messenger fetched them from the\nbeach.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Remember?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat did he die of?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the Doctor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe died of cold,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Long Arrow.\n\nIndeed, now that the sun was setting, we were all shivering ourselves.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a serious thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor to me. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe island is still\nin the grip of that wretched current flowing southward. We will have to\nlook into this to-morrow. If nothing can be done about it, the Indians\nhad better take to canoes and leave the island. The chance of being\nwrecked will be better than getting frozen to death in the ice-floes of\nthe Antarctic.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPresently we came over a saddle in the hills, and looking downward on\nthe far side of the island, we saw the village\u00e2\u0080\u0094a large cluster of grass\nhuts and gaily colored totem-poles close by the edge of the sea.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow artistic!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cDelightfully situated. What is the\nname of the village?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPopsipetel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Long Arrow. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is the name also of the tribe. The\nword signifies in Indian tongue, _The Men of The Moving Land_. There\nare two tribes of Indians on the island: the Popsipetels at this end\nand the Bag-jagderags at the other.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhich is the larger of the two peoples?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Bag-jagderags, by far. Their city covers two square leagues. But,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nadded Long Arrow a slight frown darkening his handsome face, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor me, I\nwould rather have one Popsipetel than a hundred Bag-jagderags.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe news of the rescue we had made had evidently gone ahead of us. For\nas we drew nearer to the village we saw crowds of Indians streaming out\nto greet the friends and relatives whom they had never thought to see\nagain.\n\nThese good people, when they too were told how the rescue had been the\nwork of the strange white visitor to their shores, all gathered round\nthe Doctor, shook him by the hands, patted him and hugged him. Then\nthey lifted him up upon their strong shoulders and carried him down the\nhill into the village.\n\nThere the welcome we received was even more wonderful. In spite of\nthe cold air of the coming night, the villagers, who had all been\nshivering within their houses, threw open their doors and came out in\nhundreds. I had no idea that the little village could hold so many.\nThey thronged about us, smiling and nodding and waving their hands;\nand as the details of what we had done were recited by Long Arrow they\nkept shouting strange singing noises, which we supposed were words of\ngratitude or praise.\n\nWe were next escorted to a brand-new grass house, clean and\nsweet-smelling within, and informed that it was ours. Six strong Indian\nboys were told off to be our servants.\n\nOn our way through the village we noticed a house, larger than the\nrest, standing at the end of the main street. Long Arrow pointed to it\nand told us it was the Chief\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house, but that it was now empty\u00e2\u0080\u0094no new\nchief having yet been elected to take the place of the old one who had\ndied.\n\nInside our new home a feast of fish and fruit had been prepared. Most\nof the more important men of the tribe were already seating themselves\nat the long dining-table when we got there. Long Arrow invited us to\nsit down and eat.\n\nThis we were glad enough to do, as we were all hungry. But we were both\nsurprised and disappointed when we found that the fish had not been\ncooked. The Indians did not seem to think this extraordinary in the\nleast, but went ahead gobbling the fish with much relish the way it\nwas, raw.\n\nWith many apologies, the Doctor explained to Long Arrow that if they\nhad no objection we would prefer our fish cooked.\n\nImagine our astonishment when we found that the great Long Arrow, so\nlearned in the natural sciences, did not know what the word _cooked_\nmeant!\n\nPolynesia who was sitting on the bench between John Dolittle and myself\npulled the Doctor by the sleeve.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong, Doctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she whispered as he leant down to\nlisten to her: \u00e2\u0080\u009c_these people have no fires_! They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to\nmake a fire. Look outside: It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost dark, and there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a light\nshowing in the whole village. This is a fireless people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n_THE THIRD CHAPTER_\n\nFIRE\n\n\nTHEN the Doctor asked Long Arrow if he knew what fire was, explaining\nit to him by pictures drawn on the buckskin table-cloth. Long Arrow\nsaid he had seen such a thing\u00e2\u0080\u0094coming out of the tops of volcanoes; but\nthat neither he nor any of the Popsipetels knew how it was made.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPoor perishing heathens!\u00e2\u0080\u009d muttered Bumpo. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo wonder the old chief\ndied of cold!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt that moment we heard a crying sound at the door. And turning round,\nwe saw a weeping Indian mother with a baby in her arms. She said\nsomething to the Indians which we could not understand; and Long Arrow\ntold us the baby was sick and she wanted the white doctor to try and\ncure it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh Lord!\u00e2\u0080\u009d groaned Polynesia in my ear\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust like Puddleby: patients\narriving in the middle of dinner. Well, one thing: the food\u00e2\u0080\u0099s raw, so\nnothing can get cold anyway.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Doctor examined the baby and found at once that it was thoroughly\nchilled.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFire\u00e2\u0080\u0094_fire_! That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what it needs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said turning to Long\nArrow\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what you all need. This child will have pneumonia if it\nisn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t kept warm.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAye, truly. But how to make a fire,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Long Arrow\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cwhere to get it:\nthat is the difficulty. All the volcanoes in this land are dead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen we fell to hunting through our pockets to see if any matches had\nsurvived the shipwreck. The best we could muster were two whole ones\nand a half\u00e2\u0080\u0094all with the heads soaked off them by salt water.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHark, Long Arrow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor: \u00e2\u0080\u009cdivers ways there be of making\nfire without the aid of matches. One: with a strong glass and the\nrays of the sun. That however, since the sun has set, we cannot now\nemploy. Another is by grinding a hard stick into a soft log\u00e2\u0080\u0094Is the\ndaylight gone without?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Alas yes. Then I fear we must await the morrow;\nfor besides the different woods, we need an old squirrel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nest for\nfuel\u00e2\u0080\u0094And that without lamps you could not find in your forests at this\nhour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGreat are your cunning and your skill, oh White Man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Long Arrow\nreplied. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut in this you do us an injustice. Know you not that all\nfireless peoples can see in the dark? Having no lamps we are forced to\ntrain ourselves to travel through the blackest night, lightless. I will\ndespatch a messenger and you shall have your squirrel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nest within the\nhour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe gave an order to two of our boy-servants who promptly disappeared\nrunning. And sure enough, in a very short space of time a squirrel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nnest, together with hard and soft woods, was brought to our door.\n\nThe moon had not yet risen and within the house it was practically\npitch-black. I could feel and hear, however, that the Indians were\nmoving about comfortably as though it were daylight. The task of making\nfire the Doctor had to perform almost entirely by the sense of touch,\nasking Long Arrow and the Indians to hand him his tools when he mislaid\nthem in the dark. And then I made a curious discovery: now that I had\nto, I found that I was beginning to see a little in the dark myself.\nAnd for the first time I realized that of course there _is_ no such\nthing as pitch-dark, so long as you have a door open or a sky above you.\n\nCalling for the loan of a bow, the Doctor loosened the string, put the\nhard stick into a loop and began grinding this stick into the soft wood\nof the log. Soon I smelt that the log was smoking. Then he kept feeding\nthe part that was smoking with the inside lining of the squirrel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nnest, and he asked me to blow upon it with my breath. He made the stick\ndrill faster and faster. More smoke filled the room. And at last the\ndarkness about us was suddenly lit up. The squirrel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nest had burst\ninto flame.\n\nThe Indians murmured and grunted with astonishment. At first they were\nall for falling on their knees and worshiping the fire. Then they\nwanted to pick it up with their bare hands and play with it. We had to\nteach them how it was to be used; and they were quite fascinated when\nwe laid our fish across it on sticks and cooked it. They sniffed the\nair with relish as, for the first time in history, the smell of fried\nfish passed through the village of Popsipetel.\n\nThen we got them to bring us piles and stacks of dry wood; and we made\nan enormous bonfire in the middle of the main street. Round this, when\nthey felt its warmth, the whole tribe gathered and smiled and wondered.\nIt was a striking sight, one of the pictures from our voyages that I\nmost frequently remember: that roaring jolly blaze beneath the black\nnight sky, and all about it a vast ring of Indians, the firelight\ngleaming on bronze cheeks, white teeth and flashing eyes\u00e2\u0080\u0094a whole town\ntrying to get warm, giggling and pushing like school-children.\n\nIn a little, when we had got them more used to the handling of fire,\nthe Doctor showed them how it could be taken into their houses if a\nhole were only made in the roof to let the smoke out. And before we\nturned in after that long, long, tiring day, we had fires going in\nevery hut in the village.\n\nThe poor people were so glad to get really warm again that we thought\nthey\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never go to bed. Well on into the early hours of the morning\nthe little town fairly buzzed with a great low murmur: the Popsipetels\nsitting up talking of their wonderful pale-faced visitor and this\nstrange good thing he had brought with him\u00e2\u0080\u0094_fire_!\n\n\n\n\n_THE FOURTH CHAPTER_\n\nWHAT MAKES AN ISLAND FLOAT\n\n\nVERY early in our experience of Popsipetel kindness we saw that if we\nwere to get anything done at all, we would almost always have to do it\nsecretly. The Doctor was so popular and loved by all that as soon as he\nshowed his face at his door in the morning crowds of admirers, waiting\npatiently outside, flocked about him and followed him wherever he went.\nAfter his fire-making feat, this childlike people expected him, I\nthink, to be continually doing magic; and they were determined not to\nmiss a trick.\n\nIt was only with great difficulty that we escaped from the crowd the\nfirst morning and set out with Long Arrow to explore the island at our\nleisure.\n\nIn the interior we found that not only the plants and trees were\nsuffering from the cold: the animal life was in even worse straits.\nEverywhere shivering birds were to be seen, their feathers all fluffed\nout, gathering together for flight to summer lands. And many lay dead\nupon the ground. Going down to the shore, we watched land-crabs in\nlarge numbers taking to the sea to find some better home. While away to\nthe Southeast we could see many icebergs floating\u00e2\u0080\u0094a sign that we were\nnow not far from the terrible region of the Antarctic.\n\nAs we were looking out to sea, we noticed our friends the porpoises\njumping through the waves. The Doctor hailed them and they came inshore.\n\nHe asked them how far we were from the South Polar Continent.\n\nAbout a hundred miles, they told him. And then they asked why he wanted\nto know.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause this floating island we are on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis drifting\nsouthward all the time in a current. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an island that ordinarily\nbelongs somewhere in the tropic zone\u00e2\u0080\u0094real sultry weather, sunstrokes\nand all that. If it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop going southward pretty soon everything\non it is going to perish.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the porpoises, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthen the thing to do is to get it back\ninto a warmer climate, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, but how?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t _row_ it back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said they, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut whales could push it\u00e2\u0080\u0094if you only got enough of\nthem.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a splendid idea!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Whales, the very thing!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo\nyou think you could get me some?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, certainly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the porpoises, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe passed one herd of them out\nthere, sporting about among the icebergs. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll ask them to come over.\nAnd if they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enough, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try and hunt up some more. Better have\nplenty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are very kind\u00e2\u0080\u0094By the way, do you\nhappen to know how this island came to be a floating island? At least\nhalf of it, I notice, is made of stone. It is very odd that it floats\nat all, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is unusual,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the explanation is quite simple. It\nused to be a mountainous part of South America\u00e2\u0080\u0094an overhanging part\u00e2\u0080\u0094sort\nof an awkward corner, you might say. Way back in the glacial days,\nthousands of years ago, it broke off from the mainland; and by some\ncurious accident the inside of it, which is hollow, got filled with\nair as it fell into the ocean. You can only see less than half of\nthe island: the bigger half is under water. And in the middle of it,\nunderneath, is a huge rock air-chamber, running right up inside the\nmountains. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what keeps it floating.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a pecurious phenometer!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bumpo.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is indeed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI must make a note of that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And out\ncame the everlasting note-book.\n\nThe porpoises went bounding off towards the icebergs. And not long\nafter, we saw the sea heaving and frothing as a big herd of whales came\ntowards us at full speed.\n\nThey certainly were enormous creatures; and there must have been a good\ntwo hundred of them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere they are,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the porpoises, poking their heads out of the\nwater.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow just explain to them, will you please?\nthat this is a very serious matter for all the living creatures in this\nland. And ask them if they will be so good as to go down to the far end\nof the island, put their noses against it and push it back near the\ncoast of Southern Brazil.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe porpoises evidently succeeded in persuading the whales to do as the\nDoctor asked; for presently we saw them thrashing through the seas,\ngoing off towards the south end of the island.\n\nThen we lay down upon the beach and waited.\n\nAfter about an hour the Doctor got up and threw a stick into the water.\nFor a while this floated motionless. But soon we saw it begin to move\ngently down the coast.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009csee that?\u00e2\u0080\u0094The island is going North at last.\nThank goodness!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFaster and faster we left the stick behind; and smaller and dimmer grew\nthe icebergs on the skyline.\n\nThe Doctor took out his watch, threw more sticks into the water and\nmade a rapid calculation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHumph!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Fourteen and a half knots an hour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he murmured\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cA very nice\nspeed. It should take us about five days to get back near Brazil. Well,\nthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that\u00e2\u0080\u0094Quite a load off my mind. I declare I feel warmer already.\nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s go and get something to eat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n_THE FIFTH CHAPTER_\n\nWAR!\n\n\nON our way back to the village the Doctor began discussing natural\nhistory with Long Arrow. But their most interesting talk, mainly about\nplants, had hardly begun when an Indian runner came dashing up to us\nwith a message.\n\nLong Arrow listened gravely to the breathless, babbled words, then\nturned to the Doctor and said in eagle tongue,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGreat White Man, an evil thing has befallen the Popsipetels. Our\nneighbors to the southward, the thievish Bag-jagderags, who for so long\nhave cast envious eyes on our stores of ripe corn, have gone upon the\nwar-path; and even now are advancing to attack us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEvil news indeed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYet let us not judge harshly.\nPerhaps it is that they are desperate for food, having their own crops\nfrost-killed before harvest. For are they not even nearer the cold\nSouth than you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMake no excuses for any man of the tribe of the Bag-jagderags,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nLong Arrow shaking his head. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are an idle shiftless race. They do\nbut see a chance to get corn without the labor of husbandry. If it\nwere not that they are a much bigger tribe and hope to defeat their\nneighbor by sheer force of numbers, they would not have dared to make\nopen war upon the brave Popsipetels.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen we reached the village we found it in a great state of excitement.\nEverywhere men were seen putting their bows in order, sharpening\nspears, grinding battle-axes and making arrows by the hundred. Women\nwere raising a high fence of bamboo poles all round the village. Scouts\nand messengers kept coming and going, bringing news of the movements of\nthe enemy. While high up in the trees and hills about the village we\ncould see look-outs watching the mountains to the southward.\n\nLong Arrow brought another Indian, short but enormously broad, and\nintroduced him to the Doctor as Big Teeth, the chief warrior of the\nPopsipetels.\n\nThe Doctor volunteered to go and see the enemy and try to argue the\nmatter out peacefully with them instead of fighting; for war, he said,\nwas at best a stupid wasteful business. But the two shook their heads.\nSuch a plan was hopeless, they said. In the last war when they had sent\na messenger to do peaceful arguing, the enemy had merely hit him with\nan ax.\n\nWhile the Doctor was asking Big Teeth how he meant to defend the\nvillage against attack, a cry of alarm was raised by the look-outs.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re coming!\u00e2\u0080\u0094The Bag-jagderags\u00e2\u0080\u0094swarming down the mountains in\nthousands!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all in the day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work, I suppose. I\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe in war; but if the village is attacked we must help\ndefend it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he picked up a club from the ground and tried the heft of it\nagainst a stone.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cseems like a pretty good tool to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he walked\nto the bamboo fence and took his place among the other waiting fighters.\n\nThen we all got hold of some kind of weapon with which to help our\nfriends, the gallant Popsipetels: I borrowed a bow and a quiver full of\narrows; Jip was content to rely upon his old, but still strong teeth;\nChee-Chee took a bag of rocks and climbed a palm where he could throw\nthem down upon the enemies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 heads; and Bumpo marched after the Doctor\nto the fence armed with a young tree in one hand and a door-post in the\nother.\n\nWhen the enemy drew near enough to be seen from where we stood we all\ngasped with astonishment. The hillsides were actually covered with\nthem\u00e2\u0080\u0094thousands upon thousands. They made our small army within the\nvillage look like a mere handful.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSaints alive!\u00e2\u0080\u009d muttered Polynesia, \u00e2\u0080\u009cour little lot will stand no\nchance against that swarm. This will never do. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going off to get\nsome help.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhere she was going and what kind of help she meant to get, I had no\nidea. She just disappeared from my side. But Jip, who had heard her,\npoked his nose between the bamboo bars of the fence to get a better\nview of the enemy and said,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLikely enough she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone after the Black Parrots. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hope she\nfinds them in time. Just look at those ugly ruffians climbing down the\nrocks\u00e2\u0080\u0094millions of \u00e2\u0080\u0099em! This fight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to keep us all hopping.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd Jip was right. Before a quarter of an hour had gone by our\nvillage was completely surrounded by one huge mob of yelling, raging\nBag-jagderags.\n\nI now come again to a part in the story of our voyages where things\nhappened so quickly, one upon the other, that looking backwards I see\nthe picture only in a confused kind of way. I know that if it had not\nbeen for the Terrible Three\u00e2\u0080\u0094as they came afterwards to be fondly called\nin Popsipetel history\u00e2\u0080\u0094Long Arrow, Bumpo and the Doctor, the war would\nhave been soon over and the whole island would have belonged to the\nworthless Bag-jagderags. But the Englishman, the African and the Indian\nwere a regiment in themselves; and between them they made that village\na dangerous place for any man to try to enter.\n\nThe bamboo fencing which had been hastily set up around the town was\nnot a very strong affair; and right from the start it gave way in\none place after another as the enemy thronged and crowded against it.\nThen the Doctor, Long Arrow and Bumpo would hurry to the weak spot, a\nterrific hand-to-hand fight would take place and the enemy be thrown\nout. But almost instantly a cry of alarm would come from some other\npart of the village-wall; and the Three would have to rush off and do\nthe same thing all over again.\n\n[Illustration: The Terrible Three\n\n_From an Indian rock-engraving found on Hawks\u00e2\u0080\u0099-Head Mountain,\nSpidermonkey Island_]\n\nThe Popsipetels were themselves no mean fighters; but the strength and\nweight of those three men of different lands and colors, standing close\ntogether, swinging their enormous war-clubs, was really a sight for the\nwonder and admiration of any one.\n\nMany weeks later when I was passing an Indian camp-fire at night I\nheard this song being sung. It has since become one of the traditional\nfolksongs of the Popsipetels.\n\n             THE SONG OF THE TERRIBLE THREE\n\n      Oh hear ye the Song of the Terrible Three\n    And the fight that they fought by the edge of the sea.\n      Down from the mountains, the rocks and the crags,\n    Swarming like wasps, came the Bag-jagderags.\n\n      Surrounding our village, our walls they broke down.\n    Oh, sad was the plight of our men and our town!\n      But Heaven determined our land to set free\n    And sent us the help of the Terrible Three.\n\n      One was a Black\u00e2\u0080\u0094he was dark as the night;\n    One was a Red-skin, a mountain of height;\n      But the chief was a White Man, round like a bee;\n    And all in a row stood the Terrible Three.\n\n      Shoulder to shoulder, they hammered and hit.\n    Like demons of fury they kicked and they bit.\n      Like a wall of destruction they stood in a row,\n    Flattening enemies, six at a blow.\n\n      Oh, strong was the Red-skin fierce was the Black.\n    Bag-jagderags trembled and tried to turn back.\n      But \u00e2\u0080\u0099twas of the White Man they shouted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBeware!\n    He throws men in handfuls, straight up in the air!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n      Long shall they frighten bad children at night\n    With tales of the Red and the Black and the White.\n      And long shall we sing of the Terrible Three\n    And the fight that they fought by the edge of the sea.\n\n\n\n\n_THE SIXTH CHAPTER_\n\nGENERAL POLYNESIA\n\n\nBUT alas! even the Three, mighty though they were, could not last\nforever against an army which seemed to have no end. In one of the\nhottest scrimmages, when the enemy had broken a particularly wide hole\nthrough the fence, I saw Long Arrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great figure topple and come down\nwith a spear sticking in his broad chest.\n\nFor another half-hour Bumpo and the Doctor fought on side by side. How\ntheir strength held out so long I cannot tell, for never a second were\nthey given to get their breath or rest their arms.\n\nThe Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0094the quiet, kindly, peaceable, little Doctor!\u00e2\u0080\u0094well, you\nwouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have known him if you had seen him that day dealing out whacks\nyou could hear a mile off, walloping and swatting in all directions.\n\nAs for Bumpo, with staring eye-balls and grim set teeth, he was\na veritable demon. None dared come within yards of that wicked,\nwide-circling door-post. But a stone, skilfully thrown, struck him at\nlast in the centre of the forehead. And down went the second of the\nThree. John Dolittle, the last of the Terribles, was left fighting\nalone.\n\nJip and I rushed to his side and tried to take the places of the fallen\nones. But, far too light and too small, we made but a poor exchange.\nAnother length of the fence crashed down, and through the widened gap\nthe Bag-jagderags poured in on us like a flood.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo the canoes!\u00e2\u0080\u0094To the sea!\u00e2\u0080\u009d shouted the Popsipetels. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFly for your\nlives!\u00e2\u0080\u0094All is over!\u00e2\u0080\u0094The war is lost!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut the Doctor and I never got a chance to fly for our lives. We were\nswept off our feet and knocked down flat by the sheer weight of the\nmob. And once down, we were unable to get up again. I thought we would\nsurely be trampled to death.\n\nBut at that moment, above the din and racket of the battle, we heard\nthe most terrifying noise that ever assaulted human ears: the sound of\nmillions and millions of parrots all screeching with fury together.\n\nThe army, which in the nick of time Polynesia had brought to our\nrescue, darkened the whole sky to the westward. I asked her afterwards,\nhow many birds there were; and she said she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know exactly but\nthat they certainly numbered somewhere between sixty and seventy\nmillions. In that extraordinarily short space of time she had brought\nthem from the mainland of South America.\n\nIf you have ever heard a parrot screech with anger you will know that\nit makes a truly frightful sound; and if you have ever been bitten by\none, you will know that its bite can be a nasty and a painful thing.\n\nThe Black Parrots (coal-black all over, they were\u00e2\u0080\u0094except for a scarlet\nbeak and a streak of red in wing and tail) on the word of command from\nPolynesia set to work upon the Bag-jagderags who were now pouring\nthrough the village looking for plunder.\n\nAnd the Black Parrots\u00e2\u0080\u0099 method of fighting was peculiar. This is what\nthey did: on the head of each Bag-jagderag three or four parrots\nsettled and took a good foot-hold in his hair with their claws; then\nthey leant down over the sides of his head and began clipping snips out\nof his ears, for all the world as though they were punching tickets.\nThat is all they did. They never bit them anywhere else except the\nears. But it won the war for us.\n\nWith howls pitiful to hear, the Bag-jagderags fell over one another in\ntheir haste to get out of that accursed village. It was no use their\ntrying to pull the parrots off their heads; because for each head there\nwere always four more parrots waiting impatiently to get on.\n\nSome of the enemy were lucky; and with only a snip or two managed to\nget outside the fence\u00e2\u0080\u0094where the parrots immediately left them alone.\nBut with most, before the black birds had done with them, the ears\npresented a very singular appearance\u00e2\u0080\u0094like the edge of a postage-stamp.\nThis treatment, very painful at the time, did not however do them any\npermanent harm beyond the change in looks. And it later got to be the\ntribal mark of the Bag-jagderags. No really smart young lady of this\ntribe would be seen walking with a man who did not have scalloped\nears\u00e2\u0080\u0094for such was a proof that he had been in the Great War. And that\n(though it is not generally known to scientists) is how this people\ncame to be called by the other Indian nations, the _Ragged-Eared\nBag-jagderags_.\n\nAs soon as the village was cleared of the enemy the Doctor turned his\nattention to the wounded.\n\nIn spite of the length and fierceness of the struggle, there were\nsurprisingly few serious injuries. Poor Long Arrow was the worst off.\nHowever, after the Doctor had washed his wound and got him to bed, he\nopened his eyes and said he already felt better. Bumpo was only badly\nstunned.\n\nWith this part of the business over, the Doctor called to Polynesia\nto have the Black Parrots drive the enemy right back into their own\ncountry and to wait there, guarding them all night.\n\nPolynesia gave the short word of command; and like one bird those\nmillions of parrots opened their red beaks and let out once more their\nterrifying battle-scream.\n\nThe Bag-jagderags didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wait to be bitten a second time, but fled\nhelter-skelter over the mountains from which they had come; whilst\nPolynesia and her victorious army followed watchfully behind like a\ngreat, threatening, black cloud.\n\nThe Doctor picked up his high hat which had been knocked off in the\nfight, dusted it carefully and put it on.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo-morrow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, shaking his fist towards the hills, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe will\narrange the terms of peace\u00e2\u0080\u0094and we will arrange them\u00e2\u0080\u0094in the City of\nBag-jagderag!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis words were greeted with cheers of triumph from the admiring\nPopsipetels. The war was over.\n\n\n\n\n_THE SEVENTH CHAPTER_\n\nTHE PEACE OF THE PARROTS\n\n\nTHE next day we set out for the far end of the island, and reaching it\nin canoes (for we went by sea) after a journey of twenty-five hours, we\nremained no longer than was necessary in the City of Bag-jagderag.\n\nWhen he threw himself into that fight at Popsipetel, I saw the Doctor\nreally angry for the first time in my life. But his anger, once\naroused, was slow to die. All the way down the coast of the island he\nnever ceased to rail against this cowardly people who had attacked his\nfriends, the Popsipetels, for no other reason but to rob them of their\ncorn, because they were too idle to till the land themselves. And he\nwas still angry when he reached the City of Bag-jagderag.\n\nLong Arrow had not come with us for he was as yet too weak from his\nwound. But the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0094always clever at languages\u00e2\u0080\u0094was already getting\nfamiliar with the Indian tongue. Besides, among the half-dozen\nPopsipetels who accompanied us to paddle the canoes, was one boy to\nwhom we had taught a little English. He and the Doctor between them\nmanaged to make themselves understood to the Bag-jagderags. This\npeople, with the terrible parrots still blackening the hills about\ntheir stone town, waiting for the word to descend and attack, were, we\nfound, in a very humble mood.\n\nLeaving our canoes we passed up the main street to the palace of the\nchief. Bumpo and I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help smiling with satisfaction as we saw\nhow the waiting crowds which lined the roadway bowed their heads to the\nground, as the little, round, angry figure of the Doctor strutted ahead\nof us with his chin in the air.\n\nAt the foot of the palace-steps the chief and all the more important\npersonages of the tribe were waiting to meet him, smiling humbly and\nholding out their hands in friendliness. The Doctor took not the\nslightest notice. He marched right by them, up the steps to the door\nof the palace. There he turned around and at once began to address the\npeople in a firm voice.\n\nI never heard such a speech in my life\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I am quite sure that they\nnever did either. First he called them a long string of names: cowards,\nloafers, thieves, vagabonds, good-for-nothings, bullies and what not.\nThen he said he was still seriously thinking of allowing the parrots to\ndrive them on into the sea, in order that this pleasant land might be\nrid, once for all, of their worthless carcases.\n\nAt this a great cry for mercy went up, and the chief and all of\nthem fell on their knees, calling out that they would submit to any\nconditions of peace he wished.\n\nThen the Doctor called for one of their scribes\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, a man who did\npicture-writing. And on the stone walls of the palace of Bag-jagderag\nhe bade him write down the terms of the peace as he dictated it.\nThis peace is known as _The Peace of The Parrots_, and\u00e2\u0080\u0094unlike most\npeaces\u00e2\u0080\u0094was, and is, strictly kept\u00e2\u0080\u0094even to this day.\n\nIt was quite long in words. The half of the palace-front was covered\nwith picture-writing, and fifty pots of paint were used, before the\nweary scribe had done. But the main part of it all was that there\nshould be no more fighting; and that the two tribes should give solemn\npromise to help one another whenever there was corn-famine or other\ndistress in the lands belonging to either.\n\nThis greatly surprised the Bag-jagderags. They had expected from the\nDoctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s angry face that he would at least chop a couple of hundred\nheads off\u00e2\u0080\u0094and probably make the rest of them slaves for life.\n\nBut when they saw that he only meant kindly by them, their great fear\nof him changed to a tremendous admiration. And as he ended his long\nspeech and walked briskly down the steps again on his way back to the\ncanoes, the group of chieftains threw themselves at his feet and cried,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo but stay with us, Great Lord, and all the riches of Bag-jagderag\nshall be poured into your lap. Gold-mines we know of in the mountains\nand pearl-beds beneath the sea. Only stay with us, that your\nall-powerful wisdom may lead our Council and our people in prosperity\nand peace.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Doctor held up his hand for silence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould wish to be the guest of the Bag-jagderags\ntill they had proved by their deeds that they are an honest race. Be\ntrue to the terms of the Peace and from yourselves shall come good\ngovernment and prosperity\u00e2\u0080\u0094Farewell!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen he turned and followed by Bumpo, the Popsipetels and myself,\nwalked rapidly down to the canoes.\n\n\n\n\n_THE EIGHTH CHAPTER_\n\nTHE HANGING STONE\n\n\nBUT the change of heart in the Bag-jagderags was really sincere. The\nDoctor had made a great impression on them\u00e2\u0080\u0094a deeper one than even he\nhimself realized at the time. In fact I sometimes think that that\nspeech of his from the palace-steps had more effect upon the Indians of\nSpidermonkey Island than had any of his great deeds which, great though\nthey were, were always magnified and exaggerated when the news of them\nwas passed from mouth to mouth.\n\nA sick girl was brought to him as he reached the place where the boats\nlay. She turned out to have some quite simple ailment which he quickly\ngave the remedy for. But this increased his popularity still more. And\nwhen he stepped into his canoe, the people all around us actually burst\ninto tears. It seems (I learned this afterwards) that they thought he\nwas going away across the sea, for good, to the mysterious foreign\nlands from which he had come.\n\nSome of the chieftains spoke to the Popsipetels as we pushed off. What\nthey said I did not understand; but we noticed that several canoes\nfilled with Bag-jagderags followed us at a respectful distance all the\nway back to Popsipetel.\n\nThe Doctor had determined to return by the other shore, so that we\nshould be thus able to make a complete trip round the island\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shores.\n\nShortly after we started, while still off the lower end of the island,\nwe sighted a steep point on the coast where the sea was in a great\nstate of turmoil, white with soapy froth. On going nearer, we found\nthat this was caused by our friendly whales who were still faithfully\nworking away with their noses against the end of the island, driving us\nnorthward. We had been kept so busy with the war that we had forgotten\nall about them. But as we paused and watched their mighty tails lashing\nand churning the sea, we suddenly realized that we had not felt cold\nin quite a long while. Speeding up our boat lest the island be carried\naway from us altogether, we passed on up the coast; and here and there\nwe noticed that the trees on the shore already looked greener and more\nhealthy. Spidermonkey Island was getting back into her home climates.\n\nAbout halfway to Popsipetel we went ashore and spent two or three days\nexploring the central part of the island. Our Indian paddlers took us\nup into the mountains, very steep and high in this region, overhanging\nthe sea. And they showed us what they called the Whispering Rocks.\n\nThis was a very peculiar and striking piece of scenery. It was like a\ngreat vast basin, or circus, in the mountains, and out of the centre of\nit there rose a table of rock with an ivory chair upon it. All around\nthis the mountains went up like stairs, or theatre-seats, to a great\nheight\u00e2\u0080\u0094except at one narrow end which was open to a view of the sea.\nYou could imagine it a council-place or concert-hall for giants, and\nthe rock table in the centre the stage for performers or the stand for\nthe speaker.\n\n[Illustration: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWorking away with their noses against the end of the\nisland\u00e2\u0080\u009d]\n\nWe asked our guides why it was called the Whispering Rocks; and they\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGo down into it and we will show you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe great bowl was miles deep and miles wide. We scrambled down the\nrocks and they showed us how, even when you stood far, far apart from\none another, you merely had to whisper in that great place and every\none in the theatre could hear you. This was, the Doctor said, on\naccount of the echoes which played backwards and forwards between the\nhigh walls of rock.\n\nOur guides told us that it was here, in days long gone by when the\nPopsipetels owned the whole of Spidermonkey Island, that the kings\nwere crowned. The ivory chair upon the table was the throne in which\nthey sat. And so great was the big theatre that all the Indians in the\nisland were able to get seats in it to see the ceremony.\n\nThey showed us also an enormous hanging stone perched on the edge of\na volcano\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crater\u00e2\u0080\u0094the highest summit in the whole island. Although\nit was very far below us, we could see it quite plainly; and it looked\nwobbly enough to be pushed off its perch with the hand. There was a\nlegend among the people, they said, that when the greatest of all\nPopsipetel kings should be crowned in the ivory chair, this hanging\nstone would tumble into the volcano\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth and go straight down to the\ncentre of the earth.\n\n[Illustration: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Whispering Rocks\u00e2\u0080\u009d]\n\nThe Doctor said he would like to go and examine it closer.\n\nAnd when we were come to the lip of the volcano (it took us half a\nday to get up to it) we found the stone was unbelievably large\u00e2\u0080\u0094big\nas a cathedral. Underneath it we could look right down into a black\nhole which seemed to have no bottom. The Doctor explained to us that\nvolcanoes sometimes spurted up fire from these holes in their tops; but\nthat those on floating islands were always cold and dead.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStubbins,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, looking up at the great stone towering above us,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cdo you know what would most likely happen if that boulder should fall\nin?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou remember the air-chamber which the porpoises told us lies under\nthe centre of the island?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, this stone is heavy enough, if it fell into the volcano, to\nbreak through into that air-chamber from above. And once it did, the\nair would escape and the floating island would float no more. It would\nsink.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut then everybody on it would be drowned, wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bumpo.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh no, not necessarily. That would depend on the depth of the sea\nwhere the sinking took place. The island might touch bottom when it\nhad only gone down, say, a hundred feet. But there would be lots of it\nstill sticking up above the water then, wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bumpo, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose there would. Well, let us hope that the\nponderous fragment does _not_ lose its equilibriosity, for I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nbelieve it would stop at the centre of the earth\u00e2\u0080\u0094more likely it would\nfall right through the world and come out the other side.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMany other wonders there were which these men showed us in the central\nregions of their island. But I have not time or space to tell you of\nthem now.\n\nDescending towards the shore again, we noticed that we were still\nbeing watched, even here among the highlands, by the Bag-jagderags\nwho had followed us. And when we put to sea once more a boatload of\nthem proceeded to go ahead of us in the direction of Popsipetel.\nHaving lighter canoes, they traveled faster than our party; and we\njudged that they should reach the village\u00e2\u0080\u0094if that was where they were\ngoing\u00e2\u0080\u0094many hours before we could.\n\nThe Doctor was now becoming anxious to see how Long Arrow was getting\non, so we all took turns at the paddles and went on traveling by\nmoonlight through the whole night.\n\nWe reached Popsipetel just as the dawn was breaking.\n\nTo our great surprise we found that not only we, but the whole village\nalso, had been up all night. A great crowd was gathered about the dead\nchief\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house. And as we landed our canoes upon the beach we saw a\nlarge number of old men, the seniors of the tribe, coming out at the\nmain door.\n\nWe inquired what was the meaning of all this; and were told that the\nelection of a new chief had been going on all through the whole night.\nBumpo asked the name of the new chief; but this, it seemed, had not yet\nbeen given out. It would be announced at mid-day.\n\nAs soon as the Doctor had paid a visit to Long Arrow and seen that he\nwas doing nicely, we proceeded to our own house at the far end of the\nvillage. Here we ate some breakfast and then lay down to take a good\nrest.\n\nRest, indeed, we needed; for life had been strenuous and busy for us\never since we had landed on the island. And it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t many minutes\nafter our weary heads struck the pillows that the whole crew of us were\nsound asleep.\n\n\n\n\n_THE NINTH CHAPTER_\n\nTHE ELECTION\n\n\nWE were awakened by music. The glaring noonday sunlight was streaming\nin at our door, outside of which some kind of a band appeared to be\nplaying. We got up and looked out. Our house was surrounded by the\nwhole population of Popsipetel. We were used to having quite a number\nof curious and admiring Indians waiting at our door at all hours;\nbut this was quite different. The vast crowd was dressed in its best\nclothes. Bright beads, gawdy feathers and gay blankets gave cheerful\ncolor to the scene. Every one seemed in very good humor, singing or\nplaying on musical instruments\u00e2\u0080\u0094mostly painted wooden whistles or drums\nmade from skins.\n\nWe found Polynesia\u00e2\u0080\u0094who while we slept had arrived back from\nBag-jagderag\u00e2\u0080\u0094sitting on our door-post watching the show. We asked her\nwhat all the holiday-making was about.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe result of the election has just been announced,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe\nname of the new chief was given out at noon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd who is the new chief?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the Doctor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polynesia quietly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_I!_\u00e2\u0080\u009d gasped the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, of all things!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the one\u00e2\u0080\u0094And what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve changed\nyour surname for you. They didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that Dolittle was a proper or\nrespectful name for a man who had done so much. So you are now to be\nknown as Jong Thinkalot. How do you like it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t _want_ to be a chief,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor in an irritable\nvoice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have hard work to get out of it now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nshe\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cunless you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re willing to put to sea again in one of their rickety\ncanoes. You see you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been elected not merely the Chief of the\nPopsipetels; you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re to be a king\u00e2\u0080\u0094the King of the whole of Spidermonkey\nIsland. The Bag-jagderags, who were so anxious to have you govern\nthem, sent spies and messengers ahead of you; and when they found that\nyou had been elected Chief of the Popsipetels overnight they were\nbitterly disappointed. However, rather than lose you altogether, the\nBag-jagderags were willing to give up their independence, and insisted\nthat they and their lands be united to the Popsipetels in order that\nyou could be made king of both. So now you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in for it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh Lord!\u00e2\u0080\u009d groaned the Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do wish they wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be so\nenthusiastic! Bother it, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t _want_ to be a king!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should think, Doctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099d feel rather proud and glad. I\nwish _I_ had a chance to be a king.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh I know it sounds grand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, pulling on his boots miserably.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the trouble is, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take up responsibilities and then just\ndrop them again when you feel like it. I have my own work to do.\nScarcely one moment have I had to give to natural history since I\nlanded on this island. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been doing some one else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business all the\ntime. And now they want me to go on doing it! Why, once I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m made King\nof the Popsipetels, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the end of me as a useful naturalist. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be\ntoo busy for anything. All I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be then is just a er\u00e2\u0080\u0094er\u00e2\u0080\u0094just a king.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bumpo. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy father is a king and has a\nhundred and twenty wives.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat would make it worse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009ca hundred and twenty times\nworse. I have my work to do. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be a king.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polynesia, \u00e2\u0080\u009chere come the head men to announce your\nelection. Hurry up and get your boots laced.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe throng before our door had suddenly parted asunder, making a long\nlane; and down this we now saw a group of personages coming towards us.\nThe man in front, a handsome old Indian with a wrinkled face, carried\nin his hands a wooden crown\u00e2\u0080\u0094a truly beautiful and gorgeous crown, even\nthough of wood. Wonderfully carved and painted, it had two lovely blue\nfeathers springing from the front of it. Behind the old man came eight\nstrong Indians bearing a litter, a sort of chair with long handles\nunderneath to carry it by.\n\nKneeling down on one knee, bending his head almost to the ground, the\nold man addressed the Doctor who now stood in the doorway putting on\nhis collar and tie.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Mighty One,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe bring you word from the Popsipetel\npeople. Great are your deeds beyond belief, kind is your heart and your\nwisdom, deeper than the sea. Our chief is dead. The people clamor for a\nworthy leader. Our old enemies, the Bag-jagderags are become, through\nyou, our brothers and good friends. They too desire to bask beneath the\nsunshine of your smile. Behold then, I bring to you the Sacred Crown of\nPopsipetel which, since ancient days when this island and its peoples\nwere one, beneath one monarch, has rested on no kingly brow. Oh Kindly\nOne, we are bidden by the united voices of the peoples of this land to\ncarry you to the Whispering Rocks, that there, with all respect and\nmajesty, you may be crowned our king\u00e2\u0080\u0094King of all the Moving Land.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe good Indians did not seem to have even considered the possibility\nof John Dolittle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s refusing. As for the poor Doctor, I never saw him so\nupset by anything. It was in fact the only time I have known him to\nget thoroughly fussed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh dear!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I heard him murmur, looking around wildly for some escape.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat _shall_ I do?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Did any of you see where I laid that stud of\nmine?\u00e2\u0080\u0094How on earth can I get this collar on without a stud? What a day\nthis is, to be sure!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Maybe it rolled under the bed, Bumpo\u00e2\u0080\u0094I do think\nthey might have given me a day or so to think it over in. Who ever\nheard of waking a man right out of his sleep, and telling him he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got\nto be a king, before he has even washed his face? Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any of you find\nit? Maybe you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re standing on it, Bumpo. Move your feet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother about your stud,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polynesia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will have to be\ncrowned without a collar. They won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know the difference.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI tell you I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to be crowned,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cnot if I\ncan help it. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make them a speech. Perhaps that will satisfy them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe turned back to the Indians at the door.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy friends,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not worthy of this great honor you would\ndo me. Little or no skill have I in the arts of kingcraft. Assuredly\namong your own brave men you will find many better fitted to lead you.\nFor this compliment, this confidence and trust, I thank you. But, I\npray you, do not think of me for such high duties which I could not\npossibly fulfil.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old man repeated his words to the people behind him in a louder\nvoice. Stolidly they shook their heads, moving not an inch. The old man\nturned back to the Doctor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are the chosen one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey will have none but you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nInto the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perplexed face suddenly there came a flash of hope.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go and see Long Arrow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he whispered to me. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps he will know\nof some way to get me out of this.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd asking the personages to excuse him a moment, he left them there,\nstanding at his door, and hurried off in the direction of Long Arrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhouse. I followed him.\n\nWe found our big friend lying on a grass bed outside his home, where he\nhad been moved that he might witness the holiday-making.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLong Arrow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor speaking quickly in eagle tongue so\nthat the bystanders should not overhear, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin dire peril I come to you\nfor help. These men would make me their king. If such a thing befall\nme, all the great work I hoped to do must go undone, for who is there\nunfreer than a king? I pray you speak with them and persuade their kind\nwell-meaning hearts that what they plan to do would be unwise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLong Arrow raised himself upon his elbow.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh Kindly One,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he (this seemed now to have become the usual\nmanner of address when speaking to the Doctor), \u00e2\u0080\u009csorely it grieves me\nthat the first wish you ask of me I should be unable to grant. Alas! I\ncan do nothing. These people have so set their hearts on keeping you\nfor king that if I tried to interfere they would drive me from their\nland and likely crown you in the end in any case. A king you must be,\nif only for a while. We must so arrange the business of governing that\nyou may have time to give to Nature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s secrets. Later we may be able to\nhit upon some plan to relieve you of the burden of the crown. But for\nnow you must be king. These people are a headstrong tribe and they will\nhave their way. There is no other course.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSadly the Doctor turned away from the bed and faced about. And there\nbehind him stood the old man again, the crown still held in his\nwrinkled hands and the royal litter waiting at his elbow. With a deep\nreverence the bearers motioned towards the seat of the chair, inviting\nthe white man to get in.\n\nOnce more the poor Doctor looked wildly, hopelessly about him for\nsome means of escape. For a moment I thought he was going to take to\nhis heels and run for it. But the crowd around us was far too thick\nand densely packed for anyone to break through it. A band of whistles\nand drums near by suddenly started the music of a solemn processional\nmarch. He turned back pleadingly again to Long Arrow in a last appeal\nfor help. But the big Indian merely shook his head and pointed, like\nthe bearers, to the waiting chair.\n\nAt last, almost in tears, John Dolittle stepped slowly into the litter\nand sat down. As he was hoisted on to the broad shoulders of the\nbearers I heard him still feebly muttering beneath his breath,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBotheration take it!\u00e2\u0080\u0094I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t _want_ to be a king!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFarewell!\u00e2\u0080\u009d called Long Arrow from his bed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand may good fortune ever\nstand within the shadow of your throne!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe comes!\u00e2\u0080\u0094He comes!\u00e2\u0080\u009d murmured the crowd. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAway! Away!\u00e2\u0080\u0094To the\nWhispering Rocks!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd as the procession formed up to leave the village, the crowd about\nus began hurrying off in the direction of the mountains to make sure of\ngood seats in the giant theatre where the crowning ceremony would take\nplace.\n\n\n\n\n_THE TENTH CHAPTER_\n\nTHE CORONATION OF KING JONG\n\n\nIN my long lifetime I have seen many grand and inspiring things, but\nnever anything that impressed me half as much as the sight of the\nWhispering Rocks as they looked on the day King Jong was crowned. As\nBumpo, Chee-Chee, Polynesia, Jip and I finally reached the dizzy edge\nof the great bowl and looked down inside it, it was like gazing over\na never-ending ocean of copper-colored faces; for every seat in the\ntheatre was filled, every man, woman and child in the island\u00e2\u0080\u0094including\nLong Arrow who had been carried up on his sick bed\u00e2\u0080\u0094was there to see the\nshow.\n\nYet not a sound, not a pin-drop, disturbed the solemn silence of the\nWhispering Rocks. It was quite creepy and sent chills running up and\ndown your spine. Bumpo told me afterwards that it took his breath away\ntoo much for him to speak, but that he hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t known before that there\nwere that many people in the world.\n\nAway down by the Table of the Throne stood a brand-new, brightly\ncolored totem-pole. All the Indian families had totem-poles and kept\nthem set up before the doors of their houses. The idea of a totem-pole\nis something like a door-plate or a visiting card. It represents in its\ncarvings the deeds and qualities of the family to which it belongs.\nThis one, beautifully decorated and much higher than any other, was the\nDolittle or, as it was to be henceforth called, the Royal Thinkalot\ntotem. It had nothing but animals on it, to signify the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great\nknowledge of creatures. And the animals chosen to be shown were those\nwhich to the Indians were supposed to represent good qualities of\ncharacter, such as, the deer for speed; the ox for perseverance; the\nfish for discretion, and so on. But at the top of the totem is always\nplaced the sign or animal by which the family is most proud to be\nknown. This, on the Thinkalot pole, was an enormous parrot, in memory\nof the famous Peace of the Parrots.\n\nThe Ivory Throne had been all polished with scented oil and it\nglistened whitely in the strong sunlight. At the foot of it there had\nbeen strewn great quantities of branches of flowering trees, which with\nthe new warmth of milder climates were now blossoming in the valleys of\nthe island.\n\nSoon we saw the royal litter, with the Doctor seated in it, slowly\nascending the winding steps of the Table. Reaching the flat top at\nlast, it halted and the Doctor stepped out upon the flowery carpet. So\nstill and perfect was the silence that even at that distance above I\ndistinctly heard a twig snap beneath his tread.\n\nWalking to the throne accompanied by the old man, the Doctor got up\nupon the stand and sat down. How tiny his little round figure looked\nwhen seen from that tremendous height! The throne had been made for\nlonger-legged kings; and when he was seated, his feet did not reach the\nground but dangled six inches from the top step.\n\nThen the old man turned round and looking up at the people began to\nspeak in a quiet even voice; but every word he said was easily heard in\nthe furthest corner of the Whispering Rocks.\n\nFirst he recited the names of all the great Popsipetel kings who\nin days long ago had been crowned in this ivory chair. He spoke of\nthe greatness of the Popsipetel people, of their triumphs, of their\nhardships. Then waving his hand towards the Doctor he began recounting\nthe things which this king-to-be had done. And I am bound to say that\nthey easily outmatched the deeds of those who had gone before him.\n\nAs soon as he started to speak of what the Doctor had achieved for the\ntribe, the people, still strictly silent, all began waving their right\nhands towards the throne. This gave to the vast theatre a very singular\nappearance: acres and acres of something moving\u00e2\u0080\u0094with never a sound.\n\nAt last the old man finished his speech and stepping up to the chair,\nvery respectfully removed the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s battered high hat. He was about\nto put it upon the ground; but the Doctor took it from him hastily and\nkept it on his lap. Then taking up the Sacred Crown he placed it upon\nJohn Dolittle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head. It did not fit very well (for it had been made\nfor smaller-headed kings), and when the wind blew in freshly from the\nsunlit sea the Doctor had some difficulty in keeping it on. But it\nlooked very splendid.\n\nTurning once more to the people, the old man said,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMen of Popsipetel, behold your elected king!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Are you content?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd then at last the voice of the people broke loose.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJONG! JONG!\u00e2\u0080\u009d they shouted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLONG LIVE KING JONG!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe sound burst upon the solemn silence with the crash of a hundred\ncannon. There, where even a whisper carried miles, the shock of it was\nlike a blow in the face. Back and forth the mountains threw it to one\nanother. I thought the echoes of it would never die away as it passed\nrumbling through the whole island, jangling among the lower valleys,\nbooming in the distant sea-caves.\n\nSuddenly I saw the old man point upward, to the highest mountain in the\nisland; and looking over my shoulder, I was just in time to see the\nHanging Stone topple slowly out of sight\u00e2\u0080\u0094down into the heart of the\nvolcano.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSee ye, Men of the Moving Land!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the old man cried: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe stone has\nfallen and our legend has come true: the King of Kings is crowned this\nday!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Doctor too had seen the stone fall and he was now standing up\nlooking at the sea expectantly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thinking of the air-chamber,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bumpo in my ear. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet us hope\nthat the sea isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very deep in these parts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAfter a full minute (so long did it take the stone to fall that depth)\nwe heard a muffled, distant, crunching thud\u00e2\u0080\u0094and then immediately after,\na great hissing of escaping air. The Doctor, his face tense with\nanxiety, sat down in the throne again still watching the blue water of\nthe ocean with staring eyes.\n\nSoon we felt the island slowly sinking beneath us. We saw the sea creep\ninland over the beaches as the shores went down\u00e2\u0080\u0094one foot, three feet,\nten feet, twenty, fifty, a hundred. And then, thank goodness, gently as\na butterfly alighting on a rose, it stopped! Spidermonkey Island had\ncome to rest on the sandy bottom of the Atlantic, and earth was joined\nto earth once more.\n\nOf course many of the houses near the shores were now under water.\nPopsipetel Village itself had entirely disappeared. But it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nmatter. No one was drowned; for every soul in the island was high up\nin the hills watching the coronation of King Jong.\n\nThe Indians themselves did not realize at the time what was taking\nplace, though of course they had felt the land sinking beneath them.\nThe Doctor told us afterwards that it must have been the shock of that\ntremendous shout, coming from a million throats at once, which had\ntoppled the Hanging Stone off its perch. But in Popsipetel history the\nstory was handed down (and it is firmly believed to this day) that when\nKing Jong sat upon the throne, so great was his mighty weight, that the\nvery island itself sank down to do him honor and never moved again.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nPART SIX\n\n\n\n\n_THE FIRST CHAPTER_\n\nNEW POPSIPETEL\n\n\nJONG THINKALOT had not ruled over his new kingdom for more than a\ncouple of days before my notions about kings and the kind of lives they\nled changed very considerably. I had thought that all that kings had to\ndo was to sit on a throne and have people bow down before them several\ntimes a day. I now saw that a king can be the hardest-working man in\nthe world\u00e2\u0080\u0094if he attends properly to his business.\n\nFrom the moment that he got up, early in the morning, till the time he\nwent to bed, late at night\u00e2\u0080\u0094seven days in the week\u00e2\u0080\u0094John Dolittle was\nbusy, busy, busy. First of all there was the new town to be built. The\nvillage of Popsipetel had disappeared: the City of New Popsipetel must\nbe made. With great care a place was chosen for it\u00e2\u0080\u0094and a very beautiful\nposition it was, at the mouth of a large river. The shores of the\nisland at this point formed a lovely wide bay where canoes\u00e2\u0080\u0094and ships\ntoo, if they should ever come\u00e2\u0080\u0094could lie peacefully at anchor without\ndanger from storms.\n\nIn building this town the Doctor gave the Indians a lot of new\nideas. He showed them what town-sewers were, and how garbage should\nbe collected each day and burnt. High up in the hills he made a large\nlake by damming a stream. This was the water-supply for the town. None\nof these things had the Indians ever seen; and many of the sicknesses\nwhich they had suffered from before were now entirely prevented by\nproper drainage and pure drinking-water.\n\nPeoples who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use fire do not of course have metals either; because\nwithout fire it is almost impossible to shape iron and steel. One of\nthe first things that John Dolittle did was to search the mountains\ntill he found iron and copper mines. Then he set to work to teach the\nIndians how these metals could be melted and made into knives and plows\nand water-pipes and all manner of things.\n\nIn his kingdom the Doctor tried his hardest to do away with most of the\nold-fashioned pomp and grandeur of a royal court. As he said to Bumpo\nand me, if he must be a king he meant to be a thoroughly democratic\none, that is a king who is chummy and friendly with his subjects and\ndoesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put on airs. And when he drew up the plans for the City of New\nPopsipetel he had no palace shown of any kind. A little cottage in a\nback street was all that he had provided for himself.\n\nBut this the Indians would not permit on any account. They had been\nused to having their kings rule in a truly grand and kingly manner;\nand they insisted that he have built for himself the most magnificent\npalace ever seen. In all else they let him have his own way absolutely;\nbut they wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t allow him to wriggle out of any of the ceremony or\nshow that goes with being a king. A thousand servants he had to keep in\nhis palace, night and day, to wait on him. The Royal Canoe had to be\nkept up\u00e2\u0080\u0094a gorgeous, polished mahogany boat, seventy feet long, inlaid\nwith mother-o\u00e2\u0080\u0099-pearl and paddled by the hundred strongest men in the\nisland. The palace-gardens covered a square mile and employed a hundred\nand sixty gardeners.\n\nEven in his dress the poor man was compelled always to be grand and\nelegant and uncomfortable. The beloved and battered high hat was put\naway in a closet and only looked at secretly. State robes had to be\nworn on all occasions. And when the Doctor did once in a while manage\nto sneak off for a short, natural-history expedition he never dared to\nwear his old clothes, but had to chase his butterflies with a crown\nupon his head and a scarlet cloak flying behind him in the wind.\n\nThere was no end to the kinds of duties the Doctor had to perform and\nthe questions he had to decide upon\u00e2\u0080\u0094everything, from settling disputes\nabout lands and boundaries, to making peace between husband and wife\nwho had been throwing shoes at one another. In the east wing of the\nRoyal Palace was the Hall of Justice. And here King Jong sat every\nmorning from nine to eleven passing judgment on all cases that were\nbrought before him.\n\n[Illustration: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHad to chase his butterflies with a crown upon his\nhead\u00e2\u0080\u009d]\n\nThen in the afternoon he taught school. The sort of things he taught\nwere not always those you find in ordinary schools. Grown-ups as well\nas children came to learn. You see, these Indians were ignorant of many\nof the things that quite small white children know\u00e2\u0080\u0094though it is also\ntrue that they knew a lot that white grown-ups never dreamed of.\n\nBumpo and I helped with the teaching as far as we could\u00e2\u0080\u0094simple\narithmetic, and easy things like that. But the classes in astronomy,\nfarming science, the proper care of babies, with a host of other\nsubjects, the Doctor had to teach himself. The Indians were\ntremendously keen about the schooling and they came in droves and\ncrowds; so that even with the open-air classes (a school-house was\nimpossible of course) the Doctor had to take them in relays and batches\nof five or six thousand at a time and used a big megaphone or trumpet\nto make himself heard.\n\nThe rest of his day was more than filled with road-making, building\nwater-mills, attending the sick and a million other things.\n\nIn spite of his being so unwilling to become a king, John Dolittle\nmade a very good one\u00e2\u0080\u0094once he got started. He may not have been as\ndignified as many kings in history who were always running off to war\nand getting themselves into romantic situations; but since I have grown\nup and seen something of foreign lands and governments I have often\nthought that Popsipetel under the reign of Jong Thinkalot was perhaps\nthe best ruled state in the history of the world.\n\nThe Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s birthday came round after we had been on the island\nsix months and a half. The people made a great public holiday of it\nand there was much feasting, dancing, fireworks, speechmaking and\njollification.\n\nTowards the close of the day the chief men of the two tribes formed a\nprocession and passed through the streets of the town, carrying a very\ngorgeously painted tablet of ebony wood, ten feet high. This was a\npicture-history, such as they preserved for each of the ancient kings\nof Popsipetel to record their deeds.\n\nWith great and solemn ceremony it was set up over the door of the new\npalace: and everybody then clustered round to look at it. It had six\npictures on it commemorating the six great events in the life of King\nJong and beneath were written the verses that explained them. They were\ncomposed by the Court Poet; and this is a translation:\n\n\nI\n\n(_His Landing on The Island_)\n\n    Heaven-sent,\n    In his dolphin-drawn canoe\n    From worlds unknown\n    He landed on our shores.\n    The very palms\n    Bowed down their heads\n    In welcome to the coming King.\n\n\nII\n\n(_His Meeting With The Beetle_)\n\n    By moonlight in the mountains\n    He communed with beasts.\n    The shy Jabizri brings him picture-words\n    Of great distress.\n\n\nIII\n\n(_He liberates The Lost Families_)\n\n    Big was his heart with pity;\n    Big were his hands with strength.\n    See how he tears the mountain like a yam!\n    See how the lost ones\n    Dance forth to greet the day!\n\n\nIV\n\n(_He Makes Fire_)\n\n    Our land was cold and dying.\n    He waved his hand and lo!\n    Lightning leapt from cloudless skies;\n    The sun leant down;\n    And Fire was born!\n    Then while we crowded round\n    The grateful glow, pushed he\n    Our wayward, floating land\n    Back to peaceful anchorage\n    In sunny seas.\n\n\nV\n\n(_He Leads The People To Victory in War_)\n\n    Once only\n    Was his kindly countenance\n    Darkened by a deadly frown.\n    Woe to the wicked enemy\n    That dares attack\n    The tribe with Thinkalot for Chief!\n\n\nVI\n\n(_He Is Crowned King_)\n\n    The birds of the air rejoiced;\n    The Sea laughed and gambolled with her shores;\n    All Red-skins wept for joy\n    The day we crowned him King.\n    He is the Builder, the Healer, the Teacher and the Prince;\n    He is the greatest of them all.\n    May he live a thousand thousand years,\n    Happy in his heart,\n    To bless our land with Peace.\n\n\n\n\n_THE SECOND CHAPTER_\n\nTHOUGHTS OF HOME\n\n\nIN the Royal Palace Bumpo and I had a beautiful suite of rooms of our\nvery own\u00e2\u0080\u0094which Polynesia, Jip and Chee-Chee shared with us. Officially\nBumpo was Minister of the Interior; while I was First Lord of the\nTreasury. Long Arrow also had quarters there; but at present he was\nabsent, traveling abroad.\n\nOne night after supper when the Doctor was away in the town somewhere\nvisiting a new-born baby, we were all sitting round the big table in\nBumpo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reception-room. This we did every evening, to talk over the\nplans for the following day and various affairs of state. It was a kind\nof Cabinet Meeting.\n\nTo-night however we were talking about England\u00e2\u0080\u0094and also about things\nto eat. We had got a little tired of Indian food. You see, none of\nthe natives knew how to cook; and we had the most discouraging time\ntraining a chef for the Royal Kitchen. Most of them were champions at\nspoiling good food. Often we got so hungry that the Doctor would sneak\ndownstairs with us into the palace basement, after all the cooks were\nsafe in bed, and fry pancakes secretly over the dying embers of the\nfire. The Doctor himself was the finest cook that ever lived. But he\nused to make a terrible mess of the kitchen; and of course we had to be\nawfully careful that we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get caught.\n\nWell, as I was saying, to-night food was the subject of discussion at\nthe Cabinet Meeting; and I had just been reminding Bumpo of the nice\ndishes we had had at the bed-maker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house in Monteverde.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI tell you what I would like now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bumpo: \u00e2\u0080\u009ca large cup of cocoa\nwith whipped cream on the top of it. In Oxford we used to be able to\nget the most wonderful cocoa. It is really too bad they haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any\ncocoa-trees in this island, or cows to give cream.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen do you suppose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Jip, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Doctor intends to move on from\nhere?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was talking to him about that only yesterday,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polynesia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut\nI couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get any satisfactory answer out of him. He didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to\nwant to speak about it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was a pause in the conversation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you know what I believe?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added presently. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe the\nDoctor has given up even thinking of going home.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood Lord!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Bumpo. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polynesia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that noise?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe listened; and away off in the distant corridors of the palace we\nheard the sentries crying,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe King!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Make way!\u00e2\u0080\u0094The King!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s he\u00e2\u0080\u0094at last,\u00e2\u0080\u009d whispered Polynesia\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009clate, as usual. Poor man, how\nhe does work!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Chee-Chee, get the pipe and tobacco out of the cupboard\nand lay the dressing-gown ready on his chair.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen the Doctor came into the room he looked serious and thoughtful.\nWearily he took off his crown and hung it on a peg behind the door.\nThen he exchanged the royal cloak for the dressing-gown, dropped into\nhis chair at the head of the table with a deep sigh and started to fill\nhis pipe.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Polynesia quietly, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow did you find the baby?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe baby?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he murmured\u00e2\u0080\u0094his thoughts still seemed to be very far\naway\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh yes. The baby was much better, thank you\u00e2\u0080\u0094It has cut its second\ntooth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen he was silent again, staring dreamily at the ceiling through a\ncloud of tobacco-smoke; while we all sat round quite still, waiting.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe were wondering, Doctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I at last,\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cjust before you came\nin\u00e2\u0080\u0094when you would be starting home again. We will have been on this\nisland seven months to-morrow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Doctor sat forward in his chair looking rather uncomfortable.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, as a matter of fact,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he after a moment, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI meant to speak\nto you myself this evening on that very subject. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u0094er\u00e2\u0080\u0094a little\nhard to make any one exactly understand the situation. I am afraid\nthat it would be impossible for me to leave the work I am now engaged\non.... You remember, when they first insisted on making me king, I told\nyou it was not easy to shake off responsibilities, once you had taken\nthem up. These people have come to rely on me for a great number of\nthings. We found them ignorant of much that white people enjoy. And we\nhave, one might say, changed the current of their lives considerably.\nNow it is a very ticklish business, to change the lives of other\npeople. And whether the changes we have made will be, in the end, for\ngood or for bad, is our lookout.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe thought a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0094then went on in a quieter, sadder voice:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would like to continue my voyages and my natural history work; and\nI would like to go back to Puddleby\u00e2\u0080\u0094as much as any of you. This is\nMarch, and the crocuses will be showing in the lawn.... But that which\nI feared has come true: I cannot close my eyes to what might happen if\nI should leave these people and run away. They would probably go back\nto their old habits and customs: wars, superstitions, devil-worship and\nwhat not; and many of the new things we have taught them might be put\nto improper use and make their condition, then, worse by far than that\nin which we found them.... They like me; they trust me; they have come\nto look to me for help in all their problems and troubles. And no man\nwants to do unfair things to them who trust him.... And then again, _I_\nlike _them_. They are, as it were, my children\u00e2\u0080\u0094I never had any children\nof my own\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I am terribly interested in how they will grow up. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nyou see what I mean?\u00e2\u0080\u0094How can I possibly run away and leave them in the\nlurch?... No. I have thought it over a good deal and tried to decide\nwhat was best. And I am afraid that the work I took up when I assumed\nthe crown I must stick to. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to stay.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor good\u00e2\u0080\u0094for your whole life?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Bumpo in a low voice.\n\nFor some moments the Doctor, frowning, made no answer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said at last\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnyhow for the present there is\ncertainly no hope of my leaving. It wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe sad silence that followed was broken finally by a knock upon the\ndoor.\n\nWith a patient sigh the Doctor got up and put on his crown and cloak\nagain.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he called, sitting down in his chair once more.\n\nThe door opened and a footman\u00e2\u0080\u0094one of the hundred and forty-three who\nwere always on night duty\u00e2\u0080\u0094stood bowing in the entrance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Kindly One,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is a traveler at the palace-gate who\nwould have speech with Your Majesty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnother baby\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been born, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll bet a shilling,\u00e2\u0080\u009d muttered Polynesia.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you ask the traveler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name?\u00e2\u0080\u009d enquired the Doctor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, Your Majesty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the footman. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is Long Arrow, the son of\nGolden Arrow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n_THE THIRD CHAPTER_\n\nTHE RED MAN\u00e2\u0080\u0099S SCIENCE\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLONG ARROW!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow splendid! Show him in\u00e2\u0080\u0094show him in\nat once.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so glad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, turning to us as soon as the footman had\ngone. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve missed Long Arrow terribly. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an awfully good man to\nhave around\u00e2\u0080\u0094even if he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk much. Let me see: it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s five months\nnow since he went off to Brazil. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so glad he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back safe. He does\ntake such tremendous chances with that canoe of his\u00e2\u0080\u0094clever as he is.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no joke, crossing a hundred miles of open sea in a twelve-foot\ncanoe. I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care to try it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnother knock; and when the door swung open in answer to the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncall, there stood our big friend on the threshold, a smile upon his\nstrong, bronzed face. Behind him appeared two porters carrying loads\ndone up in Indian palm-matting. These, when the first salutations were\nover, Long Arrow ordered to lay their burdens down.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBehold, oh Kindly One,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI bring you, as I promised, my\ncollection of plants which I had hidden in a cave in the Andes. These\ntreasures represent the labors of my life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe packages were opened; and inside were many smaller packages and\nbundles. Carefully they were laid out in rows upon the table.\n\nIt appeared at first a large but disappointing display. There were\nplants, flowers, fruits, leaves, roots, nuts, beans, honeys, gums,\nbark, seeds, bees and a few kinds of insects.\n\nThe study of plants\u00e2\u0080\u0094or botany, as it is called\u00e2\u0080\u0094was a kind of natural\nhistory which had never interested me very much. I had considered it,\ncompared with the study of animals, a dull science. But as Long Arrow\nbegan taking up the various things in his collection and explaining\ntheir qualities to us, I became more and more fascinated. And before\nhe had done I was completely absorbed by the wonders of the Vegetable\nKingdom which he had brought so far.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, taking up a little packet of big seeds, \u00e2\u0080\u009care what I\nhave called laughing-beans.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are they for?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Bumpo.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo cause mirth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Indian.\n\nBumpo, while Long Arrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back was turned, took three of the beans and\nswallowed them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Indian when he discovered what Bumpo had done. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf he\nwished to try the powers of these seeds he should have eaten no more\nthan a quarter of a one. Let us hope that he does not die of laughter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe beans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 effect upon Bumpo was most extraordinary. First he broke\ninto a broad smile; then he began to giggle; finally he burst into\nsuch prolonged roars of hearty laughter that we had to carry him into\nthe next room and put him to bed. The Doctor said afterwards that he\nprobably would have died laughing if he had not had such a strong\nconstitution. All through the night he gurgled happily in his sleep.\nAnd even when we woke him up the next morning he rolled out of bed\nstill chuckling.\n\nReturning to the Reception Room, we were shown some red roots which\nLong Arrow told us had the property, when made into a soup with sugar\nand salt, of causing people to dance with extraordinary speed and\nendurance. He asked us to try them; but we refused, thanking him. After\nBumpo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exhibition we were a little afraid of any more experiments for\nthe present.\n\nThere was no end to the curious and useful things that Long Arrow\nhad collected: an oil from a vine which would make hair grow in one\nnight; an orange as big as a pumpkin which he had raised in his own\nmountain-garden in Peru; a black honey (he had brought the bees that\nmade it too and the seeds of the flowers they fed on) which would put\nyou to sleep, just with a teaspoonful, and make you wake up fresh\nin the morning; a nut that made the voice beautiful for singing;\na water-weed that stopped cuts from bleeding; a moss that cured\nsnake-bite; a lichen that prevented sea-sickness.\n\nThe Doctor of course was tremendously interested. Well into the early\nhours of the morning he was busy going over the articles on the table\none by one, listing their names and writing their properties and\ndescriptions into a note-book as Long Arrow dictated.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are things here, Stubbins,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said as he ended, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich in the\nhands of skilled druggists will make a vast difference to the medicine\nand chemistry of the world. I suspect that this sleeping-honey by\nitself will take the place of half the bad drugs we have had to use so\nfar. Long Arrow has discovered a pharmacop\u00c3\u00a6ia of his own. Miranda was\nright: he is a great naturalist. His name deserves to be placed beside\nLinn\u00c3\u00a6us. Some day I must get all these things to England\u00e2\u0080\u0094But when,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nadded sadly\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the problem: when?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n_THE FOURTH CHAPTER_\n\nTHE SEA-SERPENT\n\n\nFOR a long time after that Cabinet Meeting of which I have just told\nyou we did not ask the Doctor anything further about going home. Life\nin Spidermonkey Island went forward, month in month out, busily and\npleasantly. The Winter, with Christmas celebrations, came and went, and\nSummer was with us once again before we knew it.\n\nAs time passed the Doctor became more and more taken up with the care\nof his big family; and the hours he could spare for his natural history\nwork grew fewer and fewer. I knew that he often still thought of his\nhouse and garden in Puddleby and of his old plans and ambitions;\nbecause once in a while we would notice his face grow thoughtful and a\nlittle sad, when something reminded him of England or his old life. But\nhe never spoke of these things. And I truly believe he would have spent\nthe remainder of his days on Spidermonkey Island if it hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been for\nan accident\u00e2\u0080\u0094and for Polynesia.\n\nThe old parrot had grown very tired of the Indians and she made no\nsecret of it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe very idea,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said to me one day as we were walking on the\nseashore\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe idea of the famous John Dolittle spending his valuable\nlife waiting on these greasy natives!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Why, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s preposterous!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAll that morning we had been watching the Doctor superintend the\nbuilding of the new theatre in Popsipetel\u00e2\u0080\u0094there was already an\nopera-house and a concert-hall; and finally she had got so grouchy and\nannoyed at the sight that I had suggested her taking a walk with me.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you really think,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked as we sat down on the sands, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat he\nwill never go back to Puddleby again?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt one time I felt sure that the thought\nof the pets he had left behind at the house would take him home soon.\nBut since Miranda brought him word last August that everything was all\nright there, that hope\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone. For months and months I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been racking\nmy brains to think up a plan. If we could only hit upon something that\nwould turn his thoughts back to natural history again\u00e2\u0080\u0094I mean something\nbig enough to get him really excited\u00e2\u0080\u0094we might manage it. But how?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094she\nshrugged her shoulders in disgust\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow?\u00e2\u0080\u0094when all he thinks of now is\npaving streets and teaching papooses that twice one are two!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was a perfect Popsipetel day, bright and hot, blue and yellow.\nDrowsily I looked out to sea thinking of my mother and father. I\nwondered if they were getting anxious over my long absence. Beside me\nold Polynesia went on grumbling away in low steady tones; and her words\nbegan to mingle and mix with the gentle lapping of the waves upon the\nshore. It may have been the even murmur of her voice, helped by the\nsoft and balmy air, that lulled me to sleep. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know. Anyhow I\npresently dreamed that the island had moved again\u00e2\u0080\u0094not floatingly as\nbefore, but suddenly, jerkily, as though something enormously powerful\nhad heaved it up from its bed just once and let it down.\n\nHow long I slept after that I have no idea. I was awakened by a gentle\npecking on the nose.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTommy!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Tommy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d (it was Polynesia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice) \u00e2\u0080\u009cWake up!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Gosh, what a boy,\nto sleep through an earthquake and never notice it!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Tommy, listen:\nhere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our chance now. Wake _up_, for goodness\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sake!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the matter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked sitting up with a yawn.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSh!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Look!\u00e2\u0080\u009d whispered Polynesia pointing out to sea.\n\nStill only half awake, I stared before me with bleary, sleep-laden\neyes. And in the shallow water, not more than thirty yards from shore\nI saw an enormous pale pink shell. Dome-shaped, it towered up in a\ngraceful rainbow curve to a tremendous height; and round its base the\nsurf broke gently in little waves of white. It could have belonged to\nthe wildest dream.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat in the world is it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d whispered Polynesia, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis what sailors for hundreds of years\nhave called the _Sea-serpent_. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen it myself more than once from\nthe decks of ships, at long range, curving in and out of the water.\nBut now that I see it close and still, I very strongly suspect that\nthe Sea-serpent of history is no other than the Great Glass Sea-snail\nthat the fidgit told us of. If that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the only fish of its kind in\nthe seven seas, call me a carrion-crow\u00e2\u0080\u0094Tommy, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in luck. Our job\nis to get the Doctor down here to look at that prize specimen before\nit moves off to the Deep Hole. If we can, then trust me, we may leave\nthis blessed island yet. You stay here and keep an eye on it while I\ngo after the Doctor. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t move or speak\u00e2\u0080\u0094don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even breathe heavy: he\nmight get scared\u00e2\u0080\u0094awful timid things, snails. Just watch him; and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nbe back in two shakes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nStealthily creeping up the sands till she could get behind the cover\nof some bushes before she took to her wings, Polynesia went off in\nthe direction of the town; while I remained alone upon the shore\nfascinatedly watching this unbelievable monster wallowing in the\nshallow sea.\n\nIt moved very little. From time to time it lifted its head out of the\nwater showing its enormously long neck and horns. Occasionally it\nwould try and draw itself up, the way a snail does when he goes to\nmove, but almost at once it would sink down again as if exhausted. It\nseemed to me to act as though it were hurt underneath; but the lower\npart of it, which was below the level of the water, I could not see.\n\nI was still absorbed in watching the great beast when Polynesia\nreturned with the Doctor. They approached so silently and so cautiously\nthat I neither saw nor heard them coming till I found them crouching\nbeside me on the sand.\n\nOne sight of the snail changed the Doctor completely. His eyes just\nsparkled with delight. I had not seen him so thrilled and happy since\nthe time we caught the Jabizri beetle when we first landed on the\nisland.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is he!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he whispered\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Great Glass Sea-snail himself\u00e2\u0080\u0094not a doubt\nof it. Polynesia, go down the shore a way and see if you can find any\nof the porpoises for me. Perhaps they can tell us what the snail is\ndoing here\u00e2\u0080\u0094It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very unusual for him to be in shallow water like this.\nAnd Stubbins, you go over to the harbor and bring me a small canoe. But\nbe most careful how you paddle it round into this bay. If the snail\nshould take fright and go out into the deeper water, we may never get a\nchance to see him again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell any of the Indians,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Polynesia added in a whisper as\nI moved to go. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe must keep this a secret or we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have a crowd of\nsightseers round here in five minutes. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mighty lucky we found the\nsnail in a quiet bay.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nReaching the harbor, I picked out a small light canoe from among the\nnumber that were lying there and without telling any one what I wanted\nit for, got in and started off to paddle it down the shore.\n\nI was mortally afraid that the snail might have left before I got back.\nAnd you can imagine how delighted I was, when I rounded a rocky cape\nand came in sight of the bay, to find he was still there.\n\nPolynesia, I saw, had got her errand done and returned ahead of me,\nbringing with her a pair of porpoises. These were already conversing in\nlow tones with John Dolittle. I beached the canoe and went up to listen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat I want to know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Doctor was saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis how the snail comes\nto be here. I was given to understand that he usually stayed in the\nDeep Hole; and that when he did come to the surface it was always in\nmid-ocean.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you know?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you heard?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the porpoises replied: \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\ncovered up the Deep Hole when you sank the island. Why yes: you let it\ndown right on top of the mouth of the Hole\u00e2\u0080\u0094sort of put the lid on, as\nit were. The fishes that were in it at the time have been trying to get\nout ever since. The Great Snail had the worst luck of all: the island\nnipped him by the tail just as he was leaving the Hole for a quiet\nevening stroll. And he was held there for six months trying to wriggle\nhimself free. Finally he had to heave the whole island up at one end to\nget his tail loose. Didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you feel a sort of an earthquake shock about\nan hour ago?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes I did,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit shook down part of the theatre I was\nbuilding.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, that was the snail heaving up the island to get out of the\nHole,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll the other fishes saw their chance and escaped\nwhen he raised the lid. It was lucky for them he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so big and strong.\nBut the strain of that terrific heave told on him: he sprained a muscle\nin his tail and it started swelling rather badly. He wanted some quiet\nplace to rest up; and seeing this soft beach handy he crawled in here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDear me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m terribly sorry. I suppose I should\nhave given some sort of notice that the island was going to be let\ndown. But, to tell the truth, we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know it ourselves; it happened\nby a kind of an accident. Do you imagine the poor fellow is hurt very\nbadly?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the porpoises; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause none of us can speak his\nlanguage. But we swam right around him on our way in here, and he did\nnot seem to be really seriously injured.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any of your people speak shellfish?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Doctor asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot a word,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said they. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a most frightfully difficult language.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you think that you might be able to find me some kind of a fish\nthat could?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the porpoises. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe might try.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should be extremely grateful to you if you would,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are many important questions I want to ask this snail\u00e2\u0080\u0094And\nbesides, I would like to do my best to cure his tail for him. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the\nleast I can do. After all, it was my fault, indirectly, that he got\nhurt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, if you wait here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the porpoises, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see what can be\ndone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n_THE FIFTH CHAPTER_\n\nTHE SHELLFISH RIDDLE SOLVED AT LAST\n\n\nSO Doctor Dolittle with a crown on his head sat down upon the shore\nlike King Knut, and waited. And for a whole hour the porpoises kept\ngoing and coming, bringing up different kinds of sea-beasts from the\ndeep to see if they could help him.\n\nMany and curious were the creatures they produced. It would seem\nhowever that there were very few things that spoke shellfish except\nthe shellfish themselves. Still, the porpoises grew a little more\nhopeful when they discovered a very old sea-urchin (a funny, ball-like,\nlittle fellow with long whiskers all over him) who said he could not\nspeak pure shellfish, but he used to understand starfish\u00e2\u0080\u0094enough to get\nalong\u00e2\u0080\u0094when he was young. This was coming nearer, even if it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nanything to go crazy about. Leaving the urchin with us, the porpoises\nwent off once more to hunt up a starfish.\n\nThey were not long getting one, for they were quite common in those\nparts. Then, using the sea-urchin as an interpreter, they questioned\nthe starfish. He was a rather stupid sort of creature; but he tried his\nbest to be helpful. And after a little patient examination we found to\nour delight that he could speak shellfish moderately well.\n\nFeeling quite encouraged, the Doctor and I now got into the canoe; and,\nwith the porpoises, the urchin and the starfish swimming alongside, we\npaddled very gently out till we were close under the towering shell of\nthe Great Snail.\n\nAnd then began the most curious conversation I have ever witnessed.\nFirst the starfish would ask the snail something; and whatever answer\nthe snail gave, the starfish would tell it to the sea-urchin, the\nurchin would tell it to the porpoises and the porpoises would tell it\nto the Doctor.\n\nIn this way we obtained considerable information, mostly about the very\nancient history of the Animal Kingdom; but we missed a good many of the\nfiner points in the snail\u00e2\u0080\u0099s longer speeches on account of the stupidity\nof the starfish and all this translating from one language to another.\n\nWhile the snail was speaking, the Doctor and I put our ears against the\nwall of his shell and found that we could in this way hear the sound of\nhis voice quite plainly. It was, as the fidgit had described, deep and\nbell-like. But of course we could not understand a single word he said.\nHowever the Doctor was by this time terrifically excited about getting\nnear to learning the language he had sought so long. And presently by\nmaking the other fishes repeat over and over again short phrases which\nthe snail used, he began to put words together for himself. You see,\nhe was already familiar with one or two fish languages; and that helped\nhim quite a little. After he had practised for a while like this he\nleant over the side of the canoe and putting his face below the water,\ntried speaking to the snail direct.\n\nIt was hard and difficult work; and hours went by before he got any\nresults. But presently I could tell by the happy look on his face that\nlittle by little he was succeeding.\n\nThe sun was low in the West and the cool evening breeze was beginning\nto rustle softly through the bamboo-groves when the Doctor finally\nturned from his work and said to me,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStubbins, I have persuaded the snail to come in on to the dry part of\nthe beach and let me examine his tail. Will you please go back to the\ntown and tell the workmen to stop working on the theatre for to-day?\nThen go on to the palace and get my medicine-bag. I think I left it\nunder the throne in the Audience Chamber.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd remember,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Polynesia whispered as I turned away, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot a word to\na soul. If you get asked questions, keep your mouth shut. Pretend you\nhave a toothache or something.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis time when I got back to the shore\u00e2\u0080\u0094with the medicine-bag\u00e2\u0080\u0094I found\nthe snail high and dry on the beach. Seeing him in his full length like\nthis, it was easy to understand how old-time, superstitious sailors\nhad called him the Sea-serpent. He certainly was a most gigantic, and\nin his way, a graceful, beautiful creature. John Dolittle was examining\na swelling on his tail.\n\nFrom the bag which I had brought the Doctor took a large bottle of\nembrocation and began rubbing the sprain. Next he took all the bandages\nhe had in the bag and fastened them end to end. But even like that,\nthey were not long enough to go more than halfway round the enormous\ntail. The Doctor insisted that he must get the swelling strapped tight\nsomehow. So he sent me off to the palace once more to get all the\nsheets from the Royal Linen-closet. These Polynesia and I tore into\nbandages for him. And at last, after terrific exertions, we got the\nsprain strapped to his satisfaction.\n\nThe snail really seemed to be quite pleased with the attention he had\nreceived; and he stretched himself in lazy comfort when the Doctor was\ndone. In this position, when the shell on his back was empty, you could\nlook right through it and see the palm-trees on the other side.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think one of us had better sit up with him all night,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nDoctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe might put Bumpo on that duty; he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been napping all day, I\nknow\u00e2\u0080\u0094in the summer-house. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pretty bad sprain, that; and if the\nsnail shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to sleep, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be happier with some one with\nhim for company. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get all right though\u00e2\u0080\u0094in a few days I should\njudge. If I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so confoundedly busy I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d sit up with him myself. I\nwish I could, because I still have a lot of things to talk over with\nhim.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut Doctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polynesia as we prepared to go back to the town,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cyou ought to take a holiday. All Kings take holidays once in the\nwhile\u00e2\u0080\u0094every one of them. King Charles, for instance\u00e2\u0080\u0094of course Charles\nwas before your time\u00e2\u0080\u0094but he!\u00e2\u0080\u0094why, he was _always_ holiday-making. Not\nthat he was ever what you would call a model king. But just the same,\nhe was frightfully popular. Everybody liked him\u00e2\u0080\u0094even the golden-carp in\nthe fish-pond at Hampton Court. As a king, the only thing I had against\nhim was his inventing those stupid, little, snappy dogs they call King\nCharles Spaniels. There are lots of stories told about poor Charles;\nbut that, in my opinion, is the worst thing he did. However, all this\nis beside the point. As I was saying, kings have to take holidays the\nsame as anybody else. And you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t taken one since you were crowned,\nhave you now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell now I tell you what you do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she: \u00e2\u0080\u009cas soon as you get back\nto the palace you publish a royal proclamation that you are going away\nfor a week into the country for your health. And you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going _without\nany servants_, you understand\u00e2\u0080\u0094just like a plain person. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s called\ntraveling incognito, when kings go off like that. They all do it\u00e2\u0080\u0094It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nthe only way they can ever have a good time. Then the week you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re away\nyou can spend lolling on the beach back there with the snail. How\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nthat?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt sounds most attractive. But there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nthat new theatre to be built; none of our carpenters would know how to\nget those rafters on without me to show them\u00e2\u0080\u0094And then there are the\nbabies: these native mothers are so frightfully ignorant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh bother the theatre\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the babies too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d snapped Polynesia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe\ntheatre can wait a week. And as for babies, they never have anything\nmore than colic. How do you suppose babies got along before you came\nhere, for heaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Take a holiday.... You need it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n_THE SIXTH CHAPTER_\n\nTHE LAST CABINET MEETING\n\n\nFROM the way Polynesia talked, I guessed that this idea of a holiday\nwas part of her plan.\n\nThe Doctor made no reply; and we walked on silently towards the town. I\ncould see, nevertheless that her words had made an impression on him.\n\nAfter supper he disappeared from the palace without saying where he was\ngoing\u00e2\u0080\u0094a thing he had never done before. Of course we all knew where he\nhad gone: back to the beach to sit up with the snail. We were sure of\nit because he had said nothing to Bumpo about attending to the matter.\n\nAs soon as the doors were closed upon the Cabinet Meeting that night,\nPolynesia addressed the Ministry:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook here, you fellows,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she: \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve simply got to get the Doctor\nto take this holiday somehow\u00e2\u0080\u0094unless we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re willing to stay in this\nblessed island for the rest of our lives.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut what difference,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bumpo asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis his taking a holiday going to\nmake?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nImpatiently Polynesia turned upon the Minister of the Interior.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see? If he has a clear week to get thoroughly interested in\nhis natural history again\u00e2\u0080\u0094marine stuff, his dream of seeing the floor\nof the ocean and all that\u00e2\u0080\u0094there may be some chance of his consenting\nto leave this pesky place. But while he is here on duty as king he\nnever gets a moment to think of anything outside of the business of\ngovernment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s far too consententious,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bumpo agreed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd besides,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Polynesia went on, \u00e2\u0080\u009chis only hope of ever getting away\nfrom here would be to escape secretly. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got to leave while he is\nholiday-making, incognito\u00e2\u0080\u0094when no one knows where he is or what he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndoing, but us. If he built a ship big enough to cross the sea in, all\nthe Indians would see it, and hear it, being built; and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d ask what\nit was for. They would interfere. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099d sooner have anything happen\nthan lose the Doctor. Why, I believe if they thought he had any idea of\nescaping they would put chains on him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I really think they would,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I agreed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYet without a ship of some\nkind I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see how the Doctor is going to get away, even secretly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polynesia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we do succeed in making\nhim take this holiday, our next step will be to get the sea-snail\nto promise to take us all in his shell and carry us to the mouth of\nPuddleby River. If we can once get the snail willing, the temptation\nwill be too much for John Dolittle and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come, I know\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially as\nhe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be able to take those new plants and drugs of Long Arrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to the\nEnglish doctors, as well as see the floor of the ocean on the way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow thrilling!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you mean the snail could take us under\nthe sea all the way back to Puddleby?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCertainly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polynesia, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca little trip like that is nothing to\nhim. He would crawl along the floor of the ocean and the Doctor could\nsee all the sights. Perfectly simple. Oh, John Dolittle will come all\nright, if we can only get him to take that holiday\u00e2\u0080\u0094_and_ if the snail\nwill consent to give us the ride.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGolly, I hope he does!\u00e2\u0080\u009d sighed Jip. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sick of these beastly\ntropics\u00e2\u0080\u0094they make you feel so lazy and good-for-nothing. And there\nare no rats or anything here\u00e2\u0080\u0094not that a fellow would have the energy\nto chase \u00e2\u0080\u0099em even if there were. My, wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I be glad to see old\nPuddleby and the garden again! And won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Dab-Dab be glad to have us\nback!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy the end of next month,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit will be two whole years since\nwe left England\u00e2\u0080\u0094since we pulled up the anchor at Kingsbridge and bumped\nour way out into the river.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd got stuck on the mud-bank,\u00e2\u0080\u009d added Chee-Chee in a dreamy, far-away\nvoice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you remember how all the people waved to us from the river-wall?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\nasked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes. And I suppose they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve often talked about us in the town since,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsaid Jip\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cwondering whether we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re dead or alive.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCease,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bumpo, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI feel I am about to weep from sediment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n_THE SEVENTH CHAPTER_\n\nTHE DOCTOR\u00e2\u0080\u0099S DECISION\n\n\nWELL, you can guess how glad we were when next morning the Doctor,\nafter his all-night conversation with the snail, told us that he had\nmade up his mind to take the holiday. A proclamation was published\nright away by the Town Crier that His Majesty was going into the\ncountry for a seven-day rest, but that during his absence the palace\nand the government offices would be kept open as usual.\n\nPolynesia was immensely pleased. She at once set quietly to work making\narrangements for our departure\u00e2\u0080\u0094taking good care the while that no one\nshould get an inkling of where we were going, what we were taking with\nus, the hour of our leaving or which of the palace-gates we would go\nout by.\n\nCunning old schemer that she was, she forgot nothing. And not even we,\nwho were of the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s party, could imagine what reasons she had\nfor some of her preparations. She took me inside and told me that the\none thing I must remember to bring with me was _all_ of the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nnote-books. Long Arrow, who was the only Indian let into the secret\nof our destination, said he would like to come with us as far as the\nbeach to see the Great Snail; and him Polynesia told to be sure and\nbring his collection of plants. Bumpo she ordered to carry the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhigh hat\u00e2\u0080\u0094carefully hidden under his coat. She sent off nearly all the\nfootmen who were on night duty to do errands in the town, so that there\nshould be as few servants as possible to see us leave. And midnight,\nthe hour when most of the townspeople would be asleep, she finally\nchose for our departure.\n\nWe had to take a week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s food-supply with us for the royal holiday. So,\nwith our other packages, we were heavy laden when on the stroke of\ntwelve we opened the west door of the palace and stepped cautiously and\nquietly into the moonlit garden.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTiptoe incognito,\u00e2\u0080\u009d whispered Bumpo as we gently closed the heavy doors\nbehind us.\n\nNo one had seen us leave.\n\nAt the foot of the stone steps leading from the Peacock Terrace to the\nSunken Rosary, something made me pause and look back at the magnificent\npalace which we had built in this strange, far-off land where no white\nmen but ourselves had ever come. Somehow I felt it in my bones that we\nwere leaving it to-night never to return again. And I wondered what\nother kings and ministers would dwell in its splendid halls when we\nwere gone. The air was hot; and everything was deadly still but for the\ngentle splashing of the tame flamingoes paddling in the lily-pond.\nSuddenly the twinkling lantern of a night watchman appeared round the\ncorner of a cypress hedge. Polynesia plucked at my stocking and, in an\nimpatient whisper, bade me hurry before our flight be discovered.\n\nOn our arrival at the beach we found the snail already feeling much\nbetter and now able to move his tail without pain.\n\nThe porpoises (who are by nature inquisitive creatures) were still\nhanging about in the offing to see if anything of interest was going to\nhappen. Polynesia, the plotter, while the Doctor was occupied with his\nnew patient, signaled to them and drew them aside for a little private\nchat.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow see here, my friends,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she speaking low: \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou know how much\nJohn Dolittle has done for the animals\u00e2\u0080\u0094given his whole life up to them,\none might say. Well, here is your chance to do something for him.\nListen: he got made king of this island against his will, see? And now\nthat he has taken the job on, he feels that he can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t leave it\u00e2\u0080\u0094thinks\nthe Indians won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to get along without him and all that\u00e2\u0080\u0094which\nis nonsense, as you and I very well know. All right. Then here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the\npoint: if this snail were only willing to take him and us\u00e2\u0080\u0094and a little\nbaggage\u00e2\u0080\u0094not very much, thirty or forty pieces, say\u00e2\u0080\u0094inside his shell and\ncarry us to England, we feel sure that the Doctor would go; because\nhe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just crazy to mess about on the floor of the ocean. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more\nthis would be his one and only chance of escape from the island. Now\nit is highly important that the Doctor return to his own country to\ncarry on his proper work which means such a lot to the animals of the\nworld. So what we want you to do is to tell the sea-urchin to tell the\nstarfish to tell the snail to take us in his shell and carry us to\nPuddleby River. Is that plain?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n[Illustration: \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Tiptoe incognito,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 whispered Bumpo\u00e2\u0080\u009d]\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cQuite, quite,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the porpoises. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd we will willingly do our very\nbest to persuade him\u00e2\u0080\u0094for it is, as you say, a perfect shame for the\ngreat man to be wasting his time here when he is so much needed by the\nanimals.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let the Doctor know what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re about,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polynesia as\nthey started to move off. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe might balk if he thought we had any hand\nin it. Get the snail to offer on his own account to take us. See?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJohn Dolittle, unaware of anything save the work he was engaged on, was\nstanding knee-deep in the shallow water, helping the snail try out his\nmended tail to see if it were well enough to travel on. Bumpo and Long\nArrow, with Chee-Chee and Jip, were lolling at the foot of a palm a\nlittle way up the beach. Polynesia and I now went and joined them.\n\nHalf an hour passed.\n\nWhat success the porpoises had met with, we did not know, till suddenly\nthe Doctor left the snail\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side and came splashing out to us, quite\nbreathless.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat _do_ you think?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhile I was talking to the snail\njust now he offered, of his own accord, to take us all back to England\ninside his shell. He says he has got to go on a voyage of discovery\nanyway, to hunt up a new home, now that the Deep Hole is closed. Said\nit wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be much out of his way to drop us at Puddleby River, if we\ncared to come along\u00e2\u0080\u0094Goodness, what a chance! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love to go. To examine\nthe floor of the ocean all the way from Brazil to Europe! No man ever\ndid it before. What a glorious trip!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Oh that I had never allowed myself\nto be made king! Now I must see the chance of a lifetime slip by.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe turned from us and moved down the sands again to the middle beach,\ngazing wistfully, longingly out at the snail. There was something\npeculiarly sad and forlorn about him as he stood there on the lonely,\nmoonlit shore, the crown upon his head, his figure showing sharply\nblack against the glittering sea behind.\n\nOut of the darkness at my elbow Polynesia rose and quietly moved down\nto his side.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow Doctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she in a soft persuasive voice as though she were\ntalking to a wayward child, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou know this king business is not your\nreal work in life. These natives will be able to get along without\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0094not so well as they do with you of course\u00e2\u0080\u0094but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll manage\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\nsame as they did before you came. Nobody can say you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t done your\nduty by them. It was their fault: they made you king. Why not accept\nthe snail\u00e2\u0080\u0099s offer; and just drop everything now, and go? The work\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do, the information you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll carry home, will be of far more value\nthan what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor turning to her sadly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot. They\nwould go back to their old unsanitary ways: bad water, uncooked fish,\nno drainage, enteric fever and the rest.... No. I must think of their\nhealth, their welfare. I began life as a people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doctor: I seem to\nhave come back to it in the end. I cannot desert them. Later perhaps\nsomething will turn up. But I cannot leave them now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re wrong, Doctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow is when you should\ngo. Nothing will \u00e2\u0080\u0098turn up.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 The longer you stay, the harder it will be\nto leave\u00e2\u0080\u0094Go now. Go to-night.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat, steal away without even saying good-bye to them! Why, Polynesia,\nwhat a thing to suggest!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA fat chance they would give you to say good-bye!\u00e2\u0080\u009d snorted Polynesia\ngrowing impatient at last. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI tell you, Doctor, if you go back to that\npalace tonight, for goodbys or anything else, you will stay there.\nNow\u00e2\u0080\u0094this moment\u00e2\u0080\u0094is the time for you to go.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe truth of the old parrot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words seemed to be striking home; for\nthe Doctor stood silent a minute, thinking.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut there are the note-books,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said presently: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would have to go\nback to fetch them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have them here, Doctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, speaking up\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009call of them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAgain he pondered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd Long Arrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s collection,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would have to take that also\nwith me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is here, Oh Kindly One,\u00e2\u0080\u009d came the Indian\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deep voice from the\nshadow beneath the palm.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut what about provisions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cfood for the journey?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have a week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supply with us, for our holiday,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nPolynesia\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more than we will need.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFor a third time the Doctor was silent and thoughtful.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd then there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my hat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said fretfully at last. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat settles it:\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll _have_ to go back to the palace. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t leave without my hat. How\ncould I appear in Puddleby with this crown on my head?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere it is, Doctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bumpo producing the hat, old, battered and\nbeloved, from under his coat.\n\nPolynesia had indeed thought of everything.\n\nYet even now we could see the Doctor was still trying to think up\nfurther excuses.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh Kindly One,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Long Arrow, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy tempt ill fortune? Your way is\nclear. Your future and your work beckon you back to your foreign home\nbeyond the sea. With you will go also what lore I too have gathered\nfor mankind\u00e2\u0080\u0094to lands where it will be of wider use than it can ever\nhere. I see the glimmerings of dawn in the eastern heaven. Day is at\nhand. Go before your subjects are abroad. Go before your project is\ndiscovered. For truly I believe that if you go not now you will linger\nthe remainder of your days a captive king in Popsipetel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGreat decisions often take no more than a moment in the making. Against\nthe now paling sky I saw the Doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s figure suddenly stiffen. Slowly\nhe lifted the Sacred Crown from off his head and laid it on the sands.\n\nAnd when he spoke his voice was choked with tears.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey will find it here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he murmured, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen they come to search for\nme. And they will know that I have gone.... My children, my poor\nchildren!\u00e2\u0080\u0094I wonder will they ever understand why it was I left them....\nI wonder will they ever understand\u00e2\u0080\u0094and forgive.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe took his old hat from Bumpo; then facing Long Arrow, gripped his\noutstretched hand in silence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou decide aright, oh Kindly One,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Indian\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cthough none\nwill miss and mourn you more than Long Arrow, the son of Golden\nArrow\u00e2\u0080\u0094Farewell, and may good fortune ever lead you by the hand!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was the first and only time I ever saw the Doctor weep. Without a\nword to any of us, he turned and moved down the beach into the shallow\nwater of the sea.\n\nThe snail humped up its back and made an opening between its shoulders\nand the edge of its shell. The Doctor clambered up and passed within.\nWe followed him, after handing up the baggage. The opening shut tight\nwith a whistling suction noise.\n\nThen turning in the direction of the East, the great creature began\nmoving smoothly forward, down the slope into the deeper waters.\n\nJust as the swirling dark green surf was closing in above our heads,\nthe big morning sun popped his rim up over the edge of the ocean. And\nthrough our transparent walls of pearl we saw the watery world about\nus suddenly light up with that most wondrously colorful of visions, a\ndaybreak beneath the sea.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe rest of the story of our homeward voyage is soon told.\n\nOur new quarters we found very satisfactory. Inside the spacious shell,\nthe snail\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wide back was extremely comfortable to sit and lounge\non\u00e2\u0080\u0094better than a sofa, when you once got accustomed to the damp and\nclammy feeling of it. He asked us, shortly after we started, if we\nwouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind taking off our boots, as the hobnails in them hurt his\nback as we ran excitedly from one side to another to see the different\nsights.\n\nThe motion was not unpleasant, very smooth and even; in fact, but for\nthe landscape passing outside, you would not know, on the level going,\nthat you were moving at all.\n\nI had always thought for some reason or other that the bottom of the\nsea was flat. I found that it was just as irregular and changeful as\nthe surface of the dry land. We climbed over great mountain-ranges,\nwith peaks towering above peaks. We threaded our way through dense\nforests of tall sea-plants. We crossed wide empty stretches of sandy\nmud, like deserts\u00e2\u0080\u0094so vast that you went on for a whole day with nothing\nahead of you but a dim horizon. Sometimes the scene was moss-covered,\nrolling country, green and restful to the eye like rich pastures; so\nthat you almost looked to see sheep cropping on these underwater downs.\nAnd sometimes the snail would roll us forward inside him like peas,\nwhen he suddenly dipped downward to descend into some deep secluded\nvalley with steeply sloping sides.\n\nIn these lower levels we often came upon the shadowy shapes of dead\nships, wrecked and sunk Heaven only knows how many years ago; and\npassing them we would speak in hushed whispers like children seeing\nmonuments in churches.\n\nHere too, in the deeper, darker waters, monstrous fishes, feeding\nquietly in caves and hollows would suddenly spring up, alarmed at our\napproach, and flash away into the gloom with the speed of an arrow.\nWhile other bolder ones, all sorts of unearthly shapes and colors,\nwould come right up and peer in at us through the shell.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose they think we are a sort of sanaquarium,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bumpo\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\nhate to be a fish.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was a thrilling and ever-changing show. The Doctor wrote or sketched\nincessantly. Before long we had filled all the blank note-books we had\nleft. Then we searched our pockets for any odd scraps of paper on which\nto jot down still more observations. We even went through the used\nbooks a second time, writing in between the lines, scribbling all over\nthe covers, back and front.\n\nOur greatest difficulty was getting enough light to see by. In the\nlower waters it was very dim. On the third day we passed a band of\nfire-eels, a sort of large, marine glow-worm; and the Doctor asked the\nsnail to get them to come with us for a way. This they did, swimming\nalongside; and their light was very helpful, though not brilliant.\n\nHow our giant shellfish found his way across that vast and gloomy\nworld was a great puzzle to us. John Dolittle asked him by what means\nhe navigated\u00e2\u0080\u0094how he knew he was on the right road to Puddleby River.\nAnd what the snail said in reply got the Doctor so excited, that having\nno paper left, he tore out the lining of his precious hat and covered\nit with notes.\n\nBy night of course it was impossible to see anything; and during the\nhours of darkness the snail used to swim instead of crawl. When he did\nso he could travel at a terrific speed, just by waggling that long tail\nof his. This was the reason why we completed the trip in so short a\ntime\u00e2\u0080\u0094five and a half days.\n\nThe air of our chamber, not having a change in the whole voyage, got\nvery close and stuffy; and for the first two days we all had headaches.\nBut after that we got used to it and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind it in the least.\n\nEarly in the afternoon of the sixth day, we noticed we were climbing a\nlong gentle slope. As we went upward it grew lighter. Finally we saw\nthat the snail had crawled right out of the water altogether and had\nnow come to a dead stop on a long strip of gray sand.\n\nBehind us we saw the surface of the sea rippled by the wind. On our\nleft was the mouth of a river with the tide running out. While in\nfront, the low flat land stretched away into the mist\u00e2\u0080\u0094which prevented\none from seeing very far in any direction. A pair of wild ducks with\ncraning necks and whirring wings passed over us and disappeared like\nshadows, seaward.\n\nAs a landscape, it was a great change from the hot brilliant sunshine\nof Popsipetel.\n\nWith the same whistling suction sound, the snail made the opening for\nus to crawl out by. As we stepped down upon the marshy land we noticed\nthat a fine, drizzling autumn rain was falling.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCan this be Merrie England?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Bumpo, peering into the\nfog\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cdoesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look like any place in particular. Maybe the snail hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nbrought us right after all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d sighed Polynesia, shaking the rain off her feathers, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is\nEngland all right\u00e2\u0080\u0094You can tell it by the beastly climate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, but fellows,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Jip, as he sniffed up the air in great gulps,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cit has a _smell_\u00e2\u0080\u0094a good and glorious smell!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Excuse me a minute: I see\na water-rat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSh!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Listen!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Chee-Chee through teeth that chattered with the\ncold. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Puddleby church-clock striking four. Why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we divide\nup the baggage and get moving. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a long way to foot it home\nacross the marshes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hope,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I put in, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat Dab-Dab has a nice fire burning in the\nkitchen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure she will,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor as he picked out his old handbag\nfrom among the bundles\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith this wind from the East she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need it to\nkeep the animals in the house warm.

It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n","id":420,"split":"train"}
