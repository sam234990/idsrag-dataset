The unconventional hero has a literally bumpy start to his journey as he accidentally runs into a little old lady. Though she appears to be alright, Barret's fear of being arrested causes him to flee. However, because he is the hero, he cannot shake the guilty conscience and returns to the site of the accident, only to find that the old lady and the crowd that gathered to be gone. Wrought with worry, Barret makes his way to Mabberly. Mabberly has engaged a yacht and crew and intends to \"sail, without fail\" the next morning with Barrett and another schoolmate, Giles Jackman. The next day, not long at sea, misfortune befalls the party and they collide with a passing steamer, causing their vessel to split down the middle. Now in the water, the men make their way toward the rocky shore of a now-visible island. Upon arrival, the men elect Barrett to search for habitation. He comes across a sheep track, a primitive road and eventually a hut among the rocks. From here, Barrett begins to meet the people who reside on the island, all of whom are white. When the rest of the party joins Barrett, they are happy to learn the houses there are fully functioning (with kitchens and bedrooms, each stocked appropriately). As fate would have it, Barrett happens upon a young girl, Milly, lying on the road, who has injured her arm after falling from a cliff. Barret eventually develops feelings for her. He and Milly share a love for botany, which was the cause of her fall from the cliff, and use this area of interest to pave the way for further interaction. Elsewhere, the men engage in hunting outings as well as occasionally fishing (or in Archie's case, photography). Meanwhile, Milly has been writing home, telling her mother about the man who saved her life, effectively causing her mother to become fond of him. When news of Mrs. Moss' arrival reaches Barrett, he rushes to meet her, only to nearly knock her over. She turns out to be the very same woman Barrett had hit with his bicycle earlier on. At this point, though she recognizes him as the man who ran her down, she does not know he is Barret. After falling from a cliff and falling unconscious, Barrett does not show up for supper, worrying the others and causing them to search for him. Once found, he is unrecognizable due to the bruising and head-dressings he now bears, successfully continuing to hide his identity from Mrs. Moss. Once he has healed and she discovers that he is indeed Barrett, she agrees to forgive him, thus allowing Milly and him to marry.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Eagle Cliff, by R.M.

Ballantyne.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nThis is a truly delightful book by this prolific author.  I know of no\nother of his books that leaves so many images in the mind, so fresh\nafter many a year.  The scene starts with a young man cycling on his\npenny-farthing towards London.  On the way he has an accident, knocking\ndown an elderly lady, but fleeing the scene when he sees a policeman\ncoming.  But when he gets home he finds a telegram informing him that\nhis friends will be departing very soon in a yacht, to visit the\nislands on the North-West of Britain, so he joins them.\n\nUnfortunately there is a fog and the yacht is damaged but all the young\nmen and their crew manage to get ashore, finding themselves in the\nneighbourhood of a large house, the residence of a gentleman and his\nfamily.  They are invited to stay there as his guests, and it is at\nthis point that the adventures begin, involving fishing, shooting,\nbird-watching, sailing and so forth.  There is a charming young lady\nalso staying in the house, and deploying her hobby of painting.  Our\nhero falls in love with her, but is very much taken aback when she is\njoined by her mother, who turns out to be none other than the elderly\nlady he had knocked down back in London.  Even more disastrous was the\nfire that destroyed the house.  This is a brilliant book, and you will\nlove it.\n\nAs a footnote you may be surprised that one of the children is called\nJunkie.  This certainly does not mean that same as it does today:\ninstead it is a nickname given to a favourite boy-child, and you will\nfind several examples of this in Ballantyne's books.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nTHE EAGLE CLIFF, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE.\n\nBEGINS THE TALE--NATURALLY.\n\nFrom the earliest records of history we learn that man has ever been\nenvious of the birds, and of all other winged creatures.  He has longed\nand striven to fly.  He has also signally failed to do so.\n\nWe say \"failed\" advisedly, because his various attempts in that\ndirection have usually resulted in disappointment and broken bones.  As\nto balloons, we do not admit that they fly any more than do ships;\nballoons merely float and glide, when not otherwise engaged in tumbling,\ncollapsing, and bursting.\n\nThis being so, we draw attention to the fact that the nearest approach\nwe have yet made to the sensation of flying is that achieved by rushing\ndown a long, smooth, steep hill-road on a well-oiled and perfect\nball-bearings bicycle!  Skating cannot compare with this, for that\nrequires exertion; bicycling down hill requires none.  Hunting cannot,\nno matter how splendid the mount, for that implies a certain element of\nbumping, which, however pleasant in itself, is not suggestive of the\nsmooth swift act of flying.\n\nWe introduce this subject merely because thoughts somewhat similar to\nthose which we have so inadequately expressed were burning in the brain\nof a handsome and joyful young man one summer morning not long ago, as,\nwith legs over the handles, he flashed--if he did not actually fly--down\none of our Middlesex hills on his way to London.\n\nUrgent haste was in every look and motion of that young man's fine eyes\nand lithe body.  He would have bought wings at any price had that been\npossible; but, none being yet in the market, he made the most of his\nwheel--a fifty-eight inch one, by the way, for the young man's legs were\nlong, as well as strong.\n\nArrived at the bottom of the hill the hilarious youth put his feet to\nthe treadles, and drove the machine vigorously up the opposite slope.\nIt was steep, but he was powerful.  He breathed hard, no doubt, but he\nnever flagged until he gained the next summit.  A shout burst from his\nlips as he rolled along the level top, for there, about ten miles off,\nlay the great city, glittering in the sunshine, and with only an\namber-tinted canopy of its usual smoke above it.\n\nAmong the tall elms and in the flowering hedgerows between which he\nswept, innumerable birds warbled or twittered their astonishment that he\ncould fly with such heedless rapidity through that beautiful country,\nand make for the dismal town in such magnificent weather.  One aspiring\nlark overhead seemed to repeat, with persistent intensity, its trill of\nself gratulation that it had not been born a man.  Even the cattle\nappeared to regard the youth as a sort of ornithological curiosity, for\nthe sentiment, \"Well, you are a goose!\" was clearly written on their\nmild faces as he flew past them.\n\nOver the hill-top he went--twelve miles an hour at the least--until he\nreached the slope on the other side; then down he rushed again, driving\nat the first part of the descent like an insane steam-engine, till the\npace must have increased to twenty miles, at which point, the whirl of\nthe wheel becoming too rapid, he was obliged once more to rest his legs\non the handles, and take to repose, contemplation, and wiping his heated\nbrow--equivalent this, we might say, to the floating descent of the\nsea-mew.  Of course the period of rest was of brief duration, for,\nalthough the hill was a long slope, with many a glimpse of loveliness\nbetween the trees, the time occupied in its flight was short, and, at\nthe bottom a rustic bridge, with an old inn and a thatched hamlet, with\nan awkwardly sharp turn in the road beyond it, called for wary and\nintelligent guidance of this lightning express.\n\nSwiftly but safely to the foot of the hill went John Barret (that was\nthe youth's name), at ever-increasing speed, and without check; for no\none seemed to be moving about in the quiet hamlet, and the old English\ninn had apparently fallen asleep.\n\nA delicious undulating swoop at the bottom indicates the crossing of the\nbridge.  A flash, and the inn is in rear.  The hamlet displays no sign\nof life, nevertheless Barret is cautious.  He lays a finger on the brake\nand touches the bell.  He is half-way through the hamlet and all goes\nwell; still no sign of life except--yes, this so-called proof of every\nrule is always forthcoming, except that there is the sudden appearance\nof one stately cock.  This is followed immediately by its sudden and\nunstately disappearance.  A kitten also emerges from somewhere, glares,\narches, fuffs, becomes indescribable, and--is not!  Two or three\nchildren turn up and gape, but do not recover in time to insult, or to\nincrease the dangers of the awkward turn in the road which is now at\nhand.\n\nBarret looks thoughtful.  Must the pace be checked here?  The road is\nopen and visible.  It is bordered by grass banks and ditches on either\nside.  He rushes close to the left bank and, careering gracefully to the\nright like an Algerine felucca in a white squall, dares the laws of\ngravitation and centrifugal force to the utmost limitation, and\ndescribes a magnificent segment of a great circle.  Almost before you\ncan wink he is straight again, and pegging along with irresistible\npertinacity.\n\nJust beyond the hamlet a suburban lady is encountered, with clasped\nhands and beseeching eyes, for a loose hairy bundle, animated by the\nspirit of a dog, stands in the middle of the road, bidding defiance to\nthe entire universe!  The hairy bundle loses its head all at once,\nlikewise its heart: it has not spirit left even to get out of the way.\nA momentary lean of the bicycle first to the left and then to the right\ndescribes what artists call \"the line of beauty,\" in a bight of which\nthe bundle remains behind, crushed in spirit, but unhurt in body.\n\nAt the bottom of the next hill a small roadside inn greets our cyclist.\nThat which cocks, kittens, dangers, and dogs could not effect, the inn\naccomplishes.  He \"slows.\"  In front of the door he describes an airy\ncirclet, dismounting while yet in motion, leans the lightning express\nagainst the wall, and enters.  What! does that vigorous, handsome,\npowerful fellow, in the flush of early manhood, drink?  Ay, truly he\ndoes.\n\n\"Glass of bitter, sir?\" asks the exuberant landlord.\n\n\"Ginger,\" says the young man, pointing significantly to a bit of blue\nribbon in his button-hole.\n\n\"Come far to-day, sir?\" asks the host, as he pours out the liquid.\n\n\"Fifty miles--rather more,\" says Barret, setting down the glass.\n\n\"Fine weather, sir, for bicycling,\" says the landlord, sweeping in the\ncoppers.\n\n\"Very; good-day.\"\n\nBefore that cheery \"Good-day\" had ceased to affect the publican's brain\nBarret was again spinning along the road to London.\n\nIt was the road on which the mail coaches of former days used to whirl,\nto the merry music of bugle, wheel, and whip, along which so many men\nand women had plodded in days gone by, in search of fame and fortune and\nhappiness: some, to find these in a greater or less degree, with much of\nthe tinsel rubbed off, others, to find none of them, but instead\nthereof, wreck and ruin in the mighty human whirlpool; and not a few to\ndiscover the fact that happiness does not depend either on fortune or\nfame, but on spiritual harmony with God in Jesus Christ.\n\nPedestrians there still were on that road, bound for the same goal, and,\ndoubtless, with similar aims; but mail and other coaches had been driven\nfrom the scene.\n\nBarret had the broad road pretty much to himself.\n\nQuickly he ran into the suburban districts, and here his urgent haste\nhad to be restrained a little.\n\n\"What if I am too late!\" he thought, and almost involuntarily put on a\nspurt.\n\nSoon he entered the crowded thoroughfares, and was compelled to curb\nboth steed and spirit.  Passing through one of the less-frequented\nstreets in the neighbourhood of Finchley Road, he ventured to give the\nrein to his willing charger.\n\nBut here Fortune ceased to smile--and Fortune was to be commended for\nher severity.\n\nBarret, although kind, courteous, manly, sensitive, and reasonably\ncareful, was not just what he ought to have been.  Although a hero, he\nwas not perfect.  He committed the unpardonable sin of turning a street\ncorner sharply!  A thin little old lady crossed the road at the same\nidentical moment, slowly.  They met!  Who can describe that meeting?\nNot the writer, for he did not see it; more's the pity!  Very few people\nsaw it, for it was a quiet corner.  The parties concerned cannot be said\nto have seen, though they felt it.  Both went down.  It was awful,\nreally, to see a feeble old lady struggling with an athlete and a\nbicycle!\n\nTwo little street boys, and a ragged girl appeared as if by magic.  They\nalways do!\n\n\"Oh!  I say!  Ain't he bin and squashed 'er?\"\n\nSuch was the remark of one of the boys.\n\n\"Pancakes is plump to 'er,\" was the observation of the other.\n\nThe ragged girl said nothing, but looked unspeakable things.\n\nBurning with shame, trembling with anxiety, covered with dust and\nconsiderably bruised, Barret sprang up, left his fallen steed, and,\nraising the little old lady with great tenderness in his arms, sat her\non the pavement with her back against the railings, while he poured out\nabject apologies and earnest inquiries.\n\nStrange to say the old lady was not hurt in the least--only a good deal\nshaken and very indignant.\n\nStranger still, a policeman suddenly appeared in the distance.  At the\nsame time a sweep, a postman, and a servant girl joined the group.\n\nYoung Barret, as we have said, was sensitive.  To become the object and\ncentre of a crowd in such circumstances was overwhelming.  A climax was\nput to his confusion, when one of the street arabs, observing the\npoliceman, suddenly exclaimed:--\n\n\"Oh!  I say, 'ere's a bobby!  What a lark.  Won't you be 'ad up before\nthe beaks?  It'll be a case o' murder.\"\n\n\"No, it won't,\" retorted the other boy; \"it'll be a case o' manslaughter\nan' attempted suicide jined.\"\n\nBarret started up, allowing the servant maid to take his place, and saw\nthe approaching constable.  Visions of detention, publicity, trial,\nconviction, condemnation, swam before him.\n\n\"A reg'lar Krismas panty-mime for nuffin'!\" remarked the ragged girl,\nbreaking silence for the first time.\n\nScarcely knowing what he did, Barret leaped towards his bicycle, set it\nup, vaulted into the saddle, as he well knew how, and was safely out of\nsight in a few seconds.\n\nYet not altogether safe.  A guilty conscience pursued, overtook, and sat\nupon him.  Shame and confusion overwhelmed him.  Up to that date he had\nbeen honourable, upright, straightforward; as far as the world's\nestimation went, irreproachable.  Now, in his own estimation, he was\nmean, false, underhand, sneaking!\n\nBut he did not give way to despair.  He was a true hero, else we would\nnot have had anything to write about him.  Suddenly he slowed, frowned,\ncompressed his lips, described a complete circle--in spite of a\nfurniture van that came in his way--and deliberately went back to the\nspot where the accident had occurred; but there was no little lady to be\nseen.  She had been conveyed away, the policeman was gone, the little\nboys were gone, the ragged girl, sweep, postman, and servant maid--all\nwere gone, \"like the baseless fabric of a vision,\" leaving only new\nfaces and strangers behind to wonder what accident and thin old lady the\nexcited youth was asking about--so evanescent are the incidents that\noccur; and so busily pre-occupied are the human torrents that rush in\nthe streets of London!\n\nThe youth turned sadly from the spot and continued his journey at a\nslower pace.  As he went along, the thought that the old lady might have\nreceived internal injuries, and would die, pressed heavily upon him:\nThus, he might actually be a murderer, at the best a man-slaughterer,\nwithout knowing it, and would carry in his bosom a dreadful secret, and\na terrible uncertainty, to the end of his life!\n\nOf course he could go to that great focus of police energy--Scotland\nYard--and give himself up; but on second thoughts he did not quite see\nhis way to that.  However, he would watch the daily papers closely.\nThat evening, in a frame of mind very different from the mental\ncondition, in which he had set out on his sixty miles' ride in the\nafternoon, John Barret presented himself to his friend and old\nschoolfellow, Bob Mabberly.\n\n\"You're a good fellow, Barret; I knew you would come; but you look warm.\nHave you been running?\" asked Mabberly, opening the door of his lodging\nto his friend.  \"Come in: I have news for you.  Giles Jackman has agreed\nto go.  Isn't that a comfort? for, besides his rare and valuable\nsporting qualities, he is more than half a doctor, which will be\nimportant, you know, if any of us should get ill or come to grief.  Sit\ndown and we'll talk it over.\"\n\nNow, it was a telegram from Bob Mabberly which led John Barret to\nsuddenly undertake a sixty miles' ride that day, and which was thus the\nindirect cause of the little old lady being run down.  The telegram ran\nas follows:--\n\n\"Come instanter.  As you are.  Clothes unimportant.  Yacht engaged.\nCrew also.  Sail, without fail, Thursday.  Plenty more to say when we\nmeet.\"\n\n\"Now, you see, Bob, with your usual want of precision, or care, or some\nsuch quality--\"\n\n\"Stop, Barret.  Do be more precise in the use of language.  How can the\nwant of a thing be a _quality_?\"\n\n\"You are right, Bob.  Let me say, then, that with your usual unprecision\nand carelessness you sent me a telegram, which could not reach me till\nlate on Wednesday night, after all trains were gone, telling me that you\nsail, without fail, on Thursday, but leaving me to guess whether you\nmeant Thursday morning or evening.\"\n\n\"How stupid!  My dear fellow, I forgot that!\"\n\n\"Just so.  Well to make sure of losing no time, instead of coming here\nby trains, which, as you know, are very awkward and slow in our\nneighbourhood, besides necessitating long waits and several changes, I\njust packed my portmanteau, gun, rods, etcetera, and gave directions to\nhave them forwarded here by the first morning train, then took a few\nwinks of sleep, and at the first glimmer of daylight mounted my wheel\nand set off across country as straight as country roads would permit\nof--and--here I am.\"\n\n\"True, Barret, and in good time for tea too.  We don't sail till\nmorning, for the tide does not serve till six o'clock, so that will give\nus plenty of time to put the finishing touches to our plans, allow your\nthings to arrive, and permit of our making--or, rather, renewing--our\nacquaintance with Giles Jackman.  You remember him, don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, faintly.  He was a broad, sturdy, good-humoured, reckless, little\nboy when I last saw him at old Blatherby's school.\"\n\n\"Just so.  Your portrait is correct.  I saw him last month, after a good\nmany years' interval, and he is exactly what he was, but considerably\nexaggerated at every point.  He is not, indeed, a little, but a middle\nsized man now; as good-humoured as ever; much more reckless; sturdier\nand broader a great deal, with an amount of hair about his lip, chin,\nand head generally that would suffice to fit out three or four average\nmen.  He has been in India--in the Woods and Forests Department, or\nsomething of that sort--and has killed tigers, elephants, and such-like\nby the hundred, they say; but I've met him only once or twice, and he\ndon't speak much about his own doings.  He is home on sick-leave just\nnow.\"\n\n\"Sick-leave!  Will he be fit to go with us?\" asked Barret, doubtfully.\n\n\"Fit!\" cried Mabberly.  \"Ay, much more fit than you are, strong and\nvigorous though you be, for the voyage home has not only cured him; it\nhas added superabundant health.  Voyages always do to sick\nAnglo-Indians, don't you know?  However ill a man may be in India, all\nhe has to do is to obtain leave of absence and get on board of a ship\nhomeward bound, and straightway health, rushing in upon him like a\nriver, sends him home more than cured.  So now our party is made up,\nyacht victualled, anchor tripped; and--`all's well that ends well.'\"\n\n\"But all is not ended, Bob.  Things have only begun, and, as regards\nmyself, they have begun disastrously,\" said Barret, who thereupon\nrelated the incident of the little old lady being run down.\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" cried Mabberly, laughing, \"excuse me, don't imagine me\nindifferent to the sufferings of the poor old thing; but do you really\nsuppose that one who was tough enough, after such a collision, to sit up\nat all, with or without the support of the railings, and give way to\nindignant abuse--\"\n\n\"Not abuse, Bob, indignant looks and sentiments; she was too thorough a\nlady to think of abuse--\"\n\n\"Well, well; call it what you please; but you may depend upon it that\nshe is not much hurt, and you will hear nothing more about the matter.\"\n\n\"That's it!  That's the very thing that I dread,\" returned Barret,\nanxiously.  \"To go through life with the possibility that I may be an\nuncondemned and unhung murderer is terrible to think of.  Then I can't\nget over the meanness of my running away so suddenly.  If any one had\nsaid I was capable of such conduct I should have laughed at him.  Yet\nhave I lived to do it--contemptibly--in cold blood.\"\n\n\"Contemptibly it may have been, but not in cold blood, for did you not\nsay you were roused to a state of frenzied alarm at the sight of the\nbobby? and assuredly, although unhung as yet, you are not uncondemned,\nif self-condemnation counts for anything.  Come, don't take such a\ndesponding view of the matter.  We shall see the whole affair in the\nmorning papers before sailing, with a report of the old lady's name and\ncondition--I mean condition of health--as well as your unmanly flight,\nwithout leaving your card; so you'll be able to start with an easy--Ha!\na cab! yes, it's Jackman.  I know his manservant,\" said Mabberly, as he\nlooked out at the window.\n\nAnother moment and a broad-chested man, of about five-and-twenty, with a\nbronzed face--as far as hair left it visible--a pair of merry blue eyes,\nand a hearty manner, was grasping his old schoolfellows by the hand, and\nendeavouring to trace the likeness in John Barret to the quiet little\nboy whom he used to help with his tasks many years before.\n\n\"Man, who would have thought you could have grown into such a great\nlong-legged fellow?\" he said stepping back to take a more perfect look\nat his friend, who returned the compliment by asking who could have\nimagined that he would have turned into a Zambezian gorilla.\n\n\"Where'll I put it, sor?\" demanded a voice of metallic bassness in the\ndoorway.\n\n\"Down there--anywhere, Quin,\" said Jackman turning quickly; \"and be off\nas fast as you can to see after that rifle and cartridges.\"\n\n\"Yes, sor,\" returned the owner of the bass voice, putting down a small\nportmanteau, straightening himself, touching his forehead with a\nmilitary salute, and stalking away solemnly.\n\n\"I say, Giles, it's not often one comes across a zoological specimen\nlike that.  Where did you pick him up?\" asked Mabberly.\n\n\"In the woods and forests of course,\" said Jackman, \"where I have picked\nup everything of late--from salary to jungle fevers.  He's an old\nsoldier--also on sick-leave, though he does not look like it.  He came\noriginally from the west of Ireland, I believe; but there's little of\nthe Irishman left, save the brogue and the honesty.  He's a first-rate\nservant, if you know how to humour him, and, being a splendid cook, we\nshall find him useful.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" said Mabberly, with a dubious look.\n\n\"Why, Bob, do you suppose I would have offered him as cook and steward\nif I had not felt sure of him?\"\n\n\"Of course not; and I would not have accepted him if I had not felt sure\nof you, Giles, my boy; so come along and let's have something to eat.\"\n\n\"But you have not yet told me, Bob,\" said Jackman, while the three\nfriends were discussing their meal, \"what part of the world you intend\nto visit.  Does your father give you leave to go wherever you please,\nand stay as long as you choose?\"\n\n\"No; he limits me to the Western Isles.\"\n\n\"That's an indefinite limitation.  D'you mean the isles of the Western\nPacific?\"\n\n\"No; only those of the west of Scotland.  And, to tell you the truth, I\nhave no settled or definite plan.  Having got leave to use the yacht all\nthe summer on condition that I don't leave our own shores, I have\nresolved to begin by running at once to the wildest and farthest away\npart of the kingdom, leaving circumstances to settle the rest.\"\n\n\"A circumstantial account of the matter, no doubt, yet rather vague.\nHave you a good crew?\"\n\n\"Yes; two men and a boy, one of the men being skipper, and the nearest\napproach to a human machine you ever saw.  He is a Highlander, a\nthorough seaman, hard as mahogany and about as dark, stiff as a poker,\nself-contained, silent, except when spoken to, and absolutely obedient.\"\n\n\"And we set sail to-morrow, early?\" asked Barret.\n\n\"Yes; after seeing the morning papers,\" said Mabberly with a laugh.\n\nThis, of course, turned the conversation on the accident, much to the\ndistress of Barret, who feared that the jovial, off-hand reckless man\nfrom the \"woods and forests\" would laugh at and quiz him more severely\nthan his friend Bob.  To his surprise and great satisfaction, however,\nhe found that his fears were groundless, for Jackman listened to the\naccount of the incident quite gravely, betrayed not the slightest\ntendency to laugh, or even smile; asked a good many questions in an\ninterested tone, spoke encouragingly as to the probable result, and\naltogether showed himself to be a man of strong sympathy as well as high\nspirits.\n\nNext morning found our three adventurers dropping down the Thames with\nthe first of the ebb tide, and a slight breeze from the south-west;\nMabberly and Jackman in the very small cabin looking after stores, guns,\nrods, etcetera; Barret anxiously scanning the columns of a newspaper;\nQuin and the skipper making each other's acquaintance with much of the\nsuspicion observable in two bull-dogs who meet accidentally; the boy in\nthe fore part of the vessel coiling ropes; and the remainder of the crew\nat the helm.\n\n\"Port! port! stiddy,\" growled the skipper.\n\n\"Port it is; steady,\" replied the steersman in a sing-song professional\ntone, as a huge steamer from the antipodes went slowly past, like a\nmighty leviathan of the deep.\n\n\"Is it to the north, south, east, or west we're bound for, captain?\"\nasked Quin, with a voice like that of a conciliatory bassoon.\n\n\"I don't know where we're bound for,\" growled the skipper slowly.\n\"Starboard a bit; stiddy!\"\n\n\"Steady!\" sang out the man at the tiller.\n\nA few hours carried them into the German Ocean.  Here Quin thought he\nwould try again for a little information.\n\n\"Sure it's nor'-east we're steerin', captain,\" he remarked in a casual\nway.\n\n\"No, it's not,\" growled the skipper, very much through his nose; \"she's\nheadin' west.\"\n\n\"It's to _somewhere_ that coorse will take us in the ind, no doubt, if\nwe carry on?\" suggested Quin, interrogatively.\n\n\"Ay; oot to sea,\" replied the skipper.\n\nQuin was obliged to give it up for the time being.\n\nFor some time they were nearly becalmed; then, as the land dropped\nastern and the shades of night deepened, the wind fell altogether, and,\nwhen the stars came out, a profound calm prevailed over the gently\nundulating sea.  The exuberant spirits of our three friends were subdued\nby the sweet influences around, and, as the hour for rest drew near, the\nconversation, which at first became fitful, dropped at last to silence.\n\nThis was broken at length by Jackman saying, to the surprise of his\ncompanions, \"What d'you say to reading a chapter before turning in?  I'm\nfond of striking what's called a key-note.  If we begin this\npleasure-trip with an acknowledgment of our dependence on God, we shall\nprobably have a really pleasant time of it.  What say you?\"\n\nBoth Mabberly and Barret gladly agreed to their friend's proposal--for\nboth had been trained in God-fearing families--though neither would have\nhad the courage to make the proposal himself.  The crew were invited to\njoin, and thus family worship was established on board the _Fairy_ from\nthe first day.\n\nOnly one point is worthy of note in connection with this--although no\none noted it particularly at the time, namely, that the portion of\nScripture undesignedly selected contained that oft-quoted verse, \"Ye\nknow not what a day may bring forth.\"\n\nThe truth of this was very soon thrust home upon them by stern\nexperience.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWO.\n\nTHE VOYAGE AUSPICIOUSLY BEGUN AND PROMPTLY ENDED.\n\nA voyage up the east coast of Great Britain and through the Pentland\nFirth does not usually take a long time.  When the vessel is a swift\nlittle schooner-yacht, and the breeze is stiff as well as fair, the\nvoyage is naturally a brief one.\n\nEverything favoured the little _Fairy_.  Sun, moon, and stars cheered\nher, and winds were propitious, so that our voyagers soon found\nthemselves skimming over the billows of the western sea.\n\nIt was one part of Mabberly's plan that he and his friends should do\nduty as part of the crew.  He was himself accustomed to the handling of\nyachts, and Barret he knew had been familiar with the management of\nboats from childhood.\n\n\"You can steer, of course?\" he had asked Giles Jackman almost as soon as\nthey were fairly at sea.\n\n\"Well, ye-es, oh yes.  No doubt I could steer if I were to try.\"\n\n\"Have you never tried?\" asked his friend in surprise.\n\n\"Oh yes, I have tried--once.  It was on an occasion when a number of us\nhad gone on a picnic.  We had to proceed part of the way to our\ndestination by river in a small boat, which was managed by a regular old\nsea-dog--I forget his name, for we generally hailed him by the title of\nOld Salt.  Some of the impatient members of the party suggested a little\npreliminary lunch.  There are always people ready to back up impatient\nsuggestions!  It was agreed to, and Old Salt was ordered to open the\nprovision basket, which had been stowed away in the bows of the boat.\n`Would you steer, sir?' said Old Salt to me, as he rose to go forward.\n`Certainly, with pleasure,' said I, for, as you know, it's an old\nweakness of mine to be obliging!  Well, in a few minutes they were all\neating away as if they'd had no breakfast, while we went merrily down\nthe river, with the current and a light breeze in our favour.\n\n\"Suddenly Old Salt shouted something that was smothered in its passage\nthrough a bite of sandwich.  I looked up, and saw a native canoe coming\nstraight towards us.  `Port!' roared Old Salt, in an explosion that\ncleared away half the sandwich.  `No, thankee; I prefer sherry,' said I.\nBut I stopped there, for I saw intuitively from the yell with which he\ninterrupted me that something was wrong.  `_Hard_ a-port!' he cried,\njumping up and scattering his rations.  I shoved the tiller hard to the\nside that suggested itself, and hoped for the best.  The worst followed,\nfor we struck the native canoe amidships, as it was steering wildly out\nof our way, and capsized it!  There were only two men in it, and they\ncould swim like ducks; but the river was full of alligators, and two\nsharp-set ones were on the scent instantly.  It is my opinion that those\ntwo natives would, then and there, have been devoured, if we had not run\nin between and made such a splashing and hullaballoo with boat-hook,\noars, and voices, that the monsters were scared away.  I have never\nsteered since that day.\"\n\n\"I don't wonder; and, with my consent, you shall not steer now,\" said\nMabberly, laughing.  \"Why, Giles, I was under the impression that you\nunderstood everything, and could do almost anything!\"\n\n\"Quite a mistake, Bob, founded in error or superstition.  You have\nconfused the will with the deed.  I am indeed willing to try anything,\nbut my capacity for action is limited, like my knowledge.  In regard to\nthe higher mathematics, for instance, I know nothing.  Copper-mining I\ndo not understand.  I may say the same with reference to Tartar\nmythology, and as regards the management of infants under two years I am\ndensely ignorant.\"\n\n\"But do you really know nothing at all about boats and ships, Giles?\"\nasked Barret, who, being a good listener, did not always shine as a\nspeaker.\n\n\"How can you ask such a question?  Of course I know a great deal about\nthem.  They float, they sail and row, they steer--\"\n\n\"Rather badly sometimes, according to your own showing!\" remarked\nBarret.\n\nHaving cleared the Pentland Firth, Mabberly consulted the skipper one\nmorning as to the prospects of the weather.  \"Going to fall calm, I\nfear,\" he said, as McPherson came aft with his hands in his pilot-coat\npockets.\n\n\"Ay, sir, that iss true, what-e-ver.\"\n\nTo pronounce the last word correctly, the central \"e\" must be run into a\nlong-drawn, not an interjectional, sound.\n\n\"More-o-ver,\" continued the skipper, in his drawling nasal tone, \"it's\ngoin' to be thick.\"\n\nBeing a weather-wise man, the skipper proved to be right.  It did come\nthick; then it cleared, and, as we have said, things became favourable\nuntil they got further out to sea.  Then a fancy took possession of\nMabberly--namely, to have a \"spin out into the Atlantic and see how it\nlooked!\"  It mattered not to Jackman or Barret what they did or where\nthey went; the first being exuberantly joyous, the other quietly happy.\nSo they had their run out to sea; but twenty-four hours of it sufficed--\nit became monotonous.\n\n\"I think we'd better go back now,\" suggested Mabberly.\n\n\"Agreed,\" said his companions.\n\n\"Iss it goin' back you'll be?\" asked the skipper.\n\n\"Yes.  Don't you think we may as well turn now?\" said Mabberly, who made\nit a point always, if possible, to carry the approbation of the skipper\nwith him.\n\n\"I think it wass petter if we had niver come oot.\"\n\n\"Why so, Captain?\"\n\n\"Because it's comin' on to plow.  Putt her roond, Shames.\"\n\nJames McGregor, to whom the order was given, and who was the _other_ man\nof the crew, obeyed.  The yacht, which had latterly been beating against\na headwind, now ran gaily before it towards the Scottish coast, but when\nnight closed in no outlying islands were visible.\n\n\"We wull hev to keep a sharp look-oot, Shames,\" remarked the skipper, as\nhe stopped in his monotonous perambulation of the deck to glance at the\ncompass.\n\n\"Oo, ay,\" responded McGregor, with the air of a man who knew that as\nwell as his superior.\n\n\"What do you fear?\" asked Mabberly, coming on deck at the moment to take\na look at the night before turning in.\n\n\"I fear naething, sir,\" replied McPherson, gravely.\n\n\"I mean, what danger threatens us?\"\n\n\"None that I ken o'; but we're makin' the land, an' it behooves us to\nca' canny.\"\n\nIt may be well to remark here that the skipper, having voyaged much on\nall parts of the Scottish coast, had adopted and mixed up with his own\npeculiar English several phrases and words in use among the lowland\nScots.\n\nNext morning, when Mabberly again visited the deck, he found the skipper\nstanding on the same spot where he had left him, apparently in the same\nattitude, and with the same grave, sleepless expression on his cast-iron\nfeatures.  The boy, Robin Tips, was at the helm, looking very sleepy.\nHe was an English boy, smart, active, and wide-awake--in the slang\nsense--in which sense also we may add that he was \"cheeky.\"\n\nBut neither the skipper nor Tips was very visible at the distance of\nthree yards, owing to a dense fog which prevailed.  It was one of those\nwhite, luminous, dry fogs which are not at all depressing to the\nspirits, though obstructive to the eyes, and which are generally, if not\nalways, accompanied by profound calm.\n\n\"Has it been like this long?\" asked Mabberly, after the first\nsalutations.\n\n\"Ay, sir, a coot while.\"\n\n\"And have we made no progress during the night?\"\n\n\"Oo, ay, a coot bit.  We should nae be far off some o' the islands noo,\nbut it's hard to say, wi' naither sun, moon, nor stars veesible to let\nus fin' oot where we are.\"\n\nJackman and Barret came on deck at the moment, closely followed by Quin,\nwho, quietly ignoring the owner of the yacht, went up to his master and\nsaid--\n\n\"Tay's riddy, sor.\"\n\n\"Breakfast, you mean,\" said Mabberly, with a smile.\n\n\"Sure I wouldn't conterdick--ye, sor, av ye was to call it supper--but\nit was tay that I put in the pot.\"\n\nAt breakfast the conversation somehow turned upon boats--ship's boats--\nand their construction.\n\n\"It is quite disgraceful,\" said Jackman, \"the way in which Government\nneglects that matter of boats.  Some things, we know, will never be\ngenerally adopted unless men are compelled to adopt them.  Another\nbiscuit, Barret.\"\n\n\"Instance something, Giles,\" said Mabberly, \"and pass the butter.  I\nhate to hear sweeping assertions of an indefinite nature, which no one\ncan either corroborate or confute.\"\n\n\"Well, there is the matter of lowering boats into the water from a\nship's davits.  Now, I'll be bound that the apparatus for lowering your\nlittle punt astern is the ordinary couple of blocks--one at the stem,\nthe other at the stern?\"\n\n\"Of course it is.  What then?\"\n\n\"Why, then, don't you know what would happen if you were lowering that\nboat full of people in a rough sea, and the man at the bow failed to\nunhook his block at the exact same moment as the man at the stern?\"\n\n\"Yes, I know too well, Giles, for I have seen it happen.  The boat, on\nthe occasion I refer to, was hung up by one of the blocks, all the\npeople were dropped into the water, and several of the women and\nchildren drowned.  But how is Government to remedy that?\"\n\n\"Thus, Bob, thus.  There is a splendid apparatus invented by somebody\nwhich holds fast the two blocks.  By means of an iron lever worked by\n_one_ man, the rod is disengaged from both blocks at the same instant.\nYou cannot work it wrong if you tried to do so.  Now, the Government has\nonly to compel the adoption of that apparatus in the Royal and Merchant\nNavies, and the thing is done.\"\n\n\"Then, again,\" continued Jackman, devouring food more ravenously in\nproportion as he warmed with his subject, \"look at the matter of rafts.\nHow constantly it happens that boats get swamped and lost while being\nlaunched in cases of shipwreck at sea, and there is nothing left for the\ncrews and passengers, after the few remaining boats are filled, save\nloose spars or a hastily and ill-made raft; for of course things cannot\nbe well planned and constructed in the midst of panic and sudden\nemergency.  Now, it has been suggested, if not actually carried out,\nthat mattresses should be made of cork, with bands and straps to\nfacilitate buckling them together, and that a ship's chairs, tables,\ncamp-stools, etcetera, should be so constructed as to be convertible\ninto rafts, which might be the means of saving hundreds of lives that\nwould, under present arrangements, inevitably be lost.  Why, I ask, does\nnot Government see to this? have a special committee appointed to\ninvestigate, find out the best plan, and compel its adoption?  Men will\nnever do this.  They are too obstinate.  What's wanted is that our\nladies should take it up, and howl with indignation till it is done.\"\n\n\"My dear Giles, ladies never howl,\" said Barret, quietly tapping the end\nof an egg; \"they smile, and gently insinuate--that is always sufficient,\nbecause irresistible!\"\n\n\"Well, being a bachelor I cannot say much on that point,\" returned\nJackman.  \"But I was not aware that _you_ were married?\"\n\n\"Neither am I; but I have a mother and sisters, aunts and cousins, and I\nknow their ways.\"\n\n\"If such are their ways, I must get you to introduce me to them,\" said\nthe woods-and-forester.  \"Come on deck, now, and I will give you a\npractical illustration of what might be done.\"\n\nJackman, being an enthusiast, always went at things, \"with a will.\"\n\n\"Bring me a hen-coop, Quin,\" he said to the steward, who, having so far\ncompleted his morning work, and consumed his morning meal, was smoking\nhis pipe, seated on the rail beside Tips.  Tips was an admirer of the\nIrishman, and, in consequence, an imitator as far as he dared and was\npermitted.\n\n\"Lend a hand, ye spalpeen,\" said Quin, going forward, and quickly\nreturning with the coop, from which a cackling of strong remonstrance\nissued.\n\n\"Will ye have the other wan too, sor?\"\n\n\"Yes, and the main-hatch besides, and a lot of spun-yarn.  Of course\nthat's not strong enough for real service, but it will do for\nillustration.\"\n\nIn a few minutes the two hen-coops were placed face to face and lashed\nfirmly together, despite the remonstrative poultry.  Then the main-hatch\nwas laid upon the top, and fixed there by means of the iron rings at its\nfour corners.\n\n\"Now, Quin, fetch four of the cabin chairs,\" said the operator, \"and\nobserve, gentlemen, how much more easily and quickly this would have\nbeen accomplished if the coops, and hatch, and chairs had been made to\nfit into each other, with a view to this very purpose, with strong\nstraps and buckles in handy positions.  Now, then, for the chairs.\"\n\nAt each corner of this extemporised raft Jackman fastened one of the\ncabin chairs, pointing out, as he did so, that there was no limit to the\nextension of the raft.\n\n\"You see,\" he continued, \"all you would have to do, if the ship were\nproperly fitted out, would be to add chair to chair, bench to bench,\ncork mattress to mattress, until your raft was as big as you wanted; or\nyou could make two or three rafts, if preferable.\"\n\n\"But sure, sor, it would be an unstiddy machine intirely, an' given to\nwobblin',\" said Quin, who was one of those privileged men who not only\nwork for their wages, but generously throw their opinions into the\nbargain.\n\n\"It would not be more unsteady than the waves, Quin; and as to wobbling,\nthat would be an advantage, for a rigid raft in a rough sea would be\nmore liable to be damaged than one that was pliable.\"\n\nThe discussion about rafts and ship's boats which thus began was\ncontinued with much interest till lunchtime, for it chanced that John\nBarret was one of those men whose tendency of heart and mind is to turn\neverything to its best uses, and generally to strive after the highest\npoint of perfection in everything, with a view to the advancement of\nhuman felicity.  This tendency called into exercise his inventive\nfaculties, inducing him to search after improvements of all\ndescriptions.  Thus it was natural that he and Jackman should enter into\na keen controversy, as to what was the best method of constructing the\nraft in detail; and that, when the faithful Quin announced lunch as\nbeing, \"riddy, sor,\" the life-saving machine was left in an incomplete\nstate on the deck.\n\nThe interest attaching to this discussion had helped the three comrades\nand crew alike, to tide over what might otherwise have proved a tedious\nforenoon, for during the whole of that day the dense fog and profound\ncalm continued.\n\nOn returning to the deck the discussion was continued for a time, but\ngradually the interest flagged, then other subjects engaged attention,\nand the raft was finally allowed to lie undisturbed and forgotten.\n\n\"I don't know how it is,\" said Bob Mabberly; \"but somehow I always feel\na depression of spirits in a fog at sea.\"\n\n\"Explanation simple enough,\" returned Jackman; \"are we not constantly\nreading in the papers of ships being run down in fogs?  Where there is\nrisk there is always in some minds anxiety--in your case you call it\ndepression of spirits.\"\n\n\"Your explanation, Giles, uncomplimentary to me though it be, might have\nsome force if we were just now in the Channel, where being run down in\nfog is an event of frequent occurrence; but here, in a comparatively\nunfrequented sea, it would be strange indeed were I to be influenced by\nsuch possibilities.  What say you, Captain?\"\n\nMcPherson, who had sauntered towards the group, gazed in the direction\nwhere the horizon would have been visible had the fog been absent, and\nsaid:--\n\n\"Hm!--weel--\" and then stopped, as if for the purpose of mature\nconsideration.  The audience waited for the announcement of the oracle's\nopinion.\n\n\"Oo ay--weel, ye see, many persons are strangely influenced by\npossibeelities, what-e-ver.  There is a maiden aunt o' my own--she wass\nniver marrit, an' she wass niver likely to be, for besides bein' poor\nan' plain, an' mittle-aged, which are not in my opeenion objectionable,\nshe had an uncommon bad temper.  Yet she wass all her life influenced by\nthe notion that half the young men o' the place wass wantin' to marry\nher! though the possibeelities in her case wass fery small.\"\n\n\"I should like to 'ave know'd that old gurl!\" whispered Tips to Quin.\n\n\"Howld your tongue, ye spalpeen!\" whispered his friend in reply.\n\n\"Have you any idea, Captain, where we are now?\" asked Jackman.\n\n\"Oo ay, we're somewhere's wast'ard o' the Lewis.  But whether wast,\nnor'-wast, or sooth-wast, I could not say preceesely.  The nicht, ye\nsee, wass uncommon dark, an' when the fog came doon i' the mornin', I\ncould na' feel sure we had keep it the richt coorse, for the currents\nhereaboots are strang.  But we'll see whan it comes clear.\"\n\n\"Do you believe in presentiments, Giles?\" asked Barret, in an unusually\ngrave tone.\n\n\"Of course I do,\" answered Jackman.  \"I have a presentiment just now\nthat you are going to talk nonsense.\"\n\nBarret was not, however, to be silenced by his friend's jest.\n\n\"Listen,\" he said, earnestly, as he rose and stood in an attitude of\nintense attention.  \"It may be imagination playing with the subjects of\nour recent conversation, but I cannot help thinking that I hear the\nbeating of paddles.\"\n\n\"Keep a sherp look-oot, Shames,\" cried the skipper, suddenly, as he went\nforward with unwonted alacrity.\n\nA few minutes more and the sound which had at first been distinguished\nonly by Barret's sharp ear, became audible to all--the soft regular\npatting of a paddle-wheel steamer in the distance, yet clearly coming\ntowards them.  Presently a shrill sound, very faint but prolonged, was\nheard, showing that she was blowing her steam-whistle as a precaution.\n\n\"Strange, is it not, that the very thing we have been talking about\nshould happen?\" said Mabberly.\n\n\"Nay,\" returned Jackman, lightly, \"we were talking about being run down,\nand we have not yet come to that.\"\n\n\"The strangest thing of all to me,\" said Barret, \"is that, with a wide\nocean all round, vessels should ever run into each other at all, at\nleast on the open sea, for there is only one line, a few feet wide, in\nfavour of such an accident, whereas there are thousands of miles against\nit.\"\n\nJackman, who was a great theorist, here propounded a reason for this.\n\n\"If vessels would only hold straight on their courses, you see,\" he\nsaid, \"the accident of collision would be exceedingly rare, for,\nalthough thousands of ships might pass near to each other, not one in\nten thousand would meet; but when vessels come pretty near, their\ncommanders sometimes become anxious, take fancies into their heads, as\nto each having forgotten the `rules of the road,' and each attempting to\ncorrect the other--as we do sometimes in the streets--they bring about\nthe very disaster they are trying to avoid.\"\n\n\"Had we not better ring the bell, Captain?\" cried Mabberly, in rising\nexcitement.\n\n\"Oo ay, if you think so, sir.  Ring, poy!\"\n\nThe boy, who was getting alarmed, seized the tongue of the ship's bell,\nand rang with all his might.  Whether this had the effect to which\nJackman had referred, we cannot tell, but next moment what appeared to\nbe a mountain loomed out of the mist.  The steam-whistle had been silent\nfor some time, but as soon as the bell was heard it burst forth with\nincreased fury.  From the instant her form was dimly seen the fate of\nthe yacht was sealed.  There was a wild shouting on board the steamer,\nbut there was no time for action.\n\n\"Starboard hard!\" was the cry.\n\n\"Starboard it is!\" was the immediate answer.  But before the helm could\nact, the great rushing mass struck the _Fairy_ amidships, and literally\ncut her in two!\n\nThe awful suddenness of a catastrophe, which those on board had just\nbeen arguing was all but impossible, seemed to have paralysed every one,\nfor no one made the slightest effort to escape.  Perhaps the appearance\nof the wall-like bow of the steamer, without rope or projection of any\nkind to lay hold of, or jump at, might have conveyed the swift\nperception that their case was hopeless.  At all events, they all went\nunder with the doomed yacht, and nothing was left in the wake of the\nleviathan but a track of foam on the mist-encumbered sea.\n\nBut they were not lost!  One after another the wrecked party rose\nstruggling to the surface, and all of them could swim except the boy.\n\nGiles Jackman was the first who rose.  Treading water and brushing the\nhair out of his eyes, he gazed wildly about.  Barret came up close\nbeside him, almost a moment later.  He had barely taken breath, when the\nothers rose at various distances.  A cry not far from him caused him to\nturn.  It was poor Robin Tips, struggling for life.  A few powerful\nstrokes carried Barret alongside.  He got behind the boy, caught him\nunder the armpits, and thus held him, at arm's length, until he could\nquiet him.\n\n\"There is a spar, thank God!  Make for it, Barret, while I see to Quin,\"\nshouted Jackman.\n\nAs he spoke, they could hear the whistle of the steamer rushing away\nfrom them.\n\nBarret, forcing himself breast-high out of the water, glanced quickly\nround, and caught sight of the floating spar, to which his companion had\nreferred.  Although only a few yards off, the fog rendered it almost\ninvisible.\n\n\"Are you quiet now?\" demanded Barret, in a stern voice, for the\nterrified boy still showed something like a hysterical determination to\nturn violently round, and grasp his rescuer in what would probably have\nturned out to be the grip of death.\n\n\"Yes, sir, oh! yes.  But d-don't let me go!  M-mind, I can't swim!\"\n\n\"You are perfectly safe if you simply do nothing but what I tell you,\"\nreturned Barret, in a quiet, ordinary tone of voice, that reassured the\npoor lad more than the words.\n\nBy way of reply he suddenly became motionless, and as limp as a dead\neel.\n\nGetting gradually on his back, and drawing Tips slowly on to his chest,\nso that he rested with his mouth upwards, and his head entirely out of\nthe water, Barret struck out for the spar, swimming thus on his back.\n\nOn reaching it, he found to his surprise that it was the experimental\nraft, and that the captain, Mabberly, and McGregor were already clinging\nto it.\n\n\"Won't bear us all, I fear,\" said Mabberly; \"but thank God that we have\nit.  Put the boy on.\"\n\nIn order to do this, Barret had to get upon the raft, and he found that\nit bore him easily as well as the boy.\n\n\"Have you seen Jackman?\" asked Mabberly.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Barret, rising and looking round.\n\n\"Here he comes, towing Quin, I think, who seems to be stunned.  Hallo!\nThis way--hi!  Giles!\"\n\nBut Giles suddenly ceased to swim, turned over on his back, and lay as\nif dead.\n\n\"Rescue, Bob, rescue!\" shouted Barret, plunging into the water.\nMabberly followed, and soon had hold of Giles and his man by the hair.\n\n\"All right!\" said Jackman, turning round; \"I was only taking a rest.  No\none lost, I hope?\"\n\n\"No; all safe, so far.\"\n\n\"You can tow him in now.  I'm almost used up,\" said Jackman, making for\nthe raft.  \"He's only stunned, I think.\"\n\nIt was found that the Irishman had in truth been only stunned when they\nlifted him on to the raft, for he soon began to show signs of returning\nlife, and a large bump on his head sufficiently explained the nature of\nhis injury.\n\nBut when the whole party had cautiously clambered up on the raft it sank\nso deep that they scarcely dared to move.  To make matters worse, they\nclearly distinguished the steamer's whistle going farther and farther\naway, as if she were searching for them in a wrong direction.  This was\nindeed the case, and although they all shouted singly and together, the\nwhistle grew fainter by degrees, and finally died away.\n\nWith feelings approaching to despair, the crew of the frail raft began\nto talk of the prospect before them, when they were silenced by a slight\nmovement in the mist.  The white curtain was lifted for a few yards, and\nrevealed to their almost incredulous eyes a rocky shore, backed by a\nrange of precipitous cliffs, with a wild mountainous region beyond.\n\nAs the sea was still perfectly calm, there was no surf.  Our castaways,\ntherefore, with the exception of Quin and the boy, quietly slipped into\nthe water, and, with thankful hearts, propelled the raft vigorously\ntowards the shore.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THREE.\n\nTHE WRECK IS FOLLOWED BY REPOSE, REFRESHMENT, SURPRISE, AND DISASTER.\n\nThe distance from land was not more than a few hundred yards;\nnevertheless, it occupied a considerable time to pass over that space,\nthe raft being ill-adapted for quick progression through the water.\n\nClose to the shore there was a flat rock, to which, as they approached\nit, their attention was drawn by the appearance of what seemed to be\nliving creatures of some sort.  Quin and Robin Tips, sitting on the\nraft, naturally saw them first.\n\n\"I do belave it's men, for they're liftin' their hids an' lookin' at us.\nAv it was the South Says, now, I'd say they was saviges peepin' at us\nover the rocks.\"\n\n\"P'raps they're boys a-bathin',\" suggested Tips.\n\n\"Are they white?\" asked Captain McPherson, who, being chin-deep in the\nwater and behind the raft, could not see the rock referred to.\n\n\"No; sure they seem to be grey, or blue.\"\n\n\"Oo, they'll be seals,\" returned the skipper, nasally--a tone which is\neminently well adapted for sarcastic remark without the necessity of\nelaborate language.\n\n\"In coorse they is,\" said Tips; \"don't you see they're a-heavin' up\ntheir tails as well as their 'eads?\"\n\nOn advancing a few yards farther, all doubt upon the question was put at\nrest.  The animals, of which about a dozen were enjoying themselves on\nthe rock, raised themselves high on their flippers and gazed, with\nenormous eyes, at the strange-looking monster that was coming in from\nthe sea!  Thus they remained, apparently paralysed with astonishment,\nuntil the raft was within pistol-shot, and then, unable to endure the\nsuspense longer, they all slipped off into the sea.\n\nA few minutes later and the raft struck on the shore.  And well was it\nfor the party that the weather chanced to be so fine, for if there had\nbeen anything like a breeze, their frail contrivance would inevitably\nhave been dashed to pieces.  Even a slight swell from the westward would\nhave raised such a surf on that rugged shore that it would have been\nimpossible for the best of swimmers to have landed without broken limbs,\nif not loss of life.  As it was, they got ashore not only without\ndifficulty, but even succeeded in hauling the raft up on the beach\nwithout much damage to its parts--though, of course, the unfortunate\nfowls in the hen-coops had all perished!\n\nWhile Mabberly and the others were engaged in securing the raft, Barret\nwas sent off along shore with directions to ascertain whether there was\nany habitation near.  To his right the high cliffs came down so close to\nthe sea that it seemed very improbable that any cottage or hamlet could\nbe found in that direction.  He therefore turned towards the left, where\nthe cliffs receded some distance from the shore, leaving a narrow strip\nof meadow land.\n\nHurrying forward about a quarter of a mile, he stopped and looked about\nhim.  The sun was still high in the heavens--for the days are long and\nnights brief in that region during summer--and its rays had so far\nscattered the mists that all the low-lying land was clear, though the\nmountain-range inland was only visible a short distance above its base.\nThe effect of this was to enhance the weird grandeur of the view, for\nwhen the eye had traced the steep glens, overhanging cliffs, rugged\nwater-courses, and sombre corries upward to the point where all was lost\nin cloud, the imagination was set free to continue the scenery to\nillimitable heights.\n\nThe youth was still gazing upward, with solemnised feelings, when there\nwas presented to him one of those curious aspects of nature which are\nsometimes, though rarely, witnessed in mountainous regions.  Suddenly an\nopening occurred in the clouds--or mist--which shrouded the\nmountain-tops, and the summit of a stupendous cliff bathed in rich\nsunshine, was seen as if floating in the air.  Although obviously part\nof the mountain near the base of which he stood, this cliff--completely\nisolated as it was--seemed a magical effect, and destitute of any real\nconnection with earth.\n\nWhile he was looking in wonder and admiration at the sight, he observed\na bird hovering about motionless in the blue vault high above the\ncliffs.  Although inexperienced in such scenery and sights, Barret knew\nwell enough that nothing but an eagle--and that of the largest size--\ncould be visible at all at such a distance.  Suddenly the bird sailed\ndownwards with a grand circular sweep, and was lost among the shadows of\nthe perpendicular rocks.  A few minutes more and the mists drifted over\nthe opening, causing the vision to disappear.\n\nThis was Barret's first view of the Eagle Cliff, which was destined to\nexercise a powerful and lasting influence upon his fortunes!\n\nA few yards beyond this the explorer came upon a sheep track, and a\nlittle farther on he found one of those primitive roads which are formed\nin wild out-of-the-way places by the passage of light country carts,\nwith the aid of a few rounded stones where holes required to be filled\nup, or soft places strengthened.  Following it a short distance to a\nspot where it ran between a precipice and the shore, he came suddenly in\nsight of a wilderness of fallen rocks, which were varied in size from\nmere pebbles to masses the size of an omnibus.  These had all fallen\nfrom a steep spur of the mountains which projected towards the sea of\nthat place.  The whole of the level land at the base of the spur was\nstrewn with them; some being old, moss-covered and weather-worn, others\nfresh and sharp in outline, as if they had fallen only the previous\nwinter, as probably they had, for the places from which they had been\ndislodged could be seen still fresh and light-coloured, nearly a\nthousand feet up on the riven cliffs.  It was a species of desolation\nthat powerfully recalled some scenes in Dante's \"Inferno,\" and had a\ndepressing effect on the youth's spirits, for nothing seemed more\nunlikely than the existence of a human habitation in such a place.\n\nA new view of the matter broke upon him, however, when he suddenly\nbecame aware that a spot in the confused scene which he had taken to be\na clump of withered bracken was in reality a red cow!  Looking a little\nmore narrowly at objects he soon perceived a hut among the rocks.  It\nwas so small and rude and rugged as almost to escape detection.  A\nfurious barking soon told that he had been seen, and two collie dogs\nrushed towards him with demonstrations that threatened him with\nimmolation on the spot.  The uproar put life into a few more clumps of\nred bracken, and produced a lively display of sheep and cattle\nthroughout the region.\n\nBarret walked straight up to the door of the hut, and the collies\nwithdrew from the attack--as most noisy demonstrators do when treated\nwith silent indifference.\n\n\"Is there any one inside?\" he asked of a bare-legged, shaggy-headed boy,\nwho came out and gazed at him, apparently with his mouth as well as his\neyes.\n\n\"Na,\" answered the boy.\n\n\"Any other cottages or houses near this?\"\n\n\"Ay; yonder.\"\n\nThe boy pointed in the direction of the sea, where, in a stony nook\nbetween two jutting masses of rock, nestled about a dozen huts built of\nboulder stones gathered from the sea-shore.  So small were these huts,\nand so stupendous the rocks around them, that they might easily have\nbeen overlooked by a careless eye.  So might the half-dozen\nfishing-boats that lay in the little cove beside them.\n\nA stream or rivulet--better known in Scotland as a burn--ran past the\nhamlet, formed a pool just below it, and dropped into the cove close to\nthe place where the boats lay.\n\nRejoiced to find even the poorest kind of shelter in such a place,\nBarret hastened down to the cove, and, tapping at the door of the\nlargest of the cottages, was bidden \"come in\" by a soft voice.\n\nEntering, he was surprised to find a neatly, though plainly, furnished\nroom, which was evidently the kitchen of the house--indeed, the sole\nroom, with the exception of an off-shoot closet.  The large open\nfireplace contained a peat fire on the hearth, over which hung a\nbubbling pot.  There were two box-beds opposite the fire, and in the\nwall which faced the door there was a very small window, containing four\npanes of glass, each of which had a knot in the middle of it.  One of\nthem also presented the phenomenon of a flattened nose, for the boy with\nthe ragged head had rushed down and stationed himself there to observe\nthe result of the unexpected and singular visit.\n\nBeside the window, in a homely arm-chair, sat an invalid girl with pale\nthin cheeks, bright blue eyes, and long flaxen hair.  If not pretty, she\nwas, at all events, extremely interesting, and possessed the great charm\nof a winning smile.\n\nApologising for causing her alarm by his damp, dishevelled, and sudden\nappearance, Barret asked if there were any men about the place.\n\nNo, there were none there at the moment; most of them being out after\nthe sheep and cattle, and some gathering peat, or away in the boats.\n\n\"But surely they have not left you all by yourself?\" said Barret, struck\nnot only by the appearance of the girl, but by the comparative\nrefinement of her language.\n\n\"Oh no!\" she replied, with a slight smile; \"they look well after me.\nMrs Anderson has only gone to fetch some peats.  But where have you\ncome from, sir?  Your clothes are all wet!\"\n\n\"You are right.  I have just been saved from drowning, through God's\nmercy, along with my companions.\"\n\nHere Barret gave her a brief outline of the recent disaster, and then\nasked if Mrs Anderson was her mother.\n\n\"No; she is my aunt, but she is very good to me; takes as much care of\nme as if I was her own daughter.  I don't belong to this place.  They\nhave sent me here for my health.\"\n\nAt this point they were interrupted by Mrs Anderson herself, who\nentered with a load of peat, which she flung down, shook her fist at the\nnose-flattener outside, and turned in astonishment to her visitor.\n\nOf course our shipwrecked friend had to retail his story to the woman,\nand then learned from her that the island was a very large one, with a\nname unpronounceable by English lips, that it was very thinly inhabited,\nthat it consisted almost entirely of pasture land, and that \"the laird\"\nowned a large portion of it, including the little fishing village of\n\"Cove.\"\n\nWhile the woman was speaking an elderly man entered, whom she introduced\nas her husband Ian.  To him Barret had to re-repeat his story, and then\nasked if he and his friends could obtain shelter in the village for the\nnight.\n\n\"Iss it shelter ye'll be wantin'?  Ye'll hev that an' welcome, though it\nwill be of the poorest.  But in the mornin' ye'll gang up to the hoose,\nfor the laird wud be ill-pleased if we keepit ye here.\"\n\n\"Pray, who is this laird?\" asked Barret; \"your wife has already\nmentioned him.\"\n\n\"Maister Gordon is his name.  He lives near the heed o' Loch Lossie.  It\niss over eight mile from here,\" said Ian; \"an' a coot shentleman he iss,\ntoo.  Fery fond o' company, though it iss not much company that comes\nthis way, for the steam-poats don't veesit the loch reg'lar or often.\nHe'll be fery glad to see you, sir, an' to help ye to git home.  But\nwe'd petter be goin' to tell your freen's that we can putt them up for\nthe nicht.  I'll go pack with ye, an we'll take the poy to help an'\ncarry up their things.\"\n\n\"You forget that we have been wrecked,\" returned Barret with a laugh,\n\"and have no `things' to carry, except our own damp carcases.\"\n\n\"That's true, sir, but we'll be none the worse o' the poy, what-e-ver.\nCome away, Tonal',\" said Ian, as they started back along the shore.  \"It\niss under the Eagle Cliff where ye came to laund, I make no doot?\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose it was; at least, there is a range of cliffs close to\nthe place where our raft struck.\"\n\n\"Oo ay--but it iss not the wee precipices, it iss the big hull behind\nthem that we ca' the Eagle Cliff.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed!  I saw that cliff in a peculiar manner as I came along,\"\nsaid Barret giving a description of the scene.\n\n\"Ay; it iss sometimes seen like that,\" said Ian; \"an' we often see the\neagle, but it's no' possible to git a shot at that crater.  The laird is\nreal keen to bring it doon, for it plays the mischief among the lambs,\nan' him an' his freen's hes aften tried, but they hev not manicht it\nyet.\"\n\nThus chatting they soon reached the raft, and found the disconsolate\nparty waiting impatiently for them.\n\n\"Shall we leave it where it lies, or drag it further up on the beach?\"\nasked Mabberly, referring to the raft.\n\n\"Ye petter haul it a wee higher up,\" said Ian, examining the machine\nwith much interest; \"for when it comes on to plow there's a heavy sea\nhere.  Weel, weel, but it iss a strange contrivance!\"\n\n\"Ay; an' also a useful one,\" said the skipper, drily--at least as duly\nas was possible in the circumstance.\n\n\"Noo, shentlemen, I think we had petter be goin'.\"\n\nIt was indeed time, for although the weather was warm and fine, the sun\nhad set, and their damp garments began to feel uncomfortable.\n\nAt the Cove the whole party was accommodated in a single-roomed hut,\nwhich chanced to be empty at the time.  Here the hospitable fishermen\nspread nets for bedding, and with plaids made up for the lack of\nblankets.  They also kindled a large peat fire, and put on a pot of\npotatoes, and some splendid sea-trout, while Mrs Anderson prepared\noat-cakes at her own fire, and sent them in as required.\n\n\"Noo, shentlemen, ye'll tak a tram?\" said Ian, producing a black bottle.\n\nImmeasurable was the astonishment of the Highlander when the gentlemen\nrefused a dram.\n\n\"But--but, ye'll catch yer death o' cauld, if ye don't!\" he said,\nremonstratively, as he stood bottle and glass in hand.\n\n\"Thanks, friend,\" replied Jackman, \"but we have taken in so much salt\nwater during our swim to land that we are not sure whether the whisky\nwould agree with it.\"\n\n\"Hoots! havers!\" exclaimed Ian, pouring out some of the liquid; \"ye're\njokin'.\"\n\n\"In truth we are not, then,\" said Mabberly; \"for we are all total\nabstainers.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" exclaimed Ian, who could not understand the principles or\nfeelings of men who, after a long exhausting swim in their clothes, were\ncapable of refusing whisky!  For it is to be remembered that, although\nthe time we write of is comparatively recent, that remote island had not\nbeen visited by any apostle of temperance or total abstinence in regard\nto alcohol.  Of course Ian had heard something of such principles, but\nhe did not believe in them, and certainly did not practise them.\n\"Hooiver, shentlemen,\" he added, \"if ye wunna tak it--here's wushin'\nyour fery coot health!\"\n\nRaising the glass, he drained it without winking, as if the contents had\nbeen water, smacked his lips and put the bottle away.\n\nIt must not be supposed that all the crew of the late unfortunate\n_Fairy_ witnessed this proceeding unmoved, for, although they had all\nbeen engaged on the understanding that no strong drink was to be allowed\nor consumed while the voyage lasted, not one of them was a pledged\nabstainer, and now that the voyage was ended it did seem as if the laws\nof the voyage should no longer be binding.  Still there remained a\nfeeling that, as long as they continued a united party, the spirit of\nthe agreement should not be broken; therefore the skipper and \"Shames\"\nlet the bottle pass with a sigh, and Quin followed suit with an\nundertoned remark to Tips that, \"he wouldn't have belaved tim'tation to\nbe so strong av he hadn't wrastled wid it!\"\n\nBy that time most of the men of the hamlet had returned, and a rig out\nof fisher clothes was lent to each of the unfortunates, so that they\nwere enabled to pass the night in comfort while their own garments were\nin front of a good fire.\n\n\"Is that sick girl your daughter, Ian?\" asked Giles Jackman that night,\nas he walked on the shore with his host before retiring to rest.\n\n\"No, sir; she's a niece--the daughter of a brother o' mine who hes\nfeathered his nest petter than me.  He's a well-to-do grocer in Oban,\nan' hes geen his bairn a pretty good edication; but it's my opeenion\nthey hev all but killed her wi' their edication, for the doctor has telt\nthem to stop it altogither, an' send her here for a change o' air.\"\n\n\"Indeed!  An interesting child, and so well-mannered, too,\" remarked\nJackman.\n\n\"Humph!  Nae doot she is.  They do say that it's because my brither has\ngotten an English wife.  But for my pairt, oor weemen seem to me to be\nas weel mainered as the weemen sooth o' the Tweed.\"\n\n\"Quite as well, I doubt not; though I have not seen much of your\ncountrywomen, Ian.  Besides, good manners are to be judged by varying\nstandards.  What is good in the opinion of the Eskimo may be thought\nvery bad by the Hindoo, and _vice versa_.  It is very much a matter of\ntaste.  The manners of your niece, at all events, are admirable.  Now it\nis time to turn in.  Good-night, Ian.\"\n\nThe sun was high next morning when the wrecked men awoke, and began to\nfeel the outcries of nature with reference to breakfast.  Long before\nthat time the men of Cove had gone off to the hills, the peat-hags, or\nthe sea, according to their respective callings.  But Mrs Anderson had\na sumptuous breakfast of oatmeal porridge and fresh milk ready for the\nstrangers.\n\n\"Musha! but it'll make me mouth wather all the afthernoon thinkin' of\nit,\" said Quin, on finishing his second plateful.\n\n\"It's prime wittles,\" remarked Tips, as he helped himself to more.\n\n\"Now, Barret, have you finished?\" asked Mabberly.\n\n\"No; why?\"\n\n\"Because, in the first place, you are evidently eating too much for your\nhealth, and, in the second place, I want you to go up to what Ian calls\nthe Hoose, as a deputation to the laird.  You see, although we are\nforced, as it were, to throw ourselves on his hospitality, I don't quite\nlike to descend on him all at once with the whole strength of our party.\nIt will be better for one of us to break the ice, and as you are the\nbest-looking and most hypocritically urbane, when you choose, I think we\ncould not do better than devolve the duty upon you.\"\n\n\"Right, Bob, as usual; but don't you think,\" said Barret, helping\nhimself to another ladleful of the porridge, \"that my going may cut in\ntwo directions?  Doubtless the laird would be agreeably surprised to\nmeet with me; but then that will raise his expectations so high, that he\nwill be woefully disappointed on meeting with _you_!\"\n\n\"Come, friends,\" cried Jackman, \"it is dangerous to play with edged\ntools immediately after a meal.  My medical knowledge assures me of\nthat.  I quite approve of Barret forming the deputation, and the sooner\nhe starts off the better.  The rest of us will assist Ian to fish in his\nabsence.\"\n\nThus authorised and admonished, Barret finished breakfast, put on his\nown garments--which, like those of his companions, were semi-nautical--\nand sallied forth for an eight miles' walk over the mountains to the\nmansion of the laird, which lay on the other side of the Eagle's Cliff\nridge, on the shores of Loch Lossie.\n\nHe was guided the first part of the journey by Tonal' with the ragged\nhead, who, with an activity that seemed inexhaustible, led him up into\nwild and rugged places such as he had never before dreamed of--rocky\nfastnesses which, looked at from below, seemed inaccessible, even to\ngoats, but which, on being attempted, proved to be by no means beyond\nthe powers of a steady head and strong limbs.\n\nReaching the summit of a heather-clad knoll that projected from a\nprecipitous part of the mountain-side, Barret paused to recover breath\nand look back at the calm sea.  It lay stretched out far below him,\nlooking, with its numerous islets in bird's-eye view, somewhat like a\nmap.  The mists had completely cleared away, and the sun was glittering\non the white expanse like a line of light from the shore to the horizon.\nNever before had our Englishman felt so like a bird, both as to the\npoint of vision from which he surveyed the glorious scene, and the\ninternal sensation of joy which induced him not only to wish that he\ncould fly, but to think that a very little more of such exultation of\nspirit would enable him to do so!\n\n\"Is that the Cove down there?\" he asked of the ragged companion who\nstood beside him.\n\n\"Ay, that's the Cove!\"\n\n\"Why, Donald, it looks like a mere speck in the scene from here, and the\nmen look no bigger than crows.\"\n\nAs this observation called for no answer none was given, and Donald\nseemed to regard his companion as one who was rather weak-minded.\n\n\"Have we come half-way yet, Donald?\"\n\n\"No--no' near.\"\n\n\"Is it difficult to find the rest of the way from this point?\"\n\n\"No; but it wad be diffeecult to miss it.\"\n\n\"Well, Donald, my boy, I have a strong desire to be alone--that is, to\ntry if I cannot go the rest of the way without guidance; so, if you will\njust give me a little direction, I'll let you go home, and many thanks\nfor coming thus far.  Now, point out the landmarks.\"\n\nHe turned, as he spoke, towards the grand mountain that still towered\nbehind him.\n\n\"There's naethin' t' pint oot,\" returned the boy; \"ye've only t' haud on\nby this sheep track till ee come close under the cliff yonder.\"\n\n\"The Eagle Cliff?\"\n\n\"Ay.  It'll bring ee to a cairt road, an' ye've only to follow that\nthrough the pass, an' haud on till ee come to the hoose.  Ye can see the\nhoose frae the other side o' the pass.\"\n\n\"And what is the `hoose' called?\" asked Barret.\n\n\"Kinlossie.\"\n\n\"Thank you.  Good-bye, my boy.\"\n\nA few coppers sent the youth of the ragged head away in high spirits.\nThe young man watched him till he was concealed by a clump of small\nbirch trees that hung like a fringe on the top of a neighbouring\nprecipice.  Barret had just turned to continue the ascent to the Eagle\nCliff, whose frowning battlements still rose high above him, when a wild\nshout from the boy made him turn and look anxiously back.  The place\nwhich he had reached was strewn with great masses of rock that had\nfallen from the cliffs.  He was about to clamber on to one of these, in\norder to obtain a better view, when the cause of the shout became\nobvious.  A splendid stag, frightened from its lair by the boy, burst\nfrom the birchwood, and, with antlers laid well back, bounded up the\nslope towards him.  It was closely followed by two does.\n\nBarret crouched at once behind the mass of rock.  The deer, thinking,\ndoubtless, only of the danger behind, had failed to observe him.\n\n\"Oh for Giles, with his rifle!\" thought the youth, as the agile\ncreatures passed within less than a hundred yards of him, and headed\nstraight for the pass of the Eagle Cliff.\n\nScarcely had the thought occurred, when a flapping noise behind caused\nhim to turn quickly.  It was the eagle himself, sailing majestically and\nslowly overhead, as though he knew full well that an Englishman without\na gun was a harmless creature!\n\nConsiderably excited by these unexpected and, to him, stirring sights,\nBarret pushed steadily upward, and soon reached a part of the pass\nwhence he could see the valley beyond, with a house in the far\ndistance--which, of course, must be Kinlossie--standing in a clump of\nwood on the margin of an inlet of the sea, known by the name of Loch\nLossie.\n\nBut a far more astonishing sight than anything he had beheld that\nmorning was yet in store for Barret.  On turning round a projecting rock\nat the foot of the Eagle Cliff, he suddenly came upon a young girl,\nlying on the road as if dead!\n\nSpringing towards her, he knelt and raised her head.  There was no blood\nupon the face, which was deadly pale, and no apparent injury.  She did\nnot seem to breathe, but on feeling her pulse he fancied that he felt a\nflutter there.  A feeling of desperate regret passed through him as he\nthought of his utter destitution alike of medical or surgical knowledge.\nBut Barret was not by any means a helpless man.  Running to one of the\nmany streams of water which trickled from the cliff, he filled the top\nof his wideawake therewith, and, returning, laved the girl's face, and\npoured a little into her mouth.\n\nHis efforts were successful.  She recovered consciousness, opened her\neyes, and asked, with a confused look, what was the matter.\n\n\"You must have had a fall, dear child; but you'll be better presently.\nLet me raise you.\"\n\nThe girl tried to rise, but, with a sharp cry of pain, fell back again\nunconscious.\n\nBarret soon ascertained that one of the poor girl's arms was severely\nbruised, perhaps broken.  He knew not what to do, but he knew that the\ngreatest present evil was delay.  He therefore wrapped her in the\nshepherd's plaid which she wore, and raised her as gently as possible in\nhis arms--making use of the plaid as a sort of sling, with part of it\nround his own neck.  Then, thanking God for the strong limbs and muscles\nwith which he had been endowed, he set off with vigorous tread for\nKinlossie House.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOUR.\n\nTHE FAMILY AT KINLOSSIE.\n\nSerenity was the prevailing feature in the character of old Allan\nGordon, the laird of Kinlossie; but when that amiable, portly, grand,\nsilver-headed old gentleman suddenly met an unknown young man of fine\nproportions carrying his favourite niece, wrapped up as a bundle in his\narms, all his serenity disappeared, and he stared, glared, almost\ngasped, with mingled astonishment and consternation.\n\nA very brief explanation, however, quickly sufficed to charge his\nsusceptible spirit to overflowing with a compound of grave anxiety and\nheartfelt gratitude.\n\n\"Come in, my dear sir, come in; luckily our doctor is spending the day\nwith me.  But for you, my poor dear Milly might have been--This way, to\nher own room.  Are you sure the arm is broken?\"\n\n\"I fear so,\" replied Barret, entering the mansion; but before he could\nproceed farther his words were drowned in a shriek of surprise from four\nlittle Gordons, aged from sixteen to four, who yelled rather than\ndemanded to know what ailed their cousin--ranging from Archie's, \"What's\nwrong with Cousin Milly,\" to Flora's, \"Wass wong wid Cuzn Miwy?\"\n\nBy that time Mrs Gordon, a pleasant-voiced lady, with benignity in her,\nlooks, appeared on the scene, followed quickly by a man and several maid\nservants, all of whom added to the confusion, in the midst of which\nCousin Milly was conveyed to her room and deposited on her bed.  The\nfamily doctor, a rotund little man of fifty-five, was speedily in\nattendance.\n\n\"So fortunate that the doctor happens to be here,\" said the laird, as he\nled Barret to the library and offered him a glass of wine.  \"No! you\ndon't drink?  Well, well, as you please.  Here, Duncan, fetch milk,\nlemonade, coffee, hot, at once.  You must be tired after carrying her so\nfar, even though she _is_ a light weight.  But, forgive me; in my\nanxiety about my poor niece I have quite forgotten to ask either your\nname or how you came here, for no steamer has been to the island for a\nweek past.  Pray be seated, and, wherever you may be bound for\nultimately, make up your mind that my house is to be your home for a\nweek at least.  We suffer no visitor ever to leave us under that\nperiod.\"\n\n\"You are very kind,\" returned the young man, smiling, \"and I accept your\nproffered hospitality most gladly.  My name is John Barret.  I came to\nthe other side of the island in a yacht, and swam on shore in my clothes\nwith six companions, spent the night at Cove, and have walked over here\nto make known these facts to you.\"\n\n\"You speak in riddles, my young friend,\" returned the laird, with an\namused look.\n\n\"Yet I speak the truth,\" returned Barret, who thereupon gave a\ncircumstantial account of the disaster that had befallen himself and his\nfriends.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" said Mr Gordon, rising; throwing up the window he shouted\nto a man who was passing at the moment, \"Roderick, get the big\nwaggonette ready to go to Cove, and bring it round here as fast as you\ncan.  You see,\" he added to Barret, \"the road is considerably longer\nthan the short cut by which you came, and we must have them all over\nhere without delay.  Don't distress yourself about room.  We have plenty\nof accommodation.  But come, I'll take you to your own room, and when\nyou have made yourself comfortable, we will talk over your future plans.\nJust let me say, however, to prevent your mind running away on wrong\nideas, that in the circumstances we won't allow you to leave us for two\nmonths.  The post goes out to-morrow, so you can write to your father\nand tell him so.\"\n\nThus running on in a rich hearty voice, the hospitable Allan Gordon\nconducted Barret to a room in the southern wing of the rambling old\nedifice, and left him there to meditate on his good fortune, and enjoy\nthe magnificent prospect of the island-studded firth, or fiord, from\nwhich the mansion derived its name.\n\nWhile the waggonette was away for the rest of the wrecked party, the\nlaird, finding that Milly's arm was not actually broken, though severely\nbruised, sat down to lunch with restored equanimity, and afterwards\ndrove Barret in his dog-cart to various parts of his estate.\n\n\"Your friends cannot arrive for several hours, you see,\" he said on\nstarting, \"and we don't dine till seven; so you could not be better\nengaged than in making acquaintance with the localities of our beautiful\nisland.  It may seem a little wild to you in its scenery, but there are\nthousands of picturesque points, and what painters call `bits' about it,\nas my sweet little Milly Moss will tell you when she recovers; for she\nis an enthusiastic painter, and has made innumerable drawings, both in\nwater-colour and oils, since she came to stay here.  I cannot tell you\nhow grateful I am to you, Mr Barret, for rescuing the poor girl from\nher perilous position.\"\n\n\"I count myself fortunate indeed in having been led to the spot so\nopportunely,\" said Barret; \"and I sincerely hope that no evil effects\nmay result from her injuries.  May I ask if she resides permanently with\nyou at Kinlossie?\"\n\n\"I wish she did,\" said the laird, fervently; \"for she is like a sunbeam\nin the house.  No, we have only got the loan of her, on very strict\nconditions too, from her mother, who is a somewhat timid lady of an\nanxious temperament.  I've done my best to fulfil the conditions, but\nthey are not easy.\"\n\n\"Indeed!  How is that?\"\n\n\"Well, you see, my sister is firmly convinced that there is deadly\ndanger in wet feet, and one of her conditions is that Milly is not to be\nallowed to wet her feet.  Now you know it is not easy for a Londoner to\nunderstand the difficulty of keeping one's feet dry while skipping over\nthe mountains and peat-hags of the Western Isles.\"\n\n\"From which I conclude that Mrs Moss is a Londoner,\" returned Barret,\nwith a laugh.\n\n\"She is.  Although a Gordon, and born in the Argyll Highlands, she was\nsent to school in London, where she was married at the age of seventeen,\nand has lived there ever since.  Her husband is dead, and nothing that I\nhave been able to say has yet tempted her to pay me a visit.  She\nregards my home here as a wild, uninhabitable region, though she has\nnever seen it, and besides, is getting too old and feeble to venture, as\nshe says, on a long voyage.  Certes, she is not yet feeble in mind,\nwhatever she may be in body; but she's a good, amiable, affectionate\nwoman, and I have no fault to find with her, except in regard to her\nsevere conditions about Milly, and her anxiety to get her home again.\nAfter all, it is not to be wondered at, for Milly is her only child; and\nI am quite sure if I had not gone to London, and made all sorts of\npromises to be extremely careful of Milly and personally take her home\nagain, she never would have let her come at all.  See, there is one of\nMilly's favourite views,\" said the laird, pulling up, and pointing with\nhis whip to the scene in front, where a range of purple hills formed a\nfine background to the loch, with its foreground of tangle-covered\nstones; \"she revels in depicting that sort of thing.\"\n\nBarret, after expressing his thorough approval of the young girl's taste\nin the matter of scenery, asked if Milly's delicate health was the cause\nof her mother's anxiety.\n\n\"Delicate health!\" exclaimed the laird.  \"Why, man, sylph-like though\nshe appears, she has got the health of an Amazon.  No, no, there's\nnothing wrong with my niece, save in the imagination of my sister.  We\nwill stop at this cottage for a few minutes.  I want to see one of my\nmen, who is not very well.\"\n\nHe pulled up at the door of a little stone hut by the roadside, which\npossessed only one small window and one chimney, the top of which\nconsisted of an old cask, with the two ends knocked out.  A bare-legged\nboy ran out of the hut to hold the horse.\n\n\"Is your brother better to-day?\" asked the laird.\n\n\"No, sir; he's jist the same.\"\n\n\"Mind your head,\" said the laird, as he stooped to pass the low doorway,\nand led his friend into the hut.\n\nThe interior consisted of one extremely dirty room, in which the\nconfined air was further vitiated by tobacco smoke, and the fumes of\nwhisky.  One entire side of it was occupied by two box-beds, in one of\nwhich lay a brawny, broad-shouldered man, with fiery red hair and\nscarcely less fiery red eyes, which seemed to glare out of the dark den\nin which he lay.\n\n\"Well, Ivor, are ye not better to-day, man?\"\n\nThere was a sternness in Mr Gordon's query, which not only surprised\nbut grieved his young companion; and the surprise was increased when the\nsick man replied in a surly tone--\n\n\"Na, laird, I'm not better; an' what's more, I'll not be better till my\nheed's under the sod.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you are right, Ivor,\" returned the laird, in a somewhat\nsofter tone; \"for when a man won't help himself, no one else can help\nhim.\"\n\n\"Help myself!\" exclaimed the man, starting up on one elbow, and gazing\nfiercely from under his shaggy brows.  \"Help myself!\" he repeated.  And\nthen, as if resolving suddenly to say no more, he sank down and laid his\nhead on the pillow, with a short groan.\n\n\"Here, Ivor, is a bottle o' physic that my wife sends to ye,\" said Mr\nGordon, pulling a pint bottle from his pocket, and handing it to the\nman, who clutched it eagerly, and was raising it to his mouth when his\nvisitor arrested his hand.\n\n\"Hoot, man,\" he said, with a short laugh, \"it's not whisky!  She bid me\nsay ye were to take only half a glass at a time, every two hours.\"\n\n\"Poor't oot, then, laird--poor't oot,\" said the man, impatiently.\n\"Ye'll fin' a glass i' the wundy.\"\n\nFetching a wine-glass from the window Mr Gordon half filled it with a\nliquid of a dark brown colour, which the sick man quaffed with almost\nfierce satisfaction, and then lay down with a sigh.\n\n\"It seems to have done ye good already, man,\" said the laird, putting\nthe bottle and glass on that convenient shelf--the window-sill.  \"I've\nno idea what the physic is, but my good wife seems to know, and that's\nenough for me; and for you, too, I think.\"\n\n\"Ay, she's a good wumin.  Thank her for me,\" responded Ivor.\n\nRemounting the dog-cart the old gentleman explained, as they drove\nalong, that Ivor Donaldson's illness was the result of intemperance.\n\n\"He is my gamekeeper,\" said the laird; \"and there is not a better or\nmore trustworthy man in the island, when he is sober; but when he takes\none of his drinking fits, he seems to lose all control over himself, and\ngoes from bad to worse, till a fit of _delirium tremens_ almost kills\nhim.  He usually goes for a good while after that without touching a\ndrop, and at such times he is a most respectful, painstaking man,\nwilling to take any amount of trouble to serve one, but when he breaks\ndown he is as bad as ever--nay, even worse.  My wife and I have done\nwhat we could for him, and have tried to get him to take the temperance\npledge, but hitherto without avail.  My wife has even gone the length of\nbecoming a total abstainer, in order to have more influence over him;\nbut I don't quite see my way to do that myself.\"\n\n\"Then _you_ have not yet done all that you could for the man, though\nyour wife has,\" thought Barret; but he did not venture to say so.\n\nAt this point in the conversation they reached a place where the road\nleft the shores of the loch and ascended into the hills.  Being rather\nsteep at its lower end, they alighted and walked; the laird pointing\nout, as they ascended, features in the landscape which he thought would\ninterest his young guest.\n\n\"Yonder,\" he said, pointing to a wood on the opposite side of the\nvalley, \"yonder is a good piece of cover for deer.  The last time we had\na drive there we got three, one o' them a stag with very fine antlers.\nIt was there that a young friend of mine, who was not much accustomed to\nsporting, shot a red cow in mistake for a deer!  The same friend knocked\nover five or six of my tame ducks, under the impression that they were\nwild ones, because he found them among the heather!  Are you fond of\nsport?\"\n\n\"Not particularly,\" answered Barret; \"that is, I am not personally much\nof a sportsman, though I have great enjoyment in going out with my\nsporting friends and watching their proceedings.  My own tastes are\nrather scientific.  I am a student of natural history--a botanist and\ngeologist--though I lay no claim to extensive knowledge of science.\"\n\n\"Ah! my young friend, then you will find a powerful sympathiser in my\nniece Milly--that is, when the poor child gets well--for she is half mad\non botany.  Although only two weeks have passed since she came to us,\nshe has almost filled her room with specimens of what she calls rare\nplants.  I sometimes tease her by saying it is fortunate that bracken\ndoes not come under that head, else she'd pull it all up and leave no\ncover for the poor rabbits.  She has also half-filled several huge books\nwith gummed-in specimens innumerable, though I can't see that she does\nmore than write their names below them.\"\n\n\"And that is no small advance in the science, let me tell you,\" returned\nBarret, who was stirred up to defend his co-scientist.  \"No one can\nsucceed in anything who does not take the first steps, and undergo the\ndrudgery manfully.\"\n\n\"Womanfully, in this case, my friend; but do not imagine that I\nunderrate my little niece.  My remark was to the effect that I do not\nsee that she _does_ more, though I have no manner of doubt that her\npretty little head _thinks_ a great deal more.  Now we will get up here,\nas the road is more level for a bit.  D'you see the group of alders down\nin the hollow yonder, where the little stream that runs through the\nvalley takes a sudden bend?  There's a deep pool there, where a good\nmany sea-trout congregate.  You shall try it soon--that is, if you care\nfor fishing.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I like fishing,\" said Barret.  \"It is a quiet, contemplative\nkind of sport.\"\n\n\"Contemplative!\" exclaimed the old gentleman with a laugh; \"well, yes,\nit is, a little.  Sometimes you get down into the bed of the stream with\nconsiderable difficulty, and you have to contemplate the banks a long\ntime, occasionally, before deciding as to which precipice is least\nlikely to give you a broken neck.  Yes, it is a contemplative sport.  As\nto quiet, that depends very much on what your idea of quietude may be.\nOur burn descends for two or three miles in succession of leaps and\nbounds.  If the roaring of cataracts is quieting to you, there is no end\nof it down there.  See, the pool that I speak of is partly visible now,\nwith the waterfall above it.  You see it?\"\n\n\"Yes, I see it.\"\n\n\"We call it Mac's pool,\" continued the laird, driving on, \"because it is\na favourite pool of an old school companion of mine, named MacRummle,\nwho is staying with us just now.  He tumbles into it about once a week.\"\n\n\"Is that considered a necessary part of the process of fishing?\" asked\nBarret.\n\n\"No, it may rather be regarded as an eccentric addition peculiar to\nMacRummle.  The fact is, that my good friend is rather too old to fish\nnow; but his spirit is still so juvenile, and his sporting instincts are\nso keen, that he is continually running into dangerous positions and\ngetting into scrapes.  Fortunately he is very punctual in returning to\nmeals; so if he fails to appear at the right time, I send off one of my\nmen to look for him.  I have offered him a boy as an attendant, but he\nprefers to be alone.\"\n\n\"There seems to be some one down at the pool now,\" remarked Barret,\nlooking back.\n\n\"No doubt it is MacRummle himself,\" said the laird, pulling up.  \"Ay,\nand he seems to be making signals to us.\"\n\n\"Shall I run down and see what he wants?\" asked Barret.\n\n\"Do; you are active, and your legs are strong.  It will do you good to\nscramble a little.\"\n\nLeaping the ditch that skirted the road, the youth soon crossed the belt\nof furze and heather that lay between him and the river, about which he\nand his host had been conversing.  Being unaccustomed to the nature of\nthe Western Isles, he was a little surprised to find the country he had\nto cross extremely rugged and broken, and it taxed all the activity for\nwhich the laird had given him credit, as well as his strength of limb,\nto leap some of the peat-hags and water-courses that came in his way.\nHe was too proud of his youthful vigour to pick his steps round them!\nOnly once did he make a slip in his kangaroo-like bounds, but that slip\nlanded him knee-deep in a bog of brown mud, out of which he dragged his\nlegs with difficulty.\n\nGaining the bank of the river at last, he soon came up to the fisher,\nwho was of sturdy build, though somewhat frail from age, and dressed in\nbrown tweed garments, with a dirty white wideawake, the crown of which\nwas richly decorated with casting-lines and hooks, ranging from small\nbrown hackle to salmon-fly.  But the striking thing about him was that\nhis whole person was soaking wet.  Water dripped from the pockets of his\nshooting coat, dribbled from the battered brim of his wideawake, and,\nflowing from his straightened locks, trickled off the end of his Roman\nnose.\n\n\"You have been in the water, I fear,\" said Barret, in a tone of pity.\n\n\"And you have been in the mud, young man,\" said the fisher, in a tone of\ngood-humoured sarcasm.\n\nThe youth burst into a laugh at this, and the old fisherman's mouth\nexpanded into a broad grin, which betrayed the fact that age had failed\nto damage his teeth, though it had played some havoc with his legs.\n\n\"These are what I style Highland boots,\" said the old man, pointing to\nthe muddy legs.\n\n\"Indeed!\" returned Barret.  \"Well, you see I have put them on at once,\nfor I have only arrived a few hours since.  My name is Barret.  I\nbelieve I have the pleasure of addressing Mr MacRummle?\"\n\n\"You have that pleasure, Mr Barret; and now, if you will do me the\nkindness to carry my rod and basket, I will lead you back to the\ndog-cart by a path which will not necessitate an additional pair of\nnative boots!  I would not have hailed you, but having tumbled into the\nriver, as you see, I thought it would be more prudent to get driven home\nas quickly as possible.\"\n\n\"You have a good basket of fish, I see, or rather, feel,\" remarked\nBarret, as he followed the old man, who walked rather slowly, for his\nphysical strength was not equal to his spirits.\n\n\"Ay, it is not so bad; but I lost the best one.  Fishers always do, you\nknow!  He was a grilse, a six-pounder at the least, if he was an ounce,\nfor I had him within an inch of my gaff when I overbalanced myself, and\nshot into the stream head foremost with such force, that I verily\nbelieve I drove him to the very bottom of the pool.  Strange to say the\nrod was not broken; but when I scrambled ashore, I found that the grilse\nwas gone!\"\n\n\"How unfortunate!  You were not hurt, I hope?\"\n\n\"Not in the least.  There was plenty of depth for a dive; besides, I'm\nused to it.\"\n\nIt became quite evident to John Barret that his new friend was \"used to\"\na good many more things besides tumbling into the river, for as they\nwent slowly along the winding footpath that led them through the\npeat-hags, MacRummle tripped over a variety of stumps, roots, and other\nexcrescences which presented themselves in the track, and which on\nseveral occasions brought him to the ground.  The old gentleman,\nhowever, had a fine facility in falling.  Being slow in all his\nmovements, he usually subsided rather than fell; a result, perhaps, of\nlaziness as well as of unwillingness to struggle against fate.  His\nfrequent staggerings, also, on the verge of dark peat holes, caused his\ncompanion many a shock of alarm and many a start forward to prevent a\ncatastrophe, before they gained the high road.  They reached it at last,\nhowever, rather breathless, but safe.\n\nMacRummle's speech, like his movements, was slow.  His personal courage,\nconsidering the dangers he constantly and voluntarily encountered, was\ngreat.\n\n\"You've been in again, Mac, I see,\" exclaimed the laird heartily,\nextending his hand to his old friend with the view of hauling him up on\nthe seat beside him.  \"Mind the step.  Now then!\"\n\n\"Yes, I've been in, but the weather is warm!  Stop, stop!  Don't pull\nquite so hard, Allan; mind my rheumatic shoulder.  Give a shove behind,\nMr Barret--gently--there.  Thankee.\"\n\nThe old man sat down with something of a crash beside his friend.\nBarret handed him his rod, put the basket under his feet, and sprang up\non the seat behind.\n\nReturning at a swift pace by the road they had come, they soon reached\nKinlossie, where the laird drove into the back yard, so as to deliver\nthe still dripping MacRummle at the back door, and thus prevent his\nleaving a moist track from the front hall to his bedroom.  Having got\nrid of him, and given the dog-cart in charge to the groom, Mr Gordon\nled his young friend round to the front of the house.\n\n\"I see your friends have already arrived,\" said the laird, pointing to\nthe waggonette which stood in the yard.  \"No doubt we shall find them\nabout somewhere.\"\n\nThey turned the corner of the mansion as he spoke, and certainly did\ncome on Barret's friends, in circumstances, however, which seemed quite\nunaccountable at first sight, for there, in front of the open door, were\nnot only Bob Mabberly, Giles Jackman, Skipper McPherson, James McGregor,\nPat Quin, and Robin Tips, but also Mrs Gordon, the two boy Gordons--\nnamed respectively, Eddie and Junkie--Duncan, the butler, and little\nFlora, with a black wooden doll in her arms, all standing in more or\nless awkward attitudes, motionless and staring straight before them as\nif petrified with surprise or some kindred feeling.\n\nBarret looked at his host with a slight elevation of his eyebrows.\n\n\"Hush!\" said the laird, softly, holding up a finger of caution.  \"My boy\nArchie is behind that laurel bush.  He's photographing them!\"\n\n\"That'll do,\" in a loud voice from Archie, disenchanted the party; and\nwhile the operator rushed off to his \"dark closet,\" the laird hurried\nforward to be introduced to the new arrivals, and give them hospitable\ngreeting.\n\nThat evening the host and his wife entertained their guests to a genuine\nHighland feast in the trophied hall, and at a somewhat later hour\nDuncan, the butler, and Elsie, the cook, assisted by Roderick, the\ngroom, and Mary, the housemaid, held their share of high revelry in the\nkitchen, with Quin, Tips, and \"Shames\" McGregor.\n\n\"You have come to the right place for sport, gentlemen,\" said the laird,\nas he carved with vigour at a splendid haunch of venison.  \"In their\nseasons we have deer and grouse on the hills; rabbits, hares,\npartridges, and pheasants on the low grounds.  What'll you have, Mr\nMabberly?  My dear, what have you got there?\"\n\n\"Pigeon pie,\" answered Mrs Gordon.\n\n\"Mac, that will suit your taste, I know,\" cried the host with a laugh.\n\n\"Yes, it will,\" slowly returned MacRummle, whose ruddy face and smooth\nbald head seemed to glow with satisfaction now that he had got into dry\ngarments.  \"Yes, I'm almost as fond of pie as my old friend Robinson\nused to be.  He was so fond of it that, strange though it may seem to\nyou, gentlemen, he had a curious predilection for pie-bald horses.\"\n\n\"Come, now, Mac, don't begin upon your friend Robinson till after\ndinner.\"\n\n\"Has Archie's photography turned out well?\" asked Mabberly at this\npoint.  \"I do a little in that way myself, and am interested as to the\nresult of his efforts to-day.\"\n\n\"We cannot know that before to-morrow, I fear,\" replied Mrs Gordon.\n\n\"Did I hear you ask about Archie's work, Mabberly?\" said the laird,\ninterrupting.  \"Oh! it'll turn out well, I have no doubt.  He does\neverything well.  In fact, all the boys are smartish fellows; a little\nself-willed and noisy, perhaps, like all boys, but--\"\n\nA tremendous crash in the room above, which was the nursery, caused the\nlaird to drop his knife and fork and quickly leave the room, with a look\nof anxiety, for he was a tender-hearted, excitable man; while his quiet\nand delicate-looking wife sat still, with a look of serenity not\nunmingled with humour.\n\n\"Something overturned, I suppose,\" she remarked.\n\nIn a few minutes her husband returned with a bland smile.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, resuming his knife and fork; \"it was Junkie, as usual,\nfighting with Flo for the black doll.  No mischief would have followed,\nI daresay, but Archie and Eddie joined in the scrimmage, and between\nthem they managed to upset the table.  I found them wallowing in a sea\nof porridge and milk--that was all!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIVE.\n\nPLANS, PROSPECTS, AND A GREAT FIGHT.\n\nThere is something very enjoyable in awaking in a strange bedroom with a\nfeeling of physical strength and abounding health about one, with a\nglorious, early sunbeam irradiating the room--especially if it does not\nshine upon one's face--with a window opposite, through which you can see\na mountain rising through the morning mists, until its summit appears to\nclaim kindred with the skies, and with the consciousness that work is\nover for a time, and recreation is the order of the day.\n\nSome such thoughts and feelings caused John Barret to smile as he lay\nflat on his back, the morning after his arrival, with his hands under\nhis head, surveying the low-roofed but cosy apartment which had been\nallotted to him in the mansion of Kinlossie.  But the smile gave place\nto a grave, earnest expression as his eyes fell upon a framed card, on\nwhich was printed, in scarlet and blue and gold, \"The earth is the Lords\nand the fulness thereof.\"\n\n\"So it is,\" thought the youth; \"and my power to enjoy it comes from the\nLord--my health, my strength, myself.  Yet how seldom do I thank Him for\nthe mere fact of a happy existence.  God forgive me!\"\n\nAlthough Barret thus condemned himself, we would not have it supposed\nthat he had been a careless unbeliever.  His temperament was grave (not\nby any means gloomy) by nature, and a Christian mother's love and\nteaching had, before her early death, deepened his religious\nimpressions.\n\nHe was beginning to wonder whether it was Mrs Gordon who had hung the\ntext there, and whether it had been executed by Milly Moss, when the\n\"get up\" gong sent forth a sonorous peal, causing him to bound out of\nbed.  The act brought before his eyes another bed--a small one--in a\ncorner of the room reminding him of what he had forgotten, that, the\nhouse being full to overflow by the recent accession of visitors, little\nJoseph, better known as Junkie, shared the room with him.\n\nJunkie was at the moment sleeping soundly, after the manner of the\nhedgehog--that is, curled up in the form of a ball.  It was plain that\nneither dressing gongs nor breakfast-bells had any effect upon him, for\nhe lay still in motionless slumber.\n\n\"Hallo!  Junkie, did you hear the gong?\" said Barret, pushing the boy\ngently.\n\nBut Junkie answered not, and he had to push him three or four times\ngently, and twice roughly, before he could awaken the youngster.\nUncoiling himself and turning on the other side, Junkie heaved a deep\nsigh, and murmured,--\"Leave m' 'lone.\"\n\n\"Junkie!  Junkie! you'll be late for breakfast,\" shouted Barret in his\near.\n\n\"Don'--wan'--any--br'kf'st,\" murmured the boy.  \"Leave m' 'lone, I say--\nor'll wallop you!\"\n\nA laugh from Barret, and a still severer shake, roused the boy so far as\nto make him sit up and stare about him with almost supernatural\nsolemnity.  Then he yawned, rubbed his eyes, and smiled faintly.\n\n\"Oh! it's _you_, is it?\" he said.  \"I thought it was Eddie, and--\"\n\nAnother yawn checked his utterance.  Then he suddenly jumped up, and\nbegan to haul on his clothes with surprising rapidity.  It was evident\nthat Junkie had a will of his own, and was accustomed to exert it on all\noccasions.  He continued to dress, wash himself, brush his hair and his\nteeth, without speaking, and with such vigour that he soon distanced his\ncompanion in the race.  True, he did not do everything thoroughly.  He\ndid not render his little hands immaculately clean.  He did not remember\nthat the secret places behind his ears required to be particularly\nattended to, and, in brushing operations, he totally forgot that he was\npossessed of back-hair.  Indeed, it is just possible that he disbelieved\nthat fact, for he neglected it entirely, insomuch that when he had\ncompleted the operation to his own entire satisfaction, several stiff\nand independent locks pointed straight to the sky, and two or three to\nthe horizon.\n\n\"That's a pretty text on the wall, Junkie,\" observed Barret, while the\nyoungster was busy with the comb.\n\n\"Yes, it's pretty.\"\n\nBarret wished to draw the boy out, but, like a tough piece of\nindia-rubber, he refused to be drawn out.\n\n\"It is beautifully painted.  Who did it?\" asked the youth, making\nanother attempt.\n\nHe had accidentally touched the right chord this time.  It vibrated at\nonce.  Junkie looked up with sparkling eyes, and said that Milly did it.\n\n\"She does everything beautifully,\" he added, as he brushed away at his\nforelock--a remarkably obstinate forelock, considering that it was the\nmost highly favoured lock of his head.\n\n\"You like Milly, I see,\" said his friend.\n\n\"Of _course_ I do.  Everybody does.\"\n\n\"Indeed!  Why does everybody like her so much?\"\n\n\"'Cause she's so nice,\" said Junkie, dropping his brush on the floor--\nnot accidentally, but as the easiest way of getting rid of it.  \"And she\nsometimes says that I'm good.\"\n\n\"I'm glad to hear that, my boy, for if Milly says so it must be true.\"\n\n\"No, it's _not_ true,\" returned the boy promptly, as he fastened his\nnecktie in a complex knot, and thrust his arm through the wrong hole of\nhis little vest.  \"Milly is mistaken, that's all.  But I like her to say\nit, all the same.  It feels jolly.  But I'm bad--_awful_ bad!  Everybody\nsays so.  Father says so, an' he must be right, you know, for he says he\nknows everything.  Besides, I _feel_ it, an' I know it, an' I don't\ncare!\"\n\nHaving given vent to this reckless statement, and wriggled into his\njacket--the collar of which he left half down and half up--Junkie\nsuddenly plumped down on his knees, laid his head on his bed, and\nremained perfectly still for the space of about one quarter of a minute.\nThen, jumping up with the pleased expression of one who felt that he\nhad done his duty, he was about to rush from the room, when Barret\nstopped him.\n\n\"I'm glad to see that you say your prayers, at all events,\" he said.\n\n\"But I wouldn't say them if it wasn't for Milly,\" returned the urchin.\n\"I do it to please her.  An' I wash an' brush myself, an' all that, just\n'cause she likes me to do it.  I'd neither wash, nor pray, nor brush,\nnor anything, if it wasn't to please Milly--and mother,\" he added, after\na moment's reflection.  \"I like _them_, an' I don't care a button for\nanybody else.\"\n\n\"What! for nobody else at all?\"\n\n\"Well, yes, I forgot--I like Ivor, too.\"\n\n\"Is that the sick gamekeeper, Junkie?\"\n\n\"Sick! no; he's the drunken keeper.  Drunken Ivor, we call him--not to\nhis face, you know.  Wouldn't we catch it if we did that!  But I'm fond\nof drunken Ivor, an' he's fond of me.  He takes me out sometimes when he\ngoes to shoot rabbits and fish.  Sometimes he's awful fierce, but he's\nnever fierce to his old mother that lives in the hut close behind\nhis--'cept when he's drunk.  D'ee know\"--the boy lowered his voice at\nthis point and looked solemn--\"he very nearly killed his mother once,\nwhen he was drunk, you know, an' when he came sober he cried--oh, just\nas our Flo cries when she's bin whipped.\"\n\nAt this point the breakfast-bell pealed forth with, so to speak, a\nspecies of clamorous enthusiasm by no means unusual in Scottish country\nmansions, as if it knew that there was spread out a breakfast worth\nringing for.  At the first sound of it, Junkie burst from the room, left\nthe door wide open, clattered along the passage, singing, yelling\nvociferously as he went--and trundled downstairs like a retiring\nthunderstorm.\n\nThe arrangements for the day at Kinlossie were usually fixed at the\nbreakfast hour, if they had not been settled the night before.  There\nwas, therefore, a good deal to consult about during the progress of the\nmeal.\n\n\"You see, gentlemen,\" said the host, when the demands of nature were\npartially satisfied, \"friends who come to stay with me are expected to\nselect their occupations or amusements for the day as fancy or taste may\nlead them.  My house is `liberty hall.'  Sometimes we go together on the\nhills after grouse, at other times after red-deer.  When the rivers are\nin order, we take our rods and break up into parties.  When weather and\nwind are suitable, some go boating and sea-fishing.  Others go sketching\nor botanising.  If the weather should become wet, you will find a\nlibrary next to this room, a billiard-table in the west wing, and a\nsmoking-room--which is also a rod and gun-room--in the back premises.\nWe cannot take the men from their work to-day, so that a deer-drive is\nnot possible, but that can be done any day.  So, gentlemen, think over\nit, and make your choice.\"\n\n\"How is Milly this morning?\" asked MacRummle, who came down late to\nbreakfast, as he always did, and consequently missed morning prayers.\n\n\"Better, much better than we could have expected.  Of course the arm is\ninflamed and very painful, but not broken, which is almost a miracle,\nconsidering the height from which she fell.  But for you, Mr Barret,\nshe might have lain there for hours before we found her, and the\nconsequences might have been very serious.  As it is, the doctor says\nshe will probably be able to leave her room in a few days.\"\n\n\"Come, now, Mac,\" continued the host, \"we have been talking over plans\nfor the day.  What do you intend to do?\"\n\n\"Try the river,\" said the old gentleman, with quiet decision, as he\nslowly helped himself to the ham and egg that chanced to be in front of\nhim.  \"There's a three-pounder, if not a four, which rose in the middle\npool yesterday, and I feel sure of him to-day.\"\n\n\"Why, Mr MacRummle,\" said Mrs Gordon smilingly, \"you have seen that\nthree-pounder or four-pounder every day for a month past.\"\n\n\"I have, Mrs Gordon; and I hope to see him every day for a month to\ncome, if I don't catch him to-day!\"\n\n\"Whatever you do, Mac, don't dive for him,\" said the laird; \"else we\nwill some day have to fish yourself out of the middle pool.  Have\nanother cut of salmon, Mr Mabberly.  In what direction do your tastes\npoint?\"\n\n\"I feel inclined to make a lazy day of it and go out with your son\nArchie,\" said Mabberly, \"to look at the best views for photographing.  I\nhad intended to photograph a good deal among the Western Isles, this\nsummer; but my apparatus now lies, with the yacht, at the bottom of the\nsea.\"\n\n\"Yes, in company with my sixteen-shooter rifle,\" said Giles Jackman,\nwith a rueful countenance.\n\n\"Well, gentlemen, I cannot indeed offer you much comfort as regards your\nlosses, for the sea keeps a powerful hold of its possessions; but you\nwill find my boy's camera a fairly good one, and there are plenty of dry\nplates.  It so happens, also, that I have a new repeating rifle in the\nhouse, which has not yet been used; so, in the meantime, at all events,\nneither of you will suffer much from your misfortunes.\"\n\nIt was finally arranged, before breakfast was over, that MacRummle was\nto go off alone to his usual and favourite burn; that Jackman and Quin,\nunder the guidance of Junkie, should try the river for salmon and\nsea-trout; that Barret, with ex-Skipper McPherson, Shames McGregor,\nRobin Tips, Eddie Gordon, the laird's second son--a boy of twelve--and\nIvor, the keeper--whose recoveries were as rapid as his relapses were\nsudden--should all go off in the boat to try the sea-fishing; and that\nBob Mabberly, with Archie, should go photographing up one of the most\npicturesque of the glens, conducted by the laird himself.\n\nAs it stands to reason that we cannot accompany all of these parties, we\nelect to follow Giles Jackman, Quin, and Junkie up the river.\n\nThis expedition involved a preliminary walk of four miles, which they\nall preferred to being driven to the scene of action in a dog-cart.\n\nJunkie was a little fellow for his age, but remarkably intelligent,\nactive, bright and strong.  From remarks made by various members of the\nGordon family and their domestics, both Jackman and his servant had been\nled to the conclusion that the boy was the very impersonation of\nmischief, and were more or less on the look out for displays of his\npropensity; but Junkie walked demurely by their side, asking and\nreplying to questions with the sobriety of an elderly man, and without\nthe slightest indication of the latent internal fires, with which he was\ncredited.\n\nThe truth is, that Junkie possessed a nature that was tightly strung and\nvibrated like an Aeolian harp to the lightest breath of influence.  He\nresembled, somewhat, a pot of milk on a very hot fire, rather apt to\nboil over with a rush; nevertheless, he possessed the power to restrain\nhimself in a simmering condition for a considerable length of time.  The\nfact that he was fairly out for the day with two strangers, to whom he\nwas to show the pools where salmon and sea-trout lay, was a prospect so\ncharming that he was quite content to simmer.\n\n\"D'ee know how to fish for salmon?\" he asked, looking gravely up in\nJackman's face, after they had proceeded a considerable distance.\n\n\"Oh, yes, Junkie; I know how to do it.  I used to fish for salmon before\nI went to India.\"\n\n\"Isn't that the place where they shoot lions and tigers and--and\ng'rillas?\"\n\n\"Well, not exactly lions and gorillas, my boy; but there are plenty of\nbaboons and monkeys there, and lots of tigers.\"\n\n\"Have you shot them?\" asked Junkie, with a look of keen interest.\n\n\"Yes; many of them.\"\n\n\"Did you ever turn a tiger outside in?\"\n\nJackman replied, with a laugh, that he had never performed that curious\noperation on anything but socks--that, indeed, he had never heard of\nsuch a thing being done.\n\n\"I knew it was a cracker,\" said Junkie.\n\n\"What d'you mean by a cracker, my boy?\" inquired Jackman.\n\n\"A lie,\" said Junkie, promptly.\n\n\"And who told the cracker?\"\n\n\"Ivor.  He tells me a great, great many stories.\"\n\n\"D'you mean Ivor Donaldson, the keeper?\"\n\n\"Yes; he tells me plenty of stories, but some of them are crackers.  He\nsaid that once upon a time a man was walkin' through the jungle--that's\nwhat they call the bushes, you know, in India--an' he met a great big\ntiger, which glared at him with its great eyes, and gave a tremendous\nroar, and sprang upon him.  The man was brave and strong.  He held out\nhis right arm straight, so that when the tiger came upon him his arm\nwent into its open mouth and right down its throat, and his hand caught\nhold of something.  It was the inside end of the tiger's tail!  The man\ngave an _awful_ pull, and the tiger came inside out at once with a\n_tremendous_ crack!\"\n\n\"Sure, and that _was_ a cracker!\" remarked Quin, who had been listening\nto the boy's prattle with an amused expression, as they trudged along.\n\n\"Nevertheless, it may not be fair to call it a lie, Junkie,\" said\nJackman.  \"Did Ivor say it was true?\"\n\n\"No.  When I asked if it was, he only laughed, and said he had once read\nof the same thing being done to a walrus, but he didn't believe it.\"\n\n\"Just so, Junkie.  He meant you to understand the story of the tiger as\nhe did the story of the walrus--as a sort of fairy tale, you know.\"\n\n\"How could he mean that,\" demanded Junkie, \"when he said it was a\n_tiger's_ tail--not a _fairy's_ at all?\"\n\nJackman glanced at Quin, and suppressed a laugh.  Quin returned the\nglance, and expressed a smile.\n\n\"Better luck next time,\" murmured the servant.\n\n\"Did you ever see walruses?\" asked Junkie, whose active mind was prone\nto jump from one subject to another.\n\n\"No, never; but I have seen elephants, which are a great deal bigger\nthan walruses,\" returned Jackman; \"and I have shot them, too.  I will\ntell you some stories about them one of these days--not `crackers', but\ntrue ones.\"\n\n\"That'll be nice!  Now, we're close to the sea-pool; but the tide's too\nfar in to fish that just now, so we'll go up to the next one, if you\nlike.\"\n\n\"By all means, my boy.  You know the river, and we don't, so we put\nourselves entirely under your guidance and orders,\" replied Jackman.\n\nBy this time they had reached the river at the upper end of the loch.\nIt ran in a winding course through a level plain which extended to the\nbase of the encircling hills.  The pool next the sea being unfishable,\nas we have said, owing to the state of the tide, Junkie conducted his\ncompanions high up the stream by a footpath.  And a proud urchin he was,\nin his grey kilt and hose, with his glengarry cocked a little on one\nside of his curly head, as he strode before them with all the\nself-reliance of a Highland chieftain.\n\nIn a few minutes they came to the first practicable pool--a wide,\nrippling, oily, deep hole, caused by a bend in the stream, the\nappearance of which--suggestive of silvery scales--was well calculated\nto arouse sanguine hopes in a salmon fisher.\n\nHere Quin proceeded to put together the pieces of his master's rod,\nwhile Jackman, opening a portly fishing-book, selected a casting line\nand fly.\n\n\"Have you been in India, too?\" asked Junkie of Quin, as he watched their\nproceedings with keen interest.\n\n\"Sure, an' I have--leastways if it wasn't dhreamin' I've bin there.\"\n\n\"An' have _you_ killed lions, and tigers, and elephants?\"\n\n\"Well, not exactly, me boy, but it's meself as used to stand by an'\nhowld the spare guns whin the masther was killin' them.\"\n\n\"Wasn't you frightened?\"\n\n\"Niver a taste.  Och! thriflin' craters like them niver cost me a\nnight's rest, which is more than I can say of the rats in Kinlossie,\nanyhow.\"\n\nA little shriek of laughter burst from Junkie on hearing this.\n\n\"What are ye laughin' at, honey?\" asked Quin.\n\n\"At you not bein' able to sleep for the rats!\" returned the boy.  \"It's\nthe way with everybody who comes to stay with us, at first, but they get\nused to it at last.\"\n\n\"Are the rats then so numerous?\" asked Jackman.\n\n\"Swarmin', all over!  Haven't you heard them yet?\"\n\n\"Well, yes, I heard them scampering soon after I went to bed, but I\nthought it was kittens at play in the room overhead, and soon went to\nsleep.  But they don't come into the rooms, do they?\"\n\n\"Oh, no--I only wish they would!  Wouldn't we have a jolly hunt if they\ndid?  But they scuttle about the walls inside, and between the ceilings\nand the floors.  And you can't frighten them.  The only thing that\nscared them once was the bag-pipes.  An old piper came to the house one\nday and played a great deal, and we heard nothing more of the rats for\ntwo or three weeks after that.\"\n\n\"Sensible bastes,\" remarked Quin, handing the rod to his master; \"an' a\nsign, too, that they've got some notion o' music.\"\n\n\"Why, Quin, I thought you had bag-pipes in Ireland,\" said Jackman, as he\nfastened a large fly to his line.\n\n\"An' that's what we have, sor; but the Irish pipes are soft, mellow,\ngentle things--like the Irish girls--not like them big Scotch bellows\nthat screech for all the world like a thousand unwillin' pigs bein'\nforced to go to markit.\"\n\n\"True, Quin; there's something in that.  Now then, both of you stand\nclose to me--a little behind--so; it's the safest place if you don't\nwant to be hooked, and be ready with the gaff, Junkie,\" said the fisher,\nas he turned a critical eye on the water, and made a fine cast over what\nhe deemed the most likely part of the pool.\n\n\"Father never rose a fish there,\" said Junkie, with a demure look.\n\nThe fisher paid no attention to the remark, but continued to cast a\nlittle lower down stream each time.\n\n\"You're gettin' near the bit now,\" said Junkie, in the tone of one whose\nexpectations are awakened.\n\n\"Th-there!  That's him!\"\n\n\"Ay, and a good one, too,\" exclaimed Jackman, as a fan-like tail\ndisappeared with a heavy splash.  Again the fisher cast, with the same\nresult.\n\n\"He's only playin' wi' the fly,\" said Junkie in a tone of\ndisappointment.\n\n\"That's often the way--no!--th-there!  Got 'im!\"\n\nThe rod bent like a hoop at that moment; the reel spun round to its own\nmerry music, as the line flew out, and the fish finished its first wild\nrush with a leap of three feet into the air.\n\n\"Hooray!\" yelled Junkie, now fairly aflame, as he jumped like the fish,\nflourished the big hook round his head, and gaffed Quin by the lappet of\nhis coat!\n\n\"Have a care, you spalpeen,\" shouted the Irishman, grasping the excited\nyoungster by the collar and disengaging himself from the hook.  \"Sure it\nmight have been me nose as well as me coat, an' a purty objec' that\nwould have made me!\"\n\nJunkie heeded not.  When released he ran toward Jackman who was\nstruggling skilfully with the fish.\n\n\"Don't let him take you down the rapid,\" he shouted.  \"There's no good\nplace for landin' him there.  Hold on, an' bring 'im up if you can.\nHi!\"\n\nThis last exclamation was caused by another rush of the fish.  Jackman\nhad wound up his line as far as possible, and was in hopes of inducing\nthe salmon to ascend the stream, for he had run perilously near to the\nhead of the rapid against which the boy had just warned him.  But to\nthis the fish objected, and, finding that the fisher was obstinate, had,\nas we have said, made a sudden rush across the pool, causing the reel to\nspin furiously as the line ran out, and finishing off with another\nsplendid jump.\n\n\"A few more bursts like that will soon exhaust him,\" said Jackman, as he\nwound in the line again and drew the fish steadily towards him.\n\n\"Yes, but _don't_ let him go down,\" said the boy earnestly.\n\nIt seemed almost as if the creature had heard the warning, for it turned\nat the moment and made a straight rush for the head of the rapid.\n\nWhen a large salmon does this it is absolutely impossible to stop him.\nOnly two courses are open to the fisher--either to hold on and let him\nbreak the tackle; or follow him as fast as possible.  The former\nalternative, we need hardly say, is only adopted when following is\nimpracticable or involves serious danger.  In the present case it was\nneither impossible nor dangerous, but it was difficult; and the way in\nwhich Giles Jackman went after that fish, staggering among pebbles,\nleaping obstructions, crashing through bushes and bounding over\nboulders, causing Quin to hold his sides with laughter, and little\nJunkie to stand transfixed and staring with admiration, was\nindescribable.\n\nFor Junkie had only seen his old father in such circumstances, and\nsometimes the heavy, rather clumsy, though powerful Ivor Donaldson.  He\nhad not till that day seen--much less imagined--what were the capacities\nof an Indian \"Woods and Forester\" of athletic build, superb training,\nand fresh from his native jungles!\n\n\"I say! _what_ a jumper he is!\" exclaimed Junkie, recovering presence of\nmind and dashing after him.\n\nThe rapid was a short though rough one.  The chief danger was that the\nline might be cut among the foam-covered rocks, or that the hook, if not\nfirmly fixed, might tear itself away; also that the fisher might fall,\nwhich would probably be fatal to rod or line, to say nothing of elbows\nand shins.\n\nBut Jackman came triumphantly out of it all.  The salmon shot into the\npool below the rapid, and turned into the eddy to rest.  The fisher, at\nthe same moment, bounded on to a strip of sand there--minus only hat and\nwind--and proceeded to reel in the line for the next burst.\n\nBut another burst did not occur, for the fish was by that time pretty\nwell exhausted, and took to what is styled sulking; that is, lying at\nthe bottom of a hole with its nose, probably, under a stone.  While in\nthis position a fish may recover strength to renew the battle.  It is\ntherefore advisable, if possible, to drive him or haul him out of his\nrefuge by all or any means.  A small fish may be hauled out if the\ntackle be strong, but this method is not possible with a heavy one such\nas that which Jackman had hooked.\n\n\"What's to be done now, Junkie?\" he said, after one or two vain efforts\nto move the fish.\n\n\"Bomb stones at him,\" said the urchin, without a moment's hesitation.\n\n\"Bomb away then, my boy!\"\n\nJunkie at once sent several large stones whizzing into the pool.  The\nresult was that the salmon made another dash for life, but gave in\nalmost immediately, and came to the surface on its side.  The battle is\nusually about ended when this takes place, though not invariably so, for\nlively fish sometimes recover sufficiently to make a final effort.  In\nthis case, however, it was the close of the fight.  Slowly and carefully\nthe fisher drew the fish towards the shelving bank, where Junkie stood\nready with the gaff.  Another moment, and the boy bounded into the\nwater, stuck the hook into the salmon's shoulder, and laid it like a bar\nof glittering silver on the bank.\n\n\"A twenty-pounder,\" said Junkie, with critical gravity.\n\n\"Twinty an' three-quarters,\" said Quin, as he weighed it.\n\n\"And a good job, too,\" returned the practical urchin; \"for I heard\nmother say we'd have no fish for dinner to-morrow if somebody didn't\ncatch something.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX.\n\nDANGEROUS STUDIES, PECULIAR ART, AND SPLENDID FISHING.\n\nThere was a glass conservatory in one corner of the garden at Kinlossie\nHouse, to which the laird was wont to retire regularly for the enjoyment\nof a pipe every morning after breakfast.  In this retreat, which was\nrich in hot-house plants, he was frequently joined by one or more of the\nmembers of his family, and sometimes by the friends who chanced to be\nstaying with him.  Thither John Barret got into the way of going--partly\nfor the sake of a chat with the old man, of whom he soon became very\nfond, and partly for the sake of the plants, in which he was\nscientifically interested, botany being, as Mabberly said, his peculiar\nweakness.\n\nOne morning--and a gloriously bright morning it was, such as induces one\nto thank God for the gift of sunshine and the capacity of enjoying it--\nJohn Barret sauntered down to the garden, after breakfast, to have a\nquiet chat with his host.  He had decided to remain at home that morning\nfor the purpose of writing a letter or two, intending in the afternoon\nto follow up some of his companions, who had gone off to the hills.\n\nEntering the conservatory, he found that the laird was not there; but,\nin his usual rustic chair, there sat a beautiful girl, sound asleep,\nwith her fair cheek resting on her little hand, and her nut-brown hair\nstraggling luxuriantly over her shoulders.\n\nBarret was spell-bound.  He could not move for a few seconds.  Surprise\nmay have had something to do with the sudden paralysis of his powers.\nIt may have been curiosity, possibly admiration, certainly some sort of\nsensation that he could neither describe nor account for.  He knew at a\nglance who the girl was, though he had not seen her since the day of her\naccident.  Even if he had been so obtuse as not to know, the arm in a\nsling would have revealed that it was Milly Moss who slumbered there;\nyet he found it hard to believe that the neat little woman, with the\nlovely, benignant countenance before him was in very truth the\ndishevelled, dusty, scratched, and blood-sprinkled being whom he had\ncarried for several miles over the heather a short time before.\n\nAs we have said, Barret stood immovable, not knowing very well what to\ndo.  Then it occurred to him that it was scarcely gallant or fair thus\nto take advantage of a sleeping beauty.  Staring at her was bad enough,\nbut to awake her would be still worse; so he turned slowly about, as a\ncat turns when afraid of being pounced on by a glaring adversary.  He\nwould retire on tiptoe as softly as possible, so as not to disturb her.\nIn carrying out this considerate intention, he swept a flower-pot off\nits stand, which fell with a mighty crash upon the stone floor.\n\nThe poor youth clasped his hands, and glanced back over his shoulder in\nhorror.  The startled Milly was gazing at him with mingled surprise and\nalarm, which changed, however, into a flush and a look of restrained\nlaughter as she began to understand the situation.\n\n\"Never mind, Mr Barret,\" she said, rising, and coming forward with a\ngracious manner.  \"It is only one of the commonest plants we have.\nThere are plenty more of them.  You came, I suppose, in search of my\nuncle?  Excuse my left hand; the right, as you see, is not yet fit for\nduty.\"\n\n\"I did indeed come here in search of Mr Gordon,\" said Barret,\nrecovering himself; \"but permit me to lead you back to the chair; your\nstrength has not quite returned yet, I see.\"\n\nHe was right.  Although Milly had recovered much more rapidly than the\ndoctor had expected, she could not stand much excitement, and the shock\ngiven by the breaking flower-pot, coupled, perhaps, with the unexpected\nmeeting with the man who had rescued her, from what might well have\ncaused her death, somewhat overcame her.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" she said, with a fluttering sigh, as she sank down into the\nrustic chair, \"I do feel rather faint.  It does seem so strange!  I--I\nsuppose it is because I have had no experience of anything but robust\nhealth all my life till now.  There--I feel better.  Will you kindly\nfetch me a glass of water?  You will find a cistern with a tumbler\nbeside it outside.\"\n\nThe youth hurried out, and, on returning with the glass, found that the\ndeadly pallor of the girl's face had passed away, and was replaced by a\ntint that might have made the blush rose envious.\n\n\"You must understand,\" said Milly, setting down the glass, while Barret\nseated himself on a vacant flower-pot-stand beside her, \"that this\nconservatory is a favourite haunt of mine, to which, before my accident,\nI have resorted every morning since I came here, in order to sit with\nUncle Allan.  The doctor thought me so much better this morning that he\ngave me leave to recommence my visits.  This is why I came; but I had\ntotally forgotten that uncle had arranged to go out with the shooting\nparty to-day, so I sat down to enjoy my favourite plants, and paid them\nthe poor compliment of falling asleep, owing to weakness, I suppose.\nBut how does it happen, Mr Barret, that you have been left behind?\nThey gave me to understand that you are a keen sportsman.\"\n\n\"They misled you, then, for I am but a poor sportsman, and by no means\nenthusiastic.  Indeed, whether I go out with rod or gun, I usually\nconvert the expedition into a search for plants.\"\n\n\"Oh, then, you are fond of botany!\" exclaimed the girl, with a flush of\npleasure and awakened interest.  \"I am so glad of that, because--\nbecause--\"\n\n\"Well, why do you hesitate, Miss Moss?\" asked Barret, with a surprised\nlook and a smile.\n\n\"Well, I don't quite like to lay bare my selfishness; but the truth is,\nthere are some rare plants in terribly inaccessible places, which can\nonly be reached by creatures in male attire.  In fact, I was trying to\nsecure one of these on the Eagle Cliff when I fell, and was so nearly\nkilled at the time you rescued me.\"\n\n\"Pray don't give the little service I rendered so dignified a name as\n`rescue.'  But it rejoices me to know that I can be of further service\nto you--all the more that you are now so helpless; for if you found\nclimbing the precipices difficult before, you will find it impossible\nnow with your injured arm.  By the way, I was very glad to find that I\nhad been mistaken in thinking that your arm was broken.  Has it given\nyou much pain?\"\n\n\"Yes, a good deal; but I am very, very thankful it was no worse.  And\nnow I must show you some of the plants I have been trying to bring up\nsince I came here,\" said Milly, with animation.  \"Of course, I cannot\nwalk about to show them to you, so I will point them out, and ask you to\nfetch the pots--that is, if you have nothing better to do, and won't be\nbored.\"\n\nBarret protested earnestly that he had nothing--_could_ have nothing--\nbetter to do, and that even if he had he wouldn't do it.  As for being\nbored, the idea of such a state of mind being possible in the\ncircumstances was ridiculous.\n\nMilly was rejoiced.  Here she had unexpectedly found a friend to\nsympathise with her intelligently.  Her uncle, she was well aware,\nsympathised with her heartily, but not intelligently; for his knowledge\nof botany, he told her frankly, was inferior to that of a tom-cat, and\nhe was capable of little more in that line than to distinguish the\ndifference between a cabbage and a potato.\n\nAt it, therefore, the two young people went with real enthusiasm--we\nmight almost say with red-hot enthusiasm--for botany was only a\nsuperstructure, so to speak, love being the foundation of the whole\naffair.\n\nBut let not the reader jump to hasty conclusions.  Barret and Milly,\nbeing young and inexperienced, were absolutely ignorant at that time of\nthe true state of matters.  Both were earnest and straightforward--both\nwere ardently fond of botany, and neither, up to that period, had known\nwhat it was to fall in love.  What more natural, then, than that they\nshould attribute their condition to botany?  There is, indeed, a sense\nin which their idea was correct, for sympathy is one of the most\nprecious seeds with which poor humanity is entrusted, and did not botany\nenable these two to unite in planting that seed, and is not sympathy the\ngerm of full-blown love?  If so, may they not be said to have fallen in\nlove botanically?  We make no assertion in regard to this.  We merely,\nand modestly, put the question, leaving it to the intelligent reader to\nsupply the answer--an exceedingly convenient mode of procedure when one\nis not quite sure of the answer one's self.\n\nTo return.  Having got \"at it,\" Barret and Milly continued at it for\nseveral hours, during which period they either forgot, or did not care\nto remember, the flight of time.  They also contrived, during that time,\nto examine, discuss, and comment upon, a prodigious number of plants,\nall of which, being in pots or boxes, were conveyed by the youth to the\nempty stand at the side of the fair invalid.  The minute examination\nwith a magnifying glass of corolla, and stamen, and calyx, etcetera,\nrendered it necessary, of course, that these inquiries into the\nmysteries of Nature should bring the two heads pretty close together;\none consequence being that the seed-plant of sympathy was \"forced\" a\ngood deal, and developed somewhat after the fashion of those plants\nwhich Hindoo jugglers cause magically to sprout, blossom, and bloom\nbefore the very eyes of astonished beholders--with this difference,\nhowever, that whereas the development of the jugglers is deceptive as\nwell as quick, that of our botanists was genuine and natural, though\nrapid.\n\nThe clang of the luncheon gong was the first thing that brought them to\ntheir senses.\n\n\"Surely there must be some mistake!  Junkie must be playing with--no, it\nis indeed one o'clock,\" exclaimed Milly, consulting in unbelief a watch\nso small that it seemed like cruelty to expect it to go at all, much\nless to go correctly.\n\nAs she spoke, the door of the conservatory opened, and Mrs Gordon\nappeared with affected indignation on her usually mild countenance.\n\n\"You naughty child!\" she exclaimed, hurrying forward.  \"Did I not warn\nyou to stay no longer than an hour? and here you are, flushed, and no\ndoubt feverish, in consequence of staying the whole forenoon.  Take my\narm, and come away directly.\"\n\n\"I pray you, Mrs Gordon, to lay the blame on my shoulders,\" said\nBarret.  \"I fear it was my encouraging Miss Moss to talk of her\nfavourite study that induced her to remain.\"\n\n\"I would be only too glad to lay the blame on your shoulders if I could\nlay Milly's weakness there too,\" returned the lady.  \"It is quite\nevident that you would never do for a nurse.  Strong men like you have\nnot sympathy enough to put yourself in the place of invalids, and think\nhow they feel.  I would scold you severely, sir, if you were not my\nguest.  As it is, I will forgive you if you promise me not to mention\nthe subject of botany in the presence of my niece for a week to come.\"\n\n\"The condition is hard,\" said Barret, with a laugh; \"but I promise--that\nis, if Miss Moss does not force the subject on me.\"\n\n\"I promise that, Mr Barret; but I also attach a condition.\"\n\n\"Which is--?\"\n\n\"That you go to Eagle Cliff some day this week, and find for me a\nparticular plant for which I have sought for a long time in vain, but\nwhich I am told is to be found there.\"\n\n\"Most willingly.  Nothing could give me greater pleasure,\" returned the\nyouth, with an air of such eager enthusiasm that he felt constrained to\nadd,--\"you see, the acquisition of new and rare plants has been a sort\nof passion with me for many years, and I am quite delighted to find that\nthere is a possibility of not only gratifying it here, but of being able\nat the same time to contribute to your happiness.\"\n\nThey reached the house as he made this gallant speech, and Milly went\nstraight to her room.\n\nThe only members of the household who sat down to luncheon that day were\nMrs Gordon, Archie, the enthusiastic photographer, and Flo, with her\nblack doll; and the only guest, besides Barret, was McPherson, the\nskipper of the lost yacht.  The rest were all out rambling by mountain,\nloch, or stream.\n\n\"Milly won't appear again to-day,\" said the hostess, as she sat down.\n\"I knew that she had overdone it.  The shock to her system has been far\ntoo severe to admit of botanical discussions.\"\n\nBarret professed himself overwhelmed with a sense of guilt, and promised\nto avoid the dangerous subject in future.\n\n\"Mother,\" exclaimed Flo, who was a good but irrepressible child, \"what\nd'ee t'ink?  Archie have pofografft dolly, an' she's as like as--as--two\npeas.  Isn't she, Archie?\"\n\n\"Quite as like as that, Flo,\" replied Archie, with a laugh; \"liker, if\nanything.\"\n\n\"By the way, how did you get on with your photographing yesterday\nafternoon, Archie?\" asked Barret.\n\n\"Pretty well with some of the views; but I ruined the last one, because\nfather would have me introduce Captain McPherson and his man McGregor.\"\n\n\"Is that so, captain?\" asked Mrs Gordon.\n\n\"Oo, ay; it iss true enough,\" answered the skipper, with a grim smile.\n\"He made a queer like mess o' me, what-e-ver.\"\n\n\"How was it, Archie?\"\n\n\"Well, mother, this is how it was.  You know the waterfall at the head\nof Raven's Nook?  Well, I have long wanted to take that, so I went up\nwith father and Mr Mabberly.  We found the captain and McGregor sitting\nthere smoking their pipes, and when I was arranging the camera, the\ncaptain said to me--\"\n\n\"No, Maister Archie,\" interrupted the skipper; \"I did not say anything\nto Shames.  You should be more parteekler.  But Shames said something to\n_me_, what-e-ver.\"\n\n\"Just so; I forgot,\" continued Archie.  \"Well, McGregor said to the\ncaptain, `What would you think if we wass to sit still an' co into the\npictur'?'\"\n\n\"Oo, ay; that was just it, an' fery like him too,\" said the skipper,\nlaughing at Archie's imitation, though he failed to recognise the\nsimilarity to his own drawling and nasal tones.  People always do thus\nfail.  We can never see ourselves!\n\n\"Well,\" continued Archie, \"father insisted that I was to take them,\nthough they quite spoiled the view.  So I did; but in the very middle of\nthe operation, what did the captain do but insist on changing his--\"\n\n\"Not at all, Maister Archie,\" again interrupted the skipper; \"you have\nnot got the right of it.  It wass Shames said to me that he thought you\nhad feenished, an' so I got up; an' then you roared like a wild bullock\nto keep still, and so what could I do but keep still? an so--\"\n\n\"Exactly; that was it,\" cried Archie, interrupting in his turn; \"but you\nkept still _standing_, and so there were three figures in the picture\nwhen it was done, and your fist in the standing one came right in front\nof your own nose in the sitting one, for all the world as if you were\ngoing to knock yourself down.  Such a mess it was altogether!\"\n\n\"That iss fery true.  It wass a mess, what-e-ver!\"\n\n\"You must show me this curious photograph, Archie, after lunch,\" said\nBarret; \"it must be splendid.\"\n\n\"But it is not so splendid as my dolly,\" chimed in Flo.  \"I'll show you\nzat after lunch too.\"\n\nAccordingly, after the meal was over, Archie carried Barret off to his\nworkshop.  Then Flo took him to the nursery, where she not only showed\nhim the portrait of the nigger doll, which was a striking likeness--for\ndolls invariably sit well--but took special pains to indicate the\nvarious points which had \"come out\" so \"bootifully\"--such as the nails\nwhich Junkie had driven into its wooden head for the purpose of making\nit behave better; the chip that Junkie had taken off the end of its nose\nwhen he tried to convert that feature into a Roman; the deep line drawn\nround the head close to the hair by Junkie, when, as the chief of the\nMicmac Indians, he attempted to scalp it; and the hole through the right\neye, by which Junkie proposed to let a little more light into its black\nbrain.\n\nHaving seen and commented on all these things, Barret retired to the\nsmoking-room, not to smoke, but to consult a bundle of newspapers which\nthe post had brought to the house that day.\n\nFor it must not be imagined that the interests and amusements by which\nhe was surrounded had laid the ghost of the thin, little old lady whom\nhe had mur--at least run down--in London.  No; wherever he went, and\nwhatever he did, that old lady, like Nemesis, pursued him.  When he\nlooked down, she lay sprawling--a murdered, at least a manslaughtered,\nvictim--at his feet.  When he looked up, she hung, like the sword of\nDamocles, by a single fibre of maiden's hair over his head.\n\nIt was of no use that his friend Jackman rallied him on the point.\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" he would say, \"don't you see that if you had really\nkilled her, the thing would have been published far and wide all over\nthe kingdom, with a minute description, and perhaps a portrait of\nyourself on the bicycle, in all the illustrated papers?  Even if you had\nonly injured her severely, they would have made a sensation of it, with\nan offer, perhaps, of a hundred pounds for your capture, and a careful\nindication of the streets through which you passed when you ran away--\"\n\n\"Ay, that's what makes the matter so much worse,\" Barret would reply;\n\"the unutterable meanness of running away!\"\n\n\"But you repented of that immediately,\" Jackman would return in soothing\ntones; \"and you did your utmost to undo it, though the effort was\nfutile.\"\n\nBarret was usually comforted a good deal by the remarks of his friend,\nand indeed frequently forgot his trouble, especially when meditating on\nbotanical subjects with Milly.  Still, it remained a fact that he was\nhaunted by the little old lady, more or less, and had occasional bad\ndreams, besides becoming somewhat anxious every time he opened a\nnewspaper.\n\nWhile Barret and the skipper were thus taking what the latter called an\neasy day of it, their friend Mabberly, with Eddie and Junkie and the\nseaman McGregor, had gone over the pass in the waggonette to the village\nof Cove for a day's sea-fishing.  They were driven by Ivor Donaldson.\n\n\"You'll not have been in these parts before, sir?\" said Ivor, who was a\nquiet, polite, and sociable man when not under the influence of drink.\n\n\"No, never,\" answered Mabberly, who sat on the seat beside him; \"and if\nit had not been for our misfortune, or the carelessness of that unknown\nsteamer, I should probably never have known of the existence of your\nbeautiful island.  At least, I would have remained in ignorance of its\ngrandeur and beauty.\"\n\n\"That proves the truth of the south-country sayin', sir,--`It's an ill\nwind that blaws nae guid.'\"\n\n\"It does, indeed; for although the loss of my father's yacht is a very\nconsiderable one, to have missed the hospitality of the laird of\nKinlossie, and the rambling over your magnificent hills, would have been\na greater misfortune.\"\n\nThe keeper, who cherished a warm feeling for old Mr Gordon, and admired\nhim greatly, expressed decided approval of the young man's sentiments,\nas was obvious from the pleased smile on his usually grave countenance,\nthough his lips only gave utterance to the expression, \"Fery true, sir;\nyou are not far wrong.\"\n\nAt the Eagle Pass they halted a few minutes to breathe the horses.\nEddie and Junkie, of course, jumped down, followed by James McGregor,\nwith whom they had already formed a friendship.\n\n\"Come away, an' we'll show you the place where Milly fell down.  Come\nalong, quicker, Shames,\" cried Junkie, adopting the name that the\nskipper used; for the boy's love of pleasantry not infrequently betrayed\nhim into impudence.\n\nWith a short laugh, Mabberly turned to Ivor, and asked if Shames was the\nGaelic for James.\n\n\"No, sir\" replied the keeper; \"but James is the English for Shames.\"\n\n\"Ha! you are quoting now--or rather, misquoting--from the lips of some\nIrishman.\"\n\n\"Weel, sir, I never heard it said that quota-ashun wass a sin,\" retorted\nIvor; then, turning to the stupendous cliff that frowned above them,\n\"Hev ye heard of the prophecy, sir, aboot this cliff?\"\n\n\"No.  What is it?\"\n\n\"It's said that the cliff is to be the scene of a ghost story, a love\nstory, and a murder all at the same time.\"\n\n\"Is that all, Ivor?  Did the prophet give no indication how the stories\nwere to end, or who the murderer is to be, or the murdered one?\"\n\n\"Never a word, sir; only they wass all to be aboot the same time.\nIndeed, the prophet, whether man or wuman, is not known.  Noo, we better\nshump up.\"\n\nIn a few minutes the waggonette was rattling down the slopes that led to\nCove, and soon afterwards they were exchanging greetings with old Ian\nAnderson, the fisherman.\n\n\"Iss it to fush, ye'll be wantin'?\" asked Ian, as he ushered the party\ninto his cottage, where Mrs Anderson was baking oat-cakes, and Aggy was\nbusy knitting socks with her thin fingers as deftly and rapidly as if\nshe had been in robust health.\n\n\"Yes, that is our object to-day,\" said Mabberly.  \"Good-day, Mrs\nAnderson; good-day, Aggy.  I'm glad to see you looking so much better,\nthough I can't see very well for your cottage is none of the lightest,\"\nhe said, glancing at the small window, where a ragged head, with a\nflattened white nose, accounted for the obscurity.\n\n\"There might be _more_ light,\" said Ian, seizing a thick thorn stick,\nand making a sudden demonstration towards the door, the instant effect\nof which action was an improvement in the light.  It did not last long,\nhowever, for \"Tonal',\" after watching at the corner of the cottage long\nenough to make sure that the demonstration was a mere feint, returned to\nhis post of observation.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" remarked Mrs Anderson; \"Aggy is much better.  The fresh air\nis doin' her cood already, an' the peels that the shentleman--your\nfriend--gave her is workin' wonders.\"\n\n\"They usually do, of one sort or another,\" returned Mabberly, with a\npeculiar smile.  \"I'm glad they happen to be wonders of the right sort\nin Aggy's case.  My friend has been out in India, and his prescriptions\nhave been conceived in a warm climate, you see, which may account for\ntheir wonder-working qualities.  Can we have your boat to-day, Mr\nAnderson?\"\n\n\"Oo, ay; ye can hev that, sir,\" said Ian, summoning Donald to his\npresence with a motion of his finger.  \"Tonal',\" he said, when ragged\nhead stood at the open door, \"hev we ony pait?\"\n\n\"Ay, plenty.\"\n\n\"Co doon, then, an' git the poat ready.\"\n\nThe boy disappeared without reply--a willing messenger.  A few minutes\nmore, and Ivor and Ian were rowing the boat towards a part of the sea\nwhich was deemed good fishing ground, while the rest of the party busied\nthemselves arranging the lines.\n\nStrong brown lines they were, wound on little square wooden frames, each\nwith a heavy leaden sinker and a couple of strong coarse hooks of\nwhitened metal attached to the lines by stout whipcord; for the denizens\nof those western waters were not the poddlies, coddlings, and shrimps\nthat one is apt to associate with summer resorts by the sea.  They were\nthose veritable inhabitants of the deep that figure on the slabs of\nBillingsgate and similar markets--plaice and skate of the largest\ndimensions, congers that might suggest the great sea serpent, and even\nsharks of considerable size.\n\nThe surroundings were cognate.  Curlews and sandpipers whistled on the\nshore, complaining sea-mews sailed overhead, and the low-lying skerries\noutside were swarming with \"skarts\" and other frequenters of the wild\nnorth.\n\n\"Oh, _what_ a funny face!\" exclaimed Junkie, as a great seal rose head\nand shoulders out of the sea, not fifty yards off, to look at them.  Its\nobservations induced it to sink promptly.\n\n\"Let co the anchor, Tonal',\" said Ian; \"the pottom should be cood here.\"\n\n\"Hand me the pait, Junkie,\" said McGregor.\n\n\"Shie a bit this way,\" shouted Eddie.\n\n\"There--I've broke it!\" exclaimed Junkie, almost whimpering, as he held\nup the handle of his knife in one hand, and in the other a mussel with a\nbroken blade sticking in it.\n\n\"Never mind, Junkie.  You can have mine, and keep it,\" said Mabberly,\nhanding to the delighted boy a large buck-horn-handled knife, which\nbristled with appliances.\n\n\"An' don't try it on again,\" said Ian.  \"Here iss pait for you, my poy.\"\n\nA few minutes more, and the lines were down, and expectation was\nbreathlessly rampant.\n\n\"Hi!\" burst from Eddie, at the same moment that \"Ho!\" slipped from\nMcGregor; but both ceased to haul in on finding that the \"tugs\" were not\nrepeated.\n\n\"Hallo!\" yelled \"Tonal',\" who fished beside Junkie, on feeling a tug\nworthy of a whale; and, \"Hee! hee!\" burst from Junkie, whose mischievous\nhand had caused the tug when ragged head was not looking.\n\nIn the midst of these false alarms Ivor drew up his line, and no one was\naware of his success until a fish of full ten pounds' weight was\nfloundering in the boat.  The boys were yet commenting on it noisily,\nwhen Ian put a large cod beside it.\n\n\"_What_ a tug!\" cried Eddie, beginning to haul up in violent haste.\n\n\"Hev a care, or the line will pairt,\" said McGregor.\n\nAt the same moment \"Shames\" himself gave a jerk, as if he had received\nan electric shock, and in a few seconds a large plaice and a small crab\nwere added to the \"pile!\"\n\n\"I've got _something_ at last,\" said Mabberly, doing his best to repress\nexcitement as he hauled in his line deliberately.\n\nThe something turned out to be an eel about four feet long, which went\nabout the boat as if it were in its native element, and cost an amazing\namount of exertion, whacking, and shouting, to subdue.\n\nBut this was nothing to the fish with which Junkie began to struggle\nimmediately after, and which proved to be a real shark, five feet long.\nAfter the united efforts of Ian and Donald had drawn it to the surface,\nJunkie was allowed to strike the gaff into it, and a loud cheer greeted\nthe monster of the deep as it was hurled into the bottom of the boat.\n\nThus, in expectation, excitation, and animation, they spent the\nremainder of that memorable day.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\n\nAMAZING DEEDS AND MISDEEDS AT A DEER-DRIVE.\n\nTo some casts of mind there is no aspect of nature so enchanting or\nromantic as that which is presented, on a fine summer day from the\nvantage ground of a ridge or shoulder high up on the mountains of one of\nour western isles.\n\nIt may be that the union of the familiar and beautiful with the\nunfamiliar and wild is that which arouses our enthusiastic admiration.\nAs we stand in the calm genial atmosphere of a summer day, surveying the\nland and sea-scape from a commanding height that seems to have raised us\nabove the petty cares of life, the eye and mind pass like the\nlightning-flash from the contemplation of the purple heather and purple\nplants around--and from the home-feelings thereby engendered--to the\ngrand, apparently illimitable ocean, and the imagination is set free to\nrevel in the unfamiliar and romantic regions \"beyond seas.\"\n\nSome such thoughts were passing in the mind of Giles Jackman, as he\nstood alone, rifle in hand, on such a height one splendid forenoon, and\ncontemplated the magnificent panorama.\n\nFar down below--so far that the lowing of the red and black specks,\nwhich were cattle, and the bleating of the white specks, which were\nsheep, failed to reach him--a few tiny cottages could be seen, each in\nthe midst of a green patch that indicated cultivation.  Farther on, a\nsnow-white line told where the wavelets kissed the rugged shore, but no\nsound of the kiss reached the hunter's ear.  Beyond, as if floating on\nthe calm water, numerous rocky islets formed the playground of\ninnumerable gulls, skarts, seals, loons, and other inhabitants of the\nwild north; but only to the sense of vision were their varied activities\nperceptible.  Among these islets were a few blacker spots, which it\nrequired a steady look to enable one to recognise as the boats of\nfishermen; but beyond them no ship or sign of man was visible on the\ngreat lone sea, over, and reflected in which, hung a few soft and\ntowering masses of cloudland.\n\n  \"If thus thy meaner works are fair,\n  And beautiful beyond compare;\n  How glorious must the mansions be\n  Where Thy redeemed shall dwell with Thee!\"\n\nJackman murmured rather than spoke the words, for no human ear was there\nto hear.  Nevertheless there were human ears and tongues also, not far\ndistant, engaged in earnest debate.  It was on one of the ledges of the\nEagle Cliff that our hunter stood.  At another part of the same cliff,\nclose to the pass where Milly Moss met with her accident, Allan Gordon\nstood with nearly all his visitors and several of his retainers around\nhim.\n\n\"Higher up the pass you'll have a much better chance, Mr Barret.  Is it\nnot so, Ivor?\"\n\nThe keeper, who, in kilt, hose, and bonnet, was as fine a specimen of a\ntall athletic Highlander as one could wish to see, replied that that was\ntrue.\n\n\"Nae doot,\" he said, \"I hev put Mr Jackman in the best place of all,\nfor, whativer way the deer come, they'll hev to pass close, either above\nor below him--an' that's maybe as weel for him wi' his queer\nnew-fashioned rifle; but at the heed o' the pass is the next best place.\nThe only thing is that ye'll hev to tak' sure aim, for there's more\nroom for them to stray, an' ye may chance to git only a lang shot.\"\n\n\"Well, then, it is not the place for me, for I am a poor shot,\" said\nBarret; \"besides, I have a fancy to stay here, where I am.  You say it\nis a very good spot, Ivor, I understand?\"\n\n\"Weel, it's no' that bad as a spote,\" answered the keeper, with a grim\nsmile, for he had not much opinion of Barret's spirit as a sportsman;\n\"but it's ackward as the lawnd lies.\"\n\n\"Never mind.  I'll stay here, and you know, laird, that I have some\npleasant associations with it in connection with your niece.\"\n\n\"That is more than Milly has,\" returned the old gentleman, laughing.\n\"However, have your way.  Now, gentlemen, we must place ourselves\nquickly, for the beaters will soon be entering the wood.  I will take\nyou, Mr Mabberly, to a spot beyond the pass where you will be pretty\nsure of a shot.  And MacRummle--where shall we place him?\"\n\n\"He can do nothing wi' the gun at a', sir,\" muttered the keeper, in a\nlow voice, so that he might not be overheard.  \"I wad putt him doon at\nthe white rock.  He'll git a lang shot at them there.  Of course he'll\nmiss, but that'll do weel enough for him--for he's easy pleased; ony\nway, if he tak's shootin' as he tak's fishin', a mere sight o' the deer,\nlike the rise o' a salmon, 'll send him home happy.\"\n\n\"Very well, Ivor, arrange as you think best.  And how about Captain\nMcPherson and McGregor?\"\n\n\"I'll tak' care o' them mysel', sir.\"\n\n\"Ye need na' fash yer heed aboot us, laird,\" said the skipper.  \"Bein'\nmore used to the sea than the mountains, we will be content to look on.\nIss that not so, Shames?\"\n\n\"That iss so--what-e-ver,\" returned the seaman.\n\n\"Well, come along then; the beaters must be at work now.  How many did\nyou get, Ivor?\"\n\n\"I'm not exactly sure, sir,\" returned the keeper; \"there's Ian Anderson\nan' Tonal' from Cove, an' Mister Archie an' Eddie, an' Roderick--that's\nfive.  Oo, ay, I forgot, there's that queer English loon, Robin Tips--\nhe's no' o' much use, but he can mak' a noise--besides three o' Mr\nGrant's men.\"\n\n\"That's plenty--now then--\"\n\n\"Please, father,\" said Junkie, who had listened with open eyes and\nmouth, as well as ears, for this was his first deer-stalk, \"may I stop\nwith Mr Barret?\"\n\n\"Certainly, my boy, if Mr Barret does not object.\"\n\nOf course Mr Barret did not object, though he was rather surprised at\nthis mark of preference.\n\n\"I say, me boy,\" whispered Pat Quin, \"ask av I may stop wid ye.\"\n\nJunkie looked at the Irishman doubtfully for a moment, then said--\n\n\"Father, Quin says he wants to stop with me.\"\n\n\"You mayn't do that, Quin,\" returned the laird with a smile; \"but you\nmay go and stay with your master.  I heard him say that he would like\nyou to be with him to keep you out of mischief.\"\n\n\"Thankee, sor.  I was used to attend on 'im in the jungles to carry his\nspare guns, for it's ellyphints, no less, that we was used to bag out\nthere; but I make no question he can amuse himsilf wid deer an' things\nlike that where there's nothin' better.  He was always aisy to plaze,\nlike Mr MacRummle.\"\n\n\"Just so, Quin; and as MacRummle knows the hill, and has to pass the\nplace where Mr Jackman has been left, you had better follow him.\"\n\nThis arranged, the different parties took up their positions to await\nthe result of the beating of a strip of dwarf forest, several miles in\nextent, which clothed part of the mountain slopes below the Eagle Cliff.\n\nOn reaching the spot where Jackman was stationed, old MacRummle\nexplained to him the various arrangements that had just been made for\nthe comfort of all.\n\n\"I am sorry they gave me the best place,\" said Jackman.  \"I suppose it\nis because the laird thinks my experience in India entitles me to it;\nbut I would much rather that Mabberly or Barret had got the chance, for\nI'm used to this sort of thing, and, after bagging elephants, I can\nafford to lay on my oars and see my friends go in and win.\"\n\n\"An' sure, aren't thim the very words I said, sor?\" put in Quin.\n\n\"Have they given you a good place?\" asked Jackman of MacRummle, taking\nno notice of his man's remarks.\n\n\"They've given me the worst,\" said the old man, simply; \"and I cannot\nblame them, for, as the keeper truly remarked, I can do nothing with the\ngun,\"--still less with the rifle, he might have added!  \"At the same\ntime, I confess it would have added somewhat to the zest of the day if\nIvor had allowed me some degree of hope.  He thought I didn't overhear\nhim, but I did; for they give me credit for greater deafness than I\ndeserve.\"\n\nThere was something so pitiful, yet half amusing, in the way in which\nthis was said, that Jackman suddenly grasped the old gentleman's hand.\n\n\"Mr MacRummle,\" he said firmly, \"will you do me a favour?\"\n\n\"Certainly, with pleasure--if I can.\"\n\n\"You can--and you shall.  It is this: change places and rifles with me.\"\n\n\"My dear, kind sir, you don't know what you ask.  My rifle is an old\ndouble-barrel muzzle loader, and at the white rock you wouldn't have the\nghost of a chance.  I know the place well, having often passed it in\nfishing excursions up the burns.  Besides, I never used a repeating\nrifle in my life.  I couldn't manage it, even if I were to try.\"\n\n\"Mr MacRummle, are you not a Highlander?\"\n\n\"I believe I am!\" replied the old man, drawing himself up with a smile.\n\n\"And is not that equivalent to saying that you are a man of your word?\"\n\n\"Well--I suppose it is so--at least it should be so.\"\n\n\"But you will prove that it is not so, if you fail to do me a favour\nthat lies in your power, after promising to do it.  Come now, we have no\ntime to lose.  I will show you how to use the repeater.  See; it is\nempty just now.  All you have to do is to take aim as you would with any\nordinary rifle, and pull the trigger.  When the shot is off, you load\nagain by simply doing _this_ to the trigger-guard--so.  D'you\nunderstand?\"\n\n\"Yes, perfectly; but is that all? no putting in of cartridges anywhere?\"\n\n\"No, nothing more.  Simply do _that_ (open--and the cartridge flies\nout), and _that_ (shut--and you are loaded and ready to fire)!  Now, try\nit.  That's it!  Capital!  Couldn't be better.  Why, you were born to be\na sportsman!\"\n\n\"Yes, with fish,\" remarked the gratified old man, as he went through the\nmotions of loading and firing to perfection.\n\n\"Now, then, I will load it thus.  Watch me.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he filled the chamber under the barrel with cartridge after\ncartridge to the amazement of MacRummle and the amusement of Quin, who\nlooked on.\n\n\"How many shots will it fire without reloading?\" asked the old man at\nlength.\n\n\"Sixteen,\" replied Jackman.\n\n\"What! sixteen?  But--but how will I ever know how many I've let off?\"\n\n\"You don't require to know.  Just blaze away till it refuses to fire!\nNow, I must be off.  Where is this white rock that I have to go to?\"\n\n\"There it is--look.  A good bit down the hill, on the open ground near\nthe forest.  If you have good eyes, you can see it from here.  Look,\njust behind the ridge.  D'you see?\"\n\n\"I see.  Great luck to you.  Do good work, and teach that rascal Ivor to\nrespect your powers with the rifle.  Come along, Quin.\"\n\n\"But really, my young friend, it is too good, too self-denying of you\nto--\"\n\nHe stopped, for Jackman and Quin were already striding down the mountain\non their way to the white rock.\n\nMacRummle had been somewhat excited by the enthusiasm of his young\nfriend and the novelty of his situation.  To say truth, he would much\nrather have been pottering along the banks of one of his loved Highland\nstreams, rod in hand, than crouching in the best pass of the Eagle Cliff\nin expectation of red-deer; but being an amiable and sympathetic man, he\nhad been fired by the enthusiasm of the household that morning, and,\nseeing that all were going to the drive, including the laird, he made up\nhis mind to brace himself up to the effort, and float with the current.\nHis enthusiasm had not cooled when he reached the Eagle Cliff, and\nJackman's kindness, coupled with hope and the repeating rifle, increased\nit even to white heat.  In which condition he sat down on a rock,\nremoved his hat, and wiped his bald, perspiring head, while a benignant\nsmile illuminated his glowing features.\n\nAbout the same time, Barret and Junkie having selected a convenient mass\nof rock as their outlook, so that they could command the pass for some\ndistance in both directions without exposing themselves to view, rested\nthe rifle against the cliff and began to talk.  Soon the young man\ndiscovered that the little boy, like many other mischievous boys, was of\nan exceedingly inquiring disposition.  Among other things, he not only\nbegan an intelligent inquiry about the locks of a rifle, but a practical\ninquiry with his fingers, which called for remonstrance.\n\n\"Do you know, Junkie, that this is the very spot where your Cousin Milly\nfell?\" said Barret, by way of directing the urchin's thoughts into a\nsafer channel.\n\n\"Is it?  Oh, dear, _what_ a thump she must have come down!\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, a dreadful thump--poor thing.  She was trying to get\nflowers at the time.  Do you know that she is exceedingly fond of\nflowers?\"\n\n\"Oh, don't I?  She's got books full of them--all pasted in with names\nprinted under them.  I often wonder what she sees in flowers to be so\nfond of them.  I don't care a button for them myself, unless they smell\nnice.  But I often scramble after them for her.\"\n\n\"There is a good deal to like in flowers besides the smell,\" said\nBarret, assuming an instructive tone, which Junkie resented on the spot.\n\n\"Oh, yes, I don't want to know; you needn't try to teach me,\" he said,\nfirmly.\n\n\"Of course not.  I wouldn't think of teaching you, my boy.  You know I'm\nnot a schoolmaster.  I'm not clever enough for that, and when I was your\nage, I hated to be taught.  But I could _show_ you some things about\nflowers and plants that would astonish you.  Only it would not be safe\nto do it just now, for the deer might come up and--\"\n\n\"No they won't,\" interrupted the boy; \"it's a monstrous big wood they've\ngot to pass through before they can come here, so we have time to look\nat some of the 'stonishin' things.\"\n\n\"Well, then, come.  We will just go a little way up the cliff.\"\n\nLeading Junkie away among the masses of fallen rock, which strewed that\nledge of the cliff, the wily youth began to examine plants and flowers\nminutely, and to gradually arouse in the boy's mind an interest in such\nparts of botanical science as he was capable of understanding.\n\nMeanwhile the small army of beaters had extended themselves across the\ndistant end of the forest, which, being some miles off, and on the other\nside of a great shoulder of the mountain, was not only out of sight, but\nout of hearing of the stalkers who watched the passes of the Eagle\nCliff.\n\nAll the beaters, or drivers, were well acquainted with the work they had\nto do, with the exception of Robin Tips, to whom, of course, it was\nquite new.  But Ian Anderson put him under Donald's care, with strict\ninjunctions to look well after him.\n\n\"Now, Tonal', see that ye don't draw together an' git ta-alkin' so as to\nforget what ye're about.  Keep him at the right distance away from ye,\nan' as much in line as ye can.\"\n\n\"Oo, ay,\" returned ragged head, in a tone that meant, when translated\ninto familiar English, \"Don't teach your grandmother to suck eggs!\"\n\nIn a sequestered dell on the slope of the hills, a lordly stag and\nseveral hinds were enjoying themselves that morning among the bracken\nand bright mosses, partially screened from the sun by the over-arching\nboughs of birch and hazel, and solaced by the tinkling music of a\nneighbouring rill.  Thick underwood concealed the dell on all sides;\ngrey lichen-covered boulders surrounded it; no sound disturbed it save\nthe faint cry of the plover and curlew on the distant shore, or the flap\nof a hawk's wing as it soared overhead.  Altogether it looked like a\nsafe and sure retreat, but it did not prove to be so.\n\nMingled with the plaintive cries of the wild fowl, there came a faint--\nbarely perceptible--sound of the human voice.  The stag pricked up his\nears, and raised his antlered head.  It was by no means a new sound to\nhim.  The shepherd's voice calling to his collie on the mountain-side\nwas a familiar sound, that experience had taught him boded no evil.  The\nconverse of friends as they plodded along the roads or foot-paths that\noften skirted his lairs, had a tone of innocence about it which only\ninduced caution--not alarm.  But there was nothing of this in the sounds\nthat now met his ears.  He raised himself higher, opened his nostrils\nwider, sniffed the tainted air, and then, turning his graceful head,\nmade some remark--we presume, though we cannot be positive on this\npoint--to his wives.\n\nThese, meek and gentle--as females usually are, or ought to be--turned\ntheir soft inquiring gaze on their lord.  Thus they stood, as if\nspell-bound, while the sounds slowly but steadily increased in volume\nand approached their retreat.  Presently a shoulder of the mountain was\nturned by the drivers, and their discordant voices came down on the\ngentle breeze with unmistakable significance.\n\nWe regret being unable to report exactly what the stag then said to his\nwives, but the result was that the entire family bounded from their\nretreat, and, in the hurry and alarm of the moment, scattered along\nvarious glades, all of which, however, trended ultimately towards those\nmountain fastnesses that exist about and beyond the Eagle Cliff.\n\nTwo of the hinds followed their lord in a direction which led them out\nof the wood within sight of, though a considerable distance from, the\nwhite rock behind which Jackman and Quin were concealed.  The others\nfled by tracks somewhat higher on the hill-sides, where however, as the\nreader knows, the enemy was posted to intercept them.\n\n\"Sure it's a purty stag, afther all,\" whispered Quin, who, in spite of\nelephantine-Indian sport, was somewhat excited by this sudden appearance\nof the Scottish red-deer.  \"But they're a long way off, sor.\"\n\n\"Not too far, if the rifle is true,\" said Jackman, in a very low voice,\nas he put up the long-range sight.\n\n\"You'll git a good chance at the stag whin he tops the hillock forenent\nyou, sor,\" remarked the somewhat garrulous Irishman.\n\n\"I won't fire at the stag, Quin,\" returned Jackman, quietly.  \"You and I\nhave surely killed enough of bigger game abroad.  We can afford to let\nthe stag pass on to our friends higher up, some of whom have never seen\na red-deer before, and may never have a chance of seeing one again.\"\n\nAll this was said by the sportsman in a low, soft voice, which could not\nhave been heard three yards off, yet his sharp eye was fixed intently on\nthe passing deer.  Seeing that there was no likelihood of their coming\nnearer, he raised his rifle, took steady but quick aim, and fired.  One\nof the hinds dropped at once; the other followed her terrified lord as\nhe dashed wildly up the slope.\n\nPartial deafness is a slight disadvantage in deer-stalking.  So, at\nleast, MacRummle discovered that day.  After having wiped his forehead,\nas already described, he set himself steadily to fulfil the duties of\nhis situation.  These were not so simple as one might suppose, for, as\nhad been explained to him by Jackman, he had to watch two passes--one\nclose above his post, the other close below it--either of which might\nbring the deer within easy reach of his rifle, but of course there was\nthe uncertainty as to which of the two passes the deer would choose.  As\nit was a physical impossibility to have his eyes on both passes at once,\nthe old gentleman soon found that turning his head every few seconds\nfrom one side to the other became irksome.  Then it became painful.  At\nlast it became torture, and then he gave up this plan in despair,\nresolving to devote a minute at a time to each pass, although feeling\nthat by so doing his chances were greatly diminished.\n\nWhen Jackman fired his shot, MacRummle's ears refused to convey the\ninformation to his brain.  He still sat there, turning his head slowly\nto and fro, and feeling rather sleepy.  One of the scattered deer, which\nhad gone higher up the mountain, passed him by the upper track.\nMacRummle was gazing at the lower track just then!  Having given the\nallotted time to it, he turned languidly and beheld the hind, trotting\nrather slowly, for it was somewhat winded.\n\nThe sight sent sportsman-fire through the old gentleman's entire frame.\nHe sprang, he almost tumbled up, but before he could fire, a jealous\nboulder intervened.  Rushing up a few yards, he was just in time to see\nthe animal bound over a cliff and disappear.\n\nDepressed beyond measure, he returned to his post and resumed the rapid\nhead-motion which he had foolishly discontinued.  This was fortunate,\nfor it enabled him to see in time the stag and hind which Jackman had\nsent bounding towards him.  Another moment, and the affrighted creatures\nwere within range.  MacRummle sprang up, put the repeater to his\nshoulder, and then commenced a fusillade that baffles description.\nBang, bang, bang, went the repeater; bang, bang, double-bang, and\nbanging everywhere went the startled echoes of the mountain.  Never\nsince it sprang from the volcanic forces of nature had the Eagle Cliff\nsent forth such a spout of rattling reverberation.  The old man took no\naim whatever.  He merely went through the operations of load and fire\nwith amazing rapidity.  Each crack delivered into the arms of echo was\nmultiplied a hundredfold.  Showers of bullets seemed to hail around the\nastounded quarry.  Smoke, as of a battle, enshrouded the sportsman.  The\nrifle became almost too hot to hold, and when at last it ceased to\nrespond to the drain upon its bankrupt magazine, the stag and hind lay\ndead upon the track, and MacRummle lay exhausted with excitement and\nexertion upon the heather!\n\nThis unwonted fusillade took the various parties higher up the hill by\nsurprise.  To Ivor, indeed, it was quite a new experience, and he\nregarded it with a smile of grim contempt.\n\n\"There iss noise enough--what-e-ver!\" remarked Skipper McPherson, who\nsat beside the keeper with a double-barrelled gun charged with buckshot,\nwhich he had in readiness.\n\n\"Look! look!\" exclaimed Ivor, pointing to another part of the pass,\n\"your friend McGregor has got a fright!\"\n\n\"Ay, that's true.  Shames would be troubled in his mind, I think.\"\n\nThere was indeed some reason to suppose so.  The worthy seaman, having\ngot tired of waiting, had, against Ivor's advice, wandered a few yards\nalong the pass, where, seeing something farther on that aroused his\ncuriosity, he laid down the single-barrelled fowling-piece with which he\nhad been provided, and began to clamber.  Just as the repeater opened\nfire, two hinds, which had got ahead of the others, ran through the pass\nby different tracks.  One of these McGregor saw before it came up, and\nhe rushed wildly back for his gun.  It was this act that his comrades\nrightly attributed to mental perturbation.\n\n\"Look out!\" whispered the keeper.\n\nAs he spoke the other hind, doubling round a mass of fallen rock, almost\nleaped into McGregor's arms.  It darted aside, and the seaman, uttering\na wild shout, half raised his gun and fired.  The butt hit him on the\nchest and knocked him down, while the shot went whizzing in all\ndirections round his comrades, cutting their garments, but fortunately\ndoing them no serious injury.\n\n\"Oh, Shames! ye was always in too great a hurry,\" remonstrated the\nskipper, oblivious of the fact that he himself had been too slow.\n\n\"Quick, man, fire!\" cried Ivor, testily.\n\nThe captain tried to energise.  In doing so he let off one barrel at the\ncelestial orbs unintentionally.  The other might as well have gone the\nsame way, for all the execution it did.\n\nWhen he looked at the keeper, half apologetically, he saw that he was\nquietly examining his leg, which had been penetrated by a pellet.\n\n\"Eh! man, are 'ee shot?\" cried the captain, anxiously.\n\n\"Oo, ay, but I'm none the worse o' it!  I had a presentiment o'\nsomethin' o' this sort, an' loaded his gun wi' small shot,\" replied the\nkeeper.\n\nProfound were the expressions of apology from McGregor, on learning what\nhe had done, and patronisingly cool were the assurances of Ivor that the\ninjury was a mere flea-bite.  And intense was the astonishment when it\nwas discovered that a stag and a hind had fallen to old MacRummle with\nthat \"treemendious\" repeater!  And great was the laughter afterwards, at\nlunch time on the field of battle, when Junkie gravely related that\nBarret was upon a precipice, trying to reach a rare plant, when the deer\npassed, so that he did not get a shot at all!  And confused was the\nexpression of Barret's face when he admitted the fact, though he\ncarefully avoided stating that his mind was taken up at the time with a\nvery different kind of dear!\n\nIt was afternoon when the assembled party, including drivers, sat down\nto luncheon on the hill-side, and began to allay the cravings of\nappetite, and at the same time to recount or discuss in more or less\nenergetic tones, the varied experiences of the morning.  Gradually the\nvictuals were consumed, and the experiences pretty well thrashed out,\nincluding those of poor Mabberly, who had failed to get even a chance of\na shot.\n\n\"An' sure it's no wonder at all,\" was Pat Quin's remark; \"for the noise\nwas almost as bad as that night when you an' me, sor, was out after the\nelephants in that great hunt in the North-western provinces of Indy.\"\n\n\"Oh, _do_ tell us about that,\" cried Junkie and his brothers, turning\neagerly to Jackman.\n\n\"So I will, my boys; but not now.  It will take too long.  Some other\ntime, in the house, perhaps, when a bad day comes.\"\n\n\"No, now, _now_!\" cried Junkie.\n\nSeeing that most of those present had lighted their pipes, and that the\nlaird seemed to wish it, Jackman washed down his lunch with a glass of\nsparkling water, cleared his throat, and began.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\n\nJACKMAN'S WONDERFUL ELEPHANT STORY.\n\n\"Once upon a time,\" said Jackman, glancing at Junkie and Robin Tips, who\nsat before him open-mouthed and open-eyed, as if ready to swallow\nanything...\n\n\"Yes,\" murmured Junkie, nodding, \"that's the right way to begin.\"\n\n\"But you must not interrupt, Junkie.\"\n\n\"No, I won't do it again; but first, tell me, is it true?\"\n\n\"Yes, my boy; it is absolutely true in all its main points,\" replied\nJackman.\n\n\"Well, as I said, once upon a time, not very long ago, I was sent up to\nthe North-west provinces of India, to a place near the base of the\nHimalaya mountain-range.  The country was swarming with elephants at\nthat time.  You see, previous to that, the elephants had been hunted and\nkilled to such an extent that the Government had been obliged to pass an\nElephant Preservation Act for their protection, and the Act worked so\nwell that the elephants multiplied very fast.  They roamed at will\nthrough the forests, and frequently, leaving these, made raids upon the\ncultivated lands, to the great damage of property and danger of human\nlife from the `rogues,' as old, solitary elephants which have been\ndriven from the herds, are called.  These `rogues' are extremely\nill-natured and dangerous, so it was found necessary to take steps to\nkill some of them, and thin the herds by capturing some of the females,\nwhich might be tamed and made useful.\n\n\"For this purpose of hunting and catching elephants a hunt upon a truly\nmagnificent scale was instituted.  Now, as it is very difficult to kill\nsuch huge creatures, and still more difficult to catch them, men are\nobliged to call to their aid tame elephants, which are trained for the\npurpose of what is called Khedda hunting.  But I don't mean to tell you\neither about the killing or catching just now.  I shall rather relate an\nextraordinary and thrilling incident that occurred before the hunt had\nproperly begun.\n\n\"Great men from all parts of the country assembled at this hunt, some of\nthem bringing troops of tame elephants and followers with them.  There\nwere governors and rajahs, and private secretaries, with some of their\nwives, military officers, forest officers, commissioners, collectors,\nsuperintendents, magistrates, surgeons, medical officers, and even\nclergymen, besides a host of smaller fry and servants.  It was a regular\narmy!  The Maharajah of Bulrampore sent sixty-five catching elephants,\nand five koonkies or fighting elephants, among which was a famous\nwarrior named Chand Moorut.  Along with these came a body of men trained\nto that special work.  A good contingent also came from Rampore.  The\nRajah of Khyrigarh came in person with thirteen elephants and a noted\nfighting animal, named Berchir Bahadur; other elephants were collected\nfrom the rajahs and native gentlemen around.  Among the koonkies, or\ngladiators, were two tremendous fellows, both as to colossal size and\ncourage, named respectively Raj Mungul and Isri Pershad.\n\n\"But far before them all in towering height and stupendous weight and\nunconquerable courage, as well as warlike tendency, was the mighty Chand\nMoorut, whom I first mentioned.  This grand, slow-moving, sedate hero of\na hundred fights, was a sort of elephantine bull-dog; a concentrated\nearthquake; an animal thunder-bolt; a suppressed volcano.  Nothing in\nthe forests had yet been found which could stand before his onset.  And\nwhen we saw him stalk solemnly into camp with his mahowt, or guide,\nlooking like a small monkey on his great neck, and remembered his fame\nas a fighter and his eager thirst at all times for battle, we felt that\nthe keystone had been put to the arch of our arrangements.\n\n\"This great mixed multitude was put under the direction of a Conservator\nof Forests, a man celebrated for his exploits and daring adventures in\nthe field, and it was as a friend of his that I joined the hunt with my\nman, Pat Quin there.\"\n\n\"Troth, sor, an' av it wasn't for Chand Moorut (blissin's on his great\nsowl, av he has wan, an' on his body av he hasn't) your man Pat Quin\nwould have been left there as flat as a pancake.  Excuse me, sor, for\nspakin', but me feelin's overcomed me.\"\n\n\"No doubt, Quin, you had a narrow escape; I'll come to that soon.  Well,\nthe spot at last chosen for pitching the camp was a splendid one, facing\nnorthward, where we had an extensive view of the great forests that\nstretched to the base of the irregular and rugged Sawalick hills.\nBehind these rose the mighty Himalayas themselves, their grand peaks\nseeming to push up into the very heavens, where the sun shone with\ndazzling brilliancy on their everlasting snows.  The camp covered an\nimmense piece of ground, which was partly open and partly dotted with\nclumps of trees.  It was so large that the tents, etcetera, were\narranged in streets, and our Director pitched his tent in the very\ncentre of it, with all the tame elephants and their attendants around\nhim.\n\n\"You may easily fancy that it was a noisy camp, with so many hundreds of\nmen and animals around, full of excitement, more or less, about the\ncoming fight; for we had a number of men, called trackers, out in the\nwoods, who had brought in news that a herd of wild elephants had just\nbeen discovered in the Saharanpur and Dun forests, on the banks of the\nGanges.\n\n\"The glens in these forests were known to be well suited for hunting\npurposes, so our hopes and expectations were raised to a high pitch.\nTowards evening we had got pretty well settled down, when a rumour got\nabout the camp that one of the Khedda elephants had killed a man, and\nthat it was highly probable he would run _amuck_ to the great danger of\nevery one.  It happened thus:--\n\n\"A big tusker, named Mowla Buksh, was being taken by his mahowt to drink\nand bathe, according to custom, when it was observed that the elephant\nseemed to be out of temper.  Just then one of the fodder-cutters chanced\nto pass by.\n\n\"`Keep out of his way,' cried the mahowt, in a warning tone.  `There's\nsomething wrong with him to-day.  I won't bathe him, I think.'\n\n\"`Oh! he knows me well, and won't harm me,' returned the cutter.\n\n\"The words were scarcely out of the man's mouth, when the brute rushed\nat him, knocked him down, gored him with his tusks, and kicked him after\nthe fashion of enraged elephants.  Of course the poor man was instantly\nkilled.  When this deed was done, Mowlah Buksh seemed to feel that,\nhaving lost his character, he might as well go on in his course of\nmischief.  He became wild with fury, and kept throwing his head back in\na vain endeavour to seize his mahowt with his trunk and kill him also.\nIn this effort he failed.  The mahowt, though old, was active and\nstrong.  He managed to hold on and sit so far back on the elephant's\nhind quarters as to be just out of reach.  Luckily the brute did not\nthink of shaking him off.\n\n\"Had he attempted that, he would soon have succeeded.  The poor man\nwould have fallen to the ground and been killed.  Finding that he could\nnot accomplish his purpose, the infuriated animal rushed towards the\ncamp, where the khedda or hunting elephants were, and where, as I have\nsaid, our Director had pitched his tent.  My own tent was close beside\nhis.\n\n\"The first I heard of what was going on was from Quin, who came running\ninto my tent, where I was sitting quietly at the time, cleaning my\nrifle.  Quin's eyes were starting out of his head, and there was, I\nassure you, nothing of the pleasant smile that rests on his face at this\nmoment!\n\n\"`Och, sor!' gasped Quin, `Bowla Muk--no--Mowla Buksh--has gone mad\nentoirely!'\n\n\"I jumped up quickly, you may believe, for I didn't often see _that_\nlook on Quin's face, and when I did, I knew well that something very\nserious was in the wind.\n\n\"`Where away is he?'  I asked.\n\n\"`Sorrow wan o' me knows, sor,' said Quin.\n\n\"Rushing out with no very fixed purpose in view, I soon found that the\nshouting in the camp was a sufficient guide to the spot where the\nmischief was going on.  In a few minutes I came on a cordon of\nmusketeers who had been hastily drawn up, so as to prevent Mowla Buksh\nfrom getting at the other elephants, for if he had succeeded in doing\nso, he would certainly have gone knocking about the smaller ones,\nperhaps maiming them, and killing every man who might chance to come in\nhis path.  On the other hand, if the musketeers managed to turn him,\nthere was the danger of his making for the main camp, and killing every\none he could lay hold of in that direction.\n\n\"Of course the thought of turning out the big fighting elephants to\nmaster him occurred to every one; but even here there would be risk, for\nthese gladiators would not rest content without knocking Mowla Buksh off\nhis legs, in which case the mahowt would assuredly be killed.  Besides,\nour Director chanced to be in the forest at the time, and no one else\nseemed ready to take the responsibility of ordering them out.\n\n\"When I came up to the musketeers, I saw the elephant rushing wildly\nabout, trying to find a way through them, with the old mahowt sticking\nto his back like a burr.\n\n\"The Bulrampore men shouted to him to try and get the elephant to go to\nhis standing-place, saying that if he could persuade him to sit down\nthey would tie his legs up.  After the brute had exhausted itself\nsomewhat by rushing about, the mahowt did succeed in recovering control\nso far as to persuade him to move to his standing-place, which was not\nfar distant, and to our great relief he sat down in the usual way.  The\nBulrampore men were as good as their word.  Smart hands every one, they\nran up with ropes and commenced tying up his hind legs.  Being experts\nat the work, they manipulated the thick ropes with amazing rapidity, and\nhad the panting animal almost secured when he partially recovered, and\nbegan to understand what was being done to him.  He started up\nindignantly, just before the knots were properly fastened, and struck\nout right and left with his trunk, scattering the men in all directions.\n\n\"Although the ropes had not been quite secured, they were sufficiently\nfast to impede his movements.  He therefore took to venting his rage on\nthe surrounding trees, and, really, until that day, I had not realised\nthe prodigious strength of this king of beasts.  He knocked and smashed\nthem down right and left with the greatest possible ease, although, I do\nassure you, some of them were fully eight inches in diameter.  All this\ntime the old mahowt was clinging to his back, not daring to slip off.\n\n\"The men now began to lay large rope-nooses about here and there, in the\nhope that he would accidentally put a foot into one of them.  But Mowla\nBuksh was much too knowing to be caught in this way.  Whenever he came\nacross one of these nooses, he took it up with his trunk and tossed it\ncontemptuously aside.  Gradually he worked his way up to a cluster of\ntrees, near the tent in which our Director's wife had been seated all\nthe time--with what feelings I will not pretend to guess.  In this\ncluster he spent two hours, smashing down trees all the time, and\noccasionally, by way of variety, trying to lay hold of the poor mahowt,\nwho was gradually becoming exhausted through terror and the exertion of\nholding on.\n\n\"Strange to say, now and then the man appeared to regain control over\nthe beast, though only for a few seconds.  During one of these intervals\nhe even succeeded in making Mowla Buksh partially sit down.\n\n\"`Och! now or niver!  Off wid ye!' yelled a splitting voice close to my\near!  I need not tell you whose voice that was, or that its owner was\nskipping about like a gorilla, almost as mad as the elephant!\"\n\n\"Ah! sor,\" interrupted Quin, \"don't ye remimber how yourself was--but\nI'll have mercy on ye!  Go on, sor.\"\n\n\"Well, I confess,\" resumed Jackman, \"that I was a little excited.\nHowever, the Bulrampore men echoed Quin's advice in eagerly expressed\nHindustani.  The mahowt took it, slipped to the ground, and ran for his\nlife!  Fortunately the excited Mowla either did not perceive or did not\ncare.  He rose up and recommenced his work of destruction.\n\n\"All this time he had been freeing himself from the ropes, with which he\nwas imperfectly bound.  At last he detached them entirely, and began to\nmake furious rushes in every direction.\n\n\"At that critical moment our Director arrived on the scene.  Seeing how\nmatters stood he at once gave orders to have the fighting elephants\nbrought to the front, as the only chance that remained to bring the\nmischief to an end.  The orders were gladly and promptly obeyed.\n\n\"Before they arrived, however, Mowla Buksh, in one of his rushes, came\nstraight to where Quin and I were standing--\"\n\n\"Skippin', sor, ye said.\"\n\n\"Well, skipping.  But we stopped skipping at once, and took to running\nas hard as we could.  We both ran through some soft reedy ground, where\nthe brute overtook us.  I glanced over my shoulder and saw him knock\nQuin into the rushes and set his enormous foot on him--\"\n\n\"Oh! was he killed?\" exclaimed Junkie with a look of consternation at\nthe now heroic Quin!\n\nThere was a general burst of laughter, in which Junkie joined, for he\nsaw the absurdity of the question, which sudden anxiety had forced from\nhim.\n\n\"But why wasn't you killed?\" he asked almost indignantly.\n\n\"Whisht! honey, an' ye'll hear, av ye'll howld your tongue.\"\n\n\"You must know,\" continued Jackman, \"that the place he had tumbled into\nwas wet, soft ground, and Quin has a sharp way of looking after his\nlife!  Although half stunned he rolled to one side, so that only the\nside of the great foot came down on his shoulder and thrust him deep\ninto the mud.  I stopped at once with a feeling of horror, but without\nthe slightest conception of what I meant to do, and the horror was\ndeepened as I saw the monster turn with the evident intention of\ncompleting his work.\n\n\"At that terrible moment the colossal forms of Raj Mungul, Isri Pershad,\nand the mighty Chand Moorut appeared, coming towards us.  Mowla Buksh\ndid not carry out his deadly intentions.  There was `method in his\nmadness.'  Seeing the koonkies approach, he retreated at once to the\nshelter of the cluster of trees, and waited.\n\n\"I rushed forward, expecting to find my man dead and flattened, but he\nrose slowly as I came up, and with an indescribable expression of\ncountenance said, `Arrah! then, but he _was_ heavy!'\"\n\n\"An' _that_ must have been true--what-ever\" said McGregor, unable to\nrestrain a comment at this point.\n\n\"What you remark is true likewise, Shames,\" said the skipper.\n\n\"Go on--quick!\" cried Junkie, eagerly.\n\n\"Well, our Director gave orders, to take Raj Mungul to the south side of\nthe clump of trees, Isri Pershad to the west, and Chand Moorut to the\neast.  It was impossible to let the last go in, though he was impatient\nto do so, for by that time it was getting dark, and his mahowt would\nhave probably been swept off his back by the branches; and the risk of\nsuch a gladiator being let loose without a controlling hand was not to\nbe thought of for a moment.\n\n\"The difficulty was got over by means of a ruse.  Two men were sent to\nthe north side of the clump with orders to talk and attract the\nattention of Mowla.  The plan succeeded.  The moment the still fuming\nbrute heard their voices, he went at them furiously!  Now was the chance\nfor the heroic Chand Moorut; and that warrior was never known to let an\nopportunity slip.  No British bull-dog ever gave or accepted a challenge\nwith more hilarious alacrity than he.  As soon as Mowla came out of the\ntrees, Chand Moorut went at him with a rush that seemed incredible in\nsuch a mountain of usually slow and dignified flesh.  But darkness,\ncoupled perhaps with haste, interfered.  He missed his mark, and Mowla\nBuksh, turning round, dashed straight at the tent, in front of which our\nDirector and a friend were standing.  The friend, who was a V.C. as well\nas a cool and intrepid sportsman, directed the light of a lantern full\non the monster's face till it was close upon him, thus enabling the\nDirector to plant a bullet in his head.  Whether the shot gave him a\nheadache or not, I cannot tell.  The only certain effect it had was to\nturn the animal aside, and cause it to rush off in the direction of the\nmain camp, closely followed by Isri Pershad and Raj Mungul.  Chand\nMoorut was held back in reserve.  Happily Raj Mungul managed to outstrip\nand turn the runaway, and as Mowla Buksh came back, Chand Moorut got\nanother chance at him.  Need I say that he took advantage of it?\nCharging in like a live locomotive, he sent the mad creature flying--as\nif it had been a mere kitten--head over heels into a small hollow!\"\n\n\"Well done!  Capital!\" shouted Junkie, at this point unable to restrain\nhimself, as, with glittering eyes, he glanced round the circle of\nlisteners.\n\nA laugh at his enthusiasm seemed to Junkie to endorse his sentiment, so\nhe turned to Jackman and earnestly bade him to \"go on.\"\n\n\"There is not much to go on with now, my boy,\" continued the narrator;\n\"for Mowla Buksh being down, the fighting elephants took good care to\npunish him well before they let him up again.  But as the encounter had\naroused the combative propensities of Chand Moorut, it was thought wise\nto remove him from the scene before he became too excited.  This being\nmanaged by his mahowt, the punishing of the rebel was left to Isri\nPershad and Raj Mungul, who did their work thoroughly.  No sooner did\nthe culprit scramble out of the hollow than Isri Pershad knocked him\nback into it, and pummelled him heartily with trunk and legs.  Again\nMowla Buksh rose, and this time Raj Mungul gave him a tap on the\nforehead with his own ponderous head, which sent him into a bed of giant\nrushes, over the top of which his little tail was seen to wriggle\nviciously as he disappeared with a crash.\n\n\"There he would probably have been content to lie still for a time, but\nhis opponents had other views in regard to him.  They went at him\ntogether, and so cuffed, kicked, bumped and pummelled him, that in about\nfive minutes he was reduced to a pitiable state of humiliation.  As Quin\ntruly remarked at the time, his own mother would have failed to\nrecognise him.\n\n\"Just at this point, to my surprise, the old mahowt came forward, with\ntears in his eyes, and begged that his elephant might be spared!  It had\nbeen punished quite sufficiently, he thought.  I was much impressed with\nthis display of a tender, forgiving spirit towards a brute that had done\nits very best to take his own life.  But no one sympathised with him at\nthe moment, and the punishment was continued until Mowla Buksh was\nthoroughly subdued, and compelled by his conquerors to return to his\nstanding-place, where he was finally and firmly secured.  Thus, at last,\nended this exciting and most unexpected commencement to our hunt, and\nthe whole camp was soon after steeped in silence and repose.  Not a bad\nbeginning, eh, Junkie?\"\n\n\"Yes, but go on wi' the hunt,\" said the boy with eager promptitude, a\nrequest which was loudly echoed by his brothers.\n\n\"No, no, boys; you've had enough to digest for one day; besides, I see\nthe cart coming up the road to fetch our deer.  And perhaps your father\nhas more work cut out for us.\"\n\n\"Well, not much,\" replied the laird, who had been quite as much\ninterested in the elephant story as his sons.  \"There is another drive\non the east side of the hill, which we have still time for, though I\ndon't expect much from it.  However, we can try it.  Come now, lads,\nwe'll be going.\"\n\n\"Shames,\" said Captain McPherson, as the party moved away from the\nlunching-ground, \"I wonder if a good thrashin' like that would make the\nelephant a better beast afterwards?\"\n\n\"Weel now, Captain Mcphairson, I don't think it would,\" replied McGregor\nafter a pause for consideration.\n\n\"You are right, Shames,\" said Ian Anderson, the old fisherman, who was a\ndeep-thinking man.  \"It has always appeared to me, that the object of\npoonishment, is a not to make us coot, but to make us obedient.\"\n\n\"Then what for are ye always poonishin' me, an' tellin' me to be coot,\nwhen ye say it won't make me coot?\" asked Donald.\n\n\"Because, Tonal', it iss my duty to _tell_ ye to be coot, although I\ncannot _make_ ye coot, ye rascal!\" answered the fisherman, sternly; \"but\nI can make ye obey me by poonishin' you--ay, an' I wull do it too.\"\n\nDonald knew too well from experience that it was not safe to attempt\narguing the question, but he gave a peculiarly defiant shake of his\nragged head, which said as plainly as words that the time was coming\nwhen \"poonishment\" would cease to secure even obedience--at least in his\ncase!\n\n\"You are right, Ian,\" said Jackman, turning round, for he had overheard\nthe conversation.  \"Punishment compelled Mowla Buksh to walk to his\nstanding-place and submit to be tied up, for he did not dare to disobey\nwith Isri Pershad and Raj Mungul standing guard over him, but it\ncertainly did not make him good.  I went, with many others, to see him\nthe next morning.  On the way over to the elephant camp, I saw the huge\ntrees which he had smashed down in his rage lying about in all\ndirections, and on reaching his standing-place, found him looking\ndecidedly vicious and bad-tempered.  It was quite evident that any one\nventuring within reach of his trunk would receive harsh treatment and no\nmercy.  A small red spot in his great forehead showed that our\nDirector's aim had been a fairly good one, though it had not hit the\ndeadly spot in the centre.\"\n\n\"But I want to know,\" said Junkie, who kept close to Jackman's side,\nthirsting for every word that fell from his lips, \"why did the bullet\nnot go in and kill Bowly Muksh?\"\n\n\"Because the head of Mowla Buksh was too thick,\" said Jackman, laughing.\n\"You see, to be a thick-head is not always a disadvantage.\"\n\n\"There, you ought to take comfort from that, Junkie,\" remarked his\nbrother Archie, with that fine spirit of tenderness which is so often\nobservable in brothers.\n\n\"Ha! ha! ha!\" yelled Eddie, with that delicacy of feeling which is\nequally common.\n\n\"Hold your tongues!\" growled Junkie--the more classic \"shut up\" not\nhaving at that time found its way to the Western Isles.\n\n\"You must know, Junkie, that all parts of an elephant's head are not of\nequal thickness,\" said Jackman in that kindly confidential tone which\ntends so powerfully to soothe a ruffled spirit.  \"The only point in an\nelephant's forehead that can be pierced by a rifle ball is exactly in\nthe centre.  It is about the size of a saucer, and if you miss that, you\nmight as well fire against the Eagle Cliff itself, for the ball would\nonly stick in the skull.\"\n\nWith this explanation Junkie was fain to rest content at the time, for\nthe party had reached a part of the hill where it became necessary to\nstation the guns at their several posts.  In regard to this drive, we\nhave only to say that it ended in nothing except heavy rain and a severe\ndraft on the patience of the sportsmen, without any reward, save that\nwhich may be derived from mild martyrdom.\n\nNow, when the events which we have described were taking place on the\nmountains of Loch Lossie, a very different scene was occurring in the\nnursery of Kinlossie House.  In that interesting apartment, which was\none of the chief country residences of the spirits Row and Smash, little\nFlora was seated all alone in the afternoon of that day.  Her seat was a\nlow chair, before her was a low table to match.  On the table sat her\nfavourite doll, Blackie, to whom she was administering counsel of the\ngravest kind, in tones the most solemn.  The counsel, we need scarcely\nsay, gave unquestionable proof that her mother's admonitions to herself\nhad been thoroughly understood, though not always acted on.  Flo was in\nthe midst of one of her most pathetic appeals to Blackie to be \"dood,\"\nwhen her mother entered hastily.\n\n\"Come with me, darling, to visit poor old Mrs Donaldson.  She is not\nvery well, I hear.\"\n\nFlo required no second bidding, for she was extremely fond of the\nkeeper's mother--and love needs no persuasion.\n\nAs we have said, Mrs Donaldson's little cottage stood behind that of\nher son Ivor.  It was very small, consisting of only one apartment with\na box bed and a few articles of old furniture, the most cherished of\nwhich was a little clock with a staring face, and a poor landscape on\nit.\n\n\"What caused the bruise, Maggie?\" asked Mrs Gordon, after much talk on\nthe subject of fomentations and bandages.  The old woman hesitated to\ntell, but after a little pressing she said, in half apologetic\ntone,--\"Weel, mem, it was na Ivor's fau't, but the day before yesterday\nhe cam in--fou--ye ken he's fond o' his glass, mem, an' he was swingin'\naboot his airms, poor falla, an' withoot the least intention, his haund\ncam doon wi' sik a ding on my heed that knockit me doon.  But he kens na\naboot it, so ye'll no speak o't to him--or to the laird.\"\n\n\"You may depend upon it, poor Maggie, that I will not.  My mentioning it\ncould do no good.  And, as you say, Ivor was not quite himself at the\ntime.\"\n\n\"Thank'ee, mem, that's just it.  An' he's the best sons to me--_whan\nhe's sober_.\"\n\nSoon afterwards a shout outside told that the sportsmen had returned\nfrom the hills, so, bidding the old woman good-bye, Mrs Gordon and her\nsympathetic child returned to the house.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER NINE.\n\nA QUIET DAY WITH A STIRRING TERMINATION.\n\nWhat fisher does not know the charm, the calm delight, of a quiet day by\nthe river-side, after, it may be, months of too much contact with\nsociety?  On such an occasion a congenial comrade is an advantage, but\nunless the comrade be congenial, one is better alone.\n\nThis may sound selfish to some ears, but is it really so?  When a man\nhas all but immolated himself for ten or eleven months, it may be, on\nthe altar of business, art, and social duty, is a tremendous thirst for\nNature and solitude altogether selfish?  We think not.  And evidently\nMacRummle thought not, as he wandered one soft, delightful morning, rod\nin hand, down to the river-side.\n\nThe river-side!  There is something restfully suggestive in the very\nwords.  The quiet pools, the gurgling deeps, the rushing rapids, the\nrippling shallows, the little cascades--what ardent hopes, what wild\nsuggestions, what grand possibilities these have for the young; what\ngentle excitations, what pleasant, even though sad, memories for the\nold!\n\nOf course the non-fisher knows nothing of all this.  His terrestrial\njoys are limited, poor thing!  The painter, indeed, has some part in the\nmatter--as regards his own line, so to speak--and when he goes on what\nis vulgarly termed his own hook.  We have profound sympathy with the\npainter.  But for the poor fellow who neither fishes nor paints, alas!\nTo be sure he may botanise.  Strange to say, we had almost forgotten\nthat! and also geologise; but our concern at present is with fishers,\nor, rather, with that fishing enthusiast, MacRummle.\n\nThe sunshine of his face was second only to that of Nature.  His visage\nbeamed with satisfaction; his eyes gleamed with hope, as he sat down on\nthe bank near to his first pool, and began to select flies.\n\nWe have probably given the impression that MacRummle was alone, but this\nis not strictly correct.  In his own estimation he was, indeed, in\nabsolute solitude, and, so far, his felicity was unbroken; but his steps\nhad been dogged that morning, and the dogger was Junkie.\n\nThat eccentric youngster possessed a mind which it is not easy to\nanalyse or describe.  One strong element in it, however, was curiosity.\nAnother was ambition.  The blending of these two qualities produced\nwonder in Junkie--wonder that he, though as ardent a sportsman as\nMacRummle, should go forth frequently to fish and catch little or\nnothing, while the old gentleman went out and was wont to return with\nbaskets full to overflowing.  There must be a secret of some sort.  He\ndid not like to ask what that secret was, so he made up his mind to\nfollow the old man and watch him--not of course with the slightest\nintention of doing anything sly or wrong, but secretly, because he was\nwell aware that MacRummle did not like to be distracted by company--\nespecially _his_ company!\n\nFollowing, then, at a respectful distance, and relying for success very\nmuch on the fisher's partial blindness and deafness, Junkie went out to\nhave a day of it.  He even went so far, in the matter of forethought, as\nto provide himself with a massive slice of bread and cheese to sustain\nhim while carrying on his investigations.\n\nBefore he had got far from the house, however, he encountered Donald of\nthe ragged head, who had hung about the place in hopes of another\ndeer-drive, and whom he styled \"Tonal',\" in semi-sarcastic imitation of\nold Ian.  Him he at once took into his confidence.\n\n\"I'll co wuth ye,\" said Donald.\n\n\"Come along, then.  But mind, if you make a noise, or show yourself; if\nyou so much as cough or sneeze, I'll punch your head an' tumble you into\nthe river.\"\n\n\"Fery coot,\" said Donald.  And upon this clear understanding they\nadvanced.\n\nThe other members of the company at the house, meanwhile, had scattered\nin various directions to fish, shoot, paint or botanise, according to\nfancy.\n\nWe may explain here that there were several trouting streams in the\nvicinity of the house, besides the \"river\" at the head of the loch.\nThus it was that MacRummle had a stream all to himself.\n\nAt first the fisher tried fly, to which he was partial, but success did\nnot attend his efforts.  The water was not in the best condition for\nfly, being rather swollen by recent rains.  Perseverance, however, was\none of MacRummle's strong qualities.  He was not to be easily beaten.\n\nThere was a certain big boulder about the size of a dog-cart near the\nmouth of the stream, which narrowed its bed considerably, and thus\nproduced a formation of rock below water favourable to the shelter of\nfish.  It also sent an oily ripple over the surface of the water, which\nwas favourable to the operations of the fisher.  The old gentleman\nseldom failed to raise or hook a good sea-trout there, and always made\nhis first cast with eager expectation.  But the fish were either\nobdurate or blind that morning.  They could not or they would not see.\nWith a slight, but by no means desponding, sigh, the old man changed his\ncast and tried again.  He knew every stone and ledge of the pool, and\ncast again and again with consummate skill and unusual care.  Still,\nwithout result.\n\n\"That's odd,\" he muttered, for, being naturally a sociable man, he found\ntalking to himself an immense relief.  \"Try once more, just at the tail\no' yon swirl, Dick, my boy.\"\n\nHis Christian name was Richard.  No one would have presumed to call him\nDick but himself.\n\nNo result following this appeal to the tail of the swirl, he sat down on\nthe bank and once more changed his hook.  The nature of change might\nhave been heard by the insects among the heather close by, if they were\nlistening, for Donald whispered to his companion,--\"He's coin' to try\npait!\"\n\n\"Didn't I bid ye hau'd your tongue?\"\n\n\"Ay.\"\n\n\"Do't then.\"\n\nMacRummle dropped a worm gently into the head of the pool, and let it go\nwith the current.  Instantly the line straightened, the rod bent, the\nreel spun, and from the other side of the pool there leaped a lovely bar\nof silver, which fell back to its native element with a considerable\nsplash.\n\n\"A two-pounder!\" gasped Donald, unable to restrain his excitable spirit,\nas he half rose.\n\nJunkie had him by the throat in a moment, and crammed his ragged head\ndown among the heather.\n\n\"Tonal'!\" he whispered remonstratively.\n\n\"I forgot,\" whispered Donald, when the strong little hands relaxed.\n\"I'll not do't again.\"\n\n\"Ye better no',\" returned Junkie, with a shake of his fist that required\nno explanation.\n\nBy this time the fish had darted like a lightning flash twice up stream,\nonce down, three times across, and twice into the air.  At the same time\nthe fisher had hurried up and down the bank, had tripped over two stumps\nand a root, had dropped his wideawake, and had very nearly gone head\nforemost into the pool; for his tackle was fine and his fish large.  The\nfisher-boy gasped.\n\n\"Tonal',\" said Junkie, in very low tones, \"if ye don't behave better,\nI'll send ye away.\"\n\n\"It iss not easy, but I'll try,\" said he.\n\nDonald could say no more.  The best of men or boys could do no more than\ntry.  We may as well say here at once, however, that his efforts at\nself-control were crowned with success.  He proved himself to be a great\nman in embryo by ruling his own spirit that day.\n\nIn a few minutes the trout was landed by means of a miniature gaff,\nwhich the fisher carried in his basket, for the purpose of securing fish\nthat were too heavy to be pulled out by the line.  It was afterwards\nfound to be a two-and-a-half pounder, which, being an unusually good\nfish for that stream, was the occasion of much rejoicing on the part of\nthe old gentleman, as he stood wiping his forehead and commenting on it.\n\n\"Capital!  Not had such a fellow as that for more than a week.  There's\nmore where that came from; but you must give the pool a rest, Dick.  Try\nthe run higher up.\"\n\nIn obedience to his own orders, MacRummle went up to a part of the\nstream where a high cliff on one side and a steepish bank on the other\ncaused it to flow in a deep channel, not much more than a couple of\nyards wide.  At the head of the run was a ledge where fish were\ninvariably captured.  Towards this spot the old man hurried eagerly.\n\nThe two boys lay still in the heather, allowed him to pass, and then\nsoftly followed, bending low, and keeping as much as possible behind\nbushes and in hollows, until they were again close upon him.  Ensconcing\nthemselves in a convenient mass of heather, they raised their heads and\nsaw the fisher stepping carefully from rock to rock, as he approached\nthe run.\n\nRounded boulders, large or small, are never safe to walk on, even for\nthe young and active.  MacRummle found it so.  His foot slipped, and he\nsat down, with undignified haste, in a small pool of water.\n\nDown went the boys' heads, that they might explode their laughter as\nsoftly as possible among the roots of the heather.\n\n\"Wass it not funny?\" whispered Donald.\n\n\"I hope he's not hurt,\" replied Junkie, raising his head cautiously.\n\nHe saw that MacRummle had risen, and, with a rueful expression of face,\nwas making insane and futile efforts to look at himself behind.  A\nbeaming smile overspread the boy's face as he glanced at his companion,\nfor he knew well that the old gentleman cared little or nothing for\nwater.  And this was obviously the case, for, after squeezing as much\nwater out of his nether garments as chose to come, he proceeded to the\nhead of the runs and resumed fishing.\n\n\"I'm beginnin' to see through't,\" murmured Junkie, after watching for\nsome time.  \"See! he has hooked another.  Ye see, Tonal', it must be\nlettin' the hook drift away down under the ledges that does it.  Look!\nHe's got 'im!\"\n\n\"I'm thinking ye are right, Junkie.  An' the creat thing to know iss\nwhere the ledges lie.  He keeps well back from the watter also.  There\nmaun be somethin' in that, what-e-ver.  Ye wull be tryin' it yoursel'\nthe morn, maype.\"\n\nTo this Junkie vouchsafed no reply, for the fisher, having secured his\nfish, was proceeding further up stream.  When he was sufficiently far in\nadvance, the boys rose to their feet, and again followed him.\n\nThus the trio occupied themselves all the forenoon--MacRummle gradually\nfilling his basket with fine sea-trout, Junkie storing his inquisitive\nmind with piscatorial knowledge and \"dodges,\" and Donald enjoying\nhimself in the mere act of wallowing about in heather and sunshine.\n\nAbout noon MacRummle suddenly ceased to gaze intently on the water, and\nplaced his hand upon his waistcoat.\n\n\"Time, Dick?\" he murmured, pulling out his watch.  \"I knew it.  Commend\nme to nature.  It's the best time-keeper, after all--needs no\nregulating.\"\n\nHe was wrong, as was frequently the case, but it mattered little, for\nthere was no one to contradict him.\n\n\"Let me see,\" he muttered, taking off his basket, and drawing a\nnewspaper parcel from the pocket of his coat--in which operation he was\ninduced by memory to make a last futile attempt to see himself\nbehind--\"what have they put up for me?\"\n\nThe parcel, when opened, disclosed a tempting pile of meat sandwiches.\nThe old gentleman spread them out on a flattish boulder, which served as\nan admirable table.\n\nHaving leaned his rod against a tree, he emptied the basket on a grassy\nspot, and arranged the silver bars in a row.  Then he sat down on his\nbasket beside the table, and gave himself up to food and contemplation.\n\n\"A goodly row,\" he muttered, as well as the ham sandwich would let him.\n\"Not a bad beginning; and such a splendid dish.  There's comfort in\nthat, for I hate useless work of any kind.  A sort of an illustration,\nthis, of the fitness of things!\"\n\nApparently the peculiar unfitness of simultaneous mastication and speech\nstruck him, for he paused a few moments, then continued,--\"Yes, fitness.\nSupplies for the table absolutely needed.  Healthy exercise a\nconsequence.  Result, felicity!\"\n\nThe supplies checking speech again, MacRummle looked around him, with\nbenignant good-will to man and beast expressed on his countenance.\n\nCraning their necks over a bank, and seeing the old gentleman thus\npleasantly engaged, the two boys sank into the heather, and disappeared\nfrom view as completely as did \"Clan Alpine's warriors true,\" after they\nhad been shown to Fitz James by Roderick Dhu.  Like two sparrows in a\npurple nest they proceeded to enjoy themselves.\n\n\"Now, Tonal', we will grub,\" said Junkie.  \"Why, what's the matter with\nyou?\" he asked, on observing a sudden fall in his companion's\ncountenance.\n\n\"The matter?\" repeated the boy.  \"It iss the crub that's the matter, for\nI hev not a crumb with me.\"\n\n\"Now, isn't that awful?\" said Junkie, with a hypocritically woeful look.\n\"We will just have to starve.  But there's plenty of water,\" he added,\nin a consoling tone.  \"Here, Tonal', take this leather cup an' fill it.\nYe can git down to the river by the back o' the bluff without bein'\nnoticed.  See that ye make no noise, now.  Mind what I said to ye.\"\n\nWhile Donald went at a slow, sad pace to fetch water, Junkie spread his\nhandkerchief on the ground, and on this tablecloth laid out the\nfollowing articles, which he took from a small bag that he had carried,\nslung on his shoulder,--a very large piece of loaf bread, a thick slice\nof cheese, two hard biscuits, an apple, a bit of liquorice, a mass of\nhome-made toffee, inseparably attached to a dirty bit of newspaper,\nthree peppermint lozenges, and a gully knife with a broken blade.\n\nWhen Donald returned and beheld this feast, he opened his eyes wide.\nThen, opening his mouth, he was on the point of giving vent to a cheer,\nwhen Junkie stopped him with a glance and an ominous shake of the fist.\n\nIt is to this day an undecided question which of those feasters enjoyed\nhimself most.\n\n\"I always bring with me more than I can eat, Tonal', so you're welcome\nto the half.  `Fair play,' as daddy says, although he sometimes keeps\nthe fairest play to himself;\" with which dutiful remark the urchin\nproceeded to divide the viands very justly.\n\nIt did not take long to consume the whole.  But MacRummle was quicker\neven than they, possibly because he had enticing work still before him.\nThe consequence was, that he had resumed his rod unnoticed by the boys,\nand in the process of his amusement, had reached that part of the bank\non the top of which they lay concealed.  Their devotion to lunch had\nprevented his approach being perceived, and the first intimation they\nhad of his near presence was the clatter of pebbles as he made a false\nstep, and the swish of his flies above their heads as he made a cast.\n\nThe boys gazed at each other for one moment in silence, then hastily\nstuffed the remnant of their feast into their pockets.\n\nSuddenly the glengarry bonnet of Junkie leaped mysteriously off his\nhead, and dropped on the heather behind him.\n\n\"Hanked again!\" growled MacRummle from the river-bed below.\n\nEvery fisher knows the difficulty of casting a long line with a steep\nbank behind him.  Once already the old gentleman had hanked on the bank\na little lower down, but so slightly that a twitch brought the flies\naway.  Now, however, the hank was too complicated to give way to a\ntwitch, for the glengarry held hard on to the heather.  In desperate\nhaste, Junkie, bending low, tried to extract the hook.  It need scarcely\nbe said that a hook refuses to be extracted in haste.  Before he could\nfree it, the voice of MacRummle was heard in sighs and gasps of mild\nexasperation as he scrambled up the bank to disentangle his line.  There\nwas no time for consideration.  Junkie dropped his cap, and, rolling\nbehind a mass of rock, squeezed himself into a crevice which was pretty\nwell covered with pendent bracken.  Donald vanished in a somewhat\nsimilar fashion, and both, remaining perfectly still, listened with\npalpitating hearts to MacRummle's approach.\n\n\"Well, well!\" exclaimed the fisher in surprise; \"it's not every day I\nhook a fish like this.  A glengarry!  And Junkie's glengarry!  The small\nrascal!  Crumbs, too! ha! that accounts for it.  He must have been\nhaving his lunch here yesterday, and was so taken up with victuals that\nhe forgot his cap when he went away.  Foolish boy!  It is like his\ncarelessness; but he's not a bad little fellow, for all that.\"\n\nHe chuckled audibly at this point.  Junkie did the same inaudibly as he\nwatched his old friend carefully disengage the hook; but the expression\nof his face changed a little when he saw his cap consigned to the\nfisher's pocket, as he turned and descended to the stream.  Having given\nthe fisher sufficient time to get away from the spot, Junkie emerged\nfrom his hiding-place.\n\n\"Tonal',\" he said, in a low voice, looking round, \"ye may come oot noo,\nman.  He's safe away.\"\n\nThe ragged head, in a broad grin, emerged from a clump of bracken.\n\n\"It wass awful amusin', Junkie, wass it not?\"\n\n\"Yes, Tonal', it was; but it won't be very amusin' for me to go all the\nrest of the day bareheaded.\"\n\nDonald sympathised with his friend on this point, and assured him that\nhe would have divided his cap with him, as Junkie had divided his lunch,\nbut for the fact that he never wore a cap at all, and the ragged hair\nwould neither divide nor come off.  After this they resumed their work\nof dogging the fisher's steps.\n\nIt would require a volume to relate all that was said and done on that\nlovely afternoon, if all were faithfully detailed; but our space and the\nreader's patience render it advisable to touch only on two points of\ninterest.\n\nAs the day advanced the heat became overpowering, and, to escape from\nthe glare of the sun for a little, the fisher took shelter under some\nvery tall bracken on the bank near a deep pool.  In order to secure a\nslight feeling of pleasurable expectation while resting, he put on a\nbait-cast, dropped the worm into the deepest part of the pool, propped\nup his rod with several stones, and then lay down to watch.  The turf\nhappened to be soft and level.  As a natural consequence the tired man\nfell sound asleep.\n\n\"What's to be done noo, Junkie?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Tonal'.\"\n\nTo make matters more exasperating, at that moment the rod began to bend\nand the reel to spin jerkily.\n\n\"A fush!\" exclaimed Donald.\n\n\"Looks like it,\" returned his friend drily.\n\n\"I better gee a yell an' wauken him,\" suggested Donald.\n\n\"Ye'd better no',\" said Junkie, shaking his fist.\n\n\"Yonder iss the end o' yer bonnet stickin' oot o' his pooch,\nwhat-e-ver,\" said Donald.\n\n\"You'd better lie low an' keep still,\" said Junkie; and, without further\nexplanation of his intentions, he went softly down the bank and crept\ntowards the sleeper, taking advantage of every stone and root and bush\nas he went along.  Really, for a first attempt, it was worthy of the\nchild of a Pawnee brave.\n\nMacRummle was a heavy sleeper, so Junkie had no difficulty in recovering\nhis cap.  Putting it on, he returned the way he had come.\n\n\"That wass cliver, man,\" said the admiring Donald, when his friend\nrejoined him.\n\nJunkie accepted the compliment with a dignified smile, and then sat down\nto wait; but it was a severe trial of patience to both of them, for the\nold man slept steadily on, and even snored.  He seemed, in short, to\nhave fairly gone to bed for the night.\n\n\"What say ye to bomb stanes at 'um?\" suggested Donald.\n\n\"An' kill 'im, maybe,\" returned Junkie, with sarcasm in his eye.\n\n\"Heave divits at 'um, then.\"\n\n\"Ay; that's better.\"\n\nAccordingly, the two urchins tore up a mass of turf which was much too\nheavy to heave.\n\n\"Let's row'd,\" suggested the active-minded Donald.\n\nAs this also met the approval of Junkie, they carried the \"divit,\" or\nmass of turf, to the bank just above the sleeper, and, taking a careful\naim, let it go.  The bank was not regular.  A lump diverted the divit\nfrom its course, and it plunged into the pool, to the obvious\ndiscomposure of the fish, which was still at intervals tugging at the\nline.  Another divit was tried, but with similar result.  A third clod\nwent still further astray.  The bombardment then became exciting, as\nevery kind of effort does when one begins to realise the beneficial\neffect of practice.\n\n\"I can see how it is,\" whispered Junkie, as he carefully \"laid\" the next\ngun.  \"If we keep more to the right, it'll hit that lump o' grass,\nglance into the hollow, and--\"\n\nHe stopped abruptly, and both boys stood in crab-like attitudes of\nexpectation, ready to fly, for the divit took the exact course thus\nindicated, and bounding down the bank, hit MacRummle fair on his broad\nback.\n\nThe guilty ones dived like rabbits into the bracken.\n\n\"Bless me!\" exclaimed the old gentleman, jumping up and shaking the dry\nearth off.  \"This is most remarkable.  I do believe I've been asleep.\nBut why the bank should take to crumbling down upon me is more than I\ncan understand.  Hallo!  A fish!  You don't deserve such luck, Dick, my\nboy.\"\n\nWinding in the line in a way which proved that the divit had done him no\nharm, he gave utterance to an exclamation of huge disgust as he drew an\neel to the bank, with the line entangled hopelessly about its shiny\nbody.  This was too much for MacRummle.  Unable to face the misery of\ndisentanglement, he cut the line, despatched the eel, attached a new\nhook, and continued his occupation.\n\nAt the head of the pool in question the bank was so precipitous and high\nthat the boys could see only the top of the rod swinging gracefully to\nand fro as the patient man pursued his sport.  Suddenly the top of the\nrod described a wild figure in the air and disappeared.  At the same\nmoment a heavy plunge was heard.\n\n\"Hech! he's tum'led in the pool,\" gasped Donald.\n\nThey rushed to the overhanging edge of the cliff and looked down.  Sure\nenough MacRummle was in the water.  They expected to see him swim, for\nJunkie knew he was an expert swimmer; but the poor man was floating\nquietly down with the current, his head under water.\n\n\"Banged his heed, what-e-ver!\" cried Donald, jumping up and bounding\ndown the bank to the lower and shallow end of the pool.  Quick though he\nwas, Junkie outran him; but the unfortunate MacRummle was\nunintentionally quicker than either, for they found him stranded when\nthey got there.\n\nRunning into the water, they seized him by the hair and the collar of\nhis coat, and dragged him into the shallow part easily enough, but they\nhad not strength to haul him ashore.\n\n\"Fetch a divit, Tonal'--a big one, an' I'll keep up his head.\"\n\nOne of the masses of recent artillery was fetched, and the fisher's head\nwas gently pillowed on it, so as to be well out of the water.\n\n\"There's no cut that I can see,\" said Junkie, inspecting the head\ncritically; \"he's only stunned, I think.  Noo, Tonal', cut away to the\nhoose.  Run as ye never ran before and tell them.  I'll stop beside him\nfor fear his heed slips in again.\"\n\nDonald went off like a shot.  Junkie went a few steps with him,\nintending to fetch another divit.  Looking back, he saw what made him\nsink into the heather, and give a low whistle.  Donald heard it,\nstopped, and also hid himself, for MacRummle was seen trying to rise.\nHe succeeded, and staggered to dry land, when, sitting down on a stone,\nhe felt himself all over with an anxious expression.  Then he felt a\nlump on the back of his head, and smiled intelligently.  After that he\nsqueezed as much water out of his garments as he could, quietly took\ndown his rod, ascertained that the fish in his basket were all right,\nthen looked with some perplexity at the big divit lying in the shallow\nclose to where he stood, and finally, with a highly contented expression\nof countenance, wended his way homeward.\n\nThe two boys gave him time to get well out of sight in advance, and then\nfollowed his example, commenting sagely as they went, on the\ndesirability of possessing pluck in old age, and on the value of the\nvarious lessons they had learned that day.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TEN.\n\nA WILDISH CHAPTER.\n\nIt was the habit of our three friends--Bob Mabberly, John Barret, and\nGiles Jackman--during their residence at Kinlossie, to take a stroll\ntogether every morning before breakfast by the margin of the sea, for\nthey were fond of each other's company, and Mabberly, as a yachtsman,\nhad acquired the habit of early rising.  He had also learned to\nappreciate the early morning hours as being those which present Nature\nin her sweetest, as well as her freshest, aspect--when everything seems,\nmore than at other periods of the day, to be under the direct influence\nof a benignant Creator.\n\nIt was also the habit of Captain McPherson and his man, James McGregor,\nto indulge daily in similar exercise at about the same hour, but, owing\nprobably to their lives having been spent chiefly on the sea, they were\nwont to ramble up a neighbouring glen in preference to sauntering on the\nshore.\n\nOne bright calm morning, however, when the sky was all blue and the loch\nwas like a mirror, the two seamen took it into their heads to desert the\nglen and ramble along the shore.  Thus it came to pass that, on\nreturning homeward, they encountered our three friends.\n\n\"It iss fery strange that we should foregather this mornin', Mr\nMabberly,\" said the skipper, after greeting the young men; \"for Shames\nan' me was jist speakin' aboot ye.  We will be thinkin' that it iss\nfoolishness for hum an' me to be stoppin' here wastin' our time when we\nought to be at oor work.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Captain,\" said Mabberly; \"surely you don't think that taking\na holiday in a pleasant place like this is wasting time.  Besides, I\ndon't consider you free from your engagement to me.  You were hired for\nthe trip, and that includes land as well as water, so I won't give you\nyour discharge till you have had a long rest, and recruited yourselves\nafter the shock to your nervous systems occasioned by the wreck and the\nswim to shore!\"\n\nA grim smile played on the skipper's iron features when reference was\nmade to his nerves, and a flicker of some sort illumined the wooden\nvisage of McGregor.\n\n\"You are fery kind, sir,\" returned the skipper; \"but we don't like to be\nreceivin' pay for doin' nothin'.  You see, neither Shames nor me cares\nmuch for fushin' in the burns, or goin' after the deer, an' there's no\nchance o' raisin' the yat from the pottom o' the sea, so, if you hev no\nobjection, sir, we will be goin' by the steamer that arrives to-morrow.\nI thought I would speak to you to-day, for we will hev to start early in\nthe mornin', before you're up, for it iss a long way we'll hev to go.\nIss it not so, Shames?\"\n\n\"Oo, ay,\" replied the seaman, with more than ever of the nasal twang;\n\"it iss a coot many miles to where the poat comes in--so the poy Tonal'\nwass tellin' me, what-e-ver.\"\n\nMabberly tried to persuade the men to remain a little longer, but they\nwere obdurate, so he let them go, knowing well that his father, who was\na wealthy merchant and shipowner, would see to the interests of the men\nwho had suffered in his son's service.\n\nAs they retraced their steps to the house the skipper gave Giles Jackman\nsome significant glances, which induced him to fall behind the others.\n\n\"You want to speak with me privately, I think, skipper?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, I do,\" replied the seaman, with some embarrassment.  \"But it\niss not fery easy nor pleesant to do so.  A man does not like to speak\nof another man's failin's, you see, but as I am goin' away I'm obleeged\nto do it.  You will hev noticed, sir, that Ivor Tonalson iss raither\nfond of his tram?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid that I have observed that--poor fellow.\"\n\n\"He is a goot man, sir, is Tonalson--a fery goot man--when he iss sober,\nbut he hes got no power to resist the tram.  An' whiles he goes on the\nspree, an' then he gits wild wi' D.T. you know, sir.  Noo, ever since we\ncam' here, Ivor an' me hes been great friends, an' it hes been heavy on\nmy mind to see him like that, for he's a fine man, a superior person, is\nIvor, if he would only let alone the whusky.  So I hev spoken to him\nwance or twice--serious like, you know.  At first he was not pleased,\nbut the last time I spoke, he took it kindly, an' said he would think\naboot what I had been sayin'.  Noo, it's heavy on me the thoucht o'\ngoin' away an' leavin' him in that state, so I thoucht that maybe ye\nwould tak the metter up, sir, an' see what ye can do wi' him.  Git him,\nif ye can, to become a total abstainer, nothin' less than that wull do\nwi' a man in that condeetion.\"\n\nJackman was greatly surprised, not only at the tenor of the skipper's\nremarks, but at the evidently deep feeling with which he spoke, for up\nto that time the reticence and quiet coolness of the man had inclined\nhim to think that his mind and feelings were in harmony with his rugged\nand sluggish exterior.  It was, therefore, with something of warmth that\nhe replied,--\"I shall be only too happy to do as you wish, Captain; all\nthe more that I have had some serious thoughts and feelings in that\ndirection.  Indeed, I have made up my mind, as it happens, to speak to\nIvor on that very subject, not knowing that you were already in the\nfield.  I am particularly sorry for his poor old mother, who has\nsuffered a great deal, both mentally and physically, on his account.\"\n\n\"Ay, that's the warst o' it,\" said the skipper.  \"It wass the sicht o'\nthe poor wumin ailin' in body an' broken heartit that first set me at\nIvor.\"\n\n\"But how comes it, Captain, that you plead so earnestly for _total_\nabstinence?\" asked Jackman with a smile.  \"Have I not heard you defend\nthe idea of moderate drinking, although you consented to sail in a\nteetotal yacht?\"\n\n\"Mr Jackman,\" said the skipper, with almost stern solemnity, \"it iss\nall fery weel for men to speak aboot moderate drinkin', when their\nfeelin's iss easy an' their intellec's iss confused wi' theories an'\nfancies, but men will change their tune when it iss brought home to\nthemselves.  Let a man only see his brither or his mither, or his\nfaither, on the high road to destruction wi' drink, an' he'll change his\nopeenion aboot moderate drinkin'--at least for hard drinkers--ay, an'\nhe'll change his practice too, unless he iss ower auld, or his stamick,\nlike Timothy's, canna git on withoot it.  An' that minds me that I would\ntak it kind if ye would write an' tell me how he gets on, for I hev\npromised to become a total abstainer if _he_ wull.\"\n\nThat very afternoon, while out shooting on the hills, Jackman opened the\ncampaign by making some delicate approaches to the keeper on the\nsubject, in a general and indirect way, but with what success he could\nnot tell, for Ivor was respectfully reserved.\n\nAbout the same time John Barret went off alone for a saunter in one of\nthe nearest and most picturesque of the neighbouring glens.  He had\ndeclined to accompany his comrades that day, for reasons best known to\nhimself.  After writing a few letters, to keep up appearances, and to\nprevent his being regarded as a mere idler, he went off, as we have\nsaid, to saunter in the glen.\n\nHe had not sauntered far when he came upon a sight which is calculated,\nwhenever seen, to arouse sentiments of interest in the most callous\nbeholder--a young lady painting!  It would be wrong to say he was\nsurprised, but he was decidedly pleased, to judge from the expression of\nhis handsome face.  He knew who the lady was, for by that time he had\nstudied the face and figure of Milly Moss until they had been indelibly\nphotographed on his--well, on the sensitive-plate of his soul, wherever\nthat lay.\n\nMilly had quite recovered from her accident by that time and had resumed\nher favourite pursuits.\n\n\"I'm very glad to have caught you at work at last, Miss Moss,\" he said,\non coming up to the picturesque spot on which her easel was erected.  \"I\nwish much to receive that lesson which you so kindly promised to give\nme.\"\n\n\"I thought it was just the other way.  Did you not say that you would\nteach me some of those perplexing rules of perspective which my book\nlays down so elaborately--and, to me, so incomprehensibly?\"\n\n\"I did, but did not you promise to show me how to manipulate oils--in\nregard to which I know absolutely nothing?  And as practice is of\ngreater importance than theory, you must be the teacher and I the\npupil.\"\n\nUpon this point they carried on a discussion until Milly, declaring she\nwas wasting her time and losing the effects of light and shade, went\nseriously to work on the canvas before her.  Barret, whose natural\ncolour was somewhat heightened, stood at a respectful distance, looking\non.\n\n\"You are quite sure, I hope,\" said the youth, \"that it does not disturb\nyou to be overlooked?  You know I would not presume to do so if you had\nnot promised to permit me.  My great desire, for many a day, has been to\nobserve the process of painting in oils by one who understands it.\"\n\nHow he reconciled this statement with the fact that he was not looking\nat the picture at all, but at the little white hand that was deftly\napplying the brush, and the beautiful little head that was moving itself\nso gracefully about while contemplating the work, is more than we can\nexplain.\n\nSoon the painter became still more deeply absorbed in her work, and the\npupil more deeply still in the painter.  It was a magnificent sweep of\nlandscape that lay before them--a glen glowing with purple and green,\nalive with flickering sunlight and shadow, with richest browns and reds\nand coolest greys in the foreground; precipices, crags, verdant slopes\nof bracken, pine and birch woods hanging on the hillsides, in the middle\ndistance, and blue mountains mingling with orange skies in the\nbackground, with MacRummle's favourite stream appearing here and there\nlike a silver thread, running through it all.  But Barret saw nothing of\nit.  He only saw a pretty hand, a blushing cheek and sunny hair!\n\nThe picture was not bad.  There was a good deal of crude colour in the\nforeground, no doubt, without much indication of form; and there was\nalso some wonderfully vivid green and purple, with impossible forms and\namazing perspective--both linear and aerial--in places, and Turneresque\nconfusion of yellow in the extreme distance.  But Barret did not note\nthat--though by means of some occult powers of comprehension he\ncommented on it freely!  He saw nothing but Milly Moss.\n\nIt was a glorious chance.  He resolved to make the most of it.\n\n\"I had no idea that painting in oils was such a fascinating occupation,\"\nhe remarked, without feeling quite sure of what he said.\n\n\"I delight in it,\" returned the painter, slowly, as she touched in a\ndistant sheep, which--measured by the rules of perspective, and regard\nbeing had to surrounding objects--might have stood for an average\ncathedral.\n\nMilly did not paint as freely as usual that afternoon.  There was\nsomething queer, she said, about the brushes.  \"I _can't_ get it to look\nright,\" she said at last, wiping out an object for the third time and\ntrying again.\n\n\"No doubt,\" murmured the youth, \"a cottage like that must be difficult\nto--\"\n\n\"Cottage!\" exclaimed Milly, laughing outright; \"it is not a cottage at\nall; it's a cow!  Oh!  Mr Barret, that is a very poor compliment to my\nwork and to your own powers of discernment.\"\n\n\"Nay, Miss Moss,\" retorted the pupil, in some confusion, \"but you have\nwiped it out twice, confessing, as you did so, that you could not paint\nit!  Besides, my remark referred to the cottage which I _thought_ you\nwere going to paint--not to your unsuccessful representations of the\ncow.\"\n\nThe poor youth felt that his explanation was so lame that he was\nsomewhat relieved when the current of their thoughts was diverted by a\nloud shouting in the road farther down the glen.  A shade of annoyance,\nhowever, rested for a moment on the face of his companion, for she\nrecognised the voices, and knew well that the quiet _tete-a-tete_ with\nher willing and intelligent pupil must now be interrupted.\n\n\"My cousins,\" she remarked, putting a touch on the cow that stamped that\nanimal a _lusus naturae_ for all time coming.\n\nAnother whoop told that the cousins were drawing near.  In a few minutes\nthey appeared in the path emerging from a clump of hazel bushes.\n\n\"They are evidently bent on a photographic expedition,\" remarked Barret,\nas the boys approached, Junkie waving his hat with hilarious good-will\nwhen he discovered the painters.\n\n\"And Flo is with them,\" said Milly, \"from which I conclude that they are\nhaving what Junkie calls a day of it; for whenever they are allowed to\ntake Flo, they go in for a high holiday, carrying provisions with them,\nso as to be able to stay out from morning till night.\"\n\nThe appearance of the young revellers fully bore out Milly's statement,\nfor they were all more or less burdened with the means or signs of\nenjoyment.  Archie carried his box of dry plates in his left hand, and\nhis camera and stand over his right shoulder; Eddie bore a colour-box\nand sketching-book; Junkie wielded a small fishing-rod, and had a\nfishing-basket on his back; and Flo was encircled with daisy chains and\ncrowned with laurel and heather, besides which, each of the boys had a\nsmall bag of provisions slung on his shoulder.\n\n  \"Hooray! hooray!\n  Out for the day!\"\n\nsang, or rather yelled, Junkie, as he approached.\n\n  \"Ramble and roam--\n  Never go home!\"\n\nadded Archie, setting down his camera, and beginning to arrange it.\n\n  \"All of us must\n  Eat till we bust!\n\n\"Junkie teached me zat,\" said innocent Flo, with a look of grave\nsurprise at the peals of laughter which her couplet drew from her\nbrothers.\n\n\"Yes, that's what we're goin' to do,\" said Junkie; \"we've had lunch at\nthe foot of Eagle Glen, and noo we are going up to Glen Orrack to dine,\nand fish, an' paint, an' botanise.  After that we'll cross over the\nSwan's Neck, an' finish off the bustin' business with supper on the\nsea-shore.  Lots of grub left yet, you see.\"\n\nHe swung round his little wallet as he spoke, and held it up to view.\n\n\"Would you like some, Cousin Milly?\" asked Eddie, opening his bag.  \"All\nsorts here.  Bread, cheese, ginger snaps, biscuits, jam--Oh!  I say, the\njam-pot's broken!  Whatever shall we do?\"\n\nHe dipped his fingers into his wallet as he spoke, and brought them out\nmagenta!\n\nTheir hilarity was dissipated suddenly, and grave looks were bestowed on\nEddie's digits, until Flo's little voice arose like a strain of sweet\nmusic to dissipate the clouds.\n\n\"Oh! never mind,\" she said; \"I's got anuzzer pot in my bag.\"\n\nThis had been forgotten.  The fact was verified by swift examination,\nand felicity was restored.\n\n\"What are you going to photograph?\" asked Milly, seeing that Archie was\nbusy making arrangements.\n\n\"_You_, Cousin Milly.  You've no notion what a splendid couple you and\nMr Barret look--stuck up so picturesquely on that little mound, with\nits rich foreground of bracken, and the grey rock beside you, and the\npeep through the bushes, with Big Ben for a background; and the easel,\ntoo--so suggestive!  There, now, I'm ready.  By the way, I might take\nyou as a pair of lovers!\"\n\nPoor Milly became scarlet, and suddenly devoted herself to the _lusus\nnaturae_!  Barret took refuge in a loud laugh, and then said:\n\n\"Really, one would suppose that you were a professional, Archie; you\norder your sitters about with such self-satisfied presumption.\"\n\n\"Yes, they always do that,\" said Milly, recovering herself, and looking\ncalmly up from the cow--which now resembled a megatherium--\"but you must\nremember, Cousin Archie, that I am a _painter_, and therefore understand\nabout attitudes, and all that, much better than a mere photographer.\nSo, if I condescend to sit, you must take your orders from _me_!\"\n\n\"Fire away then with your orders,\" cried the impatient amateur.\n\n\"See, sir, I will sit thus--as if painting,\" said Milly, who was\ndesperately anxious to have it over, lest Archie should make some\nawkward proposition.  \"Mr Barret will stand behind me, looking\nearnestly at the picture--\"\n\n\"Admiringly,\" interposed Barret.\n\n\"Not so--earnestly, as if getting a lesson,\" said Milly, with a\nteacher's severity; \"and Flo will sit thus, at my feet, taking care\n(hold it, dear,) of my palette.\"\n\n\"More likely to make a mess of it,\" said Junkie.\n\n\"Now, are you ready?  Steady!  Don't budge a finger,\" cried Archie,\nremoving the little leather cap.\n\nIn her uncertainty as to which of her fingers she was not to budge, Flo\nnervously moved them all.\n\n\"You're movin', Flo!\" whispered Junkie.\n\n\"No, I'm not,\" said Flo, looking round indignantly.\n\n\"There, I knew you couldn't hold your tongue, Junkie,\" cried the\nphotographer, hastily replacing the cap.  \"However, I think I had it\ndone before she moved.\"\n\n\"And look--you've got the nigger in!\" cried Junkie, snatching up the\nblack doll, which had been lying unobserved on its owner's knee all the\ntime.\n\n\"Never mind, that'll do no harm.  Now, then, soldiers, form up, an'\nquick march,\" said Archie, closing up his apparatus.  \"We have got\nplenty of work before us, and no time to waste.\"\n\nObedient to this rather inaccurately given word of command, Archie's\ntroops fell into line, and, with a whooping farewell, continued their\nmarch up the glen.\n\nDuring the remainder of that beautiful afternoon, the artist and pupil\ncontinued at their \"fascinating\" work.  Shall we take advantage of our\nknowledge to lift the curtain, and tell in detail how Milly introduced a\nfew more megatheriums into her painting, and violated nearly all the\nrules of perspective, to say nothing of colour and chiaro-oscuro?  Shall\nwe reveal the multitude of absurd remarks made by the pupil, in his wild\nattempts at criticism of an art, about which he knew next to nothing?\nNo; it would be unwarrantable--base!  Merely remarking that painter and\npupil were exceedingly happy, and that they made no advance whatever in\nthe art of painting, we turn to another scene in the neighbourhood of\nKinlossie House.\n\nIt was a wide grass-field from which the haycocks had recently been\nremoved, leaving it bare and uninteresting.  Nevertheless, there were\ntwo points of interest in that field which merit special attention.  One\nwas a small black bull, with magnificent horns, the shaggiest of coats,\nand the wickedest of eyes.  The other was our friend MacRummle, taking a\nshort cut through the field, with a basket on his back, a rod in one\nhand, and an umbrella in the other.\n\nWe may at once account for the strange presence of the latter article,\nby explaining that, on the day before--which was rainy--the laird, had\nwith an umbrella, accompanied his friend to his first pool in the river,\nat which point their roads diverged; that he had stayed to see MacRummle\nmake his first two or three casts, during which time the sky cleared,\ninducing the laird to close his umbrella, and lean it against the bank,\nafter which he went away and forgot it.  Returning home the next day our\nangler found and took charge of it.\n\nThat he had been successful that day was made plain, not only by the\nextra stoop forward, which was rendered necessary by the weight of his\nbasket, and the beaming satisfaction on his face, but by the protruding\ntail of a grilse which was too large to find room for the whole of\nitself, inside.\n\n\"You're a lucky man to-day, Dick,\" murmured the enthusiastic angler to\nhimself, as he jogged across the field.\n\nHad he known what was in store for him, however, he would have arrived\nat a very different estimate of his fortunes!\n\nThe field, as we have said, was a large one.  MacRummle had reached the\ncentre of it when the black bull, standing beside the wall at its most\ndistant corner, seemed to feel resentment at this trespass on its\ndomain.\n\nIt suddenly bellowed in that low thunderous tone which is so awfully\nsuggestive of conscious power.  MacRummle stopped short.  He was\nnaturally a brave man, nevertheless his heart gave his ribs an unwonted\nthump when he observed the bull in the distance glaring at him.  He\nlooked round in alarm.  Nothing but an unbroken flat for a hundred yards\nlay around him in all directions, unrelieved by bush, rock, or tree, and\nbounded by a five-foot wall, with only one gate, near to where the bull\nstood pawing the earth and apparently working itself into a rage.\n\n\"Now, Dick,\" murmured the old gentleman, seriously, \"it's do or die with\nyou if that brute charges, for your legs are not much better than\npipe-stems, and your wind is--Eh! he comes!\"\n\nTurning sharply, he caused the pipe-stems to wag with amazing velocity--\ntoo fast, indeed, for his toe, catching on something, sent him violently\nto the ground, and the basket flew over his head with such force that\nthe strap gave way.  He sprang up instantly, still unconsciously holding\non to rod and umbrella.\n\nMeanwhile, the bull, having made up its mind, came charging down the\nfield with its eyes flashing and its tail on high.\n\nMacRummle looked back.  He saw that the case was hopeless.  He was\nalready exhausted and gasping.  A young man could scarcely have reached\nthe wall in time.  Suddenly he came to a ditch, one of those narrow open\ndrains with which inhabitants of wet countries are familiar.  The sight\nof it shot a blaze of hope through his despair!  He stopped at once,\ndropped his rod, and, putting up his umbrella, laid it on the ground.\nIt was a large cotton one of the Gamp description.  Under the shelter of\nit he stepped quietly into the ditch, which was not much more than\nknee-deep, with very little water in it.\n\nPlacing the umbrella in such a position that it came between himself and\nthe bull, he laid himself flat down in the drain.  The opening was far\ntoo narrow to admit his broad shoulders, except when turned sidewise.\nThe same treatment was not applicable to other parts of his person, but,\nby dint of squeezing and collapsing, he got down, nestled under the\nbank, and lay still.\n\nOn came the bull till it reached the basket, which, with a deft toss, it\nhurled into the air and sent the silvery treasure flying.  A moment more\nand it went head foremost into the umbrella.  Whether it was surprised\nat finding its enemy so light and unsubstantial, or at the slipping of\none of its feet into the drain, we cannot tell, but the result was that\nit came down and turned a complete somersault over the drain, carrying\nthe umbrella along with it in its mad career!\n\nWhen the bull scrambled to its feet again, and looked round in some\nsurprise, it found that one of its legs and both its horns were through\nand entangled with the wrecked article.\n\nIt was a fine sight to witness the furious battle that immediately\nensued between the black bull and that cotton umbrella!  Rage at the man\nwas evidently transmuted into horror at the article.  The bull pranced\nand shook its head and pawed about in vain efforts to get rid of its\ntormenter.  Shreds of the wreck flapped wildly in its eyes.  Spider-like\nribs clung to its massive limbs and poked its reeking sides, while the\nswaying handle kept tapping its cheeks and ears and nose, as if taunting\nthe creature with being held and badgered by a thing so flimsy and\ninsignificant!\n\nHappily this stirring incident was not altogether unwitnessed.  Far up\nthe valley it was observed by four living creatures, three of whom\nimmediately came tearing down the road at racing speed.  Gradually their\ndifferent powers separated them from each other.  Archie came first,\nEddie next, and Junkie brought up the rear.  On nearing the field the\nfirst wrenched a stake out of a fence; the second caught up a rake, that\nhad been left by the haymakers; and the last, unscrewing the butt of his\nrod, broke the line, and flourished the weapon as a cudgel.  They all\nthree leaped into the field one after another, and bore courageously\ndown on the bull, being well accustomed to deal with animals of the\nsort.\n\nSeparating as they drew near, they attacked him on three sides at once.\nShort work would he have made with any of them singly; together they\nwere more than his match.  When he charged Junkie, Archie ran in and\nbrought the stake down on his skull.  When he turned on his assailant,\nEddie combed his sides with the rake.  Dashing at the new foe he was\ncaught by the tail by Junkie, who applied the butt of his rod\nvigorously, the reel adding considerable weight to his blows.  At last\nthe bull was cowed--if we may venture to say so--and driven\nignominiously into a corner of the field, where he vented his rage on\nthe remnants of the umbrella, while the victors returned to the field of\nbattle.\n\n\"But what's come of MacRummle?\" said the panting Junkie as they gathered\nup the fish and replaced them in the basket.  \"I never saw him get over\nthe wall.  Did you?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Archie, looking round in surprise.\n\n\"I dare say he ran off while we were thumpin' the bull,\" suggested\nEddie.\n\n\"I'm here, boys!  I'm here, Junkie,\" cried a strange sepulchral voice,\nas if from the bowels of the earth.\n\n\"Where?\" asked the boys gazing down at their feet with expressions of\nawe.\n\n\"He's i' the drain!\" cried Junkie with an expanding mouth.\n\n\"Ay--that's it!  I'm in the drain!  Lend a hand, boys; I can hardly\nmove.\"\n\nThey ran to him instantly, but it required the united powers of all\nthree to get him out, and when they succeeded he was found to be coated\nall over one side with thick mud.\n\n\"What a muddle you've made of yourself, to be sure!\" exclaimed Junkie.\n\"Let me scrape you.\"\n\nBut MacRummle refused to be scraped until they had placed the five-foot\nwall between himself and the black bull.  Then he submitted with a\nprofound sigh.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ELEVEN.\n\nPECULIAR INCIDENTS OF A SABBATH AMONG THE WESTERN ISLES.\n\nOne beautiful Sunday morning while the party assembled in Kinlossie\nHouse was at breakfast, a message was brought to the laird that he \"wass\nwantit to speak wi' the poy Tonal'.\"\n\n\"Well, Donald, my lad, what want ye with me this fine morning?\" asked\nthe laird, on going out to the hall.\n\n\"I wass telt to tell ye the'll be no kirk the day, for the minister's\ngot to preach at Drumquaich.\"\n\n\"Very well, Donald.  Have you had breakfast?\"\n\n\"Oo, ay.\"\n\n\"Go into the kitchen, then, and they will give you some more.\"\n\n\"Thenkee, sir.\"\n\n\"I find,\" said the laird on returning to his friends, \"that we are to\nhave no service to-day in our little church, as our minister has to take\nthe duty at Drumquaich, on the other side of the loch.  So those of you\nwho are bent on going to church must make up your minds to cross the\nloch in the boat.\"\n\n\"Is Drumquaich the little village close under the pine wood, that we see\non doubling Eagle Point?\" asked Mabberly.\n\n\"The same.  The little church there, like our own, is not supplied\nregularly.  Sometimes a Divinity student is sent down to them.\nOccasionally they have a great gun from Edinburgh.\"\n\n\"I think some of the students are better than the great guns,\" remarked\nMrs Gordon quietly.\n\n\"True, my dear, and that is most natural, for it stands to reason that\nsome at least of the students must be the great guns of the future in\nembryo; and they have the freshness of youth to set against the weight\nof erudition.\"\n\n\"The student who preached to us here last Sunday,\" observed Barret,\n\"must surely be an embryo great gun, for he treated his subject in a\nlearned and masterly way that amazed me.  From the look of him I would\nnot have expected even an average discourse.\"\n\n\"That was partly owing to his modest air and reticence,\" returned the\nlaird.  \"If you heard him converse on what he would call metapheesical\nsubjects, you would perhaps have been still more surprised.\"\n\n\"Well, I hope he will preach to-day,\" said Barret.\n\n\"From which I conclude that you will be one of the boat party.  My wife\nand Milly make three, myself four; who else?\"\n\n\"No--don't count me\" interrupted the hostess; \"I must stay with Flo;\nbesides, I must visit poor Mrs Donaldson, who is again laid up.  But\nI'll be glad if you will take Aggy Anderson.  Ever since the poor girl\ncame here for a little change of air she has been longing to go out in\nthe boat.  I really believe it is a natural craving for the free, fresh\nbreezes of the sea.  May she go?\"\n\n\"By all means; as many as the boat will hold,\" returned the laird.\n\nIt was finally arranged that, besides those already mentioned, Mabberly,\nJackman, MacRummle, Quin, the three boys, Roderick the groom, and Ian\nAnderson, as boatman in charge, should cross over to the little church\nat Drumquaich, about eight miles distant by water.\n\nWhile they were getting ready, Mrs Gordon and Flo, with the beloved\nblack dolly, paid a visit to old Molly, the keeper's mother.  They found\nher in her arm-chair, sitting by the large, open chimney, on the hearth\nof which a very small fire was burning--not for the sake of warmth, but\nfor the boiling of an iron pot which hung over it.\n\nThe old woman was enveloped in a large, warm shawl--a gift from the\n\"Hoose.\"  She also wore a close-fitting white cap, or \"mutch,\" which was\nsecured to her head by a broad, black ribbon.  The rims of her\nspectacles were of tortoiseshell, and she had a huge family Bible on her\nknee, while her feet rested upon a three-legged stool.  She looked up\ninquiringly as her visitors entered.\n\n\"Why, Molly, I thought you were in bed.  They told me you were ill.\"\n\n\"Na, mem, I'm weel eneuch in body; it's the speerit that's ill.  And ye\nken why.\"\n\nShe spoke in a faint, quavering voice, for her old heart had been\ncrushed by her wayward, self-indulgent son, and a few tears rolled down\nher wrinkled cheeks; but she was too old and feeble to give way to\ndemonstrative grief.  Little Flo, whose heart was easily touched, went\nclose to the poor old woman, and looked up anxiously in her face.\n\n\"My bonny doo!  It's a pleasure to look at ye,\" said the old woman,\nlaying her hand on the child's head.\n\nMrs Gordon drew in a chair and sat down by her side.\n\n\"Tell me about it,\" she said confidentially; \"has he given way again,\nafter all his promises to Mr Jackman?\"\n\n\"Oo, ay; Maister Jackman's a fine man, but he canna change the hert o'\nmy son--though it is kind o' him to try.  No, the only consolation I hev\nis here.\"\n\nShe laid her hand on the open Bible.\n\n\"Where is he just now?\" asked the lady.\n\nAs she spoke, a fierce yell was heard issuing from the keeper's cottage,\nwhich, as we have said, stood close to his mother's abode.\n\n\"Ye hear till 'im,\" said the old woman with a sorrowful shake of the\nhead.  \"He iss fery pad the day.  Whiles he thinks that horrible craters\nare crawlin' ower him, an' whiles that fearful bogles are glowerin' at\nhim.  Sometimes he fancies that the foul fiend himsel' has gotten haud\no' him, an' then he screeches as ye hear.\"\n\n\"Would it do any good, Molly, if I were to go and speak to him, think\nyou?\"\n\n\"Na, ye'd better let him lie.  He's no' hissel' the now, and there's no\nsayin' what he might do.  Oh! drink! drink!\" cried the old creature,\nclasping her hands; \"ye took my man awa', an' now ye're ruinin' my son!\nBut,\" she added with sudden animation, \"we can pray for him; though it\niss not possible for you or Maister Jackman to change my bairn's hert,\nthe Lord can do it, for wi' Him `a' things are possible.'\"\n\nTo this Mrs Gordon gave a hearty assent.  Sitting still as she was,\nwith hand resting on the old woman's arm, she shut her eyes and prayed\nfervently for the salvation of the enslaved man.\n\nShe was still engaged in this act of worship when another shriek was\nheard.  At the same time the door of the keeper's cottage was heard to\nopen, and Ivor's feet were heard staggering towards his mother's\ncottage.  Poor Flo took refuge in great alarm behind Mrs Donaldson,\nwhile her mother, rising quickly, drew back a few paces.\n\nNext moment the small door was burst open, and the keeper plunged,\nalmost fell, into the room with something like a savage cheer.  He was a\nterrible sight.  With wildly dishevelled hair, bloodshot eyes, and\ndistorted features, he stood for a few seconds glaring at his mother;\nhis tall figure swaying to and fro, while he held a quart bottle aloft\nin his right hand.  He did not appear to observe the visitors, but\ncontinued to stare at his mother with an expression that perplexed her,\naccustomed though she was to his various moods.\n\n\"See, mother,\" he shouted fiercely, \"I have done wi' the accursed thing\nat last!\"\n\nHe dashed the bottle on the hearth with tremendous violence as he spoke,\nso that it vanished into minute fragments, while its contents spurted\nabout in all directions.  Happily very little of it went into the fire,\nelse the cottage would have been set ablaze.\n\nWith another wild laugh the man wheeled round, staggered out of the\ncottage, and went his way.\n\n\"You are not hurt, I trust?\" said the lady, anxiously bending down over\nthe poor old creature, who had remained calmly seated in her chair,\nwithout the slightest appearance of alarm.\n\n\"No, I'm not hurt, thank the Lord,\" she answered.\n\n\"Don't you think that that was an answer to our prayer?\" asked the lady\nwith some eagerness.\n\nOld Molly shook her head dubiously.  \"It may be so,\" she replied; \"but I\nhev often seen 'im i' that mind, and he has gone back to it again and\nagain, like the soo that was washed, to her wallowin' i' the mire.  Yet\nthere did seem somethin' different aboot 'im the day,\" she added\nthoughtfully; \"but it iss not the first time I hev prayed for him\nwithout gettin' an answer.\"\n\n\"Answers do not always come as we expect them,\" returned her visitor;\n\"yet they may be granted even while we are asking.  I don't know how it\nis, but I feel sure that Jesus will save your son.\"\n\nPoor little Flo, who had been deeply affected by the terrible appearance\nof her favourite Ivor, and who had never seen him in such a plight\nbefore, quietly slipped out of old Molly's hut and went straight to that\nof the keeper.  She found him seated on a chair with his elbows on his\nknees, his forehead resting on his hands, and his strong fingers\ngrasping his hair as if about to tear it out by the roots.  Flo, who was\nnaturally fearless and trustful, ran straight to him and placed a hand\non his shoulder.  He started and looked round.\n\n\"Bairn! bairn!\" he said grasping her little head, and kissing her\nforehead, \"what brings ye here?\"\n\n\"Muzzer says she is _sure_ Jesus will save you; so I came to tell you,\nfor muzzer _never_ says what's not true.\"\n\nHaving delivered her consoling message, Flo ran back at once to Molly's\ncottage with the cheerful remark that it was all right now, for she had\ntold Ivor that he was going to be saved!\n\nWhile Mrs Gordon and Flo were thus engaged on shore, the boat party\nwere rowing swiftly down the loch to the little hamlet of Drumquaich.\nThe weather was magnificent.  Not a breath of air stirred the surface of\nthe sea, so that every little white cloud in the sky was perfectly\nreproduced in the concave below.  The gulls that floated on the white\nexpanse seemed each to be resting on its own inverted image, and the\nboat would have appeared in similar aspect but for the shivering of the\nmirror by its oars.\n\n\"Most appropriate type of Sabbath rest,\" said Jackman.\n\n\"Ay, but like all things here pelow,\" remarked Ian Anderson, who\npossessed in a high degree the faculty of disputation, \"it's not likely\nto last long.\"\n\n\"What makes you think so, Ian?\" asked Milly, who sat in the stern of the\nboat between John Barret and Aggy Anderson.\n\n\"Well, you see, muss,\" began Ian, in his slow, nasal tone, \"the gless\nhas bin fallin' for some time past, an'--Tonal', poy, mind your helm;\nsee where you're steerin' to!\"\n\nDonald, who steered, was watching with profound interest the operations\nof Junkie, who had slily and gravely fastened a piece of twine to a back\nbutton of MacRummle's coat, and tied him to the thwart on which he sat.\nBeing thus sternly asked where he was steering to, Donald replied, \"Oo,\nay,\" and quickly corrected the course.\n\n\"But surely,\" returned Milly, \"there is no sign of a rapid change, at\nleast if we may judge from the aspect of Nature; and I am a fervent\nbeliever in Nature, whatever the glass may predict.\"\n\n\"I am not sure o' that, muss,\" said Ian.  \"You needn't pull quite so\nhard, Muster Mabberly; we hev plenty o' time.  Tak it easy.  Well, as I\nwass sayin', muss, I hev seen it as calm as this i' the mornin' mony a\ntime, an' plowin' a gale at nicht.\"\n\n\"Let us hope that that won't be our experience to-day,\" said the laird.\n\"Anyhow, we have a good sea-boat under us.\"\n\n\"Weel, the poat's no' a pad wan, laird, but I hev seen petter.  You see,\nwhen the wund iss richt astern, she iss given to trinkin'.\"\n\n\"That's like Ivor,\" said Junkie with a laugh; \"only _he_ is given to\ndrinkin', no matter how the wind blows.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Milly, much perplexed.\n\nBarret here explained that a boat which takes in much water over the bow\nis said to be given to drinking.\n\n\"I'm inclined that way myself,\" said Jackman, who had been pulling hard\nat one of the oars up to that time.\n\n\"Has any one thought of bringing a bottle of water?\"\n\n\"Here's a bottle,\" cried MacRummle, laughing.\n\n\"Ah, sure, an' there seems to be a bottle o' milk, or somethin' white\nunder the th'ort,\" remarked Quin, who pulled the bow oar.\n\n\"But that's Milly's bottle of milk,\" shouted Junkie.\n\n\"And Aggy's,\" chimed in Eddie.\n\n\"Yes--no one must touch that,\" said Junkie.\n\n\"Quite right, boys,\" said Jackman; \"besides, milk is not good for\nquenching thirst.\"\n\nOn search being made, it was found that water had not been brought with\nthem, so that the thirsty rowers had to rest content without it.\n\n\"Is that Eagle Cliff I see, just over the knoll there?\" asked Barret.\n\n\"It is,\" answered the laird; \"don't you see the eagle himself like a\nblack speck hovering above it?  My shepherd would gladly see the bird\nkilled, for he and his wife make sad havoc among the lambs sometimes;\nbut I can't say that I sympathise with the shepherd.  An eagle is a\nnoble bird, and there are none too many of them now in this country.\"\n\n\"I agree with you heartily,\" said Barret; \"and I would regard the man\nwho should kill that eagle as little better than a murderer.\"\n\n\"_Quite_ as bad as a murderer!\" said Milly with energy.  \"I am glad you\nspeak out so clearly, Mr Barret; for I fear there are some among us who\nwould not hesitate to shoot if the poor bird were to come within range.\"\n\n\"Pray don't look so pointedly at me, Miss Moss,\" said Jackman; \"I assure\nyou I have no intention of attempting murder--at least not in that\ndirection.\"\n\n\"Och! an' it's murder enough you've done already for wan man,\" said Quin\nin an undertone.\n\n\"Oh!  I say, that reminds me.  Do tell us the rest of the story of the\nelephant hunt, Mr Jackman,\" cried Junkie.\n\n\"Not just now, my boy.  It's a long story.  Besides, we are on our way\nto church!  Some other time I will tell it you.\"\n\n\"It would take half the romance away from my mother's visit if the eagle\nwere killed,\" remarked Milly, who did not overhear the elephant\nparenthesis.\n\n\"Has your mother, then, decided to come?\" asked Barret.\n\n\"Yes.  In spite of the sea, which she dreads, and steamers, which she\nhates, she has made up her mind to come and take me home.\"\n\n\"How charming that will be!\" said Barret.\n\n\"Indeed!\" returned Milly, with a significant look and smile.\n\n\"Of _course_ I did not mean that,\" returned Barret, laughing.  \"I meant\nthat it would be charming for you to have your mother out here, and to\nreturn home in her company.  Is she likely to stay long?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell.  That depends on so many things.  But I am sure of one\nthing, that she longs to see and thank you for the great service you\nrendered me on the day of your arrival here.\"\n\nBarret began to protest that the service was a comparatively small one,\nand such as any man might gladly render to any one, when the arrival of\nthe boat at the landing-place cut him short.\n\nAbout thirty or forty people had assembled from the surrounding\ndistricts, some of whom had come four or even six miles to attend\nchurch.  They formed a quiet, grave, orderly company of men and women in\nhomespun garments, with only a few children among them.  The arrival of\nthe laird's party made a very considerable addition to the congregation,\nand, as the hour for meeting had already passed by a few minutes, they\nmade a general move towards the church.\n\nThe building was wonderfully small, and in the most severely simple\nstyle of architecture, being merely an oblong structure of grey stone,\nwith small square windows, and a belfry at one end of the roof.  It\nmight have been mistaken for a cottage but for this, and the door being\nprotected by a small porch, and placed at one end of the structure,\ninstead of at the side.\n\nA few of the younger men remained outside in conversation, awaiting the\nadvent of the minister.  After a time, however, these dropped in and\ntook their seats, and people began to wonder why the minister was so\nlate.  Presently a boy with bare legs and a kilt entered the church and\nwhispered to a very old man, who turned out to be an elder.  Having\nheard the boy's message, the elder crossed over to the pew in which the\nlaird was seated and whispered to him, not so low, however, as to\nprevent Giles Jackman from hearing all that passed.  The minister's\nhorse had fallen, he said, and bruised the minister's legs so that he\ncould not officiate.\n\n\"Very awkward,\" returned the laird, knitting his brows.  \"What's to be\ndone?  It seems absurd that so many of us should assemble here just to\nlook solemn for a few minutes and then go home.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, it iss akward,\" said the elder.  \"Could you not gif us a\ndiscoorse yoursel', sir, from the prezenter's dask?\"\n\nThe latter part of the proposition was to guard himself from the\nimputation of having asked the laird to mount the _pulpit_.\n\n\"Me preach!\" exclaimed the laird; \"I never did such a thing in my life.\"\n\n\"Maype you'll read a chapter, what-e-ver,\" persisted the elder.\n\n\"Impossible!  I never read a chapter since I was born--in public, I\nmean, of course.  But why not do it yourself, man?\"\n\n\"So I would, sir, but my throat'll not stand it.\"\n\n\"Is there no other elder who could do it?\"\n\n\"Not wan, sir.  I'm afraid we will hev to dismiss the congregation.\"\n\nAt this point, to the laird's relief and no little surprise, Jackman\nleaned forward, and said in a low voice, \"If you have no objection, I\nwill undertake to conduct the service.\"\n\nThe elder gave the laird a look which, if it had been translated into\nwords, would probably have conveyed the idea--\"Is he orthodox?\"\n\n\"By all means, Mr Jackman,\" said the laird; \"you will be doing us a\ngreat favour.\"\n\nAccordingly Jackman went quietly to the precentor's desk and mounted it,\nmuch to the surprise of its proper occupant, a man with a voice like a\nbrass trumpet, who thereupon took his seat on a chair below the desk.\n\nProfound was the interest of the congregation when they saw this\nbronzed, broad-shouldered, big-bearded young man pull a small Bible out\nof his pocket and begin to turn over the leaves.  And it was noted with\nadditional interest by several of the people that the Bible seemed to be\na well-worn one.  Looking up from it after a few minutes, during which\nit was observed that his eyes had been closed, Jackman said, in an easy,\nconversational tone, that quite took the people by surprise--\n\n\"Friends, it has been my lot in life to wander for some years in wild\nand distant lands, where ministers of the Gospel were few and far\nbetween, and where Christians were obliged to conduct the worship of God\nas best they could.  Your minister being unable to attend, owing to an\naccident, which I trust may not turn out to be serious, I shall attempt,\nwith the permission of your elder, to lead your thoughts Godward, in\ndependence on the Holy Spirit.  Let us pray.\"\n\nThe jealous ears of the rigorously orthodox heard him thus far without\nbeing able to detect absolute heresy, though they were sensitively alive\nto the unusual style and very unclerical tone of the speaker's voice.\nThe same ears listened reverently to the prayer which followed, for it\nwas, after the pattern of the Lord's Prayer, almost startlingly short;\nstill it was very earnest, extremely simple, and, all things considered,\nundeniably orthodox.\n\nRelieved in their minds, therefore, the people prepared themselves for\nmore, and the precentor, with the brazen but tuneful voice, sang the\nfirst line of the psalm which the young preacher gave out--\"I to the\nhills will lift mine eyes\"--with rasping energy.  At the second line the\ncongregation joined in, and sang praise with reverent good-will, so\nthat, when a chapter of the Word had been read and another psalm sung,\nthey were brought to a state of hopeful expectancy.  The text still\nfurther pleased them, when, in a quiet voice, while turning over the\nleaves of the well-used Bible, Jackman said, \"In all thy ways\nacknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy paths.\"\n\nLaying down his little Bible, and looking at the people earnestly and in\nsilence for a few moments, the preacher said--\n\n\"I have travelled in Italy, France, Germany, Switzerland, and other\nplaces, and I never yet went in these countries without a guide-book.\nMore than that, never in all my experience have I seen men or women\ntravelling in these countries without a guide-book.  The travellers\nalways carried their guide-books in their hands, or in their pockets,\nand consulted them as they went along.  In the evenings, round the\ntables or on the sofas of the salons, they would sometimes sit poring\nover the pages of their guide-books, considering distances and the best\nroutes, and the cost of travelling and board.  Any man who would have\ntravelled without a guide-book, or who, having one, neglected to use it,\nwould have been considered weak-minded at the least.  Still further, I\nhave noted that such travellers _believed_ in their guide-books, and\nusually acted on the advice and directions therein given.\n\n\"But one journey I can tell of in which all this seems to be reversed--\nthe journey from earth towards heaven.  And here is our guide-book for\nthat journey,\" said the preacher, holding up the little Bible.  \"How do\nwe treat it?  I do not ask scoffers, who profess not to believe in the\nBible.  I ask those who _call themselves_ Christians, and who would be\nhighly offended if we ventured to doubt their Christianity.  Is it not\ntrue that many of us consult our Guide-book very much as a matter of\nform and habit, without much real belief that it will serve us in all\nthe minute details of life?  We all wish to get on in life.  The most\nobstinate and contradictory man on earth admits that.  Even if he denies\nit with his lips, all his actions prove that he admits it.  Well, what\nsays our Guide-book in regard to what is called `getting on'?  `In all\nthy ways acknowledge Him, and He will direct thy paths.'  Now, what\ncould be simpler--we might even say, what could be easier--than this?\nHim whom we have to acknowledge is defined in the previous verse as `the\nLord'--that is, Jesus, Immanuel, or God with us.\"\n\nFrom this point the sunburnt preacher diverged into illustration,\nleaning over the desk in a free-and-easy, confidential way, and\nthrilling his audience with incidents in his own adventurous career,\nwhich bore directly on the great truth that, as regards the Great End of\nlife, success and blessedness result from acknowledging the Lord, and\nthat failure and disaster inevitably await those who ignore Him.\n\nWhile Jackman proceeded with his discourse, the sky had become overcast,\ndark thunderclouds had been gathering in the nor'-east, rain had also\nbegun to descend; yet so intently were the people listening to this\nunusual style of preacher, that few of them observed the change until a\ndistant thunder-clap awoke them to it.\n\nQuietly, but promptly, Jackman drew his discourse to a close, and\nstepped out of the desk, remarking, in the very same voice with which he\nhad preached, that he feared he had kept them too long, and that he\nhoped none of the congregation had far to go.\n\n\"We hev that, sir,\" said the old elder, shaking him warmly by the hand;\n\"but we don't heed that, an' we are fery glad that we came, what-e-ver.\"\n\nAs the wind had also risen, and it seemed as if the weather was not\nlikely to improve, the laird hurried his party down to the boat.\nWaterproofs were put on, umbrellas were put up, the sails were hoisted,\nand the boat put off.\n\n\"I fear the sea is very rough,\" remarked Milly Moss, drawing close to\nAggy Anderson, so as to shelter her somewhat from the driving rain.\n\n\"Oo, ay; it iss a wee rough,\" assented Ian, who now took the helm; \"but\nwe wull soon rin ower.  Haud you the main sheet, Mr Mabberly, an' pe\nready to let co when I tell ye.  It iss a wee thing squally.\"\n\nIt was indeed a little more than a \"wee thing squally,\" for just then a\nvivid flash of lightning was seen to glitter among the distant crags of\nthe Eagle Cliff.  This was followed by a loud clap of thunder, which,\nleaping from cliff to crag, reverberated among the mountains with a\nsuccession of crashes that died away in ominous mutterings.  At the same\ntime a blue line towards the nor'-east indicated an approaching squall.\n\n\"Had we not better take in a reef, Ian?\" asked the laird anxiously.\n\n\"We had petter weather the pint first,\" said the boatman; \"efter that\nthe wund wul pe in oor favour, an'--but, ye're richt.  Tak in a reef,\nRoderick an' Tonal'.  Mind the sheet, Mr Mabberly, an' sit low in the\npoat, poys.\"\n\nThese orders were promptly obeyed, for the squall was rushing down the\nloch very rapidly.  When it burst on them the boat leaned over till her\nlee gunwale almost ran under water, but Ian was a skilful boatman, and\nmanaged to weather the point in safety.\n\nAfter that, as he had said, the wind was more favourable, enabling them\nto run before it.  Still, they were not out of danger, for a wide\nstretch of foaming sea lay between them and the shores of Kinlossie,\nwhile a gathering storm was darkening the sky behind them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWELVE.\n\nSTIRRING EVENTS OF MORE KINDS THAN ONE.\n\nThe squall which blew the Kinlossie boat round the Eagle Point was but\nthe precursor of a succession of heavy squalls which quickly changed\ninto a furious gale, compelling Ian Anderson to close reef his sails.\nEven when this was done, the boat rushed through the foaming water with\ntremendous velocity, and exhibited that tendency to drinking, to which\nreference has already been made; for every time she plunged into the\ntrough of the sea, a little water came over the bow.\n\nOf course, going as they were at such a rate, the traversing of six or\neight miles of water occupied but little time, and they were soon close\nto the bay, at the head of which Kinlossie House nestled among its\ntrees.\n\n\"Come aft, poys,\" shouted Ian, whose voice, strong though it was, could\nscarcely be heard in the bow owing to the roaring of the gale; \"she's\ntrinkin' too much; come aft, an' look sherp!\"\n\nThe three boys obeyed with alacrity, being well accustomed to boats, and\naware of the necessity of prompt obedience in circumstances of danger.\n\nThus lightened, the boat ceased drinking at the bow, but, being rather\noverweighted at the stern, she now and then took in a little water\nthere.\n\nUnfortunately the point of rocks which formed the southern end of\nKinlossie Bay obliged Ian to change his course a little in order to\nweather them.  This was a critical operation.  Even the girls had some\nsort of idea of that, as their looks bore witness.  John Barret felt a\nstrong inclination to slip his arm round Milly's waist and whisper,\n\"Don't be afraid, beloved, _I'll_ take care of you!\" but want of\ncourage--to say nothing of a sense of propriety--kept his lips silent\nand his arm still.\n\n\"Noo, keep stiddy, all of ye,\" said Ian, as he shifted the helm a\nlittle.\n\nAn irrepressible shriek burst from Aggy Anderson, for the boat lay over\nso much that the hissing water rippled almost into her, and seemed about\nto swallow them up.\n\n\"Tak anither haul o' the sheet, Maister Mabberly,\" cried Ian.\n\nAssisted by Jackman, Mabberly obeyed, and the boat went, as Quin said,\n\"snorin'\" past the rocks, which were now close under her lee, with the\nwaves bursting wildly over them.  Another minute and the outermost rock\nwas under their port bow.  To the eyes of the girls it seemed as if\ndestruction were inevitable.  To make matters worse, at that moment a\nvivid flash was succeeded by a loud thunder-clap, which, mingling with\nthe gale, seemed to intensify its fury, while a deluge of rain came\ndown.  But Ian knew what he was about.  With a firm hand on the tiller\nhe steered past the point, yet so closely that it seemed as if an active\nman might have leaped upon the outermost rock, which rose, black and\nsolid, amid the surging foam.\n\nAnother moment and the boat swept safely round into the bay, and was\nagain put before the wind.\n\n\"We're a' richt noo, what-e-ver,\" said Ian with a grunt of satisfaction.\n\nNever before did a self-sufficient boatman have his words more\neffectually or promptly falsified than on that occasion.  The distance\nbetween boat and shore at that moment was only a few hundred yards; but\nthe water all the way was deep, and the waves, in consequence, were\nlarge and wild.  There were great possibilities within the brief space\nof distance and time that lay before them!\n\n\"Tak an oar, Maister Quin, an' help Rodereek to fend off,\" cried the\nboatman.  \"Hold ticht to the sheet, sir, an' pe ready to let co the\nmoment I tell ye.  Are ye ready wi' the halyards, Muster Airchie?\"\n\n\"All right, Ian,\" replied the boy, who stood ready to lower the sail.\n\nThey could see that several men were standing on the beach, ready to\nrender assistance, among them Duncan, the butler, and Ivor, the\ngamekeeper.  The latter, who had evidently recovered himself, was\nstanding waist-deep in the foam, as if anxious to grasp the boat when it\ngrounded.\n\n\"Ivor is unusually keen to help us to-day,\" remarked the laird, with a\npeculiar look; but no one was sufficiently disengaged to listen to or\nanswer him.\n\nAt that critical moment Junkie took it into his unaccountable head to\nscramble to the fore part of the boat, in order, as he said, to lend a\nhand with a rope.  On reaching the bow he stumbled; the boat plunged\nheavily, as if to accommodate him, and he went overboard with a suddenly\nchecked yell, that rose high and sharp above the roaring gale!\n\nOf course every man near him sprang to the side and made a wild grasp at\nhim.  The gunwale went down, the sea rushed in, and, in a space of time\nbrief as the lightning-flash, all the occupants of the boat were\nstruggling in the waves!\n\nA great cry arose from the shore, and Ivor, plunging into the surf, was\nseen to breast the billows with the force of a Hercules.  In the moment\nof upsetting, John Barret's cowardice and scruples vanished.  He seized\nMilly by the arm, and held her up when they rose from the plunge.\n\nAnd now, for the first time in his life, our hero found the advantage of\nhaving trained himself, not only in all manly exercises, but in the\nnoble art of rescuing life from the water.  Instead of rising to the\nwild discovery of helpless ignorance, as to what was the best way of\nusing his great strength, he rose with the comfortable knowledge, first,\nthat he was a powerful swimmer, and second, that he knew exactly what to\ndo--at least to attempt.  Instead, therefore, of allowing himself to be\nhugged, and probably drowned, by the girl he loved, he held her off at\narm's length until he managed to grasp her by both arms close to the\nshoulders, and with her back towards him--treading water while doing so.\nThen, swimming on his own back, he gently drew her upon his breast, so\nthat her head rested close to his chin.  Thus the girl's face was turned\nupwards and held well out of the water, and the youth was able to say\nalmost in her ear, \"Trust in God, dearest, He will save us!\" while he\nstruck out vigorously with his legs.  Thus, swimming on his back, he\nheaded for the shore.\n\nLest the reader should fancy that we are here merely inventing a mode of\naction, it may be well to state that we have conversed with a man styled\n\"the Rescue,\" whose duty it was to watch the boys of Aberdeen while\nbathing on the dangerous coast there, and who told us that he had saved\nsome hundreds of lives--many of them in the manner above described.\n\nEvery one in the boat was fortunately able to swim, more or less, except\nMilly and Aggie Anderson.  With the utmost anxiety to save the latter,\nher Uncle Ian made a desperate plunge when the boat upset, at the spot\nwhere, in the confusion, he thought he saw her go down.  He grasped\nsomething under water, which clutched him violently in return.  Rising\nto the surface he found that he had got hold of Giles Jackman, who,\nanimated by the same desire to rescue the same girl, had also made a\nplunge at her.  Flinging each other off almost angrily, they swam wildly\nabout in search of her, for Giles had observed that Barret was\nsufficiently intent on Milly.\n\nBut poor Aggie was in even better hands.  Ivor Donaldson had kept his\neyes on her from the moment that he could distinguish faces in the\napproaching boat.  He was a splendid swimmer.  Even against wind and\nwaves he made rapid headway, and in a few seconds caught the girl by the\nhair.  In his case the absence of a plan of rescue was to some extent\nremedied by sheer strength of body, coupled with determination.  The\npoor girl did her best to choke him, as drowning people will, but,\nhappily, she was too weak for the purpose and he too strong!  He\nsuffered her to do her worst, and, with the arm which she left free made\nhis way gallantly to the beach, where Duncan and all the domestics were\nready to receive them.\n\nBarret and Milly had landed just before them.  Immediately after Archie\nand Eddie were swept in amid the foam, and Junkie himself--who, like his\nbrothers, could swim like a cork--came careering in on the top of a\nwave, like a very water-imp!  With all the energy of his nature he\nturned, the moment his feet touched ground, to lend a hand to his friend\nTonal', who was not far behind him.\n\nThus, one by one, the whole party got safely to land, for the laird,\nalthough old, was still vigorous, and, like the others, able to swim.\nMacRummle came in last, and they had some difficulty in getting him out\nof the water, for he was rather sluggish, as well as heavy; but he was\nnone the worse for his immersion, and to the anxieties afterwards\nexpressed by his friends, he replied quietly that he had become pretty\nwell used to the water by that time.  It was a trying experience,\nhowever, for all of them, and, in the opinion of Ian Anderson, as he\ngave it to his wife when they met, \"it was a queer way o' feenishin' off\na fery extraor'nar Sawbath tay--what-e-ver!\"\n\nOne morning, not long after this incident, the gentlemen made up a\nshooting party to try the summit of the hill for mountain hares--their\nhostess having twitted them with their inability to keep the household\nsupplied with hare soup.\n\n\"I will accompany you, gentlemen, to the shoulder of the first hill,\"\nobserved their host, as he finished his breakfast, \"but not farther, for\nI am not so young as I once was, and cannot be expected to keep pace\nwith a `Woods and Forester.'\"\n\n\"That is not a good reason for your stopping short, laird,\" retorted\nJackman, with a smile, \"because it is quite possible for the `Woods and\nForester' to regulate his pace to that of the Western Isles.\"\n\n\"Well, we shall see,\" returned his host.  \"And what does my reckless\nMilly intend to do with herself?\"\n\n\"I mean to have a little picnic--all by myself,\" said Milly; \"that is to\nsay with nobody but me and Aggy Anderson.\"\n\n\"D'you think that quite safe, so soon after her ducking?\" asked Mrs\nGordon.\n\n\"Quite safe, auntie, for she has not felt a bit the worse for that\nducking; indeed, she seems much the better for it, and I am quite sure\nthat hill air is good for her.\"\n\n\"Oh! then, you mean to have your very select picnic on the hills?\" said\nthe laird.\n\n\"Yes, but no one shall know to what part we are going, for, as I have\nsaid, we mean to have a day of it all to ourselves; only we will take\nJunkie to protect us, and carry our provisions.\"\n\nThere were two of the gentlemen who declined the shooting expedition.\nJohn Barret said he would start with them, but would at a certain point\ndrop behind and botanise.  MacRummle also preferred to make _one more_\neffort to catch that grilse which had risen so often to him of late, but\nwas still at large in the big pool under the fall.  The result of the\nmorning's discussion was that only Mabberly and Jackman proceeded to\nassault the hares on the mountain-top, accompanied by Archie and Eddie,\nwith Ivor Donaldson to guide them.\n\nUp in the nursery--that devastated region which suggested the idea of an\nhospital for broken furniture and toys--poor little neglected Flo sat\ndown on the floor, and, propping her favourite doll up against the\nremnant of a drum, asked that sable friend what she would like to do.\nReceiving no answer, she said, in a cheery, confidential tone, which she\nhad acquired from her mother, \"I'll tell you what, Miss Blackie, you an'\nI will go for a picnic too.  Zere's plenty places for you an' me, as\nwell as for Cuzn Miwy to go to, an' we will let muzzer go wid us--if\nshe's dood.  So go, like a dood chile', an' get your things on.\"\n\nAs the day was particularly bright and warm, this minor picnic was\nsplendidly carried into effect, in a little coppice close to the house.\nThere Mrs Gordon knitted and sometimes read, and behaved altogether\nlike a particularly \"dood chile,\" while Flo and Blackie carried on high\njinks around her.\n\nThe Eagle Cliff was the spot which Milly Moss had fixed on for her\nselect little picnic with the niece of the fisherman.  Strange to say,\nand without the slightest knowledge or suspicion of this fact (so he\nsaid), John Barret had selected the very same spot for his botanical\nramble.  It must be remembered, however, that it was a wide spot.\n\nSeated in a secluded nook, not long after noon, Milly and Aggy, with\nJunkie, enjoyed the good things which were spread on a mass of flat rock\nin front of them.\n\n\"Now I call this jolly!\" said Junkie, as well as he could, with a mass\nof jam-tart stopping the way.\n\n\"It is indeed,\" returned Milly; \"but I don't feel quite sure whether you\nrefer to the splendour of the scenery or the goodness of the tart.\"\n\n\"To both,\" returned the boy, inarticulately.\n\n\"Do you think you could eat any more?\" asked Milly with a grave, earnest\nlook that made Aggy giggle--for Aggy was a facile giggler!\n\n\"No, I don't,\" said Junkie.  \"I'm stuffed!\"\n\n\"Well, then, you are at leisure to fill the cup again at the spring; so\nrun, like a good boy, and do it.\"\n\n\"How hard you are on a fellow, Cousin Milly,\" grumbled the youngster,\nrising to do as he was bid; but the expression of his jammy face showed\nthat he was no unwilling slave.\n\n\"How old are you, Aggy?\" asked Milly when he was gone.\n\n\"Sixteen last birthday,\" returned the girl.\n\n\"Ah! how I wish I was sixteen again!\" said Milly, with a profound sigh,\nas she gazed over the rim of a tartlet she happened to be eating, at the\nglittering sea and the far-off horizon.  She was evidently recalling\nsome very sad and ancient memories.\n\n\"Why?\" asked her companion, who exhibited a very slight tendency to\nlaugh.\n\n\"Because I was so light-hearted and happy at that age.\"\n\n\"How old are you now, Miss Milly?\" asked Aggy, in a tone of increased\nrespect.\n\n\"Nineteen,\" replied the other with a sigh.\n\nAgain Aggy's pretty round face was rippled by a suppressed giggle, and\nit is highly probable that she would have given way altogether if Junkie\nhad not returned at the moment and rescued her.\n\n\"Here's the water, Milly.  Now, Aggy, have you had enough?\"\n\n\"Yes, quite enough,\" laughed the highly convalescent invalid.\n\n\"Well, then, come along wi' me and I'll show you the place where Cousin\nMilly fell down.  You needn't come, Milly.  I want to show it to Aggy\nall by herself, an' we won't be long away.\"\n\n\"Very well, Junkie, as you please.  I daresay I shall manage to pass the\ntime pleasantly enough till you return.\"\n\nShe leant back on a thick heather bush as she spoke, and indulged\nherself in that most enjoyable and restful of occupations, on a bright\nwarm day, namely, looking straight up into the sunny sky and\ncontemplating the soft fleecy clouds that float there, changing their\nforms slowly but continually.\n\nNow it so happened that John Barret, in his botanical wanderings about\nthe Eagle Cliff, in quest of the \"rare specimens\" that Milly loved,\ndiscovered Milly herself!  This was not such a matter-of-course\ndiscovery as the reader may suppose, for the Eagle Cliff occupied a vast\nspace of the mountain-side, among the rugged ramparts and knolls of\nwhich several persons might have wandered for hours without much chance\nof observing each other, unless they were to shout or discharge the\necho-disturbing gun.\n\nWhether it was the mysterious attraction or the occult discernment of\nlove that drew him, we cannot tell, but certain it is that when Barret,\nstanding on the upper edge of the cliff, glanced from the eagle--which\nwas watching him suspiciously--downward to the base of the cliff, where\nthe sheep appeared like little buff spots on the green grass, his\nstartled eyes alighted on Milly, lying on her back, contemplating the\nheavens!\n\nAt that distance she might have been a mole or a rabbit, as far as\nregards Barret's power to discern her face or figure or occupation went;\nnevertheless, Barret knew at once that it was she, as his look and\ncolour instantly indicated.  There is something in such matters which we\ncannot understand, and, perhaps, had better not attempt to comprehend.\nIt is sufficient to say that the young man instantly forgot his\noccupation, and began to descend the cliff by break-neck routes in a way\nthat must have surprised--if not alarmed--the very eagle himself.  He\neven trod some exceedingly rare \"specimens\" under foot in his haste.  In\na few minutes he drew near to the spot where Milly lay.\n\nThen he suddenly stopped, for he remembered that she had that morning\nspoken of her picnic as a very private one; and was it not taking a\nbase, unwarrantable advantage of her, thus to intrude on her privacy?\nBut then--ah! how fatally, if not fortunately, that \"but then\" often\ncomes in to seal our fate--\"fix our flints,\" as backwoodsmen are fond of\nputting it!--but then, was not the opportunity unsought--quite\naccidental?  Would it not be utterly absurd, as well as disingenuous, to\npass her and pretend not to see her, with his botanical box full of her\nown favourite plants and flowers?\n\nLove is proverbially blind.  The argument was more than sufficient.  He\nshut his eyes, metaphorically, and rushed upon his fate.\n\nMilly heard him rushing--in reality, walking--and knew his step!\nAnother instance of the amazing--well--She started up in some confusion,\njust in time to appear as if engaged in viewing with interest the\nmajestic landscape spread out before her.  Swooping downwards, and\nhovering overhead on grand expanded pinions, the eagle seemed to watch\nwith keen interest the result of this meeting.\n\n\"Pardon this intrusion, Miss Moss.  I really did not know you were in\nthis neighbourhood till a few minutes ago,\" said Barret, sitting down on\nthe heather beside her.  \"I accidentally observed you, and I have been\nso very fortunate in finding rare plants this morning, that I thought I\nmight venture, just for a few minutes, to interrupt the privacy of your\npicnic.  See, here!\" he added, taking off the botanical box and opening\nit; \"just look at all this!\"\n\n\"It is _very_ kind of you to take so much trouble on my account, Mr\nBarret,\" said Milly, becoming deeply, almost too deeply-interested in\nthe plants.  \"And, oh, _what_ a splendid specimen of the heliographipod.\nMy dear mother will be so glad to get this, for she is quite as fond of\nbotany as I am.\"\n\n\"Indeed!  Do you expect her soon?\"\n\n\"Yes; her last letter leads me to expect her very soon now.\"\n\nMilly looked up as she said this, but there was an expression on\nBarret's face which induced her instantly to recur to scientific\nresearch.\n\nNow, good reader, if you think we are going further, and expect us\nrudely to draw aside the curtain here, and betray confidences, you are\nmistaken.  But there is no reason against--indeed, the development of\nour story supplies every reason in favour of--our taking note of certain\nfacts which bear indirectly on the subject before us.\n\nFar away on a shoulder of the mountain, which rose on the other side of\nthe valley, lying between it and the Eagle Cliff, a grey speck might\nhave been seen perched on a rock.  Even as the crow flies the distance\nwas so great that the unassisted human eye could not have distinguished\nwhat it was.  It might have been a grey cow, or a grew crow, or a grey\nrabbit, or a grey excrescence of the rock itself; but a telescope would\nhave revealed the fact that it was Allan Gordon, the laird of Kinlossie!\n\nSerenity was stamped on the old man's brow, for he was amiable by\nnature, and he had been rendered more amiable that morning by having had\na pleasant chat, while ascending the mountain, with Mabberly and\nJackman.  The latter he had begun facetiously to style the \"Woods and\nForester.\"  The shooting party had left him there, according to previous\narrangement, and the old gentleman had seated himself on the grey rock\nto rest and commune with nature for a short time, before beginning the\ndescent of the steep mountain path, and wending his way homeward.\n\nFrom his commanding point of observation the entire range of the Eagle\nCliff lay spread out before him, with the sea visible on the extreme of\neither hand.  The great valley lay between, with impassable gulfs and\ngorges caused by its wild torrents, and its level patches, strewn with\nthe fallen _debris_ of ages, out of which the larger masses of rock rose\nlike islands in a grey ocean; but these huge masses became almost\ninsignificant, owing to the overpowering impression of the cliff itself.\nFor some time the laird gazed at it in silent admiration.  Presently a\nsmile beamed on his countenance.\n\n\"Ha! my puss, is that you?\" he muttered, as he took a binocular\ntelescope from his pocket and adjusted it.  \"I guessed as much.  The\nEagle Cliff has powerful attractions for you, what with its grandeur and\nthe `rare plants' you are so mad about.  I _think_ it is _you_, though\nat such a distance I might easily mistake a sheep or a deer for you--\nand, after all, that would be no mistake, for you _are_ a dear!\"\n\nHe did not condescend to smile at his own mild little joke, as he\napplied the telescope to his eyes.\n\n\"Yes, I'm right--and very comfortable you seem too, though I can't make\nout your party.  Both Aggy and Junkie seem to have left you.  Perhaps\nthe rocks may hide them.  It's so far off that--hallo!\"\n\nA sudden frown clouded the laird's face as he gave vent to that hallo.\n\n\"The rascal!\" he muttered between his compressed lips.  \"He heard at\nbreakfast, as well as the rest of us, that Milly wanted no intruders.\nHumph!  I had given him credit for better taste than this implies.  Eh!\ncome, sir, this is quite inexcusable!\"\n\nThe laird became excited as he continued to gaze, and his indignation\ndeepened as he hastily wiped the glasses of the binocular.  Applying\nthem again to his eyes, his frown became still darker.\n\n\"For shame, you young scamp!\" he continued to mutter, \"taking advantage\nof your contemptible botany to bring your two heads together in a way\nthat Milly would never have permitted _but_ for that ridiculous science.\nHa! they've let the whole concern fall--serves 'em right--and--no!\ndropped it on purpose.  What!  Do you _dare_ to grip my niece's hand,\nand--and--she lets you!  Eh! your arm round--Stop!\" shouted the wrathful\nman, springing up and almost hurling his binocular at the unconscious\npair.  But his shout, although fifty times louder, would have failed to\ncross the valley.  Like his anger, it was unavailing.  Thrusting the\nglass into its case with a bang, he strode down the mountain-side in\nrampant fury, leaving the solemn eagle to watch the lovers as they\nplighted their troth under the mighty cliff.  Happily they brought the\nmomentous transaction to a close just before Junkie and the highly\nconvalescent Aggy Anderson re-appeared upon the scene.\n\nThat afternoon, before dinner, John Barret asked Mr Gordon to accord\nhim the pleasure of a private interview in the library.\n\n\"Certainly, sir,\" said the laird sternly; \"and all the more that I had\nvery much desired some private conversation with _you_.\"\n\nBarret was not a little surprised at the old man's tone and manner, but\ntook no notice of it, and went alone with him into the library, where he\nmade a full and frank confession of his love for Milly, and of his\nhaving proposed to her and been accepted--on condition that her mother\ndid not object.\n\n\"And now, Mr Gordon,\" added the youth, earnestly, \"I have come to\napologise to you, to ask your forgiveness, in fact, and to express my\nextreme regret at the precipitancy of my conduct.  It had been my full\nintention, I do assure you, to wait until I had Mrs Moss' sanction to\npay my addresses to her daughter, but a--a--sudden opportunity, which I\nhad not sought for or expected--for, of course, I knew nothing of the\nplace where the picnic was to be--this--this--opportunity, I say, took\nme by surprise, and threw me off my guard--and--and--in short, love--Oh!\n_you_ know well enough the power of love, Mr Gordon, and can make\nallowance for my acting precipitately!\"\n\nThe old gentleman was touched on a tenderer spot than the young man was\naware of when he made this appeal to his own experience, for, in days\ngone by, young Allan Gordon had himself acted precipitately.\n\nBut, although the appeal had touched him, he did not allow the fact to\nbe seen, nor did he interrupt the youth's confession.\n\n\"Observe, Mr Gordon,\" continued Barret, drawing himself up slightly,\n\"the only wrong-doing for which I ask pardon is undue haste.  My\nposition, financially and otherwise, entitles me to marry, and darling\nMilly has a right to accept whom she will.  If it be thought that she is\ntoo young and does not know her own mind, I am willing to wait.  If she\nwere to change her mind in the meantime, I would accept the inevitable--\nbut I have no fear of _that_!\"\n\nThe laird's features had been relaxing while the enthusiastic youth\nproceeded, but the last speech upset his gravity altogether.\n\n\"Well, well, Barret,\" he said, \"since you have condemned yourself for\nacting hastily, it would ill become your host to overwhelm you with\nreproaches, and to say truth, after what you have said, I hope that the\ncourse of true love will in your case run smooth.  But, my young\nfriend,\" he added, in more serious tones, \"I must strictly forbid any\nfurther reference to this with Milly, till her mother comes.  She is\nunder my care and, being responsible for her, I must see that nothing\nfurther takes place till I am able to hand her, and all her affairs,\nover to her mother.  I will explain this to Milly, and give her to\nunderstand that you will behave to her in all respects as you did before\nthe occurrence of this unfortunate picnic.  Meanwhile it may comfort you\nto know that her mother is already predisposed in your favour--naturally\ntoo, for she would be ungrateful, as well as eccentric, if she had no\nregard for the man who has twice saved her child's life.  Ah! there goes\nthe dinner-bell, and I'm glad of it, for prolonged speaking fatigues me.\nCome along.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN.\n\nA CHAPTER OF CATASTROPHES.\n\nIt was the very next day after the conversation in the library that the\nwaggonette was sent over to Cove to meet the steamer and fetch Mrs\nMoss, who was expected to arrive.  As Ian Anderson and Donald with the\nragged head had to return home that day, they were offered a lift by\ntheir friend Roderick.\n\n\"I wad raither waalk, Rodereek,\" said Ian; \"but I dar' say I may as weel\ntak a lift as far as the Cluff; chump up, Tonal'.\"\n\nDonald was not slow to obey.  Although active and vigorous as a mountain\ngoat, he had no objection to repose under agreeable conditions.\n\n\"What think ye o' the keeper _this_ time, Rodereek?\" asked the boatman\nas they drove away.\n\n\"Oo, it wull be the same as last time,\" answered the groom.  \"He'll haud\non for a while, an' then he wull co pack like the soo to her wallowin'\ni' the mire.\"\n\n\"I doubt ye're richt,\" returned Ian, with a solemn shake of the head.\n\"He's an unstiddy character, an' he hes naither the fear o' Cod nor man\npefore his eyes.  But he's a plees'nt man when he likes.\"\n\n\"Oo, ay, but there iss not in him the wull to give up the trink.  He hes\ngiven it up more than wance before, an' failed.  He will co from pad to\nworse in my opinion.  There iss no hope for him, I fear.\"\n\n\"Fery likely,\" and on the strength of that opinion Ian drew a flask from\nhis pocket, and the two cronies had what the groom called a \"tram\"\ntogether.\n\nFarther up the steep road they overtook John Barret and Giles Jackman,\nwho saluted them with pleasant platitudes about the weather as they\npassed.  Curiously enough, these two chanced to be conversing on the\nvery subject that had engaged the thoughts of Ian and the groom.\n\n\"They say this is not the first time that poor Ivor has dashed his\nbottle to pieces,\" said Barret.  \"I fear it has become a disease in this\ncase, and that he has lost the power of self-control.  From all I hear I\nhave little hope of him.  It is all the more sad that he seems to have\ngained the affections of that poor little girl, Aggy Anderson.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" exclaimed Giles, laughing; \"a fellow-feeling makes you\nwondrous sharp, I suppose, for I had not observed that interesting fact.\nBut why do you speak in such pitiful tones of Aggy?\"\n\n\"Because she is an invalid, and her lover is a drunkard.  Sufficient\nreasons, I should think.\"\n\n\"No, not quite, because she has almost recovered her usual health while\nhere, and poor Ivor is, after all, only one of the sinners for whom\nJesus Christ died.  I have great hopes of him.\"\n\n\"I'm glad to hear you say so, Jackman, though I don't see that the fact\nof our Saviour's dying for us all proves his case to be hopeful.  Are\nthere not hundreds of men of whom the same may be said, yet they are not\ndelivered from drunkenness, and don't seem likely to be?\"\n\n\"That is unquestionably true,\" rejoined his friend; \"but such men as you\nrefer to have not been brought to the condition of renouncing self, and\ntrusting _only_ in our Saviour.  They want to have some credit in the\nmatter of their own salvation--hence they fail.  Ivor, I have good\nreason to believe, _has_ been brought to that condition--a condition\nwhich insures success--hence my great hopes of him.  I became aware of\nhis state of mind, partly from having had a long talk with him the other\nday, and partly from the report of his good old mother.  She told me\nyesterday that Ivor had come to her, laid his hand on her shoulder, and\nsaid, `Mither, I've lost all hope o' mysel' noo,' to which the old woman\nanswered, `That's the best news I've heard for mony a day, my son, for\nnoo the Lord wull let ye see what He can do for ye.'  Ivor's reply to\nthat was, `I believe ye're richt, mither.'  Now I think that was a great\ndeal to come from two such undemonstrative Celts.\"\n\nAt this point in the conversation they reached a part of the road where\na footpath diverged down to the river, the road itself rising abruptly\ntowards the Eagle Cliff.\n\n\"We separate here,\" said Jackman.  \"I need scarcely ask where you are\ngoing, or what going to do!  Botany, coupled with inaccessible cliffs,\nseems to be your mania just now.  Oh!  John Barret, my friend, may I not\nwith truth, in your case, paraphrase a well-known couplet,--\n\n  \"Milly in the heart breeds Milly in the brain,\n  And this reciprocally that again?\"\n\n\"Your paraphrases are about equal to your compositions, Jackman, and, in\nsaying that, I don't compliment you.  Pray, may I ask why you have\nforsaken your favourite weapon, the gun, and taken to the rod to-day?\"\n\n\"Because of amiability--pure and simple.  You know I don't care a rush\nfor fishing, but, to my surprise, this morning MacRummle expressed a\nwish to try my repeating rifle at the rabbits, and offered to let me try\nhis rod, and--I might almost add--his river.  Wasn't it generous of him?\nSo I'm off to have a try for `that salmon,' and he is off no one knows\nwhere, to send the terrified rabbits into their holes.  Good-bye, old\nfellow--a pleasant day to you.\"\n\nLeft alone, Barret began to devote himself to the cliffs.  It was\narduous work, for the said cliffs were almost perpendicular, and plants\ngrew in such high-up crevices, and on such un-get-at-able places, that\nit seemed as if \"rare specimens\" knew their own value, as well as the\ngreat demand for them, and selected their habitations accordingly.\n\nIt was pleasant work, and our hero revelled in it!  To be in such\nexceptional circumstances, with the grand cliffs above and below him,\nwith no one near, save the lordly eagle himself, to watch his doings,\nwith the wild sweeps of mountain-land everywhere, clothed with bracken,\nheather, and birch, and backed by the island-studded sea; with the fresh\nair and the bright sun, and brawling burns, and bleating sheep, and the\nobjects of his favourite science around him, and the strong muscular\nframe and buoyant spirits that God had given to enable him to enjoy it\nall, was indeed enough to arouse a feeling of gratitude and enthusiasm;\nbut when, in addition to this, the young man knew that he was not merely\nbotanising on his own account, but working at it for Milly, he felt as\nthough he had all but attained to the topmost pinnacle of felicity!\n\nIt is sad to think that in human affairs this condition is not\nunfrequently the precursor of misfortune.  It is not necessarily so.\nHappily, it is not always so.  Indeed, we would fain hope that it is not\noften so, but it was so on this occasion.\n\nBarret had about half filled his botanical box with what he believed to\nbe an interesting collection of plants that would cause the eyes of\nMilly Moss to sparkle, when the position of the sun and internal\nsensations induced him to think of his midday meal.  It was tied up in a\nlittle square paper package.  There was a spring at the bottom of the\ncliffs.  It was near the stone where he had met Milly, and had given way\nto precipitancy.  Not far from the spot also where he had made Milly up\ninto a bundle, with a plaid, and started with her towards Kinlossie.  No\nplace could be better than that for his solitary luncheon.  He would go\nthere.\n\nDescending the cliffs, he gained the road, and was walking along towards\nthe selected spot, when the sound of wheels arrested him.  Looking up,\nhe saw the waggonette turn sharp round the projecting cliff, and\napproach him at a walk.  He experienced a little depression of spirit,\nfor there was no one in it, only the groom on the box.  Milly would be\nsorely disappointed!\n\n\"Mrs Moss has not come, I see,\" he said, as the groom reined up.\n\n\"Oo, ay, sir, she's come.  But she iss a queer leddy.  She's been\nchumpin' in an' oot o' the waginette a' the way up, like a whutret, to\nadmire the scenery, as she says.  When we cam' to the heed o' the pass\nshe chumped oot again, an' telt me to drive on slow, an wait at the futt\no' the first hull for her.  She's no far ahint.\"\n\n\"I'll go and meet her.  You can drive on, slowly.\"\n\nBarret hurried forward with feelings of considerable uncertainty as to\nwhether this chance of meeting his mother-in-law to be (he hoped!)\nalone, and in these peculiar circumstances, would be an advantage or\notherwise.  She might be annoyed by a sudden interruption in \"admiring\nthe scenery.\"  There would be the awkwardness of having to introduce\nhimself, and she might be fatigued after all her \"chumpin'\" in and out\nof the waggonette.\n\nHe was still pondering these points while he walked smartly forward,\nturned the projecting cliff above referred to, and all but overturned\nthe identical little old lady whom he had run down on his bicycle, weeks\nbefore, in London!\n\nTo say that these two drew back and gazed at each other intently--the\nlady quivering and pale, the youth aghast and red--is to give but a\nfeeble account of the situation.\n\n\"Young man,\" she said, indignantly, in a low, repressed voice, \"you have\na peculiar talent for assaulting ladies.\"\n\n\"Madam,\" explained the youth, growing desperate, \"you are right.  I\ncertainly have a talent--at least a misfortune--of that sort--\"\n\nHe stopped short, for, being quite overwhelmed, he knew not what to say.\n\n\"It is sad,\" continued the little old lady in a tone of contempt, \"that\na youth like you should so much belie your looks.  It was so mean of you\nto run away without a word of apology, just like a bad little boy, for\nfear of being scolded--not that I cared much for being run down with\nthat horrid bicycle, for I was not hurt--though I _might_ have been\nkilled--but it was the cowardly way in which you left me lying helpless\namong bakers, and sweeps, and policemen, and dirty boys.  Oh! it was\ndisgraceful.\"\n\nPoor Barret became more and more overwhelmed as she went on.\n\n\"Spare me, madam,\" he cried, in desperation.  \"Oh; if you only knew what\nI have suffered on your account since that unlucky day!  Believe me, it\nwas not cowardice--well, I cannot say that exactly--but it was not the\nfear of your just reproaches that made me fly.  It was the approach of\nthe police, and the fear of being taken up, and a public trial, and the\ndisgrace of--of--and--then I felt ashamed before I had fled more than a\nfew hundred yards, and I returned to the spot, but you were gone, and I\nhad no means of--of--\"\n\n\"That will do, young man.  There is no need to keep me standing in this\nwild place.  You are living somewhere in this neighbourhood, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes.  I am living in the neighbourhood,\" said Barret bitterly.\n\n\"Well, I am going to stay at Kinlossie House.  You know Kinlossie House,\nI suppose?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I know it.\"\n\n\"There is no occasion to look so fierce or bitter, young sir.  I am\ngoing to be at Kinlossie for some time.  If you choose to call there, I\nshall be ready to listen to your explanations and apologies, for I have\nno desire to appear either harsh or unforgiving.  Meanwhile, I wish you\ngood morning.\"\n\nSaying which, and with a sweeping bow of a rather antiquated style, the\noffended lady passed on.\n\nFor a considerable time Barret stood motionless, with folded arms,\n\"admiring the scenery\" with a stony stare.  A stone about the size of\nhis fist lay at his foot.  He suddenly kicked that violently into space.\nHad it been the size of his head, he would probably not have kicked it!\nThen he gave vent to a wild laugh, became suddenly grave, thrust his\nhands deep into his pockets, and walked up the road with clenched teeth\nand a deadly stride.\n\nMrs Moss heard the laugh as it echoed among the great cliffs.\n\n\"What a dreadful young man!\" she muttered, hurrying forward.\n\nShe thought of asking her driver who he was, but she had found Roderick\nto be a very taciturn Highlander.  He had not shown much disposition to\nconverse on the way up, and his speech had not been very intelligible to\nher English--or Anglicised--ears.  She re-entered the waggonette,\ntherefore, in silence.  Roderick drove on also in silence, although much\nsurprised that the \"young shentleman\" had not returned with the \"leddy.\"\nBut that was none of his business \"what-e-ver.\"\n\nAs the little old lady brooded over the matter, she resolved to say\nnothing of the meeting to Milly.  She happened to possess a spice of\nhumour, and thought it might be well to wait until the youth should\ncall, and then, after forgiveness sought and obtained, introduce him at\nKinlossie as the young man who ran her down in London!\n\nMeanwhile Barret walked himself into a better state of mind, clambered\nto a nook on the face of one of the cliffs, and sat down to meditate and\nconsider what was best to be done.\n\nAlthough he had not gone out that day to shoot, but to botanise, he\ncarried a light double-barrelled shot gun, in case he might get a chance\nat a hare, which was always acceptable to the lady of Kinlossie.\n\nWhile the incidents just described were being enacted at the base of the\nEagle Cliff higher up, on a distant part of the same cliff, MacRummle\nmight have been seen prowling among the grey rocks, with the spirit of\nNimrod, and the aspect of Bacchus.\n\nIt was the habit of MacRummle, being half blind, to supplement his\nvision with that peculiar kind of glasses which support--or refuse to\nsupport--themselves on the human countenance by means of the nose.\nThese, although admirably adapted for reading, and even for quietly\nfishing by the river-side, he found to be miserably unsuited for\nsporting among the cliffs, for they were continually tumbling off as he\nstumbled along, or were twitched off by his rifle when he was in the act\nof making false points.\n\nPerseverance was, however, the strong point in the old man's character--\nif it had a strong point at all.  He replaced the glasses perpetually,\nand kept pointing persistently.  He did little more than point, because\nthe thing that he pointed at, whatever it was, usually got out of the\nway before MacRummle obtained a reliable aim.  With a shot gun he might\nhave done better, for that weapon admits of snap-shooting, with some\nchance of success, even in feeble hands.  But the old man was ambitious.\nHis object was to \"pot\" something, as he expressed it, with a single\nball.  Of course it was not all pointing.  He did fire occasionally,\nwith no other result than awaking the echoes and terrifying the rabbits.\nBut the memory of his former success with the same weapon was strong\nupon him, and perseverance, as we have said, was rampant.  On the whole,\nthe fusillade that he kept up was considerable, much to the amusement of\nBarret (before meeting Mrs Moss!), who rightly guessed the cause of all\nthe noise.\n\nAbout midday, like Barret, he prepared to comfort himself with lunch,\nand, unlike our unfortunate hero, he enjoyed it in comfort, sitting on a\ngreen patch or terrace, high up near the summit of the cliffs, and a\nfull mile distant from the spot where the peculiar meeting took place.\n\nLike a giant refreshed MacRummle rose from lunch, a good deal more like\nBacchus, and much less like Nimrod.  A rabbit had been watching him from\nthe cliff above nearly all the time he was eating.  It moved quietly\ninto its burrow when he rose, though there was no occasion to do so,\nbecause, although within easy rifle shot, MacRummle did not see it.\nWhen the sportsman was past, the rabbit came out and looked after him.\n\nFixing his glasses firmly he advanced in that stooping posture, with the\nrifle at the \"ready,\" which is so characteristic of keen sportsmen!\nNext moment a rabbit stood before him--an easy shot.  It sat up on its\nhind legs even, as if inviting its fate, and gazed as though uncertain\nwhether the man was going to advance or not.  He did not advance, but\ntook a steady, deadly aim, and was on the point of pulling the trigger\nwhen the glasses dropped off.\n\nMacRummle was wonderfully patient.  He said nothing.  He merely replaced\nhis glasses and looked.  The rabbit was gone.  Several surrounding\nrabbits saw it go, but did not follow its example.  They evidently felt\nthemselves safe.\n\nProceeding cautiously onward, the sportsman again caught sight of one of\nthe multitude that surrounded him.  It was seated on the edge of its\nburrow, ready for retreat.  Alas! for that rabbit, if MacRummle had been\nan average shot, armed with a shot gun.  But it was ignorant, and with\nthe characteristic presumption of ignorance, it sat still.  The\nsportsman took a careful and long--very long--aim, and fired!  The\nrabbit's nose pointed to the world's centre, its tail to the sky, and\nwhen the smoke cleared away, it also was gone.\n\n\"Fallen into its hole!  Dead, I suppose,\" was the remark with which the\nsportsman sought to comfort himself.  A bullet-mark on a rock, however,\ntwo feet to the left of the hole, and about a foot too high, shook his\nfaith a little in this view.\n\nIt was impossible, however, that a man should expend so much ammunition\nin a region swarming with his particular prey without experiencing\nsomething in the shape of a fluke.  He did, after a time, get one shot\nwhich was effectual.  A young rabbit sat on the top of a mound looking\nat him with an air of impudence which is sometimes associated with\nextreme youth.  A fat old kinsman--or woman--was seated in a hollow some\ndistance farther on.  MacRummle fired at the young one, missed it, and\nshot the kinsman through the heart.  The disappointment of the old man\nwhen he failed to find the young one, and his joy on discovering the\nkinsman, we leave to the reader's imagination.\n\nThus he went on, occasionally securing something for the pot,\ncontinually alarming the whole rabbit fraternity, and disgusting the\neagle, which watched him from a safe distance in the ambient atmosphere\nabove.\n\nBy degrees he worked his way along till he came to the neighbourhood of\nthe place where poor John Barret sat in meditative dejection.  Although\nnear, however, the two friends could neither see nor get at each other,\nbeing separated by an impassable gulf--the one being in a crevice, as we\nhave said, not far from the foot of the cliff, the other hidden among\nthe crags near the summit.  Thus it came to pass that although Barret\nknew of MacRummle's position by his noise, the latter was quite ignorant\nof the presence of the former.\n\n\"This is horrible!\" muttered the youth in his crevice below.\n\n\"Now I call this charming!\" exclaimed the old man on his perch above.\n\nSuch is life--viewed from different standpoints!  Ay, and correctly\nestimated, too, according to these different standpoints; for the old\nman saw only the sunny surrounding of the Present, while the young one\ngazed into the gloomy wreck of the Future.\n\nBeing somewhat fatigued, MacRummle betook himself to a sequestered ledge\namong the cliffs, and sat down under a shrub to rest.  It chanced to be\na well concealed spot.  He remained quietly there for a considerable\ntime, discussing with himself the relative advantages of fishing and\nshooting.  It is probable that his sudden disappearance and his\nprolonged absence induced the eagle to imagine that he had gone away,\nfor that watchful bird, after several circlings on outstretched and\napparently motionless wings, made a magnificent swoop downwards, and\nagain resumed its floating action in the lower strata of its atmospheric\nworld.  There it devoted its exclusive attention to the young man, whose\nposition was clearly exposed to its view.\n\nAs he sat there in gloomy thought, Barret chanced to raise his eyes, and\nobserved the bird high above him--far out of gunshot.\n\n\"Fortunate creature!\" he said aloud; \"whatever may be the troubles of\nyour lot, you are at least safe from exasperating _rencontres_ with your\nfuture mother-in-law!\"\n\nWe need not point out to the intelligent reader that Barret, being quite\nignorant of the eagle's domestic relations, indulged in mere assumptions\nin the bitterness of his soul.\n\nHe raised his fowling-piece as he spoke, and took a long, deliberate aim\nat the bird.\n\n\"Far beyond range,\" he said, lowering the gun again; \"but even if you\nwere only four yards from the muzzle, I would not fire, poor bird!  Did\nnot Milly say you were noble, and that it would be worse than murder to\nkill you?  No, you are safe from me, at all events, even if you were not\nso wary as to keep yourself safe from everybody.  And yet, methinks, if\nMacRummle were still up there, he would have the chance of giving you a\nsevere fright, though he has not the skill to bring you down.\"\n\nNow it is well-known to trappers and backwoodsmen generally that the\nmost wary of foxes, which cannot by any means be caught by one trap, may\nsometimes be circumvented by two traps.  It is the same with decoys,\nwhether these be placed intentionally, or place themselves accidentally.\nOn this occasion Barret acted the part of a decoy, all unwittingly to\nthat eagle or to MacRummle.\n\nIn its extreme interest in the youth's proceedings the great bird soared\nstraight over his head, and slowly approached the old man's position.\nMacRummle was not on the alert.  He never was on the alert! but his eyes\nchanced to be gazing in the right direction, and his glasses happened to\nbe on.  He saw it coming--something big and black!  He grasped his\nrepeater and knocked his glasses off.\n\n\"A raven, I think!  I'll try it.  I should like it as a trophy--a sort\nof memorial of--\"\n\nBang!\n\nThe man who was half blind, who had scarcely used gun or rifle all his\nlife, achieved that which dead shots and ardent sportsmen had tried in\nvain for years--he shot the eagle right through the heart, and that,\ntoo, with a single bullet!\n\nStraight down it fell with a tremendous flutter, and disappeared over\nthe edge of its native cliff.\n\nMacRummle went on his knees, and, craning his neck, replaced his\nglasses; but nothing whatever could be seen, save the misty void below.\nShrinking back from the giddy position, he rose and pulled out his\nwatch.\n\n\"Let me see,\" he muttered, \"it will take me a full hour to go round so\nas to reach the bottom.  No; too late.  I'll go home, and send the\nkeeper for it in the morning.  The eagle may have picked its bones by\nthat time, to be sure; but after all, a raven is not much of a trophy.\"\n\nWhile he was thus debating, a very different scene was taking place\nbelow.\n\nBarret had been gazing up at the eagle when the shot was fired.  He saw\nthe spout of smoke.  He heard the crashing shot and echoes, and beheld\nthe eagle descending like a thunder-bolt.  After that he saw and heard\nno more, for, in reaching forward to see round a projecting rock that\ninterfered with his vision, his foot slipped, and he fell headlong from\nthe cliff.  He had not far to fall, indeed, and a whin bush broke the\nforce of the shock when he did strike; but he was rendered insensible,\nand rolled down the remainder of the slope to the bottom.  There he lay\nbruised, bleeding, and motionless on the grass, close to the road, with\nhis bent and broken gun beneath him, and the dead eagle not more than a\ndozen yards from his side!\n\n\"It is not like Barret to be late,\" observed the laird that evening, as\nhe consulted his watch.  \"He is punctuality itself, as a rule.  He must\nhave fallen in with some unusually interesting plants.  But we can't\nwait.  Order dinner, my dear, for I'm sure that my sister must be very\nhungry after her voyage.\"\n\n\"Indeed I am,\" returned the little old lady, with a peculiar smile.\n\"Sea-sickness is the best tonic I know of, but it is an awful medicine\nto take.\"\n\n\"Almost as good as mountain air,\" remarked MacRummle, as they filed out\nof the drawing-room.  \"I do wish I had managed to bring that raven\nhome.\"\n\nAt first the party at dinner was as merry as usual.  The sportsmen were\ngraphic in recounting the various incidents of the day; Mrs Moss was\nequally graphic on the horrors of the sea; MacRummle was eulogistic of\nrepeating rifles, and inclined to be boastful about the raven, which he\nhoped to show them on the morrow, while Milly proved herself, as usual,\na beautiful and interested listener, as well as a most hearty laugher.\n\nBut as the feast went on they became less noisy.  Then a feeling of\nuneasiness manifested itself, but no one ventured to suggest that\nanything might have occurred to the absentee until the evening had\ndeepened into night.  Then the laird started up suddenly.  \"Something\n_must_ have happened to our friend,\" he exclaimed, at the same time\nringing the bell violently.  \"He has never been late before, and however\nfar he may have gone a-field, there has been more than time for him to\nreturn at his slowest pace.  Duncan,\" (as the butler entered), \"turn out\nall the men and boys as fast as you can.  Tell Roderick to get lanterns\nready--as many as you have.  Gentlemen, we must all go on this search\nwithout another moment's delay!\"\n\nThere is little need to say that Barret's friends and comrades were not\nslow to respond to the call.  In less than a quarter of an hour they\nwere dispersed, searching every part of the Eagle Cliff, where he had\nbeen last seen by Giles Jackman.\n\nThey found him at last, pale and blood-stained, making ineffectual\nefforts to crawl from the spot where he had fallen, both the eagle and\nthe broken gun being found beside him.\n\n\"No bones broken, thank God!\" said Giles, after having examined him and\nbound up his wounds.  \"But he is too weak to be questioned.  Now, lads,\nfetch the two poles and the plaid.  I'll soon contrive a litter.\"\n\n\"All right, old fellow!  God bless you!\" said Barret, faintly, as his\nfriend bent over him.\n\nRoderick and Ivor raised him softly, and, with the eagle at his side,\nbore him towards Kinlossie House.  Soon after, their heavy tramp was\nheard in the hall as they carried him to his room, and laid him gently\nin bed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN.\n\nSUSPICIONS, REVELATIONS, AND OTHER MATTERS.\n\nWith a swelled and scratched face, a discoloured eye, a damaged nose,\nand a head swathed in bandages--it is no wonder that Mrs Moss failed to\nrecognise in John Barret the violent young man with the talent for\nassaulting ladies!\n\nShe was not admitted to his room until nearly a week after the accident,\nfor, although he had not been seriously injured, he had received a\nrather severe shock, and it was thought advisable to keep him quiet as a\nmatter of precaution.  When she did see him at last, lying on a sofa in\na dressing-gown, and with his head and face as we have described, his\nappearance did not call to her remembrance the faintest resemblance to\nthe confused, wild, and altogether incomprehensible youth, who had\ntumbled her over in the streets of London, and almost run her down in\nthe Eagle Pass.\n\nOf course Barret feared that she would recognise him, and had been\ngreatly exercised as to his precise duty in the circumstances; but when\nhe found that she did not recognise either his face or his voice, he\nfelt uncertain whether it would not be, perhaps, better to say nothing\nat all about the matter in the meantime.  Indeed, the grateful old lady\ngave him no time to make a \"clean breast of it,\" as he had at first\nintended to do.\n\n\"Oh!  Mr Barret,\" she exclaimed, sitting down beside him, and laying\nher hand lightly on his arm, while the laird sat down on another chair\nand looked on benignly, \"I cannot tell you how thankful I am that you\nhave not been killed, and how very grateful I am to you for all your\nbravery in saving my darling Milly's life.  Now, don't say a word about\ndisclaiming credit, as I know you are going to do--\"\n\n\"But, dear madam,\" interrupted the invalid, \"allow me to explain.  I\ncannot bear to deceive you, or to sail under false colours--\"\n\n\"Sail under false colours!  Explain!\" repeated Mrs Moss, quickly.\n\"What nonsense do you talk?  Has not my daughter explained, and _she_ is\nnot given to colouring things falsely.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, Mrs Moss,\" said Barret; \"I did not mean that.  I only--\"\n\n\"I don't care what you mean, Mr Barret,\" said the positive little\nwoman; \"it's of no use your denying that you have behaved in a noble,\ncourageous manner, and I won't listen to anything to the contrary; so\nyou need not interrupt me.  Besides, I have been told not to allow you\nto speak much; so, sir, if I am to remain beside you at all, I must\nimpose silence.\"\n\nBarret sank back on his couch with a sigh, and resigned himself to his\nfate.\n\nSo much for the mother.  Later in the same day the daughter sat beside\nhis couch.  The laird was not present on that occasion.  They were\nalone.\n\n\"Milly,\" said the invalid, taking her small hand in his, \"have you\nmentioned it yet to your mother?\"\n\n\"Yes, John,\" replied Milly, blushing in spite of--nay, rather more in\nconsequence of--her efforts not to do so.  \"I spoke to her some days\nago.  Indeed, soon after the accident, when we were sure you were going\nto get well.  And she did not disapprove.\"\n\n\"Ay, but have you spoken since she has seen me--since this morning?\"\n\n\"Yes, John.\"\n\n\"And she is still of the same mind--not shocked or shaken by my\nappearance?\"\n\n\"She is still of the same mind,\" returned Milly; \"and not shocked in the\nleast.  My darling mother is far too wise to be shocked by trifles--I--I\nmean by scratches and bruises.  She judges of people by their hearts.\"\n\n\"I'm glad to hear that, Milly, for I have something shocking to tell her\nabout myself, that will surprise her, if it does nothing else.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said Milly, with the slightest possible rise of her pretty\neyebrows.\n\n\"Yes.  You have heard from your mother about that young rascal who ran\ninto her with his bicycle in London some time ago?\"\n\n\"Yes; she wrote to me about it,\" replied Milly, with an amused smile.\n\"You mean, I suppose, the reckless youth who, after running her down,\nhad the cowardice to run away and leave her lying flat on the pavement?\nMother has more than once written about that event with indignation, and\nrightly, I think.  But how came you to know about it, John?\"\n\n\"Milly,\" said Barret, holding her hand very tight, and speaking\nsolemnly, \"_I am that cowardly man_!\"\n\n\"Now, John, you are jesting.\"\n\n\"Indeed--indeed I am not.\"\n\n\"Do you really mean to say that it was _you_ who ran against my--Oh! you\n_must_ be jesting!\"\n\n\"Again I say I am _not_.  I am the man--the coward.\"\n\n\"Well, dear John,\" said Milly, flushing considerably, \"I must believe\nyou; but the fact does not in the least reduce my affection for you,\nthough it will lower my belief in your prudence, unless you can\nexplain.\"\n\n\"I will explain,\" said Barret; and we need scarcely add that the\nexplanation tended rather to increase than diminish Milly's affection\nfor, as well as her belief in, her lover!  But when Barret went on\nfurther to describe the meeting in the Eagle Pass, she went off into\nuncontrollable laughter.\n\n\"And you are sure that mother has no idea that you are the man?\" she\nasked.\n\n\"Not the remotest.\"\n\n\"Well, now, John, you must not let her know for some time yet.  You must\ngain her affections, sir, before you venture to reveal your true\ncharacter.\"\n\nOf course Barret agreed to this.  He would have agreed to anything that\nMilly proposed, except, perhaps, the giving up of his claim to her own\nhand.  Deception, however, invariably surrounds the deceiver with more\nor less of difficulty.  That same evening, while Milly was sitting alone\nwith her mother, the conversation took a perplexing turn.\n\nThere had been a pretty long pause, after a rather favourable commentary\non the character of Barret, when the thin little old lady had wound up\nwith the observation that the subject of their criticism was a\nremarkably agreeable man, with a playfully humorous and a delightfully\nserious turn of mind--\"and _so_ modest\" withal!\n\nApparently the last words had turned her mind into the new channel, for\nshe resumed--\n\n\"Talking of insolence, my dear--\"\n\n\"_Were_ we talking of insolence, mother?\" said Milly, with a surprised\nsmile.\n\n\"Well, my love, I was thinking of the opposite of modesty, which is the\nsame thing.  Do you know, I had a meeting on the day of my arrival here\nwhich surprised me very much?  To say truth, I did not mention it\nsooner, because I wished to give you a little surprise.  Why do you\nchange your seat, my love?  Did you feel a draught where you were?\"\n\n\"No--no.  I--I only want to get the light a little more at my back--to\nkeep it off my face.  But go on, mother.  What was the surprise about?\nI'm anxious to know.\"\n\nIf Milly did not absolutely know, she had at least a pretty good idea of\nwhat was coming!\n\n\"Well, of course you remember about that young man--that--that\n_cowardly_ young man who--\"\n\n\"Who ran you down in London?  Yes, yes, _I_ know,\" interrupted the\ndaughter, endeavouring to suppress a laugh, and putting her handkerchief\nsuddenly to her face.  \"I remember well.  The monster!  What about him?\"\n\n\"You may well call him a monster!  Can you believe it?  I have met him\nhere--in this very island, where he must be living somewhere, of course;\nand he actually ran me down again--all _but_.\"  She added the last two\nwords in order to save her veracity.\n\n\"You don't really mean it?\" exclaimed Milly, giving way a little in\nspite of herself.  \"With a bicycle?\"\n\nIt was the mother's turn to laugh now.\n\n\"No, you foolish thing; even _I_ have capacity to understand that it\nwould be impossible to use those hideous--frightful instruments, on the\nbad hill-roads of this island.  No; but it seems to be the nature of\nthis dis-disagreeable--I had almost said detestable--youth, to move only\nunder violent impulse, for he came round a corner of the Eagle Cliff at\nsuch a pace that, as I have said, he _all but_ ran into my arms and\nknocked me down.\"\n\n\"Dreadful!\" exclaimed Milly, turning her back still more to the light\nand working mysteriously with her kerchief.\n\n\"Yes, dreadful indeed!  And when I naturally taxed him with his\ncowardice and meanness, he did not seem at all penitent, but went on\nlike a lunatic; and although what he said was civil enough, his way of\nsaying it was very impolite and strange; and after we had parted, I\nheard him give way to fiendish laughter.  I could not be mistaken, for\nthe cliffs echoed it in all directions like a hundred hyenas!\"\n\nAs this savoured somewhat of a joke, Milly availed herself of it, set\nfree the safety-valve, and, so to speak, saved the boiler!\n\n\"Why do you laugh so much, child?\" asked the old lady, when her daughter\nhad transgressed reasonable limits.\n\n\"Well, you know, mother, if you _will_ compare a man's laugh to a\nhundred hyenas--\"\n\n\"I didn't compare the man's voice,\" interrupted Mrs Moss; \"I said that\nthe cliffs--\"\n\n\"That's worse and worse!  Now, mother, don't get into one of your\nhypercritical moods, and insist on reasons for everything; but tell me\nabout this wicked--this dreadful young man.  What was he like?\"\n\n\"Like an ordinary sportsman, dear, with one of those hateful guns in his\nhand, and a botanical box on his back.  I could not see his face very\nwell, for he wore one of those ugly pot-caps, with a peak before and\nbehind; though what the behind one is for I cannot imagine, as men have\nno eyes in the back of their heads to keep the sun out of.  No doubt\nsome men would make us believe they have! but it was pulled down on the\nbridge of his nose.  What I did see of his face seemed to be handsome\nenough, and his figure was tall and well made, unquestionably, but his\nbehaviour--nothing can excuse that!  If he had only said he was sorry,\none might have forgiven him.\"\n\n\"Did he _not_ say he was sorry?\" asked Milly in some surprise.\n\n\"Oh, well, I suppose he did; and begged pardon after a fashion.  But\nwhat truth could there be in his protestations when he went away and\nlaughed like a hyena.\"\n\n\"You said a hundred hyenas, mother.\"\n\n\"No, Milly, I said the cliffs laughed; but don't interrupt me, you\nnaughty child!  Well, I was going to tell you that my heart softened a\nlittle towards the young man, for, as you know, I am not naturally\nunforgiving.\"\n\n\"I know it well, dear mother!\"\n\n\"So, before we parted, I told him that if he had any explanations or\napologies to make, I should be glad to see him at Kinlossie House.  Then\nI made up my mind to forgive him, and introduce him to you as the man\nthat ran me down in London!  This was the little surprise I had in store\nfor you, but the ungrateful creature has never come.\"\n\n\"No, and he never will come!\" said Milly, with a hearty laugh.\n\n\"How do you know that, puss?\" asked Mrs Moss, in surprise.\n\nFortunately the dinner-bell rang at that moment, justifying Milly in\njumping up.  Giving her mother a rather violent hug, she rushed from the\nroom.\n\n\"Strange girl!\" muttered Mrs Moss as she turned, and occupied herself\nwith some mysterious--we might almost say captious--operations before\nthe looking-glass.  \"The mountain air seems to have increased her\nspirits wonderfully.  Perhaps love has something to do with it!  It may\nbe both!\"\n\nShe was still engaged with a subtle analysis of this question--in front\nof the glass, which gave her the advantage of supposing that she talked\nwith an opponent--when sudden and uproarious laughter was heard in the\nadjoining room.  It was Barret's sitting-room, in which his friends were\nwont to visit him.  She could distinguish that the laughter proceeded\nfrom himself, Milly, and Giles Jackman, though the walls were too thick\nto permit of either words or ordinary tones being heard.\n\n\"Milly,\" said Mrs Moss, severely, when they met a few minutes later in\nthe drawing-room, \"what were you two and Mr Jackman laughing at so\nloudly?  Surely you did not tell them what we had been speaking about?\"\n\n\"Of course I did, mother.  I did not know you intended to keep the\nmatter secret.  And it did so tickle them!  But no one else knows it, so\nI will run back to John and pledge him to secrecy.  You can caution Mr\nJackman, who will be down directly, no doubt.\"\n\nAs Barret had not at that time recovered sufficiently to admit of his\ngoing downstairs, his friends were wont to spend much of their time in\nthe snug sitting-room which had been apportioned to him.  He usually\nheld his levees costumed in a huge flowered dressing-gown, belonging to\nthe laird, so that, although he began to look more like his former self,\nas he recovered from his injuries, he was still sufficiently disguised\nto prevent recognition on the part of Mrs Moss.\n\nNevertheless, the old lady felt strangely perplexed about him.\n\nOne day the greater part of the household was assembled in his room when\nMrs Moss remarked on this curious feeling.\n\n\"I cannot tell what it is, Mr Barret, that makes the sound of your\nvoice seem familiar to me,\" she said; \"yet not exactly familiar, but a\nsort of far-away echo, you know, such as one might have heard in a\ndream; though, after all, I don't think I ever did hear a voice in a\ndream.\"\n\nJackman and Milly glanced at each other, and the latter put the\nsafety-valve to her mouth while Barret replied--\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said, with a very grave appearance of profound\nthought, \"that I ever myself dreamt a voice, or, indeed, a sound of any\nkind.  As to what you say about some voices appearing to be familiar,\ndon't you think that has something to do with classes of men?  No man, I\nthink, is a solitary unit in creation.  Every man is, as it were, the\ntype of a class to which he belongs--each member possessing more or less\nthe complexion, tendencies, characteristics, tones, etcetera, of his\nparticular class.  You are familiar, it may be, with the tones of the\nclass to which I belong, and hence the idea that you have heard my voice\nbefore.\"\n\n\"Philosophically put, Barret,\" said Mabberly; \"I had no idea you thought\nso profoundly.\"\n\n\"H'm!  I'm not so sure of the profundity,\" said the little old lady,\npursing her lips; \"no doubt you may be right as regards class; but then,\nyoung man, I have been familiar with all classes of men, and therefore,\naccording to your principle, I should have some strange memories\nconnected with Mr Jackman's voice, and Mr Mabberly's, and the laird's,\nand everybody's.\"\n\n\"Well said, sister; you have him there!\" cried the laird with a guffaw;\n\"but don't lug me into your classes, for I claim to be an exception to\nall mankind, inasmuch as I have a sister who belongs to no class, and is\nready to tackle any man on any subject whatever, between metaphysics and\nbaby linen.  Come now, Barret, do you think yourself strong enough to go\nout with us in the boat to-morrow?\"\n\n\"Quite.  Indeed, I would have begged leave to go out some days ago, but\nDoctor Jackman there, who is a very stern practitioner, forbids me.\nHowever, I have my revenge, for I compel him to sit with me a great\ndeal, and entertain me with Indian stories.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Junkie, who happened to be in the room, \"he hasn't told\nyou yet about the elephant hunt, has he?\"\n\n\"No, not yet, Junkie,\" returned Barret; \"he has been faithful to his\npromise not to go on with that story till you and your brothers are\npresent.\"\n\n\"Well, but tell it now, Mr Jackman, and I'll go an call Eddie and\nArchie,\" pleaded the boy.\n\n\"You will call in vain, then,\" said his father, \"for they have both gone\nup the burn, one to photograph and the other to paint.  I never saw such\na boy as Archie is to photograph.  I believe he has got every scene in\nthe island worth having on his plates now, and he has taken to the\ncattle of late--What think ye was the last thing he tried?  I found him\nin the yard yesterday trying to photograph himself!\"\n\n\"That must indeed have puzzled him; how did he manage?\" asked MacRummle.\n\n\"Well, it was ingenious.  He tried to get Pat Quin to manipulate the\ninstrument while he sat; but Quin is clumsy with his fingers, at least\nfor such delicate work, and, the last time, he became nervous in his\nanxiety to do the thing rightly; so, when Archie cried `Now,' for him to\ncover the glass with its little cap, he put it on with a bang that\nknocked over and nearly smashed the whole concern.  So what does the boy\ndo but sets up a chair in the right focus and arranges the instrument\nwith a string tied to the little cap.  Then he sits down on the chair,\nputs on a heavenly smile, and pulls the string.  Off comes the cap!  He\ncounts one, two--I don't know how many--and then makes a sudden dash at\nthe camera an' shuts it up!  What the result may be remains to be seen.\"\n\n\"Oh, it'll be the same as usual,\" remarked Junkie in a tone of contempt.\n\"There's always something goes wrong in the middle of it.  He tried to\ntake Boxer the other day, and _he_ wagged his tail in the middle of it.\nThen he tried the cat, and she yawned in the middle.  Then Flo, and she\nlaughed in the middle.  Then me, an' I forgot, and made a face at Flo in\nthe middle.  It's a pity it has got a middle at all; two ends would be\nbetter, I think.  But won't you tell about the elephants to _us_, Mr\nJackman?  There's plenty of us here--please!\"\n\n\"Nay, Junkie; you would not have me break my word, surely.  When we are\nall assembled together you shall have it--some wet day, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Then there'll be no more wet days _this_ year, if I've to wait for\nthat,\" returned the urchin half sulkily.\n\nThat same day, Milly, Barret, and Jackman arranged that the mystery of\nthe cowardly young man must be cleared up.\n\n\"Perhaps it would be best for Miss Moss to explain to her mother,\" said\nGiles.\n\n\"That will not I,\" said Milly with a laugh.\n\n\"I have decided what to do,\" said Barret.  \"I was invited by her to call\nand explain anything I had to say, and apologise.  By looks, if not by\nwords, I accepted that invitation, and I shall keep it.  If you could\nonly manage somehow, Milly, to get everybody out of the way, so that I\nmight find your mother alone in--\"\n\n\"She's alone _now_,\" said Milly.  \"I left her just a minute ago, and she\nis not likely to be interrupted, I know.\"\n\n\"Stay, then; I will return in a few minutes.\"\n\nBarret retired to his room, whence he quickly returned with shooting\ncoat, knickerbockers, pot-cap and boots, all complete.\n\n\"`Richard's himself again!'  Allow me to congratulate you,\" cried\nJackman, shaking his friend by the hand.  \"But, I say, don't you think\nit may give the old lady rather a shock as well as a surprise?\"\n\nBarret looked at Milly.\n\n\"I think not,\" said Milly.  \"As uncle often says of dear mother, `she is\ntough.'\"\n\n\"Well, I'll go,\" said Barret.\n\nIn a few minutes he walked into the middle of the drawing-room and stood\nbefore Mrs Moss, who was reading a book at the time.  She laid down the\nbook, removed her glasses, and looked up.\n\n\"Well, I declare!\" she exclaimed, with the utmost elevation of her\neyebrows and distension of her eyes; \"there you are at last!  And you\nhave not even the politeness to take your hat off, or have yourself\nannounced.  You are the most singularly ill-bred young man, for your\nlooks, that I ever met with.\"\n\n\"I thought, madam,\" said Barret in a low voice, \"that you would know me\nbetter with my cap on--\"\n\nHe stopped, for the old lady had risen at the first sound of his voice,\nand gazed at him in a species of incredulous alarm.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" cried Barret, pulling off his cap; but again he stopped\nabruptly, and, before he could spring forward to prevent it, the little\nold lady had fallen flat upon the hearth-rug.\n\n\"Quick! hallo!  Milly--Giles!  Ass that I am!  I've knocked her down\n_again_!\" he shouted, as those whom he summoned burst into the room.\n\nThey had not been far off.  In a few more minutes Mrs Moss was reviving\non the sofa, and alone with her daughter.\n\n\"Milly, dear, this has been a great surprise; indeed, I might almost\ncall it a shock,\" she said, in a faint voice.\n\n\"Indeed it has been, darling mother,\" returned Milly in sympathetic\ntones, as she smoothed her mother's hair; \"and it was all my fault.  But\nare you quite sure you are not hurt?\"\n\n\"I don't _feel_ hurt, dear,\" returned the old lady, with a slight dash\nof her argumentative tone; \"and don't you think that if I _were_ hurt I\nshould _feel_ it?\"\n\n\"Perhaps, mother; but sometimes, you know, people are so _much_ hurt\nthat they _can't_ feel it.\"\n\n\"True, child, but in these circumstances they are usually unable to\nexpress their views about feeling altogether, which I am not, you see--\nno thanks to that--th-to John Barret.\"\n\n\"Oh! mother, I cannot bear to think of it--\"\n\n\"No wonder,\" interrupted the old lady.  \"To think of my being violently\nknocked down _twice--almost_ three times--by a big young man like that,\nand the first time with a horrid bicycle on the top of us--I might\nalmost say mixed up with us.\"\n\n\"But, mother, he _never_ meant it, you know--\"\n\n\"I should _think_ not!\" interjected Mrs Moss with a short sarcastic\nlaugh.\n\n\"No, indeed,\" continued Milly, with some warmth; \"and if you only knew\nwhat he has suffered on your account--\"\n\n\"Milly,\" cried Mrs Moss quickly, \"is all that _I_ have suffered on\n_his_ account to count for nothing?\"\n\n\"Of course not, _dear_ mother.  I don't mean that; you don't understand\nme.  I mean the reproaches that his own conscience has heaped upon his\nhead for what he has inadvertently done.\"\n\n\"Recklessly, child, not inadvertently.  Besides, you know, his\nconscience is not _himself_.  People cannot avoid what conscience says\nto them.  Its remarks are no sign of humility or self-condemnation, one\nproof of which is that wicked people would gladly get away from\nconscience if they could, instead of agreeing with it, as they should,\nand shaking hands with it, and saying, `we are all that you call us, and\nmore.'\"\n\n\"Well, that is exactly what John has done,\" said Milly, with increasing,\nwarmth.  \"He has said all that, and more to me--\"\n\n\"To _you_?\" interrupted Mrs Moss; \"yes, but you are not his conscience,\nchild!\"\n\n\"Yes, I am, mother; at least, if I'm not, I am next thing to it, for he\nsays _everything_ to me!\" returned Milly, with a laugh and a blush.\n\"And you have no idea how sorry, how ashamed, how self-condemned, how\noverwhelmed he has been by all that has happened.\"\n\n\"Humph!  I have been a good deal more overwhelmed than he has been,\"\nreturned Mrs Moss.  \"However, make your mind easy, child, for during\nthe last week or two, in learning to love and esteem John Barret, I have\nunwittingly been preparing the way to forgive and forget the cowardly\nyouth who ran me down in London.  Now go and send Mr Jackman to me; I\nhave a great opinion of that young man's knowledge of medicine and\nsurgery, though he _is_ only an amateur.  He will soon tell me whether I\nhave received any hurt that has rendered me incapable of feeling.  And\nat the same time you may convey to that coward, John, my entire\nforgiveness.\"\n\nMilly kissed her mother, of course, and hastened away to deliver her\ndouble message.\n\nAfter careful examination and much questioning, \"Dr\" Jackman pronounced\nthe little old lady to be entirely free from injury of any kind, save\nthe smashing of a comb in her back-hair, and gave it as his opinion that\nshe was as sound in wind and limb as before the accident, though there\nhad unquestionably been a considerable shock to the feelings, which,\nhowever, seemed to have had the effect of improving rather than\nderanging her intellectual powers.  The jury which afterwards sat upon\nher returned their verdict in accordance with that opinion.\n\nIt was impossible, of course, to prevent some of all this leaking into\nthe kitchen, the nursery, and the stable.  In the first-mentioned spot,\nQuin remarked to the housemaid,--\"Sure, it's a quare evint entirely,\"\nwith which sentiment the housemaid agreed.\n\n\"Aunt Moss is a buster,\" was Junkie's ambiguous opinion, in which Flo\nand the black doll coincided.\n\n\"Tonal',\" said Roderick, as he groomed the bay horse, \"the old wumman\niss a fery tough person.\"\n\nTo which \"Tonal'\" assented, \"she iss, what-e-ver.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN.\n\nELEPHANTS AGAIN--FOLLOWED BY SOMETHING MORE AWFUL.\n\nThere came a rainy day at last at Kinlossie House.  Such days will come\nat times in human experience, both in metaphor and fact.  At present we\nstate a fact.\n\n\"It will bring up the fush,\" was Roderick's remark, as he paused in the\noperation of cleaning harness to look through the stable door on the\nlandscape; \"an' that wull please Maister MacRummle.\"\n\n\"It will pe good for the gress too, an' that will please Muss Mully,\"\nsaid Donald, now permanently appointed to the stables.\n\n\"H'm! she wull pe carin' less for the gress, poy, than she wass used to\ndo,\" returned the groom.  \"It iss my opeenion that they wull pe all\nwantin' to co away sooth pefore long.\"\n\nWe refer to the above opinions because they were shared by the party\nassembled in Barret's room, which was still retained as a snuggery,\nalthough its occupant was fully restored to normal health and vigour.\n\n\"You'll be sure to get `that salmon' next time you try, after all this\nrain, MacRummle,\" said Mabberly.  \"At least, I hope you will before we\nleave.\"\n\n\"Ay, and you must have another try with the repeater on the Eagle Cliff,\nMac.  It would never do to leave a lone widdy, as Quin calls it, after\nmurdering the husband.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I _may_ have another day there,\" answered the old gentleman,\nwith a pleased smile; for although they roasted him a good deal for\nmistaking an eagle for a raven, and only gave him credit for a \"fluke,\"\nit was evident that he congratulated himself not a little on his\nachievement.\n\n\"Archie is having an awful time skinning and stuffing it,\" said Eddie,\nwho sat by the window dressing trout flies.\n\nJunkie, who was occupied at another window, mending the top of his rod,\nremarked that nothing seemed to give Archie so much pleasure as skinning\nand stuffing something.  \"He's always doing it,\" said the youngster.\n\"Whatever happens to die, from a tom-cat to a tom-tit, he gets hold of.\nI do believe if he was to die, he would try to skin and stuff himself!\"\n\nAt that moment Archie entered the room.\n\n\"I've got it nearly done now,\" he said, with a pleased expression, while\nhe rubbed his not-over-clean hands.  \"I'll set him up to-night and\nphotograph him to-morrow, with Flo under his wings to show his\n_enormous_ size.\"\n\n\"Oh! that minds me o' the elephants,\" cried Junkie, jumping up and\nrunning to Jackman, who was assisting.  Barret to arrange plants for\nMilly.  \"We are _all_ here now--an' you _promised_, you know.\"\n\nA heavy patter of rain on the window seemed to emphasise Junkie's\nrequest by suggesting that nothing better could be done.\n\n\"Well, Junkie, I have no objection,\" said the Woods-and-Forester, \"if\nthe rest of the company do not object.\"\n\nAs the rest of the company did not object, but rather expressed anxiety\nto hear about the hunt, Jackman drew his chair near to the fire, the\nboys crowded round him, and he began with,--\"Let me see.  Where was I?\"\n\n\"In India, of course,\" said Junkie.  \"Yes; but at what part of the\nhunt?\"\n\n\"Oh! you hadn't begun the hunt at all.  You had only made Chand\nsomethin' or other, Isri Per-what-d'ee-call-it, an' Raj Mung-thingumy\ngive poor Mowla Buksh such an awful mauling.\"\n\n\"Just so.  Well, you must know that next day we received news of large\nherds of elephants away to the eastward of the Ganges, so we started off\nwith all our forces--hunters, matchlock-men, onlookers, etcetera, and\nabout eighty tame elephants.  Chief among these last were the fighting\nelephants, to which Junkie gave such appropriate names just now, and\nking of them all was the mighty Chand Moorut, who had never been known\nto refuse a fight or lose a victory since he was grown up.\n\n\"It was really grand to see this renowned mountain of living flesh\ntowering high above his fellows.  Like all heroes, he was calm and\ndignified when not in action--a lamb in the drawing-room, a lion in the\nfield.  Even the natives, accustomed as they were to these giants, came\nto look at him admiringly that morning as he walked sedately out of\ncamp.  He was so big that he seemed to grow bigger while you looked at\nhim, and he was absolutely perfect in form and strength--the very\nHercules of brutes.\n\n\"The trackers had marked down a herd of wild elephants, not three miles\ndistant, in a narrow valley, just suited to our purpose.  On reaching\nthe ground we learned that there was, in the jungle, a `rogue'\nelephant--that is, an old male, which had been expelled from the herd.\nSuch outcasts are usually very fierce and dangerous.  This one was a\ntusker, who had been the terror of the neighbourhood, having killed many\npeople, among them a forester, only a few days before our arrival.\n\n\"As these `rogues' are always very difficult to overcome, and are almost\nsure to injure the khedda, or tame elephants of the hunt, if an attempt\nis made to capture them, we resolved to avoid him, and devote our\nattention entirely to the females and young ones.  We formed a curious\nprocession as we entered the valley--rajah and civilians, military men\nand mahowts, black and white, on pads and in howdahs--the last being the\nlittle towers that you see on elephants' backs in pictures.\n\n\"Gun-men had been sent up to the head of the valley to block the way in\nthat direction.  The sides were too steep for elephants to climb.  Thus\nwe had them, as it were, in a trap, and formed up the khedda in battle\narray.  The catching, or non-combatant elephants, were drawn up in two\nlines, and the big, fighting elephants were kept in reserve, concealed\nby bushes.  The sides of the valley were crowded with matchlock-men,\nready to commence shouting and firing at a given signal, and drive the\nherd in the direction of the khedda.\n\n\"It was a beautiful forenoon when we commenced to move forward.  All\nnature seemed to be waiting in silent expectation of the issue of our\nhunt, and not a sound was heard, the strictest silence having been\nenjoined upon all.  Rich tropical vegetation hung in graceful lines and\nfestoons from the cliffs on either side, but there was no sign of the\ngun-men concealed there.  The sun was--\"\n\n\"Oh! bother the sun!  Come on wi' the fight,\" exclaimed the impatient\nJunkie.\n\n\"All in good time, my boy.  The sun was blazing in my eyes, I was going\nto say, so, you see, I could not make out the distant view, and\ntherefore, can't describe it,\" (\"Glad of it,\" murmured the impertinent\nJunkie); \"but I knew that the wild elephants were there, somewhere in\nthe dense jungle.  Suddenly a shot was heard at the head of the valley.\nWe afterwards learned that it had been fired over the head of a big\ntusker elephant that stood under a tree not many yards from the man who\nfired.  Being young, like Junkie, and giddy, it dashed away down the\nvalley, trumpeting wildly; and you have no conception how active and\nagile these creatures can be, if you have seen only the slow, sluggish\nthings that are in our Zoos at home!  So terrible was the sound of this\nelephant's approach, that the ranks of the khedda elephants were thrown\ninto some confusion, and the mahowts had difficulty in preventing them\nfrom turning tail and running away.  Our leader, therefore, ordered the\ngladiator, Chand Moorut, to the front.  Indeed, Chand ordered himself to\nthe front, for no sooner did he hear the challenge of the tusker, than\nhe dashed forward alone to accept it, and his mahowt found it almost\nimpossible to restrain him.  Fortunately the jungle helped the mahowt by\nhiding the tusker from view.\n\n\"When the wild elephant caught sight of the line of the khedda, he went\nat it with a mighty rush, crashing through bush and brake, and\noverturning small trees like straws, until he got into the dry bed of a\nstream.  There he stopped short, for the colossal Chand Moorut suddenly\nappeared and charged him.  The wild tusker, however, showed the white\nfeather.  He could not, indeed, avoid the shock altogether, but,\nyielding to it, he managed to keep his legs, turned short round, and\nfled past his big foe.  Chand Moorut had no chance with the agile fellow\nin a race.  He was soon left far behind, while the tusker charged\nonward.  The matchlock-men tried in vain to check him.  As he approached\nthe line, the khedda elephants fled in all directions.  Thrusting aside\nsome, and overturning others that came in his way, he held on his\ncourse, amid the din of shouting and rattling of shots, and finally, got\nclear away!\"\n\n\"Oh, _what_ a pity!\" exclaimed Junkie.\n\n\"But that did not matter much,\" continued Jackman; \"for news was brought\nin that the herd we had been after were not in that valley at all, but\nin the next one, and had probably heard nothing of all the row we had\nbeen making; so we collected our forces, and went after them.\n\n\"Soon we got to the pass leading into the valley, and then, just beyond\nit, came quite suddenly on a band of somewhere about thirty wild\nelephants.  They were taken quite by surprise, for they were feeding at\nthe time on a level piece of ground of considerable extent.  As it was\nimpossible to surround them, away the whole khedda went helter-skelter\nafter them.  It was a tremendous sight.  The herd had scattered in all\ndirections, so that our khedda was also scattered.  Each hunting\nelephant had two men on its back--one, the nooseman, sitting on its\nneck, with a strong, thick rope in his hands, on which was a running\nnoose; the other, the driver, who stood erect on the animal's back,\nholding on by a loop with one hand, and in the other flourishing an\ninstrument called the _mungri_, with sharp spikes in it, wherewith to\nwhip the poor animal over the root of his tail; for of course an\nordinary whip would have had no more effect than a peacock's feather, on\nan elephant's hide!\n\n\"I ordered my mahowt to keep near one of the noosemen, whom I knew to be\nexpert in the use of the giant-lasso.  His name was Ramjee.  Both Ramjee\nand his driver were screaming and yelling at the pitch of their voices,\nand the latter was applying his mungri with tremendous energy.  The\nelephant they were after was a small female.  It is always necessary\nthat the chasing elephant should be much heavier than the one chased,\nelse evil results follow, as we soon found.  Presently the khedda\nelephant was alongside.  Ramjee lifted the great loop in both hands, and\nleaned over till he almost touched the wild animal.  Frequently this\nnoosing fails from various reasons.  For one thing, the wild creatures\nare often very clever at evading the noose: sometimes they push it away\nwith their trunks; occasionally they step right through it, and now and\nthen get only half through it, so that it forms a sort of tow rope, and\nthe other end of this rope being made fast to the neck of the tame\nelephant, the wild one drags it along violently, unless the tame one is\nmuch heavier than itself.  This is exactly what happened to Ramjee.  He\ndropped the noose beautifully over the creature's head, but before it\ncould be hauled tight--which was accomplished by checking the tame\nanimal--the active creature had got its forelegs through.  The loop\ncaught, however, on its hind quarters, and away it went, dragging the\ntame elephant after it, Ramjee shrieking wildly for help.  Two of the\nother tame elephants, not yet engaged, were sent to his assistance.\nThese easily threw two more nooses over the wild creature, and, after a\ngood run, she was finally exhausted, secured with ropes, and driven back\nto camp, there to be subjected to coercive treatment until she should\nbecome tame.\n\n\"Meanwhile, other captures were being made in the field.  I was just\nmoving off, after seeing this female secured, when a tremendous shouting\nattracted me.  It was a party chasing a fine young tusker.  He was very\ncunning, and ran about, dodging hither and thither, taking advantage of\nevery tree and bush and inequality, while the mahowts failed again and\nagain to noose him.  I made my mahowt drive our animal so as to turn him\nback.  We had no appliances to capture, as I was there only to look on\nand admire.  At last a good throw noosed him, but he slipped through,\nall except one hind leg.  On this the noose luckily held, and in a few\nminutes we had him secure.  Of course, in driving our prisoners to camp,\nthe tame elephants were used to guide them, stir them up, push them on,\nand restrain or punish them, as the case might require.  This was easy\nwith the smaller females and young ones, but it was a very different\nmatter with big males, especially with rogues, as we found out before\nthe close of that day.\n\n\"We were getting pretty well used up towards the afternoon, and had sent\nten full-grown elephants and three calves into camp, when we received\nnews that the rogue, which had been so long a terror to the district,\nwas in the neighbouring valley.  So we resolved to go for him.  Of\ncourse there was no possibility of noosing such a monster.  The ordinary\nelephants could never have been brought to face him.  Our only hope\ntherefore lay in our gladiators; and our plan was to make them knock him\ndown repeatedly, until, at length, he should be tired out.\n\n\"I need not waste time with details.  It is sufficient to say that,\nafter about an hour's search, we came upon the rogue in a dense part of\nthe jungle.  He was, as I have said, unusually big, as well as fierce.\nBut our hero, Chand Moorut, had never yet met his match, so we resolved\nto risk an encounter.  There was the dry bed of a river, which the rogue\nwould have to cross when driven down the valley by the gun-men.  Here\nour gladiator was placed, partially concealed and ready to meet the\nrogue when he should appear.  Fifty yards back the other fighting\nelephants were placed in support, and behind these were drawn up the\nrest of the khedda in three lines.  Then the spectators, many of whom\nwere ladies, were placed on a ledge of rock about forty feet above the\nriver-bed, which commanded a good view of the proposed field of battle.\n\n\"Up to this time perfect silence had been maintained in our ranks.  My\nelephant was stationed near the centre of the line, from which point I\ncould see Chand Moorut standing calmly near the river-bed, with what I\ncould almost fancy was a twinkle in his eye, as though he suspected what\nwas coming.\n\n\"Suddenly a single shot was heard from up the valley.  As it came\nechoing towards us, it was mingled with the spattering fire, shouting\nand yelling of the beaters, who began to advance.  Chand Moorut became\nrigid and motionless, like a statue.  He was evidently thinking!\nAnother instant, and the rogue's shrill trumpet-note of defiance rang\nhigh above the din.  Trembling and restive the ordinary khedda elephants\nshowed every symptom of alarm; but the fighters stood still, with the\nexception of Chand, who, becoming inflated with the spirit of war, made\na sudden dash up the valley, intent on accepting the challenge!  Fifty\nyards were passed before his mahowt, with voice, limb, and prod managed\nto reduce the well-trained warrior to obedience.  Solemnly, and with\nstately gait, he returned to his position, his great heart swelling, no\ndoubt, with anticipation.\n\n\"Scarcely had he taken up his position when the bushes higher up were\nseen to move, and the huge black form of the rogue appeared upon the\nscene.  Unlike the lively young elephant that had escaped us in the\nmorning, this old rogue marched sedately and leisurely down the\nhill-side, apparently as much unconcerned about the uproar of shooting\nand shouting in his rear as if it had been but the buzzing of a few\nmosquitoes.  I confess that doubts as to the issue of the combat arose\nin my mind when I first saw him, for he appeared to be nearly, if not\nquite, as big as Chand Moorut himself, and of course I knew that the\nhard and well-trained muscles of a wild elephant were sure to be more\npowerful than those of a tame one.  I stupidly forgot, at the moment,\nthat indomitable pluck counts for much in a trial of mere brute force.\n\n\"Ignorant of what was in store for him, with head erect, and an air of\nquiet contempt for all animate creation, the rogue walked into the dry\nbed of the river, and began to descend.  Expectation was now on tiptoe,\nwhen to our disgust he turned sharp to the right, and all but walked in\namongst the spectators on the ledge above, some of whom received him\nwith a volley of rifle balls.  As none of these touched a vital spot,\nthey might as well have been rhubarb pills!  They turned him aside,\nhowever, and, breaking through the left flank of the khedda, he took\nrefuge in the thickest jungle he could find.  The whole khedda followed\nin hot pursuit, crashing through overgrowth of canes, creepers, and\ntrees, in the midst of confusion and rumpus utterly inconceivable,\ntherefore beyond my powers of description!  We had to look out sharply\nin this chase, for we were passing under branches at times.  One of\nthese caught my man Quin, and swept him clean off his pad.  But he fell\non his feet, unhurt, and was quickly picked up and re-seated.\n\n\"In a short time we came in sight of the rogue, who suddenly turned at\nbay and confronted us.  The entire khedda came to a most inglorious\nhalt, for our heavy fighters had been left behind in the race, and the\nothers dared not face the foe.  Seeing this, he suddenly dashed into the\nmidst of us, and went straight for the elephant on which our director\nand his wife were seated!  Fortunately, a big tree, chancing to come in\nthe rogue's way, interfered with his progress.  He devoted his energies\nto it for a few moments.  Then he took to charging furiously at\neverything that came in his way, and was enjoying himself with this\nlittle game when Chand Moorut once more appeared on the scene!  The\nrogue stopped short instantly.  It was evident that he recognised a\nfoeman, worthy of his steel, approaching.  Chand Moorut advanced with\nalacrity.  The rogue eyed him with a sinister expression.  There was no\nhesitation on either side.  Both warriors were self-confident;\nnevertheless, they did not rush to the battle.  Like equally-matched\nveterans they advanced with grim purpose and wary deliberation.  With\nheads erect, and curled trunks, they met, more like wrestlers than\nswordsmen, each seeming to watch for a deadly grip.  Suddenly they\nlocked their trunks together, and began to sway to and fro with awful\nevidence of power, each straining his huge muscles to the uttermost--the\nconflict of Leviathan and Behemoth!\n\n\"For only a few minutes did the result seem doubtful to the hundreds of\nspectators, who, on elephant-back or hill-side, gazed with glaring eyes\nand bated breath, and in profound silence.  The slightly superior bulk\nand weight of our gladiator soon began to tell.  The rogue gave way,\nslightly.  Chand Moorut, with the skill of the trained warrior or the\npractised pugilist, took instant advantage of the move.  With the rush\nof a thunder-bolt he struck the rogue with his head on the shoulder.\nThe effect was terrific.  It caused him to turn a complete somersault\ninto the jungle, where he fell with a thud and a crash that could be\nheard far and near, and there he lay sprawling for a few moments,\nnothing but struggling legs, trunk, and tail being visible above the\nlong grass!\"\n\n\"Hooray!\" shouted Junkie, unable to restrain himself.\n\n\"Just what my man Quin said,\" continued Jackman.  \"Only he added,\n`Musha!'  `Thunder-an'-turf,' and `Well, I niver!'  And well he might,\ntoo, for none of us ever saw such a sight before.  But the victory was\nnot quite gained yet, for the rogue sprang up with amazing agility, and,\nrefusing again to face such a terrible foe, he ran away, pursued hotly\nand clamorously by the whole khedda.  I made my mahowt keep as close to\nChand Moorut as possible, wishing to be in at the death.  Suddenly a\nlouder uproar in advance, and a shrill trumpeting assured me that the\nrogue had again been brought to bay.\n\n\"Although somewhat exhausted and shaken by his flight and the tremendous\nknock down, he fought viciously, and kept all his smaller foes at a\nrespectful distance by repeated charges, until Chand Moorut again came\nup and laid him flat with another irresistible charge.  He staggered to\nhis feet again, however, and now the other fighting elephants, Raj\nMungul, Isri Pershad, and others, were brought into action.  These\nattacked the rogue furiously, knocking him down when he attempted to\nrise, and belabouring him with their trunks until he was thoroughly\nexhausted.  Then one of the khedda men crept up behind him on foot, with\nthick ropes fitted for the purpose of tying him, and fixed them on the\nrogue's hind legs.  But the brave man paid heavily for his daring.  He\nwas still engaged with the ropes when the animal suddenly kicked out and\nbroke the poor fellow's thigh.  He was quickly lifted up and taken to\ncamp.\n\n\"Not so quickly, however, was the rogue taken to camp!  As it was\ngrowing dark, some of us resolved to bivouac where the capture had been\nmade, and tied our captive to a tree.  Next morning we let him go with\nonly a hind leg hobbled, so that he might find breakfast for himself.\nThen, having disposed of our own breakfast, we proceeded to induce our\nprisoner to go along with us--a dangerous and difficult operation.  As\nlong as he believed that he might go where he pleased, we could induce\nhim to take a few steps, forward, but the moment he understood what we\nwere driving at, he took the sulks, like an enormous spoilt child, and\nrefused to move.  The koonkies were therefore brought up, and Raj\nMungul, going behind, gave him a shove that was irresistible.  He lost\ntemper and turned furiously on Raj, but received such an awful whack on\nthe exposed flank from Isri Pershad, that he felt his case to be\nhopeless, and sulked again.  Going down on his knees he stuck his tusks\ninto the ground, like a sheet anchor, with a determination that\nexpressed, `Move me out o' this if you can!'\n\n\"Chand Moorut accepted the unspoken challenge.  He gave the rogue a\nshove that not only raised his hind legs in the air, but caused him to\nstand on his head, and finally hurled him on his back.  As he rose,\ndoggedly, he received several admonitory punches, and advanced a few\npaces.  Spearmen also were brought forward to prick him on, but they\nonly induced him to curl his trunk round a friendly tree that came in\nhis way, and hold on.  Neither bumping, pricking, nor walloping had now\nany effect.  He seemed to have anchored himself there for the remainder\nof his natural life by an unnatural attachment.\n\n\"In this extremity the khedda men had recourse to their last resource.\nThey placed under him some native fireworks, specially prepared for such\nemergencies, and, as it were, blew him up moderately.  Being thus\nsurprised into letting go his hold of the tree, he was urged slowly\nforward as before.  You see, we did not want to kill the beast, though\nhe richly deserved death, having killed so many natives, besides keeping\na whole neighbourhood in alarm for years.  We were anxious to take him\nto camp, and we managed it at last, though the difficulty was almost\nsuperhuman, and may to some extent be conceived when I tell you that,\nalthough we spent the whole of that day, from dawn to sunset, struggling\nwith our obstinate captive, and with the entire force of the khedda, we\nonly advanced to the extent of four or five hundred yards!\"\n\nNow, while this amazing story was being told by Giles Jackman to his\nfriends in Barret's room, a very different story was being told in the\nroom above them.  That room was the nursery, and its only occupants were\nlittle Flo and her black doll.  The rain had cleared off towards the\nafternoon, and a gleam of sunshine entering the nursery windows, had\nformed a spot of intense light on the nursery floor.  This seemed to\nhave suggested something of great interest to Flo, for, after gazing at\nit with bright eyes for some time, she suddenly held the doll before her\nand said--\n\n\"Blackie, I'm goin' to tell you a stowy--a bustingly intewestin' stowy.\"\n\nWe must remind the reader here that Flo was naturally simple and sweet,\nand that as Junkie was her chief playmate, she was scarcely responsible\nfor her language.\n\n\"The stowy,\" continued Flo, \"is all 'bout Doan of Ak, who was bu'nt by\nsome naughty men, long, long ago!  D'you hear, Blackie?  It would make\nyour hair stand on end--if you had any!\"\n\nThereupon the little one set Blackie on a stool, propped her against the\nwall, and gave her a fairly correct account of the death of the\nunfortunate Joan of Arc, as related by Mrs Gordon that morning.  She\nwound up with the question,--\"Now, what you think of _zat_, Blackie?\"\n\nAs Blackie would not answer, Flo had to draw on her own bank of\nimagination for further supplies of thought.\n\n\"Come,\" she cried, suddenly, with the eagerness of one whose cheque has\njust been honoured; \"let's play at Doan of Ak!  You will be Doan, and I\nwill be the naughty men.  I'll bu'n you!  You mustn't squeal, or kick up\na wumpus, you know, but be dood.\"\n\nHaving made this stipulation, our little heroine placed the black martyr\non an old-fashioned straw-bottomed chair near the window, and getting\nhold of a quantity of paper and some old cotton dresses, she piled the\nwhole round Blackie to represent faggots.  This done, she stepped back\nand surveyed her work as an artist might study a picture.\n\n\"You've dot your best muslin fock on, da'ling, an it'll be spoiled; but\nI don't care for zat.  Now, say your pays, Doan.\"\n\nWith this admonitory remark, Flo screwed up a piece of paper, went to\nthe fireplace, made a very long arm through the fender, and lighted it.\nNext moment she applied the flame to the faggots, which blazed up with\nsurprising rapidity.\n\nStepping quickly back, the dear little child gazed at her work with\nintense delight beaming from every feature.\n\n\"Now be dood, Blackie.  Don't make a wumpus!\" she said; and as she said\nit, the flames caught the window curtains and went up with a flare that\ncaused Flo to shout with mingled delight and alarm.\n\n\"I wonder,\" remarked Mrs Gordon, who chanced to be in the drawing-room\non the windward side of the nursery, \"what amuses Flo so much!\"\n\nShe arose and went, leisurely, to see.\n\nRoderick, the groom, being in the harness-room on the lee side of the\nnursery at the time, made a remark with the same opening words.\n\n\"I wonder,\" said he, \"what _that_ wull pe!\"  A sniffing action of the\nnose told what \"that\" meant.  \"Don't you smell a smell, Tonal'?\"\n\nDonald sniffed, and replied that he did--\"what-e-ver.\"\n\n\"It wull pe somethin' on fire, Tonal',\" said the groom, dropping the\nharness-brush and running out to the yard.\n\nDonald being of the same opinion, followed him.  At the same moment a\npiercing shriek was heard to issue from the house and wild confusion\nfollowed.\n\n\"Fire! fire!\" yelled a voice in the yard outside, with that intensity of\nmeaning which is born of thorough conviction.\n\nWho that has never been roused by \"fire!\" can imagine the sensations\nthat the cry evokes, and who that really has experienced those\nsensations can hope to explain them to the inexperienced?  We cannot.\nWe will not try.\n\nBut let us not plunge with undue haste into a fire!\n\nIt will be remembered that we left Jackman in Barret's room, having just\nended his elephant story, to the satisfaction of his friends, while Mrs\nGordon was on her way to the nursery, bent on investigation.  Well, the\nvoice that shrieked in the nursery was that of Mrs Gordon, and that\nwhich yelled in the yard was the voice of the groom, supplemented by\nDonald's treble.\n\nOf course the gentlemen sprang to their feet, on hearing the uproar,\ndashed from the room in a body, and made straight for the nursery.  On\nthe way they met Mrs Gordon with Flo in her arms--all safe; not a hair\nof her pretty little head singed, but looking rather appalled by the\nconsequences of what she had done.\n\n\"Safe! thank God!\" exclaimed the laird, turning and descending with his\nwife and child, with some vague thoughts that he might be likely to find\nMrs Moss in her favourite place of resort, the library.\n\nHe was right.  He found her there in a dead faint on the floor.  He also\nfound his three boys there, exerting themselves desperately to haul her\nout of the room by a foot and an arm and the skirt of her dress.\n\n\"We knew she was here, daddy,\" gasped Eddie, \"and came straight to help\nher.\"\n\n\"Out o' the way!\" cried the laird as he grasped Mrs Moss in his arms\nand bore her away.  \"Mother and Flo are safe, boys.  Look out for\nyourselves.\"\n\n\"I'll go for the photographs!  Come, help me, Ted,\" cried Archie, as he\nran up the now smoking stairs.\n\n\"I'll go for Milly!\" cried the heroic Junkie, as, with flashing eyes, he\ndashed towards her room.\n\nBut Barret had gone for Milly before him! and without success.  She was\nnot in her room.  \"Milly!  Milly!\" he shouted, in tones of undisguised\nanxiety, as he burst out of the nursery, after finding, with his\ncompanions, that no one was there and that suffocation was imminent.\nThen, as no Milly replied, he rushed up to the garret in the belief that\nshe might have taken refuge there or on the roof in her terror.\n\nJust after he had rushed out of the nursery, Junkie burst in.  The boy\nwas in his element now.  We do not mean that he was a salamander and\nrevelled in fire and smoke, but he had read of fires and heard of them\ntill his own little soul was ablaze with a desire to save some one from\na fire--any one--somehow, or anyhow!  Finding, like the rest, that he\ncould scarcely breathe, he made but one swift circuit of the room.  In\ndoing so he tumbled on the chair on which the cause of all the mischief\nstill sat smoking, but undeniably \"dood!\"\n\n\"Blackie!\" he gasped, and seized hold of her denuded but still\nunconsumed wooden body.\n\nA few moments later he sprang through the entrance door and tumbled out\non the lawn, where most of the females of the establishment were\nstanding.\n\n\"Saved!\" he cried, in a voice of choking triumph, as he rose and held up\nthe rescued and smoking doll.\n\n\"Doan! my da'ling Doan!\" cried Flo, extending her arms eagerly to\nreceive the martyr.\n\nBy that time the house was fairly alight in its upper storey, despite\nthe utmost efforts of all the men to extinguish the fire with buckets of\nwater.\n\n\"No use, no use to waste time trying,\" said the laird, as he ran out\namong the females on the lawn.  \"Is everybody safe? eh?  Milly--where's\nMilly?\"\n\n\"Milly! where's Milly?\" echoed a stentorian voice, as Barret bounded out\nof the smoking house with singed hair and blackened face.\n\n\"There--there she is!\" cried several of the party, as they pointed\ntowards the avenue leading to the house.\n\nAll eyes were eagerly turned in that direction, and a general\nexclamation of thankfulness escaped, as Milly was seen running towards\nthe scene of action.  She had been down seeing old Mrs Donaldson, and\nknew nothing of what had occurred, till she came in sight of the\nconflagration.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN.\n\nTWO FIRES SUBDUED.\n\nBarret, half ashamed of the wild anxiety he displayed, turned at once,\nsprang back into the burning house, and began to expend his energies in\nhelping his companions and the men of the establishment to save as much\nas possible of the laird's property.\n\nWhile this was being done and the attention of every one was directed\nexclusively to the work of salvage--in which work Pat Quin shone\nconspicuous for daring as well as for all but miraculous power to endure\nheat and swallow smoke, Roderick, the groom, retired to the lawn for a\nfew moments' respite.  He was accompanied by Donald, his faithful\nassistant, who was almost exhausted by his labours.\n\n\"Tonal', poy, what iss it that Muster Archie wull pe doin'?\"\n\n\"I think he wull pe takin' the hoose!\"\n\nThey had not time to make further inquiry, for just then the wind\nchanged and blew the flames towards the part of the mansion that had\nbeen already burned, giving some hope that the other parts might yet be\nsaved, and calling for the redoubled efforts of all hands.\n\nDonald was right in his conjecture.  Archie was indeed \"takin'\" the\nhouse!  He and Eddie--having succeeded in rescuing the photographic\napparatus, and, finding that no lives were in danger, and that enough\npeople were already endeavouring to save the property--had calmly\ndevoted themselves to taking photographs of the blazing scene from\nseveral points of view--a feat that was still possible, as daylight had\nnot yet been diminished in power.\n\nThe change of wind, however, brought their operations to an abrupt\nclose, for no idlers were tolerated.  Even the women were summoned to\nstand in a row, and pass buckets from a neighbouring pond to the burning\nhouse.\n\nThe proceedings now had been reduced to some degree of order by Giles\nJackman, whose experience abroad had tended to develop his powers of\norganisation.\n\nThe buckets were passed in uninterrupted succession from the pond to the\nhouse, where Mabberly received them at the front door, that being deemed\nthe point where danger and the need for unusual energy began.  He passed\nthem in through the smoke of the hall to MacRummle, who handed them to\nRoderick and the butler.  These last stood in the dense smoke of the\nstaircase, at the head of which the tall gamekeeper, Jackman and Barret,\nwere engaged in close and deadly conflict with the flames, intense heat,\nfalling _debris_, and partial suffocation.  The rest of the people,\nheaded by the laird, who seemed to have renewed his youth and become\nubiquitous, continued the work of salvage.\n\nBy that time the party of warriors who fought the flames was increased\nby the shepherds and a few small farmers who dwelt in the neighbourhood.\nThese being stalwart and willing men, were a valuable accession to the\nforce, and did good service not only in saving property, but in\nextinguishing the fire.  So that, before night closed in, the flames\nwere finally subdued, after about one-half of the mansion had been\nconsumed.\n\nThat half, however, was still a source of great danger, the walls being\nintensely hot and the fallen beams a mass of glowing charcoal, which the\nleast breath of wind blew into a flame.  A few of the shepherds were\ntherefore stationed to watch these, and pour water on them continually.\nBut the need for urgent haste was past, and most of the people had\nassembled on the lawn among the furniture when the stars began to\nglimmer in the darkening sky.\n\n\"My dear,\" said the laird, on finding his wife in the group, \"it is all\nsafe now, so you had better get off to rest, and take all the women with\nye.  Come, girls, be off to your beds,\" he added, turning with kindly\nsmile to the domestics, and with the energetic manner that was habitual\nto him.  \"You've done good service, and stand much in need of rest, all\nof you.  The men will keep a sharp look out on what's left o' the fire,\nso you have nothing to fear.  Off with you, an' get to sleep!\"\n\nThere was no hesitation in obeying the laird's commands.  The female\ndomestics went off at once to their dormitories, and these were\nfortunately in that part of the mansion which had escaped.  Some of the\nyounger girls, however, made no effort to conceal a giggle as they\nglanced at their master who, with coat off, shirt torn, face blackened,\nhair dishevelled, and person dripping, presented rather an undignified\nappearance.  But as worthy Allan Gordon had never set up a claim to\ndignity, the giggles only amused him.\n\n\"Duncan!  Duncan, man, where are ye?\" he called out, when the ladies and\nfemale domestics had gone.  \"Oh! there ye are--an' not much more\nrespectable than myself!\" he added, as the butler answered to his\nsummons.  \"Go and fetch the whisky bottle.  We'll all be the better of a\ndram after such a fight.  What say you, gentlemen?  Do you not relax\nyour teetotal principles a little on an occasion like this?\"\n\n\"We never relax our _total abstinence_ principles,\" returned Jackman,\nwith a smile, as he wrung some of the water out of his garments.  \"I\nthink I may speak for my companions as well as myself.  Friendship has\nbeen a sufficient stimulant while we were engaged in the work, and\ngratitude for success will suffice now that the work is done.\"\n\n\"Run, Donald, boy, an' tell them to get some hot coffee ready at once!\nIt's all very well, gentlemen,\" said the laird, turning again to his\nfriends, \"to talk of subsisting on friendship and gratitude; but\nalthough very good in their way, they won't do for present necessities.\nAt least it would ill become me to express my gratitude to such good\nfriends without offering something more.  For myself,\" he added, filling\nand tossing off a glass of whisky, \"I'm an old man, and not used to this\nkind of work, so I'll be the better of a dram.  Besides, the Gordons--my\nbranch of them, at least--have always taken kindly to mountain dew, in\nmoderation, of course, in strict moderation!\"\n\nThere was a quiet laugh at this among some of the men who stood near,\nfor it was well-known that not a few of the laird's ancestors had taken\nkindly to mountain dew without the hampering influence of moderation,\nthough the good man himself had never been known to \"exceed\"--in the\nCeltic acceptation of that term.\n\n\"Are ye laughing, you rascals?\" he cried, turning to the group with a\nbeaming, though blackened countenance.  \"Come here an' have your share--\nas a penalty!\"\n\nNothing loath, the men came forward, and with a quiet word of thanks\neach poured the undiluted fiery liquid down his throat, with what the\nboy Donald styled a \"pech\" of satisfaction.\n\nIvor Donaldson chanced to be one of the group, but he did not come\nforward with the rest.\n\n\"Come, Ivor, man, and have a dram,\" said the laird, pouring out a glass.\n\nBut the keeper did not move.  He stood with his arms crossed firmly on\nhis broad chest, and a stern dogged expression on his handsome face.\n\n\"Ivor, hi!\" exclaimed the old gentleman, in a louder voice, supposing\nthat the man had not heard.  \"After work like this a dram will do you\ngood.\"\n\n\"Oo, ay!\" remarked one of the shepherds, who had probably began to feel\nthe \"good\" by that time; \"a tram of whusky iss a fery coot thing at\n_all_ times--specially when it is _coot_ whusky!\"\n\nAt this profound witticism there was a general laugh among the men, in\nthe midst of which the laird repeated his invitation to Ivor, saying\nthat he seemed knocked up after his exertions (which was partially\ntrue), and adding that surely he was man enough to take a little for his\ngood at such a time, without giving way to it.\n\nThe laird did not mean this as a taunt, but it was taken as such by the\nkeeper, who came forward quickly, seized the glass, and drained it.\nHaving done so he stood for a moment like one awaking from a dream.\nThen, without a word of thanks, he dropped the glass, sprang into the\nshrubbery, and disappeared.\n\nThe laird was surprised, and his conscience smote him, but he turned the\nincident off with a laugh.\n\n\"Now, lads,\" he said, \"go to work again.  It will take all your energies\nto keep the fire down, if it comes on to blow; and your comrades must be\ntired by this time.\"\n\nFortunately it did not come on to blow.  The night was profoundly calm,\nso that a steady though small supply of water sufficed to quench\nincipient flames.\n\nMeanwhile Giles Jackman had left the group on the lawn almost at the\nsame moment with the gamekeeper; for, having been accustomed to deal\nwith men in similar circumstances, he had a suspicion of what might\nfollow.  The poor man, having broken the resolve so recently and so\nseriously formed, had probably, he thought, become desperate.\n\nIvor was too active for him, however.  He disappeared before Jackman had\nfollowed more than a few yards.  After a few moments of uncertainty, the\nlatter made straight for old Molly Donaldson's cottage, thinking it\npossible that her unhappy son might go there.  On the way he had to pass\nthe keeper's own cottage, and was surprised to see a light in it and the\ndoor wide open.  As he approached, the sound of the keeper's voice was\nheard speaking violently, mingled with blows, as if delivered with some\nheavy instrument against timber.  A loud crash of breaking wood met\nJackman's ear as he sprang in.  Ivor was in the act of rending the\nremains of a door from a corner cupboard, while an axe, which he had\njust dropped, lay at his feet on the earthen floor.  A black quart\nbottle, visible through the opening which had been made, showed the\nreason of his assault on the cupboard.  If there had been any\nuncertainty on the point, it would have been dispelled by the wild\nlaugh, or yell of fierce exultation, with which he seized the bottle,\ndrew the cork, and raised it to his dry lips.\n\nBefore it reached them, however, Jackman's strong hand seized the\nkeeper's arm.  A gasp from the roused giant, and the deadly pallor of\nhis countenance, as he glanced round, showed that superstition had\nsuddenly seized on his troubled soul; but no sooner did he see who it\nwas that had checked him, than the hot blood rebounded to his face, and\na fierce glare shot from his eyes.\n\n\"Thank God!--not too late!\" exclaimed Jackman, fervently.\n\nThe thanksgiving was addressed to God, of course without reference to\nits influence on Ivor; but no words, apparently, could have been used\nwith better effect upon the keeper's spirit.  His eyes lost their\nferocity, and he stood irresolute.\n\n\"Break it, like a good fellow,\" said Jackman, in a soft, kindly voice,\nas he pointed to the bottle.\n\n\"I broke one before, sir,\" said Ivor, in a despairing tone; \"and you see\nhow useless that was.\"\n\n\"Give it to me, then.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he took the bottle from the man's grasp, and cast it\nthrough the open doorway, where it was shivered to atoms on the stones\noutside.\n\nStriding towards a pitcher of water which stood in a corner of the room,\nthe keeper seized it, put it to his lips, and almost drained it.\n\n\"There!\" he exclaimed; \"that will drown the devil for a time!\"\n\n\"No, Ivor, it won't; but it will _help_ to drown it,\" said Jackman, in\nthe same kindly, almost cheerful, voice.  \"Neither cold water nor\nhottest fire can slay the evils that are around and within us.  There is\nonly one Saviour from sin--Jesus, `who died for the sins of the whole\nworld.'  He makes use of means, however, and these means help towards\nthe great end.  But it was not the Saviour who told you to lock that\nbottle in that cupboard--was it?\"\n\nAn expression of perplexity came over the keeper's face.\n\n\"You are right, sir; it was not.  But, to my thinkin' it was not the\ndevil either!\"\n\n\"Very likely not.  I think sometimes we are inclined to put many things\non the devil's shoulders which ought to rest on our own.  You know what\nthe Bible says about the deceitfulness of our hearts.\"\n\n\"I do, sir, an' yet I don't quite see that it was that either.  I did\nnot put that bottle there to have it handy when I wanted it.  I put it\nthere when I made up my mind to fight this battle in Christ's name, so\nas I might see if He gave me strength to resist the temptation, when it\nwas always before me.\"\n\n\"Just so, Ivor, my friend.  That `if' shows that you doubted Him!\nMoreover, He has put into our mouths that prayer, `lead us not into\ntemptation,' and you proposed to keep temptation always before your\neyes.\"\n\n\"No, sir, no, not quite so bad as that,\" cried the keeper, growing\nexcited.  \"I shut the door an' locked the accursed thing out of my\nsight, and when I found I could _not_ resist the temptation, I took the\nkey out and flung it into the sea.\"\n\n\"Would it not have been better to have flung the evil thing itself into\nthe sea?  You soon found another key!\" said his friend, pointing to the\naxe.\n\n\"You say truth, sir; but oh, you hev no notion o' the fight I hev had\nwi' that drink.  The days an' nights of torment!  The horrors!  Ay, if\nmen could only taste the horrors _before_ they tasted the drink, I do\nbelieve there would be no drunkards at all!  I hev lain on that bed,\nsir,\" he pointed to it as he spoke, while large drops stood on his pale\nbrow at the very recollection, \"and I hev seen devils and toads and\nserpents crawlin' round me and over me--great spiders, and hairy\nshapeless things, wi' slimy legs goin' over my face, and into my mouth,\nthough I gnashed my teeth together--and glaring into my tight shut eyes,\nan' strangling me.  Oh! sir, I know not what hell may be, but I think\nthat it begins on earth wi' some men!\"\n\n\"From all this Jesus came to save us, Ivor,\" said Jackman, endeavouring\nto turn the poor man's mind from the terrible thoughts that seemed about\nto overwhelm him; \"but God will have us to consent to be saved in _His_\n_own_ way.  When you put the temptation in the cupboard, you disobeyed\nHim, and therefore were trying to be saved in _your own_ way.\nDisobedience and salvation cannot go together, because salvation means\ndeliverance from disobedience.  You and I will pray, Ivor, that God\nwould give us his holy Spirit, and then we shall fight our battles in\nfuture with more success.\"\n\nThereupon, standing as they were, but with bowed spirits and heads, they\nlaid the matter in the hands of God in a brief but earnest prayer.\n\nWhile these two were thus engaged, the scene at the house had entered\nupon another phase.  The weather, which all that day had been extremely\nchangeable, suddenly assumed its gloomiest aspect, and rain began to\nfall heavily.  Gradually the fall increased in volume, and at last\ndescended in an absolute deluge, rendering the use of water-buckets\nquite unnecessary, and accomplishing in a very few minutes what all the\nmen at the place could not have done in as many hours.  But that which\nprevented effectually the extension of the fire, caused, almost as\neffectually, the destruction of much of the property exposed on the\nlawn.  The men were therefore set to work with all their energies to\nreplace in the unburnt part of the mansion all that they had so recently\ncarried out of it.\n\nIn this work Ivor Donaldson found a sufficient outlet for the fierce\nunnatural energies which had been aroused within him.  He went about\nheaving and hauling, and staggering under weights that in an ordinary\nstate of body and mind he could scarcely have moved.  Little notice was\ntaken of him, however, for every one else was, if not doing the same\nthing, at least working up to the utmost extent of his ability.\n\nBefore midnight all was over.  The fire was what the cook termed black\nout.  The furniture, more than half destroyed, was re-housed.  The\ndanger of a revival of the flames was past, and the warriors in the\ngreat battle felt themselves free to put off their armour and seek\nrefreshment.\n\nThis they did--the males at least--in the gun-room, which, being\nfarthest from the fire, and, therefore, left untouched, had not been\ndamaged either by fire or water.  Here the thoughtful laird had given\norders to have a cold collation spread, and here, with his guests,\nmen-servants, boys, and neighbouring farmers around him, he sat down to\nsupper.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN.\n\nCONCLUSION.\n\n\"We are a queer lot, what-e-ver!\" remarked one of the farmers, with a\ndeep sigh and a candid smile, as he looked round the company.\n\nThe observation was incontrovertible, if charcoaled faces, lank hair,\ntorn and dripping garments, and a general appearance of drowned-ratiness\nmay be regarded as \"queer.\"\n\n\"My friends,\" said the laird, digging the carving fork into a cold\nturkey, \"we are also a hungry lot, if I may judge of others by myself,\nso let me advise you to fall to.  We can't afford to sit long over our\nsupper in present circumstances.  Help yourselves, and make the most of\nyour opportunities.\"\n\n\"Thank God,\" said Giles Jackman, \"that we have the opportunity to sit\ndown to sup under a roof at all.\"\n\n\"Amen to that,\" returned the laird; \"and thanks to you all, my friends,\nfor the help you have rendered.  But for you, this house and all in it\nwould have been burnt to ashes.  I never before felt so strongly how\ntrue it is that we `know not what a day may bring forth.'\"\n\n\"What you say, sir, is fery true,\" remarked a neighbouring small farmer,\nwho had a sycophantish tendency to echo or approve whatever fell from\nthe laird's lips.\n\n\"It is indeed true,\" returned his host, wiping the charcoal from his\nface with a moist handkerchief; \"but it is the Word that says it, not I.\nAnd is it not strange,\" he added, turning with a humorous look to\nBarret, \"that after all these years the influence of Joan of Arc should\nbe still so powerful in the Western Isles?  To think that she should set\nmy house on fire in this nineteenth century!\"\n\n\"I am very glad she did!\" suddenly exclaimed Junkie, who, having been\npretty well ignored or forgotten by everybody, was plying his knife and\nfork among the other heroes of the fight in a state of inexpressible\nfelicity.\n\n\"You rascal!\" exclaimed his father; \"you should have been in bed long\nago!  But why are you so glad that Joan set the house on fire?\"\n\n\"Because she gave me the chance to save Blackie's life!\" replied Junkie,\nwith supreme contentment.\n\nThe company laughed, and continued their meal, but some of them recalled\nthe proverb which states that \"the boy is father to the man,\" and\nsecretly prophesied a heroic career for Junkie.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTen months passed away, during which period Allan Gordon retired to his\nresidence in Argyllshire while his mansion in the Western Island was\nbeing restored.  During the same period Archie produced innumerable hazy\nphotographs of Kinlossie House in a state of conflagration; Eddie\npainted several good copies of the bad painting into which Milly Moss\nhad introduced a megatherium cow and other specimens of violent\nperspective; and Junkie underwent a few terrible paroxysms of intense\nhatred of learning in all its aspects, in which paroxysms he was much\nconsoled by the approval and sympathy of dear little Flo.\n\nDuring this period, also, Mabberly applied himself to his duties in\nLondon, unaffected by the loss of the _Fairy_, and profoundly interested\nin the success of his friend Barret, who had devoted himself heart and\nhead to natural history, with a view to making that science his\nprofession, though his having been left a competence by his father\nrendered a profession unnecessary, from a financial point of view.  As\nfor Giles Jackman, that stalwart \"Woods-and-Forester\" returned to his\nadopted land, accompanied by the faithful Quin, and busied himself in\nthe activities of his adventurous career, while he sought to commend the\nreligion of Jesus alike to native and European, both by precept and\nexample, proving the great truth that \"godliness is profitable unto all\nthings, having promise of the life which now is, and of that which is to\ncome.\"  MacRummle, during the same period, spent much time in his study,\nwriting for publication an elaborate treatise on fishing, with a few\nnotes on shooting, in the Western Isles.  He was encouraged in this work\nby a maiden sister who worshipped him, and by the presence of an\nenormous stuffed eagle in a corner of his study.\n\nOne day, towards the close of this period of ten months, a beautiful\nlittle woman and a handsome young man might have been seen riding in one\nof the quiet streets of London.  They rode neither on horseback, nor in\na carriage, still less in a cab!  Their vehicle was a tricycle of the\nform which has obtained the name of \"Sociable.\"\n\n\"See, this is the corner, Milly,\" said the young man.  \"I told you that\none of the very first places I would take you to see after our marriage\nwould be the spot where I had the good fortune to run _our_ mother down.\nSo now I have kept my word.  There is the very spot, by the lamp-post,\nwhere the sweep stood looking at the thin little old lady so\npathetically when I was forced to rise and run away.\"\n\n\"Oh, John!\" exclaimed Milly, pointing with eager looks along the street;\n\"and there is the thin little old lady herself!\"\n\n\"So it is!  Well, coincidences will never cease,\" said Barret, as he\nstepped from the \"sociable\" and hurried to meet Mrs Moss, who shook her\nfinger and head at him as she pointed to the pavement near the\nlamp-post.\n\n\"I would read you a lecture now, sir,\" she said; \"but will reserve it,\nfor here is a letter that may interest you.\"\n\nIt did indeed interest all three of them, as they sat together that\nafternoon in the sunshine of Milly's boudoir, for it was a long and\nwell-written epistle from old Molly Donaldson.\n\nWe will not venture to weary the reader with all that the good old woman\nhad to say, but it may perhaps be of interest to transcribe the\nconcluding sentence.  It ran thus,--\"You will be glad to hear that my\ndear Ivor is doing well.  He was married in March to Aggy Anderson, an'\nthey live in the old cottage beside me.  Ivor has put on the blue\nribbon.  The laird has put it on too, to the surprise o' everybody.  But\nI think little o' that.  I think more o' a bit pasteboard that hangs\nover my son's mantelpiece, on which he has written wi' his own hand the\nblessed words--`_Saved by Grace_.'\"\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Eagle Cliff, by R.M.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1316,"split":"test"}
