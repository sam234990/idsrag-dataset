{"ori_id":"a1ddafa4cb19dd13dd41e6c10d81839dcce36ec7","title":"Barchester Towers","context":"Barchester Towers\n Barchester Towers concerns the leading clergy of the cathedral city of Barchester. The much loved bishop having died, all expectations are that his son, Archdeacon Grantly, will succeed him. Instead, owing to the passage of the power of patronage to a new Prime Minister, a newcomer, the far more Evangelical Bishop Proudie, gains the see. His wife, Mrs Proudie, exercises an undue influence over the new bishop, making herself as well as the bishop unpopular with most of the clergy of the diocese. Her interference to veto the reappointment of the universally popular Mr Septimus Harding (protagonist of Trollope's earlier novel, The Warden) as warden of Hiram's Hospital is not well received, even though she gives the position to a needy clergyman, Mr Quiverful, with 14 children to support.\nEven less popular than Mrs Proudie is the bishop's newly appointed chaplain, the hypocritical and sycophantic Mr Obadiah Slope, who decides it would be expedient to marry Harding's wealthy widowed daughter, Eleanor Bold, and hopes to win her favour by interfering in the controversy over the wardenship. The Bishop, or rather Mr Slope under the orders of Mrs Proudie, also orders the return of the prebendary Dr Vesey Stanhope from Italy. Dr Stanhope has been there, recovering from a sore throat, for 12 years and has spent his time catching butterflies. With him to the Cathedral Close come his wife and his three adult children. The younger of Dr Stanhope's two daughters causes consternation in the Palace and threatens the plans of Mr Slope: Signora Madeline Vesey Neroni is a crippled serial flirt with a young daughter and a mysterious Italian husband whom she has left. Mrs Proudie is appalled by her and considers her an unsafe influence on her daughters, her servants and Mr Slope. Mr Slope is drawn like a moth to a flame and cannot keep away. Dr Stanhope's son Bertie is skilled at spending money but not at making it: his two sisters think marriage to rich Eleanor Bold will provide financial security for him.\nSummoned by Archdeacon Grantly to assist in the war against the Proudies and Mr Slope is the brilliant Reverend Francis Arabin. Mr Arabin is a considerable scholar, Fellow of Lazarus College at Oxford, who nearly followed his mentor John Henry Newman into the Roman Catholic Church. A massive misunderstanding occurs between Eleanor and her father, brother-in-law, sister and Mr Arabin: they all believe she intends to marry the oily chaplain Mr Slope. Mr Arabin is attracted to Eleanor but the efforts of Grantly and his wife to stop her marrying Slope also interfere with any relationship that might develop. At the Ullathorne garden party of the Thornes, matters come to a head. Mr Slope proposes to Mrs Bold and is slapped for his presumption; Bertie goes through the motions of a proposal to Eleanor and is refused with good grace, and the Signora has a chat with Mr Arabin. Mr Slope's double-dealings are now revealed and he is dismissed by Mrs Proudie and the Signora. The Signora drops a delicate word in several ears and with the removal of their misunderstanding Mr Arabin and Eleanor become engaged. The old Dean of the Cathedral having died, Mr Slope campaigns to become Dean, but Mr Harding is offered the preferment, with a beautiful house in the Close and fifteen acres of garden. However, Mr Harding considers himself unsuitable and, with the help of the archdeacon, arranges that Mr Arabin be made Dean.\nWith the Stanhopes' return to Italy, life in the Cathedral Close returns to its previous quiet and settled ways and Mr Harding continues his life of gentleness and music.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg Etext of Barchester Towers by Anthony Trollope\n\n\n*******************************************************************\nTHIS EBOOK WAS ONE OF PROJECT GUTENBERG'S EARLY FILES PRODUCED AT A\nTIME WHEN PROOFING METHODS AND TOOLS WERE NOT WELL DEVELOPED.

The\ntime it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours\nto get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\nmillion dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text\nfiles per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the\ntotal should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.\n\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\nFiles by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\nwhich is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.\n\nAt our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third\nof that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we\nmanage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly\nfrom Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an\nassortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few\nmore years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we\ndon't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.\n\nWe need your donations more than ever!\n\n\nAll donations should be made to \"Project Gutenberg\/CMU\": and are\ntax deductible to the extent allowable by law.

The illness of the\ngood old man was long and lingering, and it became at last a matter\nof intense interest to those concerned whether the new appointment\nshould be made by a conservative or liberal government.\n\nBishop Grantly died as he had lived, peaceably, slowly, without\npain and without excitement. The breath ebbed from him almost\nimperceptibly, and for a month before his death, it was a question\nwhether he was alive or dead.\n\nA trying time was this for the archdeacon, for whom was designed\nthe reversion of his father's see by those who then had the giving\naway of episcopal thrones. I would not be understood to say that\nthe prime minister had in so many words promised the bishopric to\nDr Grantly. He was too discreet a man for that. There is a proverb\nwith reference to the killing of cats, and those who know anything\neither of high or low government places, will be well aware that a\npromise may be made without positive words, and that an expectant\nmay be put into the highest state of encouragement, though the\ngreat man on whose breath he hangs may have done no more than\nwhisper that 'Mr So-and-so is certainly a rising man.'\n\nSuch a whisper had been made, and was known by those who heard it\nto signify that the cures of the diocese of Barchester should not\nbe taken out of the hands of the archdeacon. The then prime\nminister was all in all at Oxford, and had lately passed a night at\nthe house of the master of Lazarus. Now the master of\nLazarus--which is, by the bye, in many respects the most\ncomfortable, as well as the richest college at Oxford,--was the\narchdeacon's most intimate friend and most trusted counsellor. On\nthe occasion of the prime minister's visit, Dr Grantly was of\ncourse present, and the meeting was very gracious. On the following\nmorning Dr Gwynne, the master, told the archdeacon that in his\nopinion the matter was settled.\n\nAt this time the bishop was quite on his last legs; but the\nministry was also tottering. Dr Grantly returned from Oxford happy\nand elated, to resume his place in the palace, and to continue to\nperform for the father the last duties of a son; which, to give him\nhis due, he performed with more tender care than was to be expected\nfrom his usual somewhat worldly manners.\n\nA month since the physicians had named four weeks as the outside\nperiod during which breath could be supported within the body of\nthe dying man. At the end of the month the physicians wondered, and\nnamed another fortnight. The old man lived on wine alone, but at\nthe end of the fortnight he still lived; and the tidings of the\nfall of the ministry became more frequent. Sir Lamda Mewnew and Sir\nOmicron Pie, the two great London doctors, now came down for the\nfifth time, and declared, shaking their learned heads, that another\nweek of life was impossible; and as they sat down to lunch in the\nepiscopal dining-room, whispered to the archdeacon their own\nprivate knowledge that the ministry must fall within five days. The\nson returned to his father's room, and after administering with his\nown hands the sustaining modicum of madeira, sat down by the\nbedside to calculate his chances.\n\nThe ministry were to be out within five days: his father was to be\ndead within--No, he rejected that view of the subject. The ministry\nwere to be out, and the diocese might probably be vacant at the\nsame period. There was much doubt as to the names of the men who\nwere to succeed to power, and a week must elapse before a Cabinet\nwas formed. Would not vacancies be filled by the out-going men\nduring that week? Dr Grantly had a kind of idea that such would be\nthe case, but did not know; and then he wondered at his own\nignorance of such a question.\n\nHe tried to keep his mind away from the subject, but he could not.\nThe race was so very close, and the stakes were so very high. He\nthen looked at the dying man's impassive, placid face. There was no\nsign there of death or disease; it was something thinner than of\nyore, somewhat grayer, and the deep lines of age more marked; but,\nas far as he could judge, life might yet hang there for weeks to\ncome. Sir Lamda Mewnew and Sir Omicron Pie had thrice been wrong,\nand might yet be wrong thrice again. The old bishop slept during\ntwenty of the twenty-four hours, but during the short periods of\nhis waking moments, he knew both his son and his dear friend Mr\nHarding, the archdeacon's father-in-law, and would thank them\ntenderly for their care and love. Now he lay sleeping like a baby,\nresting easily on his back, his mouth just open, and his few gray\nhairs straggling from beneath his cap; his breath was perfectly\nnoiseless, and his thin, wan hand, which lay above the coverlid,\nnever moved. Nothing could be easier than the old man's passage\nfrom this world to the next.\n\nBut by no means easy were the emotions of him who sat there\nwatching. He knew it must be now or never. He was already over\nfifty, and there was little chance that his friends who were now\nleaving office would soon return to it. No probable British prime\nminister but he who was now in, he who was so soon to be out, would\nthink of making a bishop of Dr Grantly. Thus he thought long and\nsadly, in deep silence, and then gazed at that still living face,\nand then at last dared to ask himself whether he really longed for\nhis father's death.\n\nThe effort was a salutary one, and the question was answered in a\nmoment. The proud, wishful, worldly man, sank on his knees by the\nbedside, and taking the bishop's hand within his own, prayed\neagerly that his sins might be forgiven him.\n\nHis face was still buried in the clothes when the door of the\nbed-room opened noiselessly, and Mr Harding entered with a velvet\nstep. Mr Harding's attendance at that bedside had been nearly as\nconstant as that of the archdeacon, and his ingress and egress was\nas much a matter of course as that of his son-in-law. He was\nstanding close beside the archdeacon before he was perceived, and\nwould have also knelt in prayer had he not feared that his doing so\nmight have caused some sudden start, and have disturbed the dying\nman. Dr Grantly, however, instantly perceived him, and rose from\nhis knees. As he did so Mr Harding took both his hands, and pressed\nthem warmly. There was more fellowship between them at that moment\nthan there had ever been before, and it so happened that after\ncircumstances greatly preserved the feeling. As they stood there\npressing each other's hands, the tears rolled freely down their\ncheeks.\n\n'God bless you, my dears,'--said the bishop with feeble voice as he\nwoke--'God bless you--may God bless you both, my dear children:'\nand so he died.\n\nThere was no loud rattle in the throat, no dreadful struggle, no\npalpable sign of death; but the lower jaw fell a little from its\nplace, and the eyes, which had been so constantly closed in sleep,\nnow remained fixed and open. Neither Mr Harding nor Dr Grantly knew\nthat life was gone, though both suspected it.\n\n'I believe it's all over,' said Mr Harding, still pressing the\nother's hands. 'I think--nay, I hope it is.'\n\n'I will ring the bell,' said the other, speaking all but in a\nwhisper. 'Mrs Phillips should be here.'\n\nMrs Phillips, the nurse, was soon in the room, and immediately,\nwith practised hand, closed those staring eyes.\n\n'It's all over, Mrs Phillips?' asked Mr Harding.\n\n'My lord's no more,' said Mrs Phillips, turning round and\ncurtseying with a solemn face; 'His lordship's gone more like a\nsleeping baby than any that I ever saw.'\n\n'It's a great relief, archdeacon,' said Mr Harding, 'A great\nrelief--dear good, excellent old man. Oh that our last moments may\nbe as innocent and peaceful as his!'\n\n'Surely,' said Mrs Phillips. 'The Lord be praised for all his\nmercies; but, for a meek, mild, gentle-spoken Christian, his\nlordship was--' and Mrs Phillips, with unaffected but easy grief,\nput up her white apron to her flowing eyes.\n\n'You cannot but rejoice that it is over,' said Mr Harding, still\ncounselling his friend. The archdeacon's mind, however, had already\ntravelled from the death chamber to the closet of the prime\nminister. He had brought himself to pray for his father's life, but\nnow that that life was done, to dally with the fact of the bishop's\ndeath--useless to lose perhaps everything for the pretence of a\nfoolish sentiment.\n\nBut how was he to act while his father-in-law stood there holding\nhis hand? How, without appearing unfeeling, was he to forget his\nfather in the bishop--to overlook what he had lost, and think only\nof what he might possibly gain?\n\n'No; I suppose not,' said he, at last, in answer to Mr Harding. 'We\nhave all expected it for so long.'\n\nMr Harding took him by the arm and led him from the room. 'We will\nsee him again to-morrow morning,' said he; 'We had better leave the\nroom now to the woman.' And so they went downstairs.\n\nIt was already evening and nearly dark. It was most important that\nthe prime minister should know that night that the diocese was\nvacant. Everything might depend on it; and so, in answer to Mr\nHarding's further consolation, the archdeacon suggested that a\ntelegraph message should be immediately sent off to London. Mr\nHarding who had really been somewhat surprised to find Dr Grantly,\nas he thought, so much affected, was rather taken aback; but he\nmade no objection. He knew that the archdeacon had some hope of\nsucceeding to his father's place, though he by no means knew how\nhighly raised that hope had been.\n\n'Yes,' said Dr Grantly, collecting himself and shaking off his\nweakness, 'We must send a message at once; we don't know what might\nbe the consequences of delay. Will you do it?'\n\n'I! Oh yes; certainly: I'll do it, only I don't know exactly what\nit is you want.'\n\nDr Grantly sat down before a writing table, and taking pen and ink,\nwrote on a slip of paper as follows:-\n\n                  By Electric Telegraph,\n     For the Earl of -, Downing Street, or elsewhere.\n            'The Bishop of Barchester is dead.'\n        Message sent by the Rev. Septimus Harding.\n\n'There,' said he. 'Just take that to the telegraph office at the\nrailway station, and give it as it is; they'll probably make you\ncopy it on to one of their own slips; that's all you'll have to do:\nthen you'll have to pay them half-a-crown.' And the archdeacon put\nhis hand in his pocket and pulled out the necessary sum.\n\nMr Harding felt very much like an errand-boy, and also felt that he\nwas called on to perform his duties as such at rather an unseemly\ntime; but he said nothing, and took the slip of paper and the\nproffered coin.\n\n'But you've put my name into it, archdeacon.'\n\n'Yes,' said the other, 'There should be the name of some clergyman,\nyou know, and what name so proper as that of so old a friend as\nyourself? The Earl won't look at the name you may be sure of that;\nbut my dear Mr Harding, pray don't lose any time.'\n\nMr Harding got as far as the library door on his way to the\nstation, when he suddenly remembered the news with which he was\nfraught when he entered to poor bishop's bedroom. He had found the\nmoment so inopportune for any mundane tidings, that he had\nrepressed the words which were on his tongue, and immediately\nafterwards all recollection of the circumstance was for the time\nbanished by the scene which had occurred.\n\n'But, archdeacon,' said, he turning back, 'I forgot to tell\nyou--the ministry are out.'\n\n'Out!' ejaculated the archdeacon, in a tone which too plainly\nshowed the anxiety of his dismay, although under the circumstances\nof the moment he endeavoured to control himself: 'Out! Who told you\nso?'\n\nMr Harding explained that news to this effect had come down by\nelectric telegraph, and that the tidings had been left at the\npalace door by Mr Chadwick.\n\nThe archdeacon sat silent for awhile, meditating, and Mr Harding\nstood looking at him. 'Never mind,' said the archdeacon at last;\n'Send the message all the same. The news must be sent to some one,\nand there is at present no one else in a position to receive it. Do\nit at once, my dear friend; you know I would not trouble you, were\nI in a state to do it myself. A few minutes' time is of the\ngreatest importance.'\n\nMr Harding went out and sent the message, and it may be as well\nthat we should follow it to its destination. Within thirty minutes\nof its leaving Barchester it reached the Earl of - in his inner\nlibrary. What elaborate letters, what eloquent appeals, what\nindignant remonstrances, he might there have to frame, at such a\nmoment, may be conceived, but not described! How he was preparing\nhis thunder for successful rivals, standing like a British peer\nwith his back to the sea-coal fire, and his hands in his breeches\npockets,--how his fine eye was lit up with anger, and his forehead\ngleamed with patriotism,--how he stamped his foot as he thought of\nhis heavy associates,--how he all but swore as he remembered how\nmuch too clever one of them had been,--my creative readers may\nimagine. But was he so engaged? No; history and truth compel me to\ndeny it. He was sitting easily in a lounging chair, conning over a\nNewmarket list, and by his elbow on the table was lying open an\nuncut French novel on which he was engaged.\n\nHe opened the cover in which the message was enclosed, and having\nread it, he took his pen and wrote on the back of it--\n\n      'For the Earl of -,\n       With the Earl of -'s compliments,'\n\nand sent off again on its journey.\n\nThus terminated our unfortunate friend's chance of possessing the\nglories of a bishopric.\n\nThe names of many divines were given in the papers as that of the\nbishop elect. The British Grandmother declared that Dr Gwynne was\nto be the man, in compliment to the late ministry.\n\nThis was a heavy blow to Dr Grantly, but he was not doomed to see\nhimself superseded by his friend. The Anglican Devotee put forward\nconfidently the claims of a great London preacher of austere\ndoctrines; and The Eastern Hemisphere, an evening paper supposed to\npossess much official knowledge, declared in favour of an eminent\nnaturalist, a gentleman most completely versed in the knowledge of\nrocks and minerals, but supposed by many to hold on religious\nsubjects no special doctrines whatever. The Jupiter, that daily\npaper which, as we all know, is the only true source of infallibly\ncorrect information on all subjects, for a while was silent, but at\nlast spoke out. The merits of all these candidates were discussed\nand somewhat irreverently disposed of, and then The Jupiter\ndeclared that Dr Proudie was to be the man.\n\nDr Proudie was the man. Just a month after the demise of the late\nbishop, Dr Proudie kissed the Queen's hand as his successor elect.\n\nWe must beg to be allowed to draw a curtain over the sorrows of the\narchdeacon as he sat, sombre and sad at heart, in the study of his\nparsonage at Plumstead Episcopi. On the day subsequent to the\ndispatch of the message he heard that the Earl of - had consented to\nundertake the formation of a ministry, and from that moment he knew\nthat his chance was over. Many will think that he was wicked to\ngrieve for the loss of episcopal power, wicked to have coveted it,\nnay, wicked even to have thought about it, in the way and at the\nmoment he had done so.\n\nWith such censures, I cannot profess that I completely agree. The\nnolo episcopari, though still in use, is so directly at variance\nwith the tendency of all human aspirations of rising priests in the\nChurch of England. A lawyer does not sin in seeking to be a judge,\nor in compassing his wishes by all honest means. A young diplomat\nentertains a fair ambition when he looks forward to be the lord of\na first-rate embassy; and a poor novelist when he attempts to rival\nDickens or rise above Fitzjames, commits no fault, though he may be\nfoolish.\n\nSydney Smith truly said that in these recreant days we cannot\nexpect to find the majesty of St. Paul beneath the cassock of a\ncurate. If we look to our clergymen to be more than men, we shall\nprobably teach ourselves to think that they are less, and can\nhardly hope to raise the character of the pastor by denying to him\nthe right to entertain the aspirations of a man.\n\nOur archdeacon was worldly--who among us is not so? He was\nambitious--who among us is ashamed to own that 'last infirmity of\nnoble minds!' He was avaricious, my readers will say. No--it was\nnot for love of lucre that he wished to be bishop of Barchester. He\nwas his father's only child, and his father had left him great\nwealth. His preferment brought him in nearly three thousand a year.\nThe bishopric, as cut down by the Ecclesiastical Commission, was\nonly five. He would be a richer man as archdeacon, than he could be\nas a bishop. But he certainly did desire to play first fiddle; he\ndid desire to sit in full lawn sleeves amongst the peers of the\nrealm; and he did desire, if the truth must be out, to be called\n'My Lord' by the reverend brethren.\n\nHis hopes, however, were they innocent or sinful, were not fated to\nbe realised; and Dr Proudie was consecrated Bishop of Barchester.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nHIRAM'S HOSPITAL ACCORDING TO ACT OF PARLIAMENT\n\nIt is hardly necessary that I should here give to the public any\nlengthened biography of Mr Harding, up to the period of the\ncommencement of this tale. The public cannot have forgotten how ill\nthat sensitive gentleman bore the attack that was made upon him in\nthe columns of the Jupiter, with reference to the income which he\nreceived as warden of Hiram's Hospital, in the city of Barchester.\nNor can it be forgotten that a law-suit was instituted against him\non the matter of that charity by Mr John Bold, who afterwards\nmarried his, Mr Harding's, younger and then only unmarried\ndaughter. Under the pressure of these attacks, Mr Harding had\nresigned his wardenship, though strongly recommended to abstain\nfrom doing so, both by his friends and his lawyers. He did,\nhowever, resign it, and betook himself manfully to the duties of\nthe small parish of St. Cuthbert's, in the city, of which he was\nvicar, continuing also to perform those of precentor of the\ncathedral, a situation of small emoluments which had hitherto been\nsupposed to be joined, as a matter of course, to the wardenship of\nthe hospital above spoken of.\n\nWhen he left the hospital from which he had been so ruthlessly\ndriven, and settled himself down in his own modest manner in the\nHigh Street of Barchester, he had not expected that others would\nmake more fuss about it than he was inclined to do himself; and the\nextent of his hope was, that the movement might have been made in\ntime to prevent any further paragraphs in the Jupiter. His affairs,\nhowever, were not allowed to subside thus quietly, and people were\nquite as much inclined to talk about the disinterested sacrifice he\nhad made, as they had before been to upbraid him for his cupidity.\n\nThe most remarkable thing that occurred, was the receipt of an\nautographed letter from the Archbishop of Canterbury, in which the\nprimate very warmly praised his conduct, and begged to know what\nhis intentions were for the future. Mr Harding replied that he\nintended to be rector of St. Cuthbert's in Barchester; and so that\nmatter dropped. Then the newspapers took up his case, the Jupiter\namong the rest, and wafted his name in eulogistic strains through\nevery reading-room in the nation. It was discovered also, that he\nwas the author of that great musical work, Harding's Church\nMusic,--and a new edition was spoken of, though, I believe, never\nprinted. It is, however, certain that the work was introduced into\nthe Royal Chapel at St James's, and that a long criticism appeared\nin the Musical Scrutator, declaring that in no previous work of its\nkind had so much research been joined with such exalted musical\nability, and asserting that the name of Harding would henceforward\nbe known wherever the Arts were cultivated, or Religion valued.\n\nThis was high praise, and I will not deny that Mr Harding was\ngratified by such flattery; for if Mr Harding was vain on any\nsubject, it was on that of music. But here the matter rested. The\nsecond edition, if printed, was never purchased; the copies which\nhad been introduced into the Royal Chapel disappeared again, and\nwere laid by in peace, with a load of similar literature. Mr\nTowers, of the Jupiter, and his brethren occupied themselves with\nother names, and the underlying fame promised to our friend was\nclearly intended to be posthumous.\n\nMr Harding had spent much of his time with his friend the bishop,\nmuch with his daughter Mrs Bold, now, alas, a widow; and had almost\ndaily visited the wretched remnants of his former subjects, the few\nsurviving bedesmen now left at Hiram's Hospital. Six of them were\nstill living. The number, according to old Hiram's will, should\nalways have been twelve. But after the abdication of their warden,\nthe bishop had appointed no successor to him, and it appeared as\nthough the hospital at Barchester would fall into abeyance, unless\nthe powers that be should take some steps towards putting it once\nmore into working order.\n\nDuring the past five years the powers that be had not overlooked\nBarchester Hospital, and sundry political doctors had taken the\nmatter in hand. Shortly after Mr Harding's resignation, the Jupiter\nhad very clearly shown what ought to be done. In about half a\ncolumn it had distributed the income, rebuilt the building, put an\nend to all bickerings, regenerated kindly feeling, provided for Mr\nHarding, and placed the whole thing on a footing which could not\nbut be satisfactory to the city and Bishop of Barchester, and to\nthe nation at large. The wisdom of this scheme was testified by the\nnumber of letters which \"Common Sense\", \"Veritas\", and \"One that\nloves fair play,\" sent to the Jupiter, all expressing admiration\nand amplifying on the details given. It is singular enough that no\nadverse letter appeared at all, and, therefore, none of course was\nwritten.\n\nBut Cassandra was not believed, and even the wisdom of the Jupiter\nsometimes falls on deaf ears. Though other plans did not put\nthemselves forward in the columns of the Jupiter, reformers of\nchurch charities were not slack to make known in various places\ntheir different nostrums for setting Hiram's Hospital on its feet\nagain. A learned bishop took occasion, in the Upper House, to\nallude to the matter, intimating that he had communicated on the\nsubject with his right reverend brother of Barchester. The radical\nmember for Staleybridge had suggested that the funds should be\nalienated for the education of the agricultural poor of the\ncountry, and he amused the House by some anecdotes touching the\nsuperstition and habits of the agriculturists in question. A\npolitical pamphleteer had produced a few dozen pages, which he\ncalled 'Who are Hiram's heirs?' intending to give an infallible\nrule for the governance of such establishments; and, at last, a\nmember of the government promised that in the next session a short\nbill should be introduced for regulating the affairs of Barchester,\nand other kindred concerns.\n\nThe next session came, and, contrary to custom, the bill came also.\nMen's minds were then intent on other things. The first\nthreatenings of a huge war hung heavily over the nation, and the\nquestion as to Hiram's heirs did not appear to interest very many\npeople either in or out of the House. The bill, however, was read\nand reread, and in some undistinguished manner passed through its\neleven stages without appeal or dissent. What would John Hiram have\nsaid in the matter, could he have predicted that some forty-five\ngentlemen would take on themselves to make a law altering the whole\npurport of the will, without in the least knowing at the moment of\ntheir making it, what it was that they were doing? It is however to\nbe hoped that the under secretary for the Home Office knew, for to\nhim had the matter been confided.\n\nThe bill, however, did pass, and at the time at which this history\nis supposed to commence, it had been ordained that there should be,\nas heretofore, twelve old men in Barchester Hospital, each with\n1s 4d a day; that there should also be twelve old women, each with\n1s 2d a day; that there should be a matron with a house and L 70 a\nyear; a steward with L 150 a year, who should have the spiritual\nguidance of that appertaining to the male sex. The bishop, dean,\nand warden, were, as formerly, to appoint in turn the recipients of\nthe charity, and the bishop was to appoint the officers. There was\nnothing said as to the wardenship being held by the precentor of\nthe cathedral, nor a word as to Mr Harding's right to the\nsituation.\n\nIt was not, however, till some months after the death of the old\nbishop, and almost immediately consequent on the installation of\nhis successor, that notice was given that the reform was about to\nbe carried out. The new law and the new bishop were among the\nearliest works of a new ministry, or rather of a ministry who,\nhaving for a while given place to their opponents, had then\nreturned to power; and the death of Dr Grantly occurred, as we\nhave seen, exactly at the period of change.\n\nPoor Eleanor Bold! How well does that widow's cap become her, and\nthe solemn gravity with which she devotes to her new duties. Poor\nEleanor!\n\nPoor Eleanor! I cannot say that with me John Bold was ever a\nfavourite. I never thought him worthy of the wife he had won. But\nin her estimation he was most worthy. Hers was one of those\nfeminine hearts which cling to a husband, not with idolatry, for\nworship can admit of no defect in its idol, but with the perfect\ntenacity of ivy. As the parasite plant will follow even the defects\nof the trunk which it embraces, so did Eleanor cling to and love\nthe very faults of her husband.\n\nShe had once declared that whatever her father did should in her\neyes be right. She then transferred her allegiance, and became ever\nready to defend the worst failings of her lord and master.\n\nAnd John Bold was a man to be loved by a woman; he was himself\naffectionate, he was confiding and manly; and that arrogance of\nthought, unsustained by first-rate abilities, that attempt at being\nbetter than his neighbours which jarred so painfully on the\nfeelings of his acquaintances, did not injure him in the estimation\nof his wife.\n\nCould she even have admitted that he had a fault, his early death\nwould have blotted out the memory of it. She wept as for the loss\nof the most perfect treasure with which mortal woman had ever been\nendowed; for weeks after he was gone the idea of future happiness\nin this world was hateful to her; consolation, as it is called, was\ninsupportable, and tears and sleep were her only relief.\n\nBut God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb. She knew that she had\nwithin her the living source of other cares. She knew that there\nwas to be created for her another subject of weal or woe, of\nunutterable joy or despairing sorrow, as God in his mercy might\nvouchsafe to her. At first this did not augment her grief! To be\nthe mother of a poor infant, orphaned before it was born, brought\nforth to the sorrows of an ever desolate hearth, nurtured amidst\ntears and wailing, and then turned adrift into the world without\nthe aid of a father's care! There was at first no joy in this.\n\nBy degrees, however, her heart became anxious for another object,\nand, before its birth, the stranger was expected with all the\neagerness of a longing mother. Just eight months after the father's\ndeath a second John Bold was born, and if the worship of one\ncreature can be innocent in another, let us hope that the adoration\noffered over the cradle of the fatherless infant may not be imputed\nas sin.\n\nIt will not be worth our while to define the character of the\nchild, or to point out in how far the faults of the father were\nredeemed within that little breast by the virtues of the mother.\nThe baby, as a baby, was all that was delightful, and I cannot\nforesee that it will be necessary for us to inquire into the facts\nof his after life. Our present business at Barchester will not\noccupy us above a year or two at the furthest, and I will leave it\nto some other pen to produce, if necessary, the biography of John\nBold the Younger.\n\nBut, as a baby, this baby was all that could be desired. This fact\nno one attempted to deny. 'Is he not delightful?' she would say to\nher father, looking into his face from her knees, he lustrous eyes\noverflowing with soft tears, her young face encircled by her close\nwidow's cap and her hands on each side of the cradle in which her\ntreasure was sleeping. The grandfather would gladly admit that the\ntreasure was delightful, and the uncle archdeacon himself would\nagree, and Mrs Grantly, Eleanor's sister, would re-echo the word\nwith true sisterly energy; and Mary Bold--but Mary Bold was a\nsecond worshipper at the same shrine.\n\nThe baby was really delightful; he took his food with a will,\nstruck out his toes merrily whenever his legs were uncovered, and\ndid not have fits. These are supposed to be the strongest points of\nbaby perfection, and in all these our baby excelled.\n\nAnd in this the widow's deep grief was softened, and a sweet balm\nwas poured into the wound which she had thought nothing but death\ncould heal. How much kinder is God to us than we are willing to be\nto ourselves! At the loss of every dear face, at the last going of\nevery well beloved one, we all doom ourselves to an eternity of\nsorrow, and look to waste ourselves away in an ever-running\nfountain of tears. How seldom does such grief endure! How blessed\nis the goodness which forbids it to do so! 'Let me ever remember my\nliving friends, but forget them as soon as they are dead,' was the\nprayer of a wise man who understood the mercy of God. Few perhaps\nwould have the courage to express such a wish, and yet to do so\nwould only be to ask for that release from sorrow, which a kind\nCreator almost always extends to us.\n\nI would not, however, have it imagined that Mrs Bold forgot her\nhusband. She really thought of him with all conjugal love, and\nenshrined his memory in the innermost centre of her heart. But yet\nshe was happy in her baby. It was so sweet to press the living toy\nto her breast, and feel that a human being existed who did owe, and\nwas to owe everything to her; whose daily food was drawn from\nherself; whose little wants could all be satisfied by her; whose\ninfant tongue would make his first effort in calling her by the\nsweetest name a woman can hear. And so Eleanor's bosom became\ntranquil, and she set about her new duties eagerly and gratefully.\n\nAs regards the concerns of the world, John Bold had left his widow\nin prosperous circumstances. He had bequeathed to her all that he\npossessed, and that comprised an income much exceeding what she or\nher friends thought necessary for her. It amounted to nearly a\nthousand a year; and when she reflected on its extent, her dearest\nhope was to hand it over, not only unimpaired, but increased, to\nher husband's son, to her own darling, to the little man who now\nlay sleeping on her knee, happily ignorant of the cares which were\nto be accumulated in his behalf.\n\nWhen John Bold died, she earnestly implored her father to come and\nlive with her, but this Mr Harding declined, though for some weeks\nhe remained with her as a visitor. He could not be prevailed upon\nto forego the possession of some small house of his own, and so\nremained in the lodgings he had first selected over a chemist's\nshop in the High Street at Barchester.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nDR AND MRS PROUDIE\n\nThis narrative is supposed to commence immediately after the\ninstallation of Dr Proudie. I will not describe the ceremony, as I\ndo not precisely understand its nature. I am ignorant whether a\nbishop be chaired like a member of parliament, or carried in a gilt\ncoach like a lord mayor, or sworn in like a justice of the peace,\nor introduced like a peer to the upper house, or led between two\nbrethren like a knight of the garter; but I do know that every\nthing was properly done, and that nothing fit or becoming to a\nyoung bishop was omitted on the occasion.\n\nDr Proudie was not the man to allow anything to be omitted that\nmight be becoming to his new dignity. He understood well the value\nof forms, and knew that the due observations of rank could not be\nmaintained unless the exterior trappings belonging to it were held\nin proper esteem. He was a man born to move in high circles; at\nleast so he thought himself and circumstances had certainly\nsustained him in this view. He was the nephew of a Irish baron by\nhis mother's side, and his wife was the niece of a Scottish earl.\nHe had for years held some clerical office appertaining to courtly\nmatters, which had enabled him to live in London, and to entrust\nhis parish to his curate. He had been a preacher to the royal\nbeefeaters, curator of theological manuscripts in the\nEcclesiastical Courts, chaplain of the Queen's Yeomanry Guard, and\nalmoner to his Royal Highness the Prince of Rappe-Blankenburg.\n\nHis residence in the metropolis, rendered necessary by the duties\nentrusted to him, his high connections, and the peculiar talents\nand nature of the man, recommended him to persons in power; and Dr\nProudie became known as a useful and rising clergyman.\n\nSome few years since, even within the memory of many who are not\nyet willing to call themselves old, a liberal clergyman was a\nperson not frequently to be met. Sydney Smith was such, and was\nlooked on as a little better than an infidel; a few others also\nmight be named, but they were 'rarae aves', and were regarded with\ndoubt and distrust by their brethren. No man was so surely a tory\nas a country rector--nowhere were the powers that be so cherished\nas at Oxford.\n\nWhen, however, Dr Whately was made an archbishop, and Dr Hampden\nsome years afterwards regius professor, many wise divines saw that\na change was taking place in men's minds, and that more liberal\nideas would henceforward be suitable to the priests as well as to\nthe laity. Clergymen began to be heard of who had ceased to\nanathematise papists on the one hand, or vilify dissenters on the\nother. It appeared clear that high church principles, as they are\ncalled, were no longer to be the surest claims to promotion with at\nany rate one section of statesmen, and Dr Proudie was one among\nthose who early in life adapted himself to the views held by the\nwhigs on most theological and religious subjects. He bore with the\nidolatry of Rome, tolerated even the infidelity of Socinianism, and\nwas hand and glove with the Presbyterian Synods of Scotland and\nUlster.\n\nSuch a man at such a time was found to be useful, and Dr Proudie's\nname began to appear in the newspapers. He was made one of a\ncommission who went over to Ireland to arrange matters preparative\nto the working of the national board; he became honorary secretary\nto another commission nominated to inquire into the revenues of\ncathedral chapters; and had had something to do with both the\nregium donum and the Maynooth Grant.\n\nIt must not be on this account be taken as proved that Dr Proudie\nwas a man of great mental powers, or even of much capacity for\nbusiness, for such qualities had not been required in him. In the\narrangement of those church reforms with which he was connected,\nthe ideas and original conception of the work to be done were\ngenerally furnished by the liberal statesmen of the day, and the\nlabour of the details was borne by officials of a lower rank. It\nwas, however, thought expedient that the name of some clergyman\nshould appear in such matters, and as Dr Proudie had become known\nas a tolerating divine, great use of this sort was made of his\nname. If he did not do much active good, he never did any harm; he\nwas amenable to those who were really in authority, and at the\nsittings of the various boards to which he belonged maintained a\nkind of dignity which had its value.\n\nHe was certainly possessed of sufficient tact to answer the purpose\nfor which he was required without making himself troublesome; but\nit must not therefore be surmised that he doubted his own power, or\nfailed to believe that he could himself take a high part in high\naffairs when his own turn came. His was biding his time, and\npatiently looking forward to the days when he himself would sit\nauthoritative at some board, and talk and direct, and rule the\nroost, while lesser stars sat round and obeyed, as he had so well\naccustomed himself to do.\n\nHis reward and his time had now come. He was selected for the\nvacant bishopric, and on the next vacancy which might occur in any\ndiocese would take his place in the House of Lords, prepared to\ngive not a silent vote in all matters concerning the weal of the\nchurch establishment. Toleration was to be the basis on which he\nwas to fight his battles, and in the honest courage of his heart he\nthought no evil would come to him in encountering even such foes as\nhis brethren of Exeter and Oxford.\n\nDr Proudie was an ambitious man, and before he was well consecrated\nBishop of Barchester, he had begun to look up to archepiscopal\nsplendour, and the glories of Lambeth, or at any rate of\nBishopsthorpe. He was comparatively young, and had, as he fondly\nflattered himself, been selected as possessing such gifts, natural\nand acquired, as must be sure to recommend him to a yet higher\nnotice, now that a higher sphere was opened to him. Dr Proudie was,\ntherefore, quite prepared to take a conspicuous part in all\ntheological affairs appertaining to these realms; and having such\nviews, by no means intended to bury himself at Barchester as his\npredecessor had done. No: London should still be his ground: a\ncomfortable mansion in a provincial city might be well enough for\nthe dead months of the year. Indeed Dr Proudie had always felt it\nnecessary to his position to retire from London when other great\nand fashionable people did so; but London should still be his fixed\nresidence, and it was in London that he resolved to exercise that\nhospitality so peculiarly recommended to all bishops by St Paul.\nHow otherwise could he keep himself before the world? How else give\nthe government, in matters theological, the full benefit of his\nweight and talents?\n\nThis resolution was no doubt a salutary one as regarded the world\nat large, but was not likely to make him popular either with the\nclergy or the people of Barchester. Dr Grantly had always lived\nthere; and in truth it was hard for a bishop to be popular after Dr\nGrantly. His income had averaged L 9000 a year; his successor was\nto be rigidly limited to L 5000. He had but one child on whom to\nspend his money; Dr Proudie had seven or eight. He had been a man\nof few personal expenses, and they had been confined to the tastes\nof a moderate gentleman; but Dr Proudie had to maintain a position\nin fashionable society, and had that to do with comparatively small\nmeans. Dr Grantly had certainly kept his carriages, as became a\nbishop; but his carriage, horses, and coachmen, though they did\nvery well for Barchester, would have been almost ridiculous at\nWestminster. Mrs Proudie determined that her husband's equipage\nshould not shame her, and things on which Mrs Proudie resolved,\nwere generally accomplished.\n\nFrom all this it was likely to result that Dr Proudie would not\nspend much money at Barchester; whereas his predecessor had dealt\nwith the tradesmen of the city in a manner very much to their\nsatisfaction. The Grantlys, father and son, had spent their money\nlike gentlemen; but it soon became whispered in Barchester that Dr\nProudie was not unacquainted with those prudent devices by which\nthe utmost show of wealth is produced from limited means.\n\nIn person Dr Proudie is a good-looking man; spruce and dapper, and\nvery tidy. He is somewhat below middle height, being about five\nfeet four; but he makes up for the inches which he wants by the\ndignity with which he carries those which he has. It is no fault\nof his own if he has not a commanding eye, for he studies hard to\nassume it. His features are well formed, though perhaps the\nsharpness of his nose may give to his face in the eyes of some\npeople an air of insignificance. If so, it is greatly redeemed by\nhis mouth and chin, of which he is justly proud.\n\nDr Proudie may well be said to have been a fortunate man, for he\nwas not born to wealth, and he is now bishop of Barchester; but\nnevertheless he has his cares. He has a large family, of whom the\nthree eldest are daughters, now all grown up and fit for\nfashionable life; and he has a wife. It is not my intention to\nbreathe a word against the character of Mrs Proudie, but still I\ncannot think that with all her virtues she adds much to her\nhusband's happiness. The truth is that in matters domestic she\nrules supreme over her titular lord, and rules with a rod of iron.\nNor is this all. Things domestic Dr Proudie might have abandoned to\nher, if not voluntarily, yet willingly. But Mrs Proudie is not\nsatisfied with such home dominion, and stretches her power over all\nhis movements, and will not even abstain from things spiritual. In\nfact, the bishop is henpecked.\n\nThe archdeacon's wife, in her happy home at Plumstead, knows how to\nassume the full privileges of her rank, and express her own mind in\nbecoming tone and place. But Mrs Grantly's sway, if sway she has,\nis easy and beneficent. She never shames her husband; before the\nworld she is a pattern of obedience; her voice is never loud, nor\nher looks sharp: doubtless she values power, and has not\nunsuccessfully striven to acquire it; but she knows what should be\nthe limits of woman's rule.\n\nNot so Mrs Proudie. This lady is habitually authoritative to all,\nbut to her poor husband she is despotic. Successful as has been his\ncareer in the eyes of the world, it would seem that in the eyes of\nhis wife he is never right. All hope of defending himself has long\npassed from him; indeed he rarely even attempts self-justification;\nand is aware that submission produces the nearest approach to peace\nwhich his own house can ever attain.\n\nMrs Proudie has not been able to sit at the boards and committees\nto which her husband has been called by the state; nor, as he often\nreflects, can she make her voice heard in the House of Lords. It\nmay be that she will refuse to him permission to attend to this\nbranch of a bishop's duties; it may be that she will insist on his\nclose attendance to his own closet. He has never whispered a word\non the subject to living ears, but he has already made his fixed\nresolve. Should such an attempt be made he will rebel. Dogs have\nturned against their masters, and even Neapolitans against their\nrulers, when oppression has been too severe. And Dr Proudie feels\nwithin himself that if the cord be drawn too tight, he also can\nmuster courage and resist.\n\nThe state of vassalage in which our bishop had been kept by his\nwife has not tended to exalt his character in the eyes of his\ndaughters, who assume in addressing their father too much of that\nauthority which is not properly belonging, at any rate, to them.\nThey are, on the whole, fine engaging young ladies. They are tall\nand robust like their mother, whose high cheek bones, and--we may\nsay auburn hair, they all inherit. They think somewhat too much of\ntheir grand uncles, who have not hitherto returned the compliment\nby thinking much of them. But now that their father is a bishop, it\nis probable that family ties will be drawn closer. Considering\ntheir connection with the church, they entertain but few prejudices\nagainst the pleasures of the world; and have certainly not\ndistressed their parents, as too many English girls have lately\ndone, by any enthusiastic wish to devote themselves to the\nseclusion of a protestant nunnery. Dr Proudie's sons are still at\nschool.\n\nOne other marked peculiarity in the character of the bishop's wife\nmust be mentioned. Though not averse to the society and manners of\nthe world, she is in her own way a religious woman; and the form in\nwhich this tendency shows itself in her is by a strict observance\nof the Sabbatarian rule. Dissipation and low dresses during the\nweek are, under her control, atoned for by three services, an\nevening sermon read by herself, and a perfect abstinence from any\ncheering employment on Sunday. Unfortunately for those under her\nroof to whom the dissipation and low dresses are not extended, her\nservants namely and her husband, the compensating strictness of the\nSabbath includes all. Woe betide the recreant housemaid who is\nfound to have been listening to the honey of a sweetheart in the\nRegent's Park, instead of the soul-stirring evening discourse of Mr\nSlope. Not only is she sent adrift, but she is so sent with a\ncharacter which leaves her little hope of a decent place. Woe\nbetide the six-foot hero who escorts Mrs Proudie to her pew in red\nplush breeches, if he slips away to the neighbouring beer-shop,\ninstead of falling into the back seat appropriated to his use. Mrs\nProudie has the eyes of Argus for such offenders. Occasional\ndrunkenness in the week may be overlooked, for six feet on low\nwages are hardly to be procured if the morals are always kept at a\nhigh pitch; but not even for the grandeur or economy will Mrs\nProudie forgive a desecration of the Sabbath.\n\nIn such matters, Mrs Proudie allows herself to be often guided by\nthat eloquent preacher, the Rev. Mr Slope, and as Dr Proudie is\nguided by his wife, it necessarily follows that the eminent man we\nhave named has obtained a good deal of control over Dr Proudie in\nmatters concerning religion. Mr Slope's only preferment has\nhitherto been that of reader and preacher in a London district\nchurch; and on the consecration of his friend the new bishop, he\nreadily gave this up to undertake the onerous but congenial duties\nof domestic chaplain to the bishop.\n\nMr Slope, however, on his first introduction must not be brought\nbefore the public at the tail of a chapter.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTHE BISHOP'S CHAPLAIN\n\nOf the Rev. Mr Slope's parentage I am not able to say much. I have\nheard it asserted that he is lineally descended from that eminent\nphysician who assisted at the birth of Mr T. Shandy, and that in\nearly years he added an 'e' to his name, for the sake of euphony,\nas other great men have done before him. If this be so, I presumed\nhe was christened Obadiah, for that is his name, in commemoration\nof the conflict in which his ancestor so distinguished himself. All\nmy researches on the subject have, however, failed in enabling me\nto fix the date on which the family changed its religion.\n\nHe had been a sizar at Cambridge, and had there conducted himself\nat any rate successfully, for in due process of time he was an MA,\nhaving university pupils under his care. From thence he was\ntransferred to London, and became preacher at a new district church\nbuilt on the confines of Baker Street. He was in this position when\ncongenial ideas on religious subjects recommended him to Mrs\nProudie, and the intercourse had become close and confidential.\n\nHaving been thus familiarly thrown among the Misses Proudie, it was\nmore than natural that some softer feeling than friendship should\nbe engendered. There have been some passages of love between him\nand the eldest hope, Olivia; but they have hitherto resulted in no\nfavourable arrangement. In truth, Mr Slope, having made a\ndeclaration of affection, afterwards withdrew it on finding that\nthe doctor had no immediate worldly funds with which to endow his\nchild; and it may easily be conceived that Miss Proudie, after such\nan announcement on his part, was not readily disposed to receive\nany further show of affection. On the appointment of Dr Proudie to\nthe bishopric of Barchester, Mr Slope's views were, in truth,\nsomewhat altered. Bishops, even though they be poor, can provide\nfor clerical children, and Mr Slope began to regret that he had not\nbeen more disinterested. He no sooner heard the tidings of the\ndoctor's elevation, than he recommenced his siege, not violently,\nindeed, but respectfully, and at a distance. Olivia Proudie,\nhowever, was a girl of spirit: she had the blood of two peers in\nher veins, and, better still, she had another lover on her books;\nso Mr Slope sighed in vain; and the pair soon found it convenient\nto establish a mutual bond of inveterate hatred.\n\nIt may be thought singular that Mrs Proudie's friendship for the\nyoung clergyman should remain firm after such an affair; but, to\ntell the truth, she had known nothing of it. Though very fond of Mr\nSlope herself, she had never conceived the idea that either of her\ndaughters would become so, and remembering that their high birth\nand social advantages, expected for them matches of a different\nsort. Neither the gentleman nor the lady found it necessary to\nenlighten her. Olivia's two sisters had each known of the affair,\nso had all the servants, so had all the people living in the\nadjoining houses on either side; but Mrs Proudie had been kept in\nthe dark.\n\nMr Slope soon comforted himself with the reflection that, as he had\nbeen selected as chaplain to the bishop, it would probably be in\nhis power to get the good things in the bishop's gift, without\ntroubling himself with the bishop's daughter; and he found himself\nable to endure the pangs of rejected love. As he sat himself down\nin the railway carriage, confronting the bishop and Mrs Proudie, as\nthey started on their first journey to Barchester, he began to form\nin his own mind a plan of his future life. He knew well his\npatron's strong points, but he knew the weak ones as well. He\nunderstood correctly enough to what attempts the new bishop's high\nspirit would soar, and he rightly guessed that public life would\nbetter suit the great man's taste, than the small details of\ndiocesan duty.\n\nHe, therefore, he, Mr Slope, would in effect be bishop of\nBarchester. Such was his resolve; and to give Mr Slope his due, he\nhad both courage and spirit to bear him out in his resolution. He\nknew that he should have a hard battle to fight, for the power and\npatronage of the see would be equally coveted by another great\nmind--Mrs Proudie would also choose to be bishop of Barchester. Mr\nSlope, however, flattered himself that he could outmanoeuvre the\nlady. She must live much in London, while he would always be on the\nspot. She would necessarily remain ignorant of much while he would\nknow everything belonging to the diocese. At first, doubtless, he\nmust flatter and cajole, perhaps yield in some things; but he did\nnot doubt of ultimate triumph. If all other means failed, he could\njoin the bishop against the wife, inspire courage into the unhappy\nman, lay an axe to the rock of the woman's power, and emancipate\nthe husband.\n\nSuch were his thoughts as he sat looking at the sleeping pair in\nthe railway carriage, and Mr Slope is not the man to trouble\nhimself with such thoughts for nothing. He is possessed of more\nthan average abilities, and is of good courage. Though he can stoop\nto fawn, and stoop low indeed, if need be, he has still within him\nthe power to assume the tyrant; and with the power he has certainly\nthe wish. His acquirements are not of the highest order, but such\nas they are they are completely under control, and he knows the use\nof them. He is gifted with a certain kind of pulpit eloquence, not\nlikely, indeed, to be persuasive with men, but powerful with the\nsofter sex. In his sermons he deals greatly in denunciations,\nexcites the minds of his weaker hearers with a not unpleasant\nterror, and leaves an impression on their minds that all mankind\nare in a perilous state, and all womankind too, except those who\nattend regularly to the evening lectures in Baker Street. His looks\nand tones are extremely severe, so much so that one cannot but\nfancy that he regards the greater part of the world as being\ninfinitely too bad for his care. As he walks through the streets,\nhis very face denotes his horror of the world's wickedness; and\nthere is always an anathema lurking in the corner of his eye.\n\nIn doctrine, he, like his patron, is tolerant of dissent, if so\nstrict a mind can be called tolerant of anything. With\nWesleyan-Methodists he has something in common, but his soul\ntrembles in agony at the iniquities of the Puseyites. His aversion\nis carried to things outward as well as inward. His gall rises at a\nnew church with a high pitched roof; a full-breasted black silk\nwaistcoat is with him a symbol of Satan; and a profane jest-book\nwould not, in his view, more foully desecrate the church seat of a\nChristian, than a book of prayer printed with red letters, and\nornamented with a cross on the back. Most active clergymen have\ntheir hobby, and Sunday observances are his. Sunday, however, is a\nword which never pollutes his mouth--it is always 'the Sabbath'.\nThe 'desecration of the Sabbath' as he delights to call it, is to\nhim meat and drink:--he thrives upon that as policemen do on the\ngeneral evil habits of the community. It is the loved subject of\nall his evening discourses, the source of all his eloquence, the\nsecret of his power over the female heart. To him, the revelation\nof God appears in that one law given for Jewish observance. To him\nthe mercies of our Saviour speak in vain, to him in vain has been\npreached that sermon that fell from the divine lips on the\nmountain--'Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the\nearth'--'Blessed are the merciful, for the they shall obtain\nmercy'. To him the New Testament is comparatively of little moment,\nfor from it can he draw no fresh authority for that dominion which\nhe loves to exercise over at least a seventh part of man's allotted\ntime here below.\n\nMr Slope is tall, and not ill made. His feet and hands are large,\nas has ever been the case, with all his family, but he has a broad\nchest and wide shoulders to carry off these excrescences, and on\nthe whole his figure is good. His countenance, however, is not\nspecially prepossessing. His hair is lank, and of a dull pale\nreddish hue. It is always formed into three straight lumpy masses,\neach brushed with admirable precision, and cemented with much\ngrease; two of them adhere closely to the sides of his face, and\nthe other lies at right angles above them. He wears no whiskers,\nand is always punctiliously shaven. His face is nearly of the same\ncolour as his hair, though perhaps a little redder: it is not\nunlike beef,--beef, however, one would say, of a bad quality. His\nforehead is capacious and high, but square and heavy, and\nunpleasantly shining. His mouth is large, though his lips are thin\nand bloodless; and his big, prominent, pale brown eyes inspire\nanything but confidence. His nose, however, is his redeeming\nfeature: it is pronounced straight and well-formed; though I myself\nshould have liked it better if it did not possess a somewhat\nspongy, porous appearance, as though it had been cleverly formed\nout of a red coloured cork.\n\nI never could endure to shake hands with Mr Slope. A cold, clammy\nperspiration always exudes from him, the small drops are ever to be\nseen standing on his brow, and his friendly grasp is unpleasant.\n\nSuch is Mr Slope--such is the man who has suddenly fallen into the\nmidst of Barchester Close, and is destined there to assume the\nstation which has heretofore been filled by the son of the late\nbishop. Think, oh, my meditative reader, what an associate we have\nhere for those comfortable prebendaries, those gentlemanlike\nclerical doctors, those happy well-used, well-fed minor canons, who\nhave grown into existence at Barchester under the kindly wings of\nBishop Grantly!\n\nBut not as a mere associate for those does Mr Slope travel down to\nBarchester with the bishop and his wife. He intends to be, if not\ntheir master, at least the chief among them. He intends to lead,\nand to have followers; he intends to hold the purse strings of the\ndiocese, and draw round him an obedient herd of his poor and hungry\nbrethren.\n\nAnd here we can hardly fail to draw a comparison between the\narchdeacon and our new private chaplain; and despite the manifold\nfaults of the former, one can hardly fail to make it much to his\nadvantage.\n\nBoth men are eager, much too eager, to support and increase the\npower of their order. Both are anxious that the world should be\npriest-governed, though they have probably never confessed as much,\neven to themselves. Both begrudge any other kind of dominion held\nby man over man. Dr Grantly, if he admits the Queen's supremacy in\nthings spiritual, only admits it as being due to the quasi\npriesthood conveyed on the consecrating qualities of her\ncoronation; and he regards things temporal as being by their nature\nsubject to those which are spiritual. Mr Slope's ideas of\nsacerdotal rule are of a quite different class. He cares nothing,\none way or the other, for the Queen's supremacy; these to his ears\nare empty words, meaning nothing. Forms he regards but little, and\nsuch titular expressions of supremacy, consecration, ordination,\nand the like, convey of themselves no significance to him. Let him\nbe supreme who can. The temporal king, judge, or gaoler, can work\nbut on the body. The spiritual master, if he have the necessary\ngifts, and can duly use them, has a wider field of empire. He works\nupon the soul. If he can make himself be believed, he can be all\npowerful over those who listen. If he is careful to meddle with\nnone who are too strong in intellect, or too weak in flesh, he may\nindeed be supreme. And such was the ambition of Mr Slope.\n\nDr Grantly interfered very little with the worldly doings of those\nwho were in any way subject to him. I do not mean to say that he\nomitted to notice misconduct among his clergy, immorality in his\nparish, or omissions in his family; but he was not anxious to do so\nwhere the necessity could be avoided. He was not troubled with a\npropensity to be curious, and as long as those around him were\ntainted with no heretical leaning towards dissent, as long as they\nfully and freely admitted the efficacy of Mother Church, he was\nwilling that that mother should be merciful and affectionate, prone\nto indulgence, and unwilling to chastise. He himself enjoyed the\ngood things of this world, and liked to let it be known that he did\nso. He cordially despised any brother rector who thought harm of\ndinner-parties, or dreaded the dangers of a moderate claret-jug;\nconsequently dinner-parties and claret-jugs were common in the\ndiocese. He liked to give laws and to be obeyed in them implicitly,\nbut he endeavoured that his ordinances should be within the compass\nof the man, and not unpalatable to the gentleman. He had ruled\namong his clerical neighbours now for sundry years, and as he had\nmaintained his power without becoming unpopular, it may be presumed\nthat he had exercised some wisdom.\n\nOf Mr Slope's conduct much cannot be said, as his grand career is\nyet to commence; but it may be presumed that his tastes will be\nvery different from those of the archdeacon. He conceives it to be\nhis duty to know all the private doings and desires of the flock\nentrusted to his care. From the poorer classes he exacted and\nunconditional obedience to set rules of conduct, and if disobeyed\nhe has recourse, like his great ancestor, to the fulminations of an\nErnulfus: 'Thou shalt be damned in thy going in and in thy coming\nout--in thy eating and thy drinking,' &c &c &c. With the rich,\nexperience has already taught him a different line of action is\nnecessary. Men in the upper walks of life do not mind being cursed,\nand the women, presuming that it be done in delicate phrase, rather\nlike it. But he has not, therefore, given up so important a portion\nof believing Christians. With the men, indeed, he is generally at\nvariance; they are hardened sinners, on whom the voice of priestly\ncharmer often falls in vain; but with the ladies, old and young,\nfirm and frail, devout and dissipated, he is, as he conceives, all\npowerful. He can reprove faults with so much flattery, and utter\ncensure in so caressing a manner, that the female heart, if it glow\nwith a spark of low church susceptibility, cannot withstand him. In\nmany houses he is thus an admired guest: the husbands, for their\nwives' sake, are fain to admit him; and when once admitted it is\nnot easy to shake him off. He has, however, a pawing, greasy way\nwith him, which does not endear him to those who do not value him\nfor their souls' sake, and he is not a man to make himself at once\npopular in a large circle such as is now likely to surround him at\nBarchester.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nA MORNING VISIT\n\nIt was known that Dr Proudie would immediately have to reappoint to\nthe wardenship of the hospital under the act of Parliament to which\nallusion has been made; but no one imagined that any choice was\nleft to him--no one for a moment thought that he could appoint any\nother than Mr Harding. Mr Harding himself, when he heard how the\nmatter had been settled, without troubling himself much on the\nsubject, considered it as certain that he would go back to his\npleasant house and garden. And though there would be much that was\nmelancholy, nay, almost heartrending, in such a return, he still\nwas glad that it was to be so. His daughter might probably be\npersuaded to return there with him. She had, indeed, all but\npromised to do so, though she still entertained an idea that the\ngreatest of mortals, that important atom of humanity, that little\ngod upon earth, Johnny Bold her baby, ought to have a house of his\nown over his head.\n\nSuch being the state of Mr Harding's mind in the matter, he did not\nfeel any peculiar personal interest in the appointment of Dr\nProudie to the bishopric. He, as well as others at Barchester,\nregretted that a man should be sent among them who, they were\naware, was not of their way of thinking; but Mr Harding himself was\nnot a bigoted man on points of church doctrine, and he was quite\nprepared to welcome Dr Proudie to Barchester in a graceful and\nbecoming manner. He had nothing to seek and nothing to fear; he\nfelt that it behoved him to be on good terms with his bishop, and\nhe did not anticipate any obstacle that would prevent it.\n\nIn such a frame of mind he proceeded to pay his respects at the\npalace the second day after the arrival of the bishop and his\nchaplain. But he did not go alone. Dr Grantly proposed to accompany\nhim, and Mr Harding was not sorry to have a companion, who would\nremove from his shoulders the burden of conversation in such an\ninterview. In the affair of the consecration of Dr Grantly had been\nintroduced to the bishop, and Mr Harding had also been there. He\nhad, however, kept himself in the background, and he was now to be\npresented to the great man for the first time.\n\nThe archdeacon's feelings were of a much stronger nature. He was\nnot exactly the man to overlook his own slighted claims, or to\nforgive the preference shown to another. Dr Proudie was playing\nVenus to his Juno, and he was prepared to wage an internecine war\nagainst the owner of the wished for apple, and all his satellites\nprivate chaplains, and others.\n\nNevertheless, it behoved him also to conduct himself towards the\nintruder as an old archdeacon should conduct himself to an incoming\nbishop; and though he was well aware of all Dr Proudie's abominable\nopinions as regarded dissenters, church reform, the hebdomadal\ncouncil, and such like; though he disliked the man, and hated the\ndoctrines, still he was prepared to show respect to the station of\nthe bishop. So he and Mr Harding called together at the palace.\n\nHis lordship was at home, and the two visitors were shown through\nthe accustomed hall into the well-known room, where the good old\nbishop used to sit. The furniture had been bought at a valuation,\nand every chair and table, every bookshelf against the wall, and\nevery square in the carpet, was as well known to each of them as\ntheir own bedrooms. Nevertheless they at once felt that they were\nstrangers there. The furniture was for the most part the same, yet\nthe place had been metamorphosed. A new sofa had been introduced,\nand horrid chintz affair, most unprelatical and almost irreligious;\nsuch a sofa as never yet stood in the study of any decent high\nchurch clergyman of the Church of England. The old curtains had\nalso given away. They had, to be sure, become dingy, and that which\nhad been originally a rich and goodly ruby had degenerated into a\nreddish brown. Mr Harding, however, thought the old reddish brown\nmuch preferable to the gaudy buff-coloured trumpery moreen which\nMrs Proudie had deemed good enough for her husband's own room in\nthe provincial city of Barchester.\n\nOur friends found Dr Proudie sitting on the old bishop's chair,\nlooking very nice in his new apron; they found, too, Mr Slope\nstanding on the hearthrug, persuasive and eager, just as the\narchdeacon used to stand; but on the sofa they also found Mrs\nProudie, an innovation for which a precedent might be in vain be\nsought in all the annals of the Barchester bishopric!\n\nThere she was, however, and they could only make the best of her.\nThe introductions were gone through in much form. The archdeacon\nshook hands with the bishop and named Mr Harding, who received such\nan amount of greeting as was due from a bishop to a precentor. His\nlordship then presented them to his lady wife; the archdeacon\nfirst, with archidiaconal honours, and then the precentor with\ndiminished parade. After this Mr Slope presented himself. The\nbishop, it is true, did mention his name, and so did Mrs Proudie\ntoo, in a louder tone; but Mr Slope took it upon himself the chief\nburden of his own introduction. He had great pleasure in making\nhimself acquainted with Dr Grantly; he had heard much of the\narchdeacon's good works in that part of the diocese in which his\nduties as archdeacon had been exercised (thus purposely ignoring\nthe archdeacon's hitherto unlimited dominion over the diocese at\nlarge). He was aware that his lordship depended greatly on the\nassistance which Dr Grantly would be able to give him in that\nportion of the diocese. He then thrust out his hand, and grasping\nthat of his new foe, bedewed it unmercifully. Dr Grantly in return\nbowed, looked stiff, contracted his eyebrows, and wiped his hand\nwith his pocket-handkerchief. Nothing abashed, Mr Slope then\nnoticed the precentor, and descended to the grade of the lower\nclergy. He gave him a squeeze of the hand, damp indeed, but\naffectionate, and was very glad to make the acquaintance of Mr -;\noh, yes, Mr Harding; he had not exactly caught the name--\n'Precentor in the cathedral' surmised Mr Slope. Mr Harding\nconfessed that such was the humble sphere of his work. 'Some parish\nduties as well,' suggested Mr Slope. Mr Harding acknowledged the\ndiminutive incumbency of St Cuthbert's. Mr Slope then left him\nalone, having condescended sufficiently, and joined the\nconversation among the higher powers.\n\nThere were four persons there, each of whom considered himself the\nmost important personage in the diocese; himself indeed, or\nherself, as Mrs Proudie was one of them; and with such a difference\nof opinion it was not probable that they would get on pleasantly\ntogether. The bishop himself actually wore the visible apron, and\ntrusted mainly to that--to that and to his title, both being facts\nwhich could not be overlooked. The archdeacon knew his subject, and\nreally understood the business of bishoping, which the others did\nnot; and this was his strong ground. Mrs Proudie had her sex to\nback her, and her habit of command, and was nothing daunted by the\nhigh tone of Dr Grantly's face and figure. Mr Slope had only\nhimself and his own courage and tact to depend on, but he\nnevertheless was perfectly self-assured, and did not doubt but that\nhe should soon get the better of weak men who trusted so much to\nexternals, as both bishop and archdeacon appeared to do.\n\n'Do you reside in Barchester, Dr Grantly?' asked the lady with the\nsweetest smile.\n\nDr Grantly explained that he lived in his own parish of Plumstead\nEpiscopi, a few miles out of the city. Whereupon the lady hoped\nthat the distance was not too great for country visiting, as she\nwould be so glad to make the acquaintance of Mrs Grantly. She would\ntake the earliest opportunity, after the arrival of her horses at\nBarchester; their horses were at present in London; their horses\nwere not immediately coming down, as the bishop would be obliged in\na few days, to return to town. Dr Grantly was no doubt aware that\nthe bishop was at present much called upon by the 'University\nImprovement Committee': indeed, the Committee could not well\nproceed without him, as their final report had now to be drawn up.\nThe bishop had also to prepare a scheme for the 'Manufacturing\nTowns Morning and Evening Sunday School Society', of which he was a\npatron, or president, or director, and therefore the horses would\nnot come down to Barchester at present; but whenever the horses did\ncome down, she would take the earliest opportunity of calling at\nPlumstead Episcopi, providing the distance was not too great for\ncountry visiting.\n\nThe archdeacon made his fifth bow: he had made one at each mention\nof the horses; and promised that Mrs Grantly would do herself the\nhonour of calling at the palace on an early day. Mrs Proudie\ndeclared that she would be delighted: she hadn't liked to ask, not\nbeing quite sure whether Mrs Grantly had horses; besides, the\ndistance might have been &c, &c.\n\nDr Grantly again bowed, but said nothing. He could have bought\nevery single individual possession of the whole family of the\nProudies, and have restored them as a gift, without much feeling\nthe loss; and had kept a separate pair of horses for the exclusive\nuse of his wife since the day of their marriage; whereas Mrs\nProudie had been hitherto jobbed about the streets of London at so\nmuch a month during the season; and at other times had managed to\nwalk, or hire a smart fly from the livery stables.\n\n'Are the arrangements with reference to the Sabbath-day schools\ngenerally pretty good in your archdeaconry?'\n\n'Sabbath-day schools!' repeated the archdeacon with an affectation\nof surprise. 'Upon my word, I can't tell; it depends mainly on the\nparson's wife and daughters. There is none at Plumstead.'\n\nThis was almost a fib on the part of the Archdeacon, for Mrs\nGrantly has a very nice school. To be sure it is not a Sunday\nSchool exclusively, and is not so designated; but that exemplary\nlady always attends there an hour before church, and hears the\nchildren say their catechism, and sees that they are clean and tidy\nfor church, with their hands washed, and their shoes tied; and\nGrisel and Florinda, her daughters, carry thither a basket of large\nbuns, baked on the Saturday afternoon, and distribute them to all\nthe children not especially under disgrace, which buns are carried\nhome after church with considerable content, and eaten hot at tea,\nbeing then split and toasted. The children of Plumstead would\nindeed open their eyes if they heard their venerated pastor declare\nthat there were no Sunday schools in the parish.\n\nMr Slope merely opened his eyes wider, and slightly shrugged his\nshoulders. He was not, however, prepared to give up his darling\nproject.\n\n'I fear there is a great deal of Sabbath travelling here,' said he,\n'on looking at the 'Bradshaw', I see that there are three trains in\nand three trains out every Sabbath. Could nothing be done to induce\nthe company to withdraw them? Don't you think, Dr Grantly, that a\nlittle energy might diminish the evil?'\n\n'Not being a director, I really can't say. But if you can withdraw\nthe passengers, their company, I dare say, will withdraw the\ntrains,' said the doctor. 'It's merely a question of dividends.'\n\n'But surely, Dr Grantly,' said the lady, 'surely we should look at\nit differently. You and I, for instance, in our position: surely we\nshould do all that we can to control so grievous a sin. Don't you\nthink so, Mr Harding?' and she turned to the precentor, who was\nsitting mute and unhappy.\n\nMr Harding thought that all porters and stokers, guards, breaksmen,\npointsmen ought to have an opportunity of going to church, and he\nhoped that they all had.\n\n'But surely, surely,' continued Mrs Proudie, 'surely that is not\nenough. Surely that will not secure such an observance of the\nSabbath as we are taught to conceive is not only expedient by\nindispensable; surely--'\n\nCome what come might, Dr Grantly was not to be forced into a\ndissertation on a point of doctrine with Mrs Proudie, nor yet with\nMr Slope; so without much ceremony he turned his back upon the\nsofa, and began to hope that Dr Proudie had found the palace\nrepairs had been such as to meet his wishes.\n\n'Yes, yes,' said his lordship; upon the whole he thought so--upon\nthe whole, he didn't know that there was much ground for complaint;\nthe architect, perhaps, might have--but his double, Mr Slope, who\nhad sidled over to the bishop's chair, would not allow his lordship\nto finish his ambiguous speech.\n\n'There is one point I would like to mention, Mr Archdeacon. His\nlordship asked me to step through the premises, and I see that the\nstalls in the second stable are not perfect.'\n\n'Why--there's standing for a dozen horses,'said the archdeacon.\n\n'Perhaps so,' said the other; 'indeed, I've no doubt of it; but\nvisitors, you know, often require so much accommodation. There are\nmany of the bishop's relatives who always bring their own horses.'\n\nDr Grantly promised that due provision for the relatives' horses\nshould be made, as far at least as the extent of the original\nstable building would allow. He would himself communicate with the\narchitect.\n\n'And the coach-house, Dr Grantly,' continued Mr Slope; 'there is\nreally hardly any room for a second carriage in the large\ncoach-house, and the smaller one, of course, holds only one.'\n\n'And the gas,' chimed in the lady; 'there is no gas through the\nhouse, none whatever, but in the kitchen and passages. Surely the\npalace should have been fitted through with pipes for gas, and hot\nwater too. There is no hot water laid on anywhere above the ground\nfloor. Surely there should be the means of getting hot water in the\nbed-rooms without having it brought in jugs from the kitchen.'\n\nThe bishop had a decided opinion that there should be pipes for hot\nwater. Hot water was very essential for the comfort of the palace.\nIt was, indeed, a requisite in any decent gentleman's house.\n\nMr Slope had remarked that the coping on the garden wall was in\nmany places imperfect.\n\nMrs Proudie had discovered a large hole, evidently the work of\nrats, in the servants' hall.\n\nThe bishop expressed an utter detestation of rats. There was\nnothing, he believed, in this world, that he so much hated as a\nrat.\n\nMr Slope had, moreover, observed that the locks of the out-houses\nwere very imperfect: he might specify the coal-cellar, and the\nwood-house.\n\nMrs Proudie had also seen that those on the doors of the servants'\nbedrooms were in an equally bad condition; indeed the locks all\nthrough the house were old-fashioned and unserviceable.\n\nThe bishop thought that a great deal depended on a good lock, and\nquite as much on the key. He had observed that the fault very often\nlay with the key, especially if the wards were in any way twisted.\n\nMr Slope was going on with his catalogue of grievances, when he was\nsomewhat loudly interrupted by the archdeacon who succeeded in\nexplaining that the diocesan architect, or rather his foreman, was\nthe person to be addressed on such subjects; and that he, Dr\nGrantly, had inquired as to the comfort of the palace, merely as a\npoint of compliment. He was very sorry, however, that so many\nthings had been found amiss: and then he rose from his chair to\nescape.\n\nMrs Proudie, though she had contrived to lend her assistance in\nrecapitulating the palatial dilapidations, had not on that account\ngiven up her hold of Mr Harding, nor ceased from her\ncross-examination as the iniquity of Sabbatical amusements. Over\nand over again had she thrown out her 'surely, surely,' at Mr\nHarding's devoted head, and ill had that gentleman been able to\nparry the attack.\n\nHe had never before found himself subjected to such a nuisance.\nLadies hitherto, when they had consulted him on religious subjects,\nhad listened to what he might choose to say with some deference,\nand had differed, it they differed, in silence. But Mrs Proudie\ninterrogated him, and then lectured. 'Neither thou, nor thy son,\nnor thy daughter, nor thy man servant, nor thy maid servant,' said\nshe, impressively, and more than once, as though Mr Harding had\nforgotten the words. She shook her finger at him as she quoted the\nfavourite law, as though menacing him with punishment; and then\ncalled upon him categorically to state whether he did not think\nthat travelling on the Sabbath was an abomination and a\ndesecration.\n\nMr Harding had never been so hard pressed in his life. He felt that\nhe ought to rebuke the lady for presuming so to talk to a gentleman\nand a clergyman so may years her senior; but he recoiled from the\nidea of scolding the bishop's wife, in the bishop's presence, on\nhis first visit to the palace; moreover, to tell the truth, he was\nsomewhat afraid of her. She, seeing him sit silent and absorbed, by\nno means refrained from the attack.\n\n'I hope, Mr Harding,' said she, shaking her head slowly and\nsolemnly, 'I hope you will not leave me to think that you approve\nof Sabbath travelling,' and she looked a look of unutterable\nmeaning into his eyes.\n\nThere was no standing for this, for Mr Slope was now looking at\nhim, and so was the bishop, and so was the archdeacon, who had\ncompleted his adieux on that side of the room. Mr Harding therefore\ngot up also, and putting out his hand to Mrs Proudie, said: 'If you\nwill come to St Cuthbert's some Sunday, I will preach you a sermon\non the subject.'\n\nAnd so the archdeacon and the precentor took their departure,\nbowing low to the lady, shaking hands with the lord, and escaping\nfrom Mr Slope in the best manner each could. Mr Harding was again\nmaltreated; but Dr Grantly swore deeply in the bottom of his heart,\nthat no earthly consideration should ever again induce him to touch\nthe paw of that impure and filthy animal.\n\nAnd now, had I the pen of a might poet, would I sing in epic verse\nthe noble wrath of the archdeacon. The palace steps descend to a\nbroad gravel sweep, from whence a small gate opens out into the\nstreet, very near the covered gateway leading to the close. The\nroad from the palace door turns to the left, through the spacious\ngardens, and terminates on the London-road, half a mile from the\ncathedral.\n\nTill they had passed this small gate and entered the close, neither\nof them spoke a word; but the precentor clearly saw from his\ncompanion's face that a tornado was to be expected, nor was he\nhimself inclined to stop it. Though, by nature far less irritable\nthan the archdeacon, even he was angry: he even--that mild and\ncourteous man--was inclined to express himself in anything but\ncourteous terms.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nWAR\n\n'Good heavens!' exclaimed the archdeacon, as he placed his foot on\nthe gravel walk of the close, and raising his hat with one hand,\npassed the other somewhat violently over his now grizzled locks;\nsmoke issued from the uplifted beaver as it were a cloud of wrath,\nand the safety-valve of his anger opened, and emitted a visible\nsteam, preventing positive explosion and probably apoplexy. 'Good\nheavens!'--and the archdeacon looked up to the gray pinnacles of\nthe cathedral tower, making a mute appeal to that still living\nwitness which had looked down on the doings of so many bishops of\nBarchester.\n\n'I don't think I shall ever like that Mr Slope,' said Mr Harding.\n\n'Like him!' roared the archdeacon, standing still for a moment to\ngive more force to his voice; 'like him!' All the ravens of the\nclose cawed their assent. The old bells of the tower, in chiming\nthe hour, echoed the words; and the swallows flying out from their\nnests mutely expressed a similar opinion. Like Mr Slope! Why no, it\nwas not very probable that any Barchester-bred living thing should\nlike Mr Slope!\n\n'Nor Mrs Proudie either,' said Mr Harding.\n\nThe archdeacon thereupon forgot himself. I will not follow his\nexample, nor shock my readers by transcribing the term in which he\nexpressed his feelings as to the lady who had been named. The\nravens and the last lingering notes of the clock bells were less\nscrupulous, and repeated in corresponding echoes the very improper\nexclamation. The archdeacon again raised his hat; and another\nsalutary escape of steam was effected.\n\nThere was a pause, during which the precentor tried to realise the\nfact that the wife of the bishop of Barchester had been thus\ndesignated, in the close of the cathedral, by the lips of its own\narchdeacon: but he could not do it.\n\n'The bishop seems a quiet man enough,' suggested Mr Harding, having\nacknowledged to himself his own failure.\n\n'Idiot!' exclaimed the doctor, who for the nonce was not capable of\nmore than spasmodic attempts at utterance.\n\n'Well, he did not seem very bright,' said Mr Harding, 'and yet he\nhas always had the reputation of a clever man. I suppose he's\ncautious and not inclined to express himself very freely.'\n\nThe new bishop of Barchester was already so contemptible a creature\nin Dr Grantly's eyes, that he could not condescend to discuss his\ncharacter. He was a puppet to be played by others; a mere wax doll,\ndone up in an apron and a shovel hat, to be stuck on a throne or\nelsewhere and pulled about by wires as others chose. Dr Grantly did\nnot choose to let himself down low enough to talk about Dr Proudie;\nbut he saw that he would have to talk about the other members of\nhis household, the coadjutor bishops, who had brought his lordship\ndown, as it were, in a box, and were about to handle the wires as\nthey willed. This in itself was a terrible vexation to the\narchdeacon. Could he have ignored the chaplain, and have fought the\nbishop, there would have been, at any rate, nothing degrading in\nsuch a contest. Let the Queen make whom she would bishop of\nBarchester; a man, or even an ape, when once a bishop, would be a\nrespectable adversary, if he would but fight, himself. But what was\nsuch a person as Dr Grantly to do, when such another person as Mr\nSlope was put forward as his antagonist?\n\nIf he, our archdeacon, refused to combat, Mr Slope would walk\ntriumphant over the field, and have the diocese of Barchester under\nhis heel.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the archdeacon accepted as his enemy the man\nwhom the new puppet bishop put before him as such, he would have to\ntalk about Mr Slope, and write about Mr Slope, and in all matters\ntreat with Mr Slope, as a being standing, in some degree, on ground\nsimilar to his own. He would have to meet Mr Slope; to--Bah! The\nidea was sickening. He could not bring himself to have to do with\nMr Slope.\n\n'He is the most thoroughly bestial creature that ever I set my eyes\nupon,' said the archdeacon.\n\n'Who--the bishop?'\n\n'Bishop! No--I'm not talking about the bishop. How on earth such a\ncreature got ordained!--they'll ordain anybody now, I know; but\nhe's been in the church these ten years; and they used to be a\nlittle careful ten years ago.'\n\n'Oh! You mean Mr Slope.'\n\n'Did you ever see any animal less like a gentleman?'\n\n'I can't say I felt myself much disposed to like him.'\n\n'Like him!' again shouted the doctor, and the assenting ravens\nagain cawed an echo; 'of course you don't like him; it's not a\nquestion of liking. But what are we to do with him?'\n\n'Do with him?' asked Mr Harding.\n\n'Yes--what are we to do with him? How are we to treat him? There he\nis, and there he'll stay. He has put his foot in that palace, and\nhe will never take it out again till he's driven. How are we to get\nrid of him?'\n\n'I don't suppose he can do us much harm.'\n\n'Not do harm!--Well I think you'll find yourself of a different\nopinion before a month is gone. What would you say now, if he got\nhimself put into the hospital? Would that be harm?'\n\nMr Harding mused awhile, and then said he didn't think the new\nbishop would put Mr Slope into the hospital.\n\n'If he doesn't put him there, he'll put him somewhere else where\nhe'll be as bad. I tell you that that man, to all intents and\npurposes, will be Bishop of Barchester;' and again, Dr Grantly\nraised his hat, and rubbed his hand thoughtfully and sadly over his\nhead.\n\n'Impudent scoundrel!' he exclaimed after a while. 'To dare to\ncross-examine me about Sunday schools in the diocese, and Sunday\ntravelling too: I never in my life met his equal for sheer\nimpudence. Why, he must have thought we were two candidates for\nordination.'\n\n'I declare I thought Mrs Proudie the worst of the two,' said Mr\nHarding.\n\n'When a woman is impertinent one must only put up with it, and keep\nout of her way in future; but I am not inclined to put up with Mr\nSlope. \"Sabbath travelling!\"' and the doctor attempted to imitate\nthe peculiar drawl of the man he so much disliked: '\"Sabbath\ntravelling!\" Those are the sort of men who will ruin the Church of\nEngland, and make the profession of clergyman disreputable. It is\nnot the dissenters or the papists that we should fear, but the set\nof canting, low-bred hypocrites who are wriggling their way in\namong us; men who have no fixed principle, no standard ideas of\nreligion or doctrine, but who take up some popular cry, as this\nfellow has done about \"Sabbath travelling.\"'\n\nDr Grantly did not again repeat the question aloud, but he did so\nconstantly to himself, 'What were they to do with Mr Slope?' How\nwas he openly, before the world, to show that he utterly\ndisapproved of and abhorred such a man?\n\nHitherto Barchester had escaped the taint of any extreme rigour of\nchurch doctrine. The clergymen of the city and the neighbourhood,\nthough very well inclined to promote high-church principles,\nprivileges, and prerogatives, had never committed themselves to\ntendencies, which are somewhat too loosely called Puseyite\npractices. They all preached in their black gowns, as their fathers\nhad done before them; they wore ordinary black cloth waistcoats;\nthey had not candles on their altars, either lighted or unlighted;\nthey made no private genuflexions, and were contented to confine\nthemselves to such ceremonial observances as had been in vogue for\nthe last hundred years. The services were decently and demurely\nread in their parish churches, chanting was confined to the\ncathedral, and the science of intoning was unknown. One young man\nwho had come direct from Oxford as a curate at Plumstead had, after\nthe lapse of two or three Sundays, made a faint attempt, much to\nthe bewilderment of the poorer part of the congregation. Dr Grantly\nhad not been present on the occasion; but Mrs Grantly, who had her\nown opinion on the subject, immediately after the service expressed\na hope that the young gentleman had not been taken ill, and offered\nto send him all kinds of condiments supposed to be good for a sore\nthroat. After that there had been no more intoning at Plumstead\nEpiscopi.\n\nBut now the archdeacon began to meditate on some strong measures of\nabsolute opposition. Dr Proudie and his crew were of the lowest\npossible order of Church of England clergymen, and therefore it\nbehoved him, Dr Grantly, to be of the very highest. Dr Proudie\nwould abolish all forms and ceremonies, and therefore Dr Grantly\nfelt the sudden necessity of multiplying them. Dr Proudie would\nconsent to deprive the church of all collective authority and rule,\nand therefore Dr Grantly would stand up for the full power of\nconvocation, and the renewal of its ancient privileges.\n\nIt was true that he could not himself intone the service, but he\ncould pressure the co-operation of any number of gentlemanlike\ncurates well trained in the mystery of doing so. He would not\nwillingly alter his own fashion of dress, but he could people\nBarchester with young clergymen dressed in the longest frocks, and\nthe highest breasted silk waistcoats. He certainly was not prepared\nto cross himself, or to advocate the real presence; but, without\ngoing this length, there were various observances, by adopting\nwhich he could plainly show his antipathy to such men as Dr Proudie\nand Mr Slope.\n\nAll these things passed through his mind as he paced up and down\nthe close with Mr Harding. War, war, internecine war was in his\nheart. He felt that as regarded himself and Mr Slope, one of the\ntwo must be annihilated as far as the city of Barchester was\nconcerned; and he did not intend to give way until there was not\nleft to him an inch of ground on which he could stand. He still\nflattered himself that he could make Barchester too hot to hold Mr\nSlope, and he had no weakness of spirit to prevent his bringing\nabout such consummation if it were in his power.\n\n'I suppose Susan must call at the palace,' said Mr Harding.\n\n'Yes, she shall call there; but it shall be once and once only. I\ndare say \"the horses\" won't find it convenient to come to Plumstead\nvery soon, and when that once is done the matter may drop.'\n\n'I don't suppose Eleanor need call. I don't think Eleanor would get\non at all well with Mrs Proudie.'\n\n'Not the least necessity in life,' replied the archdeacon, not\nwithout the reflection that a ceremony which was necessary for his\nwife, might not be at all binding on the widow of John Bold. 'Not\nthe slightest reason on earth why she should do so, if she doesn't\nlike it. For myself, I don't think that any decent young woman\nshould be subjected to the nuisance of being in the same room with\nthat man.'\n\nAnd so the two clergymen parted. Mr Harding going to his daughter's\nhouse, and the archdeacon seeking the seclusion of his brougham.\n\nThe new inhabitants of the palace did not express any higher\nopinion of their visitors than their visitors had expressed of\nthem. Though they did not use quite such strong language as Dr\nGrantly had done, they felt as much personal aversion, and were\nquite as well aware as he was that there would be a battle to be\nfought, and that there was hardly room for Proudieism in Barchester\nas long as Grantlyism was predominant.\n\nIndeed, it may be doubted whether Mr Slope had not already within\nhis breast a better prepared system of strategy, a more\naccurately-defined line of hostile conduct than the archdeacon. Dr\nGrantly was going to fight because he found that he hated the man.\nMr Slope had predetermined to hate the man because he foresaw the\nnecessity of fighting him. When he had first reviewed the carte de\npays, previous to his entry into Barchester, the idea had occurred\nto him of conciliating the archdeacon, of cajoling and flattering\nhim into submission, and of obtaining the upper hand by cunning\ninstead of courage. A little inquiry, however, sufficed to convince\nhim that all his cunning would fail to win over such a man as Dr\nGrantly to such a mode of action as that to be adopted by Mr Slope;\nand then he determined to fall back upon his courage. He at once\nsaw that open battle against Dr Grantly and all Dr Grantly's\nadherents was a necessity of his position, and he deliberately\nplanned the most expedient method of giving offence.\n\nSoon after his arrival the bishop had intimated to the dean that,\nwith the permission of the canon then in residence, his chaplain\nwould preach in the cathedral on the next Sunday. The canon in\nresidence happened to be the Honourable and Reverend Dr Vesey\nStanhope, who at this time was very busy on the shores of Lake\nComo, adding to that unique collection of butterflies for which he\nis so famous. Or, rather, he would have been in residence but for\nthe butterflies and other such summer-day considerations; and the\nvicar-choral, who was to take his place in the pulpit, by no means\nobjected to having his word done for him by Mr Slope.\n\nMr Slope accordingly preached, and if a preacher can have\nsatisfaction in being listened to, Mr Slope ought to have been\ngratified. I have reason to think that he was gratified, and that\nhe left the pulpit with the conviction that he had done what he\nintended to do when he entered it.\n\nOn this occasion the new bishop took his seat for the first time in\nthe throne allotted to him. New scarlet cushions and drapery had\nbeen prepared, with new gilt binding and new fringe. The old carved\noak-wood of the throne, ascending with its numerous grotesque\npinnacles, half-way up to the rood of the choir, had been washed,\nand dusted, and rubbed, and it all looked very smart. Ah! How often\nsitting there, in happy early days, on those lowly benches in front\nof the altar, have I whiled away the tedium of a sermon considering\nhow best I might thread my way up amidst those wooden towers, and\nclimb safely to the topmost pinnacle!\n\nAll Barchester went to hear Mr Slope; either for that or to gaze at\nthe new bishop. All the best bonnets of the city were there, and\nmoreover all the best glossy clerical hats. Not a stall but had its\nfitting occupant; for though some of the prebendaries might be away\nin Italy or elsewhere, their places were filled by brethren, who\nflocked into Barchester on the occasion. The dean was there, a\nheavy old man, now too old, indeed, to attend frequently in his\nplace; and so was the archdeacon. So also were the chancellor, the\ntreasurer, the precentor, sundry canons and minor canons, and every\nlay member of the choir, prepared to sing the new bishop in with\ndue melody and harmonious expression of sacred welcome.\n\nThe service was certainly well performed. Such was always the case\nat Barchester, as the musical education of the choir had been good,\nand the voices had been carefully selected. The psalms were\nbeautifully chanted; the Te Deum was magnificently sung; and the\nlitany was given in a manner, which is still to be found at\nBarchester, but, if my taste be correct, is to be found nowhere\nelse. The litany of Barchester cathedral has long been the special\ntask to which Mr Harding's skill and voice have been devoted.\nCrowded audiences generally make good performers, and though Mr\nHarding was not aware of any extraordinary exertion on his part,\nyet probably he rather exceeded his usual mark. Others were doing\ntheir best, and it was natural that he should emulate his brethren.\nSo the service went on, and at last Mr Slope got into the pulpit.\n\nHe chose for his text a verse from the precept addressed by St Paul\nto Timothy, as to the conduct necessary in a spiritual pastor and\nguide, and it was immediately evident that the good clergy of\nBarchester were to have a lesson.\n\n'Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth\nnot to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.' These were\nthe words of the text, and with such a subject in such a place, it\nmay be supposed that such a preacher would be listened to by such\nan audience. He was listened to with breathless attention, and not\nwithout considerable surprise. Whatever opinion of Mr Slope might\nhave been held in Barchester before he commenced, his discourse,\nnone of his hearers, when it was over, could mistake him for either\na fool or a coward.\n\nIt would not be becoming were I to travesty a sermon, or even\nrepeat the language of it in the pages of a novel. In endeavouring\nto depict the characters of the persons of whom I write, I am to a\ncertain extent forced to speak of sacred things. I trust, however,\nthat I shall not be thought to scoff at the pulpit, though some may\nimagine that I do not feel the reverence that is due to the cloth.\nI may question the infallibility of the teachers, but I hope that I\nshall not therefore be accused of doubt as to the thing to be\ntaught.\n\nMr Slope, in commencing his sermon, showed no slight tact in his\nambiguous manner of hinting that, humble as he was himself, he\nstood there as the mouthpiece of the illustrious divine who sat\nopposite to him; and having presumed so much, he gave forth a very\naccurate definition of the conduct which that prelate would rejoice\nto see in the clergymen now brought under his jurisdiction. It is\nonly necessary to say, that the peculiar points insisted on were\nexactly those which were most distasteful to the clergy of the\ndiocese, and most averse to their practices and opinions; and that\nall those peculiar habits and privileges which have always been\ndear to high-church priests, to that party which is now\nscandalously called the high-and-dry church, were ridiculed,\nabused, and anathematised. Now, the clergymen of the diocese of\nBarchester are all of the high-and-dry church.\n\nHaving thus, according to his own opinion, explained how a\nclergyman should show himself approved unto God, as a workman that\nneedeth not to be ashamed, he went on to explain how the word of\ntruth should be divided; and here he took a rather narrow view of\nthe question; and fetched arguments from afar. His object was to\nexpress his abomination of all ceremonious modes of utterance, to\ncry down any religious feeling which might be excited, not by the\nsense, but by the sound of words, and in fact to insult the\ncathedral practices. Had St Paul spoken of rightly pronouncing\ninstead of rightly dividing the word of truth, this part of his\nsermon would have been more to the purpose; but the preacher's\nimmediate object was to preach Mr Slope's doctrine, and not St\nPaul's, and he contrived to give the necessary twist to the text\nwith some skill.\n\nHe could not exactly say, preaching from a cathedral pulpit, that\nchanting should be abandoned in cathedral services. By such an\nassertion, he would have overshot his mark and rendered himself\nabsurd, to the delight of his hearers. He could, however, and did,\nallude with heavy denunciations to the practice of intoning in\nparish churches, although the practice was not but unknown in the\ndiocese; and from thence he came round to the undue preponderance,\nwhich he asserted, music over meaning in the beautiful service\nwhich they had just heard. He was aware, he said, that the\npractices of our ancestors could not be abandoned at a moment's\nnotice; the feelings of the aged would be outraged, and the minds\nof respectable men would be shocked. There were many, he was aware,\nof not sufficient calibre of thought to perceive, of not sufficient\neducation to know, that a mode of service, which was effective when\noutward ceremonies were of more moment than inward feelings, had\nbecome all but barbarous at a time when inward conviction was\neverything, when each word of the minister's lips should fall\nintelligibly into the listener's heart. Formerly the religion of\nthe multitude had been an affair of the imagination: now, in these\nlatter days, it had become necessary that a Christian should have a\nreason for his faith--should not only believe, but digest--not only\nhear, but understand. The words of our morning service, how\nbeautiful, how apposite, how intelligible they were, when read with\nsimple and distinct decorum! But how much of the meaning of the\nwords was lost when they were produced with all the meretricious\ncharms of melody! &c &c.\n\nHere was a sermon to be preached before Mr Archdeacon Grantly, Mr\nPrecentor Harding, and the rest of them! Before a whole dean and\nchapter assembled in their own cathedral! Before men who had grown\nold in the exercise of their peculiar services, with a full\nconviction of their excellence for all intended purposes! This too\nfrom such a man, a clerical parvenu, a man without a cure, a mere\nchaplain, an intruder among them; a fellow raked up, so said Dr\nGrantly, from the gutters of Marylebone! They had to sit through\nit! None of them, not even Dr Grantly, could close his ears, nor\nleave the house of God during the hours of service. They were under\nan obligation of listening, and that too, without any immediate\npower of reply.\n\nThere is, perhaps, no greater hardship at present inflicted on\nmankind in civilised and free countries than the necessity of\nlistening to sermons. No one but a preaching clergyman has, in\nthese realms, the power of compelling audiences to sit silent, and\nbe tormented. No one but a preaching clergyman can revel in\nplatitudes, truisms, and untruisms, (sic) and yet receive, as his\nundisputed privilege, the same respectful demeanour as though words\nof impassioned eloquence, or persuasive logic, fell from his lips.\nLet a professor of law or physic find his place in a lecture-room,\nand there pour forth jejune words and useless empty phrases, and he\nwill pour them forth to empty benches. Let a barrister attempt to\ntalk without talking well, and he will talk but seldom. A judge's\ncharge need be listened to per force by none but the jury,\nprisoner, and gaoler (sic). A member of parliament can be coughed\ndown or counted out. Town-councillors can be tabooed. But no one\ncan rid himself of the preaching clergyman. He is the bore of the\nage, the old man whom we Sindbads cannot shake off, the nightmare\nthat disturbs our Sunday's rest, the incubus that overloads our\nreligion and makes God's service distasteful. We are not forced\ninto church! No: but we desire more than that. We desire not to be\nforced to stay away. We desire, nay, we are resolute, to enjoy the\ncomfort of public worship; but we desire also that we may do so\nwithout an amount of tedium which ordinary human nature cannot\nendure with patience; that we may be able to leave the house of God\nwithout that anxious longing for escape, which is the common\nconsequence of common sermons.\n\nWith what complacency will a young parson deduce false conclusions\nfrom misunderstood texts, and then threaten us with all the\npenalties of Hades if we neglect to comply with the injunctions he\nhas given us! Yes, my too self-confident juvenile friend, I do\nbelieve in those mysteries, which are so common in your mouth; I do\nbelieve in the unadulterated word which you hold there in your\nhand; but you must pardon me if, in some things, I doubt your\ninterpretation. The bible is good, the prayer-book is good, nay,\nyou yourself would be acceptable, if you would read to me some\nportion of those time-honoured discourses which our great divines\nhave elaborated in the full maturity of their powers. But you must\nexcuse me, my insufficient young lecturer, if I yawn over your\nimperfect sentences, your repeated phrases, your false pathos, your\ndrawlings (sic) and denouncings (sic), your humming and hawing,\nyour oh-ing and ah-ing, your black gloves and your white\nhandkerchief. To me, it all means nothing; and hours are too\nprecious to be so wasted--if one could only avoid it.\n\nAnd here I must make a protest against the pretence, so often put\nforward by the working clergy, that they are overburdened by the\nmultitude of sermons to be preached. We are all too fond of our own\nvoices, and a preacher is encouraged in the vanity of making his\nheard by the privilege of a compelled audience. His sermon is the\npleasant morsel of his life, his delicious moment of\nself-exaltation. 'I have preached nine sermons this week, four the\nweek before. I have preached twenty-three sermons this month. It is\nreally too much.' 'Too much for the strength of any one.' 'Yes,' he\nanswered meekly, 'indeed it is; I am beginning to feel it\npainfully.' 'Would,' said I, 'you could feel it--would that you\ncould be made to feel it.' But he never guessed that my heart was\nwrung for the poor listeners.\n\nThere was, at any rate, no tedium felt in listening to Mr Slope on\nthe occasion in question. His subject came too home to his audience\nto be dull; and, to tell the truth, Mr Slope had the gift of using\nwords forcibly. He was heard through his thirty minutes of\neloquence with mute attention and open ears; but with angry eyes,\nwhich glared found form one enraged parson to another, with\nwide-spread nostrils from which already burst forth fumes of\nindignation, and with many shufflings (sic) of the feet and uneasy\nmotions of the body, which betokened minds disturbed, and hearts\nnot at peace with all the world.\n\nAt last the bishop, who, of all the congregation, had been most\nsurprised, and whose hair almost stood on end with terror, gave the\nblessing in a manner not at all equal to that in which he had long\nbeen practising it in his own study, and the congregation was free\nto go their way.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nTHE DEAN AND CHAPTER TAKE COUNSEL\n\nAll Barchester was in a tumult. Dr Grantly could hardly get himself\nout of the cathedral porch before he exploded in his wrath. The old\ndean betook himself silently to his deanery, afraid to speak; and\nthere sat, half stupefied, pondering many things in vain. Mr\nHarding crept forth solitary and unhappy; and, slowly passing\nbeneath the elms of the close, could scarcely bring himself to\nbelieve that the words which he had heard had proceeded from the\npulpit of the Barchester Cathedral. Was he again to be disturbed?\nWas his whole life to be shown up as a useless sham a second time?\nwould he have to abdicate his precentorship, as he had his\nwardenship, and to give up chanting, as he had given up his twelve\nold bedesmen? And what if he did! Some other Jupiter, some other Mr\nSlope, would come and turn him out of St Cuthbert's. Surely he\ncould not have been wrong all his life in chanting the litany as he\nhad done! He began, however, to have doubts. Doubting himself was\nMr Harding's weakness. It is not, however, the usual fault of his\norder.\n\nYes! All Barchester was in a tumult. It was not only the clergy who\nwere affected. The laity also had listened to Mr Slope's new\ndoctrine, all with surprise, some with indignation, and some with a\nmixed feeling, in which dislike of the preacher was not so strongly\nblended. The old bishop and his chaplain, the dean and his canons\nand minor canons, the old choir, and especially Mr Harding who was\nat the head of it, had all been popular in Barchester. They had\nspent their money and done good; the poor had not been ground down;\nthe clergy in society had neither been overbearing nor austere; and\nthe whole repute of the city was due to its ecclesiastical\nimportance. Yet there were those who had heard Mr Slope with\nsatisfaction.\n\nIt is so pleasant to receive a fillip of excitement when suffering\nfrom the dull routine of everyday life! The anthems and Te Deums\nwere in themselves delightful, but they had been heard so often! Mr\nSlope was certainly not delightful, but he was new, and, moreover,\nclever. They had long thought it slow, so said now may of the\nBarchesterians, to go on as they had done in their old humdrum way,\ngiving ear to none of the religious changes which were moving the\nworld without. People in advance of the age now had new ideas, and\nit was quite time that Barchester should go in advance. Mr Slope\nmight be right. Sunday certainly had to been strictly kept in\nBarchester, except as regarded the cathedral services. Indeed the\ntwo hours between services had long been appropriated to morning\ncalls and hot luncheons. Then Sunday schools; Sabbath-day schools\nMr Slope had called them. The late bishop had really not thought of\nSunday schools as he should have done. (These people probably did\nnot reflect that catechisms and collects are quite hard work to the\nyoung mind as book-keeping is to the elderly; and that quite as\nlittle feeling of worship enters into one task as the other.) And\nthen, as regarded that great question of musical services, there\nmight be much to be said on Mr Slope's side of the question. It\ncertainly was the fact, that people went to the cathedral to hear\nthe music &c &c.\n\nAnd so a party absolutely formed itself in Barchester on Mr Slope's\nside of the question! This consisted, among the upper classes,\nchiefly of ladies. No man--that is, no gentleman--could possibly be\nattracted by Mr Slope, or consent to sit at the feet of so\nabhorrent a Gamaliel. Ladies are sometimes less nice in their\nappreciation of physical disqualification; and, provided that a man\nspeak to them well, they will listen, though he speak from a mouth\nnever so deformed and hideous. Wilkes was most fortunate as a\nlover; and the damp, sandy-haired, saucer-eyed, red-fisted Mr Slope\nwas powerful only over the female breast.\n\nThere were, however, one or two of the neighbouring clergy who\nthought it not quite safe to neglect the baskets in which for the\nnonce were stored the loaves and fishes of the diocese of\nBarchester. They, and they only, came to call on Mr Slope after his\nperformance in the cathedral pulpit. Among them Mr Quiverful, the\nrector of Puddingdale, whose wife still continued to present him\nfrom year to year with fresh pledges of her love, and so to\nincrease his cares and, it is to be hoped, his happiness equally.\nWho can wonder that a gentleman, with fourteen living children and\na bare income of L 400 a year, should look after the loaves and\nfishes, ever when they are under the thumb of Mr Slope?\n\nVery soon after the Sunday on which the sermon was preached, the\nleading clergy of the neighbourhood held high debate together as to\nhow Mr Slope should be put down. In the first place he should never\nagain preach from the pulpit of Barchester cathedral. This was Dr\nGrantly's earliest dictum; and they all agreed, providing only that\nthey had the power to exclude him. Dr Grantly declared that the\npower rested with the dean and chapter, observing that no clergyman\nout of the chapter had a claim to preach there, saving only the\nbishop himself. To this the dean assented, but alleged that\ncontests on such a subject would be unseemly; to which rejoined a\nmeagre little doctor, one of the cathedral prebendaries, that the\ncontest must be all on the side of Mr Slope if every prebendary\nwere always there ready to take his own place in the pulpit.\nCunning little meagre doctor, whom it suits well to live in his own\ncosy house within Barchester close, and who is well content to have\nhis little fling at Dr Vesey Stanhope and other absentees, whose\nItalian villas, or enticing London homes, are more tempting than\ncathedral stalls and residences!\n\nTo this answered the burly chancellor, a man rather silent indeed,\nbut very sensible, that absent prebendaries had their vicars, and\nthat in such case the vicar's right to the pulpit was the same as\nthat of the higher order. To which the dean assented, groaning\ndeeply at these truths. Thereupon, however, the meagre doctor\nremarked that they would be in the hands of their minor canons, one\nof whom might at any hour betray his trust. Whereon was heard from\nthe burly chancellor an ejaculation sounding somewhat like 'Pooh,\npooh, pooh!' but it might have been that the worthy man was but\nblowing out the heavy breath from his windpipe. Why silence him at\nall, suggested Mr Harding. Let them not be ashamed to hear what any\nman might have to preach to them, unless he preached false\ndoctrine; in which case, let the bishop silence him. So spoke our\nfriend; vainly; for human ends must be attained by human means. But\nthe dean saw a ray of hope out of those purblind old eyes of his.\nYes, let them tell the bishop how distasteful to them was this Mr\nSlope: new bishop just come to his seat could not wish to insult\nhis clergy while the gloss was yet fresh on his first apron.\n\nThen up rose Dr Grantly; and, having thus collected the scattered\nwisdom of his associates, spoke forth with words of deep authority.\nWhen I say up rose the archdeacon, I speak of the inner man, which\nthen sprang up to more immediate action, for the doctor had,\nbodily, been standing all along with his back to the dean's empty\nfire-grate, and the tails of his frock coat supported over his two\narms. His hands were in his breeches pockets.\n\n'It is quite clear that this man must not be allowed to preach\nagain in the cathedral. We all see that, except our dear friend\nhere, the milk of whose nature runs so softly, that he would not\nhave the heart to refuse the Pope, the loan of his pulpit, if the\nPope would come and ask it. We must not, however, allow the man to\npreach again here. It is not because his opinion on church matters\nmay be different from ours--with that one would not quarrel. It is\nbecause he has purposely insulted us. When he went up into that\npulpit last Sunday, his studied object was to give offence to men\nwho had grown old in reverence to those things of which he dared to\nspeak so slightingly. What! To come here a stranger, a young,\nunknown, and unfriended stranger, and tell us, in the name of the\nbishop, his master, that we are ignorant of our duties,\nold-fashioned, and useless! I don't know whether to most admire his\ncourage or his impudence! And one thing I will tell you: that\nsermon originated solely with the man himself. The bishop was no\nmore a party to it than was the dean here. You all know how grieved\nI am to see a bishop in this diocese holding the latitudinarian\nideas by which Dr Proudie has made himself conspicuous. You all\nknow how greatly I should distrust the opinion of such a man. But\nin this matter I hold him to be blameless. I believe Dr Proudie has\nlived too long among gentlemen to be guilty, or to instigate\nanother to be guilty, of so gross an outrage. No! That man uttered\nwhat was untrue when he hinted that he was speaking as the\nmouthpiece of the bishop. It suited his ambitious views at once to\nthrow down the gauntlet to us--here within the walls of our own\nloved cathedral--here where we have for so many years exercised our\nministry, without schism and with good repute. Such an attack upon\nus, coming from such a quarter, is abominable.'\n\n'Abominable,' groaned the dean. 'Abominable,' muttered the meagre\ndoctor. 'Abominable,' re-echoed the chancellor, uttering a sound\nfrom the bottom of his deep chest. 'I really think it was,' said Mr\nHarding.\n\n'Most abominable, and most unjustifiable,' continued the\narchdeacon. 'But, Mr Dean, thank God, that pulpit is still our own:\nyour own, I should say. That pulpit belongs to the dean and chapter\nof Barchester Cathedral, and, as yet, Mr Slope is no part of that\nchapter. You, Mr Dean, have suggested that we should appeal to the\nbishop to abstain from forcing this man on us; but what if the\nbishop allow himself to be ruled by his chaplain? In my opinion,\nthe matter is in our own hands. Mr Slope cannot preach there\nwithout permission asked and obtained, and let that permission be\ninvariable refused. Let all participation in the ministry of the\ncathedral service be refused to him. Then, if the bishop choose to\ninterfere, we shall know what answer to make to the bishop. My\nfriend here has suggested that this man may again find his way into\nthe pulpit by undertaking the duty of some of your minor canons;\nbut I am sure that we may fully trust to these gentlemen to support\nus, when it is known that the dean objects to any such transfer.'\n\n'Of course you may,' said the chancellor.\n\nThere was much more discussion among the learned conclave, all of\nwhich, of course, ended in obedience to the archdeacon's commands.\nThey had too long been accustomed to his rule to shake it off so\nsoon; and in this particular case they had none of them a wish to\nabet the man whom he was so anxious to put down.\n\nSuch a meeting as that we have just recorded is not held in such a\ncity as Barchester unknown and untold of. Not only was the fact of\nthe meeting talked of in every respectable house, including the\npalace, but the very speeches of the dean, the archdeacon, and\nchancellor were repeated; not without many additions and imaginary\ncircumstances, according to the tastes and opinions of the\nrelaters.\n\nAll, however, agreed in saying that Mr Slope was to be debarred\nfrom opening his mouth in the cathedral of Barchester; many\nbelieved that the vergers were to be ordered to refuse him even the\naccommodation of a seat; and some of the most far-going advocates\nfor strong measures, declared that this sermon was looked upon as\nan indictable offence, and that proceedings were to be taken\nagainst him for brawling.\n\nThe party who were inclined to him--the enthusiastically religious\nyoung ladies, and the middle-aged spinsters desirous of a move--of\ncourse took up his defence the more warmly on account of this\nattack. If they could not hear Mr Slope in the cathedral, they\nwould hear him elsewhere; they would leave the dull dean, the dull\nold prebendaries, and the scarcely less dull young minor canons, to\npreach to each other; they would work slippers and cushions, and\nhem bands for Mr Slope, make him a happy martyr, and stick him up\nin some new Sion (sic) or Bethesda, and put the cathedral quite out\nof fashion.\n\nDr and Mrs Proudie at once returned to London. They thought it\nexpedient not to have to encounter any personal applications from\nthe dean and chapter respecting the sermon till the violence of the\nstorm had expended itself; but they left Mr Slope behind them\nnothing daunted, and he went about his work zealously, flattering\nsuch as would listen to his flattery, whispering religious twaddle\ninto the ears of foolish women, ingratiating himself with the very\nfew clergy who would receive him, visiting the houses of the poor,\ninquiring into all people, prying into everything, and searching\nwith the minutest eye into all palatial dilapidation. He did not,\nhowever, make any immediate attempt to preach again in the\ncathedral.\n\nAnd so all Barchester was by the ears.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE EX-WARDEN REJOICES IN HIS PROBABLE RETURN TO THE HOSPITAL\n\nAmong the ladies in Barchester who have hitherto acknowledged Mr\nSlope as their spiritual director, must not be reckoned either the\nwidow Bold, or her sister-in-law. On the first outbreak of the\nwrath of the denizens of the close, none had been more animated\nagainst the intruder than those two ladies. And this was natural.\nWho could be so proud of the musical distinction of their own\ncathedral as the favourite daughter of the precentor? Who would be\nso likely to resent an insult offered to the old choir? And in such\nmatters Miss Bold and her sister-in-law had but one opinion.\n\nThis wrath, however, has in some degree been mitigated, and I\nregret to say that these ladies allowed Mr Slope to be his own\napologist. About a fortnight after the sermon had been preached,\nthey were both of them not a little surprised by hearing Mr Slope\nannounced, as the page in buttons opened Mrs Bold's drawing-room\ndoor. Indeed, what living man could, by a mere morning visit, have\nsurprised them more? Here was the great enemy of all that was good\nin Barchester coming into their own drawing-room, and they had not\nstrong arm, no ready tongue near at hand for their protection. The\nwidow snatched her baby out of its cradle into her lap, and Mary\nBold stood up ready to die manfully in that baby's behalf, should,\nunder any circumstances, such a sacrifice be necessary.\n\nIn this manner was Mr Slope received. But when he left, he was\nallowed by each lady to take her hand, and to make his adieux as\ngentlemen do who have been graciously entertained! Yes; he shook\nhands with them, and was curtseyed out courteously, the buttoned\npage opening the door, as he would have done for the best canon of\nthem all. He had touched the baby's little hand and blessed him\nwith a fervid blessing; he had spoken to the widow of her early\nsorrows, and Eleanor's silent tears had not rebuked him; he had\ntold Mary Bold that her devotion would be rewarded, and Mary Bold\nhad heard the praise without disgust. And how had he done all this?\nHow had he so quickly turned aversion into, at any rate,\nacquaintance? How had he overcome the enmity with which those\nladies had been ready to receive him, and made his peace with them\nso easily?\n\nMy readers will guess from what I have written that I myself do not\nlike Mr Slope; but I am constrained to admit that he is a man of\nparts. He knows how to say a soft word in the proper place; he\nknows how to adapt his flattery to the ears of his hearers; he\nknows the wiles of the serpent and he uses them. Could Mr Slope\nhave adapted his manners to men as well as to women, could he ever\nhave learnt the ways of a gentleman, he might have risen to great\nthings.\n\nHe commenced his acquaintance with Eleanor by praising her father.\nHe had, he said, become aware that he had unfortunately offended\nthe feelings of a man of whom he could not speak too highly; he\nwould not now allude to a subject which was probably too serious\nfor drawing-room conversation, but he would say, that it had been\nvery far from him to utter a word in disparagement of a man, of\nwhom all the world, at least the clerical world, spoke of so highly\nas it did of Mr Harding. And so he went on, unsaying a great deal\nof his sermon, expressing his highest admiration for the\nprecentor's musical talents, eulogising the father and the daughter\nand the sister-in-law, speaking in that low silky whisper which he\nalways had specially prepared for feminine ears, and, ultimately,\ngaining his object. When he left, he expressed a hope that he might\nagain be allowed to call; and though Eleanor gave no verbal assent\nto this, she did not express dissent; and so Mr Slope's right to\nvisit at the widow's house was established.\n\nThe day after this visit Eleanor told her father of it, and\nexpressed an opinion that Mr Slope was not quite so black as he had\nbeen painted. Mr Harding opened he eyes rather wider than usual\nwhen he heard what had occurred, but he said little; he could not\nagree in any praise of Mr Slope, and it was not his practice to say\nmuch evil of any one. He did not, however, like the visit, and\nsimple-minded as he was, he felt sure that Mr Slope had some deeper\nmotive than the mere pleasure of making soft speeches to two\nladies.\n\nMr Harding, however, had come to see his daughter with other\npurpose than that of speaking either good or evil of Mr Slope. He\nhad come to tell her that the place of warden in Hiram's hospital\nwas again to be filled up, and that in all probability he would\nonce more return to his old house and his twelve bedesmen.\n\n'But,' he said, laughing, 'I shall be greatly shorn of my ancient\nglory.'\n\n'Why so, papa?'\n\n'This new act of parliament, that is to put us all on our feet\nagain,' continued he, 'settles my income at four hundred and fifty\npounds per annum.'\n\n'Four hundred and fifty,' said she, 'instead of eight hundred!\nWell; that is rather shabby. But still, papa, you'll have the dear\nold house and garden?'\n\n'My dear,' said he, 'it's worth twice the money;' and as he spoke\nhe showed a jaunty kind of satisfaction in his tone and manner, and\nin the quick, pleasant way in which he paced Eleanor's\ndrawing-room. 'It's worth twice the money. I shall have the house\nand the garden, and a larger income than I can possibly want.'\n\n'At any rate, you'll have no extravagant daughter to provide for;'\nand as she spoke, the young widow put her arm within his, and made\nhim sit on the sofa beside her; 'at any rate you'll not have that\nexpense.'\n\n'No, my dear; and I shall be rather lonely without her; but we\nwon't think of that now. As regards income I shall have plenty for\nall I want. I shall have my old house; and I don't mind owning now\nthat I have felt sometimes the inconvenience of living in a\nlodging. Lodgings are very nice for young men, but at my time of\nlife there is a want of--I hardly know what to call it, perhaps not\nrespectability--'\n\n'Oh, papa! I'm sure there's been nothing like that. Nobody has\nthought it; nobody in all Barchester has been more respected than\nyou have been since you took those rooms in High Street. Nobody!\nNot the dean in his deanery, or the archdeacon at Plumstead.'\n\n'The archdeacon would not be much obliged to you if he heard you,'\nsaid he, smiling somewhat at the exclusive manner in which his\ndaughter confined her illustration to the church dignitaries of the\nchapter of Barchester; 'but at any rate, I shall be glad to get\nback to the old house. Since I heard that it was all settled, I\nhave begun to fancy that I can't be comfortable without my two\nsitting-rooms.'\n\n'Come and stay with me, papa, till it is settled--there's a dear\npapa.'\n\n'Thank ye, Nelly. But no; I won't do that. It would make two\nmovings. I shall be very glad to get back to my old men again.\nAlas! Alas! There have six of them gone in the few last years. Six\nout of twelve! And the others I fear have had but a sorry life of\nit there. Poor Bunce, poor old Bunce!'\n\nBunce was one of the surviving recipients of Hiram's charity; and\nold man, now over ninety, who had long been a favourite of Mr\nHarding's.\n\n'How happy old Bunce will be,' said Mrs Bold, clapping her soft\nhands softly. 'How happy they all will be to have you back again.'\nYou may be sure there will soon be friendship among them again when\nyou are there.'\n\n'But,' said he, half laughing, 'I am to have new troubles, which\nwill be terrible to me. There are to be twelve old women, and a\nmatron. How shall I manage twelve women and a matron!'\n\n'The matron will manage the women of course.'\n\n'And who'll manage the matron?' said he.\n\n'She won't want to be managed. She'll be a great lady herself, I\nsuppose. But, papa, where will the matron live? She is not to live\nin the warden's house with you, is she?'\n\n'Well, I hope not, my dear.'\n\n'Oh, papa, I tell you fairly. I won't have a matron for a new\nstep-mother.'\n\n'You shan't, my dear; that is if I can help it. But they are going\nto build another house for the matron and the women; and I believe\nthey haven't even fixed yet on the site of the building.'\n\n'And have they appointed the matron?' said Eleanor.\n\n'They haven't appointed the warden yet,' replied he.\n\n'But there's no doubt about that, I suppose,' said his daughter.\n\nMr Harding explained that he thought there was no doubt; that the\narchdeacon had declared as much, saying that the bishop and his\nchaplain between them had not the power to appoint any once else,\neven if they had the will to do so, and sufficient impudence to\ncarry out such a will. The archdeacon was of the opinion, that\nthough Mr Harding had resigned his wardenship, and had done so\nunconditionally, he had done so under circumstances which left the\nbishop no choice as to his re-appointment, now that the affair of\nthe hospital had been settled on a new basis by act of parliament.\nSuch was the archdeacon's opinion, and his father-in-law received\nit without a shadow of doubt.\n\nDr Grantly had always been strongly opposed to Mr Harding's\nresignation of the place. He had done all in his power to dissuade\nhim from it. He had considered that Mr Harding was bound to\nwithstand the popular clamour with which he was attacked for\nreceiving so large an income as eight hundred a year from such a\ncharity, and was not even satisfied that his father-in-law's\nconduct had not been pusillanimous and undignified. He looked also\non this reduction of the warden's income as a paltry scheme on the\npart of government for escaping from a difficulty into which it had\nbeen brought by the public press. Dr Grantly observed that the\ngovernment had no more right to dispose of a sum of four hundred\nand fifty pounds a year out of the income of Hiram's legacy, than\nof nine hundred; whereas, as he said, the bishop, dean and chapter\nclearly had a right to settle what sum should be paid. He also\ndeclared that the government had no more right to saddle the\ncharity with twelve old women than with twelve hundred; and he was,\ntherefore, very indignant on the matter. He probably forgot when so\ntalking that government had done nothing of the kind, and had never\nassumed any such might or any such right. He made the common\nmistake of attributing to the government, which in such matters is\npowerless, the doings of parliament, which in such matters is\nomnipotent.\n\nBut though he felt that the glory and honour of the situation of\nwarden of Barchester hospital was indeed curtailed by the new\narrangement; that the whole establishment had to a certain degree\nbeen made vile by the touch of Whig commissioners; that the place\nwith the lessened income, its old women, and other innovations, was\nvery different from the hospital of former days; still the\narchdeacon was too practical a man of the world to wish that his\nfather-in-law, who had at present little more than L 200 per annum\nfor all his wants, should refuse the situation, defiled,\nundignified, and commission-ridden as it was.\n\nMr Harding had, accordingly, made up his mind that he would return\nto his old house at the hospital, and to tell the truth, had\nexperienced almost a childish pleasure in the idea of doing so. The\ndiminished income was to him not even the source of momentary\nregret. The matron and the old women did rather go against the\ngrain; but he was able to console himself with the reflection,\nthat, after all, such an arrangement might be of real service to\nthe poor of the city. The thought that he must receive his\nre-appointment as the gift of the new bishop, and probably through\nthe hands of Mr Slope, annoyed him a little; but his mind was set\nat rest by the assurance of the archdeacon that there would be no\nfavour in such a presentation. The re-appointment of the old warden\nwould be regarded by all the world as a matter of course. Mr\nHarding, therefore, felt no hesitation in telling his daughter that\nthey might look upon his return to his old quarters as a settled\nmatter.\n\n'And you won't have to ask for it, papa.'\n\n'Certainly not, my dear. There is no ground on which I could ask\nfor any favour from the bishop, whom, indeed, I hardly know. Nor\nwould I ask a favour, that granting of which might possibly be made\na question to be settled by Mr Slope. No,' said he, moved for a\nmoment by a spirit very unlike his own, 'I certainly shall be very\nglad to go back to the hospital; but I should never go there, if it\nwere necessary that my doing so should be the subject of a request\nto Mr Slope.'\n\nThis little outbreak of her father's anger jarred on the present\ntone of Eleanor's mind. She had not learnt to like Mr Slope, but\nshe had learnt to think that he had much respect for her father;\nand she would, therefore, willingly use her efforts to induce\nsomething like good feeling between them.\n\n'Papa,' said she, 'I think you somewhat mistake Mr Slope's\ncharacter.'\n\n'Do I?' said he, placidly.\n\n'I think you do, papa. I think he intended no personal disrespect\nto you when he preached the sermon which made the archdeacon and\nthe dean so angry.!'\n\n'I never supposed that he did, my dear. I hope I never inquired\nwithin myself whether he did or no. Such a matter would be unworthy\nof any inquiry, and very unworthy of the consideration of the\nchapter. But I fear he intended disrespect to the ministration's of\nGod's services, as conducted in conformity with the rules of the\nChurch of England.'\n\n'But might it not be that he thought it his duty to express his\ndissent from that which you, and the dean, and all of us here\napprove?'\n\n'It can hardly be the duty of any young man rudely to assail the\nreligious convictions of his elders of the church. Courtesy should\nhave kept him silent, even if neither charity nor modesty could do\nso.'\n\n'But Mr Slope would say that on such a subject the commands of his\nheavenly Master do not admit of his being silent.'\n\n'Nor of being courteous, Eleanor?'\n\n'He did not say that, papa.'\n\n'Believe me, my child, that Christian ministers are never called on\nby God's word to insult the convictions, or even the prejudices, of\ntheir brethren; and that religion is at any rate not less\nsusceptible to urbane and courteous conduct among men, than any\nother study which men take up. I am sorry to say that I cannot\ndefend Mr Slope's sermon in the cathedral. But come, my dear, put\non your bonnet, and let us walk round the dear old gardens at the\nhospital. I have never yet had the heart to go beyond the\ncourt-yard since we left the place. Now I think I can venture to\nenter.'\n\nEleanor rang the bell, and gave a variety of imperative charges as\nto the welfare of the precious baby, whom, all but unwillingly, she\nwas about to leave for an hour or so, and then sauntered forth with\nher father to revisit the old hospital. It had been forbidden ground\nto her as well as to him since the day on which they had walked\nforth together from its walk.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE STANHOPE FAMILY\n\nIt is now three months since Dr Proudie began his reign, and\nchanges had already been affected in the diocese which show at\nleast the energy of an active mind. Among other things, absentee\nclergymen have been favoured with hints much too strong to be\noverlooked. Poor dear old Bishop Grantly had on this matter been\ntoo lenient, and the archdeacon had never been inclined to be\nsevere with those who were absent on reputable pretences, and who\nprovided for their duties in a liberal way.\n\nAmong the greatest of the diocesan sinners in this respect was Dr\nVesey Stanhope. Years had now passed since he had done a day's\nduty; and yet there was no reason against his doing duty except a\nwant of inclination on his own part. He held a prebendal stall in\nthe diocese; one of the best residences in the close; and the two\nlarge rectories of Crabtree Canonicorum, and Stogpingum. Indeed, he\nhad the cure of three parishes, for that of Eiderdown was joined to\nStogpingum. He had resided in Italy for twelve years. His first\ngoing there had been attributed to a sore throat; and that sore\nthroat, though never repeated in any violent manner had stood him\nin such stead, that it had enabled him to live in easy idleness\never since.\n\nHe had now been summoned home,--not indeed, with rough violence, or\nby any peremptory command, but by a mandate which he found himself\nunable to disregard. Mr Slope had written to him by the bishop's\ndesire. In the first place, the bishop much wanted the valuable\nco-operation of Dr Vesey Stanhope in the diocese; in the next, the\nbishop thought it his imperative duty to become personally\nacquainted with the most conspicuous of his diocesan clergy; then\nthe bishop thought it essentially necessary for Dr Stanhope's own\ninterests, that Dr Stanhope should, at any rate for a time, return\nto Barchester; and lastly, it was said that so strong a feeling was\nat the present moment evinced by the hierarchs of the church with\nreference to the absence of its clerical members, that it behoved\nDr Vesey Stanhope not to allow his name to stand among those which\nwould probably in a few months be submitted to the councils of the\nnation.\n\nThere was something so ambiguously frightful in this last threat\nthat Dr Stanhope determined to spend two or three summer months at\nhis residence in Barchester. His rectories were inhabited by his\ncurates, and he felt himself from disuse to be unfit for parochial\nduty; but his prebendal home was kept empty for him, and he thought\nit probable that he might be able now and again to preach a\nprebendal sermon. He arrived, therefore, with all his family at\nBarchester, and he and they must be introduced to my readers.\n\nThe great family characteristic of the Stanhopes might probably be\nsaid to be heartlessness; but the want of feeling was, in most of\nthem, accompanied by so great an amount of good nature that their\nneighbours failed to perceive how indifferent to them was the\nhappiness and well-being of those around them. The Stanhopes would\nvisit you in your sickness (provided it were not contagious), would\nbring you oranges, French novels, and the last new bit of scandal,\nand then hear of your death or your recovery with an equally\nindifferent composure. Their conduct to each other was the same as\nto the world; they bore and forbore: and there was sometimes, as\nwill be seen, much necessity for forbearing: but their love among\nthemselves rarely reached above this. It is astonishing how much\neach of the family was able to do, and how much each did, to\nprevent the well-being of the other four.\n\nFor there were five in all; the doctor, namely, and Mrs Stanhope,\ntwo daughters, and one son. The doctor, perhaps, was the least\nsingular and most estimable of them all, and yet such good\nqualities as he possessed were all negative. He was a good looking\nrather plethoric gentleman of about sixty years of age. His hair\nwas snow white, very plentiful, and somewhat like wool of the\nfinest description. His whiskers were large and very white, and\ngave to his face the appearance of a benevolent sleepy old lion.\nHis dress was always unexceptionable. Although he had lived so many\nyears in Italy it was invariably of a decent clerical hue, but it\nnever was hyperclerical. He was a man not given to much talking,\nbut what little he did say was generally well said. His reading\nseldom went beyond romances and poetry of the lightest and not\nalways most moral description. He was thoroughly a bon vivant; an\naccomplished judge of wine, though he never drank to excess; and a\nmost inexorable critic in all affairs touching the kitchen. He had\nhad much to forgive in his own family, since a family had grown up\naround him, and had forgiven everything--except inattention to his\ndinner. His weakness in that respect was now fully understood, and\nhis temper but seldom tried. As Dr Stanhope was a clergyman, it may\nbe supposed that his religious convictions made up a considerable\npart of his character; but this was not so. That he had religious\nconvictions must be believed; but he rarely obtruded them, even on\nhis children. This abstinence on his part was not systematic, but\nvery characteristic of the man. It was not that he had\npredetermined never to influence their thoughts; but he was so\nhabitually idle that his time for doing so had never come till the\nopportunity for doing so was gone forever. Whatever conviction the\nfather may have had, the children were at any rate but indifferent\nmembers of the church from which he drew his income.\n\nSuch was Dr Stanhope. The features of Mrs Stanhope's character were\neven less plainly marked than those of her lord. The far niente of\nher Italian life had entered into her very soul, and brought her to\nregard a state of inactivity as the only earthly good. In manner\nand appearance she was exceedingly prepossessing. She had been a\nbeauty, and even now, at fifty-five, she was a handsome woman. Her\ndress was always perfect: she never dressed but once in the day,\nand never appeared till between three and four; but when she did\nappear, she appeared at her best. Whether the toil rested partly\nwith her, or wholly with her handmaid, it is not for such a one as\nthe author to imagine. The structure of her attire was always\nelaborate, and yet never over laboured. She was rich in apparel,\nbut not bedizened with finery; her ornaments were costly, rare, and\nsuch as could not fail to attract notice, but they did not look as\nthough worn with that purpose. She well knew the great\narchitectural secret of decorating her constructions, and never\ncondescended to construct a decoration. But when we have said that\nMrs Stanhope knew how to dress, and used her knowledge daily, we\nhave said all. Other purpose in life she had none. It was\nsomething, indeed, that she did not interfere with the purposes of\nothers. In early life she had undergone great trials with reference\nto the doctor's dinners; but for the last ten or twelve years her\neldest daughter Charlotte had taken that labour off her hands, and\nshe had had little to trouble her;--little, that is, till the edict\nfor this terrible English journey had gone forth; since, then,\nindeed, her life had been laborious enough. For such a one, the\ntoil of being carried from the shores of Como to the city of\nBarchester is more than labour enough, let the cares of the\ncarriers be ever so vigilant. Mrs Stanhope had been obliged to have\nevery one of her dresses taken in from the effects of the journey.\n\nCharlotte Stanhope was at this time about thirty-five years old;\nand, whatever may have been her faults, she had none of those which\nbelong particularly to old young ladies. She neither dressed young,\nnor talked young, nor indeed looked young. She appeared to be\nperfectly content with her time of life, and in no way affected the\ngrace of youth. She was a fine young woman; and had she been a man,\nwould have been a very fine young man. All that was done in the\nhouse, and that was not done by servants, was done by her. She gave\nthe orders, paid the bills, hired and dismissed the domestics, made\nthe tea, carved the meat, and managed everything in the Stanhope\nhousehold. She, and she alone, could ever induce her father to look\ninto the state of his worldly concerns. She, and she alone, could\nin any degree control the absurdities of her sister. She, and she\nalone, prevented the whole family from falling into utter disrepute\nand beggary. It was by her advice that they now found themselves\nvery unpleasantly situated in Barchester.\n\nSo far, the character of Charlotte Stanhope is not unprepossessing.\nBut it remains to be said, that the influence which she had in her\nfamily, though it had been used to a certain extent for their\nworldly well-being, had not been used to their real benefit, as it\nmight have been. She had aided her father in his indifference to\nhis professional duties, counselling him that his livings were as\nmuch as his individual property as the estates of his elder brother\nwere the property of that worthy peer. She had for years past\nstifled every little rising wish for a return to England which the\ndoctor had from time to time expressed. She had encouraged her\nmother in her idleness in order that she herself might be mistress\nand manager of the Stanhope household. She had encouraged and\nfostered the follies of her sister, though she was always willing,\nand often able, to protect her from their probable result. She had\ndone her best, and had thoroughly succeeded in spoiling her\nbrother, and turning him loose upon the world an idle man without a\nprofession, and without a shilling that he could call his own.\n\nMiss Stanhope was a clever woman, able to talk on most subjects,\nand quite indifferent as to what the subject was. She prided\nherself on her freedom from English prejudice, and she might have\nadded, from feminine delicacy. On religion she was a pure\nfreethinker, and with much want of true affection, delighted to\nthrow out her own views before the troubled mind of her father. To\nhave shaken what remained of his Church of England faith would have\ngratified her much; but the idea of his abandoning his preferment\nin the church had never once presented itself to her mind. How\ncould he indeed, when he had no income from any other sources?\n\nBut the two most prominent members of the family still remain to be\ndescribed. The second child had been christened Madeline, and had\nbeen a great beauty. We need not say had been, for she was never\nmore beautiful than at the time of which we write, though her\nperson for many years had been disfigured by an accident. It is\nunnecessary that we should give in detail the early history of\nMadeline Stanhope. She had gone to Italy when seventeen years of\nage, and had been allowed to make the most of her surpassing beauty\nin the saloons of Milan, and among the crowded villas along the\nshores of the Lake of Como. She had become famous for adventures in\nwhich her character was just not lost, and had destroyed the hearts\nof a dozen cavaliers without once being touched in her own. Blood\nhad flowed in quarrels about her charms, and she heard of these\nencounters with pleasurable excitement. It had been told of her\nthat on one occasion she had stood by in the disguise of a page,\nand had seen her lover fall.\n\nAs is so often the case, she had married the very worst of those\nwho sought her hand. Why she had chosen Paulo Neroni, a man of no\nbirth and no property, a mere captain in the pope's guard, one who\nhad come up to Milan either simply as an adventurer or as a spy, a\nman of harsh temper and oily manners, mean in figure, swarthy in\nface, and so false in words as to be hourly detected, need not now\nbe told. When the moment for doing so came, she had probably no\nalternative. He, at any rate, had become her husband; and after a\nprolonged honeymoon among the lakes, they had gone together to\nRome, the papal captain having vainly endeavoured to induce his\nwife to remain behind him.\n\nSix months afterwards she arrived at her father's house a cripple\nand a mother. She had arrived without even notice, with hardly\nclothes to cover her, and without one of those many ornaments which\nhad graced her bridal trousseaux. Her baby was in the arms of a\npoor girl from Milan, whom she had taken in exchange for the Roman\nmaid who had accompanied her thus far, and who had then, as her\nmistress said, become homesick and had returned. It was clear that\nthe lady had determined that there should be no witness to tell\nstories of her life in Rome.\n\nShe had fallen, she said, in ascending a ruin and had fatally\ninjured the sinews of her knee; so fatally, that when she stood she\nlost eight inches of her accustomed height; so fatally, that when\nshe essayed to move, she could only drag herself painfully along,\nwith protruded hip and extended foot in a manner less graceful than\nthat of a hunchback. She had consequently made up her mind, once\nand for ever, that she would never stand, and never attempt to move\nherself.\n\nStories were not slow to follow her, averring that she had been\ncruelly ill-used by Neroni, and that to his violence had she owed\nher accident. Be that as it may, little had been said about her\nhusband, but that little had made it clearly intelligible to the\nfamily that Signor Neroni was to be seen and heard of no more.\nThere was no question as to re-admitting the poor ill-used beauty\nto her old family rights, no question as to adopting her infant\ndaughter, beneath the Stanhope roof tree. Though heartless, the\nStanhopes were not selfish. The two were taken in, petted, made\nmuch of, for a time all but adored, and then felt by the two\nparents to be great nuisances in the house. But in the house the\nlady was, and there she remained, having her own way, though that\nway was not very comfortable with the customary usages of an\nEnglish clergyman.\n\nMadame Neroni, though forced to give up all motion in the world,\nhad no intention whatever of giving up the world itself. The beauty\nof her face was uninjured, and that beauty was of a peculiar kind.\nHer copious rich brown hair was worn in Grecian bandeaux round her\nhead, displaying as much as possible of her forehead and cheeks.\nHer forehead, though rather low, was very beautiful from its\nperfect contour and pearly whiteness. Her eyes were long and large,\nand marvellously bright; might I venture to say, bright as\nLucifer's, I should perhaps best express the depth of their\nbrilliancy. They were dreadful eyes to look at, such as would\nabsolutely deter any man of quiet mind and easy spirit from\nattempting a passage of arms with such foes. There was talent in\nthem, and the fire of passion and the play of wit, but there was no\nlove. Cruelty was there instead, and courage, a desire for\nmasterhood, cunning, and a wish for mischief. And yet, as eyes,\nthey were very beautiful. The eyelashes were long and perfect, and\nthe long steady unabashed gaze, with which she would look into the\nface of her admirer, fascinated while it frightened him. She was a\nbasilisk from whom an ardent lover of beauty could make no escape.\nHer nose and mouth more so at twenty-eight than they had been at\neighteen. What wonder that with such charms still glowing in her\nface, and with such deformity destroying her figure, she should\nresolve to be seen, but only to be seen reclining on a sofa.\n\nHer resolve had not been carried out without difficulty. She had\nstill frequented the opera at Milan; she had still been seen\noccasionally in the saloons of the noblesse; she had caused herself\nto be carried in and out from her carriage, and that in such a\nmanner as in no wise to disturb her charms, disarrange her dress,\nor expose her deformities. Her sister always accompanied her and a\nmaid, a manservant also, and on state occasions, two. It was\nimpossible that her purpose could have been achieved with less: and\nyet, poor as she was, she had achieved her purpose. And then again\nthe more dissolute Italian youths of Milan frequented the Stanhope\nvilla and surrounded her couch, not greatly to her father's\nsatisfaction. Sometimes his spirit would rise, a dark spot would\nshow itself on his cheek, and he would rebel; but Charlotte would\nassuage him with some peculiar triumph of her culinary art, and all\nagain would be smooth for a while.\n\nMadeline affected all manner of rich and quaint devices in the\ngarniture of her room, her person, and her feminine belongings. In\nnothing was this more apparent than in the visiting card which she\nhad prepared for her use. For such an article one would say that\nshe, in her present state, could have but small need, seeing how\nimprobable it was that she should make a morning call; but not such\nwas her own opinion. Her card was surrounded by a deep border of\ngilding; on this she had imprinted, in three lines:-\n\n          La Signora Madeline\n                          Vesey Neroni.\n          - Nata Stanhope.\n\nAnd over the name she had a bright gilt coronet, which certainly\nlooked very magnificent. How she had come to concoct such a name\nfor herself it would be difficult to explain. Her father had been\nchristened Vesey, as another man is christened Thomas; and she had\nno more right to assume it than would have the daughter of a Mr\nJosiah Jones to call herself Mrs Josiah Smith, on marrying a man of\nthe latter name. The gold coronet was equally out of place, and\nperhaps inserted with even less excuse. Paul Neroni had not the\nfaintest title to call himself a scion of even Italian nobility.\nHad the pair met in England Neroni would probably have been a\ncount; but they had met in Italy, and any such pretence on his part\nwould have been simply ridiculous. A coronet, however, was a pretty\nornament, and if it could solace a poor cripple to have such on her\ncard, who could begrudge it to her?\n\nOf her husband, or of his individual family, she never spoke; but\nwith her admirers she would often allude in a mysterious way to her\nmarried life and isolated state, and, pointing to her daughter,\nwould call her the last of the blood of the emperors, thus\nreferring Neroni's extraction to the old Roman family from which\nthe worst of the Caesars sprang.\n\nThe 'Signora' was not without talent, and not without a certain\nsort of industry; she was an indomitable letter writer, and her\nletters were worth the postage: they were full of wit, mischief,\nsatire, love, latitudinarian philosophy, free religion, and,\nsometimes, alas! loose ribaldry. The subject, however, depended\nentirely on the recipient, and she was prepared to correspond with\nany one, but moral young ladies or stiff old women. She wrote also\na kind of poetry, generally in Italian, and short romances,\ngenerally in French. She read much of a desultory sort of\nliterature, and as a modern linguist had really made great\nproficiency. Such was the lady who had now come to wound the hearts\nof the men of Barchester.\n\nEthelbert Stanhope was in some respects like his younger sister,\nbut he was less inestimable as a man than she was as a woman. His\ngreat fault was an entire absence of that principle which should\nhave induced him, as the son of a man without fortune, to earn his\nown bread. Many attempts had been made to get him to do so, but\nthese had all been frustrated, not so much by idleness on his part,\nas by a disinclination to exert himself in any way not to his\ntaste. He had been educated at Eton, and had been intended for the\nChurch, but had left Cambridge in disgust after a single term, and\nnotified to his father his intention to study for the bar.\nPreparatory to that, he thought it well that he should attend a\nGerman university, and consequently went to Leipzig. There he\nremained two years, and brought away a knowledge of German and a\ntaste for the fine arts. He still, however, intended himself for\nthe bar, took chambers, engaged himself to sit at the feet of a\nlearned pundit, and spent a season in London. He there found that\nall his aptitudes inclined him to the life of an artist, and he\ndetermined to live by painting. With this object he retired to\nMilan, and had himself rigged out for Rome. As a painter he might\nhave earned his bread, for he wanted only diligence to excel; but\nwhen at Rome his mind was carried away by other things: he soon\nwrote home for money, saying that he had been converted to the\nMother Church, that he was already an acolyte of the Jesuits, and\nthat he was about to start with others to Palestine on a mission\nfor converting Jews. He did go to Judea, but being unable to\nconvert the Jews, was converted by them. He again wrote home, to\nsay that Moses was the only giver of perfect laws to the world,\nthat the coming of the true Messiah was at hand, that great things\nwere doing in Palestine, and that he had met one of the family of\nSidonis, a most remarkable man, who was now on his way to Western\nEurope, and whom he had induced to deviate from his route with the\nobject of calling at the Stanhope villa. Ethelbert then expressed\nhis hope that his mother and sisters would listen to this wonderful\nprophet. His father he knew could not do so from pecuniary\nconsiderations. This Sidonia, however, did not take so strong a\nfancy to him as another of that family once did to a young English\nnobleman. At least he provided him with no hope of gold as large as\nlions; so that the Judaised Ethelbert was again obliged to draw on\nthe revenues of the Christian Church.\n\nIt is needless to tell how the father swore that he would send no\nmore money and receive no Jew; nor how Charlotte declared that\nEthelbert could not be left penniless in Jerusalem; and how 'La\nSignora Neroni' resolved to have Sidonia at her feet. The money was\nsent, and the Jew did come. The Jew did come, but he was not at all\nto the taste of 'la Signora'. He was a dirty little old man, and\nthough he had provided no golden lions, he had, it seems, relieved\nyoung Stanhope's necessities. He positively refused to leave the\nvilla till he got a bill from the doctor on his London bankers.\n\nEthelbert did not long remain a Jew. He soon reappeared at the\nvilla without prejudices on the subject of his religion, and with a\nfirm resolve to achieve fame and fortune as a sculptor. He brought\nwith him some models which he had originated at Rome, and which\nreally gave much fair promise that his father was induced to go to\nfurther expense in furthering these views. Ethelbert opened an\nestablishment, or rather took lodgings and workshop, at Carrara,\nand there spoilt much marble, and made some few pretty images.\nSince that period, now four years ago, he had alternated between\nCarrara and the villa, but his sojourns at the workshop became\nshorter and shorter, and those at the villa longer and longer.\n'Twas no wonder; for Carrara is not a spot in which an Englishman\nwould like to dwell.\n\nWhen the family started for England he had resolved not to be left\nbehind, and with the assistance of his elder sister had earned his\npoint against his father's wishes. It was necessary, he said, that\nhe should come to England for orders. How otherwise was he to bring\nhis profession to account?\n\nIn personal appearance Ethelbert Stanhope was the most singular of\nbeings. He was certainly very handsome. He had his sister\nMadeline's eyes without their stare, and without their hard cunning\ncruel firmness. They were also very much lighter, and of so light\nand clear a blue as to make his face remarkable, if nothing else\ndid so. On entering a room with him, Ethelbert's blue eyes would be\nthe first thing you would see, and on leaving it almost the last\nthing you would forget. His light hair was very long and silky,\ncoming down over his coat. His beard had been prepared in the holy\nland, and was patriarchal. He never shaved, and rarely trimmed it.\nIt was glossy, soft, clean, and altogether not unprepossessing. It\nwas such that ladies might desire to reel it off and work it into\ntheir patterns in lieu of floss silk. His complexion was fair and\nalmost pink, he was small in height, and slender in limb, but\nwell-made, and his voice was of particular sweetness.manner and\ndress he was equally remarkable. He had none of the mauvaise honte\nof an Englishman. He required no introduction to make himself\nagreeable to any person. He habitually addressed strangers, ladies\nas well as men, without any such formality, and in doing so never\nseemed to meet with rebuke. His costume cannot be described,\nbecause it was so various; but it was always totally opposed in\nevery principle of colour and construction to the dress of those\nwith whom he for the time consorted.\n\nHe was habitually addicted to making love to ladies, and did so\nwithout scruple of conscience, or any idea that such a practice was\namiss. He had no heart to touch himself, and was literally unaware\nthat humanity was subject to such infliction. He had not thought\nmuch about it; but, had he been asked, would have said, that\nill-treating a lady's heart meant injuring her promotion in the\nworld. His principles therefore forbade him to pay attention to a\ngirl, if he thought any man was present whom it might suit her to\nmarry. In this manner, his good nature frequently interfered with\nhis amusement; but he had no other motive in abstaining from the\nfullest declaration of love to every girl that pleased his eye.\n\nBertie Stanhope, as he was generally called, was, however, popular\nwith both sexes; and with Italians as well as English. His circle\nof acquaintance was very large, and embraced people of all sorts.\nHe had not respect for rank, and no aversion to those below him. He\nhad lived on familiar terms with English peers, German shopkeepers,\nand Roman priests. All people were nearly alike to him. He was\nabove, or rather below, all prejudices. No virtue could charm him,\nno vice shock him. He had about him a natural good manner, which\nseemed to qualify him for the highest circles, and yet he was never\nout of place in the lowest. He had no principle, no regard for\nothers, no self-respect, no desire to be other than a drone in a\nhive, if only he could, as a drone, get what honey was sufficient\nfor him. Of honey, in his latter days, it may probably be presaged,\nthat he will have but short allowance.\n\nSuch was the family of the Stanhopes, who, at this period, suddenly\njoined themselves to the ecclesiastical circle of Barchester close.\nAny stranger union, it would be impossible perhaps to conceive. And\nit was not as though they all fell down into the cathedral\nprecincts hitherto unknown and untalked of. In such case no\namalgamation would have been at all probable between the new comers\nand either the Proudie set or the Grantly set. But such was far\nfrom being the case. The Stanhopes were all known by name in\nBarchester, and Barchester was prepared to receive them with open\narms. The doctor was one of the prebendaries, one of her rectors,\none of her pillars of strength; and was, moreover, counted on, as a\nsure ally, both by Proudies and Grantlys.\n\nHe himself was the brother of one peer, and his wife was the sister\nof another--and both these peers were lords of whiggish tendency,\nwith whom the new bishop had some sort of alliance. This was\nsufficient to give to Mr Slope high hope that he might enlist Dr\nStanhope on his side, before his enemies could out-manoeuvre him.\nOn the other hand, the old dean had many many years ago, in the\ndays of the doctor's clerical energies, been instrumental in\nassisting him in his views as to preferment; and many many years\nago also, the two doctors, Stanhope and Grantly, had, as young\nparsons, been joyous together in the common rooms of Oxford. Dr\nGrantly, consequently, did not doubt but that the new comer would\nrange himself under his banners.\n\nLittle did any of them dream of what ingredients the Stanhope\nfamily was now composed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nMRS PROUDIE'S RECEPTION--COMMENCED\n\nThe bishop and his wife had only spent three or four days in\nBarchester on the occasion of their first visit. His lordship had,\nas we have seen, taken his seat on his throne; but his demeanour\nthere, into which it had been his intention to infuse much\nhierarchical dignity, had been a good deal disarranged by the\naudacity of his chaplain's sermon. He had hardly dared to look his\nclergy in the face, and to declare by the severity of his\ncountenance that in truth he meant all that his factotum was saying\non his behalf; nor yet did he dare throw Mr Slope over, and show to\nthose around him that he was no party to the sermon, and would\nresent it.\n\nHe had accordingly blessed his people in a shambling manner, not at\nall to his own satisfaction, and had walked back to his palace with\nhis mind very doubtful as to what he would say to his chaplain on\nthe subject. He did not remain long in doubt. He had hardly doffed\nhis lawn when the partner of all his toils entered his study, and\nexclaimed even before she had seated herself--\n\n'Bishop, did you ever hear a more sublime, more spirit-moving, more\nappropriate discourse than that?'\n\n'Well, my love; ha-hum-he!' The bishop did not know what to say.\n\n'I hope, my lord, you don't mean to say you disapprove?'\n\nThere was a look about the lady's eye which did not admit of my\nlord's disapproving at that moment. He felt that if he intended to\ndisapprove, it must be now or never; but he also felt that it could\nnot be now. It was not in him to say to the wife of his bosom that\nMr Slope's sermon was ill-timed, impertinent and vexatious.\n\n'No, no,' replied the bishop. 'No, I can't say I disapprove--a very\nclever sermon and very well intended, and I dare say will do a\ngreat deal of good.' This last praise was added, seeing that what\nhe had already said by no means satisfied Mrs Proudie.\n\n'I hope it will,' said she. 'I am sure it was well deserved. Did\nyou ever in your life, bishop, hear anything so like play-acting as\nthe way in which Mr Harding sings the litany? I shall beg Mr Slope\nto continue a course of sermons on the subject till all that is\naltered. We will have at any rate, in our cathedral, a decent,\ngodly, modest morning service. There must be no more play-acting\nhere now;' and so the lady rang for lunch.\n\nThis bishop knew more about cathedrals and deans, and precentors\nand church services than his wife did, and also more of the\nbishop's powers. But he thought it better at present to let the\nsubject drop.\n\n'My dear,' said he, 'I think we must go back to London on Tuesday.\nI find that my staying here will be very inconvenient to the\nGovernment.'\n\nThe bishop knew that to this proposal his wife would not object;\nand he also felt that by thus retreating from the ground of battle,\nthe heat of the fight might be got over in his absence.\n\n'Mr Slope will remain here, of course,' said the lady.\n\n'Oh, of course,' said the bishop.\n\nThus, after less than a week's sojourn in his palace, did the\nbishop fly from Barchester; nor did he return to it for two months,\nthe London season being then over. During that time Mr Slope was\nnot idle, but he did not again assay to preach in the cathedral. In\nanswer to Mrs Proudie's letters, advising a course of sermons, he\nhad pleaded that he would at any rate wish to put off such an\nundertaking till she was there to hear them.\n\nHe had employed his time in consolidating a Proudie and Slope\nparty--or rather a Slope and Proudie party, and he had not employed\nhis time in vain. He did not meddle with the dean and chapter,\nexcept by giving them little teasing intimations of the bishop's\nwishes about this and the bishop's feelings about that, in a manner\nwhich was to them sufficiently annoying, but which they could not\nresent. He preached once or twice in a distant church in the\nsuburbs of the city, but made no allusion to the cathedral service.\nHe commenced the establishment of the 'Bishop of Barchester's\nSabbath-day Schools,' gave notice of a proposed 'Bishop of\nBarchester Young Men's Sabbath Evening Lecture Room,'--and wrote\nthree or four letters to the manager of the Barchester branch\nrailway, informing him how anxious the bishop was that the Sunday\ntrains should be discontinued.\n\nAt the end of two months, however, the bishop and the lady\nreappeared; and as a happy harbinger of their return, heralded\ntheir advent by the promise of an evening party on the largest\nscale. The tickets of invitation were sent out from London--they\nwere dated from Bruton Street, and were dispatched by the odious\nSabbath-breaking railway, in a huge brown paper parcel to Mr Slope.\nEverybody calling himself a gentleman, or herself a lady, within\nthe city of Barchester, and a circle of two miles round it, was\nincluded. Tickets were sent to all the diocesan clergy, and also to\nmany other persons of priestly note, of whose absence the bishop,\nor at least the bishop's wife, felt tolerably confident. It was\nintended, however, to be a thronged and noticeable affair, and\npreparations were made for receiving some hundreds.\n\nAnd now there arose considerable agitation among the Grantleyites\nwhether or not they would attend the bidding. The first feeling\nwith them all was to send the briefest excuses both for themselves\nand their wives and daughters. But by degrees policy prevailed over\npassion. The archdeacon perceived that he would be making a false\nstep if he allowed the cathedral clergy to give the bishop just\nground of umbrage. They all met in conclave and agreed to go. The\nold dean would crawl in, if it were but for half an hour. The\nchancellor, treasurer, archdeacon, prebendaries, and minor canons\nwould all go, and would take their wives. Mr Harding was especially\nbidden to go, resolving in his heart to keep himself removed from\nMrs Proudie. And Mrs Bold was determined to go, though assured by\nher father that there was no necessity for such a sacrifice on her\npart. When all Barchester was to be there, neither Eleanor nor Mary\nBold understood why they should stay away. Had they not been\ninvited separately? And had not a separate little note from the\nchaplain couched in the most respectful language, been enclosed\nwith the huge episcopal card?\n\nAnd the Stanhopes would be there, one and all. Even the lethargic\nmother would so far bestir herself on such an occasion. They had\nonly just arrived. The card was at the residence waiting for them.\nNo one in Barchester had seen them; and what better opportunity\ncould they have of showing themselves to the Barchester world? Some\nfew old friends, such as the archdeacon and his wife, had called,\nand had found the doctor and his eldest daughter; but the elite of\nthe family were not yet known.\n\nThe doctor indeed wished in his heart to prevent the signora from\naccepting the bishop's invitation; but she herself had fully\ndetermined that she would accept it. If her father was ashamed of\nhaving his daughter carried into a bishop's palace, she had no such\nfeeling.\n\n'Indeed, I shall,' she said to her sister who had greatly\nendeavoured to dissuade her, by saying that the company would\nconsist wholly of parsons and parsons' wives. 'Parsons, I suppose,\nare much the same as other men, if you strip them of their black\ncoats; and as to their wives, I dare say they won't trouble me. You\nmay tell papa I don't mean to be left at home.'\n\nPapa was told, and felt that he could do nothing but yield. He also\nfelt that it was useless of him now to be ashamed of his children.\nSuch as they were, they had become such under his auspices; as he\nhad made his bed, so he must lie upon it; as he had sown his seed,\nso must he reap his corn. He did not indeed utter such reflections\nin such language, but such was the gist of his thoughts. It was not\nbecause Madeline was a cripple that he shrank from seeing her made\none of the bishop's guests; but because he knew that she would\npractise her accustomed lures, and behave herself in a way that\ncould not fail of being distasteful to the propriety of\nEnglishwomen. These things had annoyed but not shocked him in\nItaly. There they had shocked no one; but here in Barchester, here\namong his fellow parsons, he was ashamed that they should be seen.\nSuch had been his feelings, but he repressed them. What if his\nbrother clergymen were shocked! They could not take it from his\npreferment because the manners of his married daughter were too\nfree.\n\nLa Signora Neroni had, at any rate, no fear that she would shock\nanybody. Her ambition was to create a sensation, to have parsons at\nher feet, seeing that the manhood of Barchester consisted mainly of\nparsons, and to send, if possible, every parson's wife home with a\ngreen fit of jealousy. None could be too old for her, and hardly\nany too young. None too sanctified, and none too worldly. She was\nquite prepared to entrap the bishop himself, and then to turn up\nher nose at the bishop's wife. She did not doubt of success, for\nshe had always succeeded; but one thing was absolutely necessary,\nshe must secure the entire use of a sofa.\n\nThe card sent to Dr and Mrs Stanhope and family, had been sent in\nan envelope, having on the cover Mr Slope's name. The signora soon\nlearnt that Mrs Proudie was not yet at the palace, and that the\nchaplain was managing everything. It was much more in her line to\napply to him than to the lady, and she accordingly wrote to him the\nprettiest little billet in the world. In five lines she explained\neverything, declared how impossible it was for her not to be\ndesirous to make the acquaintance of such persons as the bishop of\nBarchester and his wife, and she might add also of Mr Slope,\ndepicted her own grievous state, and concluded by being assured\nthat Mrs Proudie would forgive her extreme hardihood in petitioning\nto be allowed to be carried to a sofa. She then enclosed one of her\nbeautiful cards. In return she received as polite an answer from Mr\nSlope--a sofa should be kept in the large drawing-room, immediately\nat the top of the grand stairs, especially for her use.\n\nAnd now the day of the party had arrived. The bishop and his wife\ncame down from town, only on the morning of the eventful day, as\nbehoved such great people to do; but Mr Slope had toiled day and\nnight to see that everything should be in right order. There had\nbeen much to do. No company had been seen in the palace since\nheaven knows when. New furniture had been required, new pots and\npans, new cups and saucers, new dishes and plates. Mrs Proudie had\nfirst declared that she would condescend to nothing so vulgar as\neating and drinking; but Mr Slope had talked, or rather written her\nout of economy!--bishops should be given to hospitality, and\nhospitality meant eating and drinking. So the supper was conceded;\nthe guests, however, were to stand as they consumed it.\n\nThere were four rooms opening into each other on the first floor of\nthe house, which were denominated the drawing-rooms, the\nreception-room, and Mrs Proudie's boudoir. In olden days one of\nthese had been Bishop Grantly's bed-room, and another his common,\nsitting-room and study. The present bishop, however, had been moved\ndown into a back parlour, and had been given to understand that he\ncould very well receive his clergy in the dining-room, should they\narrive in too large a flock to be admitted to his small sanctum. He\nhad been unwilling to yield, but after a short debate had yielded.\n\nMrs Proudie's heart beat high as she inspected her suite of rooms.\nThey were really very magnificent, or at least would be so by\ncandlelight; and they had nevertheless been got up with commendable\neconomy. Large rooms when full of people, and full of light look\nwell, because they are large, and are full, and are light. Small\nrooms are those which require costly fittings and rich furniture.\nMrs Proudie knew this, and made the most of it; she had therefore a\nhuge gas lamp with a dozen burners hanging from each of the\nceilings.\n\nPeople were to arrive at ten, supper was to last from twelve to\none, and at half-past one everybody was to be gone. Carriages were\nto come in at the gate in the town and depart at the gate outside.\nThey were desired to take up at a quarter before one. It was\nmanaged excellently, and Mr Slope was invaluable.\n\nAt half-past nine the bishop and his wife and their three daughters\nentered the great reception-room, and very grand and very solemn\nthey were. Mr Slope was down-stairs giving the last orders about\nthe wine. He well understood that curates and country vicars with\ntheir belongings did not require so generous an article as the\ndignitaries of the close. There is a useful gradation in such\nthings, and Marsala at 20s a dozen did very well for the exterior\nsupplementary tables in the corner.\n\n'Bishop,' said the lady, as his lordship sat himself down, 'don't\nsit on that sofa, if you please; it is to be kept separate for a\nlady.'\n\nThe bishop jumped up and seated himself on a cane-bottomed chair.\n'A lady?' he inquired meekly; 'do you mean one particular lady, my\ndear?'\n\n'Yes, bishop, one particular lady,' said his wife, disdaining to\nexplain.\n\n'She has got no legs, papa,' said the youngest daughter, tittering.\n\n'No legs!' said the bishop, opening his eyes.\n\n'Nonsense, Netta, what stuff you talk,' said Olivia. 'She has got\nlegs, but she can't use them. She has always to be kept lying down,\nand three or four men carry her about everywhere.'\n\n'Laws, how odd!' said Augusta. 'Always carried about by four men!\nI'm quite sure I wouldn't like it. Am I right behind, mama? I feel\nas if I was open;' and she turned her back to her anxious parent.\n\n'Open! To be sure you are,' said she, 'and a yard of petticoat\nstrings hanging out. I don't know why I pay such high wages to Mrs\nRichards, if she can't take the trouble to see whether or no you\nare fit to be looked at,' and Mrs Proudie poked the strings here,\nand twitched the dress there, and gave her daughter a shove and a\nshake, and then pronounced it all right.\n\n'But,' rejoined the bishop, who was dying with curiosity about the\nmysterious lady and her legs, 'who is it that is to have the sofa?\nWhat is her name, Netta?'\n\nA thundering rap at the front door interrupted the conversation.\nMrs Proudie stood up and shook herself gently, and touched her cap\non each side as she looked in the mirror. Each of the girls stood\non tiptoe, and re-arranged the bows on their bosoms; and Mr Slope\nrushed up stairs three steps at a time.\n\n'But who is it, Netta?' whispered the bishop to his youngest\ndaughter.\n\n'La Signora Madeline Vesey Neroni,' whispered back the daughter;\n'and mind you don't let any one sit upon the sofa.'\n\n'La Signora Madeline Vicinironi!' muttered, to himself, the\nbewildered prelate. Had he been told that the Begum of Oude was to\nbe there, or Queen Pomara of the Western Isles, he could not have\nbeen more astonished. La Signora Madeline Vicinironi, who, having\nno legs to stand on, had bespoken a sofa in his drawing-room!--who\ncould she be? He however could now make no further inquiry, as Dr\nand Mrs Stanhope were announced. They had been sent on out of the\nway a little before the time, in order that the signora might have\nplenty of time to get herself conveniently packed into the\ncarriage.\n\nThe bishop was all smiles for the prebendary's wife, and the\nbishop's wife was all smiles for the prebendary. Mr Slope was\npresented, and was delighted to make the acquaintance of one of\nwhom he had heard so much. The doctor bowed very low, and then\nlooked as though he could not return the compliment as regarded Mr\nSlope, of whom, indeed, he had heard nothing. The doctor, in spite\nof his long absence, knew an English gentleman when he saw him.\n\nAnd then the guests came in shoals; Mr and Mrs Quiverful and their\nthree grown daughters. Mr and Mrs Chadwick and their three\ndaughters. The burly chancellor and his wife and clerical son from\nOxford. The meagre little doctor without encumbrance. Mr Harding\nwith Eleanor and Miss Bold. The dean leaning on a gaunt spinster,\nhis only child now living with him, a lady very learned in stones,\nferns, plants, and vermin, and who had written a book about petals.\nA wonderful woman in her way was Miss Trefoil. Mr Finnie, the\nattorney, with his wife, was to be seen, much to the dismay of many\nwho had never met him in a drawing-room before. The five Barchester\ndoctors were all there, and old Scalpen, the retired apothecary and\ntoothdrawer, who was first taught to consider himself as belonging\nto the higher orders by the receipt of the bishop's card. Then came\nthe archdeacon and his wife, with their elder daughter Griselda, a\nslim pale retiring girl of seventeen, who kept close to her mother,\nand looked out on the world with quiet watchful eyes, one who gave\npromise of much beauty when time should have ripened it.\n\nAnd so the room became full, and knots were formed, and every new\ncomer paid his respects to my lord and passed on, not presuming to\noccupy too much of the great man's attention. The archdeacon shook\nhands very heartily with Dr Stanhope, and Mrs Grantly seated\nherself by the doctor's wife. And Mrs Proudie moved about with well\nregulated grace, measuring out the quantity of her favours to the\nquality of her guests, just as Mr Slope had been doing with the\nwine. But the sofa was still empty, and five-and-twenty ladies and\nfive gentlemen had been courteously warned off it by the mindful\nchaplain.\n\n'Why doesn't she come?' said the bishop to himself. His mind was so\npreoccupied with the signora, that he hardly remembered how to\nbehave himself en bishop.\n\nAt last a carriage dashed up to the hall steps with a very\ndifferent manner of approach from that of any other vehicle that\nhad been there that evening. A perfect commotion took place. The\ndoctor, who heard it as he was standing in the drawing-room, knew\nthat his daughter was coming, and retired to the furthest corner,\nwhere he might not see her entrance. Mrs Proudie parked herself up,\nfeeling that some important piece of business was in hand. The\nbishop was instinctively aware, that La Signora Vicinironi was come\nat last, and Mr Slope hurried to the hall to give his assistance.\n\nHe was, however, nearly knocked down and trampled on by the cortege\nthat he encountered on the hall steps. He got himself picked up as\nwell as he could, and followed the cortege up stairs. The signora\nwas carried head foremost, her head being the care of her brother\nand an Italian man-servant who was accustomed to the work; her feet\nwere in the care of the lady's maid and the lady's Italian page;\nand Charlotte Stanhope followed to see that all was done with due\ngrace and decorum. In this manner they climbed easily into the\ndrawing-room, and a broad way through the crowd having been opened,\nthe signora rested safely on her couch. She had sent a servant\nbeforehand to learn whether it was a right or a left hand sofa, for\nit required that she should dress accordingly, particularly as\nregarded her bracelets.\n\nAnd very becoming her dress was. It was white velvet, without any\nother garniture than rich white lace worked with pearls across her\nbosom, and the same round the armlets of her dress. Across her brow\nshe wore a band of red velvet, on the centre of which shone a\nmagnificent Cupid in mosaic, the tints of whose wings were of the\nmost lovely azure, and the colour of his chubby cheeks the clearest\npink. On the one arm which her position required her to expose she\nwore three magnificent bracelets, each of different stones. Beneath\nher on the sofa, and over the cushion and head of it, was spread a\ncrimson silk mantle or shawl, which went under her whole body and\nconcealed her feet. Dressed as she was and looking as she did, so\nbeautiful and yet so motionless, with the pure brilliancy of her\nwhite dress brought out and strengthened by the colour beneath it,\nwith that lovely head, and those large bold bright staring eyes, it\nwas impossible that either man or woman should do other than look\nat her.\n\nNeither man nor woman for some minutes did do other.\n\nHer bearers too were worthy of note. The three servants were\nItalian, and though perhaps not peculiar in their own country, were\nvery much so in the palace at Barchester. The man, especially\nattracted notice, and created a doubt in the mind of some whether\nhe were a friend or a domestic. The same doubt was felt as to\nEthelbert. The man was attired in a loose-fitting common black\ncloth morning coat. He had a jaunty well-pleased clean face, on\nwhich no atom of beard appeared, and he wore round his neck a loose\nblack silk neckhandkerchief. The bishop assayed to make him a bow,\nbut the man, who was well-trained, took no notice of him, and\nwalked out of the room, quite at his ease, followed by the woman\nand the boy.\n\nEthelbert Stanhope was dressed in light blue from head to foot. He\nhad on the loosest possible blue coat, cut square like a shooting\ncoat, and very short. It was lined with silk of azure blue. He had\non a blue satin waistcoat, a blue handkerchief which was fastened\nbeneath his throat with a coral ring, and very loose blue trousers\nwhich almost concealed his feet. His soft glossy beard was softer\nand more glossy than ever.\n\nThe bishop, who had made one mistake, thought that he also was a\nservant, and therefore tried to make way for him to pass. But\nEthelbert soon corrected the error.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nMRS PROUDIE'S RECEPTION--CONCLUDED\n\n'Bishop of Barchester, I presume?' said Bertie Stanhope, putting\nout his hand, frankly; 'I am delighted to make your acquaintance.\nWe are in rather close quarters here, a'nt we?'\n\nIn truth they were. They had been crowded up behind the head of the\nsofa: the bishop in waiting to receive his guest, and the other in\ncarrying her; and they now had hardly room to move themselves.\n\nThe bishop gave his hand quickly, and made a little studied bow,\nand was delighted to make--. He couldn't go on, for he did not know\nwhether his friend was a signor, or a count, or a prince.\n\n'My sister really puts you all to great trouble,' said Bertie.\n\n'Not at all!' the bishop was delighted to have the opportunity of\nwelcoming the Signora Vicinironi--so at least he said--and\nattempted to force his way round to the front of the sofa. He had,\nat any rate, learnt that his strange guests were brother and\nsister. The man, he presumed, must be Signor Vicinironi--or count,\nor prince, as it might be. It was wonderful what good English he\nspoke. There was just a twang of foreign accent, and no more.\n\n'Do you like Barchester on the whole?' asked Bertie.\n\nThe bishop, looking dignified, said that he did like Barchester.\n\n'You've not been here very long, I believe,' said Bertie.\n\n'No--not long,' said the bishop, and tried again to make his way\nbetween the back of the sofa and a heavy rector, who was staring\nover it at the grimaces of the signora.\n\n'You weren't a bishop before, were you?'\n\nDr Proudie explained that this was the first diocese he had held.\n\n'Ah--I thought so,' said Bertie; 'but you are changed about\nsometimes, a'nt you?'\n\n'Translations are occasionally made,' said Dr Proudie; 'but not so\nfrequently as in former days.\n\n'They've cut them all down to pretty nearly the same figure,\nhaven't they?' said Bertie.\n\nTo this the bishop could not bring himself to make any answer, but\nagain tried to move the rector.\n\n'But the work, I suppose, is different?' continued Bertie. 'Is\nthere much to do here at Barchester?' This was said exactly in the\ntone that a young Admiralty clerk might use in asking the same\nquestion of a brother acolyte in the Treasury.\n\n'The work of a bishop of the Church of England,' said Dr Proudie,\nwith considerable dignity, 'is not easy. The responsibility which\nhe has to bear is very great indeed.'\n\n'Is it?' said Bertie, opening wide his wonderful blue eyes. 'Well;\nI never was afraid of responsibility. I once thought of being a\nbishop myself.'\n\n'Had thought of being a bishop?' said Dr Proudie, much amazed.\n\n'That is, a parson--a parson first, you know, and a bishop\nafterwards. If I had once begun, I'd have stuck to it. But, on the\nwhole, I like the Church of Rome the best.'\n\nThe bishop could not discuss the point, so he remained silent.\n\n'Now, there's my father,' continued Bertie; 'he hasn't stuck to it.\nI fancy he didn't like saying the same thing so often. By the bye,\nbishop, have you seen my father?'\n\nThe bishop was more amazed than ever. Had he seen his father? 'No,'\nhe replied; he had not yet had the pleasure; he hoped he might;\nand, as he said so, he resolved to bear heavy on that fat,\nimmoveable rector, if ever he had the power of doing so.\n\n'He's in the room somewhere,' said Bertie, 'and he'll turn up soon.\nBy the bye, do you know much about the Jews?'\n\nAt last the bishop saw a way out. 'I beg your pardon,' said he;\n'but I'm forced to go round the room.'\n\n'Well--I believe I'll follow in your wake,' said Bertie. 'Terribly\nhot, isn't it?' This he addressed to the fat rector with whom he\nhad brought himself into the closest contact. 'They've got this\nsofa into the worst possible part of the room; suppose we move it.\nTake care, Madeline.'\n\nThe sofa had certainly been so placed that those who were behind it\nfound great difficulty in getting out;--there was but a narrow\ngangway, which one person could stop. This was a bad arrangement,\nand one which Bertie thought it might be well to improve.\n\n'Take care, Madeline,' said he; and turning to the fat rector,\nadded, 'Just help me with a slight push.'\n\nThe rector's weight was resting on the sofa, and unwittingly lent\nall its impetus to accelerate and increase the motion which Bertie\nintentionally originated. The sofa rushed from its moorings, and\nran half-way into the middle of the room. Mrs Proudie was standing\nwith Mr Slope in front of the signora, and had been trying to be\ncondescending and sociable; but she was not in the very best of\ntempers; for she found that whenever she spoke to the lady, the\nlady replied by speaking to Mr Slope. Mr Slope was a favourite, no\ndoubt; but Mrs Proudie had no idea of being less thought of than\nthe chaplain. She was beginning to be stately, stiff, and offended,\nwhen unfortunately the castor of the sofa caught itself in her lace\ntrain, and carried away there is no saying how much of her\ngarniture. Gathers were heard to go, stitches to crack, plaits to\nfly open, flounces were seen to fall, and breadths to expose\nthemselves;--a long ruin of rent lace disfigured the carpet, and\nstill clung to the vile wheel on which the sofa moved.\n\nSo, when a granite battery is raised, excellent to the eyes of\nwarfaring men, is its strength and symmetry admired. It is the work\nof years. Its neat embrasures, its finished parapets, its casemated\nstories, show all the skill of modern science. But, anon, a small\nspark is applied to the treacherous fusee--a cloud of dust arises\nto the heavens--and then nothing is to be seen but dirt and dust\nand ugly fragments.\n\nWe know what was the wrath of Juno when her beauty was despised. We\nknow too what storms of passion even celestial minds can yield. As\nJuno may have looked at Paris on Mount Ida, so did Mrs Proudie look\non Ethelbert Stanhope when he pushed the leg of the sofa into her\ntrain.\n\n'Oh, you idiot, Bertie!' said the signora, seeing what had been\ndone, and what were the consequences.\n\n'Idiot,' re-echoed Mrs Proudie, as though the word were not half\nstrong enough to express the required meaning; 'I'll let him know\n-;' and then looking round to learn, at a glance, the worst, she\nsaw that at present it behoved her to collect the scattered debris\nof her dress.\n\nBertie, when he saw what he had done, rushed over the sofa, and\nthrew himself on one knee before the offended lady. His object,\ndoubtless, was to liberate the torn lace from the castor; but he\nlooked as though he were imploring pardon from a goddess.\n\n'Unhand it, sir!' said Mrs Proudie. From what scrap of dramatic\npoetry she had extracted the word cannot be said; but it must have\nrested on her memory, and now seemed opportunely dignified for the\noccasion.\n\n'I'll fly to the looms of the fairies to repair the damage, if\nyou'll only forgive me,' said Ethelbert, still on his knees.\n\n'Unhand it, sir!' said Mrs Proudie, with redoubled emphasis, and\nall but furious wrath. This allusion to the fairies was a direct\nmockery, and intended to turn her into ridicule. So at least it\nseemed to her. 'Unhand it, sir!' she almost screamed.\n\n'It's not me; it's the cursed sofa,' said Bertie, looking\nimploringly in her face, and holding both his hands to show that he\nwas not touching her belongings, but still remaining on his knees.\n\nHereupon the signora laughed; not loud, indeed, but yet audibly.\nAnd as the tigress bereft of her young will turn with equal anger\non any within reach, so did Mrs Proudie turn upon her female guest.\n\n'Madam,' she said--and it is beyond the power of prose to tell of\nthe fire that flashed from her eyes.\n\nBy this time the bishop, and Mr Slope, and her three daughters were\naround her, and had collected together the wide ruins of her\nmagnificence. The girls fell into circular rank behind their\nmother, and thus following her and carrying out the fragments, they\nleft the reception-rooms in a manner not altogether devoid of\ndignity. Mrs Proudie had to retire to re-array herself.\n\nAs soon as the constellation had swept by, Ethelbert rose from his\nknees, and turning with mock anger to the fat rector, said: 'After\nall it was your doing, sir--not mine. But perhaps you are waiting\nfor preferment, and so I bore it.'\n\nWhereupon there was a laugh against the fat rector, in which both\nthe bishop and the chaplain joined; and thus things got themselves\nagain into order.\n\n'Oh, my lord, I am so sorry for this accident,' said the signora,\nputting out her hand so as to force the bishop to take it. 'My\nbrother is so thoughtless. Pray sit down, and let me have the\npleasure of making your acquaintance. Though I am so poor a\ncreature as to want a sofa, I am not so selfish as to require it\nall.' Madeline could always dispose herself so as to make room for\na gentleman, though, as she declared, the crinoline of her lady\nfriends was much too bulky to be so accommodated.\n\n'It was solely for the pleasure of meeting you that I have had\nmyself dragged here,' she continued. 'Of course, with your\noccupation, one cannot even hope that you should have time to come\nto us, that is, in the way of calling. And at your English\ndinner-parties all is so dull and so stately. Do you know, my lord,\nthat in coming to England my only consolation has been the thought\nthat I should know you;' and she looked at him with the look of a\nshe-devil.\n\nThe bishop, however, thought that she looked very like an angel,\nand accepting the proffered seat, sat down beside her. He uttered\nsome platitude as to this deep obligation for the trouble she had\ntaken, and wondered more and more who she was.\n\n'Of course you know my sad story?' she continued.\n\nThe bishop didn't know a word of it. He knew, however, or thought\nhe knew, that she couldn't walk into a room like other people, and\nso made the most of that. He put on a look of ineffable distress,\nand said that he was aware how God had afflicted her.\n\nThe signora just touched the corner of her eyes with the most\nlovely of pocket-handkerchiefs. Yes, she said--she had been very\nsorely tried--tried, she thought, beyond the common endurance of\nhumanity; but while her child was left to her, everything was left.\n'Oh! My lord,' she exclaimed, 'you must see the infant--the last\nbud of a wondrous tree: you must let a mother hope that you will\nlay your holy hands on her innocent head, and consecrate her for\nfemale virtues. May I hope it?' said she, looking into the bishop's\neye, and touching the bishop's arm with her hand.\n\nThe bishop was but a man, and said she might. After all, what was\nit but a request that he would confirm her daughter?--a request,\nindeed, very unnecessary to make, as he should do so as a matter of\ncourse, if the young lady came forward in the usual way.\n\n'The blood of Tiberius,' said the signora, in all but a whisper;\n'the blood of Tiberius flows in her veins. She is the last of the\nNeros!'\n\nThe bishop had heard of the last of the Visigoths, and had floating\nin his brain some indistinct idea of the last of the Mohicans, but\nto have the last of the Neros thus brought before him for a\nblessing was very staggering. Still he liked the lady: she had a\nproper way of thinking, and talked with more propriety than her\nbrother. But who were they? It was now quite clear that that blue\nmadman with the silky beard was not a Prince Vicinironi. The lady\nwas married, and was of course one of the Vicinironis by right of\nthe husband. So the bishop went on learning.\n\n'When will you see her?' said the signora with a start.\n\n'See whom?' said the bishop.\n\n'My child,' said the mother.\n\n'What is the young lady's age?' asked the bishop.\n\n'She is just seven,' said the signora.\n\n'Oh,' said the bishop, shaking his head; 'she is much too\nyoung--very much too young.'\n\n'But in sunny Italy you know, we do not count by years,' and the\nsignora gave the bishop one of her very sweetest smiles.\n\n'But indeed, she is a great deal too young,' persisted the bishop;\n'we never confirm before--'\n\n'But you might speak to her; you might let her hear from your\nconsecrated lips, that she is not a castaway because she is a\nRoman; that she may be a Nero and yet a Christian; that she may owe\nher black locks and dark cheeks to the blood of the pagan Caesars,\nand yet herself be a child of grace; you will tell her this, won't\nyou, my friend?'\n\nThe friend said he would, and asked if the child could say her\ncatechisms.\n\n'No,' said the signora, 'I would not allow her to learn lessons\nsuch as those in a land ridden by priests, and polluted by the\nidolatry of Rome. It is here, here in Barchester, that she must\nfirst be taught to lisp those holy words. Oh, that you could be her\ninstructor!'\n\nNow, Dr Proudie certainly liked the lady, but, seeing that he was a\nbishop, it was not probable that he was going to instruct a little\ngirl in the first rudiments of her catechism; so he said he'd send\na teacher.\n\n'But you will see her yourself, my lord?'\n\nThe bishop said he would, but where should he call.\n\n'At papa's house,' said the signora, with an air of some little\nsurprise at the question.\n\nThe bishop actually wanted the courage to ask her who was her papa;\nso he was forced at last to leave her without fathoming her\nmystery. Mrs Proudie, in her second best, had now returned to the\nrooms, and her husband thought it as well that he should not remain\nin too close conversation with the lady whom his wife appeared to\nhold in such slight esteem. Presently he came across his youngest\ndaughter.\n\n'Netta,' said he, 'do you know who is the father of that Signora\nVicinironi?'\n\n'It isn't Vicinironi, papa,' said Netta; 'but Vesey Neroni, and\nshe's Dr Stanhope's daughter. But I must go and do the civil to\nGriselda Grantly; I declare nobody has spoken a word to the poor\ngirl this evening.\n\nDr Stanhope! Dr Vesey Stanhope! Dr Vesey Stanhope's daughter, of\nwhose marriage with a dissolute Italian scamp he now remembered to\nhave heard something! And that impertinent blue cub who had\nexamined him as to his episcopal bearings was old Stanhope's son,\nand the lady who had entreated him to come and teach her child the\ncatechism was old Stanhope's daughter! The daughter of one of his\nown prebendaries! As these things flashed across his mind, he was\nnearly as angry as his wife had been. Nevertheless he could not but\nown that the mother of the last of the Neros was an agreeable\nwoman.\n\nDr Proudie tripped out into the adjoining room, in which were\ncongregated a crowd of Grantlyite clergymen, among whom the\narchdeacon was standing pre-eminent, while the old dean was sitting\nnearly buried in a huge armchair by the fire-place. The bishop was\nvery anxious to be gracious, and, if possible, to diminish the\nbitterness which his chaplain had occasioned. Let Mr Slope do the\nfortiter in re, he himself would pour in the suaviter in modo.\n\n'Pray don't stir, Mr Dean, pray don't stir,' he said, as the old\nman essayed to get up; 'I take it as a great kindness, your coming\nto such an omnium gatherum as this. But we have hardly got settled\nyet, and Mrs Proudie has not been able to see her friends as she\nwould wish to do. Well, Mr Archdeacon, after all, we have not been\nso hard upon you at Oxford.'\n\n'No,' said the archdeacon; 'you've only drawn our teeth and cut out\nour tongues; you've allowed us still to breathe and swallow.'\n\n'Ha, ha, ha!' laughed the bishop; 'it's not quite so easy to cut\nout the tongue of an Oxford magnate,--and as for teeth,--ha, ha,\nha! Why, in the way we've left the matter, it's very odd if the\nheads of colleges don't have their own way quite as fully as when\nthe hebdomadal board was in all its glory; what do you say, Mr\nDean?'\n\n'An old man, my lord, never likes changes,' said the dean.\n\n'You must have been sad bunglers if it is so,' said the archdeacon;\n'and indeed, to tell the truth, I think you have bungled it. At any\nrate, you must own this; you have not done the half what you\nboasted you would do.'\n\n'Now, as regards your system of professors--' began the chancellor\nslowly. He was never destined to get beyond the beginning.\n\n'Talking of professors,' said a soft clear voice close behind the\nchancellor's elbow; 'how much you Englishmen might learn from\nGermany; only you are all too proud.'\n\nThe bishop looking round, perceived that abominable young Stanhope\nhad pursued him. The dean stared at him, as though he was some\nunearthly apparition; so also did two or three prebendaries and\nminor canons. The archdeacon laughed.\n\n'The German professors are men of learning,' said Mr Harding,\n'but--'\n\n'German professors!' groaned out the chancellor, as though his\nnervous system had received a shock which nothing but a week of\nOxford air would cure.\n\n'Yes,' continued Ethelbert; not at all understanding why a German\nprofessor should be contemptible in the eyes of an Oxford don. 'Not\nbut what the name is best earned at Oxford. In Germany the\nprofessors do teach; at Oxford, I believe they only profess to do\nso, and sometimes not even that. You'll have those universities of\nyours about your ears soon, if you don't consent to take a lesson\nfrom Germany.'\n\nThere was no answering this. Dignified clergymen of sixty years of\nage could not condescend to discuss such a matter with a young man\nwith such clothes and such a beard.\n\n'Have you got good water out at Plumstead, Mr Archdeacon?' said the\nbishop by way of changing the conversation.\n\n'Pretty good,' said the archdeacon.\n\n'But by no means so good as his wine, my lord,' said a witty minor\ncanon.\n\n'Nor so generally used,' said another; 'that is for inward\napplication.'\n\n'Ha, ha, ha!' laughed the bishop, 'a good cellar of wine is a very\ncomfortable thing in a house.'\n\n'Your German professors, sir, prefer beer, I believe,' said the\nsarcastic little meagre prebendary.\n\n'They don't think much of either,' said Ethelbert; 'and that\nperhaps accounts for their superiority. Now the Jewish professor -'\n\nThe insult was becoming too deep for the spirit of Oxford to\nendure, so the archdeacon walked off one way and the chancellor\nanother, followed by their disciples, and the bishop and the young\nreformer were left together on the hearth-rug.\n\n'I was a Jew once myself,' said Bertie.\n\nThe bishop was determined not to stand another examination, or be\nled on any terms into Palestine; so he again remembered that he had\nto do something very particular, and left young Stanhope with the\ndean. The dean did not get the worst of it, for Ethelbert gave him\na true account of his remarkable doings in the Holy Land.\n\n'Oh, Mr Harding,' said the bishop, overtaking the ci-devant warden;\n'I wanted to say one word about the hospital. You know, of course,\nthat it is to be filled up.'\n\nMr Harding's heart beat a little, and he said that he had heard so.\n\n'Of course,' continued the bishop; 'there can be only one man whom\nI could wish to see in that situation. I don't know what your own\nviews may be, Mr Harding--'\n\n'They are very simply told, my lord,' said the other; 'to take the\nplace if it be offered me, and to put up with the want of it should\nanother man get it.'\n\nThe bishop professed himself delighted to hear it; Mr Harding might\nbe quite sure that no other man would get it. There were some few\ncircumstances which would in a slight degree change the nature of\nthe duties. Mr Harding was probably aware of this, and would,\nperhaps, not object to discuss the matter with Mr Slope. It was a\nsubject to which Mr Slope had given a good deal of attention.\n\nMr Harding felt, he knew not why, oppressed and annoyed. What could\nMr Slope do to him? He knew that there were to be changes. The\nnature of them must be communicated to the warden through somebody,\nand through whom so naturally as the bishop's chaplain. 'Twas thus\nthat he tried to argue himself back to an easy mind, but in vain.\n\nMr Slope in the mean time had taken the seat which the bishop had\nvacated on the signora's sofa, and remained with that lady till it\nwas time to marshal the folk to supper. Not with contented eyes had\nMrs Proudie seen this. Had not this woman laughed at her distress,\nand had not Mr Slope heard it? Was she not an intriguing Italian\nwoman, half wife and half not, full of affectation, airs, and\nimpudence? Was she not horribly bedizened with velvet and pearls,\nwith velvet and pearls, too, which had been torn off her back?\nAbove all, did she not pretend to be more beautiful than her\nneighbours? To say that Mrs Proudie was jealous would give a wrong\nidea of her feelings. She had not the slightest desire that Mr\nSlope should be in love with herself. But she desired the incense\nof Mr Slope's spiritual and temporal services, and did not choose\nthat they should be turned out of their course to such an object as\nSignora Neroni. She considered also that Mr Slope ought in duty to\nhate the signora; and it appeared from his manner that he was very\nfar from hating her.\n\n'Come, Mr Slope,' she said, sweeping by, and looking all that she\nfelt; 'can't you make yourself useful? Do pray take Mrs Grantly\ndown to supper.'\n\nMrs Grantly heard and escaped. The words were hardly out of Mrs\nProudie's mouth, before the intended victim had stuck her hand\nthrough the arm of one of her husband's curates, and saved herself.\nWhat would the archdeacon have said had he seen her walking down\nstairs with Mr Slope?\n\nMr Slope heard also, but was by no means so obedient as was\nexpected. Indeed, the period of Mr Slope's obedience to Mrs Proudie\nwas drawing to a close. He did not wish yet to break with her, nor\nto break with her at all, if it could be avoided. But he intended\nto be master in that palace, and as she had made the same\nresolution, it was not improbable that they might come to blows.\n\nBefore leaving the signora he arranged a little table before her,\nand begged to know what he should bring her. She was quite\nindifferent, she said--nothing--anything. It was now she felt the\nmisery of her position, now that she must be left alone. Well, a\nlittle chicken, some ham, and a glass of champagne.\n\nMr Slope had to explain, not without blushing for his patron, that\nthere was no champagne.\n\nSherry would do just as well. And then Mr Slope descended with the\nlearned Miss Trefoil on his arm. Could she tell him, he asked,\nwhether the ferns of Barsetshire were equal to those of Cumberland?\nHis strongest worldly passion was for ferns--and before she could\nanswer him he left her wedged between the door and the sideboard.\nIt was fifty minutes before she escaped, and even then unfed.\n\n'You are not leaving us, Mr Slope,' said the watchful lady of the\nhouse, seeing her slave escaping towards the door, with stores of\nprovisions held high above the heads of the guests.\n\nMr Slope explained that the Signora Neroni was in want of her\nsupper.\n\n'Pray, Mr Slope, let her brother take it to her,' said Mrs Proudie,\nquite out loud. 'It is out of the question that you should be so\nemployed. Pray, Mr Slope, oblige me; I am sure Mr Stanhope will\nwait upon his sister.'\n\nEthelbert was most agreeably occupied in the furthest corner of the\nroom, making himself both useful and agreeable to Mrs Proudie's\nyoungest daughter.\n\n'I couldn't get out, madam, if Madeline were starving for her\nsupper,' said he; 'I'm physically fixed, unless I could fly.'\n\nThe lady's anger was increased by seeing that her daughter had gone\nover to the enemy; and when she saw, that in spite of her\nremonstrances, in the teeth of her positive orders, Mr Slope went\noff to the drawing-room, the cup of her indignation ran over, and\nshe could not restrain herself. 'Such manners I never saw,' she\nsaid, muttering. 'I cannot, and will not permit it;' and then,\nafter fussing and fuming for a few minutes, she pushed her way\nthrough the crowd, and followed Mr Slope.\n\nWhen she reached the room above, she found it absolutely deserted,\nexcept for the guilty pair. The signora was sitting very\ncomfortably up for her supper, and Mr Slope was leaning over her\nand administering to her wants. They had been discussing the merits\nof Sabbath-day schools, and the lady suggested that as she could\nnot possibly go to the children, she might be indulged in the wish\nof her heart by having the children brought to her.\n\n'And when shall it be, Mr Slope?' said she.\n\nMr Slope was saved the necessity of committing himself to a promise\nby the entry of Mrs Proudie. She swept close up to the sofa so as\nto confront the guilty pair, stared full at them for a moment, and\nthen said as she passed on to the next room, 'Mr Slope, his\nlordship is especially desirous of your attendance below; you will\ngreatly oblige me if you will join him.' And so she stalked on.\n\nMr Slope muttered something in reply, and prepared to go down\nstairs. As for the bishop's wanting him, he knew his lady patroness\nwell enough to take that assertion at what it was worth; but he did\nnot wish to make himself the hero of a scene, or to become\nconspicuous for more gallantry than the occasion required.\n\n'Is she always like this?' said the signora.\n\n'Yes--always--madam,' said Mrs Proudie, returning; 'always the\nsame--always equally adverse to the impropriety of conduct of every\ndescription;' and she stalked back through the room again,\nfollowing Mr Slope out of the door.\n\nThe signora couldn't follow her, or she certainly would have done\nso. But she laughed loud, and sent the sound of it ringing through\nthe lobby and down the stairs after Mrs Proudie's feet. Had she\nbeen as active as Grimaldi, she could probably have taken no better\nrevenge.\n\n'But she's lame, Mrs Proudie, and cannot move. Somebody must have\nwaited upon her.'\n\n'Lame,' said Mrs Proudie; 'I'd lame her if she belonged to me. What\nbusiness had she here at all?--such impertinence--such\naffectation.'\n\nIn the hall and adjacent rooms all manner of cloaking and shawling\nwas going on, and the Barchester folk were getting themselves gone.\nMrs Proudie did her best to smirk at each and every one, as they\nmade their adieux, but she was hardly successful. Her temper had\nbeen tried fearfully. By slow degrees, the guests went.\n\n'Send back the carriage quick,' said Ethelbert, as Dr and Mrs\nStanhope took their departure.\n\nThe younger Stanhopes were left to the very last, and an\nuncomfortable party they made with the bishop's family. They all\nwent into the dining-room, and then the bishop observing that the\n'lady' was alone in the drawing-room, they followed him up. Mrs\nProudie kept Mr Slope and her daughters in close conversation,\nresolving that he should not be indulged, nor they polluted. The\nbishop, in mortal dread of Bertie and the Jews, tried to converse\nwith Charlotte Stanhope about the climate of Italy. Bertie and the\nsignora had not resource but in each other.\n\n'Did you get your supper at last, Madeline?' said the impudent or\nelse mischievous young man.\n\n'Oh, yes,' said Madeline; 'Mr Slope was so very kind to bring it\nme. I fear, however, he put himself to more inconvenience than I\nwished.'\n\nMrs Proudie looked at her, but said nothing. The meaning of her\nlook might have been translated: 'If ever you find yourself within\nthese walls again, I'll give you leave to be as impudent and\naffected, and as mischievous as you please.'\n\nAt last the carriage returned with the three Italian servants, and\nla Signora Madeline Vesey Neroni was carried out, as she had been\ncarried in.\n\nThe lady of the palace retired to her chamber by no means contented\nwith the result of her first grand party at Barchester.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nSLOPE VERSUS HARDING\n\nTwo or three days after the party, Mr Harding received a note,\nbegging him to call on Mr Slope, at the palace, at an early hour\nthe following morning. There was nothing uncivil in the\ncommunication, and yet the tone of it was thoroughly displeasing.\nIt was as follows:\n\n\"My dear Mr Harding, Will you favour me by calling on me at the\npalace to-morrow morning at 9.30am. The bishop wishes me to speak\nto you touching the hospital. I hope you will excuse my naming so\nearly an hour. I do so as my time is greatly occupied. If, however,\nit is positively inconvenient to you, I will change it to 10. You\nwill, perhaps, be kind enough to give me a note in reply.\n\n\"Believe me to be, My dear Mr Harding,\nYour assured friend, OBH. SLOPE\n\n\"The Palace, Monday morning, \"20th August, 185-\"\n\nMr Harding neither could nor would believe anything of the sort;\nand he thought, moreover, that Mr Slope was rather impertinent to\ncall himself by such a name. His assured friend, indeed! How many\nassured friends generally fall to the lot of a man in this world?\nAnd by what process are they made? And how much of such process had\ntaken place as yet between Mr Harding and Mr Slope? Mr Harding\ncould not help asking himself these questions as he read and\nre-read the note before him. He answered it, as follows:\n\n\"Dear Sir,--I will call at the palace to-morrow at 9.30 AM as you\ndesire.\n\n\"Truly yours, S. HARDING\"\n\nAnd on the following morning, punctually at half-past nine, he\nknocked at the palace door, and asked for Mr Slope.\n\nThe bishop had one small room allotted to him on the ground-floor,\nand Mr Slope had another. Into this latter Mr Harding was shown,\nand asked to sit down. Mr Slope was not yet there. The ex-warden\nstood up at the window looking into the garden, and could not help\nthinking how very short a time had passed since the whole of that\nhouse had been open to him, as though he had been a child of the\nfamily, born and bred in it. He remembered how the old servants\nused to smile as they opened the door to him; how the familiar\nbutler would say, when he had been absent for a few hours longer\nthan usual: 'A sight of you, Mr Harding, is good for sore eyes;'\nhow the fussy housekeeper would swear that he couldn't have dined,\nor couldn't have breakfasted, or couldn't have lunched. And then,\nabove all, he remembered the pleasant gleam of inward satisfaction\nwhich always spread itself over the old bishop's face, whenever his\nfriend entered his room.\n\nA tear came into his eyes as he reflected that all this was gone.\nWhat use would the hospital be to him now? He was alone in the\nworld, and getting old; he would soon, very soon, have to go, and\nleave it all, as his dear old friend had gone;--go, and leave the\nhospital, and his accustomed place in the cathedral, and his haunts\nand pleasures, to younger and perhaps wiser men, in truth, the time for it\nhad gone by. He felt as though the world were sinking from his\nfeet; as though this, this was the time for him to turn with\nconfidence to others. 'What,' said he to himself, 'can a man's\nreligion be worth, if it does not support him against the natural\nmelancholy of declining years?' and, as he looked out through his\ndimmed eyes into the bright parterres of the bishop's garden, he\nfelt that he had the support which he wanted.\n\nNevertheless, he did not like to be thus kept waiting. If Mr Slope\ndid not really wish to see him at half-past nine o'clock, why force\nhim to come away from his lodgings with his breakfast in his\nthroat? To tell the truth, it was policy on the part of Mr Slope.\nMr Slope had made up his mind that Mr Harding should either accept\nthe hospital with abject submission, or else refuse it altogether;\nand had calculated that he would probably be more quick to do the\nlatter, if he could be got to enter upon the subject in all\nill-humour. Perhaps Mr Slope was not altogether wrong in his\ncalculation.\n\nIt was nearly ten when Mr Slope hurried into the room, and,\nmuttering something about the bishop and diocesan duties, shook Mr\nHarding's hand ruthlessly, and begged him to be seated.\n\nNow the airy superiority which this man assumed, did go against the\ngrain of Mr Harding; and yet he did not know how to resent it. The\nwhole tendency of his mind and disposition was opposed to any\ncontra-assumption of grandeur on his own part, and he hadn't the\nworldly spirit or quickness necessary to put down insolent\npretensions by downright and open rebuke, as the archdeacon would\nhave done. There was nothing for Mr Harding but to submit and he\naccordingly did so.\n\n'About the hospital, Mr Harding,' began Mr Slope, speaking of it as\nthe head of college at Cambridge might speak of some sizarship\nwhich had to be disposed of.\n\nMr Harding crossed one leg over the other, and then one hand over\nthe other on the top of them, and looked Mr Slope in the face; but\nhe said nothing.\n\n'It's to be filled up again,' said Mr Slope. Mr Harding said that\nhe had understood so.\n\n'Of course, you know, the income is very much reduced,' continued\nMr Slope. 'The bishop wished to be liberal, and he therefore told\nthe government that he thought it ought to be put at not less than\nL 450. I think on the whole the bishop was right; for though the\nservice required will not be of a very onerous nature, they will be\nmore so than they were before. And it is, perhaps, well that the\nclergy immediately attached to the cathedral town should be made\ncomfortable to the extent of the ecclesiastical means at our\ndisposal will allow. Those are the bishop's ideas, and I must say\nmine also.'\n\nMr Harding sat rubbing one hand on the other, but said not a word.\n\n'So much for the income, Mr Harding. The house will, of course,\nremain to the warden as before. It should, however, I think be\nstipulated that he should paint inside every seven years, and\noutside every three years, and be subject to dilapidations, in the\nevent of vacating either by death or otherwise. But this is a\nmatter on which the bishop must yet be consulted.'\n\nMr Harding still rubbed his hands, and still sat silent, gazing up\ninto Mr Slope's unprepossessing face.\n\n'Then, as to duties,' continued he, 'I believe, if I am rightly\ninformed, there can hardly be said to have been any duties\nhitherto,' and he gave a sort of half laugh, as though to pass off\nthe accusation in the guise of a pleasantry.\n\nMr Harding thought of the happy, easy years he had passed in his\nold house; of the worn-out, aged men whom he had succoured; of his\ngood intentions; and of his work, which had certainly been of the\nlightest. He thought of those things, doubting for a moment whether\nhe did or did not deserve the sarcasm. He gave his enemy the\nbenefit of the doubt, and did not rebuke him. He merely observed,\nvery tranquilly, and perhaps with too much humility, that the\nduties of the situation, such as they were, had, he believed, been\ndone to the satisfaction of the late bishop.\n\nMr Slope again smiled, and this time the smile was intended to\noperate against the memory of the late bishop, rather than against\nthe energy of the ex-warden; and so it was understood by Mr\nHarding. The colour rose in his cheeks, and he began to feel very\nangry.\n\n'You should be aware, Mr Harding, that things are a good deal\nchanged in Barchester,' said Mr Slope.\n\nMr Harding said that he was aware of it. 'And not only in\nBarchester, Mr Harding, but in the world at large. It is not only\nin Barchester that a new man is carrying out new measures and\ncasting away the useless rubbish of past centuries. The same thing\nis going on throughout the country. Work is now required from every\nman who receives wages; and they who have superintended the doing\nof the work, and the paying of the wages, are bound to see that\nthis rule is carried out. New men, Mr Harding, are now needed, and\nare now forthcoming in the church, as well as in other\nprofessions.'\n\nAll this was wormwood to our old friend. He had never rated very\nhigh his own abilities or activity; but all the feelings of his\nheart were with the old clergy, and any antipathies of which his\nheart was susceptible, were directed against those new, busy\nuncharitable, self-lauding men, of whom Mr Slope was so good an\nexample.\n\n'By no means,' said Mr Slope. 'The bishop is very anxious that you\nshould accept the appointment; but he wishes you should understand\nbeforehand what will be the required duties. In the first place, a\nSabbath-day school will be attached to the hospital.'\n\n'What! For the old men?' asked Mr Harding.\n\n'No, Mr Harding, not for the old men, but for the benefit of the\nchildren of such of the poor of Barchester as it may suit. The\nbishop will expect that you shall attend this school, and the\nteachers shall be under your inspection and care.'\n\nMr Harding slipped his topmost hand off the other, and began to rub\nthe calf of the leg which was supported.\n\n'As to the old men,' continued Mr Slope, 'and the old women who are\nto form part of the hospital, the bishop is desirous that you shall\nhave morning and evening service on the premises every Sabbath, and\none week-day service; that you shall preach to them once at least\non Sundays; and that the whole hospital be always collected for\nmorning and evening prayer. The bishop thinks that this will render\nit unnecessary that any separate seats in the cathedral should be\nreserved for the hospital inmates.'\n\nMr Slope paused, but Mr Harding still said nothing.\n\n'Indeed, it would be difficult to find seats for the women; and, on\nthe whole, Mr Harding, I may as well say at once, that for people\nof that class the cathedral service does not appear to me to be the\nmost useful,--even if it be so for any class of people.'\n\n'We will not discuss that, if you please,' said Mr Harding.\n\n'I am not desirous of doing so; at least, not at the present\nmoment. I hope, however, you fully understand the bishop's wishes\nabout the new establishment of the hospital; and if, as I do not\ndoubt, I shall receive from you an assurance that you will accord\nwith his lordship's views, it will give me very great pleasure to\nbe the bearer from his lordship to you of the presentation of the\nappointment.'\n\n'But if I disagree with his lordship's views?' asked Mr Harding.\n\n'But I hope you do not,' said Mr Slope.\n\n'But if I do?' again asked the other.\n\n'If such unfortunately should be the case, which I can hardly\nconceive, I presume your own feelings will dictate to you the\npropriety of declining the appointment.'\n\n'But if I accept the appointment, and yet disagree with the bishop,\nwhat then?'\n\nThis question rather bothered Mr Slope. It was true that he had\ntalked the matter over with the bishop, and had received a sort of\nauthority for suggesting to Mr Harding the propriety of a Sunday\nschool, and certain hospital services; but he had no authority for\nsaying that those propositions were to be made peremptory\nconditions attached to the appointment. The bishop's idea had been\nthat Mr Harding would of course consent, and that the school would\nbecome, like the rest of those new establishments in the city,\nunder the control of his wife and his chaplain. Mr Slope's idea had\nbeen more correct. He intended that Mr Harding should refuse the\nsituation, and that an ally of his own should get it; but he had\nnot conceived the possibility of Mr Harding openly accepting the\nappointment, and as openly rejecting the condition.\n\n'It is not, I presume, probable,' said he, 'that you will accept\nfrom the hands of the bishop a piece of preferment, with a fixed\npredetermination to disacknowledge the duties attached to it.'\n\n'If I become warden,' said Mr Harding, 'and neglect my duty, the\nbishop has means by which he can remedy the grievance.'\n\n'I hardly expected such an argument from you, or I may say the\nsuggestion of such a line of conduct,' said Mr Slope, with a great\nlook of injured virtue.\n\n'Nor did I expect such a proposition.'\n\n'I shall be glad at any rate to know what answer I am to make to\nhis lordship,' said Mr Slope.\n\n'I will take an early opportunity of seeing his lordship myself,'\nsaid Mr Harding.\n\n'Such an arrangement,' said Mr Slope, 'will hardly give his\nlordship satisfaction. Indeed, it is impossible that the bishop\nshould himself see every clergyman in the diocese on every subject\nof patronage that may arise. The bishop, I believe, did see you on\nthe matter, and I really cannot see why he should be troubled to do\nso again.'\n\n'Do you know, Mr Slope, how long I have been officiating as a\nclergyman in this city?' Mr Slope's wish was now nearly fulfilled.\nMr Harding had become very angry, and it was probable that he might\ncommit himself.\n\n'I really do not see what that has to do with the question. You\ncannot think that the bishop would be justified in allowing you to\nregard as a sinecure a situation that requires an active man,\nmerely because you have been employed for many years in the\ncathedral.'\n\n'But it might induce the bishop to see me, if I asked him to do so.\nI shall consult my friends in this matter, Mr Slope; but I mean to\nbe guilty of no subterfuge,--you may tell the bishop that as I\naltogether disagree with his views about the hospital, I shall\ndecline the situation if I find that any such conditions are\nattached to it as those you have suggested;' and so saying, Mr\nHarding took his hat and went his way.\n\nMr Slope was contented. He considered himself at liberty to accept\nMr Harding's last speech as an absolute refusal of the appointment.\nAt least, he so represented it to the bishop and to Mrs Proudie.\n\n'That is very surprising,' said the bishop.\n\n'Not at all,' said Mrs Proudie; 'you little know how determined the\nwhole set of them are to withstand your authority.'\n\n'But Mr Harding was so anxious for it,' said the bishop.\n\n'Yes,' said Mr Slope, 'if he can hold it without the slightest\nacknowledgement of your lordship's jurisdiction.'\n\n'That is out of the question,' said the bishop.\n\n'I should imagine it to be quite so,'said the chaplain.\n\n'Indeed, I should think so,' said the lady.\n\n'I really am sorry for it,' said the bishop.\n\n'I don't know that there is much cause for sorrow,' said the lady.\n'Mr Quiverful is a much more deserving man, more in need of it, and\none who will make himself much more useful in the close\nneighbourhood of the palace.'\n\n'I suppose I had better see Quiverful?' said the chaplain.\n\n'I suppose you had,' said the bishop.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nTHE RUBBISH CART\n\nMr Harding was not a happy man as he walked down the palace\npathway, and stepped out into the close. His preferment and\npleasant house were a second time gone from him; but that he could\nendure. He had been schooled and insulted by a man young enough to\nbe his son; but that he could put up with. He could even draw from\nthe very injuries, which had been inflicted on him, some of that\nconsolation, which we may believe martyrs always receive from the\ninjuries of their own sufferings, and which is generally\nproportioned in it strength to the extent of cruelty with which\nmartyrs are treated. He had admitted to his daughter that he wanted\nthe comfort of his old home, and yet he could have returned to his\nlodgings in the High Street, if not with exultation, at least with\nsatisfaction, had that been all. But the venom of the chaplain's\nharangue had worked into his blood, and had sapped the life of his\nsweet contentment.\n\n'New men are carrying out new measures, and are eating away the\nuseless rubbish of past centuries.' What cruel words these had\nbeen; and how often are they now used with all the heartless\ncruelty of a Slope! A man is sufficiently condemned if it can only\nbe shown that either in politics or religion he does not belong to\nsome new school established within the last score of years. He may\nthen regard himself as rubbish and expect to be carted away. A man\nis nothing now unless he has within him a full appreciation of the\nnew era; an ear in which it would seem that neither honesty nor\ntruth is very desirable, but in which success is the only\ntouchstone of merit. We must laugh at every thing that is\nestablished. Let the joke be ever so bad, ever so untrue to the\nreal principles of joking; nevertheless we must laugh--or else\nbeware the cart. We must talk, think, and live up to the spirit of\nthe times, and write up to it too, if that cacoethes be upon us, or\nelse we are nought. New men and now measures, long credit and few\nscruples, great success and wonderful ruin, such are now the tastes\nof Englishmen who know how to live. Alas, alas! under the\ncircumstances Mr Harding could not but feel that he was an\nEnglishman who did not know how to live. This new doctrine of Mr\nSlope and the rubbish cart, new at least at Barchester, sadly\ndisturbed his equanimity.\n\n'The same thing is going on throughout the whole country!' 'Work is\nnow required from every man who receives wages!' and had he been\nliving all his life receiving wages and doing no work? Had he in\ntruth so lived as to be now in his old age justly reckoned as\nrubbish fit only to be hidden away in some huge dust hole? The\nschool of men to whom he professes to belong, the Grantlys, the\nGwynnes, and the old high set of Oxford divines, are afflicted with\nno such self-accusations as these which troubled Mr Harding. They,\nas a rule, are as satisfied with the wisdom and propriety of their\nown conduct as can be any Mr Slope, or any Dr Proudie, with his\nown. But unfortunately for himself, Mr Harding had little of this\nself-reliance. When he heard himself designated as rubbish by the\nSlopes of the world, he had no other recourse than to make inquiry\nwithin his own bosom as to the truth of the designation. Alas,\nalas! the evidence seemed generally to go against him.\n\nHe had professed to himself in the bishop's parlour that in these\ncoming sources of the sorrow of the age, in these fits of sad\nregret from which the latter years of few reflecting men can be\nfree, religion would suffice to comfort him. Yes, religion could\nconsole him for the loss of any worldly good; but was his religion\nof that active sort which would enable him so to repent of misspent\nyears as to pass those that were left to him in a spirit of hope\nfor the future? And such repentance itself, is it not a work of\nagony and of tears? It is very easy to talk of repentance; but a\nman has to walk over hot ploughshares before he can complete it; to\nbe skinned alive as was St Bartholomew; to be stuck full of arrows\nas was St Sebastian; to lie broiling on a gridiron like St Lorenzo!\nHow if his past life required such repentance as this? had he the\nenergy to go through with it?\n\nMr Harding after leaving the palace, walked slowly for an hour or\nso beneath the shady elms of the close, and then betook himself to\nhis daughter's house. He had at any rate made up his mind that he\nwould go out to Plumstead to consult Dr Grantly, and that he would\nin the first instance tell Eleanor what had occurred.\n\nAnd now he was doomed to undergo another misery. Mr Slope had\nforestalled him at the widow's house. He had called there on the\npreceding afternoon. He could not, he had said, deny himself the\npleasure of telling Mrs Bold that her father was about to return to\nthe pretty house at Hiram's hospital. He had been instructed by the\nbishop to inform Mr Harding that the appointment would now be made\nat once. The bishop was of course only too happy to be able to be\nthe means of restoring to Mr Harding the preferment which he had so\nlong adorned. And then by degrees Mr Slope had introduced the\nsubject of the pretty school which he had hoped before long to see\nattached to the hospital. He had quite fascinated Mrs Bold by his\ndescription of this picturesque, useful, and charitable appendage,\nand she had gone so far as to say that she had no doubt her father\nwould approve, and that she herself would gladly undertake a class.\n\nAnyone who had heard the entirely different tone, and seen the\nentirely different manner in which Mr Slope had spoken of this\nprojected institution to the daughter and to the father, would not\nhave failed to own that Mr Slope was a man of genius. He said\nnothing to Mrs Bold about the hospital sermons and services,\nnothing about the exclusion of the old men from the cathedral,\nnothing about dilapidation and painting, nothing about carting away\nthe rubbish. Eleanor had said to herself that certainly she did not\nlike Mr Slope personally, but that he was a very active, zealous,\nclergyman, and would no doubt be useful in Barchester. All this\npaved the way for much additional misery to Mr Harding.\n\nEleanor put on her happiest face as she heard her father on the\nstairs, for she thought she had only to congratulate him; but\ndirectly she saw his face, she knew that there was but little\nmatter for congratulation. She had seen him with the same weary\nlook of sorrow on one or two occasions before, and remembered it\nwell. She had seen him when he first read that attack upon himself\nin the Jupiter, which had ultimately caused him to resign the\nhospital; and she had seen him also when the archdeacon had\npersuaded him to remain there against his own sense of propriety\nand honour. She knew at a glance that his spirit was in deep\ntrouble.\n\n'Oh, papa, what is it?' said she, putting down her boy to crawl\nupon the floor.\n\n'I came to tell you, my dear,' said he, 'that I am going out to\nPlumstead: you won't come with me, I suppose?'\n\n'To Plumstead, papa? Shall you stay there?'\n\n'I suppose I shall tonight: I must consult the archdeacon about\nthis weary hospital. Ah me! I wish I had never thought of it\nagain.'\n\n'Why, papa, what is the matter?'\n\n'I've been with Mr Slope, my dear; and he isn't the pleasantest\ncompanion in the world, at least not to me.' Eleanor gave a sort of\nhalf blush; but she was wrong if she imagined that her father in\nany way alluded to her acquaintance with Mr Slope.\n\n'Well, papa.'\n\n'He wants to turn the hospital into a Sunday school and a preaching\nhouse; and I suppose he will have his way. I do not feel myself\nadapted for such an establishment, and therefore, I suppose, I must\nrefuse the appointment.'\n\n'What would be the harm of the school, papa?'\n\n'The want of a proper schoolmaster, my dear.'\n\n'But that would of course be supplied.'\n\n'Mr Slope wishes to supply it by making me his schoolmaster. But as\nI am hardly fit for such work, I intend to decline.'\n\n'Oh, papa! Mr Slope doesn't intend that. He was here yesterday, and\nwhat he intends--'\n\n'He was here yesterday, was he?' asked Mr Harding.\n\n'Yes, papa.'\n\n'And talking about the hospital?'\n\n'He was saying how glad he would be, and the bishop too, to see you\nback there again. And then he spoke about the Sunday school; and to\ntell the truth I agreed with him; and I thought you would have done\nso too. Mr Slope spoke of a school, not inside the hospital, but\njust connected with it, of which you would be the patron and\nvisitor; and I thought you would have liked such a school as that;\nand I promised to look after it and to take a class--and it all\nseemed so very--. But, oh, papa! I shall be so miserable if I find\nthat I have done wrong.'\n\n'Nothing wrong at all, my dear,' said he, gently, very gently\nrejecting his daughter's caresses. 'There can be nothing wrong in\nyour wishing to make yourself useful; indeed, you ought to do so by\nall means. Every one must now exert himself who would not choose to\ngo to the wall.' Poor Mr Harding thus attempted in his misery to\npreach the new doctrine to his child. 'Himself or herself, it's all\nthe same,' he continued, 'you will be quite right, my dear, to do\nsomething of this sort; but--'\n\n'Well, papa.'\n\n'I am not quite sure that if I were you I would select Mr Slope for\nmy guide.'\n\n'But I have never done so, and never shall.'\n\n'It would be very wicked of me to speak evil of him, for to tell\nthe truth I know no evil of him; but I am not quite sure that he is\nhonest. That he is not gentleman-like in his manners, of that I am\nquite sure.'\n\n'I never thought of taking him for my guide, papa.'\n\n'As for myself, my dear,' continued he, 'we know the old\nproverb--\"It's a bad thing teaching an old dog new tricks.\" I must\ndecline the Sunday school, and shall therefore probably decline the\nhospital also. But I will first see your brother-in-law.' So he\ntook up his hat, kissed the baby, and withdrew, leaving Eleanor in\nas low spirits as himself.\n\nAll this was a great aggravation to his misery. He had so few with\nwhom to sympathise, that he could not afford to be cut off from the\none whose sympathy was of the most value to him. And yet it seemed\nprobable that this would be the case. He did not own to himself\nthat he wished his daughter to hate Mr Slope; yet had she expressed\nsuch a feeling there would have been very little bitterness in the\nrebuke he would have given her for so uncharitable a state of mind.\nThe fact, however, was that she was on friendly terms with Mr\nSlope, that she coincided with his views, adhered at once to his\nplans, and listened with delight to his teaching. Mr Harding hardly\nwished his daughter to hate the man, but he would have preferred\nthat to her loving him.\n\nHe walked away to the inn to order a fly, went home to put up his\ncarpet bag, and then started for Plumstead. There was, at any rate,\nno danger that the archdeacon would fraternise with Mr Slope; but\nthen he would recommend internecine war, public appeals, loud\nreproaches, and all the paraphernalia of open battle. Now that\nalternative was hardly more to Mr Harding's taste than the other.\n\nWhen Mr Harding reached the parsonage he found that the archdeacon\nwas out, and would not be home till dinner-time, so he began his\ncomplaint to his elder daughter. Mrs Grantly entertained quite as\nstrong an antagonism to Mr Slope as did her husband; she was also\nquite as alive to the necessity of combatting the Proudie faction,\nof supporting the old church interest of the close, of keeping in\nher own set much of the loaves and fishes as duly belonged to it;\nand was quite as well prepared as her lord to carry on the battle\nwithout giving or taking quarter. Not that she was a woman prone to\nquarrelling, or ill inclined to live at peace with her clerical\nneighbours; but she felt, as did the archdeacon, that the presence\nof Mr Slope in Barchester was an insult to every one connected with\nthe late bishop, and that his assumed dominion in the diocese was a\nspiritual injury to her husband. Hitherto people had little guessed\nhow bitter Mrs Grantly could be. She lived on the best of terms\nwith all the rectors' wives around her. She had been popular with\nall the ladies connected with the close. Though much the wealthiest\nof the ecclesiastical matrons of the county, she had so managed her\naffairs that her carriage and horses had given umbrage to none. She\nhad never thrown herself among the county grandees so as to excite\nthe envy of other clergymen's wives. She had never talked too\nloudly of earls and countesses, or boasted that she gave her\ngoverness sixty pounds a year, or her cook seventy. Mrs Grantly had\nlived the life of a wise, discreet, peace-making woman; and the\npeople of Barchester were surprised at the amount of military\nvigour she displayed as general of the feminine Grantlyite forces.\n\nMrs Grantly soon learnt that her sister Eleanor had promised to\nassist Mr Slope in the affairs of the hospital; and it was on this\npoint that her attention soon fixed itself.\n\n'How can Eleanor endure him?' said she.\n\n'He is a very crafty man,' said her father, 'and his craft has been\nsuccessful in making Eleanor think that he is a meek, charitable,\ngood clergyman. God forgive me, if I wrong him, but such is not his\ntrue character in my opinion.'\n\n'His true character, indeed!' said she, with something approaching\nscorn for her father's moderation. 'I only hope he won't have craft\nenough to make Eleanor forget herself and her position.'\n\n'Do you mean marry him?' said he, startled out of his usual\ndemeanour by the abruptness and horror of so dreadful a\nproposition.\n\n'What is there so improbable in it? Of course that would be his own\nobject if he thought he had any chance of success. Eleanor has a\nthousand a year entirely at her own disposal, and what better\nfortune could fall to Mr Slope's lot than the transferring of the\ndisposal of such a fortune to himself?'\n\n'But you can't think she likes him, Susan?'\n\n'Why not?' said Susan. 'Why shouldn't she like him? He's just the\nsort of man to get on with a woman left as she is, with no one to\nlook after her.'\n\n'Look after her!' said the unhappy father; 'don't we look after\nher?'\n\n'Ah, papa, how innocent you are! Of course it was to be expected\nthat Eleanor should marry again. I should be the last to advise her\nagainst it, if she would only wait the proper time, and then marry\nat least a gentleman.'\n\n'But you don't really mean to say that you suppose Eleanor has ever\nthought of marrying Mr Slope? Why, Mr Bold has only been dead a\nyear.'\n\n'Eighteen months,' said his daughter. 'But I don't suppose Eleanor\nhas ever thought about it. It is very probable, though, that he\nhas, and that he will try and make her do so; and that he will\nsucceed too, if we don't take care what we are about.'\n\nThis was quite a new phase of the affair to poor Mr Harding. To\nhave thrust upon him as his son-in-law, as the husband of his\nfavourite child, the only man in the world whom he really\npositively disliked, would be a misfortune which he felt he would\nnot know how to endure patiently. But then, could there be any\nground for so dreadful a surmise? In all worldly matters he was apt\nto look upon the opinion of his eldest daughter, as one generally\nsound and trustworthy. In her appreciation of character, of\nmotives, and the probable conduct both of men and women, she was\nusually not far wrong. She had early foreseen the marriage of\nEleanor and John Bold; she had at a glance deciphered the character\nof the new bishop and his chaplain; could it possibly be that her\npresent surmise should ever come forth as true?'\n\n'But you don't think that she likes him,' said Mr Harding again.\n\n'Well, papa, I can't say that I think she dislikes him as she ought\nto do. Why is he visiting there as a confidential friend, when he\nnever ought to have been admitted inside the house? Why is it that\nshe speaks to him of about your welfare and your position, as she\nclearly has done? At the bishop's party the other night, I saw her\ntalking to him for half an hour at the stretch.'\n\n'I thought Mr Slope seemed to talk to nobody there but that\ndaughter of Stanhope's,' said Mr Harding, wishing to defend his\nchild.\n\n'Oh, Mr Slope is a cleverer man than you think of, papa, and keeps\nmore than one iron in the fire.'\n\nTo give Eleanor her due, any suspicion as to the slightest\ninclination on her part towards Mr Slope was a wrong to her. She\nhad no more idea of marrying Mr Slope than she had of marrying the\nbishop; and the idea that Mr Slope would present himself as a\nsuitor had never occurred to her. Indeed, to give her her due\nagain, she had never thought about suitors since her husband's\ndeath. But nevertheless it was true that she had overcome all that\nrepugnance to the man which was so strongly felt for him by the\nrest of the Grantly faction. She had forgiven him his sermon. She\nhad forgiven him his low church tendencies, his Sabbath schools,\nand puritanical observances. She had forgiven his pharisaical\narrogance, and even his greasy face and oily vulgar manners. Having\nagreed to overlook such offences as these, why should she not in\ntime be taught to regard Mr Slope as a suitor?\n\nAnd as to him, it must be affirmed that he was hitherto equally\ninnocent of the crime imputed to him. How it had come to pass that\na man whose eyes were generally widely open to everything had not\nperceived that this young widow was rich as well as beautiful,\ncannot probably now be explained. But such was the fact. Mr Slope\nhad ingratiated himself with Mrs Bold, merely as he had done with\nother ladies, in order to strengthen his party in the city. He\nsubsequently attended his error; but it was not till after the\ninterview with him and Mr Harding.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nTHE NEW CAMPAIGN\n\nThe archdeacon did not return to the parsonage till close upon the\nhour of dinner, and there was therefore no time to discuss matters\nbefore that important ceremony. He seemed to be in an especial good\nhumour, and welcomed his father-in-law with a sort of jovial\nearnestness that was usual with him when things on which was intent\nwere going on as he would have them.\n\n'It's all settled, my dear,' said he to his wife as he washed his\nhands in his dressing-room, while she, according to her wont, sat\nlistening in the bedroom; 'Arabin has agreed to accept the living.\nHe'll be here next week.' And the archdeacon scrubbed his hands and\nrubbed his face with a violent alacrity, which showed that Arabin's\ncoming was a great point gained.\n\n'Will he come here to Plumstead?' said the wife.\n\n'He has promised to stay a month with us,' said the archdeacon, 'so\nthat he may see what his parish is like. You'll like Arabin very\nmuch. He's a gentleman in every respect, and full of good humour.'\n\n'He's very queer, isn't he?' asked the wife.\n\n'Well--he is a little odd in some of his fancies; but there's\nnothing about him you won't like. He is as staunch a churchman as\nthere is at Oxford. I really don't know what we should do without\nArabin. It's a great thing for me to have him so near me; and if\nanything can put Slope down, Arabin will do it.'\n\nThe Reverend Francis Arabin was a fellow of Lazarus, the favoured\ndisciple of the great Dr Gwynne, a high churchman at all points; so\nhigh, indeed, that at one period of his career he had all but\ntoppled over into the cesspool of Rome; a poet and also a polemical\nwriter, a great pet in the common rooms at Oxford, an eloquent\nclergyman, a droll, odd, humorous, energetic, conscientious man,\nand, as the archdeacon had boasted of him, a thorough gentleman. As\nhe will hereafter be brought more closely to our notice, it is now\nonly necessary to add, that he had just been presented to the\nvicarage of St Ewold by Dr Grantly, in whose gift as archdeacon the\nliving lay. St Ewold's is a parish lying just without the city of\nBarchester. The suburbs of the new town, indeed, are partly within\nits precincts, and the pretty church and parsonage are not much\nabove a mile distant from the city gate.\n\nSt Ewold is not a rich piece of preferment--it is worth some three\nor four hundred a year, at most, and has generally been held by a\nclergyman attached to the cathedral choir. The archdeacon, however,\nfelt, when the living on this occasion became vacant, that it\nimperatively behoved him to aid the force of his party with some\ntower of strength, if any such tower could be got to occupy St\nEwold's. He had discussed the matter with his brethren in\nBarchester; not in any weak spirit as the holder of patronage to be\nused for his own or his family's benefit, but as one to whom was\ncommitted a trust, on the due administration of which much of the\nchurch's welfare might depend. He had submitted to them the name of\nMr Arabin, as though the choice had rested with them all in\nconclave, and they had unanimously admitted that, if Mr Arabin\nwould accept St Ewold's no better choice could possibly be made.\n\nIf Mr Arabin would accept St Ewold's! There lay the difficulty. Mr\nArabin was a man standing somewhat prominently before the world,\nthat is, before the Church of England world. He was not a rich man,\nit is true, for he held no preferment but his fellowship; but he\nwas a man not over anxious for riches, not married of course, and\none whose time was greatly taken up in discussing, both in print\nand on platforms, the privileges and practices of the church to\nwhich he belonged. As the archdeacon had done battle for its\ntemporalities, so did Mr Arabin do battle for its spiritualities;\nand both had done so conscientiously; that is, not so much each for\nhis own benefit as for that of others.\n\nHolding such a position as Mr Arabin did, there was much reason to\ndoubt whether he would consent to become the parson of St Ewold's,\nand Dr Grantly had taken the trouble to go himself to Oxford on the\nmatter. Dr Gwynne and Dr Grantly together had succeeded in\npersuading this eminent divine that duty required him to go\nBarchester. There were wheels within wheels in this affair. For\nsome time past Mr Arabin had been engaged in a tremendous\ncontroversy with no less a person than Mr Slope, respecting the\napostolic succession. These two gentlemen had never seen each\nother, but they had been extremely bitter in print. Mr Slope had\nendeavoured to strengthen his cause by calling Mr Arabin an owl,\nand Mr Arabin had retaliated by hinting that Mr Slope was an\ninfidel. This battle had been commenced in the columns of the daily\nJupiter, a powerful newspaper, the manager of which was very\nfriendly to Mr Slope's view of the case. The matter, however, had\nbecome too tedious for the readers of the Jupiter, and a little\nnote had therefore been appended to one of Mr Slope's most telling\nrejoinders, in which it had been stated that no further letters\nfrom the reverend gentlemen could be inserted except as\nadvertisements.\n\nOther methods of publication were, however, found less expensive\nthan advertisements in the Jupiter; and the war went on merrily. Mr\nSlope declared that the main part of the consecration of a\nclergyman was the self-devotion of the inner man to the duties of\nthe ministry. Mr Arabin contended that a man was not consecrated at\nall, had, indeed, no single attribute of a clergyman, unless he\nbecame so through the imposition of some bishop's hands, who had\nbecome a bishop through the imposition of other hands, and so on in\na direct line to one of the apostles. Each had repeatedly hung the\nother on the horns of a dilemma; but neither seemed to a whit the\nworse for the hanging; and so the war went on merrily.\n\nWhether or no the near neighbourhood of the foe may have acted in\nany way as an inducement to Mr Arabin to accept the living of St\nEwold, we will not pretend to say; but it had at any rate been\nsettled in Dr Gwynne's library, at Lazarus, that he would accept\nit, and that he would lend his assistance towards driving the enemy\nout of Barchester, or, at any rate, silencing him while he remained\nthere. Mr Arabin intended to keep his rooms at Oxford, and to have\nthe assistance of a curate at St Ewold; but he promised to give as\nmuch time as possible to the neighbourhood of Barchester, and from\nso great a man Dr Grantly was quite satisfied with such a promise.\nIt was no small part of the satisfaction derivable from such an\narrangement that Dr Proudie would be forced to institute into a\nliving, immediately under his own nose, the enemy of his favourite\nchaplain.\n\nAll through the dinner the archdeacon's good humour shone brightly\nin his face. He ate of the good things heartily, he drank wine with\nhis wife and daughter, he talked pleasantly of his doings at\nOxford, told his father-in-law that he ought to visit Dr Gwynne at\nLazarus, and launched out again in praise of Dr Arabin.\n\n'Is Mr Arabin married, papa?' asked Griselda.\n\n'No, my dear; the fellow of a college is never married.'\n\n'Is he a young man, papa?'\n\n'About forty, I believe,' said the archdeacon.\n\n'Oh!' said Griselda. Had her father said eighty, Mr Arabin would\nnot have appeared to her to be very much older.\n\nWhen the two gentlemen were left alone over their wine, Mr Harding\ntold his tale of woe. But even this, sad as it was, did not much\ndiminish the archdeacon's good humour, though it greatly added to\nhis pugnacity.\n\n'He can't do it,' said Dr Grantly over and over again, as his\nfather-in-law explained to him the terms on which the new warden of\nthe hospital was to be appointed; 'he can't do it. What he says is\nnot worth the trouble of listening to. He can't alter the duties of\nthe place.'\n\n'Who can't?' asked the ex-warden.\n\n'Neither can the bishop nor the chaplain, nor yet the bishop's\nwife, who, I take it, has really more to say to such matters than\neither of the other two. The whole body corporate of the palace\ntogether have no power to turn the warden of the hospital into a\nSunday schoolmaster.'\n\n'But the bishop has the power to appoint whom he pleases, and--'\n\n'I don't know that; I rather think he'll find he has no such power.\nLet him try it, and see what the press will say. For once we shall\nhave the popular cry on our side. But Proudie, ass as he is, knows\nthe world too well to get such a hornet's nest about his ears.'\n\nMr Harding winced at the idea of the press. He had had enough of\nthat sort of publicity, and was unwilling to be shown up a second\ntime either as a monster or as a martyr. He gently remarked that he\nhoped the newspapers would not get hold of his name again, and then\nsuggested that perhaps it would be better that he should abandon\nhis object. 'I am getting old,' said he; 'and after all I doubt\nwhether I am fit to undertake new duties.'\n\n'New duties!' said the archdeacon: 'don't I tell you there shall be\nno new duties?'\n\n'Or, perhaps, old duties either,' said Mr Harding; 'I think I will\nremain content as I am.' The picture of Mr Slope carting away the\nrubbish was still present to his mind.\n\nThe archdeacon drank off his glass of claret, and prepared himself\nto be energetic. 'I do hope,' said he, 'that you are not going to\nbe so weak as to allow such a man as Mr Slope to deter you from\ndoing what you know is your duty to do. You know that it is your\nduty to resume your place at the hospital now that parliament has\nso settled the stipend as to remove those difficulties which\ninduced you to resign it. You cannot deny this; and should your\ntimidity now prevent you from doing so, your conscience will\nhereafter never forgive you;' and as he finished this clause of his\nspeech, he pushed over the bottle to his companion.\n\n'Your conscience will never forgive you,' he continued. 'You\nresigned the place from conscientious scruples, scruples which I\ngreatly respected, though I did not share them. All your friends\nrespected them, and you left your old house as rich in reputation\nas you were ruined in fortune. It is now expected that you will\nreturn. Dr Gwynne was saying only the other day--'\n\n'Dr Gwynne does not reflect how much older a man I am now than when\nhe last saw me.'\n\n'Old--nonsense!' said the archdeacon; 'you never thought yourself\nold till you listened to the impudent trash of that coxcomb at the\npalace.'\n\n'I shall be sixty-five if I live till November,' said Mr Harding.\n\n'And seventy-five if you live till November ten years,' said the\narchdeacon. 'And you bid fair to be as efficient then as you were\nten years ago. But for heaven's sake let us have no pretence in\nthis matter. Your plea of old age is only a pretence. But you're\nnot drinking your wine. It is only a pretence. The fact is, you are\nhalf afraid of this Slope, and would rather subject yourself to\ncomparative poverty and discomfort, than come to blows with a man\nwho will trample on you, if you let him.'\n\n'I certainly don't like coming to blows, if I can help it.'\n\n'Nor I neither--but sometimes we can't help it. This man's object\nis to induce you to refuse the hospital, that he may put some\ncreature of his own into it; that he may show his power, and insult\nus all by insulting you, whose cause and character are so\nintimately bound up with that of the chapter. You owe it to us all\nto resist him in this, even if you have no solicitude for yourself.\nBut surely, for your own sake, you will not be so lily-livered as\nto fall into this trap which he has baited for you, and let him\ntake the very bread out of your mouth without a struggle.'\n\nMr Harding did not like being called lily-livered, and was rather\ninclined to resent it. 'I doubt there is any true courage,' said\nhe, 'in squabbling for money.'\n\n'If honest men did not squabble for money, in this world of ours,\nthe dishonest men would get it all; and I do not see that the cause\nof virtue would be much improved. No,--we must use the means which\nwe have. If we were to carry your argument home, we might give away\nevery shilling of revenue which the church has; and I presume you\nare not prepared to say that the church would be strengthened by\nsuch a sacrifice.' The archdeacon filled his glass and then emptied\nit, drinking with much reverence a silent toast to the well-being\nand permanent security of those temporalities which were so dear to\nhis soul.\n\n'I think all quarrels between a clergyman and his bishop should be\navoided,' said Mr Harding.\n\n'I think so too; but it is quite as much the duty of the bishop to\nlook to that as of his inferior. I tell you what, my friend; I'll\nsee the bishop in this matter, that is, if you will allow me; and\nyou may be sure I will not compromise you. My opinion is, that all\nthis trash about Sunday-schools and the sermons has originated\nwholly with Slope and Mrs Proudie, and that the bishop knows\nnothing about it. The bishop can't very well refuse to see me, and\nI'll come upon him when he has neither his wife nor his chaplain by\nhim. I think you'll find that it will end in his sending you the\nappointment without any condition whatever. And as to the seats in\nthe cathedral, we may safely leave that to Mr Dean. I believe the\nfool positively thinks that the bishop could walk away with the\ncathedral, if he pleased.'\n\nAnd so the matter was arranged between them. Mr Harding had come\nexpressly for advice, and therefore felt himself bound to take the\nadvice given him. He had known, moreover, beforehand, that the\narchdeacon would not hear of his giving the matter up, and\naccordingly though he had in perfect good faith put forward his own\nviews, he was prepared to yield.\n\nThey therefore went into the drawing-room in good humour with each\nother, and the evening passed pleasantly in prophetic discussion on\nthe future wars of Arabin and Slope. The frogs had the mice would\nbe nothing to them, nor the angers of Agamemnon and Achilles. How\nthe archdeacon rubbed his hands, and plumed himself on the success\nof his last move. He could not himself descend into the arena with\nSlope, but Arabin would have no such scruples. Arabin was exactly\nthe man for such work, and the only man whom he knew that was fit\nfor it.\n\nThe archdeacon's good humour and high buoyancy continued till, when\nreclining on his pillow, Mrs Grantly commenced to give him her view\nof the state of affairs in Barchester. And then certainly he was\nstartled. The last words he said that night were as follows:--\n\n'If she does, by heaven, I'll never speak to her again. She dragged\nme into the mire once, but I'll not pollute myself with such filth\nas that--' And the archdeacon gave a shudder which shook the whole\nroom, so violently was he convulsed with the thought which then\nagitated his mind.\n\nNow in this matter, the widow Bold was scandalously ill-treated by\nher relatives. She had spoken to the man three or four times, and\nhad expressed her willingness to teach in a Sunday-school. Such was\nthe full extent of her sins in the matter of Mr Slope. Poor\nEleanor! But time will show.\n\nThe next morning Mr Harding returned to Barchester, no further word\nhaving been spoken in his hearing respecting Mr Slope's\nacquaintance with his younger daughter. But he observed that the\narchdeacon at breakfast was less cordial than he had been on the\npreceding evening.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nTHE WIDOW'S SUITORS\n\nMr Slope lost no time in availing himself of the bishop's\npermission to see Mr Quiverful, and it was in his interview with\nthis worthy pastor that he first learned that Mrs Bold was worth\nthe wooing. He rode out to Puddingdale to communicate to the embryo\nwarden the good will of the bishop in his favour, and during the\ndiscussion on the matter, it was unnatural that the pecuniary\nresources of Mr Harding and his family should become the subject of\nremark.\n\nMr Quiverful, with his fourteen children and his four hundred a\nyear, was a very poor man, and the prospect of this new preferment,\nwhich was to be held together with his living, was very grateful to\nhim. To what clergyman so circumstanced would not such a prospect\nbe very grateful? But Mr Quiverful had long been acquainted with Mr\nHarding, and had received kindness at his hands, so that his heart\nmisgave him as he thought of supplanting a friend at the hospital.\nNevertheless, he was extremely civil, cringingly civil, to Mr\nSlope; treated him quite as the great man; entreated this great man\nto do him the honour to drink a glass of sherry, at which, as it\nwas very poor Marsala, the now pampered Slope turned up his nose;\nand ended by declaring his extreme obligation to the bishop and Mr\nSlope, and his great desire to accept the hospital, if--if it were\ncertainly the case that Mr Harding had refused it.\n\nWhat man, as needy as Mr Quiverful, would have been more\ndisinterested?\n\n'Mr Harding did positively refuse it,' said Mr Slope, with a\ncertain air of offended dignity, 'when he heard of the conditions\nto which the appointment is now subjected. Of course, you\nunderstand, Mr Quiverful, that the same conditions will be imposed\non yourself.'\n\nMr Quiverful cared nothing for the conditions. He would have\nundertaken to preach any number of sermons Mr Slope might have\nchosen to dictate, and to pass every remaining hour of his Sundays\nwithin the walls of a Sunday school. What sacrifices, or, at any\nrate, what promises, would have been too much to make for such an\naddition to his income, and for such a house! But his mind still\nrecurred to Mr Harding.\n\n'To be sure,' said he; 'Mr Harding's daughter is very rich, and why\nshould he trouble himself with the hospital?'\n\n'You mean Mrs Grantly,' said Slope.\n\n'I meant the widowed daughter,' said the other. 'Mrs Bold has\ntwelve hundred a year of her own, and I suppose Mr Harding means to\nlive with her.'\n\n'Twelve hundred a year of her own!' said Slope, and very shortly\nafterwards took his leave, avoiding, as far as it was possible for\nhim to do, any further allusion to the hospital. Twelve hundred a\nyear, said he to himself, as he rode slowly home. If it were the\nfact that Mrs Bold had twelve hundred a year of her own, what a\nfool would he be to oppose her father's return to his old place.\nThe train of Mr Slope's ideas will probably be plain to all my\nreaders. Why should he not make the twelve hundred a year his own?\nAnd if he did so, would it not be well for him to have a\nfather-in-law comfortably provided with the good things of this\nworld? Would it not, moreover, be much more easy for him to gain\nhis daughter, if he did all in his power to forward his father's\nviews?\n\nThese questions presented themselves to him in a very forcible way,\nand yet there were many points of doubt. If he resolved to restore\nto Mr Harding his former place, he must take the necessary steps\nfor doing so at once; he must immediately talk over the bishop,\nquarrel on the matter with Mrs Proudie whom he knew he could not\ntalk over, and let Mr Quiverful know that he had been a little too\nprecipitate as to Mr Harding's positive refusal. That he could\neffect all this, he did not doubt; but he did not wish to effect it\nfor nothing. He did not wish to give way to Mr Harding, and then be\nrejected by the daughter. He did not wish to lose one influential\nfriend before he had gained another.\n\nAnd thus he rode home, meditating the many things in his mind. It\noccurred to him that Mrs Bold was sister-in-law to the archdeacon;\nand that not even for twelve hundred a year would he submit to that\nimperious man. A rich wife was a great desideratum to him, but\nsuccess in his profession was still greater; there were, moreover,\nother rich women who might be willing to become wives; and after\nall, this twelve hundred a year might, when inquired into, melt\naway into some small sum utterly beneath his notice. Then also he\nremembered that Mrs Bold had a son.\n\nAnother circumstance also much influenced him, though it was one\nwhich may almost be said to have influenced him against his will.\nThe vision of Signora Neroni was perpetually before his eyes. It\nwould be too much to say that Mr Slope was lost in love, but yet he\nthought, and kept continually thinking, that he had never seen so\nbeautiful a woman. He was a man whose nature was open to such\nimpulses, and the wiles of the Italianised charmer had been\nthoroughly successful in imposing upon his thoughts. We will not\ntalk of his heart: not that he had no heart, but because his heart\nhad little to do with his present feelings. His taste had been\npleased, his eyes charmed, and his vanity gratified. He had been\ndazzled by a sort of loveliness which he had never before seen, and\nhad been caught by an easy, free, voluptuous manner which was\nperfectly new to him. He had never been so tempted before, and the\ntemptation was now irresistible. He had not owned to himself that\nhe cared for this woman more than for others around him; but yet he\nthought often of the time when he might see her next, and made,\nalmost unconsciously, little cunning plans for seeing her\nfrequently.\n\nHe had called at Dr Stanhope's house the day after the bishop's\nparty, and then the warmth of his admiration had been fed with\nfresh fuel. If the signora had been kind in her manner, and\nflattering in her speech when lying upon the bishop's sofa, with\nthe eyes of so many on her, she had been much more so in her\nmother's drawing-room, with no one present but her sister to\nrepress either her nature or her art. Mr Slope had thus left her\nquite bewildered, and could not willingly admit into his brain any\nscheme, a part of which would be the necessity of abandoning all\nfurther special relationship with this lady.\n\nAnd so he slowly rode along very meditative.\n\nAnd here the author must beg it to be remembered that Mr Slope was\nnot in all things a bad man. His motives, like those of most men,\nwere mixed; and though his conduct was generally very different\nfrom that which we would wish to praise, it was actuated perhaps as\noften as that of the majority of the world by a desire to do his\nduty. He believed in the religion which he taught, harsh,\nunpalatable, uncharitable as that religion was. He believed those\nwhom he wished to get under his hoof, the Grantlys and Gwynnes of\nthe church, to be the enemies of that religion. He believed himself\nto be the pillar of strength, destined to do great things; and with\nthat subtle, selfish, ambiguous sophistry to which the minds of all\nmen are so subject, he had taught himself to think that in doing\nmuch for the promotion of his own interests he was doing much also\nfor the promotion of religion. Mr Slope had never been an immoral\nman. Indeed, he had resisted temptations to immorality with a\nstrength of purpose that was creditable to him. He had early in\nlife devoted himself to works which were not compatible with the\nordinary pleasures of youth, and he had abandoned such pleasures\nnot without a struggle. It must therefore be conceived that he did\nnot admit to himself that he warmly admired the beauty of a married\nwoman without heartfelt stings of conscience; and to pacify that\nconscience, he had to teach himself that the nature of his\nadmiration was innocent.\n\nAnd thus he rode along meditative and ill at ease. His conscience\nhad not a word to say against his choosing the widow and her\nfortune. That he looked upon as a godly work rather than otherwise;\nas a deed which, if carried through, would redound to his credit as\na Christian. On that side lay no future remorse, no conduct which\nhe might probably have to forget, no inward stings. If it should\nturn out to be really the fact that Mrs Bold had twelve hundred a\nyear at her own disposal, Mr Slope would rather look upon it as a\nduty which he owed his religion to make himself the master of the\nwife and the money; as a duty, too, in which some amount of\nself-sacrifice would be necessary. He would have to give up his\nfriendship with the signora, his resistance to Mr Harding, his\nantipathy--no, he found on mature self-examination, that he could\nnot bring himself to give up his antipathy to Dr Grantly. He would\nmarry the lady as the enemy of her brother-in-law, if such an\narrangement suited her; if not, she must look elsewhere for a\nhusband.\n\nIt was with such resolve as this that he reached Barchester. He\nwould at once ascertain what the truth might be as to the lady's\nwealth, and having done this, he would be ruled by circumstances in\nhis conduct respecting the hospital. If he found that he could turn\nround and secure the place for Mr Harding without much\nself-sacrifice, he would do so; but if not, he would woo the\ndaughter in opposition to the father. But in no case would he\nsuccumb to the archdeacon.\n\nHe saw his horse taken round to the stable, and immediately went\nforth to commence his inquiries. To give Mr Slope his due, he was\nnot a man who ever let much grass grow under his feet.\n\nPoor Eleanor! She was doomed to be the intended victim of more\nschemes than one.\n\nAbout the time that Mr Slope was visiting the vicar of Puddingdale,\na discussion took place respecting her charms and wealth at Dr\nStanhope's house in the close. There had been morning callers\nthere, and people had told some truth and also some falsehood\nrespecting the property which John Bold had left behind him. By\ndegrees the visitors went, and as the doctor went with them, and as\nthe doctor's wife had not made her appearance, Charlotte Stanhope\nand her brother were left together. He was sitting idly at the\ntable, scrawling caricatures of Barchester notable, then yawning,\nthen turning over a book or two, and evidently at a loss how kill\nsome time without much labour.\n\n'You haven't done much, Bertie, about getting any orders,' said his\nsister.\n\n'Orders!' said he; 'who on earth is there at Barchester to give\nsome orders? Who among the people here could possibly think it\nworth his while to have his head done into marble?'\n\n'Then you mean to give up your profession,' said she.\n\n'No, I don't,' said he, going on with some absurd portrait of the\nbishop. 'Look at that, Lotte; isn't it the little man all over,\napron and all? I'd go on with my profession at once, as you call\nit, if the governor would set me up with a studio in London; but as\nto sculpture at Barchester--I suppose half the people here don't\nknow what a torso means.'\n\n'The governor will not give you a shilling to start you in London,'\nsaid Lotte. 'Indeed, he can't give you what would be sufficient,\nfor he has not got it. But you might start yourself very well, if\nyou pleased.'\n\n'How the deuce am I to do it?' said he.\n\n'To tell you the truth, Bertie, you'll never make a penny by any\nprofession.'\n\n'That's what I often think myself,' said he, not in the least\noffended. 'Some men have a great gift of making money, but they\ncan't spend it. Others can't put two shillings together, but they\nhave a great talent for all sorts of outlay. I begin to think that\nmy genius is wholly in the latter line.'\n\n'How do you mean to live then?' asked the sister.\n\n'I suppose I must regard myself as a young raven, and look for\nheavenly manna; besides, we have all got something when the\ngovernor goes.'\n\n'Yes--you'll have enough to supply yourself with gloves and boots;\nthat is, if the Jews have not got the possession of it all. I\nbelieve they have the most of it already. I wonder, Bertie, at your\nindifference; that you, with your talents and personal advantages,\nshould never try to settle yourself in life. I look forward with\ndread to the time when the governor must go. Mother, and Madeline,\nand I,--we shall be poor enough, but you will have absolutely\nnothing.'\n\n'Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof,' said Bertie.\n\n'Will you take my advice?' said the sister.\n\n'Cela depend,' said the brother.\n\n'Will you marry a wife with money?'\n\n'At any rate,' said he, 'I won't marry one without; wives with\nmoney a'nt so easy to get now-a-days; the parsons pick them all\nup.'\n\n'And a parson will pick up the wife I meant for you, if you do not\nlook quickly about it; the wife I mean is Mrs Bold.'\n\n'Whew-w-w-w!' whistled Bertie, 'a widow!'\n\n'She is very beautiful,' said Charlotte.\n\n'With a son and heir already to my hand,' said Bertie.\n\n'A baby that will very likely die,' said Charlotte.\n\n'I don't see that,' said Bertie. 'But however, he may live for\nme--I don't wish to kill him; only, it must be owned that a\nready-made family is a drawback.'\n\n'There is only one after all,' pleaded Charlotte.\n\n'And that a very little one, as the maid-servant said,' rejoined\nBertie.\n\n'Beggars mustn't be choosers, Bertie; you can't have everything.'\n\n'God knows I am not unreasonable,' said he, 'nor yet opinionated;\nand if you'll arrange it for me, Lotte, I'll marry the lady. Only\nmark this: the money must be sure, and the income at my own\ndisposal, at any rate for the lady's life.'\n\nCharlotte was explaining to her brother that he must make love for\nhimself if he meant to carry on the matter, and was encouraging him\nto so, by warm eulogiums on Eleanor's beauty, when the signora was\nbrought into the drawing-room. When at home, and subject to the\ngaze of none but her own family, she allowed herself to be dragged\nabout by two persons, and her two bearers now deposited her on the\nsofa. She was not quite so grand in her apparel as she had been at\nthe bishop's party, but yet she was dressed with much care, and\nthough there was a look of care and pain about her eyes, she, was,\neven by daylight, extremely beautiful.\n\n'Well, Madeline; so I'm going to be married,' Bertie began, as soon\nas the servants had withdrawn.\n\n'There's no other foolish thing left, that you haven't done,' said\nMadeline, 'and therefore you are quite right to try that.'\n\n'Oh, you think it's a foolish thing, do you?' said he. 'There's\nLotte advising me to marry by all means. But on such a subject your\nopinion ought to be the best; you have experience to guide you.'\n\n'Yes, I have,' said Madeline, with a sort of harsh sadness in her\ntone, which seemed to say--What is it to you if I am sad? I have\nnever asked your sympathy.\n\nBertie was sorry when he saw that she was hurt by what he said, and\nhe came and squatted on the floor close before her face to make his\npeace with her.\n\n'Come, Mad, I was only joking; you know that. But in sober earnest,\nLotte is advising me to marry. She wants me to marry Mrs Bold.\nShe's a widow with lots of tin, a fine baby, a beautiful\ncomplexion, and the George and Dragon hotel up in High Street. By\nJove, Lotte, if I marry her, I'll keep the public house\nmyself--it's just the life that suits me.'\n\n'What?' said Madeline, 'that vapid swarthy creature in the widow's\ncap, who looked as though her clothes had been stuck on her back\nwith a pitchfork!' The signora never allowed any woman to be\nbeautiful.\n\n'Instead of being vapid,' said Lotte, 'I call her a very lovely\nwoman. She was by far the loveliest woman in the rooms the other\nnight; that is, excepting you, Madeline.'\n\nEven the compliment did not soften the asperity of the maimed\nbeauty. 'Every woman is charming according to Lotte,' she said; 'I\nnever knew an eye with so little true appreciation. In the first\nplace, what woman on earth could look well in such a thing as that\nshe had on her head?'\n\n'Of course she wears a widow's cap; but she'll put that off when\nBertie marries her.'\n\n'I don't see any \"of course\" in it,' said Madeline. 'The death of\ntwenty husbands should not make me undergo such a penance. It is as\nmuch a relic of paganism as the sacrifice of a Hindu woman at the\nburning of her husband's body. If not so bloody, it is quite as\nbarbarous, and quite as useless.'\n\n'But you don't blame her for that,' said Bertie. 'She does it\nbecause it's the custom of the country. People would think ill of\nher if she didn't do it.'\n\n'Exactly,' said Madeline. 'She is just one of those English\nnonentities who would tie her head up in a bag for three months\nevery summer, if her mother and her grandmother had tied up their\nheads before her. It would never occur to her, to think whether\nthere was any use in submitting to such a nuisance.'\n\n'It's very hard, in a country like England, for a young woman to\nset herself in opposition to the prejudices of that sort,' said the\nprudent Charlotte.\n\n'What you mean is, that it's very hard for a fool not to be a\nfool,' said Madeline.\n\nBertie Stanhope had so much knocked about the world from his\nearliest years, that he had not retained much respect for the\ngravity of English customs; but even to his mind an idea presented\nitself, that, perhaps in a wife, true British prejudice would not\nin the long run be less agreeable than Anglo-Italian freedom from\nrestraint. He did not exactly say so, but he expressed the idea in\nanother way.\n\n'I fancy,' said he, 'that if I were to die, and then walk, I should\nthink that my widow looked better in one of those caps than any\nother kind of head-dress.'\n\n'Yes--and you'd fancy also that she could do nothing better than\nshut herself up and cry for you, or else burn herself. But she\nwould think differently. She'd probably wear one of those horrid\nshe-helmets, because she'd want the courage not to do so; but she'd\nwear it with a heart longing for the time when she might be allowed\nto throw it off. I hate such shallow false pretences. For my part,\nI would let the world say what it pleased, and show no grief if I\nfelt none;--and perhaps not, if I did.'\n\n'But wearing a widow's cap won't lessen her fortune,' said\nCharlotte.\n\n'Or increase it,' said Madeline. 'Then why on earth does she do\nit?'\n\n'But Lotte's object is to make her put it off,' said Bertie.\n\n'If it be true that she has got twelve hundred a year quite at her\nown disposal, and she be not utterly vulgar in her manners, I would\nadvise you to marry her. I dare say she is to be had for the\nasking; and as you are not going to marry her for love, it doesn't\nmuch matter whether she is good-looking or not. As to your really\nmarrying a woman for love, I don't believe you are fool enough for\nthat.'\n\n'Oh, Madeline!' cried her sister.\n\n'And oh, Charlotte!' said the other.\n\n'You don't mean to say that no man can love a woman unless he is a\nfool?'\n\n'I mean very much the same thing,--that any man who is willing to\nsacrifice his interest to get possession of a pretty face is a\nfool. Pretty faces are to be had cheaper than that. I hate your\nmawkish sentimentality, Lotte. You know as well as I do in what way\nhusbands and wives generally live together; you know how far the\nwarmth of conjugal affection can withstand the trial of a bad\ndinner, of a rainy day, or of the least privation which poverty\nbrings with it; you know what freedom a man claims for himself,\nwhat slavery he would exact from his wife if he could! And you know\nalso how wives generally obey. Marriage means tyranny on one side\nand deceit on the other. I say that a man is a fool to sacrifice\nhis interests for such a bargain. A woman, too generally, has no\nother way of living.'\n\n'But Bertie has no other way of living,' said Charlotte.\n\n'Then, in God's name, let him marry Mrs Bold,' said Madeline. And\nso it was settled between them.\n\nBut let the gentle-hearted reader be under no apprehension\nwhatsoever. It is not destined that Eleanor shall marry Mr Slope or\nBertie Stanhope. And here, perhaps, it may be allowed to the\nnovelist to explain his views on a very important point in the art\nof telling tales. He ventures to reprobate that system which goes\nso far to violate all proper confidence between the author and his\nreaders, by maintaining nearly to the end of the third volume a\nmystery as to the fate of their favourite personage. Nay, more, and\nworse than this, is too frequently done. Have not often the\nprofoundest efforts of genius been used to baffle the aspirations\nof the reader, to raise false hopes and false fears, and to give\nrise to expectations which are never realised? Are not promises all\nbut made of delightful horrors, in lieu of which the writer\nproduces nothing but commonplace realities in his final chapter?\nAnd is there not a species of deceit in this to which the honesty\nof the present age should lend no countenance?\n\nAnd what can be the worth of that solicitude which a peep into the\nthird volume can utterly dissipate? What the value of those\nliterary charms which are absolutely destroyed by their enjoyment?\nWhen we have once learnt what was the picture before which was hung\nMrs Radcliffe's solemn curtain, we feel no further interest about\neither the frame or the veil. They are to us, merely a receptacle\nfor old bones, and inappropriate coffin, which we would wish to\nhave decently buried out of our sight.\n\nAnd then, how grievous a thing it is to have the pleasure of your\nnovel destroyed by the ill-considered triumph of a previous reader.\n'Oh, you needn't be alarmed, for Augusta, of course, she accepts\nGustavus in the end.' 'How very ill-natured you are, Susan,' says\nKitty, with tears in her eyes; 'I don't care a bit about it now.'\nDear Kitty, if you will read my book, you may defy the ill-nature\nof your sister. There shall be no secret that she can tell you.\nNay, take the last chapter, if you please--learn from its pages all\nthe results of our troubled story, and the story shall have lost\nnone of its interest, if indeed, there be any interest in it to\nlose.\n\nOur doctrine is, that the author and the reader should move along\ntogether in full confidence with each other. Let the personages of\nthe drama undergo ever so completely a comedy of errors among\nthemselves, but let the spectator never mistake the Syracusan for\nthe Ephesian; otherwise he is one of the dupes, and the part of a\ndupe is never dignified.\n\nI would not for the value of this chapter have it believed by a\nsingle reader that my Eleanor could bring herself to marry Mr\nSlope, or that she should be sacrificed to a Bertie Stanhope. But\namong the good folk of Barchester many believed both the one and\nthe other.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nBABY WORSHIP\n\n'Diddle, diddle, diddle, diddle, dum, dum, dum,' said, or sung\nEleanor Bold.\n\n'Diddle, diddle, diddle, diddle, dum, dum, dum,' continued Mary\nBold, taking up the second part in the concerted piece.\n\nThe only audience at the concert was the baby, who however gave\nsuch vociferous applause, that the performers presuming it to\namount to an encore, commenced again.\n\n'Diddle, diddle, diddle, diddle, dum, dum, dum: hasn't he got\nlovely legs?' said the rapturous mother.\n\n'H'm, 'm, 'm, 'm, 'm,' simmered Mary, burying her lips in the\nlittle fellow's fat neck, by way of kissing him.\n\n'H'm, 'm, 'm, 'm, 'm,' simmered the mamma, burying her lips also in\nhis fat round short legs. 'He's a dawty little bold darling, so he\nis; and he has the nicest little pink legs in all the world, so he\nhas;' and the simmering and the kissing went on over again, and as\nthough the ladies were very hungry, and determined to eat him.\n\n'Well, then, he's his own mother's own darling: well, he shall--oh,\noh,--Mary, Mary--did you ever see? What am I to do? My naughty,\nnaughty, naughty little Johnny.' All these energetic exclamations\nwere elicited by the delight of the mother in finding that her son\nwas strong enough and mischievous enough, to pull all her hair out\nfrom under her cap. 'He's been and pulled down all mamma's hair,\nand he's the naughtiest, naughtiest, naughtiest little man that\never, ever, ever, ever, ever--'\n\nA regular service of baby worship was going on. Mary Bold was\nsitting on a low easy chair, with the boy in her lap, and Eleanor\nwas kneeling before the object of her idolatry. As she tried to\ncover up the little fellow's face with her long, glossy, dark brown\nlocks, and permitted him to pull them hither and thither, as he\nwould, she looked very beautiful in spite of the widow's cap which\nshe still wore. There was a quiet, enduring, grateful sweetness\nabout her face, which grew so strongly upon those who knew her, as\nto make the great praise of her beauty which came from her old\nfriends, appear marvellously exaggerated to those who were only\nslightly acquainted with her. Her loveliness was like that of many\nlandscapes, which require to be often seen to be fully enjoyed.\nThere was a depth of dark clear brightness in her eyes which was\nlost upon a quick observer, a character about her mouth which only\nshowed itself to those with whom she familiarly conversed, a\nglorious form of head the perfect symmetry of which required the\neyes of an artist for its appreciation. She had none of that\ndazzling brilliancy, of that voluptuous Rubens beauty, of that\npearly whiteness, and those vermilion tints, which immediately\nentranced with the power of a basilisk men who came within reach of\nMadeline Neroni. It was all be impossible to resist the signora,\nbut no one was called upon for any resistance towards Eleanor. You\nmight begin to talk to her as though she were your sister, and it\nwould not be till your head was on your pillow, that the truth and\nintensity of her beauty would flash upon you; that the sweetness of\nher voice would come upon your ear. A sudden half-hour with the\nNeroni, was like falling into a pit; an evening spent with Eleanor\nlike an unexpected ramble in some quiet fields of asphodel.\n\n'We'll cover him up till there shan't be a morsel of his little\n'ittle, 'ittle, 'ittle nose to be seen,' said the mother,\nstretching her streaming locks over the infant's face. The child\nscreamed with delight, and kicked till Mary Bold was hardly able to\nhold him.\n\nAt this moment the door opened, and Mr Slope was announced. Up\njumped Eleanor, and with a sudden quick motion of her hands pushed\nback her hair over her shoulders. It would have been perhaps better\nfor her that she had not, for she thus showed more of her confusion\nthan she would have done had she remained as she was. Mr Slope,\nhowever, immediately recognised the loveliness, and thought to\nhimself, that irrespective of her fortune, she would be an inmate\nthat a man might well desire for his house, a partner for his\nbosom's care very well qualified to make care lie easy. Eleanor\nhurried out of the room to re-adjust her cap, muttering some\nunnecessary apology about her baby. And while she was gone, we will\nbriefly go back and state what had been hitherto the results of Mr\nSlope's meditations on his scheme of matrimony.\n\nHis inquiries as to the widow's income had at any rate been so far\nsuccessful as to induce him to determine to go on with the\nspeculation. As regarded Mr Harding, he had also resolved to do\nwhat he could without injury to himself. To Mrs Proudie he\ndetermined not to speak on the matter, at least not at present. His\nobject was to instigate a little rebellion on the part of the\nbishop. He thought that such a state of things would be advisable,\nnot only in respect to Messrs Harding and Quiverful, but also in\nthe affairs of the diocese generally. Mr Slope was by no means of\nthe opinion that Dr Proudie was fit to rule, but he conscientiously\nthought it wrong that his brother clergy should be subjected to\npetticoat government. He therefore made up his mind to infuse a\nlittle of his spirit into the bishop, sufficient to induce him to\noppose his wife, though not enough to make him altogether\ninsubordinate.\n\nHe had therefore taken the opportunity of again speaking to his\nlordship about the hospital, and had endeavoured to make it appear\nthat after all it would be unwise to exclude Mr Harding from the\nappointment. Mr Slope, however, had a harder task than he had\nimagined. Mrs Proudie, anxious to assume to herself as much as\npossible of the merit of patronage, had written to Mrs Quiverful,\nrequesting her to call at the palace; and had then explained to\nthat matron, with much mystery, condescension, and dignity, the\ngood that was in store for her and her progeny. Indeed Mrs Proudie\nhad been so engaged at the very time that Mr Slope had been doing\nthe same with her husband at Puddingdale Vicarage, and had thus in\na measure committed herself. The thanks, the humility, the\ngratitude, the surprise of Mrs Quiverful had been very\noverpowering; she had all but embraced the knees of her patroness;\nand had promised that the prayers of fourteen unprovided babes (so\nMrs Quiverful had described her own family, the eldest of which was\na stout young woman of three-and-twenty) should be put up to heaven\nmorning and evening for the munificent friend whom God had sent to\nthem. Such incense as this was not unpleasing to Mrs Proudie, and\nshe made the most of it. She offered her general assistance to the\nfourteen unprovided babes, if, as she had no doubt, she should find\nthem worthy; expressed a hope that the eldest of them would be fit\nto undertake tuition in her Sabbath schools, and altogether made\nherself a very great lady in the estimation of Mrs Quiverful.\n\nHaving done this, she thought it prudent to drop a few words before\nthe bishop, letting him know that she had acquainted the\nPuddingdale family with their good fortune; so that he might\nperceive that he stood committed to the appointment. The husband\nwell understood the rule of his wife, but he did not resent it. He\nknew that she was taking the patronage out of his hands; he was\nresolved to put an end to her interference, and re-assume his\npowers. But then he thought this was not the best time to do it. He\nput off the evil hour, as many a man in similar circumstances has\ndone before him.\n\nSuch having been the case, Mr Slope, naturally encountered a\ndifficulty in talking over the bishop, a difficulty indeed which he\nfound could not be overcome except at the cost of a general\noutbreak at the palace. A general outbreak at the present moment\nmight be good policy, but it also might not. It was at any rate not\na step to be lightly taken. He began by whispering to the bishop\nthat he feared the public opinion would be against him if Mr\nHarding did not reappear at the hospital. The bishop answered with\nsome warmth that Mr Quiverful had been promised the appointment on\nMr Slope's advice. 'Not promised!' said Mr Slope. 'Yes, promised,'\nreplied the bishop, 'and Mrs Proudie has seen Mrs Quiverful on the\nsubject.' This was quite unexpected on the part of Mr Slope, but\nhis presence of mind did not fail him, and he turned the statement\nto his own account.\n\n'Ah, my lord,' said he, 'we shall all be in scrapes if the ladies\ninterfere.'\n\nThis was too much in unison with his lordship's feelings to be\naltogether unpalatable, and yet such an allusion to interference\ndemanded a rebuke. My lord was somewhat astounded also, though not\naltogether made miserable, by finding that there was a point of\ndifference between his wife and his chaplain.\n\n'I don't know what you mean by interference,' said the bishop\nmildly. 'When Mrs Proudie heard that Mr Quiverful was to be\nappointed, it was not unnatural that she should wish to see Mrs\nQuiverful about the schools. I really cannot say that I see any\ninterference.'\n\n'I only speak, my lord, for your own comfort,' said Slope; 'for\nyour own comfort and dignity in the diocese. I can have no other\nmotive. As far as personal feelings go, Mrs Proudie is the best\nfriend I have. I must always remember that. But still, in my\npresent position, my first duty is to your lordship.'\n\n'I am sure of that, Mr Slope, I am quite sure of that;' said the\nbishop mollified: 'and I really think that Mr Harding should have\nthe hospital.'\n\n'Upon my word, I am inclined to think so. I am quite prepared to\ntake upon myself the blame of first suggesting Mr Quiverful's name.\nBut since doing so, I have found that there is so strong a feeling\nin the diocese in favour of Mr Harding, that I think your lordship\nshould give way. I hear also that Mr Harding has modified his\nobjections he first felt to your lordship's propositions. And as to\nwhat has passed between Mrs Proudie and Mrs Quiverful, the\ncircumstance may be a little inconvenient, but I really do not\nthink that that should weigh in a matter of so much moment.'\n\nAnd thus the poor bishop was left in a dreadfully undecided state\nas to what he should do. His mind, however, slightly inclined\nitself to the appointment of Mr Harding, seeing that by such a\nstep, he should have the assistance of Mr Slope in opposing Mrs\nProudie.\n\nSuch was the state of affairs at the palace, when Mr Slope called\nat Mrs Bold's house, and found her playing with her baby. When she\nran out of the room, Mr Slope began praising the weather to Mary\nBold, then he praised the baby and kissed him, and then he praised\nthe mother, and then he praised Miss Bold herself. Mrs Bold,\nhowever, was not long before she came back.\n\n'I have to apologise for calling at so very early an hour,' began\nMr Slope, 'but I was really so anxious to speak to you that I hope\nyou and Miss Bold will excuse me.'\n\nEleanor muttered something in which the words 'certainly', and 'of\ncourse', and 'not early at all', were just audible, and then\napologised for her own appearance, declaring with a smile, that her\nbaby was becoming such a big boy that he was quite unmanageable.\n\n'He's a great bit naughty boy,' said she to the child; 'and we must\nsent him away to a great big rough romping school, where they have\ngreat big rods, and do terrible things to naughty boys who don't do\nwhat their own mammas tell them;' and she then commenced another\ncourse of kissing, being actuated thereto by the terrible idea of\nsending her child away which her own imagination had depicted.\n\n'And where the masters don't have such beautiful long hair to be\ndishevelled,' said Mr Slope, taking up the joke and paying a\ncompliment at the same time.\n\nEleanor thought he might as well have left the compliment alone;\nbut she said nothing and looked nothing, being occupied as she was\nwith the baby.\n\n'Let me take him,' said Mary. 'His clothes are nearly off his back\nwith his romping,' and so saying she left the room with the child.\nMiss Bold had heard Mr Slope say he had something pressing to say\nto Eleanor, and thinking that she might be de trop, took the\nopportunity of getting herself out of the room.\n\n'Don't be long, Mary,' said Eleanor, as Miss Bold shut the door.\n\n'I am glad, Mrs Bold, to have the opportunity of having ten\nminutes' conversation with you alone,' began Mr Slope. 'Will you\nlet me openly ask you a plain question?'\n\n'Certainly,' said she.\n\n'And I am sure you will give me a plain and open answer.'\n\n'Either that or none at all,' said she, laughing.\n\n'My question is this, Mrs Bold; is your father really anxious to\nget back to the hospital?'\n\n'Why do you ask me?' said she. 'Why don't you ask himself?'\n\n'My dear Mrs Bold, I'll tell you why. There are wheels within\nwheels, all of which I would explain to you, only I fear there is\nnot time. It is essentially necessary that I should have an answer\nto this question, otherwise I cannot know how to advance your\nfather's wishes; and it is quite impossible that I should ask\nhimself. No one can esteem your father more than I do, but I doubt\nif this feeling is reciprocal.' It certainly was not. 'I must be\ncandid with you as the only means of avoiding ultimate\nconsequences, which may be most injurious to Mr Harding. I fear\nthere is a feeling, I will not even call it a prejudice, with\nregard to myself in Barchester, which is not in my favour. You\nremember the sermon--'\n\n'Oh! Mr Slope, we need not go back to that,' said Eleanor.\n\n'For one moment, Mrs Bold. It is not that I may talk of myself, but\nbecause it is so essential that you should understand how matters\nstand. That sermon may have been ill-judged,--it was certainly\nmisunderstood; but I will say nothing about that now; only this,\nthat it did give rise to a feeling against myself which your father\nshares with others. It may be that he has proper cause, but the\nresult is that he is not inclined to meet me on friendly terms. I\nput it to yourself whether you do not know this to be the case.'\n\nEleanor made no answer, and Mr Slope, in the eagerness of his\naddress, edged his chair a little nearer to the widow's seat,\nunperceived by her.\n\n'Such being so,' continued Mr Slope, 'I cannot ask him this\nquestion as I can ask it of you. In spite of my delinquencies since\nI came to Barchester you have allowed me to regard you as a\nfriend.' Eleanor made a little motion with her head which was\nhardly confirmatory, but Mr Slope if he noticed it, did not appear\nto do so. 'To you I can speak openly, and explain the feelings of\nmy heart. This your father would not allow. Unfortunately the\nbishop has thought it right that this matter of the hospital should\npass through my hands. There have been some details to get up with\nwhich he would not trouble himself, and thus it has come to pass\nthat I was forced to have an interview with your father on the\nmatter.'\n\n'I am aware of that,' said Eleanor.\n\n'Of course,' said he. 'In that interview Mr Harding left the\nimpression on my mind that he did not wish to return to the\nhospital.'\n\n'How could that be?' said Eleanor, at last stirred up to forget the\ncold propriety of demeanour which she had determined to maintain.\n\n'My dear Mrs Bold, I give you my word that such was the case,' said\nhe, again getting a little nearer to her. 'And what is more than\nthat, before my interview with Mr Harding, certain persons at the\npalace, I do not mean the bishop, had told me that such was the\nfact. I own, I hardly believed it; I own, I thought that your\nfather would wish on every account, for conscience' sake, for the\nsake of those old men, for old association, and the memory of dear\ndays gone by, on every account I thought that he would wish to\nresume his duties. But I was told that such was not his wish; and\nhe certainly left me with the impression that I had been told the\ntruth.'\n\n'Well!' said Eleanor, now sufficiently roused on the matter.\n\n'I fear Miss Bold's step,' said Mr Slope, 'would it be asking too\ngreat a favour to beg you to--I know you can manage anything with\nMiss Bold.'\n\nEleanor did not like the word manage, but still she went out, and\nasked Mary to leave them alone for another quarter of an hour.\n\n'Thank you, Mrs Bold,--I am so very grateful for this confidence.\nWell, I left your father with this impression. Indeed, I may say\nthat he made me understand that he declined the appointment.'\n\n'Not the appointment,' said Eleanor. 'I am sure he did not decline\nthe appointment. But he said that he would not agree,--that is,\nthat he did not like the scheme about the schools, and the\nservices, and all that. I am quite sure he never said he wished to\nrefuse the place.'\n\n'Oh, Mrs Bold!' said Mr Slope, in a manner almost impassioned. 'I\nwould not, for the world, say to so good a daughter a word against\nso good a father. But you must, for his sake, let me show you\nexactly how the matter stands at present. Mr Harding was a little\nflurried when I told him of the bishop's wishes about the school. I\ndid so, perhaps, with less caution because you yourself had so\nperfectly agreed with me on the same subject. He was a little put\nout and spoke warmly. \"Tell the bishop,\" said he, \"that I quite\ndisagree with him,--and shall not return to the hospital as such\nconditions are attached to it.\" What he said was to that effect;\nindeed, his words were, if anything, stronger than those. I had no\nalternative but to repeat them to his lordship, who said that he\ncould look on them in no other light than a refusal. He also had\nheard the report that your father did not wish for the appointment,\nand putting all these things together, he thought he had not choice\nbut to look for some one else. He has consequently offered the\nplace to Mr Quiverful.'\n\n'Offered the place to Mr Quiverful!' repeated Eleanor, her eyes\nsuffused with tears. 'Then, Mr Slope, there is an end of it.'\n\n'No, my friend--not so,' said he. 'It is to prevent such being the\nend of it that I am now here. I may at any rate presume that I have\ngot an answer to my question, and that Mr Harding is desirous of\nreturning.'\n\n'Desirous of returning--of course he is,' said Eleanor; 'of course\nhe wishes to have back his house and his income, and his place in\nthe world; to have back what he gave up with such self-denying\nhonesty, if he can have them without restraints on his conduct to\nwhat at his age it would be impossible that he should submit. How\ncan the bishop ask a man of his age to turn schoolmaster to a pack\nof children?'\n\n'Out of the question,' said Mr Slope, laughing slightly; 'of course\nno such demand shall be made on your father. I can at any rate\npromise you that I will not be the medium of any so absurd a\nrequisition. We wished your father to preach in the hospital, as\nthe inmates may naturally be too old to leave it; but even that\nshall not be insisted on. We wished also to attach a Sabbath-day\nschool to the hospital, thinking that such an establishment could\nnot but be useful under the surveillance of so good a clergyman as\nMr Harding, and also under your own. But, dear Mrs Bold; we won't\ntalk of those things now. One thing is clear; we mustdo what we can\nto annul this rash offer the bishop made to Mr Quiverful. Your\nfather wouldn't see Quiverful, would he? Quiverful is an honourable\nman, and would not, for a moment, stand in your father's way.'\n\n'What?' said Eleanor; 'ask a man with fourteen children to give up\nhis preferment! I am quite sure he will do no such thing.'\n\n'I suppose not,' said Slope; and he again drew near to Mrs Bold, so\nthat now they were very close to each other. Eleanor did not think\nmuch about it, but instinctively moved away a little. How greatly\nwould she have increased the distance could he have guessed what\nhad been said about her at Plumstead! 'I suppose not. But it is out\nof the question that Quiverful should supersede your father--quite\nout of the question. The bishop has been too rash. An idea occurs\nto me, which may, perhaps, with God's blessing, put us right. My\ndear Mrs Bold, would you object to seeing the bishop yourself?'\n\n'Why should not my father see him?' said Eleanor. She had once\nbefore in her life interfered with her father's affairs, and then\nnot to much advantage. She was older now, and felt that she should\ntake no step in a matter so vital to him without his consent.\n\n'Why, to tell the truth,' said Mr Slope, with a look of sorrow, as\nthough he greatly bewailed the want of charity in his patron, 'the\nbishop fancies he has cause of anger against your father. I fear an\ninterview would lead to further ill will.'\n\n'Why,' said Eleanor, 'my father is the mildest, the gentlest man\nliving.'\n\n'I only know,' said Slope, 'that he has the best of daughters. So\nyou would not see the bishop? As to getting an interview, I could\nmanage that for you without the slightest annoyance to yourself.'\n\n'I could do nothing, Mr Slope, without consulting my father.'\n\n'Ah!' said he, 'that would be useless; you would then only be your\nfather's messenger. Does anything occur to yourself? Something must\nbe done. Your father shall not be ruined by so ridiculous a\nmisunderstanding.'\n\nEleanor said that nothing occurred to her, but that it was very\nhard; and the tears came to her eyes and rolled down her cheeks. Mr\nSlope would have given much to have had the privilege of drying\nthem; but he had tact enough to know that he had still a great deal\nto do before he could even hope for any privilege with Mrs Bold.\n\n'It cuts me to the heart to see you so grieved,' said he. 'But pray\nlet me assure you that your father's interests shall not be\nsacrificed if it be possible for me to protect them. I will tell\nthe bishop openly what are the facts. I will explain to him that he\nhas hardly the right to appoint any other than your father, and\nwill show him that if he does so he will be guilty of great\ninjustice--and you, Mrs Bold, you will have the charity at any rate\nto believe this of me, that I am truly anxious for your father's\nwelfare,--for his and for your own.'\n\nThe widow hardly knew what answer to make. She was quite aware that\nher father would not be at all thankful to Mr Slope; she had a\nstrong wish to share her father's feelings; and yet she could not\nbut acknowledge that Mr Slope was very kind. Her father, who was\ngenerally charitable to all men, who seldom spoke ill of any one,\nhad warned against Mr Slope, and yet she did not know how to\nabstain from thanking him. What interest could he have in the\nmatter but that which he professed? Nevertheless there was that in\nhis manner which even she distrusted. She felt, and she did not\nknow why, that there was something about him which ought to put her\non her guard.\n\nMr Slope read all this in her hesitating manner just as plainly as\nthough she had opened her heart to him. It was the talent of the\nman that he could so read the inward feelings of women with whom he\nconversed. He knew that Eleanor was doubting him, and that if she\nthanked him she would only do so because she could not help it; but\nyet this did not make him angry or even annoy him. Rome was not\nbuilt in a day.\n\n'I did not come for thanks,' continued he, seeing her hesitation;\n'and do not want them--at any rate before they are merited. But\nthis I do want, Mrs Bold, that I may make myself friends in this\nfold to which it has pleased God to call me as one of the humblest\nof his shepherds. If I cannot do so, my task here must indeed be a\nsad one. I will at any rate endeavour to deserve them.'\n\n'I'm sure,' said she, 'you will soon make plenty of friends.'\n She felt herself obliged to say something.\n\n'That will be nothing unless they are such as will sympathise with\nmy feelings; unless they are such as I can reverence and\nadmire--and love. If the best and purest turn away from me, I\ncannot bring myself to be satisfied with the friendship of the less\nestimable. In such case I must live alone.'\n\n'Oh! I'm sure you will not do that, Mr Slope.' Eleanor meant\nnothing, but it suited him to appear that some special allusion had\nbeen intended.\n\n'Indeed, Mrs Bold, I shall live alone, quite alone as far as the\nheart is concerned, if those with whom I yearn to ally myself turn\naway from me. But enough of this; I have called you my friend, and\nI hope you will not contradict me. I trust the time may come when I\nmay also call your father so. My God bless you, Mrs Bold, you and\nyour darling boy. And tell your father from me that what can be\ndone for his interest shall be done.'\n\nAnd so he took his leave, pressing the widow's hand rather more\nclosely than usual. Circumstances, however, seemed just then to\nmake this intelligible, and the lady did not feel called on to\nresent it.\n\n'I cannot understand him,' said Eleanor to Mary Bold, a few minutes\nafterwards. 'I do not know whether he is a good man or a bad\nman--whether he is true or false.'\n\n'Then give him the benefit of the doubt,' said Mary, 'and believe\nthe best.'\n\n'On the whole I think I do,' said Eleanor. 'I think I do believe\nthat he means well--and if so, it is a shame that we should revile\nhim, and make him miserable while he is among us. But, oh Mary, I\nfear papa will be disappointed in the hospital.'\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nWHO SHALL BE COCK OF THE WALK?\n\nAll this time things were going on somewhat uneasily at the palace.\nThe hint or two which Mr Slope had given was by no means thrown\naway upon the bishop. He had a feeling that if he ever meant to\noppose the now almost unendurable despotism of his wife, he must\nlose no further time in doing so; that if he even meant to be\nhimself master in his own diocese, let alone his own house, he\nshould begin at once. It would have been easier to have done so\nfrom the day of his consecration than now, but easier now than when\nMrs Proudie should have succeeded in thoroughly mastering the\ndiocesan details. Then the proffered assistance of Mr Slope was a\ngreat thing for him, a most unexpected and invaluable aid. Hitherto\nhe had looked on the two as allied forces; and had considered that\nas allied they were impregnable. He had begun to believe that his\nonly chance of escape would be by the advancement of Mr Slope to\nsome distant and rich preferment. But now it seemed that one of his\nenemies, certainly the least potent of them, but nevertheless one\nvery important, was willing to desert his own camp. He walked up\nand down his little study, almost thinking that the time had come\nwhen he would be able to appropriate to his own use the big room\nupstairs, in which his predecessor had always sat.\n\nAs he resolved these things in his mind a note was brought to him\nfrom Archdeacon Grantly, in which that divine begged his lordship\nto do him the honour of seeing him on the morrow--would his\nlordship have the kindness to name the hour? Dr Grantly's proposed\nvisit would have reference to the re-appointment of Mr Harding to\nthe wardenship of Hiram's hospital. The bishop having read this\nnote was informed that the archdeacon's servant was waiting for an\nanswer.\n\nHere at once a great opportunity offered itself to the bishop of\nacting on his own responsibility. He bethought himself of his new\nally, and rang the bell for Mr Slope. It turned out that Mr Slope\nwas not in the house; and then, greatly daring, the bishop with his\nown unassisted spirit wrote a note to the archdeacon saying that he\nwould see him, and naming the hour for doing so. Having watched\nfrom his study-window that the messenger got safely off the\npremises with this despatch, he began to turn over in his mind what\nstep he should next take.\n\nTo-morrow he would have to declare to the archdeacon either that Mr\nHarding should have the appointment, or that he should not have it.\nThe bishop felt that he could not honestly throw over Mr Quiverful\nwithout informing Mrs Proudie, and he resolved at last to brave the\nlioness in her own den and tell her that circumstances were such\nthat it behoved him to reappoint Mr Harding. He did not feel that\nhe should at all derogate from his new courage by promising Mrs\nProudie that the very first piece of available preferment at his\ndisposal should be given to Quiverful to atone for the injury done\nto him. If he could mollify the lioness with such a sop, how happy\nwould he think his first efforts had been?\n\nNot without many misgivings did he find himself in Mrs Proudie's\nboudoir. He had at first thought of sending for her. But it was not\nat all impossible that she might choose to take such a message\namiss, and then also it might be some protection to him to have his\ndaughters present at the interview. He found her sitting with her\naccount books before her nibbling the end of her pencil evidently\nmersed in pecuniary difficulties, and harassed in mind by the\nmultiplicity of palatial expenses, and the heavy cost of episcopal\ngrandeur. Her daughters were around her. Olivia was reading a\nnovel, Augusta was crossing a note to her bosom friend in Baker\nStreet, and Netta was working diminutive coach wheels for the\nbottom of a petticoat. If the bishop could get the better of his\nwife in her present mood, he would be a man indeed. He might then\nconsider victory his own for ever. After all, in such cases the\nmatter between husband and wife stands much the same as it does\nbetween two boys at the same school, two cocks in the same yard, or\ntwo armies on the same continent. The conqueror once is generally\nthe conqueror for ever after. The prestige of victory is\neverything.\n\n'Ahem--my dear,' began the bishop, 'if you are disengaged, I wished\nto speak to you.' Mrs Proudie put her pencil down carefully at the\npoint to which she had dotted her figures, marked down in her\nmemory the sum she had arrived at, and then looked up, sourly\nenough, into her helpmate's face. 'If you are busy, another time\nwill do as well,' continued the bishop, whose courage like Bob\nAcres' had oozed out, now that he found himself on the ground of\nbattle.\n\n'What is it about, bishop?' asked the lady.\n\n'Well--it was about those Quiverfuls--but I see you are engaged.\nAnother time will do just as well for me.'\n\n'What about the Quiverfuls? It is quite understood I believe, that\nthey are to come to the hospital. There is to be no doubt about\nthat, is there?' And as she spoke she kept her pencil sternly and\nvigorously fixed on the column of figures before her.\n\n'Why, my dear, there is a difficulty,' said the bishop.\n\n'A difficulty!' said Mrs Proudie, 'What difficulty? The place\nhas been promised to Mr Quiverful, and of course he must have it.\nHe has made all his arrangements. He has written for a curate for\nPuddingdale, he has spoken to the auctioneer about selling his\nfarm, horses, and cows, and in all respects considers the place as\nhis own. Of course he must have it.'\n\nNow, bishop, look well to thyself, and call up all the manhood that\nis in thee. Think how much is at stake. If now thou art not true to\nthy guns, no Slope can hereafter aid thee. How can he who deserts\nhis own colours at the final smell of gunpowder expect faith in any\nally. Thou thyself hast sought the battlefield; fight out the\nbattle manfully now thou art there. Courage, bishop, courage!\nFrowns cannot kill, nor can sharp words break any bones. After all\nthe apron is thine own. She can appoint no wardens, give away no\nbenefices, nominate no chaplains, an' thou art but true to thyself.\nUp, man, and at her with a constant heart.\n\nSome little monitor within the bishop's breast so addressed him.\nBut then there was another monitor there which advised him\ndifferently, and as follows. Remember, bishop, she is a woman, and\nsuch a woman is the very mischief. Were it not better for thee to\ncarry on this war, if it must be waged, from behind thine own table\nin thine own study? Does not every cock fight best on is own\ndunghill? Thy daughters also are here, the pledges of thy love, the\nfruits of thy loins; is it well that they should see thee in the\nhour of thy victory over their mother? Nay, is it well that they\nshould see thee in the possible hour of thy defeat? Besides, hast\nthou not chosen thy opportunity with wonderful little skill, indeed\nwith no touch of sagacity for which thou art famous? Will it not\nturn out that thou art wrong in this matter, and thine enemy right;\nthat thou hast actually pledged thyself in this matter of the\nhospital, and that now thou wouldst turn upon thy wife because she\nrequires from thee but the fulfilment of thy promise? Art thou not\na Christian bishop, and is not thy word to be held sacred whatever\nbe the result? Return, bishop, to thy sanctum on the lower floor,\nand postpone thy combative propensities for some occasion in which\nat least thou mayest fight the battle against odds less\ntremendously against thee.\n\nAll this passed within the bishop's bosom while Mrs Proudie stall\nsat with her fixed pencil, and the figures of her sum still\nenduring on the tablets of her memory. 'L4 17s 7d,' she said to\nherself. 'Of course Mr Quiverful must have the hospital,' she said\nout loud to her lord.\n\n'Well, my dear, I merely wanted to suggest to you that Mr Slope\nseems to think that if Mr Harding be not appointed, public feeling\nin the matter would be against us and that the press might perhaps\ntake it up.'\n\n'Mr Slope seems to think!' said Mrs Proudie, in a tone of voice\nwhich plainly showed the bishop that he was right in looking for a\nbreach in that quarter. 'And what has Mr Slope to do with it? I\nhope, my lord, you are not going to allow yourself to be governed\nby a chaplain.' and now in her eagerness the lady lost her place in\nher account.\n\n'Certainly not, my dear. Nothing I can assure you is less probable.\nBut still Mr Slope may be useful in finding how the wind blows, and\nI really thought that if we could give something good to Mr\nQuiverful--'\n\n'Nonsense,' said Mrs Proudie; 'it would be years before you could\ngive them anything else that could suit them half as well, and as\nfor the press and the public, and all that, remember there are two\nways of telling a story. If Mr Harding is fool enough to tell his\ntale, we can also tell ours. The place was offered to him, and he\nrefused it. It has now been given to someone else, and there's an\nend of it. At least, I should think so.'\n\n'Well, my dear, I rather believe you are right;' said the bishop,\nand sneaking out of the room, he went down stairs, troubled in his\nmind as to how he should receive the archdeacon on the morrow. He\nfelt himself not very well just at present; and began to consider\nthat he might, not improbably, be detained in his room the next\nmorning by an attack of bile. He was, unfortunately, very subject\nto bilious annoyances.\n\n'Mr Slope, indeed! I'll Slope him,' said the indignant matron to\nher listening progeny. 'I don't know what has come to Mr Slope. I\nbelieve he thinks he is to be Bishop of Barchester himself, because\nI have taken him by the hand, and got your father to make him his\ndomestic chaplain.'\n\n'He was always full of impudence,' said Olivia; 'I told you so once\nbefore, mamma.' Olivia, however, had not thought him too impudent\nwhen once before he had proposed to make her Mrs Slope.\n\n'Well, Olivia, I always thought you liked him,' said Augusta, who\nat that moment had some grudge against her sister. 'I always\ndisliked the man because I think him thoroughly vulgar.'\n\n'There you're wrong,' said Mrs Proudie; 'he's not vulgar at all;\nand what is more, he is a soul-stirring, eloquent preacher; but he\nmust be taught to know his place if he is to remain in this house.'\n\n'He has the horridest eyes I ever saw in a man's head,' said Netta;\n'and I tell you what, he's terribly greedy; did you see the current\npie he ate yesterday?'\n\nWhen Mr Slope got home he soon learnt from the bishop, as much from\nhis manner as his words, that Mrs Proudie's behests in the matter\nof the hospital were to be obeyed. Dr Proudie let fall something as\nto 'this occasion only,' and 'keeping all affairs about patronage\nexclusively in his own hands.' But he was quite decided about Mr\nHarding; and as Mr Slope did not wish to have both the prelate and\nthe prelatess against him, he did not at present see that he could\ndo anything but yield.\n\nHe merely remarked that he would of course carry out the bishop's\nviews, and that he was quite sure that if the bishop trusted to his\nown judgment things in the diocese would certainly be well ordered.\nMr Slope knew that if you hit a nail on the head often enough, it\nwill penetrate at last.\n\nHe was sitting alone in his room on the same evening when a light\nknock was made on his door, and before he could answer it the door\nwas opened, and his patroness appeared. He was all smiles in a\nmoment, but so was not she also. She took, however, the chair that\nwas offered to her, and thus began her expostulation :-\n\n'Mr Slope, I did not at all approve your conduct the other night\nwith that Italian woman. Any one would have thought that you were\nher lover.'\n\n'Good gracious, my dear madam,' said Mr Slope, with a look of\nhorror. 'Why, she is a married woman.'\n\n'That's more than I know,' said Mrs Proudie; 'however she chooses\nto pass for such. But married or not married, such attention as you\npaid her was improper. I cannot believe that you would wish to give\noffence in my drawing-room, Mr Slope; but I owe it to myself and my\ndaughters to tell you that I disapprove your conduct.'\n\nMr Slope opened wide his huge protruding eyes, and stared out of\nthem with a look of well-dignified surprise. 'Why, Mrs Proudie,'\nsaid he, 'I did but fetch her something to eat when she was\nhungry.'\n\n'And you have called on her since,' continued she, looking at the\nculprit with the stern look of a detective policeman in the act of\ndeclaring himself.\n\nMr Slope turned over in his mind whether it would be well for him\nto tell this termagant at once that he should call on whom he\nliked, and do what he liked; but he remembered that his footing in\nBarchester was not yet sufficiently firm, and that it would be\nbetter for him to pacify her.\n\n'I certainly called since at Dr Stanhope's house, and certainly saw\nMadame Neroni.'\n\n'Yes, and you saw her alone,' said the episcopal Argus.\n\n'Undoubtedly I did,' said Mr Slope, 'but that was because nobody\nelse happened to be in the room. Surely it was no fault of mine if\nthe rest of the family were out.'\n\n'Perhaps not; but I assure you, Mr Slope, you will fall greatly in\nmy estimation if I find that you allow yourself to be caught by the\nlures of that woman. I know women better than you do, Slope, and\nyou may believe me that that signora, as she calls herself, is not\na fitting companion for a strict evangelical, unmarried young\nclergyman.'\n\nHow Mr Slope would have liked to laugh at her, had he dared! But he\ndid not dare. So he merely said, 'I can assure you, Mrs Proudie,\nthe lady in question is nothing to me.'\n\n'Well, I hope not, Mr Slope. But I have considered it my duty to\ngive you this caution; and now there is another thing I feel myself\ncalled upon to speak about; it is your conduct to the bishop, Mr\nSlope.'\n\n'My conduct to the bishop,' said he, now truly surprised and\nignorant what the lady alluded to.\n\n'Yes, Mr Slope; your conduct to the bishop. It is by no means what\nI would wish to see it.'\n\n'Has the bishop said anything, Mrs Proudie?'\n\n'No, the bishop has said nothing. He probably thinks that any\nremarks on the matter will come better from me, who first\nintroduced you to his lordship's notice. The fact is, Mr Slope, you\nare a little inclined to take too much upon yourself.'\n\nAn angry spot showed itself upon Mr Slope's cheeks, and it was with\ndifficulty that he controlled himself. But he did do so, and sat\nquite silent while the lady went on.\n\n'It is the fault of many young men in your position, and therefore\nthe bishop is not inclined at present to resent it. You will, no\ndoubt, soon learn what is required from you, and what is not. If\nyou will take my advice, however, you will be careful not to\nobtrude advice upon the bishop in any matter concerning patronage.\nIf his lordship wants advice, he knows where to look for it.' And\nthen having added to her counsel a string of platitudes as to what\nwas desirable and what not desirable in the conduct of a strictly\nevangelical, unmarried young clergyman, Mrs Proudie retreated,\nleaving the chaplain to his thoughts.\n\nThe upshot of his thoughts was this, that there certainly was not\nroom in the diocese for the energies of both himself and Mrs\nProudie, and that it behoved him quickly to ascertain whether his\nenergies or hers would prevail.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nTHE WIDOW'S PERSECUTION\n\nEarly on the following morning, Mr Slope was summoned to the\nbishop's dressing-room, and went there fully expecting that he\nshould find his lordship very indignant, and spirited up by his\nwife to repeat the rebuke which she had administered on the\nprevious day. Mr Slope had resolved that at any rate from him he\nwould not stand it, and entered the dressing-room in rather a\ncombative disposition; but he found the bishop in the most placid\nand gentle of humours. His lordship complained of being rather\nunwell, had a slight headache, and was not quite the thing in his\nstomach; but there was nothing the matter with his temper.\n\n'Oh, Slope,' said he, taking the chaplain's proffered hand.\n'Archdeacon Grantly is to call on me this morning, and I really am\nnot fit to see him. I fear I must trouble you to see him for me;'\nand then Dr Proudie proceeded to explain what it was that must be\nsaid to Dr Grantly. He was to be told in fact in the civilest words\nin which the tidings could be conveyed, that Mr Harding having\nrefused the wardenship, the appointment had been offered to Mr\nQuiverful and accepted by him.\n\nMr Slope again pointed out to his patron that he thought he was\nperhaps not quite wise in his decision, and this he did sotto voce.\nBut even with this precaution it was not safe to say much, and\nduring the little that he did say, the bishop made a very slight,\nbut still a very ominous gesture with his thumb towards the door\nwhich opened from his dressing-room to some inner sanctuary. Mr\nSlope at once took the hint and said no more; but he perceived that\nthere was to be confidence between him and his patron, that the\nleague desired by him was to be made, and that this appointment of\nMr Quiverful was to be the sacrifice offered on the altar of\nconjugal obedience. All this Mr Slope read in the slight motion of\nthe bishop's thumb, and he read it correctly. There was no need of\nparchments and seals, of attestations, explanations, and\nprofessions. The bargain was understood between them, and Mr Slope\ngave the bishop his hand upon it. The bishop understood the little\nextra squeeze, and an intelligible gleam of assent twinkled in his\neye.\n\n'Pray be civil to the archdeacon, Mr Slope,' said he out loud; 'but\nmake him quite understand that in this matter Mr Harding has put it\nout of my power to oblige him.'\n\nIt would be calumny on Mrs Proudie to suggest that she was sitting\nin her bed-room with her ear at the keyhole during this interview.\nShe had within her a spirit of decorum which prevented her from\ndescending to such baseness. To put her ear to a key-hole or to\nlisten at a chink, was a trick for a housemaid.\n\nMrs Proudie knew this, and therefore she did not do it; but she\nstationed herself as near to the door as she well could, that she\nmight, if possible, get the advantage which the housemaid would\nhave had, without descending to the housemaid's artifice.\n\nIt was little, however, that she heard, and that little was only\nsufficient to deceive her. She saw nothing of that friendly\npressure, perceived nothing of that concluded bargain; she did not\neven dream of the treacherous resolves which those two false men\nhad made together to upset her in the pride of her station, to dash\nthe cup from her lip before she had drank of it, to seep away all\nher power before she had tasted its sweets! Traitors that they\nwere; the husband of her bosom, and the outcast whom she had\nfostered and brought into the warmth of the world's brightest\nfireside! But neither of them had the magnanimity of this woman.\nThough two men have thus leagued themselves together against her,\neven yet the battle is not lost.\n\nMr Slope felt pretty sure that Dr Grantly would decline the honour\nof seeing him, and such turned out to be the case. The archdeacon,\nwhen the palace door was opened to him, was greeted by a note. Mr\nSlope presented his compliments &c, &c. The bishop was ill in his\nroom, and very greatly regretted, &c &c. Mr Slope had been charged\nwith the bishop's views, and if agreeable to the archdeacon, would\ndo himself the honour &c, &c. The archdeacon, however, was not\nagreeable, and having read his note in the hall, crumpled it up in\nhis hand, and muttering something about sorrow for his lordship's\nillness, took his leave, without sending as much as a verbal\nmessage in answer to Mr Slope's note.\n\n'Ill!' said the archdeacon to himself as he flung himself into his\nbrougham. 'The man is absolutely a coward. He is afraid to see me.\nIll, indeed!' The archdeacon was never ill himself, and did not\ntherefore understand that any one else could in truth be prevented\nby illness from keeping an appointment. He regarded all such\nexcuses as subterfuges, and in the present instance he was not far\nwrong.\n\nDr Grantly desired to be driven to his father-in-law's lodgings in\nthe High Street, and hearing from the servant that Mr Harding was\nat his daughter's, followed him to Mrs Bold's house, and there he\nfound him. The archdeacon was fuming with rage when he got into the\ndrawing-room, and had by this time nearly forgotten the\npusillanimity of the bishop in the villainy of the chaplain.\n\n'Look at that,' said he, throwing Mr Slope's crumpled note to Mr\nHarding. 'I am to be told that if I choose I may have the honour of\nseeing Mr Slope, and that too, after a positive engagement with the\nbishop.'\n\n'But he says the bishop is ill,' said Mr Harding.\n\n'Pshaw! You don't mean to say that you are deceived by such an\nexcuse as that. He was well enough yesterday. Now I tell you what,\nI will see the bishop; and I will tell him also very plainly what I\nthink of his conduct. I will see him, or else Barchester will soon\nbe too hot to hold him.'\n\nEleanor was sitting in the room, but Dr Grantly had hardly noticed\nher in his anger. Eleanor now said to him, with the greatest\ninnocence, 'I wish you had seen Mr Slope, Dr Grantly, because I\nthink perhaps it might have done good.'\n\nThe archdeacon turned on her with almost brutal wrath. Had she at\nonce owned that she had accepted Mr Slope for her second husband,\nhe could hardly have felt more convinced of her belonging body and\nsoul to the Slope and Proudie party than he now did on hearing her\nexpress such a wish as this. Poor Eleanor!\n\n'See him,' said the archdeacon, glaring at her; 'and why am I be\ncalled on to lower myself in the world's esteem an my own by coming\nin contact with such a man as that? I have hitherto lived among\ngentlemen, and do not mean to be dragged into other company by\nanybody.'\n\nPoor Mr Harding knew well what the archdeacon meant, but Eleanor\nwas as innocent as her own baby. She could not understand how the\narchdeacon could consider himself to be dragged into bad company by\ncondescending to speak to Mr Slope for a few minutes when the\ninterests of her father might be served by doing so.\n\n'I was talking for a full hour yesterday with Mr Slope,' said she,\nwith some little assumption of dignity, 'and I did not find myself\nto be lowered by it.'\n\n'Perhaps not,' said he. 'But if you'll be good enough to allow me,\nI shall judge for myself in such matters. And I tell you what,\nEleanor; it will be much better for you if you will allow yourself\nto be guided also by the advice of those who are your friends. If\nyou do not you will be apt to find you have no friends left who can\nadvise you.'\n\nEleanor blushed up to the roots of her hair. But even now she had\nnot the slightest idea of what was passing in the archdeacon's\nmind. No thought of love-making or love-receiving had yet found its\nway to her heart since the death of poor John Bold; and if it were\npossible that such a thought should spring there, the man must be\nfar different from Mr Slope that could give it birth.\n\nNevertheless Eleanor blushed deeply, for she felt she was charged\nwith improper conduct, and she did so with the more inward pain\nbecause her father did not instantly rally to her side; that father\nfor whose sake and love she had submitted to be the receptacle of\nMr Slope's confidence. She had given a detailed account of all that\nhad passed to her father; and though he had not absolutely agreed\nwith her about Mr Slope's views touching the hospital, yet he had\nsaid nothing to make her think that she had been wrong in talking\nto him.\n\nShe was far too angry to humble herself before her brother- in-law.\nIndeed, she had never accustomed herself to be very abject before\nhim, and they had never been confidential allies. 'I do not in the\nleast understand what you mean, Dr Grantly,' said she. 'I do not\nknow that I can accuse myself of doing anything that my friends\nshould disapprove. Mr Slope called here expressly to ask what\npapa's views were about the hospital; and as I believe he called\nwith friendly intentions I told him.'\n\n'Friendly intentions!' sneered the archdeacon.\n\n'I believe you greatly wrong Mr Slope,' continued Eleanor; 'but I\nhave explained this to papa already; and as you do not seem to\napprove of what I say, Dr Grantly, I will with your permission\nleave you and papa together,' and so saying she walked out of the\nroom.\n\nAll this made Mr Harding very unhappy. It was quite clear that the\narchdeacon and his wife had made up their minds that Eleanor was\ngoing to marry Mr Slope. Mr Harding could not really bring himself\nto think that she would do so, but yet he could not deny that\ncircumstances made it appear that the man's company was not\ndisagreeable to her. She was now constantly seeing him, and yet she\nreceived visits from no other unmarried gentleman. She always took\nhis part when his conduct was canvassed, although she was aware how\npersonally objectionable he was to her friends. Then, again, Mr\nHarding felt that if she should choose to become Mrs Slope, he had\nnothing that he could justly against her doing so. She had full\nright to please herself, and he, as a father could not say that she\nwould disgrace herself by marrying a clergyman who stood so well\nbefore the world as Mr Slope did. As for quarrelling with his\ndaughter on account of such a marriage, and separating himself from\nher as the archdeacon had threatened to do, that, with Mr Harding,\nwould be out of the question. If she should determine to marry this\nman, he must get over his aversion as best he could. His Eleanor,\nhis own old companion in their old happy home, must still be friend\nof his bosom, the child of his heart. Let who would cast her off,\nhe would not. If it were fated, that he should have to sit in his\nold age at the same table with a man whom of all men he disliked\nthe most, he would meet his fate as best he might. Anything to him\nwould be preferable to the loss of his daughter.\n\nSuch being his feelings, he hardly knew how to take part with\nEleanor against the archdeacon, or with the archdeacon against\nEleanor. It will be said that he should never have suspected her.\nAlas! he never should have done so. But Mr Harding was by no means\na perfect character. His indecision, his weakness, his proneness to\nbe led by others, his want of self-confidence, he was very far from\nbeing perfect. And then it must be remembered that such a marriage\nas that which the archdeacon contemplated with disgust, which we\nwho know Mr Slope so well would regard with equal disgust, did not\nappear so monstrous to Mr Harding, because in his charity he did\nnot hate the chaplain as the archdeacon did, and as we do.\n\nHe was, however, very unhappy when his daughter left the room, and\nhe had recourse to an old trick of his that was customary to him in\nhis times of sadness. He began playing some slow tune upon an\nimaginary violoncello, drawing one hand slowly backwards and\nforwards as though he held a bow in it, and modulating the unreal\nchords with the other.\n\n'She'll marry that man as sure as two and two makes four,' said the\npractical archdeacon.\n\n'I hope not, I hope not,' said the father. 'But if she does, what\ncan I say to her? I have no right to object to him.'\n\n'No right!' exclaimed Dr Grantly.\n\n'No right as her father. He is in my own profession, and for aught\nwe know a good man.'\n\nTo this the archdeacon would by no means assent. It was not well,\nhowever, to argue the case against Eleanor in her own drawing-room,\nand so they both walked forth and discussed the matter in all the\nbearings under the elm trees of the close. Mr Harding also\nexplained to his son-in-law what had been the purport, at any rate\nthe alleged purport, of Mr Slope's last visit to the widow. He,\nhowever, stated that he could not bring himself to believe that Mr\nSlope had any real anxiety such as that he had pretended. 'I cannot\nforget his demeanour to myself,' said Mr Harding, 'and it is not\npossible that his ideas should have changed so soon.'\n\n'I see it all,' said the archdeacon. 'The sly tartufe! He thinks to\nbuy the daughter by providing for the father. He means to show how\npowerful he is, how good he is, and how much he is willing to do\nfor her beaux yeux; yes, I see it all now. But we'll be too many\nfor him yet, Mr Harding;' he said, turning to his companion with\nsome gravity, and pressing his hand on the other's arm. 'It would,\nperhaps, be better for you to lose the hospital than get it on such\nterms.'\n\n'Lose it!' said Mr Harding; 'why I've lost it already. I don't want\nit. I've made up my mind to do without it. I'll withdraw\naltogether. I'll just go and write a line to the bishop and tell\nhim that I withdraw my claim altogether.'\n\nNothing would have pleased him better than to be allowed to escape\nfrom the trouble and difficulty in such a manner. But he was now\ngoing too fast for the archdeacon.\n\n'No--no--no! We'll do no such thing,' said Dr Grantly; 'we'll still\nhave the hospital. I hardly doubt but that we'll have it. But not\nby Mr Slope's assistance. If that be necessary, we'll lose it; but\nwe'll have it, spite of his teeth, if we can. Arabin will be at\nPlumstead to-morrow; you must come over and talk to him.'\n\nThe two now turned into the cathedral library, which was used by\nthe clergymen of the close as a sort of ecclesiastical club-room,\nfor writing sermons and sometimes letters; also for reading\ntheological works, and sometimes magazines and newspapers. The\ntheological works were not disturbed, perhaps, quite as often as\nfrom the appearance of the building the outside public might have\nbeen led to expect. Here the two allies settled on their course of\naction. The archdeacon wrote a letter to the bishop, strongly\nworded, but still respectful, in which he put forward his\nfather-in-law's claim to the appointment, and expressed his own\nregret that he had not been able to see his lordship when he\ncalled. Of Mr Slope me made no mention whatsoever. It was then\nsettled that Mr Harding should go to Plumstead on the following\nday; and after considerable discussion on the matter, the\narchdeacon proposed to ask Eleanor there also, so as to withdraw\nher, if possible, from Mr Slope's attentions. 'A week or two,' said\nhe, 'may teach her what he is, and while she is there she will be\nout of harm's way. Mr Slope won't come there after her.'\n\nEleanor was not a little surprised when her brother-in-law came\nback and very civilly pressed her to go out to Plumstead with her\nfather. She instantly perceived that her father had been fighting\nher battles for her behind her back. She felt thankful to him, and\nfor his sake she would not show her resentment to the archdeacon by\nrefusing his invitation. But she could not, she said, go on the\nmorrow; she had an invitation to drink tea at the Stanhopes which\nshe had promised to accept. She would, she added, go with her\nfather on the next day, if he would wait; or she would follow him.\n\n'The Stanhopes!' said Dr Grantly; 'I did not know you were so\nintimate with them.'\n\n'I did not know it myself,' said she, 'till Miss Stanhope called\nyesterday. However, I like her very much, and I have promised to go\nand play chess with some of them.'\n\n'Have they a party there?' said the archdeacon, still fearful of Mr\nSlope.\n\n'Oh, no,' said Eleanor; 'Miss Stanhope said there was to be nobody\nat all. But she had learnt that Mary had left me for a few weeks,\nand she had learnt from some one that I play chess, and so she came\nover on purpose to ask me to go in.'\n\n'Well, that's very friendly,' said the ex-warden. 'They certainly\ndo look more like foreigners than English people, but I dare say\nthey are none the worse for that.'\n\nThe archdeacon was inclined to look upon the Stanhopes with\nfavourable eyes, and had nothing to object on the matter. It was\ntherefore arranged that Mr Harding should postpone his visit to\nPlumstead for one day, and then take with him Eleanor, the baby,\nand the nurse.\n\nMr Slope is certainly becoming of some importance in Barchester.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nBARCHESTER BY MOONLIGHT\n\nThere was much cause for grief and occasional perturbation of\nspirits in the Stanhope family, but yet they rarely seemed to be\ngrieved or to be disturbed. It was the peculiar gift of each of\nthem that each was able to bear his or her own burden without\ncomplaint, and perhaps without sympathy. They habitually looked on\nthe sunny side of the wall, if there was a gleam on the either side\nfor them to look at; and, if there was none, they endured the shade\nwith an indifference which, if not stoical, answered the end at\nwhich the Stoics aimed. Old Stanhope could not but feel that he had\nill-performed his duties as a father and a clergyman; and could\nhardly look forward to his own death without grief at the position\nin which he would leave his family. His income for many years had\nbeen as high as L 3000 a year, and yet they had among them no other\nprovision than their mother's fortune of L 10,000. He had not only\nspent his income, but was in debt. Yet, with all this, he seldom\nshowed much outward sign of trouble.\n\nIt was the same with the mother. If she added little to the\npleasures of her children she detracted still less: she neither\ngrumbled at her lot, nor spoke much of her past or future\nsufferings; as long as she had a maid to adjust her dress, and had\nthose dresses well made, nature with her was satisfied. It was the\nsame with her children. Charlotte never rebuked her father with the\nprospect of their future poverty, nor did it seem to grieve her\nthat she was becoming an old maid so quickly; her temper was rarely\nruffled, and, if we might judge by her appearance, she was always\nhappy. The signora was not so sweet-tempered, but she possessed\nmuch enduring courage; she seldom complained--never, indeed, to her\nfamily. Though she had a cause for affliction which would have\nutterly broken down the heart of most women as beautiful as she and\nas devoid of all religious support, yet, she bore her suffering in\nsilence, or alluded to it only to elicit the sympathy and stimulate\nthe admiration of the men with whom she flirted. As to Bertie, one\nwould have imagined from the sound of his voice and the gleam of\nhis eye that he had not a sorrow nor a care in the world. Nor had\nhe. He was incapable of anticipating tomorrow's griefs. The\nprospect of future want no more disturbed his appetite than does\nthat of the butcher's knife disturb the appetite of the sheep.\n\nSuch was the usual tenor of their way; but there were rare\nexceptions. Occasionally the father would allow an angry glance to\nfall from his eye, and the lion would send forth a low dangerous\nroar as though he meditated some deed of blood. Occasionally also\nMadame Neroni would become bitter against mankind, more than\nusually antagonistic to the world's decencies, and would seem as\nthough she was about to break from her moorings and allow herself\nto be carried forth by the tide of her feelings to utter ruin and\nshipwreck. She, however, like the rest of them, had no real\nfeelings, could feel no true passion. In that was her security.\nBefore she resolved on any contemplated escapade she would make a\nsmall calculation, and generally summed up that the Stanhope villa\nor even Barchester close was better than the world at large.\n\nThey were most irregular in their hours. The father was generally\nthe earliest in the breakfast-parlour, and Charlotte would soon\nfollow and give him coffee; but the others breakfasted anywhere\nanyhow, and at any time. On the morning after the archdeacon's\nfutile visit to the palace, Dr Stanhope came down stairs with an\nominously dark look about his eyebrows; his white locks were\nrougher than usual, and he breathed thickly and loudly as he took\nhis seat in his arm-chair. He had open letters in his hand, and\nwhen Charlotte came into the room he was still reading them. She\nwent up and kissed him as was her wont, but he hardly noticed her\nas she did so, and she knew at once that something was the matter.\n\n'What's the meaning of that?' said he, throwing over the table a\nletter with a Milan post-mark. Charlotte was a little frightened as\nshe took it up, but her mind was relieved when she saw that it was\nmerely the bill of their Italian milliner. The sum total was\ncertainly large, but not so large as to create an important row.\n\n'It's for our clothes, papa, for six months before we came here.\nThe three of us can't dress for nothing you know.'\n\n'Nothing, indeed!' said he, looking at the figures, which in\nMilanese denominations were certainly monstrous.\n\n'The man should have sent it to me,' said Charlotte.\n\n'I wish he had with all my heart--if you would have paid it. I see\nenough in it, to know that three quarters of it are for Madeline.'\n\n'She has little else to amuse her, sir,' said Charlotte with true\ngood nature.\n\n'And I suppose he has nothing to amuse him,' said the doctor,\nthrowing over another letter to his daughter. It was from some\nmember of the family of Sidonia, and politely requested the father\nto pay a small trifle of L 700, being the amount of a bill\ndiscounted in favour of Mr Ethelbert Stanhope, and now overdue for\na period of nine months.\n\nCharlotte read the letter, slowly folded it up, and put it under\nthe edge of the tea-tray.\n\n'I suppose he has nothing to amuse him but discounting bills with\nJews. Does he think I'll pay that?'\n\n'I am sure he thinks no such thing,' said she.\n\n'And who does he think will pay it?'\n\n'As far as honesty goes, I suppose it won't much matter if it is\nnever paid,' said she. 'I dare say he got very little of it.'\n\n'I suppose it won't much matter either,' said the father, 'if he\ngoes to prison and rots there. It seems to me that that's the other\nalternative.'\n\nDr Stanhope spoke the custom of his youth. But his daughter, though\nshe lived so long abroad, was much more completely versed in the\nways of the English world. 'If the man arrests him,' said she, 'he\nmust go through the court.'\n\nIt is thus, thou great family of Sidonia--it is thus that we\nGentiles treat thee, when, in our most extreme need, thou and thine\nhave aided us with mountains of gold as big as lions--and\noccasionally with wine-warrants and orders for dozens of\ndressing-cases.\n\n'What, and become an insolvent?' said the doctor.\n\n'He's that already,' said Charlotte, wishing always to get over a\ndifficulty.\n\n'What a condition,' said the doctor, 'for the son of a clergyman of\nthe Church of England.'\n\n'I don't see why clergymen's sons should pay their debts more than\nother young men,' said Charlotte.\n\n'He's had as much from me since he left school as is held\nsufficient for the eldest son of many a nobleman,' said the angry\nfather.\n\n'Well, sir,' said Charlotte, 'give him another chance.'\n\n'What!' said the doctor, 'do you mean that I am to pay that Jew?'\n\n'Oh, no! I wouldn't pay him, he must take his chance; and if the\nworst comes to the worst, Bertie must go abroad. But I want you to\nbe civil to Bertie, and let him remain here as long as we stop. He\nhas a plan in his head, that may put him on his feet after all.'\n\nJust at that moment the door opened, and Bertie came in whistling.\nThe doctor immediately devoted himself to his egg, and allowed\nBertie to whistle himself round to his sister's side without\nnoticing him.\n\nCharlotte gave a little sign to him with her eye, first glancing at\nher father, and then at the letter, the corner of which peeped out\nfrom under the tea-tray. Bertie saw and understood, and with the\nquiet motion of a cat abstracted the letter, and made himself\nacquainted with its contents. The doctor, however, had seen him,\ndeep as he appeared to be mersed in his egg-shell, and said in his\nharshest voice, 'Well, sir, do you know that gentleman?'\n\n'Yes, sir,' said Bertie. 'I have a sort of acquaintance with him,\nbut none that can justify him in troubling you. If you will allow\nme, sir, I will answer this.'\n\n'At any rate I shan't,' said the father, and then he added, after a\npause, 'Is it true, sir, that you owe the man L 700?'\n\n'Well,' said Bertie, 'I think I should be inclined to dispute the\namount, if I were in a condition to pay him such of it as I really\ndo owe him.'\n\n'Has he your bill for L 700?' said the father, speaking very loudly\nand very angrily.\n\n'Well, I believe he has,' said Bertie; 'but all the money I ever\ngot from him was L 150.'\n\n'And what became of the L 550?'\n\n'Why, sir; the commission was L 100, or so, and I took the remainder\nin paving-stones and rocking-horses.'\n\n'Paving-stones and rocking-horses!' said the doctor, 'where are\nthey?'\n\n'Oh, sir, I suppose they are in London somewhere--but I'll inquire\nif you wish for them.'\n\n'He's an idiot,' said the doctor, 'and it's sheer folly to waste\nmore money on him. Nothing can save him from ruin,' and so saying,\nthe unhappy father walked out of the room.\n\n'Would the governor like to see the paving-stones?'\n\n'I'll tell you what,' said she. 'If you don't take care, you will\nfind yourself loose upon the world without even a house over your\nhead: you don't know him as well as I do. He's very angry.'\n\nBertie stroked his big beard, sipped his tea, chatted over his\nmisfortunes in a half comic, half serious tone, and ended by\npromising his sister that he would do his very best to make himself\nagreeable to the widow Bold. Then Charlotte followed her father to\nhis own room and softened down his wrath, and persuaded him to say\nnothing more about the Jew bill discounter, at any rate for a few\nweeks. He even went so far as to say he would pay the L 700, or at\nany rate settle the bill, if he saw a certainty of his son's\nsecuring for himself anything like a decent provision in life.\nNothing was said openly between them about poor Eleanor: but the\nfather and the daughter understood each other.\n\nThey all met together in the drawing-room at nine o'clock, in\nperfect good humour with each other; and about that hour Mrs Bold\nwas announced. She had never been in the house before, though she\nhad of course called: and now she felt it strange to find herself\nthere in her usual evening dress, entering the drawing-room of\nthese strangers in this friendly unceremonious way, as though she\nhad known them all her life. But in three minutes they made her at\nhome. Charlotte tripped downstairs and took her bonnet from her,\nand Bertie came to relieve her from her shawl, and the signora\nsmiled on her as she could smile when she chose to be gracious, and\nthe old doctor shook hands with her in a kind and benedictory\nmanner that went to her heart at once, and made her feel that he\nmust be a good man.\n\nShe had not been seated for above five minutes when the door again\nopened, and Mr Slope was announced. She felt rather surprised,\nbecause she was told that nobody was to be there, and it was very\nevident from the manner of some of them that Mr Slope was\nunexpected. But still there was not much in it. In such invitations\na bachelor or two more or less are always spoken of as nobodies,\nand there was no reason why Mr Slope should not drink tea at Dr\nStanhope's as well as Eleanor herself. He, however, was very much\nsurprised and not very much gratified at finding that his own\nembryo spouse made one of the party. He had come there to gratify\nhimself by gazing on Madame Neroni's beauty, and listening to and\nreturning her flattery: and though he had not owned as much to\nhimself, he still felt that if he spent the evening as he had\nintended to do, he might probably not thereby advance his suit with\nMrs Bold.\n\nThe signora, who had no idea of a rival, received Mr Slope with her\nusual marks of distinction. As he took her hand, she made some\nconfidential communication to him in a low voice, declaring that\nshe had a plan to communicate to him after tea, and was evidently\nprepared to go on with her work of reducing the chaplain to a state\nof captivity. Poor Mr Slope was rather beside himself. He thought\nthat Eleanor could not but have learnt from his demeanour that he\nwas an admirer of her own, and he had also flattered himself that\nthe idea was not unacceptable to her. What would she think of him\nif he now devoted himself to a married woman?\n\nBut Eleanor was not inclined to be severe in her criticism on him\nin that respect, and felt no annoyance of any kind, when she found\nherself seated between Bertie and Charlotte Stanhope. She had not\nsuspicion of Mr Slope's intentions; she had no suspicion even of\nthe suspicion of other people; but still she felt well pleased not\nto have Mr Slope too near to her.\n\nAnd she was not ill-pleased to have Bertie Stanhope near her. It\nwas rarely indeed that he failed to make an agreeable impression on\nstrangers. With a bishop indeed who thought much of his own dignity\nit was possible that he might fail, but hardly with a young lady\nand pretty woman. He possessed the tact of becoming instantly\nintimate with women without giving rise to any fear of\nimpertinence. He had about him somewhat of the propensities of a\ntame cat. It seemed quite natural that he should be petted,\ncaressed, and treated with familiar good nature, and that in return\nhe should purr, and be sleek and graceful, and above all never show\nhis claws. Like other tame cats, however, he had his claws, and\nsometimes, made them dangerous.\n\nWhen tea was over Charlotte went to the open window and declared\nloudly that the full harvest moon was much too beautiful to be\ndisregarded, and called them to look at it. To tell the truth,\nthere was but one there who cared much about the moon's beauty, and\nthat one was not Charlotte; but she knew how valuable an aid to her\npurpose the chaste goddess might become, and could easily create a\nlittle enthusiasm for the purpose of the moment. Eleanor and Bertie\nwere soon with her. The doctor was now quiet in his arm- chair, and\nMrs Stanhope in hers, both prepared for slumber.\n\n'Are you a Whewellite or a Brewsterite, or a t'othermanite, Mrs\nBold?' said Charlotte, who knew a little about everything, and had\nread about a third of each of the books to which she alluded.\n\n'Oh!' said Eleanor; 'I have not read any of the books, but I feel\nsure that there is one man in the moon at least, if not more.'\n\n'You don't believe in the pulpy gelatinous matter?' said Bertie.\n\n'I heard about that,' said Eleanor; 'and I really think it's almost\nwicked to talk in such a manner. How can we argue about God's power\nin the other stars from the laws which he has given for our role in\nthis one?'\n\n'How indeed!' said Bertie. 'Why shouldn't there be a race of\nsalamanders in Venus? And even if there be nothing but fish in\nJupiter, why shouldn't the fish there be as wide awake as the men\nand women here?'\n\n'That would be saying very little for them,' said Charlotte. 'I am\nfor Dr Whewell myself; for I do not think that men and woman are\nworth being repeated in such countless worlds. There may be souls\nin other stars, but I doubt their having any bodies attached to\nthem. But come, Mrs Bold, let us put our bonnets on and walk round\nthe close. If we are to discuss sidereal questions, we shall do so\nmuch better under the towers of the cathedral, than stuck in this\nnarrow window.\n\nMrs Bold made no objection, and a party was made to walk out.\nCharlotte Stanhope well knew the rule as to three being no company,\nand she had therefore to induce her sister to allow Mr Slope to\naccompany them.\n\n'Come, Mr Slope,' she said; 'I'm sure you'll join us. We shall be\nin again in quarter of an hour, Madeline.'\n\nMadeline read in her eye all that she had to say, knew her object,\nand as she had to depend on her sister for so many of her\namusements, she felt that she must yield. It was hard to be left\nalone while others of her own age walked out to feel the soft\ninfluence of the bright night, but it would be harder still without\nthe sort of sanction which Charlotte gave to all her flirtations\nand intrigues. Charlotte's eye told her that she must give up just\nat present for the good of the family, and so Madeline obeyed.\n\nBut Charlotte's eyes said nothing of the sort to Mr Slope. He had\nno objection at all to the tete-a-tete with the signora, which the\ndeparture of the other three would allow him, and gently whispered\nto her, 'I shall not leave you alone.'\n\n'Oh, yes,' said she; 'go--pray go, pray go, for my sake. Do not\nthink that I am so selfish. It is understood that nobody is kept\nwithin for me. You will understand this too when you know me\nbetter. Pray join them, Mr Slope, but when you come in speak to me\nfor five minutes before you leave us.'\n\nMr Slope understood that he was to go, and he therefore joined the\nparty in the hall. He would have had no objection at all to this\narrangement, if he could have secured Mrs Bold's arm; but this was\nof course out of the question. Indeed, his fate was very soon\nsettled, for no sooner had he reached the hall-door, than Miss\nStanhope put her hand within his arm, and Bertie walked off with\nEleanor just as naturally as though she were already his own\nproperty.\n\nAnd so they sauntered forth: first they walked round the close,\naccording to their avowed intent; then they went under the old\narched gateway below St Cuthbert's little church, and then they\nturned behind the grounds of the bishop's palace, and so on till\nthey came to the bridge just at the edge of the town, from which\npassers-by can look down into the gardens of Hiram's hospital; and\nher Charlotte and Mr Slope, who were in advance, stopped till the\nother two came up to them. Mr Slope knew that the gable-ends and\nold brick chimneys which stood up so prettily in the moonlight,\nwere those of Mr Harding's late abode, and would not have stopped\non such a spot, in such company, if he could have avoided it; but\nMiss Stanhope would not take the hint which he tried to give.\n\n'This is a very pretty place, Mrs Bold,' said Charlotte; 'by far\nthe prettiest place near Barchester. I wonder your father gave it\nup.'\n\nIt was a very pretty place, and now by the deceitful light of the\nmoon looked twice larger, twice prettier, twice more antiquely\npicturesque than it would have done in truth-telling daylight. Who\ndoes not know the air of complex multiplicity and the mysterious\ninteresting grace which the moon always lends to old gabled\nbuildings half surrounded, as was the hospital, by fine trees! As\nseen from the bridge on the night of which we are speaking, Mr\nHarding's late abode did look very lovely; and though Eleanor did\nnot grieve at her father's having left it, she felt at the moment\nan intense wish that he might be allowed to return.\n\n'He is going to return to it immediately, is he not?' asked Bertie.\n\nEleanor made no immediate reply. Much such a question passed\nunanswered, without the notice of the questioner; but such was not\nnow the case. They all remained silent as though expecting her to\nreply, and after a moment or two, Charlotte said, 'I believe it is\nsettled that Mr Harding returns to the hospital, is it not?'\n\n'I don't think anything about it is settled yet,' said Eleanor.\n\n'But it must be a matter of course,' said Bertie; 'that is, if your\nfather wishes it; who else on earth could hold it after what has\noccurred?'\n\nEleanor quietly made her companion to understand that the matter\nwas one which she could not discuss in the present company; and\nthen they passed on; Charlotte said she would go a short way up the\nhill out of the town so as to look back on the towers of the\ncathedral, and as Eleanor leant upon Bertie's arm for assistance in\nthe walk, she told him how the matter stood between her father and\nthe bishop.\n\n'And, he,' said Bertie, pointing on to Mr Slope, 'what part does he\ntake in it?'\n\nEleanor explained how Mr Slope had at first endeavoured to\ntyrannize over her father, but how he had latterly come round, and\ndone all he could to talk the bishop over in Mr Harding's favour.\n'But my father,' said she, 'is hardly inclined to trust him; they\nall say he is so arrogant to the old clergyman of the city.'\n\n'Take my word for it,' said Bertie, 'your father is right. If I am\nnot very much mistaken, that man is both arrogant and false.'\n\nThey strolled up the top of the hill, and then returned through the\nfields by a footpath which leads by a small wooden bridge, or\nrather a plank with a rustic rail to it, over the river to the\nother side of the cathedral from that at which they had started.\nThey had thus walked round the bishop's grounds, through which the\nriver runs, and round the cathedral and adjacent fields, and it was\npast eleven before they reached the doctor's door.\n\n'It is very late,' said Eleanor, 'it will be a shame to disturb\nyour mother at such an hour.'\n\n'Oh,' said Charlotte, laughing, 'you won't disturb mamma; I dare\nsay she is in bed by this time, and Madeline would be furious if\nyou do not come in and see her. Come, Bertie, take Mrs Bold's\nbonnet from her.'\n\nThey went up stairs, and found the signora alone, reading. She\nlooked somewhat sad and melancholy, but not more so perhaps than\nwas sufficient to excite additional interest in the bosom of Mr\nSlope; and she was soon deep in whispered intercourse with that\nhappy gentleman, who was allowed to find a resting-place on her\nsofa. The signora had a way of whispering that was peculiarly her\nown, and was exactly the reverse of that which prevails among great\ntragedians. The great tragedian hisses out a positive whisper, made\nwith bated breath, and produced by inarticulate tongue-formed\nsounds, but yet he is audible through the whole house. The signora\nhowever used no hisses, and produced all her words in a clear\nsilver tone, but they could only be heard by the ear into which\nthey were poured.\n\nCharlotte hurried and skurried about the room hither and thither,\ndoing, or pretending to do many things; and then saying something\nabout seeing her mother, ran up stairs. Eleanor was then left alone\nwith Bertie, and she hardly felt and hour fly by her. To give\nBertie his due credit, he could not have played his cards better.\nHe did not make love to her, nor sigh, nor look languishing; but he\nwas amusing and familiar, yet respectful; and when he left Eleanor\nat her own door at one o'clock, which he did by the bye with the\nassistance of the now jealous Slope, she thought he was one of the\nmost agreeable men, and the Stanhopes decidedly the most agreeable\nfamily, that she had ever met.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nMR ARABIN\n\nThe Reverend Francis Arabin, fellow of Lazarus, late professor of\npoetry at Oxford, and present vicar of St Ewold, in the diocese of\nBarchester, must now be introduced personally to the reader. And as\nhe will fill a conspicuous place in this volume, it is desirable\nthat he should be made to stand before the reader's eye by the aid\nof such portraiture as the author is able to produce.\n\nIt is to be regretted that no mental method of daguerreotype or\nphotography has yet been discovered, by which the characters of men\ncan be reduced to writing and put into grammatical language with an\nunerring precision of truthful description. How often does the\nnovelist feel, ay, and the historian also and the biographer, that\nhe has conceived within his mind and accurately depicted on the\ntablet of his brain the full character and personage of a man, and\nthat nevertheless, when he flies to pen and ink to perpetuate the\nportrait, his words forsake, elude, disappoint, and play the deuce\nwith him, till at the end of a dozen pages the man described has no\nmore resemblance to the man conceived than the sign board at the\ncorner of the street has to the Duke of Cambridge?\n\nAnd yet such mechanical descriptive skill would hardly give more\nsatisfaction to the reader than the skill of the photographer does\nto the anxious mother desirous to possess an absolute duplicate of\nher beloved child. The likeness is indeed true; but it is a dull,\ndead, unfeeling, inauspicious likeness. The face is indeed there,\nand those looking at it will know at once whose image it is; but\nthe owner of the face will not be proud of the resemblance.\n\nThere is no royal road to learning; no short cut to the acquirement\nof any art. Let photographers and daguerreotypers do what they\nwill, and improve as they may with further skill on that which\nskill has already done, they will never achieve a portrait of the\nhuman face as we may under the burdens which we so often feel too\nheavy for our shoulders; we must either bear them up like men, or\nown ourselves too weak for the work we have undertaken. There is no\nway of writing well and also of writing easily.\n\nLabor omnia vincit improbus. Such should be the chosen motto of\nevery labourer, and it may be that labour, if adequately enduring,\nmay suffice at last to produce even some not untrue resemblance of\nthe Rev. Francis Arabin.\n\nOf his doings in the world, and of the sort of fame which he has\nachieved, enough has already been said. It has also been said that\nhe is forty years of age, and still unmarried. He was the younger\nson of a country gentleman of small fortune in the north of\nEngland. At an early age he went to Winchester, and was intended by\nhis father for New College; but though studious as a boy, he was\nnot studious within the prescribed limits; and at the age of\neighteen he left school with a character for talent, but without a\nscholarship. All that he had obtained, over and above the advantage\nof his character, was a gold medal for English verse, and hence was\nderived a strong presumption on the part of his friends that he was\ndestined to add another name to the imperishable list of English\npoets.\n\nFrom Winchester he went to Oxford, and was entered as a commoner at\nBalliol. Here his special career very soon commenced. He utterly\neschewed the society of fast men, gave no wine parties, kept no\nhorses, rowed no boats, joined no rows, and was the pride of his\ncollege tutor. Such at least was his career till he had taken his\nlittle go; and then he commenced a course of action which, though\nnot less creditable to himself as a man, was hardly so much to the\ntaste of his tutor. He became a member of a vigorous debating\nsociety, and rendered himself remarkable there for humorous energy.\nThough always in earnest, yet his earnestness was always droll. To\nbe true in his ideas, unanswerable in his syllogisms, and just in\nhis aspirations was not enough for him. He had failed, failed in\nhis own opinion as well as that of others when others came to know\nhim, if he could not reduce the arguments of his opponents to an\nabsurdity, and conquer both by wit and reason. To say that his\nobject was ever to raise a laugh, would be most untrue. He hated\nsuch common and unnecessary evidence of satisfaction on the part of\nhis hearers. A joke that required to be laughed at was, with him,\nnot worth uttering. He could appreciate by a keener sense than that\nof his ears the success of his wit, and would see in the eyes of\nhis auditory whether or no he was understood and appreciated.\n\nHe had been a religious lad before he left school. That is, he had\naddicted himself to a party of religion, and having done so had\nreceived that benefit which most men do who become partisans in\nsuch a cause. We are much too apt to look at schism in our church\nas an unmitigated evil. Moderate schism, if there may be such a\nthing, at any rate calls attention to the subject, draws its\nsupporters who would otherwise have been inattentive to the matter,\nand teaches men to think about religion. How great an amount of\ngood of this description has followed that movement of the Church\nof England which commenced with the publication of Froude's\nRemains!\n\nAs a boy young Arabin took up the cudgels on the side of the\nTractarians, and at Oxford he sat for a while at the feet of the\ngreat Newman. To this cause he lent all his faculties. For it he\nconcocted verses, for it he made speeches, for it he scintillated\nthe brightest sparks of his quiet wit. For it he ate and drank and\ndressed, and had his being. In due process of time he took his\ndegree, and wrote himself B.A., but he did not do so with any\nremarkable amount of academical eclat. He had occupied himself too\nmuch with high church matters, and the polemics, politics, and\noutward demonstrations usually concurrent with high churchmanship,\nto devote himself with sufficient vigour to the acquisition of a\ndouble first. He was not a double first, nor even a first class\nman; but he revenged himself on the university by putting first and\ndouble firsts out of fashion for the year, and laughing down a\nspecies of pedantry which at the age of twenty-three leaves no room\nin a man's mind for graver subjects than conic sections or Greek\naccents.\n\nGreek accents, however, and conic sections were esteemed\nnecessaries at Balliol, and there was no admittance there for Mr\nArabin within the list of its fellows. Lazarus, however, the\nrichest and the most comfortable abode of Oxford dons, opened its\nbosom to the young champion of a church militant. Mr Arabin was\nordained, and became a fellow soon after taking his degree, and\nshortly after that was chosen professor of poetry.\n\nAnd now came the moment of his great danger. After many mental\nstruggles, and an agony of doubt which may be well surmised, the\ngreat prophet of the Tractarians confessed himself a Roman\nCatholic. Mr Newman left the Church of England, and with him\ncarried many a waverer. He did not carry off Mr Arabin, but the\nescape which that gentleman had was a very narrow one. He left\nOxford for a while that he might meditate in complete peace on the\nstep which appeared for him to be all but unavoidable, and shut\nhimself up in a little village on the sea-shore of one of our\nremotest counties, that he might learn by communing with his own\nsoul whether or no he could with a safe conscience remain within\nthe pale of his mother church.\n\nThings would have gone badly with him there had he been left\nentirely to himself. Every thing was against him: all his worldly\ninterests required him to remain a Protestant; and he looked on his\nworldly interests as a legion of foes, to get the better of whom\nwas a point of extremest honour. In his then state of ecstatic\nagony such a conquest would have cost him little; but it cost him\nmuch to get over the idea of choosing the Church of England he\nshould be open in his own mind to the charge that he had been led\nto such a choice by unworthy motives. Then his heart was against\nhim: he loved with a strong and eager love the man who had hitherto\nbeen his guide, and yearned to follow his footsteps. His tastes\nwere against him: the ceremonies and pomps of the Church of Rome,\ntheir august feasts and solemn fasts, invited his imagination and\npleased his eye. His flesh was against him: how great an aid would\nit be to a poor, weak, wavering man to be constrained to high moral\nduties, self-denial, obedience, and chastity by laws which were\ncertain in their enactments, and not to be broken without loud,\npalpable, unmistakable sin! Then his faith was against him: he\nrequired to believe so much; panted so early to give signs of his\nbelief; deemed it so insufficient to wash himself simply in the\nwaters of Jordan; that some great deed, such as that of forsaking\neverything for a true church, had for him allurements almost past\nwithstanding.\n\nMr Arabin was at this time a very young man, and when he left\nOxford for his far retreat was much too confident in his powers of\nfence, and too apt to look down on the ordinary sense of ordinary\npeople, to expect aid in the battle that he had to fight from any\nchance inhabitants on the spot which he had selected. But\nProvidence was good to him; and there, in that all but desolate\nplace, on the storm-beat shore of that distant sea, he met one who\ngradually changed his mind, quieted his imagination, and taught him\nsomething of a Christian's duty. When Mr Arabin left Oxford, he was\ninclined to look upon the rural clergymen of most English parishes\nalmost with contempt. It was his ambition, should he remain within\nthe fold of the church, to do somewhat towards redeeming and\nrectifying their inferiority, and to assist in infusing energy and\nfaith into the hearts of Christian ministers, who were, as he\nthought, too often satisfied to go through life without much show\nof either.\n\nAnd yet it was from such a one that Mr Arabin in his extremest need\nreceived that aid which he so much required. It was from a poor\ncurate of a small Cornish parish that he first learnt to know that\nthe highest laws for the governance of a Christian's duty must act\nfrom within and not from without; that no man can become a\nserviceable servant solely by obedience to written edicts; and that\nthe safety which he was about to seek within the gates of Rome was\nno other than the selfish freedom from personal danger which the\nbad soldier attempts to gain who counterfeits illness on the eve of\nbattle.\n\nMr Arabin returned to Oxford a humbler but a better and a happier\nman; and from that time forth he put his shoulder to the wheel as a\nclergyman of the Church for which he had been educated. The\nintercourse of those among whom he familiarly lived kept him\nstaunch to the principles of that system of the Church to which he\nhad always belonged. Since his severance from Mr Newman, no one had\nhad so strong an influence over him as the head of his college.\nDuring the time of his expected apostasy, Dr Gwynne had not felt\nmuch predisposition in favour of the young fellow. Though a High\nChurchman himself within moderate limits, Dr Gwynne felt no\nsympathy with men who could not satisfy their faiths with the\nThirty-nine Articles. He regarded the enthusiasm of such as Newman\nas a state of mind more nearly allied to madness than to religion;\nand when he saw it evinced by a very young men, was inclined to\nattribute a good deal of it to vanity. Dr Gwynne himself, though a\nreligious man, was also a thoroughly practical man of the world,\nand he regarded with no favourable eye the tenets of any one who\nlooked on the two things as incompatible. When he found Mr Arabin\nwas a half Roman, he began to regret all that he done towards\nbestowing a fellowship on so unworthy a recipient; and when again\nhe learnt that Mr Arabin would probably complete his journey to\nRome, he regarded with some satisfaction the fact that in such case\nthe fellowship would be again vacant.\n\nWhen, however, Mr Arabin returned and professed himself a confirmed\nProtestant, the master of Lazarus again opened his arms to him, and\ngradually he became the pet of the college. For some little time he\nwas saturnine, silent, and unwilling to take any prominent part in\nuniversity broils; but gradually his mind recovered, or rather made\nits tone, and he became known as a man always ready at a moment's\nnotice to take up the cudgels in opposition to anything which\nsavoured of an evangelical bearing. He was great in sermons, great\non platforms, great at after dinner conversations, and always\npleasant as well as great. He took delight in elections, served on\ncommittees, opposed tooth and nail all projects of university\nreform, and talked jovially over his glass of port of the ruin to\nbe committed by the Whigs. The ordeal through which he had gone, in\nresisting the blandishments of the lady of Rome, had certainly done\nmuch towards the strengthening of his character. Although in small\nand outward matters he was self-confident enough, nevertheless in\nthings affecting the inner man he aimed at a humility of spirit\nwhich would never have been attractive to him but for that visit to\nthe coast of Cornwall. This visit he now repeated every year.\n\nSuch is an interior view of Mr Arabin at the time when he accepted\nthe living of St Ewold. Exteriorly, he was not a remarkable person.\nHe was above the middle height, well made, and very active. His\nhair which had been jet black, was now tinged with gray, but his\nface bore no sign of years. It would perhaps be wrong to say that\nhe was handsome, but his face was, nevertheless, high for beauty,\nand the formation of the forehead too massive and heavy: but his\neyes, nose and mouth were perfect. There was a continual play of\nlambent fire about his eyes, which gave promise of either pathos or\nhumour whenever he essayed to speak, and that promise was rarely\nbroken. There was a gentle play about his mouth which declared that\nhis wit never descended to sarcasm, and that there was no\nill-nature in his repartee.\n\nMr Arabin was a popular man among women, but more so as a general\nthan a special favourite. Living as a fellow at Oxford, marriage\nwith him had been out of the question, and it may be doubted\nwhether he had ever allowed his heart to be touched. Though\nbelonging to a Church in which celibacy is not the required lot of\nits ministers, he had come to regard himself as one of those\nclergymen to whom to be a bachelor is almost a necessity. He had\nnever looked for parochial duty, and his career at Oxford was\nutterly incompatible with such domestic joys as a wife and nursery.\nHe looked on women, therefore, in the same light that one sees then\nregarded by many Romish priests. He liked to have near him that\nwhich was pretty and amusing, but women generally were little more\nto him than children. He talked to them without putting out all his\npowers, and listened to them without any idea that what he should\nhear from them could either actuate his conduct or influence his\nopinion.\n\nSuch was Mr Arabin, the new vicar of St Ewold, who is going to stay\nwith the Grantlys, at Plumstead Episcopi.\n\nMr Arabin reached Plumstead the day before Mr Harding and Eleanor,\nand the Grantly family were thus enabled to make his acquaintance\nand discuss his qualifications before the arrival of the other\nguests. Griselda was surprised to find that he looked so young; but\nshe told Florinda her younger sister, when they had retired for the\nnight, that he did not talk at all like a young man: and she\ndecided with the authority that seventeen has over sixteen, that he\nwas not at all nice, although his eyes were lovely. As usual,\nsixteen implicitly acceded to the dictum of seventeen in such a\nmatter, and said that he certainly was not nice. They then branched\noff on the relative merits of other clerical bachelors in the\nvicinity, and both determined without any feeling of jealousy\nbetween them that a certain Rev. Augustus Green was by many degrees\nthe most estimable of the lot. The gentleman in question had\ncertainly much in his favour, as, having a comfortable allowance\nfrom his father, he could devote the whole proceeds of his curacy\nto violet gloves and unexceptionable neck ties. Having thus fixedly\nresolved that the new comer had nothing about him to shake the\npre-eminence of the exalted Green, the two girls went to sleep in\neach other's arms, contented with themselves and the world.\n\nMrs Grantly at first sight came to much the same conclusion about\nher husband's favourite as her daughters had done, though, in\nseeking to measure his relative value, she did not compare him to\nMr Green; indeed, she made no comparison by name between him and\nany one else; but she remarked to her husband that one person's\nswans were very often another person's geese, thereby clearly\nshowing that Mr Arabin had not yet proved his qualifications in\nswanhood to her satisfaction.\n\n'Well, Susan,' said he, rather offended at hearing his friend\nspoken of so disrespectfully, 'if you take Mr Arabin for a goose, I\ncannot say that I think very highly of your discrimination.'\n\n'A goose! No of course, he's not a goose. I've no doubt he's a very\nclever man. But you're so matter-of-fact, archdeacon, when it suits\nyour purpose, that one can't trust oneself to any facon de parler.\nI've no doubt Mr Arabin is a very valuable man--at Oxford, and that\nhe'll be a good vicar at St Ewold. All I mean is, that having\npassed one evening with him, I don't find him to be absolutely a\nparagon. In the first place, if I am not mistaken, he is a little\ninclined to be conceited.'\n\n'Of all the men that I know intimately,' said the archdeacon,\n'Arabin is, in my opinion, the most free from any taint of\nself-conceit. His fault is that he's too diffident.'\n\n'Perhaps so,' said the lady; 'only I must own I did not find it out\nthis evening.'\n\nNothing further was said about him. Dr Grantly thought that his\nwife was abusing Mr Arabin merely because he had praised him; and\nMrs Grantly knew that it was useless arguing for or against any\nperson in favour of, or in opposition to whom the archdeacon had\nalready pronounced a strong opinion.\n\nIn truth they were both right. Mr Arabin was a diffident man in\nsocial intercourse with those whom he did not intimately know; when\nplaced in situations which it was his business to fill, and\ndiscussing matters with which it was his duty to be conversant, Mr\nArabin was from habit brazed-faced enough. When standing on a\nplatform in Exeter Hall, no man would be less mazed than he by the\neyes of the crowd before him; for such was the work which his\nprofession had called on him to perform; but he shrank from a\nstrong expression of opinion in general society, and his doing so\nnot uncommonly made it appear that he considered the company not\nworth the trouble of his energy. He was averse to dictate when the\nplace did not seem to him to justify dictation; and as those\nsubjects on which people wished to hear him speak were such as he\nwas accustomed to treat with decision, he generally shunned the\ntraps there were laid to allure him into discussion, and, by doing\nso, not unfrequently subjected himself to such charges as those\nbrought against him by Mrs Grantly.\n\nMr Arabin, as he sat at his open window, enjoying the delicious\nmoonlight and gazing at the gray towers of the church, which stood\nalmost within the rectory grounds, little dreamed that he was the\nsubject of so many friendly or unfriendly criticisms. Considering\nhow much we are all given to discuss the characters of others, and\ndiscuss them often not in the strictest spirit of charity, it is\nsingular how little we are inclined to think that others can speak\nill-naturedly of us, and how angry and hurt we are when proof\nreaches us that they have done so. It is hardly too much to say\nthat we all of us occasionally speak of our dearest friends in a\nmanner which those dearest friends would very little like to hear\nthemselves mentioned; and that we nevertheless expect that our\ndearest friends shall invariably speak of us as though they were\nblind to all our faults, but keenly alive to every shade of our\nvirtues.\n\nIt did not occur to Mr Arabin that he was spoken of at all. It\nseemed to him, when he compared himself with his host, that he was\na person of so little consequence to any, that he was worth no\none's words or thoughts. He was utterly alone in the world as\nregarded domestic ties and those inner familiar relations which are\nhardly possible between others than husbands and wives, parents and\nchildren, or brothers and sisters. He had often discussed with\nhimself the necessity of such bonds for a man's happiness in this\nworld, and had generally satisfied himself with the answer that\nhappiness in this world was not a necessity. Herein he deceived\nhimself, or rather tried to do so. He, like others, yearned for the\nenjoyment of whatever he saw enjoyable; and though he attempted,\nwith the modern stoicism of so many Christians, to make himself\nbelieve that joy and sorrow were matters which here should be held\nas perfectly indifferent, those things were not indifferent to him.\nHe was tired of his Oxford rooms and his college life. He regarded\nthe wife and children of his friend with something like envy; he\nall but coveted the pleasant drawing-room, with its pretty windows\nopening on to lawns and flower-beds, the apparel of the comfortable\nhouse, and--above all--the air of home which encompassed all.\n\nIt will be said that no time can have been fitted for such desires\non his part as this, of a living among fields and gardens, of a\nhouse which a wife would grace. It is true there was a difference\nbetween the opulence of Plumstead and the modest economy of St\nEwold; but surely Mr Arabin was not a man to sigh after wealth! Of\nall men, his friends would have unanimously declared he was the\nlast to do so. But how little our friends know us! In his period of\nstoical rejection of this world's happiness, he had cast from him\nas utter dross all anxiety as to fortune. He had, as it were,\nproclaimed himself to be indifferent to promotion, and those who\nchiefly admired his talents, and would mainly have exerted to\nsecure them their deserved reward, had taken him at his word. And\nnow, if the truth must out, he felt himself\ndisappointed--disappointed not by them but by himself. The daydream\nof his youth was over, and at the age of forty he felt that he was\nnot fit to work in the spirit of an apostle. He had mistaken\nhimself, and learned his mistake when it was past remedy. He had\nprofessed himself indifferent to mitres and diaconal residences, to\nrich livings and pleasant glebes, and now he had to own to himself\nthat he was sighing for the good things of other men, on whom in\nhis pride he had ventured to look down.\n\nNot for wealth, in its vulgar sense, had he ever sighed; not for\nthe enjoyment of rich things had he ever longed; but for the\nallotted share of worldly bliss, which a wife, and children, and\nhappy home could give him, for that usual amount of comfort which\nhe had ventured to reject as unnecessary for him, he did now feel\nthat he would have been wiser to search.\n\nHe knew that his talents, his position, and his friends would have\nwon for him promotion, had he put himself in the way of winning it.\nInstead of doing so, he had allowed himself an income of some L 300\na year, should he, by marrying, throw up his fellowship. Such, at\nthe age of forty, was the worldly result of labour, which the world\nhad chosen to regard as successful. The world also thought that Mr\nArabin was, in his own estimation, sufficiently paid. Alas! alas!\nthe world was mistaken; and Mr Arabin was beginning to ascertain\nthat such was the case.\n\nAnd here, may I beg the reader not to be hard in the judgement upon\nthis man. Is not the state at which he has arrived, the natural\nresult of efforts to reach that which is not the condition of\nhumanity? Is not modern stoicism, built though it be on\nChristianity, as great an outrage on human nature as was the\nstoicism of the ancients? The philosophy of Zeno was built on true\nlaws, but on true laws misunderstood, and therefore misapplied. It\nis the same with our Stoics here, who would teach us that wealth\nand worldly comfort and happiness on earth are not worth the\nsearch. Also, for a doctrine which can find no believing pupils and\nno true teachers!\n\nThe case of Mr Arabin was the more singular, as he belonged to a\nbranch of the Church of England well inclined to regard its\ntemporalities with avowed favour, and had habitually lived with men\nwho were accustomed to much worldly comfort. But such was his\nidiosyncrasy, that these very facts had produced within him, in\nearly life, a state of mind that was not natural to him. He was\ncontent to be a High Churchman, if he could be so on principles of\nhis own, and could strike out a course showing a marked difference\nfrom those with whom he consorted. He was ready to be a partisan as\nlong as he was allowed to have a course of action and of thought\nunlike that of his party. His party had indulged him, and he began\nto feel that his party was right and himself wrong, but when such a\nconviction was too late to be of service to him. He discovered,\nwhen much was discovery was no longer serviceable, that it would\nhave been worth his while to have worked for the usual pay assigned\nto work in this world, and have earned a wife and children, with a\ncarriage for them to sit in; to have earned a pleasant dining-room,\nin which his friends could drink his wine, and the power of walking\nup in the high street of his country town, with the knowledge that\nall its tradesmen would have gladly welcomed him within their\ndoors. Other men arrived at those convictions in their start of\nlife, and so worked up to them. To him they had come when they were\ntoo late to be of use.\n\nIt has been said that Mr Arabin was a man of pleasantry and it may\nbe thought that such a state of mind as that described, would be\nantagonistic to humour. But surely such is not the case. Wit is the\noutward mental casing of the man, and has no more to do with the\ninner mind of thought and feelings than have the rich brocaded\ngarments of the priest at the altar with the asceticism of the\nanchorite below them, whose skin is tormented with sackcloth, and\nwhose body is half flayed with rods. Nay, will not such a one often\nrejoice more than any other in the rich show of outer apparel? Will\nit not be food for his pride to feel that he groans inwardly, while\nhe shines outwardly? So it is with the mental efforts which men\nmake. Those which they show forth daily to the world are often the\nopposites of the inner workings of the spirit.\n\nIn the archdeacon's drawing-room, Mr Arabin had sparkled with his\nusual unaffected brilliancy, but when he retired to his bed-room,\nhe sat there sad, at his open window, repining within himself that\nhe also had no wife, no bairns, no soft award of lawn duly mown for\nhim to be on, no herd of attendant curates, no bowings from the\nbanker's clerks, no rich rectory. That apostleship that he had\nthought of had evaded his grasp, and he was now only vicar of St\nEwold's, with a taste for a mitre. Truly he had fallen between two\nstools.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nST EWOLD'S PARSONAGE\n\nWhen Mr Harding and Mrs Bold reached the rectory on the following\nmorning, the archdeacon and his friend were at St Ewold's. They had\ngone over that the new vicar might inspect his church, and be\nintroduced to the squire, and were not expected back before dinner.\nMr Harding rambled out by himself, and strolled, as was his wont at\nPlumstead, about the lawn and round the church; and as he did so,\nthe two sisters naturally fell into conversation about Barchester.\n\nThere was not much sisterly confidence between them. Mrs Grantly\nwas ten years older than Eleanor, and had been married while\nEleanor was yet a child. They had never, therefore, poured into\neach other's ears their hopes and loves; and now that one was a\nwife and the other a widow, it was not probable that they would\nbegin to do so. They lived too much asunder to be able to fall into\nthat kind of intercourse which makes confidence between sisters\nalmost a necessity; and, moreover, that which is so easy at\neighteen is often very difficult at twenty-eight. Mrs Grantly knew\nthis, and did not, therefore, expect confidence from her sister;\nand yet she longed to ask her whether in real truth Mr Slope was\nagreeable to her.\n\nIt was by no means difficult to turn the conversation to Mr Slope.\nThat gentleman had become so famous at Barchester, had so much to\ndo with all clergymen connected with the city, and was so specially\nconcerned in the affairs of Mr Harding, that it would have been odd\nif Mr Harding's daughters had not talked about him. Mrs Grantly was\nsoon abusing him, which she did with her whole heart; and Mrs Bold\nwas nearly as eager to defend him. She positively disliked the man,\nwould have been delighted to learn that he had taken himself off so\nthat she should never see him again, had indeed almost a fear of\nhim, and yet she constantly found herself taking his part. The\nabuse of other people, and abuse of a nature that she felt to be\nunjust, imposed that necessity on her, and at last made Mr Slope's\ndefence an habitual course of argument with her.\n\nFrom Mr Slope the conversation turned to the Stanhopes, and Mrs\nGrantly was listening with some interest to Eleanor's account of\nthe family, when it dropped out that Mr Slope was one of the party.\n\n'What!' said the lady of the rectory, 'was Mr Slope there too?'\n\nEleanor merely replied that such had been the case.\n\n'Why, Eleanor, he must be very fond of you, I think; he seems to\nfollow you everywhere.'\n\nEven this did not open Eleanor's eyes. She merely laughed, and said\nthat she imagined Mr Slope found other attraction at Dr Stanhope's.\nAnd so they parted. Mrs Grantly felt quite convinced that the\nodious match would take place; and Mrs Bold as convinced that that\nunfortunate chaplain, disagreeable as he must be allowed to be, was\nmore sinned against than sinning.\n\nThe archdeacon of course heard before dinner that Eleanor had\nremained the day before at Barchester with the view of meeting Mr\nSlope, and that she had so met him. He remembered how she had\npositively stated that there were to be guests at the Stanhopes,\nand he did not hesitate to accuse her of deceit. Moreover, the\nfact, or rather the presumed fact, of her being deceitful on such a\nmatter, spoke but too plainly in evidence against her as to her\nimputed crime of receiving Mr Slope as a lover.\n\n'I am afraid that anything we can do will be too late,' said the\narchdeacon. 'I own I am fairly surprised. I never liked your\nsister's taste with regard to men; but still I did not give her\ncredit for--ugh!'\n\n'And so soon, too,' said Mrs Grantly, who thought more, perhaps, of\nher sister's indecorum in having a lover before she had put off her\nweeds, than her bad taste in having such a lover as Mr Slope.\n\n'Well, my dear, I shall be sorry to be harsh, or to do anything\nthat can hurt your father; but, positively, neither that man nor\nhis wife shall come within my doors.'\n\nMrs Grantly sighed, and then attempted to console herself and her\nlord by remarking that, after all, the thing was not accomplished\nyet. Now that Eleanor was at Plumstead, much might be done to wean\nher from her fatal passion. Poor Eleanor!\n\nThe evening passed off without anything to make it remarkable. Mr\nArabin discussed the parish of St Ewold with the archdeacon, and\nMrs Grantly and Mr Harding, who knew the parsonages of the parish,\njoined in. Eleanor also knew them, but spoke little. Mr Arabin did\nnot apparently take much notice of her, and she was not in a humour\nto receive at that time with any special grace any special\nfavourite of her brother-in-law. Her first idea on reaching her\nbedroom was that a much more pleasant family party might be met at\nDr Stanhope's than at the rectory. She began to think that she was\ngetting tired of clergymen and their respectable humdrum wearisome\nmode of living, and that after all, people in the outer world, who\nhad lived in Italy, London, or elsewhere, need not necessarily be\nregarded as atrocious and abominable. The Stanhopes, she had\nthought, were a giddy, thoughtless, extravagant set of people; but\nshe had seen nothing wrong about them, and had, on the other hand,\nfound that they thoroughly knew how to make their house agreeable.\nIt was a thousand pities, she thought, that the archdeacon should\nnot have a little of the same savoir vivre. Mr Arabin, as we have\nsaid, did not apparently take much notice of her; but yet he did\nnot go to bed without feeling that he had been in company with a\nvery pretty woman; and as is the case with most bachelors, and some\nmarried men, regarded the prospect of his month's visit at\nPlumstead in a pleasanter light, when he learnt that a very pretty\nwoman was to share it with him.\n\nBefore they all retired it was settled that the whole party should\ndrive over on the following day to inspect the parsonage at St\nEwold. The three clergymen were to discuss dilapidations, and the\ntwo ladies were to lend their assistance in suggesting such changes\nas might be necessary for a bachelor's abode. Accordingly, soon\nafter breakfast, the carriage was at the door. There was only room\nfor four inside, and the archdeacon got upon the box. Eleanor found\nherself opposite to Mr Arabin, and was, therefore, in a manner\nforced into conversation with him. They were soon on comfortable\nterms together; and had she thought about it, she would have\nthought that, in spite of his black cloth, Mr Arabin would not have\nbeen a bad addition to the Stanhope family party.\n\nNow that the archdeacon was away, they could all trifle. Mr Harding\nbegan by telling them in the most innocent manner imaginable an old\nlegend about Mr Arabin's new parish. There was, he said, in days of\nyore, an illustrious priestess of St Ewold, famed through the whole\ncountry for curing all manner of diseases. She had a well, as all\npriestesses have ever had, which well was extant to this day, and\nshared in the minds of many of the people the sanctity which\nbelonged to the consecrated grounds of the parish church. Mr Arabin\ndeclared that he should look on such tenets on the part of the\nparishioners as anything but orthodox. And Mrs Grantly replied\nthat she so entirely disagreed with him as to think that no parish\nwas in a proper estate that had not its priestess as well as its\npriest. 'The duties are never well done,' said she, 'unless they\nare so divided.'\n\n'I suppose, papa,' said Eleanor, 'that in the oldest times the\npriestess bore all the sway herself. Mr Arabin, perhaps, thinks\nthat such might be too much the case now if a sacred lady were\nadmitted within the parish.'\n\n'I think, at any rate,' said he, 'that it is safer to run no such\nrisk. No priestly pride has ever exceeded that of sacerdotal\nfemales. A very lowly curate, I might, perhaps, essay to rule; but\na curatess would be sure to get the better of me.'\n\n'There are certainly examples of such accidents happening,' said\nMrs Grantly. 'They do say that there is a priestess at Barchester\nwho is very imperious in all things touching the altar. Perhaps the\nfear of such a fate as that is before your eyes.'\n\nWhen they were joined by the archdeacon on the gravel before the\nvicarage, they descended again to grave dullness. Not that\nArchdeacon Grantly was a dull man; but his frolic humours were of a\ncumbrous kind; and his wit, when he was witty, did not generally\nextend itself to his auditory. On the present occasion, he was soon\nmaking speeches about wounded roofs and walls, which he declared to\nbe in want of some surgeon's art. There was not a partition that he\ndid not tap, nor a block of chimneys that he did not narrowly\nexamine; all water-pipes, flues, cisterns, and sewers underwent his\nexamination; and he even descended, in the care of his friend, so\nfar as to bore sundry boards in the floors with a bradawl.\n\nMr Arabin accompanied him through the rooms, trying to look wise in\nsuch domestic matters, and the other three also followed. Mrs\nGrantly showed that she herself had not been priestess of a parish\ntwenty years for nothing, and examined the bells and window panes\nin a very knowing way.\n\n'You will, at any rate, have a beautiful prospect out of your own\nwindow, if this is to be your private sanctum,' said Eleanor. She\nwas standing at the lattice of a little room up stairs, from which\nthe view certainly was very lovely. It was from the back of the\nvicarage, and there was nothing to interrupt the eye between the\nhouse and the glorious gray pile of the cathedral. The intermediate\nground, however, was beautifully studded with timber. In the\nimmediate foreground ran the little river which afterwards skirted\nthe city; and, just to the right of the cathedral the pointed\ngables and chimneys of Hiram's Hospital peeped out of the elms\nwhich encompass it.\n\n'Yes,' said he, joining her. 'I shall have a beautifully complete\nview of my adversaries. I shall sit down before the hostile town,\nand fire away at them at a very pleasant distance. I shall just be\nable to lodge a shot in the hospital, should the enemy ever get\npossession of it; and as for the palace, I have it within full\nrange.'\n\n'I never saw anything like you clergymen,' said Eleanor; 'you are\nalways thinking of fighting each other.'\n\n'Either that,' said he, 'or else supporting each other. The pity is\nthat we cannot do the one without the other. But are we not here to\nfight? Is not ours a church militant? What is all our work but\nfighting, and hard fighting, if it be well done?'\n\n'But not with each other.'\n\n'That's as it may be. The same complaint which you make of me for\nbattling with another clergyman of our own church, the Mahometan\nwould make against me for battling with the error of a priest of\nRome. Yet, surely, you would not be inclined to say that I should\nbe wrong to do battle with such as him. A pagan, too, with his\nmultiplicity of gods, would think it equally odd that the Christian\nand the Mahometan should disagree.'\n\n'Ah! But you wage your wars about trifles so bitterly.'\n\n'Wars about trifles,' said he, 'are always bitter, especially among\nneighbours. When the differences are great, and the parties\ncomparative strangers, men quarrel with courtesy. What combatants\nare ever so eager as two brothers?'\n\n'But do not such contentions bring scandal on the church?'\n\n'More scandal would fall on the church if there were no such\ncontentions. We have but one way to avoid them--that of\nacknowledging a common head of our church, whose word on all points\nof doctrine shall be authoritative. Such a termination of our\ndifficulties is alluring enough. It has charms which are\nirresistible to many, and all but irresistible, I own, to me.'\n\n'You speak now of the Church of Rome?' said Eleanor.\n\n'No,' said he, 'not necessarily the Church of Rome; but of a church\nwith a head. Had it pleased God to vouchsafe to us such a church\nour path would have been easy. But easy paths have not been thought\ngood for us.' He paused and stood silent for a while, thinking of\nthe time when he had so nearly sacrificed all he had, his powers of\nmind, his free agency, the fresh running waters of his mind's\nfountain, his very inner self, for an easy path in which no\nfighting would be needed; and then he continued: 'What you say is\npartly true; our contentions do bring on us some scandal. The outer\nworld, though it constantly reviles us for our human infirmities,\nand throws in our teeth the fact that being clergymen we are still\nno more then men, demands of us that we should do our work with\ngodlike perfection. There is nothing godlike about us: we differ\nfrom each other with the acerbity common to man--we allow\ndifferences on subjects of divine origin to produce among us\nantipathies and enmities which are anything but divine. This is all\ntrue. But what would you have in place of it? There is no\ninfallible head for a church on earth. This dream of believing man\nhas been tried, and we see in Italy and in Spain what has become of\nit. Grant that there are and have been no bickerings within the\npale of the Pope's Church. Such an assumption would be utterly\nuntrue; but let us grant it, and then let us say which church has\nincurred the heaviest scandals.'\n\nThere was a quiet earnestness about Mr Arabin, as he half\nacknowledged and half defended himself from the charge brought\nagainst him, which surprised Eleanor. She had been used all her\nlife to listen to clerical discussion; but the points at issue\nbetween the disputants had so seldom been of more than temporal\nsignificance as to have left on her mind no feeling of reverence\nfor such subjects. There had always been a hard worldly leaven of\nthe love either of income or power in the strains that she had\nheard; there had been no panting for the truth; no aspirations\nafter religious purity. It had always been taken for granted by\nthose around her that they were indubitably right, that there was\nno ground for doubt, that the hard uphill work of ascertaining what\nthe duty of a clergyman should be had been already accomplished in\nfull; and that what remained for an active militant parson to do,\nwas to hold his own against all comers. Her father, it is true, was\nan exception to this; but then he was so essentially non-militant\nin all things, that she classed him in her own mind apart from all\nothers. She had never argued the matter within herself, or\nconsidered whether this common tone was or was not faulty; but she\nwas sick of it without knowing that she was so. And now she found\nto her surprise and not without a certain pleasurable excitement,\nthat this new comer among them spoke in a manner very different\nfrom that to which she was accustomed.\n\n'It is so easy to condemn,' said he, continuing the thread of his\nthoughts. 'I know no life that must be so delicious as that of a\nwriter for newspapers, or a leading member of the opposition--to\nthunder forth accusations against men in power; show up the worst\nside of every thing that is produced; to pick holes in every coat;\nto be indignant, sarcastic, jocose, moral, or supercilious; to damn\nwith faint praise, or crush with open calumny! What can be so easy\nas this when the critic has to be responsible for nothing? You\ncondemn what I do; but put yourself in my position and do the\nreverse, and then see if I cannot condemn you.'\n\n'Oh! Mr Arabin, I do not condemn you.'\n\n'Pardon me, you do, Mrs Bold--you as one of the world; you are now\nthe opposition member; you are now composing your leading article,\nand well and bitterly you do it. \"Let dogs delight to bark and\nbite;\" you fitly began with an elegant quotation; \"but if we are to\nhave a church at all, in heaven's name let the pastors who preside\nover it keep their hands from each other's throats. Lawyers can\nlive without befouling each other's names; doctors do not fight\nduels. Why is that clergymen alone should indulge themselves in\nsuch unrestrained liberty of abuse against each other?\" and so you\ngo on reviling us for our ungodly quarrels, our sectarian\npropensities, and scandalous differences. It will, however, give\nyou no trouble to write another article next week in which we, or\nsome of us, shall be twitted with an unseemly apathy in matters of\nour vocation. It will not fall on you to reconcile the discrepancy;\nyour readers will never ask you how the poor parson is to be urgent\nin season and out of season, and yet never come in contact with men\nwho think widely differently from him. You, when you condemn this\nforeign treaty, or that official arrangement, will have to incur no\nblame for the graver faults of any different measure. It is so easy\nto condemn; and so pleasant too; for eulogy charms no listeners as\ndetraction does.'\n\nEleanor only half followed him in his raillery; but she caught his\nmeaning. 'I know I ought to apologise for presuming to criticise\nyou,' she said; 'but I was thinking with sorrow of the ill-will\nthat has lately come among us at Barchester, and I spoke more\nfreely than I should have done.'\n\n'Peace on earth and good-will among men, are, like heaven, promises\nfor the future;' said he, following rather his own thoughts than\nhers. 'When that prophecy is accomplished, there will no longer be\nany need for clergymen.'\n\nHere they were interrupted by the archdeacon, whose voice was heard\nfrom the cellar shouting to the vicar.\n\n'Arabin, Arabin,'--and then turning to his wife, who was apparently\nat his elbow--'where is he gone to? This cellar is perfectly\nabominable. It would be murder to put a bottle of wine into it till\nit has been roofed, walled, and floored. How on earth old\nGoodenough ever got on with it, I cannot guess. But then Goodenough\nnever had a glass of wine that any man could drink.'\n\n'What is it, archdeacon?' said the vicar, running down stairs, and\nleaving Eleanor above to her meditations.\n\n'This cellar must be roofed, walled, and floored,' repeated the\narchdeacon. 'Now mind what I say, and don't let the architect\npersuade you that it will do; half of those fellows know nothing\nabout wine. This place as it is now would be damp and cold in\nwinter, and hot and muggy in summer. I wouldn't give a straw for\nthe best wine that ever was minted, after it had lain here a couple\nof years.'\n\nMr Arabin assented, and promised that the cellar should be\nreconstructed according to the archdeacon's receipt.\n\n'And, Arabin, look here; was such an attempt at a kitchen grate\never seen?'\n\n'The grate is really very bad,' said Mrs Grantly; 'I am sure the\npriestess won't approve of it, when she is brought here to the\nscene of future duties. Really, Mr Arabin, no priestess accustomed\nto such an excellent well as that above could put up with such a\ngrate as this.'\n\n'If there must be a priestess at St Ewold's at all, Mrs Grantly, I\nthink we shall leave her to her well, and not call down her divine\nwrath on any of the imperfections rising from our human poverty.\nHowever, I own I am amenable to the attractions of a well-cooked\ndinner, and the grate shall certainly be changed.'\n\nBy this time the archdeacon had again ascended, and was now in the\ndining-room. 'Arabin,' said he, speaking in his usual loud clear\nvoice, and with that tone of dictation which was so common to him;\n'you must positively alter this dining-room, that is, remodel it\naltogether; look here, it is just sixteen feet by fifteen; did\nanybody ever hear of a dining-room of such proportions?' and the\narchdeacon stepped the room long-ways and cross-ways with ponderous\nsteps, as though a certain amount of ecclesiastical dignity could\nbe imparted even to such an occupation as that by the manner of\ndoing it. 'Barely sixteen; you may call it a square.'\n\n'It would do very well for a round table,' suggested the ex-warden.\n\nNow there was something peculiarly unorthodox in the archdeacon's\nestimation in the idea of a round table. He had always been\naccustomed to a goodly board of decent length, comfortably\nelongating itself according to the number of guests, nearly black\nwith perpetual rubbing, and as bright as a mirror. Now round dinner\ntables are generally of oak, or else of such new construction as\nnot to have acquired the peculiar hue which was so pleasing to him.\nHe connected them with what he called the nasty new fangled method\nof leaving cloth on the table, as though to warn people that they\nwere not to sit long. In his eyes there was something democratic\nand parvenu in a round table. He imagined that dissenters and\ncalico-printers chiefly used them, and perhaps a few literary lions\nmore conspicuous for their wit than their gentility. He was a\nlittle flurried at the idea of such an article, being introduced\ninto the diocese by a protege of his own, and at the instigation of\nhis father-in-law.\n\n'A round dinner-table,' said he, with some heat, 'is the most\nabominable article of furniture that ever was invented. I hope that\nArabin has more taste than to allow such a thing in his house.'\n\nPoor Mr Harding felt himself completely snubbed, and of course said\nnothing further; but Mr Arabin, who had yielded submissively in the\nsmall matters of the cellar and kitchen grate, found himself\nobliged to oppose reforms which might be of a nature too expensive\nfor his pocket.\n\n'But it seems to me, archdeacon, that I can't very well lengthen\nthe room without pulling down the wall, and if I pull down the\nwall, I must build it up again; then if I throw out a bow on this\nside, I must do the same on the other, then if I do it for the\nground floor, I must carry it up to the floor above. That will be\nputting a new front to the house, and will cost, I suppose, a\ncouple of hundred pounds. The ecclesiastical commissioners will\nhardly assist me when they hear that my grievance consists in\nhaving a dining-room only sixteen feet long.'\n\nThe archdeacon proceeded to explain that nothing would be easier\nthan adding six feet to the front of the dining-room, without\ntouching any other of the house. Such irregularities of\nconstruction in small country houses were, he said, rather graceful\nthan otherwise, and he offered to pay for the whole thing out of\nhis own pocket if it cost more than forty pounds. Mr Arabin,\nhowever, was firm, and, although the archdeacon fussed and fumed\nabout it, would not give way.\n\nForty pounds, he said, was a matter of serious moment to him, and\nhis friends, if under such circumstances they would be good-natured\nenough to come to him at all, must put up with the misery of a\nsquare room. He was willing to compromise matters by disclaiming\nany intention of having a round table.\n\n'But,' said Mrs Grantly, 'what if the priestess insists on have\nboth the rooms enlarged?'\n\n'The priestess in that case must do it for herself, Mrs Grantly.'\n\n'I have no doubt she will be well able to do so,' replied the lady;\n'to do that and many more wonderful things. I am quite sure that\nthe priestess of St Ewold, when she does come, won't come\nempty-handed.'\n\nMr Arabin, however, did not appear well inclined to enter into\nspeculative expenses on such a chance as this, and therefore, any\nmaterial alterations in the house, the cost of which could not\nfairly be made to lie at the door either of the ecclesiastical\ncommission or of the estate of the late incumbent, were tabooed.\nWith this essential exception, the archdeacon ordered, suggested,\nand carried all points before him in a manner very much to his own\nsatisfaction. A close observer, had there been one there, might\nhave seen that his wife had been quite as useful in the matter as\nhimself. No one knew better than Mrs Grantly the appurtenances\nnecessary to a comfortable house. She did not, however, think it\nnecessary to lay claim to any of the glory which her lord and\nmaster was so ready to appropriate as his own.\n\nHaving gone through their work effectively, and systematically, the\nparty returned to Plumstead well satisfied with their expedition.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nTHE THORNES OF ULLATHORNE\n\nOn the following Sunday Mr Arabin was to read himself in at his new\nchurch. It was agreed at the rectory that the archdeacon should go\nover with him and assist at the reading-desk, and that Mr Harding\nshould take the archdeacon's duty at Plumstead Church. Mrs Grantly\nhad her school and her buns to attend to, and professed that she\ncould not be spared; but Mrs Bold was to accompany them. It was\nfurther agreed also, that they would lunch at the squire's house,\nand return home after the afternoon service.\n\nWilfred Thorne, Esq., of Ullathorne, was the squire of St Ewold's;\nor rather the squire of Ullathorne; for the domain of the modern\nlandlord was of wider notoriety than the fame of the ancient saint.\nHe was a fair specimen of what that race has come to in our days,\nwhich a century ago was, as we are told, fairly represented by\nSquire Western. If that representation be a true one, few classes\nof men can have made faster strides in improvement. Mr Thorne,\nhowever, was a man possessed of quite a sufficient number of\nfoibles to lay him open to much ridicule. He was still a bachelor,\nbeing about fifty, and was not a little proud of his person. When\nliving at home at Ullathorne there was not much room for such\npride, and there therefore he always looked like a gentleman, and\nlike that which he certainly was, the first man in his parish. But\nduring the month or six weeks which he annually spent in London, he\ntried so hard to look like a great man there also, which he\ncertainly was not, that he was put down as a fool by many at his\nclub. He was a man of considerable literary attainment in a certain\nway and on certain subjects. His favourite authors were Montaigne\nand Burton, and he knew more perhaps than any other man in his own\ncounty, and the next to it, of the English essayists of the two\nlast centuries. He possessed complete sets of the 'Idler', the\n'Spectator,' the 'Tatler,' the 'Guardian,' and the 'Rambler;' and\nwould discourse by hours together on the superiority of such\npublications to anything which has since been produced in our\nEdinburghs and Quarterlies. He was a great proficient in all\nquestions of genealogy, and knew enough of almost every gentleman's\nfamily in England to say of what blood and lineage were descended\nall those who had any claim to be considered as possessors of any\nsuch luxuries. For blood and lineage he himself had a must profound\nrespect. He counted back his own ancestors to some period long\nantecedent to the Conquest; and could tell you, if you would listen\nto him, how it had come to pass that they, like Cedric the Saxon,\nhad been permitted to hold their own among the Norman barons. It\nwas not, according to his showing, on account of any weak\ncomplaisance on the part of his family towards their Norman\nneighbours. Some Ealfried of Ullathorne once fortified his own\ncastle, and held out, not only that, but the then existing\ncathedral of Barchester also, against one Godfrey de Burgh, in the\ntime of King John; and Mr Thorne possessed the whole history of the\nsiege written on vellum, and illuminated in a most costly manner.\nIt little signified that no one could read the writing, as, had\nthat been possible, no one could have understood the language. Mr\nThorne could, however, give you all the particulars in good\nEnglish, and had no objection to do so.\n\nIt would be unjust to say that he looked down in men whose families\nwere of recent date. He did not do so. He frequently consorted with\nsuch, and had chosen many of his friends from among them. But he\nlooked on them as great millionaires are apt to look on those who\nhave small incomes; as men who have Sophocles at their fingers'\nends regard those who know nothing of Greek. They might doubtless\nbe good sort of people, entitled to much praise for virtue, very\nadmirable for talent, highly respectable in every way; but they\nwere without the one great good gift. Such was Mr Thorne's way of\nthinking on this matter; nothing could atone for the loss of good\nblood; nothing could neutralise its good effects. Few indeed were\nnow possessed of it, but the possession was on that account the\nmore precious. It was very pleasant to hear Mr Thorne descant on\nthis matter. Were you in your ignorance to surmise that such a one\nwas of a good family because the head of his family was a baronet\nof an old date, he would open his eyes with a delightful look of\naffected surprise, and modestly remind you that baronetcies only\ndated from James I. He would gently sigh if you spoke of the blood\nof the Fitzgeralds and De Burghs; would hardly allow the claims of\nthe Howards and Lowthers; and has before now alluded to the Talbots\nas a family who had hardly yet achieved the full honours of a\npedigree.\n\nIn speaking once of a wide spread race whose name had received the\nhonours of three coronets, scions from which sat for various\nconstituencies, some one of whose members had been in almost every\ncabinet formed during this present century, a brilliant race such\nas there are few in England, Mr Thorne called them all 'dirt'. He\nhad not intended any disrespect to these men. He admired them in\nmany senses, and allowed them their privileges without envy. He had\nmerely meant to express his feeling that the streams which ran\nthrough their not veins were yet purified by time to that\nperfection, had not become so genuine an ichor, as to be worthy of\nbeing called blood in the genealogical sense.\n\nWhen Mr Arabin was first introduced to him, Mr Thorne had\nimmediately suggested that he was one of the Arabins of Uphill\nStanton. Mr Arabin replied that he was a very distant relative of\nthe family alluded to. To this Mr Thorne surmised that the\nrelationship could not be very distant. Mr Arabin assured him that\nit was so distant that the families knew nothing of each other. Mr\nThorne laughed his gentle laugh at this, and told Mr Arabin that\nthere was not existing no branch of his family separated from the\nparent stock at an earlier date than the reign of Elizabeth; and\nthat therefore Mr Arabin could not call himself distant. Mr Arabin\nhimself was quite clearly an Arabin of Uphill Stanton.\n\n'But,' said the vicar, 'Uphill Stanton has been sold to the De\nGreys, and has been in their hands for the last fifty years.'\n\n'And when it has been there one hundred and fifty, if it unluckily\nremain there so long,' said Mr Thorne, 'your descendants will not\nbe a whit the less entitled to describe themselves as being of the\nfamily of Uphill Stanton. Thank God, no De Grey can buy that--and,\nthank God--no Arabin, and no Thorne, can sell it.'\n\nIn politics, Mr Thorne was an unflinching conservative. He looked\non those fifty-three Trojans, who, as Mr Dod tell us, censured free\ntrade in November 1852, as the only patriots left among the public\nmen of England. When that terrible crisis of free trade had\narrived, when the repeal of the corn laws was carried by those very\nmen whom Mr Thorne had hitherto regarded as the only possible\nsaviours of his country, he was for a time paralysed. His country\nwas lost; but that was comparatively a small thing. Other countries\nhad flourished and fallen, and the human race still went on\nimproving under God's providence. But now all trust in human faith\nmust for ever be at an end. Not only must ruin come, but it must\ncome through the apostasy of those who had been regarded as the\ntruest of true believers. Politics in England, as a pursuit for\ngentlemen, must be at an end. Had Mr Thorne been trodden under foot\nby a Whig, he could have borne it as a Tory and a martyr; but to be\nso utterly thrown over and deceived by those he had so earnestly\nsupported, so thoroughly trusted, was more than he could endure and\nlive. He therefore ceased to live as a politician, and refused to\nhold any converse with the world at large on the state of the\ncountry.\n\nSuch were Mr Thorne's impressions for the first two or three years\nafter Sir Robert Peel's apostasy; but by degrees his temper, as did\nthat of others, cooled down. He began once more to move about, to\nfrequent the bench and the market, and to be seen at dinners,\nshoulder to shoulder with some of those who had so cruelly betrayed\nhim. It was a necessity for him to live, and that plan of his for\navoiding the world did not answer. He, however, had others around\nhim, who still maintained the same staunch principles of\nprotection--men like himself, who were too true to flinch at the\ncry of a mob--had their own way of consoling themselves. They were,\nand felt themselves to be, the only true depositories left of\ncertain Eleusinian mysteries, of certain deep and wondrous services\nof worship by which alone the gods could be rightly approached. To\nthem and them only was it now given to know these things, and to\nperpetuate them, if that might still be done, by the careful and\nsecret education of their children.\n\nWe have read how private and peculiar forms of worship have been\ncarried on from age to age in families, which to the outer world\nhave apparently adhered to the service of some ordinary church. And\nso by degrees it was with Mr Thorne. He learnt at length to listen\ncalmly while protection was talked of as a thing dead, although he\nknew within himself that it was still quick with a mystic life. Nor\nwas he without a certain pleasure that such knowledge though given\nto him should be debarred from the multitude. He became accustomed\nto hear, even among country gentlemen, that free trade was after\nall not so bad, and to bear this without dispute, although\nconscious within himself that everything good in England had gone\nwith his old palladium. He had within him something of the feeling\nof Cato, who gloried that he could kill himself because Romans were\nno longer worthy of their name. Mr Thorne had no thought of killing\nhimself, being a Christian, and still possessing his L 4000 a year;\nbut the feeling was not on that account the less comfortable.\n\nMr Thorne was a sportsman, and had been active though not\noutrageous in his sports. Previous to the great downfall of\npolitics in his country, he had supported the hunt by every means\nin his power. He had preserved game till no goose or turkey could\nshow a tail in the parish of St Ewold's. He had planted gorse\ncovers with more care than oaks and larches. He had been more\nanxious for the comfort of his foxes than of his ewes and lambs. No\nmeet had been more popular than Ullathorne; no man's stables had\nbeen more liberally open to the horses of distant men than Mr\nThorne's; no man had said more, written more, or done more to keep\nthe club up. The theory of protection could expand itself so\nthoroughly in the practices of the country hunt! But the great ruin\ncame; when the noble master of the Barchester hounds supported the\nrecreant minister in the House of Lords, and basely surrendered his\ntruth, his manhood, his friends, and his honour for the hope of a\ngarter, then Mr Thorne gave up the hunt. He did not cut his\ncovers, for that would not have been the act of a gentleman. He did\nnot kill his foxes, for that according to his light would have been\nmurder. He did not say that his covers should not be drawn, or his\nearths stopped, for that would have been illegal according to the\nby-laws prevailing among country gentlemen. But he absented himself\nfrom home on the occasions of every meet at Ullathorne, left the\ncovers to their fate, and could not be persuaded to take his pink\ncoat out of the press, or his hunters out of his stable. This\nlasted for two years, and then by degrees he came round. He first\nappeared at a neighbouring meet on a pony, dressed in his shooting\ncoat, as though he had trotted in by accident; then he walked up\none morning on foot to see his favourite gorse drawn, and when his\ngroom brought his mare out by chance, he did not refuse to mount\nher. He was next persuaded, by one of the immortal fifty-three, to\nbring his hunting materials over to the other side of the county,\nand take a fortnight with the hounds there; and so gradually he\nreturned to his old life. But in hunting as in other things he was\nonly supported by the inward feeling of mystic superiority to those\nwith whom he shared the common breath of outer life.\n\nMr Thorne did not live in solitude at Ullathorne. He had a sister,\nwho was ten years older than himself, and who participated in his\nprejudices and feelings so strongly, that she was a living\ncaricature of all his foibles. She would not open a modern\nquarterly, did not choose to see a magazine in her drawing-room,\nand would not have polluted her fingers with a shred of \"The Times\"\nfor any consideration. She spoke of Addison, Swift, and Steele, as\nthough they were still living, regarded De Foe as the best known\nnovelist of his country, and thought of Fielding as a young but\nmeritorious novice in the fields of romance. In poetry, she was\nfamiliar with then names as late as Dryden, and had once been\nseduced into reading the \"Rape of the Lock\"; but she regarded\nSpenser as the purest type of her country's literature in this\nline. Genealogy was her favourite insanity. Those things which are\nthe pride of most genealogists were to her contemptible. Arms and\nmottoes set her beside herself. Ealfried of Ullathorne had wanted\nno motto to assist him in cleaving to the brisket Geoffrey De\nBurgh; and Ealfried's great grandfather, the gigantic Ullafrid, had\nrequired no other arms than those which nature gave him to hurl\nfrom the top of his own castle a cousin of the base invading\nNorman. To her all modern English names were equally insignificant.\nHengist, Horsa, and such like, had for her the only true savour of\nnobility. She was not contented unless she could go beyond the\nSaxons; and would certainly have christened her children, had she\nhad children, by the names of the ancient Britons. In some respects\nshe was not unlike Scott's Ulrica, and had she been given to\ncursing, she would certainly have done so in the names of Mista,\nSkogula, and Zernebock. Not having submitted to the embraces of any\npolluting Normans, as poor Ulrica had done, and having assisted no\nparricide, the milk of human kindness was not curdled in her bosom.\nShe never cursed, therefore, but blessed rather. This, however, she\ndid in a strange uncouth Saxon manner, that would have been\nunintelligible to any peasants but her own.\n\nAs a politician, Miss Thorne had been so thoroughly disgusted with\npublic life by base deeds long antecedent to the Corn Law question,\nthat that had but little moved her. In her estimation her brother\nhad been a fast young man, hurried away by a too ardent temperament\ninto democratic tendencies. Now happily he was brought to sounder\nviews by seeing the iniquity of the world. She had not yet\nreconciled herself to the Reform Bill, and still groaned in spirit\nover the defalcations of the Duke as touching the Catholic\nEmancipation. If asked whom she thought the Queen should take as\nher counsellor, she would probably have named Lord Eldon; and when\nreminded that that venerable man was no longer present in the flesh\nto assist us, she would probably have answered with a sigh that\nnone now could help us but the dead.\n\nIn religion, Miss Thorne was a pure Druidess. We would not have it\nunderstood by that, that she did actually in these latter days\nassist at any human sacrifices, or that she was in fact hostile to\nthe Church of Christ. She had adopted the Christian religion as a\nmilder form of the worship of her ancestors, and always appealed to\nher doing so as evidence that she had no prejudices against reform,\nwhen it could be shown that reform was salutary. This reform was\nthe most modern of any to which she had as yet acceded, it being\npresumed that British ladies had given up their paint and taken to\nsome sort of petticoats before the days of St Augustine. That\nfurther feminine step in advance which combines paint and\npetticoats together, had not found votary in Miss Thorne.\n\nBut she was a Druidess in this, that she regretted she knew not\nwhat in the usages and practices of her Church. She sometimes\ntalked and constantly thought of good things gone by, though she\nhad but the faintest idea of what those good things had been. She\nimagined that a purity had existed which was now gone; that a piety\nhad adorned our pastors and a simple docility our people, for which\nit may be feared history gave her but little true warrant. She was\naccustomed to speak of Cranmer as though he had been the firmest\nand most simple-minded of martyrs, and of Elizabeth as though the\npure Protestant faith of her people had been the one anxiety of her\nlife. It would have been cruel to undeceive her, had it been\npossible; but it would have been impossible to make her believe\nthat the one was a time-serving priest, willing to go any length to\nkeep his place, and that the other was in heart a papist, with this\nsole proviso, that she should be her own pope.\n\nAnd so Miss Thorne went on sighing and regretting, looking back to\nthe divine right of kings as the ruling axiom of a golden age, and\ncherishing, low down in the bottom of her hearts of hearts, a dear\nunmentioned wish for the restoration of some exiled Stuart. Who\nwould deny her the luxury of her sighs, or the sweetness of her\nsoft regrets!\n\nIn her person and her dress she was perfect, and well she knew her\nown perfection. She was a small elegantly made old woman, with a\nface from which the glow of her youth had not departed without\nleaving some streaks of a roseate hue. She was proud of her colour,\nproud of her grey hair which she wore in short crisp curls peering\nout all around her face from the dainty white cap. To think of all\nthe money that she spent in lace used to break the heart of poor\nMrs Quiverful with her seven daughters. She was proud of her teeth,\nwhich were still white and numerous, proud of her bright cheery\neye, proud of her short jaunty step, and very proud of the neat,\nprecise, small feet with which those steps were taken. She was\nproud also, ay, very proud, of the rich brocaded silk in which it\nwas her custom to ruffle through her drawing-room.\n\nWe know what was the custom of the lady of Branksome--\n      \"Nine and twenty knights of fame\n       Hung their shields in Branksome Hall.\"\n\nThe lady of Ullathorne was not so martial in her habits, but hardly\nless costly. She might have boasted that nine-and-twenty silken\nshirts might have been produced in her chamber, each fit to stand\nalone. The nine-and-twenty shields of the Scottish heroes were less\nindependent, and hardly more potent to withstand any attack that\nmight be made on them. Miss Thorne when fully dressed might be said\nto have been armed cap-a-pie, and she was always fully dressed, as\nfar as was ever known to mortal man.\n\nFor all this rich attire Miss Thorne was not indebted to the\ngenerosity of her brother. She had a very comfortable independence\nof her own, which she divided among juvenile relatives, the\nmilliners, and the poor, giving much the largest share to the\nlatter. It may be imagined, therefore, that with all her little\nfollies she was not unpopular. All her follies have, we believe,\nbeen told. Her virtues were too numerous to describe, and not\nsufficiently interesting to deserve description.\n\nWhile we are on the subject of the Thornes, one word must be said\nof the house they lived in. It was not a large house, nor a fine\nhouse, nor perhaps to modern ideas a very commodious house; but by\nthose who love the peculiar colour and peculiar ornaments of\ngenuine Tudor architecture it was considered a perfect gem. We beg\nto own ourselves among the number, and therefore take this\nopportunity to express our surprise that so little is known by\nEnglish men and women of the beauties of English architecture. The\nruins of the Colosseum, the Campanile at Florence, St Mark's,\nCologne, the Bourse and Notre Dame, are with our tourists as\nfamiliar as household words; but they know nothing of the glories\nof Wiltshire, Dorsetshire, and Somersetshire. Nay, we much question\nwhether many noted travellers, many who have pitched their tents\nperhaps under Mount Sinai, are not still ignorant that there are\nglories in Wiltshire, Dorsetshire and Somersetshire. We beg that\nthey will go and see.\n\nMr Thorne's house was called Ullathorne Court, and was properly so\ncalled; for the house itself formed two sides of a quadrangle,\nwhich was completed in the other two sides by a wall about twenty\nfeet high. This was built of cut stone, rudely cut indeed, and now\nmuch worn, but of a beautiful rich tawny yellow colour, the effect\nof that stonecrop of minute growth, which it had taken three\ncenturies to produce. The top of this wall was ornamented by huge\nround stone balls of the same colour as the wall itself. Entrance\ninto the court was had through a pair of iron gates, so massive\nthat no one could comfortably open or close them, consequently they\nwere rarely disturbed. From the gateway two paths led obliquely\nacross the court; that to the left reaching the hall-door, which\nwas in the corner made by the angle of the house, and that to the\nright leading to the back entrance, which was at the further end of\nthe longer portion of the building.\n\nWith those who are now adept at contriving house accommodation, it\nwill militate much against Ullathorne Court, that no carriage could\nbe brought to the hall-door. If you enter Ullathorne at all, you\nmust do so, fair reader, on foot, or at least in a bath-chair. No\nvehicle drawn by horses ever comes within that iron gate. But this\nis nothing to the next horror that will encounter you. On entering\nthe front door, which you do by no very grand portal, you find\nyourself immediately in the dining-room. What--no hall? exclaims my\nluxurious friend, accustomed to all the comfortable appurtenances\nof modern life. Yes, kind sir; a noble hall, if you will but\nobserve it; a true old English hall of excellent dimensions for a\ncountry gentleman's family; but, if you please, no dining-parlour.\n\nBut Mr and Miss Thorne were proud of this peculiarity of their\ndwelling, though the brother was once all but tempted by his\nfriends to alter it. They delighted in the knowledge that they,\nlike Cedric, positively dined in their true hall, even though they\nso dined tete-a-tete. But though they had never owned, they had\nfelt and endeavoured to remedy the discomfort of such an\narrangement. A huge screen partitioned off the front door and a\nportion of the hall, and from the angle so screened off a second\ndoor led into a passage, which ran along the larger side of the\nhouse next to the courtyard. Either my reader or I must be a bad\nhand at topography, if it be not clear that the great hall forms\nthe ground-floor of the smaller portion of the mansion, that which\nwas to your left as you entered the iron gate, and that it occupies\nthe whole of this wing of the building. It must be equally clear\nthat it looks out on a trim mown lawn, through three quadrangular\nwindows with stone mullions, each window divided into a larger\nportion at the bottom, and a smaller portion at the top, and each\nportion again divided into five by perpendicular stone supporters.\nThere may be windows which give a better light than such as those,\nand it may be, as my utilitarian friend observes, that the giving\nof light is the desired object of a window. I will not argue the\npoint with him. Indeed I cannot. But I shall not the less die in\nthe assured conviction that no sort of description of window is\ncapable of imparting half as much happiness to mankind as that\nwhich has been adopted at Ullathorne Court. What--not an oriel?\nsays Miss Diana de Midellage. No, Miss Diana; not even an oriel,\nbeautiful as is an oriel window. It has not about it so perfect a\nfeeling of quiet English homely comfort. Let oriel windows grace a\ncollege, or the half public mansion of a potent peer; but for the\nsitting room of quiet country ladies, of ordinary homely folk,\nnothing can equal the square mullioned windows of the Tudor\narchitects.\n\nThe hall was hung round with family female insipidities by Lely,\nand unprepossessing male Thornes in red coats by Kneller; each\nThorne having been let into a panel in the wainscoting in the\nproper manner. At the further end of the room was a huge\nfire-place, which afforded much ground of difference between the\nbrother and sister. An antiquated grate that would hold about a\nhundred weight of coal, had been stuck on the hearth, by Mr\nThorne's father. This hearth had of course been intended for the\nconsumption of wood fagots, and the iron dogs for the purpose were\nstill standing, though half buried in the masonry of the grate.\nMiss Thorne was very anxious to revert to the dogs. The dear good\nold creature was always to revert to anything, and had she been\nsystematically indulged, would doubtless in time have reflected\nthat fingers were made before forks, and have reverted accordingly.\nBut in the affairs of the fire-place, Mr Thorne would not revert.\nCountry gentlemen around him, all had comfortable grates in their\ndining-rooms. He was not exactly the man to have suggested a modern\nusage; but he was not so far prejudiced as to banish those which\nhis father had prepared for his use. Mr Thorne had, indeed, once\nsuggested that with very little contrivance the front door might\nhave been so altered, as to open at least into the passage; but on\nhearing this, his sister Monica, such was Miss Thorne's name, had\nbeen taken ill, and had remained so for a week. Before she came\ndown stairs she received a pledge from her brother that the\nentrance should never be changed in her lifetime.\n\nAt the end of the hall opposite to the fire-place a door led into\nthe drawing-room, which was of equal size, and lighted with\nprecisely similar windows. But yet the aspect of the room was very\ndifferent. It was papered, and the ceiling, which in the hall\nshowed the old rafters, was whitened and finished with a modern\ncornice. Miss Thorne's drawing-room, or, as she always called it,\nwithdrawing-room, was a beautiful apartment. The windows opened on\nto the full extent of the lovely trim garden; immediately before\nthe windows were plots of flowers in stiff, stately, stubborn\nlittle beds, each bed surrounded by a stone coping of its own;\nbeyond, there was a low parapet wall, on which stood urns and\nimages, fawns, nymphs, satyrs, and a whole tribe of Pan's\nfollowers; and then again, beyond that, a beautiful lawn sloped\naway to a sunk fence, which divided the garden from the park. Mr\nThorne's study was at the end of the drawing-room, and beyond that\nwere the kitchen and the offices. Doors opened into both Miss\nThorne's withdrawing-room and Mr Thorne's sanctum from the passage\nabove alluded to; which, as it came to the latter room, widened\nitself so as to make space for the huge black oak stairs, which led\nto the upper region.\n\nSuch was the interior of Ullathorne Court. But having thus\ndescribed it, perhaps somewhat too tediously, we beg to say that it\nis not the interior to which we wish to call the English tourist's\nattention, though we advise him to lose no legitimate opportunity\nof becoming acquainted with it in a friendly manner. It is the\noutside of Ullathorne that is so lovely. Let the tourist get\nadmission at least into the garden, and fling himself on that soft\naward just opposite to the exterior angle of the house. He will\nthere get the double frontage, and enjoy that which is so\nlovely--the expanse of architectural beauty without the formal\ndullness of one long line.\n\nIt is the colour of Ullathorne that is so remarkable. It is all of\nthat delicious tawny hue which no stone can give, unless it has on\nit the vegetable richness of centuries. Strike the wall with your\nhand, and you will think that the stone has on it no covering, but\nrub it carefully, and you will find that the colour comes off upon\nyour finger. No colourist that ever yet worked from a palette has\nbeen able to come up to this rich colouring of years crowding\nthemselves on years.\n\nUllathorne is a high building for a country house, for it possesses\nthree stories; and in each storey, the windows are of the same sort\nas that described, though varying in size, and varying also in\ntheir lines athwart the house. Those of the ground floor are all\nuniform in size and position. But those above are irregular both in\nsize and place, and this irregularity gives a bizarre and not\nunpicturesque appearance to the building. Along the top, on every\nside, runs a low parapet, which nearly hides the roof, and at the\ncorners are more figures of fawns and satyrs.\n\nSuch is Ullathorne House. But we must say one word of the approach\nto it, which shall include all the description which we mean to\ngive of the church also. The picturesque old church of St Ewold's\nstands immediately opposite to the iron gates which open into the\ncourt, and is all but surrounded by the branches of lime trees,\nwhich form the avenue leading up to the house from both sides.\nThis avenue is magnificent, but it would lose much of its value in\nthe eyes of many proprietors, by the fact that the road through it\nis not private property. It is a public lane between hedgerows,\nwith a broad grass margin on each side of the road, from which the\nlime trees spring. Ullathorne Court, therefore, does not stand\nabsolutely surrounded by its own grounds, though Mr Thorne is owner\nof all the adjacent land. This, however, is the source of very\nlittle annoyance to him. Men, when they are acquiring property,\nthink much of such things, but they who live where their ancestors\nhave lived for years, do not feel the misfortune. It never occurred\nto either Mr or Miss Thorne that they were not sufficiently\nprivate, because the world at large might, if it so wished, walk or\ndrive by their iron gates. That part of the world which availed\nitself of the privilege was however very small.\n\nSuch a year or two since were the Thornes of Ullathorne. Such, we\nbelieve, are the inhabitants of many an English country home. May\nit be long before their number diminishes.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nMR ARABIN READS HIMSELF IN AT ST EWOLD'S\n\nOn the Sunday morning the archdeacon with his sister-in-law and Mr\nArabin drove over to Ullathorne, as had been arranged. On their way\nthither the new vicar declared himself to be considerably disturbed\nin his mind at the idea of thus facing his parishioners for the\nfirst time. He had, he said, been always subject to mauvaise honte\nand an annoying degree of bashfulness, which often unfitted him for\nany work of a novel description; and now he felt this so strongly\nthat he feared he should acquit himself badly in St Ewold's\nreading-desk. He knew, he said, that those sharp little eyes of\nMiss Thorne would be on to him, and that they would not approve.\nAll this the archdeacon greatly ridiculed. He himself knew not, and\nhad never known, what it was to be shy. He could not conceive that\nMiss Thorne, surrounded as she would be by the peasants of\nUllathorne, and a few of the poorer inhabitants of the suburbs of\nBarchester, could in any way affect the composure of a man well\naccustomed to address the learned congregations of St Mary's at\nOxford, and he laughed accordingly at the idea of Mr Arabin's\nmodesty.\n\nThereupon Mr Arabin commenced to subtilise. The change, he said,\nfrom St Mary's to St Ewold's was quite as powerful on the spirits\nas would be that from St Ewold's to St Mary's. Would not a peer\nwho, by chance of fortune, might suddenly be driven to herd among\nthe navvies be as afraid of the jeers of his companions, as would\nany navvy suddenly exalted to a seat among the peers? Whereupon the\narchdeacon declared with a loud laugh that he would tell Miss\nThorne that her new minister had likened her to a navvy. Eleanor,\nhowever, pronounced such a conclusion unfair; a comparison might be\nvery just in its proportions which did not at all assimilate the\nthings compared. But Mr Arabin went in subtilising, regarding\nneither the archdeacon's raillery nor Eleanor's defence. A young\nlady, he said, would execute with most perfect self-possession a\ndifficult piece of music in a room crowded with strangers, who\nwould not be able to express herself in any intelligible language,\neven on any ordinary subject and among her most intimate friends,\nif she were required to do so standing on a box somewhat elevated\namong them. It was all an affair of education, and he at forty\nfound it difficult to educate himself now.\n\nEleanor dissented on the matter of the box; and averred she could\nspeak very well about dresses, or babies, or legs of mutton from\nany box, provided it were big enough for her to stand upon without\nfear, even though all her friends were listening to her. The\narchdeacon was sure she would not be able to say a word; but this\nproved nothing in favour of Mr Arabin. Mr Arabin said that he would\ntry the question out with Mrs Bold, and get her on a box some day\nwhen the rectory might be full of visitors. To this Eleanor\nassented, making condition that the visitors should be of their own\nset, and the archdeacon cogitated in his mind, whether by such a\ncondition it was intended that Mr Slope should be included,\nresolving also that, if so, the trial should certainly never take\nplace in the rectory drawing-room at Plumstead.\n\nAnd so arguing, they drove up to the iron gates of Ullathorne\nCourt.\n\nMr and Miss Thorne were standing ready dressed for church in the\nhall, and greeted their clerical visitors with cordiality. The\narchdeacon was an old favourite. He was a clergyman of the old\nschool, and this recommended him to the lady. He had always been an\nopponent of free trade as long as free trade was an open question;\nand now that it was no longer so, he, being a clergyman, had not\nbeen obliged, like most of his lay Tory companions, to read his\nrecantation. He could therefore be regarded as a supporter of the\nimmaculate fifty-three, and was on this account a favourite with Mr\nThorne. The little bell was tinkling, and the rural population were\nstanding about the lane, leaning on the church stile, and against\nthe walls of the old court, anxious to get a look at their new\nminister as he passed from the house to the rectory. The\narchdeacon's servant had already preceded them thither with the\nvestments.\n\nThey all went together; and when the ladies passed into the church\nthe three gentlemen tarried a moment in the lane, that Mr Thorne\nmight name to the vicar with some kind of one-sided introduction,\nthe most leading among his parishioners.\n\n'Here are our churchwardens, Mr Arabin; Farmer Greenacre and Mr\nStiles. Mr Stiles has the mill as you go into Barchester; and very\ngood churchwardens they are.'\n\n'Not very severe, I hope,' said Mr Arabin: the two ecclesiastical\nofficers touched their hats, and each made a leg in the approved\nrural fashion, assuring the vicar that they were glad to have the\nhonour of seeing him, and adding that the weather was very good for\nthe harvest. Mr Stiles being a man somewhat versed in town life,\nhad an impression of his own dignity, and did not quite like leaving\nhis pastor under the erroneous idea that he being a churchwarden\nkept the children in order during church time. 'Twas thus he\nunderstood Mr Arabin's allusion to his severity, and hastened to\nput matters right by observing that 'Sexton Clodheave looked to the\nyounguns, and perhaps sometimes there maybe a thought too much\nstick going on during sermon.' Mr Arabin's bright eye twinkled as\nhe caught that of the archdeacon; and he smiled to himself as he\nobserved how ignorant his officers were of the nature of their\nauthority, and of the surveillance which it was their duty to keep\neven over himself.\n\nMr Arabin read the lessons and preached. It was enough to put a man\na little out, let him have been ever so used to pulpit reading, to\nsee the knowing way in which the farmers cocked their ears, and set\nabout a mental criticism as to whether their new minister did or\ndid not fall short of the excellence of him who had lately departed\nfrom them. A mental and silent criticism it was for the existing\nmoment, but soon to be made public among the elders of St Ewold's\nover the green graves of their children and forefathers. The\nexcellence, however, of poor old Mr Goodenough had not been\nwonderful, and there were few there who did not deem that Mr Arabin\ndid his work sufficiently well, in spite of the slightly nervous\naffection which at first impeded him, and which nearly drove the\narchdeacon beside himself.\n\nBut the sermon was the thing to try the man. It often surprises us\nthat very young men can muster courage to preach for the first time\nto a strange congregation. Men who are as yet little more than\nboys, who have but just left, what indeed we may not call a school,\nbut a seminary intended for their tuition as scholars, whose\nthoughts have been mostly of boating, cricketing, and wine parties,\nascend a rostrum high above the heads of the submissive crowd, not\nthat they may read God's word to those below, but that they may\npreach their own word for the edification of their hearers. It\nseems strange to us that they are not stricken dumb by the new and\nawful solemnity of their position. How am I, just turned\ntwenty-three, who have never yet passed then thoughtful days since\nthe power of thought first came to me, how am I to instruct these\ngrey beards, who with the weary thinking of so many years have\napproached so near the grave? Can I teach them their duty? Can I\nexplain to them that which I so imperfectly understand, that which\nyears of study may have made so plain to them? Has my newly acquired\nprivileges, as one of God's ministers, imparted to me as yet any\nfitness for the wonderful work of a preacher?\n\nIt must be supposed that such ideas do occur to young clergymen,\nand yet they overcome, apparently with ease, this difficulty which\nto us appears to be all but insurmountable. We have never been\nsubjected in the way of ordination to the power of a bishop's\nhands. It may be that there is in them something that sustains the\nspirit and banishes the natural modesty of youth. But for ourselves\nwe must own that the deep affection which Dominie Sampson felt for\nhis young pupils has not more endeared him to us than the bashful\nspirit which sent him mute and inglorious from the pulpit when he\nrose there with the futile attempt to preach God's gospel.\n\nThere is a rule in our church which forbids the younger order of\nour clergymen to perform a certain portion of the service. The\nabsolution must be read by a minister in priest's orders. If there\nbe no such minister present, the congregation can have the benefit\nof no absolution but that which each may succeed in administering\nto himself. The rule may be a good one, though the necessity for it\nhardly comes home to the general understanding. But this\nforbearance on the part of youth would be much more appreciated if\nit were extended likewise to sermons. The only danger would be that\nthe congregation would be too anxious to prevent their young\nclergymen from advancing themselves to the ranks of the ministry.\nClergymen who could not preach would be such blessings that they\nwould be bribed to adhere to their incompetence.\n\nMr Arabin, however, had not the modesty of youth to impede him, and\nhe succeeded with his sermon even better than with the lessons. He\ntook for his text two verses out of the second epistle of St John:\n'Whosoever trangresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ,\nhath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ he hath\nboth the Father and Son. If there come any unto you and bring you\nnot this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him\nGod speed.' He told them that the house of theirs to which he\nalluded was this their church in which he now addressed them for\nthe first time; that their most welcome and proper manner of\nbidding him God speed would be their patient obedience to this\nteaching of the gospel; but that he could put forward no claim to\nsuch conduct on their part unless he taught them the great\nChristian doctrine of works and faith combined. On this he\nenlarged, but not very amply, and after twenty minutes succeeded in\nsending his new friends home to their baked mutton and pudding well\npleased with their new minister.\n\nThen came the lunch at Ullathorne. As soon as they were in the hall\nMiss Thorne took Mr Arabin's hand, and assured him that she\nreceived him into her house, into the temple, she said, in which\nshe worshipped, and bade him God speed with all her heart. Mr\nArabin was touched, and squeezed the spinster's hand without\nuttering a word in reply. Then Mr Thorne expressed a hope that Mr\nArabin found the church easy to fill, and Mr Arabin having replied\nthat he had no doubt he should do so as soon as he had learnt to\npitch his voice to the building, they all sat down to the good\nthings before them.\n\nMiss Thorne took special care of Mrs Bold. Eleanor still wore her\nwidow's weeds, and therefore had about her that air of grave and\nsad maternity which is the lot of recent widows. This opened the\nsoft heart of Miss Thorne, and made her look on her young guest as\nthough too much could not be done for her. She heaped chicken and\nham upon her plate, and poured out for her a full bumper of port\nwine. When Eleanor, who was not sorry to get it, had drunk a little\nof it, Miss Thorne at once essayed to fill it again. To this\nEleanor objected, but in vain. Miss Thorne winked and nodded and\nwhispered, saying that it was the proper thing and must be done,\nand that she knew all about it; and so she desired Mrs Bold to\ndrink it up, and mind any body.\n\n'It is your duty, you know, to support yourself,' she said into the\near of the young mother; 'there's more than yourself depending on\nit;' and thus she coshered up Eleanor with cold fowl and port wine.\nHow it is that poor men's wives, who have no cold fowl and port\nwine on which to be coshered up, nurse their children without\ndifficulty, whereas the wives of rich men, who eat and drink\neverything that is good, cannot do so, we will for the present\nleave to the doctors and mothers to settle between them.\n\nAnd then Miss Thorne was great about teeth. Little Johnny Bold had\nbeen troubled for the last few days with his first incipient\nmasticator, and with that freemasonry which exists between ladies,\nMiss Thorne became aware of the fact before Eleanor had half\nfinished her wing. The old lady prescribed at once a receipt which\nhad been much in vogue in the young days of her grandmother, and\nwarned Eleanor with solemn voice against the fallacies of modern\nmedicine.\n\n'Take his coral, my dear,' said she, 'and rub it well with\ncarrot-juice; rub it till the juice dries on it, and then give it\nto him to play with--'\n\n'But he hasn't got a coral,' said Eleanor.\n\n'Not got a coral!' said Miss Thorne, with almost angry vehemence.\n'Not got a coral!--How can you expect that he should cut his teeth?\nHave you got Daffy's Elixir?'\n\nEleanor explained that she had not. It had not been ordered by Mr\nRerechild, the Barchester doctor whom she employed; and then the\nyoung mother mentioned some shockingly modern succedaneum, which Mr\nRerechild's new lights had taught him to recommend.\n\nMiss Thorne looked awfully severe. 'Take care, my dear,' said she,\n'that the man knows what he is about; take care he doesn't destroy\nyour little boy. 'But'--and her voice softened into sorrow as she\nsaid it, and spoke more in pity than in anger--'but I don't know\nwho there is in Barchester now that you can trust. Poor dear old Dr\nBumpwell, indeed--'\n\n'Why, Miss Thorne, he died when I was a little girl.'\n\n'Yes, my dear, he did, and an unfortunate day it was for\nBarchester. As to those young men that have come up since' (Mr\nRerechild, by the by, was quite as old as Miss Thorne herself),\n'one doesn't know where they came from or who they are, or whether\nthey know anything about their business or not.'\n\n'I think there are very clever men in Barchester,' said Eleanor.\n\n'Perhaps there may be; only I don't know them; and it's admitted on\nall sides that medical men aren't now what they used to be. They\nused to be talented, observing, educated men. But now any\nwhipper-snapper out of an apothecary's shop can call himself a\ndoctor. I believe no kind of education is now thought necessary.'\n\nEleanor was herself the widow of a medical man, and felt a little\ninclined to resent all these hard sayings. But Miss Thorne was so\nessentially good-natured that it was impossible to resent anything\nshe said. She therefore sipped her wine and finished her chicken.\n\n'At any rate, my dear, don't forget the carrot-juice, and by all\nmeans get him a coral at once. My grandmother Thorne had the best\nteeth in the county, and carried them to the grave with her at\neighty. I have heard her say it was all the carrot-juice. She\ncouldn't bear the Barchester doctors. Even poor Dr Bumpwell didn't\nplease her.' It clearly never occurred to Miss Thorne that some\nfifty years ago Dr Bumpwell was only a rising man, and therefore as\nmuch in need of character in the eyes of the then ladies of\nUllathorne, as the present doctors were in her own.\n\nThe archdeacon made a very good lunch, and talked to his host about\nturnip-drillers and new machines for reaping; while the host,\nthinking it only polite to attend to a stranger, and fearing that\nperhaps he might not care about turnip crops on a Sunday, mooted\nall manner of ecclesiastical subjects.\n\n'I never saw a heavier lot of wheat, Thorne, than you've got there\nin the field beyond the copse. I suppose that's guano,' said the\narchdeacon.\n\n'Yes, guano. I get it from Bristol myself. You'll find you often\nhave a tolerable congregation of Barchester people out here, Mr\nArabin. They are very fond of St Ewold's, particularly of an\nafternoon, when the weather is not too hot for a walk.'\n\n'I am under an obligation to them for staying away today, at any\nrate,' said the vicar. 'The congregation can never be too small for\na maiden sermon.'\n\n'I got a ton and a half at Bradley's in High Street,' said the\narchdeacon, 'and it was a complete take in. I don't believe there\nwas five hundred-weight of guano in it.'\n\n'That Bradley never has anything good,' said Miss Tborne, who had\njust caught the name during her whisperings with Eleanor. 'And such\na nice shop as there used to be in that very house before he came.\nWilfred, don't you remember what good things old Ambleoff used to\nhave?'\n\n'There have been three men since Ambleoff's time,' said the\narchdeacon, 'and each as bad as the other. But who gets it for you\nat Bristol, Thorne?'\n\n'I ran up myself this year and bought it out of the ship. I am\nafraid as the evenings get shorter, Mr Arabin, you'll find the\nreading desk too dark. I must send a fellow with an axe and make\nhim lop off some of those branches.'\n\nMr Arabin declared that the morning light at any rate was perfect,\nand deprecated any interference with the lime trees. And then they\ntook a stroll out among the trim parterres, and Mr Arabin explained\nto Mrs Bold the difference between a naiad and a dryad, and dilated\non vases and the shapes of urns. Miss Thorne busied herself among\nthe pansies; and her brother, finding it quite impracticable to\ngive anything of a peculiarly Sunday tone to the conversation,\nabandoned the attempt, and had it out with the archdeacon about the\nBristol guano.\n\nAt three o'clock they again went into church; and now Mr Arabin\nread the service and the archdeacon preached. Nearly the same\ncongregation was present, with some adventurous pedestrians from\nthe city, who had not thought the heat of the mid-day August sun\ntoo great to deter them. The archdeacon took his text from the\nEpistle of Philemon. 'I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I\nhave begotten in my bonds.' From such a text it may be imagined the\nkind of sermon which Dr Grantly preached, and on the whole it was\nneither dull, nor bad, nor out of place.\n\nHe told them it had become his duty to look about for a pastor for\nthem; to supply the place of one who had been long among them; and\nthat in this manner he regarded as a son him whom he had selected,\nas St Paul had regarded the young disciple whom he sent forth. Then\nhe took a little merit to himself for having studiously provided\nthe best man he could without reference to patronage or favour; but\nhe did not say that the best man according to his views was he who\nwas best able to subdue Mr Slope, and make that gentleman's\nsituation in Barchester too hot to be comfortable. As to the bonds,\nthey had consisted in the exceeding struggle which he had made to\nget a good clergyman for them. He deprecated any comparison between\nhimself and St Paul, but said that he was entitled to beseech them\nfor their good will towards Mr Arabin, in the same manner that the\napostle had besought Philemon and his household with regard to\nOnesimus.\n\nThe archdeacon's sermon, text, blessing and all, was concluded\nwithin the half hour. Then they shook hands with their Ullathorne\nfriends, and returned to Plumstead. 'Twas thus that Mr Arabin read\nhimself in at St Ewold's.\n\n\n\n CHAPTER XXIV\n\nMR SLOPE'S MANAGES MATTERS VERY CLEVERLY AT PUDDINGDALE\n\nThe next two weeks passed pleasantly enough at Plumstead. The whole\nparty there assembled seemed to get on well together. Eleanor made\nthe house agreeable, and the archdeacon and Mrs Grantly seemed to\nhave forgotten her injury as regarded Mr Slope. Mr Harding had his\nvioloncello, and played to them while his daughters accompanied\nhim. Johnny Bold, by the help either of Mr Rerechild or else by\nthat of his coral and carrot-juice, got through his teething\ntroubles. There had been gaieties too of all sorts. They had dined\nat Ullathorne, and the Thornes had dined at the rectory. Eleanor\nhad been duly put to stand on her box, and in that position had\nfound herself quite unable to express her opinion on the merits of\nflounces, such having been the subject given to try her elocution.\nMr Arabin had of course been much in his own parish, looking to the\ndoings at his vicarage, calling on his parishioners, and taking on\nhimself the duties of his new calling. But still he had been every\nevening at Plumstead, and Mrs Grantly was partly willing to agree\nwith her husband that he was a pleasant inmate in a house.\n\nThey had also been at a dinner party at Dr Stanhope's, of which Mr\nArabin had made one. He also, moth-like, burnt his wings in the\nflames of the signora's candle. Mrs Bold, too, had been there, and\nhad felt somewhat displeased with the taste, want of taste she\ncalled it, shown by Mr Arabin in paying so much attention to Madame\nNeroni. It was as infallible that Madeline should displease and\nirritate the women, as that she should charm and captivate the men.\nThe one result followed naturally on the other. It was quite true\nthat Mr Arabin had been charmed. He thought her a very clever and a\nvery handsome woman; he thought also that her peculiar afflictions\nentitled her to the sympathy of all. He had never, he said, met so\nmuch suffering joined to such perfect beauty and so clear a mind.\n'Twas thus he spoke of the signora coming home in the archdeacon's\ncarriage; and Eleanor by no means liked to hear the praise. It was,\nhowever, exceedingly unjust of her to be angry with Mr Arabin, as\nshe had herself spent a very pleasant evening with Bertie Stanhope,\nwho had taken her down to dinner, and had not left her side for one\nmoment after the gentlemen came out of the dining-room. It was\nunfair that she should amuse herself with Bertie and yet begrudge\nher new friend his licence of amusing himself with Bertie's sister.\nAnd yet she did so. She was half angry with him in the carriage,\nand said something about meretricious manners. Mr Arabin did not\nunderstand the ways of women very well, or else he might have\nflattered himself that Eleanor was in love with him.\n\nBut Eleanor was not in love with him. How many shades there are\nbetween love and indifference, and how little the graduated scale\nis understood! She had now been nearly three weeks in the same\nhouse with Mr Arabin, and had received much of his attention, and\nlistened daily to his conversation. He had usually devoted at least\nsome portion of his evening to her exclusively. At Dr Stanhope's he\nhad devoted himself exclusively to another. It does not require\nthat a woman should be in love to be irritated at this; it does not\nrequire that she should even acknowledge to herself that it was\nunpleasant to her. Eleanor had no such self-knowledge. She thought\nin her own heart it was only on Mr Arabin's account that she\nregretted that he could condescend to be amused by the signora. 'I\nthought he had more mind,' she said to herself, as she sat watching\nher baby's cradle on her return from the party. 'After all, I\nbelieve Mr Stanhope is the pleasanter man of the two.' Alas for the\nmemory of poor John Bold! Eleanor was not in love with Bertie\nStanhope, nor was she in love with Mr Arabin. But her devotion to\nher late husband was fast fading, when she could revolve in her\nmind, over the cradle of his infant, the faults and failings of\nother aspirants to her favour.\n\nWill any one blame my heroine for this? Let him or her rather thank\nGod for all His goodness,--for His mercy endureth for ever.\n\nEleanor, in truth, was not in love; neither was Mr Arabin. Neither\nindeed was Bertie Stanhope, though he had already found occasion to\nsay nearly as much as that he was. The widow's cap had prevented\nhim from making a positive declaration, when otherwise he would\nhave considered himself entitled to do so on a third or fourth\ninterview. It was, after all, but a small cap now, and had but\nlittle of the weeping-willow left in its construction. It is\nsingular how these emblems of grief fade away by unseen gradations.\nEach pretends to be the counterpart of the forerunner, and yet the\nlast little bit of crimped white crape that sits so jauntily on the\nback of the head, is as dissimilar to the first huge mountain of\nwoe which disfigured the face of the weeper, as the state of the\nHindoo is to the jointure of the English dowager.\n\nBut let it be clearly understood that Eleanor was in love with no\none, and that no one was in love with Eleanor. Under these\ncircumstances her anger against Mr Arabin did not last long, and\nbefore two days were over they were both as good friends as ever.\nShe could not but like him, for every hour spent in his company was\nspent pleasantly. And yet she could not quite like him, for there\nwas always apparent in his conversation a certain feeling on his\npart that he hardly thought it worth his while to be in earnest. It\nwas almost as though he were playing with a child. She knew well\nenough that he was in truth a sober thoughtful man, who in some\nmatters and on some occasions could endure an agony of earnestness.\nAnd yet to her he was always gently playful. Could she have seen\nhis brow once clouded she might have learnt to love him.\n\nSo things went on at Plumstead, and on the whole not unpleasantly,\ntill a huge storm darkened the horizon, and came down upon the\ninhabitants of the rectory with all the fury of a water-spout. It\nwas astonishing how in a few minutes the whole face of the heavens\nwas changed. The party broke up from breakfast in perfect harmony;\nbut fierce passions had arisen before the evening, which did not\nadmit of their sitting at the same board for dinner. To explain\nthis, it will be necessary to go back a little.\n\nIt will be remembered that the bishop expressed to Mr Slope in his\ndressing-room, his determination that Mr Quiverful should be\nconfirmed in his appointment to the hospital, and that his lordship\nrequested Mr Slope to communicate this decision to the archdeacon.\nIt will also be remembered that the archdeacon had indignantly\ndeclined seeing Mr Slope, and had, instead, written a strong letter\nto the bishop, in which he all but demanded the situation of warden\nfor Mr Harding. To this letter the archdeacon received an immediate\nformal reply from Mr Slope, in which it was stated, that the bishop\nhad received and would give his best consideration to the\narchdeacon's letter.\n\nThe archdeacon felt himself somewhat checkmated by this reply. What\ncould he do with a man who would neither see him, nor argue with\nhim by letter, and who had undoubtedly the power of appointing any\nclergyman he pleased? He had consulted with Mr Arabin, who had\nsuggested the propriety of calling in the aid of the master of\nLazarus. 'If,' said he, 'you and Dr Gwynne formally declare your\nintention of waiting upon the bishop, the bishop will not dare to\nrefuse to see you; and if two such men as you see him together, you\nwill probably not leave him without carrying your point.'\n\nThe archdeacon did not quite like admitting the necessity of his\nbeing backed by the master of Lazarus before he could obtain\nadmission into the episcopal palace of Barchester; but still he\nfelt that the advice was good, and he resolved to take it. He wrote\nagain to the bishop, expressing a hope that nothing further would\nbe done in the matter of the hospital, till the consideration\npromised by his lordship had been given, and then sent off a warm\nappeal to his friend the master, imploring him to come to Plumstead\nand assist in driving the bishop into compliance. The master had\nrejoined, raising some difficulty, but not declining; and the\narchdeacon again pressed his point, insisting on the necessity for\nimmediate action. Dr Gwynne unfortunately had the gout, and could\ntherefore name no immediate day, but still agreed to come, if it\nshould be finally found necessary. So the matter stood, as regarded\nthe party at Plumstead.\n\nBut Mr Harding had another friend fighting the battle for him,\nquite as powerful as the master of Lazarus, and this was Mr Slope.\nThough the bishop had so pertinaciously insisted on giving way to\nhis wife in the matter of the hospital, Mr Slope did not think it\nnecessary to abandon the object. He had, he thought, daily more and\nmore reason to imagine that the widow would receive his overtures\nfavourably, and he could not but feel that Mr Harding at the\nhospital, and placed there by his means would be more likely to\nreceive him as a son-in-law, than Mr Harding growling in opposition\nand disappointment under the archdeacon's wing at Plumstead.\nMoreover, to give Mr Slope due credit, he was actuated by greater\nmotives even than these. He wanted a wife, and he wanted money, but\nhe wanted power more than either. He had fully realised the fact\nthat he must come to blows with Mrs Proudie. He had no desire to\nremain in Barchester as her chaplain. Sooner than do so, he would\nrisk the loss of his whole connection with the diocese. What! Was\nhe to feel within him the possession of no ordinary talents; was he\nto know himself to be courageous, firm, and, in matters where his\nconscience did not interfere, unscrupulous; and yet be contented to\nbe the working factotum of a woman-prelate? Mr Slope had higher\nideas of his own destiny. Either he or Mrs Proudie must go to the\nwall; and now had come the time when he would try which it would\nbe.\n\nThe bishop had declared that Mr Quiverful should be the new warden.\nAs Mr Slope went down stairs prepared to see the archdeacon if\nnecessary, but fully satisfied that no such necessity would arise,\nhe declared to himself that Mr Harding should be warden. With the\nobject of carrying this point he rode over to Puddingdale, and had\na further interview with the worthy expectant of clerical good\nthings. Mr Quiverful was on the whole a worthy man. The impossible\ntask of bringing up as ladies and gentlemen fourteen children on an\nincome which was insufficient to give them with decency the common\nnecessities of life, had had an effect upon him not beneficial\neither to his spirit, or his keen sense of honour. Who can boast\nthat he would have supported such a burden with a different result?\nMr Quiverful was an honest, pain- staking, drudging man; anxious,\nindeed, for bread and meat, anxious for means to quiet his butcher\nand cover with returning smiles the now sour countenance of the\nbaker's wife, but anxious also to be right with his own conscience.\nHe was not careful, as another might be who sat on an easier\nworldly seat, to stand well with those around him, to shun a breath\nwhich might sully his name, or a rumour which might affect his\nhonour. He could not afford such niceties of conduct, such moral\nluxuries. It must suffice for him to be ordinarily honest according\nthe ordinary honesty of the world's ways, and to let men's tongues\nwag as they would.\n\nHe had felt that his brother clergymen, men whom he had known for\nthe last twenty years, looked coldly on him from the first moment\nthat he had shown himself willing to sit at the feet of Mr Slope;\nhe had seen that their looks grew colder still, when it became\nbruited about that he was to be the bishop's new warden at Hiram's\nhospital. This was painful enough; but it was the cross which he\nwas doomed to bear. He thought of his wife, whose last new silk\ndress was six years in wear. He thought of all his young flock,\nwhom he could hardly take to church with him on Sundays, for there\nwas not decent shoes and stockings for them all to wear. He thought\nof the well-worn sleeves of his own black coat, and of the stern\nface of the draper from whom he would fain ask for cloth to make\nanother, did he not know that the credit would be refused him. Then\nhe thought of the comfortable house in Barchester, of the\ncomfortable income, of his boys sent to school, of the girls with\nbooks in their hands instead of darning needles, of his wife's face\nagain covered with smiles, and of his daily board again covered\nwith plenty. He thought of all these things; and do thou also,\nreader, think of them, and then wonder, if thou canst, that Mr\nSlope had appeared to him to possess all those good gifts which\nwould grace a bishop's chaplain. 'How beautiful upon the mountains\nare the feet of him that bringeth good tidings.'\n\nWhy, moreover, should the Barchester clergy have looked so coldly\non Mr Quiverful? Had they not all shown that they regarded with\ncomplacency the loaves and fishes of their mother church? Had they\nnot all, by some hook or crook, done better for themselves than he\nhad done? They were not burdened as he was burdened. Dr Grantly had\nfive children, and nearly as many thousands a year on which to feed\nthem. It was very well for him to turn up his nose at a new bishop\nwho could do nothing for him, and a chaplain who was beneath his\nnotice; but it was cruel in a man so circumstanced to set the world\nagainst the father of fourteen children because he was anxious to\nobtain for them an honourable support! He, Mr Quiverful, had not\nasked for the wardenship; he had not even accepted it till he had\nbeen assured that Mr Harding had refused it. How hard then that he\nshould be blamed for doing that which not to have done would have\nargued a most insane imprudence!\n\nThus in this matter of the hospital poor Mr Quiverful had his\ntrials; and he had also his consolations. On the whole the\nconsolations were the more vivid of the two. The stern draper heard\nof the coming promotion, and the wealth of his warehouse was at Mr\nQuiverful's disposal. Coming events cast their shadows before, and\nthe coming event of Mr Quiverful's transference to Barchester\nproduced a delicious shadow in the shape of a new outfit for Mrs\nQuiverful and her three elder daughters. Such consolations come\nhome to the heart of a man, and quite home to the heart of a woman.\nWhatever the husband might feel, the wife cared nothing for the\nfrowns of the dean, archdeacon, or prebendary. To her the outsides\nand insides of her husband and fourteen children were everything.\nIn her bosom every other ambition had been swallowed up in that\nmaternal ambition of seeing them and him and herself duly clad and\nproperly fed. It had come to that with her that life had now no\nother purpose. She recked nothing of the imaginary rights of\nothers. She had no patience with her husband when he declared to\nher that he could not accept the hospital unless he knew that Mr\nHarding had refused it. Her husband had no right to be Quixotic at\nthe expense of fourteen children. The narrow escape of throwing\naway his good fortune which her lord had had, almost paralysed her.\nNow, indeed, they had received the full promise not only from Mr\nSlope, but also from Mrs Proudie. Now, indeed, they might reckon\nwith safety on their good fortune. But what if it all had been\nlost? What if her fourteen bairns had been resteeped to the hips in\npoverty by the morbid sentimentality of their father? Mrs Quiverful\nwas just at present a happy woman, but yet it nearly took her\nbreath away when she thought of the risk they had run.\n\n'I don't know what your father means when he talks so much of what\nis due to Mr Harding,' she said to her eldest daughter. 'Does he\nthink that Mr Harding would give him L 450 out of fine feeling? And\nwhat signifies it when he offends, as long as he gets the place? He\ndoes not expect anything better. It passes me to think how your\nfather can be so soft, while everybody around him is so griping.'\n\nThis, while the rest of the world was accusing Mr Quiverful of\nrapacity for promotion and disregard for his honour, the inner\nworld of his own household was falling foul of him, with equal\nvehemence, for his willingness to sacrifice their interest to a\nfalse feeling of sentimental pride. It is astonishing how much\ndifference the point of view makes in the aspect of all that we\nlook at!\n\nSuch was the feelings of the different members of the family at\nPuddingdale on the occasion of Mr Slope's second visit. Mrs\nQuiverful, as soon as she saw his horse coming up the avenue from\nthe vicarage gate, hastily packed up her huge basket of needlework,\nand hurried herself and her daughter out of the room in which she\nwas sitting with her husband. 'It's Mr Slope,' she said. 'He's come\nto settle with you about the hospital. I do hope we shall now be\nable to move at once.' And she hastened to bid the maid of all work\nto go to the door, so that the welcome great man might not be kept\nwaiting.\n\nMr Slope thus found Mr Quiverful alone. Mrs Quiverful went off to\nher kitchen and back settlements with anxious beating heart, almost\ndreading that there might be some slip between the cup of her\nhappiness and the lip of her fruition, but yet comforting herself\nwith the reflection that after what had taken place, any such slip\ncould hardly be possible.\n\nMr Slope was all smiles as he shook his brother clergyman's hand,\nand said that he had ridden over because he thought it right at\nonce to put Mr Quiverful in possession of the facts of the matter\nregarding the wardenship of the hospital. As he spoke, the poor\nexpectant husband and father saw at a glance that his brilliant\nhopes were to be dashed to the ground, and that his visitor was now\nthere for the purpose of unsaying what on his former visit he had\nsaid. There was something in the tone of the voice, something in\nthe glance of the eye, which told the tale. Mr Quiverful knew it\nall at once. He maintained his self-possession, however, smiled\nwith a slight unmeaning smile, and merely said that he was obliged\nto Mr Slope for the trouble he was taking.\n\n'It has been a troublesome matter from first to last,' said Mr\nSlope; 'and the bishop has hardly known how to act. Between\nourselves--but mind this of course must go no farther, Mr\nQuiverful.'\n\nMr Quiverful said of course that it should not. 'The truth is, that\npoor Mr Harding has hardly known his own mind. You remember our\nlast conversation, no doubt.'\n\nMr Quiverful assured him that he remembered it very well indeed.\n\n'You will remember that I told you that Mr Harding had refused to\nreturn to the hospital.'\n\nMr Quiverful declared that nothing could be more distinct in his\nmemory.\n\n'And acting on this refusal I suggested that you should take the\nhospital,' continued Mr Slope.\n\n'I understood you to say that the bishop had authorised you to\noffer it to me.'\n\n'Did I? Did I go so far as that? Well, perhaps it may be, that in\nmy anxiety on your behalf I did commit myself further than I should\nhave done. So far as my own memory serves me, I don't think I did\ngo quite so far as that. But I own I was very anxious that you\nshould get it; and I may have said more than was quite prudent.'\n\n'But,' said Mr Quiverful, in his deep anxiety to prove his case,\n'my wife received as distinct a promise from Mrs Proudie as one\nhuman being could give to another.'\n\nMr Slope smiled, and gently shook his head. He meant that smile for\na pleasant smile, but it was diabolical in the eyes of the man he\nwas speaking to. 'Mrs Proudie!' he said. 'If we are to go to what\npasses between the ladies in these matters, we shall really be in a\nnest of troubles from which we shall never extricate ourselves. Mrs\nProudie is a most excellent lady, kind-hearted, charitable, pious,\nand in every way estimable. But, my dear Mr Quiverful, the\npatronage of the diocese is not in her hands.'\n\nMr Quiverful for a moment sat panic-stricken and silent. 'Am I to\nunderstand, then, that I have received no promise?' he said, as\nsoon as he had sufficiently collected his thoughts.\n\n'If you will allow me, I will tell you exactly how the matter\nrests. You certainly did receive a promise conditional on Mr\nHarding's refusal. I am sure you will do me the justice to remember\nthat you yourself declared that you could accept the appointment on\nno other condition than the knowledge that Mr Harding had declined\nit.'\n\n'Yes,' said Mr Quiverful; 'I did say that, certainly.'\n\n'Well; it now appears that he did not refuse it.'\n\n'But surely you told me, and repeated it more than once, that he\nhad done so in your hearing.'\n\n'So I understood him. But it seems I was in error. But don't for a\nmoment, Mr Quiverful, suppose that I mean to throw you over. No.\nHaving held out my hand to a man in your position, with your large\nfamily and pressing claims, I am not now going to draw it back\nagain. I only want you to act with me fairly and honestly.'\n\n'Whatever I do, I shall endeavour at any rate to act fairly,' said\nthe poor man, feeling that he had to fall back for support on the\nspirit of martyrdom within him.\n\n'I am sure you will,' said the other. 'I am sure you have no wish\nto obtain possession of an income which belongs by all rights to\nanother. No man knows better than you do Mr Harding's history, or\ncan better appreciate his character. Mr Harding is very desirous of\nreturning to his old position, and the bishop feels that he is at\nthe present moment somewhat hampered, though of course he is not\nbound, by the conversation which took place on the matter between\nyou and me.'\n\n'Well,' said Mr Quiverful, dreadfully doubtful as to what his\nconduct under such circumstances should be, and fruitlessly\nstriving to harden his nerves with some of that instinct of\nself-preservation which made his wife so bold.\n\n'The wardenship of this little hospital is not the only thing in\nthe bishop's gift, Mr Quiverful, nor is it by many degrees the\nbest. And his lordship is not the man to forget any one whom he has\nonce marked with approval. If you would allow me to advise you as a\nfriend--'\n\n'Indeed I shall be grateful to you,' said the poor vicar of\nPuddingdale--\n\n'I should advise you to withdraw from any opposition to Mr\nHarding's claims. If you persist in your demand, I do not think you\nwill ultimately succeed. Mr Harding has all but a positive right to\nthe place. But if you will allow me to inform his lordship that you\ndecline to stand in Mr Harding's way, I think I may promise\nyou--though, by the bye, it must not be taken as a formal\npromise--that the bishop will not allow you to be a poorer man than\nyou would have been had you become warden.'\n\nMr Quiverful sat in his arm chair silent, gazing at vacancy. What\nwas he to say? All this that came from Mr Slope was so true. Mr\nHarding had a right to the hospital. The bishop had a great many\ngood things to give away. Both the bishop and Mr Slope would be\nexcellent friends and terrible enemies to a man in his position.\nAnd then he had no proof of any promise; he could not force the\nbishop to appoint him.\n\n'Well, Mr Quiverful, what do you say about it?'\n\n'Oh, of course, whatever you think, Mr Slope. It's a great\ndisappointment, a very great disappointment. I won't deny that I am\na very poor man, Mr Slope.'\n\n'In the end, Mr Quiverful, you will find that it will have been\nbetter for you.'\n\nThe interview ended in Mr Slope receiving a full renunciation from\nMr Quiverful of any claim he might have to the appointment in\nquestion. It was only given verbally and without witnesses; but\nthen the original promise was made in the same way.\n\nMr Slope assured him that he should not be forgotten, and then rode\nback to Barchester, satisfied that he would now be able to mould\nthe bishop to his wishes.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nFOURTEEN ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF MR QUIVERFUL'S CLAIMS\n\nWe have most of us heard of the terrible anger of a lioness when,\nsurrounded by her cubs, she guards her prey. Few of us wish to\ndisturb the mother of a litter of puppies when mouthing a bone in\nthe midst of her young family. Medea and her children are familiar\nto us, and so is the grief of Constance. Mrs Quiverful, when she\nfirst heard from her husband the news which he had to impart, felt\nwithin her bosom all the rage of a lioness, the rapacity of the\nhound, the fury of the tragic queen, and the deep despair of a\nbereaved mother.\n\nDoubting, but yet hardly fearing, what might have been the tenor of\nMr Slope's discourse, she rushed back to her husband as soon as the\nfront door was closed behind the visitor. It was well for Mr Slope\nthat he had so escaped,--the anger of such a woman, at such a\nmoment, would have cowed even him. As a general rule, it is highly\ndesirable that ladies should keep their temper; a woman when she\nstorms always makes herself ugly, and usually ridiculous also.\nThere is nothing so odious to man as a virago. Though Theseus loved\nan Amazon, he showed his love but roughly; and from the time of\nTheseus downward, no man ever wished to have his wife remarkable\nrather for forward prowess than retiring gentleness.\n\nSuch may be laid down as a general rule; and few women should allow\nthemselves to deviate from it, and then only on rare occasions. But\nif there be a time when a woman may let her hair to the winds, when\nshe may loose her arms, and scream out trumpet-tongued to the ears\nof men, it is when nature calls out within her not for her own\nwants, but for the wants of those whom her womb has borne, whom her\nbreasts have suckled, for those who look to her for their daily\nbread as naturally as man looks to his Creator.\n\nThere was nothing poetic in the nature of Mrs Quiverful. She was\nneither a Medea nor a Constance. When angry, she spoke out her\nanger in plain words, and in a tone which might have been modulated\nwith advantage; but she did so, at any rate, without affectation.\nNow, without knowing it, she rose to a tragic vein.\n\n'Well, my dear; we are not to have it.' Such were the words with\nwhich her ears were greeted when she entered the parlour, still hot\nfrom the kitchen fire. And the face of her husband spoke even more\nplainly than his words:--\"E'en such a man, so faint, so spiritless,\nSo dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone, Drew Priam's curtain in\nthe dead of night.\"\n\n'What!' said she,--and Mrs Siddons could not have put more passion\ninto a single syllable,--'What! Not have it? Who says so?' And she\nsat opposite to her husband, with her elbows on the table, her\nhands clasped together, and her coarse, solid, but once handsome\nface stretched over it towards him.\n\nShe sat as silent as death while he told his story, and very\ndreadful to him her silence was. He told it very lamely and badly,\nbut still in such a manner that she soon understood the whole of\nit.\n\n'And so you have resigned it?' said she.\n\n'I have had no opportunity of accepting it,' he replied. 'I had no\nwitnesses to Mr Slope's offer, even if that offer would bind the\nbishop. It was better for me, on the whole, to keep on good terms\nwith such men than to fight for what I should never get!'\n\n'Witnesses!' she screamed, rising quickly to her feet, and walking\nup and down the room. 'Do clergymen require witnesses to their\nwords? He made the promise in the bishop's name, and if it is to be\nbroken I'll know the reason why. Did he not positively say that the\nbishop had sent him to offer you the place?'\n\n'He did, my dear. But that is now nothing to the purpose.'\n\n'It is everything to the purpose, Mr Quiverful. Witnesses indeed!\nAnd then to talk of your honour being questioned because you wish\nto provide for fourteen children. It is everything to the purpose;\nand so they shall know, if I scream it into their ears from the\ntown cross of Barchester.'\n\n'You forget, Letitia, that the bishop has so many things in his\ngift. We must wait a little longer. That is all.'\n\n'Wait! Shall we feed the children by waiting? Will waiting put\nGeorge and Tom, and Sam, out into the world? Will it enable my poor\ngirls to give up some of their drudgery? Will waiting make Bessy\nand Jane fit even to be governesses? Will waiting pay for the\nthings we got in Barchester last week?'\n\n'It is all we can do, my dear. The disappointment is as much to me\nas to you; and yet, God knows, I feel it more for your sake than my\nown.'\n\nMrs Quiverful was looking full into her husband's face, and saw a\nsmall hot tear appear on each of those furrowed cheeks. This was\ntoo much for her woman's heart. He also had risen, and was standing\nwith his back to the empty grate. She rushed towards him, and\nseizing him in her arms, sobbed aloud upon his bosom.\n\n'Yes, you are too good, too soft, too yielding,' she said at last.\n'These men, when they want you, they use you like a cat's-paw; and\nwhen they want you no longer, they throw you aside like an old\nshoe. This is twice they have treated you so.'\n\n'In one way this will be for the better,' argued he. 'It will make\nthe bishop feel that he is bound to do something for me.'\n\n'At any rate, he shall hear of it,' said the lady, again reverting\nto her more angry mood. 'At any rate he shall hear of it, and that\nloudly; and so shall she. She little knows Letitia Quiverful, if\nshe thinks I will sit down quietly with the loss after all that\npassed between us at the palace. If there's any feeling within her,\nI'll make her ashamed of herself,'--and she paced the room again,\nstamping the floor as she went with her fat heavy foot.\n\n'Good heavens! What a heart she must have within her to treat in\nsuch a way as this the father of fourteen unprovided children!'\n\nMr Quiverful proceeded to explain that he didn't think that Mrs\nProudie had anything to do with it.\n\n'Don't tell me,' said Mrs Quiverful; 'I know more about it than\nthat. Doesn't all the world know that Mrs Proudie is bishop of\nBarchester, and that Mr Slope is merely her creature? Wasn't it she\nthat made me the promise just as though the thing was in her own\nparticular gift? I tell you, it was that woman who sent him over\nhere to-day because, for some reason of her own, she wants to go\nback on her word.'\n\n'My dear, you're wrong--'\n\n'Now, Q, don't be so soft,' she continued. 'Take my word for it,\nthe bishop knows no more about it than Jemima does.' Jemima was the\ntwo-year old. 'And if you'll take my advice, you'll lose no time in\ngoing over and seeing him yourself.'\n\nSoft, however, as Mr Quiverful might be, he would not allow himself\nto be talked out of his opinion on this occasion; and proceeded\nwith much minuteness to explain to his wife the tone in which Mr\nSlope had spoken of Mrs Proudie's interference in diocesan matters.\nAs he did so, a new idea gradually instilled itself into the\nmatron's head, and a new course of action presented itself to her\njudgement. What if, after all, Mrs Proudie knew nothing of this\nvisit of Mr Slope's? In that case, might it not be possible that\nthat lady would still be staunch to her in this matter, still stand\nher friend, and, perhaps, possibly carry her through in opposition\nto Mr Slope? Mrs Quiverful said nothing as this vague hope occurred\nto her, but listened with more than ordinary patience to what her\nhusband had to say. While he was still explaining that in all\nprobability the world was wrong in its estimation of Mrs Proudie's\npower and authority, she had fully made up her mind as to her\ncourse of action. She did not, however, proclaim her intention. She\nshook her head continuously, as he continued his narration; and\nwhen he had completed she rose to go, merely observing that it was\ncruel, cruel treatment. She then asked if he would mind waiting for\na late dinner instead of dining at their usual hour of three, and,\nhaving received from him a concession on this point, she proceeded\nto carry her purpose into execution.\n\nShe determined that she would at once go to the palace; that she\nwould do so, if possible, before Mrs Proudie could have had an\ninterview with Mr Slope; and that she would be either submissive,\npiteous and pathetic, or indignant violent and exacting, according\nto the manner in which she was received.\n\nShe was quite confident in her own power. Strengthened as she was\nby the pressing wants of fourteen children, she felt that she could\nmake her way through legions of episcopal servants, and force\nherself, if need be, into the presence of the lady who had so\nwronged her. She had no shame about it, no mauvaise honte, no dread\nof archdeacons. She would, as she declared to her husband, make her\nwail heard in the market-place if she did not get redress and\njustice. It might be very well for an unmarried young curate to be\nshamefaced in such matters; it might be all right that a smug\nrector, really in want of nothing, but still looking for better\npreferment, should carry out his affairs decently under the rose.\nBut Mrs Quiverful, with fourteen children, had given over being\nshamefaced, and, in some things, had given over being decent. If it\nwere intended that she should be ill used in the manner proposed by\nMr Slope, it should not be done under the rose. All the world would\nknow of it.\n\nIn her present mood, Mrs Quiverful was not over careful about her\nattire. She tied her bonnet under her chin, threw her shawl over\nher shoulders, armed herself with the old family cotton umbrella,\nand started for Barchester. A journey to the palace was not quite\nso easy a thing for Mrs Quiverful as for our friend at Plumstead.\nPlumstead is nine miles from Barchester, and Puddingdale is but\nfour. But the archdeacon could order round his brougham, and his\nhigh-trotting fast bay gelding would take him into the city within\nthe hour. There was no brougham in the coach-house of Puddingdale\nVicarage, no bay horse in the stables. There was no method of\nlocomotion for its inhabitants but that which nature had assigned\nto man.\n\nMrs Quiverful was a broad heavy woman, not young, nor given to\nwalking. In her kitchen, and in the family dormitories, she was\nactive enough; but her pace and gait were not adapted for the road.\nA walk into Barchester and back in the middle of an August day\nwould be to her a terrible task, if not altogether impracticable.\nThere was living in the parish about half a mile from the vicarage\non the road to the city, a decent, kindly farmer, well to do as\nregards this world, and so far mindful of the next that he attended\nhis parish church with decent regularity. To him Mrs Quiverful had\nbefore now appealed in some of her more pressing family troubles,\nand had not appealed in vain. At his door she now presented\nherself, and, having explained to his wife that most urgent\nbusiness required her to go at once to Barchester, begged that\nFarmer Subsoil would take her thither in his tax-cart. The farmer\ndid not reject her plan; and, as soon as Prince could be got into\nhis collar, they started on their journey.\n\nMrs Quiverful did not mention the purpose of her business, nor did\nthe farmer alloy his kindness by any unseemly questions. She merely\nbegged to be put down at the bridge going into the city, and to be\ntaken up again at the same place in the course of two hours. The\nfarmer promised to be punctual to his appointment, and the lady,\nsupported by her umbrella, took the short cut to the close, and in\na few minutes was at the bishop's door.\n\nHitherto she had felt no dread with regard to the coming interview.\nShe had felt nothing but an indignant longing to pour forth her\nclaims, and declare her wrongs, if those claims were not fully\nadmitted. But now the difficulty of her situation touched her a\nlittle. She had been at the palace once before, but then she went\nto give grateful thanks. Those who have thanks to return for\nfavours received find easy admittance to the halls of the great.\nSuch is not always the case with men, or even women, who have\nfavours to beg. Still less easy is access for those who demand the\nfulfilment of promises already made.\n\nMrs Quiverful had not been slow to learn the ways of the world. She\nknew all this, and she knew also that her cotton umbrella and all\nbut ragged shawl would not command respect in the eyes of the\npalace servants. If she were too humble, she knew well that she\nwould never succeed. To overcome by imperious overbearing with such\na shawl as hers upon her shoulders, and such a bonnet on her head,\nwould have required a personal bearing very superior to that which\nnature had endowed her. Of this also Mrs Quiverful was aware. She\nmust make it known she was the wife of a gentleman and a clergyman,\nand must yet condescend to conciliate.\n\nThe poor lady knew but one way to overcome these difficulties at\nthe very threshold of her enterprise, and to this she resorted. Low\nas were the domestic funds at Puddingdale, she still retained\npossession of a half-crown, and this she sacrificed to the avarice\nof Mrs Proudie's metropolitan sesquipedalian serving-man. She was,\nshe said, Mrs Quiverful of Puddingdale, the wife of the Rev. Mr\nQuiverful. She wished to see Mrs Proudie. It was indeed quite\nindispensible that she should see Mrs Proudie. James Fitzplush\nlooked worse than dubious, did not know whether his lady were out,\nor engaged, or in her bed-room; thought it most probable that she\nwas subject to one of these or to some cause that would make her\ninvisible; but Mrs Quiverful could sit down in the waiting-room,\nwhile inquiry was being made of Mrs Proudie.\n\n'Look here, man,' said Mrs Quiverful; 'I must see her;' and she put\nher card and half-crown--think of it, my reader, think of it; her\nlast half-crown--into the man's hand, and sat herself down on a\nchair in the waiting-room.\n\nWhether the bribe carried the day, or whether the bishop's wife\nreally chose to see the vicar's wife, it boots not now to inquire.\nThe man returned, and begging Mrs Quiverful to follow him, ushered\nher into the presence of the mistress of the diocese.\n\nMrs Quiverful at once saw that her patroness was in a smiling\nhumour. Triumph sat throned upon her brow, and all the joys of\ndominion hovered about her curls. Her lord had that morning\ncontested with her a great point. He had received an invitation to\nspend a couple of days with the archbishop. His soul longed for the\ngratification. Not a word, however, in his grace's note alluded to\nthe fact that he was a married man; and, if he went at all, he must\ngo alone. This necessity would have presented an insurmountable bar\nto the visit, or have militated against the pleasure, had he been\nable to go without reference to Mrs Proudie. But this he could not\ndo. He could not order his portmanteau to be packed, and start with\nhis own man, merely telling the lady of his heart that he would\nprobably be back on Saturday. There are men--may we not rather say\nmonsters?--who do such things; and there are wives--may we not\nrather say slaves?--who put up with such usage. But Dr and Mrs\nProudie were not among the number.\n\nThe bishop with some beating about the bush, made the lady\nunderstand that he very much wished to go. The lady, without any\nbeating about the bush, made the bishop understand that she\nwouldn't hear of it. It would be useless here to repeat the\narguments that were used on each side, and needless to record the\nresult. Those who are married will understand very well how the\nbattle was lost and won; and those who are single will never\nunderstand it till they learn the lesson which experience alone can\ngive. When Mrs Quiverful was shown into Mrs Proudie's room, that\nlady had only returned a few minutes from her lord. But before she\nleft him she had seen the answer to the archbishop's note written\nand sealed. No wonder that her face was wreathed with smiles as she\nreceived Mrs Quiverful.\n\nShe instantly spoke of the subject which was so near the heart of\nher visitor. 'Well, Mrs Quiverful,' said she, 'is it decided yet\nwhen you are to move to Barchester?'\n\n'That woman', as she had an hour or two since been called, became\ninstantly re-endowed with all the graces that can adorn a bishop's\nwife. Mrs Quiverful immediately saw that her business was to be\npiteous, and that nothing was to be gained by indignation; nothing,\nindeed, unless she could be indignant in company with her\npatroness.\n\n'Oh, Mrs Proudie,' she began, 'I fear we are not to move to\nBarchester at all.'\n\n'Why not?' said the lady sharply, dropping at a moment's notice her\nsmiles and condescension, and turning with her sharp quick way to\nbusiness which she saw at a glance was important.\n\nAnd then Mrs Quiverful told her tale. As she progressed in the\nhistory of her wrongs she perceived that the heavier she leant upon\nMr Slope the blacker became Mrs Proudie's brow, but that such\nblackness was not injurious to her own cause. When Mr Slope was at\nPuddingdale vicarage that morning she had regarded him as the\ncreature of the lady-bishop; now she perceived that they were\nenemies. She admitted her mistake to herself without any pain or\nhumiliation. She had but one feeling, and that was confined to her\nfamily. She cared little how she twisted and turned among these\nnew-comers at the bishop's palace as long as she could twist her\nhusband into the warden's house. She cared not which was her friend\nor which was her enemy, if only she could get this preference which\nshe so sorely wanted.\n\nShe told her tale, and Mrs Proudie listened to it almost in\nsilence. She told how Mr Slope had cozened her husband into\nresigning his claim, and had declared that it was the bishop's will\nthat none but Mr Harding should be warden. Mrs Proudie's brow\nbecame blacker and blacker. At last she started from her chair, and\nbegging Mrs Quiverful to sit and wait for her return, marched out\nof the room.\n\n'Oh, Mrs Proudie, it's for fourteen children--for fourteen\nchildren.' Such was the burden that fell on her ear as she closed\nthe door behind her.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nMRS PROUDIE TAKES A FALL\n\nIt was hardly an hour since Mrs Proudie had left her husband's\napartment victorious, and yet so indomitable was her courage that\nshe now returned thither panting for another combat. She was\ngreatly angry with what she thought was his duplicity. He had so\nclearly given her a promise on this matter of the hospital. He had\nbeen already so absolutely vanquished on that point. Mrs Proudie\nbegan to feel that if every affair was to be thus discussed and\nbattled about twice and even thrice, the work of the diocese would\nbe too much even for her.\n\nWithout knocking at the door she walked quickly into her husband's\nroom and found him seated at his office table, with Mr Slope\nopposite to him. Between his fingers was the very note which he had\nwritten to the archbishop in her presence--and it was open! Yes, he\nhad absolutely violated the seal which had been made sacred by her\napproval. They were sitting in deep conclave, and it was too clear\nthat the purport of the archbishop's invitation had been absolutely\ncanvassed again, after it had been already debated and decided on\nin obedience to her behests! Mr Slope rose from his chair, and\nbowed slightly. The two opposing spirits looked each other fully in\nthe face, and they knew that they were looking each at an enemy.\n\n'What is this, bishop, about Mr Quiverful?' said she, coming to the\nend of the table and standing there.\n\nMr Slope did not allow the bishop to answer, but replied himself.\n'I have been out to Puddingdale this morning, ma'am, and have seen\nMr Quiverful. Mr Quiverful has abandoned his claim to the hospital,\nbecause he is now aware that Mr Harding is desirous to fill his old\nplace. Under these circumstances I have strongly advised his\nlordship to nominate Mr Harding.'\n\n'Mr Quiverful has not abandoned anything,' said the lady, with a\nvery imperious voice. 'His lordship's word has been pledged to him,\nand it must be respected.'\n\nThe bishop still remained silent. He was anxiously desirous of\nmaking his old enemy bite the dust beneath his feet. His new ally\nhad told him that nothing was more easy for him than to do so. The\nally was there now at his elbow to help him, and yet his courage\nfailed him. It is so hard to conquer when the prestige of the\nformer victories is all against one. It is so hard for the cock who\nhas once been beaten out of his yard to resume his courage and\nagain take a proud place upon a dunghill.\n\n'Perhaps I ought not to interfere,' said Mr Slope, 'but yet--'\n\n'Certainly you ought not,' said the infuriated dame.\n\n'But yet,' continued Mr Slope, not regarding the interruption, 'I\nhave thought it my imperative duty to recommend to the bishop not\nto slight Mr Harding's claims.'\n\n'Mr Harding should have known his own mind,' said the lady.\n\n'If Mr Harding be not replaced at the hospital, his lordship will\nhave to encounter much ill will, not only in the diocese, but in\nthe world at large. Besides, taking a higher ground, his lordship,\nas I understood, feels it to be his duty to gratify, in this\nmatter, so very worthy a man and so good a clergyman as Mr\nHarding.'\n\n'And what is to become of the Sabbath-day school, and of the Sunday\nservices in the hospital?' said Mrs Proudie, with something very\nnearly approaching to a sneer on her face.\n\n'I understand that Mr Harding makes no objection to the Sabbath-day\nschool,' said Mr Slope. 'And as to the hospital services, that\nmatter will be best discussed after his appointment. If he has any\npersonal objection, then, I fear, the matter must rest.'\n\n'You have a very easy conscience in such matters, Mr Slope,' said\nshe.\n\n'I should not have an easy conscience,' he rejoined, 'but a\nconscience very far from being easy, if anything said or done by me\nshould lead the bishop to act unadvisedly on this matter. It is\nclear that in the interview I had with Mr Harding, I misunderstood\nhim--'\n\n'And it is equally clear that you have misunderstood Mr Quiverful,'\nsaid she, not at the top of her wrath. 'What business have you at\nall with these interviews? Who desired you to go to Mr Quiverful\nthis morning? Who commissioned you to manage this affair? Will you\nanswer me, sir?--who sent you to Mr Quiverful this morning?'\n\nThere was a dead pause in the room. Mr Slope had risen from his\nchair, and was standing with his hand on the back of it, looking at\nfirst very solemn and now very black. Mrs Proudie was standing as\nshe had at first placed herself, at the end of the table, and as\nshe interrogated her foe she struck her hand upon it with almost\nmore than feminine vigour. The bishop was sitting in his easy chair\ntwiddling his thumbs, turning his eyes now to his wife, and now to\nhis chaplain, as each took up the cudgels. How comfortable it would\nbe if they could fight it out between them without the necessity of\nany interference on his part; fight it out so that one should kill\nthe other utterly, as far as the diocesan life was concerned, so\nthat he, the bishop, might know clearly by whom it behoved him to\nbe led. There would be the comfort of quiet in either case; but if\nthe bishop had a wish as to which might prove the victor, that wish\nwas certainly not antagonistic to Mr Slope.\n\n'Better the devil you know than the devil you don't know', is an\nold saying, and perhaps a true one; but the bishop had not yet\nrealised the truth of it.\n\n'Will you answer me, sir?' she repeated. 'Who instructed you to\ncall on Mr Quiverful this morning?' There was another pause. 'Do\nyou intend to answer me, sir?'\n\n'I think, Mrs Proudie, that under all the circumstances it will be\nbetter for me not to answer such a question,' said Mr Slope. Mr\nSlope had many tones in his voice, all duly under his command;\namong them was a sanctified low tone, and a sanctified loud tone;\nand he now used the former.\n\n'Did anyone send you, sir?'\n\n'Mrs Proudie,' said Mr Slope, 'I am quite aware how much I owe to\nyour kindness. I am aware also what is due by courtesy from a\ngentleman to a lady. But there are higher considerations than\neither of those, and I hope I shall be forgiven if I now allow\nmyself to be actuated solely by them. My duty in this matter is to\nhis lordship, and I can admit of no questioning but from him. He\nhas approved of what I have done, and you must excuse me if I say,\nthat having that approval and my own, I want none other.'\n\nWhat horrid words were these which greeted the ear of Mrs Proudie?\nThe matter was indeed too clear. There was premeditated mutiny in\nthe camp. Not only had ill-conditioned minds become insubordinate\nby the fruition of a little power. The bishop had not yet been\ntwelve months in this chair, and rebellion had already reared her\nhideous head within the palace. Anarchy and misrule would quickly\nfollow, unless she took immediate and strong measures to put down\nthe conspiracy which she had detected.\n\n'Mr Slope,' she said, with slow and dignified voice, differing much\nfrom that which she had hitherto used, 'Mr Slope, I will trouble\nyou, if you please, to leave the apartment. I wish to speak to my\nlord alone.'\n\nMr Slope also felt that everything depended on the present\ninterview. Should the bishop now be repetticoated, his thraldom\nwould be complete and for ever. The present moment was peculiarly\npropitious for rebellion. The bishop had clearly committed himself\nby breaking the seal of the answer to the archbishop; he had\ntherefore fear to influence him. Mr Slope had told him that no\nconsideration ought to induce him to refuse the archbishop's\ninvitation; he had therefore hoped to influence him. He had\naccepted Mr Quiverful's resignation, and therefore dreaded having\nto renew that matter with his wife. He had been screwed up to the\npitch of asserting a will of his own, and might possibly be carried\non till by an absolute success he should have been taught how\npossible it was to succeed. Now was the moment for victory or rout.\nIt was now that Mr Slope must make himself master of the diocese,\nor else resign his place and begin his search for fortune again. He\nsaw all this plainly. After what had taken place any compromise\nbetween him and the lady was impossible. Let him once leave the\nroom at her bidding, and leave the bishop in her hands, and he\nmight at once pack up his portmanteau and bid adieu to episcopal\nhonours, Mrs Bold, and the Signora Neroni.\n\nAnd yet it was not so easy to keep his ground when he was bidden by\na lady to go; or to continue to make a third in a party between\nhusband and wife when the wife expressed a wish for a tete-a-tete\nwith her husband.\n\n'Mr Slope,' she repeated, 'I wish to be alone with my lord.'\n\n'His lordship has summoned me on most important diocesan business,'\nsaid Mr Slope, glancing with uneasy eye at Dr Proudie. He felt that\nhe must trust something to the bishop, and yet that trust was so\nwoefully misplaced. 'My leaving him at the present moment is, I\nfear, impossible.'\n\n'Do you bandy words with me, you ungrateful man?' said she. 'My\nlord, will you do me the favour to beg Mr Slope to leave the room?'\n\nMy lord scratched his head, but for the moment said nothing. This\nwas as much as Mr Slope expected from him, and was on the whole,\nfor him, an active exercise of marital rights.\n\n'My lord,' said the lady, 'is Mr Slope to leave this room, or am\nI?'\n\nHere Mrs Proudie made a false step. She should not have alluded to\nthe possibility of retreat on her part. She should not have\nexpressed the idea that her order for Mr Slope's expulsion could be\ntreated otherwise than by immediate obedience. In answer to such a\nquestion the bishop naturally said in his own mind, that it was\nnecessary that one should leave the room, perhaps it might be as\nwell that Mrs Proudie did so. He did say so in his own mind, but\nexternally he again scratched his head and again twiddled his\nthumbs.\n\nMrs Proudie was boiling over with wrath. Alas, alas! could she but\nhave kept her temper as her enemy did, she would have conquered as\nshe had ever conquered. But divine anger got the better of her, as\nit has done of other heroines, and she fell.\n\n'My lord,' said she, 'am I to be vouchsafed an answer or am I not?'\n\nAt last he broke his deep silence and proclaimed himself a\nSlopeite. 'Why, my dear,' said he, 'Mr Slope and I are very busy.'\n\nThat was all. There was nothing more necessary. He had gone to the\nbattle-field, stood the dust and heat of the day, encountered the\nfury of the foe, and won the victory. How easy is success to those\nwho will only be true to themselves!\n\nMr Slope saw at once the full amount of his gain, and turned on the\nvanquished lady a look of triumph which she never forgot and never\nforgave. Here he was wrong. He should have looked humbly at her,\nand with meek entreating eye had deprecated her anger. He should\nhave said by his glance that he asked pardon for his success, and\nthat he hoped forgiveness for the stand which he had been forced to\nmake in the cause of duty. So might he perchance have somewhat\nmollified that imperious bosom, and prepared the way for future\nterms. But Mr Slope meant to rule without terms. Ah, forgetful,\ninexperienced man! Can you cause that little trembling victim to be\ndivorced from the woman who possesses him? Can you provide that\nthey shall be separated at bed and board? Is he not flesh of her\nflesh and bone of her bone, and must he not so continue? It is very\nwell now for you to stand your ground, and triumph as she is driven\nignominiously from the room; but can you be present when those\ncurtains are drawn, when that awful helmet of proof has been tied\nbeneath the chin, when the small remnants of the bishop's prowess\nshall be cowed by the tassel above his head? Can you then intrude\nyourself when the wife wishes 'to speak to my lord alone?'\n\nBut for the moment Mr Slope's triumph was complete; for Mrs Proudie\nwithout further parley left the room, and did not forget to shut\nthe door after her. Then followed a close conference between the\nnew allies, to which was said much which it astonished Mr Slope to\nsay and the bishop to hear. And yet the one said it and the other\nheard it without ill will. There was no mincing of matters now. The\nchaplain plainly told the bishop that the world gave him credit for\nbeing under the governance of his wife; that his credit and\ncharacter in the diocese was suffering; that he would surely get\nhimself into hot water if he allowed Mrs Proudie to interfere in\nmatters which were not suitable for a woman's powers; and in fact\nthat he would become contemptible if he did not throw off the yoke\nunder which he groaned. The bishop at first hummed and hawed, and\naffected to deny the truth of what was said. But his denial was by\nsilence and quickly broke down. He soon admitted by silence his\nstate of vassalage, and pledged himself with Mr Slope's assistance,\nto change his courses. Mr Slope did not make out a bad case for\nhimself. He explained how it grieved him to run counter to a lady\nwho had always been his patroness, who had befriended him in so\nmany ways, who had, in fact, recommended him to the bishop's\nnotice; but, as he stated, his duty was now imperative; he held a\nsituation of peculiar confidence, and was immediately and\nespecially attached to the bishop's person. In such a situation his\nconscience required that he should regard solely the bishop's\ninterests, and therefore he had ventured to speak out.\n\nThe bishop took this for what it was worth, and Mr Slope only\nintended that he should do so. It gilded the pill which Mr Slope\nhad to administer, and which the bishop thought would be less\nbitter than that other pill which he had been so long taking.\n\n'My lord,' had his immediate reward, like a good child. He was\ninstructed to write and at once did write another note to the\narchbishop accepting his grace's invitation. This note Mr Slope,\nmore prudent than the lady, himself took away and posted with his\nown hands. Thus he made sure that this act of self-jurisdiction\nshould be as nearly as possible a fait accompli. He begged, and\ncoaxed, and threatened the bishop with a view of making him also\nwrite at once to Mr Harding; but the bishop, though temporarily\nemancipated from his wife, was not yet enthralled to Mr Slope. He\nsaid, and probably said truly, that such an offer must be made in\nsome official form; that he was not yet prepared to sign the form;\nand that he should prefer seeing Mr Harding before he did so. Mr\nSlope, might, however, beg Mr Harding to call upon him. Not\ndisappointed with his achievement Mr Slope went his way. He first\nposted the precious note which he had in his pocket, and then\npursued other enterprises in which we must follow him in other\nchapters.\n\nMrs Proudie, having received such satisfaction as was to be derived\nfrom slamming her husband's door, did not at once betake herself to\nMrs Quiverful. Indeed for the first few moments after her repulse\nshe felt that she could not again see that lady. She would have to\nown that she had been beaten, to confess that the diadem had passed\nfrom her brow, and the sceptre from her hand! No, she would send a\nmessage to her with the promise of a letter on the next day or the\nday after. Thus resolving, she betook herself to her bed-room; but\nhere she again changed her mind. The air of that sacred enclosure\nrestored her courage, and gave her some heart. As Achilles warmed\nat the sight of his armour, as Don Quixote's heart grew strong when\nhe grasped his lance, so did Mrs Proudie look forward to fresh\nlaurels, as her hey fell on her husband's pillow. She would not\ndespair. Having so resolved, she descended with dignified mien and\nrefreshed countenance to Mrs Quiverful.\n\nThis scene in the bishop's study took longer in the acting than in\nthe telling. We have not, perhaps, had the whole of the\nconversation. At any rate Mrs Quiverful was beginning to be very\nimpatient, and was thinking that farmer Subsoil would be tired of\nwaiting for her, when Mrs Proudie returned. Oh! Who can tell the\npalpitations of that maternal heart, as the suppliant looked into\nthe face of the great lady to see written there either a promise of\na house, income, comfort, and future competence, or else the doom\nof continued and ever increasing poverty. Poor mother! Poor wife!\nThere was little there to comfort you!\n\n'Mrs Quiverful,' thus spoke the lady with considerable austerity,\nand without sitting down herself. 'I find that your husband has\nbehaved in this matter in a very weak and foolish manner.'\n\nMrs Quiverful immediately rose upon her feet, thinking it\ndisrespectful to remain sitting while the wife of the bishop stood.\nBut she was desired to sit down again, and made to do so, so that\nMrs Proudie might stand and preach over her. It is generally\nconsidered an offensive thing for a gentleman to keep his seat\nwhile another is kept standing before him, and we presume the same\nlaw holds with regard to ladies. It often is so felt; but we are\ninclined to say that it never produces half the discomfort or half\nthe feeling of implied inferiority that is shown by a great man who\ndesires his visitor to be seated while he himself speaks from his\nlegs. Such a solecism in good breeding, when construed into English\nmeans this: \"The accepted rule of courtesy in the world require\nthat I should offer you a seat; if I did not do so, you would bring\na charge against me in the world of being arrogant and\nill-mannered; I will obey the world; but, nevertheless, I will not\nput myself on an equality with you. You may sit down, but I won't\nsit with you. Sit, therefore, at my bidding, and I'll stand and\ntalk to you.\"\n\nThis was just what Mrs Proudie meant to say; and Mrs Quiverful,\nthough she was too anxious and too flurried thus to translate the\nfull meaning of the manoeuvre, did not fail to feel its effect. She\nwas cowed and uncomfortable, and a second time essayed to rise from\nher chair.\n\n'Pray be seated, Mrs Quiverful, pray keep your seat. Your husband,\nI say, has been most weak and most foolish. It is impossible, Mrs\nQuiverful, to help people who will not help themselves. I much fear\nthat I can now do nothing for you in this matter.'\n\n'Oh! Mrs Proudie--don't say so,' said the poor woman, again jumping\nup.\n\n'Pray be seated, Mrs Quiverful. I much fear that I can do nothing\nfurther for you in this matter. Your husband has, in a most\nunaccountable manner, taken upon himself to resign that which I was\nempowered to offer him. As a matter of course, the bishop expects\nthat his clergy shall know their own minds. What he may ultimately\ndo--what we may finally decide on doing--I cannot say. Knowing the\nextent of your family--'\n\n'Fourteen children, Mrs Proudie, fourteen of them! and hardly\nbread--barely bread! It's hard for the children of a clergyman,\nit's hard for one who has always done his duty respectably!' Not a\nword fell from her about herself; but the tears came running down\nher big coarse cheeks, on which the dust of the August road had\nleft its traces.\n\nMrs Proudie has not been portrayed in these pages as an agreeable\nor amiable lady. There has been no intention to impress the reader\nmuch in her favour. It is ordained that all novels should have a\nmale and female angel, and a male and female devil. If it be\nconsidered that this rule is obeyed in these pages, the latter\ncharacter must be supposed to have fallen to the lot of Mrs\nProudie. But she was not all devil. There was a heart inside that\nstiff-ribbed bodice, though not, perhaps, of large dimensions, and\ncertainly not easily accessible. Mrs Quiverful, however, did gain\naccess, and Mrs Proudie proved herself a woman. Whether it was the\nfourteen children with their probable bare bread and the possible\nbare backs, or the respectability of the father's work, or the\nmingled dust and tears on the mother's face, we will not pretend to\nsay. But Mrs Proudie was touched.\n\nShe did not show it as other women might have done. She did not\ngive Mrs Quiverful eau-de-Cologne, or order her a glass of wine.\nShe did not take her to her toilet table, and offer her the use of\nbrushes and combs, towels and water. She did not say soft little\nspeeches and coax her kindly with equanimity. Mrs Quiverful,\ndespite her rough appearance, would have been as amenable to such\nlittle tender cares as any lady in the land. But none such was\nforthcoming. Instead of that, Mrs Proudie slapped one hand upon the\nother, and declared--not with an oath; for as a lady and a\nSabbatarian and a she-bishop, she could not swear,--but with an\nadjuration, that 'she wouldn't have it done.'\n\nThe meaning of this was that she wouldn't have Mr Quiverful's\npromised appointment cozened away by the treachery of Mr Slope and\nthe weakness of her husband. This meaning she very soon explained\nto Mrs Quiverful.\n\n'Why was your husband such a fool,' said she, now dismounted from\nher high horse and sitting confidentially down close to her\nvisitor, 'as to take the bait which that man threw to him? If he\nhad not been so utterly foolish, nothing could have prevented your\ngoing to the hospital.'\n\nPoor Mrs Quiverful was ready enough with her own tongue in accusing\nher husband to his face of being soft, and perhaps she did not\nalways speak of him to her children quite so respectfully as she\nmight have done. But she did not like to hear him abused by others,\nand began to vindicate him, and to explain that of course he had\ntaken Mr Slope to be an emissary of Mrs Proudie herself; that Mr\nSlope was thought to be peculiarly her friend; and that, therefore,\nMr Quiverful would have been failing in respect to her had he\nassumed to doubt what Mr Slope had said.\n\nThus mollified Mrs Proudie again declared that she 'would not have\nit done,' and at last sent Mrs Quiverful home with an assurance\nthat, to the furthest stretch of her power and influence in the\npalace, the appointment of Mr Quiverful should be insisted upon. As\nshe repeated that word 'insisted', she thought of the bishop in his\nnight-cap, and with compressed lips slightly shook her head. Oh! my\naspiring pastors, divines to whose ears nolo episcopari are the\nsweetest of words, which of you would be a bishop on such terms as\nthese?\n\nMrs Quiverful got home in the farmer's cart, not indeed with a\nlight heart, but satisfied that she had done right in making her\nvisit.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nA LOVE SCENE\n\nMr Slope, as we have said, left the palace with a feeling of\nconsiderable triumph. Not that he thought that his difficulties\nwere over; he did not so deceive himself; but he felt that he had\nplayed his first move well, as well as the pieces on the board\nwould allow; and that he had nothing with which to reproach\nhimself. He first of all posted the letter to the archbishop, and\nhaving made that sure he proceeded to push the advantage which he\nhad gained. Had Mrs Bold been at home, he would have called on her;\nbut he knew that she was at Plumstead, as he wrote the following\nnote. It was the beginning of what, he trusted, might be a long and\ntender series of epistles.\n\n'My dear Mrs Bold,--You will understand perfectly that I cannot at\npresent correspond with your father. I heartily wish that I could,\nand hope the day may be not long distant, when mists shall have\ncleared away, and we may know each other. But I cannot preclude\nmyself from the pleasure of sending you these few lines to say that\nMr Q. has to-day, in my presence, resigned any title that he ever\nhad to the wardenship of the hospital, and that the bishop has\nassured me that it is his intention to offer it to your esteemed\nfather.\n\n'Will you, with my respectful compliments, ask him, who I believe\nis a fellow visitor with you, to call on the bishop either on\nWednesday or Thursday, between ten and one. This is by the bishop's\ndesire. If you will so far oblige me as to let me have a line\nnaming either day, and the hour which will suit Mr Harding, I will\ntake care that the servants shall have orders to show him in\nwithout delay. Perhaps I should say no more,--but still I wish you\ncould make your father understand that no subject will be mooted\nbetween his lordship and him, which will refer at all to the method\nin which he may choose to perform his duty. I for one, am persuaded\nthat no clergyman could perform it more satisfactorily than he did,\nor than he will do again.\n\n'On a former occasion I was indiscreet and much too impatient,\nconsidering your father's age and my own. I hope he will not now\nrefuse my apology. I still hope also that with your aid and sweet\npious labours, we may live to attach such a Sabbath school to the\nold endowment, as may, by God's grace and furtherance, be a\nblessing to the poor of this city.\n\n'You will see at once that this letter is confidential. The\nsubject, of course, makes it so. But, equally, of course, it is for\nyour parent's eye as well as for your own, should you think it\nproper to show it to him.\n\n'I hope my darling little friend Johnny is as strong as ever,--\ndear little fellow. Does he still continue his rude assaults on\nthose beautiful long silken tresses?\n\n'I can assure your friends miss you from Barchester sorely; but it\nwould be cruel to begrudge you your sojourn among flowers and\nfields during this truly sultry weather.\n\n'Pray believe me, my dear Mrs Bold Yours most sincerely, 'OBADIAH\nSLOPE. 'Barchester, Friday.'\n\nNow this letter, taken as a whole, and with the consideration that\nMr Slope wished to assume a great degree of intimacy with Eleanor,\nwould not have been bad, but for the allusion to the tresses.\nGentlemen do not write to ladies about their tresses, unless they\nare on very intimate terms indeed. But Mr Slope could not be\nexpected to be aware of this. He longed to put a little affection\ninto his epistle, and yet he thought it injudicious, as the letter\nwould he knew be shown to Mr Harding. He would have insisted that\nthe letter should be strictly private and seen by no eyes but\nEleanor's own, had he not felt that such an injunction would have\nbeen disobeyed. He therefore restrained his passion, did not sign\nhimself 'yours affectionately,' and contented himself instead with\nthe compliment to the tresses.\n\nWe will now follow his letter. He took it to Mrs Bold's house, and\nlearning there, from the servant, that things were to be sent out\nto Plumstead that afternoon, left it, with many injunctions, in her\nhands.\n\nWe will now follow Mr Slope so as to complete the day with him, and\nthen return to his letter and its momentous fate in the next\nchapter.\n\nThere is an old song which gives us some very good advice about\ncourting:--\n\n      \"It's gude to be off with the auld luve\n       Before ye be on wi' the new.\"\n\nOf the wisdom of this maxim Mr Slope was ignorant, and accordingly,\nhaving written his letter to Mrs Bold, he proceeded to call upon\nthe Signora Neroni. Indeed it was hard to say which was the old\nlove and which was the new, Mr Slope having been smitten with both\nso nearly at the same time. Perhaps he thought it not amiss to have\ntwo strings to his bow. But two strings to Cupid's bow are always\ndangerous to him on whose behalf they are to be used. A man should\nremember that between two stools he may fall to the ground.\n\nBut in sooth Mr Slope was pursuing Mrs Bold in obedience to his\nbetter instincts, and the signora in obedience to his worse. Had he\nwon the widow and worn her, no one could have blamed him. You, O\nreader, and I, and Eleanor's other friends would have received the\nstory of such a winning with much disgust and disappointment; but\nwe should have been angry with Eleanor, not with Mr Slope. Bishop,\nmale and female, dean and chapter and diocesan clergy in full\ncongress, could have found nothing to disapprove of in such an\nalliance. Convocation itself, that mysterious and mighty synod,\ncould in no wise have fallen foul of it. The possession of L 1000 a\nyear and a beautiful wife would not al all have hurt the voice of\nthe pulpit character, or lessened the grace and piety of the\nexemplary clergyman.\n\nBut not of such a nature were likely to be his dealings with the\nSignora Neroni. In the first place he knew that her husband was\nliving, and therefore he could not woo her honestly. Then again she\nhad nothing to recommend her to his honest wooing had such been\npossible. She was not only portionless, but also from misfortune\nunfitted to be chosen as the wife of any man who wanted a useful\nmate. Mr Slope was aware that she was a helpless hopeless cripple.\n\nBut Mr Slope could not help himself. He knew that he was wrong in\ndevoting his time to the back drawing-room in Dr Stanhope's house.\nHe knew that what took place would if divulged utterly ruin him\nwith Mrs Bold. He knew that scandal would soon come upon his heels\nand spread abroad among the black coats of Barchester some tidings,\nsome exaggerated tidings, of the sighs which he poured into the\nlady's ears. He knew that he was acting against the recognised\nprinciples of his life, against those laws of conduct by which he\nhoped to achieve much higher success. But as we have said, he could\nnot help himself. Passion, for the first time in his life, passion\nwas too strong for him.\n\nAs for the signora, no such plea can be put forward for her, for in\ntruth, she cared no more for Mr Slope than she did for twenty\nothers who had been at her feet before him. She willingly, nay\ngreedily, accepted his homage. He was the finest fly that\nBarchester had hitherto afforded to her web; and the signora was a\npowerful spider that made wondrous webs, and could in no way live\nwithout catching flies. Her taste in this respect was abominable,\nfor she had no use for the victims when caught. She could not eat\nthem matrimonially as young lady-flies do whose webs are most\nfrequently of their mother's weaving. Nor could she devour them by\nany escapade of a less legitimate description. Her unfortunate\naffliction precluded her from all hope of levanting with a lover.\nIt would be impossible to run away with a lady who required three\nservants to move her from a sofa.\n\nThe signora was subdued by no passion. Her time for love was gone.\nShe had lived out her heart, such heart as she ever had ever had,\nin her early years, at an age when Mr Slope was thinking of his\nsecond book of Euclid and his unpaid bill at the buttery hatch. In\nage the lady was younger than the gentleman; but in feelings, in\nknowledge of the affairs of love, in intrigue, he was immeasurably\nher junior. It was necessary to her to have some man at her feet.\nIt was the one customary excitement of her life. She delighted in\nthe exercise of power which this gave her; it was now nearly the\nonly food for her ambition; she would boast to her sister that she\ncould make a fool of any man, and the sister, as little imbued with\nfeminine delicacy as herself, good naturedly thought it but fair\nthat such amusement should be afforded to a poor invalid who was\ndebarred from the ordinary pleasures of life.\n\nMr Slope was madly in love, but hardly knew it. The signora spitted\nhim, as a boy does a cockchafer on a cork, that she might enjoy the\nenergetic agony of his gyrations. And she knew very well what she\nwas doing.\n\nMr Slope having added to his person all such adornments as are\npossible to a clergyman making a morning visit, such as a clean\nneck tie, clean handkerchief, new gloves, and a soupcon of not\nnecessary scent, called about three o'clock at the doctor's house.\nAt about this hour the signora was almost always in the back\ndrawing-room. The mother had not come down. The doctor was out or\nin his own room. Bertie was out, and Charlotte at any rate left the\nroom if any one called whose object was specially with her sister.\nSuch was her idea of being charitable and sisterly.\n\nMr Slope, as was his custom, asked for Mr Stanhope, and was told,\nas was the servant's custom, that the signora was in the\ndrawing-room. Upstairs he accordingly went. He found her, as he\nalways did, lying on her sofa with a French volume before her, and\na beautiful little inlaid writing case open on her table. At the\nmoment of his entrance she was in the act of writing.\n\n'Ah, my friend,' said she, putting out her left hand to him across\nthe desk, 'I did not expect you to-day and was this very instant\nwriting to you--'\n\nMr Slope, taking the soft fair delicate hand in his, and very soft\nand fair and delicate it was, bowed over it his huge red head and\nkissed it. It was a sight to see, a deed to record if the author\ncould fitly do it, a picture to put on canvas. Mr Slope was big,\nawkward, cumbrous, and having his heart in his pursuit was ill at\nease. The lady was fair, as we have said, and delicate; every thing\nabout her was fine and refined; her hand in his looked like a rose\nlying among carrots, and when he kissed it he looked as a cow might\ndo on finding such a flower among her food. She was graceful as a\ncouchant goddess, and, moreover, as self-possessed as Venus must\nhave been when courting Adonis.\n\nOh, that such grace and such beauty should have condescended to\nwaste itself on such a pursuit!\n\n'I was in the act of writing to you,' said she, 'but now my scrawl\nmay go into the basket;' and she raised the sheet of gilded note\npaper from off her desk as though to tear it.\n\n'Indeed it shall not,' said he, laying the embargo of half a stone\nweight of human flesh and blood upon the devoted paper. 'Nothing\nthat you write for my eyes, signora, shall be so desecrated,' and\nhe took up the letter, put that also among the carrots and fed on\nit, and then proceeded to read it.\n\n'Gracious me! Mr Slope,' said she. 'I hope you don't mean to say\nthat you keep all the trash I write to you. Half my time I don't\nknow what I write, and when I do, I know it is only fit for the\nblack of the fire. I hope you have not that ugly trick of keeping\nletters.'\n\n'At any rate I don't throw them into a waste-paper basket. If\ndestruction is their doomed lot, they perish worthily, and are\nburnt on a pyre, as Dido was of old.'\n\n'With a steel pen stuck through them, of course,' said she, 'to\nmake the simile more complete. Of all the ladies of my acquaintance\nI think Lady Dido was the most absurd. Why did she not do as\nCleopatra did? Why did she not take out her ships and insist on\ngoing with him? She could not bear to lose the land she had got by\na swindle; and then she could not bear the loss of her lover. So\nshe fell between two stools. Mr Slope, whatever you do, never\nmingle love and business.'\n\nMr Slope blushed up to his eyes, and over his mottled forehead to\nthe very roots of his hair. He felt sure that the signora knew all\nabout his intentions with reference to Mrs Bold. His conscience\ntold him that he was detected. His doom was to be spoken; he was to\nbe punished for his duplicity, and rejected by the beautiful\ncreature before him. Poor man. He little dreamt that had all his\nintentions with reference to Mrs Bold been known to the signora, it\nwould only have added zest to that lady's amusement. It was all\nvery well to have Mr Slope at her feet, to show her power by making\nan utter fool of a clergyman, to gratify her own infidelity by thus\nproving the little strength which religion had in controlling the\npassions even of a religious man; but it would be an increased\ngratification if she could be made to understand that she was at\nthe same time alluring her victim away from another, whose love if\nsecured would be in every way beneficial and salutary.\n\nThe signora had indeed discovered with the keen instinct of such a\nwoman, that Mr Slope was bent on matrimony with Mrs Bold, but in\nalluding to Dido she had not thought of it. She instantly\nperceived, however, from her lover's blushes, what was on his mind,\nand was not slow in taking advantage of it.\n\nShe looked at him full in the face, not angrily, nor yet with a\nsmile, but with an intense and overpowering gaze; and then holding\nup her forefinger, and slightly shaking her head she said:-\n'Whatever you do, my friend, do not mingle love and business.\nEither stick to your treasure and your city of wealth, or else\nfollow your love like a true man. But never attempt both. If you\ndo, you'll have to die with a broken heart as did poor Dido. Which\nis it to be with you, Mr Slope, love or money?'\n\nMr Slope was not so ready with a pathetic answer as he usually was\nwith touching episodes in his extempore sermons. He felt that he\nought to say something pretty, something also that should remove\nthe impression on the mind of his lady love. But he was rather put\nabout how to do it.\n\n'Love,' said he, 'true overpowering love, must be the strongest\npassion a man can feel; it must control every other wish, and put\naside every other pursuit. But with me love will never act in that\nway unless it is returned;' and he threw upon the signora a look of\ntenderness which was intended to make up for all the deficiencies\nof his speech.\n\n'Take my advice,' said she. 'Never mind love. After all, what is\nit? The dream of a few weeks. That is all its joy. The\ndisappointment of a life is its Nemesis. Who was ever successful in\ntrue love? Success in love argues that the love is false. True love\nis always despondent or tragical. Juliet loved. Haidee loved. Dido\nloved, and what came of it? Troilus loved and ceased to be a man.'\n\n'Troilus loved and he was fooled,' said the more manly chaplain. 'A\nman may love and yet not be a Troilus. All women are not Cressids.'\n\n'No; all women are not Cressids. The falsehood is not always on the\nwoman's side. Imogen was true, but now was she rewarded? Her lord\nbelieved her to be the paramour of the first he who came near her\nin his absence. Desdemona was true and was smothered. Ophelia was\ntrue and went mad. There is no happiness in love, except at the end\nof an English novel. But in wealth, money, houses, lands, goods and\nchattels, in the good things of this world, yes, in them there is\nsomething tangible, something that can be retained and enjoyed.'\n\n'Oh, no,' said Mr Slope, feeling himself bound to enter some\nprotest against so very unorthodox a doctrine, 'this world's wealth\nwill make no one happy.'\n\n'And what will make you happy--you--you?' said she, raising herself\nup, and speaking to him with energy across the table. 'From what\nsource do you look for happiness? Do not say that you look for\nnone? I shall not believe you. It is a search in which every human\nbeing spends an existence.'\n\n'And the search is always in vain,' said Mr Slope. 'We look for\nhappiness on earth, while we ought to be content to hope for it in\nheaven.'\n\n'Pshaw! you preach a doctrine which you know you don't believe. It\nis the way with you all. If you know that there is no earthly\nhappiness, why do you long to be a bishop or a dean? Why do you\nwant lands and income?'\n\n'I have the natural ambition of a man,' said he.\n\n'Of course you have, and the natural passions; and therefore I say\nthat you don't believe the doctrine you preach. St Paul was an\nenthusiast. He believed so that his ambition and passions did not\nwar against his creed. So does the Eastern fanatic who passes half\nhis life erect upon a pillar. As for me, I will believe in no\nbelief that does not make itself manifest by outward signs. I will\nthink no preaching sincere that is not recommended by the practice\nof the preacher.'\n\nMr Slope was startled and horrified, but he felt that he could not\nanswer. How could he stand up and preach the lessons of his Master,\nbeing there as he was, on the devil's business? He was a true\nbeliever, otherwise this would have been nothing to him. He had\naudacity for most things, but he had not audacity to make a\nplaything of the Lord's word. All this the signora understood, and\nfelt much interest as she saw her cockchafer whirl round upon her\npin.\n\n'Your wit delights in such arguments,' said he, 'but your heart and\nyour reason do not quite go along with them.'\n\n'My heart!' said she; 'you quite mistake the principles of my\ncomposition if you imagine that there is such a thing about me.'\nAfter all, there was very little that was false in anything the\nsignora said. If Mr Slope allowed himself to be deceived it was his\nown fault. Nothing could have been more open than her declarations\nabout herself.\n\nThe little writing table with her desk was still standing before\nher, a barrier, as it were, against the enemy. She was sitting as\nnearly upright as she ever did, and he had brought a chair close to\nthe sofa, so that there was only the corner of the table between\nhim and her. It so happened that as she spoke her hand lay upon the\ntable, and as Mr Slope answered her he put his hand upon hers.\n\n'No heart!' said he. 'That is a very heavy charge which you bring\nagainst yourself, and one of which I cannot find you guilty--'\n\nShe withdrew her hand, not quickly and angrily, as though insulted\nby his touch, but gently and slowly.\n\n'You are in no condition to give a verdict on the matter,' said\nshe, 'as you have not tried me. No; don't say that you intend doing\nso, for you know you have no intention of the kind; nor indeed have\nI either. As for you, you will take your vows where they will\nresult in something more substantial than the pursuit of such a\nghostlike, ghastly love as mine--'\n\n'Your love should be sufficient to satisfy the dream of a monarch,'\nsaid Mr Slope, not quite clear as to the meaning of his words.\n\n'Say an archbishop, Mr Slope,' said she. Poor fellow! She was very\ncruel to him. He went round again upon his cork on this allusion to\nhis profession. He tried, however, to smile, and gently accused her\nof joking on a matter, which was, he said, to him of such vital\nmoment.\n\n'Why--what gulls do you men make of us,' she replied. 'How you fool\nus to the top of our bent; and of all men you clergymen are the\nmost fluent of your honeyed caressing words. Now look me in the\nface, Mr Slope, boldly and openly.'\n\nMr Slope did look at her with a languishing loving eye, and as he\ndid so, he again put forth his hand to get hold of hers.\n\n'I told you to look at me boldly, Mr Slope; but confine your\nboldness to your eyes.'\n\n'Oh, Madeline,' he sighed.\n\n'Well, my name is Madeline,' said she; 'but none except my own\nfamily usually call me so. Now look me in the face, Mr Slope. Am I\nto understand that you say you love me?'\n\nMr Slope never had said so. If he had come there with any formed\nplan at all, his intention was to make love to the lady without\nuttering any such declaration. It was, however, quite impossible\nthat he should now deny his love. He had, therefore, nothing for\nit, but to go down on his knees distractedly against the sofa, and\nswear that he did love her with a love passing the love of man.'\n\nThe signora received the assurance with very little palpitations or\nappearance of surprise. 'And now answer me another question,' said\nshe; 'when are you to be married to Eleanor Bold?'\n\nPoor Mr Slope went round and round in mortal agony. In such a\ncondition as his it was really very hard for him to know what\nanswer to give. And yet no answer would be his surest condemnation.\nHe might as well at once plead guilty to the charge brought against\nhim.\n\n'And why do you accuse me of such dissimulation?'\n\n'Dissimulation! I said nothing of dissimulation. I made no charge\nagainst you, and make none. Pray don't defend yourself to me. You\nswear that you are devoted to my beauty, and yet you are on the eve\nof matrimony with another. I feel this to be rather a compliment.\nIt is to Mrs Bold that you must defend yourself. That you may find\ndifficult; unless, indeed, you can keep her in the dark. You\nclergymen are cleverer than other men.'\n\n'Signora, I have told you that I loved you, and now you rail at\nme?'\n\n'Rail at you. God bless the man; what would he have? Come, answer\nme this at your leisure,--not without thinking now, but leisurely\nand with consideration,--are you not going to be married to Mrs\nBold?'\n\n'I am not,' said he. And as he said it, he almost hated, with an\nexquisite hatred, the woman whom he could not help loving with an\nexquisite love.\n\n'But surely you are a worshipper of hers?'\n\n'I am not,' said Mr Slope, to whom the word worshipper was\npeculiarly distasteful. The signora had conceived that it would be\nso.\n\n'I wonder at that,' said she. 'Do you not admire her? To my eyes\nshe is the perfection of English beauty. And then she is rich too.\nI should have thought she was just the person to attract you. Come,\nMr Slope, let me give you advice on this matter. Marry the charming\nwidow! She will be a good mother to your children and an excellent\nmistress of a clergyman's household.'\n\n'Oh, signora, how can you be so cruel?'\n\n'Cruel,' said she, changing the voice of her banter which she had\nbeen using for one which was expressively earnest in its tone; 'is\nthat cruelty?'\n\n'How can I love another, while my heart is entirely your own?'\n\n'If that were cruelty, Mr Slope, what might you say of me if I were\nto declare that I returned your passion? What would you think if I\nbound you even by a lover's oath to do daily penance at this couch\nof mine? What can I give in return for a man's love? Ah, dear\nfriend, you have not realised the condition of my fate.'\n\nMr Slope was not on his knees all this time. After his declaration\nof love he had risen from them as quickly as he thought consistent\nwith the new position which he now filled, and as he stood was\nleaning on the back of his chair. This outburst of tenderness on\nthe Signora's part quite overcame him, and made him feel for the\nmoment that he could sacrifice everything to be assured of the love\nof the beautiful creature before him, maimed, lame, and already\nmarried as she was.\n\n'And can I not sympathise with your lot?' said he, now seating\nhimself on her sofa, and pushing away the table with his foot.\n\n'Sympathy is so near to pity!' said she. 'If you pity me, cripple\nas I am, I shall spurn you from me.'\n\n'Oh, Madeline, I will only love you,' and again he caught her hand\nand devoured it with kisses. Now she did not draw from him, but sat\nthere as he kissed it, looking at him with her great eyes, just as\na great spider would look at a great fly that was quite securely\ncaught.\n\n'Suppose Signor Neroni were to come to Barchester,' said she,\n'would you make his acquaintance?'\n\n'Signor Neroni!' said he.\n\n'Would you introduce him to the bishop, and Mrs Proudie, and the\nyoung ladies?' said she, again having recourse to that horrid\nquizzing voice which Mr Slope so particularly hated.\n\n'Why do you ask me such a question?' said he.\n\n'Because it is necessary that you should know that there is a\nSignor Neroni. I think you had forgotten it.'\n\n'If I thought that you retained for that wretch one particle of the\nlove of which he was never worthy, I would die before I would\ndistract you by telling you what I feel. No! were your husband the\nmaster of your heart, I might perhaps love you; but you should\nnever know it.'\n\n'My heart again! How you talk. And you consider then, that if a\nhusband be not master of his wife's heart, he has not right to her\nfealty; if a wife ceases to love, she may cease to be true. Is that\nyour doctrine on this matter, as a minister of the Church of\nEngland?'\n\nMr Slope tried hard within himself to cast off the pollution with\nwhich he felt that he was defiling his soul. He strove to tear\nhimself away from the noxious siren that had bewitched him. He had\nlooked for rapturous joy in loving this lovely creature, and he\nalready found that he met with little but disappointment and\nself-rebuke. He had come across the fruits of the Dead Sea, so\nsweet and delicious to the eye, so bitter and nauseous to the\ntaste. He had put the apple to his mouth, and it had turned to\nashes between his teeth. Yet he could not tear himself away. He\nknew, he could not but know, that weakness of his religion. But she\nhalf permitted his adoration, and that half permission added such\nfuel to his fire that all the fountain of piety could not quench\nit. He began to feel savage, irritated, and revengeful. He\nmeditated some severity of speech, some taunt that should cut her,\nas her taunts cut him. He reflected as he stood there for a moment,\nsilent before her, that if he desired to quell her proud spirit, he\nshould do so by being prouder even than herself; that if he wished\nto have her at his feet suppliant for his love it behoved him to\nconquer her by indifference. All this passed through his mind. As\nfar as dead knowledge went, he knew, or thought he knew, how a\nwoman should be tamed. But when he essayed to bring his tactics to\nbear, he failed like a child. What chance has dead knowledge with\nexperience in any of the transactions between man and man? What\npossible between man and woman? Mr Slope loved furiously, insanely,\nand truly; but he had never played the game of love. The signora\ndid not love at all, but she was up to every move on the board. It\nwas Philidor pitched against a school-boy.\n\nAnd so she continued to insult him, and he continued to bear it.\n\n'Sacrifice the world for love!' said she, in answer to some renewed\nrapid declaration of his passion, 'how often has the same thing\nbeen said, and how invariably with the same falsehood!'\n\n'Falsehood,' said he. 'Do you say that I am false to you? Do you\nsay that my love is not real?'\n\n'False? Of course it is false, false as the father of falsehood--if\nindeed falsehoods need a sire and are not self-begotten since the\nworld began. You are ready to sacrifice the world for love? Come\nlet us see what you will sacrifice. I care nothing for nuptial\nvows. The wretch, I think you were kind enough to call him so, whom\nI swore to love and obey, is so base that he can only be thought of\nwith repulsive disgust. In the council chamber of my heart I have\ndivorced him. To me that is as good as though aged lords had\ngloated for months over the details of his licentious life. I care\nnothing for what the world can say. Will you be as frank? Will you\ntake me to your home as your wife? Will you call me Mrs Slope\nbefore bishop, dean, and prebendaries?' The poor tortured wretch\nstood silent, not knowing what to say. 'What! You won't do that.\nTell me then, what part of the world is it that you will sacrifice\nfor my charms?'\n\n'Were you free to marry, I would take you to my house to-morrow and\nwish no higher privilege.'\n\n'I am free;' said she, almost starting up in her energy. For though\nthere was no truth in her pretended regard for her clerical\nadmirer, there was a mixture of real feeling in the scorn and\nsatire with which she spoke of love and marriage generally. 'I am\nfree; free as the winds. Come, will you take me as I am? Have your\nwish; sacrifice the world, and prove yourself a true man.'\n\nMr Slope should have taken her at her word. She would have drawn\nback, and he would have had the full advantage of the offer. But he\ndid not. Instead of doing so, he stood wrapt in astonishment,\npassing his fingers through his lank red hair, and thinking as he\nstared upon her animated countenance that her wondrous beauty grew\nmore and more wonderful as he gazed on it. 'Ha! Ha! Ha!,' she\nlaughed out loud. 'Come, Mr Slope, don't talk of sacrificing the\nworld again. People beyond one-and-twenty should never dream of\nsuch a thing. You and I, if we have the dregs of any love left in\nus, if we have the remnants of a passion remaining in our hearts,\nshould husband our resources better. We are not in our premiere\njeunesse. The world is a very nice place. Your world, at any rate,\nis so. You have all manner of fat rectories to get, and possible\nbishoprics to enjoy. Come, confess; on second thoughts you would\nnot sacrifice such things for the smiles of a lame lady?'\n\nIt was impossible for him to answer this. In order to be in any way\ndignified, he felt that he must be silent.\n\n'Come,' said she--'don't boody with me: don't be angry because I\nspeak out some home truths. Alas, the world, as I have found it,\nhas taught me bitter truths. Come, tell me that I am forgiven. Are\nwe not to be friends?' and she again put her hand to him.\n\nHe sat himself down on the chair beside her, and took her proffered\nhand and leant over her.\n\n'There,' said she, with her sweetest, softest smile--a smile to\nwithstand which a man should be cased in triple steel, 'there; seal\nyour forgiveness on it,' and she raised it towards his face. He\nkissed it again and again, and stretched over her as though\ndesirous of extending the charity of his pardon beyond the hand\nthat was offered to him. She managed, however, to check his ardour.\nFor one so easily allured as this poor chaplain, her hand was\nsurely enough.\n\n'Oh, Madeline!' said he, 'tell me that you love me--do you--do you\nlove me?'\n\n'Hush,' said she. 'There is mother's step. Our tete-a-tete has been\nof monstrous length. Now you had better go. But we shall see you\nsoon again, shall we not?'\n\nMr Slope promised that he would call again on the following day.\n\n'And Mr Slope,' she continued, 'pray answer my note. You have it in\nyour hand, though, I declare during these two hours you have not\nbeen gracious enough to read it. It is about the Sabbath school and\nthe children. You know how anxious I am to have them here. I have\nbeen learning the catechism myself, on purpose. You must manage it\nfor me next week. I will teach them, at any rate, to submit\nthemselves to their spiritual pastors and masters.'\n\nMr Slope said but little on the subject of Sabbath schools, but he\nmade his adieu, and betook himself home with a sad heart, troubled\nmind, and uneasy conscience.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nMRS BOLD IS ENTERTAINED BY DR AND MRS GRANTLY AT PLUMSTEAD\n\nIt will be remembered that Mr Slope, when leaving his billet doux\nwith Mrs Bold, had been informed that it would be sent out to her\nat Plumstead that afternoon. The archdeacon and Mr Harding had in\nfact come into town together in the brougham, and it had been\narranged that they should call for Eleanor's parcels as they left\non their way home. Accordingly they did so call, and the maid, as\nshe handed to the coachman a small basket and large bundle\ncarefully and neatly packec, gave in at the carriage window Mr\nSlope's epistle. The archdeacon, who was sitting next to the\nwindow, took it, and immediately recognised the hand-writing of his\nenemy.\n\n'Who left this?' said he.\n\n'Mr Slope called with it himself, your reverence,' said the girl; '\nand was very anxious that missus should have it to-day.'\n\nSo the brougham drove off, and the letter was left in the\narchdeacon's hand. He looked at it as though he held a basket of\nadders. He could not have thought worse of the document had he read\nit and discovered it to be licentious and atheistical. He did,\nmoreover, what so many wise people are accustomed to do in similar\ncircumstances; he immediately condemned the person to whom the\nletter was written, as though she were necessarily a particeps\ncriminis.\n\nPoor Mr Harding, though by no means inclined to forward Mr Slope's\nintimacy with his daughter, would have given anything to have kept\nthe letter from his son-in-law. But that was now impossible. There\nit was in his hand; and he looked as thoroughly disgusted as though\nhe were quite sure that it contained all the rhapsodies of a\nfavoured lover.\n\n'It's very hard on me,' said he, after a while, 'that this should\ngo on under my roof.'\n\nNow here the archdeacon was certainly the most unreasonable. Having\ninvited his sister-in-law to his house, it was a natural\nconsequence of that she should receive her letters there. And if Mr\nSlope chose to write to her, his letter would, as a matter of\ncourse, be sent after her. Moreover, the very fact of an invitation\nto one's house implies confidence on the part of the inviter. He\nhad shown that he thought Mrs Bold to be a fit person to stay with\nhim by his making her to do so, and it was most cruel to her that\nhe should complain of her violating the sanctity of his roof-tree,\nwhen the laches committed were none of her committing.\n\nMr Harding felt this; and felt also that when the archdeacon talked\nthus about his roof, what he said was most offensive to himself as\nEleanor's father. If Eleanor did receive a letter from Mr Slope,\nwhat was there in that to pollute the purity of Dr Grantly's\nhousehold. He was indignant that his daughter should be so judged\nand so spoken of; and, he made up his mind that even as Mrs Slope\nshe must be dearer to him than any other creature on God's earth.\nHe almost broke out, and said as much; but for the moment he\nrestrained himself.\n\n'Here,' said the archdeacon, handing the offensive missile to his\nfather-in-law; 'I am not going to be the bearer of his love\nletters. You are her father, and may do as you think fit with it.'\n\nBy doing as he thought fit with it, the archdeacon certainly meant\nthat Mr Harding would be justified in opening and reading the\nletter, and taking any steps which might in consequence be\nnecessary. To tell the truth, Dr Grantly did feel rather a stronger\ncuriosity than was justified by his outraged virtue, to see the\ncontents of the letter. Of course he could not open it himself, but\nhe wished to make Mr Harding understand that he, as Eleanor's\nfather, would be fully justified in doing so. The idea of such a\nproceeding never occurred to Mr Harding. His authority over Eleanor\nceased when she became the wife of John Bold. He had not the\nslightest wish to pry into her correspondence. He consequently put\nthe letter into his pocket, and only wished that he had been able\nto do so without the archdeacon's knowledge. They both sat silent\nduring the journey home, and then Dr Grantly said, 'Perhaps Susan\nhad better give it to her. She can explain to her sister, better\nthan you or I can do, how deep is the disgrace of such an\nacquaintance.'\n\n'I think you are very hard upon Eleanor,' replied Mr Harding. 'I\nwill not allow that she has disgraced herself, nor do I think it\nlikely that she will do so. She has a right to correspond with whom\nshe pleases, and I shall not take upon myself to blame her because\nshe gets a letter from Slope.'\n\n'I suppose,' said Dr Grantly, 'you don't wish her to marry this\nman. I suppose you'll admit that she would disgrace herself if she\ndid so.'\n\n'I do not wish her to marry him,' said the perplexed father; 'I do\nnot like him, and do not think he would make a good husband. But if\nEleanor decides to do so, I shall certainly not think that she has\ndisgraced herself.'\n\n'Good heavens!' exclaimed Dr Grantly, and threw himself back into\nthe corner of his brougham. Mr Harding said nothing more, but\ncommenced playing a dirge, with an imaginary fiddle bow upon an\nimaginary violoncello, for which there did not appear to be quite\nroom enough in the carriage; and he continued the tune, with sundry\nvariations, till he arrived at the rectory door.\n\nThe archdeacon had been meditating sad things in his mind. Hitherto\nhe had always looked on his father-in-law as a true partisan,\nthough he knew him to be a man devoid of all the combative\nqualifications for that character. He had felt no fear that Mr\nHarding would go over to the enemy, though he had never counted\nmuch on the ex-warden's prowess in breaking the battle ranks. Now,\nhowever, it seemed that Eleanor, with her wiles, had completely\ntrepanned and bewildered her father, cheated him out of his\njudgement, robbed him of the predilections and tastes of life, and\ncaused him to be tolerant of a man whose arrogance and vulgarity\nwould, in a few years since, have been unendurable to him. That the\nwhole thing was as good as arranged between Eleanor and Mr Slope\nthere was no longer any room to doubt. That Mr Harding knew that\nsuch was the case, even this could hardly be doubted. It was too\nmanifest that he at any rate suspected it, and was prepared to\nsanction it.\n\nAnd to tell the truth, such was the case. Mr Harding disliked Mr\nSlope as much as it was in his nature to dislike any man. Had his\ndaughter wished to do her worst to displease him by a second\nmarriage, she could hardly have succeeded better than by marrying\nMr Slope. But, as he said to himself now very often, what right had\nhe to condemn her if she did nothing that was really wrong? If she\nliked Mr Slope it was her affair. It was indeed miraculous to him,\nthat a woman with such a mind, so educated, so refined, so nice in\nher tastes, should like such a man. Then he asked himself whether\nit was possible that she did so.\n\nAh, thou weak man; most charitable, most Christian, but weakest of\nmen! Why couldst thou not have asked herself? Was she not the\ndaughter of thy loins, the child of thy heart, the most beloved of\nthee of all humanity? Had she not proved to thee, by years of\nclosest affection, her truth and goodness and filial obedience? And\nyet, groping in darkness, hearing her name in strains which wounded\nthy loving heart, and being unable to defend her as thou shouldst\nhave done!\n\nMr Harding had not believed, did not believe, that his daughter\nmeant to marry this man; but he feared to commit himself to such an\nopinion. If she did do it there would be then no means of retreat.\nThe wishes of his heart were--First, that there should be no truth\nin the archdeacon's surmises; and in this wish he would have fain\ntrusted entirely, had he dared to do so; Secondly, that the match\nmight be prevented, if unfortunately, it had been contemplated by\nEleanor; Thirdly, that should she be so infatuated as to marry this\nman, he might justify his conduct, and declare that no cause\nexisted for his separating himself from her.\n\nHe wanted to believe her incapable of such a marriage; he wanted to\nshow that he so believed of her; but he wanted also to be able to\nsay hereafter, that she had done nothing amiss, if she could\nunfortunately prove herself to be different from what he thought\nher to be.\n\nNothing but affection could justify such fickleness; but affection\ndid justify it. There was but little of the Roman about Mr Harding.\nHe could not sacrifice his Lucretia even though she should be\npolluted by the accepted addresses of the clerical Tarquin at the\npalace. If Tarquin could be prevented, well and good; but if not,\nthe father would still open his heart to his daughter, and accept\nher as she present herself, Tarquin and all.\n\nDr Grantly's mind was of a stronger calibre, and he was by no means\ndeficient in heart. He loved with an honest genuine love his wife\nand children and friends. He loved his father-in-law; and he was\nquite prepared to love Eleanor too, if she would be one of his\nparty, if she would be on his side, if she would regard the Slopes\nand the Proudies as the enemies of mankind, and acknowledge and\nfeel the comfortable merits of the Gwynnes and Arabins. He wished\nto be what he called \"safe\" with all those whom he had admitted to\nthe penetralia of his house and heart. He could luxuriate in no\nsociety that was deficient in a certain feeling of faithful staunch\nhigh-churchism, which to him was tantamount to freemasonry. He was\nnot strict in his lines of definition. He endured without\nimpatience many different shades of Anglo-church conservatism; but\nwith the Slopes and Proudies he could not go on all fours.\n\nHe was wanting in, moreover, or perhaps it would be more correct to\nsay, he was not troubled by that womanly tenderness which was so\npeculiar to Mr Harding. His feelings towards his friends were, that\nwhile they stuck to him he would stick to them; that he would work\nwith them shoulder to shoulder; that he would be faithful to the\nfaithful. He knew nothing of that beautiful love which can be true\nto a false friend.\n\nAnd thus these two men, each miserable enough in his own way,\nreturned to Plumstead.\n\nIt was getting late when they arrived there, and the ladies had\nalready gone up to dress. Nothing more was said as the two parted\nin the hall. As Mr Harding passed to his own room, he knocked at\nEleanor's door and handed in the letter. The archdeacon hurried to\nhis own territory, there to unburden his heart to his faithful\npartner.\n\nWhat colloquy took place between the marital chamber and the\nadjoining dressing-room shall not be detailed. The reader, now\nintimate with the persons concerned, can well imagine it. The whole\ntenor of it also might be read in Mrs Grantly's brow as she came\ndown to dinner.\n\nEleanor, when she received the letter from her father's hand, had\nno idea from whom it came. She had never seen Mr Slope's\nhandwriting, or if so, had forgotten it; and did not think of him\nas she twisted the letter as people do twist letters when they do\nnot immediately recognise their correspondents either by the\nwriting or the seal. She was sitting at her glass brushing her\nhair, and rising every other minute to play with her boy who was\nsprawling on the bed, and who engaged pretty nearly the whole\nattention of the maid as well as of the mother.\n\nAt last, sitting before her toilet table, she broke the seal, and\nturning over the leaf saw Mr Slope's name. She first felt\nsurprised, and then annoyed, and then anxious. As she read it she\nbecame interested. She was so delighted to find that all obstacles\nto her father's return to the hospital were apparently removed that\nshe did not observe the fulsome language in which the tidings were\nconveyed. She merely perceived that she was commissioned to tell\nher father that such was the case, and she did not realise the fact\nthat such a commission should not have been made, in the first\ninstance, to her by an unmarried young clergyman. She felt, on the\nwhole, grateful to Mr Slope, and anxious to get on her dress that\nshe might run with the news to her father. Then she came to the\nallusion to her own pious labours, and she said in her heart that\nMr Slope was an affected ass. Then she went on again and was\noffended by her boy being called Mr Slope's darling--he was\nnobody's darling but her own; or at any rate not the darling of a\ndisagreeable stranger like Mr Slope. Lastly she arrived at the\ntresses and felt a qualm of disgust. She looked up in the glass,\nand there they were before her, long and silken, certainly, and\nvery beautiful. I will not say but that she knew them to be so, but\nshe felt angry with them and brushed them roughly and carelessly.\nShe crumpled the letter with angry violence, and resolved, almost\nwithout thinking of it, that she would not show it to her father.\nShe would merely tell him the contents of it. She then comforted\nherself again with her boy, and her dress fastened, she went down\nto dinner.\n\nAs she tripped down the stairs she began to ascertain that there\nwas some difficulty in her situation. She could not keep from her\nfather the news about the hospital, nor could she comfortably\nconfess the letter from Mr Slope before the Grantlys. Her father\nhad already gone down. She had heard his step upon the lobby. She\nresolved therefore to take him aside, and tell him her little bit\nof news. Poor girl! She had no idea how severely the unfortunate\nletter had already been discussed.\n\nWhen she entered the drawing-room the whole party were there,\nincluding Mr Arabin, and the whole party looked glum and sour. The\ntwo girls sat silent and apart as though they were aware that\nsomething was wrong. Even Mr Arabin was solemn and silent. Eleanor\nhad not seen him since breakfast. He had been the whole day at St\nEwold's, and such having been the case it was natural that he\nshould tell how matters were going on there. He did nothing of the\nkind, however, but remained solemn and silent. They were all solemn\nand silent. Eleanor knew in her heart that they had been talking\nabout her, and her heart misgave her as she thought of Mr Slope and\nhis letter. At any rate she felt it to be quite impossible to speak\nto her father alone while matters were in this state.\n\nDinner was soon announced, and Dr Grantly, as was his wont, gave\nEleanor his arm. But he did so as though the doing it were an\noutrage on his feelings rendered necessary by sternest necessity.\nWith quick sympathy Eleanor felt this, and hardly put her fingers\non his coat sleeve. It may be guessed in what way the dinner-hour\nwas passed. Dr Grantly said a few words to Mr Arabin, Mr Arabin\nsaid a few words to Mrs Grantly, she said a few words to her\nfather, and he tried to say a few words to Eleanor. She felt that\nshe had been tried and found guilty of something, though she knew\nnot what. She longed to say out to them all, 'Well, what is it that\nI have done; out with it; and let me know my crime; for heaven's\nsake let me hear the worst of it;' but she could not. She could say\nnothing, but sat there silent, half feeling that she was guilty,\nand trying in vain to pretend even to eat her dinner.\n\nAt last the cloth was drawn, and the ladies were not long following\nit. When they were gone the gentlemen were somewhat more sociable\nbut not much so. They could not of course talk over Eleanor's sins.\nThe archdeacon had indeed so far betrayed his sister-in-law as to\nwhisper into Mr Arabin's ear in the study, as they met there before\ndinner, a hint of what he feared. He did so with the gravest and\nsaddest of fears, and Mr Arabin became grave and apparently sad\nenough as he heard it. He opened his eyes and his mouth and said in\na sort of whisper, 'Mr Slope!' in the same way as he might have\nsaid, The Cholera!' had his friend told him that that horrid\ndisease was in his nursery. 'I fear so, I fear so,' said the\narchdeacon, and then together they left the room.\n\nWe will not accurately analyse Mr Arabin's feelings on receipt of\nsuch astounding tidings. It will suffice to say that he was\nsurprised, vexed, sorrowful, and ill at ease. He had not perhaps\nthought very much about Eleanor, but he had appreciated her\ninfluence, and had felt that close intimacy with her in a country\nhouse was pleasant to him, and also beneficial. He had spoken\nhighly of her intelligence to the archdeacon, and had walked about\nthe shrubberies with her, carrying her boy on his back. When Mr\nArabin had called Johnny his darling, Eleanor was not angry.\n\nThus the three men sat over their wine, all thinking of the same\nsubject, but unable to speak of it to each other. So we will leave\nthem, and follow the ladies into the drawing-room.\n\nMrs Grantly had received a commission from her husband, and had\nundertaken it with some unwillingness. He had desired her to speak\ngravely to Eleanor, and to tell her that, if she persisted in her\nadherence to Mr Slope, she could no longer look for the countenance\nof her present friends. Mrs Grantly probably knew her sister better\nthan the doctor did, and assured him that it would be in vain to\ntalk to her. The only course likely to be of any service in her\nopinion was to keep Eleanor away from Barchester. Perhaps she might\nhave added, for she had a very keen eye in such things, that there\nmight be some ground for hope in keeping Eleanor near Mr Arabin. Of\nthis, however, she said nothing. But the archdeacon would not be\ntalked over; he spoke much of his conscience, and declared that if\nMrs Grantly would not do it he would. So instigated, the lady\nundertook the task, stating, however, her full conviction that her\ninterference would be worse than useless. And so it proved.\n\nAs soon as they were in the drawing-room Mrs Grantly found some\nexcuse for sending her girls away, and then began her task. She\nknew well that she could exercise but very slight authority over\nher sister. Their various modes of life, and the distance between\ntheir residences, had prevented very close confidence. They had\nhardly lived together since Eleanor was a child. Eleanor had\nmoreover, especially in latter years, resented in a quiet sort of\nway, the dictatorial authority which the archdeacon seemed to\nexercise over her father, and on this account had been unwilling to\nallow the archdeacon's wife to exercise authority over herself.\n\n'You got a letter just before dinner, I believe,' began the eldest\nsister.\n\nEleanor acknowledged that she had done so, and felt that she turned\nred as she acknowledged it. She would have given anything to have\nkept her colour, but the more she tried to do so, the more she\nsignally failed.\n\n'Was it not from Mr Slope?'\n\nEleanor said that the letter was from Mr Slope.\n\n'Is he a regular correspondent of yours, Eleanor?'\n\n'Not exactly,' said she, already beginning to feel angry at the\ncross-examination. She determined, and why it would be difficult to\nsay, that nothing would induce her to tell her sister Susan what\nwas the subject of the letter. Mrs Grantly, she knew, was\ninstigated by the archdeacon, and she would not plead to any\narraignment made against her by him.\n\n'But, Eleanor dear, why do you get letters from Mr Slope at all,\nknowing, as you do, he is a person so distasteful to papa, and to\nthe archdeacon, and indeed to all your friends?'\n\n'In the first place, Susan, I don't get letters from him; and in\nthe next place, as Mr Slope wrote the one letter which I have got,\nand as I only received it, which I could not very well help doing,\nas papa handed it to me, I think you had better ask Mr Slope\ninstead of me.'\n\n'What was the letter about, Eleanor?'\n\n'I cannot tell you,' said she, 'because it was confidential. It was\non business respecting a third person.'\n\n'It was in no way personal to yourself, then?'\n\n'I won't exactly say that, Susan,' said she, getting more and more\nangry at her sister's questions.\n\n'Well I must say it's rather singular,' said Mrs Grantly, affecting\nto laugh, 'that a young lady in your position should receive a\nletter from an unmarried gentleman of which she will not tell the\ncontents, and which she is ashamed to show her sister.'\n\n'I am not ashamed,' said Eleanor, blazing up; 'I am not ashamed of\nanything in the matter; only I do not choose to be cross-examined\nas to my letters by any one.'\n\n'Well, dear,' said the other, 'I cannot tell you that I do not\nthink that Mr Slope a proper correspondent for you.'\n\n'If he be ever so improper, how can I help his having written to\nme? But you are all prejudiced against him to such an extent, that\nthat which would be kind and generous in another man is odious and\nimpudent in him. I hate a religion that teaches one to be so\nonesided to one's charity.'\n\n'I am sorry, Eleanor, that you hate the religion you find here; but\nsurely you should remember that in such matters the archdeacon must\nknow more of the world than you do. I don't ask you to respect or\ncomply with me, although I am, unfortunately, so many years your\nsenior; but surely, in such a matter as this, you might consent to\nbe guided by the archdeacon. He is most anxious to be your friend\nif you will let him.'\n\n'In such a matter as what?' said Eleanor very testily. 'Upon my\nword I don't know what this is all about.'\n\n'We all want you to drop Mr Slope.'\n\n'You all want me to be illiberal as yourselves. That I shall never\nbe. I see no harm in Mr Slope's acquaintance, and I shall not\ninsult the man by telling him that I do. He has thought it\nnecessary to write to me, and I do not want the archdeacon's advice\nabout the letter. If I did I would ask it.'\n\n'Then, Eleanor, it is my duty to tell you,' and now she spoke with\na tremendous gravity, 'that the archdeacon thinks that such a\ncorrespondence is disgraceful, and that he cannot allow it to go on\nin this house.'\n\nEleanor's eyes flashed fire as she answered her sister, jumping up\nfrom her seat as she did so. 'You may tell the archdeacon that\nwherever I am I shall receive what letters I please and from whom I\nplease. And as for the word disgraceful, if Dr Grantly has used it\nof me he has been unmanly and inhospitable,' and she walked off to\nthe door. 'When papa comes from the dining-room I will thank you to\nask him to step up to my bed-room. I will show him Mr Slope's\nletter, but I will show it to no one else.' And so saying she\nretreated to her baby.\n\nShe had no conception of the crime with which she was charged. The\nidea that she could be thought by her friends to regard Mr Slope as\na lover, had never flashed upon her. She conceived that they were\nall prejudiced and illiberal in their persecution of him, and\ntherefore she would not join in the persecution, even though she\ngreatly disliked the man.\n\nEleanor was very angry as she seated herself in a low chair by her\nopen window at the foot of her child's bed. 'To dare to say that I\nhave disgraced myself,' she repeated to herself more than once.\n'How papa can put up with that man's arrogance! I will certainly\nnot sit down to dinner in this house again unless he begs my pardon\nfor that word.' And then a thought struck her that Mr Arabin might\nperchance hear of her 'disgraceful' correspondence with Mr Slope,\nand she turned crimson with pure vexation. Oh, if she had known the\ntruth! If she could have conceived that Mr Arabin had been informed\nas a fact that she was going to marry Mr Slope!\n\nShe had not been long in her room before her father joined her. As\nhe left the drawing-room Mrs Grantly took her husband into the\nrecess of the window, and told him how signally she had failed.\n\n'I will speak to her myself before I go to bed,' said the\narchdeacon.\n\n'Pray do no such thing,' said she; 'you can do no good and will\nonly make an unseemly quarrel in the house. You have no idea how\nheadstrong she can be.'\n\nThe archdeacon declared that as to that he was quite indifferent.\nHe knew his duty and he would do it. Mr Harding was weak in the\nextreme in such matters. He would not have it hereafter on his\nconscience that he had not done all that in him lay to prevent so\ndisgraceful an alliance. It was in vain that Mrs Grantly assured\nhim that speaking to Eleanor angrily would only hasten such a\ncrisis, and render it certain if at present there were any doubt.\nHe was angry, self-willed, and sore. The fact that a lady in his\nhousehold had received a letter from Mr Slope had wounded his pride\nin the sorest place, and nothing could control him.\n\nMr Harding looked worn and woebegone as he entered his daughter's\nroom. These sorrows worried him sadly. He felt that if they were\ncontinued he must go to the wall in a manner so kindly prophesied\nto him by the chaplain. He knocked gently at his daughter's door,\nwaited till he was distinctly bade to enter, and then appeared as\nthough he and not she was the suspected criminal.\n\nEleanor's arm was soon within his, and she had soon kissed his\nforehead and caressed him, not with joyous but with eager love.\n'Oh, papa,' she said, 'I do so want to speak to you. They have been\ntalking about me downstairs to-night; don't you know they have,\npapa?'\n\nMr Harding confessed with a sort of murmur that the archdeacon had\nbeen speaking of her.\n\n'I shall hate Dr Grantly soon--'\n\n'Oh, my dear!'\n\n'Well; I shall. I cannot help it. He is so uncharitable, so unkind,\nso suspicious of everyone that does not worship himself: and then\nhe is so monstrously arrogant to other people who have a right to\ntheir opinions as well as he has to his own.'\n\n'He is an earnest, eager man, my dear: but he never means to be\nunkind.'\n\n'He is unkind, papa, most unkind. There, I got that letter from Mr\nSlope before dinner. It was you yourself who gave it to me. There;\npray read it. It is all for you. It should have been addressed to\nyou. You know how they have been talking about it downstairs. You\nknow how they behaved to me at dinner. And since dinner Susan has\nbeen preaching to me, till I could not remain in the room with her.\nRead it, papa; and then say whether that is a letter that need make\nDr Grantly so outrageous.'\n\nMr Harding took his arm from his daughter's waist, and slowly read\nthe letter. She expected to see his countenance lit up with joy as\nhe learnt that his path back to the hospital was made so smooth;\nbut she was doomed to disappointment, as had once been the case\nbefore on a somewhat similar occasion. His first feeling was one of\nunmitigated disgust that Mr Slope should have chosen to interfere\nin his behalf. He had been anxious to get back to the hospital, but\nhe would have infinitely sooner resigned all pretensions to the\nplace, than have owned in any manner to Mr Slope's influence in his\nfavour. Then he thoroughly disliked the tone of Mr Slope's letter;\nit was unctuous, false, and unwholesome, like the man. He saw,\nwhich Eleanor had failed to see, that much more had been intended\nthan was expressed. The appeal to Eleanor's pious labours as\nseparate from his own grated sadly against his feelings as a\nfather. And then, when he came to the 'darling boy,' and the\n'silken tresses,' he slowly closed and folded the letter in\ndespair. It was impossible that Mr Slope should so write unless he\nhad been encouraged. It was impossible that Eleanor should have\nreceived such a letter, and received it without annoyance, unless\nshe were willing to encourage him. So at least, Mr Harding argued\nto himself.\n\nHow hard it is to judge accurately of the feelings of others. Mr\nHarding, as he came to close the letter, in his heart condemned his\ndaughter for indelicacy, and it made him miserable to do so. She\nwas not responsible for what Mr Slope might write. True. But then\nshe expressed no disgust at it. She had rather expressed approval\nof the letter as a whole. She had given it to him to read, as a\nvindication for herself and also for him. The father's spirits sank\nwithin him as he felt that he could not acquit her.\n\nAnd yet it was the true feminine delicacy of Eleanor's mind which\nbrought her on this condemnation. Listen to me, ladies, and I\nbeseech you to acquit her. She thought of this man, this lover of\nwhom she was so unconscious, exactly as her father did, exactly as\nthe Grantlys did. At least she esteemed him personally as they did.\nBut she believed him to be in the main an honest man, and one truly\ninclined to assist her father. She felt herself bound, after what\nhad passed, to show the letter to Mr Harding. She thought it\nnecessary that he should know what Mr Slope had to say. But she did\nnot think it necessary to apologise for, or condemn, or even allude\nto the vulgarity of the man's tone, which arose, as does all\nvulgarity, from ignorance. It was nauseous to her to have such a\nman like Mr Slope commenting on her personal attractions; and she\ndid not think it necessary to dilate with her father upon what was\nnauseous. She never supposed they could disagree on such a subject.\nIt would have been painful for to point it out, painful to her to\nspeak strongly against a man of whom, on the whole she was anxious\nto think and speak well. In encountering such a man she had\nencountered what was disagreeable, as she might do in walking the\nstreets. But in such encounters she never thought it necessary to\ndwell on what disgusted her.\n\nMr Harding slowly folded the letter, handed it back to her, kissed\nher forehead and bade God bless her. He then crept slowly away to\nhis own room.\n\nAs soon as he had left the passage another knock was given at\nEleanor's door, and Mrs Grantly's very demure own maid, entering on\ntiptoe, wanted to know would Mrs Bold be so kind as to speak to the\narchdeacon for two minutes in the archdeacon's study, if not\ndisagreeable. The archdeacon's compliments, and he wouldn't detain\nher two minutes.\n\nEleanor thought it was very disagreeable; she was tired and fagged\nand sick at heart; her present feelings towards Dr Grantly were\nanything but those of affection. She was, however, no coward, and\ntherefore promised to be in the study in five minutes. So she\narranged her hair, tied on her cap, and went down with a\npalpitating heart.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nA SERIOUS INTERVIEW\n\nThere are people who delight in serious interviews, especially when\nto them appertain the part of offering advice or administering\nrebuke, and perhaps the archdeacon was one of these. Yet on this\noccasion he did not prepare himself for the coming conversation\nwith much anticipation of pleasure. Whatever might be his faults he\nwas not an inhospitable man, and he almost felt that he was sinning\nagainst hospitality in upbraiding Eleanor in his own house. Then,\nalso he was not quite sure that he would get the best of it. His\nwife had told him that he decidedly would not, and he usually gave\ncredit to what his wife said. He was, however, so convinced of what\nhe considered to be the impropriety of Eleanor's conduct, and so\nassured also of his own duty in trying to check it, that his\nconscience would not allow him to take his wife's advice and go to\nbed quietly.\n\nEleanor's face as she entered the room was not much as to reassure\nhim. As a rule she was always mild in manner and gentle in conduct;\nbut there was that in her eye which made it not an easy task to\nscold her. In truth she had been little used to scolding. No one\nsince her childhood had tried it but the archdeacon, and he had\ngenerally failed when he did try it. He had never done so since her\nmarriage; and now, when he saw her quiet easy step, as she entered\nthe room, he almost wished he had taken his wife's advice.\n\nHe began by apologising for the trouble he was giving her. She\nbegged him not to mention it, assured him that walking down the\nstairs was no trouble to her at all, and then took a seat and\nwaited patiently for him to begin his attack.\n\n'My dear Eleanor,' he said, 'I hope you believe me when I assure\nyou that you have no sincerer friend than I am.' To this Eleanor\nanswered nothing, and therefore he proceeded. 'If you had a brother\nof your own I should not probably trouble you with what I am going\nto say. But as it is I cannot but think that it must be a comfort\nto you to know that you have near you one who is as anxious for\nyour welfare as any brother of your own could be.'\n\n'I never had a brother,' said she.\n\n'I know you never had, and it is therefore that I speak to you.'\n\n'I never had a brother,' she repeated; 'but I have hardly felt the\nwant. Papa has been to me both father and brother.'\n\n'Your father is the fondest and most affectionate of men. But--'\n\n'He is--the fondest and most affectionate of men, and the best of\ncounsellors. While he lives I can never want advice.'\n\nThis rather put the archdeacon out. He could not exactly contradict\nwhat his sister-in-law said about her father; and yet he did not at\nall agree with her. He wanted her to understand that he tendered\nhis assistance because her father was a soft good-natured\ngentleman, not sufficiently knowing in the ways of the world; but\nhe could not say this to her. So he had to rush into the\nsubject-matter of his proffered counsel without any acknowledgement\non her part that she could need it, or would be grateful for it.\n\n'Susan tells me that you received a letter this evening from Mr\nSlope.'\n\n'Yes; papa brought it in the brougham. Did he not tell you?'\n\n'And Susan says that you objected to let her know what it was\nabout.'\n\n'I don't think she asked me. But had she done so I should not have\ntold her. I don't think it nice to be asked about one's letters. If\none wishes to show them one does so without being asked.'\n\n'True. Quite so. What you say is quite true. But is not the fact of\nyour receiving letters from Mr Slope, which you do not wish to show\nto your friends, a circumstance which must excite some--some\nsurprise--some suspicion--'\n\n'Suspicion!' said she, not speaking above her usual voice, speaking\nstill in a soft womanly tone, but yet with indignation; 'suspicion!\nand who suspects me, and of what?'\n\nAnd then there was a pause, for the archdeacon was not quite ready\nto explain the ground of his suspicion. 'No, Dr Grantly, I did not\nchoose to show Mr Slope's letter to Susan. I could not show it to\nany one till papa had seen it. If you have any wish to read it now,\nyou can do so,' and she handed the letter to him over the table.\n\nThis was an amount of compliance which he had not at all expected,\nand which rather upset him in his tactics. However, he took the\nletter, perused it carefully, and then refolding it, kept it on the\ntable under his hand. To him it appeared to be in almost every\nrespect the letter of a declared lover; it seemed to corroborate\nhis worst suspicions; and the fact of Eleanor's showing it to him\nwas all but tantamount to a declaration on her part, that it was\nher pleasure to receive love-letters from Mr Slope. He almost\nentirely overlooked the real subject-matter of the epistle; so\nintent was he on the forthcoming courtship and marriage.\n\n'I'll thank you to give it back, please, Dr Grantly.'\n\nHe took his hand and held it up, but made no immediate overture to\nreturn it. 'And Mr Harding has seen this?' said he.\n\n'Of course he has,' said she; 'it was written that he might see it.\nIt refers solely to his business--of course I showed it to him.'\n\n'And Eleanor, do you think that that is a proper letter for\nyou--for a person in your condition--to receive from Mr Slope?'\n\n'Quite a proper letter,' said she, speaking, perhaps, a little out\nof obstinacy; probably forgetting at the moment the objectionable\nmention of her silken curls.\n\n'Then, Eleanor, it is my duty to tell you that I wholly differ from\nyou.'\n\n'So I suppose,' said she, instigated now by sheer opposition and\ndetermination not to succumb. 'You think Mr Slope is a messenger\ndirect from Satan. I think he is an industrious, well-meaning\nclergyman. It's a pity that we differ as we do. But, as we do\ndiffer, we had probably better not talk about it.'\n\nHere undoubtedly Eleanor put herself in the wrong. She might\nprobably have refused to talk to Dr Grantly on the matter in\ndispute without any impropriety; but having consented to listen to\nhim, she had no business to tell him that regarded Mr Slope as an\nemissary from the evil one; nor was she justified in praising Mr\nSlope, seeing that in her heart of hearts she did not think well of\nhim. She was, however, wounded in spirit, and very angry and\nbitter. She had been subjected to contumely and cross-questioning\nand ill-usage through the whole evening. No one, not even Mr\nArabin, not even her father, had been kind to her. All this she\nattributed to the prejudice and conceit of the archdeacon, and\ntherefore she resolved to set no bounds to her antagonism to him.\nShe would neither give nor take quarter. He had greatly presumed in\ndaring to question her about her correspondence, and she was\ndetermined to show that she thought so.\n\n'Eleanor, you are forgetting yourself,' said he, looking very\nsternly at her. 'Otherwise you would never tell me that I conceive\nany man to be a messenger from Satan.'\n\n'But you do,' said she. 'Nothing is too bad for him. Give me that\nletter, if you please;' and she stretched out her hand and took it\nfrom him. 'He has been doing his best to serve papa, doing more\nthan any of papa's friends could do; and yet, because he is the\nchaplain of a bishop whom you don't like, you speak of him as\nthough he had no right to the usage of a gentleman.'\n\n'He has done nothing for your father.'\n\n'I believe that he has done a great deal; and, as far as I am\nconcerned, I am grateful to him. I judge people by their acts, and\nhis, as far as I can see them, are good.' She then paused for a\nmoment. 'If you have nothing further to say, I shall be obliged by\nbeing permitted to say good night--I am very tired.'\n\nDr Grantly had, as he thought, done his best to be gracious to his\nsister-in-law. He had endeavoured not to be harsh with her, and had\nstriven to pluck the sting from his rebuke. But he did not intend\nthat she should leave him without hearing him.\n\n'I have something to say, Eleanor; and I fear I must trouble you to\nhear it. You profess that it is quite proper that you should\nreceive from Mr Slope such letters as that you have in your hand.\nSusan and I think very differently. You are, of course, your own\nmistress, and much as we both must grieve should anything separate\nyou from us, we have no power to prevent you from taking steps\nwhich may lead to such a separation. If you are so wilful as to\nreject the counsel of your friends, you must be allowed to cater\nfor yourself. Is it worth you while to break away from all those\nyou have loved--from all who love you--for the sake of Mr Slope?'\n\n'I don't know what you mean, Dr Grantly; I don't know what you are\ntalking about. I don't want to break away from anybody.'\n\n'But you will do so if you connect yourself with Mr Slope. Eleanor,\nI must speak out to you. You must choose between your sister and\nmyself and our friends, and Mr Slope and his friends. I say nothing\nof your father, as you may probably understand his feelings better\nthan I do.'\n\n'What do you mean, Dr Grantly? What am I to understand? I never\nheard such wicked prejudice in my life.'\n\n'It is no prejudice, Eleanor. I have known the world longer than\nyou have done. Mr Slope is altogether beneath you. You ought to\nknow and feel that he is so. Pray--pray think of this before it is\ntoo late.'\n\n'Too late!'\n\n'Or if you will not believe me, ask Susan; you cannot think she is\nprejudiced against you. Or even consult your father, he is not\nprejudiced against you. Ask Mr Arabin--'\n\n'You haven't spoken to Mr Arabin about this!' said she, jumping up\nand standing before him.\n\n'Eleanor, all the world in and about Barchester will be speaking of\nit soon.'\n\n'But you have spoken to Mr Arabin about me and Mr Slope?'\n\n'Certainly I have, and he quite agrees with me.'\n\n'Agree with what?' said she. 'I think you are trying to drive me\nmad.'\n\n'He agrees with me and Susan that it is quite impossible you should\nbe received at Plumstead as Mrs Slope.'\n\nNot being favourites with the tragic muse we do not dare to attempt\nany description of Eleanor's face when she first heard the name of\nMrs Slope pronounced as that which would or should or might at some\ntime appertain to herself. The look, such as it was, Dr Grantly did\nnot soon forget. For a moment or two she could find no words to\nexpress her deep anger and deep disgust; and, indeed, at this\nconjuncture, words did not come to her very freely.\n\n'How dare you be so impertinent?' at last she said; and then\nhurried out of the room, without giving the archdeacon the\nopportunity of uttering another word. It was with difficulty that\nshe contained herself till she reached her own room; and then,\nlocking the door, she threw herself on her bed and sobbed as though\nher heart would break.\n\nBut even yet she had no conception of the truth. She had no idea\nthat her father and sister had for days past conceived in sober\nearnest the idea that she was going to marry the man. She did not\neven then believe that the archdeacon thought that she would do so.\nBy some manoeuvre of her brain, she attributed the origin of the\naccusation to Mr Arabin, and as she did so her anger against him\nwas excessive, and the vexation of her spirit almost unendurable.\nShe could not bring herself to think the charge was made seriously.\nIt appeared to her most probable that the archdeacon and Mr Arabin\nhad talked over her objectionable acquaintance with Mr Slope; that\nMr Arabin, in his jeering sarcastic way, had suggested the odious\nmatch as being the severest way of treating with contumely her\nacquaintance with his enemy; and that the archdeacon, taking the\nidea from him, thought proper to punish her by the allusion. The\nwhole night she lay awake thinking of what had been said, and this\nappeared to be the most probable solution.\n\nBut the reflection that Mr Arabin should have in any way mentioned\nher name in connection with that of Mr Slope was overpowering; and\nthe spiteful ill-nature of the archdeacon, in repeating the charge\nto her, made her wish to leave his house almost before the day had\nbroken. One thing was certain: nothing should make her stay there\nbeyond the following morning, and nothing should make her sit down\nin company with Dr Grantly. When she thought of the man whose name\nhad been linked with her own, she cried from sheer disgust. It was\nonly because she would be thus disgusted, thus pained, and shocked\nand cut to the quick, that the archdeacon had spoken the horrid\nword. He wanted her to make her quarrel with Mr Slope, and\ntherefore he had outraged her by his abominable vulgarity. She\ndetermined that at any rate he should know that she appreciated it.\n\nNor was the archdeacon a bit better satisfied with the result of\nhis serious interview than was Eleanor. He gathered from it, as\nindeed he could hardly fail to do, that she was very angry with\nhim; but he thought that she was thus angry, not because she was\nsuspected of an intention to marry Mr Slope, but because such an\nintention was imputed to her as a crime. Dr Grantly regarded this\nsupposed union with disgust; but it never occurred to him that\nEleanor was outraged, because she looked at it exactly in the same\nlight.\n\nHe returned to his wife vexed and somewhat disconsolate, but,\nnevertheless, confirmed in his wrath against his sister-in-law.\n'Her whole behaviour,' said he, 'has been most objectionable. She\nhanded me his love letter to read as though she were proud of it.\nAnd she is proud of it. She is proud of having this slavering,\ngreedy man at her feet. She will throw herself and John Bold's\nmoney into his lap; she will ruin her boy, disgrace her father and\nyou, and be a wretched miserable woman.'\n\nHis spouse who was sitting at her toilet table, continued her\navocations, making no answer to all this. She had known that the\narchdeacon would gain nothing be interfering; but she was too\ncharitable to provoke him by saying so while he was in such deep\nsorrow.\n\n'This comes of a man making a will as that of Bold's' he continued.\n'Eleanor is no more fitted to be trusted with such an amount of\nmoney in her own hands than is a charity-school girl.' Still Mrs\nGrantly made no reply. 'But I have done my duty; I can do nothing\nfurther. I have told her plainly that she cannot be allowed to form\na link of connection between me and that man. From henceforward it\nwill not be in my power to make her welcome at Plumstead. I cannot\nhave Mr Slope's love letters coming here. I think you have better\nlet her understand that as her mind on this subject seems to be\nirrevocably fixed, it will be better for all parties that she\nshould return to Barchester.\n\nNow Mrs Grantly was angry with Eleanor, nearly as angry as her\nhusband; but she had no idea of turning her sister out of the\nhouse. She, therefore, at length spoke out, and explained to the\narchdeacon in her own mild seducing way, that he was fuming and\nfussing and fretting himself very unnecessarily. She declared that\nthings, if left alone, would arrange themselves much better than he\ncould arrange them; and at last succeeded in inducing him to go to\nbed in a somewhat less inhospitable state of mind.\n\nOn the following morning Eleanor's maid was commissioned to send\nword into the dining-room that her mistress was not well enough to\nattend prayers, and that she would breakfast in her own room. Here\nshe was visited by her father and declared to him her intention of\nreturning immediately to Barchester. He was hardly surprised by the\nannouncement. All the household seemed to be aware that something\nhad gone wrong. Every one walked about with subdued feet, and\npeople's shoes seemed to creak more than usual. There was a look of\nconscious intelligence on the faces of the women; and the men\nattempted, but in vain, to converse as though nothing were the\nmatter. All this had weighed heavily on the heart of Mr Harding;\nand when Eleanor told him that her immediate return to Barchester\nwas a necessity, he merely sighed piteously, and said that he would\nbe ready to accompany her.\n\nBut here she objected strenuously. She had a great wish, she said,\nto go alone; a great desire that it might be seen that her father\nwas not implicated in her quarrel with Dr Grantly. To this at last\nhe gave way; but not a word passed between them about Mr Slope--not\na word was said, not a question asked as to the serious interview\non the preceding evening. There was, indeed, very little confidence\nbetween them, though neither of them knew why it should be so.\nEleanor once asked him whether he would not call upon the bishop;\nbut he answered rather tartly that he did not know--he did not\nthink he should, but he could not say just at present. And so they\nparted. Each was miserably anxious for some show of affection, for\nsome return of confidence, for some sign of the feeling that\nusually bound them together. But none was given. The father could\nnot bring himself to question his daughter about her supposed\nlover; and the daughter would not sully her mouth by repeating the\nodious word with which Dr Grantly had aroused her wrath. And so\nthey parted.\n\nThere was some trouble in arranging the method of Eleanor's return.\nShe begged her father to send for a postchaise; but when Mrs\nGrantly heard of this, she objected strongly. If Eleanor would go\naway in dudgeon with the archdeacon, why should she let all the\nservants and all the neighbourhood know that she had done so? So at\nlast Eleanor consented to make use of the Plumstead carriage; and\nas the archdeacon had gone out immediately after breakfast and was\nnot to return till dinner-time, she also consented to postpone her\njourney till after lunch, and to join the family at that time. As\nto the subject of the quarrel not a word was said by any one. The\naffair of the carriage was arranged by Mr Harding, who acted as\nMercury between the two ladies; they, when they met, kissed each\nother very lovingly, and then sat down each to her crochet work as\nthough nothing was amiss in all the world.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nANOTHER LOVE SCENE\n\nBut there was another visitor at the rectory whose feelings in this\nunfortunate matter must be somewhat strictly analysed. Mr Arabin\nhad heard from his friend of the probability of Eleanor's marriage\nwith Mr Slope with amazement, but not with incredulity. It has been\nsaid that he was not in love with Eleanor, and up to this period\nthis certainly had been true. But as soon as he heard that she\nloved some one else, he began to be very fond of her himself. He\ndid not make up his mind that he wished to have her for his wife;\nhe had never thought of her, and did not know how to think of her,\nin connection with himself; but he experienced an inward\nindefinable feeling of deep regret, a gnawing sorrow, and\nunconquerable depression of spirits, and also a species of\nself-abasement that he--he Mr Arabin--had not done something to\nprevent that other he, that vile he, whom he so thoroughly\ndespised, from carrying off his sweet prize.\n\nWhatever man may have reached the age of forty unmarried without\nknowing something of such feelings must have been very successful\nor else very cold hearted.\n\nMr Arabin had never thought of trimming the sails of his bark so\nthat he might sail as convoy to this rich argosy. He had seen that\nMrs Bold was beautiful, but he had not dreamt of making her beauty\nhis own. He knew that Mrs Bold was rich, but he had no more idea of\nappropriating her wealth than that of Dr Grantly. He had discovered\nthat Mrs Bold was intelligent, warm-hearted, agreeable, sensible,\nall, in fact, that a man could wish his wife to be; but the higher\nwere her attractions, the greater her claims to consideration, the\nless had he imagined that he might possible become the possessor of\nthem. Such had been his instinct rather than his thoughts, so\nhumble and so diffident. Now his diffidence was to be rewarded by\nhis seeing this woman, whose beauty was to his eyes perfect, whose\nwealth was such as to have deterred him from thinking of her, whose\nwidowhood would have silenced him had he not been so deterred, by\nhis seeing her become the prey of--Obadiah Slope!\n\nOn the morning of Mrs Bold's departure he got on his horse to ride\nover to St Ewold's. As he rode he kept muttering to himself a line\nfrom Van Artevelde:-\n\nHow little flattering is woman's love.\n\nAnd then he strove to recall his mind and to think of other\naffairs, his parish, his college, his creed--but his thoughts would\nrevert to Mrs Bold and the Flemish chieftain:\n\n      When we think upon it\n      How little flattering is woman's love,\n      Given commonly to whosoe'er is nearest\n      And propped with most advantage.\n\nIt was not that Mrs Bold should marry any one but him; he had not\nput himself forward as a suitor; but that she should marry Mr\nSlope--and so he repeated over and over again:\n\nOutward grace Nor inward light is needful--day by day Men wanting\nboth are mated with the best And loftiest of God's feminine\ncreation, Whose love takes no distinction but of gender And\nridicules the very name of choice.\n\nAnd so he went on troubled much in his mind.\n\nHe had but an uneasy ride of it that morning, and little good did\nhe do at St Ewold's.\n\nThe necessary alterations in his house were being fast completed,\nand he walked through the rooms, and went up and down the stairs\nand rambled through the garden; but he could not wake himself to\nmuch interest about them. He stood still at every window to look\nout and think upon Mr Slope. At almost every window he had before\nstood and chatted with Eleanor. She and Mrs Grantly had been there\ncontinually, and while Mrs Grantly had been giving orders, and\nseeing that orders had been complied with, he and Eleanor had\nconversed on all things appertaining to a clergyman's profession.\nHe thought how often he had laid down the law to her, and how\nsweetly she had borne with somewhat dictatorial decrees. He\nremembered her listening intelligence, her gentle but quick\nreplies, her interest in all that concerned the church, in all that\nconcerned him; and then he struck his riding whip against the\nwindow sill, and declared to himself that it was impossible that\nEleanor Bold should marry Mr Slope.\n\nAnd yet he did not really believe, as he should have done, that it\nwas impossible. He should have known her well enough to feel that\nit was truly impossible. He should have been aware that Eleanor had\nthat within her which would surely protect her from such\ndegradation. But he, like so many others, was deficient in\nconfidence in woman. He said to himself over and over again that it\nwas impossible that Eleanor Bold should become Mrs Slope, and yet\nhe believed that she would do so. And so he rambled about, and\ncould do and think of nothing. He was thoroughly uncomfortable,\nthoroughly ill at ease, cross with himself and every body else, and\nfeeding in his heart on animosity towards Mr Slope. This was not as\nit should be, as he knew and felt; but he could not help himself.\nIn truth Mr Arabin was now in love with Mrs Bold, though ignorant\nof the fact himself. He was in love, and, though forty years old,\nwas in love without being aware of it. He fumed and fretted, and\ndid not know what was the matter, as a youth might do at\none-and-twenty. And so having done no good at St Ewold's, he rode\nback much earlier than was usual with him, instigated, by some\ninward unacknowledged hope that he might see Mrs Bold before she\nleft.\n\nEleanor had not passed a pleasant morning. She was irritated with\nevery one, and not least with herself. She felt that she had been\nhardly used, but she felt also that she had not played her own\ncards well. She should have held herself so far above suspicion as\nto have received her sister's innuendoes and the archdeacon's\nlecture with indifference. She had not done this, but had shown\nherself angry and sore, and was now ashamed of her own petulance,\nand yet unable to discontinue it.\n\nThe greater part of the morning she had spent alone; but after a\nwhile her father joined her. He had fully made up his mind that,\ncome what might, nothing should separate him from his youngest\ndaughter. It was a hard task for him to reconcile himself to the\nidea of seeing her at the head of Mr Slope's table; but he got\nthrough it. Mr Slope, as he argued to himself, was a respectable\nman and a clergyman; and he, as Eleanor's father, had no right even\nto endeavour to prevent her from marrying such a one. He longed to\ntell her how he had determined to prefer her to all the world, how\nhe was prepared to admit that she was not wrong, how thoroughly he\ndiffered from Dr Grantly; but he could not bring himself to mention\nMr Slope's name. There was yet a chance that they were all wrong in\ntheir surmise; and, being thus in doubt, he could not bring himself\nto speak openly to her on the subject.\n\nHe was sitting with her in the drawing-room, with his arm round her\nwaist, saying now and then some little soft words of affection, and\nworking hard with his imaginary little fiddle-bow, when Mr Arabin\nentered the room. He immediately got up, and the two made some\ntrifle remarks to each other, neither thinking of what he was\nsaying, and Eleanor kept her seat on the sofa mute and moody. Mr\nArabin was included in the list of those against whom her anger was\nexcited. He, too, had dared to talk about her acquaintance with Mr\nSlope; he, too, had dared to blame her for not making an enemy of\nhis enemy. She had not intended to see him before her departure,\nand was now but little inclined to be gracious.\n\nThere was a feeling through the whole house that something was\nwrong. Mr Arabin, when he saw Eleanor, could not succeed in looking\nor in speaking as though he knew nothing of all this. He could not\nbe cheerful and positive and contradictory with her, as was his\nwont. He had not been two minutes in the room before he felt that\nhe had done wrong in return; and the moment he heard her voice, he\nthoroughly wished himself back at St Ewold's. Why, indeed, should\nhe have wished to have aught further to say to the future wife of\nMr Slope?\n\n'I am sorry to hear that you are too leave so soon,' said he,\nstriving in vain to use his ordinary voice. In answer to this she\nmuttered something about the necessity of her being in Barchester,\nand betook herself industriously to her crochet work.\n\nThen there was a little more trite conversation between Mr Arabin\nand Mr Harding; trite, and hard, and vapid, and senseless. Neither\nof them had anything to say to the other, and yet neither at such a\nmoment liked to remain silent. At last Mr Harding, taking advantage\nof a pause, escaped from the room, and Eleanor and Mr Arabin were\nleft together.\n\n'Your going will be a great break-up to our party,' said he.\n\nShe again muttered something which was all but inaudible; but kept\nher eyes fixed upon her work.\n\n'We have had a very pleasant month her,' said he; 'at least I have;\nand I am sorry it should be so soon over.'\n\n'I have already been from home longer than I intended,' she said;\n'and it is time that I should return.'\n\n'Well, pleasant hours and pleasant days must come to an end. It is\na pity that so few of them are pleasant; or perhaps rather--'\n\n'It is a pity, certainly, that men and women do so much to destroy\nthe pleasantness of their days,' said she, interrupting him. 'It is\na pity that there should be so little charity abroad.'\n\n'Charity should begin at home,' said he; and he was proceeding to\nexplain that he as a clergyman could not be what she would call\ncharitable at the expense of those principles which he considered\nit his duty to teach, when he remembered that it would be worse\nthan vain to argue on such a matter with the future wife of Mr\nSlope. 'But you are just leaving us,' he continued, 'and I will not\nweary your last hour with another lecture. As it is, I fear I have\ngiven you too many.'\n\n'You should practise as well as preach, Mr Arabin?'\n\n'Undoubtedly I should. So should we all. All of us who presume to\nteach are bound to do our utmost towards fulfilling our own\nlessons. I thoroughly allow my deficiency in doing so; but I do not\nquite know now to what you allude. Have you any special reason for\ntelling me now that I should practise as well as preach?'\n\nEleanor made no answer. She longed to let him know the cause of her\nanger, to upbraid him for speaking of her disrespectfully, and then\nat last forgive him, and so part friends. She felt that she would\nbe unhappy to leave him in her present frame of mind; but yet she\ncould hardly bring herself to speak to him of Mr Slope. And how\ncould she allude to the innuendo thrown out by the archdeacon, and\nthrown out, as she believed, at the instigation of Mr Arabin? She\nwanted to make him know that he was wrong, to make him aware that\nhe had ill-treated her, in order that the sweetness of her\nforgiveness might be enhanced. She felt that she liked him too well\nto be contented to part with him in displeasure; and yet she could\nnot get over her deep displeasure without some explanation, some\nacknowledgement, on his part, some assurance that he would never\nagain so sin against her.\n\n'Why do you tell me that I should practise what I preach?'\ncontinued he.\n\n'All men should do so.'\n\n'Certainly. That is as it were understood and acknowledged. But you\ndo not say so to all men, or to all clergymen. The advice, good as\nit is, is not given except in allusion to some special deficiency.\nIf you will tell me my special deficiency, I will endeavour to\nprofit by the advice.'\n\nShe paused for a while, and then looking full in his face, she\nsaid, 'You are not bold enough, Mr Arabin, to speak out to me\nopenly and plainly, and yet you expect me, a woman, to speak openly\nto you. Why did you speak calumny of me to Dr Grantly behind my\nback?'\n\n'Calumny!' said he, and his whole face became suffused with blood;\n'what calumny? If I have spoken calumny of you, I will beg your\npardon, and his to whom I spoke it, and God's pardon also. But what\ncalumny have I spoken of you to Dr Grantly?'\n\nShe also blushed deeply. She could not bring herself to ask him\nwhether he had not spoken of her as another man's wife. 'You know\nthat best yourself,' said she; 'but I ask you as a man of honour,\nif you have not spoken of me as you would not have spoken of your\nown sister; or rather I will not ask you,' she continued, finding\nthat he did not immediately answer her. 'I will not put you to the\nnecessity of answering such a question. Dr Grantly has told me what\nyou said.'\n\n'Dr Grantly certainly asked me for my advice, and I gave it. He\nasked me--'\n\n'I know he did, Mr Arabin. He asked you whether he would be doing\nright to receive me at Plumstead, if I continued my acquaintance\nwith a gentleman who happens to be personally disagreeable to\nyourself and to him?'\n\n'You are mistaken, Mrs Bold. I have no personal knowledge of Mr\nSlope; I have never met him in my life.'\n\n'You are not the less individually hostile to him. It is not for me\nto question the propriety of your enmity; but I had a right to\nexpect that my name should not have been mixed up in your\nhostilities. This has been done, and been done by you in a manner\nthe most injurious and the most distressing to a woman. I must\nconfess, Mr Arabin, that from you I expected a different sort of\nusage.'\n\nAs she spoke she with difficulty restrained her tears; but she did\nrestrain them. Had she given way and sobbed about, as in such cases\na woman should do, he would have melted at once, implored her\npardon, perhaps knelt at her feet and declared his love. Everything\nwould have been explained, and Eleanor would have gone back to\nBarchester with a contented mind. How easily would she have\nforgiven and forgotten the archdeacon's suspicions had she but\nheard the whole truth of it from Mr Arabin. But then where would\nhave been my novel? She did not cry, and Mr Arabin did not melt.\n\n'You do me an injustice,' said he. 'My advice was asked by Dr\nGrantly, and I was obliged to give it.'\n\n'Dr Grantly has been most officious, most impertinent. I have as\ncomplete a right to form my acquaintance as he has to form his.\nWhat would you have said, had I consulted you as to the propriety\nof banishing Dr Grantly from my house because he knows Lord\nTattenham Corner? I am sure Lord Tattenham is quite as\nobjectionable an acquaintance for a clergyman as Mr Slope is for a\nclergyman's daughter.'\n\n'I do not know Lord Tattenham Corner.'\n\n'No; but Dr Grantly does. It is nothing to me if he knows all the\nyoung lords on every racecourse in England. I shall not interfere\nwith him; nor shall he with me.'\n\n'I am sorry to differ with you, Mrs Bold; but as you have spoken to\nme on this matter, and especially as you blame me for what little I\nsaid on the subject, I must tell you that I do differ from you. Dr\nGrantly's position as a man in the world gives him a right to\nchoose his own acquaintances, subject to certain influences. If he\nchooses them badly, those influences will be used. If he consorts\nwith persons unsuitable to him, his bishop will interfere. What the\nbishop is to Dr Grantly, Dr Grantly is to you.'\n\n'I deny it. I utterly deny it,' said Eleanor, jumping from her\nseat, and literally flashing before Mr Arabin, as she stood on the\ndrawing-room floor. He had never seen her so excited, he had never\nseen her look so beautiful.\n\n'I utterly deny it,' said she. 'Dr Grantly has no sort of\njurisdiction over me whatsoever. Do you and he forget that I am not\naltogether alone in this world? Do you forget that I have a father?\nDr Grantly, I believe, always has forgotten it.'\n\n'From you, Mr Arabin,' she continued, 'I would have listened to\nadvice because I should have expected it to have been given as one\nfriend may advise another; not as a schoolmaster gives an order to\na pupil. I might have differed from you; on this matter I should\nhave done so; but had you spoken to me in your usual manner and\nwith your usual freedom I should not have been angry. But now--was\nit manly of you, Mr Arabin, to speak of me in this way--, so\ndisrespectful--so--? I cannot bring myself to repeat what you said.\nYou must understand what I feel. Was it just of you to speak of me\nin such a way, and to advise my sister's husband to turn me out of\nmy sister's house because I chose to know a man of whose doctrine\nyou disapprove?'\n\n'I have no alternative left to me, Mrs Bold,' said he, standing\nwith his back to the fire-place, looking down intently at the\ncarpet pattern and speaking with a slow measured voice, 'but to\ntell you plainly what did take place between me and Dr Grantly.'\n\n'Well,' said she, finding that he paused for a moment.\n\n'I am afraid that what I may say may pain you.'\n\n'It cannot well do so more than what you have already done,' said\nshe.\n\n'Dr Grantly asked me whether I thought it would be prudent for him\nto receive you in his house as the wife of Mr Slope, and I told him\nthat I thought it would be imprudent. Believing it to be utterly\nimpossible that Mr Slope and--'\n\n'Thank you, Mr Arabin, that is sufficient. I do not want to know\nyour reasons,' said she, speaking with a terribly calm voice. 'I\nhave shown to this gentleman the common-place civility of a\nneighbour; and because I have done so, because I have not indulged\nagainst him in all the rancour and hatred which you and Dr Grantly\nconsider due to all clergymen who do not agree with yourselves, you\nconclude that I am to marry him;--or rather you do not conclude\nso--no rational man could really come to such an outrageous\nconclusion without better ground;--you have not thought so--but, as\nI am in a position in which such an accusation must be peculiarly\npainful, it is made in order that I may be terrified into hostility\nagainst this enemy of yours.'\n\nAs she finished speaking, she walked to the drawing-room window,\nand stepped out into the garden. Mr Arabin was left in the room,\nstill occupied in counting the pattern on the carpet. He had,\nhowever, distinctly heard and accurately marked every word that she\nhad spoken. Was it not clear from what she had said, that the\narchdeacon had been wrong in imputing to her any attachment to Mr\nSlope? Was it not clear that Eleanor was still free to make another\nchoice? It may seem strange that he should for a moment have had a\ndoubt; and yet he did doubt. She had not absolutely denied the\ncharge; she had not expressly said that it was untrue. Mr Arabin\nunderstood little of the nature of a woman's feelings, or he would\nhave known how improbable it was that she should make any clearer\ndeclarations than she had done. Few men do understand the nature of\na woman's heart, till years have robbed such understanding of its\nvalue. And it is well that it should be so, or men would triumph\ntoo easily.\n\nMr Arabin stood counting the carpet, unhappy, wretchedly unhappy,\nat the hard words that had been spoken to him; and yet happy,\nexquisitely happy, as he thought that after all the woman whom he\nso regarded was not to become the wife of the man whom he so much\ndisliked. As he stood there he began to be aware that he was\nhimself in love. Forty years had passed over his head, and as yet\nwoman's beauty had never given him an uneasy hour. His present hour\nwas very uneasy.\n\nNot that he remained there for half or a quarter of that time. In\nspite of what Eleanor had said, Mr Arabin was, in truth, a manly\nman. Having ascertained that he loved this woman, and having now\nreason to believe that she was free to receive his love, at least\nif she pleased to do so, he followed her into the garden to make\nsuch wooing as he could.\n\nHe was not long in finding her. She was walking to and fro beneath\nthe avenue of elms that stood in the archdeacon's grounds, skirting\nthe churchyard. What had passed between her and Mr Arabin, had not,\nalas, tended to lessen the acerbity of her spirit. She was very\nangry; more angry with him than with any one. How could he have so\nmisunderstood her? She had been so intimate with him, had allowed\nhim such latitude in what he had chosen to say to her, had complied\nwith his ideas, cherished his views, fostered his precepts, cared\nfor his comforts, made much of him in every way in which a pretty\nwoman can make much of an unmarried man without committing herself\nor her feelings! She had been doing this, and while she had been\ndoing it he had regarded her as the affianced wife of another man.\n\nAs she passed along the avenue, every now and then an unbidden tear\nwould force itself on her cheek, and as she raised her hand to\nbrush it away, she stamped with her little foot upon the sward with\nvery spite to think that she had been so treated.\n\nMr Arabin was very near to her when she first saw him, that she\nturned short round and retraced her steps down the avenue, trying\nto rid her cheeks of all trace of the tell-tale tears. It was a\nneedless endeavour, for Mr Arabin was in a state of mind that\nhardly allowed him to observe such trifles. He followed her down\nthe walk, and overtook her just as she reached the end of it.\n\nHe had not considered how he would address her; he had not thought\nwhat he would say. He had only felt that it was wretchedness to him\nto quarrel with her, and that it would be happiness to be allowed\nto love her. And that he could not lower himself by asking for her\npardon. He had done no wrong. He had not calumniated her, not\ninjured her, as she had accused him of doing. He could not confess\nsins of which had not been guilty. He could only let the past be\npast, and ask her as to her and his hopes for the future.\n\n'I hope we are not to part as enemies?' said he.\n\n'There shall be no enmity on my part,' said Eleanor; 'I endeavour\nto avoid all enmities. It would be a hollow pretence were I to say\nthat there can be a true friendship between us after what has just\npast. People cannot make their friends of those whom they despise.'\n\n'And am I despised?'\n\n'I must have been so before you could have spoken of me as you did.\nAnd I was deceived, cruelly deceived. I believed that you thought\nwell of me; I believed that you esteemed me.'\n\n'Thought of you well and esteemed you!' said he. 'In justifying\nmyself before you, I must use stronger words than those.' He paused\nfor a moment, and Eleanor's heart beat with painful violence within\nher bosom as she waited for him to go on. 'I have esteemed, do\nesteem you, as I never esteemed any woman. Think well of you! I\nnever thought to think so well, so much of any human creature.\nSpeak calumny of you! Insult you! Wilfully injure you! I wish it\nwere my privilege to shield you from calumny, insult, and injury.\nCalumny! Ah, me. 'Twere almost better that it were so. Better than\nto worship with a sinful worship; sinful and vain also.' And then\nhe walked along beside her, with his hands clasped behind his back,\nlooking down on the grass beneath his feet, and utterly at a loss\nto express his meaning. And Eleanor walked beside him determined at\nleast to give him no assistance.\n\n'Ah, me!' he uttered at last, speaking rather to himself than to\nher. 'Ah, me! These Plumstead walks were pleasant enough, if one\ncould have but heart's ease; but without that, the dull dead stones\nof Oxford were far preferable; and St Ewold's too; Mrs Bold, I am\nbeginning to think that I mistook myself when I came hither. A\nRomish priest now would have escaped all this. Of, Father of\nheaven! How good for us would it be, if thou couldest vouchsafe to\nus a certain rule.'\n\n'And have we not got a certain rule, Mr Arabin?'\n\n'Yes--yes, surely; \"Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us\nfrom evil.\" But what is temptation? what is evil? Is this evil--is\nthis temptation?'\n\nPoor Mr Arabin! It would not come out of him, that deep true love\nof his. He could not bring himself to utter it in plain language\nthat would require and demand an answer. He knew not how to say to\nthe woman at his side, 'Since the fact is that you do not love that\nother man, that you are not to be his wife, can you love me, will\nyou be my wife?' These were the words which were in his heart, but\nwith all his sighs he could not draw them to his lips. He would\nhave given anything, everything for power to ask this simple\nquestion; but glib as was his tongue in pulpits and on platforms,\nnow he could not find a word wherewith to express the plain wish of\nhis heart.\n\nAnd yet Eleanor understood him as thoroughly as though he had\ndeclared his passion with all the elegant fluency of a practised\nLothario. With a woman's instinct she followed every bend of his\nmind, as he spoke of the pleasantness of Plumstead and the stones\nof Oxford, as he alluded to the safety of the Romish priest and the\nhidden perils of temptation. She knew that it all meant love. She\nknew that this man at her side, this accomplished scholar, this\npractised orator, this great polemical combatant, was striving and\nstriving in vain to tell her that his heart was no longer his own.\n\nShe knew this, and felt the joy of knowing it; and yet she would\nnot come to his aid. He had offended her deeply, had treated her\nunworthily, the more unworthily seeing that he had learnt to love\nher, and Eleanor could not bring herself to abandon her revenge.\nShe did not ask herself whether or no she would ultimately accept\nhis love. She did not even acknowledge to herself that she now\nperceived it with pleasure. At the present moment it did not touch\nher heart; it merely appeased her pride and flattered her vanity.\nMr Arabin had dared to associate her name with that of Mr Slope,\nand now her spirit was soothed by finding that he would fain\nassociate it with his own. And so she walked on beside him inhaling\nincense, but giving out no sweetness in return.\n\n'Answer me this,' said Mr Arabin, stopping suddenly in his walk,\nand stepping forward so that he faced his companion. 'Answer me\nthis question. You do not love Mr Slope? You do not intend to be\nhis wife?'\n\nMr Arabin certainly did not go the right way to win such a woman as\nEleanor Bold. Just as her wrath was evaporating, as it was\ndisappearing before the true warmth of his untold love, he\nre-kindled it by a most useless repetition of his original sin. Had\nhe known what he was about he should never have mentioned Mr\nSlope's name before Eleanor Bold, till he had made her all his own.\nThen, and not till then, he might have talked of Mr Slope with as\nmuch triumph as he chose.\n\n'I shall answer no such question,' said she; 'and what is more, I\nmust tell you that nothing can justify your asking it. Good\nmorning!'\n\nAnd so saying she stepped proudly across the lawn, and passing\nthrough the drawing-room window joined her father and sister at\nlunch in the dining-room. Half an hour afterwards she was in the\ncarriage, and so she left Plumstead without again seeing Mr Arabin.\n\nHis walk was long and sad among the sombre trees that overshadowed\nthe churchyard. He left the archdeacon's grounds that he might\nescape attention, and sauntered among the green hillocks under\nwhich lay at rest so many of the once loving swains and forgotten\nbeauties of Plumstead. To his ears Eleanor's last words sounded\nlike a knell never to be reversed. He could not comprehend that she\nmight be angry with him, indignant with him, remorseless with him,\nand yet love him. He could not make up his mind whether or no Mr\nSlope was in truth a favoured rival. If not, why should she not\nhave answered his question?\n\nPoor Mr Arabin--untaught, illiterate, boorish, ignorant man! That\nat forty years of age you should know so little of the workings of\na woman's heart!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nTHE BISHOP'S LIBRARY\n\nAnd thus the pleasant party of Plumstead was broken up. It had been\na very pleasant party as long as they had all remained in good\nhumour with one another. Mrs Grantly had felt her house to be gayer\nand brighter than it had been for many a long day, and the\narchdeacon had been aware that the month had passed pleasantly\nwithout attributing the pleasure to any other special merits than\nthose of his own hospitality. Within three or four days of\nEleanor's departure, Mr Harding had also returned, and Mr Arabin\nhad gone to Oxford to spend one week there previous to his settling\nat the vicarage of St Ewold's. He had gone laden with many messages\nto Dr Gwynne touching the iniquity of the doings in Barchester\npalace, and the peril in which it was believed the hospital still\nstood in spite of the assurances contained in Mr Slope's\ninauspicious letter.\n\nDuring Eleanor's drive into Barchester she had not much opportunity\nof reflecting on Mr Arabin. She had been constrained to divert her\nmind both from his sins and his love by the necessity of conversing\nwith her sister, and maintaining the appearance of parting with her\non good terms.\n\nWhen the carriage reached her own door, and while she was in the\nact of giving her last kiss to her sister and nieces, Mary Bold ran\nout and exclaimed:\n\n'Oh! Eleanor,--have you heard?--oh! Mrs Grantly, have you heard\nwhat has happened? The poor dean!'\n\n'Good heavens,' said Mrs Grantly; 'what--what has happened?'\n\n'This morning at nine he had a fit of apoplexy, and he has not\nspoken since. I very much fear that by this time he is no more.'\n\nMrs Grantly had been very intimate with the dean, and was therefore\nmuch shocked. Eleanor had not known him so well; nevertheless she\nwas sufficiently acquainted with his person and manners to feel\nstartled and grieved also at the tidings she now received. 'I will\ngo at once to the deanery,' said Mrs Grantly, 'the archdeacon, I am\nsure, will be there. If there is any news to send you I will let\nThomas call before he leaves town.' And so the carriage drove off,\nleaving Eleanor and her baby with Mary Bold.\n\nMrs Grantly had been quite right. The archdeacon was at the\ndeanery. He had come into Barchester that morning by himself, not\ncaring to intrude himself upon Eleanor, and he also immediately on\nhis arrival had heard of the dean's fit. There was, as we have\nbefore said, a library or reading room connecting the cathedral\nwith the dean's home. This was generally called the bishop's\nlibrary, because a certain bishop of Barchester was supposed to\nhave added it to the cathedral. It was built immediately over a\nportion of the cloisters, and a flight of stairs descended from it\ninto the room in which the cathedral clergymen put their surplices\non and off. As it also opened directly into the dean's house, it\nwas the passage through which that dignitary usually went to his\npublic devotions. Who had or had not the right of entry into it,\nmight be difficult to say; but the people of Barchester believed\nthat it belonged to the dean, and the clergymen of Barchester\nbelieved that it belonged to the chapter.\n\nOn the morning in question most of the resident clergymen who\nconstituted the chapter, and some few others, were here assembled,\nand among them as usual the archdeacon towered with high authority.\nHe had heard of the dean's fit before he was over the bridge which\nled into the town, and had at once come to the well known clerical\ntrysting place. He had been there by eleven o'clock, and had\nremained ever since. From time to time the medical men who had been\ncalled in came through from the deanery into the library, uttered\nlittle bulletins, and then returned. There was it appears very\nlittle hope of the old man's rallying, indeed no hope of any thing\nlike a final recovery. The only question was whether he must die at\nonce speechless, unconscious, stricken to death by his first heavy\nfit; or whether by due aid of medical skill he might not be so far\nbrought back to this world as to become conscious of his state, and\nenabled to address one prayer to his Maker before he was called to\nmeet Him face to face at the judgement seat.\n\nSir Omicron Pie had been sent for from London. That great man had\nshown himself a wonderful adept at keeping life still moving within\nan old man's heart in the case of good old Bishop Grantly, and it\nmight be reasonably expected that he would be equally successful\nwith a dean. In the mean time, Dr Fillgrave and Mr Rerechild were\ndoing their best; and poor Miss Trefoil sat at the head of her\nfather's bed, longing, as in such cases daughters do long, to be\nallowed to do something to show her love; if it were only to chafe\nhis feet with her hands, or wait in menial offices on those\nautocratic doctors; anything so that now in the time of need she\nmight be of use.\n\nThe archdeacon alone of the attendant clergy had been admitted for\na moment into the sick man's chamber. He had crept in with creaking\nshoes, had said with smothered voice a word of consolation to the\nsorrowing daughter, had looked on the distorted face of his old\nfriend with solemn but yet eager scrutinising eye, as though he\nsaid in his heart, 'and so some day it will probably be with me;'\nand then, having whispered an unmeaning word or two to the doctors,\nhad creaked his way back again into the library.\n\n'He'll never speak again, I fear,' said the archdeacon as he\nnoiselessly closed the door, as though the unconscious dying man,\nfrom whom all sense had fled, would have heard in his distant\nchamber the spring of the lock which was now so carefully handled.\n\n'Indeed! Indeed! Is he so bad?' said the meagre little prebendary,\nturning over in his own mind all the probable candidates for the\ndeanery, and wondering whether the archdeacon would think it worth\nhis while to accept it. 'The fit must have been very violent.'\n\n'When a man over seventy has a stroke of apoplexy, it seldom comes\nvery lightly,' said the burly chancellor.\n\n'He was an excellent, sweet-tempered man,' said one of the vicars\nchoral. 'Heaven knows how we shall repair his loss.'\n\n'He was indeed,' said a minor canon; 'and a great blessing to all\nthose privileged to take a share of the services of our cathedral.\nI suppose the government will appoint, Mr Archdeacon. I trust that\nwe may have no stranger.'\n\n'We will not talk about his successor,' said the archdeacon, 'while\nthere is yet hope.'\n\n'Oh no, of course not,' said the minor canon. 'It would be\nextraordinarily indecorous; but--'\n\n'I know of no man,' said the meagre little prebendary, 'who has\nbetter interest with the present government than Mr Slope.'\n\n'Mr Slope!' said two or three at once almost sotto voce. 'Mr Slope\ndean of Barchester!'\n\n'Pooh!' exclaimed the burly chancellor.\n\n'The bishop would do anything for him,' said the little prebendary.\n\n'And so would Mrs Proudie,' said the vicar choral.\n\n'Pooh!' said the chancellor.\n\nThe archdeacon had almost turned pale at the idea. What if Mr Slope\nshould become dean of Barchester? To be sure there was no adequate\nground, indeed no ground at all, for presuming that such a\ndesecration could even be contemplated. But nevertheless it was on\nthe cards. Dr Proudie had interest with the government, and the man\ncarried as it were Dr Proudie in his pocket. How should they all\nconduct themselves if Mr Slope were to become dean of Barchester?\nThe bare idea for a moment struck even Dr Grantly dumb.\n\n'It would certainly not be very pleasant for us to have Mr Slope in\nthe deanery,' said the little prebendary, chuckling inwardly at the\nevident consternation which his surmise had created.\n\n'About as pleasant and as probably as having you in the palace,'\nsaid the chancellor.\n\n'I should think such an appointment highly improbable,' said the\nminor canon, 'and, moreover, extremely injudicious. Should not you,\nMr Archdeacon?'\n\n'I should presume such a thing to be quite out of the question,'\nsaid the archdeacon; 'but at the present moment I am thinking\nrather of our poor friend who is lying so near us than of Mr\nSlope.'\n\n'Of course, of course,' said the vicar choral with a very solemn\nair; 'of course you are. So are we all. Poor Dr Trefoil; the best\nof men but--'\n\n'It's the most comfortable dean's residence in England,' said a\nsecond prebendary. 'Fifteen acres in the grounds. 'It is better\nthan many of the bishops' palaces.'\n\n'And full two thousand a year,' said the meagre doctor.\n\n'It is cut down to L 1200,' said the chancellor.\n\n'No,' said the second prebendary. 'It is to be fifteen. A special\ncase was made.'\n\n'No such thing,' said the chancellor.\n\n'You'll find I'm right,' said the prebendary.\n\n'I'm sure I read it in the report,' said the minor canon.\n\n'Nonsense,' said the chancellor. 'They couldn't do it. There were\nto be no exceptions but London and Durham.'\n\n'And Canterbury and York,' said the vicar choral, modestly.\n\n'What say you, Grantly?' said the meagre little doctor.\n\n'Say about what?' said the archdeacon, who had been looking as\nthough he were thinking about his friend the dean, but who had in\nreality been thinking about Mr Slope.\n\n'What is the next dean to have, twelve or fifteen?'\n\n'Twelve,' said the archdeacon authoritatively, thereby putting an\nend at once to all doubt and dispute among the subordinates as far\nas that subject was concerned.\n\n'Well I certainly thought it was fifteen,' said the minor canon.\n\n'Pooh!' said the burly chancellor. At this moment the door opened,\nand in came Dr Fillgrave.\n\n'How is he?' 'Is he conscious?' 'Can he speak?' 'I hope, I trust,\nsomething better, doctor?' said half a dozen voices all at once,\neach in a tone of extremest anxiety. It was pleasant to see how\npopular the good old dean was among his clergy.\n\n'No change, gentlemen; not the slightest change--but a telegraphic\nmessage has arrived,--Sir Omicron Pie will be here by the 9.15pm\ntrain. If any man can do anything Sir Omicron will do it. But all\nthat skill can do has been done.'\n\n'We are sure of that, Dr Fillgrave,' said the archdeacon; 'we are\nquite sure of that. But yet you know--'\n\n'Oh, quite right,' said the doctor, 'quite right--I should have\ndone just the same--I advised it at once. I said to Rerechild at\nonce that with such a life and such a man, Sir Omicron should be\nsummoned--of course I knew that the expense was nothing--so\ndistinguished, you know, and so popular. Nevertheless, all that\nhuman skill can do has been done.'\n\nJust at this period Mrs Grantly's carriage drove into the close,\nand the archdeacon went down to confirm the news which she had\nheard before.\n\nBy the 9.15pm train Sir Omicron Pie did arrive. And in the course\nof the night a sort of consciousness returned to the poor old dean.\nWhether this was due to Sir Omicron Pie is a question on which it\nmay be well not to offer an opinion. Dr Fillgrave was very clear in\nhis own mind, but Sir Omicron himself is thought to have differed\nfrom that learned doctor.\n\nAt any rate, Sir Omicron expressed an opinion that the dean had yet\nsome days to live.\n\nFor the eight or ten next days, accordingly, the poor dean remained\nin the same state, half conscious and half comatose, and the\nattendant clergy began to think that no new appointment would be\nnecessary for some few months to come.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\nA NEW CANDIDATE FOR ECCLESIASTICAL HONOURS\n\nThe dean's illness occasioned much mental turmoil in other places\nbesides the deanery and adjoining library, and the idea which\noccurred to the meagre little prebendary about Mr Slope did not\noccur to him alone.\n\nThe bishop was sitting listlessly in his study when the news\nreached him of the dean's illness. It was brought to him by Mr\nSlope, who of course was not the last person in Barchester to hear\nit. It was also not slow in finding its way to Mrs Proudie's ears.\nIt may be presumed that there was not just much friendly\nintercourse between these two rival claimants for his lordship's\nobedience. Indeed, though living in the same house, they had not\nmet since the stormy interview between them in the bishop's study\non the preceding day.\n\nOn that occasion, Mrs Proudie had been defeated. That from her\nstandards was a subject of great sorrow to that militant lady; but\nthough defeated, she was not overcome. She felt that she might yet\nrecover her lost ground, that she might yet hurl Mr Slope down to\nthe dust from which she had picked him, and force her sinning lord\nto sue for pardon in sackcloth and ashes.\n\nOn that memorable day, memorable for his mutiny and rebellion\nagainst her high behests, he had carried his way with a high hand,\nand had really begun to think it possible that the days of his\nslavery were counted. He had begun to hope that he was now about to\nenter into a free land, a land delicious with milk which he himself\nmight quaff, and honey which would not tantalise him by being only\nhoney to the eye. When Mrs Proudie banged the door, as she left his\nroom, he felt himself every inch a bishop. To be sure his spirit\nhad been a little cowed by his chaplain's subsequent lecture; but\non the whole he was highly pleased with himself, and flattered\nhimself that the worst was over. 'Ce n'est que le premier pas qui\ncoute', he reflected; and now that his first step had been so\nmagnanimously taken, all the rest would follow easily.\n\nHe met his wife as a matter of course at dinner, where little or\nnothing was said that could ruffle the bishop's happiness. His\ndaughters and the servants were present and protected him.\n\nHe made one or two trifling remarks on the subject of his projected\nvisit to the archbishop, in order to show to all concerned that he\nintended to have his own way; and the very servants perceiving the\nchange transferred a little of their reverence from their mistress\nto their master. All which the master perceived; and so also did\nthe mistress. But Mrs Proudie bided her time.\n\nAfter dinner he returned to his study where Mr Slope soon found\nhim, and there they had tea together and planned many things. For\nsome few minutes the bishop was really happy; but as the clock on\nthe chimney piece warned him that the stilly hours of night were\ndrawing on, as he looked at his chamber candlestick and knew that\nhe must use it, his heart sank within him again. He was as a ghost,\nall whose power of wandering free through these upper regions\nceases at cock-crow; or rather he was the opposite of the ghost,\nfor till cock-crow he must again be a serf. And would that be all?\nCould he trust himself to come down to breakfast a free man in the\nmorning?\n\nHe was nearly an hour later than usual, when he betook himself to\nhis rest. Rest! What rest? However, he took a couple of glasses of\nsherry, and mounted the stairs. Far be it from us to follow him\nthither. There are some things which no novelist, no historian,\nshould attempt; some few scenes in life's drama which even no poet\nshould dare to paint. Let that which passed between Dr Proudie and\nhis wife on this night be understood to be among them.\n\nHe came down the following morning a sad and thoughtful man. He was\nattenuated in appearance; one might almost say emaciated. I doubt\nwhether his now grizzled looks had not palpably become more grey\nthan on the preceding evening. At any rate he had aged materially.\nYears do not make a man old gradually and at an even pace. Look\nthrough the world and see if this is not so always, except in those\nrare cases in which the human being lives and dies without joys and\nwithout sorrows, like a vegetable. A man shall be possessed of\nflorid youthful blooming health till it matters not what age.\nThirty--forty--fifty, then comes some nipping frost, some period of\nagony, that robs the fibres of the body of their succulence, and\nthe hale and hearty man is counted among the old.\n\nHe came down and breakfasted alone; Mrs Proudie being indisposed\ntook her coffee in her bed-room, and her daughters waited upon her\nthere. He ate his breakfast alone, and then, hardly knowing what he\ndid, he betook himself to his usual seat in his study. He tried to\nsolace himself with his coming visit to the archbishop. That effort\nof his own free will at any rate remained to him as an enduring\ntriumph. But somehow, now that he had achieved it, he did not seem\nto care so much about it. It was his ambition that had prompted him\nto take his place at the arch-episcopal table, and his ambition was\nnow quite dead within him.\n\nHe was thus seated when Mr Slope made his appearance with\nbreathless impatience.\n\n'My lord, the dean is dead.'\n\n'Good heavens,' exclaimed the bishop, startled out of his apathy by\nan announcement so sad and so sudden.\n\n'He is either dead or now dying. He has had an apoplectic fit, and\nI am told that there is not the slightest hope; indeed, I do not\ndoubt that by this time he is no more.'\n\nBells were rung, and servants were immediately sent to inquire. In\nthe course of the morning, the bishop, leaning on his chaplain's\narm, himself called at the deanery door. Mrs Proudie sent to Miss\nTrefoil all manner of offers of assistance. The Miss Proudies sent\nalso, and there was immense sympathy between the palace and the\ndeanery. The answer to all inquiries was unvaried. The dean was\njust the same; and Sir Omicron Pie was expected there by the 9.15pm\ntrain.\n\nAnd then Mr Slope began to meditate, as others also had done, as to\nwho might possibly be the new dean; and it occurred to him, as it\nhad also occurred to others, that it might be possible that he\nshould be the new dean himself. And then the question as to the\ntwelve hundred, or fifteen hundred, or two thousand, ran in his\nmind, as it had run through those of the other clergymen in the\ncathedral library.\n\nWhether it might be two thousand, of fifteen, or twelve hundred, it\nwould in any case undoubtedly be a great thing for him, if he could\nget it. The gratification to his ambition would be greater even\nthan that of his covetousness.\n\nHow glorious to out-top the archdeacon in his own cathedral city;\nto sit above prebendaries and canons, and have the cathedral pulpit\nand all the cathedral services altogether at his own disposal!\n\nBut it might be easier to wish for this than to obtain it. Mr\nSlope, however, was not without some means of forwarding his views,\nand he at any rate did not let the grass grow under his feet. In\nthe first place he thought--and not vainly--that he could count\nupon what assistance the bishop could give him. He immediately\nchanged his views with regard to his patron; he made up his mind\nthat if he became dean, he would hand his lordship back to his\nwife's vassalage; and he thought it possible that his lordship\nmight not be sorry to rid himself of one of his mentors. Mr Slope\nhad also taken some steps towards making his name known to other\nmen in power. There was a certain chief-commissioner of national\nschools who at the present moment was presumed to stand especially\nhigh in the good graces of the government big wigs, and with him Mr\nSlope had contrived to establish a sort of epistolary intimacy. He\nthought that he might safely apply to Sir Nicholas Fitzhiggin; and\nhe felt sure that if Sir Nicholas chose to exert himself, the\npromise of such a piece of preferment would be had for the asking\nfor.\n\nThen he also had the press at his bidding, or flattered himself\nthat he had so. The daily Jupiter had taken his part in a very\nthorough manner in those polemical contests of his with Mr Arabin;\nhe had on more than one occasion absolutely had an interview with a\ngentleman on the staff of the paper, who, if not the editor, was as\ngood as the editor; and had long been in the habit of writing\ntelling letters with his initials, and sent to his editorial friend\nwith private notes signed in his own name. Indeed, he and Mr\nTowers--such was the name of the powerful gentleman of the press\nwith whom he was connected--were generally very amiable with each\nother. Mr Slope's little productions were always printed and\noccasionally commented upon; and thus, in a small sort of way, he\nhad become a literary celebrity. This public life had great charms\nfor him, though it certainly also had its drawbacks. On one\noccasion, when speaking in the presence of reporters, he had failed\nto uphold and praise and swear by that special line of conduct\nwhich had been upheld and praised and sworn by in the Jupiter, and\nthen he had been much surprised and at the moment not a little\nirritated to find himself lacerated most unmercifully by his old\nally. He was quizzed and bespattered and made a fool of, just as\nthough, or rather than if, he had been a constant enemy instead of\na constant friend. He had hitherto not learnt that a man who\naspires to be on the staff of the Jupiter must surrender all\nindividuality. But ultimately this little castigation had broken no\nbones between him and his friend Mr Towers. Mr Slope was one of\nthose who understood the world too well to show himself angry with\nsuch a potentate as the Jupiter. He had kissed the rod that\nscourged him, and now thought that he might fairly look for his\nreward. He determined that he would at once let Mr Towers know that\nhe was a candidate for the place which was about to be become\nvacant. More than one place of preferment had lately been given\naway much in accordance with advice tendered to the government in\nthe columns of the Jupiter.\n\nBut it was in incumbent on Mr Slope first to secure the bishop. He\nspecially felt that it behoved him to do this before the visit to\nthe archbishop was made. It was really quite providential that the\ndean should have fallen ill just at the very nick of time. If Dr\nProudie could be instigated to take the matter up warmly, he might\nmanage a good deal while staying at the archbishop's palace.\nFeeling this very strongly Mr Slope determined to sound the bishop\nout that very afternoon. He was to start on the following morning\nto London, and therefore not a moment could be lost with safety.\n\nHe went into the bishop's study about five o'clock, and found him\nstill sitting alone. It might have been supposed that he had hardly\nmoved since the little excitement occasioned by the walk to the\ndean's door. He still wore on his face that dull dead look of half\nunconscious suffering. He was doing nothing, reading nothing,\nthinking of nothing, but simply gazing on vacancy when Mr Slope for\nthe second time that day entered his room.\n\n'Well, Slope,' said he, somewhat impatiently; for, to tell the\ntruth, he was not anxious just at present to have much conversation\nwith Mr Slope.\n\n'Your lordship will be sorry to hear that as yet the poor dean has\nshown no signs of amendment.'\n\n'Oh--ah--hasn't he? Poor man! I'm sure I'm very sorry. I suppose\nSir Omicron has not arrived yet?'\n\n'No; not till the 9.15pm train.'\n\n'I wonder they didn't have a special. They say Dr Trefoil is very\nrich.'\n\n'Very rich, I believe,' said Mr Slope. 'But the truth is, all the\ndoctors in London can do no good; no other good than to show that\nevery possible care has been taken. Poor Dr Trefoil is not long for\nthis world, my lord.'\n\n'I suppose not--I suppose not.'\n\n'Oh no; indeed, his best friends could not wish that he should\noutlive such a shock, for his intellect cannot possibly survive\nit.'\n\n'Poor man, poor man!' said the bishop.\n\n'It will naturally be a matter of much moment to your lordship who\nis to succeed him,' said Mr Slope. 'It would be a great thing if\nyou could secure the appointment for some person of your own way of\nthinking on important points. The party hostile to us are very\nstrong here in Barchester--much too strong.'\n\n'Yes, yes. If poor Dr Trefoil is to go, it will be a great thing to\nget a good man in his place.'\n\n'It will be everything to your lordship to get a man on whose\nco-operation you can reckon. Only think what trouble we might have\nif Dr Grantly, or Dr Hyandry, or any of that way of thinking, were\nto get it.'\n\n'It is not very probable that Lord--will give it to any of that\nschool; why should he?'\n\n'No. Not probable; certainly not; but it's possible. Great interest\nwill probably be made. If I might venture to advise your lordship,\nI would suggest that you should discuss the matter with his grace\nnext week. I have no doubt that your wishes, if made known and\nbacked by his grace, would be paramount with Lord--'\n\n'Well, I don't know that; Lord - has always been very kind to me,\nvery kind. But I am unwilling to interfere in such matters unless\nasked. And indeed, if asked, I don't know whom, at this moment, I\nshould recommend.'\n\nMr Slope, even Mr Slope, felt at present rather abashed. He hardly\nknew how to frame his little request in language sufficiently\nmodest. He had recognised and acknowledged, to himself the\nnecessity of shocking the bishop in the first instance by the\ntemerity of his application, and his difficulty was how best to\nremedy that by his adroitness and eloquence. 'I doubted myself,'\nsaid he, 'whether your lordship would have any one immediately in\nyour eye, and it is on this account that I venture to submit to you\nan idea that I have been turning over in my own mind. If poor Dr\nTrefoil must go, I really do not see why, with your lordship's\nassistance, I should not hold the preferment myself.'\n\n'You!' exclaimed the bishop, in a manner that Mr Slope could hardly\nhave considered complimentary.\n\nThe ice was now broken, and Mr Slope became fluent enough. 'I have\nbeen thinking of looking for it. If your lordship will press the\nmatter on the archbishop, I do not doubt but that I shall succeed.\nYou see I shall count upon assistance from the public press; my\nname is known, I may say, somewhat favourably known to that portion\nof the press which is now most influential with the government, and\nI have friends also in the government. But, it is from your hands\nthat I would most willingly receive the benefit. And, which should\never be the chief consideration in such matters, you must know\nbetter than any other person whatsoever what qualifications I\npossess.'\n\nThe bishop sat for a while dumfounded. Mr Slope dean of Barchester!\nThe idea of such a transformation of character would never have\noccurred to his own unaided intellect. At first he went on thinking\nwhy, for what reasons, on what account, Mr Slope should be dean of\nBarchester. But by degrees the direction of his thoughts changed,\nand he began to think why, for what reasons, on what account, Mr\nSlope should not be dean of Barchester. As far as he himself, the\nbishop, was concerned, he could well spare the services of his\nchaplain. The little idea of using Mr Slope as a counterpoise to\nhis wife had well nigh evaporated. He had all but acknowledged the\nfutility of the scheme. If indeed he could have slept in his\nchaplain's bed-room instead of his wife's there might have been\nsomething in it. But---. And thus as Mr Slope as speaking, the\nbishop began to recognise the idea that that gentleman might become\ndean of Barchester without impropriety; not moved, indeed, by Mr\nSlope's eloquence, for he did not follow the tenor of his speech;\nbut led thereto by his own cogitation.\n\n'I need not say,' continued Mr Slope, 'that it would be my chief\ndesire to act in all matters connected with cathedral as far as\npossible in accordance with your views. I know your lordship so\nwell (and I hope you know me well enough to have the same\nfeelings), that I am satisfied that my being in that position would\nadd materially to your own comfort, and enable you to extend the\nsphere of your useful influence. As I said before, it is not\ndesirable that there should be but one opinion among the\ndignitaries in the same diocese. I doubt much whether I would\naccept such an appointment in any diocese in which I should be\nconstrained to differ much from the bishop. In this case there\nwould be a delightful uniformity of opinion.'\n\nMr Slope perfectly well perceived that the bishop did not follow a\nword that he said, but nevertheless he went on talking. He knew it\nwas necessary that Dr Proudie should recover from his surprise, and\nhe knew also that he must give him the opportunity of appearing to\nhave been persuaded by argument. So he went on, and produced a\nmultitude of fitting reasons all tending to show that no one on\nearth could make so good a dean of Barchester as himself, that the\ngovernment and the public would assuredly coincide in desiring that\nhe, Mr Slope, should be dean of Barchester; but that for high\nconsiderations of ecclesiastical polity, it would be especially\ndesirable that this piece of preferment should be so bestowed\nthrough the instrumentality of the bishop of the diocese.\n\n'But I really don't know what I could do in the matter,' said the\nbishop.\n\n'If you would mention it to the archbishop; if you would tell his\ngrace that you consider such an appointment very desirable, that\nyou have it much at heart with a view of putting an end to the\nschism in the diocese; if you did this with your usual energy, you\nwould probably find no difficulty in inducing his grace to promise\nthat he would mention it to Lord -. Of course you would let the\narchbishop know that I am not looking for the preferment solely\nthrough his intervention; that you do not exactly require him to\nask it as a favour; that you expect I shall get it through other\nsources, as is indeed the case; but that you are very anxious that\nhis grace should express his approval of such an arrangement to\nLord--'\n\nIt ended by the bishop promising to do as he was told. Not that he\nso promised without a stipulation. 'About that hospital,' he said,\nin the middle of the conference. 'I was never so troubled in my\nlife;' which was about the truth. 'You haven't spoken to Mr Harding\nsince I saw you?'\n\nMr Slope assured his patron that he had not.\n\n'Ah well then--I think upon the whole it will be better to let Mr\nQuiverful have it. It has been half promised to him, and he has a\nlarge family and is very poor. I think on the whole it will be\nbetter to make out the nomination for Mr Quiverful.'\n\n'But, my lord,' said Mr Slope, still thinking that was bound to\nmake a fight for his own view on this matter, and remembering that\nit still behoved him to maintain his lately acquired supremacy over\nMrs Proudie, lest he should fail in his views regarding the\ndeanery, 'but, my lord, I am really much afraid--'\n\n'Remember, Mr Slope, 'I can hold out not sort of hope to you in\nthis matter of succeeding poor Dr Trefoil. I will certainly speak\nto the archbishop, as you wish it, but I cannot think--'\n\n'Well, my lord,' said Mr Slope, fully understanding the bishop, and\nin his turn interrupting him, 'perhaps your lordship is right about\nMr Quiverful. I have no doubt I can easily arrange matters with Mr\nHarding, and I will make out the nomination for your signature as\nyou direct.'\n\n'Yes, Slope, I think that will be best; and you may be sure that\nany little that I can do to forward your views shall be done.'\n\nAnd so they parted.\n\nMr Slope had now much business to handle. He had to make his daily\nvisit to the signora. This common prudence should have now induced\nhim to omit, but he was infatuated; and could not bring himself to\nbe commonly prudent. He determined therefore that he would drink\ntea at the Stanhope's; and he determined also, or thought that he\ndetermined, that having done so he would go thither no more. He had\nalso to arrange his matters with Mrs Bold. He was of the opinion\nthat Eleanor would grace the deanery as perfectly as she would the\nchaplain's cottage; and he thought, moreover, that Eleanor's\nfortune would excellently repair and dilapidations and curtailments\nin the dean's stipend which might have been made by that ruthless\necclesiastical commission.\n\nTouching Mrs Bold his hopes now soared high. Mr Slope was one of\nthe numerous multitude of swains who think that all is fair in\nlove, and he had accordingly not refrained from using the services\nof Mrs Bold's own maid. From her he had learnt much of what had\ntaken place at Plumstead; not exactly with truth, for the 'own\nmaid' had not been able to divine the exact truth, but with some\nsort of similitude to it. He had been told that the archdeacon and\nMrs Grantly and Mr Harding and Mr Arabin had all quarrelled with\n'missus' for having received a letter from Mr Slope; that 'missus'\nhad positively refused to give the letter up; that she had received\nfrom the archdeacon the option of giving up either Mr Slope and his\nletter, or the society of Plumstead rectory; and that 'missus' had\ndeclared with much indignation, that 'she didn't care a straw for\nthe society of Plumstead rectory,' and that she wouldn't give up Mr\nSlope for any of them.\n\nConsidering the source from whence this came, it was not quite so\nuntrue as might have been expected. It showed pretty plainly what\nhad been the nature of the conversation in the servants' hall; and\ncoupled as it was with the certainty of Eleanor's sudden return, it\nappeared to Mr Slope to be so far worthy of credit as to justify\nhim in thinking that the fair widow would in all human probability\naccept his offer.\n\nAll this work had therefore to be done. It was desirable he thought\nthat he should make his offer before it was known that Mr Quiverful\nwas finally appointed to the hospital. In his letter to Eleanor he\nhad plainly declared that Mr Harding was to have the appointment.\nIt would be very difficult to explain this away; and were he to\nwrite another letter to Eleanor, telling the truth and throwing the\nblame on the bishop, it would naturally injure him in her\nestimation. He determined therefore to let that matter disclose\nitself as it would, and to lose no time in throwing himself at her\nfeet.\n\nThen he had to solicit the assistance of Sir Nicholas Fitzwhiggin\nand Mr Towers, and he went directly from the bishop's presence to\ncompose his letters to those gentlemen. As Mr Slope was esteemed as\nan adept at letter writing, they shall be given in full.\n\n'Palace, Barchester, Sept 185-, '(Private)\n\n'My dear Sir Nicholas,--I hope that the intercourse which has been\nbetween us will preclude you from regarding my present application\nas an intrusion. You cannot I imagine have yet heard that poor dear\nold Dr Trefoil has been seized with apoplexy. It is a subject of\nprofound grief to every one in Barchester, for he has always been\nan excellent man--excellent as man and as a clergyman. He is,\nhowever, full of years, and his life could not under any\ncircumstances have been much longer spared. You may probably have\nknown him.\n\n'There is, it appears, no probable chance of his recovery. Sir\nOmicron Pie is, I believe, at present with him. At any rate the\nmedical men here have declared that one or two days more must limit\nthe tether of his mortal coil. I sincerely trust that his soul may\nwing its flight to that haven where it may for ever be at rest and\nfor ever be happy.\n\n'The bishop has been speaking to me about the preferment, and he is\nanxious that it should be conferred on me. I confess that I can\nhardly venture, at my age, to look for such advancement; but I am\nso far encouraged by his lordship, that I believe I shall be\ninduced to do so. His lordship goes to London tomorrow, and is\nintent on mentioning the subject to the archbishop.\n\n'I know well how deservedly great is your weight with the present\ngovernment. In any matter touching church preferment you would of\ncourse be listened to. Now that the matter has been put into my\nhead, I am of course anxious to be successful. If you can assist me\nby your good word, you will confer on me one additional favour.\n\n'I had better add, that Lord - cannot as yet know of this piece of\npreferment having fallen in, or rather of the certainty of falling\n(for poor dear Dr Trefoil is past hope). Should Lord - first hear\nit from you, that might probably bee thought to give you a fair\nclaim to express your opinion.\n\n'Of course our grand object is, that we should all be of one\nopinion in church matters. This is most desirable at Barchester; it\nis this that makes our good bishop so anxious about it. You may\nprobably think it expedient to point this out to Lord - if it shall\nbe in your power to oblige me by mentioning the subject to his\nlordship.\n\n'Believe me, my dear Sir Nicholas, 'Your most faithful servant,\nOBADIAH SLOPE.'\n\nHis letter to Mr Towers was written in quite a different strain. Mr\nSlope conceived that he completely understood the difference in\ncharacter and position of the two men whom he addressed. He knew\nthat for such a man as Sir Nicholas Fitzwhiggin a little flummery\nwas necessary, and that it might be of the easy everyday\ndescription. Accordingly, his letter to Sir Nicholas was written\ncurrente calamo, with very little trouble. But to such a man as Mr\nTowers it was not so easy to write a letter that should be\neffective and yet not offensive, that should carry its point\nwithout undue interference. It was not difficult to flatter Dr\nProudie, or Sir Nicholas Fitzwhiggin, but very difficult to flatter\nMr Towers without letting the flattery declare itself. This,\nhowever, had to be done. Moreover, this letter must in appearance\nat least, be written without effort, and be fluent, unconstrained,\nand demonstrative of no doubt or fear on the part of the writer.\nTherefor the epistle to Mr Towers was studied, and recopied, and\nelaborated at the cost of so many minutes, that Mr Slope had hardly\ntime to dress himself and reach Dr Stanhope's that evening.\n\nWhen dispatched it ran as follows:-\n\n'Barchester, Sept 185- (He purposely omitted any allusion to the\n'palace', thinking that Mr Towers might not like it. A great man,\nhe remembered, had been once much condemned for dating a letter\nfrom Windsor Castle.)\n\n'(Private)\n\n'My dear Sir,--We were all a good deal shocked here this morning by\nhearing that poor old Dean Trefoil had been stricken with apoplexy.\nThe fit took him about 9am. I am writing now to save the post, and\nhe is still alive, but past all hope, or possibility, I believe, of\nliving. Sir Omicron Pie is here, or will be very shortly; but all\nthat even Sir Omicron can do, is to ratify the sentence of his less\ndistinguished brethren that nothing can be done. Poor Dr Trefoil's\nrace on this side of the grave is run. I do not know whether you\nknew him. He was a good, quiet, charitable man, of the old school\nof course, as any clergyman over seventy years of age must\nnecessarily be.\n\n'But I do not write merely with the object of sending you such news\nas this: doubtless some one of your Mercuries will have seen and\nheard and reported so much; I write, as you usually do yourself,\nrather with a view to the future than to the past.\n\n'Rumour is already rife her as to Dr Trefoil's successor, and among\nthose named as possible future deans your humble servant is, I\nbelieve, not the least frequently spoken of; in short, I am looking\nfor the preferment. You may probably know that since Bishop Proudie\ncame to this diocese, I have exerted myself a good deal; and I may\ncertainly say not without some success. He and I are nearly always\nof the same opinion on points of doctrine as well as church\ndiscipline, and therefore I have had, as his confidential chaplain,\nvery much in my own hands; but I confess to you that I have a\nhigher ambition than to remain the chaplain of any bishop.\n\n'There are no positions in which more energy is now needed than in\nthose of our deans. The whole of our enormous cathedral\nestablishments have been allowed to go to sleep,--nay, they are all\nbut dead and ready for the sepulchre! And yet of what prodigious\nmoment they might be made, if, as we intend, they were so managed\nas to lead the way and show an example for all our parochial\nclergy!\n\n'The bishop here is most anxious for my success; indeed, he goes\nto-morrow to press the matter on the archbishop. I believe also I\nmay count on the support of at least one of the most effective\nmember of the government. But I confess the support of the Jupiter,\nif I be thought worthy of it, would be more gratifying to me than\nany other; more gratifying if by it I should be successful; and\nmore gratifying also, if, although, so supported, I should be\nunsuccessful.\n\n'The time has, in fact, come in which no government can venture to\nfill up the high places of the Church in defiance of the public\npress. The age of honourable bishops and noble deans has gone by;\nand any clergyman however humbly born can now hope for success, if\nhis industry, talent, and character, be sufficient to call forth\nthe manifest opinion of the public in his favour.\n\n'At the present moment we all feel that any counsel given in such\nmatters by the Jupiter has the greatest weight,--is, indeed,\ngenerally followed; and we feel also--I am speaking of clergymen of\nmy own age and standing--that it should be so. There can be no\npatron less interested than the Jupiter, and none that more\nthoroughly understands the wants of the people.\n\n'I am sure you will not suspect me of asking from you any support\nwhich the paper with which you are connected cannot conscientiously\ngive me. My object in writing is to let you know that I am a\ncandidate for the appointment. It is for you to judge whether or no\nyou can assist my views. I should not, of course, have written to\nyou on such a matter had I not believed (and I have had good reason\nso to believe) that the Jupiter approves of my views on\necclesiastical polity.\n\n'The bishop expresses a fear that I may be considered too young for\nsuch a station, my age being thirty-six. I cannot think that at the\npresent day any hesitation need be felt on such a point. The public\nhas lost its love for antiquated servants. If a man will ever be\nfit to do good work he will be fit at thirty-six years of age.\n\n'Believe me very faithfully yours, OBADIAH SLOPE\n\n'T. TOWERS, Esq., 'Middle Temple.'\n\nHaving thus exerted himself, Mr Slope posted his letters, and\npassed the remainder of the evening at the feet of his mistress.\n\nMr Slope will be accused of deceit in his mode of canvassing. It\nwill be said that he lied in the application he made to each of his\nthree patrons. I believe it must be owned that he did so. He could\nnot hesitate on account of his youth, and yet, be quite assured\nthat he was not too young. He could not count chiefly on the\nbishop's support, and chiefly also on that of the newspaper. He did\nnot think that the bishop was going to press the matter on the\narchbishop. It must be owned that in his canvassing Mr Slope was as\nfalse as he well could be.\n\nLet it, however, be asked of those who are conversant with such\nmatters, whether he was more false than men usually are on such\noccasions. We English gentlemen hate the name of a lie; but how\noften do we find public men who believe each other's words?\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\nMRS PROUDIE VICTRIX\n\nThe next week passed over at Barchester with much apparent\ntranquillity. The hearts, however, of some of the inhabitants were\nnot so tranquil as the streets of the city. The poor old dean still\ncontinued to live, just as Sir Omicron had prophesied that he would\ndo, much to amazement, and some thought, disgust, of Dr Fillgrave.\nThe bishop still remained away. He had stayed a day or two in town,\nand had also remained longer at the archbishop's than he had\nintended. Mr Slope had as yet received no line in answer to either\nof his letters; but he had learnt the cause of this. Sir Nicholas\nwas stalking a deer, or attending the Queen, in the Highlands; and\neven the indefatigable Mr Towers had stolen an autumn holiday, and\nhad made one of the yearly tribe who now ascend Mont Blanc. Mr\nSlope learnt that he was not expected back till the last day of\nSeptember.\n\nMrs Bold was thrown much with the Stanhopes, of whom she became\nfonder and fonder. If asked, she would have said that Charlotte\nStanhope was her special friend, and so she would have thought.\nBut, to tell the truth, she liked Bertie nearly as well; she had no\nmore idea of regarding him as a lover than she would have had of\nlooking at a big tame dog in such a light. Bertie had become very\nintimate with her, and made little speeches to her, and said little\nthings of sort very different from the speeches and sayings of\nother men. But then this was almost always done before his sisters;\nand he, with his long silken beard, his light blue eyes and strange\ndress, was so unlike other men. She admitted him to a kind of\nfamiliarity which she had never known with any one else, and of\nwhich she by no means understood the danger. She blushed once at\nfinding that she had called him Bertie, and on the same day only\nbarely remembered her position in time to check herself from\nplaying upon him some personal practical joke to which she was\ninstigated by Charlotte.\n\nIn all this Eleanor was perfectly innocent, and Bertie Stanhope\ncould hardly be called guilty. But every familiarity into which\nEleanor was entrapped was deliberately planned by his sister. She\nknew well how to play her game, and played it without mercy; she\nknew, none so well, what was her brother's character, and she would\nhave handed over to him the young widow, and the young widow's\nmoney, and the money of the widow's child, without remorse. With\nher pretended friendship and warm cordiality, she strove to connect\nEleanor so closely with her brother as to make it impossible that\nshe should go back even if she wished it. But Charlotte Stanhope\nknew really nothing of Eleanor's character; did not even understand\nthat there were such characters. She did not comprehend that a\nyoung and pretty woman could be playful and familiar with a man\nsuch as Bertie Stanhope, and yet have no idea in her head, no\nfeeling in her heart that she would have been ashamed to own to all\nthe world. Charlotte Stanhope did not in the least conceive that\nher new friend was a woman whom nothing could entrap into an\ninconsiderate marriage, whose mind would have revolted from the\nslightest impropriety had she been aware that any impropriety\nexisted.\n\nMiss Stanhope, however, had tact enough to make herself and her\nfather's house very agreeable to Mrs Bold. There was with them all\nan absence of stiffness and formality which was peculiarly\nagreeable to Eleanor after the great dose of clerical arrogance\nwhich she had lately been constrained to take. She played chess\nwith them, walked with them, and drank tea with them; studied or\npretended to study astronomy; assisted them in writing stories in\nrhyme, in turning prose tragedy into comic verse, or comic stories\ninto would-be tragic poetry. She had no idea before that she had\nany such talents. She had not conceived the possibility of her\ndoing such things as she now did. She found with the Stanshopes new\namusements and employments, new pursuits, which in themselves could\nnot be wrong, and which were exceedingly alluring.\n\nIs it not a pity that people who are bright and clever should so\noften be exceedingly improper? And that those who are never\nimproper should so often be dull and heavy? Now Charlotte Stanhope\nwas always bright, and never heavy: but her propriety was doubtful.\n\nBut during all this time Eleanor by no means forgot Mr Arabin, nor\ndid she forget Mr Slope. She had parted from Mr Arabin in her\nanger. She was still angry at what she regarded as his impertinent\ninterference; but nevertheless she looked forward to meeting him\nagain; and also looked forward to forgiving him. The words that Mr\nArabin had uttered still sounded in her ears. She knew that if not\nintended for a declaration of love, they did signify that he loved\nher; and she felt also that if he ever did make such a declaration,\nit might be that she should not receive it unkindly. She was still\nangry with him, very angry with him; so angry that she would bit\nher lip and stamp her foot as she thought of what he had said and\ndone. But nevertheless she yearned to let him know that he was\nforgiven; all that she required was that he should own that he had\nsinned.\n\nShe was to meet him at Ullathorne on the last day of the present\nmonth. Miss Thorne had invited all the country round to a breakfast\non the lawn. There were to be tents and archery, and dancing for\nthe ladies on the lawn, and for the swains and girls in the\npaddock. There were to be fiddlers and fifers, races for the boys,\npoles to be climbed, ditches full of water to be jumped over,\nhorse-collars to be grinned through (this latter amusement was an\naddition of the stewards, and not arranged by Miss Thorne in the\noriginal programme), and every game to be played which, in a long\ncourse of reading, Miss Thorne could ascertain to have been played\nin the good days of Queen Elizabeth. Everything of more modern\ngrowth was to be tabooed, if possible. On one subject Miss Thorne\nwas very unhappy. She had been turning in her mind the matter of\nthe bull-ring, but could not succeed in making anything of it. She\nwould not for the world have done, or allowed to be done, anything\nthat was cruel; as to the promoting the torture of a bull for the\namusement of her young neighbours, it need hardly be said that Miss\nThorne would be the last to think of it. And yet, there was\nsomething so charming in the name. A bull-ring, however, without a\nbull would only be a memento of the decadence of the times, and she\nfelt herself constrained to abandon the idea. Quintains, however,\nshe was determined to have, and had poles and swivels and bags of\nflour prepared accordingly. She would no doubt have been anxious\nfor something small in the way of a tournament; but, as she said to\nher brother, that had been tried, and the age had proved itself too\ndecidedly inferior to its fore-runners to admit of such a pastime.\nMr Thorne did not seem to participate in her regret, feeling\nperhaps that a full suit of chain-armour would have added but\nlittle to his own personal comfort.\n\nThis party at Ullathorne had been planned in the first place as a\nsort of welcoming to Mr Arabin on his entrance into St Ewold's\nparsonage; an intended harvest-home gala for the labourers and\ntheir wives and children had subsequently been amalgamated with it,\nand thus it had grown into its present dimensions. All the\nPlumstead party had of course been asked, at the time of the\ninvitation Eleanor had intended to have gone with her sister. Now\nher plans were altered, and she was going with the Stanhopes. The\nProudies were also to be there; and as Mr Slope had not been\nincluded in the invitation to the palace, the signora, whose\nimpudence never deserted her, asked permission of Miss Thorne to\nbring him.\n\nThis permission Miss Thorne gave, having no other alternative; but\nshe did so with a trembling heart, fearing Mr Arabin would be\noffended. Immediately on his return she apologised, almost with\ntears, so dire an enmity was presumed to rage between the two\ngentlemen. But Mr Arabin comforted by an assurance that he should\nmeet Mr Slope with the greatest pleasure imaginable, and made her\npromise that she would introduce them to each other.\n\nBut this triumph of Mr Slope's was not so agreeable to Eleanor, who\nsince her return to Barchester had done her best to avoid him. She\nwould not give way to the Plumstead folk when they so ungenerously\naccused her of being in love with this odious man; but,\nnevertheless, knowing that she was so accused, she was fully alive\nto the expediency of keeping out of his way and dropping him by\ndegrees. She had seen very little of him since her return. Her\nservants had been instructed to say to all visitors that she was\nout. She could not bring herself to specify Mr Slope particularly,\nand in order to order to avoid him she had thus debarred herself\nfrom all her friends. She had excepted Charlotte Stanhope, and, by\ndegrees, a few others also. Once she had met him at the Stanhope's;\nbut, as a rule, Mr Slope's visits there had been made in the\nmorning, and hers in the evening. On that one occasion Charlotte\nhad managed to preserve her from any annoyance. This was very\ngood-natured on the part of Charlotte, as Eleanor thought, and also\nvery sharp-witted, as Eleanor had told her friend nothing of her\nreasons for wishing to avoid that gentleman. The fact, however,\nwas, that Charlotte had learnt from her sister that Mr Slope would\nprobably put himself forward as a suitor for the widow's hand, and\nshe was consequently sufficiently alive to the expediency of\nguarding Bertie's future wife from any danger in that quarter.\n\nNevertheless the Stanhopes were pledged to take Mr Slope with them\nto Ullathorne. An arrangement was therefore necessarily made, which\nwas very disagreeable to Eleanor. Dr Stanhope, with herself,\nCharlotte, and Mr Slope, were to go together, and Bertie was to\nfollow with his sister Madeline. It was clearly visible to\nEleanor's face that this assortment was very disagreeable to her;\nand Charlotte, who was much encouraged thereby in her own little\nplan, made a thousand apologies.\n\n'I see you don't like it, dear,' said she, 'but we could not manage\nit otherwise. Bertie would give his eyes to go with you, but\nMadeline cannot possibly go without him. Nor could we possibly put\nMr Slope and Madeline in the same carriage without anyone else.\nThey'd both be ruined for ever, you know, and not admitted inside\nUllathorne gates, I should imagine, after such an impropriety.'\n\n'Of course that wouldn't do,' said Eleanor; 'but couldn't I go in\nthe carriage with the signora and your brother?'\n\n'Impossible!' said Charlotte. 'When she is there, there is only\nroom for two.' The signora, in truth, did not care to do her\ntravelling in the presence of strangers.\n\n'Well, then,' said Eleanor, 'you are all so kind, Charlotte, and so\ngood to me, that I am sure you won't be offended; but I think I\nshall not go at all.'\n\n'Not go at all!--what nonsense!--indeed you shall.' it had been\nabsolutely determined in family council that Bertie should propose\non that very occasion.\n\n'Or I can take a fly,' said Eleanor. 'You know that I am not\nembarrassed by so many difficulties as you young ladies. I can go\nalone.'\n\n'Nonsense, my dear. Don't think of such a thing; after all it is\nonly for an hour or so, and to tell the truth, I don't know what it is\nyou dislike so. I thought you and Mr Slope were great friends. What\nis it you dislike?'\n\n'Oh; nothing particular,' said Eleanor; 'only I thought it would be\na family party.'\n\n'Of course it would be much nicer, much more snug, if Bertie would\ngo with us. It is he that is badly treated. I can assure you he is\nmuch more afraid of Mr Slope than you are. But you see Madeline\ncannot go without him,--and she, poor creature, goes out so seldom!\nI am sure you don't begrudge her this, though her vagary does knock\nabout our own party a little.'\n\nOf course Eleanor made a thousand protestations, a uttered a\nthousand hopes that Madeline would enjoy herself. And of course she\nhad to give way, and undertake to go in the carriage with Mr Slope.\nIn fact, she was driven either to so this, or to explain why she\nwould not do so. Now she could not bring herself to explain to\nCharlotte Stanhope all that had passed at Plumstead.\n\nBut it was to her a sore necessity. She thought of a thousand\nlittle schemes for avoiding it; she would plead illness, and not go\nat all; she would persuade Mary Bold to go although not asked, and\nthen make a necessity of having a carriage of her own to take her\nsister-in-law; anything, in fact, she could do rather than be seen\nin the same carriage with Mr Slope. However, when the momentous\nmorning came she had no scheme matured, and then Mr Slope handed\nher into Dr Stanhope's carriage, and following her steps, sat\nopposite to her.\n\nThe bishop returned on the eve of the Ullathorne party, and was\nreceived at home with radiant smiles by the partner of all his\ncares. On his arrival he crept up to his dressing-room with\nsomewhat of a palpitating heart; he had overstayed his allotted\ntime by three days, and was not without fear of penalties. Nothing,\nhowever, could be more affectionately cordial than the greeting he\nreceived; the girls came out and kissed him in a manner that was\nquite soothing to his spirit; and Mrs Proudie, arms, and almost in\nwords called him her dear, darling, good, pet, little bishop. All\nthis was a very pleasant surprise.\n\nMrs Proudie had somewhat changed her tactics; not that she had seen\nany cause to disapprove of her former line of conduct, but she had\nnow brought matters to such a point that she calculated that she\nmight safely do so. She had got the better of Mr Slope, and she now\nthought well to show her husband that when allowed to get the\nbetter of everybody, when obeyed by him and permitted to rule over\nothers, she would take care that he should have his reward. Mr\nSlope had not a chance against her; not only could she stun the\npoor bishop by her midnight anger, but she could assuage and soothe\nhim, if she so willed by daily indulgences. She could furnish his\nroom for him, turn him out as smart a bishop as any on the bench,\ngive him good dinners, warm fires, and an easy life; all this she\nwould do if he would but be quietly obedient. But if not--! To\nspeak sooth, however, his sufferings on that dreadful night had\nbeen as poignant, as to leave him little spirit for further\nrebellion.\n\nAs soon as he had dressed himself she returned to his room. 'I hope\nyou enjoyed yourself at--' said she, seating herself on one side of\nthe fire while he remained in his arm-chair on the other, stroking\nthe calves of his legs. It was the first time he had had a fire in\nhis room since the summer, and it pleased him; for the good bishop\nloved to be warm and cosy. Nothing could be more polite than the\narchbishop; and Mrs Archbishop had been equally charming.\n\nMrs Proudie was delighted to hear it; nothing, she declared,\npleased her so much as to think\n\n      Her bairn respectit like the lave.\n\nShe did not put it precisely in these words, but what she said came\nto the same thing; and then, having petted and fondled her little\nman sufficiently, she proceeded to business.\n\n'The poor dean is still alive,' said she.\n\n'So I hear, so I hear,' said the bishop. 'I'll go to the deanery\ndirectly after breakfast to-morrow.'\n\n'We are going to this party at Ullathorne to-morrow morning, my\ndear; we must be there early, you know,--by twelve o'clock I\nsuppose.'\n\n'Oh,--ah!' said the bishop; 'then I'll certainly call the next day.\n\n'Was much said about it at--?' asked Mrs Proudie.\n\n'About what?' said the bishop.\n\n'Filling up the dean's place,' said Mrs Proudie. As she spoke a\nspark of the wonted fire returned to her eye, and the bishop felt\nhimself to be a little less comfortable than before.\n\n'Filling up the dean's place; that is, if the dean dies?--very\nlittle, my dear. It was mentioned, just mentioned.'\n\n'And what did you say about it, bishop?'\n\n'Why I said that I thought that if, that is, should--should the\ndean die, that is, I said I thought--' As he went on stammering and\nfloundering, he saw that his wife's eye was fixed sternly on him.\nWhy should he encounter such evil for a man whom he loved so\nslightly as Mr Slope? Why should he give up his enjoyments and his\nease, and such dignity as might be allowed to him, to fight a\nlosing battle for a chaplain? The chaplain after all, if\nsuccessful, would be as great a tyrant as his wife. Why fight at\nall? Why contend? Why be uneasy? From that moment he determined to\nfling Mr Slope to the winds, and take the goods the gods provided.\n\n'I am told,' said Mrs Proudie, speaking very slowly, 'that Mr Slope\nis looking to be the new dean.'\n\n'Yes,--certainly, I believe he is,' said the bishop.\n\n'And what does the archbishop say about that?' asked Mrs Proudie.\n\n'Well, my dear, to tell the truth, I promised Mr Slope to speak to\nthe archbishop. Mr Slope spoke to me about it. It was very arrogant\nof him, I must say,--but that is nothing to me.'\n\n'Arrogant!' said Mrs Proudie; 'it is the most impudent piece of\npretension I ever heard in my life. Mr Slope dean of Barchester,\nindeed! And what did you do in the matter, bishop?'\n\n'Why, my dear, I did speak to the archbishop.'\n\n'You don't mean to tell me,' said Mrs Proudie, 'that you are going\nto make yourself ridiculous by lending your name to such\npreposterous attempts as this? Mr Slope dean of Barchester indeed!'\nAnd she tossed her head, and put her arms a-kimbo, with an air of\nconfident defiance that made her husband quite sure that Mr Slope\nnever would be Dean of Barchester. In truth, Mrs Proudie was all\nbut invincible; had she married Petruchio, it may be doubted\nwhether that arch wife-tamer would have been able to keep her legs\nout of those garments which are presumed by men to be peculiarly\nunfitted for feminine use.\n\n'It is preposterous, my dear.'\n\n'Then why have you endeavoured to assist him?'\n\n'Why,--my dear, I haven't assisted him--much.'\n\n'But why have you done it at all? Why have you mixed your name up\nin any thing so ridiculous? What was it you did say to the\narchbishop?'\n\n'Why, I did just mention it; I just did say that--that in the event\nof the poor dean's death, Mr Slope would--would--'\n\n'Would what?'\n\n'I forget how I put it,--would take it if he could get it;\nsomething of that sort. I didn't say much more than that.'\n\n'You shouldn't have said anything at all. And what did the\narchbishop say?'\n\n'He didn't say anything; he just bowed and rubbed his hands.\nSomebody else came up at the moment, and as we were discussing the\nnew parochial universal school committee, the matter of the new\ndean dropped; after that I didn't think it was wise to renew it.'\n\n'Renew it! I am very sorry you ever mentioned it. What will the\narchbishop think of that?'\n\n'You may be sure, my dear, that the archbishop thought very little\nabout it.'\n\n'But why did you think about it, bishop? How could you think of\nmaking such a creature as that Dean of Barchester?--Dean of\nBarchester! I suppose he'll be looking for bishoprics some of these\ndays--a man that hardly knows who his father was; a man that I\nfound without bread to his mouth, or a coat to his back. Dean of\nBarchester indeed! I'll dean him.'\n\nMrs Proudie considered herself to be in politics a pure Whig; all\nher family belonged to the Whig party. Now among all ranks of\nEnglishmen and Englishwomen (Mrs Proudie should, I think, be ranked\namong the former, on the score of her great strength of mind), no\none is so hostile to lowly born pretenders to high station as the\npure Whig.\n\nThe bishop thought it necessary to exculpate himself. 'Why, my\ndear,' said he, 'it appeared to me that you and Mr Slope did not\nget on quite as well as you used to do.'\n\n'Get on!' said Mrs Proudie, moving her foot uneasily on the\nhearth-rug, and compressing her lips in a manner that betokened\nsuch danger to the subject of their discourse.\n\n'I began to find that he was objectionable to you,'--Mrs Proudie's\nfoot worked on the hearth-rug with great rapidity,--'and that you\nwould be more comfortable if he was out of the palace,' Mrs Proudie\nsmiled, as a hyena may probably smile before he begins his\nlaugh,--'and therefore I thought that if he got this place, and so\nceased to be my chaplain, you might be pleased at such an\narrangement.'\n\nAnd then the hyena laughed loud. Pleased at such an arrangement!\npleased at having her enemy converted into a dean with twelve\nhundred a year! Medea, when she describes the customs of her native\ncountry (I am quoting from Robson's edition), assures her\nastonished auditor that in her land captives, when taken, are\neaten. 'You pardon them!' says Medea. 'We do indeed,' says the mild\nGrecian. 'We eat them!' says she of Colchis, with terrible energy.\nMrs Proudie was the Medea of Barchester; she had no idea of not\neating Mr Slope. Pardon him! merely get rid of him! make a dean of\nhim! It was not so they did with their captives in her country,\namong people of her sort! Mr Slope had no such mercy to expect; she\nwould pick him to the very last bone.\n\n'Oh, yes, my dear, of course he'll cease to be your chaplain,' said\nshe. 'After what has passed, that must be a matter of course. I\ncouldn't for a moment think of living in the same house with such a\nman. Besides, he has shown himself quite unfit for such a\nsituation; making broils and quarrels among the clergy, getting\nyou, my dear, into scrapes, and taking upon himself as though he\nwas as good as bishop himself. Of course he'll go. But because he\nleaves the palace, that is no reason why he should get into the\ndeanery.'\n\n'Oh, of course not!' said the bishop; 'but to save appearances you\nknow, my dear--'\n\n'I don't want to save appearances; I want Mr Slope to appear just\nwhat he is--a false, designing, mean, intriguing man. I have my eye\non him; he little knows what I see. He is misconducting himself in\nthe most disgraceful way with that lame Italian woman. That family\nis a disgrace to Barchester, and Mr Slope is a disgrace to\nBarchester! If he doesn't look well to it, he'll have his gown\nstripped off his back instead of having a dean's hat on his head.\nDean, indeed! The man has gone mad with arrogance.\n\nThe bishop said nothing further to excuse either himself or his\nchaplain, and having shown himself passive and docile was again\ntaken into favour. They soon went to dinner, and he spent the\npleasantest evening he had had in his own house for a long time.\nHis daughter played and sang to him as he sipped his coffee and\nread his newspaper, and Mrs Proudie asked good-natured little\nquestions about the archbishop; and then he went happily to bed,\nand slept as quietly as though Mrs Proudie had been Griselda\nherself. While shaving himself in the morning and preparing for the\nfestivities of Ullathorne, he fully resolved to run no more tilts\nagainst a warrior so fully armed at all points as was Mrs Proudie.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\nOXFORD--THE MASTER AND TUTOR OF LAZARUS\n\nMr Arabin, as we have said, had but a sad walk of it under the\ntrees of Plumstead churchyard. He did not appear to any of the\nfamily till dinner time, and then he assumed, as far as their\njudgment went, to be quite himself. He had, as was his wont, asked\nhimself a great many questions, and given himself a great many\nanswers; and the upshot of this was that he had set himself down\nfor an ass. He had determined that he was much too old and much to\nrusty to commence the manouvres of lovemaking; that he had let the\ntime slip through his hands which should have been used for such\npurposes; and that now he must lie on his bed as he had made it.\nThen he asked himself whether in truth he did love this woman; and\nhe answered himself, not without a long struggle, but at last\nhonestly, that he certainly did love her. He then asked himself\nwhether he did not also love her money; and he again answered\nhimself that he did so. But here he did not answer honestly. It was\nand ever had been his weakness to look for impure motives for his\nown conduct. No doubt, circumstanced as he was, with a small living\nand a fellowship, accustomed as he had been to collegiate luxuries\nand expensive comforts, he might have hesitated to marry a\npenniless woman had he felt ever so strong a predilection for the\nwoman herself; no doubt Eleanor's fortune put all such difficulties\nout of the question; but it was equally without doubt that his love\nfor her had crept upon him without the slightest idea on his part\nthat he could ever benefit his own condition by sharing her wealth.\n\nWhen he had stood on the hearth-rug, counting the pattern, and\ncounting also the future chances of his own life, the remembrances\nof Mrs Bold's comfortable income had not certainly damped his first\nassured feeling of love for her. And why should it have done so?\nNeed it have done so with the purest of men? Be that as it may, Mr\nArabin decided against himself; he decided that it had done so in\nhis case, and that he was not the purest of men.\n\nHe also decided, which was more to his purpose, that Eleanor did\nnot care a straw for him, and that very probably did not care a\nstraw for his rival. Then he made up his mind not to think of her\nany more, and went on thinking of her till he was almost in a state\nto drown himself in the little brook which was at the bottom of the\narchdeacon's grounds.\n\nAnd ever and again his mind would revert to the Signora Neroni, and\nhe would make comparisons between her and Eleanor Bold, not always\nin favour of the latter. The signora had listened to him, and\nflattered him, and believed in him; at least she had told him so.\nMrs Bold had also listened to him, but had never flattered him; had\nnot always believed in him: and now had broken from him in violent\nrage. The signora, too, was the more lovely woman of the two, and\nhad also the additional attraction of her affliction; for to him it\nwas an attraction.\n\nBut he never could have loved the Signora Neroni as he felt that he\nnow loved Eleanor! and so he flung stones into the brook, instead\nof flinging in himself, and sat down on its margin as sad a\ngentleman as you shall meet in a summer's day.\n\nHe heard the dinner-bell ring from the churchyard, and he knew that\nit was time to recover his self possession. He felt that he was\ndisgracing himself in his own eyes, that he had been idling his\ntime and neglecting the high duties which he had taken upon himself\nto perform. He should have spent the afternoon among the poor at St\nEwold's, instead of wandering about Plumstead, an ancient love-lorn\nswain, dejected and sighing, full of imaginary sorrows and\nWertherian grief. He was thoroughly ashamed of himself, and\ndetermined to lose no time in retrieving his character, so damaged\nin his own eyes. Thus when he appeared at dinner he was as animated\nas ever, and was the author of most of the conversation which\ngraced the archdeacon's board on that evening. Mr Harding was ill\nat ease and sick at heart, and did not care to appear more\ncomfortable than he really was; what little he did say was said to\nhis daughter. He thought the archdeacon and Mr Arabin had leagued\ntogether against Eleanor's comfort; and his wish now was to break\naway from the pair, and undergo in his Barchester lodgings whatever\nFate had in store for him. He hated the name of the hospital; his\nattempt to regain his lost inheritance there had brought upon him\nso much suffering. As far as he was concerned, Mr Quiverful was now\nwelcome to the place.\n\nAnd the archdeacon was not very lively. The poor dean's illness was\nof course discussed in the first place. Dr Grantly did not mention\nMr Slope's name in connexion with the expected event of Dr\nTrefoil's death; he did not wish to say anything about Mr Slope\njust at present, nor did he wish to make known his own sad\nsurmises; but the idea that his enemy might possibly become Dean of\nBarchester made him very gloomy. Should such an even take place,\nsuch a dire catastrophe come about, there would be an end to his\nlife as far as his life was connected with the city of Barchester.\nHe must give up all his old haunts, all his old habits, and live\nquietly as a retired rector at Plumstead. It had been a severe\ntrial for him to have Dr Proudie in the palace; but with Mr Slope\nalso in the deanery, he felt that he should be unable to draw his\nbreath in Barchester close.\n\nThus it came to pass that in spite of the sorrow at his heart, Mr\nArabin was apparently the gayest of the party. Both Mr Harding and\nMrs Grantly were in a slight degree angry with him on account of\nhis want of gloom. To the one it appeared as though he were\ntriumphing at Eleanor's banishment, and to the other that he was\nnot affected as he should have been by all the sad circumstances of\nthe day, Eleanor's obstinacy, Mr Slope's success, and the poor\ndean's apoplexy. And so they were all at cross purposes.\n\nMr Harding left the room almost together with the ladies, and the\narchdeacon opened his heart to Mr Arabin. He still harped upon the\nhospital. 'What did that fellow mean,' said he, 'by saying in his\nletter to Mrs Bold, that if Mr Harding would call on the bishop it\nwould be all right? Of course I would not be guided by anything he\nmight say; but still it may be well that Mr Harding should see the\nbishop. It would be foolish to let the thing slip through our\nfingers because Mrs Bold is determined to make a fool of herself.'\n\nMr Arabin hinted that he was not quite so sure that Mrs Bold would\nmake a fool of herself. He said that he was not convinced that she\ndid regard Mr Slope so warmly as she was supposed to do. The\narchdeacon questioned and cross-questioned him about this, but\nelicited nothing; and at least remained firm in his own conviction\nthat he was destined, malgre lui, to be the brother-in-law of Mr\nSlope. Mr Arabin strongly advised that Mr Harding should take no\nstep regarding the hospital in connexion with, or in consequence\nof, Mr Slope's letter. 'If the bishop really means to confer the\nappointment on Mr Harding,' argued Mr Arabin, 'he will take care to\nlet him have some other intimation than a message conveyed through\na letter to a lady. Were Mr Harding to present himself at the\npalace he might merely be playing Mr Slope's game;' and thus it was\nsettled that nothing should be done till the great Dr Gwynne's\narrival, or at any rate without that potentate's sanction.\n\nIt was droll how these men talked of Mr Harding as though he were a\npuppet, and planned their intrigues and small ecclesiastical\nmanouvres without dreaming of taking him into their confidence.\nThere was a comfortable house and income in question, and it was\nvery desirable, and certainly very just, that Mr Harding should\nhave them; but that, at present, was not the main point; it was\nexpedient to beat the bishop, and if possible to smash Mr Slope. Mr\nSlope had set up, or was supposed to have set up, a rival\ncandidate. Of all things the most desirable would have been to have\nhad Mr Quiverful's appointment published to the public, and then\nannulled by the clamour of an indignant world, loud in the defence\nof Mr Harding's rights. But of such an event the chance was small;\na slight fraction only of the world would be indignant, and that\nfraction would be one not accustomed to loud speaking. And then the\npreferment had in a sort of way been offered to Mr Harding, and had\nin a sort of way been refused by him.\n\nMr Slope's wicked, cunning hand had been peculiarly conspicuous in\nthe way in which this had been brought to pass, and it was the\nsuccess of Mr Slope's cunning which was so painfully grating the\nfeelings of the archdeacon. That which of all things he most\ndreaded was that he should be out-generalled by Mr Slope: and just\nat present it appeared probable that Mr Slope would turn his flank,\nsteal a march on him, cut off his provisions, carry his strong town\nby a coup de main, and at last beat him thoroughly in a regular\npitched battle. The archdeacon felt that his flank had been turned\nwhen desired to wait on Mr Slope instead of the bishop, that a\nmarch had been stolen when Mr Harding was induced to refuse the\nbishop's offer, that his provisions would be cut off when Mr\nQuiverful got the hospital, that Eleanor was the strong town doomed\nto be taken, and that Mr Slope, as Dean of Barchester, would be\nregarded by all the world as the conqueror in that final conflict.\n\nDr Gwyinne was the Deus ex machina who was to come down upon the\nBarchester stage, and bring about deliverance from these terrible\nevils. But how can melodramatic denouments be properly brought\nabout, how can vice and Mr Slope be punished, and virtue and the\narchdeacon be rewarded, while the avenging god is laid up with the\ngout? In the mean time evil may be triumphant, and poor innocence,\ntransfixed to the earth by an arrow from Dr Proudie's quiver, may\nbe dead upon the ground, not to be resuscitated even by Dr Gwynne.\n\nTwo or three days after Eleanor's departure, Mr Arabin went to\nOxford, and soon found himself closeted with the august head of his\ncollege. It was quite clear that Dr Gwynne was not very sanguine as\nto the effects of his journey to Barchester, and not over anxious\nto interfere with the bishop. He had had the gout but was very\nnearly convalescent, and Mr Arabin at once saw that had the mission\nbeen one of which the master thoroughly approved, he would before\nthis have been at Plumstead.\n\nAs it was, Dr Gwynne was resolved to visiting his friend, and\nwillingly promised to return to Barchester with Mr Arabin. He could\nnot bring himself to believe that there was any probability that Mr\nSlope would be made Dean of Barchester. Rumour, he said, had\nreached even his ears not at all favourable to that gentleman's\ncharacter, and he expressed himself strongly of the opinion that\nany such appointment was quite out of the question. At this stage\nof the proceedings, the master's right-hand man, Tom Staple, was\ncalled in to assist at the conference. Tom Staple was the Tutor of\nLazarus, and moreover a great man at Oxford. Though universally\nknown by a species of nomenclature as very undignified. Tom Staple\nwas one who maintained a high dignity in the University. He was, as\nit were, the leader of the Oxford tutors, a body of men who\nconsider themselves collectively as being by very little, if at\nall, second in importance to the heads themselves. It is not always\nthe case that the master, or warden, or provost, or principal can\nhit it off exactly with his tutor. A tutor is by no means\nindisposed to have a will of his own. But at Lazarus they were\ngreat friends and firm allies at the time of which we are writing.\n\nTom Staple was a hale strong man of about forty-five; short in\nstature, swarthy in face, with strong sturdy black hair, and crisp\nblack beard, of which very little was allowed to show itself in the\nshape of whiskers. He always wore a white neckcloth, clean indeed,\nbut not tied with that scrupulous care which now distinguishes some\nof our younger clergy. He was, of course, always clothed in a\nseemly suit of solemn black. Mr Staple was a decent cleanly liver,\nnot over addicted to any sensuality; but nevertheless a somewhat\nwarmish hue was beginning to adorn his nose, the peculiar effect,\nas his friends averred, of a certain pipe of port introduced into\nthe cellars of Lazarus the very same year in which the tutor\nentered in as a freshman. There was also, perhaps with a little\nredolence of port wine, as it were the slightest possible twang, in\nMr Staple's voice.\n\nIn these days Tom Staple was not a very happy man; University\nreform had long been his bugbear, and now was his bane. It was not\nwith him as with most others, an affair of politics, respecting\nwhich, when the need existed, he could, for parties' sake or on\nbehalf of principle, maintain a certain amount of necessary zeal;\nit was not with him a subject for dilettante warfare, and courteous\ncommon-place opposition. To him it was life and death. He would\nwillingly have been a martyr in the cause, had the cause admitted\nof martyrdom.\n\nAt the present day, unfortunately, public affairs will allow of no\nmartyrs, and therefore it is that there is such a deficiency of\nzeal. Could gentlemen of L 10,000 a year have died on their own\ndoor-steps in defence of protection, no doubt some half-dozen\nglorious old baronets would have so fallen, and the school of\nprotection would at this day have been crowded with scholars. Who\ncan fight strenuously in any combat in which there is no danger?\nTom Staple would have willingly been impaled before a Committee of\nthe House, could he by such self-sacrifice have infused his own\nspirit into the component members of the hebdomadal board.\n\nTom Staple was one of those who in his heart approved of the credit\nsystem which had of old been in vogue between the students and\ntradesmen of the University. He knew and acknowledged to himself\nthat it was useless in these degenerate days publicly to contend\nwith the Jupiter on such a subject. The Jupiter had undertaken to\nrule the University, and Tom Staple was well aware that the Jupiter\nwas too powerful for him. But in secret, and among his safe\ncompanions, he would argue that the system of credit was an ordeal\ngood for young men to undergo.\n\nThe bad men, said he, and the weak and worthless, blunder into\ndanger and burn their feet; but the good men, they who have any\ncharacter, they who have that within them which can reflect credit\nin their Alma Mater, they come through scatheless. What merit will\nthere be to a young man to get through safely, if he guarded and\nprotected and restrained like a school-boy? By so doing, the period\nof the ordeal is only postponed, and the manhood of the man will be\ndeferred from the age of twenty to that of twenty-four. If you bind\nhim with leading-strings at college, he will break loose while\neating for the bar in London; bind him there, and he will break\nloose afterwards, when he is a married man. The wild oats must be\nsown somewhere. 'Twas thus that Tom Staple would argue of young\nmen; not, indeed, with much consistency, but still with some\npractical knowledge of the subject gathered from long experience.\n\nAnd now Tom Staple proffered such wisdom as he had for the\nassistance of Dr Gwynne and Mr Arabin.\n\n'Quite out of the question,' said he, arguing that Mr Slope could\nnot possibly be made the new Dean of Barchester.\n\n'So I think,' said the master. 'He has no standing, and, if all I\nhear be true, very little character.'\n\n'As to character,' said Tom Staple, 'I don't think much of that.\nThey rather like loose parsons for deans; a little fast living, or\na dash of infidelity, is no bad recommendation to a cathedral\nclose. But they couldn't make Mr Slope; the last two deans have\nbeen Cambridge men; you'll not show me an instance of their making\nthree men running from the same University. We don't get out share,\nand never shall, I suppose; but we must at least have one out of\nthe three.'\n\n'These sort of rules are all gone out by now,' said Mr Arabin.\n\n'Everything has gone by, I believe,' said Tom Staple. 'The cigar\nhas been smoked out, and we are the ashes.'\n\n'Speak for yourself, Staple,' said the master.\n\n'I speak for all,' said the tutor stoutly. 'It is coming to that,\nthat there will be no life left anywhere in the country. No one is\nany longer fit to rule himself, or those belonging to him. The\nGovernment is to find us all in everything, and the press is to\nfind the Government. Nevertheless, Mr Slope won't be Dean of\nBarchester.'\n\n'And who will be the warden of the hospital?' said Mr Arabin.\n\n'I hear that Mr Quiverful is already appointed,' said Tom Staple.\n\n'I think not,' said the master. 'And I think, moreover, that Dr\nProudie will not be so short-sighted as to run against such a rock;\nMr Slope should himself have sense enough to prevent it.'\n\n'But perhaps Mr Slope may have no objection to see his patron on a\nrock,' said the suspicious tutor.\n\n'What could he get by that?' asked Mr Arabin.\n\n'It is impossible to see the doubles of such a man,' said Mr\nStaple. 'It seems quite clear that Bishop Proudie is altogether in\nhis hands, and it is equally clear that he has been moving heaven\nand earth to get this Mr Quiverful into the hospital, although he\nmust know that such an appointment would be most damaging to the\nbishop. It is impossible to understand such a man, and dreadful to\nthink,' added Mr Staple, sighing deeply, 'that the welfare and\nfortunes of good men may depend on his intrigues.'\n\nDr Gwynne or Mr Staple were not in the least aware, nor even was Mr\nArabin that this Mr Slope, of whom they were talking, had been\nusing his utmost efforts to put their own candidate into the\nhospital; and that in lieu of being a permanent in the palace, his\nown expulsion therefrom had been already decided on by the high\npowers of the diocese.\n\n'I'll tell you what,' said the tutor, 'if this Quiverful is thrust\ninto the hospital and Dr Trefoil must die, I should not wonder if\nthe Government were to make Mr Harding Dean of Barchester. They\nwould feel bound to do something for him after all that was said\nwhen he resigned.'\n\nDr Gwynne at the moment made no reply to this suggestion; but it\ndid not the less impress itself on his mind. If Mr Harding could\nnot be warden of the hospital, why should he not be Dean of\nBarchester?\n\nAnd so the conference ended without any very fixed resolution, and\nDr Gwynne and Mr Arabin prepared for their journey to Plumstead on\nthe morrow.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\nMISS THORNE'S FETE CHAMPETRE\n\nThe day of the Ullathorne party arrived, and all the world was\nthere; or at least so much of the world as had been included in\nMiss Thorne's invitation. As we have said, the bishop returned home\non the previous evening, and on the same evening, and by the same\ntrain, came Dr Gwynne and Mr Arabin from Oxford. The archdeacon\nwith his brougham was in waiting for the Master of Lazarus, so that\nthere was a goodly show of church dignitaries on the platform of\nthe railway.\n\nThe Stanhope party was finally arranged in the odious manner\nalready described, and Eleanor got into the doctor's waiting\ncarriage full of apprehension and presentiment of further\nmisfortunes, whereas Mr Slope entered the vehicle elate with\ntriumph.\n\nHe had received that morning a civil note from Sir Nicholas\nFitzwiggin; not promising much indeed; but then Mr Slope knew, or\nfancied that he knew, that it was not etiquette for government\nofficers to make promises. Though Sir Nicholas promised nothing he\nimplied a good deal; declared his conviction that Mr Slope would\nmake an excellent dean, and wished him every kind of success. To be\nsure he added that, not being in the cabinet, he was never\nconsulted on such matters, and that even if he spoke on the subject\nhis voice would go for nothing. But all this Mr Slope took for the\nprudent reserve of official life. To complete his anticipated\ntriumph, another letter was brought to him just as he was about to\nstart to Ullathorne.\n\nMr Slope also enjoyed the idea of handing Mrs Bold out of Dr\nStanhope's carriage before the multitude at Ullathorne gate, as\nmuch as Eleanor dreaded the same ceremony. He had fully made up his\nmind to throw himself and his fortune at the widow's feet, and had\nalmost determined to select the present propitious morning for\ndoing so. The signora had of late been less than civil to him. She\nhad indeed admitted his visits, and listened, at any rate without\nanger, to his love; but she had tortured him, and reviled him,\njeered at him and ridiculed him, while she allowed him to call her\nthe most beautiful of living women, to kiss her hand, and to\nproclaim himself with reiterated oaths her adorer, her slave, and\nworshipper.\n\nMiss Thorne was in great perturbation, yet in great glory, on the\nmorning of this day. Mr Thorne also, though the party was none of\nhis giving, had much heavy work on his hands. But perhaps the most\novertasked, the most anxious and the most effective of all the\nUllathorne household was Mr Plomacy the steward. This last\npersonage had, in the time of Mr Thorne's father, when the\nDirectory held dominion in France, gone over to Paris with letters\nin his boot heel for some of the royal party; and such had been his\ngood luck that he had returned safe. He had then been very young\nand was now very old, but the exploit gave him a character for\npolitical enterprise and secret discretion which still availed him\nas thoroughly as it had done in its freshest gloss. Mr Plomacy had\nbeen steward of Ullathorne for more than fifty years, and a very\neasy life he had had of it. Who could require much absolute work\nfrom a man who had carried safely at his heel that which if\ndiscovered would have cost him his head? Consequently Mr Plomacy\nhad never worked hard, and of latter years had never worked at all.\nHe had a taste for timber, and therefore he marked the trees that\nwere to be cut down; he had a taste for gardening, and would\ntherefore allow no shrub to be planted or bed to be made without\nhis express sanction.\n\nIn these matters he was sometimes driven to run counter to his\nmistress, but he rarely allowed his mistress to carry the point\nagainst him.\n\nBut on occasions such as the present, Mr Pomney came out strong. He\nhad the honour of the family at heart; he thoroughly appreciated\nthe duties of hospitality; and therefore, when gala doings were\ngoing on, always took the management into his own hands and reigned\nsupreme over master and mistress.\n\nTo give Mr Pomney his due, old as he was, he thoroughly understood\nsuch work as he had in hand, and did it well.\n\nThe order of the day was to be as follows. The quality, as the\nupper classes in rural districts are designated by the lower with\nso much true discrimination, were to eat a breakfast, and the\nnon-quality were to eat a dinner. Two marquees had been erected for\nthese two banquets, that for the quality on the esoteric or garden\nside of a certain deep ha-ha; and that for the non-quality on the\nexoteric or paddock side of the same. Both were of huge dimensions;\nthat on the outer side, one may say, on an egregious scale; but Mr\nPomney declared that neither would be sufficient. To remedy this,\nan auxiliary banquet was prepared in the dining-room, and a\nsubsidiary board was to be spread sub dio for the accommodation of\nthe lower class of yokels on the Ullathorne property.\n\nNo one who has not had a hand in the preparation of such an affair\ncan understand the manifold difficulties which Miss Thorne\nencountered in her project. Had she not been made throughout of the\nvery finest whalebone, rivetted with the best Yorkshire steel, she\nmust have sunk under them. Had not Mr Pomney felt how much was\njustly expected from a man who at one time carried the destinies of\nEurope in his boot, he would have given way; and his mistress, so\ndeserted, must have perished among her poles and canvass.\n\nIn the first place there was a dreadful line to be drawn. Who was\nto dispose themselves within the ha-ha, and who without? To this\nthe unthinking will give an off-hand answer, as they will to every\nponderous question. Oh, the bishop and such like within the ha-ha;\nand Farmer Greenacre and such without. True, my unthinking friend;\nbut who shall define these such-likes? It is in such definitions\nthat the whole difficulty of society consists. To seat the bishop\non an arm chair on the lawn and place Farmer Greenacre at the end\nof a long table in the paddock is easy enough; but where will you\nput Mrs Lookaloft, whose husband, though a tenant on the estate,\nhunts in a red coat, whose daughters go to a fashionable seminary\nin Barchester, who calls her farm house Rosebank, and who has a\npianoforte in her drawing-room? The Misses Lookaloft, as they call\nthemselves, won't sit contented among the bumpkins. Mrs Lookaloft\nwon't squeeze her fine clothes on a bench and talk familiarly about\ncream and ducklings to good Mrs Greenacres. And yet Mrs Lookaloft\nis not fit companion and never has been the associate of the\nThornes and the Grantlys. And if Mrs Lookaloft be admitted within\nthe sanctum of fashionable life, if she be allowed with her three\ndaughters to leap the ha-ha, why not the wives and daughters of\nother families also? Mrs Greenacre is at present well contented\nwith the paddock, but she might cease to be so if she saw Mrs\nLookaloft on the lawn. And thus poor Miss Thorne had a hard time of\nit.\n\nAnd how was she to divide the guests between the marquee and the\nparlour? She had a countess coming, and Honourable John and an\nHonourable George, and a whole bevy of Ladies Amelia, Rosina,\nMargaretta &c; she had a leash of baronets with their baronesses;\nand, as we all know, a bishop. If she put them on the lawn, no one\nwould go into the parlour; if she put them into the parlour, no one\nwould go into the tent. She thought of keeping the old people in\nthe house, and leaving the lawn to the lovers. She might as well\nhave seated herself at once in a hornet's nest. Mr Pomney knew\nbetter than this. 'Bless your soul, Ma'am,' said he, 'there won't\nbe no old ladies; not one, barring yourself and old Mrs\nChantantrum.'\n\nPersonally Miss Thorne accepted this distinction in her favour as a\ncompliment to her good sense; but nevertheless she had no desire to\nbe closeted on the coming occasion with Mrs Chantantrum. She gave\nup all idea of any arbitrary division of her guests, and determined\nif possible to put the bishop on the lawn and the countess in the\nhouse, to sprinkle the baronets, and thus divide the attractions.\nWhat to do with the Lookalofts even Mr Plomacy could not decide.\nThey must take their chance. They had been specially told in the\ninvitation that all the tenants had been invited; and they might\nprobably have the good sense to stay away if they objected to mix\nwith the rest of the tenantry.\n\nThen Mr Plomacy declared his apprehension that the Honourable Johns\nand Honourable Georges would come in a sort of amphibious costume,\nhalf morning half evening, satin neckhandkerchiefs, frock coats,\nprimrose gloves, and polished boots; and that being so dressed,\nthey would decline riding at the quintain, or taking part in any of\nthe athletic games which Miss Thorne had prepared with so much\ncare. If the Lord Johns and Lord Georges didn't ride at the\nquintain, Miss Thorne might be sure that nobody else would.\n\n'But,' said she in dolorous voice, all but overcome by her cares;\n'it was specially signified that there were to be sports.'\n\n'And so there will be, of course,' said Mr Pomney. 'They'll all be\nsporting with the young ladies in the laurel walks. Them's the\nsports they care most about now-a-days. If you gets the young men\nat the quintain, you'll have all the young women in the pouts.'\n\n'Can't they look on, as their great grandmothers did before them?'\nsaid Miss Thorne.\n\n'It seems to me that the ladies ain't contented with looking\nnow-a-days. Whatever the men do they'll do. If you'll have side\nsaddles on the nags, and let them go at the quintain too, it'll\nanswer capital, no doubt.'\n\nMiss Thorne made no reply. She felt that she had no good ground on\nwhich to defend her sex of the present generation, from the sarcasm\nof Mr Pomney. She had once declared, in one of her warmer moments,\n'that now-a-days the gentlemen were all women, and the ladies all\nmen.' She could not alter the debased character of the age. But\nsuch being the case, why should she take on herself to cater for\nthe amusement of people of such degraded tastes? This question she\nasked herself more than once, and she could only answer herself\nwith a sigh. There was her own brother Wilfred, on whose shoulders\nrested the all the ancient honours of Ullathorne House; it was very\ndoubtful whether even he would consent to 'go at the quintain', as\nMr Pomney not injudiciously expressed it.\n\nAnd now the morning arrived. The Ullathorne household was early on\nthe move. Cooks were cooking in the kitchen long before daylight,\nand men were dragging out tables and hammering red baize on to\nbenches at the earliest dawn. With what dread eagerness did Miss\nThorne look out at the weather as soon as the parting veil of night\npermitted her to look at all! In this respect at any rate there was\nnothing to grieve her. The glass had been rising for the last three\ndays, and the morning broke with that dull chill steady grey haze\nwhich in autumn generally presages a clear and dry day. By seven\nshe was dressed and down. Miss Thorne knew nothing of the modern\nluxury of deshabilles. She would as soon have thought of appearing\nbefore her brother without her stockings as without her stays; and\nMiss Thorne's stays were no trifle.\n\nAnd yet there was nothing for her to do when down. She fidgeted out\nto the lawn, and then back into the kitchen. She put on her\nhigh-heeled clogs, and fidgeted out into the paddock. Then she went\ninto the small home park where the quintain was erected. The pole\nand cross-bar and the swivel, and the target and the bag of flour\nwere all complete. She got up on a carpenter's bench and touched\nthe target with her hand; it went round with beautiful ease; the\nswivel had been oiled to perfection. She almost wished to take old\nPlomacy at his word, to go on a side saddle, and have a tilt at it\nherself.\n\nWhat must a young man be, thought she, who could prefer maundering\namong the trees with a wishy-washy school girl to such fun as this?\n'Well,' said she aloud to herself, 'one man can take a horse to\nwater, but a thousand can't make him drink. There it is. If they\nhaven't the spirit to enjoy it, the fault shan't be mine;' and so\nshe returned the house.\n\nAt a little after eight her brother came down, and they had a sort\nof scrap breakfast in his study. The tea was made without the\ncustomary urn, and they dispensed with the usual rolls and toast.\nEggs were also missing, for every egg in the parish had been\nwhipped into custards, baked into pies, or boiled into lobster\nsalad. The allowances of fresh butter was short, and Mr Thorne was\nobliged to eat the leg of a fowl without having it devilled in the\nmanner he loved.\n\n'I have been looking at the quintain, Wilfred,' said she, 'and it\nappears to be quite right.'\n\n'Oh,--ah; yes;' said he. 'It seemed to be so yesterday when I saw\nit.' Mr Thorne was beginning to be rather bored by his sister's\nlove of sports, and had especially no affection for this quintain\npost.\n\n'I wish you'd just try it after breakfast,' said she. 'You could\nhave the saddle put on Mark Antony, and the pole is there all\nhandy. You can take the flour bag off, you know, if you think Mark\nAntony won't be quick enough,' added Miss Thorne, seeing that her\nbrother's countenance was not indicative of complete accordance\nwith her little proposition.\n\nNow Mark Antony was a valuable old hunter, excellently suited to Mr\nThorne's usual requirements, steady indeed at his fences, but\nextremely sure, very good in deep ground, and safe on the roads.\nBut he had never yet been ridden at a quintain, and Mr Thorne was\nnot inclined to put him to the trial, either with or without the\nbag of flour. He hummed and hawed, and finally declared that he was\nafraid Mark Antony would shy.\n\n'Then try the cob,' said the indefatigable Miss Thorne.\n\n'He's in physic,' said Wilfred.\n\n'There's the Beelzebub colt,' said his sister; 'I know he's in the\nstable, because I saw Peter exercising him just now.'\n\n'My dear Monica, he's so wild that it's as much as I can do to\nmanage him at all. He'd destroy himself and me too, if I attempted\nto ride him at such a rattletrap as that.'\n\nA rattletrap! The quintain that she had put up with so much anxious\ncare; the game that she had prepared for the amusement of the\nstalwart yeomen of the country; the sport that had been honoured by\nthe affection of so many of their ancestors! It cut her to the\nheart to hear it so denominated by her own brother. There were but\nthe two of them left together in the world; and it had ever been\none of the rules by which Miss Thorne had regulated her conduct\nthrough life, to say nothing that could provoke her brother. She\nhad often had to suffer from his indifference to time-honoured\nBritish customs; but she had always suffered in silence. It was\npart of her creed that the head of the family should never be\nupbraided in his own house; and Miss Thorne had lived up to her\ncreed. Now, however, she was greatly tried. The colour mounted to\nher ancient cheek, and the fire blazed in her still bright eye; but\nyet she said nothing. She resolved that at any rate, to him nothing\nmore should be said about the quintain that day.\n\nShe sipped her tea in silent sorrow, and thought with painful\nregret of the glorious days when her great ancestor Ealfried had\nsuccessfully held Ullathorne against a Norman invader. There was no\nsuch spirit now left in her family except that small useless spark\nwhich burnt in her own bosom. And she herself, was not she at this\nmoment intent on entertaining a descendant of those very Normand, a\nvain proud countess with a frenchified name, who would only think\nthat she graced Ullathorne too highly by entering its portals? Was\nit likely that an honourable John, the son of the Earl de Courcy,\nshould ride at a quintain in company with a Saxon yeoman? And why\nshould she expect her brother to do that which her brother's guests\nwould decline to do?\n\nSome dim faint idea of the impracticability of her own views\nflitted across her brain. Perhaps it was necessary that races\ndoomed to live on the same soil should give way to each other, and\nadopt each other's pursuits. Perhaps it was impossible that after\nmore than five centuries of close intercourse, Normans should\nremain Normans, and Saxons, Saxons. Perhaps after all her\nneighbours were wiser than herself, such ideas did occasionally\npresent themselves to Miss Thorne's mind, and make her sad enough.\nBut it never occurred to her that her favourite quintain was but a\nmodern copy of a Norman knight's amusement, an adaptation of the\nnoble tourney to the tastes and habits of the Saxon yeomen. Of this\nshe was ignorant, and it would have been cruelty to instruct her.\n\nWhen Mr Thorne saw the tear in her eye, he repented himself of his\ncontemptuous expression. By him also it was recognised as a binding\nlaw that every whim of his sister was to be respected. He was not\nperhaps so firm in his observances to her, as she was in hers to\nhim. But his intentions were equally good, and whenever he found\nthat he had forgotten them, it was a matter of grief to him.\n\n'My dear Monica,' said he, 'I beg your pardon; I don't in the least\nmean to speak ill of the game. When I called it a rattletrap, I\nmerely meant that it was so for a man of my age. You know you\nalways forget that I an't a young man.'\n\n'I am quite sure you are not an old man, Wilfred,' said she,\naccepting the apology in her heart, and smiling at him with the\ntear still on her cheek.\n\n'If I was five-and-twenty, or thirty,' continued he, 'I should like\nnothing better than riding at the quintain all day.'\n\n'But you are not too old to hunt or to shoot,' said she. 'If you\ncan jump over a ditch and hedge, I am sure you could turn the\nquintain round.'\n\n'But when I ride over the hedges, my dear--and it isn't very often\nI do that--but when I do ride over the hedges there isn't any bag\nof flour coming after me. Think how I'd look taking the countess\nout to breakfast with the back of my head all covered with meal.'\n\nMiss Thorne said nothing further. She didn't like the allusion to\nthe countess. She couldn't be satisfied with the reflection that\nthe sports of Ullathorne should be interfered with by the personal\nattentions necessary for a Lady de Courcy. But she saw that it was\nuseless for her to push the matter further. It was conceded that Mr\nThorne was to spared the quintain; and Miss Thorne determined to\ntrust wholly to a youthful knight of hers, an immense favourite,\nwho, as she often declared, was a pattern to the young men of the\nage, and an excellent example of an English yeoman.\n\nThis was Farmer Greenacre's eldest son; who, to tell the truth, had\nfrom his earliest years taken the exact measure of Miss Thorne's\nfoot. In his boyhood he had never failed to obtain from her,\napples, pocket money, and forgiveness for his numerous trespasses;\nand now in his early manhood he got privileges and immunities which\nwere equally valuable. He was allowed a day or two's shooting in\nSeptember; he schooled the squire's horses; got slips of trees out\nof the orchard, and roots of flowers out of the garden; and had the\nfishing of the little river altogether in his own hands. He had\nundertaken to come mounted on a nag of his father's, and show the\nway at the quintain post. Whatever young Greenacre did the others\nwould do after him. The juvenile Lookalofts might stand sure to\nventure if Harry Greenacre showed the way. And so Miss Thorne made\nup her mind to dispense with the noble Johns and Georges, and\ntrust, as her ancestors had done before her, to the thews and\nsinews of native Ullathorne growth.\n\nAt about nine the lower orders began to congregate in the paddock\nand park, under the surveillance of Mr Plomacy and the head\ngardener and head groom, who were sworn in as his deputies, and\nwere to assist him in keeping the peace and promoting the sports.\nMany of the younger inhabitants of the neighbourhood, thinking that\nthey could not have too much of a good thing, had come at a very\nearly hour, and the road between the house and the church had been\nthronged for some time before the gates were thrown open.\n\nAnd then another difficulty of huge dimensions arose, a difficulty\nwhich Mr Plomacy had indeed foreseen, and for which he was in some\nsort provided. Some of those who wished to share Miss Thorne's\nhospitality were not so particular that they should have been as to\nthe preliminary ceremony of an invitation. They doubtless conceived\nthat they had been overlooked by accident; and instead of taking\nthis in dudgeon, as their betters would have done, they\ngood-naturedly put up with the slight, and showed that they did so\nby presenting themselves at the gate in their Sunday best.\n\nMr Plomacy, however, well knew who were welcome and who were not.\nTo some, even though uninvited, he allowed ingress. 'Don't be too\nparticular, Plomacy,' his mistress had said; 'especially with the\nchildren. If they live anywhere near, let them in.'\n\nActing on this hint, Mr Plomacy did let in many an eager urchin,\nand a few tidily dressed girls with their swains, who in no way\nbelonged to the property. But to the denizens of the city he was\ninexorable. Many a Barchester apprentice made his appearance there\nthat day, and urged with piteous supplication that he had been\nworking all the week in making saddles and boots for the use of\nUllathorne, in compounding doses for the horses, or cutting up\ncarcasses for the kitchen. No such claim was allowed. Mr Plomacy\nknew nothing about the city apprentices; he was to admit the\ntenants and labourers on the estate; Miss Thorne wasn't going to\ntake in the whole city of Barchester; and so on.\n\nNevertheless, before the day was half over, all this was found to\nbe useless. Almost anybody who chose to come made his way into the\npark, and the care of the guardians was transferred to the tables\non which the banquet was spread. Even here there was many an\nunauthorized claimant for a plate, of whom it was impossible to get\nquit without some commotion than the place and food were worth.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\nULLATHORNE SPORTS--ACT I\n\nThe trouble in civilised life of entertaining company, as it is\ncalled too generally without much regard to strict veracity, is so\ngreat that it cannot but be matter of wonder that people are so\nfond of attempting it. It is difficult to ascertain what is the\nquid pro quo. If they who give such laborious parties, and who\nendure such toil and turmoil in the vain hope of giving them\nsuccessfully, really enjoyed the parties given by others, the\nmatter would be understood. A sense of justice would induce men and\nwomen to undergo, in behalf of others, those miseries which others\nhad undergone on their behalf. But they all profess that going out\nis as great a bore as receiving; and to look at them when they are\nout, one cannot but believe them.\n\nEntertain! Who shall have sufficient self-assurance, who shall feel\nsufficient confidence in his own powers to dare to boast that he\ncan entertain his company? A clown can sometimes do so, and\nsometimes a dancer in short petticoats and stuffed pink legs;\noccasionally, perhaps, a singer. But beyond these, success in this\nart of entertaining is not often achieved. Young men and girls\nlinking themselves kind with kind, pairing like birds in spring,\nbecause nature wills it, they, after a simple fashion, do entertain\neach other. Few others even try.\n\nLadies, when they open their houses, modestly confessing, it may be\npresumed, their own incapacity, mainly trust to wax candles and\nupholstery. Gentlemen seem to rely on their white waistcoats. To\nthese are added, for the delight of the more sensual, champagne and\nsuch good things of the table as fashion allows to be still\nconsidered as comestible. Even in this respect the world is\ndeteriorating. All the good soups are now tabooed; and at the\nhouses of one's accustomed friends, small barristers, doctors,\ngovernment clerks, and such like, (for we cannot all of us always\nlive as grandees, surrounded by an Elysium of livery servants), one\ngets a cold potato handed to one as a sort of finale to one's slice\nof mutton. Alas! for those happy days when one could say to one's\nneighbourhood, 'Jones, shall I give you some mashed turnip--may I\ntrouble you for a little cabbage?' And then the pleasure of\ndrinking wine with Mrs Jones and Miss Smith; with all the Joneses\nand all the Smiths! These latter-day habits are certainly more\neconomical.\n\nMiss Thorne, however, boldly attempted to leave the modern beaten\ntrack, and made a positive effort to entertain her guests. Alas!\nshe did so with but moderate success. They had all their own way of\ngoing, and would not go her way. She piped to them, but they would\nnot dance. She offered to them good honest household cake, made of\ncurrants and flour and eggs and sweetmeat; but they would feed\nthemselves on trashy wafers from the shop of the Barchester\npastry-cook, on chalk and gum and adulterated sugar. Poor Miss\nThorne! yours is not the first honest soul that has vainly striven\nto recall the glories of happy days gone by! If fashion suggests to\na Lady De Courcy that when invited to a dejeuner at twelve o'clock\nshe ought to come at three, no eloquence of thine will teach her\nthe advantage of a nearer approach to punctuality.\n\nShe had fondly thought that when she called on her friends to come\nat twelve, and especially begged them to believe that she meant it,\nshe would be able to see them comfortably seated in their tents at\ntwo. Vain woman--or rather ignorant woman--ignorant of the advances\nof that civilization which the world had witnessed while she was\ngrowing old. At twelve she found herself alone, dressed in all the\nglory of the newest of her many suits of raiment; with strong shoes\nhowever, and a serviceable bonnet on her head, and a warm rich\nshawl on her shoulders. Thus clad she peered out into the tent,\nwent to the ha-ha, and satisfied herself that at any rate the\nyoungsters were amusing themselves, spoke a word to Mrs Greenacre\nover the ditch, and took one look at the quintain. Three or four\nyoung farmers were turning the machine round and round, and poking\nat the bag of flour in a manner not at all intended by the inventor\nof the game; but no mounted sportsmen were there. Miss Thorne\nlooked at her watch. It was only fifteen minutes past twelve, and\nit was understood that Harry Greenacre was not to begin till the\nhalf hour.\n\nMiss Thorne returned to her drawing-room rather quicker than her\nwont, fearing that the countess might come and find none to welcome\nher. She need not have hurried, for no one was there. At half-past\ntwelve she peeped into the kitchen; at a quarter to one she was\njoined by her brother; and just then the first fashionable arrival\ntook place. Mrs Clantantram was announced.\n\nNo announcement was necessary, indeed; for the good lady's voice\nwas heard as she walked across the court-yard to the house scolding\nthe unfortunate postilion who had driven her from Barchester. At\nthe moment Miss Thorne could not but be thankful that the other\nguests were more fashionable, and were thus spared the fury of Mrs\nClantantram's indignation.\n\n'Oh, Miss Thorne, look here!' said she, as soon as she found\nherself in the drawing-room; 'do look at my roquelaure! It's clean\nspoilt, and for ever. I wouldn't but wear it because I know you\nwished us all to be grand to-day; and yet I had my misgivings. Oh\ndear, oh dear! It was five-and-twenty shillings a yard.'\n\nThe Barchester post horses had misbehaved in some unfortunate\nmanner just as Mrs Clantantram was getting out of the chaise and\nhad nearly thrown her under the wheel.\n\nMrs Clantantram belonged to other days, and therefore, though she\nhad but little else to recommend her, Miss Thorne was to a certain\nextent fond of her. She sent the roquelaure away to be cleaned, and\nlent her one of her best shawls out of her own wardrobe.\n\nThe next comer was Mr Arabin, who was immediately informed of Mrs\nClantantram's misfortune, and of her determination to pay neither\nmaster nor post-boy; although, as she remarked, she intended to get\nher lift home before she made known her mind upon that matter. Then\na good deal of rustling was heard in the sort of lobby that was\nused for the ladies' outside cloaks; and the door having been\nthrown wide open, the servant announced, not in the most confident\nof voices, Mrs Lookaloft, and the Miss Lookalofts, and Mr Augustus\nLookaloft.\n\nPoor man!--we mean the footman. He knew, none better, that Mrs\nLookaloft had no business there, that she was not wanted there, and\nwould not be welcome. But he had not the courage to tell a stout\nlady with a low dress, short sleeves, and satin at eight shillings\na yard, that she had come to the wrong tent; he had not dared to\nhint to young ladies with white dancing shoes and long gloves, that\nthere was a place ready for them in the paddock. And thus Mrs\nLookaloft carried her point, broke through the guards, and made her\nway into the citadel. That she would have to pass an uncomfortable\ntime there, she had surmised before. But nothing now could rob her\nof the power of boasting that she had consorted on the lawn with\nthe squire and Miss Thorne, with a countess, a bishop, and the\ncountry grandees, while Mrs Greenacres and such like were walking\nabout with the ploughboys in the park. It was a great point gained\nby Mrs Lookaloft, and it might be fairly expected that from this\ntime forward the tradesmen of Barchester would, with undoubting\npens, address her husband and T. Lookaloft, Esquire.\n\nMrs Lookaloft's pluck carried her through everything, and she\nwalked triumphant into the Ullathorne drawing-room; but her\nchildren did feel a little abashed at the sort of reception they\nmet with. It was not in Miss Thorne's heart to insult her own\nguests; but neither was it in her disposition to overlook such\neffrontery.\n\n'Oh, Mrs Lookaloft, is this you,' said she; 'and your daughters and\nson? Well, we're very glad to see you; but I'm sorry you've come in\nsuch low dresses, as we are all going out of doors. Could we lend\nyou anything?'\n\n'Oh dear no! thank ye, Miss Thorne,' said the mother; 'the girls\nand myself are quite used to low dresses, when we're out.'\n\n'Are you, indeed?' said Miss Thorne shuddering; but the shudder was\nnot lost on Mrs Lookaloft.\n\n'And where's Lookaloft,' said the master of the house, coming up to\nwelcome his tenant's wife. Let the faults of the family be what\nthey would, he could not but remember that their rent was well\npaid; he was therefore not willing to give them a cold shoulder.\n\n'Such a headache, Mr Thorne!' said Mrs Lookaloft. 'In fact he\ncouldn't stir, or you may be certain on such a day he would not\nhave absented himself.'\n\n'Dear me,' said Miss Thorne. 'If he is so ill, I sure you'd wish to\nbe with him.'\n\n'Not at all!' said Mrs Lookaloft. 'Not at all, Miss Thorne.\n It is only bilious you know, and when he's that way he can bear\nnobody nigh him.'\n\nThe fact however was that Mr Lookaloft, having either more sense or\nless courage than his wife, had not chosen to intrude on Miss\nThorne's drawing-room; and as he could not very well have gone\namong the plebeians while his wife was with the patricians, he\nthought it most expedient to remain at Rosebank.\n\nMrs Lookaloft soon found herself on a sofa, and the Miss Lookalofts\non two chairs, while Mr Augustus stood near the door; and here they\nremained till in due time they were seated all four together at the\nbottom of the dining-room table.\n\nThen the Grantlys came; the archdeacon and Mrs Grantly and the two\ngirls, and Dr Gwynne and Mr Harding; and as ill luck would have it,\nthey were closely followed by Dr Stanhope's carriage. As Eleanor\nlooked out of the carriage window, she saw her brother-in-law\nhelping the ladies out, and threw herself back into her seat,\ndreading to be discovered. She had had an odious journey. Mr\nSlope's civility had been more than ordinarily greasy; and now,\nthough he had not in fact said anything which she could notice, she\nhad for the first time entertained a suspicion that he was\nintending to make love to her. Was it after all true that she had\nbeen conducting herself in a way that justified the world in\nthinking that she liked the man? After all, could it be possible\nthat the archdeacon and Mr Arabin were right, and that she was\nwrong? Charlotte Stanhope had also been watching Mr Slope, and had\ncome to the conclusion that it behoved her brother to lose no\nfurther time, if he meant to gain the widow. She almost regretted\nthat it had not been contrived that Bertie should be at Ullathorne\nbefore them.\n\nDr Grantly did not see his sister-in-law in company with Mr Slope,\nbut Mr Arabin did. Mr Arabin came out with Mr Thorne to the front\ndoor to welcome Mrs Grantly, and he remained in the courtyard till\nall their party had passed on. Eleanor hung back in the carriage as\nlong as she well could, but she was nearest to the door, and when\nMr Slope, having alighted, offered her his hand, she had no\nalternative but to take it.\n\nMr Arabin standing at the open door, while Mrs Grantly was shaking\nhands with someone within, saw a clergyman alight from the carriage\nwhom he at once knew to be Mr Slope, and then she saw this\nclergyman hand out Mrs Bold. Having seen so much, Mr Arabin, rather\nsick at heart, followed Mrs Grantly into the house.\n\nEleanor was, however, spared any further immediate degradation, for\nDr Stanhope gave her his arm across the courtyard, and Mr Slope was\nfain to throw away his attention upon Charlotte.\n\nThey had hardly passed into the house, and from the house to the\nlawn, when, with a loud rattle and such noise as great men and\ngreat woman are entitled to make in their passage through the\nworld, the Proudies drove up. It was soon apparent that no every\nday comer was at the door. One servant whispered to another that it\nwas the bishop, and the word soon ran through all the hangers-on\nand strange grooms and coachmen about the place. There was quite a\nlittle cortege to see the bishop and his 'lady' walk across the\ncourtyard, and the good man was pleased to see that the church was\nheld in such respect in the parish of St Ewold's.\n\nAnd now the guests came fast and thick, and the lawn began to be\ncrowded, and the room to be full. Voices buzzed, silk rustled\nagainst silk, and muslin crumpled against muslin. Miss Thorne\nbecame more happy than she had been, and again bethought her of her\nsports. There were targets and bows and arrows prepared at the\nfurther end of the lawn. Here the gardens of the place encroached\nwith a somewhat wide sweep upon the paddock, and gave ample room\nfor the doings of the toxophilites. Miss Thorne got together such\ndaughters of Diana as could bend a bow, and marshalled them to the\ntargets. There were the Grantly girls and the Proudie girls and the\nChadwick girls, and the two daughters of the burly chancellor, and\nMiss Knowle; and with them went Frederick and Augustus Chadwick,\nand young Knowle of Knowle park, and Frank Foster of the Elms, and\nMr Vellem Deeds the dashing attorney of the High Street, and the\nRev Mr Green, and the Rev Mr Browne, and the Rev Mr White, all of\nwhom as in duty bound, attended the steps of the three Miss\nProudies.\n\n'Did you ever ride at the quintain, Mr Foster?' said Miss Thorne,\nas she walked with her party, across the lawn.\n\n'The quintain?' said young Foster, who considered himself a dab at\nhorsemanship. 'Is it a sort of gate, Miss Thorne?'\n\nMiss Thorne had to explain the noble game she spoke of, and Frank\nFoster had to own that he never had ridden at the quintain.\n\n'Would you like to come and see?' said Miss Thorne. 'There'll be\nplenty here without you, if you like it.'\n\n'Well, I don't mind,' said Frank; 'I suppose the ladies can come\ntoo.'\n\n'Oh, yes,' said Miss Thorne; 'those who like it; I have no doubt\nthey'll go to see your prowess, if you'll ride, Mr Foster.'\n\nMr Foster looked down at a most unexceptionable pair of pantaloons,\nwhich had arrived from London only the day before. They were the\nvery things, at least he thought so, for a picnic of fete\nchampetre; but he was not prepared to ride in them. Nor was he more\nencouraged than had been Mr Thorne, by the idea of being attacked\nfrom behind by the bag of flour which Miss Thorne had graphically\ndescribed to him.\n\n'Well, I don't know about riding, Miss Thorne,' said he; 'I fear\nI'm not quite prepared.'\n\nMiss Thorne sighed, but said nothing further. She left the\ntoxophilites to their bows and arrows, and returned towards the\nhouse. But as she passed by the entrance to the small park, she\nthought that she might at any rate encourage the yeomen by her\npresence, as she could not induced her more fashionable guests to\nmix with them in their many amusements.\n\nAccordingly she once more betook herself to the quintain post.\nHere to her great delight she found Harry Greenacre ready mounted,\nwith his pole in his hand, and a lot of comrades standing round\nhim, encouraging him to the assault. She stood at a little distance\nand nodded to him in token of her good pleasure.\n\n'Shall I begin, ma'am?' said Henry fingering his long staff in a\nrather awkward way, while his horse moved uneasily beneath him, not\naccustomed to a rider armed with such a weapon.\n\n'Yes, yes,' said Miss Thorne, standing triumphant as the queen of\nbeauty, on an inverted tub which some chance had brought hither\nfrom the farm-yard.\n\n'Here goes then,' said Harry as he wheeled his horse round to get\nthe necessary momentum of a sharp gallop. The quintain post stood\nright before him, and the square board at which he was to tilt was\nfairly in the way. If he hit that duly in the middle, and\nmaintained his pace as he did so, it was calculated that he would\nbe carried out of reach of the flour bag, which, suspended at the\nother end of the cross-bar on the post, would swing round when the\nboard was struck. It was also calculated that if the rider did not\nmaintain his pace, he would get a blow from the flour bag just at\nthe back of his head, and bear about him the signs of his\nawkwardness to the great amusement of the lookers-on.\n\nHarry Greenacre did not object to being powdered with flour in the\nservice of his mistress, and therefore gallantly touched his steed\nwith his spur, having laid his lance in rest to the best of his\nability. But his ability in this respect was not great, and his\nappurtenances probably not very good; consequently, he struck his\nhorse with his pole unintentionally on the side of the head as he\nstarted. The animal swerved and shied, and galloped off wide of the\nquintain. Harry well accustomed to manage a horse, but not to do so\nwith a twelve-foot rod on his arm, lowered his right hand to the\nbridle and thus the end of the lance came to the ground, and got\nbetween the legs of the steed. Down came the rider and steed and\nstaff. Young Greenacre was thrown some six feet over the horse's\nhead, and poor Miss Thorne almost fell of her tub in a swoon.\n\n'Oh gracious, he's killed,' shrieked a woman, who was near him when\nhe fell.\n\n'The Lord be good to him! his poor mother, his poor mother!' said\nanother.\n\n'Well, drat them dangerous plays all the world over,' said an old\ncrone.\n\n'He has broke his neck sure enough, if ever man did,' said a\nfourth.\n\nPoor Miss Thorne. She heard all this and yet did not quite swoon.\nShe made her way through the crowd as best she could, sick herself\nalmost to death. Oh, his mother--his poor mother! how could she\never forgive herself. The agony of that moment was terrific. She\ncould hardly get to the place where the poor lad was lying, as\nthree or four men in front were about the horse which had risen\nwith some difficulty; but at last she found herself close to the\nyoung farmer.\n\n'Has he marked himself? for heaven's sake tell me that; has he\nmarked his knees?' said Harry, slowly rising and rubbing his left\nshoulder with his right hand, and thinking only of his horse's\nlegs. Miss Thorne soon found that he had not broken his neck, nor\nany of his bones, nor been injured in any essential way. But from\nthat time forth she never instigated any one to ride at the\nquintain.\n\nEleanor left Dr Stanhope as soon as she could do so civilly, and\nwent in quest of her father whom she found on the lawn in company\nwith Mr Arabin. She was not sorry to find them together. She was\nanxious to disabuse at any rate her father's mind as to this report\nwhich had got abroad respecting her, and would have been well\npleased to have been able to do the same with regard to Mr Arabin.\nShe put her own through her father's arm, coming up behind his\nback, and then tendered her hand also to the vicar of St Ewold's.\n\n'And how did you come?' said Mr Harding, when the first greeting\nwas over.\n\n'The Stanhopes brought me,' said she; 'their carriage was obliged\nto come twice, and has now gone back for the signora.' As she spoke\nshe caught Mr Arabin's eye, and saw that he was looking pointedly\nat her with a severe expression. She understood at once the\naccusation contained in his glance. It said as plainly as an eye\ncould speak, 'Yes, you came with the Stanhopes, but you did so in\norder that you might be in company with Mr Slope.'\n\n'Our party,' said she, still addressing her father, 'consisted of\nthe Doctor and Charlotte Stanhope, myself, and Mr Slope.' As she\nmentioned the last name she felt her father's arm quiver slightly\nbeneath her touch. At the same moment Mr Arabin turned away from\nthem, and joining his hands behind his back strolled slowly away by\none of the paths.\n\n'Papa,' said she, 'it was impossible to help coming in the same\ncarriage with Mr Slope; it was quite impossible. I had promised to\ncome with them before I dreamt of his coming, and afterwards I\ncould not get out of it without explaining and giving rise to talk.\nYou weren't at home, you know, I couldn't possibly help it.' She\nsaid all this so quickly that by the time her apology was spoken\nshe was quite out of breath.\n\n'I don't know why you should have wished to help it, my dear,' said\nher father.\n\n'Yes, papa, you do; you must know, you do know all the things they\nsaid at Plumstead. I am sure you do. You know all the archdeacon\nsaid. How unjust he was, and Mr Arabin too. He's a horrid man, a\nhorrid, odious man, but--'\n\n'Who is an odious man, my dear? Mr Arabin?'\n\n'No; but Mr Slope. You know I mean Mr Slope. He's the most odious\nman I ever met in my life, and it was most unfortunate my having to\ncome here in the same carriage with him. But how could I help it?'\n\nA great weight began to move itself off Mr Harding's mind. So,\nafter all, the archdeacon with all his wisdom, and Mrs Grantly with\nall her tact, and Mr Arabin with all his talent were in the wrong.\nHis own child, his Eleanor, the daughter of whom he was so proud\nwas not to become the wife of Mr Slope. He had been about to give\nhis sanction to the marriage, so certified had he been of this\nfact; and now he learnt that this imputed lover of Eleanor's was at\nany rage as much disliked by her as by any one of the family. Mr\nHarding, however, was by no means sufficiently a man of the world\nto conceal the blunder he had made. He could not pretend that he\nhad entertained no suspicion; he could not make believe that he had\nnever joined the archdeacon in his surmises. He was greatly\nsurprised, and gratified beyond measure, and he could not help\nshowing that such was the case.\n\n'My darling girl,' said he, 'I am so delighted, so overjoyed. My\nown child; you have taken such a weight off my mind.'\n\n'But surely, papa, you didn't think--'\n\n'I didn't know what to think, my dear. The archdeacon told me that\n-'\n\n'The archdeacon!' said Eleanor, her face lighting up with passion.\n'A man like the archdeacon might, one would think, be better\nemployed than in traducing his sister-in-law, and creating\nbitterness between a father and his daughter.'\n\n'He didn't mean to that, Eleanor.'\n\n'What did he mean then? Why did he interfere with me, and fill your\nmind with such falsehood?'\n\n'Never mind it now, my child; never mind it now. We shall all know\nyou better now.'\n\n'Oh, papa, that you should have thought it! that you should have\nsuspected me!'\n\n'I don't know what you mean by suspicion, Eleanor. There would be\nnothing disgraceful, you know; nothing wrong in such a marriage.\nNothing that could have justified my interfering as your father.'\nAnd Mr Harding would have proceeded in his own defence to make out\nthat Mr Slope after all was a very good sort of man, and a very\nfitting second husband for a young widow, had he not been\ninterrupted by Eleanor's greater energy.\n\n'It would be disgraceful,' said she; 'it would be wrong; it would\nbe abominable. Could I do such a horrid thing, I should expect no\none to speak to me. Ugh--' and she shuddered as she thought of the\nmatrimonial torch which her friends had been so ready to light on\nher behalf. I don't wonder at Dr Grantly; I don't wonder at Susan;\nbut, oh, papa, I do wonder at you. How could you, how could you\nbelieve it?' Poor Eleanor, as she thought of her father's\ndefalcation, could resist her tears no longer, and was forced to\ncover her face with her handkerchief.\n\nThe place was not very opportune for her grief. They were walking\nthrough the shrubberies, and there were many people near them. Poor\nMr Harding stammered out his excuse as best he could, and Eleanor\nwith an effort controlled her tears, and returned her handkerchief\nto her pocket. She did not find it difficult to forgive her father,\nnor could she altogether refuse to join him in the returning gaiety\nof spirit to which her present avowal gave rise. It was such a load\noff his heart to think that he should not be called on to welcome\nMr Slope as his son-in-law; it was such a relief to him to find\nthat his daughter's feelings and his own were now, as they ever had\nbeen, in unison. He had been so unhappy for the last six weeks\nabout this wretched Mr Slope!\n\nHe was so indifferent as to the loss of the hospital, so thankful\nfor the recovery of his daughter, that, strong as was the ground\nfor Eleanor's anger, she could not find it in her heart to be long\nangry with him.\n\n'Dear papa,' she said, hanging closely to his arm, 'never suspect\nme again: promise me that you never will. Whatever I do, you may be\nsure I shall tell you first; you may be sure I shall consult you.'\n\nAnd Mr Harding did promise, and owned his sin, and promised again.\nAnd so, while he promised amendment and she uttered forgiveness,\nthey returned together to the drawing-room windows.\n\nAnd what had Eleanor meant when she declared that whatever she did,\nshe would tell her father first? What was she thinking of doing?\n\nSo ended the first act of the melodrama which Eleanor was called on\nto perform this day at Ullathorne.\n\n\n\n CHAPTER XXXVII\n\nTHE SIGNORA NERONI, THE COUNTESS DE COURCY, AND MRS PROUDIE MEET\nEACH OTHER AT ULLATHORNE\n\nAnd now there were new arrivals. Just as Eleanor reached the\ndrawing-room the signora was being wheeled into it. She had been\nbrought out of the carriage into the dining-room and there placed\non a sofa, and was now in the act of entering the other room, by\nthe joint aid of her brother and sister, Mr Arabin, and two\nservants in livery. She was all in her glory, and looked so\npathetically happy, so full of affliction and grace, was so\nbeautiful, so pitiable, and so charming, that it was almost\nimpossible not to be glad she was there.\n\nMiss Thorne was unaffectedly glad to welcome her. In fact, the\nsignora was a sort of lion; and though there was no drop of the\nLeohunter blood in Miss Thorne's veins, she nevertheless did like\nto see attractive people at her house.\n\nThe signora was attractive, and on her first settlement in the\ndining-room she had whispered two or three soft feminine words into\nMiss Thorne's ear, which, at the moment, had quite touched that\nlady's heart.\n\n'Oh, Miss Thorne; where is Miss Thorne?' she said, as soon as her\nattendants had placed her in her position just before one of the\nwindows, from whence she could see all that was going on upon the\nlawn; 'How am I to thank you for permitting a creature like me to\nbe here? But if you knew the pleasure you give me, I am sure you\nwould excuse the trouble I bring with me.' And as she spoke she\nsqueezed the spinster's little hand between her own.\n\n'We are delighted to see you here,' said Miss Thorne; 'you give us\nno trouble at all, and we think it a great favour conferred by you\nto come and see us; don't we, Wilfred?'\n\n'A very great favour indeed,' said Mr Thorne, with a gallant bow,\nbut of somewhat less cordial welcome than that conceded by his\nsister. Mr Thorne had learned perhaps more of the antecedents of\nhis guest than his sister had done, and not as yet undergone the\npower of the signora's charms.\n\nBut while the mother of the last of the Neros was thus in he full\nsplendour, with crowds of people gazing at her and the elite of the\ncompany standing round her couch, her glory was paled by the\narrival of the Countess De Courcy. Miss Thorne had now been waiting\nthree hours for the countess, and could not therefore but show very\nevident gratification when the arrival at last took place. She and\nher brother of course went off to welcome the titled grandee, and\nwith them, alas, went many of the signora's admirers.\n\n'Oh, Mr Thorne,' said the countess, while the act of being disrobed\nof her fur cloaks, and re-robed in her gauze shawls, 'what dreadful\nroads you have; perfectly frightful.'\n\nIt happened that Mr Thorne was way-warden for the district, and not\nliking the attack, began to excuse his roads.\n\n'Oh yes, indeed they are,' said the countess, not minding him in\nthe least, 'perfectly dreadful; are they not, Margaretta? Why, dear\nMiss Thorne, we left Courcy Castle just at eleven; it was only just\npast eleven, was it not, John? and--'\n\n'Just past one, I think you mean,' said the Honourable John,\nturning from the group and eyeing the signora through his glass.\nThe signora gave him back his own, as the saying is, and more with\nit; so that the young nobleman was forced to avert his glance, and\ndrop his glass.\n\n'I say, Thorne,' whispered he, 'who the deuce is that on the sofa?'\n\n'Dr Stanhope's daughter,' whispered back Mr Thorne. 'Signora Neroni\nshe calls herself.'\n\n'Whew-ew-ew!' whistled the Honourable John. 'The devil she is! I\nhave heard no end of stories about that filly. You must positively\nintroduce me, Thorne; you positively must.'\n\nMr Thorne who was respectability itself, did not quite like having\na guest about whom the Honourable John De Courcy had heard no end\nof stories; but he couldn't help himself. He merely resolved that\nbefore he went to bed he would let his sister know somewhat of the\nhistory of the lady she was so willing to welcome. The innocence of\nMiss Thorne, at her time of life, was perfectly charming; but even\ninnocence may be dangerous.\n\n'John may say what he likes,' continued the countess, urging her\nexcuses on Miss Thorne; 'I am sure we were past the castle gate\nbefore twelve, weren't we, Margaretta?'\n\n'Upon my word, I don't know,' said the Lady Margaretta, 'for I was\nhalf asleep. But I do know that I was called sometime in the middle\nof the night, and was dressing myself before daylight.'\n\nWise people, when they are in the wrong, always put themselves\nright by finding fault with the people against whom they have\nsinned. Lady De Courcy was a wise woman; and therefore, having\ntreated Miss Thorne very badly by staying away till three o'clock,\nshe assumed the offensive and attacked Mr Thorne's roads. Her\ndaughter, not less wise, attacked Miss Thorne's early hours. The\nart of doing this is among the most precious of those usually\ncultivated by persons who know how to live. There is no\nwithstanding it. Who can go systematically to work, and having done\nbattle with the primary accusation and settled that, then bring\nforward a counter-charge and support that also? Life is not long\nenough for such labours. A man in the right relies easily on his\nrectitude, and therefore goes about unarmed. His very strength is\nhis weakness; his very weakness is his strength. The one is never\nprepared for combat, the other is always ready. Therefore it is\nthat in this world the man that is in the wrong almost invariably\nconquers the man that is in the right, and invariably despises him.\n\nA man must be an idiot or else an angel, who, after the age of\nforty shall attempt to be just to his neighbours. Many like the\nLady Margaretta have learnt their lesson at a much earlier age. But\nthis of course depends on the school in which they have been\ntaught.\n\nPoor Miss Thorne was altogether overcome. She knew very well that\nshe had been ill-treated, and yet she found herself making\napologies to Lady De Courcy. To do her ladyship justice, she\nreceived them very graciously, and allowed herself with her train\nof daughters to be led towards the lawn.\n\nThere were two windows in the drawing-room wide open for the\ncountess to pass through; but she saw that there was a woman on the\nsofa, at the third window, and that that woman had, as it were, a\nfollowing attached to her. Her ladyship therefore determined to\ninvestigate the woman. The De Courcys were hereditarily short\nsighted, and had been so for thirty centuries at least. So Lady De\nCourcy, who, when she entered the family had adopted the family\nhabits, did as her son had done before her, and taking her glass to\ninvestigate the Signora Neroni, pressed in among the gentlemen who\nsurrounded the couch, and bowed slightly to those whom she chose to\nhonour by her acquaintance.\n\nIn order to get to the window she had to pass close to the front of\nthe couch, and as she did so she stared hard at the occupant. The\noccupant in return stared hard at the countess. The countess who\nsince her countess-ship commenced had been accustomed to see all\neyes, not royal, ducal, or marquesal, fall down before her own,\npaused as she went on, raised her eyebrows, and stared even harder\nthan before. But she had now to do with one who cared little for\ncountesses. It was, one may say, impossible for mortal man or woman\nto abash Madeline Neroni. She opened her large bright lustrous eyes\nwider and wider, till she seemed to be all eyes.\n\nShe gazed up into the lady's face, not as though she did it with an\neffort, but as if she delighted in doing it. She used no glass to\nassist her effrontery, and needed none. The faintest possible smile\nof derision played round her mouth, and her nostrils were slightly\ndilated, as if in sure anticipation of her triumph. And it was\nsure. The Countess De Courcy, in spite of her thirty centuries and\nDe Courcy castle, and the fact that Lord De Courcy was grand master\nof the ponies to the Prince of Wales, had not a chance with her.\n\nAt first the little circlet of gold wavered in the countess's hand,\nthen the hand shook, then the circlet fell, the countess's head\ntossed itself into the air, and the countess's feet shambled out to\nthe lawn. She did not however go so fast but what she heard the\nsignora's voice, asking--\n\n'Who on earth is that woman, Mr Slope?'\n\n'That is Lady De Courcy.'\n\n'Oh, ah. I might have supposed so. Ha, ha, ha. Well, that's as good\nas a play.'\n\nIt was as good as a play to any there who had eyes to observe it,\nand wit to comment on what they observed.\n\nBut the Lady De Courcy soon found a congenial spirit on the lawn.\nThere she encountered Mrs Proudie, and as Mrs Proudie was not only\nthe wife of a bishop, but was also the cousin of an earl, Lady De\nCourcy considered her to be the fittest companion she was likely to\nmeet in that assemblage. They were accordingly delighted to see\neach other. Mrs Proudie by no means despised a countess, and as\nthis countess lived in the county and within a sort of extensive\nvisiting distance of Barchester, she was glad to have this\nopportunity of ingratiating herself.\n\n'My dear Lady De Courcy, I am so delighted,' said she, looking as\nlittle grim as it was in her nature to do so. 'I hardly expected to\nsee you here. It is such a distance, and then you know, such a\ncrowd.'\n\n'And such roads, Mrs Proudie! I really wonder how the people ever\nget about. But I don't suppose they ever do.'\n\n'Well, I really don't know; but I suppose not. The Thorne don't, I\nknow,' said Mrs Proudie. 'Very nice person, Miss Thorne, isn't\nshe?'\n\n'Oh, delightful and so queer; I've known her these twenty years. A\ngreat pet of mine is dear Miss Thorne. She is so very strange, you\nknow. She always makes me think of the Esquimaux and the Indians.\nIsn't her dress quite delightful?'\n\n'Delightful,' said Mrs Proudie; 'I wonder now whether she paints.\nDid you ever see such colour?'\n\n'Oh, of course,' said Lady De Courcy; 'that is, I have no doubt she\ndoes. But, Mrs Proudie, who is that woman on the sofa by the\nwindow? just step this way and you'll see her, there--' and the\ncountess led her to a spot where she could plainly see the\nsignora's well-remembered face and figure.\n\nShe did not however do so without being equally well seen by the\nsignora. 'Look, look,' said that lady to Mr Slope, who was still\nstanding near to her; 'see the high spiritualities and\ntemporalities of the land in league together, and all against poor\nme. I'll wager my bracelet, Mr Slope against your next sermon, that\nthey've taken up their position there on purpose to pull me to\npieces. Well, I can't rush to the combat, but I know how to protect\nmyself if the enemy come near me.'\n\nBut the enemy knew better. They could gain nothing be contact with\nthe signora Neroni, and they could abuse her as they pleased at a\ndistance from her on the lawn.\n\n'She's that horrid Italian woman, Lady De Courcy; you must have\nheard of her.'\n\n'What Italian woman?' said her ladyship, quite alive to the coming\nstory; 'I don't think I've heard of any Italian woman coming into\nthe country. She doesn't look Italian either.'\n\n'Oh, you must have heard of her,' said Mrs Proudie. 'No, she's not\nabsolutely Italian. She is Dr Stanhope's daughter--Dr Stanhope the\nprebendary; and she calls herself the Signora Neroni.'\n\n'Oh--h--h--h!' exclaimed the countess.\n\n'I was sure you had heard of her,' continued Mrs Proudie. 'I don't\nknow anything about her husband. They do say that some man named\nNeroni is still alive. I believe she did marry such a man abroad,\nbut I do not at all know who or what he was.'\n\n'Ah--h--h--h!' said the countess, shaking her head with much\nintelligence, as every additional 'h' fell from her lips. 'I know\nall about it now. I have heard George mention her. George knows all\nabout her. George heard about her in Rome.'\n\n'She's an abominable woman at any rate,' said Mrs Proudie.\n\n'Insufferable,' said the countess.\n\n'She made her way into the palace once, before I knew anything\nabout her; and I cannot tell you how dreadfully indecent her\nconduct was.'\n\n'Was it?' said the delighted countess.\n\n'Insufferable,' said the prelatess.\n\n'But why does she lie on a sofa?' asked the Lady De Courcy.\n\n'She has only one leg,' said Mrs Proudie.\n\n'Only one leg!' said the Lady De Courcy, who felt to a certain\ndegree dissatisfied that the signora was thus incapacitated. 'Was\nshe born so?'\n\n'Oh, no,' said Mrs Proudie,--and her ladyship felt somewhat\nrecomforted by the assurance,--'she had two. But that Signor Neroni\nbeat her, I believe, till she was obliged to have one amputated. At\nany rate she entirely lost the use of it.'\n\n'Unfortunate creature!' said the countess, who herself knew\nsomething of matrimonial trials.\n\n'Yes,' said Mrs Proudie; 'one would pity her, in spite of her past\nbad conduct, if she knew how to behave herself. But she does not.\nShe is the most insolent creature I have ever put my eyes on.'\n\n'Indeed she is,' said Lady De Courcy.\n\n'And her conduct with men is abominable, that she is not fit to be\nadmitted into any lady's drawing-room.'\n\n'Dear me!' said the countess, becoming again excited, happy, and\nmerciless.\n\n'You saw that man standing near her,--the clergyman with the red\nhair?'\n\n'Yes, yes.'\n\n'She has absolutely ruined that man. The bishop, or I should rather\ntake the blame on myself, for it was I,--I brought him down from\nLondon to Barchester. He is a tolerable preacher, an active young\nman, and I therefore introduced him to the bishop. That woman, Lady\nDe Courcy, has got hold of him, and has so disgraced him, that I am\nforced to required that he shall leave the palace; and I doubt very\nmuch whether he won't lose his gown.'\n\n'Why what an idiot the man must be!' said the countess.\n\n'You don't know the intriguing villainy of that woman,' said Mrs\nProudie, remembering her own torn flounces.\n\n'But you say she has only got one leg!'\n\n'She is as full of mischief as tho' she had ten. Look at her eyes,\nLady De Courcy. Did you ever see such eyes in a decent woman's\nhead?'\n\n'Indeed I never did, Mrs Proudie.'\n\n'And her effrontery, and her voice; I quite pity her poor father,\nwho is really a good sort of man.'\n\n'Dr Stanhope, isn't he?'\n\n'Yes, Dr Stanhope. He is one of our prebendaries,--a good quiet\nsort of man himself. But I am surprised that he should let his\ndaughter conduct herself as he does.'\n\n'I suppose he can't help it,' said the countess.\n\n'But a clergyman, you know, Lady De Courcy! He should at any rate\nprevent her from exhibiting in public, if he cannot induce her to\nbehave at home. But he is to be pitied. I believe he has a\ndesperate life of it with the lot of them. That apish-looking man\nthere, with the long beard and the loose trousers,--he is the\nwoman's brother. He is nearly as bad as she is. They are both of\nthem infidels.'\n\n'Infidels!' said Lady De Courcy, 'and their father a prebendary!'\n\n'Yes, and likely to be the new dean too,' said Mrs Proudie.\n\n'Oh, yes, poor dear Dr Trefoil!' said the countess, who had once in\nher life spoken to that gentleman; 'I was so distressed to hear it,\nMrs Proudie. And so Dr Stanhope is to be the new dean! He comes of\nan excellent family, and I wish him success in spite of his\ndaughter. Perhaps, Mrs Proudie, when he is dean, they'll be better\nable to see the error of their ways.'\n\nTo this Mrs Proudie said nothing. Her dislike of the Signora Neroni\nwas too deep to admit of her even hoping that that lady should see\nthe error of her ways. Mrs Proudie looked on the signora as one of\nthe lost,--one of those beyond the reach of Christian charity, and\nwas therefore able to enjoy the luxury of hating her, without the\ndrawback of wishing her eventually well out of her sins.\n\nAny further conversation between these congenial souls was\nprevented by the advent of Mr Thorne, who came to lead the countess\nto the tent. Indeed, he had been desired to do so some ten minutes\nsince; but he had been delayed in the drawing-room by the signora.\nShe had contrived to detain him, to bet him near to her sofa, and\nat last to make him seat himself on a chair close to her beautiful\narm. The fish took the bait, was hooked, and caught, and landed.\nWithin that ten minutes he had heard the whole of signora's history\nin such strains as she chose to use in telling it. He learnt from\nthe lady's own lips the whole of that mysterious tale to which the\nHonourable George had merely alluded. He discovered that the\nbeautiful creature lying before him had been more sinned against\nthan sinning. She had owned to him that she had been weak,\nconfiding and indifferent to the world's opinion, and that she had\ntherefore been ill-used, deceived and evil spoken of. She had\nspoken to him of her mutilated limb, her youth destroyed in the\nfullest bloom, her beauty robbed of its every charm, her life\nblighted, her hopes withered; and as she did so, a tear dropped\nfrom her eye to her cheek. She had told him of these things, and\nasked for his sympathy.\n\nWhat could a good-natured genial Anglo-Saxon Squire Thorne do but\npromise to sympathise with her? Mr Thorne did promise to\nsympathise; promised also to come and see the last of the Neros, to\nhear more of those fearful Roman days, of those light and innocent\nbut dangerous hours which flitted by so fast on the shores of Como,\nand to make himself the confidant of the signora's sorrows.\n\nWe need hardly say that he dropped all idea of warning his sister\nagainst the dangerous lady. He had been mistaken; never so much\nmistaken in his life. He had always regarded that Honourable George\nas a coarse brutal-minded young man; now he was more convinced than\never that he was so. It was by such men as the Honourable George\nthat the reputation of such women as Madeline Neroni were\nimperilled and damaged. He would go and see the lady in her own\nhouse; he was fully sure in his own mind of the soundness of his\nown judgment; if he found her, as he believed he should do, an\ninjured well-disposed, warm-hearted woman, he would get his sister\nMonica to invite her out to Ullathorne.\n\n'No,' said she, as at her instance he got up to leave her, and\ndeclared that he himself would attend upon her wants; 'no, no, my\nfriend; I positively put a veto upon your doing so. What, in your\nown house, with an assemblage round you such as there is here! Do\nyou wish to make every woman hate me and every man stare at me? I\nlay a positive order on you not to come near me again to-day. Come\nand see me at home. It is only at home that I can talk; it is only\nat home that I really can live and enjoy myself. My days of going\nout, days such as these, are rare indeed. Come and see me at home,\nMr Thorne, and then I will not bid you to leave me.'\n\nIt is, we believe, common with young men of five and twenty to look\non their seniors--on men of, say, double their own age--as so many\nstocks and stones--stocks and stones, that is, in regard to\nfeminine beauty. There never was a greater mistake. Women, indeed,\ngenerally know better; but on this subject men of one age are\nthoroughly ignorant of what is the very nature of mankind of other\nages. No experience of what goes on in the world, no reading of\nhistory, no observation of life, has any effect in teaching the\ntruth. Men of fifty don't dance mazurkas, being generally too fat\nand wheezy; nor do they sit for the hour together on river banks at\ntheir mistresses' feet, being somewhat afraid of rheumatism. But\nfor real true love, love at first sight, love to devotion, love\nthat robs a man of his sleep, love that 'will gaze an eagle blind,'\nlove that 'will hear the lowest sound when the suspicious tread of\ntheft is stopped,' love that is 'like a Hercules still climbing\ntrees in the Hesperides,'--we believe this best age is from\nforty-five to seventy; up to that, men are generally given to mere\nflirting.\n\nAt the present moment Mr Thorne, aetat. fifty, was over head and\nears in love at first sight with the Signora Madeline Vesey Neroni,\nnata Stanhope.\n\nNevertheless he was sufficiently master of himself to offer his arm\nwith all propriety to Lady De Courcy, and the countess graciously\npermitted herself to be led to the tent.\n\nSuch had been Miss Thorne's orders, as she had succeeded in\ninducing the bishop to lead old Lady Knowle to the top of the\ndining-room. One of the baronets was sent off in quest of Mrs\nProudie, and found that lady on the lawn not in the best of\nhumours. Mr Thorne and the countess had left her too abruptly; she\nhad in vain looked about for an attendant chaplain, or even a stray\ncurate; they were all drawing long bows with the young ladies at\nthe bottom of the lawn, or finding places for their graceful\nco-toxophilites in some snug corner of the tent. In such position\nMrs Proudie had been wont in earlier days to fall back upon Mr\nSlope; but now she could never fall back upon him again. She gave\nher head one shake as she thought of her lone position, and that\nshake was as good as a week deducted from Mr Slope's longer sojourn\nin Barchester. Sir Harkaway Gorse, however, relieved her present\nmisery, though his doing so by no means mitigated the sinning\nchaplain's doom.\n\nAnd now the eating and drinking began in earnest. Dr Grantly, to\nhis great horror, found himself leagued to Mrs Clantantram. Mrs\nClantantram had a great regard for the archdeacon, which was not\ncordially returned; and when she, coming up to him, whispered in\nhis ear, 'Come, archdeacon, I'm sure you won't begrudge an old\nfriend the favour of your arm,' and then proceeded to tell him the\nwhole history of her roquelaure, he resolved that he would shake\nher off before he was fifteen minutes older. But latterly the\narchdeacon had not been successful in his resolutions; and on the\npresent occasion Mrs Clantantram stuck to him till the banquet was\nover.\n\nDr Gwynne got a baronet's wife, and Mrs Grantly fell to the lot of\na baronet. Charlotte Stanhope attached herself to Mr Harding in\norder to make room for Bertie, who succeeded in sitting down in the\ndining-room next to Mrs Bold. To speak sooth, now that he had love\nin earnest to make, his heart almost failed him.\n\nEleanor had been right glad to avail herself of his arm, seeing\nthat Mr Slope was hovering nigh her. In striving to avoid that\nterrible Charybdis of a Slope she was in great danger of falling\ninto an unseen Scylla on the other hand, that Scylla being Bertie\nStanhope. Nothing could be more gracious than she was to Bertie.\nShe almost jumped at his proffered arm. Charlotte perceived this\nfrom a distance, and triumphed in her heart; Bertie felt it, and\nwas encouraged; Mr Slope saw it, and glowered with jealousy.\nEleanor and Bertie sat down to table in the dining-room; and as she\ntook her seat at his right hand, she found that Mr Slope was\nalready in possession of the chair at her own.\n\nAs these things were going on in the dining-room, Mr Arabin was\nhanging enraptured and alone over the signora's sofa; and Eleanor\nfrom her seat could look through the open door and see that he was\ndoing so.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\nTHE BISHOP SITS DOWN TO BREAKFAST, AND THE DEAN DIES\n\nThe bishop of Barchester said grace over the well-spread board in\nthe Ullathorne dining-room; and while he did so the last breath was\nflying from the dean of Barchester as he lay in his sick-room in\nthe deanery. When the bishop of Barchester raised his first glass\nof champagne to his lips, the deanship of Barchester was a good\nthing in the gift of the prime minister. Before the bishop of\nBarchester had left the table, the minister of the day was made\naware of the fact at his country seat in Hampshire, and had already\nturned over in his mind the names of five very respectable\naspirants for the preferment. It is at present only necessary to\nsay that Mr Slope's name was not among the five.\n\n''Twas merry in the hall when the beards wagged all;' and the\nclerical beards wagged merrily in the hall of Ullathorne that day.\nIt was not till after the last cork had been drawn, the last speech\nmade, the last nut cracked, that tidings reached and were whispered\nabout that the poor dean was no more. It was well for the happiness\nof the clerical beards that this little delay took place, as\notherwise decency would have forbidden them to wag at all.\n\nBut there was one sad man among them that day. Mr Arabin's beard\ndid not wag as it should have done. He had come there hoping the\nbest, striving to think the best about Eleanor; turning over in his\nmind all the words he remembered to have fallen from her about Mr\nSlope, and trying to gather from them a conviction unfavourable to\nhis rival. He had not exactly resolved to come that day to some\ndecisive proof as to the widow's intention; but he had meant, if\npossible, to re-cultivate his friendship with Eleanor; and in his\npresent frame of mind any such re-cultivation must have ended in a\ndeclaration of love.\n\nHe had passed the previous night alone at his new parsonage, and it\nwas the first night that he had so passed. It had been dull and\nsombre enough. Mrs Grantly had been right in saying that a\npriestess would be wanting at St Ewold's. He had sat there alone\nwith his glass before him, and then with his teapot, thinking about\nEleanor Bold. As is usual in such meditations, he did little but\nblame her; blame her for liking Mr Slope, and blame her for not\nliking him; blame her for her cordiality to himself, and blame her\nfor her want of cordiality; blame her for being stubborn,\nheadstrong, and passionate; and yet the more he thought of her the\nhigher she rose in his affection. If only it should turn out, if\nonly it could be made to turn out, that she had defended Mr Slope,\nnot from love, but on principle, all would be right. Such principle\nin itself would be admirable, loveable, womanly; he felt that he\ncould be pleased to allow Mr Slope just so much favour as that. But\nif--And then Mr Arabin poked his fire most unnecessarily, spoke\ncrossly to his new parlour-maid who came in for the tea-things, and\nthrew himself back in his chair determined to go to sleep. Why had\nshe been so stiff-necked when asked a plain question? She could not\nbut have known in what light he regarded her. Why had she not\nanswered a plain question, and so put an end to his misery? Then,\ninstead of going to sleep in his arm-chair, Mr Arabin walked about\nthe room as though he had been possessed.\n\nOn the following morning, when he attended Miss Thorne's behests,\nhe was still in a somewhat confused state. His first duty had been\nto converse with Mrs Clantantram, and that lady had found it\nimpossible to elicit the slightest sympathy from him on the subject\nof hr roquelaure. Miss Thorne had asked him whether Mrs Bold was\ncoming with the Grantlys; and the two names of Bold and Grantly\ntogether had nearly made him jump from his seat.\n\nHe was in this state of confused uncertainty, hope, and doubt, when\nhe saw Mr Slope, with his most polished smile, handing Eleanor out\nof her carriage. He thought of nothing more. He never considered\nwhether the carriage belonged to her or to Mr Slope, or to any one\nelse to whom they might both be mutually obliged without any\nconcert between themselves. The sight in his present state of mind\nwas quite enough to upset him and his resolves. It was clear as\nnoonday. Had he seen her handed into a carriage by Mr Slope at a\nchurch door with a white veil over her head, the truth could not be\nmore manifest. He went into the house, and, as we have seen, soon\nfound himself walking with Mr Harding. Shortly afterwards Eleanor\ncame up; and then he had to leave his companion, and either go\nabout alone or find another. While in this state he was encountered\nby the archdeacon.\n\n'I wonder,' said Dr Grantly, 'if it be true that Mr Slope and Mrs\nBold come here together. Susan says she is almost sure she saw\ntheir faces in the same carriage as she got out of her own.'\n\nMr Arabin had nothing for it but to bear his testimony to the\ncorrectness of Mrs Grantly's eyesight.\n\n'It is perfectly shameful,' said the archdeacon; 'or I should\nrather say, shameless. She was asked her as my guest; and if she be\ndetermined to disgrace herself, she should have feeling enough not\nto do so before my immediate friends. I wonder how that man got\nhimself invited. I wonder whether she had the face to bring him.'\n\nTo this Mr Arabin could answer nothing, nor did he wish to answer\nanything. Though he abused Eleanor to himself, he did not choose to\nabuse to any one else, nor was he well pleased to hear any one else\nspeak ill of her. Dr Grantly, however, was very angry, and did not\nspare his sister-in-law. Mr Arabin therefore left him as soon as he\ncould, and wandered back into the house.\n\nIt is impossible to say how the knowledge had been acquired, but\nthe signora had a sort of instinctive knowledge that Mr Arabin was\nan admirer of Mrs Bold. Men hunt foxes by the aid of dogs, and are\naware that they do so by the strong organ of smell with which the\ndog is endowed. They do not, however, in the least comprehend how\nsuch a sense can work with such acuteness. The organ by which woman\ninstinctively, as it were, know and feel how other women are\nregarded by men, and how also men are regarded by other women, is\nequally strong, and equally incomprehensible. A glance, a word, a\nmotion, suffices: by some such acute exercise of her feminine\nsenses the signora was aware that Mr Arabin loved Eleanor Bold; and\ntherefore, by a further exercise of her peculiar feminine\npropensities, it was quite natural for her to entrap Mr Arabin into\nher net.\n\nThe work was half done before she came to Ullathorne, and when\ncould she have a better opportunity of completing it? She had had\nalmost enough of Mr Slope, though she could not quite resist the\nfun of driving a very sanctimonious clergyman to madness by a\ndesperate and ruinous passion. Mr Thorne had fallen too easily to\ngive much pleasure in the chase. His position as a man of wealth\nmight make his alliance of value, but as a lover he was very\nsecond-rate. We may say that she regarded him somewhat as a\nsportsman does a pheasant. The bird is so easily shot, that he\nwould not be worth the shooting were it not for the very\nrespectable appearance that he makes in a larder. The signora would\nnot waste much time in shooting Mr Thorne, but still he was worth\nbagging for family uses.\n\nBut Mr Arabin was game of another sort. The signora was herself\npossessed of quite sufficient intelligence to know that Mr Arabin\nwas a man more than usually intellectual. She knew also, that as a\nclergyman he was of a much higher stamp than Mr Slope, and that as\ngentleman he was better educated than Mr Thorne. She would never\nhave attempted to drive Mr Arabin into ridiculous misery as she did\nMr Slope, nor would she think it possible to dispose of him in ten\nminutes as she had done with Mr Thorne.\n\nSuch were her reflections about Mr Arabin. As to Mr Arabin, it\ncannot be said that he reflected at all about the signora.\n\nHe knew that she was beautiful, and he felt that she was able to\ncharm him. He required charming in his present misery, and\ntherefore he went and stood at the head of her couch. She knew all\nabout it. Such were her peculiar gifts.\n\nIt was her nature to see that he required charming, and it was her\nprovince to charm him. As the Easter idler swallows his dose of\nopium, as the London reprobate swallows his dose of gin, so with\nsimilar desire and for similar reasons did Mr Arabin prepare to\nswallow the charms of the Signora Neroni.\n\n'Why aren't you shooting with bows and arrows, Mr Arabin?' said\nshe, when they were nearly alone together in the sitting-room; 'or\ntalking with young ladies in shady bowers, or turning your talents\nto account in some way? What was a bachelor like you asked here\nfor? Don't you mean to earn your cold chicken and champagne? Were I\nyou, I should be ashamed to be so idle.'\n\nMr Arabin murmured some sort of answer. Though he wished to be\ncharmed, he as hardly yet in a mood to be playful in return.\n\n'Why, what ails you, Mr Arabin?' said she, 'here you are in your\nown parish; Miss Thorne tells me that her party is given expressly\nin your honour; and yet you are the only dull man in it. Your\nfriend Mr Slope was with me a few minutes since, full of life and\nspirits' why don't you rival him?'\n\nIt was not difficult for so acute an observer as Madeline Neroni to\nsee that she had hit the nail on the head and driven the bolt home.\nMr Arabin winced visibly before her attack, and she knew at once\nthat he was jealous of Mr Slope.\n\n'But I look on you and Mr Slope as the very antipodes of men,' said\nshe. 'There is nothing in which you are not each the reverse of the\nother, except in belonging to the same profession; and even in that\nyou are so unlike as perfectly to maintain the rule. He is\ngregarious, you are given to solitude. He is active, you are\npassive. He works, you think. He likes women, you despise them. He\nis fond of position and power, and so are you, but for directly\ndifferent reasons. He loves to be praised, you very foolishly abhor\nit. He will gain his rewards, which will be an insipid useful wife,\na comfortable income, and a reputation for sanctimony. You will\nalso gain yours.'\n\n'Well, and what will they be?' said Mr Arabin, who knew that he was\nbeing flattered, and yet suffered himself to put up with it. 'What\nwill be my rewards?'\n\n'The heart of some woman whom you will be too austere to own that\nyou love, and the respect of some few friends which you will be too\nproud to own that you value.'\n\n'Rich rewards,' said he; 'but of little worth if they are to be so\ntreated.'\n\n'Oh, you are not to look for such success as awaits Mr Slope. He is\nborn to be a successful man. He suggests to himself an object, and\nthen starts for it with eager intention. Nothing will deter him\nfrom his pursuit. He will have no scruples, no fears, no\nhesitation. His desire is to be a bishop with a rising family, the\nwife will come first, and in due time the apron. You will see all\nthis, and then--'\n\n'Well, and what then?'\n\n'Then you will begin to wish that you had done the same.'\n\nMr Arabin look placidly out at the lawn, and resting his shoulder\non the head of the sofa, rubbed his chin with his hand. It was a\ntrick he had when he was thinking deeply; and what the signora said\nmade him think. Was it not all true? Would he not hereafter look\nback, if not at Mr Slope, at some others, people not equally gifted\nwith himself, who had risen in the world while he had lagged\nbehind, and then wish that he had done the same?\n\n'Is not such the doom of all speculative men of talent?' said she.\n'Do they not all sit rapt as you now are, cutting imaginary silken\ncords with their fine edges, while those not so highly tempered\nsever the every-day Gordian knots of the world's struggle, and win\nwealth and renown? Steel too highly polished, edges too sharp, do\nnot do for this world's work, Mr Arabin.'\n\nWho was this woman that thus read the secrets of his heart, and\nre-uttered to him the unwelcome bodings of his own soul? He looked\nfull into her face when she had done speaking, and said, 'Am I one\nof those foolish blades, too sharp and too fine to do a useful\nday's work?'\n\n'Why do you let the Slopes of the world out-distance you?' said\nshe. 'It not the blood in your veins as warm as his? does not your\npulse beat as fast? Has not God made you a man, and intended you to\ndo a man's work here, ay, and to take a man's wages also?'\n\nMr Arabin sat ruminating and rubbing his face, and wondering why\nthese things were said to him; but he replied nothing. The signora\nwent on--\n\n'The greatest mistake any man ever made is to suppose that the good\nthings of the world are not worth the winning. And it is a mistake\nso opposed to the religion which you preach! Why does God permit\nhis bishops one after the other to have their five thousands and\nten thousands a year if such wealth be bad and not worth having?\nWhy are beautiful things given to us, and luxuries and pleasant\nenjoyments, if they be not intended to be used? They must be meant\nfor some one, and what is good for a layman cannot surely be bad\nfor a clerk. You try to despise these good things, but you only\ntry; you don't succeed.'\n\n'Don't I,' said Mr Arabin, still musing, and not knowing what he\nsaid.\n\n'I ask you the question: do you succeed?'\n\nMr Arabin looked at her piteously. It seemed to him as though he\nwere being interrogated by some inner spirit of his own, to whom he\ncould not refuse an answer, and to whom he did not dare to give a\nfalse reply.\n\n'Come, Mr Arabin, confess; do you succeed? Is money so\ncontemptible? Is worldly power so worthless? Is feminine beauty a\ntrifle to be so slightly regarded by a wise man?'\n\n'Feminine beauty!' said he, gazing into her face, as though all the\nfeminine beauty in the world was concentrated there. 'Why do you\nsay I do not regard it?'\n\n'If you look at me like that, Mr Arabin, I shall alter my\nopinion--or should do so, were I not of course aware that I have no\nbeauty of my own worth regarding.'\n\nThe gentleman blushed crimson, but the lady did not blush at all. A\nslightly increased colour animated her face, just so much so as to\ngive her an air of special interest. She expected a compliment from\nher admirer, but she was rather grateful than otherwise by finding\nthat he did not pay it to her. Messrs Slope and Thorne, Messrs\nBrown, Jones and Robinson, they all paid her compliments. She was\nrather in hopes that she would ultimately succeed in inducing Mr\nArabin to abuse her.\n\n'But your gaze,' said she, 'is one of wonder, and not of\nadmiration. You wonder at my audacity in asking you such questions\nabout yourself.'\n\n'Well, I do rather,' said he.\n\n'Nevertheless I expect an answer, Mr Arabin. Why were women made\nbeautiful if men are not to regard them?'\n\n'But men do regard them,' he replied.\n\n'And why not you?'\n\n'You are begging the question, Madame Neroni.'\n\n'I am sure that I shall beg nothing, Mr Arabin, which you will not\ngrant, and I do beg for an answer. Do you not as a rule think women\nbelow your notice as companions? Let us see. There is the widow\nBold looking round at you from her chair this minute. What would\nyou say to her as a companion for life?'\n\nMr Arabin, rising from his position, leaned over the sofa and\nlooked through the drawing-room door to the place where Eleanor was\nseated between Bertie Stanhope and Mr Slope. She at once caught his\nglance, and averted her own. She was not pleasantly placed in her\npresent position. Mr Slope was doing his best to attract her\nattention; and she was striving to prevent his doing so by talking\nto Mr Stanhope, while her mind was intently fixed on Mr Arabin and\nMadame Neroni. Bertie Stanhope endeavoured to take advantage of her\nfavours, but he was thinking more of the manner in which he would\nby-and-by throw himself at her feet, than of amusing her at the\npresent moment.\n\n'There,' said the signora. 'She was stretching her beautiful neck\nto look at you, and now you have disturbed her. Well I declare, I\nbelieve I am wrong about you; I believe that you do think Mrs Bold\na charming woman. Your looks seem to say so; and by her looks I\nshould say that she is jealous of me. Come, Mr Arabin, confide in\nme, and if it is so, I'll do all in my power to make up the match.'\n\nIt is needless to say that the signora was not very sincere in her\noffer. She was never sincere on such subjects. She never expected\nothers to be so, nor did she expect others to think her so. Such\nmatters were her playthings, her billiard table, her hounds and\nhunters, her waltzes and polkas, her picnics and summer-day\nexcursions. She had little else to amuse her, and therefore played\nat love-making in all its forms. She was now playing at it with Mr\nArabin, and did not at all expect the earnestness and truth of his\nanswer.\n\n'All in your power would be nothing,' said he; 'for Mrs Bold is, I\nimagine, already engaged to another.'\n\n'Then you own the impeachment yourself.'\n\n'You cross-question me rather unfairly,' he replied, 'and I do not\nknow why I answer you at all. Mrs Bold is a very beautiful woman,\nand as intelligent as beautiful. It is impossible to know her\nwithout admiring her.'\n\n'So you think the widow a very beautiful woman?'\n\n'Indeed I do.'\n\n'And one that would grace the parsonage at St Ewold's.'\n\n'One that would grace any man's house.'\n\n'And you really have the effrontery to tell me this,' said she; 'to\ntell me, who, as you very well know, set up to be a beauty myself,\nand who am at this very moment taking such an interest in your\naffairs, you really have the effrontery to tell me that Mrs Bold is\nthe most beautiful woman you know.'\n\n'I did not say so,' said Mr Arabin; 'you are more beautiful--'\n\n'Ah, come now, that is something like. I thought you would not be\nso unfeeling.'\n\n'You are more beautiful, perhaps more clever.'\n\n'Thank you, thank you, Mr Arabin. I knew that you and I should be\nfriends.'\n\n'But--'\n\n'Not a word further. I will not hear a word further. If you talk\ntill midnight, you cannot improve what you have said.'\n\n'But Madame Neroni, Mrs Bold--'\n\n'I will not hear a word about Mrs Bold. Dread thoughts of\nstrychnine did pass across my brain, but she is welcome to the\nsecond place.'\n\n'Her place--'\n\n'I won't hear anything about her or her place. I am satisfied and\nthat is enough. But, Mr Arabin, I am dying with hunger; beautiful\nand clever as I am, you know I cannot go to my food, and yet you do\nnot bring it to me.'\n\nThis at any rate was so true as to make it unnecessary that Mr\nArabin should not act upon it, and he accordingly went into the\ndining-room and supplied the signora's wants.\n\n'And yourself,' said she.\n\n'Oh,' said he, 'I am not hungry; I never eat at this hour.'\n\n'Come, come, Mr Arabin, don't let love interfere with your\nappetite. It never does with mine. Give me half a glass more\nchampagne, and then go to the table. Mrs Bold will do me an injury\nif you stay talking to me any longer.'\n\nMr Arabin did as he was bid. He took her plate and glass from her,\nand going into the dining-room, helped himself to a sandwich from\nthe crowded table and began munching it in a corner.\n\nAs he was doing so, Miss Thorne, who had hardly sat down for a\nmoment, came into the room, and seeing him standing, was greatly\ndistressed.\n\n'Oh, my dear Mr Arabin,' said she, 'have you never sat down yet? I\nam so distressed. You of all men too.'\n\nMr Arabin assured her that he had only just come into the room.\n\n'That is the very reason why you should lose no more time. Come\nI'll make room for you. Thank'ee my dear,' she said, seeing that\nMrs Bold was making an attempt to move from her chair, 'but I would\nnot for the world see you stir, for all the ladies would think it\nnecessary to follow. But, perhaps, if Mr Stanhope has done--just\nfor a minute, Mr Stanhope--till I can get another chair.'\n\nAnd so Bertie had to rise to make way for his rival. This he did,\nas he did everything, with an air of good-humoured pleasantry,\nwhich made it impossible for Mr Arabin to refuse the proffered\nseat.\n\n'His bishopric let another take,' said Bertie; the quotation being\ncertainly not very appropriate, either for the occasion, or the\nperson spoken to. 'I have eaten and am satisfied; Mr Arabin, pray\ntake my chair. I wish for your sake, it really was a bishop's\nseat.'\n\nMr Arabin did sit down, and as he did so, Mrs Bold got up as though\nto follow her neighbour.\n\n'Pray, pray don't move,' said Miss Thorne, almost forcing Eleanor\nback into her chair. 'Mr Stanhope is not going to leave us. He will\nstand behind you like a true knight as he is. And now I think of\nit, Mr Arabin, let me introduce you to Mr Slope. Mr Slope, Mr\nArabin.' And the two gentlemen bowed stiffly to each other across\nthe lady they both intended to marry, while the other gentleman who\nalso intended to marry her stood behind, watching them.\n\nThe two had never met each other before, and the present was\ncertainly not a good opportunity for much cordial conversation,\neven if cordial conversation between them had been possible. As it\nwas, the whole four who formed the party seemed as though their\ntongues were tied. Mr Slope, who was wide awake to what he hoped\nwas his coming opportunity, was not much concerned in the interest\nof the moment. His wish was to see Eleanor move, that he might\npursue her. Bertie was not exactly in the same frame of mind; the\nevil of the day was near enough; there was no reason why he should\nprecipitate it. He had made up his mind to marry Eleanor Bold if he\ncould, and was resolved to-day to take the first preliminary step\ntowards doing so. But there was time enough before him. He was not\ngoing to make an offer of marriage over the table-cloth. Having\nthus good-naturedly made way for Mr Arabin, he was willing also to\nlet him talk to the future Mrs Stanhope as long as they remained in\ntheir present position.\n\nMr Arabin bowed to Mr Slope, began eating his food, without saying\na word further. He was full of thoughts, and though he ate he did\nso unconsciously.\n\nBut poor Eleanor was the most to be pitied. The only friend on whom\nshe thought she could rely, was Bertie Stanhope, and he, it seemed,\nwas determined to desert her. Mr Arabin did not attempt to address\nher. She said a few words in reply to some remarks from Mr Slope,\nand then feeling the situation too much for her, started from her\nchair in spite of Miss Thorne, and hurried from the room. Mr Slope\nfollowed her, and young Stanhope lost the occasion.\n\nMadame Neroni, when she was left alone, could not help pondering\nmuch on the singular interview she had had with this singular man.\nNot a word that she had spoken to him had been intended by her to\nbe received as true, and yet he had answered her in the very spirit\nof truth. He had done so, and she had been aware that he had done\nso. She had wormed from him his secret; and he, debarred as it\nwould seem from man's usual privilege of lying, had innocently laid\nbare his whole soul to her. He loved Eleanor Bold, but Eleanor was\nnot in his eyes so beautiful as herself. He would fain have Eleanor\nfor his wife, but yet he had acknowledged that she was the less\ngifted of the two. The man had literally been unable to falsify his\nthoughts when questioned, and had been compelled to be true malgre\nlui, even when truth must have been disagreeable to him.\n\nThis teacher of men, this Oxford pundit, this double-distilled\nquintessence of university perfection, this writer of religious\ntreatises, this speaker of ecclesiastical speeches, had been like a\nlittle child in her hands; she had turned him inside out, and read\nhis very heart as she might have done that of a young girl. She\ncould not but despise him for his facile openness, and yet she\nliked him too. It was a novelty to her, a new trait in a man's\ncharacter. She felt also that she could never so completely make a\nfool of him as she did of the Slopes and the Thornes. She felt that\nshe could never induce Mr Arabin to make protestations to her that\nwere not true, or to listen to nonsense that was mere nonsense.\n\nIt was quite clear that Mr Arabin was heartily in love with Mrs\nBold, and the signora, with very unwonted good nature, began to\nturn it over in her mind whether she could not do him a good turn.\nOf course Bertie was to have the first chance. It was an understood\nfamily arrangement that her brother was, if possible, to marry the\nwidow Bold. Madeline knew too well the necessities and what was due\nto her sister to interfere with so excellent a plan, as long as it\nmight be feasible. But she had strong suspicion that it was not\nfeasible. She did not think it likely that Mrs Bold would accept a\nman in her brother's position, and she had frequently said so to\nCharlotte. She was inclined to believe that Mr Slope had more\nchance of success; and with her it would be a labour of love to rob\nMr Slope of his wife.\n\nAnd so the signora resolved, should Bertie fail, to do a\ngood-natured act for once in her life, and give up Mr Arabin to the\nwoman whom he loved.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\nTHE LOOKALOFTS AND THE GREENACRES\n\nOn the whole, Miss Thorne's provision for the amusement and feeding\nof the outer classes in the exoteric paddock was not unsuccessful.\n\nTwo little drawbacks to the general happiness did take place, but\nthey were of a temporary nature, and apparent rather than real. The\nfirst was the downfall of young Harry Greenacre, and the other was\nthe uprise of Mrs Lookaloft and her family.\n\nAs to the quintain, it became more popular among the boys on foot,\nthan it would ever have been among the men on horseback, even had\nyoung Greenacre been more successful. It was twirled round and\nround till it was nearly twisted out of the ground; and the bag of\nflour was used with great gusto in powdering the backs and heads of\nall who could be coaxed within the vicinity.\n\nOf course it was reported all throughout the assemblage that Harry\nwas dead, and there was a pathetic scene between him and his mother\nwhen it was found that he had escaped scatheless from the fall. A\ngood deal of beer was drunk on the occasion, and the quintain was\n'dratted' and 'bothered', and very generally anathematised by all\nthe mothers who had young sons likely to be placed in similar\njeopardy. But the affair of Mrs Lookaloft was of a more serious\nnature.\n\n'I do tell 'ee plainly,--face to face--she be there in madam's\ndrawing-room; herself and Gussy, and them two walloping gals,\ndressed up to their very eyeses.' This was said by a very positive,\nvery indignant, and very fat farmer's wife, who was sitting on the\nend of a bench leaning on the handle of a huge cotton umbrella.\n\n'But you didn't zee her, Dame Guffern?' said Mrs Greenacres, whom\nthis information, joined to the recent peril undergone by her son,\nalmost overpowered. Mr Greenacres held just as much land as Mr\nLookaloft, paid his rent quite as punctually, and his opinion in\nthe vestry-room was reckoned to be every whit as good. Mrs\nLookaloft's rise in the world had been wormwood to Mrs Greenacre.\nShe had not taste herself for the sort of finery which converted\nBarleystubb farm into Rosebank, and which had occasionally graced\nMr Lookaloft's letters with the dignity of esquirehood. She had no\nwish to convert her own homeland into Violet Villa, or to see her\ngoodman go about with a new-fangled handle to his name. But it was\na mortal injury to her that Mrs Lookaloft should be successful in\nher hunt after such honours. She had abused and ridiculed Mrs\nLookaloft to the extent of her little power. She had pushed against\nher going out of church, and had excused herself with all the\neasiness of equality. 'Ah, dame, I axes pardon; but you be grown so\nmortal stout these time.' She had inquired with apparent cordiality\nof Mr Lookaloft after 'the woman that owned him,' and had, as she\nthought, been on the whole able to hold her own pretty well against\nher aspiring neighbour. Now, however, she found herself distinctly\nput into a separate and inferior class. Mrs Lookaloft was asked\ninto the Ullathorne drawing-room, merely because she called her\nhouse Rosebank, and had talked over her husband into buying pianos\nand silk dresses instead of putting his money by to stock farms for\nhis sons.\n\nMrs Greenacre, much as she reverenced Miss Thorne, and highly as\nshe respected her husband's landlord, could not but look on this as\nan act of injustice done to her and hers. Hitherto the Lookalofts\nhad never been recognised as being of a different class from the\nGreenacres. Their pretensions were all self-pretensions, their\nfinery was all paid for by themselves and not granted to them by\nothers. The local sovereigns of the vicinity, the district\nfountains of honour, had hitherto conferred on them the stamp of no\nrank. Hitherto their crinoline petticoats, late hours, and mincing\ngait had been a fair subject of Mrs Greenacre's raillery, and this\nraillery had been a safety valve for her envy. Now, however, and\nfrom henceforward, the case would be very different. Now the\nLookalofts would boast that their aspirations had been sanctioned\nby the gentry of the country; now they would declare with some show\nof truth that their claims to peculiar consideration had been\nrecognised. They had sat as equal guests in the presence of bishops\nand baronets; they had been curtseyed to by Miss Thorne on her own\ndrawing-room carpet; they were about to sit down to table in\ncompany with a live countess! Bab Lookaloft, as she had always been\ncalled by the young Greenacres in the days of their juvenile\nequality, might possibly sit next to the Honourable George, and\nthat wretched Gussy might be permitted to hand a custard to the\nLady Margaretta De Courcy.\n\nThe fruition of these honours, or such of them as fell to the lot\nof the envied family, was not such as should have caused much envy.\nThe attention paid to the Lookalofts by the De Courcys was very\nlimited, and the amount of society was hardly in itself a\nrecompense for the dull monotony of their day. But of what they\nendured Mrs Greenacre took no account; she thought only of what she\nconsidered they must enjoy, and of the dreadfully exalted tone of\nliving which would be manifested by the Rosebank family, as the\nconsequence of their present distinction.\n\n'But did 'ee zee 'em there, dame, did 'ee zee 'em then with your\nown eyes?' asked poor Mrs Greenacre, still hoping that there might\nbe some ground for doubt.\n\n'And how could I do that, unless so be I was there myself?' asked\nMrs Guffen. 'I didn't set eyes on none of them this blessed\nmorning, but I zee'd them as did. You know our John; well, he will\nbe for keeping company with Betsey Rusk, madam's own maid, you\nknow. And Betsey isn't one of your common kitchen wenches. So\nBetsey, she come out to our John, you know, and she's always vastly\npolite to me, is Betsey Rusk, I must say. So before she took so\nmuch as one turn with John, she told me every ha'porth that was\ngoing on up in the house.'\n\n'Did she now?' said Mrs Greenacre.\n\n'Indeed she did,' said Mrs Guffern.\n\n'And she told you them people was up there in the drawing-room?'\n\n'She told me she zee'd them come in--that they was dressed finer by\nhalf nor any of the family, with all their neckses and buzoms stark\nnaked as a born babby.'\n\n'The minxes!' exclaimed Mrs Greenacre, who felt herself more put\nabout by this than any other mark of aristocratic distinction which\nher enemies had assumed.\n\n'Yes, indeed,' continued Mrs Guffern, 'as naked as you please,\nwhile all the quality was dressed just as you and I be, Mrs\nGreenacre.'\n\n'Drat their impudence' said Mrs Greenacre, from whose well-covered\nbosom all milk of human kindness was receding, as far as the family\nof the Lookalofts were concerned.\n\n'So says I,' said Mrs Guffern; 'and so says my good-man Thomas\nGuffern, when he hear'd it. \"Molly,\" says he to me, \"if ever you\ntakes to going about o' mornings with yourself all naked in them\nways, I begs you won't come back no more to the old house.\" So says\nI, \"Thomas, no more I wull.\" \"But,\" says he, \"drat it, how the\ndeuce does she manage with her rheumatiz, and she not a rag on\nher:\"' said Mrs Giffern, laughed loudly as she though of Mrs\nLookalofts's probable sufferings from rheumatic attacks.\n\n'But to liken herself that way to folk that ha' blood in their\nveins,' said Mrs Greenacre.\n\n'Well, but that warn't all neither that Betsey told. There they all\nswelled into madam's drawing-room, like so many turkey cocks, as\nmuch to say, \"and who dare say no to us?\" and Gregory was thinking\nof telling them to come down here, only his heart failed him 'cause\nof the grand way they was dressed. So in they went; but madam\nlooked at them as glum as death.'\n\n'Well now,' said Mrs Greenacre, greatly relieved, 'so they wasn't\naxed different from us all then?'\n\n'Betsey says that Gregory says that madam wasn't a bit too well\npleased to see them where they was and that, to his believing, they\nwas expected to come here just like the rest of us.'\n\nThere was great consolation in this. Not that Mrs Greenacre was\naltogether satisfied. She felt that justice to herself demanded\nthat Mrs Lookaloft should not only not be encouraged, but that she\nshould also be absolutely punished.\n\nWhat had been done at that scriptural banquet, of which Mrs\nGreenacre so often read the account to her family? Why had not Miss\nThorne boldly gone to the intruder and said: 'Friend, thou hast\ncome up hither to high places not fitted for thee. Go down lower,\nand thou wilt find thy mates.' Let the Lookalofts be treated at the\npresent moment with ever so cold a shoulder, they would still be\nenabled to boast hereafter of their position, their aspirations,\nand their honour.\n\n'Well, with all her grandeur, I do wonder that she be so mean,\ncontinued Mrs Greenacre, unable to dismiss the subject.\n 'Did you hear, goodman?' she went on, about to repeat the whole\nstory to her husband who then came up. 'There's dame Lookaloft and\nBab and Gussy and the lot of 'em all sitting as grand as fivepence\nin madam's drawing-room, and they not axed no more nor you nor me.\nDid you ever hear tell the like o' that?'\n\n'Well, and what for shouldn't they?' said Farmer Greenacre.\n\n'Likening theyselves to the quality, as though they was estated\nfolk, or the like o' that!' said Mrs Guffern.\n\n'Well, if they likes it and madam likes it, they's welcome for me,'\nsaid the farmer. 'Now I likes the place better, cause I be more at\nhome like, and don't have to pay for them fine clothes for the\nmissus. Every one to his taste, Mrs Guffern, and if neighbour\nLookaloft thinks that he has the best of it, he's welcome.'\n\nMrs Greenacre sat down by her husband's side to begin the heavy\nwork of the banquet, and she did so in some measure of restored\ntranquillity, but nevertheless she shook her head at her gossip to\nshow that in this instance she did not quite approve of her\nhusband's doctrine.\n\n'And I'll tell 'ee what, dames,' continued he; 'if so be that we\ncannot enjoy the dinner that madam gives us because Mother\nLookaloft is sitting up there on a grand sofa, I think we ought all\nto go home. If we greet at that, what'll we do when true sorrow\ncomes across us? How would you be now, dame, if the boy there had\nbroke his neck when he got the tumble?'\n\nMrs Greenacre was humbled, and said nothing further on the matter.\nBut let prudent men, such as Mr Greenacre, preach as they will, the\nfamily of the Lookalofts certainly does occasion a good deal of\nheart-burning in the world at large.\n\nIt was pleasant to see Mr Plomacy, as leaning on his stout stick he\nwent about among the rural guests, acting as a sort of head\nconstable as well as master of the revels. 'Now, young 'un, if you\ncan't manage to get along without that screeching, you'd better go\nto the other side of the twelve-acre field, and take your dinner\nwith you. Come, girls, what do you stand there for, twirling of\nyour thumbs? come out, and let the lads see you; you've no need to\nbe so ashamed of your faces. Hello! there, who are you? how did you\nmake your way in here?'\n\nThis last disagreeable question was put to a young man of about\ntwenty-four, who did not, in Mr Plomacy's eye, bear sufficient\nvestiges of a rural education and residence.\n\n'If you please, your worship, Master Barrell the coachman let me in\nat the church wicket, 'cause I do be working mostly al'ays for the\nfamily.'\n\n'Then Master Barrell the coachman may let you out again,' said Mr\nPlomacy, not even conciliated by the magisterial dignity which had\nbeen conceded to him. 'What's your name? And what trade are you,\nand who do you work for?'\n\n'I'm Stubbs, your worship, Bob Stubbs; and--and--and--'\n\n'And what's your trade, Stubbs?'\n\n'Plaisterer, please your worship.'\n\n'I'll plaister you and Barrell too; you'll just walk out of this\n'ere field as quick as you walked in. We don't want no plaisterers;\nwhen we do, we'll send for 'em. Come, my buck, walk.'\n\nStubbs the plasterer was much downcast at the dreadful edict. He\nwas a sprightly fellow, and had contrived since his egress into the\nUllathorne elysium to attract to himself a forest nymph, to whom he\nwas whispering a plasterer's usual soft nothings, when he was\nencountered by the great Mr Plomacy. It was dreadful to be thus\ndissevered from the dryad, and sent howling back to a Barchester\npandemonium just as the nectar and ambrosia were about to descend\non the fields of asphodel. He began to try what prayers would do,\nbut city prayers were vain against the great rural potentate. Not\nonly did Mr Plomacy order his exit, but raising his stick to show\nthe way which led to the gate that had been left in the custody of\nthat false Cerberus Barrell, proceeded himself to see the edict of\nbanishment carried out.\n\nThe goddess Mercy, however, the sweetest goddess that ever sat upon\na cloud, and the dearest to poor frail erring man appeared on the\nfield in the person of Mr Greenacre. Never was interceding goddess\nmore welcome.\n\n'Come, man,' said Mr Greenacre, 'never stick at trifles such a day\nas this. I know the lad well. Let him bide at my axing. Madam won't\nmiss what he can eat and drink, I know.'\n\nNow Mr Plomacy and Mr Greenacre were sworn friends. Mr Plomacy had\nat his own disposal as comfortable a room as there was in\nUllathorne House; but he was a bachelor, and alone there; and,\nmoreover, smoking in the house was not allowed even to Mr Plomacy.\nHis moments of truest happiness were spent in a huge arm-chair in\nthe warmest corner of Mrs Greenacre's beautifully clean front\nkitchen. 'Twas there that the inner man dissolved itself, and\npoured itself out in streams of pleasant chat; 'twas there, and\nperhaps there only, that he could unburden himself from the\nceremonies of life without offending the dignity of those above\nhim, or incurring the familiarity of those below. 'Twas there that\nhis long pipe was always to be found on the accustomed chimney\nboard, not only permitted but encouraged.\n\nSuch being the state of the case, it was not to be supposed that Mr\nPlomacy could refuse such a favour to Mr Greenacre; but\nnevertheless he not grant it without some further show of austere\nauthority.\n\n'Eat and drink, Mr Greenacre! No. it's not what he eats and drinks;\nbut the example such a chap shows, coming in where he's not\ninvited--a chap of his age too. He too that never did a day's work\nabout Ullathorne since he was born. Plaisterer! I'll plaister him!'\n\n'He worked long enough for me, then Mr Plomacy. And a good hand he\nis at setting tiles as any in Barchester,' said the other, not\nsticking quite to veracity, as indeed mercy never should. 'Come,\ncome, let him alone to-day, and quarrel with him to-morrow. You\nwouldn't shame him before his lass there?'\n\n'It goes against the grain with me, then,' said Mr Plomacy. 'And\ntake care, you Stubbs, and behave yourself. If I hear a row, I\nshall know where it comes from. I'm up to you Barchester\njourneymen; I know what stuff you're made of.'\n\nAnd so Stubbs went off happy, pulling at the forelock of his shock\nhead of hair in honour of the steward's clemency, and giving\nanother double pull at it in honour of the farmer's kindness. And\nas he went he swore within his grateful heart, that if ever Farmer\nGreenacre wanted a day's work done for nothing, he was the lad to\ndo it for him. Which promise it was not probable that he would ever\nbe called upon to perform.\n\nBut Mr Plomacy was not quite happy in his mind for he thought of\nthe unjust steward, and began to reflect whether he had not made\nfor himself friends at the mammon of unrighteousness. This,\nhowever, did not interfere with the manner in which he performed\nhis duties at the bottom of the long board; nor did Mr Greenacre\nperform his the worse at the top on account of the good wishes of\nStubbs the plasterer. Moreover, the guests did not think it\nanything amiss when Mr Plomacy, rising to say grace, prayed that\nGod would make them all truly thankful for the good things which\nMadam Thorne in her great liberality had set out before them!\n\nAll this time the quality in the tent on the lawn were getting on\nswimmingly; that is, champagne without restrictions can enable\nquality fold to swim. Sir Harkaway Gorse proposed the health of\nMiss Thorne, and likened her to a blood race-horse, always in\ncondition, and not to be tired down by any amount of work. Mr\nThorne returned thanks, saying he hoped his sister would always be\nfound able to run when called upon, and than gave the health and\nprosperity of the De Courcy family. His sister was very much\nhonoured by seeing so many of them at her poor board. They were all\naware that important avocations made the absence of the earl\nnecessary. As his duty to his prince had called him from his family\nhearth he, Mr Thorne, could not venture to regret that he did not\nsee him at Ullathorne; but nevertheless he would venture to\nsay--And so Mr Thorne became somewhat gravelled as a country\ngentleman in similar circumstances usually do; but he ultimately\nsat down, declaring that he had much satisfaction in drinking the\nnoble earl's health, together with that of the countess, and all\nthe family of De Courcy castle.\n\nAnd then the Honourable George returned thanks. We will not follow\nhim through the different periods of his somewhat irregular\neloquence. Those immediately in his neighbourhood found it at first\nrather difficult to get him to his legs, but much greater\ndifficulty was soon experience in inducing him to resume his seat.\nOne of two arrangements should certainly be made in these days:\neither let all speech-making on festive occasions be utterly\ntabooed and made as it were impossible; or else let those who are\nto exercise the privilege be first subjected to a competing\nexamination before the civil service examining commissioners. As it\nis now, the Honourable Georges do but little honour to our\nexertions in favour of British education.\n\nIn the dining-room the bishop went through the honours of the day\nwith much more neatness and propriety. He also drank Miss Thorne's\nhealth, and did it in a manner becoming the bench which he adorned.\nThe party there, was perhaps a little more dull, a shade less\nlively than that in the tent.\n\nBut what was lost in mirth, was fully made up in decorum.\n\nAnd so the banquet passed off at the various tables with great\neclat and universal delight.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL\n\nULLATHORNE SPORTS--ACT II\n\n'That which has made them drunk, has made me bold.' 'Twas thus that\nMr Slope encouraged himself, as he left the dining-room in pursuit\nof Eleanor. He had not indeed seen in that room any person really\nintoxicated; but there had been a good deal of wine drunk, and Mr\nSlope had not hesitated to take his share, in order to screw\nhimself up to the undertaking which he had in hand. He is not the\nfirst man who has thought it expedient to call in the assistance of\nBacchus on such an occasion.\n\nEleanor was out through the window, and on the grass before she\nperceived that she was followed. Just at that moment the guests\nwere nearly all occupied at the tables. Here and there were to be\nseen a constant couple or two, who preferred their own sweet\ndiscourse to the jingle of glasses, or the charms of rhetoric which\nfell from the mouths of the Honourable George and the bishop of\nBarchester; but the grounds were as nearly vacant as Mr Slope could\nwish them to be.\n\nEleanor saw that she was pursued, and as a deer, when escape is no\nlonger possible, will turn to bay and attack the hounds, so did she\nturn upon Mr Slope.\n\n'Pray don't let me take you from the room,' said she, speaking with\nall the stiffness which she know how to use. 'I have come out to\nlook for a friend. I must beg of you, Mr Slope, to go back.'\n\nBut Mr Slope would not be thus entreated. He had observed all day\nthat Mrs Bold was not cordial to him, and this had to a certain\nextent oppressed him. But he did not deduce from this any assurance\nthat his aspirations were in vain. He saw that she was angry with\nhim. Might she not be so because he had so long tampered with her\nfeelings,--might it not arise from his having, as he knew to be the\ncase, caused her name to be bruited about in conjunction with his\nown, without having given her the opportunity of confessing to the\nworld that henceforth their names were to be the one and the same?\n\nPoor lady! He had within him a certain Christian\nconscience-stricken feeling of remorse on this head. It might be\nthat he had wronged her by his tardiness. He had, however, at the\npresent moment imbibed too much of Mr Thorne's champagne to have\nany inward misgivings. He was right in repeating the boast of Lady\nMacbeth: he was not drunk; but he was bold enough for anything. It\nwas a pity that in such a state he could not have encountered Mrs\nProudie.\n\n'You must permit me to attend you,' said he; 'I could not think of\nallowing you to go alone.'\n\n'Indeed you must, Mr Slope,' said Eleanor still very stiffly; 'for\nit is my special wish to be alone.'\n\nThe time for letting the great secret escape him had already come.\nMr Slope saw that it must be now or never, and he was determined\nthat it should be now. This was not his first attempt at winning a\nfair lady. He had been on his knees, looked unutterable things with\nhis eyes, and whispered honeyed words before this. Indeed he was\nsomewhat an adept at these things, and had only to adapt to the\nperhaps different taste of Mrs Bold the well-remembered rhapsodies\nwhich had once so much gratified Olivia Proudie.\n\n'Do not ask me to leave you, Mrs Bold,' said he with an impassioned\nlook, impassioned and sanctified as well, with that sort of look\nwhich is not uncommon with gentlemen of Mr Slope's school, and\nwhich may perhaps be called the tender-pious. 'Do not ask me to\nleave you, till I have spoken a few words with which my heart is\nfull; which I have come hither purposely to say.'\n\nEleanor saw how it was now. She knew directly what it was she was\nabout to go through, and very miserable the knowledge made her. Of\ncourse she could refuse Mr Slope, and there would be an end of\nthat, one might say. But there was not an end of it as far as\nEleanor was concerned. The very fact of Mr Slope's making an offer\nto her would be a triumph for the archdeacon, and in a great\nmeasure a vindication of Mr Arabin's conduct. The widow could not\nbring herself to endure with patience the idea that she had been in\nthe wrong.\n\nShe had defended Mr Slope, she had declared herself quite justified\nin admitting him among her acquaintance, had ridiculed the idea of\nhis considering himself as more than an acquaintance, and had\nresented the archdeacon's caution in her behalf: now it was about\nto be proved to her in a manner sufficiently disagreeable that the\narchdeacon had been right, and she herself had been entirely wrong.\n\n'I don't know what you can have to say to me, Mr Slope, that you\ncould not have said when we were sitting at table just now;' and\nshe closed her lips, and steadied her eyeballs and looked at him in\na manner that ought to have frozen him.\n\nBut gentlemen are not easily frozen when they are full of\nchampagne, and it would not at any time have been easy to freeze Mr\nSlope.\n\n'There are things, Mrs Bold, which a man cannot well say before a\ncrowd; which perhaps he cannot well say at any time; which indeed\nhe may most fervently desire to get spoken, and which he may yet\nfind it almost impossible to utter. It is such things as these,\nthat I now wish to say to you;' and then the tender-pious look was\nrepeated, with a little more emphasis even than before.\n\nEleanor had not found it practicable to stand stock still before\nthe dining-room window, and there receive his offer in full view of\nMiss Thorne's guests. She had therefore in self-defence walked on,\nand Mr Slope had gained his object of walking with her. He now\noffered her his arm.\n\n'Thank you, Mr Slope, I am much obliged to you; but for the very\nshort time that I shall remain with you I shall prefer walking\nalone.'\n\n'And must it be so short?' said he; 'must it be--'\n\n'Yes,' said Eleanor, interrupting him; 'as short as possible, if\nyou please, sir.'\n\n'I had hoped, Mrs Bold--I had hoped--' 'Pray hope nothing, Mr\nSlope, as far as I am concerned; pray do not; I do not know, and\nneed not know what hope you mean. Our acquaintance is very slight,\nand will probably remain so. Pray, pray, let that be enough; there\nis at any rage no necessity for us to quarrel.'\n\nMrs Bold was certainly treating Mr Slope rather cavalierly, and he\nfelt it so. She was rejecting him before he had offered himself,\nand informed him at the same time that he was taking a great deal\ntoo much on himself to be so familiar. She did not even make an\nattempt\n\n>From such a sharp and waspish word as 'no' To pluck the string.\n\nHe was still determined to be very tender and very pious, seeing\nthat in spite of all Mrs Bold had said to him, he not yet abandoned\nhope; but he was inclined to be somewhat angry. The widow was\nbearing herself, as he thought, with too high a hand, was speaking\nof herself in much too imperious a tone. She had clearly no idea\nthat an honour was being conferred on her. Mr Slope would be tender\nas long as he could, but he began to think, if that failed, it\nwould not be amiss if he also mounted himself for a while on his\nhigh horse. Mr Slope could undoubtedly be very tender, but he could\nbe very savage also, and he knew his own abilities.\n\n'That is cruel,' said he, 'and unchristian too. The worst of us are\nall still bidden to hope. What have I done that you should pass on\nme so severe a sentence?' and then he paused a moment, during which\nthe widow walked steadily on with measured step, saying nothing\nfurther.\n\n'Beautiful woman,' at last he burst forth, 'beautiful woman, you\ncannot pretend to be ignorant that I adore you. Yes, Eleanor, yes,\nI love you. I love you with the truest affection which man can bear\nto woman. Next to my hopes of heaven are my hopes of possessing\nyou.' (Mr Slope's memory here played him false, or he would not\nhave omitted the deanery) 'How sweet to walk to heaven with you by\nmy side, with you for my guide, mutual guides. Say, Eleanor,\ndearest Eleanor, shall we walk that sweet path together?'\n\nEleanor had no intention of ever walking together with Mr Slope on\nany other path than the special one of Miss Thorne's which they now\noccupied; but as she had been unable to prevent the expression of\nMr Slope's wishes and aspirations, she resolved to hear him out to\nthe end, before she answered him.\n\n'Ah! Eleanor,' he continued, and it seemed to be his idea, that as\nhe had once found courage to pronounce her Christian name, he could\nnot utter it often enough. 'Ah! Eleanor, will it not be sweet with\nthe Lord's assistance, to travel hand in hand through this mortal\nvalley which his mercies will make pleasant to us, till hereafter\nwe shall dwell together at the foot of his throne?' And then a more\ntenderly pious glance ever beamed from the lover's eyes. 'Ah!\nEleanor--'\n\n'My name, Mr Slope, is Mrs Bold,' said Eleanor, who, though\ndetermined to hear out the tale of his love, was too much disgusted\nby his blasphemy to be able to bear much more of it.\n\n'Sweetest angel, be not so cold,' said he, and as he said it the\nchampagne broke forth, and he contrived to pass his arm around her\nwaist. He did this with considerable cleverness, for up to this\npoint Eleanor had contrived with tolerable success to keep her\ndistance from him. They had got into a walk nearly enveloped by\nshrubs, and Mr Slope therefore no doubt considered that as they\nwere now alone it was fitting that he should give her some outward\ndemonstration of that affection of which he talked so much. It may\nperhaps be presumed that the same stamp of measures had been found\nto succeed with Olivia Proudie. Be this as it may, it was not\nsuccessful with Eleanor Bold.\n\nShe sprang from him as she would have jumped from an adder, but she\ndid not spring far; not, indeed, beyond arm's length; and then,\nquick as thought, she raised her little hand and dealt him a box on\nthe ear with such right good will, that it sounded among the trees\nlike a miniature thunder-clap.\n\nAnd now it is to be feared that every well-bred reader of these\npages will lay down the book with disgust, feeling that, after all,\nthe heroine is unworthy of sympathy. She is a hoyden, one will say.\nAt any rate she is not a lady, another will exclaim. I have\nsuspected her all through, a third will declare; and she has no\nidea of the dignity of a matron; or of the peculiar propriety which\nher position demands. At one moment she is romping with young\nStanhope; then she is making eyes at Mr Arabin; anon she comes to\nfisty-cuffs with a third lover; and all before she is yet a widow\nof two years' standing.\n\nShe cannot altogether be defended; and yet it may be averred that\nshe is not a hoyden, not given to romping, nor prone to boxing. It\nwere to be wished devoutly that she had not struck Mr Slope in the\nface. In doing so she derogated from her dignity and committed\nherself. Had she been educated in Belgravia, had she been brought\nup by any sterner mentor than that fond father, had she lived\nlonger under the rule of a husband, she might, perhaps, have saved\nherself from this great fault. As it was, the provocation was too\nmuch for her, the temptation to instant resentment of the insult\ntoo strong. She was too keen in the feeling of independence, a\nfeeling dangerous for a young woman, but one in which her position\npeculiarly tempted her to indulge. And then Mr Slope's face, tinted\nwith a deeper dye than usual by the wine he had drunk, simpering\nand puckering itself with pseudo piety and tender grimaces, seemed\nspecially to call for such punishment. She had, too, a true\ninstinct as to the man; he was capable of rebuke in this way and in\nno other. To him the blow from her little hand was as much an\ninsult as a blow from a man would have been to another. It went\ndirectly to his pride. He conceived himself lowered in his dignity,\nand personally outraged. He could almost have struck at her again\nin his rage. Even the pain was a great annoyance to him, and the\nfeeling that his clerical character had been wholly disregarded,\nsorely vexed him.\n\nThere are such men; men who can endure no taint on their personal\nself-respect, even from a woman;--men whose bodies are to\nthemselves such sacred temples, that a joke against them is\ndesecration, and a rough touch downright sacrilege. Mr Slope was\nsuch a man; and, therefore, the slap on that face that he got from\nEleanor was, as far as he was concerned, the fittest rebuke which\ncould have been administered to him.\n\nBut, nevertheless, she should not have raised her hand against the\nman. Ladies' hands so soft, so sweet, so delicious to the touch, so\ngrateful to the eye, so gracious in their gentle doings, were not\nmade to belabour men's faces. The moment the deed was done, Eleanor\nfelt that she had sinned against all propriety, and would have\ngiven little worlds to recall the blow. In her first agony of\nsorrow she all but begged the man's pardon. Her next impulse,\nhowever, and the one which she obeyed, was to run away.\n\n'I never, never, will speak another word to you,' she said, gasping\nwith emotion and the loss of breath, which her exertion and violent\nfeelings occasioned her, and so saying she put foot to the ground\nand ran quickly back along the path to the house.\n\nBut how shall I sing the divine wrath of Mr Slope, or how invoke\nthe tragic muse to describe the rage which swelled the celestial\nbosom of the bishop's chaplain? Such an undertaking by no means\nbefits the low-heeled buskin of modern fiction. The painter put a\nveil over Agamemnon's face when called on to depict the father's\ngrief at the early doom of his devoted daughter. The god, when he\nresolved to punish the rebellions winds, abstained from mouthing\nempty threats. The god when he resolved to punish the rebellious\nwinds, abstained from mouthing empty threats.\n\nWe will not attempt to tell with what mighty surging of the inner\nheart Mr Slope swore to revenge himself on the woman who had\ndisgraced him, nor will we vainly strive to depict the deep agony\nof his soul.\n\nThere he is, however, alone on the garden walk, and we must\ncontrive to bring him out of it. He was not willing to come forth\nquite at once. His cheek was stinging with the weight of Eleanor's\nfingers, and he fancied that every one who looked at him would be\nable to see on his face the traces of what he had endured. He stood\nawhile, becoming redder and redder with rage. He stood motionless,\nundecided, glaring with his eyes, thinking of the pains and\npenalties of Hades, and meditating how he might best devote his\nenemy to the infernal gods with all the passion of his accustomed\neloquence. He longed in his heart to be preaching at her. 'Twas\nthus that he was ordinarily avenged of sinning mortal men and\nwomen. Could he at once have ascended his Sunday rostrum and\nfulminated at her such denunciations as his spirit delighted in,\nhis bosom would have been greatly eased.\n\nBut how preach to Mr Thorne's laurels, or how preach indeed at all\nin such a vanity fair as this now going on at Ullathorne? And then\nhe began to feel a righteous disgust at the wickedness of the\ndoings around him. He had been justly chastised for lending, by his\npresence, a sanction to such worldly lures. The gaiety of society,\nthe mirth of banquets, the laughter of the young, and the eating\nand drinking of the elders were, for awhile, without excuse in his\nsight. What had he now brought down upon himself by sojourning thus\nin the tents of the heathen? He had consorted with idolaters round\nthe altars of Baal; and therefore a sore punishment had come upon\nhim. He then thought of the Signora Neroni, and his soul within him\nwas full of sorrow. He had an inkling--a true inkling--that he was\na wicked sinful man; but it led him in no right direction; he could\nadmit no charity in his heart. He felt debasement coming on him,\nand he longed to take it off, to rise up in his stirrup, to mount\nto high places and great power, that he might get up into a mighty\npulpit and preach to the world a loud sermon against Mrs Bold.\n\nThere he stood fixed to the gravel for about ten minutes. Fortune\nfavoured him so far that no prying eyes came to look upon him in\nhis misery. Then a shudder passed over his whole frame; he\ncollected himself, and slowly wound his way round to the lawn,\nadvancing along the path and not returning in the direction which\nEleanor had taken. When he reached the tent he found the bishop\nstanding there in conversation with the master of Lazarus. His\nlordship had come out to air himself afer the exertion of his\nspeech.\n\n'This is very pleasant--very pleasant, my lord, is it not?' said Mr\nSlope with his most gracious smile, and pointing to the tent; 'very\npleasant. It is delightful to see so many persons enjoying\nthemselves so thoroughly.'\n\nMr Slope thought he might force the bishop to introduce him to Dr\nGwynne. A very great example had declared and practised the wisdom\nof being everything to everybody, and Mr Slope was desirous of\nfollowing it. His maxim was never to lose a chance. The bishop,\nhowever, at the present moment was not very anxious to increase Mr\nSlope's circle of acquaintance among his clerical brethren. He had\nhis own reasons for dropping any marked allusion to his domestic\nchaplain, and he therefore made his shoulder rather cold for the\noccasion.\n\n'Very, very,' said he without turning round, or even deigning to\nlook at Mr Slope. 'And therefore, Dr Gwynne, I really think that\nyou will find that the hebdomadal board will exercise as wide and\nas general an authority as at the present moment. I, for one, Dr\nGwynne--'\n\n'Dr Gwynne,' said Mr Slope, raising his hat, and resolving not to\nbe outwitted by such an insignificant little goose as the bishop of\nBarchester.\n\nThe master of Lazarus also raised his hat and bowed very politely\nto Mr Slope. There is not a more courteous gentleman in the queen's\ndominions than the master of Lazarus.\n\n'My lord,' said Mr Slope, 'pray do me the honour of introducing me\nto Dr Gwynne. The opportunity is too much in my favour to be lost.'\n\nThe bishop had no help for it. 'My chaplain, Dr Gwynne,' said he;\n'my present chaplain, Mr Slope.' he certainly made the introduction\nas unsatisfactory to the chaplain as possible, and by the use of\nthe word present, seemed to indicate that Mr Slope might probably\nnot long enjoy the honour which he now held. But Mr Slope cared\nnothing for this. He understood the innuendo, and disregarded it.\nIt might probably come to pass that he would be in a situation to\nresign his chaplaincy before the bishop was in a situation to\ndismiss him from it. What need the future dean of Barchester care\nfor the bishop, or for the bishop's wife? Had not Mr Slope, just as\nhe was entering Dr Stanhope's carriage, received an important note\nfrom Tom Towers of the Jupiter? Had he not that note this moment in\nhis pocket?\n\nSo disregarding the bishop, he began to open out a conversation\nwith the master of Lazarus.\n\nBut suddenly and interruption came, not altogether unwelcome to Mr\nSlope. One of the bishop's servants came up to his master's\nshoulder with a long, grave face, and whispered into the bishop's\near.\n\n'What is it, John?' said the bishop.\n\n'The dean, my lord; he is dead.'\n\nMr Slope had no further desire to converse with the master of\nLazarus, and was very soon on his road back to Barchester.\n\nEleanor, as we have said, having declared her intention of never\nholding further communication with Mr Slope, ran hurriedly back\ntowards the house. The thought, however, of what she had done\ngrieved her greatly, and she could not abstain from bursting into\ntears. 'Twas thus she played the second act in that day's\nmelodrama.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI\n\nMRS BOLD CONFIDES HER SORROW TO HER FRIEND MISS STANHOPE\n\nWhen Mrs Bold came to the end of the walk and faced the lawn, she\nbegan to bethink herself what she should do. Was she to wait there\ntill Mr Slope caught her, or was she to go in among the crowd with\ntears in her eyes and passion in her face? She might in truth have\nstood there long enough without any reasonable fear of further\nimmediate persecution from Mr Slope; but we are all inclined to\nmagnify the bugbears which frighten us. In her present state of\ndread she did not know of what atrocity he might venture to be\nguilty. Had any one told her a week ago that he would have put his\narm around her waist at the party of Miss Thorne's she would have\nbeen utterly incredulous. Had she been informed that he would be\nseen on the following Sunday walking down the High Street in a\nscarlet coat and top-boots, she would not have thought such a\nphenomenon more improbable.\n\nBut this improbable iniquity he had committed; and now there was\nnothing she could not believe of him. In the first place it was\nquite manifest that he was tipsy; in the next place, it was to be\ntaken as proved that all his religion was sheer hypocrisy; and\nfinally the man was utterly shameless. She therefore stood watching\nfor the sound of his footfall, not without some fear that he might\ncreep out at her suddenly from among the bushes.\n\nAs she thus stood, she saw Charlotte Stanhope at a little distance\nfrom her walking quickly across the grass. Eleanor's handkerchief\nwas in her hand, and putting it to her face so as to conceal her\ntears, she ran across the lawn and joined her friend.\n\n'Oh, Charlotte,' she said, almost too much out of breath to speak\nvery plainly; 'I am so glad I have found you.'\n\n'Glad you have found me!' said Charlotte, laughing, 'that's a good\njoke. Why Bertie and I have been looking for you everywhere. He\nswears that you have gone off with Mr Slope, and is now on the\npoint of hanging himself.'\n\n'Oh, Charlotte, don't,' said Mrs Bold.\n\n'Why, my child, what on earth is the matter with you!' said Miss\nStanhope, perceiving that Eleanor's hand trembled on her own arm,\nand finding also that her companion was still half choked with\ntears. 'Goodness heaven! Something has distressed you. What is it?\nWhat can I do for you?'\n\nEleanor answered her only by a sort of spasmodic gurgle in her\nthroat. She was a good deal upset, as people say, and could not at\nthe moment collect herself.\n\n'Come here, this way, Mrs Bold; come this way, and we shall not be\nseen. What has happened to vex you so? What can I do for you? Can\nBertie do anything?'\n\n'On, no, no, no, no,' said Eleanor. 'There is nothing to be done.\nOnly that horrid man--'\n\n'What horrid man?' asked Charlotte.\n\nThere are some moments in life in which both men and women feel\nthemselves called on to make a confidence; in which not to do so\nrequires a disagreeable resolution and also a disagreeable\nsuspicion. There are people of both sexes who never make\nconfidences; who are never tempted by momentary circumstances to\ndisclose their secrets. But such are generally dull, close,\nunimpassioned spirits, 'gloomy gnomes who live in cold dark mines.'\nThere was nothing of the gnome about Eleanor; and she therefore\nresolved to tell Charlotte Stanhope the whole story about Mr Slope.\n\n'That horrid man; that Mr Slope,' said she, 'did you not see that\nhe followed me out of the dining-room?'\n\n'Of course I did and was sorry enough; but I could not help it. I\nknew you would be annoyed. But you and Bertie managed it badly\nbetween you.'\n\n'It was not his fault nor mine either. You know how I dislike the\nidea of coming in the carriage with that man.'\n\n'I am sure I am very sorry if that has led to it.'\n\n'I don't know what has led to it,' said Eleanor, almost crying\nagain. 'But it has not been my fault.'\n\n'But what has he done, my dear?'\n\n'He's an abominable, horrid, hypocritical man, and it would serve\nhim right to tell the bishop about it.'\n\n'Believe me, if you want to do him an injury, you had far better\ntell Mrs Proudie. But what did he do, Mrs Bold?'\n\n'Ugh!' exclaimed Eleanor.\n\n'Well, I must confess he's not very nice,' said Charlotte Stanhope.\n\n'Nice!' said Eleanor. 'He is the most fulsome, fawning, abominable\nman I ever saw. What business had he to come to me?--I that never\ngave him the slightest tittle of encouragement--I that always hated\nhim, though I did take his part when others ran him down.'\n\n'That's just where it is, my dear. He has heard that, and therefore\nfancied that of course you were in love with him.'\n\nThis was wormwood to Eleanor. It was in fact the very thing which\nall her friends had been saying for the last month past; and which\nexperience now proved to be true. Eleanor resolved within herself\nthat she would never again take any man's part. The world with all\nits villainy, and all its ill-nature, might wag as it like; she\nwould not again attempt to set crooked things straight.\n\n'But what did he do, my dear?' said Charlotte, who was really\nrather interested in the subject.\n\n'He--he--he--'\n\n'Well--come, it can't have been anything so very horrid, for the\nman was not tipsy.'\n\n'Oh, I am sure he was,' said Eleanor. 'I am sure he must have been\ntipsy.'\n\n'Well, I declare I didn't observe it. But what was it, my love?'\n\n'Why, I believe I can hardly tell you. He talked such horrid stuff\nthat you never heard the like; about religion, and heaven, and\nlove--Oh dear,--he is such a nasty man.'\n\n'I can really imagine the sort of stuff he would talk. Well--and\nthen?'\n\n'And then--he took hold of me.'\n\n'Took hold of you?'\n\n'Yes--he somehow got close to me, and took hold of me--'\n\n'By the waist?'\n\n'Yes,' said Eleanor shuddering.\n\n'And then--'\n\n'Then I jumped away from him, and gave him a slap on the face; and\nran away along the path, till I saw you.'\n\n'Ha, ha, ha!' Charlotte Stanhope laughed heartily at the finale of\nthe tragedy. It was delightful to her to think that Mr Slope had\nhad his ears boxed. She did not quite appreciate the feeling which\nmade her friend so unhappy at the result of the interview. To her\nthinking, the matter had ended happily enough as regarded the\nwidow, who indeed was entitled to some sort of triumph among her\nfriends. Whereas Mr Slope would be due all those jibes and jeers\nwhich would naturally follow such an affair. His friends would ask\nhim whether his ears tingled whenever he saw a widow; and he would\nbe cautioned that beautiful things were made to be looked at, and\nnot to be touched.\n\nSuch were Charlotte Stanhope's views on such matters; but she did\nnot at the present moment clearly explain them to Mrs Bold. Her\nobject was to endear herself to her friend; and therefore, having\nhad her laugh, she was ready enough to offer sympathy. Could Bertie\ndo anything? Should Bertie speak to the man, and warn him that in\nfuture he must behave with more decorum? Bertie, indeed, she\ndeclared, would be more angry than any one else when he heard to\nwhat insult Mrs Bold had been subjected.\n\n'But you won't tell him?' said Mrs Bold with a look of horror.\n\n'Not if you don't like it,' said Charlotte; 'but considering\neverything, I would strongly advise it. If you had a brother, you\nknow, it would be unnecessary. But it is very right that Mr Slope\nshould know that you have somebody by you that will, and can\nprotect you.'\n\n'But my father is here.'\n\n'Yes, but it is so disagreeable for clergymen to have to quarrel\nwith each other; and circumstanced as your father is just at this\nmoment, it would be very inexpedient that there should be anything\nunpleasant between him and Mr Slope. Surely you and Bertie are\nintimate enough for you to permit him to take your part.'\n\nCharlotte Stanhope was very anxious that her brother should at once\non that very day settle matters with his future wife.\n\nThings had now come to that point between him and his father, and\nbetween him and his creditors, that he must either do so, or leave\nBarchester; either do that, or go back to his unwashed associates,\ndirty lodgings, and poor living at Carrara. Unless he could provide\nhimself with an income, he must go to Carrara or to -. His father\nthe prebendary had not said this in so many words, but had he done\nso, he could not have signified it more plainly.\n\nSuch being the state of the case, it was very necessary that no\nmore time should be lost. Charlotte had seen her brother's apathy,\nwhen he neglected to follow Mrs Bold out of the room, with anger\nwhich she could hardly suppress. It was grievous to think that Mr\nSlope should have so distanced him.\n\nCharlotte felt that she had played her part with sufficient skill.\nShe had brought them together and induced such a degree of\nintimacy, that her brother was really relieved from all trouble and\nlabour in the matter. And moreover, it was quite plain that Mrs\nBold was very fond of Bertie. And now it was plain enough also that\nhe had nothing to fear from his rival Mr Slope.\n\nThere was certainly an awkwardness in subjecting Mrs Bold to a\nsecond offer on the same day. It would have been well, perhaps, to\nhave put the matter off for a week, could a week have been spared.\nBut circumstances are frequently too peremptory to be arranged as\nwe would wish to arrange them; and such was the case now. This\nbeing so, could not this affair of Mr Slope's be turned to\nadvantage? Could it not be made the excuse for bringing Bertie and\nMrs Bold into still closer connection; into such close connection\nthat they could not fail to throw themselves into each other's\narms? Such was the game which Miss Stanhope now at a moment's\nnotice resolved to play.\n\nAnd very well she played it. In the first place, it was arranged\nthat Mr Slope should not return in the Stanhope's carriage to\nBarchester. It so happened that Mr Slope was already gone, but of\nthat of course they knew nothing. The signora should be induced to\ngo first, with only the servants and her sister, and Bertie should\ntake Mr Slope's place in the second journey. Bertie was to be told\nin confidence of the whole affair, and when the carriage was gone\noff with the first load, Eleanor was to be left under Bertie's\nspecial protection, so as to insure her from any further aggression\nfrom Mr Slope. While the carriage was getting ready, Bertie was to\nseek out that gentleman and make him understand that he must\nprovide himself with another conveyance back to Barchester. Their\nimmediate object should be to walk about together in search of\nBertie. Bertie, in short, was to be the Pegasus on whose wings they\nwere to ride out of their present dilemma.\n\nThere was a warmth of friendship and cordial kindness in all this,\nthat was very soothing to the widow; but yet, though she gave way\nto it, she was hardly reconciled to doing so. It never occurred to\nher, that now that she had killed one dragon, another was about to\nspring up in her path; she had no remote idea that she would have\nto encounter another suitor in her proposed protector, but she\nhardly liked the idea of putting herself so much into the hands of\nyoung Stanhope. She felt that if she wanted protection, she should\ngo to her father. She felt that she should ask him to provide a\ncarriage for her back to Barchester. Mrs Clantantram she knew would\ngive her a seat. She knew that she should not throw herself\nentirely upon friends whose friendship dated as it were but from\nyesterday. But yet she could not say, 'no,' to one who was so\nsisterly in her kindness, so eager in her good nature, so\ncomfortably sympathetic as Charlotte Stanhope.\n\nThey first went into the dining-room, looking for their champion,\nand from thence to the drawing-room. Here they found Mr Arabin,\nstill hanging over the signora's sofa; or, rather, they found him\nsitting near her head, as a physician might have sat, had the lady\nbeen his patient. There was no other person in the room. The guests\nwere some in the tent, some few still in the dining-room, some at\nthe bows and arrows, but most of them walking with Miss Thorne\nthrough the park, and looking at the games that were going on.\n\nAll that had passed, and was passing between Mr Arabin and the\nlady, it is unnecessary to give in detail. She was doing with him\nas she did with all others. It was her mission to make fools of\nmen, and she was pursuing her mission with Mr Arabin. She had\nalmost got him to own his love for Mrs Bold, and had subsequently\nalmost induced him to acknowledge a passion for herself. He, poor\nman, was hardly aware what he was doing or saying, hardly conscious\nwhether he was in heaven or hell. So little had he known of female\nattractions of that peculiar class which the signora owned, that he\nbecame affected with a temporary delirium, when first subjected to\nits power. He lost his head rather than his heart, and toppled\nabout mentally, reeling in his ideas as a drunken man does on his\nlegs. She had whispered to him words that really meant nothing, but\nwhich coming from such beautiful lips, and accompanied by such\nlustrous glances, seemed to have a mysterious significance, which\nhe felt though he could not understand.\n\nIn being thus be-sirened, Mr Arabin behaved himself very\ndifferently from Mr Slope. The signora had said truly, that the two\nmen were the contrasts of each other; that the one was all for\naction, the other all for thought. Mr Slope, when this lady laid\nupon his senses the overpowering breath of her charms, immediately\nattempted to obtain some fruition, to achieve some mighty triumph.\nHe began by catching at her hand, and progressed by kissing it. He\nmade vows of love, and asked for vows in return. He promised\neverlasting devotion, knelt before her, and swore that had she been\non Mount Ida, Juno would have no cause to hate the offspring of\nVenus. But Mr Arabin uttered no oaths, kept his hand mostly in his\ntrousers pocket, and had no more thought of kissing Madam Neroni\nthan of kissing the Countess De Courcy.\n\nAs soon as Mr Arabin saw Mrs Bold enter the room, he blushed and\nrose from his chair; then he sat down again, and then again got up.\nThe signora saw the blush at once, and smiled at the poor victim,\nbut Eleanor was too much confused to see anything.\n\n'Oh, Madeline,' said Charlotte, 'I want to speak to you\nparticularly; we must arrange about the carriage, you know,' and\nshe stooped down to whisper to her sister. Mr Arabin immediately\nwithdrew to a little distance, and as Charlotte had in fact much to\nexplain before she could make the new arrangement intelligible, he\nhad nothing to do but to talk to Mrs Bold.\n\n'We have had a very pleasant party,' said he, using the tone he\nwould have used had he declared that the sun was shining very\nbrightly, or the rain was falling very fast.\n\n'Very,' said Eleanor, who never in her life had passed a more\nunpleasant day.\n\n'I hope Mr Harding has enjoyed himself.'\n\n'Oh, yes, very much,' said Eleanor, who had not seen her father\nsince she parted from him soon after her arrival.\n\n'He returns to Barchester to-night, I suppose.'\n\n'Yes, I believe so; that is, I think he is staying at Plumstead.'\n\n'Oh, staying at Plumstead,' said Mr Arabin.\n\n'He came from there this morning. I believe he is going back; he\ndidn't exactly say, however.'\n\n'I hope Mrs Grantly is quite well.'\n\n'She seemed to be quite well. She is here; that is, unless she has\ngone away.'\n\n'Oh, yes, to be sure. I was talking to her. Looking very well\nindeed.' Then there was a considerable pause: for Charlotte could\nnot at once make Madeline understand why she was to be sent home in\na hurry without her brother.\n\n'Are you returning to Plumstead, Mrs Bold?' Mr Arabin merely asked\nthis by way of making conversation, but he immediately perceived\nthat he was approaching dangerous ground.\n\n'No,' said Mrs Bold, very quietly; 'I am going home to Barchester.'\n\n'Oh, ah, yes. I had forgotten that you had returned.' And then Mr\nArabin, finding it impossible to say anything further, stood silent\ntill Charlotte had completed her plans, and Mrs Bold stood equally\nsilent, intently occupied as it appeared in the arrangement of her\nrings.\n\nAnd yet these two people were thoroughly in love with each other;\nand though one was a middle-aged clergyman, and the other a lady at\nany rate past the wishy-washy bread-and-butter period of life, they\nwere as unable to tell their own minds to each other as any Damon\nand Phillis, whose united ages would not make up that to which Mr\nArabin had already attained.\n\nMadeline Neroni consented to her sister's proposal, and then the\ntwo ladies again went off in quest of Bertie Stanhope.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII\n\nULLATHORNE SPORTS--ACT III\n\nAnd now Miss Thorne's guests were beginning to take their\ndeparture, and the amusement of those who remained was becoming\nslack. It was getting dark, and ladies in morning costumes were\nthinking that if they were to appear by candle-light they ought to\nreadjust themselves. Some young gentlemen had been heard to talk so\nloud that prudent mammas determined to retire judiciously, and the\nmore discreet of the male sex, whose libation had been moderate,\nfelt that there was not much more left for them to do.\n\nMorning parties, as a rule, are failures. People never know how to\nget away from them gracefully. A picnic on an island or a mountain\nor in a wood may perhaps be permitted. There is no master of the\nmountain bound by courtesy to bid you stay while in his heart he is\nlonging for your departure. But in a private home or in private\ngrounds a morning party is a bore. One is called on to eat and\ndrink at unnatural hours. One is obliged to give up the day which\nis useful, and is then left without resources for the evening which\nis useless. One gets home fagged and desouvre, and yet at an hour\ntoo early for bed. There is not comfortable resource left. Cards in\nthese genteel days are among the things tabooed, and a rubber of\nwhist is impracticable.\n\nAll this began now to be felt. Some young people had come with some\namount of hope that they might get up a dance in the evening, and\nwere unwilling to leave till all such hope was at an end. Others,\nfearful of staying longer than was expected, had ordered their\ncarriages early, and were doing their best to go, solicitous for\ntheir servants and horses. The countess and her noble brood were\namong the first to leave, and as regarded the Hon. George, it was\ncertainly time that he did so. Her ladyship was in a great fret and\nfume. Those horrid roads would, she was sure, be the death of her\nif unhappily she were caught in them by the dark of night. The\nlamps she was assured were good, but no lamp could withstand the\njolting of the roads of East Barsetshire.\n\nThe De Courcy property lay in the western division of the county.\n\nMrs Proudie could not stay when the countess was gone. So the\nbishop was searched for by the Revs. Messrs. Grey and Green, and\nfound in one corner of the tent enjoying himself thoroughly in a\ndisquisition on the hebdomadal board. He obeyed, however, the\nbehests of the lady without finishing the sentence in which he was\npromising to Dr Gwynne that his authority at Oxford should remain\nunimpaired; and the episcopal horses turned their noses towards the\npalatial stables. Then the Grantlys went. Before they did so Mr\nHarding managed to whisper a word into his daughter's ear. Of\ncourse, he said, he would undeceive the Grantlys as to that foolish\nrumour about Mr Slope.\n\n'No, no, no,' said Eleanor; 'pray do not--pray wait till I see you.\nYou will be home in a day or two, and then I will explain to you\neverything.'\n\n'I shall be home to-morrow,' said he.\n\n'I am so glad,' said Eleanor. 'You will come and dine with me, and\nthen we shall be so comfortable.'\n\nMr Harding promised. He did not exactly know what there was to be\nexplained, or why Dr Grantly's mind should not be disabused of the\nmistake into which he had fallen; but nevertheless he promised. He\nowed some reparation to his daughter, and he thought that he might\nbest make it by obedience.\n\nAnd thus the people were thinning off by degrees, as Charlotte and\nEleanor walked about in quest of Bertie. Their search might have\nbeen long, had they not happened to hear his voice. He was\ncomfortably ensconced in the ha-ha, with his back to the sloping\nside, smoking a cigar, and eagerly engaged in conversation with\nsome youngster from the further side of the county, whom he had\nnever met before, who was also smoking under Bertie's pupilage, and\nlistening with open ears to an account given by his companion of\nsome of the pastimes of the Eastern clime.\n\n'Bertie, I am seeking you everywhere,' said Charlotte. 'Come up\nhere at once.'\n\nBertie looked up out of the ha-ha, and saw the two ladies before\nhim. As there was nothing for him but to obey, he got up and threw\naway his cigar. From the first moment of his acquaintance with her\nhe had liked Eleanor Bold. Had he been left to his own devices, had\nshe been penniless, and had it then been quite out of the question\nthat he should marry her, he would most probably have fallen\nviolently in love with her. But now he could not help regarding her\nsomewhat as he did the marble workshops at Carrara, as he had done\nhis easel and palette, as he had done the lawyer's chambers in\nLondon; in fact, as he had invariably regarded everything by which\nit had been proposed to obtain the means of living. Eleanor Bold\nappeared before him, no longer as a beautiful woman, but as a new\nprofession called matrimony. It was a profession indeed requiring\nbut little labour, and one in which an income was insured to him.\nBut nevertheless he had been as it were goaded on to it; his sister\nhad talked to him of Eleanor, just as she had talked of busts and\nportraits. Bertie did not dislike money, but he hated the very\nthought of earning it. He was now called away from his pleasant\ncigar to earn it, by offering himself as a husband to Mrs Bold. The\nwork indeed was made easy enough; for in lieu of his having to seek\nthe widow, the widow had apparently come to seek him.\n\nHe made some sudden absurd excuse to his auditor, and then throwing\naway his cigar, climbed up the wall of the ha-ha and joined the\nladies on the lawn.\n\n'Come and give Mrs Bold your arm,' said Charlotte, 'while I set you\non a piece of duty which, as a preux chevalier, you must\nimmediately perform. Your personal danger will, I fear, be\ninsignificant, as your antagonist is a clergyman.'\n\nBertie immediately gave his arm to Eleanor, walking between her and\nhis sister. He had lived too long abroad to fall into an\nEnglishman's habit of offering each an arm to two ladies at the\nsame time; a habit, by the bye, which foreigners regard as an\napproach to bigamy, or a sort of incipient Mormonism.\n\nThe little history of Mr Slope's misconduct was then told to Bertie\nby his sister, Eleanor's ears tingling the while. And well they\nmight tingle. If it were necessary to speak of the outrage at all,\nwhy should it be spoken of to such a person as Mr Stanhope, and why\nin her own hearing? She knew she was wrong, and was unhappy and\ndispirited, and yet she could think of no way to extricate herself,\nno way to set herself right. Charlotte spared her as much as she\npossibly could, spoke of the whole thing as though Mr Slope had\ntaken a glass of wine too much, said that of course there would be\nnothing more about it, but that steps must be taken to exclude Mr\nSlope from the carriage.\n\n'Mrs Bold need be under no alarm about that,' said Bertie, 'for Mr\nSlope has gone this hour past. He told me that business made it\nnecessary that he should start at once for Barchester.'\n\n'He is not so tipsy, at any rate, but what he knows his fault,'\nsaid Charlotte. 'Well, my dear, that is one difficulty over. Now\nI'll leave you with your true knight, and get Madeline off as\nquickly as I can. The carriage is here, I suppose, Bertie?'\n\n'It has been here for the last hour.'\n\n'That's well. Good-bye, my dear. Of course you'll come in to tea. I\nshall trust you to bring her, Bertie; even by force if necessary.'\nAnd so saying, Charlotte was off across the lawn, leaving her\nbrother alone with the widow.\n\nAs Miss Stanhope went off, Eleanor bethought herself that, as Mr\nSlope had taken his departure, there no longer existed any\nnecessity for separating Mr Stanhope from his sister Madeline, who\nso much needed his aid. It had been arranged that he should remain\nso as to preoccupy Mr Slope's place in the carriage, and act as a\nsocial policeman to effect the exclusion of that disagreeable\ngentleman. But Mr Slope had effected his own exclusion, and there\nas no possible reason now why Bertie should not go with his sister.\nAt least Eleanor saw none, and she said so much.\n\n'Oh, let Charlotte have her own way,' said he. 'She has arranged\nit, and there will be no end of confusion if we make another\nchange. Charlotte always arranges everything in our house; and\nrules us like a despot.'\n\n'But the signora?' said Eleanor.\n\n'Oh, the signora can do very well without me. Indeed, she will have\nto do without me,' he added, thinking rather of his studies in\nCarrara, than of his Barchester hymeneals.\n\n'Why, you are not going to leave us?' asked Eleanor.\n\nIt has been said that Bertie Stanhope was a man without principle.\nHe certainly was so. He had no power of using active mental\nexertion to keep himself from doing evil. Evil had no ugliness in\nhis eyes; virtue no beauty. He was void of any of those feelings\nwhich actuate men to do good. But he was perhaps equally void of\nthose which actuate men to do evil. He got into debt with utter\nrecklessness, thinking of nothing as to whether the tradesmen would\never be paid or not. But he did not invent active schemes of deceit\nfor the sake of extracting the goods of others. If a man gave him\ncredit, that was the man's look-out; Bertie Stanhope troubled\nhimself nothing further. In borrowing money he did the same; he\ngave people references to 'his governor', told them that the 'old\nchap' had a good income; and agreed to pay sixty per cent for the\naccommodation. All this he did without a scruple of conscience; but\nthen he never contrived active villainy.\n\nIn this affair of his marriage, it had been represented to him as a\nmatter of duty that he ought to put himself in possession of Mrs\nBold's hand and fortune; and at first he had so regarded it. About\nher he had thought but little. It was the customary thing for men\nsituated as he was to marry for money, and there was no reason why\nhe should not do what others around him did. And so he consented.\nBut now he began to see the matter in another light. He was setting\nhimself down to catch a woman, as a cat sits to catch a mouse. He\nwas to catch her, and swallow her up, her and her child, and her\nhouses and land, in order that he might live on her instead of on\nhis father. There was a cold, calculating, cautious cunning about\nthis quite at variance with Bertie's character. The prudence of the\nmeasure was quite as antagonistic to his feelings as the iniquity.\n\nAnd then, should he be successful, what would be the reward? Having\nsatisfied his creditors with half of the widow's fortune, he would\nbe allowed to sit down quietly at Barchester, keeping economical\nhouse with the remainder. His duty would be to rock the cradle of\nthe late Mr Bold's child, and his highest excitement a demure party\nat Plumstead rectory, should it ultimately turn out that the\narchdeacon be sufficiently reconciled to receive him.\n\nThere was little in the programme to allure such a man as Bertie\nStanhope. Would not the Carrara workshop, or whatever worldly\ncareer fortune might have in store for him, would not almost\nanything be better than this? The lady herself was undoubtedly all\nthat was desirable; but the most desirable lady becomes nauseous\nwhen she has to be taken as a pill. He was pledged to his sister,\nhowever, and let him quarrel with whom he would, it behoved him not\nto quarrel with her. If she were lost to him all would be lost that\nhe could ever hope to derive henceforward from the paternal\nroof-tree. His mother was apparently indifferent to his weal or\nwoe, to his wants or to his warfare. His father's brow got blacker\nand blacker from day to day, as the old man looked at his hopeless\nson. And as for Madeline--poor Madeline, whom of all of them he\nliked the best,--she had enough to do to shift for herself. No;\ncome what might, he must cling to his sister and obey her behests,\nlet them be ever so stern; or at the very least be seen to obey\nthem. Could not some happy deceit bring him through in this matter,\nso that he might save appearances with his sister, and yet not\nbetray the widow to her ruin? What if he made a confidence of\nEleanor?\n\n'Twas in this spirit that Bertie Stanhope set about his wooing.\n\n'But you are not going to leave Barchester?' asked Eleanor.\n\n'I do not know,' he replied. 'I hardly know yet what I am going to\ndo. But it is at any rate certain that I must do something.'\n\n'You mean about your profession?' said she.\n\n'Yes, about my profession, if you can call it one.'\n\n'And is it not one?' said Eleanor. 'Were I a man, I know none I\nshould prefer to it, except painting. And I believe the one is as\nmuch in your power as the other.'\n\n'Yes, just about equally so,' said Bertie with a little touch of\ninward satire directed at himself. He knew in his heart that he\nwould never make a penny by either.\n\n'I have often wondered, Mr Stanhope, why you do not exert yourself\nmore,' said Eleanor, who felt a friendly fondness for the man with\nwhom she was walking. 'But I know it is very impertinent in me to\nsay so.'\n\n'Impertinent!' said he. 'Not so, but much too kind. It is much too\nkind in you to take an interest in so idle a scamp.'\n\n'And make busts of the bishop, dean and chapter? Or perhaps, if I\nachieve great success, obtain a commission to put up an elaborate\ntombstone over a prebendary's widow, a dead lady with a Grecian\nnose, a bandeau, and an intricate lace veil; lying of course on a\nmarble sofa, from among the legs of which Death will be creeping\nout and poking at his victim with a small toasting-fork.'\n\nEleanor laughed; but yet she thought that if the surviving\nprebendary paid the bill the object of the artist as a professional\nman would, in great measure, be obtained.\n\n'I don't know about the dean and chapter and the prebendary's\nwidow,' said Eleanor. 'Of course you must take them as they come.\nBut the fact of your having a great cathedral in which such\nornaments are required, could not but be in your favour.'\n\n'No real artist could descend to the ornamentation of a cathedral,'\nsaid Bertie, who had his ideas of the high ecstatic ambition of\nart, as indeed all artists have, who are not in receipt of a good\nincome. 'Building should be fitted to grace the sculpture, not the\nsculpture to grace the building.'\n\n'Yes, when the work of art is good enough to merit it. Do you, Mr\nStanhope, do something sufficiently excellent, and we ladies of\nBarchester will erect for it a fitting receptacle. Come, what shall\nthe subject be?'\n\n'I'll put you in your pony-chair, Mrs Bold, as Dannecker put\nAriadne on her lion. Only you must promise to sit for me.'\n\n'My ponies are too tame, I fear, and my broad-brimmed straw hat\nwill not look so well in marble as the lace veil of the\nprebendary's wife.'\n\n'If you will not consent to that, Mrs Bold, I will consent to try\nno other subject in Barchester.'\n\n'You are determined, then, to push your fortune in other lands?'\n\n'I am determined,' said Bertie, slowly and significantly as he\ntried to bring up his mind to a great resolve; 'I am determined in\nthis matter to be guided wholly by you.'\n\n'Wholly by me!' said Eleanor, astonished at, and not quite liking\nhis altered manner.\n\n'Wholly by you,' said Bertie, dropping his companion's arm, and\nstanding before her on the path. In their walk they had come\nexactly to the spot where Eleanor had been provoked into slapping\nMr Slope's face. Could it be possible that the place was peculiarly\nunpropitious to her comfort? Could it be possible that she should\nher have to encounter another amorous swain?\n\n'If you will be guided by me, Mr Stanhope, you will set yourself\ndown to steady and persevering work, and you will be ruled by your\nfather as to the place in which it will be most advisable for you\nto do so.'\n\n'Nothing could be more prudent, if only it were practicable. But\nnow, if you will let me, I will tell you how it is that I will be\nguided by you, and why. Will you let me tell you?'\n\n'I really do not know what you can have to tell.'\n\n'No--you cannot know. It is impossible that you should. But we have\nbeen very good friends, Mrs Bold, have we not?'\n\n'Yes, I think we have,' said she, observing in his demeanour an\nearnestness very unusual with him.\n\n'You were kind enough to say just now that you took an interest in\nme, and I was perhaps vain enough to believe you.'\n\n'There is no vanity in that; I do so as your sister's brother,--and\nas my own friend also.'\n\n'Well, I don't deserve that you should feel so kindly towards me,'\nsaid Bertie; 'but upon my word I am very grateful for it,' and he\npaused awhile, hardly knowing how to introduce the subject that he\nhad in hand.\n\nAnd it was no wonder that he found it difficult. He had to make\nknown to his companion the scheme that had been prepared to rob her\nof her wealth; he had to tell her that he loved her without\nintending to marry her; and he had also to bespeak from her not\nonly his own pardon, but also that of his sister, and induce Mrs\nBold to protest in her future communication with Charlotte that an\noffer had been duly made to her and duly rejected.\n\nBertie Stanhope was not prone to be very diffident of his own\nconversational powers, but it did seem to him that he was about to\ntax them almost too far. He hardly knew where to begin, and he\nhardly knew where he should end.\n\n'I wish to be guided by you,' said he; 'and, indeed, in this\nmatter, there is no one else who can set me right.'\n\n'Oh, that must be nonsense,' said she.\n\n'Well, listen to me now, Mrs Bold; and if you can help it, pray\ndon't be angry with me.'\n\n'Angry!' said she.\n\n'Oh, indeed you will have cause to do so. You know how very much\nattached to you my sister Charlotte is.'\n\nEleanor acknowledged that she did.\n\n'Indeed she is; I never knew her to love any one so warmly on so\nshort an acquaintance. You know also how well she loves me?'\n\nEleanor now made no answer, but she felt the blood tingle in her\ncheek as she gathered from what he said the probable result of this\ndouble-barrelled love on the part of Miss Stanhope.\n\n'I am her only brother, Mrs Bold, and it is not to be wondered at\nthat she should love me. But you do not yet know Charlotte--you do\nnot know how entirely the well-being of our family hangs on her.\nWithout her to manage for us, I do not know how we should get on\nfrom day to day. You cannot yet have observed all this.'\n\nEleanor had indeed observed a good deal of this; she did not\nhowever now say so, but allowed him to proceed with his story.\n\n'You cannot therefore be surprised that Charlotte should be most\nanxious to do the best for us all.\n\nEleanor said that she was not at all surprised.\n\n'And she has had a very difficult game to play, Mrs Bold--a very\ndifficult game. Poor Madeline's unfortunate marriage and terrible\naccident, my mother's ill-health, my father's absence from England,\nand last, and worst perhaps my own roving, idle spirit have almost\nbeen too much for her. You cannot wonder if among all her cares one\nof the foremost is to see me settled in the world.'\n\nEleanor on this occasion expressed no acquiescence. She certainly\nsupposed that a formal offer was to be made, and could not but\nthink that so singular an exordium was never before made by a\ngentleman in a similar position. Mr Slope had annoyed her by the\nexcess of his ardour. It was quiet clear that no such danger was to\nbe feared from Mr Stanhope. Prudential motives alone actuated him. Not only was he about to\nmake love because his sister told him, but he also took the\nprecaution of explaining all this before he began. 'Twas thus, we\nmay presume, that the matter presented itself to Mrs Bold.\n\nWhen he had got so far, Bertie began poling in the gravel with a\nlittle cane which he carried. He still kept moving on, but very\nslowly, and his companion moved slowly by his side, not inclined to\nassist him in the task the performance of which appeared to be\ndifficult to him.\n\n'Knowing how fond she is of yourself, Mrs Bold, cannot you imagine\nwhat scheme should have occurred to her?'\n\n'I can imagine no better scheme, Mr Stanhope, than the one I\nproposed to you just now.'\n\n'No,' said he, somewhat lack-a-daisically; 'I suppose that would be\nthe best; but Charlotte thinks another plan might be joined with\nit.--She wants me to marry you.'\n\nA thousand remembrances flashed across Eleanor's mind all in a\nmoment--how Charlotte had talked about and praised her brother, how\nshe had continually contrived to throw the two of them together,\nhow she had encouraged all manner of little intimacies, how she had\nwith singular cordiality persisted in treating Eleanor as one of\nthe family. All this had been done to secure her comfortable income\nfor the benefit of one of the family!\n\nSuch a feeling as this is very bitter when it first impresses\nitself on a young mind. To the old such plots and plans, such\nmatured schemes for obtaining the goods of this world without the\ntrouble of earning them, such long-headed attempts to convert\n'tuum' into 'meum' are the ways of life to which they are\naccustomed. 'Tis thus that many live, and it therefore behoves all\nthose who are well to do in the world be on their guard against\nthose who are not. With them it is the success that disgusts, not\nthe attempt. But Eleanor had not yet learnt to look on her money as\na source of danger; she had not begun to regard herself as fair\ngame to be hunted down by hungry gentlemen. She had enjoyed the\nsociety of the Stanhopes, she had greatly liked the cordiality of\nCharlotte, and had been happy in her new friends. Now she saw the\ncause of all that kindness, and her mind was opened to a new phase\nof human life.\n\n'Miss Stanhope,' said she haughtily, 'has been contriving for me a\ngreat deal of honour, but she might have saved herself the trouble.\nI an not sufficiently ambitious.'\n\n'Pray don't be angry with her, Mrs Bold,' said he, 'or with me\neither.'\n\n'Certainly not with you, Mr Stanhope,' said she, with considerable\nsarcasm in her tone. 'Certainly not with you.'\n\n'No,--nor with her,' said he imploringly.\n\n'And why, may I ask you, Mr Stanhope, have you told me this\nsingular story? For I may presume I may judge by your manner of\ntelling it, that--that--that you and your sister are not exactly of\none mind on the subject.'\n\n'No, we are not.'\n\n'And if so,' said Mrs Bold, who was now really angry with the\nunnecessary insult, which she thought had been offered to her, 'and\nif so, why has it been worth your while to tell me all this?'\n\n'I did once think, Mrs Bold--that you--that you--'\n\nThe widow now again became entirely impassive, and would not lend\nthe slightest assistance to her companion.\n\n'I did once think that you perhaps might--might have been taught to\nregard me as more than a friend.'\n\n'Never!,' said Mrs Bold, 'never. If I have ever allowed myself to\ndo anything to encourage such an idea, I have been very much to\nblame,--very much to blame, indeed.'\n\n'You never have,' said Bertie, who really had a good-natured\nanxiety to make what he said as little unpleasant as possible. 'You\nnever have, and I have seen for some time that I had no chance; but\nmy sister's hopes ran higher. I have not mistaken you, Mrs Bold,\nthough perhaps she has.'\n\n'Then why have you said all this to me?'\n\n'Because I must not anger her.'\n\n'And will not this anger her? Upon my word, Mr Stanhope, I do not\nunderstand the policy of your family. Oh, how I wish I was at\nhome!' And as she expressed this wish, she could restrain herself\nno longer, but burst out into a flood of tears.\n\nPoor Bertie was greatly moved. 'You shall have the carriage to\nyourself going home,' said he, 'at least you and my father. As for\nme I can walk, or for the matter of that it does not much signify\nwhat I do.' He perfectly understood that part of Eleanor's grief\narose from the apparent necessity of going back to Barchester in\nthe carriage of her second suitor.\n\nThis somewhat mollified her. 'Oh, Mr Stanhope,' said she, 'why\nshould you have made me so miserable? What will have gained by\ntelling me all this?'\n\nHe had not even yet explained to her the most difficult part of his\nproposition; he had not told her that she was to be a party to the\nlittle deception which he intended to play off upon his sister.\nThis suggestion had still to be made, and as it was absolutely\nnecessary, he proceeded to make it.\n\nWe need not follow him through the whole of his statement. At last,\nand not without considerable difficulty, he made Eleanor understand\nwhy he had let her into his confidence, seeing that he no longer\nintended her the honour of a formal offer. At last he made her\ncomprehend the part which she was destined to play in this little\nfamily comedy.\n\nBut when she did understand it, she was only more angry with him\nthan ever: more angry, not only with him, but with Charlotte also.\nHer fair name was to bandied about between them in different\nsenses, and each sense false. She was to played off by the sister\nagainst the father; and then by the brother against the sister. Her\ndear friend Charlotte, with all her agreeable sympathy and\naffection, was striving to sacrifice her for the Stanhope family\nwelfare; and Bertie, who, as he now proclaimed himself, was over\nhead and heels in debt, completed the compliment of owning that he\ndid not care to have his debts paid at so great a sacrifice to\nhimself. Then she was asked to conspire together with this\nunwilling suitor, for the sake of making the family believe that he\nhad in obedience to their commands done his best to throw himself\nthus away!\n\nShe lifted up her face when she had finished, and looking at him\nwith much dignity, even through her tears, she said--\n\n'I regret to say it, Mr Stanhope; but after what has passed, I\nbelieve that all intercourse between your family and myself had\nbetter cease.'\n\n'Well, perhaps it had,' said Bertie naively; 'perhaps that will be\nbetter, at any rate for a time; and then Charlotte will think you\nare offended at what I have done.'\n\n'And now I will go back to the house, if you please,' said Eleanor.\n'I can find my way by myself, Mr Stanhope: after what has passed,'\nshe added, 'I would rather go alone.'\n\n'But I must find the carriage for you, Mrs Bold, and I must tell my\nfather that you will return with him alone, and I must make some\nexcuse to him for not going with you; and I must bid the servant\nput you down at your own house, for I suppose you will not now\nchoose to see them again in the close.'\n\nThere was a truth about this, and a perspicuity in making\narrangements for lessening her immediate embarrassment, which had\nsome effect in softening Eleanor's anger. So she suffered herself\nto walk by his side over the now deserted lawn, till they came to\nthe drawing-room window. There was something about Bertie Stanhope\nwhich gave him in the estimation of every one, a different standing\nfrom that which any other man would occupy under similar\ncircumstances. Angry as Eleanor was, and great as was her cause for\nanger, she was not half as angry with him as she would have been\nwith any one else. He was apparently so simple, so good- natured,\nso unaffected and easy to talk to, that she had already\nhalf-forgiven him before he was at the drawing-room window. When\nthey arrived there, Dr Stanhope was sitting nearly alone with Mr\nand Miss Thorne; one or two other unfortunates were there, who from\none cause or another were still delayed in getting away; but they\nwere every moment getting fewer in number.\n\nAs soon as he had handed Eleanor over to his father, Bertie started\noff to the front gate, in search of the carriage, and there waited\nleaning patiently against the front wall, and comfortably smoking a\ncigar, till it came up. When he returned to the room, Dr Stanhope\nand Eleanor were alone with their hosts.\n\n'At last, Miss Thorne,' said he cheerily, 'I have come to relieve\nyou. Mrs Bold and my father are the last roses in the very\ndelightful summer you have given us, and desirable as Mrs Bold's\nsociety always is, now at least you must be glad to see the last\nflowers plucked from the tree.'\n\nMiss Thorne declared that she was delighted to have Mrs Bold and Dr\nStanhope still with her; and Mr Thorne would have said the same,\nhad he not been checked by a yawn, which he could not suppress.\n\n'Father, will you give your arm to Mrs Bold?' said Bertie: and so\nthe last adieux were made, and the prebendary led out Mrs Bold,\nfollowed by his son.\n\n'I shall be home soon after you,' said he, as the two got into the\ncarriage.\n\n'Are you not coming in the carriage?' said the father.\n\n'No, no; I have some one to see on the road, and shall walk. John,\nmind you drive to Mrs Bold's house first.'\n\nEleanor, looking out of the window, saw him with his hat in his\nhand, bowing to her with his usual gay smile, as though nothing had\nhappened to mar the tranquillity of the day. It was many a long\nyear before she saw him again. Dr Stanhope hardly spoke to her on\nher way home: and she was safely deposited by John at her own\nhall-door, before the carriage drove into the close.\n\nAnd thus our heroine played the last act of that day's melodrama.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII\n\nMR AND MRS QUIVERFUL ARE MADE HAPPY. MR SLOPE ENCOURAGED BY THE\nPRESS\n\nBefore she started for Ullathorne, Mrs Proudie, careful soul,\ncaused two letters to be written, one by herself and one by her\nlord, to the inhabitants of Puddingdale vicarage, which made happy\nthe hearth of those within it.\n\nAs soon as the departure of the horses left the bishop's\nstable-groom free for other services, that humble denizen of the\ndiocese started on the bishop's own pony with the two despatches.\nWe have had so many letters lately that we will spare ourselves\nthese. That from the bishop was simply a request that Mr Quiverful\nwould wait upon his lordship the next morning at 11 A.M.; and that\nfrom the lady was as simply a request that Mrs Quiverful would do\nthe same by her, though it was couched in somewhat longer and more\ngrandiloquent phraseology.\n\nIt had become a point of conscience with Mrs Proudie to urge the\nsettlement of this great hospital question. She was resolved that\nMr Quiverful should have it. She was resolved that there should be\nno more doubt or delay; no more refusals and resignations, nor more\nsecret negotiations carried on by Mr Slope on his own account in\nopposition to her behests.\n\n'Bishop,' she said, immediately after breakfast, on the morning of\nthat eventful day, 'have you signed the appointment yet?'\n\n'No, my dear, not yet; it is not exactly signed as yet.'\n\n'Then do it,' said the lady.\n\nThe bishop did it; and a very pleasant day indeed he spent at\nUllathorne. And when he got home he had a glass of hot negus in his\nwife's sitting-room, and read the last number of the 'Little\nDorrit' of the day with great inward satisfaction. Oh, husbands,\noh, my marital friends, what great comfort is there to be derived\nfrom a wife well obeyed!\n\nMuch perturbation and flutter, high expectation and renewed hopes,\nwere occasioned at Puddingdale, by the receipt of those episcopal\ndispatches. Mrs Quiverful, whose careful ear caught the sound of\nthe pony's feet as he trotted up to the vicarage kitchen door,\nbrought them in hurriedly to her husband. She was at the moment\nconcocting the Irish stew destined to satisfy the noonday want of\nfourteen young birds, let alone the parent couple. She had taken\nthe letters from the man's hands between the folds of her capacious\napron, so as to save them from the contamination of the stew, and\nin this guise she brought them to her husband's desk.\n\nThey at once divided the spoil, each taking that addressed to the\nothers. 'Quiverful,'said she with impressive voice, 'you are to be\nat the palace at eleven to-morrow.'\n\n'And so are you, my dear,' said he, almost gasping with the\nimportance of the tidings: and then they exchanged letters.\n\n'She'd never have sent for me again,' said the lady, 'if it wasn't\nall right.'\n\n'Oh! My dear, don't be too certain,' said the gentleman. 'Only\nthink if it should be wrong.'\n\n'She'd never have sent for me, Q., if it wasn't all right,' again\nargued the lady. 'She's stiff and hard and proud as pie-crust, but\nI think she's right at bottom.' Such was Mrs Quiverful's verdict\nabout Mrs Proudie, to which in after times she always adhered.\nPeople when they get their income doubled usually think that those\nthrough whose instrumentality this little ceremony is performed are\nright at bottom.\n\n'Oh, Letty!' said Mr Quiverful, rising from his well-worn seat.\n\n'Oh, Q!' said Mrs Quiverful; and then the two, unmindful of the\nkitchen apron, the greasy fingers, and the adherent Irish stew,\nthrew themselves warmly into each other's arms.\n\n'For heaven's sake, don't let any one cajole you out of it again,'\nsaid the wife.\n\n'Let me alone for that,' said the husband, with a look of almost\nfierce determination, pressing his fist as he spoke rigidly on his\ndesk, as though he had Mr Slope's head below his knuckles, and\nmeant to keep it there.\n\n'I wonder how soon it will be,' said she.\n\n'I wonder whether it will be at all,' said he, still doubtful.\n\n'Well, I won't say too much,' said the lady. 'The cup has slipped\ntwice before, and it may fall altogether this time; but I'll not\nbelieve it. He'll give you the appointment to-morrow. You'll find\nhe will.'\n\n'Heaven send he may,' said Mr Quiverful, solemnly. And who that\nconsiders the weight of the burden on this man's back, will say\nthat the prayer was an improper one? There were fourteen of\nthem--fourteen of them living--as Mrs Quiverful had so powerfully\nurged in the presence of the bishop's wife. As long as promotion\ncometh from any human source, whether north or south, east or west,\nwill not such a claim as this hold good, in spite of all our\nexamination tests, detur digniori's and optimist tendencies? It is\nfervently to be hoped that it may. Till we can become divine we\nmust be content to be human, lest in our hurry for change we sink\nto something lower.\n\nAnd then the pair sitting down lovingly together, talked over all\ntheir difficulties, as they so often did, and all their hopes, as\nthey so seldom were able to do.\n\n'You had better call on that man, Q, as you come away from the\npalace,' said Mrs Quiverful, pointing to an angry call for money\nfrom the Barchester draper, which the postman had left at the\nvicarage that morning. Cormorant that he was, unjust, hungry\ncormorant! When rumour first got abroad that the Quiverfuls were to\ngo to the hospital this fellow with fawning eagerness had pressed\nhis goods upon the wants of the poor clergyman. He had done so,\nfeeling that he should be paid from the hospital funds, and\nflattering himself that a man with fourteen children, and money\nwherewithal to clothe them, could not but be an excellent customer.\nAs soon as the second rumour reached him, he applied for his money\nangrily.\n\n'And the 'fourteen'--or such of them as were old enough to hope and\ndiscuss their hopes, talked over their golden future. The\ntall-grown girls whispered to each other of possible Barchester\nparties, of possible allowances for dresses, of a possible\npiano--the one they had in the vicarage was so weather-beaten with\nstorms of years and children as to be no longer worthy of the\nname--of the pretty garden, and the pretty house. 'Twas of such\nthings it most behoved them to whisper.\n\nAnd the younger fry, they did not content themselves with whispers,\nbut shouted to each other of their new playground beneath our dear\nex-warden's well-loved elms, of their future own gardens, of\nmarbles to be procured in the wished-for city, and of the rumour\nwhich had reached them of a Barchester school.\n\n'Twas in vain that their cautious mother tried to instil into their\nbreasts the very feeling she had striven to banish from that of\ntheir father; 'twas in vain that she repeated to the girls that\n'there's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip'; 'twas in vain she\nattempted to make the children believe that they were to live at\nPuddingdale all their lives. Hopes mounted high and would not have\nthemselves quelled. The neighbouring farmers heard this news, and\ncame in to congratulate them. 'Twas Mrs Quiverful herself who had\nkindled the fire, and in the first outbreak of her renewed\nexpectations she did it so thoroughly, that it was quite past her\npower to put it out again.\n\nPoor matron! Good honest matron! Doing thy duty in the state to\nwhich thou hast been called, heartily if not contentedly; let the\nfire burn on--on this occasion the flames will not scorch; they\nshall warm thee and thine. 'Tis ordained that the husband of thine,\nthat Q of thy bosom, shall reign supreme for some years to come\nover the bedesmen of Hiram's hospital.\n\nAnd the last in all Barchester to mar their hopes, had he heard and\nseen all that had passed at Puddingdale that day, would have been\nMr Harding. What wants had he to set in opposition to those of such\na regiment of young ravens? There are fourteen of them living! With\nhim at any rate, let us say, that the argument would have been\nsufficient for the appointment of Mr Quiverful.\n\nIn the morning, Q and his wife kept their appointments with that\npunctuality which bespeaks an expectant mind. The friendly farmer's\ngig was borrowed, and in that they went, discussing many things by\nthe way. They had instructed the household to expect them back by\none, and injunctions were given to the eldest pledge to have ready\nby that accustomed hour the remainder of the huge stew which the\nprovident mother had prepared on the previous day. The hands of the\nkitchen clock came round to two, three, four, before the farmer's\ngig-wheels were agin heard at the vicarage gate. With what\npalpitating hearts were the returning wanderers greeted!\n\n'I suppose, children, 'you all thought we were never coming back\nany more?' said the mother, as she slowly let down her solid foot\ntill it rested on the step of the gig. 'Well, such a day as we've\nhad!' and then leaning heavily on a big boy's shoulder, she stepped\nonce more on terra firma.\n\nThere was no need for more than the tone of her voice to tell them\nthat all was right. The Irish stew might burn itself to cinders\nnow.\n\nThen there was such kissing and hugging, such crying and laughing.\nMr Quiverful could not sit still at all, but kept walking from room\nto room, then out into the garden, then down the avenue into the\nroad, and then back again to his wife. She, however, lost no time\nso idly.\n\n'We must go to work at once, girls; and that in earnest. Mrs\nProudie expects us to be in the hospital house on the 15th of\nOctober.'\n\nHad Mrs Proudie expressed a wish that they should all be there on\nthe next morning, the girls would have had nothing to say against\nit.\n\n'And when will the pay begin?' asked the eldest boy.\n\n'To-day, my dear,' said the gratified mother.\n\n'Oh,--that is jolly,' said the boy.\n\n'Mrs Proudie insisted on our going down to the house,' continued\nthe mother; 'and when there I thought I might save a journey by\nmeasuring some of the rooms and windows; so I got a knot of tape\nfrom Bobbins. Bobbins is as civil as you please, now.'\n\n'I wouldn't thank him,' said Letty the younger.\n\n'Oh, that's the way of the world, my dear. They all do just the\nsame. You might just as well be angry with the turkey cock for\ngobbling at you. It's the bird's nature.' And as she enunciated to\nher bairns the upshot of her practical experience, she pulled from\nher pocket the portions of tape which showed the length and breadth\nof the various rooms at the hospital house.\n\nAnd so we will leave her happy in her toils.\n\nThe Quiverfuls had hardly left the palace, and Mrs Proudie was\nstill holding forth on the matter to her husband, when another\nvisitor was announced in, the person of Dr Gwynne. The master of\nLazarus had asked for the bishop, and not for Mrs Proudie, and\ntherefore, when he was shown into the study, he was surprised\nrather than rejoiced to find the lady there.\n\nBut we must go back a little, and it shall be but a little, for a\ndifficulty begins to make itself manifest in the necessity of\ndisposing of all our friends in the small remainder of this one\nvolume. Oh, that Mr Longman would allow me a fourth! It should\ntranscend the other three as the seventh heaven transcends all the\nlower stages of celestial bliss.\n\nGoing home in the carriage that evening from Ullathorne, Dr Gwynne\nhad not without difficulty brought round his friend the archdeacon\nto a line of tactics much less bellicose than that which his own\ntaste would have preferred. 'It will be unseemly in us to show\nourselves in a bad humour; and moreover we have no power in this\nmatter, and it will therefore be bad policy to act as though we\nhad.' 'Twas thus the master of Lazarus argued. 'If,' he continued,\n'the bishop is determined to appoint another to the hospital,\nthreats will not prevent him, and threats should not be lightly\nused by an archdeacon to his bishop. If he will place a stranger in\nthe hospital, we can only leave him to the indignation of others.\nIt is probable that such a step may not eventually injure your\nfather-in-law. I will see the bishop, if you will allow\nme,--alone.' At this the archdeacon winced visibly; 'yes, alone;\nfor so I shall be calmer: and then I shall at any rate learn what\nhe does mean to do in the matter.\n\nThe archdeacon puffed and blew, put up the carriage window and then\nput it down again, argued the matter up to his own gate, and at\nlast gave way. Everybody was against him; his own wife, Mr Harding,\nand Dr Gwynne.\n\n'Pray keep him out of hot water, Dr Gwynne,' Mrs Grantly had said\nto her guest. 'My dearest madam, I'll do my best,' the courteous\nmaster had replied. 'Twas thus he did it; and earned for himself\nthe gratitude of Mrs Grantly.\n\nAnd now we may return to the bishop's study.\n\nDr Gwynne had certainly not foreseen the difficulty which here\npresented itself. He,--together with all the clerical world of\nEngland,--had heard it rumoured about that Mrs Proudie did not\nconfine herself to her wardrobes, still-rooms, and laundries; but\nyet it had never occurred to him that if he called on a bishop at\none o'clock in the day, he could by any possibility find himself\ncloseted with his wife; or that if he did so, the wife would remain\nlonger than necessary to make her curtsey. It appeared, however,\nas though in the present case Mrs Proudie had no idea of retreating.\n\nThe bishop had been very much pleased with Dr Gwynne on the\npreceding day, and of course thought that Dr Gwynne had been very\nmuch pleased with him. He attributed the visit solely to\ncompliment, and thought it was an extremely gracious and proper\nthing for the master of Lazarus to drive over from Plumstead\nspecially to call at the palace so soon after his arrival in the\ncountry. The fact that they were not on the same side either in\npolitics or doctrines made the compliment the greater. The bishop,\ntherefore, was all smiles. And Mrs Proudie, who liked people with\ngood handles to their names, was also very well disposed to welcome\nthe master of Lazarus.\n\n'We had a charming party at Ullathorne, Master, had we not?' said\nshe. 'I hope Mrs Grantly got home without fatigue.'\n\nDr Gwynne said that they had all been a little tired, but were none\nthe worse this morning.\n\n'An excellent person, Miss Thorne,' suggested the bishop.\n\n'An exemplary Christian, I am told,' said Mrs Proudie.\n\nDr Gwynne declared that he was very glad to hear it.\n\n'I have not seen her Sabbath-day schools yet,' continued the lady,\n'but I shall make a point of doing so before long.'\n\nDr Gwynne merely bowed at this intimation. He had something of Mrs\nProudie and her Sunday schools, both from Dr Grantly and Mr\nHarding.\n\n'By the bye, Master,' continued the lady, 'I wonder whether Mrs\nGrantly would like me to drive over and inspect her Sabbath-day\nschool. I hear that it is most excellently kept.'\n\nDr Gwynne really could not say. He had no doubt Mrs Grantly would\nbe most happy to see Mrs Proudie any day Mrs Proudie would do her\nthe honour of calling: that was, of course, if Mrs Grantly should\nhappen to be at home.\n\nA slight cloud darkened the lady's brow. She saw that her offer was\nnot taken in good part. This generation of unregenerated vipers was\nstill perverse, stiffnecked, and hardened in their antiquity. 'The\narchdeacon, I know,' said she, 'sets his face against these\ninstitutions.'\n\nAt this Dr Gwynne laughed slightly. It was but a smile. Had he\ngiven his cap for it he could not have helped it.\n\nMrs Proudie frowned again. '\"Suffer little children, and forbid\nthem not,\"' said she. 'Are we not to remember that, Dr Gwynne?\n\"Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones.\" Are we\nnot to remember that, Dr Gwynne?' And at each of these questions\nshe raised at him a menacing forefinger.\n\n'Certainly, madam, certainly,' said the master, 'and so does the\narchdeacon, I am sure, on week days as well as on Sundays.'\n\n'On week days you can't take heed not to despise them,' said Mrs\nProudie, 'because they are out in the fields. On week days they\nbelong to their parents, but on Sundays they ought to belong to the\nclergyman.' And the finger was again raised.\n\nThe master began to understand and to share the intense disgust\nwhich the archdeacon always expressed when Mrs Proudie's name was\nmentioned. What was he to do with such a woman as this? To take his\nhat and go would have been his natural resource; but then he did\nnot wish to be foiled in his subject.\n\n'My lord,' said he, 'I wanted to ask you a question on business, if\nyou would spare me one moment's leisure. I know I must apologise\nfor so disturbing you; but in truth, I will not detain you five\nminutes.'\n\n'Certainly, Master, certainly,' said the bishop; 'my time is quite\nyours--pray make no apology, pray make no apology.'\n\n'You have a great deal to do just at the present moment, bishop. Do\nnot forget how extremely busy you are at present,' said Mrs\nProudie, whose spirit was now up; for she was angry with her\nvisitor.\n\n'I will not delay his lordship much above a minute,' said the\nmaster of Lazarus, rising from his chair, and expecting that Mrs\nProudie would now go, or else that the bishop would lead the way\ninto another room.\n\nBut neither event seemed likely to occur, and Dr Gwynne stood for a\nmoment silent in the middle of the room.\n\n'Perhaps it's about Hiram's Hospital,' suggested Mrs Proudie.\n\nDr Gwynne, lost in astonishment, and not knowing what else on earth\nto do, confessed that his business with the bishop was connected\nwith Hiram's Hospital.\n\n'His lordship has finally conferred the appointment on Mr Quiverful\nthis morning,' said the lady.\n\nDr Gwynne made a simple reference to the bishop, and finding that\nthe lady's statement was formally confirmed, he took his leave.\n'That comes of the reform bill,' he said to himself as he walked\ndown the bishop's avenue. 'Well, at any rate the Greek play bishops\nwere not so bad as that.'\n\nIt has been said that Mr Slope, as he started for Ullathorne,\nreceived a despatch from his friend Mr Towers, which had the effect\nof putting him in that high good-humour which subsequent events\nsomewhat untowardly damped. It ran as follows. Its shortness will\nbe its sufficient apology:\n\nMy dear Sir,--I wish you every success. I don't know that I can\nhelp you, but if I can I will. 'Yours ever' T.T. '30\/9\/185-'\n\nThere was more in this than in all Sir Nicholas Fitzwiggin's\nflummery; more than in all the bishop's promises, even had they\nbeen ever so sincere; more than in any archbishop's good work, even\nhad it been possible to obtain it. Tom Towers would do for him what\nhe could.\n\nMr Slope had from his youth upwards been a firm believer in the\npublic press. He had dabbled in it himself ever since he had taken\nhis degree, and regarded it as the great arranger and distributor\nof all future British terrestrial affairs whatever. He had not yet\narrived at the age, an age which sooner or later comes to most of\nus, which dissipates the golden dreams of youth. He delighted in\nthe idea of wresting power from the hands of his country's\nmagnates, and placing it in a custody which was at any rate nearer\nto his own reach. Sixty thousand broad sheets dispersing themselves\ndaily among his reading fellow-citizens, formed in his eyes a\nbetter depot for supremacy than a throne at Windsor, a cabinet in\nDowning Street, or even an assembly at Westminster. And on this\nsubject we must not quarrel with Mr Slope, for the feeling is too\ngeneral to be met with disrespect.\n\nTom Towers was as good, if not better than his promise. On the\nfollowing morning the Jupiter, spouting forth public opinion with\nsixty thousand loud clarions, did proclaim to the world that Mr\nSlope was the fittest man for the vacant post. It was pleasant for\nMr Slope to read the following line in the Barchester news-room,\nwhich he did within thirty minutes after the morning train from\nLondon had reached the city.\n\n\"It is just now five years since we called the attention of our\nreaders to the quiet city of Barchester. From that day to this, we\nhave in no way meddled with the affairs of that happy\necclesiastical community. Since then, an old bishop has died there,\nand a young bishop has been installed; but we believe we did not do\nmore than give some customary record of the interesting event. Nor\nare we about to meddle very deeply in the affairs of the diocese.\nIf any of the chapter feel a qualm of conscience on reading this,\nlet it be quieted. Above all, let the mind of the new bishop be at\nrest. We are now not armed for war, but approach the revered towers\nof the old cathedral with an olive-branch in our hands.\n\n'It will be remembered that at the time alluded to, now five years\npast, we had occasion to remark on the state of a charity at\nBarchester called Hiram's Hospital. We thought that it was\nmaladministered, and that the very estimable and reverend gentleman\nwho held the office of warden was somewhat too highly paid for\nduties which were somewhat too easily performed. This\ngentleman--and we say it in all sincerity and with no touch of\nsarcasm--had never looked on the matter in this light before. We do\nnot wish to take praise to ourselves whether praise is due or not.\nBut the consequence of our remark was, that the warden did look\ninto the matter, and finding on doing so that he himself could come\nto no other opinion than that expressed by us, he very creditably\nthrew up the appointment. The then bishop then as creditably\ndeclined to fill the vacancy till the affair was put on a better\nfooting. Parliament then took it up; and we have now the\nsatisfaction of informing our readers that Hiram's Hospital will be\nimmediately re-opened under new auspices. Heretofore, provision was\nmade for the maintenance of twelve old men. This will now be\nextended to the fair sex, and twelve elderly women if any such can\nbe found in Barchester, will be added to the establishment. There\nwill be a matron; there will, it is hoped, be schools attached for\nthe poorest of the children of the poor, and there will be a\nsteward. The warden, for there will still be a warden, will receive\nan income more in keeping with the extent of the charity than that\nheretofore paid. The stipend we believe will be L 450. We may add\nthat the excellent house which the former warden inhabited will\nstill be attached to the situation.\n\n'Barchester hospital cannot perhaps boast a world-wide reputation;\nbut as we advertised to its state of decadence, we think it right\nalso to advert to its renaissance. May it go up and prosper.\nWhether the salutary reform which has been introduced within its\nwalls has been carried as far as could have been desired, may be\ndoubtful. The important question of the school appears to be\nsomewhat left to the discretion of the new warden. This might have\nbeen made the most important part of the establishment, and the new\nwarden, whom we trust we shall not offend by the freedom of our\nremarks, might have been selected with some view to his fitness as\nschoolmaster. But we will not now look a gift horse in the mouth.\nMay the hospital go on and prosper! The situation of warden has of\ncourse been offered to the gentleman who so honourable vacated it\nfive years since; but we are given to understand that he has\ndeclined it. Whether the ladies who have been introduced, be in his\nestimation too much for his powers of control, whether it be that\nthe diminished income does not offer to him sufficient temptation\nto resume the old place, or that he has in the meantime assumed\nother clerical duties, we do not know. We are, however, informed\nthat he has refused the offer, and that the situation has been\naccepted by Mr Quiverful, the vicar of Puddingdale.\n\n'So much we think is due to Hiram redivivus. But while we are on\nthe subject of Barchester, we will venture with all respectful\nhumility to express our opinion on another matter, connected with\nthe ecclesiastical polity of that ancient city. Dr Trefoil, the\ndean, died yesterday. A short record of his death, giving his age,\nand the various pieces of preferment which he has at different\ntimes held, will be found in another column in this paper. The only\nfault we knew in him was his age, and as that is a crime of which\nwe may all hope to be guilty, we will not bear heavily on it. May\nhe rest in peace! But though the great age of an expiring dean\ncannot be made matter of reproach, we are not inclined to look on\nsuch a fault as at all pardonable in a dean just brought to the\nbirth. We do hope the days of sexagenarian appointments are past.\nIf we want deans, we must want them for some purpose. That purpose\nwill necessarily be better fulfilled by a man of forty than by a\nman of sixty. If we are to pay deans at all, we are to pay them for\nsome sort of work. That work, be it what it may, will be best\nperformed by a workman in the prime of life. Dr Trefoil, we see,\nwas eighty when he died. As we have as yet completed no plan for\npositioning superannuated clergymen, we do not wish to get rid of\nany existing deans of that age. But we prefer having as few such as\npossible. If a man of seventy be now appointed, we beg to point out\nto Lord--that he will be past all use in a year or two, if indeed\nhe is not so at the present moment. His lordship will allow us to\nremind him that all men are not evergreens like himself.\n\n'We hear that Mr Slope's name has been mentioned for this\npreferment. Mr Slope is at present chaplain to the bishop. A better\nman could hardly be selected. He is a man of talent, young, active,\nand conversant with the affairs of the cathedral; he is moreover,\nwe conscientiously believe, a truly pious clergyman. We know that\nhis services in the city of Barchester have been highly\nappreciated. He is an eloquent preacher and a ripe scholar. Such a\nselection as this would go far to raise the confidence of the\npublic in the present administration of church patronage, and would\nteach men to believe that from henceforth the establishment of our\nchurch will not afford easy couches to worn-out clerical\nvoluptuaries.'\n\nStanding at a reading-desk in the Barchester news-room, Mr Slope\ndigested this article with considerable satisfaction. What was\ntherein said as the hospital was now comparatively matter of\nindifference to him. He was certainly glad that he had not\nsucceeded in restoring to the place the father of that virago who\nhad so audaciously outraged all decency in his person; and was so\nfar satisfied. But Mrs Proudie's nominee was appointed, and he was\nso far dissatisfied. His mind, however, was now soaring above Mrs\nBold or Mrs Proudie.\n\nHe was sufficiently conversant with the tactics of the Jupiter to\nknow that the pith of the article would lie in the last paragraph.\nThe place of honour was given to him, and it was indeed as\nhonourable as even he could have wished. He was very grateful to\nhis friend Mr Towers, and with full heart looked forward to the day\nwhen he might entertain him in princely style at his own\nfull-spread board in the deanery dining-room.\n\nIt had been well for Mr Slope that Dr Trefoil had died in the\nautumn. Those caterers for our morning repast, the staff of the\nJupiter, had been sorely put to it for the last month to find a\nsufficiency of proper pabulum. Just then there was no talk of a new\nAmerican president. No wonderful tragedies had occurred on railway\ntrains in Georgia, or elsewhere. There was a dearth of broken\nbanks, and a dead dean with the necessity for a live one was a\ngodsend. Had Dr Trefoil died in June, Mr Towers would probably not\nhave known so much about the piety of Mr Slope.\n\nAnd here we will leave Mr Slope for a while in his triumph;\nexplaining, however, that his feelings were not altogether of a\ntriumphant nature. His rejection by the widow, or rather the method\nof his rejection, galled him terribly. For days to come he\npositively felt the sting upon his cheek, whenever he thought of\nwhat had been done to him. He could not refrain from calling her by\nharsh names, speaking to himself as he walked through the streets\nof Barchester. When he said his prayers, he could not bring himself\nto forgive her. When he strove to do so, his mind recoiled from the\nattempt, and in lieu of forgiving, ran off in a double spirit of\nvindictiveness, dwelling on the extent of the injury he had\nreceived. And so his prayers dropped senseless from his lips.\n\nAnd then the signora; what would he not have given to be able to\nhate her also? As it was, he worshipped the very sofa on which she\nwas ever lying. And thus it was not all rose colour with Mr Slope,\nalthough his hopes ran high.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV\n\nMRS BOLD AT HOME\n\nPoor Mrs Bold, when she got home from Ullathorne on the evening of\nMiss Thorne's party, was very unhappy, and moreover very tired.\nNothing fatigues the body so much as weariness of spirit, and\nEleanor's spirit was indeed weary.\n\nDr Stanhope had civilly but not very cordially asked her in to tea,\nand her manner of refusal convinced the worthy doctor that he need\nnot repeat the invitation. He had not exactly made himself a party\nto the intrigue which was to convert the late Mr Bold's patrimony\ninto an income for his hopeful son, but he had been well aware what\nwas going on. And he was thus well aware also, when he perceived\nthat Bertie declined accompanying them home in the carriage, that\nthe affair had gone off.\n\nEleanor was very much afraid that Charlotte would have darted out\nupon her, as the prebendary got out at his own door, but Bertie\nthoughtfully saved her from this, by causing the carriage to go\nround by her house. This also Dr Stanhope understood, and allowed\nto pass by without remark.\n\nWhen she got home, she found Mary Bold in the drawing-room with the\nchild in her lap. She rushed forward, and, throwing herself on her\nknees, kissed the little fellow till she almost frightened him.\n\n'Oh, Mary, I am so glad you did not go. It was an odious party.'\n\nNow the question of Mary's going had been one greatly mooted\nbetween them. Mrs Bold, when invited, had been the guest of the\nGrantlys, and Miss Thorne, who had chiefly known Eleanor at the\nhospital or at Plumstead rectory, had forgotten all about Mary\nBold. Her sister-in-law had implored her to go under her wing, and\nhad offered to write to Miss Thorne, or to call on her. But Miss\nBold had declined. In fact, Mr Bold had not been very popular with\nsuch people as the Thornes, and his sister would not go among them\nunless she were specially asked to do so.\n\n'Well then,' said Mary cheerfully, 'I have the less to regret.'\n\n'You have nothing to regret; but oh! Mary, I have--so much--so\nmuch;'--and then she began kissing her boy, whom her caresses had\naroused from his slumbers. When she raised her head, Mary saw that\nthe tears were running down her cheeks.\n\n'Good heavens, Eleanor, what is the matter? What has happened to\nyou?--Eleanor, dearest Eleanor--what is the matter?' and Mary got\nup with the boy still in her arms.\n\n'Give him to me--give him to me,' said the young mother. 'Give him\nto me, Mary,'and she almost tore the child out of her sister's\narms. The poor little fellow murmured somewhat at the disturbance,\nbut nevertheless nestled himself close into his mother's bosom.\n\n'Here, Mary, take the cloak from me. My own, own darling, darling,\ndarling jewel. You are not false to me. Everybody else is false;\neverybody else is cruel. Mamma will care for nobody, nobody,\nnobody, but her own, own, own, little man;' and she again kissed\nand pressed the baby, and cried till the tears ran down over the\nchild's face.\n\n'Who has been cruel to you, Eleanor?' said Mary. 'I hope I have\nnot.'\n\nNow, in this matter, Eleanor had great cause for uneasiness.\n\nShe could not certainly accuse her loving sister-in-law of cruelty;\nbut she had to do that which was more galling; she had to accuse\nherself of an imprudence against which her sister-in-law had warned\nher. Miss Bold had never encouraged Eleanor's acquaintance with Mr\nSlope, and she had positively discouraged the friendship of the\nStanhopes as far as her usual gentle mode of speaking had\npermitted. Eleanor had only laughed at her, however, when she said\nthat she disapproved of married women who lived apart from their\nhusbands, and suggested that Charlotte Stanhope never went to\nchurch. Now, however, Eleanor must either hold her tongue, which\nwas quite impossible, or confess herself to have been utterly\nwrong, which was nearly equally so. So she staved off the evil day\nby more tears, and consoled herself by inducing little Johnny to\nrouse himself sufficiently to return her caresses.\n\n'He is a darling--as true as gold. What would mamma do without him?\nMamma would lie down and die if she had not her own Johnny Bold to\ngive her comfort.' This and much more she said of the same kind,\nand for a time made no other answer to Mary's inquiries.\n\nThis kind of consolation from the world's deceit is very common.\n\nMothers obtain it from their children, and men from their dogs.\nSome men even do so from their walking-sticks, which is just as\nrational. How is it that we can take joy to ourselves in that we\nare not deceived by those who have not attained the art to deceive\nus? In a true man, if such can be found, or a true woman, much\nconsolation may indeed be taken.\n\nIn the caresses of her child, however, Eleanor did receive\nconsolation; and may ill befall the man who would begrudge it to\nher. The evil day, however, was only postponed. She had to tell her\ndisagreeable tale to Mary, and she had also to tell it to her\nfather. Must it not, indeed, be told to the whole circle of her\nacquaintance before she could be made to stand all right with them?\nAt the present moment there was no one to whom she could turn for\ncomfort. She hated Mr Slope; that was a matter of course, in that\nfeeling she revelled. She hated and despised the Stanhopes; but\nthat feeling distressed her greatly. She had, as it were, separated\nherself from her old friends to throw herself into the arms of this\nfamily; and then how had they intended to use her? She could hardly\nreconcile herself to her own father, who had believed ill of her.\nMary Bold had turned Mentor. That she could have forgiven had the\nMentor turned out to be in the wrong; but Mentors in the right are\nnot to be pardoned. She could not but hate the archdeacon; and now\nshe hated him even worse than ever, for she must in some sort\nhumble herself before him. She hated her sister, for she was part\nand parcel of the archdeacon. And she would have hated Mr Arabin if\nshe could. He had pretended to regard her, and yet before her face\nhe had hung over that Italian woman as though there had been no\nbeauty in the world but hers--no other woman worth a moment's\nattention. And Mr Arabin would have to learn all this about Mr\nSlope! She told herself she hated him, and she knew that she was\nlying to herself as she did so. She had no consolation but her\nbaby, and of that she made the most. Mary, though she could not\nsurmise what it was that had so violently affected her\nsister-in-law, saw at once her grief was too great to be kept under\ncontrol, and waited patiently till the child should be in his\ncradle.\n\n'You'll have some tea, Eleanor,' she said.\n\n'Oh, I don't care,' said she; though in fact she must have been\nvery hungry, for she had eaten nothing at Ullathorne.\n\nMary quietly made the tea, and buttered the bread, laid aside the\ncloak, and made things look comfortable.\n\n'He's fast asleep,' said she, 'you're very tired; let me take him\nup to bed.'\n\nBut Eleanor would not let her sister touch him. She looked\nwistfully at her baby's eyes, saw that they were lost in the\ndeepest slumber, and then made a sort of couch for him on the sofa.\nShe was determined that nothing should prevail upon her to let him\nout of her sight that night.\n\n'Come, Nelly,' said Mary, 'don't be cross with me. I at least have\ndone nothing to offend you.'\n\n'I an't cross,' said Eleanor.\n\n'Are you angry then? Surely you can't be angry with me.'\n\n'No, I an't angry; at least not with you.'\n\n'If you are not, drink the tea I have made for you. I am sure you\nmust want it.'\n\nEleanor did drink it, and allowed herself to be persuaded. She ate\nand drank, and as the inner woman was recruited she felt a little\nmore charitable towards the world at large. At last she found words\nto begin her story, and before she went to bed, she had made a\nclean breast of it and told everything--everything, that is, as to\nthe lovers she had rejected: of Mr Arabin she said not a word.\n\n'I know I was wrong,' said she, speaking of the blow she had given\nto Mr Slope; 'but I didn't know what he might do, and I had to\nprotect myself.'\n\n'He richly deserved it,' said Mary.\n\n'Deserved it!' said Eleanor, whose mind as regarded Mr Slope was\nalmost bloodthirsty. 'Had I stabbed him with a dagger, he would\nhave deserved it. But what will they say about it at Plumstead?'\n\n'I don't think I should tell them,' said Mary. Eleanor began to\nthink that she would not.\n\nThere could have been no kinder comforter than Mary Bold. There was\nnot the slightest dash of triumph about her when she heard of the\nStanhope scheme, nor did she allude to her former opinion when\nEleanor called her late friend Charlotte a base, designing woman.\nShe re-echoed all the abuse that was heaped on Mr Slope's head, and\nnever hinted that she had said as much before. 'I told you so! I\ntold you so!' is the croak of a true Job's comforter. But Mary,\nwhen she found her friend lying in her sorrow and scraping herself\nwith potsherds, forbore to argue and to exult. Eleanor acknowledged\nthe merit of the forbearance, and at length allowed herself to be\ntranquillised.\n\nOn the next day she did not go out of the house. Barchester she\nthought would be crowded with Stanhopes and Slopes; perhaps also\nwith Arabins and Grantlys. Indeed there was hardly any one among\nher friends whom she could have met, without some cause of\nuneasiness.\n\nIn the course of the afternoon she heard that the dean was dead;\nand she also heard that Mr Quiverful had been finally appointed to\nthe hospital.\n\nIn the evening her father came to her, and then the story, or as\nmuch of it as she could bring herself to tell him, had to be\nrepeated. He was not in truth much surprised at Mr Slope's\neffrontery; but he was obliged to act as though he had been, to\nsave his daughter's feelings. He was, however, anything but skilful\nin his deceit, and she saw through it.\n\n'I see,' said she, 'that you think it only the common course of\nthings that Mr Slope should have treated me in this way.'\n\nShe had said nothing to him about the embrace, nor yet of the way\nin which it had been met.\n\n'I do not think it at all strange,' said he, 'that any one should\nadmire my Eleanor.'\n\n'It is strange to me,' said she, 'that any man should have so much\naudacity, without ever having received the slightest\nencouragement.'\n\nTo this Mr Harding answered nothing. With the archdeacon it would\nhave been the text for a rejoinder, which would not have disgraced\nBildad the Shuhite.\n\n'But you'll tell the archdeacon,' asked Mr Harding.\n\n'Tell him what?' said she sharply.\n\n'Or Susan?' continued Mr Harding. 'You'll tell Susan; you'll let\nthem know that they wronged you in supposing that this man's\naddresses would be agreeable to you.'\n\n'They may find out their own way,' said she; 'I shall not ever\nwillingly mention Mr Slope's name to either of them.'\n\n'But I may.'\n\n'I have no right to hinder you from doing anything that may be\nnecessary to your own comfort, but pray do not do it for my sake.\nDr Grantly never thought well of me, and never will. I don't know\nnow that I an even anxious that he should do so.'\n\nAnd then they went to the affair of the hospital. 'But is it true,\npapa?'\n\n'What, my dear,' said he. 'About the dean? Yes, I fear quite true.\nIndeed, I know there is no doubt about it.'\n\n'Poor Miss Trefoil. I am so sorry for her. But I did not mean\nthat,' said Eleanor. 'But about the hospital, papa?\n\n'Yes, my dear. I believe it is true that Mr Quiverful is to have\nit.'\n\n'Oh, what a shame!'\n\n'No, my dear, not at all, not at all a shame: I am sure I hope it\nwill suit him.'\n\n'But, papa, you know it is a shame. After all your hopes, all your\nexpectations to get back your old house, to see it given away in\nthis way to a perfect stranger!'\n\n'My dear, the bishop had a right to give it to whom he pleased.'\n\n'I deny that, papa. He had no such right. It is not as though you\nwere a candidate for a new piece of preferment. If the bishop has a\ngrain of justice--'\n\n'The bishop offered it to me on his terms, and as I did not like\nthe terms, I refused it. After that, I cannot complain.'\n\n'Terms! He had not right to make terms.'\n\n'I don't know about that; but it seems he had the power. But to\ntell you the truth, Nelly, I am as well satisfied as it is. When\nthe affair became the subject of angry discussion, I thoroughly\nwished to be rid of it altogether.'\n\n'But you did want to go back to the old house, papa. You told me so\nyourself.'\n\n'Yes, my child, I did. For a short time I did wish it. And I was\nfoolish in doing so. I am getting old now; and my chief worldly\nwish is for peace and rest. Had I gone back to the hospital, I\nshould have had the endless contentions with the bishop,\ncontentions with his chaplain, and contentions with the archdeacon.\nI am not up to this now, I am not able to meet such troubles; and\ntherefore I am not ill-pleased to find myself left to the little\nchurch of St Cuthbert's. I shall never starve,' added he, laughing\n'as long as you are here.'\n\n'But if you will come and live with me, papa?' she said earnestly,\ntaking him by both his hands. 'If you will do that, if you will\npromise that, I will own that you are right.'\n\n'I will dine with you to-day, at any rate.'\n\n'No, but live here altogether. Give up that close, odious little\nroom in High Street.'\n\n'My dear, it's a very nice little room; and you are really quite\nuncivil.'\n\n'Oh, papa, don't joke. It's not a nice place for you. You say you\nare growing old, though I am sure you are not.'\n\n'Am I not, my dear?'\n\n'No, papa, not old--not to say old. But you are quite old enough to\nfeel the want of a decent room to sit in. You know how lonely Mary\nand I are here. You know nobody ever sleeps in the big front\nbed-room. It is really unkind of you to remain there alone, when\nyou are so much wanted here.'\n\n'Thank you, Nelly--thank you. But, my dear--'\n\n'If you had been living here, papa, with us, as I really think you\nought to have done, considering how lonely we are, there would have\nbeen none of all this dreadful affair about Mr Slope.'\n\nMr Harding, however, did not allow himself to be talked over into\ngiving up his own and only little pied a terre in the High Street.\nHe promised to come and dine with his daughter, and stay with her,\nand visit her, and do everything but absolutely live with her. It\ndid not suit the peculiar feelings of the man to tell his daughter\nthat though she had rejected Mr Slope, and been ready to reject Mr\nStanhope, some other more favoured suitor would probably soon\nappear; and that on the appearance of such a suitor the big front\nbed-room might perhaps be more frequently in requisition than at\npresent. But doubtless such an idea crossed his mind, and added its\nweight to the other reasons which made him decide on still keeping\nthe close, odious little room in High Street.\n\nThe evening passed over quietly and in comfort. Eleanor was always\nhappier with her father than with any one else. He had not,\nperhaps, any natural taste for baby-worship, but he was always\nready to sacrifice himself, and therefore made an excellent third\nin a trio with his daughter and Mary Bold in singing the praises of\nthe wonderful child.\n\nThey were standing together over their music in the evening, the\nbaby having again been put to bed upon the sofa, when the servant\nbrought in a very small note in a beautiful pink envelope. It quite\nfilled the room with perfume as it lay upon the small salver. Mary\nBold and Mrs Bold were both at the piano, and Mr Harding was\nsitting close to them, with the violoncello between his legs; so\nthat the elegance of the epistle was visible to them all.\n\n'Please, ma'am, Dr Stanhope's coachman says he is to wait for an\nanswer,' said the servant.\n\nEleanor got very red in the face as she took the note in her hand.\nShe had never seen the writing before. Charlotte's epistles, to\nwhich she was well accustomed, were of a very different style and\nkind. She generally wrote on large note-paper; she twisted up her\nletter into the shape and sometimes into the size of cocked hats;\nshe addressed them in a sprawling manly hand, and not unusually\nadded a blot or a smudge, as though such were her own peculiar\nsign-manual. The address of this note was written in a beautiful\nfemale hand, and the gummed wafer bore on it an impress of a gilt\ncoronet. Though Eleanor had never seen such a one before, she\nguessed that it came from the signora. Such epistles were very\nnumerously sent out from any house in which the signora might\nhappen to be dwelling, but they were rarely addressed to ladies.\nWhen the coachman was told by the lady's maid to take the letter to\nMrs Bold, he openly expressed his opinion that there was some\nmistake about it. Whereupon the lady's maid boxed the coachman's\nears. Had Mr Slope seen in how meek a spirit the coachman took the\nrebuke, he might have learnt a useful lesson, both in philosophy\nand religion.\n\nThe note was as follows. It may be taken as a faithful promise that\nno further letter whatever shall be transcribed at length in these\npages.\n\n'My dear Mrs Bold--May I ask you, as a great favour, to call on me\nto-morrow? You can say what hour will best suit you; but quite\nearly, if you can. I need hardly say that if I could call upon you\nI should not take this liberty with you.\n\n'I partly know what occurred the other day, and I promise you that\nyou shall meet with no annoyance if you will come to me. My brother\nleaves us for London to-day; from thence he goes to Italy.\n\n'It will probably occur to you that I should not thus intrude on\nyou, unless I had that to say to you which may be of considerable\nmoment. Pray therefore excuse me, even if you do not grant my\nrequest, and believe me, 'Very sincerely yours, M.VESEY NERONI\n\nThe three of them sat in consultation on this epistle for some ten\nor fifteen minutes, and then decided that Eleanor should write a\nline saying that she would see the signora the next morning, at\ntwelve o'clock.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV\n\nTHE STANHOPES AT HOME\n\nWe must now return to the Stanhopes, and see how they behaved\nthemselves on their return from Ullathorne.\n\nCharlotte, who came back in the first homeward journey with her\nsister, waited in palpitating expectation till the carriage drove\nup to the door a second time. She did not run down or stand at the\nwindow, or show in any outward manner that she looked for anything\nwonderful to occur; but, when she heard the carriage-wheels, she\nstood up with erect ears, listening for Eleanor's footfall on the\npavement or the cheery sound of Bertie's voice welcoming her in.\nHad she heard either, she would have felt that all was right; but\nneither sound was there for her to hear. She heard only her\nfather's slow step, as he ponderously let himself down from the\ncarriage, and slowly walked along the hall, till he got into his\nown private room on the ground floor. 'Send Miss Stanhope to me,'\nhe said to the servant.\n\n'There's something wrong now,' said Madeline, who was lying on her\nsofa in the back drawing-room.\n\n'It's all up with Bertie,' replied Charlotte. 'I know, I know,' she\nsaid to the servant, as he brought up the message. 'Tell my father\nI will be with him immediately.'\n\n'Bertie's wooing gone astray,' said Madeline. 'I knew it would.'\n\n'It has been his own fault then. She was ready enough. I am quite\nsure,' said Charlotte, with that sort of ill-nature which is not\nuncommon when one woman speaks of another.\n\n'What will you say to him now?' By 'him' the signora meant their\nfather.\n\n'That will be as I find him. He was ready to pay two hundred pounds\nfor Bertie, to stave off the worst of his creditors, if this\nmarriage had gone on. Bertie must now have the money instead, and\ngo and take his chances.'\n\n'Where is he now?'\n\n'Heaven knows! Smoking at the bottom of Mr Thorne's ha-ha, or\nphilandering with some of those Miss Chadwicks. Nothing will ever\nmake an impression on him. But he'll be furious if I don't go\ndown.'\n\n'No; nothing ever will. But don't be long, Charlotte, for I want my\ntea.'\n\nAnd so Charlotte went down to her father. There was a very black\ncloud on the old man's brow; blacker than his daughter could ever\nremember to have seen there. He was sitting in his own arm-chair,\nnot comfortably over the fire, but in the middle of the room,\nwaiting till she should come and listen to him.\n\n'What has become of your brother?' he said, as soon as the door was\nshut.\n\n'I should rather ask you,' said Charlotte. 'I left you both at\nUllathorne, when I came away. What have you done with Mrs Bold?'\n\n'Mrs Bold! nonsense. The woman has gone home as she ought to do.\nAnd heartily glad I am that she should not be sacrificed to so\nheartless a reprobate.'\n\n'Oh, papa!'\n\n'A heartless reprobate! Tell me now where he is, and what he is\ngoing to do. I have allowed myself to be fooled between you.\nMarriage indeed! Who on earth that has money, or credit, or respect\nin the world to lose, would marry him?'\n\n'It is no use your scolding me, papa. I have done the best I could\nfor him and you.'\n\n'And Madeline is nearly as bad,' said the prebendary, who was in\ntruth, very, very angry.\n\n'Oh, I suppose we are all bad,' replied Charlotte.\n\nThe old man emitted a huge leonine sigh. If they were all bad, who\nhad made them so? If they were unprincipled, selfish, and\ndisreputable, who was to be blamed for the education which had had\nso injurious an effect.\n\n'I know you'll ruin me among you,' said he.\n\n'Why, papa, what nonsense that is. You are living within your\nincome this minute, and if there are any new debts, I don't know of\nthem. I am sure there ought to be none, for we are dull enough\nhere.'\n\n'Are those bills of Madeline's paid?'\n\n'No, they are not. Who was to pay them?'\n\n'Her husband may pay them.'\n\n'Her husband! Would you wish me to tell her you say so? Do you wish\nto turn her out of your home?'\n\n'I wish she would know how to behave herself.'\n\n'Why, what on earth has she done now? Poor Madeline! To-day is only\nthe second time she has gone out since we came to this vile town.'\n\nHe then sat silent for a time, thinking in what shape he would\ndeclare his resolve. 'Well, papa,' said Charlotte, 'shall I stay\nhere, or may I go up-stairs and give mamma her tea?'\n\n'You are in your brother's confidence. Tell me what he is going to\ndo?'\n\n'Nothing, that I am aware of.'\n\n'Nothing--nothing! Nothing but eat and drink, and spend every\nshilling of my money he can lay his hands upon. I have made up my\nmind, Charlotte. He shall eat and drink no more in this house.'\n\n'Very well. Then I suppose he must go back to Italy.'\n\n'He may go where he pleases.'\n\n'That's easily said, papa; but what does it mean? You can't let him\nlive--'\n\n'It means this,' said the doctor, speaking more loudly than was his\nwont, and with wrath flashing from his eyes; 'that as sure as God\nrules in heaven, I will not maintain him any longer in idleness.'\n\n'Oh, ruling in heaven!' said Charlotte. 'It is no use talking about\nthat. You must rule him here on earth; and the question is, how you\ncan do it. You can't turn him out of the house penniless, to beg\nabout the street.'\n\n'He may beg where he likes.'\n\n'He must go back to Carrara. That is the cheapest place he can live\nat, and nobody there will give him credit for above two or three\nhundred pauls. But you must let him have the means of going.'\n\n'As sure as--'\n\n'Oh papa, don't swear. You know you must do it. You were ready to\npay two hundred pounds for him if the marriage came off. Half that\nwill start him to Carrara.'\n\n'What? Give him a hundred pounds!'\n\n'You know we are all in the dark, papa,' said she, thinking it\nexpedient to change the conversation. 'For anything we know, he may\nbe at this moment engaged to Mrs Bold.'\n\n'Fiddlestick,' said the father, who had seen the way in which Mrs\nBold had got into the carriage, while his son stood apart without\neven offering her his hand.\n\n'Well, then, he must go to Carrara.' said Charlotte.\n\nJust at this moment the lock of the front door was heard, and\nCharlotte's quick care detected her brother's cat-like step in the\nhall. She said nothing, feeling that for the present Bertie had\nbetter keep out of her father's way. But Dr Stanhope also heard the\nsound of the lock.\n\n'Who's that?' he demanded. Charlotte made no reply, and he asked\nagain. 'Who is that that has just come in? Open the door. Who is\nit?'\n\n'I suppose it is Bertie.'\n\n'Bid him to come here,' said the father. But Bertie, who was close\nto the door and heard the call, required no further bidding, but\nwalked in with a perfectly unconcerned and cheerful air. It was\nthis peculiar insouciance which angered Dr Stanhope, even more than\nhis son's extravagance.\n\n'Well, sir,' said the doctor.\n\n'And how did you get home, sir, with your fair companion?' said\nBertie. 'I suppose she is not up-stairs, Charlotte?'\n\n'Bertie,' said Charlotte, 'papa is in no humour for joking. He is\nvery angry with you.'\n\n'Angry!' said Bertie, raising his eyebrows, as though he had never\nyet given his parent cause for a single moment's uneasiness.\n\n'Sit down, if you please, sir,' said Dr Stanhope very sternly, but\nnot now very loudly. 'And I'll trouble you to sit down, too,\nCharlotte. Your mother can wait for her tea a few minutes.'\n\nCharlotte sat down on the chair nearest the door, in somewhat of a\nperverse sort of manner; as much as though she would say--Well,\nhere I am; you shan't say I don't do as I am bid; but I'll be\nwhipped if I give way to you. And she was determined not to give\nway. She too was angry with Bertie; but she was not the less ready\non that account to defend him from his father. Bertie also sat\ndown. He drew his chair close to the library table, upon which he\nput his elbow, and then resting his face comfortably on one hand,\nhe began drawing little pictures on a sheet of paper with the\nother. Before the scene was over had had completed admirable\nfigures of Miss Thorne, Mrs Proudie, and Lady De Courcy, and began\na family piece to comprise the whole set of Lookalofts.\n\n'Would it suit you, sir,' said the father, 'to give me some idea as\nto what your present intentions are?--what way of living you\npropose to yourself?'\n\n'I'll do anything you suggest, sir,' said Bertie.\n\n'No, I shall suggest nothing further. My time for suggesting has\ngone by. I have only one order to give, and that is, that you leave\nmy house.'\n\n'To-night?' said Bertie; and the simple tone of the question left\nthe doctor without any adequately dignified method of reply.\n\n'Papa does not quite mean to-night,' said Charlotte, 'at least I\nsuppose not.'\n\n'To-morrow perhaps,' suggested Bertie.\n\n'Yes sir, to-morrow,' said the doctor. 'You shall leave this to-morrow.'\n\n'Very well, sir. Will the 4.30 P.M. train be soon enough?' said\nBertie, as he asked, put the finishing touch to Miss Thorne's\nhigh-heeled boots.\n\n'You may go how and when and where you please, so that you leave my\nhouse to-morrow. You have disgraced me, sir; you have disgraced\nyourself, and me, and your sisters.'\n\n'I am glad at least sir, that I have not disgraced my mother,' said\nBertie.\n\nCharlotte could hardly keep her countenance; but the doctor's brow\ngrew still blacker than ever. Bertie was executing his chef d'ouvre\nin the delineation of Mrs Proudie's nose and mouth.\n\n'You are a heartless reprobate, sir; a heartless, thankless,\ngood-for-nothing reprobate. I have done with you. You are my\nson--that I cannot help; but you shall have no more part or parcel\nin me as my child, nor I in you as your father.'\n\n'Oh, papa, papa! You must not, shall not say so,' said Charlotte.\n\n'I will say so, and do say so,' said the father, rising from his\nchair. 'And now leave the room, sir.'\n\n'Stop, stop,' said Charlotte; 'why don't you speak, Bertie? Why\ndon't you look up and speak? It is your manner that makes him so\nangry.'\n\n'He is perfectly indifferent to all decency, to all propriety,'\nsaid the doctor; and then he shouted out, 'Leave the room, sir! Do\nyou hear what I say?'\n\n'Papa, papa, I will not let you part so. I know you will be sorry\nfor it.' And then she added, getting up and whispering into his\near. 'Is he only to blame? Think of that. We have made our own bed,\nand, such as it is, we must lie on it. It is no use for us to\nquarrel among ourselves,' and as she finished her whisper, Bertie\nfinished off the countess's bustle, which was so well done that it\nabsolutely seemed to be swaying to and fro on the paper with its\nusual lateral motion.\n\n'My father is angry at the present time,' said Bertie, looking up\nfor a moment from his sketches, 'because I am not going to marry\nMrs Bold. What can I say on the matter? It is true that I am not\ngoing to marry her. In the first place--'\n\n'That is not true, sir,' said Dr Stanhope; 'but I will not argue\nwith you.'\n\n'You were angry just this moment because I would not speak,' said\nBertie, going on with a young Lookaloft.\n\n'Give over drawing,' said Charlotte, going up to him and taking the\npaper from under his hand. The caricature, however, she preserved,\nand showed them afterwards to the friends of the Thornes, the\nProudies, and De Courcys. Bertie, deprived of his occupation, threw\nhimself back in his chair and waited further orders.\n\n'I think it will certainly be for the best that Bertie should leave\nthis at once, perhaps to-morrow,' said Charlotte; 'but pray, papa,\nlet us arrange some scheme together.'\n\n'If he will leave to-morrow, I will give him L 10, and he shall be\npaid L 5 a month by the banker at Carrara as long as he stays\npermanently in that place.'\n\n'Well, sir! it won't be long,' said Bertie; 'for I shall be starved\nto death in about three months.'\n\n'He must have marble to work with,' said Charlotte.\n\n'I have plenty there in the studio to last me three months,' said\nBertie. 'It will be no use attempting anything large in so limited\na time; unless I do my own tombstone.'\n\nTerms, however, were ultimately come to, somewhat more liberal than\nthose proposed, and the doctor was induced to shake hands with his\nson, and bid him good-night. Dr Stanhope would not go up to tea,\nbut had it brought to him in his study by his daughter.\n\nBut Bertie went up-stairs and spent a pleasant evening. He finished\nthe Lookalofts, greatly to the delight of his sisters, though the\nmanner of portraying their decollete dresses was not the most\nrefined. Finding how matters were going, he by degrees allowed it\nto escape from him that he had not pressed his suit upon the widow\nin a very urgent way.\n\n'I suppose, in point of fact, you never proposed at all?' said\nCharlotte.\n\n'Oh, she understood that she might have me if she wished,' said he.\n\n'And she didn't wish,' said the signora.\n\n'You have thrown me over in the most shameful manner,' said\nCharlotte. 'I suppose you told her all about my little plan?'\n\n'Well, it came out somehow; at least the most of it.'\n\n'There's an end of that alliance,' said Charlotte; 'but it doesn't\nmatter much. I suppose we shall all be back in Como soon.'\n\n'I am sure I hope so,' said the signora; 'I'm sick of the sight of\nblack coats. If that Mr Slope comes here any more, he'll be the\ndeath of me.'\n\n'You've been the ruin of him, I think,' said Charlotte.\n\n'And as for a second black-coated lover of mine, I am going to make\na present to him of another lady with most singular\ndisinterestedness.'\n\nThe next day, true to his promise, Bertie packed up and went of by\nthe 4.30 P.M. train, with L 20 in his pocket, bound for the marble\nquarries of Carrara. And so he disappears from our scene.\n\nAt twelve o'clock on the day following that on which Bertie went,\nMrs Bold, true also to her word, knocked at Dr Stanhope's door with\na timid hand and palpitating heart. She was at once shown up to the\nback drawing-room, the folding doors of which were closed, so that\nin visiting the signora, Eleanor was not necessarily thrown into\nany communication with those in the front room. As she went up the\nstairs, she none of the family, and was so far saved much of the\nannoyance which she had dreaded.\n\n'This is very kind of you, Mrs Bold; very kind, after what has\nhappened,' said the lady on the sofa with her sweetest smile.\n\n'You wrote in such a strain that I could not but come to you.'\n\n'I did, I did; I wanted to force you to see me.'\n\n'Well, signora; I am here.'\n\n'How cold you are to me. But I suppose I must put up with that. I\nknow you think you have reason to be displeased with us all. Poor\nBertie! if you knew all, you would not be angry with him.'\n\n'I am not angry with your brother--not in the least. But I hope you\ndid not send for me to talk about him.'\n\n'If you are angry with Charlotte, that is worse; for you have no\nwarmer friend in all Barchester. But I did not send for you to talk\nabout this--pray bring your chair nearer, Mrs Bold, so that I may\nlook at you. It is so unnatural to see you keeping so far off from\nme.'\n\nEleanor did as she was bid, and brought her chair closer to the\nsofa.\n\n'And now, Mrs Bold, I am going to tell you something which you may\nthink indelicate; but yet I know that I am right in doing so.'\n\nHereupon Mrs Bold said nothing, but felt inclined to shake in her\nchair. The signora, she knew, was not very particular, and that\nwhich to her appeared to be indelicate might to Mrs Bold appear to\nbe extremely indecent.\n\n'I believe you know Mr Arabin?'\n\nMrs Bold would have given the world not to blush, but her blood was\nnot at her own command. She did blush up to her forehead, and the\nsignora, who had made her sit in a special light in order that she\nmight watch her, saw that she did so.\n\n'Yes--I am acquainted with him. That is, slightly. He is an\nintimate friend of Dr Grantly, and Dr Grantly is my\nbrother-in-law.'\n\n'Well; if you know Mr Arabin, I am sure you must like him. I know\nand like him much. Everybody that knows him must like him.'\n\nMrs Bold felt it quite impossible to say anything in reply to this.\nHer blood was rushing about her body she knew not how or why. She\nfelt as though she were swinging in her chair; and she knew that\nshe was not only red in the face, but also almost suffocated with\nheat. However, she sat still and said nothing.\n\n'How stiff you are with me, Mrs Bold,' said the signora; 'and I the\nwhile am doing for you all that one woman can do to serve another.'\n\nA kind of thought came over the widow's mind that perhaps the\nsignora's friendship was real; and that at any rate it could not\nhurt her; and another kind of thought, a glimmering of a thought,\ncame to her also,--that Mr Arabin was to precious to be lost. She\ndespised the signora; but might she not stoop to conquer? It should\nbe but the smallest fraction of a stoop!\n\n'I don't want to be stiff,' she said, 'but your questions are so\nvery singular.'\n\n'Well, then, I will ask you one more singular still,' said Madeline\nNeroni, raising herself on her elbow and turning her own face full\nupon her companion's. 'Do you love him, love him with all your\nheart and soul, with all the love your bosom can feel? For I can\ntell you that he loves you, worships you, thinks of you and nothing\nelse, is now thinking of you as he attempts to write his sermon for\nnext Sunday's preaching. What would I not give to be loved in such\na way by such a man, that is, if I were an object for any man to\nlove!'\n\nMrs Bold got up from her seat and stood speechless before the woman\nwho was now addressing her in this impassioned way. When the\nsignora thus alluded to herself, the widow's heart was softened,\nand she put her own hand, as though caressingly, on that of her\ncompanion which was resting on the table. The signora grasped it\nand went on speaking.\n\n'What I tell you is God's own truth; and it is for you to use it as\nmay be best for your own happiness. But you must not betray me. He\nknows nothing of this. He knows nothing of my knowing his inmost\nheart. He is simple as a child in these matters. He told me his\nsecret in a thousand ways because he could not dissemble; but he\ndoes not dream that has told it. You know it now, and I advise you\nto use it.'\n\nEleanor returned the pressure of the other's hand with an\ninfinitesimal soupcon of a squeeze.\n\n'And remember,' said the signora, 'he is not like other men.\n You must not expect him to come to you with vows and oaths and\npretty presents, to kneel at your feet, and kiss your shoe-strings.\nIf you want that, there are plenty to do it; but he won't be one of\nthem.' Eleanor's bosom nearly burst with a sigh; but Madeline, not\nheeding her, went on. 'With him, yea will stand for yea, and nay\nfor nay. Though his heart should break for it, the woman who shall\nreject him once, will have rejected him once and for all. Remember\nthat. And now, Mrs Bold, I will not keep you, for you are\nflattered. I partly guess what use you will make of what I have\nsaid to you. If ever you are a happy wife in that man's house, we\nshall be far away; but I shall expect you to write me one line to\nsay that you have forgiven the sins of the family.'\n\nEleanor half whispered that she would, and then without uttering\nanother word, crept out of the room, and down the stairs, opened\nthe front door for herself without hearing or seeing any one, and\nfound herself in the close.\n\nIt would be difficult to analyse Eleanor's feelings as she walked\nhome. She was nearly stupefied by the things that had been said to\nher. She felt sore that her heart should have been so searched and\nriddled by a comparative stranger, by a woman whom she had never\nliked and never could like. She was mortified that the man whom she\nowned to herself that she loved should have concealed his love from\nher and shown it to another. There was much to vex her proud\nspirit. But there was, nevertheless, an under-stratum of joy in all\nthis which buoyed her up wondrously. She tried if she could\ndisbelieve what Madame Neroni had said to her; but she found that\nshe could not. It was true; it must be true. She could not, would\nnot, did not doubt it.\n\nOn one point she fully resolved to follow the advice given her. If\nit should ever please Mr Arabin to put such a question to her as\nsuggested, her 'yea' should be 'yea'. Would not all her miseries be\nat an end, if she could talk of them to him openly, with her hand\nresting on his shoulder?\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI\n\nMR SLOPE'S PARTING INTERVIEW WITH THE SIGNORA\n\nOn the following day the signora was in her pride. She was dressed\nin her brightest of morning dresses, and had quite a levee round\nher couch. It was a beautifully bright October afternoon; all the\ngentlemen of the neighbourhood were in Barchester, and those who\nhad the entry of Dr Stanhope's house were in the signora's back\ndrawing-room. Charlotte and Mrs Stanhope were in the front room,\nand such of the lady's squires as could not for the moment get near\nthe centre of attraction had to waste their fragrance on the mother\nand sister.\n\nThe first who came and the last to leave was Mr Arabin. This was\nthe second visit he had paid to Madame Neroni since he had met her\nat Ullathorne. He came he knew not why, to talk about he knew not\nwhat. But, in truth, the feelings which now troubled him were new\nto him, and he could not analyse them. It may seem strange that he\nshould thus come dangling about Madame Neroni because he was in\nlove with Mrs Bold; but it was nevertheless the fact; and though he\ncould not understand why he did so, Madame Neroni understood it\nwell enough.\n\nShe had been gentle and kind to him, and had encouraged his\nstaying. Therefore he stayed on. She pressed his hand when he first\ngreeted her; and whispered to him little nothings. And then her\neye, brilliant and bright, now mirthful, now melancholy, and\ninvincible in either way! What man with warm feelings, blood\nunchilled, and a heat not guarded by a triple steel of experience\ncould have withstood those eyes! The lady, it is true, intended to\ndo no mortal injury; she merely chose to inhale a slight breath of\nincense before she handed the casket over to another. Whether Mrs\nBold would willingly have spared even so much is another question.\n\nAnd then came Mr Slope. All the world now knew that Mr Slope was a\ncandidate for the deanery, and that he was generally considered to\nbe the favourite. Mr Slope, therefore, walked rather largely upon\nthe earth. He gave to himself a portly air, such as might become a\ndean, spoke but little to other clergymen, and shunned the bishop\nas much as possible. How the meagre little prebendary, and the\nburly chancellor, and all the minor canons and vicars choral, ay,\nand all the choristers too, cowered and shook and walked about with\nlong faces when they read or heard of that article of the Jupiter.\nNow were coming the days when nothing would avail to keep the\nimpure spirit from the cathedral pulpit. That pulpit would indeed\nbe his own. Precentors, vicars, and choristers might hang up their\nharps on the willows. Ichabod! Ichabod! The glory of their house\nwas departing from them.\n\nMr Slope, great as he was with embryo grandeur, still came to see\nthe signora. Indeed, he could not keep himself away. He dreamed of\nthat soft hand which had kissed so often, and of the imperial brow\nwhich his lips had once pressed, and he then dreamed also of\nfurther favours.\n\nAnd Mr Thorne was there also. It was the first visit he had ever\npaid to the signora, and he made it not without due preparation. Mr\nThorne was a gentleman usually precise in his dress, and prone to\nmake the most of himself in an unpretending way. The grey hairs in\nhis whiskers were eliminated perhaps once a month; those on his\nhead were softened by a mixture which we will not call a dye; it\nwas only a wash. His tailor lived in St James's Street, and his\nbootmaker at the corner of that street and Piccadilly. He was\nparticular in the article of gloves, and the getting up of his\nshirts was a matter not lightly thought of in the Ullathorne\nlaundry. On the occasion of the present visit he had rather\noverdone his usual efforts, and caused some little uneasiness to\nhis sister, who had not hitherto received very cordially the\nproposition for a lengthened visit from the signora at Ullathorne.\n\nThere were others also there--young men about the city who had not\nmuch to do, and who were induced by the lady's charms to neglect\nthat little; but all gave way to Mr Thorne, who was somewhat of a\ngrand signor, as a country gentleman always is in a provincial\ncity.\n\n'Oh, Mr Thorne, this is so kind of you!' said the signora. 'You\npromised to come; but I really did not expect it. I thought you\ncountry gentlemen never kept your pledges.'\n\n'Oh, yea, sometimes,' said Mr Thorne, looking rather sheepish, and\nmaking salutations a little too much in the style of the last\ncentury.\n\n'You deceive none but your consti-stit-stit; what do you call the\npeople that carry you about in chairs and pelt you with eggs and\napples when they make you a member of parliament?'\n\n'One another also, sometimes, signora,' said Mr Slope, with a\ndeanish sort of smirk on his face. 'Country gentlemen do deceive\none another sometimes, don't they, Mr Thorne?'\n\nMr Thorne gave him a look which undressed him completely for the\nmoment; but he soon remembered his high hopes, and recovering\nhimself quickly, sustained his probable coming dignity by a laugh\nat Mr Thorne's expense.\n\n'I never deceive a lady, at any rate,' said Mr Thorne; 'especially\nwhen the gratification of my own wishes is so strong an inducement\nto keep me true, as it now is.'\n\nMr Thorne went on thus awhile, with antediluvian grimaces and\ncompliments which he had picked up from Sir Charles Grandison, and\nthe signora at every grimace and at every bow smiled a little smile\nand bowed a little bow. Mr Thorne, however, was kept standing at\nthe foot of the couch, for the new dean sat in the seat of honour\nnear the table. Mr Arabin the while was standing with his back to\nthe fire, his coat tails under his arms, gazing at her with all his\neyes--not quite in vain, for every now and again a glance came up\nat him, bright as a meteor out of heaven.\n\n'Oh, Mr Thorne, you promised to let me introduce my little girl to\nyou. Can you spare a moment?--will you see her now?'\n\nMr Thorne assured her that he could, and would see the young lady\nwith the greatest pleasure in life. 'Mr Slope, might I trouble you\nto ring the bell?' said she; and when Mr Slope got up she looked at\nMr Thorne and pointed to the chair. Mr Thorne, however, was much\ntoo slow to understand her, and Mr Slope would have recovered his\nseat had not the signora, who never chose to be unsuccessful,\nsomewhat summarily ordered him out of it.\n\n'Oh, Mr Slope, I must ask you to let Mr Thorne sit here just for a\nmoment or two. I am sure you will pardon me. We can take a liberty\nwith you this week. Next week, you know, when you move into the\ndean's house, we shall all be afraid of you.'\n\nMr Slope, with an air of much indifference, rose from his seat,\nand, walking into the next room, became greatly interested in Mrs\nStanhope's worsted work.\n\nAnd then the child was brought in. She was a little girl, about\neight years of age, like her mother, only that her enormous eyes\nwere black, and her hair quite jet. Her complexion too was very\ndark, and bespoke her foreign blood. She was dressed in the most\noutlandish and extravagant way in which clothes could be put on a\nchild's back. She had great bracelets on her naked little arms, a\ncrimson fillet braided with gold round her head, and scarlet shoes\nwith high heels. Her dress was all flounces, and stuck out from\nher as though the object were to make it lie off horizontally from\nher little hips. It did not nearly cover her knees; but this was\natoned for by a loose pair of drawers which seemed made throughout\nof lace; then she had on pink silk stockings. It was thus that the\nlast of the Neros was habitually dressed at the hour when visitors\nwere wont to call.\n\n'Julia, my love,' said the mother,--Julia was ever a favourite name\nwith the ladies of the family, 'Julia, my love, come here. I was\ntelling you about the beautiful party poor mamma went to. This is\nMr Thorne; will you give him a kiss, dearest?'\n\nJulia put up her face to be kissed, as she did to all her mother's\nvisitors; and then Mr Thorne found that he had got her, and, which\nwas much more terrible to him, all her finery, into his arms. The\nlace and starch crumpled against his waistcoat and trousers, the\ngreasy black curls hung upon his cheek, and one of the bracelet\nclasps scratched his ear. He did not at all know how to hold her.\nHowever, he had on other occasions been compelled to fondle little\nnieces and nephews, and now set about the task in the mode he always\nused.\n\n'Diddle, diddle, diddle, diddle,' said he, putting the child on one\nknee, and working away with it as though he were turning a\nknife-grinder's wheel with his foot.\n\n'Mamma, mamma,' said Julia, crossly. 'I don't want to be diddle\ndiddled. Let me go, you naughty old man, you.'\n\nPoor Mr Thorne put the child down quietly on the ground, and drew\nback his chair; Mr Slope, who had returned to the pole star that\nattracted him, laughed aloud; Mr Arabin winced and shut his eyes;\nand the signora pretended not to hear her daughter.\n\n'Go to Aunt Charlotte, lovey,' said the mamma, 'and ask her it if\nis not time for you to go out.'\n\nBut little Julia, though she had not exactly liked the nature of Mr\nThorne's attention, was accustomed to be played with by gentlemen,\nand did not relish the idea of being sent so soon to her aunt.\n\n'Julia, go when I tell you, my dear.' But Julia still went pouting\nabout the room. 'Charlotte, do come and take her,' said the\nsignora. 'She must go out; and the days get so short now.' And thus\nended the much-talked of interview between Mr Thorne and the last\nof the Neros.\n\nMr Thorne recovered from the child's crossness sooner than from Mr\nSlope's laughter. He could put up with being called an old man by\nan infant, but he did not like to be laughed at by the bishop's\nchaplain, even though that chaplain was about to become a dean. He\nsaid nothing, but he showed plainly enough that he was angry.\n\nThe signora was ready enough to avenge him. 'Mr Slope,' said she,\n'I hear that you are triumphing on all sides.'\n\n'How so,' said he smiling. He did not dislike being talked to about\nthe deanery, though, of course, he strongly denied the imputation.\n\n'You carry the day both in love and war.' Mr Slope hereupon did not\nlook quite so satisfied as he had done.\n\n'Mr Arabin,' continued the signora, 'don't you think Mr Slope is a\nvery lucky man?'\n\n'Not more than he deserves, I am sure,' said Mr Arabin.\n\n'Only think, Mr Thorne, he is to be our new dean; of course we all\nknow that.'\n\n'Indeed, signora,' said Mr Slope, 'we all know nothing about it. I\ncan assure you I myself--'\n\n'He is to be the new dean--there is no manner of doubt of it, Mr\nThorne.'\n\n'Hum,' said Mr Thorne.\n\n'Passing over the heads of old men like my father and Archdeacon\nGrantly--'\n\n'Oh--oh!' said Mr Slope.\n\n'The archdeacon would not accept it,' said Mr Arabin; whereupon Mr\nSlope smiled abominably, and said, as plainly as a look could\nspeak, that the grapes were sour.\n\n'Going over all our heads,' continued the signora; 'for, of course,\nI consider myself one of the chapter.'\n\n'If I am ever dean,' said Mr Slope--'that is, were I ever to become\nso, I should glory in such a canoness.'\n\n'Oh, Mr Slope, stop; I haven't half done. There is another canoness\nfor you to glory in. Mr Slope is not only to have the deanery, but\na wife to put in it.'\n\nMr Slope again looked disconcerted.\n\n'A wife with a large fortune, too. It never rains but it pours,\ndoes it Mr Thorne?'\n\n'No, never,' said Mr Thorne, who did not quite relish talking about\nMr Slope and his affairs.\n\n'When will it be, Mr Slope?'\n\n'When will what be?' said he.\n\n'Oh! we know when the affair of the dean will be: a week will\nsettle that. The new hat, I have no doubt, has already been\nordered. But when will the marriage come off?'\n\n'Do you mean mine or Mr Arabin's,' said he, striving to be\nfacetious.\n\n'Well, just then I meant yours, though perhaps, after all, Mr\nArabin's may be first. But we know nothing of him. He is too close\nfor any of us. Now all is open and above board with you; which, by\nthe bye, Mr Arabin, I beg to tell you I like much the best. He who\nruns can read that Mr Slope is a favoured lover. Come, Mr Slope,\nwhen is the widow to be made Mrs Dean?'\n\nTo Mr Arabin this badinage was peculiarly painful; and yet he could\nnot tear himself away and leave it. He believed, still believed\nwith that sort of belief which the fear of a thing engenders, that\nMrs Bold would probably become the wife of Mr Slope. Of Mr Slope's\nlittle adventure in the garden he knew nothing. For aught he knew,\nMr Slope might have had an adventure of quite a different\ncharacter. He might have thrown himself at the widow's feet, been\naccepted, and then returned to town a jolly, thriving wooer. The\nsignora's jokes were bitter enough to Mr Slope, but they were quite\nas bitter to Mr Arabin. He still stood leaning against the\nfire-place, fumbling with his hands in his trouser's pockets.\n\n'Come, come, Mr Slope, don't be so bashful,' continued the signora.\n'We all know that you proposed to the lady the other day at\nUllathorne. Tell us with what words she accepted you. Was it with a\nsimple \"yes\", or with two \"no, no's\", which makes an affirmative?\nor did silence give consent: or did she speak out with that spirit\nwhich so well becomes a widow, and say openly, \"By my troth, sir,\nyou shall make me Mrs Slope as soon as it is your pleasure to do\nso\"?'\n\nMr Slope had seldom in his life felt himself less at his case.\nThere sat Mr Thorne, laughing silently. There stood his old\nantagonist, Mr Arabin, gazing at him with all his eyes. There round\nthe door between the two rooms were clustered a little group of\npeople, including Miss Stanhope and the Rev. Messrs. Gray and\nGreen, all listening to his discomfiture. He knew that it depended\nsolely on his own wit whether or no he could throw the joke back\nupon the lady. He knew that it stood him to do so if he possibly\ncould; but he said not a word. ''Tis conscience that makes cowards\nof us all.' He felt on his cheek the sharp points of Eleanor's\nfingers, and did not know who might have seen the blow, who might\nhave told the tale to this pestilent woman who took such delight in\njeering him. He stood there, therefore, red as a carbuncle and mute\nas a fish; grinning just sufficiently to show his teeth; an object\nof pity.\n\nBut the signora had no pity; she knew nothing of mercy. Her present\nobject was to put Mr Slope down, and she was determined to do it\nthoroughly, now that she had him in her power.\n\n'What, Mr Slope, no answer? Why it can't possibly be that this\nwoman has been fool enough to refuse you? She surely can't be\nlooking out after a bishop. But I see how it is, Mr Slope. Widows\nare proverbially cautious. You should have let her alone till the\nnew hat was on your head; till you could show her the key of the\ndeanery.'\n\n'Signora,' said he at last, trying to speak in a tone of dignified\nreproach, 'you really permit yourself to talk on such solemn\nsubjects in a very improper way.'\n\n'Solemn subjects--what solemn subjects? Surely a dean's hat is not\nsuch a solemn subject.'\n\n'I have no aspirations such as those you impute to me. Perhaps you\nwill drop the subject.'\n\n'Oh, certainly, Mr Slope; but one word first. Go to her again with\nthe prime minister's letter in your pocket. I'll wager my shawl to\nyour shovel she does not refuse you then.'\n\n'I must say, signora, that I think you are speaking of the lady in\na very unjustifiable manner.'\n\n'And one other piece of advice, Mr Slope; I'll only offer you one\nother;' and then she commenced singing--\n\n'It's gude to be merry and wise, Mr Slope, It's gude to be honest\nand true; It's gude to be off with the old love, Mr Slope, Before\nyou are on with the new--\n\n'Ha, ha, ha!'\n\nAnd the signora, throwing herself back on her sofa, laughed\nmerrily. She little recked how those who heard her would, in their\nown imagination, fill up the little history of Mr Slope's first\nlove. She little cared that some among them might attribute to her\nthe honour of his earlier admiration. She was tired of Mr Slope and\nwanted to get rid of him; she had ground for anger with him, and\nshe chose to be revenged.\n\nHow Mr Slope got out of that room he never himself knew. He did\nsucceed ultimately, and probably with some assistance, in getting\nhim his had and escaping into the air. At last his love for the\nsignora was cured. Whenever he again thought of her in his dreams,\nit was not as of an angel with azure wings. He connected her rather\nwith fire and brimstone, and though he could still believe her to\nbe a spirit, he banished her entirely out of heaven, and found a\nplace for her among the infernal gods. When he weighed in the\nbalance, as he not seldom did, the two women to whom he had\nattached himself in Barchester, the pre-eminent place in his soul's\nhatred was usually allotted to the signora.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII\n\nTHE DEAN ELECT\n\nDuring the entire next week Barchester was ignorant who was to be\nits new dean on Sunday morning. Mr Slope was decidedly the\nfavourite; but he did not show himself in the cathedral, and then\nhe sank a point or two in the betting. On Monday, he got a scolding\nfrom the bishop in the hearing of the servants, and down he went\ntill nobody would have him at any price; but on Tuesday he received\na letter, in an official cover, marked private, by which he fully\nrecovered his place in the public favour. On Wednesday, he was said\nto be ill, and that did not look well; but on Thursday morning he\nwent down to the railway station, with a very jaunty air; and when\nit was ascertained that he had taken a first-class ticket for\nLondon, there was no longer any room for doubt on the matter.\n\nWhile matters were in this state of ferment at Barchester, there\nwas not much mental comfort at Plumstead. Our friend the archdeacon\nhad many grounds for inward grief. He was much displeased at the\nresult of Dr Gwynne's diplomatic mission to the palace, and did not\neven scruple to say to his wife that had he gone himself he would\nhave managed the affair much better. His wife did not agree with\nhim, but that did not mend the matter.\n\nMr Quiverful's appointment to the hospital was, however, a fait\naccompli, and Mr Harding's acquiescence in that appointment was not\nless so. Nothing would induce Mr Harding to make a public appeal\nagainst the bishop; and the Master of Lazarus quite approved of his\nnot doing so.\n\n'I don't know what has come to the Master,' said the archdeacon\nover and over again. 'He used to be ready enough to stand up for\nhis order.'\n\n'My dear archdeacon,' Mrs Grantly would say in reply, 'what is the\nuse of always fighting? I really think the Master is right.' The\nMaster, however, had taken steps of his own, of which neither the\narchdeacon nor his wife knew anything.\n\n'Then Mr Slope's successes were henbane to Dr Grantly; and Mrs\nBold's improprieties were as bad. What would be all the world to\nArchdeacon Grantly if Mr Slope should become the Dean of Barchester\nand marry his wife's sister! He talked of it, and talked of it till\nhe was nearly ill. Mrs Grantly almost wished that the marriage was\ndone and over, so that she might hear no more about it.\n\nAnd there was yet another ground of misery which cut him to the\nquick, nearly as closely as either of the two others. That paragon\nof a clergyman, whom he had bestowed upon St Ewold's, that college\nfriend of whom he had boasted so loudly, that ecclesiastical knight\nbefore whose lance Mr Slope was to fall and bite the dust, that\nworthy bulwark of the church as it should be, that honoured\nrepresentative of Oxford's best spirit, was--so at least his wife\nhad told him half a dozen times--misconducting himself!\n\nNothing had been seen of Mr Arabin at Plumstead for the last week,\nbut a good deal had, unfortunately, been heard of him.\n As soon as Mrs Grantly had found herself alone with the\narchdeacon, on the evening of the Ullathorne party, she had\nexpressed herself very forcibly as to Mr Arabin's conduct on that\noccasion. He had, she declared, looked and acted and talked very\nunlike a decent parish clergyman. At first the archdeacon had\nlaughed at this, and assured her that she need not trouble herself;\nthat Mr Arabin would be found to be quite safe. But by degrees he\nbegan to find out that his wife's eyes had been sharper than his\nown. Other people coupled the signora's name with that of Mr\nArabin. The meagre little prebendary who lived in the close, told\nhim to a nicety how often Mr Arabin had visited at Dr Stanhope's,\nand how long he had remained on the occasion of each visit. He had\nasked after Mr Arabin at the cathedral library, and an officious\nlittle vicar choral had offered to go and see whether he could be\nfound at Dr Stanhope's. Rumour, when she has contrived to sound the\nfirst note on her trumpet, soon makes a loud peal audible enough.\nIt was too clear that Mr Arabin had succumbed to the Italian woman,\nand that the archdeacon's credit would suffer fearfully if\nsomething were not done to rescue the brand from the burning.\nBesides, to give the archdeacon his due, he was really attached to\nMr Arabin, and grieved greatly at his backsliding.\n\nThey were sitting talking over their sorrows, in the drawing-room\nbefore dinner on that day after Mr Slope's departure for London;\nand on this occasion Mrs Grantly spoke her mind freely. She had\nopinions of her own about parish clergymen, and now thought it\nright to give vent to them.\n\n'It you would have been led by me, archdeacon, you would never have\nput a bachelor into St Ewold's.'\n\n'But, my dear, you don't mean to say that all bachelor clergymen\nmisbehave themselves.'\n\n'I don't know that clergymen are so much better than other men,'\nsaid Mrs Grantly. 'It's all very well with a curate whom you have\nunder your own eye, and whom you can get rid of if he persists in\nimproprieties.'\n\n'But Mr Arabin was a fellow, and couldn't have had a wife.'\n\n'Then I would have found some one who could.'\n\n'But, my dear, are fellows never to get livings?'\n\n'Yes, to be sure they are, when they got engaged. I never would put\na young man into a living unless he were married, or engaged to be\nmarried. Now here is Mr Arabin. The whole responsibility lies upon\nyou.'\n\n'There is not at this moment a clergyman in all Oxford more\nrespected for morals and conduct than Arabin.'\n\n'Oh, Oxford!' said the lady, with a sneer. 'What men choose to do\nat Oxford, nobody ever hears of. A man may do very well at Oxford\nwho would bring disgrace on a parish; and, to tell you the truth,\nit seems to me that Mr Arabin is just such a man.'\n\nThe archdeacon groaned deeply, but he had no further answer to\nmake.\n\n'You really must speak to him, archdeacon. Only think what the\nThornes will say if they hear that their parish clergyman spends\nhis whole time philandering with this woman.'\n\nThe archdeacon groaned again. He was a courageous man, and knew\nwell enough how to rebuke the younger clergymen of the diocese when\nnecessary. But there was that about Mr Arabin which made the doctor\nfeel that it would be very difficult to rebuke him with good\neffect.\n\n'You can advise him to find a wife for himself, and he will\nunderstand well enough what that means,' said Mrs Grantly.\n\nThe archdeacon had nothing for it but groaning. There was Mr Slope;\nhe was going to be made dean; he was going to take a wife; he was\nbout to achieve respectability and wealth; and excellent family\nmansion, and a family carriage; he would soon be among the\ncomfortable elite of the ecclesiastical world of Barchester;\nwhereas his own protege, the true scion of the true church, by whom\nhe had sworn, would still be a poor vicar, and that with a very\nindifferent character for moral conduct! It might be all very well\nrecommending Mr Arabin to marry, but how would Mr Arabin when\nmarried support a wife?\n\nThings were ordering themselves thus at Plumstead drawing-room when\nDr and Mrs Grantly were disturbed in their sweet discourse by the\nquick rattle of a carriage and a pair of horses on the gravel\nsweep. The sound was not that of visitors, whose private carriages\nare generally brought up to country-house doors with demure\npropriety, but belonged rather to some person or persons who were\nin a hurry to reach the house, and had not intention of immediately\nleaving it. Guests invited to stay a week, and who were conscious\nof arriving after the first dinner bell, would probably approach in\nsuch a manner. So might arrive an attorney with the news of a\ngranduncle's death, or a son from college with all the fresh\nhonours of a double first. No one would have had himself driven to\nthe door of a country house in such a manner who had the slightest\ndoubt of his own right to force an entry.\n\n'Who is it?' said Mrs Grantly, looking at her husband.\n\n'Who on earth can it be?' said the archdeacon to his wife. He then\nquietly got up and stood with the drawing-room door open in his\nhand. 'Why, it is your father!'\n\nIt was indeed Mr Harding, and Mr Harding alone. He had come by\nhimself in a post-chaise with a couple of horses from Barchester,\narriving almost after dark, and evidently full of news. His visits\nhad usually been made in the quietest manner; he had rarely\npresumed to come without notice, and had always been driven up in a\nmodest old green fly, with one horse, that hardly made itself heard\nas it crawled up to the hall door.\n\n'Good gracious, Warden, is it you?' said the archdeacon, forgetting\nin his surprise the events of the last few years. 'But come in;\nnothing is the matter, I hope?'\n\n'We are very glad you are come, papa,' said his daughter. 'I'll go\nand get your room ready at once.'\n\n'I an't warden, archdeacon,' said Mr Harding. 'Mr Quiverful is\nwarden.'\n\nOh, I know, I know,' said the archdeacon, petulantly. 'I forgot all\nabout it at the moment. Is anything the matter?'\n\n'Don't go at the moment, Susan,' said Mr Harding; 'I have something\nto tell you.'\n\n'The dinner bell will ring in five minutes,' said she.\n\n'Will it?' said Mr Harding. 'Then, perhaps I had better wait.' he\nwas big with news which he had come to tell, but which he knew\ncould not be told without much discussion. He had hurried away to\nPlumstead as fast as two horses could bring him, and now, finding\nhimself there, he was willing to accept the reprieve which dinner\nwould give him.\n\n'If you have anything of moment to tell us, said the archdeacon,\n'pray let us hear it at once. Has Eleanor gone off?'\n\n'No, she has not,' said Mr Harding, with a look of great\ndisclosure.\n\n'Has Slope been made dean?'\n\n'No, he has not; but--'\n\n'But what?' said the archdeacon, who was becoming very impatient.\n\n'They have--'\n\n'They have what?' said the archdeacon.\n\n'They have offered it to me,' said Mr Harding, with a modesty which\nalmost prevented his speaking.\n\n'Good heavens!' said the archdeacon, and sank back exhausted in an\neasy-chair.\n\n'My dear, dear, father,' said Mrs Grantly, and threw her arms\naround his neck.\n\n'So I thought I had better come out and consult with you at once,'\nsaid Mr Harding.\n\n'Consult!' shouted the archdeacon. 'But, my dear Harding, I\ncongratulate you with my whole heart--with my whole heart. I do\nindeed. I never heard anything in my life that gave me so much\npleasure;' and he got hold of both his father-in-law's hands, and\nshook them as though he were going to shake them off, and walked\nround and round the room, twirling a copy of the Jupiter over his\nhead, to show his extreme exultation.\n\n'But--' began Mr Harding.\n\n'But me no buts,' said the archdeacon. 'I never was so happy in my\nlife. It was just the proper thing to do. Upon my honour, I'll\nnever say another word against Lord--the longest day I have to\nlive.'\n\n'That's Dr Gwynne's doing, you may be sure,' said Mrs Grantly, who\ngreatly liked the master of Lazarus, he being an orderly married\nman with a large family.\n\n'I suppose it is,' said the archdeacon.\n\n'Oh, papa, I am so truly delighted,' said Mrs Grantly, getting up\nand kissing her father.\n\n'But, my dear,' said Mr Harding. It was all in vain that he strove\nto speak; nobody would listen to him.\n\n'Well, Mr Dean,' said the archdeacon, triumphing; 'the deanery\ngardens will be some consolation for the hospital elms. Well, poor\nQuiverful! I won't begrudge him his good fortune any longer.'\n\nNo, indeed,' said Mrs Grantly. 'Poor woman, she has fourteen\nchildren. I am sure I am very glad they have got it.'\n\n'So am I,' said Mr Harding.\n\n'I would give twenty pounds,' said the archdeacon, 'to see how Mr\nSlope will look when he hears it.' The idea of Mr Slope's\ndiscomfiture formed no small part of the archdeacon's pleasure.\n\nAt last Mr Harding was allowed to go up-stairs and wash his hands,\nhaving, in fact, said very little of all that he had come out to\nPlumstead on purpose to say. Nor could anything more be said till\nthe servants were gone after dinner. The joy of Dr Grantly was so\nuncontrollable that he could not refrain from calling his\nfather-in-law Mr Dean before the men; and therefore, it was soon\nmatter for discussion in the lower regions how Mr Harding, instead\nof his daughter's future husband, was to be the new dean, and\nvarious were the opinions on the matter. The cook and butler, who\nwere advanced in years, thought that it was just as it should be;\nbut the footman and lady's maid, who were younger, thought it was a\ngreat shame that Mr Slope should lose his chance.\n\n'He's a mean chap all the same,' said the footman; 'and it an't\nalong of him that I says so. But I always did admire the missus's\nsister; and she'd well become the situation.'\n\nWhile these were the ideas down-stairs, a very great difference of\nopinion existed above. As soon as the cloth was drawn and the wine\non the table, Mr Harding made for himself the opportunity of\nspeaking. It was, however, with much troubling that he said--\n\n'It's very kind of Lord--very kind, and I feel it deeply, most\ndeeply. I am, I must confess, gratified by the offer--'\n\n'I should think so,' said the archdeacon.\n\n'But, all the same, I am afraid that I can't accept it.'\n\nThe decanter almost fell from the archdeacon's had upon the table;\nand the start he made was so great as to make his wife jump from\nher chair. Not accept the deanship! If it really ended in this,\nthere would be no longer any doubt that his father-in-law was\ndemented. The question now was whether a clergyman with low rank,\nand preferment amounting to less than 200 pounds a year, should\naccept high rank, 1200 pounds a year, and one of the most desirable\npositions which his profession had to afford!\n\n'What!' said the archdeacon, gasping for breath, and staring at his\nguest as though the violence of his emotion had almost thrown him\ninto a fit.\n\n'What!'\n\n'I do not find myself fit for new duties,' urged Mr Harding.\n\n'New duties! what duties?' said the archdeacon, with unintended\nsarcasm.\n\n'Oh, papa,' said Mrs Grantly, 'nothing can be easier that what a\ndean has to do. Surely you are more active than Dr Trefoil.'\n\n'He won't have half as much to do as at present,' said Dr Grantly.\n\n'Did you see what the Jupiter said the other day about young men?'\n\n'Yes; and I saw that the Jupiter said all that it could to induce\nthe appointment of Mr Slope. Perhaps you would wish to see Mr Slope\nmade dean.'\n\nMr Harding made no reply to this rebuke, though he felt it\nstrongly. He had not come over to Plumstead to have further\ncontention with his son-in-law about Mr Slope, so he allowed it to\npass by.\n\n'I know I cannot make you understand my feeling,' he said, 'for we\nhave been cast in different moulds. I may wish that I had your\nspirit and energy and power of combatting; but I have not. Every\nday that is added to my life increases my wish for peace and rest.'\n\n'And where on earth can a man have peace and rest if not in a\ndeanery?' said the archdeacon.\n\n'People will say I am too old for it.'\n\n'Good heavens! What people? What need you care for any people?'\n\n'But I think myself I am too old for any new place.'\n\n'Dear papa,' said Mrs Grantly, 'men ten years older than you have\nbeen appointed to new situations day after day.'\n\n'My dear,' said he, 'it is impossible that I should make you\nunderstand my feelings, nor do I pretend to any great virtue in the\nmatter. The truth is, I want the force of character which might\nenable me to stand against the spirit of the times. The call on all\nsides now is for young men, and I have not the nerve to put myself\nin opposition to the demand. Were the Jupiter, when it hears of my\nappointment, to write article after article, setting forth my\nincompetency, I am sure it would cost me my reason. I ought to be\nable to bear with such things, you will say. Well, my dear, I own\nthat I ought. But I feel my weakness and I know that I can't. And,\nto tell you the truth, I know no more than a child what the dean\nhas to do.'\n\n'Pshaw!' exclaimed the archdeacon.\n\n'Don't be angry with me, archdeacon; don't let us quarrel about it,\nSusan. If you knew how keenly I feel the necessity of having to\ndisoblige you in this matter, you would not be angry with me.'\n\nThis was a dreadful blow to Dr Grantly. Nothing could possibly have\nsuited him better than having Mr Harding in the deanery. Though he\nhad never looked down on Mr Harding on account of his great\npoverty, he did fully recognise the satisfaction of having those\nbelonging to him in comfortable positions. It would be much more\nsuitable that Mr Harding should be dean of Barchester than vicar of\nSt Cuthbert's and precentor to boot. And then the great\ndiscomfiture of that arch enemy of all that was respectable in\nBarchester, of that new low church clerical parvenu that had fallen\namongst them, that alone would be worth more, almost than the\nsituation itself. It was frightful to think that such unhoped for\ngood fortune should be marred by the absurd crotchets and\nunwholesome hallucinations by which Mr Harding allowed himself to\nbe led astray. To have the cup so near his lips and then to lose\nthe drinking of it, was more than Dr Grantly could endure.\n\nAnd yet it appears as though he would have to endure it. In vain he\nthreatened and in vain he coaxed. Mr Harding did not indeed speak\nwith perfect decision of refusing the proffered glory, but he would\nnot speak with anything like decision of accepting it. When pressed\nagain and again, he would again and again allege that he was wholly\nunfitted to new duties. It was in vain that the archdeacon tried to\ninsinuate, though he could not plainly declare, that there were no\nnew duties to perform. It was in vain he hinted that in all cases\nof difficulty he, the archdeacon, was willing and able to guide a\nweak-minded dean. Mr Harding seemed to have a foolish idea, not\nonly that there were new duties to do, and that no one should\naccept the place who was not himself prepared to do them.\n\nThe conference ended in an understanding that Mr Harding should at\nonce acknowledge the letter he had received from the minister's\nprivate secretary, and should beg that he might be allowed two days\nto make up his mind; and that during those two days the matter\nshould be considered.\n\nOn the following morning the archdeacon was to drive Mr Harding\nback to Barchester.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII\n\nMISS THORNE SHOWS HER TALENT FOR MATCH-MAKING\n\nOn Mr Harding's return to Barchester from Plumstead, which was\neffected by him in due course in company with the archdeacon, some\ntidings of a surprising nature met him. He was, during the journey,\nsubjected to such a weight of unanswerable argument, all of which\nwent to prove that it was his bounden duty not to interfere with\nthe paternal government that was so anxious to make him a dean,\nthat when he arrived at the chemist's door in High Street, he\nbarely knew which way to turn himself in the matter. But, perplexed\nas he was, he was doomed to further perplexity. He found a note\nthere from his daughter, begging him to most urgently to come to\nher immediately. But we must again go back a little in our story.\n\nMiss Thorne had not been slow to hear the rumours respecting Mr\nArabin, which had so much disturbed the happiness of Mrs Grantly.\nAnd she, also, was unhappy to think that her parish clergyman\nshould be accused of worshipping a strange goddess. She, also, was\nof opinion, that rectors and vicars should all be married, and with\nthat good-natured energy which was characteristic of her, she put\nher wits to work to find a fitting match for Mr Arabin. Mrs\nGrantly, in this difficulty, could think of no better remedy than a\nlecture from the archdeacon. Miss Thorne thought that a young lady,\nmarriageable, and with a dowry, might be of more efficacy. In\nlooking through the catalogue of her unmarried friends, who might\npossibly be in want of a husband, and might also be fit for such a\npromotion as a country parsonage affords, she could think of no one\nmore eligible than Mrs Bold; and, consequently, losing no time, she\nwent into Barchester on the day of Mr Slope's discomfiture, the\nsame day that her brother, had had his interesting interview with\nthe last of the Neros, and invited Mrs Bold to bring her nurse and\nbaby to Ullathorne and make a protracted visit.\n\nMiss Thorne suggested a month or two, intending to use her\ninfluence afterwards in prolonging it so as to last out the winter,\nin order that Mr Arabin might have an opportunity of becoming\nfairly intimate with his intended bride. 'We'll have Mr Arabin\ntoo,' said Miss Thorne to herself; 'and before the spring they'll\nknow each other; and in twelve or eighteen months' time, if all\ngoes well, Mrs Bold will be domiciled at St Ewold's'; and then the\nkind-hearted lady gave herself some not undeserved praise for her\nmatching genius.\n\nEleanor was taken a little by surprise, but the matter ended in her\npromising to go to Ullathorne, for at any rate a week or two; and\non the day previous to that on which her father drove out to\nPlumstead, she had had herself driven out to Ullathorne.\n\nMiss Thorne would not perplex her with her embryo lord on that same\nevening, thinking that she would allow her a few hours to make\nherself at home; but on the following morning Mr Arabin arrived.\n'And now,' said Miss Thorne to herself,' I must contrive to throw\nthem in each other's way.' That same day, after dinner, Eleanor,\nwith an assumed air of dignity which she could no maintain, with\ntears that she could not suppress, with a flutter which she could\nnot conquer, and a joy which she could not hide, told Miss Thorne\nthat she was engaged to marry Mr Arabin, and that it behoved her to\nget back home to Barchester as quick as she could.\n\nTo say simply that Miss Thorne was rejoiced at the success of the\nschemed, would give a very faint idea of her feelings on the\noccasion. My readers may probably have dreamt before now that they\nhave had before them some terrible long walk to accomplish, some\njourney of twenty or thirty miles, an amount of labour frightful to\nanticipate, and that immediately on starting they have ingeniously\nfound some accommodating short cut which have brought them without\nfatigue to their work's end in five minutes. Miss Thorne's waking\nfeelings were somewhat of the same nature. My readers may perhaps\nhave had to do with children, and may on some occasion have\npromised to their young charges some great gratification intended\nto come off, perhaps at the end of the winter, or at the beginning\nof summer. The impatient juveniles, however, will not wait, and\nclamorously demand their treat before they go to bed. Miss Thorne\nhad a sort of feeling that an inexperienced gunner, who has ill\ncalculated the length of the train that he has laid. The gunpowder\nexploded much too soon and poor Miss Thorne felt that she was blown\nup by the strength of her own petard.\n\nMiss Thorne had had lovers of her own, but they had been gentlemen\nof old-fashioned and deliberate habits. Miss Thorne's heart also\nhad not always been hard, though she was still a virgin spinster;\nbut it had never yielded in this way at the first assault. She had\nintended to bring together a middle-aged studious clergyman, and a\ndiscreet matron who might possibly be induced to marry again; and\nin doing she had thrown fire among tinder. Well, it was all as it\nshould be, but she did feel perhaps a little put out by the\nprecipitancy of her own success; and perhaps a little vexed at the\nreadiness of Mrs Bold to be wooed.\n\nShe said, however, nothing about it to any one, and ascribed it all\nto the altered manners of the new age. Their mothers and\ngrandmothers were perhaps a little more deliberate; but, it was\nadmitted on all sides that things were conducted very differently\nnow that in former times. For aught Miss Thorne knew of the matter,\na couple of hours might be quite sufficient under the new regime to\ncomplete that for which she in her ignorance had allotted twelve\nmonths.\n\nBut we must not pass over the wooing so cavalierly. It has been\ntold, with perhaps tedious accuracy, how Eleanor disposed of two of\nher lovers at Ullathorne; and it must also be told with equal\naccuracy, and if possible with less tedium, how she encountered Mr\nArabin.\n\nIt cannot be denied that when Eleanor accepted Miss Thorne's\ninvitation, she remembered that Ullathorne was in the parish of St\nEwold's. Since her interview with the signora she had done little\nelse than think about Mr Arabin, and the appeal that had been made\nto her. She could not bring herself to believe or try to bring\nherself to believe, that what she had been told was untrue. Think\nof it how she would, she could not but accept it as a fact that Mr\nArabin was fond of her; and then when she went further, and asked\nherself the question, she could not but accept it as a fact also\nthat she was fond of him. If it were destined for her to be the\npartner of his hopes and sorrows, to whom she could she look for\nfriendship so properly as to Miss Thorne? This invitation was like\nan ordained step towards the fulfilment of her destiny, and when\nshe also heard that Mr Arabin was expected to be at Ullathorne on\nthe following day, it seemed as though all the world was conspiring\nin her favour. Well, did she not deserve it? In that affair of Mr\nSlope, had not all the world conspired against her?\n\nShe could not, however, make herself easy and at home. When in the\nevening after dinner Miss Thorne expatiated on the excellence of Mr\nArabin's qualities, she hinted that any little rumour which might\nbe ill-naturedly spread abroad concerning him really meant nothing,\nMrs Bold found herself unable to answer. When Miss Thorne went a\nlittle further and declared that she did not know a prettier\nvicarage-house in the country than St Ewold's, Mrs Bold remembering\nthe projected bow-window and the projected priestess still held her\ntongue; though her ears tingled with the conviction that all the\nworld would know that she was in love with Mr Arabin. Well; what\ncould that matter if they could only meet and tell each other what\neach now longed to tell?\n\nAnd they did meet. Mr Arabin came early in the day, and found the\ntwo ladies together at work in the drawing-room. Miss Thorne, who\nhad she known all the truth would have vanished into air at once,\nhad no conception that her immediate absence would be a blessing,\nand remained chatting with them till luncheon-time. Mr Arabin could\ntalk about nothing but the Signora Neroni's beauty, would discuss\nno people but the Stanhopes. This was very distressing to Eleanor,\nand not very satisfactory to Miss Thorne. But yet there was\nevidence of innocence in his open avowal of admiration.\n\nAnd then they had lunch, and then Mr Arabin went out on parish\nduty; and Eleanor and Miss Thorne were left to take a walk\ntogether.\n\n'Do you think the Signora Neroni is so lovely as people say?'\nEleanor asked as they were coming home.\n\n'She is very beautiful certainly, very beautiful,' Miss Thorne\nanswered; 'but I do not know that any one considers her lovely. She\nis a woman all men would like to look at; but few I imagine would\nbe glad to take her to their hearths, even were she unmarried and\nnot afflicted as she is.'\n\nThere was some comfort in this. Eleanor made the most of it till\nshe got back to the house. She was then left alone in the\ndrawing-room, and just as it was getting dark Mr Arabin came in.\n\nIt was a beautiful afternoon in the beginning of October, and\nEleanor was sitting in the window to get the advantage of the last\ndaylight for her novel. There was a fire in the comfortable room,\nbut the weather was not cold enough to make it attractive; and as\nshe could see the sun set from where she sat, she was not very\nattentive to her book.\n\nMr Arabin when he entered stood awhile with his back to the fire in\nhis usual way, merely uttering a few commonplace remarks about the\nbeauty of the weather, while he plucked up courage for the more\ninteresting converse. It cannot probably be said that he had\nresolved then and there to make an offer to Eleanor. Men we believe\nseldom make such resolve. Mr Slope and Mr Stanhope had done so, it\nis true; but gentlemen generally propose without any absolutely\ndefined determination as to their doing so. Such was now the case\nwith Mr Arabin.\n\n'It is a lovely sunset,' said Eleanor, answering him on the\ndreadfully trite subject which he had chosen.\n\nMr Arabin could not see the sunset from the hearth-rug, as he had\nto go close to her.\n\n'Very lovely,' said he, standing modestly so far away from her s to\navoid touching the flounces of her dress. Then it appeared that he\nhad nothing further to say; so after gazing for a moment in silence\nat the brightness of the setting sun, he returned to the fire.\n\nEleanor found that it was quite impossible for herself to commence\na conversation. In the first place she could find nothing to say;\nwords, which were generally plenty enough with her, would not come\nto her relief. And, moreover, do what she could, she could hardly\nprevent herself from crying.\n\n'Do you like Ullathorne?' said Mr Arabin, speaking from the safely\ndistant position which he had assumed on the hearth-rug.\n\n'Yes, indeed, very much!'\n\n'I don't mean Mr and Miss Thorne. I know you like them; but the\nstyle of the house. There is something about old-fashioned\nmansions, built as this is, and old-fashioned gardens, that to me\nis especially delightful.'\n\n'I like everything old-fashioned,' said Eleanor; 'old-fashioned\nthings are so much the honestest.'\n\n'I don't know about that,' said Mr Arabin, gently laughing. 'That\nis an opinion on which very much may be said on either side. It is\nstrange how widely the world is divided on a subject which so\nnearly concerns us all, and which is so close beneath our eyes.\nSome think that we are quickly progressing towards perfection,\nwhile others imagine that virtue is disappearing from the earth.'\n\n'And you, Mr Arabin, what do you think?' said Eleanor. She felt\nsomewhat surprised at the tone which this conversation was taking,\nand yet she was quite relieved at his saying something which\nenabled herself to speak without showing any emotion.\n\n'What do I think, Mrs Bold?' and then he rumbled his money with his\nhand in his trousers pockets, and looked and spoke very little like\na thriving lover. 'It is the bane of my life that on important\nsubjects I acquire no fixed opinion. I think, and think, and go on\nthinking; and yet my thoughts are running over in different\ndirections. I hardly know whether or no we do lead more confidently\nthan our fathers did on those high hopes to which we profess to\naspire.'\n\n'I think the world grows more worldly every day,' said Eleanor.\n\n'That is because you see more of it than when you were younger. But\nwe should hardly judge by what we see,--we see so very very\nlittle.' There was then a pause for a while, during which Mr Arabin\ncontinued to turn over his shillings and half-crowns. 'If we\nbelieve in Scripture, we can hardly think that mankind in general\nwill now be allowed to retrograde.'\n\nEleanor, whose mind was certainly engaged otherwise than on the\ngeneral state of mankind, made no answer to this. She felt\nthoroughly dissatisfied with herself. She could not force her\nthoughts away from the topic on which the signora had spoken to her\nin so strange a way, and yet she knew that she could not converse\nwith Mr Arabin in an unrestrained natural tone till she did so. She\nwas most anxious not to show to him any special emotion, and yet\nshe felt that if he looked at her he would at once see that she was\nnot at ease.\n\nBut he did not look at her. Instead of doing so, he left the\nfire-place and began walking up and down the room. Eleanor took up\nher book resolutely; but she could not read, for there was a tear\nin her eye, and do what she would it fell on her cheek. When Mr\nArabin's back was turned to her she wiped it away; but another was\nsoon coming down her face in its place. They would come; not a\ndeluge of tears that would have betrayed her at once, but one by\none, single monitors. Mr Arabin did not observe her closely, and\nthey passed unseen.\n\nMr Arabin, thus passing up and down the room, took four of five\nturns before he spoke another word, and Eleanor sat equally silent\nwith her face bent over her book. She was afraid that her tears\nwould get the better of her, and was preparing for an escape from\nthe room, when Mr Arabin in his walk stood opposite to her. He did\nnot come close up, but stood exactly on the spot to which his\ncourse brought him, and then, with his hands under his coat tails,\nthus made a confession.\n\n'Mrs Bold,' said he, 'I owe you retribution for a great offence of\nwhich I have been guilty towards you.' Eleanor's heart beat so that\nshe could not trust herself to say that he had never been guilty of\nany offence. So Mr Arabin then went on.\n\n'I have thought much of it since, and I am now aware that I was\nwholly unwarranted in putting to you a question which I once asked\nyou. It was indelicate on my part, and perhaps unmanly. No intimacy\nwhich may exist between myself and your connection, Dr Grantly,\ncould justify it. Nor could the acquaintance which existed between\nourselves.' The word acquaintance struck cold on Eleanor's heart.\nWas this to her doom after all? 'I therefore think it right to beg\nyour pardon in a humble spirit, and I now do so.'\n\nWhat was Eleanor to say to this? She could not say much, because\nshe was crying, and yet she must say something. She was most\nanxious to say that something graciously, kindly, and yet not in\nsuch a manner as to betray herself. She had never felt herself so\nmuch at a loss for words.\n\n'Indeed I took no offence, Mr Arabin.'\n\n'Oh, but you did! And had you not done so, you would not have been\nyourself. You were as right to be offended, as I was wrong to so\noffend you. I have not forgiven myself, but I hope to hear that you\nforgive me.'\n\nShe was now past speaking calmly, though she still continued to\nhide her tears, and Mr Arabin, after pausing a moment in vain for\nher reply, was walking off towards the door. She felt that she\ncould not allow him to go unanswered without grievously sinning\nagainst all charity; so, rising from her seat, she gently touched\nhis arm and said: 'Oh, Mr Arabin, do not go till I speak to you! I\ndo forgive you. You know that I forgive you.'\n\nHe took the hand that had so gently touched his arm, and then gazed\ninto her face as if he would peruse there, as though written in a\nbook, the whole future destiny of his life; and as he did so, there\nwas a sober and seriousness in his own countenance, which Eleanor\nfound herself unable to sustain. She could only look down upon the\ncarpet, let her tears trickle as they would, and leave her hand\nwithin his.\n\nIt was but for a minute that they stood so, but the duration of\nthat minute was sufficient to make it ever memorable to both.\nEleanor was sure now that she was loved. No words, be their\neloquence what it might, could be more impressive than that eager,\nmelancholy gaze.\n\nWhy did he look into her eyes? Why did he not speak to her?\n Could it be that he looked for her to make the first sign?\n\nAnd he, though he knew little of women, even he knew that he was\nloved. He had only to ask and it would be all his own, that\ninexpressible loveliness, those ever speaking but yet now mute\neyes, that feminine brightness and eager loving spirit which had so\nattracted him since first he had encountered it at St Ewold's. It\nmight, must all be his own now. On no other supposition was it\npossible that she should allow her hand to remain thus clasped\nwithin his own. He had only to ask. Ah! but that was the\ndifficulty. Did a minute suffice for all this? Nay, perhaps it\nmight be more than a minute.\n\n'Mrs Bold--' at last he said, and then stopped himself.\n\nIf he could not speak, how was she to do so? He had called her by\nher name, the same name that any merest stranger would have used!\nShe withdrew her hand from his, and moved as though to return to\nher seat. 'Eleanor!' he then said, in his softest tone, as though\nthe courage were still afraid of giving offence, by the freedom\nwhich he took. She looked slowly, gently, almost piteously up into\nhis face. There was at any rate no anger there to deter him.\n\n'Eleanor!' he again exclaimed; and in a moment he had her clasped\nto his bosom. How this was done, whether the doing was with him, or\nher, whether she had flown thither conquered by the tenderness of\nhis voice, or he with a violence not likely to give offence had\ndrawn her to his breast, neither of them knew; nor can I declare.\nThere was now that sympathy between them which hardly admitted of\nindividual motion. They were one and the same,--one flesh,--one\nspirit,--one life.\n\n'Eleanor, my own Eleanor, my own, my wife!' She ventured to look at\nhim through her tears, and he, bowing his face down over hers,\npressed his lips upon her brow; his virgin lips, which since a\nbeard first grew upon his chin, had never yet tasted the luxury of\na woman's cheek.\n\nShe had been told that her yea must be yea, or her nay, nay; but\nshe was called on for neither the one nor the other. She told Miss\nThorne that she was engaged to Mr Arabin, but no such words had\npassed between them, no promises had been asked or given.\n\n'Oh, let me go,' said she; 'let me go now. I am too happy to\nremain,--let me go, that I may be alone.' He did not try to hinder\nher; he did not repeat his kiss; he did not press another on her\nlips. He might have done so, had he been so minded. She was now all\nhis own. He took his arm from round her waist, his arm that was\ntrembling with a new delight, and let her go. She fled like a roe\nto her own chamber, and then, having turned the bolt, she enjoyed\nthe full luxury of her love. She idolised, almost worshipped this\nman who had so meekly begged her pardon. And he was now her own.\nOh, how she wept and cried and laughed, as the hopes and fears and\nmiseries of the last few weeks passed in remembrance through her\nmind.\n\nMr Slope! That any one should have dared to think that she who had\nbeen chosen by him could possibly have mated herself with Mr Slope!\nThat they should have dared to tell him, also, and subject her\nbright happiness to such a needless risk! And then she smiled with\njoy as she thought of all the comforts that she could give him; not\nthat he cared for comforts, but that it would be so delicious for\nher to give.\n\nShe got up and rang for her maid that she might tell her little boy\nof his new father; and in her own way she did tell him. She desired\nher maid to leave her, in order that she might be alone with her\nchild; and there, while he lay sprawling on the bed, she poured\nforth the praises, so unmeaning to him, of the man she had selected\nto guard his infancy.\n\nShe could not be happy, however, till she had made Mr Arabin take\nthe child to himself, and thus, as it were, adopt him as his own.\nThe moment the idea struck her she took the baby in her arms, and,\nopening her door, ran quickly down to the drawing-room. She at once\nfound, by the step still pacing on the floor, that he was there;\nand a glance within the room told her that he was alone. She\nhesitated a moment, and then hurried in with her precious charge.\n\nMr Arabin met her in the middle of the room. 'There,' said she,\nbreathless with her haste; 'there, take him--take him and love\nhim.'\n\nMr Arabin took the little fellow from her, and kissing him again\nand again, prayed God to bless him. 'He shall be all as my own--\nall as my own,' said he. Eleanor, as she stooped to take back her\nchild, kissed the hand that held him, and then rushed back with her\ntreasure to her chamber.\n\nIt was then that Mr Harding's younger daughter was won for the\nsecond time. At dinner neither she nor Mr Arabin were very bright,\nbut their silence occasioned no remark. In the drawing-room, as we\nhave before said, she told Miss Thorne what had occurred. The next\nmorning she returned to Barchester, and Mr Arabin went over with\nhis budget of news to the archdeacon. As Dr Grantly was not there,\nhe could only satisfy himself by telling Mrs Grantly how that he\nintended himself the honour of becoming her brother-in-law. In the\necstasy of her joy at hearing such tidings, Mrs Grantly vouchsafed\nhim a warmer welcome than any he had yet received from Eleanor.\n\n'Good heavens!' she exclaimed--it was the general exclamation of\nthe rectory. 'Poor Eleanor! Dear Eleanor. What monstrous injustice\nhas been done her!--Well, it shall all be made up now.' And then\nshe thought of the signora. 'What lies people tell,' she said to\nherself.\n\nBut people in this matter had told no lies at all.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX\n\nTHE BEELZEBUB COLT\n\nWhen Miss Thorne left the dining-room, Eleanor had formed no\nintention of revealing to her what had occurred; but when she was\nseated beside her hostess on the sofa the secret dropped from her\nalmost unawares. Eleanor was but a bad hypocrite, and she found\nherself quite unable to continue talking about Mr Arabin, as though\nhe was a stranger, while her heart was full of him. When Miss\nThorne, pursuing her own scheme with discreet zeal, asked the young\nwidow whether, in her opinion, it would not be a good thing for Mr\nArabin to get married, she had nothing for it but to confess the\ntruth. 'I suppose it would,' said Eleanor, rather sheepishly.\nWhereupon Miss Thorne amplified on the idea. 'Oh, Miss Thorne,'\nsaid Eleanor, 'he is going to be married. I am engaged to him.'\n\nNow Miss Thorne knew very well that there had been no such\nengagement when she had been walking with Mrs Bold in the morning.\nShe had also heard enough to be tolerably sure that there had been\nno preliminaries to such an engagement. She was, therefore, as we\nhave before described, taken a little by surprise. But,\nnevertheless, she embraced her guest, and cordially congratulated\nher.\n\nEleanor had no opportunity of speaking another word to Mr Arabin\nthat evening, except such words as all the world might hear; and\nthese, as may be supposed, were few enough. Miss Thorne did her\nbest to leave them in privacy; but Mr Thorne, who knew nothing of\nwhat had occurred, and another guest, a friend of his, entirely\ninterfered with her good intentions. So poor Eleanor had to go to\nbed without one sign of affection. Her state, nevertheless, was\nnot to be pitied.\n\nThe next morning she was up early. It was probable, she thought,\nthat by going down a little before the usual hour of breakfast, she\nmight find Mr Arabin alone in the dining-room. Might it not be that\nshe would calculate that an interview would thus be possible? Thus\nthinking, Eleanor was dressed a full hour before the time fixed at\nthe Ullathorne household for morning prayers. She did not at once\ngo down. She was afraid to seem to be too anxious to meet her\nlover; though, heaven knows, her anxiety was intense enough. She\ntherefore sat herself down at her window, and repeatedly looking at\nher watch, nursed her child till she thought she might venture\nforth.\n\nWhen she found herself at the dining-room door, she stood a moment,\nhesitating to turn the handle; but when she heard Mr Thorne's voice\ninside she hesitated no longer. Her object was defeated, and she\nmight now go in as soon as she liked without the slightest\nimputation on her delicacy. Mr Thorne and Mr Arabin were standing\non the hearth-rug, discussing the merits of the Beelzebub colt; or\nrather, Mr Thorne was discussing, and Mr Arabin was listening. That\ninteresting animal had rubbed the stump of his tail against the\nwall of his stable, and occasioned much uneasiness to the\nUllathorne master of the horse. Had Eleanor but waited another\nminute, Mr Thorne would have been in the stable.\n\nMr Thorne, when he saw his lady guest, repressed his anxiety. The\nBeelzebub colt must do without him. And so the three stood, saying\nlittle or nothing to each other, till at last the master of the\nhouse, finding that he could no longer bear the present state of\nsuspense respecting his favourite young steed, made an elaborate\napology to Mrs Bold, and escaped. As he shut the door behind him,\nEleanor almost wished that he had remained. It was not that she was\nafraid of Mr Arabin, but she hardly yet knew how to address him.\n\nHe, however, soon relieved her from her embarrassment. He came up\nto her, and taking bother her hands in his, he said, 'So, Eleanor,\nyou and I are to be man and wife. Is it so?'\n\nShe looked up into his face, and her lips formed themselves into a\nsingle syllable. She uttered no sound, but he could read the\naffirmative plainly in her face.\n\n'It is a great trust,' said he, 'a very great trust.'\n\n'It is--it is,' said Eleanor, not exactly taking what he had said\nin the sense that he had meant. 'It is a very great trust, and I\nwill do my utmost to deserve it.'\n\n'And I also will do my utmost to deserve it,' said Mr Arabin very\nsolemnly. And then, winding his arm round her waist, he stood there\ngazing at the fire, and she with her head leaning in his shoulder,\nstood by him, well satisfied with her position. They neither of\nthem spoke, or found any want of speaking. All that was needful for\nthem to say had been said. The yea, yea, had been spoken by Eleanor\nin her own way--and that way had been perfectly satisfactory to Mr\nArabin.\n\nAnd now it remained to them each to enjoy the assurance of the\nother's love. And how great that luxury is! How far it surpasses\nany other pleasure which God has allowed to his creatures! And to a\nwoman's heart how doubly delightful!\n\nWhen the ivy has found its tower, when the delicate creeper has\nfound its strong wall, we know how the parasite plants grow and\nprosper. They were not created to stretch forth their branches\nalone, and endure without protection the summer's sun and the\nwinter's storm. Alone they but spread themselves on the ground, and\ncower unseen in the dingy shade. But when they have found their\nfirm supporters, how wonderful is their beauty; how all pervading\nand victorious!\n\nWhat is the turret without its ivy, or the high garden wall without\nthe jasmine which gives it its beauty and fragrance? The hedge\nwithout the honeysuckle is but a hedge.\n\nThere is s feeling still half existing, but now half conquered by\nthe force of human nature, that a woman should be ashamed of her\nlove till the husband's right to her compels her to acknowledge it.\nWe would fain preach a different doctrine. A woman should glory in\nher love; but on that account let her take the more care that it be\nsuch as to justify her glory.\n\nEleanor did glory in hers, and she felt, and had cause to feel,\nthat it deserved to be held as glorious. She could have stood there\nfor hours with his arm around her, had fate and Mr Thorne permitted\nit. Each moment she crept nearer to his bosom, and felt more and\nmore certain that there was her home. What now to her was the\narchdeacon's arrogance, her sister's coldness, or her dear father's\nweakness? What need she care for the duplicity of such friends as\nCharlotte Stanhope? She had found the strong shield that should\nguard her from all wrongs, the trusty pilot that should\nhenceforward guide her through the shoals and rocks. She would give\nup the heavy burden of her independence, and once more assume the\nposition of a woman, and the duties of a trusting and loving wife.\n\nAnd he, too, stood there fully satisfied with his place. They were\nboth looking intently on the fire, as though they could read there\ntheir future fate, till at last Eleanor turned her face towards\nhis. 'How sad you are,' she said, smiling; and indeed his face was,\nif not sad, at least serious. 'How sad you are, love!'\n\n'Sad,' said he, looking down at her; 'no, certainly not sad.' Her\nsweet loving eyes were turned towards him, and she smiled softly as\nhe answered her. The temptation was too strong even for the demure\npropriety of Mr Arabin, and, bending over her, he pressed his lips\nto hers.\n\nImmediately after this, Mr Thorne appeared, and they were both\ndelighted to hear that the tail of the Beelzebub colt was not\nmaterially injured.\n\nIt had been Mr Harding's intention to hurry over to Ullathorne as\nsoon as possible after his return to Barchester, in order to secure\nthe support of his daughter in his meditated revolt against the\narchdeacon as touching the deanery; but he was spared the\nadditional journey by hearing that Mrs Bold had returned\nunexpectedly home. As soon as he had read her note he started off,\nand found her waiting for him in her own house.\n\nHow much each of them had to tell the other, and how certain each\nwas that the story which he or she had to tell would astonish the\nother!\n\n'My dear, I am so anxious to see you,' said Mr Harding, kissing his\ndaughter.\n\n'Oh, papa, I have so much to tell you!' said the daughter,\nreturning his embrace.\n\n'My dear, they have offered me the deanery!' said Mr Harding,\nanticipating by the suddenness of the revelation the tidings which\nEleanor had to give him.\n\n'Oh, papa,' said she, forgetting her own love and happiness in her\njoy at the surprising news; 'oh, papa, can it be possible? Dear,\npapa, how thoroughly, thoroughly happy that makes me!'\n\n'But, my dear, I think it best to refuse it.'\n\n'Oh, papa!'\n\n'I am sure you will agree with me, Eleanor, when I explain it to\nyou. You know, my dear how old I am. If I live, I--'\n\n'But, papa, I must tell you about myself.'\n\n'Well, my dear.'\n\n'I do wonder how you will take it.'\n\n'Take what?'\n\n'If you don't rejoice at it, if it doesn't make you happy, if you\ndon't encourage me, I shall break my heart.'\n\n'If that be the case, Nelly, I certainly will encourage you.'\n\n'But I fear you won't. I do so fear you won't. And yet you can't\nbut think I am the most fortunate woman living on God's earth.'\n\n'Are you, dearest? Then I certainly will rejoice with you. Come,\nNelly, come to me, and tell me what it is.'\n\n'I am going--'\n\nHe led her to the sofa, and seating himself beside her, with both\nher hands in his. 'You are going to be married, Nelly.\n Is not that it?'\n\n'Yes,' she said, faintly. 'That is if you will approve;' and then\nshe blushed as she remembered the promise which she had so lately\nvolunteered to him, and which she had so utterly forgotten in\nmaking her engagement with Mr Arabin.\n\nMr Harding thought for a moment who the man could be whom he was to\nbe called upon to welcome as his son-in-law. A week since he would\nhave had no doubt whom to name. In that case he would have been\nprepared to give his sanction, although he would have done so with\na heavy heart. Now he knew that at any rate it would not be Mr\nSlope, though he was perfectly at a loss to guess who could\npossibly have filled his place. For a moment he thought that the\nman might be Bertie Stanhope, and his very soul sank within him.\n\n'Well, Nelly?'\n\n'Oh, papa, promise me that, for my sake, you will love him.'\n\n'Come, Nelly, come; tell me who it is.'\n\n'But you will love him, papa?'\n\n'Dearest, I must love any one that you love.' Then she turned he\nface to his, and whispered into his ear the name of Mr Arabin.\n\nNo man that she could have named could have more surprised or more\ndelighted him. Had he looked round the world for a son-in-law to\nhis taste, he could have selected no one whom he would have\npreferred to Mr Arabin. He was a clergyman; he held a living in the\nneighbourhood; he was of a set to which all Mr Harding's own\npartialities most closely adhered; he was the great friend of Dr\nGrantly; and he was, moreover, a man of whom Mr Harding knew\nnothing but what he approved. Nevertheless his surprise was so\ngreat as to prevent the immediate expression of his joy. He had\nnever thought of Mr Arabin in connection with his daughter; he had\nnever imagined that they had any feeling in common. He had feared\nthat his daughter had been made hostile to clergymen of Mr Arabin's\nstamp by her intolerance of the archdeacon's pretensions. Had he\nbeen put to wish, he might have wished for Mr Arabin for a\nson-in-law; but had he been put to guess, the name would never have\noccurred to him.\n\n'Mr Arabin!' he exclaimed; 'impossible!'\n\n'Oh, papa, for heaven's sake don't say anything against him!\n If you do love me, don't say anything against him. Oh, papa, it's\ndone, and mustn't be undone--oh, papa!'\n\nFickle Eleanor! Where was the promise that she would make no choice\nfor herself without her father's approval? She had chosen, and now\ndemanded his acquiescence. 'Oh, papa, isn't he good? isn't he\nnoble? isn't he religious, high-minded, everything that a good man\npossibly can be?' and she clung to her father, beseeching him for\nhis consent.\n\n'My Nelly, my child, my own daughter! He is; he is noble and good\nand high-minded; he is all that a woman can love and admire. He\nshall be my son, my own son. He shall be as close to my heart as\nyou are. My Nelly, my child, my happy, happy child!'\n\nWe need not pursue the interview any further. By degrees they\nreturned to the subject of the new promotion. Eleanor tried to\nprove to him, as the Grantlys had done, that his age could be no\nbar to his being a very excellent dean; but those arguments had now\neven less weight than before. He said little or nothing, but sat\nmeditative. Every now and then he would kiss his daughter, and say,\n'yes,' or 'no,' or 'very true,' or 'well, my dear, I can't quite\nagree with you there,' but he could not be got to enter sharply\ninto the question of 'to be or not to be' dean of Barchester. Of\nher and her happiness, of Mr Arabin and his virtues, he would talk\nas much as Eleanor desired; and, to tell the truth, that was not a\nlittle; but about the deanery he would now say nothing further. He\nhad got a new idea into his head--Why should not Mr Arabin be the\nnew dean?\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L\n\nTHE ARCHDEACON IS SATISFIED WITH THE STATE OF AFFAIRS\n\nThe archdeacon, in his journey into Barchester, had been assured by\nMr Harding that all their prognostications about Mr Slope and\nEleanor were groundless. Mr Harding, however, had found it very\ndifficult to shake his son-in-law's faith in his own acuteness. The\nmatter had, to Dr Grantly, been so plainly corroborated by such\npatent evidence, borne out by such endless circumstances, that he\nat first refused to take as true the positive statement which Mr\nHarding made to him of Eleanor's own disavowal of the impeachment.\nBut at last he yielded in a qualified way. He brought himself to\nadmit that he would at the present regard his past convictions as a\nmistake; but in doing this he so guarded himself, that if, at any\nfuture time, Eleanor should come forth to the world as Mrs Slope,\nhe might still be able to say: 'There, I told you so. Remember what\nyou said and what I said; and remember also for coming years, that\nI was right in this matter--as in all others.'\n\nHe carried, however, his concession so far as to bring himself to\nundertake to call at Eleanor's house, and he did call accordingly,\nwhile the father and the daughter were yet in the middle of their\nconference. Mr Harding had had so much to hear and to say that he\nhad forgotten to advertise Eleanor of the honour that awaited her,\nand she heard her brother-in-law's voice in the hall, while she\nquite unprepared to see him.\n\n'There's the archdeacon,' she said, springing up.\n\n'Yes, my dear. He told me to tell you that he would come to see\nyou; but, to tell the truth, I had forgotten all about it.'\n\nEleanor fled away, regardless of all her father's entreaties. She\ncould not now, in the first hours of her joy, bring herself to bear\nall the archdeacon's retractions, apologies, and congratulations.\nHe would have so much to say, and would be so tedious in saying it;\nconsequently, the archdeacon, when he was shown into the\ndrawing-room, found on one there but Mr Harding.'\n\n'You must excuse Eleanor,' said Mr Harding.\n\n'Is anything the matter?' asked the doctor, who at once anticipated\nthat the whole truth about Mr Slope had at last come out.\n\n'Well, something is the matter. I wonder whether you will be much\nsurprised?'\n\nThe archdeacon saw by his father-in-law's manner that after all he\nhad nothing to tell him about Mr Slope. 'No,' said he, 'certainly\nnot--nothing will ever surprise me again.' Very many men nowadays,\nbesides the archdeacon, adopt or affect to adopt the nil admirari\ndoctrine; but nevertheless, to judge from their appearance, they\nare just as subject to sudden emotions as their grandfathers and\ngrandmothers were before them.\n\n'What do you think Mr Arabin has done?'\n\n'Mr Arabin! It's nothing about that daughter of Stanhope's, I\nhope?'\n\n'No, not that woman,' said Mr Harding, enjoying his joke in his\nsleeve.\n\n'Not that woman! Is he going to do anything about any woman? Why\ncan't you speak out if yo have anything to say? There is nothing I\nhate so much as these sort of mysteries.'\n\n'There shall be no mystery with you, archdeacon; though, of course,\nit must go no further at present.'\n\n'Well.'\n\n'Except Susan. You must promise me you'll tell no one else?'\n\n'Nonsense!' exclaimed the archdeacon, who was becoming angry in his\nsuspense. 'You can't have any secret about Mr Arabin.'\n\n'Only this--that he and Eleanor are engaged.'\n\nIt was quite clear to see by the archdeacon's face, that he did not\nbelieve a word of it. 'Mr Arabin! It's impossible!'\n\n'Eleanor, at any rate, has just told me so.'\n\n'It's impossible,' repeated the archdeacon.\n\n'Well, I can't say I think it is impossible. It certainly took me\nby surprise; but that does not make it impossible.'\n\n'She must be mistaken.'\n\nMr Harding assured him that there was no mistake; that he would\nfind, on returning home, that Mr Arabin had been at Plumstead with\nthe express object of making to same declaration, that even Miss\nThorne knew all about it; and that, in fact, the thing was as\nclearly settled as any such arrangement between a lady and a\ngentleman could be.\n\n'Good heavens!' said the archdeacon, walking up and down Eleanor's\ndrawing-room. 'Good heavens! Good heavens!'\n\nNow, these exclamations certainly betokened faith. Mr Harding\nproperly gathered from it that, at last, Dr Grantly did believe the\nfact. The first utterances clearly evinced a certain amount of\ndistaste at the information he had received; the second, simply\nindicated surprise; and the tone of the third, Mr Harding fancied\nthat he could catch a certain gleam of satisfaction.\n\nThe archdeacon had truly expressed the workings of his mind.\n He could not but be disgusted to find how utterly astray he had\nbeen in all his anticipations. Had he only been lucky enough to\nhave suggested the marriage himself when he first brought Mr Arabin\ninto the country, his character for judgment and wisdom would have\nreceived an addition which would have classed him at any rate next\nto Solomon. And why had he not done so? Might he not have foreseen\nthat Mr Arabin would want a wife in the parsonage? He had foreseen\nthat Eleanor would want a husband; but should he not also have\nperceived that Mr Arabin was a man much more likely to attract her\nthan Mr Slope? The archdeacon found that he had been at fault, and\nof course could not immediately get over his discomfiture.\n\nThen his surprise was intense. How sly the pair of young turtle\ndoves had been with him. How egregiously they had hoaxed him. He\nhad preached at Eleanor against her fancied attachment to Mr Slope,\nat the very time she was in love with his own protege, Mr Arabin;\nand had absolutely taken that same Mr Arabin into his confidence\nwith reference to the dread of Mr Slope's alliance. It was very\nnatural that the archdeacons should feel surprise.\n\nBut there was also great ground for satisfaction. Looking at the\nmatch by itself, it was the very thing to help the doctor out of\nhis difficulties. In the first place, the assurance that he should\nnever have Mr Slope for his brother-in-law was in itself a great\ncomfort. Then Mr Arabin was, of all men, one with whom it would\nbest suit him to be utterly connected. But the crowning comfort was\nthe blow that this marriage would give to Mr Slope. He had now\ncertainly lost his wife; rumour was beginning to whisper that he\nmight possibly lose his position in the palace; and if Mr Harding\nwould only be true, the great danger of all would be surmounted. In\nsuch case it might be expected that Mr Slope would own himself\nvanquished, and take himself altogether away from Barchester.\n And so the archdeacon would again be able to breath the pure air.\n\n'Well, well,' said he. 'Good heavens! Good heavens!' and the tone\nof the fifth exclamation made Mr Harding fully aware that content\nwas reigning in the archdeacon's bosom.\n\nAnd then slowly, gradually, and craftily, Mr Harding propounded his\nown new scheme. Why should not Mr Arabin be the new dean?\n\nSlowly, gradually, thoughtfully, Dr Grantly fell into his\nfather-in-law's views. Much as he liked Mr Arabin, sincere as he\nwas in his admiration for that gentleman's ecclesiastical\nabilities, he would not have sanctioned a measure which would have\nrobbed his father-in-law of his fairly-earned promotion, were it at\nall practicable to induce his father-in-law to accept the promotion\nwhich he had earned. But the archdeacon had, on a former occasion,\nreceived proof of the obstinacy with which Mr Harding could adhere\nto his own views in opposition to the advice of all his friends. He\nknew tolerably well that nothing would induce the meek, mild man\nbefore him to take the high place offered to him, if he thought it\nwrong to do so. Knowing this, he also said to himself more than\nonce; 'Why should not Mr Arabin be dean of Barchester?' it was at\nlast arranged between them that they would together start to London\nby the earliest train on the following morning, making a little\ndetour to Oxford on their journey. Dr Gwynne's counsels, they\nimagined, might perhaps be of assistance to them.\n\nThese matters settled, the archdeacon hurried off, that he might\nreturn to Plumstead and prepare for his journey. The day was\nextremely fine, and he came into the city in an open gig. As he was\ndriving up the High Street he encountered Mr Slope at a crossing.\nHad he not pulled up rather sharply, he would have run over him.\nThe two had never spoken to each other since they had met on a\nmemorable occasion in the bishop's study. They did not speak now;\nbut they looked at each other full in the face, and Mr Slope's\ncountenance was as impudent, as triumphant, as defiant as ever. Had\nDr Grantly not known to the contrary, he would have imagined that\nhis enemy had won the deanship, the wife, and all the rich honours,\nfor which he had been striving. As it was he had lost everything\nthat he had in the world, and had just received his conge from the\nbishop.\n\nIn leaving the town the archdeacon drove by the well-remembered\nentrance of Hiram's hospital. There, at the gate, was a large,\nuntidy, farmer's wagon, laden with untidy-looking furniture; and\nthere, inspecting the arrival, was good Mrs Quiverful--not dressed\nin her Sunday best--not very clean in her apparel--not graceful as\nto her bonnet and shawl; or, indeed, with many feminine charms as\nto her whole appearance. She was busy at domestic work in her new\nhouse, and had just ventured out, expecting to see no one on the\narrival of the family chattels. The archdeacon was down upon her\nbefore she knew where she was.\n\nHer acquaintance with Dr Grantly or his family were very slight\nindeed. The archdeacon, as a matter of course, knew every clergyman\nin the archdeaconry; it may almost be said the diocese, and had\nsome acquaintance, more or less intimate, with their wives and\nfamilies. With Mr Quiverful he had been concerned on various\nmatters of business; but of Mrs Q. he had seen very little. Now,\nhowever, he was in too gracious a mood to pass her by unnoticed.\nThe Quiverfuls, one and all, had looked for the bitterest hostility\nfrom Dr Grantly; they knew his anxiety for Mr Harding should return\nto his old home at the hospital, and they did not know that a new\nhome had been offered to him at the deanery. Mrs Quiverful was\ntherefore not a little surprised and not a little rejoiced also, at\nthe tone at which she was addressed.\n\n'How do you do, Mrs Quiverful?--how do you do?' said he, stretching\nhis left hand out of the gig, as he spoke to her.\n 'I am very glad to see you employed in so pleasant and useful a\nmanner; very glad indeed.'\n\nMrs Quiverful thanked him, and shook hands with him, and looked\ninto his face suspiciously. She was not sure whether the\ncongratulations and kindness were or were not ironical.\n\n'Pray tell Mr Quiverful from me,' he continued, 'that I am rejoiced\nat his appointment. It is a comfortable place, Mrs Quiverful, and a\ncomfortable house, and I am very glad to see you in it. Good-bye,\ngood-bye.' And he drove on, leaving the lady well-pleased and\nastonished at his good nature. On the whole things were going well\nwith the archdeacon, and he could afford to be charitable to Mrs\nQuiverful. He looked forth from his gig smilingly on all the world,\nand forgave every one in Barchester their sins, excepting only Mrs\nProudie and Mr Slope. Had he seen the bishop, he would have felt\ninclined to pat even him kindly on the head.\n\nHe determined to go home by St Ewold's. This would take him some\nthree miles out of his way; but he felt that he could not leave\nPlumstead comfortably without saying one word of good fellowship to\nMr Arabin. When he reached the parsonage the vicar was still out;\nbut, from what he had heard, he did not doubt but that he would\nmeet him on the road between their two houses. He was right in\nthis, for about halfway home, at a narrow turn, he came upon Mr\nArabin, who was on horseback.\n\n'Well, well, well, well,' said the archdeacon loudly, joyously, and\nwith supreme good humour; 'well, well, well, well; so, after all,\nwe have no further cause to fear Mr Slope.'\n\n'I hear from Mrs Grantly that they have offered the deanery to Mr\nHarding,' said the other.\n\n'Mr Slope has lost more than the deanery, I find,' and then the\narchdeacon laughed jocosely. 'Come, come, Arabin, you have kept\nyour secret well enough. I know all about it now.'\n\n'I have had no secret, archdeacon,'said the other with a quiet\nsmile. 'None at all--not for a day. It was only yesterday that I\nknew my own good fortune, and to-day I went over to Plumstead to\nask your approval. From what Mrs Grantly has said to me, I am led\nto hope that I shall have it.'\n\n'With all my heart, with all my heart,' said the archdeacon\ncordially, holding his friend by the hand. 'It's just as I would\nhave it. She is an excellent young woman; she will not come to you\nempty-handed; and I think she will make you a good wife. If she\ndoes her duty by you as her sister does by me, you'll be a happy\nman; that's all I can say.' And as he finished speaking, a tear\nmight have been observed in each of the doctor's eyes.'\n\nMr Arabin warmly returned the archdeacon's grasp, but he said\nlittle. His heart was too full for speaking, and he could not\nexpress the gratitude which he felt. Dr Grantly understood him as\nwell as though he had spoken for an hour.\n\n'And mind, Arabin,' said he, 'no one but myself shall tie the knot.\nWe'll get Eleanor out to Plumstead, and it shall come off there.\nI'll make Susan stir herself, and we'll do it in style. I must be\noff to London to-morrow on special business. Harding goes with me.\nBut I'll be back before your bride has got her wedding-dress\nready.' And so they parted.\n\nOn his journey home the archdeacon occupied his mind with\npreparations for the marriage festivities. He made a great resolve\nthat he would atone to Eleanor for all the injury he had done her\nby the munificence of his future treatment. He would show her what\nwas the difference in his eyes between a Slope and an Arabin. On\none other thing also he decided with a firm mind: if the affair of\nthe dean should not be settled in Mr Arabin's favour, nothing\nshould prevent him putting a new front and bow-window to the\ndining-room at St Ewold's parsonage.\n\n'So we're sold after all, Sue,' said he to his wife, accosting her\nwith a kiss as soon as he entered his house. He did not call his\nwife Sue above twice or thrice in a year, and these occasions were\ngreat high days.\n\n'Eleanor has had more sense then we gave her credit for,' said Mrs\nGrantly.\n\nAnd there was great content in Plumstead rectory that evening; and\nMrs Grantly promised her husband that she would now open her heart,\nand take Mr Arabin into it. Hitherto she had declined to do so.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI\n\nMR SLOPE BIDS FAREWELL TO THE PALACE AND ITS INHABITANTS\n\nWe must now take leave of Mr Slope, and of the bishop, and of Mrs\nProudie. These leave-takings in novels are as disagreeable as they\nare in real life; not so sad, indeed, for they want the reality of\nsadness; but quite as perplexing, and generally less satisfactory.\nWhat novelist, what Fielding, what Scott, what George Sand, or Sue,\nor Duncan, can impart an interest to the last chapter of his\nfictitious history? Promises of two children and superhuman\nhappiness are of no avail, nor assurance of extreme respectability\ncarried to an age far exceeding that usually allotted to mortals.\nThe sorrows of our heroes and heroines, they are you delight, oh\npublic! their sorrows, or their sins, or their absurdities; not\ntheir virtues, good sense, and consequent rewards. When we begin to\ntint our final pages with couleur de rose, as in accordance with\nfixed rule we must do, we altogether extinguish our own powers of\npleasing. When we become dull we offend your intellect; and we must\nbecome dull or we should offend your taste. A late writer, wishing\nto sustain his interest to the last page, hung his hear at the end\nof the third volume. The consequence was, that no one should read\nhis novel. And who can apportion out and dovetail his incidents,\ndialogues, characters, and descriptive morsels, so as to fit them\nall exactly into 439 pages, without either compressing them\nunnaturally, or extending them artificially at the end of his\nlabour? Do I not myself know that I am at this moment in want of a\ndozen pages, and that I am sick with cudgelling my brains to find\nthem? And then when everything is done, the kindest-hearted critic\nof them all invariably twit us with the incompetency and lameness\nof our conclusion. We have either become idle and neglected it, or\ntedious and over-laboured it. It is insipid or unnatural,\nover-strained or imbecile. It means nothing, or attempts too much.\nThe last scene of all, as all last scenes we fear must be:\n\n'Is second childishness, and mere oblivion, Sans teeth, sans eyes,\nsans taste, sans everything.'\n\nI can only say that if some critic, who thoroughly knows his work,\nand has laboured on it till experience has made him perfect, will\nwrite the last fifty pages of a novel in the way they should be\nwritten. I, for one, will in future do my best to copy the example.\nGuided by my own lights only, I despair of success.\n\nFor the last week or ten days, Mr Slope had seen nothing of Mrs\nProudie, and very little of the bishop. He still lived in the\npalace, and still went through his usual routine work; but the\nconfidential doings of the diocese had passed into other hands. He\nhad seen this clearly, and marked it well; but it had not much\ndisturbed him. He had indulged in other hopes till the bishop's\naffairs had become dull to him, and he was moreover aware that, as\nregarded the diocese, Mrs Proudie had checkmated him. It has been\nexplained, in the beginning of these pages, how three or four were\ncontending together as to who, in fact, should be bishop of\nBarchester.\n Each of them had now admitted to himself (or boasted to herself)\nthat Mrs Proudie was victorious in the struggle. They had gone\nthrough a competitive examination of considerable severity, and she\nhad come forth the winner, facile princeps. Mr Slope had, for a\nmoment, run her hard, but it was only for a moment. It had become,\nas it were, acknowledged that Hiram's hospital should be the\ntesting point between them, and now Mr Quiverful was already in the\nhospital, the proof of Mrs Proudie's skill and courage.\n\nAll this did not break Mr Slope's spirit, because he had other\nhopes. But, alas, at last there came to him a note from his friend\nSir Nicholas, informing him that the deanship was disposed of. Let\nus give Mr Slope his due. He did not lie prostrate, under this\nblow, or give himself to vain lamentations; he did not henceforward\ndespair of life, and call upon gods above and gods below to carry\nhim off. He sat himself down in his chair, counted out what monies\nhe had in hand, for present purposes, and what others were coming\nto him, bethought himself as to the best sphere for his future\nexertions, and at once wrote off a letter to a rich sugar-\nrefiner's wife in Baker Street, who, as he well knew, was much\ngiven to the entertainment and encouragement of serious young\nevangelical clergymen. He was again, he said, 'upon the world,\nhaving found the air of a cathedral town, and the very nature of\ncathedral services, uncongenial to his spirit'; and then he sat\nawhile, making firm resolves as to his manner of parting from the\nbishop, and also as to his future conduct.\n\n      'At last he rose, and twitched his mantle blue,\n      To-morrow to fresh woods and pastures new.'\n\nHaving received a formal command to wait upon the bishop, he rose\nand proceeded to obey it. He rang the bell and desired the servant\nto inform his master that if it suited his lordship, he, Mr Slope,\nwas ready to wait upon him. The servant, who well understood that\nMr Slope was no longer in the ascendant, brought back a message,\nsaying that, 'his lordship desired that Mr Slope would attend him\nimmediately in his study.' Mr Slope waited about ten minutes more\nto prove his independence, and then went into the bishop's room.\n There, as had expected, he found Mrs Proudie, together with her\nhusband.\n\n'Hum, ha--Mr Slope, please take a chair,' said the gentleman\nbishop.\n\n'Pray be seated, Mr Slope,' said the lady bishop.\n\n'Thank ye, thank ye,'said Mr Slope, and walking round to the fire,\nhe threw himself into one of the arm-chairs that graced the\nhearth-rug.\n\n'Mr Slope,' said the bishop, 'it has become necessary that I should\nspeak to you definitively on a matter that has for some time been\npressing itself on my attention.'\n\n'May I ask whether the subject is in any way connected with\nmyself?' said Mr Slope.\n\n'It is so--certainly,--yes, it certainly is connected with\nyourself, Mr Slope.'\n\n'Then, my lord, if I may be allowed to express a wish, I would\nprefer that no discussion on the subject should take place between\nus in the presence of a third party.'\n\n'Don't alarm yourself, Mr Slope,' said Mrs Proudie, 'no discussion\nis at all necessary. The bishop merely intends to express his own\nwishes.'\n\n'I merely intend, Mr Slope, to express my own wishes--no discussion\nwill be at all necessary,' said the bishop, reiterating his wife's\nwords.\n\n'That is more, my lord, than we any of us can be sure of,' said Mr\nSlope; 'I cannot, however, force Mrs Proudie to leave the room; nor\ncan I refuse to remain here, if it be your lordship's wish that I\nshould do so.'\n\n'It is certainly his lordship's wish,'said Mrs Proudie.\n\n'Mr Slope,' began the bishop, in a solemn, serious voice, 'it\ngrieves me to have to find fault. It grieves me much to find fault\nwith a clergyman; but especially so with a clergyman in your\nposition.'\n\n'Why, what have I done amiss, my lord?' demanded Mr Slope, loudly.\n\n'What have you done amiss, Mr Slope?' said Mrs Proudie, standing\nerect before the culprit, and raising that terrible forefinger. 'Do\nyou dare to ask the bishop what you have done amiss? does not your\nconscience--'\n\n'Mrs Proudie, pray let it be understood, once for all, that I will\nhave no words with you.'\n\n'Ah, sire, but you will have words,' said she; 'you must have\nwords. Why have you had so may words with that Signora Neroni? Why\nhave you disgraced yourself, you a clergyman, by constantly\nconsorting with such a woman as that--with a married woman--with\none altogether unfit for a clergyman's society?'\n\n'At any rate, I was introduced to her in your drawing-room,'\nreturned Mr Slope.\n\n'And shamefully you behave there,' said Mrs Proudie, 'most\nshamefully. I was wrong to allow you to remain in the house a day\nafter what I then saw. I should have insisted on your instant\ndismissal.'\n\n'I have yet to learn, Mrs Proudie, that you have the power to\ninsist either on my going from hence or on my staying here.'\n\n'What!' said the lady; 'I am not to have the privilege of saying\nwho shall and who shall not frequent my own drawing-room! I am not\nto save my servants and dependents from having their morals\ncorrupted by improper conduct! I am not to save my own daughters\nfrom impurity! I will let you see, Mr Slope, whether I have the\npower or whether I have not. You will have the goodness to\nunderstand that you no longer fill any situation about the bishop;\nand as your room will be immediately wanted in the palace for\nanother chaplain, I must ask you to provide yourself with\napartments as soon as may be convenient to you.'\n\n'My lord,' said Mr Slope, appealing to the bishop, and so turning\nhis back completely on the lady, 'will you permit me to ask that I\nmay have from your own lips and decision that you may have come to\non this matter?'\n\n'Certainly, Mr Slope, certainly,' said the bishop; 'that is but\nreasonable. Well, my decision is that you had better look for some\nother preferment. For the situation which you have lately held I do\nnot think you are well suited.'\n\n'And what, my lord, has been my fault?'\n\n'That Signora Neroni is one fault,' said Mrs Proudie; 'and a very\nabominable fault she is; very abominable, and very disgraceful.\nFie, Mr Slope, fie! You an evangelical clergyman indeed!'\n\n'My lord, I desire to know for what fault I am turned out of your\nlordship's house.'\n\n'You hear what Mrs Proudie says,' said the bishop.\n\n'When I publish the history of this transaction, my lord, as I\ndecidedly shall do in my own vindication, I presume you will not\nwish me to state that you have discarded me at your wife's bidding\n--because she has objected to my being acquainted with another\nlady, the daughter of one of the prebendaries of the chapter?'\n\n'You may publish as you please, sir,' said Mrs Proudie. 'But you\nwill not be insane enough to publish any of your doings in\nBarchester. Do you think I have not heard of your kneelings at that\ncreature's feet--that is if she has any feet--and of your constant\nslobbering over her hand? I advise you to beware, Mr Slope, of what\nyou do and say. Clergymen have been unfrocked for less than what\nyou have been guilty of.'\n\n'My lord, if this goes on I shall be obliged to indict this woman--\nMrs Proudie I mean--for defamation of character.'\n\n'I think, Mr Slope, you had better now retire,' said the bishop. 'I\nwill enclose to you a cheque for any balance that may be due to\nyou; and, under the present circumstances, it will of course be\nbetter for all parties that you should leave the palace at the\nearliest possible moment.'\n\n'If, however, you wish to remain in this neighbourhood,' said Mrs\nProudie, 'and will solemnly pledge yourself never again to see that\nwoman, and will promise also to be more circumspect in your\nconduct, the bishop will mention your name to Mr Quiverful, who now\nwants a curate at Puddingdale.\n The house is, I imagine, quite sufficient for your requirements:\nand there will moreover by a stipend of fifty pounds a year.'\n\n'May God forgive you, madam, for the manner in which you have\ntreated me,' said Mr Slope, looking at her with a very heavenly\nlook; 'and remember this, madam, that you yourself may still have a\nfall;' and he looked at her with a very worldly look. 'As to the\nbishop, I pity him!' And so saying, Mr Slope left the room. Thus\nended the intimacy of the Bishop of Barchester with his\nconfidential chaplain.\n\nMrs Proudie was right in this; namely, that Mr Slope was not insane\nenough to publish to the world any of his doings in Barchester. He\ndid not trouble his friend Mr Towers with any written statement of\nthe iniquity of Mrs Proudie, or the imbecility of her husband. He\nwas aware that it would be wise in him to drop for the future all\nallusions to his doings in the cathedral city. Soon after the\ninterview just recorded, he left Barchester, shaking the dust off\nhis feet as he entered the railway carriage; and he gave no longing\nlingering look after the cathedral towers, as the train hurried him\nquickly out of their sight.\n\nIt is well known that the family of the Slopes never starve; they\nalways fall on their feet like cats, and let them fall where they\nwill, they live on the fat of the land. Our Mr Slope did so. On his\nreturn to town he found that the sugar-refiner had died, and that\nthe widow was inconsolable; or, in other words, in want of\nconsolation. Mr Slope consoled her, and soon found himself settled\nwith much comfort in the house in Baker Street. He possessed\nhimself, also before long, of a church in the vicinity of the New\nRoad, and become known to fame as one of the most eloquent\npreachers and pious clergymen in that part of the metropolis. There\nlet us leave him.\n\nOf the bishop and his wife very little further need be said. From\nthat time forth nothing material occurred to interrupt the even\ncourse of their domestic harmony. Very speedily, a further vacancy\non the bench of bishops gave Dr Proudie the seat in the House of\nLords, which he at first so anxiously longed for. But by this time,\nhe had become a wiser man. He did certainly take his seat, and\noccasionally registered a vote in favour of Government view on\necclesiastical matters.\n\nBut he had thoroughly learnt that his proper sphere of action lay\nin close contiguity with Mrs Proudie's wardrobe. He never again\naspired to disobey, or seemed even to wish for autocratic diocesan\nauthority. If ever he thought of freedom, he did so, as men think\nof the millennium, as of a good time which may be coming, but which\nnobody expects to come in their day. Mrs Proudie might be said\nstill to bloom, and was, at any rate, strong; and the bishop had no\nreason to apprehend that he would be speedily visited with the\nsorrows of a widower's life.\n\nHe is still bishop of Barchester. He has so graced that throne,\nthat the Government has been adverse to translate him, even to\nhigher duties. There may he remain, under safe pupilage, till the\nnew-fangled manners of the age have discovered him to be\nsuperannuated, and bestowed on him a pension. As for Mrs Proudie,\nour prayers for her are that she may live for ever.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LII\n\nTHE NEW DEAN TAKES POSSESSION OF THE DEANERY AND THE NEW WARDEN OF\nTHE HOSPITAL\n\nMr Harding and the archdeacon together made their way to Oxford,\nand there, by dint of cunning argument, they induced the Master of\nLazarus also to ask himself this momentous question: 'Why should\nnot Mr Arabin be Dean of Barchester?' He of course, for a while\ntried his hand at persuading Mr Harding that he was foolish,\nover-scrupulous, self-willed, and weak-minded; but he tried in\nvain. If Mr Harding would not give way to Dr Grantly, it was not\nlikely that he would give way to Dr Gwynne; more especially now\nthat so admirable a scheme as that of inducting Mr Arabin into the\ndeanery had been set on foot. When the master found that his\neloquence was vain, and heard also that Mr Arabin was about to\nbecome Mr Harding's son-in-law, he confessed that he also would,\nunder such circumstances, be glad to see his old friend and\nprotege, the fellow of his college, placed in the comfortable\nposition that was going a-begging.\n\n'It might be the means, you know, Master, of keeping Mr Slope out,'\nsaid the archdeacon with grave caution.\n\n'He has no more chance of it,' said the master, 'that our college\nchaplain. I know about it than that.'\n\nMrs Grantly had been right in her surmise. It was the Master of\nLazarus who had been instrumental in representing in high places\nthe claims of Mr Harding had from the Government; and he now\nconsented to use his best endeavours towards getting the offer\ntransferred to Mr Arabin. The three of them went on to London\ntogether, and there they remained a week, to the great disgust of\nMrs Grantly, and most probably also of Mrs Gwynne. The minister was\nout of town in one direction, and his private secretary in another.\nThe clerks who remained could do nothing in such a matter as this,\nand all was difficulty and confusion. The two doctors seemed to\nhave plenty to do; they bustled here and they bustled there, and\ncomplained at their club in the evenings that they had been driven\noff their legs; but Mr Harding had no occupation. Once or twice he\nsuggested that he might perhaps return to Barchester. His request,\nhowever, was peremptorily refused, and had nothing for it but to\nwhile away his time in Westminster Abbey.\n\nAt length an answer from the great man came. The Master of Lazarus\nhad made his proposition through the Bishop of Belgravia. Now the\nbishop, tough but newly gifted with his diocesan honours, was a man\nof much weight in the clerico-political world. He was, if not as\npious, at any rate as wise as St Paul, and had been with so much\neffect all things to all men, that though he was great among the\ndons of Oxford, he had been selected for the most favourite seat on\nthe bench by a Whig Prime Minister. To him Dr Gwynne had made known\nhis wishes and his arguments, and the bishop had made them known to\nthe Marquis of Kensington Gore. The marquis, who was Lord High\nSteward of the Pantry Board, and who by most men was supposed to\nhold the highest office out of the cabinet, trafficked much in\naffairs of this kind. He not only suggested the arrangement to the\nminister over a cup of coffee, standing on a drawing-room rug in\nWindsor Castle, but he also favourably mentioned Mr Arabin's name\nin the ear of a distinguished person.\n\nAnd so the matter was arranged. The answer of the great man came,\nand Mr Arabin was made Dean of Barchester. The three clergymen who\nhad come up to town on this important mission dined together with\ngreat glee on the day on which the news reached them. In a silent\nmanner, they toasted Mr Arabin with full bumpers of claret. The\nsatisfaction of all of them was supreme. The Master of Lazarus had\nbeen successful in his attempt, and success is dear to us all. The\narchdeacon had trampled upon Mr Slope, and had lifted to high\nhonours the young clergyman whom he had induced to quit the\nretirement and comfort of the university. So at least the\narchdeacon thought; though, to speak sooth, not he, but\ncircumstances had trampled on Mr Slope. But the satisfaction of Mr\nHarding was, of all perhaps, the most complete. He laid aside his\nusual melancholy manner, and brought forth little quiet jokes from\nthe utmost mirth of his heart; he poked fun at the archdeacon about\nMr Slope's marriage, and quizzed him for his improper love for Mrs\nProudie. On the following day they all returned to Barchester.\n\nIt was arranged that Mr Arabin should know nothing of what had been\ndone till he received the minister's letter from the hands of his\nembryo father-in-law. In order that no time be lost, a message had\nbeen sent to him by the preceding night's post, begging him to be\nat the deanery at the hour that the train from London arrived.\nThere was nothing in this which surprised Mr Arabin. It had somehow\ngot about through all bah that Mr Harding was the new dean, and all\nBarchester was prepared to welcome him with pealing bells and full\nhearts. Mr Slope had certainly had a party; there had certainly\nbeen those in Barchester who were prepared to congratulate him on\nhis promotion with assumed sincerity, but even his own party were\nnot broken-hearted by his failure. The inhabitants of the city,\neven the high-souled ecstatic young ladies of thirty-five, had\nbegun to comprehend that their welfare and the welfare of the\nplace, was connected in some mysterious manner with the daily\nchants of the bi-weekly anthems. The expenditure of the palace had\nnot added greatly to the popularity of the bishop's side of the\nquestion; and, on the whole, there was a strong reaction. When it\nbecame known to all the world that Mr Harding was to be the new\ndean, all the world rejoiced heartily.\n\nMr Arabin, as we have said, was not surprised at the summons which\ncalled him to the deanery. He had not as yet seen Mr Harding since\nEleanor had accepted him, nor had he seen him since he had learnt\nof his future father-in-law's preferment. There was nothing more\nnatural, more necessary, than that they should meet each other at\nthe earliest possible moment.\n\nMr Arabin was waiting at the deanery parlour when Mr Harding and Dr\nGrantly were driven up from the station.\n\nThere was some excitement in the bosoms of them all, as they met\nand shook hands; but far too much to enable either of them to begin\nhis story and tell it in a proper equable style of narrative. Mr\nHarding was some minutes quite dumbfounded, and Mr Arabin could\nonly talk in short, spasmodic sentences about his love and good\nfortune. He slipped in, as best he could, some sort of\ncongratulation about the deanship, and then went on with his hopes\nand fears--hopes that he might be received as a son, and fears that\nhe hardly deserved such good fortune. Then he went back to the\ndean; it was the most thoroughly satisfactory appointment, he said,\nof which he had ever heard.\n\n'But! But! But--' said Mr Harding; and then failing to get any\nfurther, he looked imploringly at the archdeacon.\n\n'The truth is, Arabin,' said the doctor, 'that, after all you are\nnot destined to be the son-in-law to a dean. Nor am I either: more's\nthe pity.'\n\nMr Arabin looked to him for explanation. 'Is not Mr Harding to be\nthe new dean?'\n\n'It appears not,' said the archdeacon. Mr Arabin's face fell a\nlittle, and he looked from one to the other. It was plainly to be\nseen from them both that there was no cause for unhappiness in the\nmatter, at least not of an unhappiness to them; but there was as\nyet no clarification of the mystery.\n\n'Think how old I am,' said Mr Harding imploringly.\n\n'Fiddlestick!' said the archdeacon.\n\n'That's all very well, but it won't make a young man of me,' said\nMr Harding.\n\n'And who is to be the dean?' asked Mr Arabin.\n\n'Yes, that is the question,' said the archdeacon. 'Come, Mr\nPrecentor, since you obstinately refuse to be anything else, let us\nknow who is to be the man. He has got the nomination in his\npocket.'\n\nWith eyes brim full of tears, Mr Harding pulled out the letter and\nhanded it to his future son-in-law. He tried to make a little\nspeech, but failed altogether. Having given up the document, he\nturned round to the wall, feigning to blow his nose, and then sat\nhimself down on the old dean's dingy horse-hair sofa. And here we\nfind it necessary to bring our account of the interview to an end.\n\nNor can we pretend to describe the rapture with which Mr Harding\nwas received by his daughter. She wept with grief and with joy;\nwith grief that her father should, in his old age, still be without\nthat rank and worldly position, which, according to her ideas, he\nhad so well earned; and with joy that he, her darling father,\nshould have bestowed on that other dear one the good things of\nwhich he himself would not open his hand to take possession. And\nher, Mr Harding again showed his weakness. In the melee of the\nexposal of their loves and reciprocal affection, he found himself\nunable to resist the entreaties of all parties that his lodgings in\nthe High Street should be given up. Eleanor would not live in the\ndeanery, she said, unless her father lived there also. Mr Arabin\nwould not be dean, unless Mr Harding would be co-dean with him. The\narchdeacon declared that his father-in-law should not have his own\nway in everything, and Mrs Grantly carried him off to Plumstead,\nthat he might remain there till Mr and Mrs Arabin were in a state\nto receive him at their own mansion.\n\nPressed by such arguments as these, what could a weak man do but\nyield?\n\nBut there was yet another task which it behoved Mr Harding to do\nbefore he could allow himself to be at rest. Little has been said\nin these pages of the state of those remaining old men who had\nlived under his sway at the hospital. But not on this account must\nit be presumed that he had forgotten them, or that in their state\nof anarchy and in their want of government he had omitted to visit\nthem. He visited them constantly, and had latterly given them to\nunderstand that they would soon be required to subscribe their\nadherence to a new master. There were now but five of them, one of\nthem not having been but quite lately carried to his rest--but five\nof the full number, which had hitherto been twelve, and which was\nnow to be raised to twenty-four, including women. Of these old\nBunce, who for many years, had been the favourite of the late\nwarden, was one; and Abel Handy, who had been the humble means from\ndriving that warden from his home, was another.\n\nMr Harding now resolved that he himself would introduce the new\nwarden to the hospital. He felt that many circumstances might\nconspire to make the men receive Mr Quiverful with aversion and\ndisrespect; he felt also that Mr Quiverful might himself feel some\nqualms of conscience if he entered the hospital with an idea that\nhe did so in hostility to his predecessor. Mr Harding therefore\ndetermined to walk in, arm in arm, with Mr Quiverful, and to ask\nfrom these men their respectful obedience to their new master.\n\nOn returning to Barchester, he found that Mr Quiverful had not yet\nslept in the hospital house, or entered on his new duties. He\naccordingly made known to that gentleman his wishes, and his\nproposition was not rejected.\n\nIt was a bright clear morning, though in November, that Mr Harding\nand Mr Quiverful, arm in arm, walked through the hospital gate. It\nwas one trait in our old friend's character that he did nothing\nwith parade. He omitted, even in the more important doings of his\nlife, that sort of parade by which most of us deem it necessary to\ngrace our important doings. We have housewarmings, christenings,\nand gala days; we keep, if not our own birthdays, those of our\nchildren; we are apt to fuss ourselves, if called upon to change\nour residences, and have, almost all of us, our little state\noccasions. Mr Harding, had no state occasions. When he left his old\nhouse, he went forth from it with the same quiet composure as\nthough he were merely taking his daily walk; and now that he\nre-entered it with another warden under his wing, he did so with\nthe same quiet step and calm demeanour. He was a little less\nupright than he had been five years, nay, it was nearly six years\nago; he walked perhaps a little slower; his footfall was perhaps a\nthought less firm; otherwise one might have same that he was merely\nreturning with a friend under his arm.\n\nThis friendliness was everything to Mr Quiverful. To him, even in\nhis poverty, the thought that he was supplanting a brother\nclergyman so kind and courteous as Mr Harding, had been very\nbitter. Under his circumstances it had been impossible for him to\nrefuse the proffered boon; he could not reject the bread that was\noffered to his children, or refuse to ease the heavy burden that\nhad so long oppressed that poor wife of his; nevertheless, it had\nbeen very grievous to him to think that in going to the hospital he\nmight encounter the ill will of his brethren in the diocese. All\nthis Mr Harding had fully comprehended. It was for such feelings as\nthese, for the nice comprehension of such motives, that his heart\nand intellect were peculiarly fitted. In most matters of worldly\nimport the archdeacon set down his father-in-law as little better\nthan a fool. And perhaps he was right. But in some other matters,\nequally important if they be rightly judged, Mr Harding, had he\nbeen so minded, might with as much propriety have set down his\nson-in-law for a fool. Few men, however, are constituted as was Mr\nHarding. He had that nice appreciation of the feelings of others\nwhich belongs of right exclusively to women.\n\nArm in arm they walked into the inner quadrangle of the building,\nand there the five old men met them. Mr Harding shook hands with\nthem all, and then Mr Quiverful did the same. With Bunce Mr Harding\nshook hands twice, and Mr Quiverful was about to repeat the\nceremony but the old man gave him no encouragement.\n\n'I am very glad to know that at last you have a new warden,' said\nMr Harding in a very cheery voice.\n\n'We be very old for any change,' said one of them; 'but we do\nsuppose it be all for the best.'\n\n'Certainly--certainly, it is for the best,' said Mr Harding. 'You\nwill again have a clergyman of your own church under the same roof\nwith you, and a very excellent clergyman you will have. It is a\ngreat satisfaction to me to know that so good a man is coming to\ntake care of you, and that it is no stranger, but a friend of my\nown, who will allow me from time to time to come in and see you.'\n\n'We be thankful to your reverence,' said another of them.\n\n'I need not tell you, my good friends,' said Mr Quiverful, 'how\nextremely grateful I am to Mr Harding for his kindness to me,--I\nmust say his uncalled for, his unexpected kindness.'\n\n'He be always very kind,' said a third.\n\n'What I can do to fill the void which he left here, I will do. For\nyour sake and my own I will do so, and especially for his sake. But\nto you who have known him, I can never be the same well-loved\nfriend and father that he has been.'\n\n'No, no, sir,' said old Bunce, who hitherto had held his peace; 'no\none can be that. Not if the new bishop sent a hangel to us from\nheaven. We doesn't doubt you'll do your best, sir, but you'll not\nbe like the old master; not to us old ones.'\n\n'Fie, Bunce, fie! how dare you talk in that way!' said Mr Harding;\nbut as he scolded the old man he still held him by his arm, and\npressed it with warm affection.\n\nThere was no getting any enthusiasm in the matter. How could five\nold men tottering away to their final resting-place be enthusiastic\non the reception of a stranger? What could Mr Quiverful be to them,\nor they to Mr Quiverful? Had Mr Harding indeed come back to them,\nsome last flicker of joyous light might have shone forth on their\naged cheeks; but it was in vain to bid them rejoice because Mr\nQuiverful was about to move his fourteen children from Puddingdale\ninto the hospital house. In reality they did no doubt receive\nadvantage, spiritual as well as corporal; but this they could\nneither anticipate nor acknowledge.\n\nIt was a dull affair enough, this introduction of Mr Quiverful; but\nstill it had its effect. The good which Mr Harding intended did not\nfall to the ground. All the Barchester world, including the five\nold bedesmen, treated Mr Quiverful with the more respect, because\nMr Harding had thus walked in arm in arm with him, on his first\nentrance to his duties.\n\nAnd here in their new abode we will leave Mr and Mrs Quiverful and\ntheir fourteen children. May they enjoy the good things which\nProvidence has at length given to them!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIII\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe end of a novel, like the end of a children's dinner-party, must\nbe made up of sweetmeats and sugar-plums. There is now nothing else\nto be told but the gala doings of Mr Arabin's marriage, nothing\nmore to be described than the wedding dresses, no further dialogue\nto be recorded than that which took place between the archdeacon\nwho married them, and Mr Arabin and Eleanor who were married. 'Wilt\nthou have this woman to thy wedded wife?' and 'Wilt thou have this\nman to thy wedded husband, to live together according to God's\nordinance?' Mr Arabin and Eleanor each answered, 'I will'. We have\nno doubt that they will keep their promises; the more especially as\nthe Signora Neroni had left Barchester before the ceremony was\nperformed.\n\nMrs Bold had been somewhat more than two years a widow before she\nwas married to her second husband, and little Johnnie was then able\nwith due assistance to walk on his own legs into the drawing-room\nto receive the salutations of the assembled guests. Mr Harding gave\naway the bride, the archdeacon performed the service, and the two\nMiss Grantlys, who were joined in their labours by other young\nladies of the neighbourhood, performed the duties of bridesmaids\nwith equal diligence and grace. Mrs Grantly superintended the\nbreakfast and bouquets and Mary Bold distributed the cards and\ncake. The archdeacon's three sons had also come home for the\noccasion. The eldest was great with learning, being regarded by all\nwho knew him as a certain future double first. The second, however,\nbore the palm on this occasion, being resplendent in his new\nuniform. The third was just entering the university, and was\nprobably the proudest of the three.\n\nBut the most remarkable feature in the whole occasion was the\nexcessive liberality of the archdeacon. He literally made presents\nto everybody. As Mr Arabin had already moved out of the parsonage\nof St Ewold's, that scheme of elongating the dining-room was of\ncourse abandoned; but he would have refurnished the whole deanery\nhad he been allowed. He sent down a magnificent piano by Erard,\ngave Mr Arabin a cob which any dean in the land might have been\nproud to bestride, and made a special present to Eleanor of a new\npony chair that had gained a prize in the Exhibition. Nor did he\neven stay his hand here; he bought a set of cameos for his wife,\nand a sapphire bracelet for Miss Bold; showered pearls and\nworkboxes on is daughters, and to each of his sons he presented a\ncheque for 20 pounds. On Mr Harding he bestowed a magnificent\nvioloncello with all the new-fashioned arrangements and expensive\nadditions, which, on account of these novelties, that gentleman\ncould never use with satisfaction to his audience or pleasure to\nhimself.\n\nThose who knew the archdeacon well, perfectly understood the cause\nof his extravagance. 'Twas thus that he sang his song of triumph\nover Mr Slope. This was his paean, his hymn of thanksgiving, his\nloud oration. He had girded himself with his sword, and gone forth\nto the war; now he was returning from the field laden with the\nspoils of the foe. The cob, the cameos, the violoncello and the\npianoforte, were all as it were trophies reft from the tent of his\nnow conquered enemy.\n\nThe Arabins after their marriage went abroad for a couple of\nmonths, according the custom in such matters now duly established,\nand then commenced their deanery life under good auspices. And\nnothing can be more pleasant than the present arrangement of\necclesiastical affairs in Barchester. The titular bishop never\ninterfered, and Mrs Proudie not often. Her sphere is more extended,\nmore noble, and more suited to her ambition than that of a\ncathedral city. As long as she can do what she pleases with the\ndiocese, she is willing to leave the dean and chapter to\nthemselves. Mr Slope tried his hand at subverting the\nold-established customs of the close, and from his failure she has\nlearnt experience. The burly chancellor and the meagre little\nprebendary are not teased by any application respecting Sabbath-day\nschools, the dean is left to his own dominions, and the intercourse\nbetween Mrs Proudie and Mrs Arabin is confined to a yearly dinner\nby each to the other. At these dinners Dr Grantly will not take a\npart; but he never fails to ask for and receive a full account of\nall that Mrs Proudie does or says.\n\nHis ecclesiastical authority has been greatly shorn since the palmy\ndays in which he reigned supreme as mayor of the palace to his\nfather, but nevertheless such authority as is now left to him he\ncan enjoy without interference. He can walk down High Street of\nBarchester without feeling that those who see him are comparing his\nclaims with those of Mr Slope. The intercourse between Plumstead\nand the deanery is of the most constant and familiar description.\nSince Eleanor has been married to a clergyman, and especially to a\ndignitary of the church, Mrs Grantly has found many more points of\nsympathy with her sister; and on a coming occasion, which is much\nlooked forward to by all parties, she intends to spend a month or\ntwo at the deanery. She never thought of spending a month in\nBarchester when little Johnny Bold was born!\n\nThe two sisters do not quite agree on matters of church doctrine,\nthough their differences are of the most amicable description. Mr\nArabin's church is two degrees higher than that of Mrs Grantly.\nThis may seem strange to those who will remember that Eleanor was\nonce accused of partiality to Mr Slope; but it is no less the fact.\nShe likes her husband's silken vest, she likes his adherence to the\nrubric, she specially likes the eloquent philosophy of his sermons,\nand she likes the red letters in her own prayer-book. It must not\nbe presumed that she has a taste for candles, or that she is at all\nastray about the real presence; but she has an inkling that way.\nShe sent a handsome subscription towards certain very heavy legal\nexpenses which have lately been incurred in Bath, her name of\ncourse not appearing; she assumes a smile of gentle ridicule when\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury is named, and she has put up a\nmemorial window in the cathedral.\n\nMrs Grantly, who belongs to the high and dry church, the high\nchurch as it was some fifty years since, before tracts were written\nand young clergymen took upon themselves the highly meritorious\nduty of cleaning churches, rather laughs at her sister. She shrugs\nher shoulders, and tells Miss Thorne that she supposes Eleanor will\nhave an oratory in the deanery before she has done. But she is not\non that account a whit displeased. A few high church vagaries do\nnot, she thinks, sit amiss on the shoulders of a young dean's wife.\nIt shows at any rate that her heart is in the subject; and it shows\nmoreover that she is removed, wide as the poles asunder, from the\ncesspool of abomination in which it was once suspected that she\nwould wallow and grovel. Anathema maranatha! Let anything be held\nas blessed, so that that be well cursed. Welcome kneelings and\nbowings, welcome matins and complines, welcome bell, book, and\ncandle, so that Mr Slope's dirty surplices and ceremonial Sabbaths\nbe held in due execration!\n\nIf it be essentially and absolutely necessary to choose between the\ntwo, we are inclined to agree with Mrs Grantly that the bell, book,\nand candle are the lesser evil of the two. Let it however be\nunderstood that no such necessity is admitted in these pages.\n\nDr Arabin (we suppose he must have become a doctor when he became a\ndean) is more moderate and less outspoken on doctrinal points than\nhis wife, as indeed in his station it behoves him to be. He is a\nstudious, thoughtful, hard-working man. He lives constantly at the\ndeanery and preaches nearly every Sunday. His time is spent in\nsifting and editing old ecclesiastical literature and in producing\nthe same articles new. At Oxford he is generally regarded as the\nmost promising clerical ornament of the age. He and his wife live\ntogether in perfect mutual confidence. There is but one secret in\nher bosom which he has not shared. He has never yet learned how Mr\nSlope had his ears boxed.\n\nThe Stanhopes soon found that Mr Slope's power need no longer\noperate to keep them from the delight of their Italian villa.\nBefore Eleanor's marriage they had all migrated back to the shores\nof Como. They had not been resettled long before the signora\nreceived from Mrs Arabin a very pretty though very short epistle,\nin which she was informed of the fate of the writer. This letter\nwas answered by another, bright, charming, and witty, as the\nsignora's always were; and so ended the friendship between Eleanor\nand the Stanhopes.\n\nOne word of Mr Harding, and we have done.\n\nHe is still Precentor of Barchester, and still pastor of the little\nchurch of St Cuthbert's. In spite of what he has so often said\nhimself, he is not even yet an old man. He does such duties as fall\nto his lot well and conscientiously, and is thankful that he has\nnever been tempted to assume others for which he might be less\nfitted.\n\nThe Author now leaves him in the hands of his readers; not as a\nhero, not as a man to be admired and talked of, not as a man who\nshould be toasted at public dinners and spoken of with conventional\nabsurdity as a perfect divine, but as a good man without guile,\nbelieving humbly in the religion which he strives to teach, and\nguided by the precepts which he has striven to learn\n\nTHE END\n\nEnd of this Project Gutenberg Etext of Barchester Towers by Anthony\nTrollope\n","id":1322,"split":"test"}
